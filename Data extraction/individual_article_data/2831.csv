0,Introduction,"In recent decades, peroxydisulfate (PDS) has shown as a promising oxidant for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater (Devi et al., 2016; Ike et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Activation of PDS can be achieved by several methods using UV (Xie et al., 2015), heat (Zrinyi and Pham, 2017), alkaline (Furman et al., 2010) and transition metals (e.g., Fe(II), Ag(I), Co(II), and Cu(II)) (Anipsitakis and Dionysiou, 2004). Owing to the cost-effective, high catalytic activity, and environmental-friendly nature, Fe(II) is one of the most promising PDS activator for engineering application (Wu et al., 2014). It has been demonstrated in our recent work that the primary reactive intermediate formed in the Fe(II)/PDS system is ferryl ion species (Fe(IV)), rather than long recognized sulfate radical (SO4 •-), by using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as a probe (Wang et al., 2018, 2019). It was firstly identified that PMSO could be transferred to its corresponding sulfones (methyl phenyl sulfone (PMSO2)) by FeIVO2+ (Eq. (1)), while SO4 •- oxidized PMSO to produce biphenyl compounds rather than PMSO2 (Eq. (2)), similar to the case of •OH (Wang et al., 2018): (1) (2) Contrary to literature expectation, PMSO2 product was formed when PMSO was treated by the Fe(II)/PDS system at acidic and neutral pH, and the yield of PMSO2 (i.e., η(PMSO2), the molar ratio of PMSO2 produced to PMSO lost) was quantified to be 100% at acidic pH. This result indicated that Fe(IV) was the dominant reactive intermediate formed in the Fe(II)/PDS system under acidic conditions, and Fe(IV) also occurred at circumneutral pH (Eq. (3)) (Wang et al., 2018). (3) Fe2+ + S2O8 2− + H2O → FeⅣO2+ + 2SO4 2− + 2H+ k = 2.0 × 101 M−1s−1 Due to the precipitation of iron at neutral and alkaline pH, the Fe(II)/PDS system was inefficiency therein (Rastogi et al., 2009; Han et al., 2015). To enhance the performance of the Fe(II)/PDS system on eliminating contaminants at high pH, iron-chelators are often used to solubilize iron (Keenan and Sedlak, 2008a; Rastogi et al., 2009; Han et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2016). The commonly used iron-chelators can be categorized into three types including the polycarboxylates (e.g., oxalate acid (OA), citric acid (CA)), aminocarboxylates (e.g., nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), and phosphates ligands (e.g., pyrophosphate (PPP), tetrapolyphosphate (TPP)) according to their coordination sites (i.e., carboxyl, amino or phosphate group). Although some researchers have comparatively investigated the effect of several chelators on reactive intermediate production in the Fe(II)/PDS system, no proper buffer was used in these studies, which affected the actual solution pH or competitively coordinated with iron (e.g., phosphate buffer) (Liang et al., 2004; Rastogi et al., 2009; Han et al., 2015). Therefore, a systematic re-evaluation of the influence of chelator on reactive intermediate production in Fe(II)/PDS system with careful pH control is required. Moreover, limited information is available on the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems. Comparatively, the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the Fe(II) activated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) process in the presence and absence of chelators have been extensively investigated. By invoking sulfoxides (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and PMSO) as a probe, it was demonstrated that hydroxyl radical (•OH) was the primary intermediate generated in the Fe(II)/H2O2 system under acidic conditions (Eq. (4a)), while the reactive intermediate shifted to Fe(IV) at near-neutral pH (Eq. (4b)) (Bataineh et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2018). (4a) H2O2 + Fe2+ → •OH + OH− + Fe3+ k = 7.6 × 101 M−1s−1 (4b) H2O2 + Fe2+ → H2O + FeIVO2+ However, contradictory conclusions on the nature of reactive intermediate formed in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems were obtained in literature. Take the case of EDTA for example, some researchers reported that Fe(IV) was the reactive intermediate produced in EDTA assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 system at near-neutral pH (Rush and Koppenol, 1986), while others identified •OH as the primary intermediate (Miller et al., 2016) or found a mixture of •OH and Fe(IV) under circumneutral condition (Yamazaki and Piette, 1991). A similar conflicting conclusion was also obtained in the Fe(II)/H2O2 system assisted by other chelators, such as OA (Park et al., 1997; Keenan and Sedlak, 2008a; Thomas et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018), NTA (Keenan and Sedlak, 2008a; Dao and De Laat, 2011) and TPP (Wang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015, 2017). Miller et al. (2016) concluded that the limitations of the common methods for the identification of the reactive intermediates (e.g., alcohol scavenging experiments, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic model analysis) prevented these studies from getting a definitive conclusion. The current study aims to explore the effect of six representative iron-chelators (OA, CA, NTA, EDTA, PPP, and TPP; see Scheme 1 for their binding sites) on the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the Fe(II)/PDS system by invoking PMSO as a probe. Firstly, PDS decomposition and PMSO loss were quantitatively measured under different chelator/Fe(II) molar ratios and pH to evaluate the chelator influence on intermediate production. Moreover, the formation of Fe(IV) indicative product PMSO2 was monitored under various conditions in an attempt to explore the effect of chelator on altering the reactive oxidant nature. Comparatively, these experiments were also conducted in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 system under similar conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Sodium oxalate, trisodium citrate, nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt, pyrophosphoric acid, iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O), PDS (Na2S2O8) of reagent grade and H2O2 (30 wt % in water) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Sodium tetrapolyphosphate (Na6P4O13) of reagent grade was purchased from International Laboratory Co., USA. PMSO and PMSO2 of reagent grade were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd. All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water (>18.2 MΩ·cm, Millipore). Ferrous iron stock solutions were freshly prepared and standardized by the 1, 10-phenanthroline colorimetric method (Keenan and Sedlak, 2008b)."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure 2.2.1 Batch reactions in synthetic water Solutions of Fe(II)-chelator complexes were freshly prepared by mixing required amount of Fe(II) and chelator stock solutions in deaeration water with continuously bubbling nitrogen gas to prevent the spontaneous oxidation of Fe(II)-chelator complexes. Batch experiments were initiated by adding appropriate amount of Fe(II)-chelator complex solution ([Fe(II)]0 = 100 μM, [chelator]0 = 0–500 μM) to the pH-adjusted solution containing oxidant (500 μM H2O2 or PDS) and PMSO (50 μM) under magnetic stirring. Solutions at pH 3 (no buffer) were adjusted by adding HClO4. Sodium acetate buffer (5 mM) was used for pH 4 and 5. Sodium borate buffer (5 mM) was used for pH 7 and 9. These buffers were used because they do not form complexes with iron. The pH varied by less than 0.2 units during the reaction. Samples (950 μL) were withdrawn at certain time intervals and immediately quenched by adding 50 μL DMSO before analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for PMSO and PMSO2. All experiments were performed at 20 °C in triplicates and the mean values with standard deviations were presented. 2.2.2 Experiments in real waters Two real waters were used in this work, including surface water and wastewater effluent from a municipal sewage plant. These water samples were filtered through 1 μm filter. The physicochemical properties of these real waters were listed in Table S1. Reactions were initiated by adding the prepared Fe(II)-chelator complex solution ([chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 = 50/100 μM) to the real water matrices following the similar procedure to that in synthetic solutions."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Concentrations of PDS were measured with a modified iodometric method (Liang et al., 2008). Concentrations of H2O2 were determined spectrophotometrically using an N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD)/peroxidase method (Bader et al., 1998). PMSO and PMSO2 were analyzed by Waters 1525 HPLC with UV detection at 230 and 215 nm, respectively. Chromatographic separations were performed on a Waters symmetry C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) using a binary mixture of acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% acetic acid) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min."

6,Effect of chelator concentration on PDS decomposition and PMSO loss in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems at pH 3,"3.1 Effect of chelator concentration on PDS decomposition and PMSO loss in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems at pH 3 3.1.1 Polycarboxylate chelators (OA and CA) 3.1.1.1 PDS decomposition Oxalate acid and citric acid contain two and three carboxyl dentates, respectively, and thus they will completely chelate Fe(II) to form a hexacoordinated complex at chelator/Fe(II) molar ratio of 3/1 or 2/1 (Han et al., 2015). Accordingly, the effect of chelator initial concentration ([chelator]0) on PDS decomposition and PMSO (50 μM) transformation in the Fe(II)/PDS (100/500 μM) system was studied at six chelator/Fe(II) molar ratios of 0/1, 0.5/1, 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, and 5/1 at pH 3. In the OA assisted Fe(II)/PDS system, within the investigated time (90 min), PDS decomposition (i.e., Δ[PDS]t) increased from about 100 to 182 μM with increasing [OA]0/[Fe(II)]0 from 0/1 to 2/1, and then dramatically decreased to 108 μM with [OA]0/[Fe(II)]0 further increasing to 5/1 (Table 1 ). As for the CA assisted Fe(II)/PDS system, Δ[PDS]t was significantly promoted from 100 to 320 μM with increasing [CA]0/[Fe(II)]0 from 0/1 to 5/1, and it was much higher than that in the OA assisted cases at each [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 molar ratios (Table 1), similar to the study of Han et al. (2015). The acceleration of PDS decomposition by addition of appropriate OA and CA could be attributed to the following reasons: (i) OA-Fe(II) and CA-Fe(II) complexes show higher reactivity than aqueous Fe(II) toward PDS activation, similar to the OA and CA assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems. For example, the reaction rate of FeII(C2O4) with H2O2 (3 × 104 M−1s−1) is almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of aqueous Fe(II) with H2O2 (7.6 × 101 M−1s−1) (Balmer and Sulzberger, 1999); and (ii) the OA and CA oxidation intermediates facilitated the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) through the following radical chain reactions (Eqs. (5)–(10)), which further promoted PDS decomposition. Specifically, polycarboxylate chelators (R–COOH) were oxidized by the reactive intermediate(s) (Fe(IV) and/or SO4 •-) (Eqs. (5) and (6)) to produce carboxyl anion radicals (•CO2 −) or alkyl radicals (•R), depending on the attack sites of carboxylates by reactive intermediate(s) oxidation (see details in Text S1) (Jacobsen et al., 1998; Pestovsky and Bakac, 2004; Criquet and Leitner, 2009; Thomas et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2019): (5) FeIVO2+ + R–COOH → Fe3+ + •CO2 −/•R + intermediates (6) SO4 •- + R–COOH → SO4 2− + •CO2 −/•R + intermediates Subsequently, •CO2 − and/or •R rapidly captured O2 to produce superoxide (O2 •-, Eqs. (7) and (8)), with forming alkyl-peroxyl radicals (ROO•) as the intermediates in •R transformation cases (Bettina and Barbara, 1996; Balmer and Sulzberger, 1999; Perissinotti et al., 2001; Pestovsky and Bakac, 2004): (7) •CO2 − + O2 → CO2 + O2 •- k = 2.4 × 109 M−1s−1 (8) •R + O2 → ROO• → Rox + O2 •- Both O2 •- and the potential formed •CO2 − were responsible for the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) (Jeong and Yoon, 2004; Pang et al., 2019): (9) Fe3+-L + O2 •- → Fe2+-L + O2 (10) Fe3+-L + •CO2 − → Fe2+-L + CO2 The reduction rates of Fe(III) by O2 •- and CO2 •- were dependent on the speciation of Fe(III). For instance, k9 were 1.5 × 108 (Rush and Bielski, 1985), <1.5 × 106 (Sedlak and Hoigné, 1993), and 8 × 102 M−1s−1 (Garg et al., 2007) for FeIII(OH)2+, Fe-OA, and Fe-CA complexes, respectively. In control experiments with continuously bubbling N2, PDS decomposition was inhibited in the OA and CA assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems comparing with the cases without bubbling N2 (Fig. S1). This result further suggested that O2 participated in promoting PDS decomposition by accelerating Fe(III) reduction (Eqs. (7)–(9)) in these polycarboxylate chelators assisted systems. However, it was reported that the activation of peroxygen oxidant by Fe(II) required the availability of at least one iron coordination site that was open or occupied by a readily dissociable ligand such as water molecule (Graf et al., 1984). Hence, it seemed likely that excess OA would inhibit the accessibility of Fe(II) center for PDS attachment, which led to the decrease of PDS decomposition (Table 1). 3.1.1.2 PMSO loss Fig. 1 a and b showed PMSO loss in the OA and CA assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems. In the control experiment without chelator, it was observed that 29 μM PMSO was rapidly degraded within the first 5 min, and afterwards 5 μM PMSO was gradually degraded at a slower rate. Similarly, it was reported that the oxidation of several contaminants (e.g., trichloroethylene (Wu et al., 2014), atrazine (Bu et al., 2016), and naproxen (Dulova et al., 2017)) by the Fe(II)/PDS system also showed two stage kinetics. This finding was explained by the rapid reactive intermediate formation in Fe(II) activated PDS process and the subsequent slow recovery from Fe(III) to Fe(II) by organic oxidation intermediates in previous literature (Wu et al., 2014; Bu et al., 2016; Dulova et al., 2017). However, it was found that PDS was continuously decomposed within the investigated time in the Fe(II)/PDS system with and without PMSO (Fig. S2). One possible explanation for this result involved the reduction of Fe(III) by persulfate radical (S2O8 •-), an inorganic oxidation intermediate of PDS (see details in Text S2) (Liu et al., 2014, 2015; Zhu et al., 2018a,b). With the addition of 50 μM OA and CA (i.e., [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 = 0.5/1), PMSO loss at 90 min (Δ[PMSO]t) obviously increased to 48 and 42 μM, respectively, but a higher [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 led to the decrease of Δ[PMSO]t (Fig. 1a and b), in spite of the high PDS decomposition in these cases. Further, PDS utilization efficiency for the degradation of PMSO (η(PDS)) was quantitatively evaluated by the molar ratio of Δ[PMSO]t/Δ[PDS]t, which was decreased with increasing [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 in both cases of OA and CA (Table 1). This result was explained by the competition of polycarboxylate chelators with PMSO for the formed reactive intermediate(s). 3.1.2 Aminocarboxylate chelators (NTA and EDTA) 3.1.2.1 PDS decomposition The tetra- and hexa-dentates aminocarboxylate chelators (i.e., NTA and EDTA, respectively) were selected to investigate the Fe(II)-aminocarboxylate (100 μM) complexes activated PDS (500 μM) processes at the six [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 (0/1 to 5/1) at pH 3 with 50 μM PMSO. As shown in Table 1, with increasing [NTA]0/[Fe(II)]0 from 0/1 to 5/1, Δ[PDS]t gradually decreased from 100 to 71 μM. Similar result was obtained in the EDTA/Fe(II)/PDS system where Δ[PDS]t significantly decreased to 51 μM with increasing [EDTA]0/[Fe(II)]0 to 1/1, and even no PDS was decomposed at higher [EDTA]0/[Fe(II)]0. Likewise, it was reported that (S,S)-ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), another hexa-dentate aminocarboxylate chelator, coordinated Fe(II) showed low ability of activating PDS as [EDDS]0/[Fe(II)]0 was higher than 1/1, because the complete coordination of Fe(II) with excess EDDS formed a bulky hexacoordinated complex which hindered the attachment of Fe(II) center by PDS (Han et al., 2015). Comparatively, the small molecule size chelators like OA and CA with shorter carbon chain length have slighter effect on hindering the reaction of Fe(II) with PDS. This steric hindrance effect reasonably explained the finding of the higher PDS decomposition in OA and CA assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems than in these two aminocarboxylate chelators assisted cases under similar [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 molar ratio (Table 1). Similarly, Rachmilovich-Calis et al. (2011) found that although both tri-polyphosphate and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) chelators contained three phosphate groups, tri-polyphosphate increased the Fenton reaction rate more obviously than ATP did. This is due to that ATP has another several nitrogen atoms in its adenine group, which in turn introduce higher steric hindrance. 3.1.2.2 PMSO loss As shown in Fig. 2 a and b, the degradation of PMSO in both systems also progressed through a fast stage followed by a slow stage within 90 min, which could be ascribed to the fact of fast formation of reactive intermediate and slow regeneration from Fe(III) to Fe(II) as aforementioned. The inhibition of PDS decomposition and PMSO loss observed in the control experiments with bubbling N2 further verified the involvement of carboxyl group oxidation intermediates-induced Fe(III) reduction (Fig. S1). Moreover, it was observed that Δ[PMSO]t also decreased with the increase of [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 in both cases of NTA and EDTA (Fig. 2a and b), in line with the PDS decomposition. Additionally, the calculated η(PDS) values decreased with increasing [aminocarboxylate]0/[Fe(II)]0 (Table 1), similar to the polycarboxylate cases, suggesting that aminocarboxylates also competitively consumed the formed reactive intermediates. 3.1.3 Polyphosphates chelators (PPP and TPP) 3.1.3.1 PDS decomposition The selected polyphosphates chelators, PPP and TPP, contained two and four dentates, respectively (Scheme 1). Their effect on the reactive intermediate formation in the Fe(II)/PDS system were evaluated under similar conditions to the cases of polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators. It was found that both Fe(II)-PPP and Fe(II)-TPP complexes showed poor ability on activating PDS; less than 30 μM PDS was decomposed at each case (Table 1). As a result, PMSO loss was at a low level; less than 10 μM of PMSO was degraded when 50 μM PPP or TPP was added ([chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 = 0.5/1), and PMSO loss was even negligible at higher [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 (Fig. 3 a and b). These observations indicated that the strong steric hindrance by PPP and TPP impeded the interaction between PDS and Fe(II)-PPP/Fe(II)-TPP complexes. 3.1.3.2 PMSO loss Notably, the oxidation of PMSO was fast completed within 5 min, and no further PMSO degradation was observed, which was different from the continuous degradation of PMSO in both polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelator assisted cases. Moreover, PDS decomposition and PMSO loss in the control experiments with bubbling N2 were indistinguishable from those obtained under aerobic condition in these polyphosphates assisted cases (Fig. S1). These results were rationalized by the fact that polyphosphates were resistant to oxidation (Biaglow and Kachur, 1997; Wang and Brusseau, 1998; Rastogi et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015), which led to the absence of the chelator oxidation intermediates-induced Fe(III) reduction (such as Eqs. (5)–(10)). 3.1.4 Comparison with the effect of chelator concentration on H2O2 decomposition and PMSO loss in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems at pH 3 For comparison, effect of chelator concentration ([chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 = 0/1 to 5/1) on the decomposition of H2O2 and oxidation of PMSO (50 μM) in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 (100/500 μM) systems were also investigated at pH 3. As shown in Table S2, the decomposition of H2O2 at 90 min (Δ[H2O2]t) was decreased to different extent with the increase of [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 in all the tested chelator assisted processes, and the inhibition effect on H2O2 decomposition by the chelators roughly followed the order: CA < OA < NTA < EDTA < TPP < PPP. This order was consistent with that obtained in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems where Fe(II)-CA complex was the most effective activator for PDS and Fe(II)-polyphosphates complexes exhibited the strongest inhibition effect on PDS activation (Table 1). The oxidation of PMSO was divided into the fast stage and the slow stage in the polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems, while the PMSO degradation was quickly completed within the first 5 min in the cases of polyphosphates chelators (Fig. S3), similar to the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems. Moreover, the inhibition effect of bubbling N2 on H2O2 decomposition and PMSO loss was obtained in the polycarboxylates and aminocarboxylates assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems, but not observed in cases of polyphosphates (Fig. S4). As mentioned above, these results were attributed to the Fe(III) reduction induced by the oxidation intermediates of carboxyl group (Eqs. (5)–(10)), which was absent in the polyphosphates assisted systems. Further, the adverse effect of increasing [chelator]0 on η(H2O2) values was observed in the polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems (Table S1), similar to the cases of PDS."
7,Effect of chelator concentration on PMSO2 formation in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems at pH 3,"3.2 Effect of chelator concentration on PMSO2 formation in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems at pH 3 3.2.1 PMSO2 production The production of PMSO2 in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems was monitored. It was obtained that, in the control case without chelator, the production of PMSO2 rapidly increased to 28 μM within first 5 min (Eq. (3)), and then continuously increased to about 32 μM at 90 min along with the slow oxidation of PMSO (Fig. 1a). With increasing [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 from 0.5/1 to 5/1, PMSO2 production at 90 min (Δ[PMSO2]t) was decreased to different extent in each tested chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems (Figs. 1–3), suggesting the decrease of available Fe(IV) in the Fe(II)/PDS system with higher [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0. Comparatively, no PMSO2 was formed in any chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 system, indicating that •OH was responsible for the PMSO degradation in all these cases at pH 3. 3.2.2 PMSO2 yield To quantify the relative contribution of Fe(IV) and SO4 •- on PMSO loss in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems, the η(PMSO2) values were calculated. In the chelator free Fe(II)/PDS system, the calculated η(PMSO2) value was about 100%. Interestingly, it was found that the increase of [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 resulted in the decrease of the calculated η(PMSO2) value in each tested chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS system (Figs. 1–3), indicating that both Fe(IV) and SO4 •- contributed to the transformation of PMSO and the contribution of Fe(IV) was inversely proportional to [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0. It seemed likely that the coordination of Fe(II) with the tested chelator altered the nature of the reactive oxidant formed in Fe(II)/PDS system from Fe(IV) (Eq. (3)) to SO4 •- (Eq. (11)). This conversion might be related to the change of Fe(II) chemistry (e.g., the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox potential, steric hindrance, and charge) via forming Fe(II)-chelator complexes (see details in Text S3) (Biaglow and Kachur, 1997; Bataineh et al., 2012; Adusei-Gyamfi et al., 2019). Further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism. (11) Fe2+-L + S2O8 2− → Fe3+-L + SO4 •- + SO4 2−"
8,Effect of pH on PDS decomposition and PMSO loss in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems,"3.3 Effect of pH on PDS decomposition and PMSO loss in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems 3.3.1 PDS decomposition The effect of solution pH was studied over a wide range of 3–9 under typical conditions (i.e., 50/100 μM [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0, 500 μM [PDS]0, and 50 μM [PMSO]0). The decomposition of PDS at different pH in the six chelator assisted systems was shown in Fig. S5. With increasing pH from 3 to 9, Δ[PDS]t decreased from the maximum to 0 in the chelator assisted systems, similar to the control case without chelator. Δ[PDS]t in the tested systems was in the sequence: CA > OA > NTA > chelator free system > EDTA > TPP > PPP. Further, speciation of Fe species as a function of pH was calculated by Visual Minteq software, except for polyphosphate chelators cases due to the lack of key parameters (pKa and stability constants) in the software. As shown in Fig. S6, the proportion of Fe(II)-chelator complexes increased with increasing pH, which was attributed to the fact that the deprotonation of carboxyl group increased the available binding sites of chelators (see Table S3 for their pKa) (Adusei-Gyamfi et al., 2019). The coordination of iron with chelators increased its solubility at high pH, however, the steric hindrance of the formed complexes prevented Fe(II) from PDS attachment. 3.3.2 PMSO loss Similar to the effect of pH on PDS decomposition, the increase of pH showed a negative effect on the PMSO loss in the Fe(II)/PDS system with and without chelators (Fig. 4 a). At each pH, the oxidation of PMSO was promoted by addition of polycarboxylate chelators while significantly inhibited with adding polyphosphates chelators. Although the PMSO loss was slightly promoted by the addition of some chelators under high pH, the efficiency was still too low. For instance, Δ[PMSO]t was less than 5 μM at pH 7 and even no PMSO was observed at pH 9 in the CA assisted Fe(II)/PDS system, which was the most effective system for PMSO degradation (Fig. 4a). Moreover, the poor degradation of PMSO by the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems was also obtained in the experiments using real waters at neutral pH (Δ[PMSO]t < 1 μM in each case, Figs. S7a and b), where neutral solution pH maintained constant during the reactions (Figs. S7c and d). Interestingly, it has been reported that the Fe(II)/PDS systems with and without chelator have a good performance on eliminating contaminants (e.g., aniline (Han et al., 2015), levofloxacin (Epold et al., 2015), naproxen (Dulova et al., 2017), and ibuprofen (Jin et al., 2018)) at initial near-neutral pH in the literature. This is likely in contrast to the effect of pH on PMSO loss in the chelator assisted or chelator free Fe(II)/PDS system obtained in this work (Fig. 4). However, we note that these studies have always been conducted in un-buffered solutions, where the addition of acidic Fe(II) and PDS stock solutions, as well as the release of H+ during the activation of PDS (Eq. (3)) would result in an unavoidable immediate decrease of solution pH (from near-neutral to acidic condition). Unfortunately, most of these studies neglected the significant change of solution pH. In other words, the good performance of the Fe(II)/PDS systems with and without chelator under initial circumneutral conditions observed in the literature was attributed to the acidification of unbuffered solutions. 3.3.3 Comparison with the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems For comparison, the effect of solution pH on H2O2 decomposition and PMSO transformation in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems was also investigated at a wide pH range of 3–9. It was found that the increase of pH led to the decrease of H2O2 decomposition (Fig. S8), similar to the case of PDS decomposition (Fig. S5). In parallel, PMSO loss decreased with the increase of pH in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems (Fig. 5 a). Under acidic conditions (pH ≤ 5), Δ[PMSO]t was in the order of: CA > OA > NTA > EDTA > TPP > PPP. However, TPP-Fe(II) complexes led to the most effective degradation of PMSO at pH 7 and 9. Kim et al. (2015) also reported that TPP assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 system achieved the highest degradation efficiency on microcystin-LR oxidation at pH 7, comparing to the cases of OA and EDTA. Further, PMSO loss was still negligible in the experiments with using real waters at near-neutral pH (Fig. S9)."
9,Effect of pH on PMSO2 formation in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems,"3.4 Effect of pH on PMSO2 formation in the chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems In the tested chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems, it was found that although PMSO2 production was negatively influenced by increasing pH from 3 to 9, the calculated η(PMSO2) value was almost independent on solution pH (Fig. 4b and c). This result indicated that solution pH had no effect on the nature of reactive intermediate formed in these chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems. As for the chelator assisted Fe(II)/H2O2 systems, no formation of PMSO2 was detected with using 50 μM PMSO to capture the reactive intermediate, indicating that •OH mainly contributed to the PMSO loss at these cases. Further, a higher concentration of PMSO (1 mM) was used to capture the reactive intermediate. It was found that PMSO2 production increased from 0 to the maximum with pH increasing from 3 to 5, and then decreased to less than 2 μM at pH 7 and almost 0 at pH 9 (Fig. 5b). In this case, the yield of PMSO2 was hard to be calculated, because the PMSO loss was too small compared to the quite high [PMSO]0 as we stated previously (Wang et al., 2018). Nevertheless, it was found that the maximum production of PMSO2 was obtained in the chelator free Fe(II)/H2O2 system at pH 5, where the lowest Δ[PMSO]t was obtained (Fig. 5). Hence, it was reasonable to believe that the formation of Fe(II)-chelator complexes with each tested chelator altered the nature of the intermediate formed by the reaction of Fe(II) with H2O2 from Fe(IV) to •OH at near-neutral pH."
10,Conclusions,"This study systemically investigated the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the Fe(II)/PDS and Fe(II)/H2O2 systems in the presence of six representative chelators by examining the oxidant decomposition and PMSO transformation, which not only clarified the complex effect of chelators on reactive intermediate formation, but also gave the first insight into the relative contribution of Fe(IV) and SO4 •-/•OH in these systems. The main conclusions are as follows: (i) The polycarboxylates (especially CA) were the most effective chelator for promoting intermediate reactive production in the Fe(II)/PDS system over a wide pH range (pH 3–9). However, the most effective chelator for the Fe(II)/H2O2 system changed from CA at acidic pH to TPP under near-neutral conditions. (ii) The optimal [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 molar ratio for promoting the degradation efficiency of PMSO was 0.5/1 for each tested chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS and Fe(II)/H2O2 system. (iii) Although the PMSO loss was slightly promoted by the addition of chelators at neutral and alkaline pH, the degradation efficiency was still too low in the chelator assisted cases. (iv) The tested chelators altered the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the Fe(II)/PDS system from Fe(IV) to SO4 •-. The yield of Fe(IV) was negatively affected by increasing [chelator]0/[Fe(II)]0 but was independent on pH. (v) The tested chelators led to the change of the reactive intermediate formed in Fe(II)/H2O2 system from Fe(IV) to •OH under circumneutral conditions, similar to the cases of PDS."
