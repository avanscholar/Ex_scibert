0,Introduction,"Owing to the rapid growth in the hydrogen production industry, an effective hydrogen generation is one of great importance (Taqieddin et al., 2017). However, there exists the critical current density (CCD) limiting the hydrogen generation rate (Vogt et al., 2004) in the hydrogen evolving system using a water electrolysis. At the initial operation of the electrolysis, the current density increased with the cell potential increasing the hydrogen generation rate. However, at a certain high cell potential, the current density is limited by the formation of the hydrogen film on the cathode surface, which acts as an electric resistance (Vogt, 2017). Similarly in the boiling heat transfer system, the vapor generation is limited by the formation of the vapor film on the heating surface, which phenomenon is called critical heat flux (CHF) (Liang and Mudawar, 2018). Numerous endeavors have been made to investigate the CHF mechanism in the boiling heat transfer system. Although, a general theory has not been established yet, many well-accepted CHF models (Liang and Mudawar, 2018) have been proposed elucidating the mechanism by different perspectives. The dry spot model is one of the well-accepted CHF models, which focuses on the bubble behavior adjacent to the heating surface. The model postulated that limitation of the nucleate boiling regime leads to the CHF; when the bubble is attached to the heating surface, a dry spot beneath the bubble is formed and acts as a thermal resistance. At a certain high heat flux with the increased active nucleation site, the dry spot is enlarged due to the bubble coalescence. This phenomenon gradually limits the nucleate boiling, which hinders the bulk liquid to rewet the heating surface and thus the heat transfer coefficient is deteriorated as the enlarged dry spot acting as a thermal resistance. The CHF is then triggered as this phenomenon becomes intensified. Ha and No (1998) estimated the critical number of bubbles for the CHF employing the Poisson distribution of the active nucleation sites within a control area. When the number of bubbles surrounding a single bubble reaches a critical number, the bubbles hinder the bulk liquid to rewet the heating surface, which results in the CHF. Succeeding to the Ha and No’s work (Ha and No, 1998), post researches (Ha and No, 2000; Chung and No, 2003; Chung and No, 2007; Kim et al., 2016) have been investigated the detailed phase distribution on the heating surface. There are some similarities between the hydrogen evolving system and the boiling system. The N-shaped curve is measured in both the systems as shown in the Fig. 1 . Based on this fact, several researches (Mazza et al., 1978; Sillen et al., 1982; Vogt, 2013) have been investigated the analogous relationship between the CHF and the CCD and found the similar curve shape with superficial bubble appearances. The authors postulated that the CCD is triggered when the hydrogen bubbles hinder the bulk electrolyte to rewet the cathode surface, similar to the dry spot model for the CHF, since the active nucleation site in the hydrogen evolving system also increased as the current density increased (De Jonge et al., 1980; Park and Chung, 2021). Based on the similar perspectives between two systems, the present work proposes a CCD model applying the dry spot model to envisage the CCD phenomenon using 1.5 M of sulfuric acid electrolysis."
1,Experimental setup,
2,Test section and electric circuit,"2.1 Test section and electric circuit Fig. 2 depicts the schematic configuration and photograph of the test section. A copper disk of diameter 10 mm was designed as the cathode, which generates hydrogen bubbles. The surface was polished with 2000-grit sand paper. The surface roughness, Ra and porosity were measured as 18.9 nm and 8.2%, respectively (Korea Polymer Testing & Research Institute, KOPTRI). Prior to the experiment, the surface was cleaned with deionized water and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in sequence. The K-type thermocouple was embedded to monitor the surface temperature of the cathode. The electric circuit of the experimental apparatus is shown in the Fig. 3 . A rectangular acrylic tank contained 60 L of the aqueous solution of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) of 1.5 M at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (294 K) together with the cathode and anode electrodes. Power supply (Keysight N8952A) and data acquisition (DAQ) system were set to impose and record the cell potential (NI9225) and the current density. The high current engaged in this reaction was measured by the potential drop (NI9238) across the shunt register, which has the very small resistance (0.1 mΩ). A mercury thermometer monitored the bulk solution temperature. The high-speed camera (Phantom Lab 111 6GMono, Vision Research) recorded the hydrogen bubble behaviors during the experiments."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures The current density engaged in hydrogen generation at the cathode was measured at the step increase of the cell potential. A time duration of ∼5 s was needed at each cell potential step to reach stabilized cell potential and current density as shown in Fig. 4 . The CCD was measured just before the sudden drop of the current density, similar to the CHF, which is determined just before the sudden drop of the heat flux. Four independent repetitive experiments were performed and the average CCD and the standard deviation were 179.32 ± 4.23 kA/m2."
4,Uncertainty analysis,"2.3 Uncertainty analysis Uncertainty of the measured CCD was estimated by applying data-reduction techniques (Coleman and Steele, 1999). The uncertainty of the current density can be expressed as (1) I ″ = I A , U I ″ = ∂ I ″ ∂ I U I 2 + ∂ I ″ ∂ A U A 2 . The UA was assumed to be 3.93 × 10−6 m2 by the resolution of the milling machine, which produced the cathode surface. The UI was calculated by applying Ohm’s law as follow: (2) I = E R , U I = ∂ I ∂ E U E 2 + ∂ I ∂ R U R 2 , where UR and UE were stipulated in the specifications of the devices, SCRD-R0001-5.0-H and NI9238 respectively. Consequently, the maximum fractional uncertainty of the CCD was 5.35%."
5,Proposing the insulated spot model,"The CCD is regarded as the maximum operation limit in the hydrogen evolving system just like the CHF in the boiling system. However, there is an absence of the model elucidating the CCD phenomenon. Based on the similarities between the hydrogen evolving system and the boiling system, the authors propose a CCD model, ‘insulated spot model’ by borrowing from the dry spot model in the boiling heat transfer. Some of modifications should be implemented to the dry spot model to incorporate the hydrogen bubbles. The present chapter is to review and confirm the nucleation characteristics of the hydrogen bubbles to estimate the critical number of hydrogen bubbles such as the active nucleation site density (Na ), the bubble departure diameter (Dd ) and the bubble frequency (f)."
6,Nucleation characteristics of the hydrogen evolving system,"3.1 Nucleation characteristics of the hydrogen evolving system Fig. 5 compares the Na ’s of the boiling system and the hydrogen evolving system which was reported in the authors’ previous work (Park and Chung, 2021) using identical diluted sulfuric acid electrolysis system to the present work. The Na of the present electrolysis system increased with the current density (Park and Chung, 2021) just like the Na of the boiling system increases with the heat flux, Eq. (3), which bears an analogous relation. Hence, the Na in the present electrolysis system is derived with current density as expressed in the Eq. (4). (3) N a = C q ″ n , ( n > 1 ) . (4) N a = 1.136 × 10 9 I ″ 0.0055 - 1.14 × 10 9 . There are differences between the two system, as well. Fig. 5 shows that the present electrolysis system shows much higher Na than the boiling system. Also the Na of the present electrolysis system is concave with the current, while that of the boiling system is convex with the heat flux as expressed in Wang and Dhir’s experimental data (Wang and Dhir, 1993). It implies that the gradual increase in the Na near the CCD is expected, while that of rapid increase is expected near the CHF. For a quantitative comparison, the Na near the CHF is generally expected as ∼106, while that of the present electrolysis system was measured much higher even in the relatively lower level of the CCD. The bubble departure diameter (Dd ) in the present electrolysis system decreased with the current density as shown in Fig. 6 . An asymptote of the Dd is 0.105 mm, which is much smaller than that of the typical boiling system. Fig. 7 shows hydrogen bubble configuration just before the CCD connoting the high Na and the small Dd near the cathode surface. The detailed analysis for the nucleation characteristics of the present electrolysis system is described in the authors’ previous work (Park and Chung, 2021)."
7,Model description,"3.2 Model description Ha and No (1998) envisaged the bubble behavior described in the dry spot model that the bubbles surrounding a single bubble restrict the liquid rewetting by forming a dry spot. More increase in the heat flux, the dry spot evolves to the dry area and when the surrounding bubbles exceed a certain critical number, the CHF is triggered. They estimated the critical number of bubbles as 5 in a water boiling system employing Poisson distribution of the Na . In the general hydrogen evolving system, the hydrogen bubble on the cathode surface forms the insulated spot acting as an electric resistance (Vogt, 2017), which plays similar role to the dry spot in the boiling system, which acts as the thermal resistance. Fig. 8 presents cell potential-current density (E-I) curve. The current density increased as the cell potential increased linearly. In this regime, the nucleate bubbles were observed as shown in the photographs (#1 and #2) just like the nucleate boiling regime. Further increase in the cell potential, the current density starts to deviate from the solid line, which is the extrapolated line of the nucleate bubble regime. The authors deduced that the retarded current density is due to the enlarged insulated spot as a result of bubble coalescence. The CCD was detected with decreasing slope of curve showing vigorous bubble coalescence as shown in the photograph #3. This regime is similar to the partial film boiling regime near the CHF in the boiling system. In this perspective, the authors postulated that the limitation of the current density, the CCD is due to the bubble coalescence at the cathode surface, which hinders the liquid to rewet similarly to the CHF. Subsequently, a stable hydrogen film is formed at the surface after the CCD as shown in the photograph #4 with sudden drop of the current density, just like the film boiling regime in the boiling system."
8,Consideration of bubble frequency,"3.3 Consideration of bubble frequency When Ha and No (1998) developed the dry spot model, the influence of f was ignored. Due to the rapid increase (concave shape) in the Na near the CHF, bubble coalescence could be described excluding the influence of the f. However, in the present electrolysis system, due to the gradual increase (convex shape) in the Na near the CCD, bubble coalescence resulting the formation of insulated area cannot be explained by the Na only. Thus, the f together with the Na determining the total, instant amount of bubbles contribute to the coalescence. In fact, for a realistic situation, the f should be considered (if it is dominant parameter) to realize the bubble coalescence phenomenon together with the Na . Based on the Na and the Dd , the bubble frequency (f) is calculated using Eq. (5) as shown in the Fig. 9 . The amount of electric charge of a single bubble, Qb is calculated using Faraday’s law and the volume of single bubble, Vb is based on the Dd . (5) f = I nb ″ N a Q b = I b Q b , where Q b = ρ n e F V b m . The f increased as the current density increased. This increase is essentially contributed by the linearly increasing I″ nb and slight increase in the Na ."
9,Assumptions and calculation model,"3.4 Assumptions and calculation model Consequently, the following assumptions were established to the insulated spot model by reflecting the nucleation characteristics of the present electrolysis system: (1) The distribution of the Na obeys the Poisson distribution. (2) The average bubble diameter (Dav ) can be substituted by the Dd . (3) The f together with the Na affects the CCD by increasing the probability of the surrounding bubble to take place. For an arbitrarily selected nucleation site, a shell area can be defined to estimate the number of surrounding bubbles using the Poisson distribution as shown in the Fig. 10 . Diameter of the shell area is 2Dav , since it is maximum coalescence distance to the single bubble from the selected nucleation site, which is identical notion to the dry spot model. The influence of f should be incorporated to estimate the probability of bubble existence within the shell area in the present electrolysis system. The bubble coalescence to form an insulated spot would occur during bubble growth time, tg . Hence, a time fraction within a bubble ebullition cycle, f*, which enables the bubble to coalesce can be expressed as (6) f ∗ = t g t g + t w = f t g . The increase in f decreases tw , which increases the probability of bubble coalescence since we assumed the constant tg . It is deduced that the evolution of insulated spot commences as the deviation of the current density from the solid line, which represents the convective mass transfer of the nucleate bubble regime. Therefore, the influence of the f* should be reflected to the current density range over the deviation point. The expected value, λ of the number of surrounding bubbles in the Poisson distribution due to the increased f* can be weighted using Eq. (7) and thus the λ is Naf/f 0. The f* 0 denotes the f at the deviation point. (7) f ∗ f 0 ∗ = f t g f 0 t g 0 f f 0 , ∵ t g t g 0 . Consequently, the probability of bubble existence in the shell area in the present electrolysis system can be expressed using the Poisson distribution as (8) P ( k ; λ ) = λ k e - λ k ! = ( N a A f / f 0 ) n e - N a A f / f 0 n ! . In turn, the probability of the number of surrounding bubbles, which is greater than or equal to the critical number, nc within the shell area is expressed as (9) P ( n ⩾ n c ) = 1 - ∑ n = 0 nc - 1 P ( n ) . Finally, the current density excluding the influence of surrounding bubbles greater than or equal to the nc is calculated using Eq. (10), same as Ha and No’s expression (Ha and No, 1998). (10) I ″ = I b N a ( 1 - P ( n ⩾ n c ) ) , where I b = I nb ″ N a ."
10,Results and discussion,"The E-I curves using Eq. (10) were plotted according to the nc as shown in the Fig. 11 . In case of the nc = 6 shows the best agreement with the experimental result. The calculated CCD is 7.4% higher. The plotted data over-predicts the cell potential range where the CCD is detected. The increase in the increasing rate of the Na would result in better agreement with the cell potential range at the CCD. Fig. 12 shows sensitivity of the Na to the plot in case of nc = 6. The measured current density curve lies in between ±20% varied curves in the Na. 20% increase in the Na in Eq. (10) results in better estimation of the cell potential and lower estimation of the current density for the CCD. However, it still plots the CCD point in an acceptable range with relative error of 10.6% to the measured CCD. Hence, the insulated spot model with critical number of bubbles of 6 well predicts the CCD, which enables to envisage the bubble configuration at the CCD. Fig. 13 shows the predicted bubble configuration at the CCD. A hexagonal packing structure is expected for an ideal situation when the nc is 6. The small and similar Dd in the present electrolysis system would realize this configuration. Meanwhile, the nc was 5 in water boiling system using the dry spot model. Both the dry spot and the insulated spot model are affected by the nucleation characteristics, which sensitively vary depending on the surface condition, temperature, working fluid, etc. The hexagonal packing structure at the CCD would prevent the liquid rewet as well as the bubble configuration of the dry spot model does. It implies that the CCD mechanism can be envisaged by the hydrodynamic behavior of the bubbles, similar to that of the CHF. However, the Dd of the present electrolysis system is much smaller than that of the boiling system and the size of bubble is similar. For a comprehensive comparison to the boiling system, it is concluded that the CCD could be regarded as a miniature CHF."
11,Conclusions,"The insulated spot model is proposed to envisage the CCD mechanism, which is a novel attempt modeling the CCD mechanism in the hydrogen evolving system. Basic notion of the model was borrowed from the existing dry spot model in the boiling system. The critical number of bubbles, which leads to the CCD is estimated applying the Poisson distribution of the active nucleation site density together with the nucleation characteristics of the diluted sulfuric acid electrolysis system; Bubble diameter, bubble frequency. The bubble frequency was considered as a parameter affecting the expected value of bubble interaction, which was ignored in the dry spot model because the f together with the Na determines the amount of available bubbles for coalescence. The critical number of bubbles is 6 in the diluted sulfuric acid electrolysis system. Hence, a hexagonal packing structure is expected for the bubble configuration at the CCD, while it was 5 at the CHF in the dry spot model. The configuration of the bubble at the CHF and the CCD seems not significantly different, except for the fact that much smaller bubble diameter and much more nucleation sites were observed in the diluted sulfuric acid electrolysis system. It is concluded that the CCD phenomenon is dominated by the hydrodynamic behavior and thus it can be regarded as a miniature CHF. The authors expect that the CHF and the CCD would link each other for better understanding of them based on this work."
