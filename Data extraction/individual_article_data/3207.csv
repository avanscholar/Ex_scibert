0,Introduction,"The selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CMA) to cinnamyl alcohol (CMO) is highly desirable from an industrial point of view because it is an important reaction in the production of pharmaceuticals and perfumes [1,2]. The hydrogenation of CMA can occur at either olefinic (CC) or carbonyl (CO) groups and the former results in formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCMA) [3,4], and the latter results in CMO [5,6]. However, thermodynamics favors the hydrogenation of CC over CO group and the kinetics of ethylenic double bond hydrogenation is faster than carbonyl group one [7,8], so the challenge is associated with the hydrogenation of the CO bond to the desired CMO [9,10]. To achieve high selectivity, great works have been made to develop new and efficient catalysts [9,11–13]. For example, S. Gyergyek et al. [14] reported a facile and replicable stepwise chemical method to synthesis magnetically separable Ru-base nanocatalysts, which improved catalytic activity and selectivity for the hydro-deoxygenation of bio-resource-related compound eugenol when compared to the commercial Ru/C. There have been many reports to discuss the mechanisms of functionalised aromatics’ hydrogenation by theoretic calculation methods [15,16]. Huš et al. [16] found that aromatic ring hydrogenation was found to be endothermic with the rate-determining step (RDS) barriers of approximately 1.0 eV and Methoxyl and hydroxyl were cleaved off differently depending on aromaticity. In general, supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance on the hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds to form CMO [17]. Xu et al. [18] reported galvanic displacement between SiO2-supported Fe particles and Pt2+ ions creats intimately interacting Pt-FeOx entities that are highly selective in catalyzing hydrogenation of the carbonyl in cinnamaldehyde, offering a cinnamyl alcohol yield up to 95%. However, from the point of view of process economics, it is always desirable to develop non-noble metal based catalysts. Gryglewicz et al. [19] reported that the herringbone and platelet carbon nanofibers and the activated carbon supported nickel catalysts showed high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation reactions. Recently, Shen and coworkers [20] also synthesized graphite-supported metal NPs encapsulated by mesoporous SiO2 layers, which showed enhanced the hydrogenation of the CO bond of CMA to unsaturated alcohol and the enhancement of selectivity are likely due to the geometric confinement effect. Hence, confining metal NPs in porous materials [21,22] or carbon nanotubes [23,24] has proven to be an alternative approach for the design of a novel class of heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced activity and stability. However, arriving at non-noble metal based catalysts with maximum activity and selectivity remains a challenge. In this paper, we reported a facile and innovative strategy to synthesize Ni NPs confined within SiO2 networks with interparticle mesopores (Ni/SiO2-IS) through in situ method with a combination of azeotropic distillation process and solvothermal method. For comparing, Ni/SiO2 was also synthesized through traditional impregnation method, marked as Ni/SiO2-IM. The textural properties of Ni/SiO2-IS catalyst were characterized by XRD, TEM, and BET. The catalytic performance of Ni/SiO2-IS and Ni/SiO2-IM for hydrogenation of CMA were investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation As shown in Scheme 1 , firstly, 0.37 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.6 g glucose, 1 g cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and 5 mL deionized water were added into benzene solution (80 mL), forming a reverse microemulsion (water in oil). The mixture was stirred for 3 h at 70 °C to hydrolyze Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. Then this microemulsion was treated by an azeotropic distillation process at 100 °C for removing water. The solution was transferred to the autoclave to be thermally treated at 180 °C for 1 h. After washing and drying, carbon coated NiO NPs were obtained. Secondly, carbon coated NiO NPs were mixed into the precursor of Silica sol. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for several hours and then transferred to the autoclave to be thermally treated at 180 °C for 12 h. After washing, drying, and calcining at 550 °C for 6 h for removing carbon, finally the product was obtained after reduced at 7% H2/Ar."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D/MAX 2500/PC powder diffractometer (Rigaku) using a CuKα radiation source operated at 40 kV and 200 mA from 5° to 80° (in 2 θ) with the scanning rate of 10° min−1. Transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100) was applied for the detailed microstructure and morphology information. The surface area and the pore size distributions were measured by the surface area and pore size analyzer (Autosorb-iQ2-MP)."
4,Catalytic performance measurements,"2.3 Catalytic performance measurements Selective hydrogenation of CMA was conducted in a stainless steel autoclave (50 mL). Typically, the reaction mixture contained 1.0 mL CMA, 20 mL ethanol (solvent) and 100 mg Ni/SiO2-IS (or Ni/SiO2-IM) catalyst. During the hydrogenation, catalysts were suspended in solution by violent stirring. The reaction was performed at 110 °C for a certain period (0.5–3 h) under 2.0 MPa H2 pressure. The reaction progress was monitored by taking approximate 0.50 mL samples at different time intervals for quantitative analysis by Haixin GC-950 gas chromatography (HP-5 capillary column)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure of catalysts,"3.1 Structure of catalysts Fig. 1 showed that XRD patterns of Ni/SiO2-IS sample were presented with diffraction angles (2 θ) between 5° and 80°. One broad diffraction peak at about 21.6° was appeared, which can be assigned to amorphous silica and identical with those reported in literature [25]. And several clear peaks at 2 θ = 44.5°, 51.8°, and 46.6° were detected, which can be indexed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of metallic nickel (JCPDS 27-0605). This result implied that metal Ni NPs were successfully dispersed on SiO2. According to the Scherrer equation, the particle size of nickel was calculated from the peak at 2 θ = 44.5° and the nickel particle size estimated for Ni/SiO2-IS catalysts was about 9 nm. TEM images of Ni/SiO2-IS and Ni/SiO2-IM samples were shown in Fig. 2 . An overview image at low magnification illustrates that the product was almost exclusively composed of well dispersed Ni NPs confined into a mesoporous network SiO2 (Fig. 2a). Although it is rather difficult to observe the grain boundaries clearly, it can be found that the particles are quite uniform in size and shape. As shown as Fig. 2b, the average size of Ni NPs was about 9 nm and Ni NPs presented a spherical shape, which was in accordance with the XRD results. In addition, it can be clearly seen that the small Ni NPs were uniformly dispersed inside pores without obvious aggregation. These results indicated that Ni NPs were successfully confined within SiO2 networks with interparticle mesopores via our method. Comparing with Ni/SiO2-IS sample, Ni/SiO2-IM sample prepared by traditional impregnation method showed an irregular pore system and only large metallic particles (Fig. 2c and d). Ni particles had obvious aggregation and average size of Ni NPs was about 20 nm. The Nitrogen sorption isotherms and pore size distribution of Ni/SiO2-IS catalysts were shown in Fig. 3 . The Ni/SiO2-IS sample showed a type–III curves and a H3 hysteresis loop at a high relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.8–1.0 according to the IUPAC classification, indicating the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm) with narrow slit-shaped. The corresponding pore size distributions method were broad, peaking at 5–60 nm, which consist of smaller fine (4–10 nm) intra-particle pores and larger (20–60 nm) inter-particle pores. The formation of larger interparticle mesopores (20–60 nm) can be due to the accumulation of the SiO2 nanospheres. And the results were also consistent with the TEM results."
7,CMA hydrogenation,"3.2 CMA hydrogenation The time-dependent results of the CMA conversion and selectivity to products over the Ni/SiO2-IS and Ni/SiO2-IM catalyst were shown in Fig. 4 . Under the same reaction conditions, the Ni/SiO2-IS exhibited faster conversion rate of CMA than the Ni/SiO2-IM: it took 1.5 and 10 h to achieve a conversion of 100% for the Ni/SiO2-IS and Ni/SiO2-IM, respectively. Moreover, compared with the Ni/SiO2-IM, A selectivity to CMO of 65% was achieved at total conversion (>99%) (Fig. 4a). However, Ni/SiO2-IM catalysts showed nearly zero selectivity for CO, which was also consistent with the previous reports [19,26,27] (Fig. 4b). These results clearly showed the superiority of Ni/SiO2-IS over the Ni/SiO2-IM in terms of catalytic activity. The enhanced activity and significant CMO selectivity was observed in Ni/SiO2-IS catalyst, which can be attributed to Ni-support interaction and confinement effect of SiO2 on the entrapped Ni NPs."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, we have developed a general strategy for the facile preparation of Ni NPs confined within SiO2 networks with interparticle mesopores (Ni/SiO2-IS) by an in situ method with a combination of azeotropic distillation assisted and solvothermal methods. The average size of Ni NPs was about 9 nm and Ni NPs presented a spherical shape and were uniformly dispersed inside pores without obvious aggregation, indicating that Ni NPs were successfully confined within SiO2 networks with interparticle mesopores via this process. The special structure enhanced obviously CMO selectivity in hydrogenation of CMA comparing with Ni/SiO2-IM catalysts prepared by traditional impregnation method with nearly zero selectivity for CMO, which can be due to confinement of metals in pores and were inaccessible to reactant molecules. The synthetic strategy can also be extended to other confinement catalyst system for various selective catalytic reactions."
