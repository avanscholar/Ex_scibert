0,Introduction,"Alcohol oxidase (AOX) is a homooctameric flavoprotein with a molecular weight of 600–675 kDa produced by methylotrophic microorganisms (Couderc and Baratti, 1980). Alcohol oxidase catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols to their corresponding aldehyde or ketone in the presence of oxygen. (1) (2) Aldehydes that can serve as precursors of fine chemicals or flavor compounds that can be labeled as “natural” can be produced by AOX if using substrates of natural origin. For example, whole cells of the yeast Pichia pastoris containing AOX oxidized endogenous alcohols in orange water-phase essence (water-soluble essence recovered from the first stage of an orange juice evaporator) to produce acetaldehyde, propanal, and octanal. These aldehydes improved the sensory attributes of the orange water-phase essence (Goodrich et al., 1998). The important almond-associated flavor, benzaldehyde, can also be produced by AOX through the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Duff and Murray, 1989; Fujii and Tonomura, 1972). Glycolaldehyde is used to synthesize serine, tryptophan, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals (Ukeda et al., 1998). Glycolaldehyde has been produced from ethylene glycol by AOX with higher conversion yields and selectivity than with chemical methods (Isobe and Nishise, 1995). Other compounds that can be produced by AOX include glyoxal, hexanal, octanal, 3-phenylpropanal, and phenyl acetaldehyde (Isobe and Nishise, 1995; Murray and Duff, 1990). In addition to synthesis applications, AOX has found applications in alcohol analysis and in the fabrication of biosensors with potential applications in foods (Azevedo et al., 2004). However, the poor stability of AOX has limited its practical application in biosensors, food processing, and other industries (Lopez-Gallego et al., 2007). P. pastoris produces two isozymes AOX1 and AOX2 that are highly homologous (Cregg et al., 1989) with AOX1 expressed more abundantly than AOX2 whose evolutionary role remains unclear. The stability of AOX in the presence of chemical denaturants has been documented (Evers et al., 1995), as well as the thermal stability of AOX from Hansenula polymorpha (Azevedo et al., 2004). To our knowledge, however, there is limited characterization on the thermal stability of AOX form Pichia pastoris, aside the study by Lopez-Gallego et al. (2007) at 37 or 45 °C. Used as a non-thermal processing technology to kill harmful microorganisms and inactivate deleterious enzymes, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing has been successfully used in the food processing industry (Balasubramaniam et al., 2015; Rastogi et al., 2007). High hydrostatic pressure has increased the stability and activity of numerous enzymes (Eisenmenger and Reyes-De-Corcuera, 2009b). However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of HHP on the stability of AOX has not been reported. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine an optimal HHP that maximizes the stability of AOX at selected temperatures."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Alcohol oxidase from Pichia pastoris (Product Number A2404-1KU) and peroxidase from horseradish (POD, Product Number P825025KU), were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). For the purpose of validation of kinetic parameters, AOX from Pichia pastoris (Product Number 0219015505) was purchased from MP Biochemicals, (Solon, OH, USA). Methanol (99.9%) and potassium phosphate monobasic were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ, USA). 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, 98%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). Silicone oil ‘Sil 180’ used as pressurization fluid was obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA)."
3,Equipment,"2.2 Equipment 2.2.1 High hydrostatic pressure processing equipment The HHP system used for the determination of stability and activity of AOX is described elsewhere (Halalipour et al., 2017b). 2.2.2 Analytical instruments A microplate reader model Synergy™ HTX Multi-Mode with a xenon flash lamp and monochromator at 405 nm and Gen 5 data analysis software both from BioTek (VT, USA) monitored absorbance change over time to determine residual AOX activity after HHP treatments at selected temperatures."
4,Methods,"2.3 Methods 2.3.1 Effect of high hydrostatic pressure on the thermal stability of AOX Low-density polyethylene storage bags were cut and heat-sealed into 2 cm × 2 cm pouches. For each treatment, a 100-μL aliquot of AOX at 0.5 or 1.5 unit mL−1 solution in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 was pipetted into one of the plastic pouches, heat-sealed, and submerged in the HHP reactor at 10 °C. Silicone oil was added to fill the reactor and then the reactor was closed. Pressurization of the reactor was then initiated. Once the set point pressure was reached, the temperature was increased by switching to the second water bath previously set to the desired temperature. Process time begun once the temperature reached 95% of the temperature set point. Fig. 1 illustrates the pressure and temperature profile for a sample treated at 59.1 °C at 200 MPa for 0 min (closed symbols) or 10 min (open symbols). To determine 100% residual activity for a process time of 0 min, immediately after 95% of the difference between the set point temperature and the initial temperature of 5 °C was reached, the reactor was cooled to 15 °C by switching to the cold water bath. Immediately after reaching 15 °C, depressurization of the reactor was initiated as cooling continued to 10 °C. The sample was recovered from the reactor, placed on ice within 10 s, and analyzed for activity within 30 min. Four evenly spaced treatment times were selected for each temperature to produce an approximate 80% reduction of the residual activity after the longest process time for each pressure-temperature combination. The thermal stability of AOX was expressed as the pseudo first-order rate constant of inactivation (k inact ) calculated using linear regression. Experimental error in the calculation of k inact was determined utilizing the standard error of the linear regression. As indicators of the quality of the regression fit, R 2 values were used. After a preliminary study at 0.1 MPa at 45 or 50 °C, treatments were set from 0.1 MPa (control) to 200 MPa at 40 MPa increments at 49.4, 52.6, 55.8 or 59.1 °C. The temperature range was selected to allow observation of approximately 80% decrease in enzyme activity at atmospheric pressure in less than one hour for the coldest temperature, as well as to be able to record enzyme residual activity after the come-up and come-down transients, at least at the pressure that resulted in highest enzyme stability. A randomized block design with temperatures treated as random blocks was used. Pressure-time combinations for each temperature block were randomly selected and each treatment was done in duplicate. A linearized Arrhenius equation was used to calculate the activation energy at each pressure. A linearized Eyring equation was used to calculate the activation volume of AOX at each temperature. Error estimates for activation energies and activation volumes were reported as the standard error derived from the slopes of Arrhenius or Eyring plots respectively. To validate the kinetic parameters determined in this study, the residual activity for processing time 0 relative to fresh enzyme was calculated using by determining the rate constant of inactivation of the enzyme at each of the transient temperatures (temperature data was collected every 2 s) at constant pressure for selected experimental conditions. As a conservative approach, we used AOX lot from Sigma different from the lot used for the determination of the kinetic parameters. We also ran a second independent experiment using AOX from P. pastoris from a second supplier (MP Biochemicals) where we determined residual activity at selected incubation times at 55.8 °C. Validation experiments were done in triplicate and reported errors represent plus or minus one standard deviation from mean. 2.3.2 Enzyme activity assay A coupled enzyme assay measured the activity of AOX spectrophotometrically at 25 °C as described elsewhere (Janssen and Ruelius, 1968; Keesey, 1987) and adapted for microplate reader. Briefly, the change in absorbance was recorded immediately after a 10-μL aliquot of the treated AOX sample was added and mixed to the reaction mixture containing 160 μL of 3.125 mM ABTS, 40 μL of 312.5 mM methanol and 40 μL of 4.5 unit mL−1 of POD. The ABTS and methanol were automatically added by an auto-injector coupled to the microplate reader, while the POD and AOX were manually pipetted into four wells per sample. Methanol and POD solutions were prepared with ultrapure water. Solutions of ABTS or AOX were prepared in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. When not in use, all reagents were stored at 4 °C and enzymes were held on ice during the experiments."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of high hydrostatic pressure on the thermal stability of AOX,"3.1 Effect of high hydrostatic pressure on the thermal stability of AOX 3.1.1 Rates of inactivation Plots of the logarithm of residual activity vs. treatment time (Fig. 2 ) revealed a large dispersion of data from replicates due to the variability in the positioning the flexible pouches inside the high pressure reactor. For example, when switching from the cold bath to the incubation bath, heat transfer from the jacket to the reactor with the pouch is not instantaneous. If the pouch is closer to the wall of the reactor it heats faster than if the pouch is near the center of the reactor. Also, variability is attributed to the variability in the heating and cooling cycles of the system which is of approximately 30 s. However, the randomization of treatment times and temperature blocks properly accounted for and distributed the error normally. All data derived from pseudo-order diagrams were also of this nature. Pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models were initially used since they have fitted well to all the other enzymes we and others have studied (Eisenmenger and Reyes-De-Corcuera, 2009a; Halalipour et al., 2017a; Halalipour et al., 2017b; Tomlin et al., 2013). At 45 °C, first or second-order models resulted in similar fits (R2 = 0.72) while at 50 °C the first-order model resulted in a better fit than the second-order model. However, the first order plots (Fig. 2) show that the process is not truly first-order because there is an obvious leveling off at the longer treatments, indicating an apparent order greater than one. P. pastoris produces two isozymes, AOX1 and AOX2 with AOX1 contributing the most to the total activity. Indeed, a mutant with AOX1 genes disrupted produced only on third of the activity of the wildtype (Cregg et al., 1989). Two pseudo-first-order models (biphasic models) have been commonly used, for example for isozymes with sufficiently different pseudo-first orders of inactivation (Adams, 1991) such as pectinmethylesterase from orange (Chen and Wu, 1998) or polyphenol oxidase from apple, pear, or strawberry (Sulaiman et al., 2015). Fig. 2 reveals that there are two apparent linear regions with the second being more dominant when residual activity is less than about one third of the initial activity. Accordingly, these equations describe the situation: A O X 1 → k L A O X 1 i n a c t i v e A O X 2 → k R A O X 2 i n a c t i v e where k L and k R are the pseudo-first-order rate constants of inactivation for what we designate as labile (L) and resistant (R) fractions respectively. At 50 °C, the regression of the first region had a better fit (R2 = 0.76) than the single-region pseudo-first-order model. However, the fit for the resistant region is poorer not only because there are fewer points but because the rate of inactivation decreased (Table 1 ). Similarly the fit, as assessed by R2 at 45 °C for the two linear regions was very poor, especially for the resistant fraction, but that is because the rate of inactivation was small at that temperature and because insufficient inactivation occurred in the R region to have one isozyme dominate the kinetics of inactivation of the other. Therefore, the lack of fit at 45 °C does not negate the validity of a two region model accounting for two isozymes. Based on this, we decided to use higher temperatures for the rest of the experiments. A two-step model was proposed for the thermal inactivation AOX from Hansenula polymorpha (Azevedo et al., 2004). However, for the model to fit, the authors reported that the fraction of one of the form of the enzymes was less than 0.1% of the total, which makes its contribution to the model marginal even though the R2 of the two-step model was 0.977 vs 0.968 for the one-step, first-order model. Furthermore, only one AOX produced by H. polymorpha has been reported (Ito et al., 2007) suggesting that the inactivation really follows pseudo-first-order. To further verify that there were two isozymes, we attempted separation by native gel electrophoresis however, because the AOX isozymes only differ in molecular weight by 432 Da and have practically identical pI values, separation was not possible. The amino-acid sequences of the two isozymes differ by only 18 amino acids with Leucine 493 of AOX1 replaced by a hydrophobic Tyrosine in AOX2. Because these residues, are not near the surface of the protein, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they contribute making AOX2 is more stable by increasing hydrophobicity decreasing the flexibility as temperature increases as explained by Russell and Taylor (1995). The low activity displayed in the resistant region of the plot is in agreement with the report that AOX2 is much less abundant than AOX1 (Cregg et al., 1989). From Fig. 2, at 50 °C, the rate of inactivation was approximately 4 times smaller for the labile fraction than for the resistant fraction and its abundance about one third, therefore, its contribution to the decrease in activity was less than on tenth, thus negligible. Similarly, a long incubation times, the contribution of the labile fraction becomes negligible. Therefore, for the remainder of this study, the two regions were investigated individually and fitted to pseudo-first-order rates of inactivation. Confirmation of the two isozymes would require producing mutants with knocked down genes for each isozyme, beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, instead of referring to AOX1 or AOX2 we will refer to the labile and resistant factions. To study the resistant fraction, it was necessary to first inactivate most (∼80–90%) of the labile fraction at atmospheric pressure. Also, greater concentrations were required to achieve acceptable sensitivity for the residual activity assay and longer process times in the case of the R fraction. Pseudo-first-order rate constants of inactivation of AOX inactivation are summarized on Table 2 . HHP stabilized both fractions up to 160 MPa at all studied temperatures. At 200 MPa, k inact increased or was not different than 160 MPa. At low pressures and high temperatures, the residual activity after pressurization-heating-cooling-depressurization transients was too low to allow determination of k inact . However, at higher pressures greater residual activity after transient phases allowed calculating k inact and we conclude that HHP stabilized the enzyme at these temperatures as well. For the labile fraction L, the greatest relative stabilization was at 49.4 °C and where k inact was 14 times smaller at 160 MPa than at 0.1 MPa. Relative to 40 MPa where we could obtain experimental results at most temperatures, the stabilization factor was 3.3, 1.7, and 1 at 49.7, 52.6, and 55.8 °C respectively for the L fraction and 1.5, 1.3, and 2.2 for the R fraction. These increases in stability are smaller than the ones we determined for glucose oxidase (up to 50-fold) (Halalipour et al., 2017b) but of the same order as for xanthine oxidase (up to 9.5-fold) (Halalipour et al., 2017a). The pressure-induced stabilization at 59.1 °C was not quantified because the thermal degradation of the enzyme below 120 MPa was too fast. No differences in stability were detected at 120–200 MPa. For the R fraction, HHP stabilized AOX at 49.4–59.1 °C. For the resistant fraction R, the pressure-induced stabilization was small relative to what was observed for the L fraction with a maximal decrease in k inact of 3-fold relative to the extrapolated values at 0.1 MPa at 49.4 or at 55.8 °C. The residual activity for the R fraction, was normalized to 100% after a process time of four minutes under pressure-temperature conditions that resulted in complete inactivation of the L fraction and facilitating the comparison between the two fractions. The stability of the R fraction, k inact was between 4 (at 49.4 °C and 80 MPa) and 34 (at 55.8 °C and 80 MPa) times smaller than for the L fraction under the same temperature and pressure conditions. Although the use of these ratios is subject to compounding errors, they provide an order-of-magnitude understanding of the differences in stability of the two fractions under the selected experimental conditions. The 3-fold increase in AOX concentration, from 0.5 unit mL−1 (0.02 mg mL−1) for the L fraction to 1.5 unit mL−1 (0.06 mg mL−1) for the R fraction, was assumed not to have a great impact on the stability against thermal inactivation. This agrees with Azevedo et al. (2004) who reported that a 10-fold increase in AOX concentration (0.025–0.25 mg mL−1) did not impact the rate of thermal inactivation. In contrast, Lopez-Gallego et al. (2007) reported that a 10-fold increase in AOX concentration (0.01–0.1 mg mL−1) increased the stability to thermal inactivation, proposing a dissociation of the subunits as an initial step of inactivation. Dalmadi et al. (2006) described polyphenol oxidase (PPO) from strawberries (Fragaria ananassa), a tetrameric enzyme, to have thermolabile and thermoresistant fractions. At 60 °C, the rate of inactivation for the stable fraction decreased 13.8-fold from 0.1 MPa as compared to 200 MPa. Similarly, polyphenoloxidase from avocado was stabilized at temperatures greater than 62.5 °C and pressures lower than 250 MPa (Weemaes et al., 1998). A 16.6-fold stabilization occurred at 72.5 °C at 250 MPa as compared to 0.1 MPa. The PPO from avocado was not described to have two fractions with different stabilities. Multiple mechanisms are thought to contribute to pressure-induced stabilization of enzymes against thermal inactivation. Mozhaev et al. (1996) explained the antagonistic effect of pressure and temperature in terms of entropy, where temperature increases entropy, while increase in pressure decreases entropy. Furthermore, HHP increases the hydration of the charged and non-polar groups of an enzyme, hampering water loss, which has been hypothesized as an initial step of thermal inactivation as a result of high temperature (Balny et al., 2002; Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2002). Additionally, heat disrupts hydrogen bonds, while HHP has been thought to enhance and promote formation of hydrogen bonds (Kunugi, 1992). 3.1.2 Activation energy of inactivation Fig. 3 a and b illustrate the linearized Arrhenius plots for the L and R fractions respectively and Table 3 reports the calculated Eai for both fractions for 40–200 MPa at 40 MPa increments. For the labile fraction, data collected at 59.1 °C were not included in the calculation of the activation energy. Fig. 3a reveals that, at that temperature, the rate of inactivation is smaller than that of the previous temperature for all pressures. This deviation from the linear trend was caused by the partial inactivation during the come up and come down transient. As incubation time increases, the L fraction is inactivated and the fraction R begins to become dominant, resulting in an apparent decrease in the rate of inactivation of fraction L. In contrast, Fig. 3b is consistent with Arrhenius behavior throughout the entire range of temperatures. For the L fraction, there were no significant differences in Eai with mean values ranging from 389 to 402 kJ mol−1 at 80–160 MPa. However, the Eai was smaller at 40 or 200 MPa. Although between 80 and 160 MPa pressure is stabilizing the enzyme, it also exacerbates the effect of temperature on the rate of inactivation. For the R fraction, Eai ranged from 71 to 184 kJ mol−1 approximately half of the labile fraction with smaller values at 80 and 200 MPa. From the four temperatures studied in this research only three were useful for the calculation of Eai. Quantitative results are not sufficiently robust but provide a good order of magnitude approximation. Also, these results complement those by Lopez-Gallego et al. (2007) at 37 °C or 45 °C, at atmospheric pressure, pH 7. In our recent reports, the inactivation of GOX and XOX had Eai of 281–378 kJ mol−1 for pressures between 0.1 and 300 MPa (Halalipour et al., 2017b) and 97.0–182 kJ mol−1 at the same pressure range were of the same order of magnitude (Halalipour et al., 2017a) respectively. The similarity in Eai of inactivation despite the different size and structure (AOx is a 675-kDa octomer, XOx is a 283-kDa dimer and GOx is a 160-kDa dimer) contrasts with the different temperatures at which they begin to lose activity and highlights the differences in kinetic and thermodynamic stability. However, unlike GOX and XOX whose Eai decreased with the increase in pressure, for the L fraction of AOX, there was a mild increase in Eai between 40 and 160 MPa and for the R fraction, there was no difference except for 80 MPa. Lower Eai at 200 MPa are probably due to pressure becoming a denaturing factor. The residual activity after a processing time of 0 s, i.e. accounting for the temperature transients as the selected pressures was calculated and compared to experimental determinations. To validate the pseudo-first order rate constants determined in this study, theoretical rate constants were derived from Arrhenius linear regression for the average temperature collected every 2 s, for both, the labile and the resistant factions. Residual activity was calculated at each point in time and the compounded throughout the heating transients at 40–160 MPa and compared to the experimental residual activity. At 49.4 °C the mean absolute value of the difference of experimental and calculated residual activity was 1, 4, 11 and 6% for 40, 80, 120, and 160 MPa respectively. This good agreement is not surprising because at that temperature, activity loss is rather slow. Activity slightly greater than 100% relative to the fresh enzyme was observed at this temperature but not others, at 80 and 120 MPa, suggesting that these moderate pressures increase enzyme activity. This may be due to partial irreversible exposure of the active site of the enzyme to the substrate. That effect is no longer observed at 160 MPa because at that level pressure begins to become a denaturing factor. That increase is not detected at any other higher temperature because of thermal denaturation. Enzyme activation has been reported for example for polyphenol oxidase from apple and pear (Buckow et al., 2009; Sulaiman et al., 2015). At 52.6 °C the mean absolute value of the difference of experimental and calculated residual activity was 15.8%, 15.7%, 15.2%, or 20.7% at 40 MPa, 80 MPa, 120 MPa, or 160 MPa respectively. At 55.8 °C the mean absolute value of the difference of experimental and calculated residual activity was 21%, 2%, 0.1%, or 1% at 40 MPa, 80 MPa, 120 MPa, or 160 MPa respectively. The residual AOX activity from the second supplier after incubation at 55.8 °C and 80 MPa for 30 s, 60 s, or 90 s were 92.5% ± 5.2%, 88.4% ± 3.7% or 76.1% ± 5.5% respectively which contrasts with 66.3% ± 1.4%, 60.4% ± 2.8%, or 48.1% ± 2.7% of the second lot form the first supplier. 82.0%, 68.3% or, 57.9% calculated from the kinetic parameters of inactivation. Deviations of the experimental results of residual activity ranged from 7.9% to 20.1% which is similar to the deviations obtained from experiments and calculations using the heating and cooling transients. Experimental residual activity for the enzyme from the second supplier was consistently greater that the predictions while experimental results from the second lot from the first supplier were consistently smaller than the predicted values indicating that there is a large lot-to-lot variability and supplier-to-supplier variability. 3.1.3 Activation volume of inactivation As pressure increased, the rate of inactivation decreased up to 120 or 160 MPa as shown in Fig. 4 a and b. The apparent ΔV≠ was calculated from the slopes of Eyring plots between 40 and 120 MPa for all temperatures for the R fraction and for temperatures of 52.6 °C and below and between 80 and 160 for the L fraction for 55.8 °C (see Table 4 ). Rates of inactivation for the L fraction at 0.1 MPa–80 MPa were unreliable because residual activity relative to fresh enzyme was below 36% indicating that the R fraction started to contribute to the rate of inactivation. The data for 160 MPa and above were excluded from most ΔV≠ calculations because at that pressure and above, pressure is no longer stabilizing and becomes inactivating. Also, for the L fraction at high temperatures, after the pressure-temperature come-up and the come-down transient, the residual activity was very low and actually reflected the transition to the R fraction which biased the results. Here as well, because only three points were used to determine linear regression parameters, correlation is not very robust as indicated by low R2 values but gives an order of magnitude approximation. The activation volume of the L and R fractions was approximately 20 cm3 mol−1 and not significantly different between the two fractions for all temperatures, indicating that temperature does not affect the stabilizing effect of pressure on AOX stability for pressures between 40 and 160 MPa. Boonyaratanakornkit et al. (2002) described how specific molecular interactions at HHP for each enzyme determine the magnitude and sign of ΔV≠. However, these interactions, such as electrostriction of charged and polar groups and the solvation of hydrophobic groups, are often difficult to pinpoint. Positive ΔV≠ values, 13.7 and 33.7 cm3 mol−1, were observed during thermostabilization of a pectinase cocktail from Aspergillus niger with pressures up to 250 MPa and temperature range of 55–85 °C (Tomlin et al., 2013). The ΔV≠ had a general increase up to 77 °C where the highest ΔV≠ occurred. A decrease in ΔV≠ at 85 °C indicated pressure having less of an effect on thermostability."
7,Conclusions,"During AOX thermal inactivation (49.4 °C–59.1 °C) at atmospheric and HHP, two pseudo-first order rates of inactivation were observed. The two regions suggest that the two isozymes produced by P. pastoris have different thermal stabilities. Most high pressure treatments of 40–160 MPa stabilized both fractions, with the slowest rates of inactivation generally occurring between 120 MPa and 200 MPa. Destabilization by pressure occurred at pressures above 160 MPa. The rate of inactivation of the thermally resistant fraction of AOX under HHP was at least ten-fold smaller than the labile fraction at atmospheric pressure. Variability among enzyme lots from either the same supplier or from different suppliers causes deviations of up to 20% in residual activity compared to values predicted using the proposed kinetic parameters. For industrial applications, although high pressure stabilized AOX, the level of stabilization was small compared for example to glucose oxidase or lipase. Therefore, it is unlikely that the enzyme will be applied in solution at HHP. Its recovery will be necessary, which will require immobilization in a solid support. Furthermore, these results need to be complemented by kinetic studies of AOX mutants that express individually each of the isozymes to confirm whether the stability of each fraction corresponds indeed to each isozyme and to validate the effect of HHP on each isozyme, thus the potential of HHP to contribute enable the industrial use of this enzyme."
