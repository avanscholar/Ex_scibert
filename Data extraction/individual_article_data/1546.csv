0,Introduction,"Tandem catalysis that enables multistep reactions in one pot has attracted great attention because it avoids time-consuming, tedious intermediate separation processes, energy consumption, and waste of production [1,2]. Tandem reactions are widely used in various organic transformations [3], especially the production of secondary amines, because secondary amines and their derivatives are extremely important intermediates for synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and polymers [2–5]. An attractive route for synthesis of secondary amines is the tandem alkylation of amines in one pot with an alcohol as the alkylating agent [6–8]. Many heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the alkylation of amines with alcohols, such as CuMo/TiO2 [9], Pd-ligand [10], Pd/MgO [11], IrZr MOFs [12], Pd/C [13], and Ru(OH) x /Al2O3 [14]. However, as typical anilines precursors, the synthesis of secondary amines from nitroarenes still faces great challenges. Very recently, PdAg@MIL-101 [15], Au/TiO2, Pd/TiO2, and Pt/TiO2 [16] have been used as catalysts for the tandem alkylation of amines from nitroarenes. But most of these catalyses were used under hydrogen or at elevated temperature. Therefore, an efficient catalyst is needed for the synthesis of secondary amines from nitroarenes with alcohols in one-pot multistep reactions under mild conditions. This is desirable for green chemistry. The hydrogenation of nitroarenes to primary amines is the challenging step in such a one- pot multistep reaction under mild conditions. Several reductive methods have been developed to hydrogenate nitroarenes to amines, such as photocatalysis [17] and electrolytic reduction [18]. Photocatalysis has been widely used in the hydrogenation of nitroarenes. In our previous studies, we have developed a series of photocatalysts for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and its derivatives to corresponding anilines in water at room temperature and under 1 atm N2 [19]. In these photocatalytic systems, (NH4)2C2O4 or HCOONH4 was added as a hole scavenger to generate the hydrogen for the reaction. If the photogenerated holes can be consumed by alcohols, producing the corresponding aldehydes, the produced anilines and aldehydes may react to form the secondary amines or imines. How can an appropriate photocatalyst with the strong redox capacities be rationally designed to catalyze coupled alcohol oxidation and nitroarene reduction in such a one-pot multistep reaction? Recently, Higashimoto and co-workers reported the photosynthesis of imines from benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene in one pot over TiO2-based materials [20]. This would provide the possibility of photoalkylation of nitroarenes with benzyl alcohols to produce secondary amines. It is reported that the Lewis acid sites in the catalyst can facilitate the reaction between the formed aldehyde and the primary amine to form a secondary amine [20,21]. Furthermore, the Lewis acid sites have been proved to promote the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde [22]. Thus, efficiently exposed Lewis acid sites could be considered in the design of catalysts. Recently, we prepared nanosheets of the lepidocrocite-type monolayer H1.07Ti1.73O4·H2O (Ti-NS). Ti-NS, with a band gap of 3.4 eV, shows ae strong redox capacity. The valence (VB) and conduction (CB) band of Ti-NS are about −0.88 and 2.42 eV vs. NHE respectively [23]. Moreover, Ti-NS possesses abundant surface Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, resulting in the highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone with the assistance of Pd [24]. Therefore, suitable band structure and abundant surface acid sites make Ti-NS a promising candidate for photocatalysis of the synthesis of secondary amines from nitroarenes with alcohols. Based on this, we developed Pd/H1.07Ti1.73O4·H2O (Pd/Ti-NS) as a photocatalyst for the photo-alkylation of nitroarenes with benzyl alcohol in one pot at room temperature and under 1 atm N2 (Scheme 1 ). High conversion of nitroarenes (99%) and selectivity of secondary amines (85%) were achieved over the Pd/NS photocatalyst. Influences on photocatalytic activity have been discussed in detail on in relation to structures, morphologies, superficial properties, and optical properties through XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, and UV-DRS characterization. The coordination behavior of reagent molecules on superficial Lewis and Brønsted acid sites of catalysts has been revealed by in situ FTIR, in situ ESR, and N2 adsorption techniques. Furthermore, interfacial electron transfer from reagent molecules to catalysts via surface coordination was also elucidated by UV-DRS, in situ FTIR, and in situ ESR. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed on a molecular level, which is distinct from that of classic catalysis. This work not only highlights the photocatalytic synthesis of secondary amines from nitroarenes and alcohols, but also may spark the design and construction of efficient photocatalysts for organic synthesis in industry."

3,Preparation of layered H1.07Ti1.73O4·H2O (Ti-L) and H1.07Ti1.73O4·H2O nanosheets (Ti-NS),"2.2 Preparation of layered H1.07Ti1.73O4·H2O (Ti-L) and H1.07Ti1.73O4·H2O nanosheets (Ti-NS) The preparation of Ti-L and Ti-NS was carried out via a high temperature solid state reaction [23,24]. The Ti-L was synthesized by the proton exchange process from K0.8Ti1.73Li0.27O4. The Ti-NS was obtained through the intercalation and exfoliation process with TBAOH as the intercalation agent. A mole ratio of Ti-L and TBAOH of 1:1.2 was stirred for more than 4 days at ambient temperature. A white Ti-NS colloidal solution was obtained. Next, 1 M HCl solution was added to the colloidal solution for the flocculation of Ti-NS, followed by centrifugal separation and washing with deionized water. After a drying process at 60 °C, the white powder of Ti-NS was successfully prepared."
4,Preparation of Pd/Ti-NS,"2.3 Preparation of Pd/Ti-NS The metal particles loaded on the surfaces of samples were prepared through photodeposition. An aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2·2H2O (10 mg/mL) was injected into a colloidal solution of Ti-NS, and 5 mL methanol was added as a sacrificial agent. After being strongly stirred for 30 min with N2 as protective atmosphere, the suspensions were irradiated with a Xenon lamp for 4 h. For comparison, the mixed suspensions were irradiated 6 h to obtain a different size of Pd nanoparticles. The products were collected and washed with water several times, and then dried at 60 °C for further characterization and use."
5,Materials characterization,"2.4 Materials characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were obtained for the dry-pressed disk samples using a Cary 500 Scan UV–vis spectrophotometer (Varian). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the samples were measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K on an Autosorb-1C-TCD physical adsorption instrument (American Quantachrome) using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 system. Before being analyzed, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 180 °C for 10 h. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1010 electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained using an FEI Quanta 200F electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was measured on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) at 3.0 × 10−10 mbar with monochromatic AlKα Radiation (E = 1486.2 eV). A tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Aglient 5500) with Si-tip cantilever was used to evaluate the morphology of the prepared nanosheets on the mica substrate. A 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Trustech, PLS-SXE300c) was used as a light source."
6,Simulated in situ FTIR measurement,"2.5 Simulated in situ FTIR measurement The in situ FTIR spectra of nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol adsorbed onto the samples were determined on a Nicolet Nexus 670 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1. A total of 64 scans were performed to acquire each spectrum. First the powder samples were pressed into a self-supporting IR disk (18 mm diameter, 15 mg); then the disk was placed in the sample holder which could be moved vertically along the cell’s tube by a magnet. Before the in situ FTIR measurements were initiated, the disk was treated under dynamic vacuum (6 × 10−4 Torr) at 150 °C for 3 h to remove surface contaminants. After the disk cooled to ambient temperature, 10 μl of nitrobenzene or benzyl alcohol was spiked into the cell with a syringe via the septum. After 30 min, when adsorption equilibrium had been reached, the in situ FTIR spectra of the samples were collected. The physisorbed benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene were removed by further evacuation under 6 × 10−4 Torr at 150 °C for 3 min. Another in situ FTIR spectrum of the sample was then taken."
7,Simulated in situ ESR measurement,"2.6 Simulated in situ ESR measurement Electron spin resonance (in situ ESR) signals were recorded with a Brucker A300 spectrometer. First, 50 mg powder samples were pressed into a self-supporting in situ ESR quartz tube. Before the in situ ESR measurements were initiated, the tube was treated under dynamic vacuum (6 × 10−4 Torr) to remove surface contaminants. Then, 10 μl of nitrobenzene or benzyl alcohol was spiked into the tube with a syringe via the septum. After 30 min, when adsorption equilibrium was reached, the physisorbed benzyl alcohol or nitrobenzene was removed by further evacuation under 6 × 10−4 Torr. The in situ ESR spectra of the samples were recorded."
8,Temperature-programmed ammonia desorption measurement,"2.7 Temperature-programmed ammonia desorption measurement Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia was carried out on a Micromeritics Auto Chem 2920 instrument. About 50 mg of a sample was first pretreated for 1 h in a quartz tube at 180 °C, and then the sample was cooled to 40 °C to allow the adsorption of ammonia (3.0% NH3 in N2, 30 mL/min) for 1 h. The desorption of ammonia was conducted from 40 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a helium flow (40 mL/min), and the desorption amount was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
9,Photocatalytic activity for N-alkylation of nitroarenes in benzyl alcohols,"2.8 Photocatalytic activity for N-alkylation of nitroarenes in benzyl alcohols A quantity of 20 mg of catalyst was placed in a 20 mL Schrunk glass bottle (1) which was filled with N2 at a pressure of 1 bar. Benzyl alcohols (5 mmol) and nitroarenes (0.5 mmol) were mixed fully in a Schrunk glass bottle (2) and nitrogen was bubbled to remove dissolved oxygen molecules. The mixed solution was transferred to bottle (1) under 1 atm N2 and stirred to make the catalyst blend evenly in the solution. The suspensions were irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfect Light Co.), and an IR-cut filter was used to remove all wavelengths longer than 800 nm. After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged to completely remove the catalyst particles. The remaining solution was determined by an Agilent online gas chromatograph (GC 6890, FID) with an HP-5973 mass spectrometer. An HP-5 column (length 30 m; inner diameter 320 µm; film thickness 0.25 µm) was applied for separation of product. Helium (purity 99.999%) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The temperatures of the injector and detector were maintained at 280 and 300 °C, respectively. The pressureof injection was set at 8.363 psi. The column temperature was programmed from 40 to 180 °C at 15 °C/min, and then up to 280 °C at 15 °C/min, and held 5 min. The injection volume was 5 μl. Conversion of nitroarenes and selectivity for secondary amines were as follows: Conversion % = C 0 - C nitroarenes / C 0 × 100 , Selectivity % = C amines / C 0 - C nitroarenes × 100 . C 0 represents the initial concentration of nitroarenes, and C nitroarenes and C amines are the concentrations of the substrate nitroarenes and the corresponding amines, respectively."
10,Results and discussion,"With our designed photocatalyst and expected experimental process, we began our investigation to explore the alkylation of nitroarenes with benzyl alcohols in one pot. The dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde at room temperature and 1 atm O2 was chosen as the first step reaction (Table 1 ). No product was detected in the absence of catalyst under light irradiation and controlled temperature at 298 K (Table 1, entry 1). The Ti-NS shows the high activity, chemoselectivity, and versatility for the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol (Table 1, entries 2–7) under the same conditions. The conversion of benzyl alcohol reaches 40% under light irradiation (λ ≤ 700 nm) with 99% selectivity of benzaldehyde (Table 1, entry 2). It should be noted that 24% conversion of benzyl alcohol with 99% selectivity of benzaldehyde was achieved over the Ti-NS under visible light irradiation (Table 1, entry 3), despite Ti-NS and alcohols having no visible light adsorption. It would be proposed that some intermediates with visible light adsorption may be formed, as stated in the previous reports on TiO2 [21]. Thus, the interactions between benzyl alcohol and prepared samples would be further revealed in subsequent experiments. Moreover, the Ti-NS can also catalyze the derivatives of benzyl alcohol to form the corresponding benzyl aldehydes under visible light irradiation and room temperature (Table 1, entries 4–7). Additionally, the thermocatalysis of Ti-NS for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol has been also explored. To elucidate the catalysis more clearly, a set of thermocatalysis experiments were carried out. As shown in Table 1, entries 8 and 9, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was negligible even when it was heated to 353 K under darkness. These experimental results suggested that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over the Ti-NS is mainly driven by light energy. These encouraging results indicated that the Ti-NS photocatalyst has great possibilities in photocatalytic one-pot tandem reaction of alcohols and nitroarenes. However, the layered counterpart, Ti-L, shows a much lower conversion rate for the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohols to corresponding aromatic aldehydes (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). For example, only 2% of benzyl alcohol was transformed to benzaldehyde under UV light irradiation, and the conversion rate under visible light was lower (Table S1, entry 2). Moreover, the catalytic activities of Ti-L for the derivatives of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation are also very low (Table S1, Entries 3–7). In addition, the conversion of benzyl alcohol is 2.1% over the TiO2 photocatalyst under UV light irradiation (Table S1, entry 10). These experimental results suggest that the photocatalytic activities for alcohols dehydrogenation over Ti-NS are greatly promoted. It is feasible to design a photocatalyst using Ti-NS as the basic material for the one-pot tandem reaction from alcohols and nitrobenzenes. A set of experiments were carried out to better understand the catalytic behavior of Pd/Ti-NS for the solvent-free photoalkylation of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene under the simulated sunlight irradiation and room temperature (Table 2 ). It is obvious that the poor yield of desired product was obtained in the absence of Pd nanoparticles (Table 2, entry 1), suggesting that the Pd plays the key role in this reaction. Considering the dispensable role of Pd in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, they may participate in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and imine. Moreover, Pd nanoparticles with different sizes were also loaded onto the Ti-NS to study the influence of Pd size on this reaction. The TEM images suggested that the Pd nanoparticles with size 7 nm are densely deposited on the ultrathin Ti-NS (Fig. S2). In addition, the XPS spectra were used to examine the surface chemical state of Pd. As shown in Fig. S3, the spectra of Pd3d indicated the metallic Pd of the Ti-NS. It is observed that the conversion of 99% for nitrobenzene and the yield of 85% for secondary amines were achieved over the Pd/Ti-NS with particle size about 3 nm. The gas chromatogram and mass spectrogram identified the synthesis of secondary amines (Fig. S1). The turnover frequency (TOF) and turnover number (TON) here are calculated by the moles of substrate converted and secondary amines produced per mole of Pd in the whole catalyst per hour. Thus, the TOF of the Ti-NS for the conversion of nitrobenzene is 33.3 h−1, and the TON of secondary amines has been calculated as 226.1 in 8 h. The Pd/Ti-NS with 7 nm shows decreased activity compared with that with 3 nm, suggesting that the Pd particle has a great effect on the conversion efficiency of secondary amines. The reason may be ascribed to the size effects of Pd that closely relate to electronic properties, exposed active sites, and facets [25]. Considering that the influence of Pd nanoparticles on reactivity is very complicated, the research on geometric effects of Pd is expected to be revealed in further study. To gain more information on the one-pot photoalkylation reaction, the thermocatalysis experiments were studied. Under dark conditions or in the absence of photocatalyst, no desired product was detected (Table 2, entries 4 and 5). Additionally, even when the reaction temperature was increased to 353 K, there were no secondary amines in the thermocatalytic system, indicating that the one-pot coupling reaction of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene over the Pd/Ti-NS was a photocatalytic process. To elucidate the roles of Ti-NS, different supports were used in this one-pot reaction. Compared with Pd/Ti-NS, Pd/Ti-L showed much lower photocatalytic activity for the photoalkylation of benzyl alcohol with nitrobenzene under the same conditions. Moreover, when TiO2 was used as the support, greatly decreased photocatalytic activities were observed over the Pd/TiO2. The results showed that the properties of supports can greatly affect the catalytic activities. These experimental results revealed that Ti-NS would greatly improve the adsorption and transformation of benzyl alcohol, while Pd nanoparticles play indispensable roles in the following hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the Ti-NS and Pd nanoparticles jointly catalyze the reductive N-alkylation of nitrobenzene with benzyl alcohol under mild conditions. To further understand the conversion of nitrobenzene in benzyl alcohol, kinetics experiments were carried out based on the first 8 h. Fig. 1 shows the average reaction rates for the conversion of nitrobenzene and generation of secondary amines based on their respective amounts. As shown in Fig. 1a, the plot of the concentration of nitrobenzene against the reaction time is a straight line. The average conversion rate of nitrobenzene over Pd/Ti-NS is 67.5 μmol h−1. Moreover, the number of secondary amines reached 430 μmol after 8 h (Fig. 1b). The average generation rate of secondary amines over Pd/Ti-NS is 57.5 μmol h−1. The reuse of the photocatalyst was also studied (Figs. S4 and S5). The recycling of the photocatalyst for five runs showed no obvious decrease in photocatalytic activity. After the reaction, the heterogeneous photocatalyst was separated easily from the photocatalytic system via a centrifugation and the photocatalyst can be reused directly. The XRD patterns and XPS spectra of sample are almost unchanged after the several recycles demonstrating the high stability of the Pd/Ti-NS (Fig. S5). The aforementioned experimental results confirm that photo-catalytic N-alkylation of nitrobenzene with benzyl alcohol can be achieved over the Pd/Ti-NS via a green photocatalysis. In order to confer the high flexibility of the Pd/Ti photocatalyst, photo-alkylation should be able to expand to the nitroarenes. The experimental results have been summarized in Table 3 . The Pd/Ti-NS can efficiently catalyze the alkylation of nitrobenzene in benzyl alcohol in one pot tandem reaction via a photocatalysis process. It is noteworthy that the substituent groups have a great effect on the reaction rates. Nitrobenzene derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents such as -Cl and -Br show a slight increasing in conversion rate. On the contrary, electron-donating group like OH and CH3 exhibit a decreased conversion rate. Taking the catalysts’ surface properties into account, in the photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene and their derivatives, the adsorbed nitro group is activated and then easily reduced. The functional groups of electron-withdrawing and -donating in the aromatic rings would enhance and weaken the interface charge transfer from Ti-NS to the adsorbed nitro group, which greatly influences the reduction of the nitro group [26]. Moreover, the reaction rate can also be affected by the steric hindrance effects. The nitrophenol molecules show different reaction rates when the hydroxyl group (OH) is at different positions on the benzyl ring. The reaction rate is in the order ortho- < meta- < para-, which is similar to the previous study on Au-TiO2 [21]. Why do the Pd/Ti-based materials have a huge difference for the photocatalytic N-alkylation of nitrobenzene with benzyl alcohol? Why can the tandem reaction be driven by visible light over the Pd/Ti-NS and unavailable for Pd/TiO2? The detailed photocatalytic behavior for the one-pot tandem reaction should be revealed in depth. The superficial and electronic structures of Ti-NS distinguishing them from their layered precursor and TiO2 may tremendously affect the photocatalysis, which may result in special photocatalysis different from the other reported. The preparation of Ti-L, Ti-NS, and Pd/Ti-NS followed a previously reported procedure [23,24]. The XRD patterns (Fig. S6) of the prepared samples confirm that the Ti-L, Ti-NS, and Pd/Ti-NS were successfully synthesized with high crystallinity. The Ti-L show a characteristic peak (0 2 0) at 2θ = 9.9° assigned to the reflections of the lamellar structure, due to the periodic layers stacking in a b-axis direction. It is obvious that the diffraction peak (0 2 0) disappears in the Ti-NS due to the exfoliation of stacked layers into one layer in the b-axis direction. Moreover, the introduction of Pd particles has no impact on the original structure of the Ti-NS. The structural representation of exfoliation is also shown in Fig. S6. Representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for Ti-L and Ti-NS are displayed in Figs. S7a–S7b. It is obvious that the Ti-L and Ti-NS show a periodic layered and a 2D sheetlike morphology, respectively. Further detailed structural information was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S7c, the ultrathin sheetlike morphology of the Ti-NS photocatalyst was obvious, and a lateral scale had a range from submicrometer to several micrometers. Figs. S7d and S7e show the TEM image and EDX of Pd/Ti-NS. It is obvious that highly dispersed Pd with particle size about 3 nm on the surface of ultrathin Ti-NS has been obtained. Moreover, the chemical states of Pd nanoparticles were determined by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS; Fig. S7f). The peaks at 335.1 and 340.2 eV can be attributed to the Pd3d 5/2 and Pd3d 3/2 of metallic Pd0 [24,25]. The thickness of the ultrathin nanosheets was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S8, the prepared Ti-NS has only about 0.7 nm thickness. According to the crystal structure information of Ti-NS (cif document), the theoretical thickness of a single layer is about 0.55 nm. Thus, the prepared Ti-NS with thickness 0.7 nm may be considered as the monolayer thickness. Therefore, the photocatalysts with discrepant morphologies possess special structural characters and present significantly different photocatalytic activities toward the tandem reaction of alcohols and nitroarenes. The chemisorption of reactant molecules in catalysts has a large effect on the catalysis. Most of the catalysis usually occurs on the catalysts’ surface. Therefore, the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of certain catalysts largely depend on their surface properties. In our previous studies [24], we found that the Ti-NS contains the abundant bridging hydroxyl groups Ti (OH) Ti, strongly acidic OH groups, and TiOH groups. These would form the distinctive Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. The catalytic behavior of Ti-NS may be greatly influenced by these surface acid sites. The interactions between surface properties of the prepared samples and regent molecules have been studied by in situ FTIR. As shown in Fig. 2 A, after the adsorption of benzyl, three peaks are observed at about 1206, 1367, and 1452 cm−1 on the Ti-NS attributed to νH-O, δ(OH), and δ(CH3)2 respectively [22]. These peaks also remained even after further evacuation at 6 × 10−4, Torr suggesting that benzyl alcohol can strongly chemisorb on the monolayer Ti-NS. Moreover, the peaks δs(OH) at 1367 cm−1 in absorbed benzyl alcohol molecules exhibit a red shift compared with those in free benzyl alcohol molecules (1363 cm−1), which may result from the coordination effect of the surface unsaturated surface Ti atoms for benzyl alcohol via the CO⋯Tispecies [22]. However, the peaks on Ti-L are much weaker (Fig. 2B), indicating the lower concentration of exposed Lewis acid sites in Ti-L. To further reveal the effect of surface acid sites on catalytic activity, the numbers of surface acid sites in Ti-NS and Ti-L have been studied by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). As shown in Fig. 3 , there are two strong peaks at 100 and 275 °C for Ti-NS, which can be attributed to the weak and strong surface acid sites, respectively. The number of surface acid sites can be calculated as the summation of weak and strong sites, which is 53.94 mmol/g. However, no obvious peaks of NH3 were observed for Ti-L, suggesting much fewer exposed acid sites on Ti-L than on Ti-NS. Thus, the distinct morphology of Ti-NS would provide a more open structure, which is beneficial for the exposure of acid sites and absorption of NH3 in comparison with the compact structure of Ti-L. The Ti-NS shows a high ability for the absorption of NH3 and benzyl alcohol. These results are consistent with the in situ FTIR for benzyl alcohol adsorption (Fig. 3). Benzyl alcohols coordinated on the surface of Ti-NS would result in the redistribution of electrons via the coordination bonds, which would efficiently activate the benzyl alcohol [27,28]. These can be also corroborated by the catalytic experimental results that the benzyl alcohol can be catalyzed by white Ti-NS under the visible light irradiation. The roles of surface charge transfer in coordination species were further analyzed by UV-DRS (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4A shows that the single Ti-NS and Ti-L would not respond to visible light. After the benzyl alcohol (BA) was absorbed, the Ti-NS showed an obvious visible light absorption property. Simultaneously, the color changed from the white of Ti-NS to the yellow of benzyl alcohol/Ti-NS (BA/Ti-NS) (Fig. 4B). Considering that the alcohols could be adsorbed onto the surface Lewis acid sites via Lewis acid–base interaction [28], the formation of surface complexes would be responsible for the visible light activity. This has also been witnessed in previous reports onr Nb2O5, HNb3O8, and TiO2, and this absorption in the visible light region was assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer of the surface complex [22,28]. Moreover, XPS spectra for Ti-NS with adsorbed benzyl alcohol were also measured to elucidate the chemical states of surface Ti atoms. As shown in Fig. 5 , compared with the single Ti-NS, the Ti2p spectrum of Ti-NS with adsorbed benzyl alcohol exhibits an additional peak at low binding energy, suggesting that the electron cloud density of surface Ti atoms is increased. Thus, the new additional low-valence component would indicate that benzyl alcohols adsorbed onto the surface of Ti-NS result in the redistribution of electrons from benzyl alcohol to Ti. Correspondingly, the color of Ti-NS changes from white to yellow after the adsorption of benzyl alcohol (Fig. 4). Based on these experimental results, it is rational to believe that surface electron transfer in the surficial complexes takes place from alcohols to Ti-NS via the CO⋯Ti species. The direct charge transfer results not only in the activation of benzyl alcohol molecules, but also in the expanded visible light absorption of Ti-NS. Because of the few exposed Lewis acid sites, small changes were observed on Ti-L after the benzyl alcohol absorbed (Fig. 4C). All of the results elucidate that the surface properties of catalysts have a deep influence on catalytic activities for benzyl alcohol by forming surface coordination species and direct interface charge transfer. Considering that the surface chemical state of Ti would have an influence on the adsorption of benzyl alcohol, XPS spectra of Ti2p in Ti-NS, Ti-L, and TiO2 should be investigated to better understand their difference in catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 6 , the Ti2p XPS spectrum of TiO2 exhibited symmetrical profiles, indicating that crystalline TiO2 possess only a single oxidation state of the Ti atoms. The two Ti2p binding energies are 458.1 (2p 3/2) and 464.1 eV (2p 1/2), respectively [29]. Compared with Ti2p in TiO2, a shift toward the high-binding-energy side was observed in Ti-L (458.5 and 464.2 eV) and Ti-NS (458.7 and 464.5 eV), suggesting the enhanced strength of TiO bands and decreased electron cloud density of Ti atoms in Ti-L and Ti-NS. These results indicated that the OH in benzyl alcohol would more easily coordinate with surface Ti atoms in Ti-L and Ti-NS than those in TiO2. Moreover, it should be noted that the Ti2p 1/2 and Ti2p 3/2 in Ti-NS show the higher Binding energy than that in Ti-L. These may be attributed to the structure of Ti-NS, which influences the electron cloud density of surface Ti atoms [23]. In our previous study, the results of EXAFS suggested that elongated TiO and TiTi bonds were observed in Ti-NS, with Ti-L as comparison, revealing a disordered and warped TiO6 structure [23]. These would result in an open structure to efficiently expose the active sites, such as dangling bonds and defects. Thus, the steric effect may be the main factor that affects the coordination of benzyl alcohol in Ti-NS and Ti-L. The absorption behavior of nitrobenzene on the samples was also studied by in situ FTIR spectra (Fig. S9). Fig. S9A shows the in situ FTIR spectra of nitrobenzene absorption on Ti-NS. Two strong peaks located at 1350 and 1527 cm−1 attributed to the symmetrical telescopic vibration νs NO2 and asymmetrical stretching vibration νas NO2 can be also observed after an evacuation process, suggesting strong interactions between Ti-NS and nitrobenzene molecules. Moreover, these peaks show a red shift compared with the NO2 at 1345 and 1523 cm−1 in free nitrobenzene molecules (Fig. S9), while the other characteristic bands show no change compared with those of free nitrobenzene (Fig. S9). These results indicate that the nitrobenzene would adsorb onto Ti-NS via a TiOH⋯ON or TiOH⋯ON coordination bond forming the surface complex. According to our previous studies, the surface OH and bridging hydroxyl groups would serve as Brønsted acid sites [24]. Thus, these surface Brønsted acid sites may be responsible for the adsorption of nitrobenzene. The absorbed nitrobenzene molecules could be activated by the exposed Brønsted acid via the sharing of electrons. However, the adsorption of nitrobenzene onto Ti-L is much weaker due to the lower concentration of exposed Brønsted acid sites in Ti-L (Fig. S9B). These results demonstrate that the Brønsted acid sites play important roles in the activation and further hydrogenation of nitrobenzene molecules. These results can be confirmed by UV-DRS (Fig. S10). The light absorption properties of the Ti-NS and Ti-L samples were not changed after nitrobenzene absorption, indicating that the Brønsted acid sites in catalysts could affect the electronic distribution of the nitrobenzene molecules, but not result in direct surface electron transfer under visible light irradiation. The exposed Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in catalysts are closely related to the photoalkylation of nitrobenzene with benzyl alcohol. To elucidate the underlying factors that affect the surface acid site concentration and photocatalytic activity, the microstructure of the samples was analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption (Fig. 7 ). The BET surface area of Ti-NS is about 198 m2g−1, which is more 20 times that of the Ti-L (8.4 m2 g−1). Structurally, lepidocrocite titanates Ti-L usually crystallize in an orthorhombic structure, consisting of two-dimensional (2D) corrugated layers of edge- and corner-sharing octahedral and interlayer H3O+, which compensates for the negative charge [30], as shown schematically in Fig. 8 . Thus, every layer in Ti-L contains a TiO6 host framework and nearby H+ in the form of OH group, which act as the Brønsted acid sites. After the exfoliation process, the TiO6 host framework with the OH group would form Ti-NS. Because of the open 2D structure, the OH group is exposed on the surface of Ti-NS. However, the interlayer distance is very small, restricting the exposure of acid sites. Therefore, the measured BET surface area of Ti-NS is much greater than that of Ti-L. Furthermore, the small distance of adjacent layers results in a steric inhibition effect limiting the utilization of the interlayer acid sites on Ti-L. That is, the concentration of the acid sites of LT may be similar to that of Ti-NS, but more acid sites are available in Ti-NS than in Ti-L. The large number of exposed acid sites could absorb more reactant molecules to enhance the mass transfer. The photocatalytic activity would also be increased (Fig. 9 ). Electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was used to explore the deep photocatalytic process (Fig. 10 ). First, we conducted the in situ ESR measurements for benzyl alcohol adsorbed on the Ti-NS and Ti-L under vacuum. As shown in Fig. 10, no ESR signals were observed on single Ti-NS and Ti-L. However, when benzyl alcohol adsorbed onto the surface of the samples, an obvious ESR signal at the value of g = 2.003 could be observed, which may be assigned to the oxygen vacancies (V O) [22,24]. Moreover, the ESR signal would be further enhanced under light irradiation. The in situ FTIR, DRS, and XPS suggested the formation of surface coordination species CO⋯Ti via coordination bonds, resulting in charge redistribution from alcohol to Ti-NS. Thus, the electron structure of the TiO molecular orbital in Ti-NS would be disturbed, giving an ESR signal. Moreover, under light irradiation, the coordination species CO⋯Ti would be excited, enhancing the surface charge redistribution from alcohol to Ti-NS. Thus, the ESR signal was enhanced under light irradiation (Fig. 10). These V O not only contribute to the exposure of unsaturated Ti atoms, but also strengthen the coordination bond of CO⋯Ti. Considering the lower concentrations of the exposed unsaturated surface Ti atoms, Ti-L shows a much weaker ESR signal of V O. The absorption of nitrobenzene onto photocatalysts has also been studied. As shown in Fig. 11 , the peaks at about g = 2.003 and 2.008 were assigned to the oxygen vacancies and coordinated NO− species, respectively [31]. These results confirm that nitrobenzene molecules can coordinate with the Brønsted acid sites in Ti-NS via the surface TiOH⋯ON and TiOH⋯ON species, introducing a large number of V O. These can further promote the absorption and activation of regent molecules. Additionally, the strong interactions between Ti-NS and nitrobenzene molecules with electron-withdrawing groups could result in directional charge transfer, which contributes to the activation of nitrobenzene molecules. Under light irradiation, all of the ESR signals can be greatly enhanced, suggesting that the interaction between the photocatalysts and nitrobenzene molecules can be intensified by light irradiation. Fig. 12 shows the in situ ESR spectra of Pd/Ti-NS for the photocatalytic N-alkylation of nitroarenes with benzyl alcohol at 1 atm N2 and room temperature. The ESR signal of V O and coordinated nitric species can be observed, when the nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohols are added to the system. These signals can be enhanced under light irradiation. The results suggest that the benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene molecules can be activated by the catalysts via the surface coordination species. Moreover, the V O species derived from the surface coordination process can further enhance the efficiency of absorption and mass transfer, which greatly promotes the photocatalytic efficiency. Based on the experimental results, we propose a possible scheme of photocatalytic N-alkylation of nitroarenes with benzyl alcohol over Pd/Ti-NS (Scheme 2 ). (i) In the initial phase of the reaction, alcohols and nitroarenes were chemisorbed and activated on the surface Lewis and Brønsted acid sites via the surface specie HO⋯Ti and NO2⋯HOTis. The formation of V O in this process contributes to the further activation of alcohols and nitrobenzene molecules. (ii) Under light irradiation, direct surface charge transfer takes place from alcohols to Ti-NS catalyst (ligand-to-metal) through the surface complexes (Scheme 3 ). (iii) Subsequently, these charges would be recombined by the photogenerated holes in Ti-NS. The benzyl alcohol would be induced to deprotonate an H+ forming aldehyde (Scheme 3). (iv) Since Pd has a higher work function than Ti-NS, the Pd nanoparticles can act as electron-acceptor sites in accepting the photogenerated electrons [32], resulting in the reduction of H+ to active H atoms (Scheme 3). The active H atoms transfer easily to the activated nitrobenzene bound to the Ti-NS, which subsequently undergoes hydrogenation to form the primary amines. (v) The coupling of primary amines and aldehydes produces the imines, which are further hydroaminated to the secondary amines. The successful release of intermediate products from Pd/Ti-NS by the photocatalytic one-pot tandem reaction completes the cycles and permits efficient reuse."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the photocatalytic N-alkylation of nitroarenes in benzyl alcohol over Pd/Ti-NS has been achieved in a one-pot tandem reaction under light irradiation with high conversion (>99%) of nitrobenzene and high selectivity (85%) for secondary amines. Moreover, Pd/Ti-NS shows high flexibility and universality for the redox coupling reaction. We achieved thorough understanding of the surface coordination behavior of reactant molecules on photocatalysts and further revealed the surface catalysis process of nitroarenes and benzyl alcohol at a molecular level. In situ FTIR, UV-DRS, and in situ ESR techniques confirm that the exposed surface unsaturated Ti atoms (Lewis acid sites) and Brønsted acid sites can strongly bind with the benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene molecules via the surface species ArCO⋯Ti and ArNO2⋯HOTi, forming surface complexes. The interface charge transfer on the surface ArCO⋯Ti coordination induces the activation and transformation of the alcohol molecules. Moreover, the oxygen vacancies driving the surface coordination reaction can greatly enhance the chemisorption and activation of reagent molecules. The hydrogen transfer from benzyl alcohols to the nearby nitroarenes takes place with the cooperation of Pd nanoparticles under light irradiation. Based on the experimental results, a probable surface coordination photocatalytic mechanism has been proposed. Considering the versatile coordination chemistry on the metal atoms, we believe that this work has not only developed a more efficient photocatalyst for the photoalkylation of secondary amines from nitroarenes in alcohols, but also provided great possibilities for the flexible design of ultrathin metal oxide nanosheet photocatalysts in green organic synthesis."
