0,Introduction,"Energy production and consumption has become a major environmental issue [1]. In this context, cyanobacteria, the only known prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, are receiving a growing attention for the sustainable production of the clean fuel hydrogen, due to their (i) simple nutritional requirements, (ii) robustness, (iii) metabolic plasticity, and (iv) the powerful genetics of some model strains. This is true for the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) which possesses a small genome (about 4 Mb; Table 1 ), comprising a circular chromosome and seven plasmids (CyanoBase: http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase [2,3];, easily manipulable [4–7]. The pentameric hydrogenase enzyme (HoxEFUYH) is encoded by a heptacistronic operon, which also contains three open reading frames of unknown function (sll1222, ssl2420 and sll1225 in CyanoBase). The active Hox enzyme, matured by the HoxW protease [8], and assembled using the six-subunits HypABCDEF complex [9–13] produces H2 through the reversible reaction 2H+ + 2 e− ↔ H2 (with a bias to H2 production) [14,15]. It uses NAD(P)H as the source of electrons originating from photosynthesis and/or sugar catabolism, as well as a nickel-iron cluster and several iron-sulfur centers as redox cofactors [15]. Besides the assembly and activity of the Hox enzyme, it is also important to thoroughly study the mechanisms controlling the expression of the hox operon, in order to better understand the role of the Hox enzyme in the global metabolism of the cell, and possibly develop novel tools to enhance the photoproduction of H2. The hox operon is controlled by at least three transcription factors, the LexA (Sll1626) and AbrB1 (Sll0359) proteins acting positively [11,13] and the AbrB2 factor (Sll0822 in CyanoBase) acting negatively [12]. Indeed, we recently found that AbrB2 represses the transcription of the hox operon through binding to the hox operon promoter [16]. Mutants totally or partially depleted of any of these regulatory proteins were analyzed with DNA microarray, which however were not pan-genomic in covering (at most) only 2852 chromosomal genes out of 3317 (about 85%) and none of the 408 plasmidic genes of as yet unknown functions [12,17,18]. Consequently, we developed truly pan-genomic (oligonucleotide) DNA microarrays to study the genome-wide transcriptome responses to environmental stresses and/or analyse of Synechocystis strains engineered for the production of biofuels. In addition, we have developed SVGMapping a R package to facilitate the analysis of large numbers of omics data, and visualize them onto custom-made templates depicting genome organization, metabolic pathways and cellular structures. Using these tools we characterized and compared the transcriptome profiles of our ΔabrB2 deletion mutant, with an increased level of hydrogen production [16], by comparison with the WT strain. We report that AbrB2 is a master regulator that regulates (mostly negatively) a large number of chromosomal genes operating in regulation, metal transport and protection against oxidative stress, as well as numerous plasmid genes of as yet unknown function. These findings suggest that the regulation of hydrogen production might be rather complex, and that plasmid encoded functions, which have been overlooked so far, might be involved in hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Culture conditions and RNA isolation,2.1 Culture conditions and RNA isolation Synechocystis PCC6803 wild-type (WT) and ΔabrB2 [16] were grown at 30°C under continuous white light (2500 lux; 31.25 μE m−2 s−1) on BG11 medium enriched with 3.78 mM Na2CO3 (MM) as previously described [17]. 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin (Km) was added to maintain the ΔabrB2 mutant strain. RNA isolations were repeatedly (three times) isolated from exponentially growing cultures of the WT strain and ΔabrB2 mutant with RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen) as we previously described [17].
3,Design of pangenomic oligonucleotide DNA microarray,"2.2 Design of pangenomic oligonucleotide DNA microarray Sequentially using the Earray and OligoArray softwares (https://earray.chem.agilent.com and http://berry.engin.umich.edu/oligoarray2_1) we designed new and truly pan-genomic oligonucleotide DNA microarrays (TranSyn6803 project) where the protein coding sequence (CS) of each chromosomal and plasmid genes is represented by one to three non-overlapping 60 mer oligonucleotides, depending on CS length. Hence, long CS (≥500 bp) are represented by three oligonucleotides, which correspond to the beginning, middle and end of the CS; middle and end of the CS; whereas shorter CS (500 and 120 bp) and small CS (≤120 bp) are represented by two and one oligonucleotides, respectively."
4,Microarray experiments and analysis,"2.3 Microarray experiments and analysis One dye swap was carried out for each biological replicate. cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase superscript II kit, dNTP and aminoallyl-dUTP (Invitrogen), cDNA purification with QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), tagging with Cy™Dye Post-labeling Reactive Dye Pack (Life Sciences), and synthesis of DNA microarray, and hybridization and scans were accomplished by using Agilent Technologies. Microarray signals and data were analyzed with the Limma package of the R/Bioconductor software [19]. Microarray spot intensities were normalized by subtracting the background and using the LOWESS method with the smooth parameter set to 0.33 as recommended [20]. Normalized measures served to compute the ratios of Cy3/Cy5 intensity and the associated log2-transform (denoted log2-ratios) for each gene. Then, to identify genes with log2-ratios significantly different between the mutant and WT strain, p-values were calculated for each gene using a moderated t-test based on an empirical Bayes analysis, which is equivalent to shrinkage (or expansion) of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, thereby resulting in a more stable inference. p-values were adjusted for multiple testing [21]. Then, the SVGMapping method was used to integrate and visualize the changes in expression of the responsive genes in their metabolic pathways, cellular function or genome environments."
5,Results and discussion,
6,AbrB2 behaves mostly as a negative regulator,"3.1 AbrB2 behaves mostly as a negative regulator The expression pattern of total mRNA from our recently constructed abrB2-deleted mutant (ΔabrB2) showing an increased hydrogen production level [16] was compared with the WT strain, using our new DNA glass microarray carrying 3639 of the 3725 genes (protein coding sequences) of Synechocystis. Using the standard criteria for selection (fold change of mRNA abundance (FC) higher than the absolute value of 2.0, and p-value lower than 0.01%) we found a large number of genes (333; i.e. 8.9% of all the 3725 genes of Synechocystis) to be deregulated in response to the deletion of abrB2 (Table 1). The highest number of the AbrB2-responsive genes is coding for hypothetical proteins (103 genes) or unknown proteins (134 genes), emphasizing that much is still to be done in the field of functional genomics to unravel the function of uncharacterized genes. Also interestingly, most of the AbrB2-responsive genes (299 out of 333, i.e. 89%) were found to be up-regulated (some of them quite strongly: FC > 9) in the AbrB2-deleted mutant. Together these findings show that AbrB2 is an important regulator, which mostly behaves as a negative regulator in Synechocystis growing under standard photoautotrophic conditions."
7,"AbrB2 regulates (negatively) the hox operon encoding the hydrogenase enzyme, but neither the hoxW gene nor the hypA 1 B 1 A 2 B 2 CDE genes operating in the maturation and assembly of the hox complex","3.2 AbrB2 regulates (negatively) the hox operon encoding the hydrogenase enzyme, but neither the hoxW gene nor the hypA 1 B 1 A 2 B 2 CDE genes operating in the maturation and assembly of the hox complex We found that AbrB2 negatively regulates all the eight-genes of the hox operon: hoxE (sll1220), hoxF (sll1221), sll1222, hoxU (sll1223), hoxY (sll1224), ssl2420, sll1225 and hoxH (sll1226), with a FC comprised between 3.82 and 4.77 (Fig. 1 ). This finding is consistent with (i) the analysis of an abrB2-interrupted mutant constructed in the glucose-tolerant mutant genetic background with DNA microarray not totally pan-genomic [12] (we constructed our abrB2-less mutant in the wild-type genetic background, because the WT strain is the organism that actually occurs in Nature, and we designed true pan-genomic DNA microarray to analyze transcriptome profiles); and (ii) our recent gel shift analysis and promoter assay of the AbrB2 fixation on the hox operon promoter, which showed that AbrB2 represses the hox operon by binding onto its promoter [16]. By contrast, we found that AbrB2 regulates neither hoxW, the gene encoding the protease that cleaves a 24-amino-acid peptide from HoxH subunit prior to its assembly into the NiFe-hydrogenase complex [9], nor the hyp genes (slr1675, sll1432, sll1078, sll1079, ssl3580, slr1498 and sll1462 coding for HypA1B1A2B2CDE respectively) which operate in Hox assembly [10]. Collectively, our results show that AbrB2 negatively regulates the hox operon, in agreement with our confirmatory data [16] showing that AbrB2 actually represses the hox operon through binding onto its promoter. Furthermore, we show here that AbrB2 does not regulate the genes hoxW and hypA 1 B 1 A 2 B 2 CDE involved in the maturation and assembly of the hydrogenase enzyme complex, to the single exception of hypF gene (sll0322), encoding a carbamoyl phosphate-converting enzyme [22], which we found to be negatively regulated by AbrB2."
8,AbrB2 regulates neither carbon nor nitrogen metabolism,"3.3 AbrB2 regulates neither carbon nor nitrogen metabolism We found that AbrB2 regulate neither the abrB1 gene (sll0359) encoding an activator of the hox operon nor the carbon metabolism genes (Fig. 1), in agreement with what found with the non pan-genomic DNA microarray analysis of the abrB2-interrupted mutant created in the glucose tolerant genetic background [12,23]. In contrast to the previous report, we did not find the urtA, amt1, glnB and sigE genes and the nrtABCD operon, which operate in nitrogen regulation and assimilation, to be regulated by AbrB2. This discrepancy might somehow result from the fact that our AbrB2-deleted mutant grows as healthy as the WT strain, whereas the abrB2-deleted mutant constructed by Ishii and co-workers, in the glucose tolerant genetic background which possesses several specific mutations as compared to the WT strain [24] exhibits a slow growth. Further experiments will be performed in our laboratory to study the influence of the growth conditions (growth speed) on the transcriptome response of our abrB2-deleted mutant."
9,"AbrB2 regulates several transport systems (Fe, S, Co, P, Zn)","3.4 AbrB2 regulates several transport systems (Fe, S, Co, P, Zn) We looked with great interest the possible influence of AbrB2 on the expression of the wealth of transport genes because the Hox enzyme uses a Ni–Fe redox center and several Fe–S redox clusters to produce hydrogen, the level of which is known to be affected by Ni, Fe, S, N, C availabilities, positively (Fe, Ni and S) and negatively (C and N) [25–27]. In the case of nitrogen and carbon, their limitation decrease the consumption of electrons, which can then be re-directed to and use for hydrogen production. As anticipated, we found that AbrB2 regulates several of the genes operating in the following transport systems (Fig. 1): cysAPUW ( SO 4 2 − ), pstABCS ( PO 4 2 − ), fecBCD (Fe2+), ziaABR (Zn2+), coaRT and hupE (Co2+) [8] , kdpABCD (K+). These findings prompt us to study further the influence of AbrB2 on the tolerance to Fe, Ni, and S (starvation and excess) stresses. By contrast, we observed no influence of AbrB2 on the expression of the genes encoding the cbiMOQ transport systems for Ni (Fig. 1)."
10,AbrB2 regulates (negatively) the anti-oxidant quinol oxidase and nitric oxide reductase genes but not the photosynthesis genes,"3.5 AbrB2 regulates (negatively) the anti-oxidant quinol oxidase and nitric oxide reductase genes but not the photosynthesis genes Because our abrB2-deleted mutant exhibits a normal healthy growth and typical blue-green color under standard photoautotrophic laboratory conditions (data not shown) we anticipated that the expression of the large number of genes involved in photosynthesis would be unaltered. As expected, this was true for genes encoding for the following photosynthesis sub-complexes: photosystem I (PSI), photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6/f complex (Cytb6/f), cytochrome c oxidase (Cytc), cytochrome bd-quinol oxidase (Qox), plastocyanin (PC), plastoquinone (PQ), and the associated redox complexes ATP synthase, ferredoxins, FNR (ferredoxin: NADP reductase) and NADH dehydrogenase type-1 and type-2 (Ndh1 and Ndh2). By contrast, we found that AbrB2 negatively regulates the cydA (slr1379) and cydB (slr1380) genes (Fig. 1) encoding the cytochrome bd-quinol oxidase, which can reduce O2 thereby preventing the over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool that triggers oxidative stress [28]. Similarly, and consistently we found that AbrB2 negatively regulates strongly (FC = 8.48) the norB gene (sll0450) encoding the anti-oxidant enzymes nitric oxide reductase which uses electrons provided by quinols to protect Synechocystis from nitric oxide [29]. The increased expression of the cydAB and norB genes of our abrB2-deleted mutant is consistent with its increased resistance to oxidative stress [16], and with the proposition that hydrogen production prevents oxidative stress in behaving as an electron valve [15,30]."
11,AbrB2 is a master regulator that regulates (mostly negatively) various transcription regulators,"3.6 AbrB2 is a master regulator that regulates (mostly negatively) various transcription regulators In Synechocystis, sensor histidine kinases (Hik) and response regulators (Rre) are involved in several cellular processes as heat shock stress (Hik34), osmotic stress and high light stress (Hik33), carbon assimilation and metabolism (Hik8, LexA, Rre37), hydrogen production (LexA, AbrB1, AbrB2), protection against oxidative stress and metal stresses (Slr1738) or regulation of alcohol dehydrogenase adhA (Rre1) [11,17,31–37]. We found that AbrB2 negatively regulates 12 regulator genes: sll1292 (Rre11), sll1291 (Rre12), slr1305 (Rre41), slr0210 (Hik9), slr0311 (Hik29), sll1872 (LytR), slr0449 (Dnr), sll1161 (Cya3), slr1860 (IcfG), slr1861, slr0846 (Rrf2) and slr1245 the protein belonging to the LysR family of transcription regulators. By contrast, AbrB2 positively regulates the slr1594 (Rre5) regulator gene, and it regulates neither LexA nor AbrB1 the positive regulators of the hox operon. Together, the absence of AbrB2 regulation of LexA and AbrB1, and our recent findings that AbrB2 negatively regulates the hox operon through binding to its promoter [16] demonstrate that the AbrB2-mediated repression of the hox operon is entirely achieved through the binding of AbrB2 onto the hox operon promoter, i.e. it does not involve a negative effect of AbrB2 on the expression of the other Hox regulators LexA and AbrB1. The finding that AbrB2 regulates the divergently transcribed opposite genes norB (sll0450, see above) and dnr (slr0449) [38], is not unprecedented. Indeed, we recently reported that two opposite genes could be regulated the same way (also negatively) by the same transcription factor [39]. Concerning the AbrB2 down-regulated genes slr1861 and slr1860, which encode the Slr1861 kinase phosphorylating the Slr1856 and Slr1859 proteins and the Slr1860 phosphatase dephosphorylating Slr1856 [40], we noticed with great attention that these four genes belongs to the same continuous region of the chromosome carrying 26 genes all negatively regulated by AbrB2 (Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, these genes are interesting in that they constitute four large clusters (possibly four operons): (i) slr1406 to slr1410, (ii) sll1307 to sll1783, (iii) slr1852 to slr1862 and (iv) slr1863 to slr1866, and a large number of them (slr1406, slr1409, slr1410, sll1307, sll1306, sll1785, sll1784) may encode periplasmic proteins possibly involved in the AbrB2-downregulated transport systems mentioned above."
12,"AbrB2 regulates (mostly negatively and strongly) a large number of plasmidic genes, thereby suggesting that plasmids are important for cell physiology and possibly hydrogen production too","3.7 AbrB2 regulates (mostly negatively and strongly) a large number of plasmidic genes, thereby suggesting that plasmids are important for cell physiology and possibly hydrogen production too A high proportion of the plasmidic genes appeared to be regulated, mostly negatively and often quite strongly, by AbrB2 (Table 1, and Fig. 3 ). This is especially true of the two largest plasmids pSYSX and pSYSM, which share many genes in common [3], and (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the AbrB2-regulated genes of the pSYSX plasmid define a very large genes cluster duplication, which thereby may encode one or several functions important for the fitness of Synechocystis. Furthermore, together with our findings that AbrB2 represses the hox operon encoding the hydrogenase enzyme, our present data suggest that some of the AbrB2-regulated plasmidic genes might somehow operate in the production of hydrogen. This hypothesis is presently tested in our laboratory."
13,Conclusion,"We report on the development of truly pan-genomic (oligonucleotide) DNA microarray to study the genome-wide transcriptome responses of the best-characterized cyanobacterium Synechocystis to environmental stresses and/or to reprogramming for the production of biofuels. In addition we have developed SVGMapping an R package to facilitate the analysis of the large number of omics data and visualize them onto custom-made templates depicting genome organization, metabolic pathways and cellular structures. Using these tools, we characterized and compared the transcriptome profiles of our ΔabrB2 deletion mutant, with an improved hydrogen production [16], to that of the WT strain. We show here that AbrB2 is a master regulator that regulates (mostly negatively) a large number of chromosomal genes operating in hydrogen production, regulation, metal transport and protection against oxidative stress, as well as numerous plasmid genes of as yet unknown function. These findings suggest that the regulation of hydrogen production might be rather complex, an hypothesis currently tested in our laboratory, and that plasmid encoded functions, which have been overlooked so far, might be involved in hydrogen production, among other important cellular processes mentioned above. Consequently, we believe that the present report will stimulate both basic and applied researches on plasmid functions and their likely relation with hydrogen production."
