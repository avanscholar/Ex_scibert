0,Introduction,"The need of finding new solutions for a clean and sustainable energy is becoming a critical factor for the future of society [1]. It is necessary to increase the share of use of renewable energy (RE) and valorize alternative raw materials. In other words, it is necessary to develop processes and technologies for a resource- and energy-efficient process industry. In this context, an important role is assumed by carbon capture and storage (CCS) and by carbon capture and utilization (CCU). These technologies promote the sustainability and circular economy, encourage industrial symbiosis and economic growth and enable the storage of renewable energy. This is in agreement with European policy 2020 that aims to reduce the 20% of GHG emissions by 2020. In fact, the storage and the utilization of CO2 to produce other compounds contribute to achieve this objective. Many works are present in the literature regarding the use of carbon dioxide as waste or cheap available raw material [2–5] but only Olha and Prakash [6] and Centi et al. [7] with three different routes discuss the integration of renewable energy and carbon dioxide to produce methanol and other compounds. The introduction of RE into the chemical production chain thus opens new challenges and interesting research perspectives. In fact, in addition to other chemical compounds, carbon dioxide may be used to produce many fuels. An important metric to compare the different fuels is the EXC, as the carbon fuel exergy content per mole of carbon. The exergy of a fuel refers to the maximum reversible work that can be generated from it. In general, EXC gives an indication of the moles of carbon atoms needed to store one unit (MJ) of exergy in the carbon fuel. Thus, choosing fuels with higher value of EXC reduces the carbon demand for storing a unit of exergy. Al-musleh et al. [8] provide the value of the carbon fuel exergy for different fuels, considering other metrics as EXH→C as the exergy stored in the carbon fuel relative to hydrogen exergy during the carbon fuel synthesis step and the EXV as the carbon fuel exergy content per unit fuel volume under storage. Gases, such as methane, ethane and dimethyl ether have the higher value of EXC equal to 806 MJ/kmolC, 723 MJ/kmolC, 685 MJ/kmolC, respectively. Liquids, such as methanol, ethanol and iso-octane have the higher value of EXC equal to 693 MJ/kmolC, 654 MJ/kmolC, 652 MJ/kmolC, respectively. This parameter identifies favorable carbon fuel candidates that can be evaluated by conducting rigorous simulations or experimentation. Methanol and dimethyl ether, having the highest values, are chosen to be analyzed in this study, in addition to syngas, being a source that can be used to produce these two chemical compounds. The innovative production technologies of them and the used reactors are analyzed. Also, respect to other literature works, attention is posed to political legislations that encourage the use of renewable carbon dioxide. Carbon taxes and Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) are political means, used to promote the production of fuels from carbon dioxide and renewable energy. Literature works show that the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide is the most appealing way to produce methanol by technical and economic point of views and many compounds can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 1 . Different sources are used for carbon dioxide and hydrogen involved in the reaction. However, future researches should be regarding alternative sources of molecular hydrogen in order to decrease the costs (the incidence of electrolyzer is about 65% of total costs). In addition to coke oven gas (COG) and chlorine alkali plant, syngas, methane steam reforming and petrochemical plants can be used to produce hydrogen. The same consideration can be treated for the carbon dioxide source: more integration with other chemical plants can be developed to recover CO2 and to produce methanol and dimethyl ether (the latter can be obtained by methanol dehydration). The ammonia plant, for example, can be integrated to recover carbon dioxide and produce ammonia and methanol simultaneously. Iron, steel, cement plants are additional sources of carbon dioxide. An interesting technology under development is the co-electrolysis of carbon dioxide and water to produce methanol and syngas [10,11]. More attention should be posed about municipal and industrial wastes. It is very important to study and diffuse the knowledge of the production of these fuels from renewable energy and by capturing carbon dioxide from other chemical processes. In fact, as reported by Jones et al. [12] the social acceptance of carbon dioxide utilization is very low and there is some skepticism about the long term environmental benefits. Then, better knowledge diffusion models are need. In this case, the social acceptance of policy and technology innovation is determined by the opinions and actions of stakeholders operating on three dimensions (i.e., socio-political, market, and community acceptance)."
1,Production of useful chemical compounds from CO2,"CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is an important technology to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigate the climate change in the future. Another option is the CO2 capture and utilization (CCU). Although the CCU is an attractive approach, the market for the utilization of captured CO2 is relatively small (11%–17%) compared to the total production of CO2 [13,14]. However, compared to CCS, CCU reduces the CO2 emissions and produces valuable fuels and chemicals [15]. An integration of CCS and CCU, known as CCUS, might be able to effectively utilize both advantages of the respective approaches, as enhancing both environmental and economic incentive [14]. In this context, the carbon dioxide is a waste that can be valorized and it is a key molecule to reduce the fossil consumption and to ensure the energy efficiency of processes. Also, the conversion of CO2 into feedstock for the chemical/process industry is an efficient way to introduce the renewable energies in the chemical chain [7]. The main products, shown in Fig. 2 , that can be obtained by CO2 are: methane, syngas, hydrocarbons, methanol, ethanol, formic acid, dimethyl ether (DME) [16]. Hydrogenation of CO2 is extensively researched in literature because it provides a direct route to methanol, methane, ethanol and formic acid, that can be used as fuels or as intermediates to produce more advanced fuels and chemical compounds [17–19]. The catalytic hydrogenation is the most mature and old technology in this field. Other conversion routes such as reversed water gas shift or dry reforming of methane can be used for the production of syngas that together with a Fischer Tropsch reaction produces hydrocarbons [18]. The dimethyl ether can be obtained also by the hydrogenation of methanol or by the dry reforming of syngas. The different compounds can be transformed in one and/or the other with different reactions. In the considered reaction paths, CO2 could be collected from industrial waste streams or even from the atmosphere. In the hydrogenation reactions, the hydrogen may originate from electrolysis of water, where the source of electricity should be renewable as well (wind, biomass, solar, tides, waves, etc.). Other H2 sources can be the biomass pyrolysis or steam/oxygen gasification processes, the reforming of biomass-derived products (for instance ethanol, methane, etc.) and the partial oxidation of light oil residues. Raudaskoski et al. [336] suggest to produce hydrogen by the dry reforming. Other routes are still under investigation [22–24]. However, the electrolysis of water is the most mature and well-established technology even at industrial scale [25]. One of them implies producing biological H2 by means of microorganisms activated by sunlight while another is a water splitting process assisted by photo-semiconductor catalysts [26]. Methanol is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide according to the reaction (see Eq. (1)) [27]: (1) C O 2 + 3 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH + H 2 O World methanol production is about 65 million tons [28]. In the green chemistry, the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen are produced by renewable energies and in the last years there is an interest in the production of methanol from CO2, based on the so called “Power-to-Fuel” concept [29,30]. An alternative route to produce methanol can be considered in the gas to methanol (GTM) process. Methanol can be obtained from synthesis gas from the following reactions [31]: (2) CO + 2 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH (3) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O (4) C O 2 + 3 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH + H 2 O After decades of efforts in exploiting the effective catalyst materials and developing advanced reactors, catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has become technically competitive with the industrial production of methanol from syngas. In addition, the methanol production is successfully demonstrated using photocatalytic and electrochemical methods. The first uses the solar energy and is limited to lab-scale studies [32], while the second method uses high temperature solid oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) and shows great potential for large scale applications [18,33]. The H2/CO2 ratio for CO2 hydrogenation should be 3 for the methanol production. Other raw materials are used to produce methanol as natural gas through reactions of steam reforming and partial oxidation [34,35] and biomass through gasification [36–39]. Methanol is an important primary raw material for the energy and chemical industries, due to its wide applications ranging from energy uses (e.g., as a fuel by itself, or to be blended with gasoline) to chemical uses (e.g., as a solvent, or to be converted to formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl methacrylate, dimethyl terephthalate, methylamines, chloromethanes, dimethyl carbonate and methyl tertiary butyl ether, etc.) [35,40,41]. It can also be transformed to ethylene and propylene via methanol-to-olefin (MTO) processes [42]. The ethanol production follows this reaction (see Eq. (5)) [29,30]: (5) 2 ⋅ CO + 6 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C 2 H 5 OH + 3 ⋅ H 2 O The direct ethanol synthesis has very low selectivity to C2+ alcohols and low conversion rates at even high pressures so the reaction follows two steps trough reverse water gas shift (rWGS) and CO hydrogenation [43–45] as the following reactions (see Eqs. (6) and (7)): (6) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O (7) 2 ⋅ CO + 4 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 The CO2 conversion into CO is achieved at high temperatures (at 848 K, a CO2 conversion around 48% is obtained) due to the endothermic nature of the rWGS. Another thermochemical route for the ethanol production is through the dimethyl ether as proposed by Atsonios et al. [29,30]. The first stage is the DME synthesis from carbon dioxide and hydrogen (see Eqs. (8)–(10)), while the second stage is the DME transformation into ethanol (see Eq. (11)), according the following reactions: (8) C O 2 + 3 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH + H 2 O (9) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O (10) 2 ⋅ C H 3 OH ↔ C H 3 OC H 3 + H 2 O (11) C H 3 OC H 3 + H 2 ↔ C 2 H 5 OH Ethanol is gaining interest in the last decades not only as an alternative fuel [46,47] but also a valuable chemical block for synthesis of numerous products [48]. Ethanol is a perfect additive into petrol, because increases the octane number and reduces the CO and PM emissions. Also, ethanol has an important advantage over methanol for application as transportation fuel because it is less toxic and dangerous, permitting higher blending ratios with conventional gasoline [49]. However, few studies are available regarding the production of ethanol by carbon dioxide [43–45]. The traditional raw material used to produce ethanol is the biomass [50–52]. Methane is produced by the hydrogenation of CO2 according to the Sabatier reaction, that, even if it is known over a century, has received renewed interest recently, for use as chemical storage of the excess of electrical energy used to produce hydrogen needed for its synthesis through the electrolysis of water (see Eq. (12)) [7]: (12) C O 2 + 4 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C H 4 + 2 ⋅ H 2 O The electrical energy is obtained by renewable energy in the so called Power to gas (PtG) concept. The H2/CO2 ratio for CO2 hydrogenation should be 4 for the methane production [29,30]. The obtained renewable methane can be also used in the chemical industry to lower the carbon footprint. However, the difficulties in the direct conversion of methane to chemicals make the process not convenient currently. It is interesting to underline that the reaction can be developed by catalytic and biological ways [53]. Biological reactions take place at mild conditions of temperature and pressure (so for these reasons are more advantageous) but these processes are complex, the reaction rates are usually slow and process knowledge is often insufficient. Also, methane can be obtained by traditional raw materials as coal through gasification [54] or biomass through anaerobic digestion producing biogas [55,56]. The hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid proceeds according to the following reaction (see Eq. (13)) [57]: (13) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ HCOOH There are new interesting alternative approaches under development for the hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOOH: the use of tandem photoelectrocatalytic reactions, the coupling of a photocatalyst and an enzyme, the development of advanced photoelectrodes, the application of ionic liquids to promote the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid, the use of a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) driven by a microbial fuel cell (MFC) [7]. Many research groups have been working intensively in order to develop and implement technologies on industrial scale, but the processes are still at the laboratory research level and far away from commercialization [58]. Formic acid has a wide application in dyeing, textile and leather industries, in rubber production, as an intermediate in chemical and pharmaceutical industries and as an aid in the ensilage of green forage due to its strong acidic nature and reducing properties [59]. This product is also potentially a fuel and energy-storage medium [60]. Methyl formate can be also used to produce formic acid through hydrolysis [61,62], in addition to methanol [63]. Dimethyl ether is produced by the catalytic de-hydration of methanol, according the following reaction (see Eq. (14)) [64]: (14) 2 ⋅ C H 3 OH ↔ C H 3 OC H 3 + H 2 O The mechanism follows either Langmuir–Hinshelwood [65] or Eley–Rideal kinetic models [66], with water and DME both acting as reaction inhibitors [67]. This way is known as the indirect synthesis method and it is different by the direct synthesis method where DME is obtained by syngas containing H2, CO and CO2 consisting of the simultaneous conversion of syngas to methanol (see Eqs. (15) and (16)) water gas shift reaction (see Eq. (17)) and dehydration of methanol (see Eq. (18)) [16,68,69]: (15) CO + 2 ⋅ H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH (16) C O 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH + H 2 O (17) CO + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 (18) C H 3 OH ↔ C H 3 OC H 3 + H 2 O DME is the simplest ether, with some important properties: non-toxic, colorless gas, non-corrosive, non- carcinogenic and environmentally friendly [70]. It can be used as a fuel, a building block for important chemicals such as ethylene and propylene and also as a replacement for chlorofluoro carbons in aerosols [71]. In particular, DME is a ‘clean’ fuel due to its high oxygen content and the absence of CC bonds reducing NOx, SOx and particulate matter [72]. In addition, DME can be used as pesticide, polishing agent, and anti-rust agent. It can also be considered as an attractive material for producing alkyl-aromatics, a suitable source for the hydrogen used in fuel cells, as well as a key intermediate for producing dimethyl sulfate, methyl acetate, light olefins, and so many other important chemicals [73–75]. In addition to carbon dioxide, biomass via gasification, coal and natural gas can be used to produce DME [76,77]. Syngas can be also obtained by the electrolysis of CO2 to produce CO mixed to H2 produced by the electrolysis of water. The simultaneous co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O in a single electrolyzer can be carried out, as in Fig. 3 [78]. According this principle, the reactions in the cathode are the following (see Eqs. (19) and (20)) [20,21]: (19) C O 2 + e − → CO + O 2 − (20) H 2 O + e − → H 2 + O 2 − At the anode occurs the following reaction (see Eq. (21)) [20,21]: (21) 2 ⋅ O 2 − → O 2 + 4 ⋅ e − Production of syngas from CO2 and H2O, using photo-catalytic process [79–82], solar-driven thermo-catalytic dissociation over ceria catalyst [83] and high-temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis [84–87] is studied. Syngas can be obtained by the dry reforming of methane produced reacting with CO2, as the following reaction (see Eq. (22)): (22) C O 2 + C H 4 ↔ 2 ⋅ CO + 2 ⋅ H 2 This reaction is studied by several researches as Al-Ali et al. [88], Pakhare and Spivey [89] and Guo et al. [90] and is considered as an alternative to methane steam reforming. Combining the two reactions, the amount of the required steam per unit of produced syngas decreases the carbon footprint of the syngas production. Syngas plays an important role in the energy sector because produces a number of important energy carriers and liquid fuels by the Fischer-Tropsch process [91] (Fig. 4 ). Short-chain olefins (ethylene and propylene) could be directly produced from syngas using modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts as it has been reviewed recently [92]. There is still significant industrial interest, mostly driven by the goal of producing high-octane gasoline components (by oligomerization/isomerization of short-chain olefins from FT), in contrast with the middle distillate (diesel) produced with the conventional process, as seen for example in the synthol process by Sasol in South Africa [7]. Generally, syngas is also produced by gasification of biomass [93,337,338] and biomass/coal blends ([93]; Salgansky et al., 2017; New concepts in biomass gasification; S. Heidenreich, P.U. Foscolo; Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 46, 2015, 72–95), by reforming of natural gas and by dry reforming of ethanol and methanol [55]. It is possible to evaluate the efficiency of the analyzed direct reactions, considering the consumed hydrogen and the calorific power of the products, as in Table 1 . In Table 1, efficiency is defined as the LHV divided by the Hatoms consumed to obtained 1 mole of the desired product, according to stochiometric expression. It is possible to evaluate the loss of hydrogen during the reaction due to the formation of water. The loss of hydrogen is measured as the ratio between the hydrogen atoms in the produced water and that in the reagents. Table 2 shows that the acid formic and syngas reaction have the highest efficiency in hydrogen utilization. In the following sections, the production of methanol, dimethyl ether and syngas from carbon dioxide are revised from literature."
2,Methanol production,"Methanol (MeOH) production using renewable energy is analyzed in the literature in several works. Different kinds of reactions can be used as hydrogenation of syngas, the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide with hydrogen, the co-electrolysis of water and carbon dioxide, the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reaction as reported in Table 1. An alternative route is the production of syngas in the methanol-synthesis-based GTM (gas to methanol) process that, generally, comprises three sections. The first section is related to syngas production: the methane reforming reaction occurs through auto-thermal reforming (ATR) [80,81], partial oxidation of methane (POM) [94], steam methane reforming (SMR) [95], and carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CDR) [95–97]. The second section is related to methanol synthesis, typically over Cu-based catalysts, which produce crude methanol containing a few byproducts such as dimethyl ether (DME) and ethanol [40,98]. According to Lim et al. [99], Cu, Zn, Cr and Pd are commonly used to minimize by-products formation (i.e. hydrocarbons) and maximize methanol yield and selectivity. Furthermore, many Cu-based catalysts promoted by B, V, and Ga have been investigated too [100]. Transitional metal carbides are also used for the methanol synthesis [4,101]. Organocatalysts are also used to activate the carbon dioxide producing methanol by researchers at the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (IBN) in Singapore. In the third section, the methanol is purified through a purification system. With these processes, it is important to have a value of H2/(2CO + 3CO2) ratio equal to 1 downstreams of the methanol synthesis. CO2/Steam–mixed reforming is employed for syngas production to generate syngas under flexible H2/(2CO + 3CO2) ratios by adjusting the two competitive methane reforming reactions, SMR and CDR. For this kind of processes, Park et al. [102] carried out a simulation study to find the optimum reaction conditions to maximize the production of methanol. Lee et al. [103] modeled three gas-to-liquids (GTL) processes that produce methanol, DME, and F–T diesel in order to find the optimal conditions under uncertain price scenarios. Few works are reported in literature regarding the entire GTM systems. The operating process conditions, as temperature and pressure, for this kind of reaction range from 423 K to 523 K and from 1 to 100 bar respectively. Catalyst based on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 are used [11]. It is necessary reinforced careful temperature control to avoid catalyst deactivation. Luu et al. [104] present an analysis applied to CCUS by integrating the enhanced recovery gas (EGR) with MeOH production. The natural gas (NG) mixture (CO2 and CH4) from the NG production is sent to the MeOH plant to react with the captured CO2 in the reformer (based on bi-reforming reaction) and produce a syngas mixture suitable for MeOH synthesis. Simulations are carried out in Aspen Plus: results show that the proposed process has the highest CO2 abatement intensity (45.5%) among other comparable investigated scenarios. The entire GTM process is analyzed by Zhang et al. [105,106], considering the energy efficiency and the carbon dioxide emissions, and suggesting two innovative CO2-utilization GTM processes (CGTM) based on methanol synthesis that can convert CO2 through reforming and hydrogenation. Zhang et al. [106] developed two options of carbon-dioxide-utilization gas-to-methanol process (CGTM) with the fresh CO2 feeding method as the main configuration difference, as in Fig. 5 . In option 1, the fresh CO2 is first fed to the reforming unit to produce CO, and then to the methanol synthesis unit to produce methanol. While, in option 2, the fresh CO2 is fed to the methanol synthesis unit to directly produce methanol. Then the methanol production is performed through syngas production. Simulations of the process are carried out in Aspen Plus and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) kinetic approach is applied in the Plug model reactor to simulate the reactions, using previous experimental results [99]. The NPV, IRR, and DPBP values for the two options are in the rage of 483.41–858.80 M$, 17.15–22.65%, and 6.23–9.52 year, respectively. In addition, results suggest that the methanol price, CAPEX and natural gas price have the major influence on the economic feasibility. Zhang et al. [105] consider the same processes of Zhang et al. [106] with reforming unit, methanol synthesis unit and a recycling unit. The unreacted syngas, used for the methanol synthesis, is recycled to the methanol synthesis and reforming units to enhance the energy efficiency. Simulations of the processes are developed in Aspen Plus. Results show that the energy efficiency is influenced by the recycle ratio: higher recycle ratio has a positive effect on CO2 conversion, energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions. However, the split ratio has little effect on the energy efficiency. The process can produce 125 kmol/h of methanol with a thermal and carbon efficiency equal to 0.7 and 0.9 respectively. A major integration of methanol plant with renewable energy is reported by Storch et al. [107], in the SOLar MEthanol process - SOLME) process, in Fig. 6 . The developed process consumes two energy streams, the natural gas and the solar energy, to produce methanol and electrical energy. The SOLME process is based on an indirectly heated solar reforming concept: the solar radiation is converted in heat absorbed by heat transfer fluid and sent to reforming reactor that produces the syngas used in the methanol synthesis. The main sections are the solar part, the reforming part and the methanol synthesis part. A natural gas consumption of 1.4 mol and 21 kJ of electricity consumption are determined per mole of methanol production. This corresponds to an energetic efficiency of 65%. The results indicate that the proposed SOLME process can make more efficient use of the solar energy than that with conventional solar power plants. Hence, the solar methanol production is promising to initiate a further penetration of solar energy into the chemical industry. Iaquaniello et al. [108] analyze a process to produce methanol by gasification of municipal solid wastes (MSW) that are a main source of carbon. The plant is simulated in PROII and has three gasifiers at high temperature in order to guarantee the plant maintenance while maintaining continuity of the production. An economic analysis is carried out. The plant produces methanol at 110 €/t treating 300 t/d of wastes. The ROI is equal to 29%. The waste to methanol (WtM) plant can produce methanol with 40% and 30–35% reduction in GHG emissions with respect to methanol production from fossil fuel and bio-resource, respectively. Compared to waste to energy (WtE) processes WtM allows to produce fuels rather than electrical energy. This allows easy storage of the fuel and distribution even on a long distance, while electrical energy depends on the capacity of grid to accept the introduction of power, which in turn depends on the highly fluctuating demand, being the electrical energy storage still not effective on large scale. These considerations suggest that WtM is a valuable solution from economic, strategic and environmental perspective. An additional scheme to produce methanol by gasification of biomass is analyzed by Specht et al. [109]. They find that the only possibility to achieve high carbon conversions for methanol synthesis from biomass feedstocks is hydrogen addition to the gasifier syngas. The conversion of biomass to methanol by addition of external hydrogen requires high investment costs for an electrolysis unit, but provides high methanol production rates. Using conventional gasification processes without hydrogen addition, but with CO2 removal, the investment costs are lower, but carbon conversion is limited due to the stochiometric adjustment and the high purge gas rate. Martína and Grossmann [110] developed a process to produce methanol from switchgrass. The process consists of two sections, biomass processing to syngas and its conversion to methanol, and the electrolytic section where hydrogen is produced to hydrogenate the CO2 that has been captured during syngas cleaning. The electrolyzer utilizes a solution of 25% of KOH, using the wind energy and operating at 101 kPa and 353 K. The switchgrass is gasified to produce raw bio-syngas, purified with a membrane/PSA system. A flow of 1700 t/day of biomass is processed producing 207 Mgal/year of methanol. The investment is high, around 1000 M€, but the production cost of methanol is promising, 0.25–0.35 €/kg with a high production capacity. Shamsul et al. [111] provide a thorough review on the production of methanol from renewable sources. Biomass feedstocks vary from agricultural waste, forestry waste, livestock and poultry waste, fishery waste and sewage sludge. In addition to syngas, CO2 can be hydrogenated by H2 obtained from the electrolysis of water, in order to produce methanol. The process operates at constant temperature near to 533 K and 80 bar using catalysts made of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3. The reaction mechanism is not clear and other alternative catalyst materials are undr development, as ZrO2 in place of alumina [112]. A number of reaction kinetic models have been proposed so far based on the mature commercial catalysts such as Cu/Zn/Al catalyst [31,339–342]. In other cases, CO2 and H2O can be co-electrolyzed to produce methanol. A techno-economic study shows that the hydrogenation for methanol production can be economically feasible with an accurate analysis of costs of raw materials (H2 and captured CO2) [27]. For this reason, research activity for high-temperature CO2 electrolysis is accelerating [33] and an interesting feature of this technology is that allows to storage intermittent renewable energy [343]. Studies regard the new electrocatalysts, reaction mechanism, catalyst degradation, cell design and system design [344,113,114]. The conversion of CO2 into methanol using this process is less exothermal than the conversion of syngas into methanol and leads to a reduced amount of by-products. Pilot plants are realized in Japan (with a capacity of 100 ton/year, built by Mitsui Chemicals), Iceland (with a capacity of 4000 ton/year, constructed by Carbon Recycling International and operating since 2011) and Osaka (with a capacity of 100 ton/year) using renewable hydrogen [100]. Other demonstrated pilot plants use two steps approach, KIST (CAMERE) process (reverse WGS separated from methanol synthesis) or a single step approach proposed by NIRE/RITE (the two stages integrated in a single reactor) [7]. The first approach is preferable in terms of higher catalyst productivity, lower gas recycle and reactor size [345]. It is interesting to underline that few works are reported comparing different processes to produce methanol: there is ambiguity in selection between the processes. An effort to develop a methodology helpful for comparison of different process schemes and to evaluate the influence of different kinetic models on the performance of the methanol reactor is recently developed by Leonzio and Foscolo [115]. Also, a literature review shows that there is still limited information on the techno-economic assessment of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) and Solid Oxide electrolyzers (SOEC) when incorporated to a power-to-methanol process, where the electrolyzer is used to split the water. The latter is the most efficient option, but this is currently the less developed [346]. In this context, Rivera-Tinoco et al. [11] find a methanol cost of 891 €/ton for PEM/methanol process and 5459 €/ton for the SOEC/methanol process. Promising reduction can be obtained improving the electrolyzer system: its energy efficiency is a key parameter to decrease the costs. Simulation of the processes are carried out in Aspen Plus. The CAPEX has more influence on MeOH production for the SOEC/methanol, while the OPEX has more influence on MeOH production for the PEM/methanol. Saeidi et al. [116] focused on hydrocarbon and methanol synthesis as methods to convert CO2 to value-added products. The reaction mechanisms as well as the effects of catalyst, reactor type and operating conditions on product efficiency enhancement of each process were reviewed. Also, a brief overview on the reactor types and configurations was provided. Atsonios et al. [29,30] investigated various design and operating aspects for the valorization of industrially captured CO2 towards methanol production. In the proposed process, carbon dioxide is obtained by power plant or other intensive carbon emission industry (e.g. cement plant, steel industry) through MEA absorption. Hydrogen is obtained by water electrolysis, considering an alkaline electrolyzer operating at 30 bar. Different electric sources are considered: grid, thermal power plant, wind energy. The economic analysis on the H2 production scheme reveals that each of the three main parameters for the determination of the H2 cost (electrolyzer capital cost, electricity cost and storage cost) can play the key role in the feasibility of the plant. Also, this research suggests that the hydrogen production cost is the most significant factor influencing the economics of this methanol process. The total specific power consumption of the methanol plant is equal to 113.4 kWhe/tnMeOH. Pérez-Fortes et al. [27] proposed an integrated MeOH CCU-plant and evaluated the MeOH economic and technical feasibility, by evaluating process conditions, mass and energy flows, environmental advantages due to raw material replacement compared to conventional processes, the total amount of CO2 that is not emitted and under which conditions the CCU production of MeOH is competitive with a traditional plant. Simulations of the process are carried out in ChemCad: carbon dioxide is obtained from a pulverized coal power plant, while the hydrogen by water electrolysis. Results show that in order to make the CCU plant financially attractive, the price of MeOH should increase by a factor of almost 2, or H2 costs should decrease almost 2.5 times, or CO2 should have a value of around 222 €/t, under the assumptions of this work. The results demonstrate that there is a net but small potential for CO2 emissions reduction. The carbon dioxide conversion in the catalytic reactor is equal to 22% and its needed amount is 1.46 t/tMeOH. Bellotti et al. [117] analyzed a process to produce methanol by capturing the carbon dioxide from a power plant and producing hydrogen from PEM electrolyzer. The work is related to MefCO2 H2020 European project. The power to methanol process is composed by water electrolyzer, carbon capture system using amine solution and methanol reactor. An economic feasibility study of the plant is carried out considering three different sizes (4000, 10,000, 50,000 ton/year of CH3OH produced) with W-ECoMP software and a sensitivity analysis is developed varying the methanol selling price, the oxygen selling option for industrial applications, capital cost of PEM electrolyzers. Results show that the PEM electrolyzer affects more than 75% of the total capital investment and a larger plant leads to higher capital investment, however allows for a lower pay back period. Kiss et al. [347] developed a new process to produce methanol by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, using the wet hydrogen available as by-product in the chlor-alkali production, as in Fig. 7 . The process is simulated in Aspen Plus using the RK-Soave and the NRTL thermodynamic model, using a packed bed reactor for the methanol synthesis. The key feature of this novel process is the use of a stripping unit where the wet hydrogen (saturated with water) flows in counter-current with the condensed mixture methanol–water resulting from the flash separation after reaction. In this way, COx is removed from the methanol-water mixture allowing a complete recycle of CO2, while also removing water from the wet hydrogen stream (initially saturated with water) thus avoiding the negative impact on the reaction equilibrium conversion. A Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalyst is used and the process produces 100 kton/year of methanol with a yield of 99.83%. 1 ton of chlorine leads to 28 kg of hydrogen that can be further converted into 149 kg methanol, using 205 kg CO2. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the effect of temperature, pressure and catalyst load on methanol yield. Due to kinetic limitations at lower temperatures versus equilibrium limitations at higher temperatures, an optimal operating region exists and this depends on the reactants ratio. The methanol formation is favored at higher pressure, because the CO2 hydrogenation precedes with a decrease of the total number of moles. The catalyst load improves the yield at lower temperature, where reactor operation is kinetically limited. The methanol plant can be integrated in further processes providing a hydrogen source. The coke oven gas (COG) produced by steelworks contains about 62% of hydrogen and the remaining is methane and organic sulfur compounds. Hydrogen then can be recovered. The lower calorific power of COG is equal to 18 MJ/m3. Harp et al. [118] developed a process integrating a methanol plant and steelworks, as shown in Fig. 8 . In the scheme, the following sections are present: a post combustion CO2 capture from the power plant flue gas, the PSA for hydrogen separation from coke oven gas and the use of the residual gas within the works gas grid, the water electrolysis and the methanol synthesis and its distillation for pure methanol. The oxygen from the water electrolysis replaces the oxygen required for the blast furnace which is supplied in the base case by the air separation unit. The recovered hydrogen by PSA is equal to 133 MWth. In addition to PSA process to recovery hydrogen from COG, membranes are under development. In China, the first plant integrating methanol production and steelworks has been realized, using PSA to recover hydrogen: at a purity level above 99%, a recovery rate of up to 90% is possible [119]. In an alternative scheme, the methanol plant is integrated with the biogas plant, as reported by Pedersen and Schultz [350] in Fig. 9 . In fact, from the upgrading of the biogas it is possible to separate carbon dioxide and methane that are fed to the methanol synthesis and the steam reformer to produce syngas, respectively. The obtained syngas is also fed to the methanol reactor. It is possible to feed additional hydrogen to the methanol synthesis in order to decrease the carbon dioxide molar fraction and increase the total number of moles. The hydrogen can be obtained by an electrolyzer. The oxygen so separated can be used as an oxidant for fuel combustion to provide heat for the endothermic steam reforming reactions. To increase the carbon utilization even further, the two following concepts can be considered: addition of CO as with H2 to the effluent gas stream from the steam reforming, or reforming by partial oxidation (POX) of the biogas. Contrary to steam reforming POX is an exothermic process, which produces a CO rich syngas. Atsonios et al. [30] developed a new membrane reactor with high selectivity either for methanol permeation (organophilic) or for water permeation (hydrophilic), respectively. Methanol is produced according to the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide obtained by a power plant while hydrogen is obtained by the electrolysis of water in alkaline cells, as in the previous work by Atsonios et al. [29]. Results show that the membrane has not influence on thermal efficiency but increases the methanol yield. This allows the reduction of the recycling gas flow rate, leading to reduced reactor dimensions and lower investment cost. The carbon dioxide conversion is equal to 30.5%, using alkaline electrolysis (KOH), a mature technology, for a large-scale hydrogen production [120]. An economic analysis shows that the methanol production costs are equal to 859.2 €/ton, 10% lower compared to other power-to-methanol processes. Few works are reported regarding the – co-electrolysis of carbon dioxide and water, then through the electrochemical way of production. Ignoring other considerations, steam electrolysis could be a more logical choice for medium temperature Fe catalysts, while co-electrolysis more logical for low temperature Co catalysts. There are significant advantages in electrolyzing steam and CO2 simultaneously: lower cell resistance and reduced possibility of further reduction of CO to C. Al-Kalbani et al. [10] presented two different processes to produce methanol by the hydrogenation of CO2 and its electrolysis at high temperature, according to the emission-to-liquid (eTL) process, that directly consumes CO2 as a reactant and at the same time produces useful liquid fuels compatible to the current energy infrastructure. The processes are simulated and analyzed using Aspen HYSYS. In the hydrogenation, carbon dioxide reacts with hydrogen obtained by the water electrolysis, while in the eTL processes carbon dioxide and water are subjected to simultaneous electrolysis. Using the Aspen Energy Analyzer (AEA) and the heat exchanger network simulator (HEN), the two processes are optimized and compared in terms of energy requirements and climate impact. Results show that high temperature electrolysis determines the lower energy demand compared to hydrogenation system. The energy efficiency of electrolysis if equal to 41%, almost double of the hydrogenation process. In addition, the eTL processes determine more severe carbon emissions than those linked to the conventional methanol production if natural gas or coal are used as energy sources. The purification unit allows to have a methanol purity equal to 99.5% w/w. The work suggests some energy recovery strategies: the heat released by the methanol reaction can be used to produce electricity with a Rankine cycle. The heat integration is performed using pinch analysis to determine the minimum heating and cooling utilities required by each process: the energy consumption for the production of 1 ton of methanol is reduced from 91 to 88.7 GJth. Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is also an attractive way because allows the direct use of solar energy, even if it is limited to lab-scale studies due to the slow kinetics with extremely low efficiency [121]. A photo-chemical reactor for the carbon dioxide reaction to methanol production is analyzed by Ampelli et al. [122]. However, electrochemical and photochemical conversion, less developed, may be more efficient and emit less CO2. A comparison of the different processes to produce methanol is developed by Gai et al. [123], where a co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O with a F-T reactor, a photocatalytic reactor for CO2 and H2O, an electrocatalytic reactor for CO2 and H2O are analyzed. In particular, the overall NZCE (near-zero-carbon-emission) power plant using CO2–CH3OH circulation as the working medium is simulated and analyzed with particular focus using Aspen Plus software. In the co-elettrolysis of CO2 and H2O an electrolysis cell developed by Saekiused uses a tetrabutylammonium salt to promote the CO formation at 40 bar and 2.3 V. Then a F-T reactor is used to transform the produced syngas into methanol. For the photocatalytic reactor, an illuminated monolithic reactor (IIMR) and the photocatalyst BiVO4 operating at 40 bar and 293 K can produce carbon dioxide conversion to methanol. In the electrocatalytic reactor the reactor behaves as an electro-catalytic cell with a proton exchange membrane to separate CO2 and H2O into two independent compartments. O2 is generated in the H2O compartment and discharged. The products mixture will be distilled to get pure methanol. The results suggest that the energy consumption of methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2O through photo-catalysis is lower than other routes. An NZCE power plant can reduce CO2 emission of 3.8 × 106 ton/year while supplying the electricity of 5.87 × 106 MWh/year. Steinberg [124] developed a new process to produce methanol by absorbing the carbon dioxide from ambient air. A solution of KOH is used to absorb CO2 from air forming an aqueous solution of K2CO3; the solution is then electrolyzed using the electrical power produced in a power plant to produce CH3OH and form again the KOH solution. CH3OH is then removed by stripping, and make-up water is added prior to repeating the aforementioned steps. Other products such as formaldehyde, oxalic acid and glycollates are also formed during the electrolysis and can be separated and recovered as valuable products. In this scheme, 1000 MWe of nuclear power reactor could produce 828,000 gallons per day of methanol which would require the conversion of 3750 tons/day of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Matzen et al. [125] analyzed a process to produce methanol using the carbon dioxide obtained by the fermentation of sugar to ethanol. Wind energy is used for the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. A design and simulation are carried out with Aspen Plus software. The energy efficiency of this process is compared with coal and biomass based syngas processes. Table 3 reports the main operating parameters for the analyzed processes, while Table 4 the corresponding production costs of methanol. Table 5 summarizes the literature sources examined in this work regarding methanol production by means of different technologies. The processes for methanol production are evaluated with several energy efficiency parameters. Milani et al. [126] proposed the following parameter (see Eq. (23)): (23) E n e r g y i n t e n s i t y = T o t a l t h e r m a l e n e r g y d e m a n d P r o d u c e d M e O H in GJ/ton MeOH, where the total thermal energy demand in MeOH synthesis is calculated by summing all consumed thermal utilities (e.g. heating and cooling, excluding heat integrations). The energy efficiency of different processes, η, is defined as the ratio of energy output to energy input, and is evaluated using the following equation (see Eq. (24)) [127]: (24) η = L H V M e O H N M e O H ∑ i , R Q i n + ∑ i , R N i , R L H V i , R where Qin is the heat input to the system. Considering the presence of syngas as reagent and its production from natural gas (NG), a thermal efficiency (Eth) is calculated according this relation (see Eq. (25)) [105]: (25) E t h = L H V o f m e t h a n o l L H V o f f e e d N G As an alternative, carbon efficiency (Ceff) can be used as a measure of energy efficiency, according to this relation (see Eq. (26)) [105]: (26) C e f f = t o t a l m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n m e t h a n o l t o t a l m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n f e e d N G With reference to methanol production from CO2, additional efficiency indexes may be for instance the CO2 consumed, in kg for unit of methanol production and in energy terms, methanol LHV for each kg of CO2 consumed. Since methanol has the lowest ratio between production cost and selling price among the fuels that can be potentially produced from CO2, it is the most representative product of the so called “Power-to-Fuel” concept [29,30]. Additional reasons for choosing methanol as the target product are its superior combustion properties, the relatively simple industrialization of its production process, and the fact that it is a product much easier to get in an electro-catalytic reactor than other long chain hydrocarbons or alcohols. Methanol reactor will be revised in the respective and following sections."
3,Dimethyl ether production,"Dimethyl ether (DME) can be produced by two different ways: the indirect route through the catalytic dehydrogenation of methanol and the direct route through the syngas in a single reactor with bi-functional catalysts. The first process is a simple conversion process, industrially mature. Compared with the methanol dehydration process for DME synthesis, the direct process allows for a higher CO conversion and a simple reactor design that results in much lower DME production costs. However, the separation process to obtain high purity DME is relatively more complex due to the presence of unreacted syngas and produced CO2 in the one-step synthesis process [128]. Also, the water–gas shift reaction consumes a stoichiometric amount of CO to form CO2 and hydrogen, so DME synthesis directly from syngas is not much suitable for commercialized purposes. Although the commercially proven technology for DME production is the dehydration of pure methanol, many researchers are working on the direct conversion of syngas to DME with dual heterogeneous catalysts: both catalysts are used in one reactor (bi-functional catalyst) to perform methanol synthesis and dehydration reactions simultaneously [64]. In literature, there are a few works about the production of DME by renewable energy sources. Azizi et al. [64] in their review present a scheme for the production of dimethyl ether by the direct and indirect way, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 . The overall reaction process is highly exothermic so, the temperature of the process should be controlled to avoid run-away. Operations of flash, distillation, absorption are used to purify DME and to eliminate H2, N2, CH4 and CO2. The separation of DME and CO2 becomes more difficult when methanol is present in the system, as in the indirect synthesis. Yuanyuan et al. [129] show that methanol and water resulting from the one-step reaction are first condensed and then absorbed in an aqueous solution; finally, the liquid stream containing DME is distilled for final DME product. Matzen and Demirel [130], propose a process to produce DME by the hydrogenation of methanol. A simulation of the process is developed in Aspen Plus using a follow-up of the methanol process described in a previous work [125]. The process utilizes 96.2 mt/day of methanol which is produced from 138.4 mt CO2/day and 18.6 mt H2/day obtained by the electrolysis of water. CO2 is produced as a byproduct of the fermentation of sugars into ethanol. 68.5 mt/day of 99.6 wt% DME are produced. A life cycle assessment analysis is carried out to compare the environmental impact of the two processes, producing methanol and DME. Results suggest that production of dimethyl ether impacts the environment more than methanol production, considering the human toxicity (HT), particulate matter formation (PMF), photochemical oxidant formation (POF), terrestrial acidification potential (TA) and climate change (CC) as impact factors. This reaction is usually catalyzed by alumina based catalysts in a packed bed reactor [131]. Typical reactor temperatures are around 523–673 K while pressure values can vary from 10 to 25 bar. Large scale DME production has been developed by the following companies: KOGAS, Shizuoka University, Air product. Haldor Topsoe [132]. Olah and Aniszfeld [348] realized a new process to produce methanol and DME using carbon dioxide and water (moisture) from air. The process comprises: removing water from atmospheric air by dehumidification of moisture therefrom; obtaining hydrogen from the removed water through a catalytic reaction; obtaining carbon dioxide by absorption or adsorption from the dehumidified ambient air; converting carbon dioxide thus obtained by suitable methods of reduction and hydrogenation under conditions suitable to produce methanol; converting methanol into dimethyl ether. Loescher [133] invented a new process to produce DME from methanol using a catalytic distillation reactor, providing energy saving and greater efficiency over conventional processes. An additional innovative process to produce methanol and DME is proposed by Olha and Prakash [6] using carbon dioxide obtained from air or industrial flue gases. Simulation of methanol dehydration process to DME was carried out by Bai et al. [134] with PRO II software, using an adiabatic packed bed reactor and two columns for products separation. The model is validated comparing numerical results with the outputs of an industrial plant producing 200,000 t/year of DME. The process scheme using a multistage adiabatic packed bed reactor was patented in China [135]. With the inlet operating conditions of temperature 533 K, pressure 1.2 MPa and flow 3540 kmol h–1, the reactor outlet conversion reaches 80%, and the DME yield is 1026 kt/a. Kansha et al. [136] investigated the feasibility of self-heat recuperation technology (the heat in the reaction product stream is exchanged with the heat in the feed stream) to the DME production process using the indirect method and developed an innovative process for DME production from an energy saving point of view, thereby considerably reducing the energy consumption of thermal and separation processes. In this case, the temperature and the enthalpy of the feed are adjusted integrating the heat of bottom and distillate streams using an adiabatic compression. All of the process heat can thus be circulated to the column distillation. The syngas used for the synthesis of DME can be obtained by dry reforming of methane, an alternative to steam reforming of methane [89,137,138]. Dry reforming of methane is a potential alternative for CO2 hydrogenation if the produced syngas can be converted into a fuel, preferably methanol or dimethyl ether [139]. This process is known as DMR-DME process and is emerging as a more sustainable DME synthesis process. The syngas from dry reforming has a value of H2/CO close to 1 useful for the DME production and not for the methanol production where this parameter is close to 2 [69]. Most literature studies about DME synthesis are found to be performed with CO-rich syngas in order to maximize the extent of the synergy effect [140–144]. However, this synergy effect might only enhance the performance of DME synthesis and not necessarily of the overall DME production process. In addition, most literature studies have only optimized the H2/CO ratio for the DME synthesis [140–142] and few studies compare the two routes as far as the overall performance of DME production is concerned [104,145–147]. Schakel et al. [16] analyze a process for DME production from dry reforming of methane. Carbon dioxide is captured by a H2 production unit at a refinery plant using methyl diethanolamine. Simulations are carried out in Aspen Plus. Results show that 94% of the captured CO2 is transformed into DME, only 9% of CO2 is produced in the entire process as a result of direct CO2 formation during DME synthesis and the combustion of syngas to provide the heat required by the dry reforming process. An environmental analysis is also developed: results indicate that climate change potential (CCP) (formerly the global warming potential, GWP in kgCO2eq) is reduced by 8% while it is 37% higher than process where CO2 is stored and DME is produced conventionally. The DME reactor is modelled with a Gibbs reactor at 79 bar and 523 K, using a catalyst based on Pd/ZnO/Al2O3. Luu et al. [104] compared the production of DME through dry methane reforming (DMR-to-DME) and through bi-reforming (BiR-to-DME: combined dry- and steam reforming), integrated with a coal fired power plant for the capture of carbon dioxide from the flue gas. The reaction for the dry methane reforming is the following (see also Eq. (27)): (27) 1 , 5 ⋅ C H 4 + 1 , 5 ⋅ C O 2 → 3 ⋅ H 2 + 3 ⋅ CO → C H 3 OC H 3 + C O 2 while the reaction for the bi-reforming is the following (see also Eq. (28)): (28) 1 , 5 ⋅ C H 4 + 0 , 5 ⋅ C O 2 + H 2 O → 4 ⋅ H 2 + 2 ⋅ CO → C H 3 OC H 3 + H 2 O Results show that the H2/CO ratio might not be sufficient for a preliminary evaluation on the performance of DME production. Because if one uses this indicator to select between DMR and BiR, DMR would be a better option, as it has an optimum H2/CO ratio for DME synthesis. However, by evaluating the overall process performance using the proposed metrics (methane intensity as tonCH4/tonDME, energy intensity as GJ/tonDME, CO2,emissions intensity as tonCO2/tonDME) it is found that BiR-to-DME is actually a slightly more attractive route. Li et al. [148,149] analyzed a process to produce DME by pyrolysis and gasification of corncob. In particular, the direct conversion of biomass-derived syngas to dimethyl ether (DME) at pilot-scale of 100 t/a was carried out in a fixed-bed tubular reactor over Cu/Zn/Al/HZSM-5 catalyst. The effects of gasification, synthesis temperature and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of bio-syngas on DME synthesis are investigated with the corncob feed rate of 45–50 kg/h. The results show that H2/CO ratio of the obtained bio-syngas is around 1, while the CO conversion is 75.2%. Werle [150] proposed an innovative process to produce DME by the gasification of sewage sludge, a solid, semisolid or liquid residue that results after the treatment of waste water. An analysis of the process is developed. Results show that: the operating conditions (amount of the gasification agent) of the sewage sludge gasification process greatly influence the syngas composition distribution; taking into consideration the LHV of the gasification gas, the optimum value of the air ratio (the amount of air per unit mass of fuel) is equal to 0.18 corresponding to the maximum value of LHV of the producer gas; the yield of the main producer gas components, CO, H2 and CH4, is enhanced by increasing the gasification agent, temperature and the oxygen concentration in the gasification agent. Peral and Martín [151] developed a process to produce DME and power by gasification of switchgrass. A structure is proposed embedding two different gasification technologies, direct and indirect, two reforming modes, partial oxidation or steam reforming, gas cleaning, and composition adjustment. Next, DME is produced following direct synthesis. The unreacted gas can be either recycled or used within a Brayton cycle for the simultaneous production of DME and power. If the starting biomass is an organic trash, manure or sewage, an anaerobic digestion can be integrated into a pyrolysis system to generate a CO2 and CH4 stream that in turn produces DME. Kralj and Hosnar [152] replaced an existing methanol plant with a DME plant by using a biogas as a source. The existing methanol plant was no longer profitable so was replaced by a plant to produce DME by making small modifications. Simulations of the process are carried out in Aspen Plus. The modified plant would produce 88% of DME and 12% of methanol from biogas, which contains 75% of methane, 23% of carbon dioxide and 2% of hydrogen. The indirect production of DME is via the catalytic dehydration of methanol over an amorphous alumina catalyst treated with 10.2% silica. The modified process would be operated with 2,800,000 €/year of total profit. The production of DME by biogas is also reported by Allegue and Hinge [153]: the syngas that produces DME is obtained by bio-methane. In order to further enhance the sustainability of the DMR–DME process, utilization of solar thermal energy for the DMR step becomes a subject of primary technological interest. As the reforming temperature range usually exceeds 1073 K, solar contribution is only achievable via sun-tracking concentrated solar power (CSP) collectors. Overall, the integration of solar thermal and DMR–DME yields two desirable outcomes: the utilization of captured CO2 as part of the carbon feedstock and the utilization of carbon-neutral solar energy. Few works are present in literature about the DMR-DME processes and most of them are at experimental and model validation level [154–156]. Luu et al. [104] also developed a process scheme for the production of DME integrating solar energy and dry reforming of methane. The solar energy is used to irradiate the dry methane reformer (DMR). Three process configurations are proposed, as in Fig. 12 . The first case is chosen as a bench-mark for evaluation and comparison; in this case syngas production is accommodated by a DMR reformer using natural gas as the only fuel to drive the reforming reactions. In the second case, is the solar reformer with WGS integration (SoR-WGS) and in the third case is solar and non-solar reformer coupling (SoR-NSoR). The SoR utilizes DMR reaction while the NSoR might either use SMR, BiR or DMR. The schemes are developed in order to have a H2/CO ratio equal to 1, for the DME synthesis and are simulated in Aspen Plus. Results show that the SoR-WGS configuration produces the best performance: values of 18.7%, 32.2% and 20% are obtained for methane intensity (the ratio between the total methane input and the total DME production), energy intensity (the ratio between the total energy input and the total DME production x LHVDME) and CO2 emission intensity (the ratio between the total carbon dioxide emissions and the total DME production), respectively. The solar radiation is equal to 700 W/m2. An additional research study regarding the production of DME using solar energy is developed by Ardebili and Manenti [157], integrating concentrator solar plant (CSP), thermal energy storage (TES) and gasification of biomass. TES has an important key role in CSP plant: guarantees the possibility of applying this energy potential into gasification processes. In this way, steam for gasification is produced with stability and efficiency. A simulation of the plant is carried out with Aspen software. The ratio H2:CO for DME production is regulated by using a methane steam reforming reactor. A sustainable green process is developed. According to a novel method, DME can be synthesized from methane through a two-step process in which a methyl halide (usually CH3Cl or CH3Br) is prepared from the oxidative bromination reaction of methane in the presence of hydrogen halide and oxygen over a Rh-SiO2catalyst. In the second step, methyl halide is further hydrolyzed to DME over a silica supported metal chloride catalyst [158]. Dimethyl ether can also be produced through oxidative carbonylation of methyl bromide. The catalyst of this process can be either SbF5/graphite or metal oxide catalyst. The former produces methyl acetate as by-product while the latter produces methyl alcohol [159]. From the above researches present in the literature state of art, it is evident that there is still a lack of an entire research area regarding the economic aspects of the process. Moreover, improving optimization and scaling up of the one-step synthesis of DME should be considered. The most favorable CO/CO2 ratio in the feed stream has not been widely defined yet. DME reactors will be analyzed in the following sections."
4,Syngas production,"Syngas can be produced by carbon dioxide, in different routes. In this context, CO2 can be captured from ambient atmosphere or other chemical processes in order to reduce global concentrations to early industrial levels by means of electrochemical processes to produce syngas. In these cases, considering the high thermodynamic stability of the CO2 molecule in standard conditions, its dissociation can only be achieved through endothermic reactions requiring an external energy source. In addition to non-thermal atmospheric plasma, corona discharges [148,149], dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) [160–163], gliding-arcs [164,165] and plasma jets [36–38,114], thermal plasma [166], low pressure plasma [349,167] can be developed. These studies show that syngas can be obtained at low temperature, but with low selectivity towards highest added products, as alcohols or aldehydes, that can be improved using a heterogeneous catalyst [168,169]. Ozkan et al. [170] present a new method to produce syngas by CO2 and CH4 by means of an atmospheric dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) using Ar to generate more metastable species and stabilize the discharge. The transformation of carbon dioxide is carried out “on line’’, at the output of industrial chimneys instead of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere and hence increase the greenhouse effect. For these reasons, capture, transport and storage of CO2 are not required. Some parameters are evaluated: the CO2 and CH4 flow rates, the power supplied to the DBD and the nature of the carrier gas (Ar or He). In particular, power has a positive effect on carbon dioxide and methane conversion and in syngas production, with a linear increase. The energy efficiency of the CO2 conversion is estimated and compared with those of similar atmospheric plasma sources. The chromatography analysis shows that a good amount of CO is obtained for the production of syngas. Overall, the DBD reactor offers the best compromise between the high-energy efficiency and the treatment of a large carbon dioxide flow rate. Chawla et al. [171] analyzed the production of syngas by the carbon dioxide reforming of methane, finding the better catalyst for this reaction. The obtained syngas has lower value of H2/CO. In addition to thermal plasma, a water plasma torch at atmospheric pressure for the dry reforming of methane is developed by Ni et al. [114]. Compared to the previous plasma methods, water plasma has a significant characteristic of high activity, because H2O molecules are dissociated into H, OH and O radicals. Results show that, under optimum experimental conditions, the energy conversion efficiency reaches up to maximum value of 1.87 mol/kJ and the highest energy efficiency of 74.63% is achieved, which is higher than that of other plasma processes. Generally, the dry reforming process is also cheaper than other methods since it eliminates the complicated gas separation of end products [172]. However, in spite of potentially attractive economic and environmental incentives, dry reforming of methane has not reached commercialization level [137]. The main obstacle is that there are no commercial catalysts that can operate without undergoing deactivation due to carbon deposition [173,174]. Different metal catalysts such as Ni, Rh, Ru, Pt, Ir and Co supported on Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, La2O3 and CaO have been extensively investigated [175–177]. Dry reforming is a highly endothermic reaction that requires large amounts of energy [178]. The operating temperature are 1000–1200 K. The unavoidable water formation as the side product indirectly reduces the syngas selectivity and lowers the H2/CO ratio [179]. All of these problems must be overcome before dry reforming becomes applicable for commercial purposes. The conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to syngas, has gained considerable interest both experimentally [168,180] and theoretically [181,182]. The biogas, obtained by the anaerobic digestion of biomass, contains methane and carbon dioxide so can be processed to obtain a syngas according to a well-reported technological process called CO2 reforming of methane. Nickel catalysts are highly active for reforming reactions and their cost is much lower compared to noble metals. Mota et al. [183] examined the challenges for catalysts applied to dry reforming of biogas (activity, sulfur poisoning, carbon formation and sintering), in order to reveal the specific needs and responses for the reforming process. Liu et al. [78] proposed two different processes to produce syngas, as in Fig. 13 : in the first, CO2 is electrolyzed to produce CO, water is electrolyzed to produce H2 and then CO and H2 are mixed to obtain the syngas; in the second process, the simultaneous co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O in a single electrolyzer is developed. The results show that both processes can produce syngas at industrially important rates. CO2 electrolysis at 100 mA/cm2 and water electrolysis at 8 A/cm2 with about 1600 turnovers/s is developed. Also, the simultaneous use of novel NSTF catalysts and PEMs allows for water electrolysis at extremely high current densities. Additionally, the use of ionic liquid co-catalysts for highly selective reduction of CO2 to CO strongly suppressed the hydrogen evolution reaction. Repeated tests have shown long term performance of these systems with negligible degradation or loss of function in the novel components such as the anion-exchange membrane. The aim is to enhance the generation of syngas in these efficient and robust technologies for a variety of applications. Future optimization of the discharge parameters, such as the pulse duration and the pulse frequency, can improve the energy efficiency of the process and make it economically feasible. A similar study was carried out by Zhan et al. [184]: an energy-storage cycle to produce liquid fuels is CO2-neutral, similar to hydrogen utilization, and has the potential to be more efficient and easier to implement. Stoots et al. [185] studied experimentally simultaneous high-temperature electrolysis (co-electrolysis) of steam and carbon dioxide using solid-oxide electrolysis cells. The apparatus used for these tests is heavily instrumented, with precision mass-flow controllers, online dewpoint and CO2 sensors, and numerous pressure and temperature measurement stations. It also includes a gas chromatograph for analyzing outlet gas compositions. Results show that co-electrolysis significantly increases the yield of syngas over the reverse water gas shift-reaction equilibrium composition: the process appears to be a promising technique for large-scale syngas production. Pardala et al. [186] developed an innovative process at low temperature (near room temperature) to produce syngas by the electrolysis of carbon dioxide and water. An electrodeposition strategy for the preparation of copper substrate cathodes, coated with bimetallic zinc–copper films, obtained from deep-eutectic solvents plating baths is developed. The prepared bimetallic cathodes show electrochemical activity for syngas production in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium triflate, with yields of 85 N ml (normal microliter) cm−2 C−1/170 N ml cm−2 h−1, high selectivities, tunable H2/CO ratio and low energetic requirements. Another advantage is that syngas can be obtained at high pressure, reducing the costs of compression for downstream use and storage. Delacourt et al. [187] designed a new kind of electrolysis cell for the simultaneous reduction of carbon dioxide and water to syngas. The technology PEM is used and the operation temperature is equal to room temperature (298 K). A modified configuration based on the insertion of a pH-buffer layer (aqueous KHCO3) between the silver-based cathode catalyst layer and the Nafion membrane allows for a great enhancement of the cathode selectivity for CO2 reduction to CO. Kleiminger et al. [188] used micro-tubular solid oxide electrolysers with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte for the co-electrolysis of carbon dioxide and water to produce syngas. Zhao et al. [189] used for the first-time room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes for the electrochemical reduction of high-pressure CO2, without other carbon-based reagents, due to their wide electrochemical windows, high solubility for CO2 and reasonably good intrinsic ionic conductivities. In fact, ionic liquid can absorb carbon dioxide both physically and chemically with the possibility to capture and convert carbon dioxide into valuable chemical products [186]. Similar studies with ILs were carried out by Di Meglio and Rosenthal [190] and Medina-Ramos et al. [191] and Asadi et al. [192] where the control of the H2/CO ratio is achieved by the tuning applied potential. Other literature contributions about this route are reported by Masel et al. [193] and in general the simultaneous dissociation of carbon dioxide and water is still limited [194,195] and can be explained by the chemical complexity of these molecules. These studies are limited to vary external parameters to maximize the process performance, while the interplay between the dissociation of water and carbon dioxide received less attention from both physical and chemical perspective. Chen et al. [75] propose a new method to convert carbon dioxide and water vapor into syngas using pulsed surface wave sustained microwave discharge. The influence of the gas mixture ratio, the specific energy input (SEI), Espec, and the feed flow rate on H2 and CO production, is studied. Syngas with a ratio close to 1 can be produced when CO2 e H2O ratio in the gas mixture is 50:50. The optimum SEI for H2 and CO formation for this gas mixture ratio is 1.6 eV/mol. Increasing the feed flow rate, reducing the residence time, hinders the H2 yield while the CO yield initially decreases and reaches a stable level. The highest energy conversion efficiency is obtained at low SEI and flow rate. Optical emission spectroscopy measurements show that comparatively high dissociation rates correspond to low gas temperatures. This kind of process, compared to a DBD discharge, presents no limitation of the discharge gap and hence it can be adopted for industrial use at a later stage. Microwave-assisted dry reforming over carbon catalyst is a combination of catalytic methane decomposition and CO2 gasification producing syngas. It is an alternative to steam reforming of natural gas [196]. In this context, Seung Chul et al. [197] propose a new method to produce stable syngas at 1073 K–1223 K by methane decomposition and carbon dioxide gasification with activated carbon (AC). With a CH4/CO2 feed ratio of 1 or less, both reaction rates remain nearly constant with time, while the CH4 decomposition rate decreases significantly at higher ratios. As the CH4/CO2 ratio increases from 0.3 to 3, the weight loss of AC decreases from 28% to less than 1% under the reaction conditions investigated. Even though the CH4 decomposition rate is close to or greater than the CO2 gasification rate, the H2/CO ratio in the product gas is less than 1. A different strategy proposed in the literature to produce syngas is the chemical looping process: carbon dioxide is purified and subsequently converted by changing the environment of catalyst within the reactor system [198]. Within the closed-system, the catalyst experiences unsteady-state reaction conditions. The fundamental concept of the process is based on the conversion of metal oxide sorbent to metal carbonate by in situ removal of flue gas CO2 where calcium-based materials are typically used as the sorbent, according to the following reactions that occur in the carbonator (see Eq. (29)) and in the calciner (see Eq. (30)), respectively: (29) CaO + C O 2 ↔ CaC O 3 (30) CaC O 3 ↔ CaO + C O 2 The major general challenges of such processes are the required complex engineering, material resistance and drastic temperature changes for catalyst regeneration. Generally, this technology requires an additional reactor for CO2 transformation unless the two conversion steps of CO2 to CO and H2 oxidation to H2O are combined in one process as demonstrated by Kuhn using perovskite-type oxides [199]. The approach is promising although further material and process improvements are required to convert CO2 to CO efficiently as reported in this context by Duyar et al. [200]. According to this technology, Bobadilla et al. [201] developed an effective technology that captures and reduces carbon dioxide (CCR) in one process, using a dual-function catalyst material. Two steps are present in this process: capture of CO2 on a storage component of a catalyst and release of CO2 or direct catalytic reduction of stored CO2 by reducing gas and catalyst regeneration, operated alternately and isothermally. The catalyst consists of earth-abundant chemical elements (FeCrCu/K/MgO–Al2O3). Diluted CO2 streams common in process flue gases, even containing oxygen and water, are fed to the process and relatively pure product streams such as syngas are produced. A scheme of this process that allows a continuous and complete CO2 capture and reduction to syngas in one process using multiple reactors is present in Fig. 14 . The captured carbon dioxide can be used to regulate the H2/CO ratio during syngas production; In fact values ranging from 1 to 2 are most desirable to produce liquid hydrocarbons including alcohols, methanol, fuels. Ebrahimi and Rahmani [202], developed a carbonate chemical looping where carbon dioxide is captured to reduce the greenhouse gases and is supplied to existing syngas plant to reduce the H2/CO ratio at values equal to 1. Syngas is produced by steam methane reforming and water gas shift. A simulation of the process in Aspen Plus is developed and a study about the influence of pressure shows that an increase of the pressure from 10 bar to 20 bar causes an increase of fuel consumption rate equal to 7%. Other parameters as fuel, CaO circulation rate, the excess steam and power increase linearly with the capacity of the plant. In particular, a 50% increase in the capacity of the plant causes a 100% increase in flue gases flow rate, however only 49% and 50% increase in sorbent material (CaO) and excess captured CO2, respectively. In the carbonate looping, it is possible to capture 60 g CO2/kg by MEA, 13.2 CO2 g/kg by silica gel adsorbent, 88 g CO2/kg by activated carbon adsorbent, and about 700 g CO2/kg by modified CaO [203]. A scheme of the carbonate chemical looping is shown in Fig. 15 : the fuel gas from the burner side of a steam reformer is sent into first reactor where CO2 reacts with CaO (carbonator) to form CaCO3 and it is separated from other gases (H2O and N2), while a rich CO2 stream is obtained from CaCO3 in the second reactor (calciner) [204]. Two steps are then present: carbonization and calcination step. The CO2 rich gas is extracted in a cyclone to recycle the CaO stream to the first reactor. In a similar field, Bassani et al. [205] proposed a novel Acid Gas To Syngas (AG2STM) technology to the gasification of solid fuels (coal or biomass), where H2S and CO2 are converted into syngas (CO and H2) by means of a regenerative thermal reactor. The process allows to reduce the environmental impact of coal uses and, at the same time, to improve the yield of coal gasification processes thanks to the innovative idea of coupling the reducing potential of H2S with CO2. Carbon dioxide is captured downstreams of the gasification process through Methyl DiEthanolAmine (MDEA) solution and reduced by H2S to syngas improving the overall efficiency. The syngas production is improved by 1.4%. A multiscale mathematical model regarding the kinetics for the gasification of Sulcis coal, with 5–9% of sulfur content, by an updraft fixed bed reactor is developed. Compared to other kinetic model, the proposed model describes in a predictive way the devolatilization reactions with a lumped characterization of gas and tar released. The resulting process is more economically appealing with respect to the traditional Claus process and finds several application areas. Simulations are carried out using Aspen HYSYS software with Peng Robinson thermodynamic model. New researches regard the production of syngas using solar cells that efficiently convert carbon dioxide from air directly into synthesis gas, using only sunlight for energy source. Unlike conventional solar cells, which convert sunlight into electricity that must be stored in heavy batteries, the new device essentially does the work of plants, converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into fuel using in addition water. Following this research, a sun-to-liquid project is developed, where a solar thermochemical reactor is used for a thermochemical redox cycle of water and carbon dioxide to produce syngas. Concentrated solar radiation is then used as the source of high temperature heat to drive the endothermic reaction."
5,Methanol reactors,"Different reactors can be used for the production of methanol. For a gas phase technology, an isothermal or adiabatic reactor can be used. In addition, liquid phase reactors and membrane reactors can be used for this synthesis."
6,Adiabatic reactors in gas phase,"6.1 Adiabatic reactors in gas phase A quench reactor is composed by multiple adiabatic packed beds inside a pressure shell, as proposed by ICI (now Johnson Matthey) [206] in Fig. 16 . The operating conditions are 50–100 bar and 543 K, using a catalyst based on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 loaded in a single bed. The cooling gas is injected into the bed by means of distributors, called lozenges. The lozenges run horizontally across the converter from side to side and a central pipe is used to deliver the cold gas. However, the irregular flux distribution due to the refrigeration system and variable void fraction, determine hot zones, with catalyst deactivation, and cold zones, with low reaction rate, inside the bed. In this kind of reactor, the heat recovery is less effective and the conversion is lower but large capacities up to 10,000 t/d are potentially achieved. A different example is the Kellogg, Brown and Root reactor, with a series of adiabatic, fixed bed reactors [207]. The shape of the reactors is spherical with the catalyst loaded between the external wall and an inner spherical shell. The flow inside the reactor is radial, from the outer wall, through the catalyst layer and eventually into the inner sphere, providing lower pressure drops and then lower investment and operating costs. The reaction heat is removed by intercoolers and the fresh feed of syngas enters directly the first reactor, thus increasing the overall reaction rate and decreasing the necessary volume of catalyst with respect to other quench-type units. The system provides higher yields and smaller recycle stream compared to quench reactor. An Advanced Reactor Concept (ARC) is proposed by Casale, with quench-cooled converter, designed in collaboration with ICI [22]. The reactor is used for the revamping of an industrial plant, increasing the production rate by 20%. This technology has a very effective quench gas redistribution: the bed is separated into different sections by means of distribution plates. Haldor Topsoe proposes a Collect-Mix-Distribute reactor (CMD) with several catalyst beds separated by vertical support beams. The fresh syngas is fed at the bottom of the reactor and flows radially through the first catalyst bed. The gas exits at the top of the bed and is mixed with cold quench gas before being redistributed and forced to flow radially down through a second catalyst bed. The configuration of the reactor allows to increase the conversion and to control the temperature. The Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC) reactor, called MRF-Z® reactor, is a multi-stage radial flow reactor with intermediate cooling [208], as in Fig. 17 . Here heat is removed through the blade boiler tubes and the catalyst is loaded into concentric beds. An efficient heat recovery with the production of steam is obtained: the steam can be employed to produce the syngas and it is equivalent to about 50% of steam required for steam reforming of the corresponding syngas production for methanol synthesis. The production capacity of these reactors can be up to 5000–6000 t/d. The radial flow configuration allows to reduce the pressure drop across the catalyst bed by about one tenth of that experienced with axial flow configurations, thus the recompression of unreacted synthesis gas is more economical. Moreover, the reactor can be easily scaled-up increasing the height and maintaining the same diameter. In fact, the same pressure drop across the bed is experienced independently of the reactor height. Rahimpour [209] studies a two-stage catalyst bed concept for CO2 conversion to methanol. In the first catalyst bed, the synthesis gas is partly converted to methanol in a conventional water-cooled reactor. This bed is operated at higher than normal temperature and at high yield. In the second bed, the reaction heat is used to pre-heat the feed gas to the first bed. The continuously reduced temperature in this bed provides increasing thermodynamic equilibrium potential. In this bed, the reaction rate is much lower, and hence, the reaction heat as well. This feature results in milder temperature profiles in the second bed because less heat is released as compared to the first bed. In this way, the catalysts are exposed to less extreme temperatures and, catalyst deactivation via sintering is avoided. The two-stage catalyst bed system could be operated with higher conversion and longer catalyst life time than a conventional single-bed reactor. Thus, it is an interesting candidate for application in methanol production."
7,Isothermal reactors in gas phase,"6.2 Isothermal reactors in gas phase The Linde isothermal reactor has helically tubes inserted in the catalyst bed, providing indirect heat exchange, as in Fig. 18 . The cooling tubes allow to have the maximum possible reaction rate as well as the optimum temperature profile. This ensures higher productivity, increased catalyst life, fewer by-products, efficient reaction heat recovery and lower operating costs. Also, the configuration avoids the generation of stresses due to axial temperature variations and reduce the cooling area and the relative costs. Linde reactors can insure production capacities up to 4000 t/d. Isothermal reactors are also proposed by Lurgi, especially for large-scale plants in a fixed bed with shell and tube design [211]. The catalyst is loaded inside the reactor tubes while cooling water flows on the shell side. The configuration allows to have a good control of temperature producing high-pressure steam (40–50 bar). Typical operating conditions are in the range of 50–100 bar and 503–538 K. The high yields and low recycle ratios ensure a productivity of about 1200/1400 t/d. These kinds of reactors can also be combined in series. The first operates at higher space velocities and temperatures than a single reactor, thus achieving only partial conversion of syngas to methanol. It is also smaller than a single reactor and allows to produce high-pressure steam due to the higher temperatures enforced. The gas from the first reactor are fed to a second reactor, where it flows in the shell side in countercurrent with the cold fresh gas flowing inside the tubes. Capacity up to 3000 t/d can be obtained. Mitsubishi Gas Chemical (MGC) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry (MHI) developed an isothermal reactor named MGC/MHI Superconverter [212], as reported in Fig. 19 . It has double-walled tubes and the catalyst is loaded in the space between the outer and inner tubes. The gas is fed at the bottom of the reactor through flexible tubes and flows upward inside the inner shell of those tubes. At the top of the reactor, it turns downward and flows into the annular space where the catalyst is loaded. The cooling water, instead, flows outside the tubes. The system allows to maximize the reaction rate, so high conversions are achieved. In addition, the configuration guarantee safety and mechanical stability [213]. Plants producing methanol with this reactor technology are realized in Niigata (Japan) and Saudi Arabia with a capacity respectively equal to 520 t/d and 5000–10000 t/d. Casale SA developed an Isothermal Methanol Converter (IMC) in which the heat exchange surface is made of plates surrounded by the catalyst [22]. The cooling stream flows inside the plates. A control of temperature inside the reactor is obtained, so the optimal reaction rate is obtained. In particular, the temperature control is obtained by changing the saturated steam pressure according to the process requirements. This allows to ensure that the average life of the catalyst lasts longer. The reactor can be designed with a mixed axial–radial flow configuration, where the gas only crosses one catalyst bed producing pressure drops smaller than one bar. The recycle ratio can be adjusted to minimize syngas consumption independently of the level of activity of the catalyst. An Axial Steam-Raising Converter (A-SRC) employs a simple shell-and-tube design with axial counter-current flow. The syngas flows inside a number of catalyst-filled tubes. Water from the steam drum enters at the bottom of the reactor, vaporizes upon absorbing the heat of reaction and keeps the temperature under control. An alternative configuration is the radial steam-raising (R-SRC) converter, where syngas moves radially across a fixed catalyst bed on the shell-side of a reactor. As the syngas exothermically reacts to form methanol, tube-side water absorbs the heat of reaction and generates steam. The Tube-Cooled Converter (TCC) uses its feed stream to cool down the catalyst bed where the reaction evolves. The syngas flows down through the catalyst bed, thus transferring heat to the fresh feed flowing up inside the tubes. A gas phase fluidized bed reactor is developed by New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and the Petroleum Endowment Center (PEC) in Japan: the catalyst particles are fluidized by the fresh gas fed at the bottom. The temperature is controlled by cooling pipes that recover the heat of reaction at high pressure. These reactors ensure a good conversion, less pressure drop, elimination of diffusion limitations, good heat transfer capability and a more compact design [215]."
8,Liquid phase reactors,"6.3 Liquid phase reactors Liquid phase reactors, compared to other technologies, allow to obtain good efficiency with an optimal control of the temperature. However, higher deactivation of the catalyst is present due to sintering of copper crystallites [216,217]. Air Products developed a slurry liquid phase technology (LPMEOH™) (Heydorn et al., 2004): the catalyst is suspended in inert mineral oil allowing very efficient heat and mass transfer. Compared to tubular fixed bed reactors, operating and capital costs are lower. Heat transfer is also ensured by an internal heat exchanger. The system assures high conversion with low recycle. The capacity of the plant is up to 300,000 l/d. An additional system for methanol production is developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in NY (USA), via themethyl formate reaction pathway. The reactor operates at lower pressures (<5 MPa) and low temperatures. Conversions higher than 90% are obtained avoiding the recycle of unreacted gas. Catalytic Advanced Technologies, propose a liquid phase oxidative process using mercury(II) compounds and concentrated sulfuric acid [218]. The sulfuric acid acts as oxidant while the mercury as the catalyst. Methane is converted to methanol with 50% of yield and 85% of selectivity. Researches are in course regarding a stable, active and selective platinum complex ((2,2,-bipyridimine)PtCl2) for the oxidation of methane to methyl esters that will be converted to methanol. In fact, mercury and sulfuric acid are not environmentally safe. Pittsburgh University developed a co-current slurry reactor operating at lower temperature (373–473 K) [22]. Methanol is obtained by the hydrogenolysis of methyl formate with a conversion up to 90% and selectivity higher than 98%. The process is not easily scaled up because at the operating conditions the methyl formate is the limiting reactant. The production of methanol in liquid phase is also analyzed by Xu et al. [219]. The process is more efficient than the conventional methanol production processes using Cu/ZnO-based catalysts, due to the fact that it has several advantages over the conventional process, as thermodynamically favorable low temperature operation and efficient removal of the heat of reaction due to the large heat capacity of a liquid medium."
9,Membrane reactors,"6.4 Membrane reactors Membrane reactors allow the removal of products (methanol and water) from the reaction environment improving the yield and reducing the costs. In addition, the deactivation of the catalyst is reduced achieving a better quality of the product [220]. However, industrial applications of membrane reactors are not known. Sea and Lee use a membrane reactor permeable to water for the production of methanol from CO2 and H2. The membrane is based on a silica/alumina composite. The methanol yield is increased up to 150% compared to conventional reactors [221]. The increase in the yield and selectivity during the methanol production is demonstrated by Gallucci et al. [222] using zeolite membrane reactor. They find that CO2 conversion (XCO2 = 11.6%), methanol selectivity (SMeOH = 75%) and yield (YMeOH = 8.7%) at T = 479 K were higher than those obtained in a conventional reactor (XCO2 = 5%, SMeOH = 48% and YMeOH = 2.4%) at T = 483 K, P = 2 MPa, H2/CO2 ratio = 3 mol/mol and space velocity = 6000 1/h. Parvasi et al. [223] feed the recycle gas stream to a membrane reactor before mixing it with the make-up SG. An increase of 40% in methanol production is obtained. Rahimpour and Ghader [224] suggest a Palladium (Pd) based membrane reactor for improving H2/CO2 ratio inside the reactor. The model suggests a shell and tube reactor with pure hydrogen on the shell side and thin tubes of Pd. The methanol mole fraction seems to have increased with the decrease in the tube thickness and feed flow rate and higher hydrogen content and pressure. Farsi and Jahanmiri [225] use a Pd/Ag and alumina silica composite membrane layers for the permeation of hydrogen and the removal of water vapours from the reaction zone, respectively. The system allows to improve the yield of methanol of about 10%. Barbieri et al. [226] find that reactors with an organophilic (X = 22.7%, SMeOH = 60.2%, YMeOH = 13.7%) and hydrophilic membrane (X = 23.9%, SMeOH = 54.2%, YMeOH = 13%) have better performance than that of a conventional tubular reactor (X = 14.2%, SMeOH = 40.5%, YMeOH = 5.8%). The increase of methanol yield in a membrane reactor reduces the consumption of reactant and facilitates operation at lower pressures and higher temperatures. This, improves the reaction kinetics by reduction in the residence time and the reactor volume."
10,DME reactors,"Different reactors can be used for the production of dimethyl ether (DME): fixed-bed reactors, slurry phase reactors, fluidized bed reactors, coupled and dual type reactors, membrane reactors, micro reactors, coupling reactor and separation unit. The integrated systems are developed in order to reduce the capital and operating costs, increasing the energy efficiency [64]."
11,Fixed bed reactors,"7.1 Fixed bed reactors Fixed bed reactors are used due to the simplicity and lower costs at laboratory and pilot scale [227]. An optimum longitudinal profile of temperature is obtained along the reactor: a decrease of temperature is present from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor. The reaction rate is high near the inlet of the reactor while conversions are high at the outlet [228]. The DME reactor operates with a high syngas recycle rate in order to avoid temperature rise that might further result in a lower per-pass conversion as well as larger capital investment and operating costs [229,230]."
12,Slurry phase reactors,"7.2 Slurry phase reactors Due to lower investment costs and better heat transfer, slurry phase reactors are used for large scale DME production. For DME synthesis, syngas should be transferred from gas bubbles to liquid phase solvent and then to catalyst particles. There are several limitations in mass transfer between phases that decrease the reaction rate. Even if the control of temperature is better compared to adiabatic fixed bed reactor due to the large heat capacity of the solvent, some disadvantages are present [231–234]. In addition to the main reactor body, a recycling system and solid-liquid separator are needed making the overall system more complex [228]. Also, the loss of catalyst particles limits the use of the reactor for DME production [232,233,235]. Increasing pressure and catalyst concentration can contribute to enhance the reactor performance [236]."
13,Fluidized bed reactors,"7.3 Fluidized bed reactors Fluidized bed reactors are developed at the laboratory scale, and their feasibility has not yet been established in industrial applications [237]. However, they are proposed as optimal reactors for the production of DME. Fluidized bed reactors show better heat removal characteristics thanks to freely moving catalyst particles in the bed. Due to the intensive mixing and small size of catalyst particles, gas–solid mass transfer resistance decreases, achieving an excellent temperature control, although with loss of catalyst because of fragmentation and elutriation. An advantage of the system is to obtain high conversion without the need for recirculation and under moderate operating pressure [228]."
14,Coupled and dual type reactors,"7.4 Coupled and dual type reactors In this system, the exothermic reaction becomes the heat source for the endothermic reaction [238–241]. In the dual-type reactor, proposed by Vakili et al. [242,243], shown in Fig. 20 , the cold feed enters the tube side of the second reactor and is preheated by the reacting gas that flows in the shell side. The boiling water in the shell side of the first reactor absorbs the heat of exothermic reactions and produces steam. This reactor configuration is able to produce 60 t/day of DME, more than a conventional plant. In addition, the production costs are reduced because separate units for methanol production and purification are not needed [244]. Results of this study show that the counter-current configuration in the second reactor is better than a co-current mode owing to more DME production rate. A similar study suggests that changing the molar flow rate of the exothermic side could control hot spots in the aforementioned thermally coupled heat exchanger reactor [243]. Khademi et al. [238,239] developed a system for simultaneous production of DME and cyclohexane dehydration. The reactor has two different zones for the exothermic and endothermic reaction. Catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene takes place in the shell side, while methanol dehydration to produce DME occurs inside the tubes with fixed beds of different catalysts on both sides. Heat is transferred continuously from the exothermic to the endothermic reaction zone. The efficiency of the process is increased due to the short distance of heat transfer [245,246]. A similar scheme is developed by Skinner et al. [247] coupling the DME production and the ethanol dehydration to ethylene."
15,Coupling the reactor and the separation units,"7.5 Coupling the reactor and the separation units An additional integrated process is obtained with the catalytic distillation (CD) or reactive distillation (RD) combining the operation of distillation and reaction. Moderate temperature and pressure (313–453 K and 800–1200 kPa, respectively) are involved, but most of the catalysts previously studied for this reaction are solid-acid catalysts (e.g. zeolites) which tended to be active at higher temperatures (about 523 K). Some advantages are: higher selectivity toward DME, higher conversion, lower operation costs with respect to a single reactor [248,249]. Innovative solutions to overcome the drawback of high-energy consumption in distillation units are thermally coupled distillation columns [250], dividing-wall columns (DWC) [249], heat-integrated distillation or cyclic distillation [251]. A different process scheme is the reactive dividing-wall column (R-DWC) where DME is obtained by the dehydrogenation of methanol [70], as shown in Fig. 21 . The process has better performance compared to the conventional one or the reactive distillation process: energy savings of 12–58%, up to 60% reduced CO2 emissions and up to 30% lower total annual costs. For these reasons, the novel R-DWC process can be considered a promising alternative for the production of high-purity DME in new, as well as revamped, industrial plants."
16,Micro-reactors,"7.6 Micro-reactors A new alternative for the production of methanol is represented by the micro reactors where the reaction takes place in sub-millimeter channels, providing a high surface-to-volume ratio and a short distance to the wall, thus enhancing heat and mass transfer rates greatly [252,253]. The microstructure also offers easy control of the reaction conditions owing to a small holdup value which allows for partial or total elimination of hot spots by avoiding thermal run away, laminar flow behavior, compactness, and parallel processing [254]."
17,Membrane reactors,"7.7 Membrane reactors The removal of water during methanol dehydration by means of a membrane can reduce water promoted catalyst deactivation and enhance DME productivity [255], so membrane reactors are recently developed. An optimal flux of water through the membrane is determined, varying the sweep flow rate, to avoid undesirable products as HC. The most used membranes are amorphous silica, F-4SF, ZSM-5, MOR, SIL, and polymeric membranes [256,257]. However, they still suffer from pore-blockage, thermal, and mechanical instability; the dilution caused by the need for sweep gases has limited the usefulness of the membrane reactor systems [258]. Several experimental and theoretical studies show the advantages of membrane reactors. Mardanpour et al. [259] developed a model for a shell and tube fluidized bed membrane reactor in order to synthesize dimethyl ether: hydrogen permeates along the reactor for a better performance and efficiency. Iliuta et al. [260] evaluated the use of glycerol, a source of syngas, to produce DME in a dual bed membrane reactor involving the endothermic catalytic glycerol reforming and exothermic DME synthesis process, as in Fig. 22 . The thermal efficiency is improved and the costs of syngas production inside the DME production unit are reduced. In order to enhance productivity, the DME synthesis process operated at high CO2 feed conditions, the reactor had the capability to remove water from the system by means of a hydrophilic membrane tube placed in the center of the reactor [261]. Volkov et al. [257] studied the dehydration of methanol to DME on theF-4SF/ceramic catalytic membrane reactor. The authors related the reactor behavior to the strong adsorption of methanol and the production of water within this temperature interval. Hence, to prevent deactivation of the catalyst and to improve methanol conversion, it was proposed that the rate of alcohol desorption should be increased and also selective removal of water from the reaction zone should be provided. In addition to chemicals obtained by carbon dioxide and the respective used technology it is important to discuss about the policy, in particular about the carbon tax."
18,Carbon tax,"A CO2 tax is currently under discussion in the European Union and is proposed as one measure of financing the Union’s budget. Carbon tax is also adopted by several countries to achieve their reduction emissions goals encouraging the CCU processes [262]. In fact, the European Union energy policy develops the EU low-carbon roadmap milestone, which indicates for 2020, a 20% reduction in carbon emissions, and a 20% EU-wide share for renewables, and by 2030 a 40% reduction in carbon emissions and 30% EU-wide share for renewables [263]. The carbon tax is applied on all fossil fuels before combustion according to the carbon content of the respective fuel. Denmark, Finland, Italy (approved by law, however never applied), Ireland and Sweden are some of EU members that have already implemented a CO2 tax. However, none of these countries applies a uniform tax on all fossil fuel consumers and exempts some sectors from the tax. Tax rates vary from 13 €/tonCO2 in Denmark to up to 150 €/tCO2 in Sweden [264]. The value of the tax also varies from country to country, as shown in Fig. 23 where the price is expressed in ton of CO2 equivalent [265]. Related to this consideration, economists would argue that the carbon price must be kept at a minimum level while others would claim that without high carbon tax an immediate abatement or policy measures are difficult to implement. As marginal abatement costs are not known with certainty, the total amount of GHG emission abatement cannot be determined a-priori when introducing a tax. Additionally, the design and timing of suitable climate policy interventions, such as various carbon taxation, must be integrated with facilitating the development of low fossil carbon products and accelerating the transition to post-fossil carbon societies. By reducing fuel consumption, increasing fuel efficiency, using cleaner fuels and adopting new technologies, businesses and individuals can reduce the amount they pay in carbon tax. For these reasons, carbon tax offers an incentive to alternative energy and increase of the energy efficiency. In particular, the carbon tax makes processes using renewable energies economically feasible compared to similar processes using traditional fuels [266]. Higher carbon pricing levels can reduce the economic advantage for high carbon emitters [267]. In theory, when introducing carbon taxation, the product cost increase will dissatisfy the potential buyer. If the enterprise wants to keep their profit margin constant, it must improve production efficiency, product efficiency, decrease product cost, or a mix of all three. So, the producer must improve the product design and manufacture, lower the cost and improve the product's performance [268]. According to these considerations, it is evident that environmental agreements on a voluntary basis will tend to suffer from easy rider problems, and thus it will be difficult to realize the high potentials for joint environmental progress unless the social costs are increased or carbon taxes are imposed [269]. Economists believe that the external cost of emitting a ton of CO2 is far more than that of the private cost. This external cost is referred to as the social cost “These externalities are the basis for the idea of imposing a tax on carbon emissions or adopting a similar policy such as a cap-and-trade system” [270]. Then countries can improve the social efficiency imposing a carbon tax and it is necessary to find the correct tax level. In addition to carbon tax, in order to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions, the European Union developed the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) in implementation of the cap and trade system introduced internationally by the Kyoto Protocol for greenhouse gas emissions trading. Since 2005, the European Union has operated the EU ETS, which is recognized for its achievements in effectively reducing GHG emissions without undermining industrial competitiveness. Carbon tax and ETS may potentially result in similar emission reductions, and neither scheme seems to lead to lower emissions than the other [271,272]. To conclude the showed analysis, techniques for the capture of carbon dioxide are developed and presented in literature."
19,CO2 capture,"In CCS technologies, a variety of techniques may be used to capture CO2, including gas phase separation, absorption into a liquid, adsorption onto a solid, as well as hybrid processes (an adsorption/membrane system) [273–275]. Herzog and Golomb [276] define the three main separation processes as: - Absorption: the CO2 gas is absorbed in a liquid solvent by formation of a chemically bonded compound. Once bonded, the solvent is conducted to another compartment where it is heated to release the CO2. Then, the solvent is re-used for the upcoming cycle of the CO2 absorption process. - Adsorption: the process involves the selective uptake of CO2 onto a solid surface (solid sorbents), which is subsequently regenerated by lowering the pressure or increasing the temperature to release the adsorbed CO2. - Membrane system: the CO2 is separated from flue gas by selectively permeating it through a membrane material."
20,Adsorption processes,"9.1 Adsorption processes To avoid the disadvantage of liquid sorbents such as corrosion, solid sorbents have also been studied as an innovative concept for CO2 recovery. The dry solid sorbents can be divided into amine-based and alkali (earth) metal-based sorbents. The amines have been shown to physically or chemically bind CO2 and significantly enhance the sorption behavior [277]. The CO2 capacity of many amine-based sorbents have reached above 1.5 mmol/g. Low heat of regeneration is an advantage of amine-based sorbents over aqueous amines due to low heat capacity of solid sorbents. Nonetheless, these amine-based sorbents have poor mechanical property and thermal stability. Moreover, amine-based sorbents are synthesized with expensive feedstock materials and require significant amounts of solvents during the preparation processes. Li et al. [278] studied the tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) supported over polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS), mesoporous materials obtained via one-pot sol–gel method. The highest adsorption capacity of 3.98 mmol/g is achieved at 75 °C with 10 vol.% CO2 in the gas phase and in the absence of water vapor, a value higher than most amine modified adsorbents. Alkali earth metal, such as CaO can reversibly react with CO2 to form alkali earth metalcarbonate CaCO3 in the absence of water vapor at high temperature. To limit the degradation of sorbent morphology associated with sintering and to obtain stronger sorbent particles resistant to attrition, modified CaO-based sorbents have also been studied, including the use of hydrotalcites [279], nanomaterials [280], inert porous supports [277,281]. Future researches should be addressed to the development of inexpensive sorbent modifications in order to improve the efficiency and to realize a large pilot scale. Also, MgO-sorbents are studied due to lower energy required for the regeneration compared to CaO sorbents [282]. MgO is dispersed over MCM-41 [113], nanomaterials [283], layered double hydroxides (LDH) [284,285]. The MgO/Al2O3 sorbent for CO2 capture under low temperatures was also investigated in a fixed bed by Li et al. [36–38]. It was shown that with MgO loading of 10 wt.%, MgO/Al2O3 sorbent has a better CO2 capture capacity. Results show that the total CO2 capture capacities are equal to 0.97 and 1.36 mmol/g with water vapor concentration of 0 and 13 vol.%, respectively, at 60 °C with 13 vol.% CO2. The main reaction between CO2 and MgO is the formation of carbonate, while in presence of water vapor the carbonate could further react to form hydrous carbonates. Alkali metal carbonate, such as Na2CO3 and K2CO3 can react with CO2 and H2O and transform to alkali metal hydrogen carbonates salt (NaHCO3 or KHCO3) at low temperatures. Researchers have tried to develop the K-based sorbents supported on various supports, including activated carbon, as MgO, ZrO2, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, CaO, and zeolites [36–38]. Recently, K2CO3 with a hexagonal structure showed excellent CO2 adsorption reaction rate [286]. In these cases, it is necessary to avoid hot spots generated by the highly exothermic carbonation reaction and high superficial velocity; it is also necessary to reduce reactor size. To solve these problems, a fluidized bed is proposed for these kinds of sorbents [36–38]. Future researches should be addressed to the interaction between carbon dioxide and sorbents in order to optimize the sorption capacity; further work is necessary before to commercialize the fluidized bed CO2 capture systems."
21,Absorption processes,"9.2 Absorption processes Absorption process could be both physical and chemical. Solvents like rectisol, selexol and purisol are used for physical absorption, however chemical absorption is preferred owing to higher absorption capacity at low CO2 partial pressure [287]. Amines (MEA, DEA, MDEA, DIPA, AMP, PZ, EDA, TEPA, DETA, HAD, DMEA), blends (MDEA-DEA, AMP-PZ, AMP-DEA), ionic liquids, aqueous solvents (K2CO3, CaO, DMC), ammonia are used for chemical absorption. To be employed as an absorbent, a solvent should have the desired properties: high reactivity and absorptivity with CO2, high stability under extensive thermal and continuous chemical exposure, low vapor pressure, easy regenerability, low environmental impact and cheap to be used. The most used absorption process to capture carbon dioxide is amine based and the MEA is the most used solvent [288]. Compared with other solvents such as 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), secondary amines such as diethanolamine (DEA) and tertiary amines such as methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), MEA shows high reaction rate and high capacity for removing even traces of CO2. Piperazine (PZ)/cyclic diamines are used due to the good absorption capacity, higher resistance towards corrosion and degradation and lower regeneration costs [289]. Some advantages of chemical amine absorption are the high reactivity, low cost and good absorption capacity. However, this process also has some disadvantages, such as the uptake of water into the gas stream, which requires an additional drying process, the evaporation of water increases the energy demand and cost of the procedure and the degradation products will be harmful to both human health and the environment [36–38]. Different absorber configurations like packed bed, bubble column, spray column, rotating packed bed and tray tower are employed [290]. Ionic liquids (ILs) are commonly defined as liquids which are composed entirely of ions with a melting point of less than 100 °C. ILs have many particular properties, as extremely low volatility, broad range of liquid temperature, high thermal and chemical stability and tunable physicochemical characteristics. For these reasons, ILs are considered as a potential substitute of aqueous amine solutions for CO2 capture [291,292]. Bates et al. [293] reports the first functionalized IL with amine group in cation for its affinity to CO2. The results show 0.5 mol CO2 could be captured per mol of IL as two amines react with one CO2 mole to form the carbamate and the ammonium. However, the viscosity of ionic liquids is relatively higher than conventional solvents: the viscosities are in the range from 66 to 1110 cP at 293 to 298 K [294], determining problems in practical applications. The ILs are also expensive, have complex structure and high cost for preparation, compared to simpler solvents such as MEA or ammonia. There are lots of works about improving the CO2 absorption behavior [295–299], however, the chemisorption often has high capacity along with high absorption enthalpy, which means difficult desorption as well as extensive energy consumption for regeneration [300]. Researches should be carried out to improve the CO2 solubility and to reduce the costs. Zhang et al. [86,87,301] found that, when supported by porous SiO2, the CO2 absorption by [aP4443] [Gly], [aP4443] [Ala], [aP4443] [Val] and [aP4443] [Leu] almost reaches equilibrium within 80 min. The chemical absorption of CO2 by [aP4443] [Gly] and [aP4443] [Ala] is found to approach 1 mol CO2 per mol ILs, which is a factor of two greater than that reported above. In fact, the use of support on porous silica improves the rate of CO2 absorption respect to other viscous ionic liquids. A series of phosphonium ionic liquids ([P(C4)4] [Ser], [P(C4)4] [Gly], [P(C4)4] [Ala], [P(C4)4] [b-Ala], and [P(C4)4] [Lys]) with amino acids as anions [P(C4)4] [AA] were also synthesized [20,21]. Other works are related to synthesize ILs with particular structure in order to decrease their viscosity. Wang et al. [160,161,302] and Luo et al. [298,299] developed a series azole and phenolate based ILs with various basicity, it is interesting that the ILs' viscosities do not increase dramatically in the process of CO2 absorption. Yu et al. [303] and Jiang et al. [304] designed phosphorous based ILs with very low viscosity by tuning the symmetry of ILs, however, the increase in viscosity is inevitable in the CO2 capture process in this case. An efficient method for improving CO2 capture is reported by non-amine functionalized ILs [295,298,299,302], whose viscosity is less affected upon the uptake of CO2 because of the reduced formation of hydrogen bond both before and after CO2 capture. Tuning the basicity of ILs including enhancing the weaken interaction to increase capacity and weakening the strong interaction to decrease energy consumption, and designing the structures of functionalized portion to improve the absorption behavior is analyzed by Luo and Wang [305]."
22,Membrane systems,"9.3 Membrane systems Carbon dioxide is separated from flue gas by selectively permeating it through a membrane material. The membrane separation is the best available separation technique, when a high purity product is not desired as it is very economical compared to other separation methods [306]. The advantages of membrane separation are the absence of the demand for chemicals or solvents, the capability to rescale the process without large efficiency losses, the compactness, the modularity, the ease of installation by skid-mounting, the ability to be applied in remote areas (such as offshore), the flexibility in operation and maintenance, the lower capital cost, the lower energy consumption, as well as requirement of little chemicals compared to conventional separation processes [307,308]. The membrane will be one of the cost effective and environmentally friendly technologies for application in CCS technology in future. Pore size, porosity and wettability too play an important role in the efficacy of the CO2 separation [309]. Membranes could be classified into three types based on the method employed: non-dispersive contact via micro-porous membranes, gas permeation through dense membranes and through supported liquid membranes [290]. The first type of membranes has better mass transfer compared to dense membranes or supported liquid membranes. They have advantages over conventional absorption columns such as flexibility in operating conditions and types of membrane contactors that could be employed. No drag or dropping of solvent is observed as the gas and liquid phases are kept in different parts of the shell and tube heat exchangers. Since the entire mass transfer happens in the pores of the membrane, porosity and pore size affects the performance to a great extent [47,310]. Dense membranes are divided in ceramic and polymeric. Ceramic membranes exhibit high thermal, mechanical and chemical stabilities, which make them a better choice in the stringent conditions though they lose out on permeability and selectivity aspects which are better in polymeric membranes. Introducing inorganic materials into the polymer matrix is used to increase thermal stability of membranes. Efforts are also made to increase mechanical stability of these polymeric membranes by various means like providing appropriate supports, having the right composition, using modular design etc. In supported liquid membranes (SLM), also termed as immobilized liquid membranes, liquid is supported on the surface of a solid or could be filled inside the pores. The transport mechanism is solution-diffusion type. Though SLMs are yet to be commercialized to an industrial scale, promising results are reported in the lab scale [311–313]. Some commonly used solvents in SLMs include primary amines such as monoethanolamine (MEA), 2-amino-2-methyl-1-proponol (AMP), secondary amines such as diethanolamine (DEA) and tertiary amines such as methyl diethanolamine (MDEA), aqueous ammonia [314], selexol [315], rectisol [316] and fluorinated solvents [317,318]. Modification of polymeric membranes by adding carrier particles in the bulk has also captured the attention of researchers [319]. Separation efficiency of 82–88% is obtained with some of these membranes. The performance of membrane systems for separation depends on material properties, dimensions of the membrane, contactor design and the configuration of membranes like hollow fiber, mixed matrix, flat type etc. In addition, membrane materials used for CO2 separation could be broadly classified into two categories: porous and non-porous types. Non-porous membranes, also known as dense film membranes, are usually polymeric membranes. Several studies have been done on a variety of polymeric materials such as poly(arylene-ether), poly [1-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propyne], poly (dimethyl siloxane), polyether amine, polyimide, polybenzimidazole, polyvinyl amine, polyvinyl alcohol, polyaniline and polyacrylates [20,21,274,320]. Early research efforts in membrane processes are highly biased towards polymeric membranes, while the inorganic porous membranes are ignored [321]. Mixed matrix membranes (MMM), a combination of organic and inorganic membranes is also used for carbon dioxide separation. Mixed matrix membranes with other materials like zeolites [322,323], mesoporous silica [324,325], carbon molecular sieves [326], carbon nanotubes and metal organic frameworks are also reported. These types of membranes are slowly gaining attention of researchers worldwide and are proving to be the future of membrane based separation processes."
23,Other technologies,"9.4 Other technologies An innovative technology for the separation of carbon dioxide is the molten carbon fuel cells (MCFC). MCFC is an active technology for CO2 separation unit and electricity production [327]. In the fuel cell, the chemical energy of hydrogen is converted into electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction. At the anode, hydrogen is oxidized and CO2 and water is produced (see Eq. (31)), while at the cathode, oxygen is reduced with CO2 to produce carbonate ions (see Eq. (32)). In this way, carbon dioxide is separated by the cathode and concentrated in the anode through the cell reaction (see Eq. (33)). (31) A n o d e : H 2 + C O 3 2 − → H 2 O + C O 2 + 2 e − (32) C a t h o d e : 1 2 O 2 + C O 2 + 2 e − → C O 3 2 − (33) C e l l r e a c t i o n : 1 2 O 2 + H 2 + C O 2 , cat → H 2 O + C O 2 , an A scheme of the reactions is in Fig. 24 . Providing fuel gas with an addition of natural gas to fuel the anode, MCFC can also produce power. The high working temperature of MCFC offers advantages such as fuel flexibility, utilization of cheap catalysts, and the possibility of co-generation of heat and power (CHP) and fuel cell combined cycles (FCCC) operation with high efficiency [328,329]. Then the system allows to concentrate and separate the carbon dioxide, as capture system, and to produce electricity simultaneously. The aim is to separate as much possible of the cathodic carbon dioxide to the anode, in order to have a high carbon dioxide utilization and purity. Compared to other technologies for capturing of carbon dioxide, MCFC allows to concentrate the carbon dioxide and not only to separate this gas in addition to electrical production. Another technology used to capture the carbon dioxide is the cryogenic separation based on the compression and cooling of the heat transfer fluid. However, cryogenic separation is an energy intensive process relative to other capture technologies because of the high amount of energy required for gas cooling and compression [330]. Research on the performance of CO2 capture using cryogenic separation has been limited only to specific situations including high pressure feed streams such as natural gas treatment [331], CO2/O2 combustion cycle [332] and concentrated CO2 mixtures [333]. Hybrid system combining cryogenic separation and membrane is developed for a post-combustion carbon dioxide capture process [334]. This strategy mostly combines a first step of CO2 pre-concentration using membrane unit separation with a second step of CO2 concentration and compression at cryogenic conditions. Fong et al. [335] propose a membrane-cryogenic-adsorption hybrid capture process where the conventional multistage CO2 compression unit in CO2 capture systems is replaced with a cryogenic carbon capture separation."
24,Conclusions,"The use of CO2 as carbon-source for the production of fuels is an effective way to introduce renewable energy in the chemical industry value chain, to improve resource efficiency and to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Through hydrogenation of carbon dioxide mainly methanol, dimethyl ether and syngas can be obtained. Additional compounds that can be derived from CO2 are: methane, hydrocarbons, ethanol, formic acid. A different value of carbon fuel exergy content per mole of carbon is reported for these compounds. Methanol and dimethyl ether have the highest values, respectively equal to 693 and 685 MJ/kmolC. Methanol, dimethyl ether and syngas have the lowest value of hydrogen loss during the reaction, due to the water formation, respectively equal to 0.33, 0.25 and 0. For these reasons, methanol, dimethyl ether and syngas are analyzed in this review. Different process schemes are proposed in the literature regarding the production of methanol, dimethyl ether and syngas by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. Dry reforming of methane and the co-electrolysis of carbon dioxide and methane are interesting points that can be developed and discussed further. In addition, an analysis of different reactors used to produce methanol and dimethyl ether is carried out. Membrane reactors allow to have the highest efficiency. In the hydrogenation reactions, carbon dioxide is a waste that is valorized to produce a valuable compound. It can be taken from industrial wastes or from the atmosphere. Hydrogen, meanwhile, can be obtained by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy surplus (solar or wind energy). Different H2 sources can be biomass pyrolysis or steam/oxygen gasification processes, the reforming of biomass-derived products (for instance ethanol, methane, etc.) and the partial oxidation of light oil residues. Different systems can be used to capture carbon dioxide: adsorption systems, absorption systems, membrane systems, cryogenic systems and molten carbon fuel cells. Among absorption systems, ionic liquids have an important role and represent an innovative solution. Future researches should be regarding major integration of the processes in order to improve the energy efficiency, innovative sources of carbon dioxide and hydrogen and a major diffusion of these concepts in order to gain social acceptance. The introduction of RE into the chemical production chain thus opens new challenges and interesting research perspectives."
