0,Introduction,"In the atom economical and cost effective sustainable catalysis, one of the important aspects is separation and recyclability of the catalyst [1]. However, the reusability of the catalyst is the prime challenge in the homogeneous catalysis [2]. Therefore, in the industry, mostly noble metal-based heterogeneous catalysts were employed for the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, bulk materials, etc. [3] Nevertheless, in the greener prospective, replacement of expensive noble metal-based systems with the non-precious and abundant transition metal catalysts received increasing interest in both academia and industry [4,5]. Replacement of the hazardous and waste generating chemicals with the biomass derived renewable feedstocks is one of the key targets in the chemical research [6]. Although, approximately 75% of the carbohydrate biomass produced by nature, only 3–4% is utilized for the production of foods and chemicals. [7] Thus, for the synthesis of fine chemicals, employment of naturally available biomass carbohydrates as a raw material is one of the exciting areas of research [8,9]. Importantly, catalytic conversion of carbohydrates to a variety of glycols such as ethanediol, propanediol, etc. were well explored [10]. Therefore, in the greener and sustainable perspective, use of these diols to synthesize the value added products remains an attractive strategy. Quinoxaline scaffolds containing molecules have significant biological [11] and pharmacological properties [12]. However, in the traditional approach quinoxalines were synthesized by the reaction between reactive dicarbonyls with the diamine molecules [13]. Recently, some other methods were also developed for their synthesis by employing 1,4-addition, oxidative coupling, cyclization-oxidation reaction strategies [14]. Nevertheless, the usage of expensive reactive reagents, poor yields, harsh reaction conditions are the major issues for most of these processes [15]. Notably, applying alcohol dehydrogenative coupling strategy [16,17] there are several reports presented in the literature for the synthesis of quinoxaline molecules [18,19]. Inspired by these reports, we tried to synthesize these molecules through alcohol activation in the presence of a heterogeneous cobalt catalysts. In addition, imines are an important class of nitrogen containing molecules used for the synthesis of materials, fragrances, fungicides, pharmaceuticals, etc. [20] Commonly, they are synthesized from expensive as well as reactive carbonyls and amines in the presence of Lewis acids [21]. Therefore, alternative greener approach to access these molecules is highly desirable. Following the alcohol dehydrogenative coupling strategy, several reports are known for the synthesis of imines by the reaction between alcohols and amines [22]. As nitro compounds are one of the surrogates for amines, hence direct synthesis of imines from nitro compounds and alcohols is more attractive [23]. Notably, only a few reports [24], are known for the similar transformation under heterogeneous condition. Herein, we report a practically useful and reusable cobalt catalyst for the direct synthesis of structurally diverse and biologically relevant quinoxaline and imine molecules. To the best of our knowledge, heterogeneous cobalt catalyzed the greener synthesis of quinoxalines by the reactions between nitroanilines and diols is not reported yet."

2,Procedure for synthesis of Co-phen/C-T catalysts,"2.1 Procedure for synthesis of Co-phen/C-T catalysts Several nitrogen doped carbon supported cobalt nanoparticles were prepared by reacting cobalt precursor and phenanthroline (1:2 M ratio) in ethanol, followed by the addition of carbon powder (Carbon Black) to the resultant reaction mixture at room temperature. Then, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the mixture was pyrolyzed under inert atmosphere (Scheme S1). In literature, it is well known that the pyrolysis temperature has a significant impact on the nature and activity of the materials [25]. Hence, the pyrolysis of these materials was carried out at different temperature under N2-atmosphere to get the diverse types of cobalt nanoparticles."

6,Results and discussion,"We prepared a number of nitrogen doped carbon supported cobalt nanoparticles from various cobalt precursor and phenanthroline. To check the catalytic potentiality of these materials, initially we tested their activity for the synthesis of 2-methylquinoxaline. For this purpose, o-phenylenediamine and 1,2-propane diol were selected as the model substrates. At first, we screened several cobalt catalysts in this transformation, among them Co(OAc)2-Phen/Carbon-800 (Co-phen/C-800) displayed the superior activity (Table 1 , entries 1–5). Few heterogeneous materials by using different support (e.g. alumina, silica) and different metals (Mn, Ni) doping were also screened for the synthesis of quinoxaline. However, all these materials were less efficient compare to Co-phen/C-800 (Table 1 , entries 6–9). Nevertheless, the material without N-doping or cobalt content showed the poor catalytic activity; signifies the importance of nitrogen and cobalt within the materials (Table 1 , entries 11–12). Afterwards, screening of bases (Table 1 , entries 13–15), solvents (Table 1 , entries 16–18) and optimization of other reaction parameters (Table 1 , entries 19–24 and SI) were performed. Finally, the yield of 2-methylquinoxaline was reached to 96% in toluene by using 1.5 mol% of Co(OAc)2-phen/C-800 in presence of 3 equiv. of diol and 0.75 equiv. of CsOH.H2O at 150 °C within 24 h (Table 1 , entry 24). All the cobalt catalysts were characterized through various techniques such as X-Ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) etc. The powder pattern of the materials at different temperatures was shown in Fig. S4. The characteristic 2θ values of 43.44°, 49.30° for these materials advocated the presence of metallic cobalt and 31.72°, 37.01°, 42.41°, 59.88° 62.84° indicated the existence of the oxide of cobalt [26]. To get insight into the surface of the materials, XPS measurement was carried out. The XPS analysis of the materials, formed at 700, 800 and 900 °C disclosed the nitrogen content of 6.2, 2.7 and 2.3 wt%, respectively. Notably, the N1s plots for these materials exposed mainly three characteristic peaks at i) 396.9 eV for pyridinic nitrogen, ii) 398.3 eV for pyrrolic nitrogen or nitrogen coordinated to cobalt, and iii) 402 eV for graphitic nitrogen (SI, Fig. S6a) [25]. In addition, characteristic peaks of cobalt appear with binding energy of 778.5 eV and 793.8 eV, corresponds to Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2, respectively. Importantly, the satellite peaks at 786 eV and 802.4 eV also represent the oxidic nature of cobalt present in the surface (Fig. 1 a ). The TEM images of these materials disclosed the existence of CoO and Co3O4 which were uniformly dispersed over the N-doped carbon support. The average particle size of 17.53 nm and 18.2 nm was observed for the material at pyrolyzed at 700 °C and 800 °C, respectively. However, at 900 °C aggregation of the material lead to the larger particle size of 31.44 nm which indicate that growth of cobalt nanoparticle happened with increasing pyrolyzing temperature [27]. Importantly, presence of Co3O4 with well resolved lattice spacing of 0.24 nm for 311(Co3O4) plane was realized from the high resolution TEM images of the Co-phen/C-800 material (Fig. 1 b) [25]. Furthermore, the homogeneous distribution of the several elements such as Co, N, O and C in the material Co-phen/C-800 was recognized by the elemental mapping analysis using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) as shown in the Fig. S9. Additionally, BET analysis of the Co-phen/C-800 material was carried out which displayed the BET surface area of 59 m2/g and the average pore size of 1.4 nm. After achieving the optimum conditions (Table 1 , Entry 24) for synthesis of 2-methylquinoxaline, next, we moved to explore the scope of the present catalytic process by employing a variety of diamines and diols as mentioned in Table 2 . The reaction of 1,2-diaminobenzene with different diol molecules afforded the corresponding quinoxaline moieties up to 96% yield (Table 2 , 2a-g). Additionally, quinoxaline scaffolds were synthesized efficiently, by altering both of diamine and diol molecules (Table 2 , 2h-q). However, with diol having diphenyl or tert-butyl substitution lower yield of the desired product was observed (Table 2 ). In addition to that, two regio-isomers (Table 2 , 2t 1 and 2t 2 ) were obtained with an isomeric ratio of 1:1 (analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy) when unsymmetrical diamine and diol was used. 2-Methylpyrazine (Table 2 , 2u) also synthesized using this protocol from ethylenediamine with good yield. Next, we tested the potential of this catalytic system towards the coupling between nitroarenes and benzyl alcohols for the synthesis of imines. However, during the optimization process, for the coupling between nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol, CsOH.H2O displayed lower activity towards the imine formation (see SI). Hence, we again screened several bases, and among them, Cs2CO3 presented superior activity in this transformation (SI, Table S5, 88% yield). Afterwards, to check the general applicability of this process, several substituted alcohols and nitro compounds were employed (Table 3 ). Following this protocol, various imine molecules were synthesized in 61–96% yields (Table 3 , 3a-l). In addition alcohols containing naphthalene moiety or hetero nuclei also worked fine by employing this protocol (Table 3 , 3f-h). Gratifyingly, the reducible -CN group was unaffected during this transformation; demonstrated the selectivity of this catalytic system (Table, 3 l). After achieving the optimum conditions for the direct synthesis of 2-methylquinoxaline from 2-nitroaniline (SI, Table S6), we explored the potential of this catalytic system towards the direct synthesis of a variety of quinoxaline scaffolds from nitroanilines and diols (Table 4 ). Several mono- and di-substituted diol derivatives furnished the desired products efficiently (Table 4 , 4a-g). Additionally, a number of substituted 2-nitroanilines smoothly furnished the desired quinoxaline scaffolds up to 95% yield (Table 4 , 4h-i). Notably, substitution at the both of alcohols and nitroanilines effectively transformed to the quinoxaline molecules in 60–93% yield (Table 4 , 4j-q). To demonstrate the practical applicability of this protocol, we carried out gram-scale synthesis of various quinoxalines and imines, where up to 87% yield was observed (SI, Fig. S1). Then, we evaluated the green chemistry metrics for the preparative scale synthesis of 2, 3, 6-trimethylquinoxaline (2h) from 4-methylbenzene-1, 2-diamine. The calculated E-factor of 4.23, 81% atom economy, 66.42% atom efficiency, 100% carbon efficiency and 66.58% of reaction mass efficiency in this transformation clearly exposed the novelty and sustainability of this protocol. The significant advantage of the heterogeneous system over the homogeneous catalytic condition is the separation and recyclability of the catalyst. To test the recyclability of this system, we carried out the synthesis of 2, 3-dimethylquinoxaline from 2-nitroaniline and isolated the heterogeneous cobalt catalyst after the reaction. Remarkably, this heterogeneous system did not lose its catalytic activity significantly even after 8th catalytic cycle (Fig. 2 ). The yield of 2-methylquinoxaline dropped considerably when the reaction was carried out with acid treated Co-phen/C-800 catalyst (SI, Scheme S2). This experiment suggested that both Co-Nx and CoOx played a vital role in this reaction [28]. To understand these catalytic transformations using the heterogeneous cobalt system few kinetic experiments were carried out. The reduction of nitro compound follows either a direct route or condensation route depending upon the catalytic system [29]. Thus, in order to find which pathway was operating during the reduction of nitroarenes to anilines, a time dependent product distribution was carried out for the coupling of nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol (SI, Fig. S2). In this reaction formation of a substantial amount of azobenzene indicated the preferential involvement of condensation route. Afterwards, during the formation of 2-methylquinoxaline from 2-nitroaniline a time dependent product distribution study was carried out (SI, Fig. S3). Initially, a considerable amount of diamine was observed and the amount of diamine decreased steadily with the progress of the reaction. Subsequently, we performed a number of control experiments as mentioned in Scheme S3. During the reductive imination of nitrobenzene, at the initial time (0.5 h) formation of a significant amount of the azobenzene and azoxybenzene was detected (SI, Scheme S3). This study clearly specified the preferential involvement of condensation route in this transformation. Further to support this, an experiment between azobenzene and benzyl alcohol was carried out which smoothly delivered the desired imine molecule (SI, Scheme S3B). The conversion of nitrobenzene was quite low with only base which exposed the necessity of cobalt catalyst in this transformation (SI, Scheme S3C). Based on kinetic experiments, we proposed the schematic pathway for the formation of quinoxaline from the 2-nitroaniline molecule (SI, Scheme S4). The time dependent product distribution study showed the formation of a significant amount of diamine during the reaction which suggested that path 1 was more favourable. Nevertheless, the possibility of path 2 can not be ruled out. Initially, 2-nitroaniline was transformed to the 1, 2-diamino benzene. After that, condensation between the o-phenylenediamine and the in situ generated dicarbonyl lead to form the species R. Finally, intra-molecular cyclization of the species R provided the quinoxaline product. In addition based on literature reports an interaction mechanism was proposed for this system (SI, Scheme S5) [25]."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, we synthesized a number of N-doped carbon supported cobalt catalysts by varying pyrolysis temperature. The catalytic activity of these materials was tested towards the synthesis of 2-methylquinoxaline from o-phenelenediamine and among them, Co-phen/C-800 showed superior results. PXRD analysis revealed the presence of metallic Co and oxidic cobalt in these materials. XPS study disclosed that minimum nitrogen content in Co-phen/C-900 compared to Co-phen/C-700 and Co-phen/C-800. The nanoparticle growth with higher pyrolyzing temperature and the existence of Co3O4-species was suggested by TEM analysis. Additionally, employing transfer hydrogenation and alcohol dehydrogenative coupling approach, quinoxalines and imines were also synthesized from nitro compounds and alcohols. Moreover, the preferential involvement of diamine and condensation route during the formation of quinoxalines from 2-nitroamines was revealed by the kinetic studies and control experiments. Importantly, the recyclability of this system was tested up to 8th cycle and this heterogeneous system did not lose its catalytic activity significantly."
