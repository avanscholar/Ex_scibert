0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil fuels increases drastically due to increases in the use of fossil fuels in the energy sector. Most of the thermal power plants are run with coal or diesel. The use of petroleum products increased in the automotive sector [1,2]. In the automotive sector, diesel engines are playing an important role due to its high energy efficiency. Diesel engines are widely used for passenger vehicles, goods vehicles and in the agriculture sector. The replacement of diesel vehicles in the agriculture sector and goods transportation sectors is not possible. According to the World Energy Outlook (WEO), the demand for the diesel engine in the transportation sector will increases by about 40% by 2040 [3]. The cost of the energy market in the world is about 1.5 trillion dollars, a major portion of which is occupied by fossil fuels [4]. In the world's total energy demand more than 31% of energy share is occupied by oil and 23% by gas. Petroleum products will be the prime source of the energy mix by 2040 [5]. In total oil demand, the road transport section consumes about 43% of total demand by 2040. Most of the developed and developing countries made a policy to reduce the demand for petroleum oil in the transportation sector. This can be implemented by adopting biofuels, electrical vehicle and the use of hydrogen. Nuclear and biomass are expected to see demand growth of approximately 7Mboe/d (Thousand Barrels Of Oil Equivalent Per Day) each by 2040 [5]. According to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (Govt. of India), it is estimated that the demand for diesel increases from 69.4 MMT to 110 MMT (Million Metric Tons) by the year 2021–22 if the same condition continued [6]. The transportation sector in India contributes about 3% of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product), about 210 million of vehicles registered in 2015 in India. India is the 3rd largest importer of crude oil in the world. Due to large requirement of the energy and to reduce the dependency in crude oil India promotes the use of biodiesel in the transportation sector, production of second-generation ethanol and conversion of CO2 into biofuel [7,8]. The above statics and data showed the demand for diesel fuel in the transportation sector and also suggest finding a sustainable renewable alternative fuel to diesel. Research on hydrogen use in the automotive sector is not a new concept but its application is limited due to safety concerns. Many research groups continuously working on both hydrogen and biofuels, because both the fuel sources are renewable and are environment friendly. In the biofuels sector alcohols plays an important role due to the reason that it would not affect food security, while biodiesel may disturb the food chain because the biodiesel use oil contained seeds as a raw material [9]. The oil contained seeds may be edible oils and also the quality of the seeds may depend on the type of the soil, region and it is seasonal. Among all the biofuels, alcohol is the best choice as an alternative source to petro-diesel. Alcohols are of two types, which are lower carbon chain alcohols and higher carbon chain alcohols. In recent years higher carbon chain alcohols like butanol, pentanol and Hexanol are popular due to their better fuel stability, fuel properties and hydroxyl molecules in the structure helps in complete burring compared to lower carbon chain alcohols [10,11]. With an increase in the number of carbon atoms in the chain, its cetane number, lower heating value, density and viscosity will increase, while its solubility, oxygen content will decreases [11]. The comparative properties of 1-Hexanol with other higher alcohols are given in Table 1 . Alcohols are derived from biodegradable waste or lignocellulosic material with advanced processing technology [12]. Higher alcohols are artificially produced from genetically engineered micro-organisms like Cyanobacteria, Clostridium species, Escherichiacoli micro-organisms and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are used to produce higher alcohol from cellulose [13–16]. The production of biofuel from the food biomass and biodiesel from the vegetable oil disturbs the food chain supply. Researchers and biotechnology companies successfully achieved the mass production of higher alcohols to replace the petroleum based fuel and that go beyond lower alcohols made from corn or sugarcane and beyond biodiesel made from animal fats and vegetable oils [17]. Compared to alcohol, hydrogen has higher calorific value, flame speed, burning velocity, higher performance and lower emissions. However, the use of hydrogen is not succeeded in automobiles due to the lack of sophisticated technology and safety concerns. The clean-burning and better performance of the hydrogen makes it one of the most promising alternative fuels. Solar energy can be indirectly converted into hydrogen by using biomass based renewable sources. In spark-ignition engines, hydrogen can be directly used as fuel whereas, it is not possible to use H2 as sole fuel in compression ignition engine due to its high self-ignition temperature of about 858 K. The initiation of ignition of hydrogen is possible in the presence of spark plug or glow plug. The direct use of hydrogen as a sole fuel in a diesel engine is not possible due to the absence of spark plug. This drawback of the hydrogen can overcome by using hydrogen in a dual fuel mode [18,19]. Sundar Raj et al. made the first attempt to use 1-Hexanol as a fuel in diesel engine and they studied the effect of 1-Hexanol on engine characteristics. They found that the use of 1-Hexanol in a diesel engine increases the ignition delay, NOx emission and BTE was observed, while smoke density and BSFC was reduced [20]. De Poures et al. inspect the outcome of 1-Hexanol/diesel blend (10%, 20% and 30% v/v) on engine characteristics of CI engine under the influence of EGR (Exhaust gas recirculation) and injection timing. The presence of 1-Hexanol in the blend increases the ID, CP and heat release rate and it increases with a higher fraction of 1-Hexanol in the blend. The retardation of injection time deteriorates the combustion and reduces the CP and HRR. At higher load, higher NOx was noted which increases with an increase in the hexanol content. The retardation of injection timing and application of EGR reduces the NOx emission. Whereas, hydrocarbon emission increases with an increase in the fraction of 1-Hexanol in the bend at all engine load. Retardation of the injection angle affects negatively on combustion characteristics and positively on NOx emission [11]. Pandian et al. scrutinize the outcome of neat cashew nut shell oil on engine characteristics by doping 1-Hexanol (10% and 20% by volume) as an additive. They found that the addition of 1-Hexanol reduces HC, CO, smoke emissions, BSFC and marginally increases the BTE with increases in 1-Hexanol concentration in the blend. The doping of 1-Hexanol to cashew nut shell oil enhances the oxygen content, reduces viscosity and improves the atomization [21]. Abdullah et al. scrutinize the effect of hexanol/biodiesel/diesel blend on combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine. The concentration of hexanol was varied as 5%, 10% and 15% by volume. At all engine load, the cylinder pressure for all hexanol blends was decreased due to the extension of combustion to expansion stroke leads to loss of heat. The heat release rate was increased with increase in the concentration of hexanol in the blend compared to diesel fuel at 50% and 100% load, due to prolonged ID. An increase in CO and reduction in NOx emission was noted for all hexanol blends compared to diesel fuel at medium load [22]. Barrios et al. carried out an experiment to scrutinize the influence of hydrogen (0 to 25% hydrogen energy share) on engine characteristics in a diesel engine. It was noted that specific fuel consumption and CP decreased with the addition of hydrogen. The low CP was due to the absorption of energy by water particles produced due to the burning of H2. Lower CO2, HC and PM emissions were noted with 25% hydrogen energy share. Enrichment of hydrogen increases the CO emission which is due to incomplete combustion and also no change is noted in NOx emission. [23]. Sharma et al. conducted an experiment to know the effect of hydrogen on engine characteristics in dual fuel mode. The hydrogen was supplied to the intake manifold and the HES in the test were varied as 5, 10 and 20%. The hydrogen assisted combustion reduces the maximum pressure, which reduces the BTE and increases the brake specific energy consumption of the engine at all engine loads. The lower HES reduces the NOx emission at low and mid load, whereas at higher load the NOx emission was increased for all HES. Higher HC formation was noted for 5% HES, and with an increase in HES the reduction in HC was noted at all load, whereas, lower CO was noted for all HES and at all engine load [24]. Yilmaz et al. examined the effect of hydrogen on engine characteristics of CI engine; hydrogen volume is varied as 20 and 40 LPM. It was noted that higher CP and lower heat release was noted with hydrogen compared to diesel fuel. Higher BTE and lower BSEC were noted with hydrogen at 50 and 75Nm, whereas, 40LPM of hydrogen showed lower BTE and higher BSEC at 100Nm. Lower NOx emission was obtained for 20LPM at all loading conditions whereas, an increment in NOx was noted for 40LPM at 50 and 75Nm. Lower CO2 and HC emission were noted at all loading conditions [25]. Juknelevičius et al. conducted an experiment to study the effect of hydrogen on engine characteristics in a dual fuel mode. Hydrogen volume was varied as 10, 20 and 30LPM which was supplied to intake manifold of the engine. The in-cylinder pressure was reduced at all engine loads with the addition of hydrogen compared to diesel fuel due to reduced ID. The thermal efficiency of the engine decreases with a higher fraction of HES, whereas, at low load and medium load the consumption of diesel was reduced with an increase in hydrogen flow rate. Lower NOx, higher HC and lower CO was noted with hydrogen enrichment [26]. From the literature, it is noted that limited studies are available with the use of 1-Hexanol in a CI engine. No studies are found with the use of 1-Hexanol and hydrogen in a dual fuel mode in a CI engine. Only one study showed the effect of injection time on combustion and emission characteristics with the use of 1-Hexanol in a CI engine. The available data of 1-Hexanol is not sufficient in proving the compatibility of 1-Hexanol in a CI engine. The poor combustion characteristics of 1-Hexanol can be enhanced with the use of hydrogen in a dual fuel mode. All these research gaps motivate us to do a detailed study on the effect of injection time on combustion, performance and emission characteristics of common rail direct injection CI engine fuelled with 1-Hexanol and hydrogen in a dual fuel mode."
1,Research setup and methodology,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup The experiment was conducted in a 2-cylinder, 4-stroke CRDI CI engine, which is made of Mahindra automotive and Maxximo model engine. The engine setup is shown in Fig. 1 and the specification of the engine is shown in Table 2 . The operation of the engine was controlled with an open electronic control unit which is made of NIRA and i7r model, which controls the injection time, injection pressure, injection quantity and EGR rate. The output shaft of the engine was connected with an eddy current dynamometer for loading purpose. The in-cylinder pressure was obtained from the piezotronic pressure transducer and a crank angle encoder was used to measure the crank angle position of the engine. The specification of the pressure transducer and crank angle encoder is shown in Table 3 and Table 4 . The fuel line consists of an electric feed pump, fuel filter and high-pressure pump, the feed pump draws the fuel form the tank and supplied to the high-pressure pump through fuel filters. The high-pressure pump delivers the pressurized fuel to the common rail injection system through the high-pressure pipe. Irrespective of the operating condition, the common rail injection system maintains the required pressure which can be done by a high-pressure pump. The fuel measuring burette was connected to fuel inlet of the engine and fuel tank, by using a timer fuel flow rate was measured. The signals from the various sensors in the engine were fed into the data acquisition system (DAQ) which is made of National instrument and USB-6210 model, DAQ is connected to the computer. LabView based IC Enginesoft application was used to process the signals obtained from DAQ. The exhaust gas analysis was done using an AVL DI Gas 444 gas analyzer, which measures CO, CO2, NOx, HC and O2."
3,Development of hydrogen line setup,"2.2 Development of hydrogen line setup The schematic diagram of the hydrogen fuel line is included in the test rig (Fig. 1). In this study, the hydrogen is continuously supplied into the intake manifold during the suction stroke which replaces the calculated amount of air. The hydrogen in the intake manifold mixed well with air and forms a homogeneous mixture. A prefilled hydrogen cylinder was procured form Lakshmi cryogenics Mangalore, with a purity of 99.99%. The high pressured hydrogen in the cylinder was reduced to 2 bar using a pressure regulator. A flame arrester is installed before hydrogen is inducted into the intake manifold to avoid backfire and explosion. The flame arrestor is equipped with a pressure relief valve to avoid overpressure. Two non-return valves are used; one non-return valve is set before entering into the flow meter and the other one before entering into the inlet manifold. The hydrogen flow meter is used to control the flow rate of the hydrogen. The photographic view of the hydrogen setup is shown in Fig. 2 ."
4,Test fuel,"2.3 Test fuel Diesel, 1-Hexanol and Hydrogen are the used fuel is in the experiment. Diesel was procured from the local supplier; 1-Hexanol (CAS No: 111–27-3) of technical grade with ≥ 99% purity was procured from Loba Chemie PVT. The fuel blend is prepared by mixing 30% of 1-Hexanol with 70% of diesel by volume. The most widely used and simple flash blending method was used to prepare the blends. The prepared blends undergone for phase stability test, the prepared blend was observed for 24 h, no separation or formation of a layer was observed. The flow rate of hydrogen was 10LPM, which was constant throughout the experiment. The hydrogen was inducted into the intake manifold during the suction stroke. The properties of 1-Hexanol and its blend are shown in Table 5 and the properties of hydrogen are shown in Table 6 ."
5,Uncertainty analysis,"2.4 Uncertainty analysis The measurement of uncertainty during the experiment is very important which influences the results of the experiment. The uncertainty of the experiment depends on experimental methods, equipment selection, environmental conditions, false reading, and calibration of the equipment [28]. Uncertainty analysis is very important to quantify the experimentation accurately. The uncertainty of the parameters associated with the experiment is shown in Table 7 ."
6,Test procedure,"2.5 Test procedure The experiment was conducted in three stages; in the first stage the baseline readings are noted with pure diesel at standard working conditions like injection time 12°BTDC, injection pressure of 1000 bar and the load was varied from 20 to 80% in step of 20% load, the engine speed of 2000 rpm was constant throughout the experiment. In the second stage, the experiment was continued with 30H70D fuel, the experimental condition was used in the first stage was maintained in the second stage also. The obtained results for 30H70D were compared with baseline readings. Further, the effect of advanced (15°BTDC) and retard (9°BTDC) injection time was investigated with 30H70D, the obtained results were compared with baseline readings. In the third stage, the hydrogen was inducted into the intake manifold as a secondary fuel and 30H70D as a primary fuel with the best injection time. The obtained results are compared with baseline readings."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Combustion characteristics,"3.1 Combustion characteristics Combustion characteristics are the important parameters that represent the behavior of the fuel in the combustion chamber. This section discusses cylinder pressure, net heat release and combustion duration for all the fuels in the test. 3.1.1 Cylinder pressure The change in cylinder pressure for all the fuels in the test with crank angle is shown in Fig. 3 . At all loading conditions, 100D and 30H70D showed the same trend of cylinder pressure. The cylinder pressure of the engine for all the fuel blends increases with load. At 20%, 60% and 80% load the CP of 30H70D at 12°BTDC is 62.79 bar, 76.72 bar and 82.2 bar respectively, which is 8.96% and 3.65% lower at 20% and 60% load and 1.81% higher at 80% load respectively compared to neat diesel fuel operation. It is attributed to that, the ignition properties of 1-Hexanol are poor it had low calorific value, higher LHE, higher viscosity and low CN [11,28–30]. The lower CN increases the delay period, also the higher viscosity increases the delay period by injecting more amount fuel into the combustion chamber. Along with these, the higher LHE of 1-Hexanol consumes a large quantity of heat from the cylinder for evaporation which further increases the delay period. The prolonged delay period allows higher amount of fuel to accumulate in the cylinder. At lower and mid load conditions the combustion chamber environment was not suitable to evaporate all accumulated fuel, it leads to poor combustion. Whereas at higher load the combustion temperature was high enough to evaporate accumulated fuel, it leads to a rise in the cylinder pressure. Also, the OH radicals in 1-Hexanol are not so active at low load, whereas, at higher load, it actively participates in the combustion and boosts the CP [31,32]. Nour et al. and Kumar et al. noted the similar kind of results in their experiment [29,30]. The cylinder pressure of 30H70D at 15°BTDC showed higher at all loading conditions compared to neat diesel fuel, whereas, at 9°BTDC the lower CP was noted at all loading conditions. At 80% load, the peak pressure of 30H70D at 12°BTDC, 15°BTDC and 9°BTDC is 82.2 bar, 87.17 bar and 71.79 bar. Which is 1.81%, 7.41% higher and 11.05% lower respectively compared to neat diesel fuel operation. It was observed that at 12°BTDC and 9°BTDC the peak CP moves away from the TDC [33]. Whereas, at advanced injection time the peak moves near to the TDC. It is due to a reduction in combustion duration at advanced injection time. At advanced injection time, the early start of the combustion increases the CP and most of the fuel got burned in the premixed combustion phase and only a small amount of the fuel got burned in the diffusion combustion phase, which reduces the CD and increases the CP [34]. At the retarded injection time, the injected fuel had less time to evaporate and to form the combustible mixture [11]. Only a small amount of charge was burnt in the premixed combustion phase, most of the combustion happens in the expansion stroke. The amount of energy liberated in the expansion stroke is not accounted as useful energy as it goes out through the exhaust. Similar kind of findings are noted with Poures et al. and Lamni et al. [11,34]. The addition of hydrogen to 30H70D at advanced injection time reduces the in-cylinder pressure compared to 30H70D fuel only operation. The higher heating value and higher flame speed of hydrogen reduce the ID [26]. The lower quantity of fuel would accumulate due to reduced ID. The cylinder pressure at 20%, 60% and 80% load for 30H70 + H2 were 70.53 bar, 83.47 bar and 86.58 bar respectively. The inducted hydrogen-air mixture makes a homogeneous combustible mixture [18], which readily ignites once the primary fuel injected into the combustion chamber, most of the hydrogen burnt in the premixed combustion phase. This increases the temperature and pressure in the premixed combustion phase reduces the ID. The in-cylinder temperature and pressure influence the hydrogen/air motion, the turbulent motion of the fuel/air mixture is increased by higher in-cylinder temperature which makes the hydrogen-air mixture more homogeneous and ready to ignite [18]. Higher load condition is favorable for hydrogen-air mixture, which is near to stoichiometric condition, which burns rapidly [35,36]. Zhou et al. conducted an investigation of diesel-hydrogen dual-fuel combustion at different load and speed. They also represent a similar kind of results at both lower and higher load [37]. Talibi et al. also obtained similar results at both lower and higher load conditions [35]. 3.1.2 Net heat release rate The net heat release rate of 1-Hexanol/diesel blend, diesel and 30H70D + H2 is shown in Fig. 4 at 20%, 60% and 80% load. It is noted that at standard injection time the net heat release rate of 1-Hexanol/diesel blend was lower at 20% load, whereas, at 60% and 80% load NHR rate was higher than diesel fuel operation. At standard injection time, the NHR rate of 30H70D at 20%, 60% and 80% engine load are 71.66 J/deg, 103.61 J/deg and 104.59 J/deg respectively. This is 9.89% lower at 20% load and 5.72% and 7.95% higher at 60% and 80% load respectively compared to diesel fuel. The fuel properties like CN and calorific value of 1-Hexanol are lower than diesel fuel and viscosity and LHE are higher than diesel fuel. The higher viscosity of 1-Hexanol injects the fuel at a bigger droplet size and lower CN allowed injecting more quantity of fuel into the cylinder. At 20% load, the in-cylinder temperature is not high enough to break the bigger droplet size of the fuel and higher LHE hinders the rate of evaporation [38], this leads to lower NHR rate at 20% load. Whereas at 60% and 80% load the in-cylinder temperature is high enough to evaporate all the accumulated fuel this leads to a higher NHR rate. The lower CN, higher LHE and higher viscosity prolong the ID [39] which increases the CD, this moves the peak NHR away from TDC [35] and this can be seen from the graph. Poures et al. noted a similar kind of findings in their experiment [11]. It is noted from the graph that, the NHR rate of 30H70D at advanced injection time was lower compared to both standard and retard injection time at all loading conditions. At 80% load the NHR rate for 30H70D at 12°BTDC, 9°BTDC and 15°BTDC is 104.59 J/deg, 110.59 and 95.21 J/deg respectively. The lower NHR rate at advanced injection time was attributed to that reduced ID and CD. The higher NHR rate was noted for late injection time, which is due to the reason that higher temperature and pressure was experienced near TDC [40], which helps in the evaporation of accumulated fuel/air mixture and combustion. However, at late injection, the combustion happens in expansion stroke the amount of energy released due to combustion is not accounted as useful energy which goes waste through exhaust [33,41]. The lower CN, higher LHE and higher viscosity of 1-Hexanol increase the ID and allowed to accumulate more quantity of fuel in the cylinder. Only a small amount of fuel mixture burnt in the premixed combustion phase and most of the fuel/air mixture moved to diffusion combustion. The accumulation of more quantity of charge in the diffusion combustion would not able to burn completely and moved to the late combustion [30]. This leads to an increase in the CD and it can be seen clearly from the graph as the peak NHR moves away from TDC for standard and retard injection time [35]. Whereas, at advanced injection time the early start of the combustion leads to burn the maximum amount of fuel in the premixed combustion phase which reduces the CD and it can be seen from the graph that the peak appears near to the TDC. The early start of the combustion increases the in-cylinder temperature [34] which reduces the delay period, which allowed to accumulate only a small amount of fuel in the cylinder, which leads to lower NHR compared to standard and retarded injection time. Chen et al. showed a similar kind of results for 1-pentanol/diesel blends [42]. The NHR rate for 30H70D + H2 at 20%, 60% and 80% load are 73.98 J/deg, 91.43 J/deg and 94.82 J/deg respectively. The enrichment of hydrogen reduces the NHR rate of 30H70D at 15°BTDC due to a reduction in ID. At higher load, the H2-air mixture is relatively close to stoichiometric (φ = 0.40) [43], due to higher flame speed and high diffusive nature of hydrogen, which readily burnt in premixed combustion [44]. The hydrogen enrichment combustion process has three phases; in the first phase 30H70D-air burnt in premixed combustion, hydrogen-air premixed combustion happens in the second phase and in the third phase diffused hydrogen-30H70D-air burnt in controlled combustion. When the first stage of combustion happens (1.e. 30H70D-air premixed) which is followed by hydrogen premixed combustion happens, there is no significant boundary between the first and second premixed combustion [35,45]. The CP and HRR are more rapid in the premixed combustion due to the burning of hydrogen than that of 30H70D. This results in higher in-cylinder temperature and reduces the ID period [46]. Due to the reduction in the delay period, a small amount of fuel gets accumulated in the combustion chamber, which leads to a lower NHR rate. The obtained results are in line with Dimitriou et al. [47]. 3.1.3 Combustion duration The combustion duration of 100D, 30H70D and 30H70D + H2 is shown in Fig. 5 at all loading conditions and also for all injection time. The combustion duration of 30H70D at 12°BTDC is higher than diesel fuel operation at all loading conditions. At 12°BTDC, the combustion duration of 30H70D at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% load is 15.74°CA, 14.22°CA, 13.78°CA and 12.72°CA respectively, which is 14.99%, 16.52%, 13.86% and 5.97% higher compared to neat diesel fuel operation. In the case of alcohol combustion the lower CN of alcohol increases the delay period which leads to combust maximum amount of fuel in the premixed combustion phase, only a small amount of fuel will be burnt in diffusion combustion. Hence alcohols have a lower CD compared to diesel fuel. Whereas in case of combustion of 1-Hexanol the CD is higher than diesel fuel [48], which can be explained as the lower CN of 1-Hexanol increases the delay period, the higher viscosity of 1-Hexnaol injects bigger size fuel droplets into the combustion chamber and higher LHE hinder the evaporation of accumulated fuel. This leads to increment in the premixed combustion phase, where only a small amount of fuel got burned. The remaining combustion happens in diffusion and late combustion. This leads to an increase in the CD of 30H70D. Nour et al. also noted prolonged CD for 1-Hexanol compared to diesel fuel [30]. The advanced injection time and addition of hydrogen reduce the CD, whereas, the retarding injection time increases the CD. At 80% load, the combustion duration of 30H70D at 12°BTDC, 9°BTDC and 15°BTDC is 12.72°CA, 17.49°CA and 9.5°CA respectively. During the advanced injection time, the early start of the combustion reduces the negative effect of higher viscosity and LHE; this makes the fuel to evaporate rapidly. The maximum amount of fuel got burnt in the premixed combustion phase, which reduces the CD [34]. The combustion duration of 30H70D at 9°BTDC is high compared to other injection angles; this is due to higher ID. The fuel injection happens near to TDC, the fuel preparation phase take more time, the combustion happens in the expansion stroke due to delay in injection, which increases the combustion volume, this leads to increase in the CD. At 80% load, the combustion duration of 30H70D + H2 is 9.45°CA, which is 20.96% lower than diesel fuel operation. The higher flame temperature, higher calorific value and higher flame speed of hydrogen reduces the CD [43]. The inducted hydrogen into the intake manifold makes a homogeneous mixture with air, when a small flame appears due to injection of 30H70D, hydrogen burnt rapidly and increases the combustion chamber temperature. The increment in combustion temperature evaporates the 30H70D fuel rapidly and makes available for further combustion. The reduction in combustion reduces the loose of heat to the cylinder wall, which shifts the combustion peak near to TDC, thereby increase the combustion efficiency."
9,Performance characteristics,"3.2 Performance characteristics 3.2.1 Brake thermal efficiency The brake thermal efficiency of 100D, 30H70D and 30H70D + H2 at all loading conditions is shown in Fig. 6 . The diesel fuel showed the highest BTE at all loading conditions compared to 30H70D at all injection time. This is due to higher CN and higher heating value of diesel compared to 1-Hexanol. At 80% load, the BTE of 30H70D at standard injection time is 10.09% lower compared to diesel fuel operation. The poor fuel properties of 1-Hexanol like lower calorific value, lower CN, higher viscosity and higher LHE is the reason for poor performance. The lower LHV of 1-Hexanol produces lower heat and consumes higher fuel to produce the same amount of energy. The higher viscosity and LHE hinder the evaporation of accumulated fuel, which makes the combustion incomplete and extends the combustion to expansion stroke. All the negativity associated with fuel properties of 1-Hexanol produces lower BTE compared to diesel fuel. Sundar Raj et al. noted lower BTE for 1-Hexanol fuel blends in the test, the BTE decreases with higher fraction of 1-Hexanol [20]. At 80% load, BTE of 30H70D at advanced injection time and retard injection time is 6.78% and 16.57% lower compared to diesel fuel operation. The advanced injection time improves the combustion efficiency thereby increase the brake thermal efficiency. When the fuel is injected in advance the early start of the combustion helps in rapid evaporation of accumulated fuel and all the injected fuel participate in the combustion, most of the fuel burnt in the premixed combustion and hence combustion peak shifts near to TDC [34]. The maximum amount of heat produced during combustion converts into work with low loss, due to reduction in combustion duration. Whereas at retard injection time, the combustion happens in the expansion stroke [22], the combustion peaks appear away from the TDC [35]. Most of the heat produced due to combustion will lose to the engine parts and cylinder wall due to prolonged combustion duration, also some amount of combustible charge may be lost through the exhaust without burning [49]. This may be the possible reason for lower BTE at retarding injection time. The enrichment of hydrogen showed improved BTE compared to 30H70D alone at advanced injection time. The BTE of 30H70D + H2 at advanced injection time at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% is 4%, 3.95%, 2.46% and 1.86% lower respectively compared to neat diesel fuel operation. The higher heating value of hydrogen is the reason for improved BTE. The higher burning velocity, calorific value and diffusive nature of hydrogen burn rapidly and release higher heat nearer to TDC. Most of the inducted hydrogen burnt in the premixed combustion zone and 30H70D burnt in diffusion combustion. The inducted hydrogen into the intake manifold makes homogeneous mixture, the H2-air mixture becomes stoichiometric level, which speeds up the chemical reaction and the laminar burning velocity of the H2 develops into turbulent. This increases the in-cylinder temperature of the engine, which reduces the negative effect of higher LHE, lower CN and lower LHV of 1-Hexanol. Yilmaz et al. noted similar findings in their research for hydrogen [25]. Parthasarathy et al. also obtained similar kind of results for Ethanol/hydrogen combustion [50]. 3.2.2 Brake specific energy consumption The brake specific energy consumption of all the test fuels in the experiment is shown in Fig. 7 at all engine loads. The specific energy consumption of 30H70D at all loading conditions is high compared to diesel fuel operation. The energy consumption of 30H70D at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% load is 12.27%, 12.74%, 9.34% and 10.13% higher respectively compared to diesel fuel operation. The low LHV of 1-Hexanol and poor evaporation characteristics are the main reason for the higher consumption of energy to produce the same amount of work. As previously explained the lower CN is responsible for the prolonged delay period. The higher viscosity and higher LHE further increases the delay period. The higher viscosity causes poor atomization, which increases the heterogeneity of the fuel–air mixture leads to poor combustion. The higher LHE consumes a higher quantity of heat from the combustion chamber, which causes a cooling effect when the fuel droplets come in contact with these cold spots the fuel would not get evaporate causes incomplete combustion [30]. The advancement of injection reduces fuel consumption as compared to standard and retard injection time. At 80% load the BSEC of 30H70D at advanced and retard injection time is 6.84% and 16.59% higher respectively compared to neat diesel fuel operation. The advancement of injection reduces the consumption of fuel due to early start of the injection. Most of the injected fuel burnt in the premixed combustion phase which reduces the combustion duration compared to standard and retard injection time. Due to the reduction in combustion duration, the loss of heat to the cylinder wall was reduced. Also, the early start of the injection evaporates all the accumulated fuel in the combustion chamber, which overcomes the negative effect of higher LHE and viscosity. The evaporation rate of injected fuel droplets increases. During late injection time, the combustion start in the expansion stroke, combustion duration of retarded injection time is more compared to standard and advanced injection time [22]. Due to prolonged CD, most of the heat produced goes lost to the cylinder wall and also most of the fuel goes waste as unburnt mixture through the exhaust as injection occurs near TDC. The induction of hydrogen reduces energy consumption compared to 30H70D only operation. At 80% load, the BSEC of 30H70D + H2 is only 1.86% lower compared to neat diesel fuel operation. The higher heating value of hydrogen is responsible for the improvement in BSEC. The inducted hydrogen burnt in the premixed combustion phase, the higher flame speed and burning velocity of the hydrogen increases the combustion chamber temperature. The increment in the in-cylinder temperature reduces the ID of 1-Hexanol, this leads to lower amount of fuel accumulated in the combustion chamber. The flame of hydrogen goes closer to the cylinder wall due to lower quenching gap compared to diesel, results in a complete burning of fuel [25]. The results obtained are in line with Yilmaz et al. and Juknelevičius et al. [25,26]."
10,Emission,"3.3 Emission 3.3.1 Hydrocarbon emission The variation of hydrocarbon emission with load for all the fuels in the test is shown in Fig. 8 . The HC emission of 30H70D at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% is 62.5%, 45.45%, 35.71% and 33.33% higher compared to diesel fuel operation. It was noted that the HC emission of 30H70D decreases with an increase in the engine load. It indicates that higher in-cylinder temperature improves the combustion efficiency by improving the evaporation rate of accumulated fuel and reduces the formation of HC emission. The main reason for the formation of HC emission is incomplete combustion [51]. The lower CN of 1-Hexanol prolongs the delay period, higher viscosity injects more amount of fuel into the chamber and higher LHE reduces the evaporation rate [28]. An increase in delay period and combustion duration reduces the combustion efficiency. The prolonged combustion duration increases the combustion chamber volume, the combustion happens till the piston reaches to BDC. Due to increased combustion chamber volume more amount of heat loss to the engine parts, this leads to poor combustion [33]. Most of the researchers observed higher HC emission with the use of higher alcohol in their experiment [11,52–54]. The retarding of injection time also produces higher HC emission compared to diesel fuel operation. Here also prolonged ID and combustion duration are the main cause of higher HC emission. At 80% load HC emission of 30H70D at 9°BTDC 12°BTDC and 15°BTDC is 55.55%, 33.33% and 20% respectively higher compared to neat diesel fuel operation. At 9°BTDC the injection happens near to TDC, due to lower CN, higher viscosity and higher LHE, the ID got increased. The combustion happens in expansion stroke and it continues till the piston reaches to BDC, due to the increased volume of combustion chamber most of the heat goes waste and also most of the unburnt hydrocarbon comes out in the exhaust. Advanced injection time had lower HC emission compared to standard and retard injection time at all loading conditions. The early start of the combustion reduces the delay period and combustion duration, which avoids the accumulation of a higher quantity of fuel and loss of heat to the surrounding. Hence the complete combustion fuel can be expected and it can be seen through the lower concentration of HC in the exhaust. Poures et al. showed a similar kind of results at both retard and advanced injection time [11]. Further reduction in HC emission can be seen through the enrichment of hydrogen. The main reason for the reduction of HC emission with hydrogen enrichment is higher cylinder temperature, short ignition delay and combustion duration. At 80% load, the HC emission of 30H70D + H2 is only 11.11% higher compared to diesel fuel only operation. The higher flame velocity and rapid burning rate of hydrogen increase the in-cylinder temperature. With an increase in the combustion chamber temperature, the OH radicals in the alcohol are active and increase the premixed combustion. Also, the absence of hydrocarbon in H2 is the reason for the reduction in the HC emission. Obtained results are in line with Yilmaz et al. [25]. 3.3.2 Carbon monoxide emission The variation of CO emission at all loading conditions for all the fuels in the test is shown in Fig. 9 . The CO emission of 30H70D at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% is 46.15%, 50%, 60% and 33.33% higher compared to diesel fuel operation. It was noted that at 80% load lower concentration of CO emission was observed for 30H70D. At 80% load the CO emission of 30H70D at 12°BTDC, 9°BTDC and 15°BTDC is 33.33%, 60% and 0% respectively higher compared to neat diesel fuel operation. It was noted that late injection time increases the concentration of CO emission in the exhaust, whereas, the CO emission at 15°BTDC is equal to diesel fuel operation. The formation of CO emission depends on oxygen concentration, reaction time and cylinder temperature [55]. At standard and late injection time, the combustion starts near to TDC and it will continue till the end of BDC, it will increase the combustion duration. Due to prolonged duration the produced heat by burning of fuel will lose to the cylinder wall, along with this reason, the higher LHE and viscosity also reduces the combustion chamber temperature. These negative effects are responsible for the formation of CO at standard and late injection time [49]. However, at advanced injection time, the early start of the combustion reduces the combustion duration and ignition delay, which avoids the loss of the heat to the cylinder wall and also the oxygenated nature of alcohol assist in the oxidation reaction of CO to CO2 [29]. The enrichment of hydrogen to 30H70D reduces the concentration of CO in the exhaust emission. Only at 20% engine load 30H70D + H2 showed 12.5% higher CO emission compared to diesel fuel operation, whereas at 40%, 60% and 80% load the CO emission was almost similar to diesel fuel operation. As previously explained the hydrogen enrichment cause complete combustion of the accumulated fuel, due to higher burning velocity and flame velocity. The complete combustion generates OH radicals and also the presence of OH radicals in the alcohol reacts with CO at higher temperature and forms CO2 (CO + OH → CO2 + H). Another main reason for the reduction in the CO emission with the addition of hydrogen is the absence of carbon molecules in the hydrogen. Kargoz et al. and Deb et al. noted the lower CO concentration in their experiment with the use of hydrogen [27,56]. 3.3.3 Nitrogen oxide emission Three major sources of NOx formation is identified, which are thermal NOx, Prompt NOx and fuel-bound NOx. The major source of formation of NOx is thermal NOx. which formed by oxidation of nitrogen at very high temperature (1700 K) and which requires a sufficient residence time to form the NOx. The formation of thermal NOx can be explained by extended zeldovich mechanism [57]. (1) O + N 2 → N O + N (2) O 2 + N → N O + O (3) OH + N → N O + H The variation of NOx with load for all the fuels in the experiment is shown in Fig. 10 . The formation of NOx depends on in-cylinder temperature, residence time and availability of oxygen. The concentration of NOx for 30H70D is lower compared to neat diesel fuel operation. The use of 30H70D provides higher residence time (prolonged CD) and sufficient O2 content to form NOx however, the higher LHE and lower LHV hinders the formation NOx due to lower in-cylinder temperature. The use of 1-Hexanol provides the low combustion chamber temperature which negatively affects the formation of NOx. For 30H70D, at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% engine load the NOx formation is 29.95%, 31.81%, 26.77% and 10.56% lower compared to neat diesel fuel operation, lower NOx reduction was noted at 80% load compared to 20% and 60% engine load. As previously discussed the LHV of 1-Hexanol is the main reason for the reduction in the formation of NOx. Along with lower LHV, the higher LHE and higher viscosity also equally responsible for lower cylinder temperature. Higher sauter mean diameter (SMD) is due to the higher viscosity of 1-Hexanol, which makes the angle of the fuel spray is narrower and longer spray penetration than diesel fuel. This leads to the injection of more fuel into the cylinder wall leading to low evaporation [58]. All these things will increase the ignition delay and combustion duration. The burning of a large quantity of accumulated fuel in the combustion chamber may increase the peak HHR. Due to prolonged combustion duration, the heat from the combustion chamber may lose to the walls of the cylinder which creates cold spots in the combustion chamber. Also, the higher LHE of 1-Hexanol consumes a higher amount of heat of vaporization. When some part of the fuel/air mixture comes in contact with cold spots leads to incomplete combustion, which leads to the formation of CO, HC and reduces the formation of NOx. The prolonged combustion duration of 30H70D, lose the cylinder heat to the various engine parts due to an increase in the combustion volume. Obtained results are in line with Poures et al. [11]. The advanced injection time showed a higher NOx emission compared to standard and retard injection time of 30H70D. This can be attributed to that, at 15°BTDC, the early start of combustion increases the cylinder temperature and pressure which participate in the formation of NOx emission [59]. At 80% load, NOx emission at 15°BTDC and 9°BTDC is 5.14% and 33.15% lower respectively compared to neat diesel fuel operation. During the early injection time, most of the fuel injected into the combustion chamber burns in the premixed combustion phase, which rapidly increases the combustion temperature leads to an increase in the concentration of NOx in the exhaust. At 9°BTDC, the injection happens near to TDC, a considerable quantity of fuel–air mixture lost through exhaust gas and combustion of reaming fuel-art mixture happens in the expansion stroke. The heat release in the expansion stroke is not accounted as a use full energy and lost to the surrounding which is not participating in the formation of NOx emission. It is noted from the graph that the hydrogen enrichment reduces the formation of NOx emission compared to 30H70D at advanced injection time at all engine load. The formation of NOx for 30H70D + H2 at advanced injection time at 80% load is 11.47% lower compared to neat diesel fuel operation. This is 6.66% lower at advanced injection time compared to 30H70D only operation. Due to the addition of hydrogen both ignition delay and combustion duration of 30H70D were reduced. This helps in the accumulation of a lower amount of fuel in the combustion chamber and also the residence time of combustion products in the cylinder reduced which acts negatively on the formation of NOx. Parthasarathy et al. obtained a similar kind of results for Ethanol/hydrogen combustion [50]."
