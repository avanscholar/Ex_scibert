0,Introduction,"The rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves and its related environmental pollution has accelerated the search for clean alternative fuels worldwide [1–3]. Biofuels present the opportunity for infinite use of energy with minimal environmental consequences. Several studies have explored biofuels in road transportation industry [4–8]. However, same patronage of biofuels cannot be said for the shipping industry [9,10]. The shipping industry's main fuel is heavy fuel oil (HFO), which is the lowest quality, and dirtiest fuel type in the maritime sector. Combustion of HFO poses serious emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), black carbon, and sulfur oxides (SOx). Global CO2, SOx, and NOx emissions from the shipping industry are at 3, 4–9, and 10–15%, respectively [11,12]. Also, the shipping industry contributes to 3–5% of global mortality caused by PM less than 2.5 µm in diameter [13]. Adding to the disadvantages of HFO is its high viscosity. The viscosity of HFO can be as high as 700 mm2/s at 50 °C, limiting its direct application without preheating [14]. The transportation of heavy oils is complicated due to their high viscosity, low mobility, and flowability [15]. Simultaneously, viscous fuels are prone to poor fuel atomization, negative cold flow characteristics, incomplete combustion, ring sticking, and carbon deposit in the combustion chamber [16–18]. Thus, vessel operators preheat the oil at temperatures above 100 °C to reduce the kinematic viscosity to not more than 15 mm2/s, a process significantly energy and cost-intensive [19]. Hence, it is important to identify additives that could minimize the viscosity of HFO to an appreciable extent at a relatively lower cost, and at the same time go a long way to minimize the emissions from the shipping industry. Low carbon alcohols, methanol in particular, have been proposed as a fuel of the future for shipping, as they have the properties to make shipowners comply with both sulfur and NOx emission regulations without the need for exhaust cleaning systems. Alcohols are clean fuels due to hydroxyl (OH) in their molecular structures [20]. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) therefore invited the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to develop a standard for methanol as a marine fuel in 26 September 2017 [21,22]. Gilbert et al. [23] reported that methanol had a lower NOx emission factor (3 g/kWh) but a higher life cycle Greenhouse gas emission than conventional fuels. NOx emissions of partially premixed combusted methanol in a marine engine at low speed ranged from 0.3 to 1.4 g/kWh, which is about 60–90% reduction relative to Tier III stipulations [24]. Ammar [25] revealed that NOx, SOx, and PM emissions were reduced by more than 75% when methanol-diesel dual fuel engine was installed on a cellular container ship. Several research projects including MethaShip, and LeanShips have tested methanol as a fuel in marine engines in recent years [26]. A recent study by Ampah et al. [27] also shows a recent shift towards methanol as an alternative shipping fuel away from liquified natural gas (LNG). Though ethanol has been identified in several studies as an alternative shipping fuel [26,28], there are currently no projects for its application in marine engines [29]. With that being said, combustion of pure methanol or ethanol could be problematic without modification to engine injection system, due to the alcohols’ their lower heating values and cetane numbers, poor auto-ignition qualities, and inappropriate lubrication features, which limit the use of low carbon alcohols as a pure diesel engine fuel [30,31]. Thus, several studies have adopted the blend of ethanol/methanol in oil to achieve an all-round improved combustion, performance and emission characteristics. Despite this intervention, the polarity difference between these low carbon alcohols and oil presents miscibility problems [32–34]. For engine applications, it is required for all fuels to be homogenous one phase liquid. Phase separation may cause severe consequences during storage and transport, such as blockages and pumping difficulties [35]. Prevention of phase separation thus, improves drivability and also minimizes corrosion of water-sensitive engine parts composed of metals such as aluminum [36]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, little has been reported in existing literature about the; (1) blends of HFO-low carbon alcohols, and (2) miscibility improvement between blends of conventional marine fuel (HFO) and low carbon alcohol. The current study thus intends to bridge these gaps by proposing an oxygenated blend of fuel (HFO-low carbon alcohol) that can maintain a relatively longer period of homogeneity for combustion and bunkering in marine engines and bunkers. In recent years, alcohols, ethers, and furans have gained much interest to improve systems' solubilization [37]. The relatively lower polarity, hygroscopicity, and high heat of vaporization have made n-butanol suitable for diesel engines. n-Butanol is a less polar molecule than low carbon alcohols, and thus it presents more miscibility with conventional oils in contrast to methanol/ethanol, which are lower alcohols [38,39]. Dunn and Bagby [40] reported that the adding n-butanol as co-solvent in the mixture of soybean oil and ethanol could increase system solubility at low temperatures. Huang et al. [41] investigated the solubility of ethanol and diesel with and without n-butanol. The results showed that all blends had separated into multiple phases at most after 72 h prior to the addition of n-butanol; however, by adding 5% n-butanol, the blends could maintain a one-phase solution for at least 11–14 days. The higher energy density, lower hygroscopicity, lower heating value and relatively higher cetane number of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes its derivatives a promising biofuel for internal combustion engines [42]. Zhang et al. [43] prepared a delaminated blend of corn oil-methanol/ethanol at different ambient temperatures. The addition of THF to the two-phase basic system ensured the formation of hydrogen bond within the components which promoted the combination of molecules, then increased the solubility of the system. In another study by Wu et al. [44], THF was adopted to improve the solubility between low carbon alcohol and diesel blends. Their study revealed that, THF can be added in relatively smaller quantity to promote solubility between ethanol and diesel greatly. For instance, the blend of 30% volume ratio of ethanol and diesel can be dissolved into a homogeneous solution by a 4% volume ratio of THF, and the addition of THF at 7 vol% can dissolve any proportion of the basic system. Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODE), with the structure CH3-O(CH2O)n-CH3 and no C–C bond, are also promising blend fuels for diesel due to low viscosities and pour points, high oxygen contents, and high cetane numbers [45,46]. Zhang et al. [47] in their study of soybean oil-low carbon alcohol blends, used PODE to solve the miscibility issue of the basic system. The addition of 15% PODE was enough to guarantee a stable solution between 70% soybean oil in the two blended fuels at temperatures higher than 20 °C. The effect of PODE on the solubility of anhydrous ethanol–diesel and hydrous ethanol–diesel blends was investigated by Jin et al. [48]. Without PODE, the solubility of anhydrous/hydrous ethanol–diesel blend was not satisfactory for use in diesel engine. However, the situation is greatly improved upon the addition of PODE. Based on the above reviews, it can be speculated that, when n-butanol, THF, and PODE, are added to the blends of HFO-low carbon alcohols, the persisting miscibility issue can be greatly circumvented. Though the current study is aimed at filling the research gap on the promotion of HFO-low carbon alcohol blends, and providing a solution to their miscibility situation, it is worth noting that, the proposed co-solvents do not only possess solubilization abilities but they can also; (1) join forces with the low carbon alcohols to drastically reduce the viscosity of HFO to acceptable levels which reduces the cost and energy required in the pre-heating process of neat HFO. In previous studies, the high viscosities of rapeseed oil [34], soybean oil [33], palm oil/palm kernel oil [49,50], and corn oil were significantly reduced to that of an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D975) limit due to the influence from PODE, THF, and the alcohols, and (2) positively influence the performance and emission characteristics when added to conventional liquid fuels. This could be attributed to the oxygen content they bring on board together with their relatively higher cetane numbers than that of neat HFO in the case of THF and PODE. The presence of vanadium and sulfur elements in HFO causes the oil's high and low-temperature corrosion. The former affects the engine's exhaust passage while the latter attacks the cylinder liner and other combustion chambers. Unfortunately, due to the oxygen and water content of oxygenated fuels, their addition to HFO often exacerbates corrosion effects. Previous studies have reported that, by increasing the oxygenated fuel content in its blend with HFO, an increase in the aqueous modified total acid number (AMTAN) was recorded, implying enhanced corrosivity [51,52]. Hence the current study finds it necessary to examine the extent of corrosivity of the ternary systems. Therefore, the primary aim of the current study is to prepare a blend of HFO and low carbon alcohols in the presence of n-butanol, THF, and PODE, that can be kinetically stable for at least 48 h under undisturbed conditions. Secondary to this aim, the authors tried to ascertain the ternary systems’ viscosity, corrosivity, and sulfur content relative to that of neat HFO. The study is concluded with an economic feasibility of using the proposed ternary systems in comparison to an HFO + scrubber system, as two different pathways of meeting SOx emission standards. The study promotes the wide use of alcohols, PODE, and THF in the shipping industry, as a sustainable means of completely decarbonizing this transportation sector."
1,Methodology,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup HFO was procured from Shandong Chambroad Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. Tsingtao Tongchuan Petrochemical Engineering Company supplied PODE. The chemical formula of PODE is CH3O–(CH2O)n–CH3, and the range of n is 3 to 6. N-butanol, anhydrous methanol and ethanol, and THF were in analytical reagent grade pure and were bought from Tianjin Jiangtian Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. The physicochemical properties of these fuels are listed in Table 1 ."
3,Blends’ inter-solubility,"2.2 Blends’ inter-solubility Preparation of the ternary blends begun with HFO-low carbon alcohol at an initial volume of 5 mL into a 20 mL centrifuge tube. The alcohol concentration ranged from 10 to 50 vol% in 10 vol% increments. The blend was vigorously stirred with a vortex mixer at 5000 rpm for 15 min and left standing for at least 24 h. Within this period, the HFO-methanol/ethanol at all blend ratios except 10% ethanol (all temperatures) and 10% methanol (50 °C) separated into a two-phase liquid, as seen in Fig. 1 . For the two-phase systems, a high precision pipette with an accuracy of 0.1 μL was employed to add the test co-solvents, creating a ternary system that could maintain a one-phase liquid for least two days. Due to HFO's high viscosity, opaqueness, and dark color, immediate settling and visibility for the systems after vigorous stirring was long and difficult; hence observations and addition of co-solvents were made only after every 24 h. The amount of co-solvent added at the endpoint is represented in column bars. The operating temperature for HFO storage and settling tanks are 50 and 90 °C in marine vessels [51], hence, prevention of phase separation was not conducted at low temperature operability. The current experiment is limited to a maximum of 50 °C due to the relatively lower boiling points of ethanol (78 °C) and methanol (64 °C). The systems were held at an experimental temperature of 20, 40, and 50 °C in a digital constant temperature water bath with a precision of 0.1 °C for the entire study period to investigate the effect of temperature on the experimental results. For accuracy, each experiment was performed thrice, and the average of these multiple random trials was taken as the final volume of co-solvent added."
4,Characterizing the mutual solubility of HFO-low carbon alcohols-co-solvents,"2.3 Characterizing the mutual solubility of HFO-low carbon alcohols-co-solvents 2.3.1 Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance One of the factors of microemulsion dissolution is the Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance (HLB) value. The higher the HLB value, the higher the hydrophilicity, making solubilization more difficult and vice versa [53]. In Table 2 , the HLB value of the various systems have been calculated using Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) [54]; (1) HLB = 7 + ∑ H - ∑ L where ∑H represents hydrophilic radical, and ∑L represents lipophilic radical. The HLB value of HFO as shown in Table 1 was calculated using Eq. (1) based on the saturates, aromatics, resins, asphaltene (SARA) composition of HFO from Gateau et al. [55]. (2) HLB 12 = HLB 1 ∗ W 1 + HLB 2 ∗ W 2 / W 1 + W 2 where W1 denotes the volume% of surfactants 1 and W2 denotes the volume% of surfactants 2. HLB1 and HLB2 denote the HLB values of the corresponding surfactants. HLB12 denotes the total HLB value. To give a simpler analysis of the whole miscibility results, Table 3 shows the relative volume value of miscibility. HFO-Methanol-PODE system at 20 °C is defined as 1. The higher the value of miscibility volume in the given table, the better the solubility ability of that system. 2.3.2 Hansen solubility parameters The correlation between a liquid’s total evaporation energy with the overall intermolecular force is determined by the Hildebrand solubility parameter (δ) [56]. The Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) produces a useful technique for quantifying the idea of “like dissolves like”, where one molecule is defined as being ‘like’ another if it bonds to itself in a similar way. The Hildebrand parameter (δ) is related to the HSPs (δd: dispersion solubility parameter, δp: polar solubility parameter, δh: hydrogen bonding solubility parameter) by Eq. (3) (3) δ = √ δ d 2 + δ p 2 + δ h 2 The HSP Distance between two molecules, conventionally called Ra, is a measure of how alike they are. As Ra reduces, the compatibility between the two molecules is likely to increase. Ra is governed by Eq. (4) [57]; (4) R a 2 = 4 ( δ D a - δ D b ) 2 + ( δ P a - δ P b ) 2 + ( δ H a - δ H b ) 2 where ‘a’ is the HSPs values of fuel component 1 and ‘b’ is the HSPs values of fuel component 2. Table 4 summarizes the obtained Hildebrand parameter, HSPs, and Ra of the base fuels and its individual components."
5,Microscopic observation of mutual solubility of ternary systems,"2.4 Microscopic observation of mutual solubility of ternary systems The experimental samples were further observed under a biological microscope (OLYMPUS CX31RTSF) and the differences in the solubility process of base blend systems (HFO-low carbon alcohol) and ternary blend system (HFO-low carbon alcohol-co-solvent) were discussed. The procedure begins with a vigorous stirring of the base blend. Then, a pipette was used to suck a sample of the base blend of 1:1 HFO-low carbon alcohol at room temperature. The sample is dropped unto a clean and dry microscope slide. The microscope is then used to observe the phase behavior of the HFO-low carbon alcohols at a magnification of 500 µm (10 X 10). The same process is repeated for the ternary system at a magnification of 200 µm (10 X 40), and the obtained micro-view of blends are captured by a high-definition camera for further analysis."
6,Determination of fuel properties,"2.5 Determination of fuel properties As mentioned in the introduction, apart from the solubilization process of the proposed ternary systems, they can also positively improve on the performance and emission characteristics of neat HFO. In order to appreciate this, there is the need to ascertain some key fuel properties of the ternary blends. The properties investigated included, density, viscosity, cetane number, lower heating value, and sulfur content. Properties of the ternary blends were calculated by using basic properties of pure fuels and empirical formulae. Several evidence or studies exist to support the validation of these empirical formulae, and their application can be found in the following studies refs. [58,59]. In this section, a hypothetical blend ratio was used in all calculations in order not to have a biased result due to the different co-solvent requirement in each system. The fractions of HFO, methanol/ethanol, and co-solvents were estimated at 50–90%, 5–30%, and 5–20%, respectively. Properties of the test fuels are given in Table 5 . The procedural steps of each of the calculated fuel property is provided in the supplementary file (Appendix 1–5) for ready reference."
7,Corrosivity of ternary blends,"2.6 Corrosivity of ternary blends The corrosivity test was performed using a polished copper strip with a density of 8.94 gcm-3. The aim was to investigate the influence of different ethanol/methanol/HFO concentrations on corrosion of surfaces. The polished copper strips are initially weighed and completely immersed in 13 fuel samples for 360 h at 50 °C. After the immersion period, the strips are removed and gently immersed in a wash solvent, after which they are withdrawn and dried with a quantitative filter paper. After this, two major investigation types are performed to compare the fuel’s level of corrosivity. The observation for color change is compared against ASTM method D 130/IP 154 for copper corrosion test. Also, the copper strips' corrosion rate is calculated using Eq. (5). In order not to have a biased effect due to the different volumes of co-solvent; an equal amount of co-solvent capable of maintaining one phase liquid in all ternary systems is selected. (5) Corrosion rate = W ∗ 3.45 ∗ 10 exp 6 / DtA where corrosion rate is in mils per year (mpy), w is mass loss (g), D is density of copper strips (g/cm−3), A is the exposed surface area (cm2), and t is immersion time (h)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of various co-solvent on solubility of HFO-Methanol/Ethanol (Macro-observation),"3.1 Effect of various co-solvent on solubility of HFO-Methanol/Ethanol (Macro-observation) 3.1.1 Effect of n-butanol on solubility of HFO-Methanol/Ethanol This section reports the improvement in miscibility of HFO-methanol/ethanol systems with n-butanol as co-solvent. Before the experiment, the investigators first studied the mutual solubility of n-butanol and HFO at an initial volume of 5 mL. The concentration of the n-butanol in the blend was 10–90% in 10 vol% increments. There was partial solubility of n-butanol in the binary blend at only between 10 and 60 vol% n-butanol content. After this, n-butanol was gradually added to the HFO-low carbon alcohol base blends. Due to butanol’s partial solubility in HFO, the mutual solubility of HFO-methanol–butanol was only up to 30 vol% methanol and HFO-ethanol-butanol was up to 40 vol% ethanol at all experimental temperatures. The weaker polarity and amphiphilic property of n-butanol compared to that of methanol/ethanol promoted its easier merging with HFO at relatively lower volumes n-butanol [66]. Moreover, as seen in Table 4, compared to the Ra values of HFO-low carbon alcohols, the Ra value of HFO-n-butanol blend shows that the C4 alcohol has better compatibility and miscibility with HFO than that of the low carbon alcohols. As seen in Fig. 2 , the requirement of n-butanol increased as the low carbon alcohol concentration increased. This may be explained by the increase in hydrophilicity of the system with decrease in the methanol/ethanol content in the binary blends, as seen in Table 2. Furthermore, asphaltenes in HFO are naturally-occurring surfactants [67,68], thus reducing the content of HFO in the ternary system decreases the stability of the system. Moreover, ethanol-containing system relatively used lesser amount of the n-butanol compared to that of methanol’s as seen in Fig. 2a and 2b, respectively. At 20 and 30 vol% low carbon alcohols (at 20 °C), n-butanol content was 11 mL and 12 mL for the methanol systems against 8.00 mL and 8.45 mL for ethanol systems, respectively. The polarity and HLB value of 5.2 and 7.95 of ethanol in contrast to 6.6 and 8.425 of methanol, respectively, favored the former’s easier miscibility with HFO upon the addition of n-butanol. Furthermore, from Table 4, the Ra value of ethanol-HFO being lesser than methanol-HFO’s indicates that there is a better miscibility in the former blend than the latter. At 20, 40, and 50 °C, the relative volume value for fuel miscibility in Table 3 for H + M + B was 0.11, 0.14, and 0.16, respectively, and H + E + B at the same temperatures as above was 0.17, 0.21, and 0.25, respectively. The reason for this observation could be that by increasing temperature, much of asphaltenes become dissolved in the oil [69]. 3.1.2 Effect of THF on solubility of HFO-Methanol/Ethanol In this part, THF’s influence on promoting miscibility of HFO-ethanol/methanol system is reported. Before the experiment, the investigators first studied the mutual solubility of THF and HFO. The trend of solubilization was similar to that of the n-butanol systems. However, unlike that of n-butanol, a binary system of HFO-THF at all volume ratio of THF exhibited an isotropic behavior for the study period. The investigators then proceeded to add THF to the base blends. As seen in Fig. 3 a and 3b, the amount of THF consumption was relatively lesser than that of n-butanol. At 40 °C and 40 vol% ethanol, the added THF was 5.70 mL lesser than that of n-butanol. HLB values between 0 and 7 are oil soluble. The HLB values in Table 2 show that HFO-THF blends have HLB values less than 7 (lipophilic) making it easier to attain more miscibility than that of HFO-n-butanol systems. The amphiphilicity of THF between methanol/ethanol and HFO is better than that of n-butanol. Thus, there was a significant decrease in the surface tension of the THF-containing systems. Moreover, THF is composed of cyclic saturated alkanes, which indicates that THF has a strong hydrogen bonding than n-butanol [73,74]. Also, Ra values in Table 4 shows that, THF has a better inter-miscibility with HFO than that of n-butanol. Furthermore, similar to the case of n-butanol, the systems with ethanol were relatively easier to attain miscibility compared to systems with methanol. Adding to the already above-mentioned reasons in Section 3.1.1, specifically this observation may also be explained in the sense that ethanol (5.2) shares closer polarity with THF (4.2) than that of methanol (6.6). The effect of temperature on the solubility ability of THF generally followed a similar pattern as that of n-butanol. 3.1.3 Effect of PODE on solubility of HFO-Methanol/Ethanol In this section, the improvement of miscibility between HFO and low carbon alcohol was investigated with PODE as a co-solvent. The obtained results are displayed in Fig. 4 a and 4b. Like THF and n-butanol, PODE's requirement for mutual solubility with HFO-methanol/ethanol increases with an increase in alcohol content. However, a slight difference in the solubility of methanol and ethanol-containing systems was recorded. More than half of all fuel samples under the various temperatures saw methanol-based systems consume lesser PODE than ethanol-based systems. The oxygen in PODE molecules leads to a pronounced dipole moment, making PODE a strongly polar fuel [75]. Hence, PODE easily solubilizes with the methanol according to the principle of similar compatibility. Also, the effect of temperature on HFO-methanol/ethanol-PODE exhibits an irregular pattern unlike what was observed from THF and n-butanol systems. For ternary systems with ethanol, the solubility ability of PODE decreases with an increase in temperature. For methanol, the solubility initially decreases with an increase in temperature from 20 to 40 °C and after that increases at 50 °C except at 50 vol% methanol. The effect of temperature on the solubility of asphaltenes has been reported by many authors as controversial, debatable, and unclear [76–79]. Previous researchers have different views on solubility of asphaltene with an increase in temperature; one group of the researchers believe that solubility of asphaltene decrease with increase in temperature; the second group also are of the view that solubility of asphaltenes increase with increase in temperature; whereas a third group reveal that the solubility of asphaltenes initially increases/decreases followed up by decrease/increase, respectively with increase in temperature [69,76–81]. Maqbool et al. [78] tried to propose three different hypotheses for these conflicting results. First, they explained that the lower initial mass and concentration of the destabilized asphaltene aggregates at higher temperatures. This could result in a reduced number of particle collisions leading to slower aggregation rate to increase solubility and prolong precipitation onset time for asphaltenes. Secondly, upon heating, the lighter fractions of the oil, predominantly alkanes, expand and effectively reduce their mixtures' solubility parameter, thus making the asphaltenes less soluble. Finally, as the mixture viscosity decreases due to an increase in temperature, aggregation becomes faster as a result of the increase in the effective diffusivity of the particles leading to lower solubilities of the asphaltene. These assumptions could explain the current study's varying trend in solubility when the systems’ temperature change. By comparing the solubilizing power of the three co-solvents used, the order of solubilizing ability in methanol-containing systems is PODE > THF > n-butanol, whereas that of ethanol-containing systems is THF > PODE > n-butanol. Moreover, due to its excellent cetane number, PODE does not only improve the miscibility of the system but tends to improve the ignition quality of the resulting fuel blend, as seen in Table 5. It should be noted that despite improving the solubility of HFO-methanol/ethanol, binary blend of HFO-PODE is a two-phase system unlike that of n-butanol and THF as seen in Fig. 1f. As mentioned earlier, the high amount of oxygen content makes PODE a strongly polar fuel whereas HFO is medium polar; hence there is partial compatibility between their binary mixtures. However, due to the polar nature of the low carbon alcohols, polarity becomes higher in HFO-low carbon blends. This process enables PODE to easily solubilize the blends according to the principal of similar compatibility. Combining all results, the authors conclude that, THF has the most solubilizing power to promote miscibility between HFO-low carbon alcohols, followed by PODE, with n-butanol being the worst. Similar conclusions have been reached by previous studies, where the HFO fraction in the current study is replaced with soybean, rapeseed, palm oil/palm kernel oil, and corn oils in the referenced studies [33,34,43,49,50]. As seen in Table 2 and 4, the HLB and Ra values of THF-HFO mixtures compared to that of the other co-solvents could explain the reason for this observation."
10,Effect of co-solvent on solubility of HFO-Methanol/Ethanol (Micro-observation),"3.2 Effect of co-solvent on solubility of HFO-Methanol/Ethanol (Micro-observation) In this section the micro-observation of the differences in the solubilization process of three different systems is reported; (1) HFO-methanol blend, (2) HFO-ethanol blend, and (3) HFO-low carbon alcohol-co-solvent blend. As seen in Fig. 5 a (loose emulsion), the solubility between HFO-methanol blend is the weakest of the three systems. By dropping the sample on the microslide, the bulk solution quickly converges to the middle of the slide while methanol (transparent droplets) due to its high fluidity disperses towards the outer boundary of the slide. An emulsion exists where the methanol is in a dispersed phase and HFO is in the continuous phase (water-in-oil emulsion). Due to methanol’s high volatility, it evaporates at a very faster rate within 1 min, leaving very few droplets of alcohol. It can be seen that larger droplets of both methanol encapsulated in HFO, and HFO encapsulated in methanol exists in system a. The existence of larger droplet size in a solution characterizes a relatively unstable system [82]. These observations could be attributed to methanol’s poor lipophilicity. Moreover, the “likeness” of the molecules of the HFO-methanol system according to Ra values in Table 4 seems the poorest of all other systems. In HFO-ethanol system represented by Fig. 5b (medium emulsion), the situation is relatively better compared to its methanol counterpart. The dispersion of ethanol molecules out of the bulk solution is slower, also the number of droplets of ethanol is fewer and smaller in size. Ethanol has better lipophilicity with oil than that of methanol. Simultaneously, the Hildebrand solubility parameter of HFO and ethanol are much closer than that of HFO and methanol, hence there is similar compatibility, higher cohesive energy, and strong inter-molecular force of attraction in system b than system a. Upon adding a co-solvent to both HFO-low carbon alcohol systems, the inter-miscibility of the blends is significantly improved as seen in Fig. 5c (tight emulsion). There exist no noticeable droplets of alcohols, and the bulk solution hardly separated into several fragments. In other words, the addition of the co-solvent to the base blends produced a more kinetically stable system. The addition of co-solvent to the base blend ensured that (1) the total lipophilicity of the two base blends is increased drastically, (2) the HSP distance (Ra) between the molecules are also reduced to an appreciable extent in the ternary systems than that of the binary systems, and (3) significant improvement in the overall systems’ cohesive energy, hydrogen bonding, and inter-molecular force of attraction is realized in system c. These reasons among many others could explain the reason for the improvement in miscibility of HFO-low carbon alcohols upon the addition of the selected co-solvents. The observations in this section are similar to that of the macro-observation described in previous section."
11,Kinematic viscosity adjustment of blends,"3.3 Kinematic viscosity adjustment of blends Fig. 6 shows that viscosity is amongst the most researched topics of conventional marine fuels in the last two decades. The bibliometric analysis conducted by the researchers on marine fuels revealed that of the most investigated physico-chemical property of HFO is its viscosity. Out of the 3, 245 author keywords used in the gathered marine fuel literature, both HFO and viscosity ranked among the top 1% most used keywords. Higher viscosity of fuel leads to more incomplete combustion and as a result increases emission [16]. The asphaltene content of HFO is responsible for its high viscosity. Ghanavati et al. [83] revealed that heavy fuel oil's viscosity increases exponentially with increasing asphaltene volume fraction. Asphaltenes are thus critical in the petroleum field for kinematic viscosity reduction. In this section, the ternary blends' kinematic viscosity at equal volumetric ratio is evaluated at 50 °C. The results are compared to that of an unheated (180 mm2/s) and preheated HFO (∼15 mm2/s). From Table 5, Fig. 7 a and 7b, for both ethanol and methanol-containing systems, respectively, it can be seen that, when the concentration of HFO is limited to not more than 70 vol%, the ternary blends achieved a kinematic viscosity well below that of a pre-heated HFO except 70H20E10B. With this observation, it can be inferred that, shipowners could achieve significant reduction in energy and cost savings for the preheating of HFO. Comparing the values in Table 5 to an unheated HFO (180 mm2/s), the ternary blends accrue a viscosity reduction between about 60–98%. It is worth mentioning that among the three test co-solvents, THF had the most impact on the kinematic viscosity of neat HFO followed by PODE with n-butanol being the worst. This trend is attributed to THF’s relatively smaller viscosity than the other two co-solvents. Similar conclusions have been reached by previous studies, where the HFO fraction in the current study is replaced with soybean, rapeseed, palm oil/palm kernel oil, and corn oils in the referenced studies [33,34,43,49,50]."
12,Corrosivity of blends,"3.4 Corrosivity of blends The corrosivity of selected ternary systems and their components was investigated, and the obtained results are reported in this section. The corrosivity of the neat samples were investigated simultaneously with that of the blends. From a macroscopic point of view, the obvious change in the copper strips' physical appearance after the immersion period was color change. The original color of the polished copper strips, as seen in Fig. 8 , is reddish-brown. Comparing these color changes to the ASTM standard for corrosion of copper strips, all the fuel blends showed an acceptable rating either as slightly or moderately tarnished. Overall, based on the appearance of the copper strips, tendency for corrosivity is likely to increase when the methanol and ethanol content in the ternary system increases. The above results imply that by blending ethanol or methanol into HFO at higher ratios of alcohols, the potential risk of corrosivity could increase. Moreover, by increasing the content of alcohol, the system would require increase in THF and PODE to maintain phase uniformity. These two co-solvents have shown high risk of corrosiveness either as ‘dark tarnish’ or ‘corrosion’, respectively. In summary, increasing the biofuel content of the ternary systems in this study has shown an increased risk of corrosivity. This can be attributed to the relatively higher oxygen content of the alcohols and co-solvents compared to HFO, and oxygen is one of the key parameters to induce corrosion of substances. Thus, corrosivity inhibitors and corrosion preventive measures need to be put in place when higher concentrations of ethanol or methanol are used. As seen in Table 6 , no mass loss of the copper strips was recorded after the immersion period except for those immersed in neat ethanol, H3M2P (volume ratio of HFO:methanol is 3:2, P-PODE), H3E2P (volume ratio of HFO:ethanol is 3:2, P-PODE), and H3E2T (volume ratio of HFO:ethanol is 3:2, T-THF). However, the obtained rates of corrosion in these samples could be regarded as negligible. Very low corrosivity rates as that of the current study has been reached by the HFO-biofuel blends in Kass et al. [51]. The macro view and mass loss of the copper strips show that the proposed fuel blend systems in the current study have little or no corrosivity risk. However, it should be noted that longer study time and other physical changes can significantly vary the observations made in this section."
13,Sulfur content of blends; case for methanol against HFO,"3.5 Sulfur content of blends; case for methanol against HFO SOx emissions have been a major concern in the shipping industry and this has led to several regulations and sanctions from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The mission of IMO is to reduce ship related emissions worldwide [84]. The sulphur content of crude oils generally falls in the range of 1–4 wt% [85]. Thus, in 2016, IMO agreed to implement a global sulfur cap of 0.5% by 1st January 2020 compared to the previous 3.5% [11,86]. For Emission Control Areas, all marine vessels were required to have a fuel with a sulfur content of not more than 0.1% compared to the 1% in 2010 [12]. Thus, it is estimated that at least 70% of current marine fuels need to be changed or modified to meet these IMO regulations [12]. In addition, the increased demand for low sulfur content marine fuel is estimated to increase marine fuel prices by 50–100% [87]. On the other hand, to reduce the sulfur emissions from direct use of HFO, shipowners may have to install expensive scrubber systems on top of their maintenance cost, the huge amount of space it occupies, and corrosion problems [88]. Moreover, the scrubbers increase fuel consumption by 1–3% [89]. In the study of Zincir et al. [24], partially premixed combustion of methanol released zero SOx in marine engine. Thus, a relatively better route to limiting these sulfur emissions could be through the use of HFO-biofuel blends. Hence, this section also analyzes the theoretical reduction of the fuel blends' sulfur content. Fig. 6 shows that several studies on emissions and alternative fuels for the shipping industry has been performed since the start of the 21st century. Low carbon alcohols and the co-solvents have very no sulfur content, and biodegrades quickly, thus, could help shipowners comply with the strictest emission regulations [90]. By assuming a sulfur content of 0.001 % by mass for low carbon alcohols, and co-solvents as compared to the 1.0 % of neat HFO (low sulfur HFO), the theoretical sulfur content of HFO-methanol-PODE/THF/n-butanol is estimated. Fig. 9 and Table 5 show that the resulting sulfur content of the blends ranges between 0.44 and 0.88%. From the results, speculations could be made that at 50, 30, and 20 vol%, HFO, low carbon alcohols, and co-solvents, respectively, the blend at least meet the global 0.5 wt% sulfur content cap. Increasing the concentration of the oxygenated fuels in the blends could significantly reduce the SO2 emissions from ships, which may lead to substantial reductions in ambient SO2. However, fuel properties such as lower heating value, cetane number, and lubricity need to be carefully considered for such higher biofuel concentrations. This is very evident in Table 5; as the sulfur content is being positively adjusted with increase in biofuel concentration, key fuel properties such as cetane and lower heating value are being negatively adjusted, which could be detrimental to the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of the ternary blend."
14,Economic analysis of ternary blends; a case for methanol against HFO + scrubber system,"3.6 Economic analysis of ternary blends; a case for methanol against HFO + scrubber system Concern over fuel consumption, and energy efficiency marine diesel engines has grown significantly in recent years as seen in Fig. 6. Fuel consumption accounts for at least 50% of the total cost of running a marine vessel [12]. Methanol could be a very promising fuel for the shipping industry. Efficiencies of methanol-combusted marine engines have been reported to be similar to diesel, with its emissions positively meeting or surpassing existing pollutant emission regulations [91]. As seen in Table 5 and Fig. 9, at 50 vol% HFO, 30 vol% low carbon alcohol, and 20 vol% co-solvent, the ternary systems had sulfur content within IMO regulation, hence no need for scrubber installation. Thus, this blend system is adopted for the economic analysis relative to that of HFO + Scrubber system in this section. Assumptions and data are collected from a relevant study for the analysis as performed by Iannaccone et al. [92]. The fuel consumption for the case ship was estimated at 13, 941, 549 kg per trip and 10, 145, 825 kg per trip using methanol and HFO, respectively [93,94]. Amongst the several physico-chemical properties of fuels. Its fuel consumption rate is largely affected by the fuel’s lower heating value. Hence, the difference in the fuel consumption can be attributed to HFO’s higher energy content (39 MJ/kg) than that of methanol (19.58 MJ/kg) [12]. The lower heating values (LHV) of the ternary system as seen in Table 5 lies between that of neat HFO and methanol. Thus, assumptions could be made that their fuel consumption will also be in the range of the neat fuel samples. Linear interpolation is employed to estimate the fuel consumption of the ternary system based on the LHV and fuel consumption of the neat fuel samples. The case ship made 24 trips per year and ship life time of 10 years is assumed in the current analysis, accumulating a lifetime trip of 240 [93]. Our analysis in this section is therefore based on the lower heating values of the fuels and their blends, total trip taken, scrubber cost, fuel consumption due to scrubber, and unit cost of fuels. The total cost of this hypothetical trip is illustrated in Table 7 . The economic analysis revealed that neat methanol and ternary blends with n-butanol were a relatively cheaper pathway to limit sulfur emissions compared to that of HFO + scrubber system over the lifespan of the marine vessel. However, the blends with THF and PODE showed an opposite trend to this observation. These two ternary systems by the end of the 10th year had accumulated higher cost than that of neat HFO + scrubber. The relatively higher unit price of the two co-solvents compared to that of neat HFO and methanol may explain the economic disadvantage of the blends. Nevertheless, it is worth stating that, the ternary blend with n-butanol was the most economic feasible system, followed by THF with PODE being the most expensive option. It should be noted that, due to their liquid nature, the blends can be used in existing storage, distribution, and bunkering infrastructure with slight modifications [95]. This nullifies any debate regarding cost for new infrastructure. Furthermore, investment costs for methanol retrofit and new build solutions are estimated to be lower than installing exhaust gas after treatment systems (scrubber) for use with heavy fuel oil [26]. Thus, when some of these factors are considered, the blends could become more cost competitive with the HFO + scrubber system. It should also be noted that the cost of the biofuel is likely to decrease as production will base more on non-food crops and also non-fossil fuel sources, which could make biofuel consumptions in marine engines more profitable."
15,Conclusion,"Low carbon alcohols can play an essential role in decarbonizing the shipping transport sector, and also potentially enable the advancement of other alternatives such as hydrogen, ammonia, green electricity, biodiesel, etc. at scale. The introduction of policies, regulatory framework, and more research funds can ensure that the maritime transport sector becomes a major player in the development and deployment of alternative transport fuels for emission reductions across the world. In this study, HFO-biofuel blends are prepared with the aim of converting HFO into a cleaner and greener fuel as well as reducing fossil fuel depletion and its related environmental pollution. Temperature-dependent systems of HFO-low carbon alcohol-PODE/THF/n-butanol blends were investigated for their miscibility, viscosity, corrosivity, sulfur content and economic feasibility. The conclusions from the study are as follows. 1. The co-solvents could improve the miscibility of the HFO-methanol/ethanol blend for at least two days. The order of solubility in methanol-containing systems is PODE > THF > n-butanol, whereas that of ethanol-containing systems is THF > PODE > n-butanol. 2. An increase in temperature for THF and n-butanol-containing systems made the miscibility of the blends easier. However, that of PODE was dependent on the type of alcohol. 3. When the concentration of HFO is limited to not more than 70 vol%, the ternary blends achieved a kinematic viscosity well below that of a pre-heated HFO. The ternary blends accrued a viscosity reduction between about 60–98% when compared to an unheated HFO·THF had the most reduction effect followed by PODE, with n-butanol being the least viscosity modifier. 4. The risk of corrosivity of the blends ranged from very low to negligible. However, more co-solvents would be required at higher concentrations of ethanol or methanol in ternary systems, which could increase the risk of corrosion of the fuel blends. 5. Sulfur content of blends at ≤ 60 vol% HFO met the International Maritime Organization global sulfur cap limit of 0.5%. Neat methanol as fuel option for SOx reduction was the most economic feasible among the five systems investigated. The ternary system of HFO-methanol-co-solvents was economically inferior option to HFO + scrubber system. 6. Going forward, future works will ascertain the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of or proposed fuel blends against pure HFO, to appreciate its complete feasibility for marine engine applications."
