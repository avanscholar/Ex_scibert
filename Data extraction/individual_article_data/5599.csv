0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is generally regarded as the most promising carrier for the future energy system [1]. Producing hydrogen from renewable sources and utilizing hydrogen in high-efficiency fuel cells or engines may significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Hydrogen is, in fact, a clean synthetic fuel, which when burnt with oxygen, emits water vapor as its sole by-product. The development of a hydrogen economy (that is production, storage, distribution and consumption) is today quite difficult, due to technological problems, hydrogen storage being the most important one [1]. Several methods of hydrogen storage are currently considered such as the use of high pressure or liquefied H2 tanks, the adsorption on activated carbon or carbon nanotubes, the pyrolysis of metal hydrides (e.g. LiH, MgH2) and the hydrolysis of chemical hydrides (NaBH4, KBH4, LiBH4) [2]. In terms of energy cost, high pressure and liquefaction are not preferred due to the fact that extra energy losses must be taken into account in the pressurization and liquefaction processes [3]. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are currently considered among the most advanced systems for energy production starting from hydrogen, both for stationary and portable applications [4]. They are applied particularly in the automotive and the household goods sector, for example to replace rechargeable batteries. The performances of PEMFCs are sensitive to the concentration of carbon monoxide in hydrogen which causes the poisoning of the Pt anode catalyst [5,6]. When hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of hydrocarbons or alcohols followed by water gas shift reaction, it is still contaminated with around 1% of CO and the complete purification in order to abate the CO concentration (below 50 ppm) is a difficult task. Nowadays hydrolysis of chemical hydrides is receiving special attention as an ideal source of pure hydrogen for PEMFC [7,8]. Among different hydrides, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is regarded as the most promising due its high theoretical gravimetric (10.9 wt%) and volumetric hydrogen densities [9–15]. Moreover, sodium borohydride is non-flammable and non-toxic. Finally the by-product, namely sodium metaborate (NaBO2), is environmentally friendly [10] and can be recycled for re-synthesizing NaBH4 [16,17]. Sodium borohydride reacts with water, generating 4 mol of hydrogen and 1 mol of sodium metaborate, according to the following reaction: NaBH 4 + 2 H 2 O → NaBO 2 + 4 H 2 . This is an exothermic reaction releasing approximately 217 kJ mol−1 of NaBH4 reacted [18]. To inhibit the self-hydrolysis reaction, NaBH4 solutions must be maintained at pH >13. At this pH, in fact, NaBH4 is very stable and the hydrogen release occurs only if the solution is in contact with specific catalysts, permitting the ideation of “hydrogen on demand” systems (HOD) where H2 is released only when there is a request from the application [18,19]. For example, at pH 14 and 25 °C, NaBH4 solution has a half-life of 430 days. It is important to note that the use of an excess of water under real conditions, in order to avoid NaBO2 precipitation, sensibly decreases the hydrogen gravimetric capacity of NaBH4 hydrolysis below the requirement of US Department of Energy (DOE) (9 wt.% by 2015). However, it is our opinion that this reaction is still worthy of being further investigated, considering that different approaches to overcome this serious drawback have been recently reported, such as, for instance, the use of water steam generated by the same fuel cell [20]. In the presence of suitable catalysts the hydrolysis and hence H2 generation can take place even at 25 °C and high pH values [21]. The first catalysts to be studied in the early 1950s were acids and transition metals working in the homogeneous phase [21]. Since then numerous catalysts have been investigated with special attention devoted to heterogeneous catalysts based on Ru [9,10,19,22–27], Co [3,28–32], Pt [12–14,33,34], Ni [35–37], Pd [19,38,39]. Heterogeneous catalysts are, in fact, considered more suitable for hydrogen supply on demand applications in so as the rate of hydrogen generation can be easily controlled by regulating the flow rate of the NaBH4 solution over the catalyst, thus matching the hydrogen request of the application [19]. An other controlling way of the hydrogen flow, suggested by Xia et al. [40] is inserting/removing catalyst into/from the NaBH4 solution. Even though Ni and Co have attracted much attention for the NaBH4 hydrolysis due to their lower cost compared to noble metals, Ru can be considered the most appropriate system for HOD applications due to the much higher activity of this metal. It is well known that the support can strongly affect the catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts. In fact, the support can directly take part to the reaction, for instance favoring the adsorption of the reactants/products or being involved through acid/basic sites, or can also have an indirect role by optimizing the dispersion of the catalytically active components and stabilizing them against sintering [41]. It is also known that the precursor used for the addition of the active species on the support can influence the performance of supported metal catalysts, affecting the distribution and the particle size of the active metal over the support [42,43]. In this context the aim of the present work is to investigate the NaBH4 hydrolysis over Ru catalysts on different supports (γ-Al2O3, CeO2, TiO2, activated carbon), focusing in particular on the effect that different metal precursors can have on the catalytic performance of the Ru/activated carbon system, resulted to be the most active one. Moreover, considering that the hydrolysis of NaBH4 is a strong exothermal reaction and therefore the knowledge of the kinetic expression is fundamental to the rational design of a reactor on board, we also carried out kinetic experiments on the Ru/activated carbon catalysts in order to obtain more insight in this key field. Indeed some reports have appeared on the kinetics of metal catalysis [24,26,44,45]. However, the results obtained were not fully consistent. Zhang et al. [26] reported that the hydrolysis was zero order at low temperatures and first order at high temperatures with respect to NaBH4 when Ru catalyst was used, whereas Guella et al. [44] reported that the hydrolysis was first order with respect to NaBH4 when Pd catalyst was used. Finally Shang et al. [45] found that the hydrolysis of NaBH4 over ruthenium catalyst is zero order with respect to NaBH4 when water is sufficient."
1,Material and methods,"Supported Ru catalysts were prepared by incipient wet impregnation of the support with aqueous solutions of the precursors (RuCl3 from Sigma Aldrich or Ru(NO)(NO3)3 from Alfa Aesar) having an appropriate concentration of the metal. The supports used were γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 221 m2 g−1), TiO2 (Degussa P25, 51 m2 g−1), CeO2 (prepared by precipitation according to the procedure elsewhere reported [46], 180 m2 g−1) and a commercial activated carbon (Nymco DX40, 1059 m2 g−1). The samples were coded as XXYZ/SS where the first two letters (XX) indicate the metal, the third number (Y) the content of the metal (wt.%), the forth letter (Z) the metal precursor (N for Ru(NO)(NO3)3, C for RuCl3) and the two last letters SS, after the slash, the support used (Al = γ-Al2O3, Ce = CeO2, Ti = TiO2, AC = activated carbon). Catalytic activity tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a 100 ml three-neck flask batch reactor, equipped with a magnetic stirrer (300 rpm). The central neck was used to admit both the solution and the catalyst into the flask, the two lateral necks were respectively used to insert the thermocouple monitoring the reaction temperature and to connect the flask to a gas flow meter measuring the volume of H2 evolved. Two different series of experiments were carried out, one in the absence of reaction temperature control and the other one maintaining the reaction temperature at a constant value (±0.5 °C) by circulation of ethylene glycol in an external jacket connected with a thermostat. Sodium borohydride solutions (10 wt.%) were prepared by dissolving sodium borohydride (Fluka, purity >96%, used without further purification) into a 4 wt.% NaOH solution. In the experiments carried out without reaction temperature control the NaBH4 solution (20 ml) was poured into the flask, waiting until the temperature reached a constant value, then the catalyst (0.15 g, 14–20 mesh grain size) was added to the solution. In the experiments carried out at constant temperature, in order to favor the temperature control, the NaBH4 solution (15 ml) was mixed with 25 ml of a 4 wt.% NaOH water solution, then poured into the flask, waiting until the temperature reached a constant value, then the catalyst (0.1 g, 14–20 mesh grain size) was added to the solution. The volume of evolved hydrogen was measured by a gas flow meter and was transformed to the value at standard temperature and pressure (STP). Catalytic activity was measured in terms both of H2 yield, considered as the ratio of the volume of hydrogen experimentally evolved and the theoretical one obtainable on the basis of the reaction stoichiometry, and initial reaction rates, calculated from the slope of the curves conversion versus time (t) at t = 0. Before catalytic experiments, samples were reduced in flowing hydrogen at 300 °C for 1 h. Ru dispersion was measured by CO chemisorption, carried out in a conventional pulse system operating at room temperature. Before the measurements, the samples have been pre-treated by reduction in flowing hydrogen at 300 °C for 1 h. Temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) tests were carried out in a conventional flow apparatus with a TCD detector, at heating rate of 10 °C/min using 5 vol.% H2 in Ar. Before tests samples were dried in an oven at 120 °C for 2 h. Surface area measurements were carried out using the BET nitrogen adsorption method with a Sorptomatic series 1990 (Thermo Quest). Before the tests all samples were outgassed (10−3 Torr) at 120 °C. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out by using a Jeol, JEM model 2010 instrument. The powdered samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and a few droplets of the suspension were deposited on a Cu grid coated by a holey carbon film. After the solvent evaporated, the specimens were introduced into the microscope column. The average Ru size diameter estimated by TEM (d TEM) was calculated using the following formula: d TEM = ∑ di/ni , where di is the diameter of particle i and the index i is included from 1 to n (number total of Ru particles). Scanning electron microscopy was carried out by using a ZEIS model LEO 1550 equipped with EDX OXFORD instrument MOD 7426. Before analysis the samples were Pt-coated to prevent specimen charging."
2,Results,
3,Catalytic activity without temperature control,"3.1 Catalytic activity without temperature control Fig. 1 shows H2 yields as a function of time on stream over 2 wt.% Ru catalysts on different supports (γ-Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2 and activated carbon) prepared using Ru(NO)(NO3)3 as Ru precursor. It must be underlined that these experiments were carried out starting the reaction at room temperature (T = 25 °C) without temperature control, which was, in fact, found to increase during the exothermic reaction. From the figure it can be observed that the support used has a key role in addressing the performance of the investigated Ru catalysts, the activity being in the order: Ru2N/AC > Ru2N/Ce > Ru2N/Ti > Ru2N/Al. It is interesting to note that on activated carbon and ceria supported catalysts the reaction reaches completion after 70 and 150 min respectively, whereas on titania and alumina supported samples the maximum yields were only 30% ca. after 150 min of reaction. Considering the above catalytic trend, we have chosen the activated carbon as support to investigate the role of the Ru precursor and Ru loading towards the catalytic performances. Fig. 2 reports H2 yields as a function of time on stream (T in = 25 °C) over activated carbon supported Ru catalysts prepared from different precursors and Ru loadings. It can be noted that for each precursor the activity increased on increasing the Ru content. Moreover a strong effect of the precursor used can be observed, samples prepared by RuCl3 being sensibly more active than the corresponding ones prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3. It is noteworthy that the 1% wt. Ru sample prepared by RuCl3 (Ru1C/AC) is more active than that prepared by Ru(NO)NO3 with a double Ru content (Ru2N/AC). In Fig. 3 the H2 generation rate profiles and the corresponding measured reaction temperatures over Ru2N/AC and Ru2C/AC catalysts are compared (T in = 25 °C). The results clearly indicates that the generation rate is very low for the sample prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3, on which a maximum of 100 ml/min was reached after about 35 min. A much more high H2 production rate production was instead obtained with the sample prepared by RuCl3, with a maximum rate of 700 ml/min ca. after 15 min, value which appears really interesting from a practical point of view for HOD applications."
4,Catalytic activity at fixed controlled temperature and kinetic measurements,"3.2 Catalytic activity at fixed controlled temperature and kinetic measurements In a second series of experiments NaBH4 hydrolysis was carried out in isothermal conditions, maintaining the reaction temperature at a constant value (±0.5 °C), as reported in the experimental section. This procedure allowed to compare the real ability of each catalyst to promote the hydrolysis reaction ruling out the effect of the temperature increase occurring in the previous series of tests carried out without temperature control. A comparison among H2 yields obtained at 35 °C over investigated catalysts is shown in Fig. 4 . Data of this figure confirm the activity trend reported in the case of catalytic tests carried out without temperature control. In order to calculate the kinetic parameters for the investigated reaction for each catalyst the total volumes of H2 produced as a function of time on stream at four different temperatures were measured. As a representative example Fig. 5 shows data obtained for the Ru2C/AC sample at 15, 25, 35 and 45 °C. Considering that H2 generation, as a function of time on stream, showed a good linearity in the first portion of data, it is possible to point out that the NaBH4 hydrolysis over Ru/activated carbon catalysts is a zero order reaction with respect to NaBH4. This agrees with data reported in the literature on Ru catalysts supported on activated carbons under similar reaction conditions (temperature and NaBH4 concentration) [26,45]. Therefore, assuming a zero order reaction, initial rate constants and apparent activation energies were calculated for each catalyst and the results are summarized in Table 1 . From data reported in Table 1 it is possible to note that the constants increase on increasing the Ru content. Moreover the samples prepared by RuCl3 exhibit higher value compared to the corresponding Ru(NO)(NO3)3 ones. Finally, activation energies range from 53 to 64 kJ mol−1, with samples prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3 having higher values compared to those prepared by RuCl3. Comparable values (ranging from 47 to 59) were reported in the literature on supported Ru catalysts [9,10,47]."
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.3 Catalyst characterization In order to verify the resistance of the supports used (activated carbon, ceria, titania, alumina) under reaction conditions, SEM analysis was carried out on bare supports before and after the contact with a solution of NaOH 1 M (for 15 h) with the aim of simulating the alkaline reaction medium (pH = 13). Fig. 6 reports SEM images of all supports before and after the contact with alkaline solution. It can be noted that activated carbon (a, b), ceria (c, d) and titania (e, f) do not show a significant surface modification. On the contrary in the case of alumina (g, h) a strong surface modification can be observed after the contact with the alkaline solution. Ru dispersion values of investigated samples, calculated by CO chemisorption data, are reported in Table 1. It must be reminded that the metallic dispersion of supported metal catalysts, namely the ratio between the surface and total amount of metallic species, is related to the size of the surface metallic species. Data in Table 1 show that Ru catalysts prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3 exhibit dispersion values much higher than the corresponding samples prepared by RuCl3, pointing out that Ru particles of the Ru2N/AC sample are much smaller than those of the Ru2C/AC sample. Fig. 7 shows TEM microphotographs of the Ru2C/AC catalyst at three different magnifications (Fig. 7a–c). Ru metal particles are well visible, being homogeneously distributed on the carbon surface. The average particle diameter was 2.4 nm. The Fast Fourier Transformation obtained by TEM micrographs (inset of Fig. 7(a)) clearly shows the diffraction pattern of Ru with a hexagonal structure, with diffraction rings at 2.34 Å, 2.05 Å and 2.13 Å, thus confirming the chemical nature of the dispersed nanoparticles. Fig. 8 reports TEM microphotographs of the Ru2N/AC catalyst. Differently from that observed on the Ru2C/AC catalyst, in the case of the Ru2N/AC sample Ru particles are not distinguishable from the support. In fact, TEM images strongly resembles those of the bare support, shown in Fig. 9 . With the aim to confirm the presence of metallic Ru on investigated Ru2N/AC and Ru2C/AC samples, EDX analyses were carried out on both samples and spectra are shown in Fig. 10 . The EDX analysis clearly indicates that metallic ruthenium is present on both samples, showing the Ru signals, deriving from the orbital levels L1, Lα1, Lβ1. Interestingly the Ru signals present in EDX spectra of both Ru2N/AC (Fig. 10(a)) and Ru2C/AC (Fig. 10(b)) samples are similar in height, pointing to a comparable metal content on both samples. On the basis of CO chemisorption data before discussed, it can be reasonably suggested that Ru nanoparticles in the Ru2N/AC sample are very small and below the instrument sensitivity under our experimental conditions (1 nm). In Fig. 11 H2-TPR profiles of 2% Ru/AC catalysts prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3 and RuCl3 are reported. This technique is extensively used in the characterization of supported metal catalysts, providing information on the reducibility of metallic precursors used for the catalyst preparation, which can affect the morphology and the chemico–physical properties of the resulting active metallic species [48]. The relative positions of the reduction peaks in the TPR diagram can be used to grade the interaction between the metal and the support, with lower reduction temperatures indicating a more facile reduction of the metal species and therefore a weaker metal–support interaction or a higher accessibility of the precursor or both. The TPR profile of the Ru2C/AC sample (Fig. 11, dotted line) exhibits a broad reduction peak between 100 and 250 °C, with a maximum at around 190 °C and an evident shoulder at lower temperature (130 °C), thus pointing to the occurrence of different metal–support interactions and/or metal precursor accessibility. In the case of the Ru2N/AC sample the reduction peak is much narrower and shifted at higher temperature (maximum at 270 °C), denoting a more difficult reduction of the Ru(NO)(NO3)3 precursor compared to RuCl3. A higher reduction temperature of ex-Ru(NO)(NO3)3 catalysts compared to RuCl3 ones has been also reported on other supports (MgO, SiO2) and attributed to a stronger metal–support interaction degree of the Ru(NO)(NO3)3 precursor [42,49]."
6,Discussion,"On the basis of results reported in the previous section it can be stated that the support has a crucial role in addressing the performance of supported Ru catalysts. It was found, in fact, (Fig. 1) that Ru/activated carbon catalysts exhibit the highest activity among all investigated supported (γ-Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2, activated carbon) Ru samples. This well agrees with literature data, where carbon is regarded as a very appropriate support for the NaBH4 hydrolysis, providing optimum properties and stability [50]. In particular, Ru/AC [51], Pt/AC [34,52,53] or Pd/AC [39] catalysts have been reported to exhibit excellent hydrogen generation rates. It can be reasonably proposed that the very good performance of Ru/AC catalysts are related both to the high surface area of the activated carbon (higher than 1000 m2 g−1), which should favor the spreading of the active metal over the support surface, and to the high chemical inertness of carbon in a strong basic environment [38,39]. Effectively, apart from the Ru/Al2O3 sample, the order of activity observed, namely Ru/AC > Ru/CeO2 > Ru/TiO2 > Ru/Al2O3, well fits the order of surface area of the investigated supports, the higher the surface area the more active the Ru catalyst. The very low activity of the alumina supported catalyst can be related, in accordance to the literature [26,30], to the fact that the strong basicity of the water solution used to stabilize NaBH4 exerts a disgregating action toward the alumina, leading to a severe crumbling of the alumina grains after the reaction. Effectively SEM analysis of samples carried out after the contact between the support and the basic solution (Fig. 6) confirmed a strong alteration of the surface in the case of the alumina sample, whereas no significant modifications of the surface were observed in the cases of ceria, titania and activated carbon samples. Catalytic activity data also pointed out that the Ru precursor used for the preparation of Ru/AC catalysts affects the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction (Figs. 2–4), catalysts prepared by RuCl3 being sensibly more active than those prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3. Characterization data, namely Ru dispersion (Table 1) and TEM analysis (Figs. 7–9) showed that the particle size of Ru nanoparticles on the carbon support strongly depends from the Ru precursor used, Ru(NO)(NO3)3 resulting in much smaller Ru nanoparticles compared to RuCl3. The obtainment of Ru catalysts with higher dispersion using Ru(NO)(NO3)3 has been reported in the literature in the case of ruthenium supported on metal oxides (MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, H-ZSZM5 zeolite) [42,43,49,54,55]. It has been proposed that polymeric hydroxy-species of Ru chloro-complexes are formed in RuCl3 aqueous solutions, leading upon reduction to large Ru particles [54,56]. It is however worth of note that TPR data (Fig. 11) put in evidence that the reduction of the RuCl3 precursor on the activated carbon starts at a relatively low temperature (100 °C) and takes place in a quite broad temperature range, denoting a low reduction kinetic. This should lead, during the Ru precursor reduction step in the course of the preparation of the catalyst, to the initial formation of a small number of Ru atoms on the support surface, which acts as nucleation centers activating H2 and promoting the further reduction of RuCl3 on top of them, thus causing the enlargement of Ru particles [43]. On the contrary, on samples prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3 both the higher reduction temperature and the narrower reduction range of the Ru precursor favor the simultaneous formation of a high number of Ru atoms thus resulting in small Ru nanoparticles. Moreover the presence of a support as the activated carbon, with a very high surface area (>1000 m2 g−1), facilitates the spreading of Ru precursor over the entire carbon surface, thus leading to the formation of very small Ru particles (diameter < 1 nm). On the basis of the above characterization results it can be reasonably suggested that NaBH4 hydrolysis on Ru/activated carbon is a structure sensitive reaction which is favored by larger clusters, which are more abundant on the ex-RuCl3 samples than on ex-Ru(NO)(NO3)3 ones. This behaviour points out that active sites in the NaBH4 hydrolysis are made of ensembles of Ru adjacent atoms on which the reagent molecules (H2O and NaBH4) are adsorbed to form the activated complex. Therefore the catalytic activity should be related to the probability of finding such ensembles, being higher on larger metal nanoparticles [57], as those present on the ex-RuCl3 catalysts. Another possible hypothesis which would account for the observed data is related to the possibility that part of very small Ru nanoparticles, predominant on the ex-Ru(NO)(NO3)3 sample, enter pores of the activated carbon, which has a structure essentially made by micropores (<2 nm), becoming less accessible to reagents in the liquid phase [58]. However kinetic data, reported in result section and summarized in Table 1, support the hypothesis of a structure sensitive reaction. In fact, the activation energy for the ex-RuCl3 samples (55 and 53 kJ mol−1 respectively for Ru2C/AC and Ru1C/AC catalysts) is lower with respect to the ex-Ru(NO)(NO3)3 samples (64 and 63 kJ mol−1 for Ru2N/AC and Ru1N/AC respectively), pointing to the easier formation of the activated complex on the ex-RuCl3 samples. Therefore it can be proposed that both the support and the Ru precursor, used for the preparation of supported Ru catalysts, concur with a synergic effect to direct the Ru particles size, thus determining the performance of the catalytic system. In our case the use of a high surface area activated carbon as support and of RuCl3 as Ru precursor results in Ru nanoparticles homogeneously distributed on the surface with average diameter of 2.4 nm, which resulted to be very active for the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction. Further studies are in progress using ruthenium catalysts supported on activated carbons with different morphologies in order to better clarify which is the Ru nanoparticles optimal size for this reaction."
7,Conclusions,"On the basis of the results reported in this paper the following conclusions can be drawn: a) The support has a strong effect on the NaBH4 hydrolysis activity, which was found to be in the order: Ru/activated carbon >> Ru/CeO2 > Ru/TiO2 > Ru/γ-Al2O3. The best performance of Ru/activated carbon catalysts were related both to the high surface area of the activated carbon and to its high chemical inertness in the strong basic environment. b) On Ru/activated carbon the activity was found to strongly depend on the Ru precursor, samples prepared by RuCl3 being more active than the corresponding ones prepared by Ru(NO)(NO3)3. c) On the basis of characterization data (CO chemisorption and TEM analysis) it was suggested that NaBH4 hydrolysis is a structure sensitive reaction favored by larger Ru clusters. d) Considering the very high activity of Ru/activated carbon samples prepared by RuCl3 as Ru precursor, this catalyst appears to have a great potential for HOD applications in small portable devices and niche applications."
