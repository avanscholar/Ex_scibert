0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols (HA) are being increasingly applied in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, detergents, and polymers [1,2] as well as alternative fuels, gasoline additives, and hydrogen carriers [3,4]. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO attracts growing attention as a potentially more sustainable pathway to synthesize these compounds compared to fossil fuels-based technologies, since syngas can also be derived from unconventional natural gas and renewable resources [5,6]. Since its discovery back in the 1920s [7], this reaction has not reached industrialization, mainly due to the limited activity and HA selectivity of the catalysts developed. In order to attain superior systems, a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the transformation should be gathered, which is challenging in view of its inherent complexity [6]. Molecular-level insights have hardly been sought after by experimental methods, while computational catalysis, including Density Function Theory calculations, has been applied more extensively to clarify the roles of the active metals typically employed (i.e., Cu, Co, Fe) [8–10]. Yet, these studies are limited by the material and pressure gaps, as defect-free surface models are investigated under unrealistic reaction conditions. Focusing on CuFe-based systems [11–17], the most promising catalysts reported comprise carbon nanofibers [18] and silica as support and are promoted by K [12,19–22]. The former system achieved a HA selectivity of 47% and showed a remarkably low CO2 selectivity (10%). Among the silica materials applied, a bimodal solid led to a more efficient catalyst, which could also attain a HA selectivity of 47%, but produced more CO2 (28%) [12,21,22]. Based on their compositional similarity to silica, we conceived to study zeolites as novel carriers for CuFe catalysts, expecting that the possibility to precisely control their porosity and acidity could unlock additional benefits. Specifically, since Brønsted-acid zeolites were shown to mediate olefins hydration [23–25], implementing such sites in the carrier could valorize the olefins obtained as secondary products, due to the competitive Fischer-Tropsch activity of Fe upon HA synthesis, hence improving the overall HA selectivity. Indeed, Fajula et al. identified mordenite (7 < Si/Al < 9) as a superior candidate for but-1-ene hydration, but ZSM-5, offretite, and zeolite Y were active too [24], and Iwamoto et al. derived a volcano-shaped dependence of the catalytic activity of zeolites, regardless of their structure, on the Al content in ethylene hydration [25]. Here, the effect of adding an acidic function and a secondary mesoporous network to zeolite carriers for Cu and Fe on the performance in HA synthesis was explored, focusing on the MFI framework owing to its compositional and structural flexibility. Catalysts supported on MFI solids with distinct Si/Al ratio were characterized in depth to verify the similarity of the metal phases and decouple their effect from that of acidity. Based on the alterations in products distribution observed upon their testing, the reactivity of methanol, primary alcohols (1-HA), secondary alcohols (2-HA), and hydrocarbons was investigated on a strongly acidic zeolite through individual feeding experiments, uncovering an intricate reaction network. The incorporation of K as a promoter was attempted through distinct approaches, i.e., ion exchange, deposition, and their combination. At last, the use of a zeolite as a stand-alone phase in series to a CuFe catalyst supported on carbon nanofibers, which produces a large fraction of olefins, was studied to assess whether the HA selectivity could be boosted through olefins valorization while simultaneously increasing the catalyst productivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Various MFI zeolites were used as carriers for CuFe catalysts. Silicalite with a bulk Si/Al ratio of 1060 was purchased in protonic form (Tosoh Corporation, HSZ-890/HOA, denoted as Z1000) and was used as received. Hierarchical silicalite (denoted as HZ1000) was prepared by treating Z1000 in aqueous NaOH (Merck-Schuchardt, 99%, 0.2 M, 338 K, 33.3 gzeolite dm−3, 30 min) using an Easymax™ 102 (Mettler Toledo), followed by quenching in an ice-water mixture. The solid was recovered by filtration, washed extensively with water, dried at 338 K overnight, and converted into the protonic form by ion exchange in aqueous NH4NO3 (Acros Organics, >99%, 0.1 M, 298 K, 10 gzeolite dm−3, 8 h, 3 cycles), followed by calcination in static air at 823 K (ramp rate = 5 K min−1) for 5 h. MFI zeolites with nominal bulk Si/Al ratios of 15, 40, and 140 (Zeolyst Ltd., denoted as Zx, where x is the bulk Si/Al ratio) were delivered in ammonium form and calcined as described above, to convert them into the corresponding protonic forms. Z40 samples partially (KZ40p) and fully (KZ40) exchanged with potassium were obtained by three consecutive treatments of the as-received Z40 in aqueous KNO3 (1.0 mM and 0.1 M, respectively, 10 gzeolite dm−3, 8 h). The zeolite recovered by filtration after the third treatment was washed with deionized water (1 dm3 gzeolite −1), dried, and calcined under the same conditions as for the other samples. Supported CuFe catalysts with a molar Cu/Fe ratio of 2 and CuFe loading of 5 wt% were prepared by dry impregnation. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.278 g, Aldrich Fine Chemicals, 98–103%) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.232 g, Aldrich Fine Chemicals, >98%) were dissolved in an amount of deionized water equal to the pore volume of the carrier and added drop-wise to the support (2.00 g, except KZ40p) under magnetic stirring. The size of the magnetic bar was carefully selected to ensure an effective mixing. The resulting solid was kept under stirring for 30 min, dried in air at 338 K overnight, calcined in air at 573 K (3 K min−1) for 3 h, and reduced in a 10 vol% H2/He flow of 20 cm3 STP min−1 at 673 K (3 K min−1) for 4 h. These catalysts were denoted as CuFe/(K)Zx. As reference materials, Cu and Fe were individually deposited onto Z40 following the same synthesis protocol above. To produce K-promoted CuFe catalysts supported on Z1000, Z40, and KZ40, K2CO3 (0.59–5.9 mg, Aldrich Fine Chemicals, 98–103%) was added to the Cu- and Fe-containing solution prior to the impregnation. Molar K/(Cu + Fe) ratios of 0.01 were targeted for all catalysts, while ratios of 0.005 and 0.05 were additionally considered only for Z1000-supported materials. These catalysts were denoted as KCuFe/(K)Zx-y, where y corresponds to the nominal molar K/(Cu + Fe) ratio. A K-promoted carbon nanofibers-supported CuFe catalyst with a molar Cu/Fe ratio of 2, a CuFe loading of 5 wt%, and a molar K/(Cu + Fe) ratio of 0.005, was prepared by a sol-gel method according to our previous work [18]. In brief, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (2.773 g), Fe(NO3)3·6H2O (2.319 g), and K2CO3 (5.94 mg) were dissolved in deionized water (11.5 cm3). A few drops of NH4OH (Acros Organics, 25 wt% aqueous solution), were added to the mixture under magnetic stirring and a dark green precipitate was formed. Upon addition of a citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥95%) solution (1.323 g in 3 cm3 of water), the precipitate redissolved and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3.5 using formic acid (Merck product, 98–100%). An aliquot of this mixture was added drop-wise to carbon nanofibers (2.00 g, Aldrich-Fine Chemicals, Fe content <100 ppm) at 338 K to attain the desired metals loading and was kept under magnetic stirring for 6 h. The solid (labelled as KCNF) was then dried in air at 338 K overnight and reduced in a 10 vol% H2/He flow of 20 cm3 STP min−1 at 673 K (3 K min−1) for 4 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The K, Si, and Al contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a Horiba Ultra 2 instrument equipped with a photomultiplier tube detector. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) was performed using an Orbis Micro-EDXRF spectrometer equipped with a Rh source operated at 35 kV and 500 μA and a silicon drift detector to obtain the molar Cu/Fe ratio and CuFe loading of the supported catalysts. N2 sorption at 77 K was measured in a Micromeritics TriStar II instrument after degassing the samples at 573 K under vacuum for 3 h. The surface area of supports and catalysts was calculated by applying the BET method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro-MPD diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm), acquiring data in the 10–70° 2θ range with an angular step size of 0.033° and a counting time of 8 s per step. The size of metallic copper crystallites was estimated by using the Scherrer equation. Temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) was carried out using a Micromeritics Autochem 2950 HP unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and coupled to a Pfeiffer Vacuum Omnistar TM GSD-320 quadrupole mass spectrometer. 0.050 g of the sample were dried in an Ar flow of 20 cm3 STP min−1 at 423 K for 1 h and cooled to 323 K before the temperature was ramped up to 973 K (10 K min−1) in a 5 vol% H2/Ar flow of 20 cm3 STP min−1 for the analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of adsorbed pyridine was conducted in a Bruker IFS 66 spectrometer. The samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers of ca. 1 cm2 and degassed under vacuum (10−3 mbar) at 473 K for 4 h, followed by pyridine adsorption at room temperature. Gaseous and weakly adsorbed molecules were removed by evacuation at 473 K for 30 min. Spectra were acquired collecting 32 scans in the range of 650–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) were conducted in a FEI Talos F200A instrument equipped with a high-brightness field emission gun, a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector, and a large collection angle EDX detector, operated at 200 kV. Catalyst powders were dispersed on nickel grids coated with a continuous carbon film."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing The direct conversion of syngas to HA was carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor setup, which is described in detail elsewhere [26]. Typically, 0.5 g (sieve fraction = 0.05–0.12 mm) of undiluted catalyst were loaded into the reactor and purged with an Ar (Messer, ≥99.999%) flow of 100 cm3 STP min−1 for 0.5 h at ambient pressure. For hybrid catalytic beds of KCNF and a zeolite (Z40, Z140, and KZ40p), 0.25 g of each components were used and mixed- and dual-bed configurations were considered. In the former case, the two solids were physically mixed for 15 min before transferring to the reactor, whereas in the latter, KCNF comprised the top layer and was separated from the zeolite by a layer of quartz wool. These configurations were referred to as KCNF+zeolite-m and -d, respectively. Under the same flow, the pressure was then increased to 5 MPa and a leak test was conducted. The catalyst was activated by exposing it to 10 vol% H2/Ar at the same rate as previously applied at 0.5 MPa and 573 K (3 K min−1) for 3 h. The reaction was carried out by feeding a mixture of H2 (PanGas, ≥99.999%), CO (Messer, ≥99.997%), and Ar with a molar H2/CO/Ar ratio of 6/3/1 at 543 K and 5 MPa. The feed flow rate was varied (WHSV = 4000–34000 cm3 STP gcat −1 h−1) in order to compare different systems at the same CO conversion level (4%). The data collected represent the average value of 4–5 measurements taken between ca. 11–15 h on stream. The CO conversion (X CO) was calculated using Eq. (1): (1) X CO = n CO,in - n CO,out n CO,in · 100 % where n CO,in and n CO,out are the molar flows of CO (expressed in mmol h−1) at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively. The selectivity to product i (Si ) was calculated using Eq. (2): (2) S i = n i ,out N c , i ∑ n i ,out N c , i · 100 % where ni ,out and Nc,i are the molar flow of product i and the number of carbon atoms in product i, respectively. The selectivity to HA was obtained summing the individual selectivities to alcohols with 2 or more carbon atoms, while that to hydrocarbons summing the individual selectivities to hydrocarbon with 1 or more carbon atoms. The space-time yield of HA (STY HA) expressed in gHA gcat −1 h−1 was calculated using Eq. (3): (3) ST Y HA = ∑ S j ,HA M W j ,HA X CO n CO,in m cat where m cat is the mass of the catalyst and MWj ,HA is the molecular weight of (higher) alcohols containing j carbon atoms. The carbon balance (ε C) was determined according to Eq. (4) and was always higher than 95%. (4) ε C = n CO,in - ∑ n i , out N c , i n CO,in · 100 % Feeding experiments were conducted by introducing individually methanol, primary alcohols (molar ethanol/propan-1-ol/butan-1-ol/water = 1/1/1/2), secondary alcohols (molar propan-2-ol/butan-2-ol/water = 1/1/2.5), olefins and paraffins (propene/propane/but-1-ene/butane/water = 1/1/1/1/3.5) in the presence of Ar or syngas mixture (H2/CO = 2) over Z40. The liquid or gas was introduced at a total concentration of 2% and a space velocity of 8000 cm3 gcat −1 h−1 to mimic the outlet stream conditions at a conversion level of 4%."

6,Impact of zeolite acidity and porosity on catalytic performance,"3.1 Impact of zeolite acidity and porosity on catalytic performance A series of CuFe catalysts were prepared by dry impregnation using MFI zeolites with different nominal molar Si/Al ratios as supports and applying a molar Cu/Fe ratio of 2 and a metals loading of 5 wt% based on previous results on CNF-supported CuFe [18]. Compositional analysis of the calcined solids (Table 1 ) revealed that the bulk molar Cu/Fe ratio and CuFe loading were in good agreement with the nominal values. The surface areas of the commercial carriers [27–30] moderately reduced upon metals impregnation, calcination, and reduction, as expected (Tables 1, 2 and Table S1 in the Supplementary Material). The concentrations of Brønsted-acid (C BAS) and Lewis-acid (C LAS) sites, determined by FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine, increased with their Al content and were in line with reported values [30–32]. Unfortunately, the acidic properties of the catalysts could not be reliably determined. Analysis of calcined CuFe/Z40 indicated a substantial depletion of Brønsted-acid centers and the formation of Lewis-acid sites, which might be explained by a partial ion exchange of protons by the metals in the zeolite and the intrinsic Lewis-acidity of the metal oxides, respectively. XRD of the calcined catalysts did not evidence any phase in addition to the MFI zeolite structure, suggesting that metal oxides were highly dispersed. Upon reduction, metallic Cu was detected for all catalysts (2θ = 43.5 and 50.6°, Fig. S1). Based on the Scherrer equation, its particle size ranged from 9.3 to 15.2 nm, with smaller particles being formed on zeolites with higher surface area. Reflections specific to metallic Fe (2θ = 44.8 and 65.2°) were only observed for CuFe/Z1000 and CuFe/Z140 (Fig. S1), but no particle size estimation was possible owing to their strong overlap with those of the zeolite. The H2-TPR profiles of the calcined samples evidenced two main peaks centered between 465 and 481 and 565–587 K, attributed to the reduction of CuO to Cu and of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, respectively (Fig. 1 ) [33]. The multicomponent nature of these signals suggests the presence of oxide particles of different size and location, maybe due to a combination of deposition and ion exchange upon synthesis. For CuFe/Z1000, the CuO reduction peak has a low-temperature shoulder assigned to the reduction of isolated CuO to Cu2O [34]. In the case of CuFe/Z15, a broad signal due to the reduction of Fe3O4 to Fe is evident between 673 and 973 K, indicating a better reducibility of Fe as a consequence of a higher dispersion or a greater contact with the Cu phase that can facilitate hydrogen spillover to the iron. Still, the reducibility of the metals was quite similar in all samples in spite of the distinct acidity, except for CuFe/Z15. The zeolite-based catalysts were assessed in the direct synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas at 543 K, 5 MPa, a molar H2/CO ratio of 2, and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4000 cm3 gcat −1 h−1. The catalysts displayed differences in activity: the CO conversion was 25% over CuFe/Z1000 and progressively decreased to 5% over catalysts with gradually more acidic carriers. All catalysts reached a steady performance after 2–3 h on stream and no deactivation was observed during the remainder of the run (up to 15 h). In line with this, TGA of used CuFe/Z40 confirmed the absence of substantial coke deposits (4% mass loss only). The WHSV was then adjusted to evaluate their product distributions at the same CO conversion level (4%, Table S2). In all cases (Fig. 2 a), the HA selectivity fell in a narrow range (30–35%), but the amount of 2-HA increased at the expense of 1-HA over more acidic materials, being 10 and 63% of the HA over CuFe/HZ1000 and CuFe/Z15, respectively. For all materials, hydrocarbons predominantly comprised paraffins, the selectivity of which increased with the Al content (up to 48%). In contrast, the olefins selectivity dropped from 11% over CuFe/Z1000 to 2% over CuFe/Z15. Methanol was only produced on CuFe/Z1000, whereas higher Al contents facilitated dimethyl ether (DME) formation (selectivity = 7% over CuFe/Z15). The CO2 selectivity increased from 5% over CuFe/Z1000 to 13% over CuFe/Z15. Analyzing the repartition of oxygenates and hydrocarbons for distinct chain lengths (Fig. 2b and c) evidenced that the formation of propanols, mainly 2-propanol, and methane was boosted while that of ethanol, heavier alcohols, and propane/propene was significantly suppressed in the presence of Z140, Z40, and Z15. The increase of the methane selectivity at the expenses of that to ethanol hinted that CO insertion was hindered. Based on these catalytic data, CuFe/Z140 would be the most suitable catalyst to target secondary HA production, exhibiting a high selectivity to these species while better preserving activity. XRD analysis of the used solids did not evidence any diffraction line specific to metallic Fe in any sample. It is expected that iron carbides formed upon exposure to syngas, in line with copious literature on Fischer-Tropsch and HA synthesis [15,35], and previous microscopy evidence by us [18], the reflections of which are masked by those of the carrier. Cu particles experienced moderate sintering in all cases (ca. 20 nm, Table 2 and Fig. S1). Since the surface Cu/Fe ratio determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) proved to have minimal relevance as a stand-alone descriptor in HAS in our previous study [18], this technique was not applied here. To gain better understanding of the metals morphology, representative used samples were inspected by STEM-EDX instead. In CuFe/Z40, well-defined Cu and Fe particles with average sizes of ca. 17 and 12 nm, respectively, were observed along with a minor fraction of highly dispersed species, likely originating from the high density of ion-exchange sites of the support (Fig. 4a). For CuFe/Z1000, Cu and Fe were only evidenced in the form of particles with average diameters of 19 and 12 nm, respectively, mostly visible at the external surface of silicalite (Fig. 4b). While accessing the actual surfaces of metallic Cu and Fe would be very valuable, their reliable determination is very cumbersome and would require a dedicated study. Indeed, none of the probe molecules typically applied (CO, NO, N2O, H2) selectively adsorbs on either Cu or Fe, their adsorption stoichiometry on the two metal differs, and some species interact with acidic zeolites too. In view of the similarity of the H2-TPR profiles of CuFe/Z40 and CuFe/Z1000 (Fig. 1), it is inferred that the finely distributed Cu and Fe might still be in cationic form and not substantially contribute to the reaction. Hence, the difference in selectivity patterns are mostly determined by the carrier’s acidity. Using the density of Brønsted-acid centers in the supports to obtain qualitative trends (Fig. 3 ) indicates that the formation of 1-HA, methanol, and olefin was suppressed, the generation of CO2 and paraffins was facilitated, and a volcano relation was observed for the production of 2-HA for an increasing acidity. The shifts in product distribution can be explained as follows. (i) 2-HA are likely formed from olefins through acid-catalyzed hydration. Indeed, acids such as H2SO4 and H3PO4 were reported to mediate this reaction [36], and bare zeolites of different topologies (i.e., MOR, MFI, FER, USY) were also examined back in 1990s for the transformation of ethylene or propylene to their respective 2-HA through water cofeeding [24,25]. (ii) DME production is speculated to be due to methanol dehydration over the acid sites [37–39]. The decrease in DME selectivity at higher WHSV corroborates that it is a secondary reaction. (iii) The high paraffins selectivity indicates that C* hydrogenation and coupling are more easily followed by acid-catalyzed consecutive reactions than by CO and CHO insertion to form HA. This implies that Fe works well as a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, but the action of Cu of providing molecularly activated CO is hindered. To examine the role of the carrier’s porosity, a CuFe catalyst with equivalent metals content and ratio was prepared impregnating a silicalite sample that was desilicated in an alkaline medium (HZ1000) attaining porous and acidic properties matching literature data (Tables 1, 2 and S1) [30]. Based on XRD, both Cu and Fe in the reduced catalyst were more dispersed than in CuFe/Z1000, the Cu particles (8.6 nm) being slightly larger than the mesopores introduced in the zeolite (7.8 nm) and thus likely accommodated on the external surface of the support (Table 2). According to H2-TPR (Fig. 1), CuO reduced at a relatively low temperature (453 K), consistently with the small particle size, while the partial reduction of Fe2O3 occurred at a comparatively higher temperature (703 K), suggesting that the increased dispersion led to a more limited contact among the two metals. CuFe/HZ1000 displayed comparable CO conversion and selectivity pattern to CuFe/Z1000 (Table S2). Since the metals dispersion did not significantly change after use in the reaction (Table 2 and Fig. S1) the increased availability of Cu and Fe was counterbalanced by their diminished proximity. This is in line with our previous findings on CuFe catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes, which featured channels and metal particles of similar size to those in CuFe/HZ1000, but were moderately inferior to CNF-based solids carrying larger Cu and Fe particles closer to each other [18]. Accordingly, no further investigations were conducted on CuFe/HZ1000."
7,Reaction network,"3.2 Reaction network To gather a deeper understanding of the mechanistic fingerprints of the reaction over acidic zeolites, hydrocarbons, methanol, 1-HA, and 2-HA that were mostly produced over CuFe/Z1000, i.e., in the absence of acid sites, were individually fed over Z40 along with Ar and an amount of water corresponding to that would be formed according to the stoichiometry of HA synthesis. Upon feeding C3−4 hydrocarbons, propane and butane remained unaltered, while olefins underwent a nearly full conversion (Fig. 5 a), half transforming into their corresponding 2-HA via hydration and half converting into C5−7 olefins and paraffins through coupling, partially followed by cracking [40]. When feeding methanol, ca. 55% of this alcohol was converted into C3−7 hydrocarbons with selectivities decreasing with the carbon number, DME, and a small quantity of ethanol (Fig. 5b). Olefins mainly contributed to the hydrocarbons, with pentene being the dominant olefin. This finding is in line with the wide literature on ZSM-5 as a catalyst for methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-hydrocarbon [41–44]. Considering the introduction of C2−4 1-HA, more than 80% of ethanol and butan-1-ol and 60% of propan-1-ol were transformed (Fig. 5c). Ethanol primarily generated heavier compounds (C3−7) and a small amount of ethane, in agreement with the reported activity of ZSM-5 for ethanol-to-gasoline at high temperature (673–773 K) and ambient pressure [45]. C3 products mainly comprised 2-HA, a considerable amount of paraffins, and a minor fraction of olefins. Within the C4 species, olefins were the main constituents, followed by 2-HA and paraffins. C5−7 paraffins and olefins were produced to a similar extent and essentially had comparable selectivities to propane and butane. These results hinted that 1-HA dehydration to olefins occurs, followed by either rehydration to 2-HA or coupling and cracking. When feeding C3−4 2-HA, less than half of each alcohol was converted (Fig. 5d). C3 products included propane and propan-1-ol in similar quantity and a trace amount of propene. In the C4 fraction, a substantial quantity of but-2-ene was observed as a consequence of butan-2-ol dehydration. Butane and butan-1-ol were present in minor amounts. The formation of 1-HA indicated that olefins could be partially hydrated at the primary carbon even if this chemoselectivity is electronically unfavored. C5 − 7 species comprised similar amounts of paraffins and olefins. The same product distributions were determined when the different mixtures of compounds were fed under a syngas environment rather than with Ar, substantiating that the zeolites alone are inactive in CO hydrogenation. These experiments corroborated the hydration of olefins to 2-HA and the dehydration of methanol to DME, and highlighted the occurrence of coupling and cracking reactions leading to heavier hydrocarbons as well as the rehydration of olefins to 1-HA. The production of C3 − 7 olefins and paraffins from methanol explains why the methanol selectivity dropped more substantially than the DME selectivity increased at raising carrier’s acidity (Fig. 2b and c). The generation of long-chain hydrocarbons also justifies the shift in alcohols distribution toward higher molecular weight compounds, since part of the longer olefins could be further converted into 2-HA. In addition, the conversion of 1-HA into paraffins agreed with the observed decrease in 1-HA selectivity upon moving from Z140 to Z15. The chemical inertness of paraffins makes them the terminal products over Z40 and rationalizes their overall high selectivities. The types of chemical reactions involved in this network support the retention of a considerable fraction of Brønsted-acid sites of the carrier after metal deposition and activation. Aiming at supporting the intrinsic Fischer-Tropsch and methanol syntheses activities of Fe and Cu and uncovering additional possible functions, catalysts containing the two metals separately were prepared. In spite of the well-reproduced particle size, the Cu catalyst surprisingly was barely active. So was the Fe catalyst (Fig. S2, Tables S1 and S2), likely due to the missing assistance of Cu in its reduction. Reduction at higher temperature was not helpful since the Fe phase sintered to an excessive extent. Even if not experimentally substantiated, we envisage that the metals will facilitate the hydrogenation of olefins obtained as primary byproducts and through coupling, further increasing the paraffins selectivity. These findings also indirectly substantiate the good interaction of Cu and Fe in the bimetallic catalyst. The interplay of reactions occurring over CuFe/Z40 is summarized in Scheme 1 ."
8,Potassium promotion of zeolite-supported CuFe catalysts,"3.3 Potassium promotion of zeolite-supported CuFe catalysts Since K enhanced HA production over CoMo/CNF and CuFe/CNF, we explored the impact of this alkali metal also on zeolite-supported CuFe, approaching its incorporation in distinct manners. K was deposited onto Z1000 and Z40 simultaneously to Cu and Fe upon dry impregnation. In addition, Z40 was ion-exchanged with K to generate a solid (KZ40), which was then impregnated with Cu and Fe or K along with the metals. A K/(Cu + Fe) ratio of 0.01 was applied in the deposition over all carriers and for CuFe/Z1000 ratios of 0.005 and 0.05 were additionally considered. All actual metal contents and ratios were close to the nominal values (Table 2). For CuFe/KZ40, the amount of K corresponded to 96% of the quantity required to replace all protons in ion-exchange positions in Z40. Accordingly, the acidic properties of this support resembled those of Z1000. Based on XRD, the presence of K in the synthesis facilitated the dispersion of Cu on Z1000, Z40, and KZ40 (Table 2 and Fig. S2a). In CuFe/KZ40, the Cu particles were moderately larger compared to the K-free analogue (Fig. S2b). Diffraction peaks of metallic Fe were identified only for KCuFe-Z1000-0.01 and KCuFe-Z1000-0.05 (Fig. S2). Since Fe agglomeration in the presence of K was observed for CNF-supported catalysts [18], it was deduced that too little K was present in the other catalysts to produce an effect either because of the lower amount applied or due to the loss of a portion of promoter through ion exchange within the carrier. Based on H2-TPR, the Cu phase was generally more reducible, as indicated by the pronounced low-temperature (400–450 K) shoulder of its peak (Fig. 6 a and b). The signal of the iron phase remained in a similar temperature range for all catalysts except KCuFe/KZ40-0.01, for which no reduction was detected. An additional feature was identified between ca. 760–900 K in the profile of KCuFe/Z1000-0.01, evidencing a higher reducibility of Fe oxide and a better contact with the more dispersed Cu phase. KCuFe/Z40-0.01 produced a distinctive curve, comprising a single peak with maximum at 528 K with a tail reaching up to ca. 790 K, which suggests a more hindered reduction of the metals. Catalytic testing of these samples under the same reaction conditions as their K-free analogues uncovered distinct activity levels. KCuFe/Z40-0.01 attained a similar CO conversion to CuFe/Z40 (ca. 5%), while CuFe/KZ40 and KCuFe/KZ40 reached higher values (ca. 20%). The addition of the smallest amount of K to CuFe/Z1000 resulted in a slight drop in CO conversion (18 versus 25% for CuFe/Z1000), while the highest K loading doubled the activity (48% for CuFe/Z1000-0.05, Table S2). At a conversion level of 4% (Fig. 7 ), the performance of CuFe/KZ40 was comparable to that of CuFe/Z1000, indicating that K in exchange position does not affect the action of Cu and Fe. Incorporation of K upon impregnation of Cu and Fe onto the pristine Z40 led to minor improvements compared to CuFe/Z40, slightly enhancing the already high 2-HA selectivity and halving the CO2 selectivity. Depositing K along with Cu and Fe on K-exchanged Z40 produced almost no effect, in striking contrast to the addition of the same amount of K to the acidity-wise analogue CuFe/Z1000. When comparing KCuFe/Z1000-0.005 with its K-free counterpart, the HA selectivity was enhanced from 33 to 41% chiefly at the expenses of paraffins. At a K/(Cu + Fe) ratio of 0.01, the HA selectivity reached 43%. While paraffins were formed to an only slightly inferior extent, the production of methanol and CO2 was more hindered. The latter reached a record value of 2%. At a higher K loading (ratio 0.05), the methanol and HA selectivities substantially dropped, and that of CO2 was greatly enhanced. Compared to the best KCuFe/CNF catalyst (here KCNF), KCuFe/Z1000-0.01 displayed a higher HA selectivity (43 versus 38%) and formed less methanol (7 versus 10%) and especially CO2 (2 versus 13%), but generated more paraffins than olefins among hydrocarbons. XRD analysis of the used materials revealed that the Cu phase sintered to some extent, but the particle size was somewhat smaller than in the used K-free samples (Table 2 and Fig. S2). STEM-EDX analysis of the best performer visualizes the presence of better dispersed Cu (15.4 nm) and more agglomerated Fe (13.2 nm) phases compared to the K-free counterpart (Fig. 4b and c), the higher contact among metals being the likely origin of the improved HA selectivity (Fig. 4c)."
9,Enhancing HA production using hybrid catalytic beds,"3.4 Enhancing HA production using hybrid catalytic beds Since acidic zeolite carriers facilitated 2-HA formation mainly through olefins hydration, but inhibited CO insertion, suppressing the catalytic activity, it was considered to apply an aluminosilicate as an independent material in combination with a catalyst highly selective to HA and olefins, such as KCNF [18], to catalyze the conversion of the latter into 2-HA while minimizing detrimental effects. Z40 was initially chosen and proved inactive in converting CO and H2 to any product as a stand-alone phase. The shift in products distribution was not favorable over a physical mixture of KCNF and Z40 (Table S3). Although the olefins selectivity dropped from 20 to 8% and a large quantity of 2-HA was produced, a considerable fraction of 1-HA (ca. 60%) was transformed to undesirable products, i.e., paraffins and CO2 (Fig. 8 ). In addition, no methanol was formed and a small amount of DME was attained. When a dual-bed configuration, with KCNF and Z40 in series, was applied, a similar interplay between olefins and 2-HA was observed, but the overall HA selectivity was moderately enhanced to 43%. The less pronounced loss in 1-HA was in agreement with a more moderate generation of paraffins and CO2. Based on these results, the less acidic Z140 was alternatively employed in the dual-bed design. A similarly high HA selectivity to the last scenario was obtained (44%), but 1-HA conversion to secondary products and olefins hydration to 2-HA were better balanced. Accordingly, less olefins were consumed and paraffins generated. Nonetheless, the CO2 selectivity increased to 17%. In order to further reduce the acidity of the second bed, Z40 was partially exchanged with K to produce KZ40p, which possessed half as much C BAS compared to Z140 (51 versus 99 μmol g−1). This approach was advantageous since the HA selectivity further increased to 47% and the CO2 selectivity dropped to 8%. By tuning of the reaction parameters (573 K, 5 MPa, H2/CO = 1, and WHSV = 32000 cm3 gcat −1 h−1), a HA selectivity of 45% was attained at a doubled CO conversion level (8%). The corresponding STY HA is 0.61 gHA gcat −1 h−1, which is higher than for the KCNF system alone by 15% and comparable to the value reported for the best HAS catalysts (0.63 gHA gcat −1 h−1) [46,47]."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, we gathered fundamental understanding of higher alcohols synthesis on zeolite-supported CuFe catalysts. Implementing acidic functions in the support, while mostly retaining metals structure and morphology, dramatically altered the selectivity pattern, inducing a substantial shift in the HA composition from primary to secondary alcohols, whereas the use of a hierarchically structured carrier produced negligible changes in the catalyst performance. Individual feeding of methanol and mixtures of selected primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and hydrocarbons over Z40 was instrumental to unravel the intricate network of reactions occurring in parallel and consecutively. Secondary alcohols originated from the hydration of olefins, formed through the parasitic Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, as well as from dehydration of the primary alcohols generated, followed by rehydration. Still, olefins also underwent coupling reactions with subsequent hydrogenation and cracking to paraffins, which are inert over the acidic zeolite. Potassium, a well-known promoter, led to beneficial effects if introduced by deposition simultaneously with Cu and Fe rather than by ion exchange or a combination of both methods: The HA selectivity augmented from 33 to 43%, while the CO2 selectivity reduced to an exceptional value of 2%. While adopting an acidic carrier is a suitable means to target the formation of secondary rather than primary alcohols, productivity is penalized. Still, a zeolite with tuned acidity can boost the HA selectivity of a catalyst producing a high fraction of olefins as byproduct if used alone in a second bed in series. When a mildly acidic aluminosilicate was added to a CuFe catalyst supported on carbon nanofibers, the copious amounts of olefins produced were valorized to secondary alcohols complementing the primary alcohols directly obtained from CO. Overall, this study shows how catalyst design and molecular understanding as well as reactor concepts hold promise toward overcoming current limitations of HA synthesis, such as controlling the chemoselectivity of oxygenates formation and enhancing productivity."
