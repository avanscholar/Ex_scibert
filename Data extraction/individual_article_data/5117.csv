0,Introduction,"Solar hydrogen production from water by heterogenerous photocatalysis is highly desirable for solving environmental and energy problems [1–8]. Generally, efficient hydrogen production requires tunable optical response, UV-visible activity, facile strategy for synthesis etc [9–11]. Metal oxides, mainly TiO2, have been extensively studied for photocatalytic application due to the superior stability and controllable synthesis [12,13]. The search for such materials has been focused mainly on modifying TiO2 via doping as in (V-, Fe or Mn-) TiO2 [14] and N-TiO2 [15] or coupling with other photoactive materials as in CdS/TiO2 [7,12] to meet these requirements. However, the efficiencies are still not satisfying [16,17]. Thus, it is meaningful to explore new materials for water splitting. Recently, nanostructured titanates, such as CaTiO3 [18], Bi2Ti2O7 [19,20], SrTiO3 [21–23], have attracted extensive attention due to their wide-ranging prospects as photocatalysts, photoelectrochemical devices, lithium-ion-battery materials, and high activity involved in fabricating delicate composites. It has been reported that the structures of these titanates are constructed from layers built up by edge- and/or corner-sharing of TiO6 octahedral, which forms a zigzag ribbon or a tunnel structure [24]. From the viewpoint of water splitting, such structures are suitable for the adjustment of catalytic active phases such as the better dispersion of noble metal, which probably lead to the more efficient separation and transfer of photo-induced carriers from such structures to the noble metal [25,26]. Thus, it is expected that these titanates could act as promising photocatalytic materials. On the other hand, due to the anti-bonding states between the lone electron pairs of Bi3+ and electrons in O2p orbital, the bismuth containing photocatalysts usually have a narrow band gap and promising photocatalytic efficiency, which are good candidates for photocatalytic water splitting [27,28]. Bismuth sodium titanate (Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, referred to as BNT) is a perovskite compound which has been widely used as piezoelectric sensors and actuators, and some long-term highly precise passive and active electronic components [29]. It has been reported that perovskites oxides containing Bi element would possess unique physicochemical properties due to their layered structure and the interesting lone electron pairs of Bi3+ [30,31]. However, the research on BNT as a photocatalyst has not begun until very recently. Photocatalytic water splitting by BNT is still undiscovered and remains unknown [32]. An overall and systematic investigation is thus necessary to reveal the photocatalytic water splitting properties of BNT and to clarify the factors affecting its photocatalytic abilities. Herein, we investigated hydrogen evolution from water on BNT under UV and visible light irradiation in the presence of sacrificial reagents. The as-obtained photocatalysts possess a perovskite structure and morphology of microspheres with average size of 500 nm. The effect of alkaline concentration on the photocatalytic activity has been elaborated systematically. Moreover, the BNT photocatalyst could be easily recycled without deactivation, indicating the satisfactory stability of BNT."
1,Experimental,"BNT powders were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) was used as bismuth precursor, tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OC4H9)4) as titanium precursor, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as sodium precursor and mineralizer [33,34]. All the reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 2.8 mL of Ti(OC4H9)4 and 1.94 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were added into 20 mL of deionized H2O. The mixture was stirred for about 3 h to obtain a homogenous white suspension. Then 20 mL of NaOH solution with different concentration (3 M, 6 M, 9 M, 12 M, 15 M), which was obtained in ice-water bath and closed environment to prevent the dissolution of CO2, was added rapidly into the suspension under constant stirring. After being stirred for another 2 h, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave up to 80% of the total volume. The autoclave was heated at 160 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The resulting samples were separated by filtration, washed with deionized water and absolute alcohol for several times, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured with a D/Max 2250 V diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation over the range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80°. The morphologies and microstructures of as-prepared samples were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM-6700F) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (JEOL JEM-2100F, accelerating voltage 200 kV). The accurate composition of the sample was obtained by using the Oxford INCA energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attachment of the JEOL JXA-8100 electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). The optical diffuse reflectance spectrum was conducted on a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010) using BaSO4 as the reference. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were conducted at 77.35 K on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 analyzer. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was estimated using the adsorption data. Pt was loaded on the surface of BNT by a photodeposition method that Kusumoto and co-workers reported [35]. BNT powders were added into a Pyrex flask containing a mixed solvent of H2O/2-propanol (35 mL/15 mL), including a required amount of H2PtCl6. The suspension was irradiated for 30 min by a Xe lamp under N2 atmosphere. Before irradiation, the mixture was ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min and the catalyst was maintained in the suspension under constant stirring. Photoreduction of H2PtCl6 to Pt particles took place and Pt was deposited on the photocatalysts surface. After irradiation, the filtered Pt-loaded samples were washed with distilled water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a gas-closed circulation system of a Pyrex cell with a top window. The photocatalyst powder (0.15 g) was dispersed by a magnetic stirrer in an aqueous solution (200 mL) containing 40 mL of methanol as electron donors for H2 evolution. This suspension was irradiated by a 500 W Xe lamp. The temperature of the suspension system was maintained at room temperature by providing a flow of cooling water during the photocatalytic reaction. The amount of H2 evolved was determined with on-line gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Nitrogen was purged through the cell before reaction to remove oxygen. The apparent quantum yield (Φ) was estimated by using Equation below, where it is assumed that all incident photons are absorbed by the reaction system. The bandpass filter (346 nm ± 8.6 nm) was used. Moreover, the rate of H2 evolution under 346 nm bandpass filter was 5.15 μmol h−1. The number of incident photons at 346 nm was estimated to be 4.27 × 1020 per hour. Apparent quantum yield ( % ) = ( Number of H 2 molecules evolved ) × 2 Number of incident photons × 100"
2,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of the products. All diffraction peaks are assigned to R-BNT (JCPDS No. 36-0340) when the NaOH concentrations ranged from 3 M to 15 M (referred to as BNT-3, BNT-6, BNT-9, BNT-12, BNT-15, respectively) [36]. No other impurities are found. From the intensities of the diffraction peaks and the full-width at half-maximum, it was revealed that crystallinity of BNT powders increases with increasing alkaline concentration up to 15 M, which was consistent with previous reports [33]. BNT possess perovskite structure constructed of three-dimensional corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra with metallic atoms occupying the space. Interestingly, R phase is characterized by opposite rotations of adjacent TiO6 octahedral along each axis, which consequently results in cell doubling of all three pseudo-cubic axes (Fig. 1b). Due to the delocalization of excitation energy and nonradiation transition caused by structural twist, photocatalytic properties of these compounds are of great interest [24,36]. The UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra of BNT powders were shown in Fig. 2 . The samples obtained at higher NaOH concentration exhibit a significant increase in photoabsorption, which is consistent with the crystallinity of samples. On the other hand, the band gap energies of the prepared samples were found to be changed from 2.82 eV to 2.92 eV with the different alkaline concentration, as shown in inset of Fig. 2. BNT-9 possesses the widest band gap among all samples. This might be due to the different size and morphologies of as-prepared samples. In the hydrothermal synthesis, alkaline concentration can be utilized effectively for well-controlled growth of nanostructures with desired morphology and size. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of BNT obtained with different NaOH concentration. All samples exhibited sphere-like morphology. However, at the low NaOH concentration of 3 M, large BNT particles with uneven size as well as non-spherical structures are found. The increase of alkaline concentration to 6 M resulted in the formation of microspheres with more uniform size. When the NaOH concentration was 9 M, the nanospheres exhibited the smallest size. Then, the size of BNT increased as the increase of alkaline concentration, suggesting that the alkaline concentration of 9 M was a critical point in the nucleation process of BNT [33,34]. The BET surface areas of BNT were shown in Table 1 . BNT-9 showed the largest BET surface area of 27.3 m2 g−1, which is consistent with the investigation of morphologies. EPMA was conducted to further confirm the element constituents of the photocatalyst (Fig. 3f). The selected analysis area was about 80 × 75 μm. Quantitative result gives the atomic ratio of 11.8:7.1:23.7:57.4 for Bi:Na:Ti:O, which is close to the reference value of 1:1:2:6 in Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3. The alkaline concentration therefore plays an important role in altering the reactivity of the starting precursors and controlling the morphology of the resulting products. The microstructure of BNT-9 was investigated, as shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a shows the microspheres are hierarchical, which are consisted of nanocrystallines with cubic structure. The size of the microspheres are estimated to be ca. 300 nm, which are in agreement with that of the TEM observations, as shown in Fig. 4b. The inset in Fig. 4b shows a typical selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern taken from a single microsphere. The spotty ring pattern was in consistent with the self-assembly feature of BNT. Moreover, the bright points suggested the well-crystallinity of nanocrystallines. Reaction conditions are known to affect the microstructure of the products significantly, leading to different crystallinity, size, surface area and photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting over BNT samples prepared with different NaOH concentration was investigated. Since the co-catalysts loaded on photocatalysts play an essential role in the process of water splitting which was considered to promote the separation of photo-excited electrons and holes, Pt was loaded on the surface of samples. The rate of hydrogen production of photocatalysts can be greatly improved after loading with Pt nanocrystals and the hydrogen yield reach the maximum rate of 325.4 μmol h−1 g cat−1 at a 3 wt% Pt loading, as shown in Fig. 5 . This expected quenching action of Pt indicates that Pt particles are very efficient traps for electrons in BNT system [37]. However, as the content of Pt loading was increased to 5 wt%, the hydrogen yield quickly decreases to 265.4 μmol h−1 g cat−1 and then slowly decreases to 225.8 μmol h−1 g cat−1 at 8 wt% Pt loading, which is due to a shielding effect of the Pt co-catalyst [38]. The TEM image of 3 wt% Pt-deposited BNT-9 in Fig. 6 shows that Pt particles are uniformly distributed on the surfaces of the microspheres. The particles sizes of Pt are on the nanometer scale, as shown in Fig. 6. No morphologic and structural differences have been observed between the as-prepared BNT microstructures and the Pt-loaded BNT microstructures. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of the rate of H2 evolution for different samples under simulated solar light irradiation. The average rates of H2 evolution were estimated when the reactions were conducted for 5 h. When the NaOH concentration was changed from 3 M to 9 M, the rate of H2 evolution on BNT increased accordingly. The maximum H2 evolution rate of 325.4 μmol h−1 g cat−1 was achieved on BNT-9 (Table 1). As the concentration of NaOH was increased to 15 M, the rate of H2 evolution decreased. The highest photocatalytic activity of BNT-9 may be contributed by the higher CB edge, smaller particle size and larger BET surfaces. According to the band gap of BNTs obtained from the inset of Fig. 2, the conduction band position of as-prepared BNTs are shown in Table 1. BNT-9 possessed the highest CB edge position which would allow for photo-induced electrons with higher energy, leading to more efficient hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the recombination opportunity of photogenerated electron-hole pairs will be efficiently reduced as the decrease of sizes of BNT. BNT-9 exhibited the smaller particle size as well as the higher BET surface areas, which resulted in shorter diffusion time of photo-excited electron-hole pairs and the increase of active catalytic sites [13], leading to the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for H2 evolution. The apparent quantum yield of BNT-9 was estimated to be 1.45% at 346 nm. To demonstrate the potential applicability in photocatalysis, we further investigated the stability of BNT. A typical reaction time course of H2 evolution over BNT-9 was shown in Fig. 8 . The reaction was conducted for 5 h in each run and the reaction system was evacuated after each run. A considerable amount of H2 was evolved, with an average rate of 369.8 μmol h−1 g cat−1, and the highest rate reached 426 μmol h−1 g cat−1 during the forth run. The total amount of generated H2 was over 1.11 mmol for 0.15 g catalysts, and the turnover number exceeded 1.0 after 20 h of irradiation with UV and visible light, which indicates that the reaction proceeds photocatalytically. After four run tests in one continuous reaction without adding sacrificial reagents, the rate of H2 evolution keeps stable. When the light was turned off (dark test) and the reaction cell was evacuated, no H2 evolution was observed. The BNT photocatalyst could be easily recycled without deactivation, indicating that the stability of BNT is satisfying and the photocorrosion is neglectable during the photocatalytic H2 evolution from water, which is especially important for potential application."
3,Conclusion,"In summary, we newly developed a titanate photocatalyst of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 for H2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents under UV and visible light. The structure, morphologies and photocatalytic H2 evolution of BNT have been systematically investigated and the alkaline concentration was found to play crucial roles in the physicochemical properties and the photocatalytic activities. Interestingly, the as-prepared BNT exhibited R-phased perovskite which is characterized by opposite rotation of adjacent TiO6 octahedral along each axis. Such twist could result in the delocalization of excitation energy and nonradiation transition which is important for promoting the photocatalytic activities. Further studies are ongoing. Among all samples, BNT microspheres prepared with 9 M of NaOH exhibited the highest rate of H2 evolution, which could be due to the highest conduction band edge and the smallest particle sizes, leading to the suppression of electron-hole recombination. The larger BET areas also suggest the absorption of more light and the increase of reaction sites. The apparent quantum of BNT-9 was estimated to be 1.45% at 346 nm. More importantly, the quaternary system could evolve H2 stably from methanol solution without deactivation, which is meaningful for further study."
