0,Introduction,"Currently, selectively hydrogenating α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to obtain allylic alcohols (UAAs) has been widely applied for the synthesis of a broad range of important chemical intermediates including flavors, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals [1], has gained considerable attention. Nevertheless, due to lower activation energy, the CC reduction in this reaction is preferential to the CO reduction. Correspondingly, many efforts have been devoted to the improvement of UAAs yields in the hydrogenation α,β-unsaturated aldehydes through developing high-performing catalyst systems [2–5]. Typically, selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) bearing an unsaturated CO group and a conjugated CC one to produce cinnamyl alcohol (COL) still keeps a challenging task. In the past decade, numerous heterogeneous noble metal (e.g. Pt [2,6–8], Pd [9,10], Rh [11], and Ir [12]) catalysts have been extensively explored in the above reactions. Generally, Pt-based catalysts were found to be more satisfactory in the CO reduction than other noble metal ones. To achieve high catalytic performance of catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity to UAAs, especially, alloying Pt with second metals (e.g. Cu-Pt [13], Pt-Co [13,14], Pt-Fe [15], Pd-Sn [16], and Pt-Sn [17]) and surface modification of promoters (e.g. FeOx [18], Mo2N [19]) have been made. These employed strategies can contribute to preferential activation and adsorption of carbonyl group in reactant molecules, thus improving the UAAs selectivity and/or the activity in most cases. Additionally, the metal-support interactions often play an important role in efficiently tuning the catalytic performance [20–24]. The often-arising problem, however, is that most of catalysts may attain high selectivity at the expenses of catalytic activity [25–27]. Therefore, developing new highly efficient catalytic systems for hydrogenating α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is especially crucial to the production of desired UAAs with high yields. On the other side, as one of the most commonly used and ideal catalyst supports, carbon materials have received more and more attention. Different carbon materials have been adopted to stabilize Pt nanoparticles (NPs) for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [15,28–31]. For resulting supported Pt catalysts, strong electronic interactions between the carbon support and active species formed can not only regulate surface property of active metal sites but also prevent the aggregation and growth of Pt particles. Recently, we synthesized carbon-supported monometallic Ni and bimetallic PdNi catalysts by a two-step hybridization-reduction method through a composite precursor route [32,33]. However, it was found that the formed supported catalysts did not benefit the CO reduction in CAL, due to their instinct nature of metallic Ni or Pd species. In this study, we developed series of carbon-supported cobalt oxide-decorated platinum nanocatalysts via a composite precursor route, which involved the assembly of amorphous carbon and PtCl6 2−-intercalated ternary Mg-Co-Al layered double hydroxide composites (LDHC) through the carbonization of glucose and following self-reduction process. The formed carbon-supported cobalt oxide-decorated platinum nanocatalysts were investigated for liquid phase hydrogenation of CAL to produce UAAs. Our results demonstrated that as-fabricated CoOx-decorated Pt-based catalyst (Co/Pt molar ratio: 0.6) yielded an extraordinarily high COL yield of 99% under mild reaction conditions. Such exceptional catalytic efficiency was closely correlated with the synergy between metallic Pt and CoOx species in the catalyst and strong metal-support interactions (SMSIs). The present findings offers a better understanding of the role of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) decorated by an inexpensive nonprecious metal in selectively hydrogenating α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of samples,"2.1 Synthesis of samples PtCl6 2−-intercalated MgCoAl-LDH catalyst precursors were prepared by the coprecipitation approach. First, Mg(NO3)2∙6H2O (0.12 M), Al(NO3)3∙9H2O (0.06 M), Co(NO3)2∙6H2O, and H2PtCl6∙6H2O (4 mM) were dissolved into decarbonated deionized water, and then titrated by a LiOH aqueous solution (0.3 M) with vigorous stirring under N2 atmosphere until the pH value reached 10.0. The suspension was aged at 70 °C for 24 h, centrifuged and then washed. The resulting precipitate was dispersed into 60 mL of glucose solution ([M2+ + Al3+] = 0.4 [C6H12O6]). The mixture solution was aged at 150 °C for 10 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The obtained precipitant was washed with deionized water, and then dried at 70 °C overnight. The obtained solid was named as LDH-C-x (x = 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9), where x is the [Co2+]/[PtCl6 2−] molar ratio. Subsequently, the LDH-C-x samples were heated to 600 °C a rate of 5 °C min−1 under nitrogen and held for 3 h. The black supported Pt sample was named as Co-Pt/C-x. In addition, cobalt-free supported Pt sample (Pt/C) was also synthesized based on the above similar method to that of Co-Pt/C-x in the absence of Co(NO3)2∙6H2O."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The structure of samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns from a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The microstructure of samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and using a JEOL 2100 instrument at 80 ∼ 200 kV. High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were collected from a JEOL 2010F instrument equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. Elemental analysis of metals was performed on an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Shimadzu ICPS-7500). Before measurements, the sample was first calcined at 700 °C in air for 2 h to remove carbon, and then the remainder was dissolved in aqua regia. Low temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption data were obtained on a sorptometer apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The total specific surface areas were obtained according to the multipoint BET method. The mesopore size distributions were determined by the Barret−Jovner−Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted on a VG ESCALAB 2201 XL spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation. The graphite C1s peak at 284.6 eV was used to calibrate the binding energies. The Pt-L3 edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements for Pt-containing samples were carried out using a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator at beamline U7C in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). Monoxide carbon temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD) of samples was performed using a (Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2720 chemical adsorption instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The reduced sample (0.2 g) was heated to 500 °C at a mixture gas of CO and Ar (1:9, v/v) and held for 1 h, and then purged under Ar atmosphere for 0.5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was heated to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in an Ar flow (40 mL min−1). Based on the desorbed amount of CO, the Pt dispersion degree was determined assuming a Pt/CO stoichiometric factor of 1:1."
4,Catalytic hydrogenation,"2.3 Catalytic hydrogenation The selective CAL hydrogenation tests were conducted in a stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL), where 5.0 mL CAL, 50 mL ethanol, and 0.1 g catalyst were added into. First, pure nitrogen was purged into the sealed reactor at room temperature for three times to flush out of air. Then, the reactants were heated in the oil bath to a certain temperature. After replacing nitrogen with 2.0 MPa hydrogen, the hydrogenation was initiated through vigorous stirring. During the reaction, hydrogen was continuously supplied from the gas cylinder to maintain a constant pressure. When the stirring speed is more than 900 rpm, the present hydrogenation reaction does not have mass transfer limitations of external particles. The collected liquid product was analyzed quantitively by gas chromatograph (Agilent GC7890B) with capillary column (HP-5) and flame ionization detector (FID). Benzyl alcohol was used as an internal standard. In all cases, the carbon balances were more than 96%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of samples,"3.1 Characterization of samples During the synthesis of LDH-C composites, glucose aromatization and further carbonization could occur under the hydrothermal conditions, thus forming hybrid composite of PtCl6 2−-intercalated MgCoAl-LDH crystallites and the simultaneously generated amorphous carbon [34]. Subsequently, the carbon component in LDH-C composites could in situ reduce Pt species to generate highly dispersive metallic Pt NPs at higher temperatures. In addition to cobalt-free platinum sample (Pt/C), three CoOx-decorated Pt samples with different Co/Pt molar ratios of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 were also prepared. The physical properties and compositions of samples are summarized in Table 1 . In each case, ICP-AES analysis gives a total Pt loading of about 5.0 wt.% and the cobalt loading ranging from 0.4 to 1.3 wt.%, well consistent with the theoretical values. As shown in Fig. 1 , XRD pattern of representative LDH-C-0.6 shows characteristic diffractions for (003), (006), (012), (015), (018) and (110) crystalline planes of typical LDH-type materials [35]. The basal spacing value (d 003) of LDH-C-0.6 is approximately 0.82 nm, larger than that for carbonate-type MgAl-LDH (0.76 nm) [36]. It demonstrates that PtCl6 2− complex anions have entered into the interlamellar space of MgCoAl-LDH and the intercalation of PtCl6 2− anions does not destroy the well-ordered layered structure of LDH phase. In addition, the absence of the diffractions associated with graphite and/or other forms of carbon indicates the formation of noncrystalline carbon. Typically, XRD pattern of reduced Co-Pt/C-0.6 sample presents two broad and weak diffractions at about 40.3 and 46.3°, respectively, which can be indexed to the (111) and (200) crystalline planes of face centered cubic (fcc) metallic Pt0 phase. Such poor crystallinity of metallic Pt0 is probably corelated with the small-sized Pt crystals. However, no diffractions related to metallic cobalt or cobalt-containing oxide phases are detected, mainly due to the extremely low cobalt content. Meanwhile, poorly crystalline MgO-like phase can be observed [37], because of the structural collapse of MgCoAl-LDH precursor through calcination and following reduction processes, which result in the formation of MgO-Al2O3 mixed metal oxide phases (MMOs). Noticeably, XRD patterns of other three reduced Pt samples also present the characteristic diffractions of metallic Pt and MgO-like phases, and no other phases can be detected. Further, the average crystallite sizes of Pt particles in reduced samples, which were determined by using Debye-scherrer formula based on the (111) plane of Pt0 phase, are about in the range of 4.9–5.3 nm (Table 1). The morphology of different supported Pt samples was investigated by TEM analysis (Fig. 2 ). TEM images clearly depict that in each case, spheroidal black NPs are highly dispersed on the surface of MMOs and carbon matrix, and no aggregated NPs can be obviously observed. Based on the four histograms of the size distributions of Pt NPs over supported Pt samples (Fig. 3 ), the average size of Pt NPs is in the range of about 5.1–5.5 nm, indicative of the uniform size of Pt NPs. Noticeably, the average particle size of Pt0 NPs obtained by TEM based on more than 200 particles are in good accordance with that determined by XRD line broadening (Table 1). Further, a typical HRTEM image of representative Co-Pt/C-0.6 sample reveals a crystal plane spacing of about 0.227 nm, which is indexed as the (111) crystal plane of Pt0 phase, in good accordance with the above XRD results. Furthermore, the existence of relatively thin Pt NPs is an indicator of a strong surface interaction between metallic Pt phase and carbon support [38]. In view of TEM images for all supported Pt samples, it is concluded that uniform and small-sized Pt NPs can be governed effectively by the in-situ LDH-C assembly and resulting structural transformation. Further, the distributions of Pt and Co elements were characterized unambiguously by STEM measurements. Fig. 4 presents the STEM image and resulting Pt and Co elemental mappings for Co-Pt/C-0.6 sample. Obviously, no aggregates of NPs can be observed on the surface, while high-intensity of Pt and Co with relatively low intensity are uniformly distributed over the surface of an individual NP, indicating the successful modification of Pt NPs by Co species, although it is not easy to distinguish between Pt and Co-containing species in the STEM image. Therefore, the aforementioned STEM result distinctly illustrates the intimate contact of Pt NPs with Co-containing species on a single NP, suggestive of the strong interactions between them. Meanwhile, the enhanced Pt dispersion degree from 9.6% for Pt/C to 16.5% for Co-Pt/C-0.9 (Table 1) further demonstrates the successful decoration of Pt NPs by Co-containing species. In this case, amorphous carbon support combined with MMOs phase as dispersant agents can enhance the dispersion of formed Pt NPs and inhibit the aggregation and growth of Pt NPs and Co-containing species, thereby being beneficial to the formation of strong interactions between Pt NPs or Co-containing species and carbon support. The textural properties of supported Pt samples were disclosed by low-temperature N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. As shown in Fig. 5 , all samples present typical type IV adsorption−desorption isotherms with a H1-type hysteresis loop, indicative of the character of large pores formed between the interconnected large particles. Meanwhile, samples show the broad pore size distributions in the ranges of 2–100 nm (inset in Fig. 5). As listed in Table 1, the specific surface area of supported samples gradually decreases with the increasing of Co content. However, three cobalt oxide-decorated Pt samples still possess quite high surface areas (>317 m2/g). In this work, the small size of Pt NPs in samples should be attributable to uniform arrangement of Pt species in the brucite-like layers of LDH precursors, as well as the high specific surface areas of hybrid supports composed of plate-like MMOs and amorphous carbon. To investigate surface electronic structure of Pt species on samples, XPS characterization was conducted (Fig. 6 ). Because of quite low Co content, however, Co 2p signals do not appear in all Co-containing samples. Considering that the Al 2p region lies at the binding energy of around 84.3 eV, fine Pt 4f spectra are fitted with five contributions. Besides the Al 2p region, two large components at about 71.2 eV and 74.4 eV are assigned to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 core levels, which is characteristic of metallic Pt0 species [21,39]. Meanwhile, another two small components appearing at about 72.2 eV and 75.4 eV are assigned to cationic Pt2+ species. As shown in Table 1, the relatively high intensity ratios of Pt0 species to total Pt species determined by integrated areas demonstrate the reduction of most cationic Pt4+ species. Specially, compared with Co-free one, CoOx-decorated samples provide increased proportions of surface Pt0 species, probably due to the electron transfer from Co to Pt according to lower electronegativity of Co atom (1.9) than that of Pt atom (2.2). Such charge transfer is beneficial for the generation of electron-rich Pt0 and CoOx species, thereby probably influencing catalytic behavior to some extent [40,41]. To further determine the interactions between Pt NPs and CoOx species, EXAFS characterization was conducted (Fig. 7 ), where the photoenergy indicates the electronic structure of the Pt center. It can be clearly recognized that the Pt–L3 edge energies of two Pt/C and Co-Pt/C-0.6 are higher than that for Pt foil, indicative of the character of cationic Pt species. Meanwhile, compared with Pt/C, Co-Pt/C-0.6 slightly shifts to the lower energy, illustrating that Pt sites in the Co-Pt/C-0.6 tend to be more negatively charged, because the strong interactions between Pt NPs and CoOx species facilitate the electron transfer from Co to Pt. In addition, the O 1s core level of four supported Pt samples was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 8 . In the case of Pt/C sample, there is only a large peak (OI) at about 530.2 eV, which is assignable to lattice oxygen species on the surface in MMOs. It is interestingly noted that besides the large OI peak, a small peak (OII) appears at about 532.2 eV. Such a peak with the higher binding energy is associated with defect-oxide or hydroxyl species [42,43]. Notably, the proportion of OII species in the total oxygen species, which may determine the relative amount of surface defects in the lattice (e.g. oxygen vacancies, Ov), increases gradually from zero for Pt/C to 9.0% for Co-Pt/C-0.3, 12.8% for Co-Pt/C-0.6 and 18.1% for Co-Pt/C-0.9, indicative of the formation of more surface defects due to the increased amount of surface CoOx species. According to the above characterization results, we speculate that the structure of CoOx-decorated Pt samples is probably as follows: Pt species are mainly in the metallic state, while Co species can form CoOx clusters that cover the partial surface of Pt NPs. Correspondingly, the electron transfer may occur between Pt and CoOx species, generating electron-rich Pt0 species in CoOx-decorated Pt samples."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation performance of catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation performance of catalysts During the hydrogenation of CAL molecule concomitantly containing olefin and conjugated carbonyl groups, there exists several-step reactions generating diverse hydrogenation products. First, COL and hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) can be formed by hydrogenating carbonyl and olefin groups, respectively. Further, hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL) can be produced by hydrogenating COL and HCAL. In addition, small amounts of by-products can be observed due to the aldol condensation of acetal. On the other side, as a typical three-phase catalytic process, the external particle mass transfer limitation can be neglected in the present catalytic system due to a high agitation speed of 900 rpm. Meanwhile, Weisz–Prater numbers for both CAL and hydrogen are smaller than 0.15 over all samples, indicative of negligible limitations for pore transport diffusion [44,45]. Correspondingly, we can gain the intrinsic activity of catalysts in the present study. Under the same reaction conditions, different Pt-based catalysts were tested in the selective CAL hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 9 and Table 2 , noticeably, over the Co-free Pt/C catalyst, HCAL is the main product after a reaction of 2.5 h, whereas unsaturated COL is the main product over three CoOx-decorated ones. Notably, CoOx-decorated Pt catalysts exhibit much higher CAL conversions and COL selectivities than undecorated one. Specially, over the Co-Pt/C-0.6, the COL selectivity remains as high as 99.0% at 100% CAL conversion after a reaction of 2.0 h. In comparison, only 32, 69 and 71% conversions are gained over Pt/C, Co-Pt/C-0.3 and Co-Pt/C-0.9, respectively. Among these tested catalysts, the activity of Co-Pt/C-0.6 is the highest. In contrast, the undecorated Pt catalyst exhibits a lowest catalytic activity. More interestingly, a significant change in the COL selectivity is also found over four catalysts. Co-Pt/C-0.6 catalyst gives an extremely high COL selectivity of 99% at almost complete conversion after a reaction of 2 h, which is higher than those over Pt/C (37%), Co-Pt/C-0.3 (76%) and Co-Pt/C-0.9 (82%), indicative of a superior catalytic performance. It illustrates that the catalytic performance of Pt0 species can be greatly enhanced by the decoration of CoOx species. In the case of Pt/C comparison sample, a large amount of HCAL is produced through the hydrogenation of the olefin group in CAL. Over the Co-Pt/C-0.9, the formation of more HCOL is ascribed to the further carbonyl hydrogenation of COL [46,47]. Interestingly, as the reaction time is extended, no obvious change in the selectivity is observed in all cases, reflecting that active sites of catalysts have different activation abilities for the olefin and carbonyl groups in the reaction medium. The aforementioned results illustrate that the modification of Pt NPs by CoOx species plays a crucial role in governing the selective hydrogenation of CAL in terms of both the CAL conversion and product selectivities. On the other hand, as shown in Table 2, in contrast to that over the undecorated Pt/C catalyst, the turnover frequency (TOF) for CAL conversion over the Co-Pt/C-0.6 is greatly increased by 9.5 times. Surprisingly, the present Co-Pt/C-0.6 catalyst exhibits much higher catalytic activity and selectivity to COL in comparison with most previously reported Pt-based catalysts in the literature [4,7,21,47–52]. Evidently, the present Pt NPs modification by CoOx species greatly improves the catalytic performance of catalysts in the CAL hydrogenation to UUA. Previously, it was found that during CAL hydrogenation, CAL could be adsorbed on the metal surface through either both CC and CO bonds or CO bond parallel to the flat metal surface, and larger particles of catalytically active metals are beneficial to the carbonyl reduction due to the steric effect of aromatic ring [26,53]. The average particle sizes of Pt0 NPs in all Pt catalysts, however, are almost similar. Thus. the particle size effect cannot explain the change in their catalytic performances. Commonly, the catalytic behaviors mainly depend on surface properties of catalysts [54]. Compared with Pt/C catalyst, CoOx-decorated Pt catalysts provide more exposed metallic Pt0 species, as disclosed by XPS and CO-TPD analysis (Table 1), because surface CoOx species may break the continuous metal surface of Pt NPs into smaller ensembles to some extent. Notably, Co-Pt/C-0.6 catalyst yields a fastest rate of CAL conversion under the present identical reaction conditions. Despite the enhanced dispersion of Pt (Table 1), an excess amount of surface CoOx species in the case of Co-Pt/C-0.9 inversely inhibit the absorption of CAL on the metal surface due to steric effect, thus causing the reduced rate of CAL hydrogenation. It demonstrates that the rate of CAL conversion can be accelerated by an appropriate introduction of Co into catalysts [55]. On the other side, Pt/C catalyst shows both the lowest activity and the lowest COL selectivity, because undecorated Pt species easily exposes (110) and (100) faces, thus facilitating the parallel adsorption of CAL in the adsorption mode of both olefin and carbonyl groups. As for CoOx-decorated Pt catalysts, the preferential reduction of carbonyl group gives rise to the noticeable increase in the COL selectivity. Specially, Co-Pt/C-0.6 catalyst yields the highest COL selectivity. In the case, the surface modification of Pt atoms by CoOx species inhibits the parallel absorption of CAL on the metal surface, which can facilitate the carbonyl adsorption in the η1-(O) form. Moreover, electronic effect of NPs also can significantly affect the chemisorption and activation of reactants. The electron-rich state of metallic Pt0 species resulting from the intimate contact between Pt and CoOx species can benefit the carbonyl adsorption via back-bonding interaction between the metal sites and the π* orbitals of CO group [56]. In a way, cationic Co species in CoOx clusters can function as Lewis acidic sites to promote the reduction of carbonyl group through the H2 attack [57]. However, excess surface CoOx species are also not beneficial to the carbonyl adsorption because of steric effect. As a result, Co-Pt/C-0.6 exhibits the superiority to other supported Pt catalysts, especially undecorated Pt one, based on the reaction rate and the selectivity to COL, due to the appropriate surface modifications of Pt0 species by CoOx species that can break the continuous metal surface into smaller ensembles and improve the electron density of Pt, thus causing unique geometric and electronic effects on the surface of catalyst. We further evaluated the CAL hydrogenation at different reaction temperatures over the Co-Pt/C-0.6 catalyst. It can be noted from Fig. 10 A that the CAL conversion gradually increases from 17 to 99% with increasing reaction temperature from 20 to 80 °C at a H2 pressure of 2.0 MPa after a reaction time of 2 h, and a complete conversion is achieved when the reaction temperature is elevated to 100 °C. Meanwhile, the COL selectivity gradually increases from 67 to 99% with the elevated temperature from 20 to 80 °C, due to the higher activation barrier required for the carbonyl reduction than that for the olefin reduction. However, as the temperature is elevated to 100 °C, the COL selectivity decreases rapidly to 81%. This is because more HCOL is produced by the deep hydrogenation of COL. Moreover, it is obviously noted from Fig. 10B that the increase in the hydrogen pressure from 0.5 MPa to 2.0 MPa results in the boosted CAL conversion and COL selectivity from 31 to 99% and 63–99%, respectively, along with a high CAL yield (>99%) at 2.0 MPa. The solubility of hydrogen can be improved at high hydrogen pressures, and thus hydrogen molecules are easily accessible to substrates and active sites. Obviously, the high hydrogen pressure is preferential to the carbonyl reduction in the present catalytic system. For heterogeneous catalysts, the reusability of catalyst is one of the most key properties for practical applications, we evaluated the reusability of Co-Pt/C-0.6 under the same conditions at low conversion level of about 80% (Fig. 11 ). After each successive reaction, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation, ethanol washing and vacuum drying. The reaction was repeated for five cycles and there is no obvious decrease in both the conversion and the selectivity to COL, as an almost constant yield of product after reaction for 1 h in each subsequent run is gained. ICP-AES results of reaction filtrate reveal the negligible leaching losses of active metal species after five consecutive cycles, while TEM analyses of used Co-Pt/C-0.6 reveal that the microstructure of the catalyst does not change after the reaction. Such excellent structural stability should be connected with the strong interactions of the support with embedded active species in special solid hybrid nanostructure of the catalyst. To evaluate the feasibility and universality of Co-Pt/C-0.6 catalyst, selective hydrogenations of other typical α,β-unsaturated aldehydes were also explored (Table 3 ). In all cases, high selectivities to UAAs can be achieved at high conversion levels, despite different reaction time. Among these tested substrates, especially, furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural from biomass show the highest reactivity with a 99% UAAs selectivity at a complete conversion."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, supported cobalt oxide-decorated Pt-based catalysts were successfully synthesized by a facile composite precursor route. The combination of Pt NPs and CoOx species greatly enhanced catalytic performance for selective CAL hydrogenation to COL, in comparison to the undecorated Pt/C one. A quite high COL yield of 99.0% was achieved over the catalyst at a Co/Pt molar ratio of 0.6 under mild reaction conditions. Results from a series of characterizations and catalytic tests revealed that high catalytic efficiency of Co-Pt/C-0.6 for the selectively reduction of carbonyl group was attributed to the surface synergy between Pt0 and CoOx species. That is, surface geometric and electronic modifications of Pt NPs by CoOx species could give rise to both smaller ensembles of Pt0 NPs and electron-rich Pt0 species, which strengthened the carbonyl adsorption and inhibit the CC hydrogenation. As-formed CoOx-decorated Pt-based catalyst could be reused for several times, indicating good stability of the catalyst. Moreover, the present Pt-based catalyst was feasible for the hydrogenations of other unsaturated carbonyl compounds to produce UAAs. The present study is highly encouraging and paves a new way to synthesize high performing and stable Pt-based nanocatalysts, which would be promising in various heterogeneous catalysis."
