0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier and presents an application potential in the substitution of liquid fuels mainly used in the transport sector [1,2]. Dark fermentative biohydrogen production proceeds under moderate reaction conditions with lower energy input than the chemical catalysis methods at high temperature (400–1000 K) [3]. However, low hydrogen yield and substrate conversion efficiency constrain dark fermentative biohydrogen production to the infancy stage of industrialization. To overcome these barriers, studies, in particular, focusing on optimizing substrate utilization, inoculum enrichment methods and bioreactor operational parameters, such as pH, temperature and H2 partial pressure, have been widely carried out [4]. Microbial community dynamics and diversity based on 16S rRNA or Fe-hydrogenase genes shows that the dominant hydrogen-producing microorganisms in dark fermentative biohydrogen production are affiliated with Clostridium, Enterobacter and Escherichia [5–8]. Clostridium and Ethanoligenens are two representative genera of butyrate-type and ethanol-type fermentation, respectively [9,10]. Clostridium has been widely studied due to its high hydrogen yield and a large range of substrates [11–13]. However, it is worth noting that a great number of hydrogen-producing microbes, such as Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium saccarobutylicum, Orenia metallireducens, and Desulfotomaculum reducens, are fermentative dissimilatory iron-reducing microorganisms (FDIRMs) [14–17]. FDIRMs can couple organic carbon oxidation to dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction with little energy conservation [18]. It was found that only a minor portion of reducing equivalents (less than 5%) in the fermentative substrate was used for Fe(III) reduction, while most electron equivalents remain in fermentative products, such as hydrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols [19]. Nevertheless, little attention is focused on the relationship between iron (hydroxy) oxide reduction and hydrogen production in a fermentative system. To date, the effect of Fe(III) reduction on hydrogen production based on the present literature is controversial. Fe(III) reduction either competed for electrons originally used for hydrogen production [20] or directly consumed hydrogen [21], resulting in a decrease in hydrogen production. In contrast, Fe(III) reduction made dark fermentation thermodynamically favorable and further promoted fermentation accompanied by increased hydrogen production [18,22]. Dong et al. found that hematite reduction could buffer acid generation and enhance glucose uptake by a fermentative iron-reducing bacterium, Orenia metallireducens strain Z6. However, hematite reduction consumes hydrogen and protons, which resulted in a decrease in hydrogen accumulation [21]. This finding disagreed with some other studies showing that hematite significantly enhanced hydrogen production [17,23,24]. Iron-bearing nanominerals (such as hematite and magnetite) have been widely used to enhance fermentative hydrogen production [23–25]. The mechanisms of increased hydrogen production are commonly attributed to the unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, such as the quantum effect and the high surface area [26]. Compared with hematite and magnetite, nano-ferrihydrite is amorphous or poorly crystalline but has a larger surface area (100–700 m2/g) and a higher reduction potential (+0.1 to −0.1 V) [27]. However, the effect of Fe(III) reduction in nano-ferrihydrite on hydrogen production is rarely studied. Furthermore, nano-ferrihydrite with weak crystallinity has more bacterial accessibility than other iron-bearing minerals [19]. In addition, the enhancement effect of nano-ferrihydrite on the pure hydrogen-producing C. pasteurianum was identified in our previous exploration [22]. Therefore, nano-ferrihydrite was selected in this study to explore the effect of fermentative Fe(III) reduction on hydrogen production of the mixed consortia. Based on the fact that nano-ferrihydrite is attractive for dissimilarly iron reducers and a large number of FDIRMs are capable of producing hydrogen, we hypothesized that nano-ferrihydrite can be used to induce hydrogen-producing consortia formation to elevate hydrogen yield and substrate conversion efficiency. However, no further study has attempted to achieve oriented recruitment of hydrogen producers for stimulating hydrogen production and strengthening energy conversion efficiency by applying this effective, green and low-cost material [19,22,26]. Methanogens and non-spore microorganisms can be efficiently killed by heat shock (95 °C, 15 min), and nano-ferrihydrite attracts FIRMs [18,28]. Therefore, throughout the experiments carried out in the present work, heat treatment amended with nano-ferrihydrite and fermenting substrate supplementation procedures were conducted to enrich FIRMs with the ability to generate hydrogen. The underlying benefits of the Fe(III) reduction of nano-ferrihydrite on recruiting hydrogen-producing bacteria together with hydrogen production enhancement and energy conversion efficiency were concluded based on parallel evidence of metabolic distribution, microbial community structure, dynamic simulation, and metabolic determination. This study provides new insight into obtaining hydrogen-producing consortia and/or pure cultures from anaerobic sludge to enhance hydrogen production and energy conversion efficiency."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Treatment and cultivation of anaerobic sludge,"2.1 Treatment and cultivation of anaerobic sludge Waste anaerobic sludge (WAS) was withdrawn from a full-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating beer production wastewater in Beijing, China. The WAS was stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C. A modified nutrient basic (NB) medium was used for the first-stage cultivation [18]. The recipes of the medium were as follows: CaCl2·H2O, 0.04 g/L; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g/L; NaHCO3, 1.8 g/L; Na2CO3·H2O, 0.5 g/L; vitamin solution, 10 mL; trace mineral solution, 10 mL. WAS, 50 g, was added into approximately 500 mL of vigorously mixed NB medium. The mixture was then dispensed into 100 mL serum vials with a 40 mL working capacity. The vials were sealed with rubber plugs and aluminum caps. Oxygen was excluded by vacuuming and flushing high purity N2 with three cycles [29]. Heat treatment (95 °C, 15 min) was applied to exclude methanogens and non-spore microorganisms [28]. Two groups were prepared: S0, which contained only sludge slurry, and SF0, which included sludge slurry together with 100 mg/L nano-ferrihydrite. Each group was quadruplicated. Nano-ferrihydrite was synthesized by neutralizing a FeCl3 solution to pH 7 with NaOH solution [18]. The characteristic XRD (XRD-6100, JPN) peaks of nano-ferrihydrite were located at 35° and 62° 2θ. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM-1400, JPN) showed that the length and width of the nano-ferrihydrite were 20–30 and 2–3 nm, respectively [22]. Last, the batch groups were cultivated for approximately 30 days without shaking at 37 °C."
3,Batch assay procedures,"2.2 Batch assay procedures To enrich hydrogen producers after the incubation process, a mineral salt glucose (MSG) enrichment medium was used in the second stage of cultivation with glucose (ca. 10 g/L) as the substrate [22]. Fe, FeSO4·7H2O (0.30 g/L) and FeCl2·4H2O (2.0 g/L) were added to the NB and MSG media, respectively. The concentration of Ni was 0.11 g/L (NiSO4·6H2O). This level of Fe and Ni can support basic bacterial growth and metabolism. The MSG medium was deoxidized as described above and autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. Twenty-five milliliter serum vials with a 10 mL working capacity were used in this enrichment stage and for the subsequent pure culture. To test the effect of nano-ferrihydrite on hydrogen production, anaerobic sludge was used as the inoculum, and two batch groups were established: one was incubated with nano-ferrihydrite supplementation and defined as SF1, and the other was incubated under the same conditions but without nano-ferrihydrite addition (S1). Then, the two batch groups were transferred and named SF2 and S2. Subsequently, the S2 and SF2 groups were further transferred and divided into four batch assays as follows: S3, SF3, S3+F (additional nano-ferrihydrite was supplied in the third transfer) and SF3-F (nano-ferrihydrite supplementation was only eased at the third transfer) (Fig. 1 ). To explore the hydrogen-producing capability of the isolated strain YC-1 and the effect of nano-ferrihydrite on YC-1 hydrogen production, DSM525, which is a strain widely used for hydrogen generation, is used as a control for YC-1. DSM525+F and YC-1+F represent the inoculums of DSM525 and YC-1 with nano-ferrihydrite addition, respectively. All batch groups were investigated in triplicate. The initial pH was adjusted to 6.8 ± 0.01 with NaOH and HCl, and the cultures were cultivated at 37 °C in the dark without stirring."
4,Metabolite analyses,"2.3 Metabolite analyses The headspace gas (i.e., H2, CH4, and CO2) of the serum vials were sampled at intervals of approximately 7 h and then analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7820A, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) [30]. The low detection limit for methane and hydrogen is ca. 20 and 10 ppm, respectively. Meanwhile, the liquid samples, i.e., glucose, acetate, butyrate, ethanol, and lactate, were simultaneously analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Agilent 1260, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID) using a Hi-plex H column (7.7 × 300 mm). The temperatures of the detector and column were set at 55 and 60 °C, respectively. The effluent was 5 mM H2SO4, and the flow velocity was set at 0.6 mL/min [22]."
5,Microbial diversity analysis,"2.4 Microbial diversity analysis To reveal the variation of the community structure in the batch groups at different cultivation stages. The dynamic microbial communities of the S1–S3 and SF1–SF3 batch groups were analyzed. DNA was extracted, and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using bacterial primers Bac515F and Bac926R was performed. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data analysis were conducted using an Illumina MiSeq platform from Tiny Gene Bio-Tech (Shanghai, CN) according to a previous study [31]."
6,Metabolic determination,"2.5 Metabolic determination The quantification of Fe(II) in the cultures was monitored by the colorimetric ferrozine-based assay [32]. In brief, the liquid samples were added into the 0.5 M HCl solution, and after centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with 0.1% ferrozine solution. Then, the absorbance of the mixed solution was detected by a spectrophotometer (TU-1810, PERSEE, CN) at 562 nm. The final pH in the fermentative systems was tested using a pH meter (e-201-C, Leici, CN). To reflect the growth conditions, the biomass of different cultures was measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein quantification kit (Solarbio, CN) following the manufacturer’s protocols [33]."
7,Kinetics and conversion efficiency analysis,"2.6 Kinetics and conversion efficiency analysis The patterns of the hydrogen production of the mixed consortia and the isolate were simulated depending upon the modified Gompertz model, which has been widely used to visually describe the generation of gases [34,35]: (1) H = P e x p - e x p R m e P λ - t + 1 where H (mmol) represents the cumulative hydrogen production, P (mmol) is the hydrogen potential, R m (mmol/h) is the maximum hydrogen production rate, and λ (t) is the lag phase period. Origin 9.1 software (Origin Lab Corporation, USA) was used to calculate the kinetic parameters (P, R m, and λ). Carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) was defined as the ratio of the carbon yield of the CO2 production together with soluble metabolic products (SMPs) and biomass to the total carbon supplied by glucose as the modified Eq. (2) [36,37]. The CCEs at 42 h were calculated based on the cumulative yield of CO2, SMPs and biomass. (2) CCE= Carbon yield of CO 2 + SMPs + biomass C a r b o n s u p p l i e d a s g l u c o s e The energy conversion efficiency (ECE) or electron recovery efficiency (ERE) was defined as the ratio of the electron equivalents of the hydrogen, SMPs, biomass, and Fe(III) reduction to the total electron equivalents of the supplied substrate glucose as the modified Eq. (3) [36,37]. The ECEs at 42 h were calculated based on the cumulative yield of H2, SMPs, biomass, and Fe(II). (3) ECE = E l e c t r o n e q u i v a l e n t s of H 2 + SMPs + biomass + iron reduction Electron equivalents of glucose The following conversion factors were used to calculate the ECEs [38]: 1 mol glucose = 24 e− eq; 1 mol biomass, as C5H7O2N = 20 e− eq; 1 mol acetate = 8 e− eq; 1 mol butyrate = 20 e− eq; 1 mol lactate = 12 e− eq; 1 mol ethanol = 12 e− eq; 1 mol H2 = 2 e− eq and 1 mol Fe(II) = 1 e− eq. The efficiency of substrate consumption is defined as the total glucose divided by the consumed glucose. Similarly, the efficiency of H2 yield was defined as the actual H2 yield relative to the maximum theoretical value (4 mol H2/mole glucose)."
8,Screening and identification of strains,"2.7 Screening and identification of strains To screen colonies with hydrogen-producing ability, the enriched culture of SF3 was selected as an inoculum. Briefly, the stepwise diluent of SF3 was coated on the surface of the solid MSG medium in the presence of 2% agar. The cultivation conditions were the same as those described above. The colonies were transferred into liquid MSG medium. Colony PCR was carried out with the bacterial suspension as the DNA template. The reaction system included 2 μL of buffer; 2 μL of dNTPs (2.5 mol/L); 0.5 μL of Taq DNA polymerase; 0.5 μL of Ba907R (20 μmol/L, 5′-AGAGTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′); 0.5 μL of Ba27F (20 μmol/L, 5′-CCGTCAATTCCTTTRAGTTC-3′); 2 μL of sample solution; and 2.5 μL of deionized water. The PCR products were sequenced by Tiny Gene Bio-Tech (Shanghai, CN). The acquired sequence was blasted on the NCBI website. Subsequently, the sequencing result of the colony was uploaded to the NCBI website (No. MK898942). The physiological features of the samples were analyzed, especially focusing on hydrogen production and Fe(III) reduction. All anoxic procedures were completed in an anaerobic glove box (Coy Manufacturing, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) [39]."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate cultures. All statistical analyses were performed with Origin 9.1 (Origin Lab Corporation, USA) software. One-way ANOVA was used to identify the significant differences, and a P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Nano-ferrihydrite activated hydrogen production,"3.1 Nano-ferrihydrite activated hydrogen production Trace amounts of hydrogen, 1 and 1.5 μmol, and no methane in the S0 and SF0 groups were detected after cultivation for 30 days (Fig. S1). These results illustrate that heat treatment efficiently suppressed methanogenesis [28,40]. The reasons for the low H2 amounts are likely attributed to the growing hydrogen producers being killed while a few spores were formed by hydrogen producers. Methanogenesis and hydrogen-producing activity were both inhibited in this stage. With an appropriate supply of glucose, hydrogen was undetectable in the S3 batch group (Fig. 1a). In contrast, in the SF3 group, hydrogen largely accumulated over time, and the maximum production peaked at 0.95 mmol. In particular, compared to the S3 group, the S3+F group started to generate hydrogen in the presence of nano-ferrihydrite. These results suggest that nano-ferrihydrite can efficiently trigger hydrogen production. CO2 production was proportional to hydrogen production (Fig. 1b). Very recently, a study from our team showed that hydrogen production by C. pasteurianum was distinctly enhanced with the addition of nano-ferrihydrite [22]. In comparison with the SF3-F group, the SF3 group showed increased hydrogen production (0.85 vs 0.95 mmol), hydrogen yield (2.32 vs 2.55 mol H2/mol glucose), hydrogen content (70.6 vs 72.5%) and maximum hydrogen rate (0.048 vs 0.059 mmol/h) (Fig. 1a and Table 1 ). The modified Gompertz model is widely used to describe the progression of a batch dark fermentative hydrogen production process [41,42]. This model can dynamically characterize hydrogen production, substrate consumption and soluble metabolite accumulation. Additionally, the modified model was also used to depict the kinetic changes in biogas [34]. Here, the P values (0.868 vs 0.981 mmol) and R m (0.048 vs 0.061 mmol/h) verified the positive effects of nano-ferrihydrite addition (Table 2 ). That is, nano-ferrihydrite increased the maximum hydrogen yield and reduced the lag phase. These data-based Gompertz models emphasized the stronger hydrogen production performance in the presence of nano-ferrihydrite. The enhancement effect of iron-bearing materials, such as ferrous iron, zero-valent iron, hematite, and magnetite, on the hydrogen production of pure culture or mixed consortia has been extensively reported [23–25,43]. Recent reviews summarized the maximum biohydrogen yield, which ranged from 1.53 to 2.33 mol H2/mol glucose [25,43,44]. C. acetobutylicum presented the maximum hydrogen production of 2.33 mol H2/mol glucose with hematite addition [44]. The maximum hydrogen yield, 2.55 mol H2/mol glucose, of the SF3 batch group in this study was higher than that of all these reports. These results demonstrate that nano-ferrihydrite may be a better stimulating factor than other iron-bearing oxides for hydrogen production."
12,Nano-ferrihydrite influenced metabolic pathways and the microbial community,"3.2 Nano-ferrihydrite influenced metabolic pathways and the microbial community The experimental results clearly reveal the metabolite distribution, butyrate was the highest among the products, followed by acetate, lactate, and ethanol, suggesting that diverse fermentation types occurred (Fig. 2 ). Lactic acid and ethanolic fermentation were the primary metabolic pathways when nano-ferrihydrite was not added. Interestingly, in the presence of nano-ferrihydrite, butyric acid and acetic acid fermentation were the dominant metabolic pathways. Given that butyric acid and acetic acid fermentation (Eqs. (4) and (5)) are accompanied by hydrogen production, while no hydrogen production occurs in the processes of lactic acid and ethanolic fermentation (Eqs. (6) and (7)), the metabolic product results were coordinated with the scenario of hydrogen production; specifically, hydrogen production was proportional to acetate and butyrate accumulation but was negatively correlated with lactate and ethanol amounts. These results are in agreement with the principle that a higher ratio of butyrate/acetate is associated with higher hydrogen production [45]. Based on the findings of this study, changing the fermentation pathways by the addition of nano-ferrihydrite is of great importance for biohydrogen production. (4) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2C2H4O2 + 2CO2 + 4H2 (5) C6H12O6 → C4H8O2 + 2CO2 + 2H2 (6) C6H12O6 → 2CH3CH2OH + 2CO2 (7) C6H12O6 → 2CH3CH2OCOOH Whether nano-ferrihydrite supplementation acts as a watershed diverting the completely opposite metabolite profiles is unclear. To explore the potential mechanism with respect to the vast difference in hydrogen production and metabolic distribution, the dynamic variation in the microbial communities amended with nano-ferrihydrite (SF1–SF3) or not (S1–S3) was analyzed. Firmicutes was clearly dominant irrespective of nano-ferrihydrite supplementation (Fig. 3 a), which was consistent with the fact that most members of Firmicutes can produce endospores to resist heat and other extreme conditions [46]. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in S3 and SF3 reached 99.7 and 97.8%, respectively, after two-generations of cultivation. It was reported that Firmicutes was one of the dominant phyla in seed sludge [47], but the relative abundance observed in that study was lower than that observed in this study. Regarding microbial communities at the genus level, Bacillus was the dominant genus in S1 to S3, and the abundance increased as the enrichment procedures proceeded (Fig. 3b). Bacillus accounted for 81.4% of the microbial community in the S3 batch group at the end of the experiment. Considering that members of Bacillus can produce lactate or ethanol [48,49], these results agreed with the metabolite distribution in S3 and S3+F (Fig. 2 c and d). Furthermore, it should be noted that Clostridium was the dominant genus in the SF3 batch assay. The relative abundance of Clostridium in SF1 was as low as 1.0% and increased to 36.9% in SF2 and last, peaked at 77.3% in the SF3 batch group. These results demonstrate that Clostridium can gradually outcompete Bacillus with the assistance of nano-ferrihydrite. Namely, Clostridium in the mixed consortium exclusively benefited from nano-ferrihydrite supplementation. As we know, Clostridium pp. widely occurs in many anaerobic digestion reactors [47,50,51]. However, this phenomenon has not been mentioned before. Nano-ferrihydrite in this work showed potential applications in obtaining hydrogen-producing microorganisms from diverse artificial or natural environments."
13,Nano-ferrihydrite promoted cell growth and buffered acidification,"3.3 Nano-ferrihydrite promoted cell growth and buffered acidification Glucose was largely consumed in the SF3-F (90.4%) and SF3 (99.9%) batch experiments (Fig. 4 a). With the addition of nano-ferrihydrite, the degree of glucose consumption was significantly increased. In contrast, only 35.9% of glucose was consumed in the S3 group. Of course, glucose consumption could be stimulated again to 58.8% with nano-ferrihydrite supplementation (S3+F). These results show that nano-ferrihydrite can efficiently promote substrate consumption and that the amount of glucose consumption was proportional to hydrogen production. Very recently, we found that the phosphotransferase system (PTS), which is responsible for glucose phosphorylation and transmembrane transport [52], was significantly activated by nano-ferrihydrite addition in a pure culture of C. pasteurianum [22]. The same scenario may have occurred in this study. In accordance with this result, supplementation with Fe(OH)3 could enhance the decomposition of organic substrates [17,53]. The biomass results, which can be used as an indicator of cell growth state, agreed with the trends of glucose consumption and hydrogen production (Fig. 4b). These results demonstrate that nano-ferrihydrite promoted cell growth by consuming additional glucose. As a recent report, a large cell biomass and a high substrate conversion efficiency were the primary fundamental factors in obtaining high hydrogen production [2]. In view of the merits of nano-ferrihydrite [54], such as being easy to acquire and synthesize, low cost, and eco-friendly, obtaining high hydrogen production by augmenting the cell mass and substrate consumption with the application of nano-ferrihydrite is a wise strategy. Iron is one of the most important macronutrients for hydrogen-producing microorganisms as the active metal center of hydrogenase enzyme [55]. Fe(II) was undetectable in the S3 batch experiment, and only a small amount of Fe(II) accumulated in the SF3-F batch group (Fig. 4c), whereas a large amount of Fe(II) was detected in the batch assays with nano-ferrihydrite supplementation (SF3) over time. Furthermore, in comparison with the S3+F batch group, SF3 presented an increased Fe(III) reduction rate. These results indicate that nano-ferrihydrite was ready to be reduced by Bacillus or Clostridium. Many members of Bacillus and Clostridium are capable of reducing the Fe(III) bearings in iron-bearing (hydroxy) oxides [15,56]. In this study, nano-ferrihydrite may act as an Fe(II)-release fertilizer to supply enough iron for hydrogenase and ferredoxin synthesis. Evidence in the literature shows that iron-bearing (hydroxy) oxide could significantly increase the activity of hydrogenase enzymes [22,57]. However, Fe(II) accumulation was not proportional to hydrogen production, indicating that Fe(II) was not the limiting factor for hydrogen production when the Fe(II) concentration exceeded ca. 3.0 mmol/L in this study. The effect of pH on dark fermentative biohydrogen has been investigated for a long time [28,58,59]. Herein, the initial and final pH in the batch assays were also tested. The final pH values in all the batch groups decreased to approximately 3.9, except for in S3, with a value of approximately 4.6. The decreased pH value was attributed to the accumulation of acetate, butyrate, lactate and dissolved CO2. Interestingly, the amount of acetate and butyrate in SF3-F and SF3 was much higher than that in S3+F, whereas the pH values of these treatments showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). It is reasonable that nano-ferrihydrite reduction buffered acidification. Hematite reduction by a fermentative iron-reducing bacterium played a similar role [21]. Recently, our study also demonstrated that nano-ferrihydrite reduction can buffer acidification by a pure culture of C. pasteurianum [22]."
14,Nano-ferrihydrite elevated carbon and energy conversion efficiency,"3.4 Nano-ferrihydrite elevated carbon and energy conversion efficiency The CCEs were calculated based on the contributions of gaseous CO2 production, accumulative SMPs, such as acetate, butyrate, lactate and ethanol, and biomass (Figs. 1b, 2, and 4b). SF3 presented the highest CCE with a value of approximately 82.4%, followed by SF3-F (79.0%), S3+F (59.4%) and S3 (22.6%) (Fig. 5 a). These results indicate that nano-ferrihydrite supplementation could accelerate substrate decomposition and further promote CCE. The maximum CCE of SF3 was elevated approximately 4 times compared to that of S3. It was found that the CCE of dark hydrogen fermentation could peak at 63.3% by optimizing the ratio of food waste to sewage sludge [36]. In this study, the CCE reached 82.4% with the assistance of nano-ferrihydrite. In different treatments, the dominant contributors varied. Butyrate accounted for 43.9% of the CCE in the SF3 batch group, whereas lactate contributed to 15% in the S3 assay. These results agree with the above findings that nano-ferrihydrite supported the butyric acid fermentation route accompanied by large amounts of butyrate production (Fig. 2b). In line with the CCE results, the rank of ECEs from high to low was SF3 (100.3%), SF3-F (92.9%), S3+F (67.6%) and S3 (21.5%) (Fig. 5b). Most electrons of SF3 were retained in the by-product butyrate (54.9%), and the electrons used for hydrogen production reached 18.9%. In contrast, lactate (15%) was the dominant electron sink of S3 accompanied by no electron consumption through hydrogen production. In accordance with a previous report pointing out that less than 5% of electrons can be used to reduce Fe(III) during the fermentative process [19], only approximately 2.1% of electrons were used in Fe(III) reduction in the S3+F and SF3 batch groups. With fruitful harvest, Fe(III) reduction distinctly stimulated the ECEs of S3+F/SF3 but not S3. In summary, nano-ferrihydrite is an efficient inducer that can increase ECE."
15,A high H2 producer isolated from the rare background abundance in the in situ environment,"3.5 A high H2 producer isolated from the rare background abundance in the in situ environment A line of evidence has shown that heat, acid and alkaline treatments are useful means to enrich hydrogen-producing microbes [28,40]. However, these methods can only obtain hydrogen-producing mixed consortia. It is commonly difficult to further screen pure strains because of the varied and unstable relative abundance of hydrogen-producing microorganisms (25–70%) [47,60,61]. Herein, a modified strategy of heat treatment amended with nano-ferrihydrite supplementation was confirmed to be a simple and efficient method by successfully isolating a high H2-producing strain, C. pasteurianum YC-1. The above results show no hydrogen, and very few hydrogen producers were detected in the S3 batch group in the absence of nano-ferrihydrite (Figs. 1b and 3b). In fact, we failed to identify pure hydrogen producers in this sample. In contrast, vigorous hydrogen-producing activity and abundant hydrogen producers were found in the SF3 batch group in the presence of nano-ferrihydrite. The dominant hydrogen producers belonged to Clostridium, and the relative abundance reached 77.3%. Subsequently, a pure strain was readily isolated from the SF3 batch group. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was most closely related to C. pasteurianum DSM525 with 99.8% similarity and then named YC-1 (Fig. 6 a). Furthermore, the characteristics of YC-1, especially its hydrogen production ability, were compared to those of the typical hydrogen-producing bacterium C. pasteurianum DSM525. Although both strains were comparable in growth ability and dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction (Fig. S2 a and b), YC-1 was superior in terms of hydrogen production rate (0.045 vs 0.040 mmol/h) and hydrogen production (0.85 vs 0.71 mol) (Fig. 6b and Table 1). Furthermore, the profile of CO2 was correlated with hydrogen production (Fig. 6c). In addition, glucose consumption was monitored. As Fig. 7 a shows, in comparison to DSM525, YC-1 presented a higher consumption rate, and this effect was further enhanced in the presence of nano-ferrihydrite. Obviously, YC-1 presented a higher substrate decomposition ability, and nano-ferrihydrite supplementation was favorable for this process. The end products of YC-1 were the same as those of DSM525, including hydrogen, CO2, acetate and butyrate (Figs. 6 and 7). YC-1 also showed higher acetate and butyrate production than DSM525, and nano-ferrihydrite significantly accelerated the accumulation of these products. Again, the results of the final pH values in the four batch groups demonstrated that nano-ferrihydrite could buffer acidification (Fig. S2c)."
16,Conclusions,"The application of nano-ferrihydrite on anaerobic sludge to stimulate hydrogen production was conducted. Nano-ferrihydrite efficiently activated and enhanced hydrogen generation by shaping the microbial community to modify the fermentation mode, accompanied by stabilizing the fermentative system. No hydrogen generation occurred in the blank control, whereas the maximum hydrogen yield reached 2.55 mol H2/mol glucose with nano-ferrihydrite supplementation. Clostridium and Bacillus, with abundances of 77.3% and 81.4%, were the dominant genera in the groups with and without nano-ferrihydrite, respectively. Nano-ferrihydrite reduction buffered acidification and acted as a source of Fe(II) for hydrogenase syntheses. The carbon and energy conversion efficiencies were maximally elevated by 265% and 367%, respectively. Moreover, the participation of nano-ferrihydrite made screening hydrogen-producing bacteria easy, and a robust H2 producer, C. pasteurianum YC-1, was successfully isolated from a rare background abundance community. This work has important implications not only for understanding the mechanisms of mineral-hydrogen producer interactions but also for optimizing engineered biohydrogen production processes."
