0,Introduction,"Excessive alcohol consumption results in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). ALD evolves from alcoholic fatty liver to alcoholic steatohepatitis and the last stage is alcoholic cirrhosis, which is irreversible [1]. The generation of toxic metabolites and byproducts by ethanol oxidation, for instance acetaldehyde and lipid peroxidation products contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury. It has been known that prolonged alcohol consumption induces hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), which not only accelerates oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde but also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2]. Previous study reported that knockdown of CYP2E1 protected mice from chronic alcohol consumption-induced liver injury via reduction of ROS [3,4]. Therefore, removal of hepatic ROS could be an effective strategy in preventing the development of ALD. Mitochondrion is a vital organelle that maintains biological functions of a cell by providing energy. Defective mitochondria result in shortage in ATP, leakage of ROS, accumulation of fat, and activation of intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway [5–7]. It has been shown that approximately 1–2% of the oxygen consumed in the mitochondria is converted to ROS [7]. Within the mitochondrial matrix, SOD2 catalyzes the conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide that can be readily oxidized by glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) [8]. Ethanol and oxidative stress exacerbate ROS formation in mitochondria [6]. The uncontrolled level of ROS in the mitochondria could damage the mitochondrial membrane and lead to increased diffusion of hydrogen peroxide to cytoplasm. Dysfunctional mitochondria also contributes to defective lipid metabolism manifested by decreased carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) activity and β-oxidation [8]. In addition, dysfunctional mitochondria after alcohol exposure release cytochrome C to cytosol, leading to activation of apoptosis [9]. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether decreases of ROS levels could rescue the function of mitochondria after alcohol exposure. In addition to CYP2E1 and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), NADPH oxidase (NOX) is another well-known source of ROS generation [10,11]. NOX generates superoxide from oxygen using NAD(P)H as an electron donor. It is known that NOX family consists of seven members, NOX1–5 and DUOX1–211. NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 have been found in the liver [12]. Different from NOX2 that is expressed in phagocytes such as Kupffer cell [13], NOX1 and NOX4 are expressed in nonphagocytes [12]. In comparison with NOX1, NOX4 is able to generate ROS constitutively due to not requiring recruitment of structural subunits to form active enzyme [14]. It has been shown that NOX1 promotes hepatic stellate cell proliferation and aggravates fibrosis [15–17]. In addition, NOX4 has been found to play a critical role in lung, kidney and liver fibrosis [18–20]. Recently, a NOX4/NOX1 dual inhibitor (GKT137831) has been shown a promising effect in treating pulmonary fibrosis and bile duct ligation-induced hepatic fibrosis [21]. Previous studies have shown that NOX4 predominantly exists in the mitochondria in cardiac myocytes and kidney cortex [19,22] Our previous reports demonstrated that chronic alcohol exposure impairs hepatic mitochondrial function [23,24]; however, it is unclear if NOX4 locates in hepatic mitochondria and if NOX4 contributes to alcohol-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, in the present study, we first determined the subcellular distribution of NOX4 in the liver and effect of alcohol exposure on NOX4 expression, and then tested the protective effects of NOX4 inhibitor, GKT137831, on alcohol-induced ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We also performed cell culture study to define the link between NOX4 expression and mitochondrial ROS levels and function."

The animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the North Carolina Research Campus. Eight-week-old male rats were pair-fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli alcohol (Dyets, Bethlehem) or isocaloric maltose dextrin control liquid diet (Dyets) for 5months (n=6 for each group) with a stepwised feeding procedure, as described previously [24]. Briefly, on the day of feeding, the ethanol content (w/v%) in the diet was 5.0 (36% of total calories) and gradually increased to 6.3 (44% of total calories). At the end of 5-month feeding, rats were anesthetized with inhalational isoflurane. Male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were treated according to the experimental procedures approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were pair-fed a stepwise and modified Lieber-DeCarli ethanol or control liquid diet for four weeks (n=6) with or without 30mg/kg/d GKT137831 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) supplements in food for the last two weeks. On the day of feeding, ethanol content (%, w/v) in the diet was 3.2 (22.4% of total calories) and gradually increased to 4.2 (29.4% of total calories). The mice were gavage with ethanol (3g/kg) or isocaloric dextrin (5.2g/kg) once a week. At the end of 4-week of feeding, mice were anesthetized with inhalational isoflurane. Male C57BL/6J mice were treated with recombinant TNF-alpha (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) via intravenous injection at 20μg/kg body weight 30min after intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (D-gal) (800mg/kg body weight) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

19,Results,
20,The effect of alcohol exposure on the expression and subcellular distribution of NOX4 in the liver,"3.1 The effect of alcohol exposure on the expression and subcellular distribution of NOX4 in the liver To determine the role of NOX4 in the pathogenesis of ALD, the protein levels of NOX4 were measured. NOX4 proteins were significantly increased in the liver of rats or mice after alcohol feeding (Fig. 1A–B). The protein levels of NOX4 were further measured in the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions. As shown in Fig. 1C, NOX4 proteins were higher in the mitochondrial fraction in comparison with microsomal fraction, and alcohol feeding significantly increased the protein levels of NOX4 in the mitochondria of the rat liver (Fig. 1C). The distribution of NOX4 was then determined in the liver of mice. The result showed that the mitochondria have a higher levels of NOX4 compared to that of the microsome and alcohol feeding significantly increased the expression of NOX4 in the mitochondria of mouse liver (Fig. 1D)."
21,GKT137831 ameliorates chronic alcohol-induced liver injury,"3.2 GKT137831 ameliorates chronic alcohol-induced liver injury The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed that four weeks of alcohol feeding caused formation of lipid droplets (arrowheads) and necrosis (arrows) in the hepatocytes, which was partially reversed by GKT137831 treatment for the last two weeks (Fig. 2A). In addition, as shown in Fig. 2B, GKT137831 treatment attenuated alcohol feeding-induced elevation of serum ALT and AST (Fig. 2B and C)."
22,GKT137831 decreases alcohol-induced elevation of serum hydrogen peroxide but does not affect alcohol-induced alteration of alcohol metabolism enzymes and ROS scavenger enzymes,"3.3 GKT137831 decreases alcohol-induced elevation of serum hydrogen peroxide but does not affect alcohol-induced alteration of alcohol metabolism enzymes and ROS scavenger enzymes Four weeks of alcohol feeding remarkably increased the expression of NOX4 in the liver and mitochondrial fraction, and GKT137831 treatment for the last two weeks did not affect the protein levels of NOX4 after alcohol exposure (Fig. 3A and B). Alcohol feeding increased the hepatic protein levels of CYP2E1 but did not affect alcohol metabolism enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), catalase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) as shown in Fig. 3C. GKT137831 treatment did not have additional effect on the alcohol metabolism enzymes after alcohol exposure. The antioxidant enzymes were then measured. Alcohol feeding increased the expression of GSTM1 but not SOD1, SOD2 or Gpx1 (Fig. 3D). Alcohol feeding along with GKT137831 treatment did not affect the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the liver of mice compared with mice fed with alcohol alone (Fig. 3D). Moreover, the levels of serum H2O2 was measured, as shown in Fig. 3E, GKT137831 treatment reduced alcohol feeding-induced elevation of H2O2 levels in the serum."
23,"GKT137831 reduces alcohol-induced the production of ROS in the mitochondria and protects against reduction of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, mitochondrial DNA, and ATP levels in the liver of mice","3.4 GKT137831 reduces alcohol-induced the production of ROS in the mitochondria and protects against reduction of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, mitochondrial DNA, and ATP levels in the liver of mice As shown in Fig. 4A, alcohol exposure significantly increased the levels of 4HNE and Gpx1 in the mitochondria, which were partially reversed by GKT137831 treatment. The expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins was measured by western blot. Alcohol exposure significantly decreased the levels of complex IV, and GKT137831 treatment partially reversed alcohol-induced reduction of complex IV (Fig. 4B). Additionally, the levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and hepatic ATP levels were determined. As shown in Figs. 4C and D, GKT137831 treatment reduced alcohol-induced reduction of mitochondrial DNA and ameliorated alcohol-induced decrease of ATP in the liver."
24,GKT137831 reverses alcohol-induced lipid accumulation and increases the expression of HNF-4α and β-oxidation enzymes in the liver of mice,"3.5 GKT137831 reverses alcohol-induced lipid accumulation and increases the expression of HNF-4α and β-oxidation enzymes in the liver of mice Oil red O staining shows that alcohol exposure increased fat accumulation in the liver manifested by the increased size of lipid droplets (arrows) (Fig. 5A). GKT137831 treatment reduced the size of lipid droplets in the liver of mice (Fig. 5A). Quantitative measurement of hepatic lipid contents showed that alcohol exposure significantly increased the hepatic triglyceride (P <0.05) and free fatty acid (FFA) (P <0.05) levels, which were reversed by GKT137831 treatment (Fig. 5B and C). To determine the potential mechanism by which GKT137831 reduces lipid accumulation in the liver after alcohol exposure, the protein levels of PPAR-α, HNF-4α, and important β-oxidation enzymes were measured. As shown in Fig. 5D, alcohol feeding significantly decreased the expression of HNF-4α, but not PPAR-α, ACADVL and CPT1. GKT137831 treatment reversed alcohol feeding-induced reduction of HNF-4α. In addition, the expression of ACADVL and CPT1 were significantly increased by GKT137831 treatment in comparison with control-and alcohol-feeding groups, respectively (Fig. 5D). The ratio of NAD+ to NADH was measured as well, and GKT137831 treatment did not reverse alcohol-induced reduction of NAD+ to NADH ratio (Fig. 5E)."
25,GKT137831 ameliorates alcohol-induced mitochondrial apoptotic signaling,"3.6 GKT137831 ameliorates alcohol-induced mitochondrial apoptotic signaling Apoptotic cells were measured by TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, GKT137831 treatment decreased the number of TUNEL positive cells (dark brown color indicated by arrows) in the liver after alcohol exposure. To determine the potential mechanism of GKT137831 in protecting against alcohol feeding induced apoptosis, mitochondrial apoptotic cell death markers were measured. GKT137831 treatment reversed alcohol feeding-induced insertion of Bax into mitochondria and loss of VDAC from mitochondria (Fig. 6B). Moreover, GKT137831 treatment reduced the level of cleaved-caspase 9 and cleaved PARP in the liver after alcohol exposure (Fig. 6C). Hepatic caspase-9 activity was increased by alcohol exposure, which was reversed by GKT137831 treatment (Fig. 6D)."
26,"Knockdown of NOX4 in H4IIEC3 cells reverses ethanol-increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased levels of mitochondrial ROS, promoted lipid accumulation and apoptosis, reduced levels of ATP and NAD+/NADH","3.7 Knockdown of NOX4 in H4IIEC3 cells reverses ethanol-increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased levels of mitochondrial ROS, promoted lipid accumulation and apoptosis, reduced levels of ATP and NAD+/NADH NOX4 was successfully knocked down in H4IIEC3 cells (Fig. 7A, left panel). H4IIEC3 cells were then treated with 200mM ethanol for 48h. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 7A, ethanol treatment significantly increased the levels of NOX4 in H4IIEC3 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA. The ethanol induced up-regulation of NOX4 was significantly alleviated in H4IIEC3 cells transfected with NOX4 shRNA. To determine the effect of NOX4 on the integrity and function of mitochondria, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ROS levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 7B, cells transfected with NOX4 shRNA had higher MMP as indicated by stronger red fluorescence, compared to cells transfected with scrambled shRNA after ethanol treatment. Quantitative analysis shows that ethanol treatment significantly decreased MMP in cells transfected with scrambled shRNA, but not in cells transfected with NOX4 shRNA (Fig. 7E). Moreover, cells were stained with Mitosox to determine the levels of ROS in the mitochondria and cells were counterstained with HOECHST to indicate nuclei. The result shows that cells transfected with NOX4 shRNA had weaker red fluorescence staining after ethanol treatment in comparison with cells transfected with scrambled shRNA (Fig. 7C). Quantitative analysis illustrates that ethanol treatment remarkably increased intensity of positive staining in cells transfected with scrambled shRNA, which was attenuated in cells transfected with NOX4 shRNA (Fig. 7F). TUNEL staining showed that ethanol treatment significantly increased number of apoptotic cells indicated by red fluorescence in H4IIEC3 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA, which was significantly alleviated in H4IIEC3 cells transfected with NOX4 shRNA (Fig. 7D-G). Moreover, ethanol treatment significantly increased levels of triglyceride in H4IIEC3 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA and silence of NOX4 significantly inhibited this ethanol-induced up-regulation of triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 7H). Ethanol treatment also significantly decreased levels of ATP and NAD+/NADH in control H4IIEC3 cells which were attenuated by silence of NOX4 (Fig. 7I-J)."
27,Discussion,"The present study demonstrated that inhibition of NOX4 activity protects against ALD. First, we found that chronic alcohol feeding induced the protein levels of NOX4 in the liver and mitochondria, and mitochondrial fraction had higher levels of NOX4 than microsomal fraction. Then, we used GKT137831, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, to treat alcohol-fed mice, and we observed that GKT137831 ameliorated alcohol-induced liver injury along with decreased ROS levels in mitochondria. Improved mitochondrial functions are coupled with increased expression of β-oxidation enzymes and decreased apoptotic cells after alcohol exposure. Mechanistic study shows that ethanol challenging-induced loss of MMP, decrease of ATP, elevation of mitochondrial ROS levels, increase of apoptosis, enhance of TG accumulation, and decrease of NAD+/NADH ratio were restored in H4IIEC3 cells transfected with NOX4 shRNA. This study revealed a novel mechanism of NOX4 in the pathogenesis of ALD. NOXs overexpression is associated with increased oxidative stress and pathogenesis of diseases. It has been shown that NOXs are the major enzymes responsible for superoxide generation through transferring electrons from NADPH or NADH to molecular oxygen [22]. Activation of NOXs was observed in heart failure [25], lung fibrosis [20], diabetic kidney disease [26], and liver disease [17,27]. Previous study demonstrated that NOX-deficient (p47phox−/−) mice had a decrease of oxidative stress and were resistant to alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and hepatitis [13]. The p47phox is necessary for NOX1 and NOX2 to form active complexes, therefore decreased NOXs activity may have protective effect on the development of ALD. Different from other NOXs, NOX4 is constitutively active. Active NOX4 directly produces H2O2. During chronic liver injury, the balance between the amount of H2O2 and antioxidant enzymes is perturbed. Human study showed that NOX4 was significantly upregulated at mRNA levels in the liver of alcoholic hepatitis patients compared to patients with normal liver [28]. In the present study, we found that alcohol exposure significantly increased protein of NOX4 in the liver and hepatic mitochondria. NOX4 inhibitor ameliorated alcohol-induced elevation of H2O2. Knockdown of NOX4 in H4IIEC3 cells attenuated loss of MMP and mitochondrial oxidative stress after ethanol challenge. Increased hepatic inflammation has been reported in chronic alcohol fed mice and rats. The p47phox knockout mice, which lack a critical subunit of NADPH oxidase protected against alcohol-induced hepatitis by inactivating NF-kappa B and reducing production of cytotoxic TNF-alpha [13]. In the present study, immunohistochemical staining showed that NOX4 inhibitor attenuated alcohol-induced inflammatory cell infiltration. Thus, the current study demonstrated that NOX4 levels were upregulated in the liver by alcohol exposure, and increased NOX4 levels are associated with the development of ALD. GKT137831 is a drug used to determine the role of NOX-mediated tissue injury and fibrosis. Previous studies showed that GKT137831 treatment effectively decreased hydrogen peroxide levels, attenuated apoptosis, and reversed fibrosis in the liver [21,29] and heart [30]. Consistent with previous studies, we found that GKT137831 treatment decreased ROS level in the mitochondria after alcohol exposure. In addition, mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase-1 levels were significantly decreased in mice fed GKT137831along with alcohol compared with mice fed alcohol alone. This result suggests that decrease of mitochondrial ROS by GKT137831 is achieved by reducing the production instead of increasing clearance. Previous studies demonstrated that mtDNA and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV are sensitive to oxidative stress [23,31–34]. In addition, it is known that increased mitochondrial oxidative stress activates intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway via releasing cytochrome C and pro-apoptotic proteins [35]. In the current study, we found that alcohol-induced reduction of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, mtDNA, and ATP was reversed by inhibition of NOX4 activity. Intrinsic apoptosis induced by chronic alcohol feeding was also rescued by inhibition of NOX4 activity. Thus, the present study demonstrated that alcohol-induced mitochondria oxidative stress is attenuated by inhibition of NOX4 activity, which results in improved mitochondria functions and decreased apoptosis. In addition, it will be of interest to feed alcohol to mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of NOX4. Previous study showed that hepatocyte-specific deletion of NOX4 attenuated oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and liver fibrosis in mice with dietary induced steatohepatitis [36]. Thus, mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of NOX4 may protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via decrease of oxidative stress and apoptosis. PPARα and HNF-4α are both transcription factors, and play critical roles in regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. HNF-4α is a master regulator of hepatic gene expression, and liver-specific knockout of HNF-4α led to severe steatosis in mice [37]. In addition, activation of HNF-4α by zinc attenuated alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis along with upregulated genes involves in β-oxidation (Cpt-1 and Acadl) [38]. In the present study, we found an increase of HNF-4α, ACVDAL, and CPT1but not PPARα at proteins levels by GKT137831 treatment after alcohol exposure. These data suggests that upregulation of HNF-4α and important β-oxidation enzymes may account for the mechanism, by which inhibition of NOX4 activity ameliorates alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis. Moreover, we measured the ratio of NAD+/NADH after alcohol exposure with or without GKT137831 treatment for the last two weeks. It is well known that decrease of NAD+/NADH ratio favors lipid accumulation [39]. In the current study, GKT137831 did not restore the ratio of NAD+/NADH. It is possibly due to that inhibition of NOX4 did not affect the expression of alcohol oxidation enzymes, in particular ALDH2, or accelerate the clearance of acetaldehyde and the conversion of NAD+ to NADH. Thus, the data suggest that attenuated lipid accumulation in the liver by inhibition of NOX4 activity is not resulted from increased ratio of NAD+ to NADH but enhanced levels of HNF-4α and β-oxidation. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that NOX4 predominantly locates in the mitochondria of the liver and is upregulated by alcohol exposure, and pharmacological inhibition of NOX4 reversed alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and apoptosis. Alcohol exposure increased oxidative stress in mitochondria, which impaired levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, mtDNA, and ATP. Attenuation of alcohol-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress is likely the most important mechanism underlying the protective action of NOX4 inhibitor on mitochondrial function. These results suggest that mitochondrial NOX4 is a promising therapeutic target for treating ALD."
