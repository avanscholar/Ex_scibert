0,Introduction,"There is current interest to introduce renewable sources in the energy scenario and the use of several new energy carriers derived from biomass has been proposed. Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier with the potential for highly efficient generation of electricity via fuel cell systems. However, since its direct distribution and storage remain the main drawbacks for domestic or remote area application, on-site generation from various hydrogen-containing feedstocks deserves to be contemplated. In this context, substrates derived from biomass have attracted great interest due to their renewable character and to the development of new processes of biomass transformation and use (Fatsikostas and Verykios, 2004; James et al., 2011; Nahar and DuPont, 2012; Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008; Wang et al., 2011). Although current main routes for hydrogen production are based on catalytic reforming processes using hydrocarbons, the steam reforming of methanol and dimethylether has been also demonstrated industrially feasible (Rostrup-Nielsen and Christiansen, 2011). The use of other alcohols in reforming processes is of interest because large amounts of C2–C4 alcohols such as bio-ethanol, glycerol and bio-butanol are available. However, during the steam reforming of ethanol or other higher alcohols, severe carbon deposits and diverse by-products are usually formed; the development of new catalysts for hydrogen production from these renewable biomass-derived resources is of great interest. The oxidative steam reforming of alcohols combines partial oxidation (exothermic reaction) and steam reforming (endothermic reaction) and requires less external energy supply than conventional steam reforming, whilst keeping a relatively high hydrogen yield (Cai et al., 2007; Kugai et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2010): (1) C x H y O z + k H 2 O + ( x - 0.5 k - 0.5 z ) O 2 → x CO 2 + ( k + 0.5 y ) H 2 For the oxidative steam reforming process, the addition of oxygen could help to decrease coke formation, while the thermal sintering of both active components and supports make the issues more challenging (Cavallaro et al., 2003a; Frusteri et al., 2006; Pojanavaraphan et al., 2012). Although most studies have focused on the oxidative steam reforming of bio-ethanol, the use of bio-butanol is also a strategic target due to (i) its renewable character as compared to fossil fuels, (ii) its greater hydrogen content than bio-ethanol and (iii) its ease in feedstock transport (Nahar and Madhani, 2010; Wang and Cao, 2010). In this context, a current interest in the study of both new feedstock and new processes for bio-butanol production is noted (Ellis et al., 2012; Swaga et al., 2011; Wang and Blaschek, 2011). We studied recently the steam and oxidative steam reforming of bio-butanol raw mixture, the preliminary distillation product of biomass fermentation liquid (butanol/acetone/ethanol=6/3/1, mass ratio), over cobalt-based catalysts (Cai et al., 2012a,b). We demonstrated that the addition of a small amount of iridium improved the catalytic performance of Co/ZnO catalyst in the oxidative steam reforming of bio-butanol raw mixture, with bimetallic CoIr/ZnO showing higher resistance to coke formation than monometallic Co/ZnO; the addition of a higher amount of Ir (1wt.% Ir) did not improve the catalytic behavior of CoIr/ZnO (Cai et al., 2012b). However, the acid/base and redox properties of the support may determine its direct participation in oxidative reforming processes. The transfer of oxygen from the support to Co has been related to the higher activity shown by Co supported on reducible oxides (Martono and Vohs, 2011). Moreover, the reducibility of cobalt, the particle size of metallic phase and its stability in front of sintering phenomena could be influenced by the support. These factors are of great importance in the behavior of catalysts in oxidative steam reforming processes (Cavallaro et al., 2003b; Chen et al., 2010; Fierro et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2008). This background led us to study the influence of the support in the behavior of bimetallic Co–Ir catalysts, with low loading of Ir on the oxidative steam reforming of bio-butanol raw mixture. CeO2–ZrO2, ZnO and TiO2 were chosen as supports because they had been proposed as appropriate supports of various metallic phases for use as catalysts in reforming processes (Duan and Senkan, 2005; Lima et al., 2008; Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008; Virginie et al., 2008). Moreover, to analyze the deactivation phenomena, catalytic tests were carried out at 500°C using reaction conditions in which the reactant conversion was lower than 100%."
1,Methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation ZnO (41m2 g−1), TiO2 (120m2 g−1) and CeO2–ZrO2 (18wt.% CeO2, 134m2 g−1) purchased from TECNAN were used as supports. Catalysts, containing ca. 6.5wt.% Co and 0.4wt.% Ir, were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using an aqueous solution containing simultaneously Co(NO3)2·6H2O and IrCl3·nH2O. After impregnation, solids were dried at 70°C overnight and then calcined at 450°C for 5h. Catalysts were labeled as CoIr/ZnO, CoIr/TiO2 and CoIr/18CeZrO2; the preparation of CoIr/ZnO has been recently reported (Cai et al., 2012b)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The metal content of catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES Perkin Elmer Optima 3200RL). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by use of a Siemens D-500 X-ray diffractometer with nickel-filtered Cu Kα1 radiation. The XRD profiles were collected between 2θ =20–100°, at a step width of 0.05° counting 3s at each step. The mean crystallite sizes of cobalt were calculated according to the Debye–Scherrer equation. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at −196°C using a Tristar-II Micromeritics apparatus. Before the measurements, samples were outgassed at 150°C for 2h. The surface area was calculated by multipoint BET analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed with a Micromeritics AutoChem II chemisorption analyzer. A H2/Ar flow (12vol.%, 50mL/min) was used for treating the sample from room temperature to 600°C (heating rate 10°Cmin−1). A TCD detector was used for measuring hydrogen consumption. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was measured in the same equipment using the oxygen pulse injection method. Before analysis, the sample (50mg) was reduced with 12vol.% H2/Ar (50mL/min) at 800°C. Then, the sample was cooled to 500°C under an Ar flow (50mL/min). A stream of 10vol.% O2/He (50mL/min) was periodically injected into the reduced sample until saturation and the oxygen consumption was calculated. Raman spectra of used catalysts were recorded using a Jobin–Yvon T64000 spectrometer equipped with an Ar ion laser source (532.08nm) and a CCD detector cooled at −196°C. The laser power was limited to 0.7mW to minimize laser-heating effects."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements Catalytic reforming tests were carried out in a Microactivity-Reference unit (PID Eng & TECH). The catalyst (300mg) was mixed with inactive SiC (Prolabo, 0.5mm) and placed in a tubular fixed-bed reactor (305mm long, 9mm id., 316-L stainless steel); the catalytic bed volume was approximately of 1mL. Catalysts were treated at 450°C with a H2/Ar (10v/v%, 50mL/min) flow for 1.5h. The temperature was measured by a thermocouple in direct contact with the catalytic bed. Two piston pumps were used to introduce the liquid mixture (butanol/acetone/ethanol=6/3/1, mass ratio) and water separately. The liquid mixture was then vaporized and mixed with a controlled flow of dilution gas (Ar) and air. The molar composition of the reactant feed was: raw mixture/water/air/Ar=1/10/7.5/12 under a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV=inlet gas volumetric flow/catalyst bed volume) of 7500h−1. The products were analyzed on-line with a Varian 450-GC equipped with a methanizer and TCD, FID and mass spectrometer detectors. Product distribution is expressed as molar percentage and includes acetone in the outlet. The carbon balance between the outlet gas and the reactant inlet was ⩽3%."
5,Results and discussion,"Table 1 summarizes the BET surface area of calcined catalysts and their cobalt and iridium contents. In all cases, besides the diffraction peaks characteristic of the supports, XRD patterns of calcined catalysts (not shown) only contained peaks attributed to the presence of Co3O4. Other peaks corresponding to the presence of iridium phases were not detected. This may be due to the low iridium loading of the catalysts or to a high dispersion of iridium species. Crystallite sizes of Co3O4 determined with the Scherrer equation were in the range 9–12nm (Table 1). The different values of the surface area of catalysts make it difficult to compare the particle size of Co3O4 as a function of characteristics of the support. However, the crystallite particle size of Co3O4 is slightly greater in CoIr/TiO2 than in CoIr/ZnO despite the lower surface area of the CoIr/ZnO catalyst. This could be related with a weaker interaction between cobalt species and the support in CoIr/TiO2 catalyst with respect CoIr/ZnO; the lower interaction between the supported species and support may lead to a higher sintering of supported particles during the calcination process (Cai et al., 2008). Fig. 1 shows the TPR profiles of the three samples investigated. Although the reduction profile depended on the support, all catalysts showed hydrogen consumption at a temperature lower than 200°C, which was related to the presence of Ir, because supported Co3O4 in absence of noble metal is reduced at higher temperatures (Pereira et al., 2008, 2010). For CoIr/TiO2 and CoIr/18CeZrO2 the amount of hydrogen consumed up to 200°C was much higher than that required for the reduction of IrO2 to Ir. This indicates that the peaks located at a temperature lower than 200°C are probably due to the reduction of IrO2 and to a partial reduction of Co3O4, as has been recently proposed for CoIr/ZnO (Cai et al., 2012b). Once Ir is formed, it could spill over H2, so favoring the reduction of cobalt species in the catalyst. TPR profiles in Fig. 1 show that the temperature at which the total reduction of cobalt is reached also depends on the support. Moreover, the theoretical consumption of H2 for carrying the reduction processes (Co3O4 →CoO→Co) and (IrO2 →Ir) is, in all cases, lower than the experimental hydrogen consumed during the TPR experiment. The effect of Ir addition on Co/TiO2 and Co/18CeZrO2 catalysts was quite similar to that previously observed for Co/ZnO catalyst (Cai et al., 2012b). The excess of hydrogen consumed is in the order of CoIr/18CeZrO2 >CoIr/ZnO>CoIr/TiO2 and is related to the partial reduction of the corresponding support. A similar order for the OSC values: CoIr/18CeZrO2 (798μmolOg−1 cat)>CoIr/ZnO (507μmolOg−1 cat)>CoIr/TiO2 (279μmolOg−1 cat) was observed. The reducible and exchangeable oxygen can play a major role in the overall behavior of the catalysts in the oxidative steam reforming process. Fig. 2 illustrates the behavior of catalysts in the oxidative steam-reforming of bio-butanol-like mixture at 500°C. Under the experimental conditions used, all catalysts showed initial conversion values of raw mixture lower than 100%, which allowed us to study the deactivation of samples. The deactivation of samples was in the 8–14% range after 60h of catalytic test and most deactivation took place in the first 15h of reaction. CoIr/18CeZrO2 and CoIr/ZnO showed similar initial conversion values (95%) which were higher than that of CoIr/TiO2 (74%). After 60h of catalytic reaction, the conversion showed a similar order as the reducibility of catalysts shown above: CoIr/18CeZrO2 >CoIr/ZnO>CoIr/TiO2. In all cases, acetone was the major reactant found in the outlet, which suggests that its reformation was not more favored than that of ethanol or butanol. However, acetone may also be formed as by-product from dehydrogenation of ethanol and then aldol condensation (Nishiguchi et al., 2005). As regards selectivity, the main products obtained over CoIr/18CeZrO2 and CoIr/ZnO were H2 (60–70% molar in the products) and CO2 (20–30% molar in the products), in line with expectations for the oxidative steam reforming of raw mixture. However, if oxidative steam reforming occurred over CoIr/TiO2, it was to a lesser extent, and mainly CO x (CO and CO2) were produced, with a molar concentration of H2 in the products lower than 10%. CoIr/TiO2 also showed the highest selectivity to other by-products: butanal, methane and ethylene. It is well known that ethylene can easily be transformed into carbonaceous residues via polymerization, which may lead to catalyst poisoning and deactivation (Aguayo et al., 2002; Ramírez de la Piscina and Homs, 2008; Buitrago-Sierra et al., 2012). Ethylene formation over CoIr/TiO2 is related to the acidity of TiO2, which could favor the dehydration of ethanol: (2) C 2 H 5 OH → C 2 H 4 + H 2 O The CoIr/18CeZrO2 catalyst had the best catalytic performance, showing the highest reactant conversion and hydrogen concentration in the outlet. After 60h time-on-stream, CoIr/18CeZrO2 showed 86% of raw mixture conversion and 68.5mol% hydrogen concentration and a low production of CO (2.5mol%). Characterization of post-reaction catalysts by XRD indicated the presence of metallic cobalt; diffraction peaks characteristic of iridium-containing phases were not observed. Table 1 shows the Co° crystallite size determined by the Scherrer equation. Although in all cases the crystallite size of Co after the catalytic test was higher than that of Co3O4 of calcined catalyst, Co crystallites on post-reaction CoIr/18CeZrO2 were smaller (11nm) than on post-reaction CoIr/ZnO (19nm) and CoIr/TiO2 (20nm). Raman spectroscopy was used for characterizing the carbon deposits formed. Distinctive bands at ca. 1340cm−1 and 1605cm−1, D-band and G-band respectively, were present in all cases. G-band is attributed to the stretching mode of carbon sp2 bonds of ordered graphite, whereas the D-band is associated with disordered carbonaceous species. The relative intensity of both D and G can be used for comparing the graphitization degree of carbon deposits on the catalysts (Carrero et al., 2010). The analysis of Raman spectra shows: (i) in all cases the area of the D-band was higher than that of the G-band and (ii) the intensity of the bands corresponding to CoIr/TiO2 was much higher than that of bands of CoIr/ZnO and CoIr/18CeZrO2. This indicates that carbon deposits formed are disordered in all cases, with the carbonaceous deposits over CoIr/TiO2 more abundant than over CoIr/ZnO or CoIr/18CeZrO2. The I G/I D values of post-reaction catalysts were I G/I D =0.66, I G/I D =0.59, I G/I D =0.49 for CoIr/TiO2, CoIr/ZnO and CoIr/18CeZrO2 respectively. The formation of less ordered carbon deposits over CoIr/18CeZrO2 catalyst might be related to the oxygen storage capacity of the support. Oxygen defect sites existing in the support oxide could accelerate the activation of water/oxygen favoring the removing of coke deposited over the catalyst surface (Cai et al., 2012c; Song and Ozkan, 2009). It has been shown for Ir/CeO2 catalysts that highly dispersed Ir particles maintaining a sufficient iridium-ceria interfacial area, where the reaction occurs with a transfer of oxygen from ceria to Ir, is necessary for the continuous cleaning of carbonaceous entities. This is achieved through strong Ir–CeO2 interactions (Cai et al., 2008, 2012c). In summary, according to XRD and Raman results, CoIr/18CeZrO2, which showed the best catalytic performance, had the less sintering of cobalt species and coke formation. Moreover, CoIr/18CeZrO2 showed the greater reducibility and OSC. The combination of the properties of the bimetallic Co–Ir system and the CeO2–ZrO2 (18wt.% CeO2) support, gives a material which deserves further study for future developments of efficient catalysts for the oxidative steam reforming of higher alcohols."
6,Conclusions,"The present study clearly shows that support plays an important role in the oxidative steam reforming of bio-butanol raw mixture (butanol/acetone/ethanol=6/3/1 mass ratio). The performance, the reducibility and the OSC of the catalysts were in the order: CoIr/18CeZrO2 >CoIr/ZnO>CoIr/TiO2. Over CoIr/18CeZrO2, a gas containing 68.5mol% H2 was produced after ca. 60h of catalytic test at 500°C under 86% of bio-butanol raw mixture conversion. Characterization of post-reaction catalysts indicated that CoIr/18CeZrO2 had the lowest cobalt sintering and the smallest coke formation, which was related to the support redox characteristics."
