0,Introduction,"Ozone (O3) is a strong oxidant with a standard redox potential of 2.07 V/NHE that is commercially used for drinking water disinfection and wastewater pre- or post-treatment [1–4]. However, O3 is a selective oxidant due to its low reactivity toward organic pollutants with electron-withdrawing functional groups such as carboxyl, nitroso and saturated aliphatic acid [5,6], and can produce toxic byproducts [7]. In order to accelerate the mineralization of ozonation, ultrasound (US) is used here to promote the transformation of ozone into more reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH, E0=2.80 V/NHE), which have the advantages of being nonselective, and produce no secondary pollution while removing persistent and bio-refractory pollutants from water [8–10]. The “instantaneous hot spot” (up to 5000 K high temperature and 1000 atm high pressure) induced by ultrasonic cavitation bubbles provides the extreme chemical reaction conditions necessary for radical generation [11]. In the process of ozone chain initiation and chain propagation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formed in situ is a very important initiator for O3 decomposition and •OH production. The resultant chain reaction process is complex [12]. Therefore, investigation of the hydrogen peroxide formation mechanism during ultrasonic ozonation is essential in order to improve the yield of hydroxyl radicals and facilitate the application of ozone-based advanced oxidation technologies. During the ozonation/sonication process, a series of active species including •OH, •H, hydroperoxyl radical (HO2•), superoxide radical (•O2 ¯), and ozonide radical (•O3 ¯) are produced via reactive involving hydroxyl ions [13–15]. Some investigators believed that •OH is the primary reactive material for H2O2 production, while others suggested that the decomposition of O3 under ultrasonic irradiation results in direct production of H2O2 [16,17]. Until now, three possible pathways for H2O2 formation during the ultrasonic ozonation process have been investigated: (i) during ultrasonic irradiation, the triplet atomic oxygen O(3P) dissociated from gaseous O3 within transient cavitating bubbles yields •OH through hydrolysis reaction and then contributes to the production of H2O2 via •OH self-termination reactions [18,19]; (ii) •O2 ¯/•HO2 generated from radical-mediated reactions between •OH and ozone or some functional groups such as π electron structures produce H2O2 and oxygen via self-reaction [20,21]; and (iii) the thermal decomposition of water vapor during acoustic cavitation produces atomic hydrogen radicals, generating HO2• and H2O2 in the presence of oxygen through radical-mediated reactions. In natural waters, additive hydrogen peroxide formation pathways involving reactions between molecular ozone and organics with abundant aromatic rings have been proposed [22,23]. For instance, the degradation of pharmaceuticals and nitrobenzene via ozonation led to the generation of up to 1.3 × 10−4 mol/L hydrogen peroxide in situ, although the reaction mechanism lacked verification [24]. In addition, the reaction between dissolved organic material and •OH occur in the formation of carbon-centered radicals, which yield HO2• and then H2O2 via radical propagation reactions [25]. However, the influence of ultrasonic irradiation on ozone propagation and hydrogen peroxide formation, and the contribution of organics in natural waters have not been that thoroughly investigated. The principal objectives of this study are to determine whether direct ultrasonic-induced ozone dissociation or radical chain reactions are appropriate for the generation of H2O2, and explore the role of ultrasound during ozone decomposition. The evolution of H2O2 was investigated as a function of pH and in the presence/absence of active oxidation species scavengers to explore the mechanism of ozone chain-propagation reactions. In addition, the influence of common components of natural waters on the decomposition of ozone, reactive involving the ultrasonic microbubbles, and the formation of H2O2 was investigated."

2,Theoretical foundation,"2.1 Theoretical foundation The related chain reaction equations and corresponding equation parameters involving in this study were depicted in Table 1, and each part of the reactions will be discussed and verified in the following sections."
3,Materials and reagents,"2.2 Materials and reagents Tert-butanol (TBA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) were purchased from Aladdin Ltd., China. and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water purified by a Millipore Q Biocel System (R = 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity). All chemicals were analytical grade reagents, and used without further purification."
4,Experimental procedures,"2.3 Experimental procedures As depicted in Fig. 1, the experiments were performed in a 4L ultrasonic reactor (150 mm × 150 mm × 250 mm) with a continuous supply of ozone. Before the experiments, the reactor was pre-ozonated to satisfy any ozone demand in the reactor, and then was washed several times with distilled water. Ozone was produced from pure oxygen using an ozone generator (Qinghua Tongli Co. Ltd., China), and ultrasonic irradiation was generated by an ultrasonic generator (Shanghai Sonxi Ultrasonic Instrument, China). The ultrasonic probe connected with an ultrasonic generator was fixed at the top of the reactor to contact the liquid phase. A portion of the generated ozone was branched into an ozone analyser for the determination of its concentration, and the rest was fed into the ultrasonic reactor subsequently to contact thoroughly with the simulated water samples through an aerator at the bottom of the reactor. The synthetic solutions were pumped into the reactor by a magnetic pump (Shanghai Xishan Pump Co. Ltd., China) and then circulated at a rate of 2.0 L/min. Simultaneously, ultrasonic irradiation was operated to combine with the process of ozonation at a total applied ozone concentration of 4.0 mg/L. The water samples were taken at various reaction times, and the oxidation reaction was quenched with addition of saturated sodium thiosulphate solution. The residual gaseous ozone from the reactor was absorbed by KI solution. Each run in this study was carried out three times to ensure its reproducibility."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The concentration of residual gaseous ozone was absorbed by KI solution and measured by iodometric titration method [33]. The concentration of residual ozone in aqueous solution was measured by a BioQuest CE2501 spectrophotometer according to Indigo method [34]. The concentration of H2O2 formed in the oxidation system was measured using the p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (POPHA) fluoromatric method [35]. Briefly, ozone was sparged from the water samples quickly and vigorously before the peroxide measurements. During the oxidation process, H2O2 was continuously generated and reacted with POPHA to produce a dimeric product with strong fluorescence in the presence of enzyme peroxidase. The concentration of the fluorescent product was determined in accordance with the fluorescence intensity at 320 nm (excited at 400 nm) using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. The pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, and salinity of the solution were measured by an YSI-6600 V2 Multiparameter Water Quality Sonde. Total organic carbon (TOC) analyses were carried out with a Shimadzu 5000 A TOC analyzer operating in the nonpurgable organic carbon mode."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Formation of H2O2 in O3 and O3+US system,"3.1 Formation of H2O2 in O3 and O3+US system Under the initiation of hydroxyl ions, ozone decomposes into a series of active oxygen species such as HO2•, H2O2, •O2 ¯, •O3 ¯, •OH, and so forth. Among these intermediates, H2O2 is the key initiator for further dissociation of ozone to generate •OH, and the combination of ultrasound may also influence the entire chain propagation processes. To explore the transformation of O3 into H2O2, the evolution of residual O3 and accumulated H2O2 were investigated in aqueous phase solutions treated with O3 alone and O3+US processes separately. The applied ozone dose ([O3]A) in this study was fixed at 4.0 mg/L, a concentration that is commonly used for practical pre- or post-ozonation[5], in aqueous systems. The ultrasonic frequency chosen was 20 kHz, and the input ultrasonic power was 500 W, 1000 W or 1500 W. The evolution of residual ozone ([O3]R) is shown in Fig. 2(a). The concentration of ozone offgas ([O3]O) was also measured (Fig. 2(b)). The concentration of ozone consumed ([O3]C) and percent ozone utilization were calculated per Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) [O3]C = [O3]A - [O3]R - [O3]O (2) O3(utilization)=([O3]A-[O3]O)/[O3]A×100% The apparent ozone mass transfer coefficient (KLa) was calculated using the functioned relationship between ln [Cs/(Cs-Ct)] and reaction time: (3) ln [ C s / ( C s − C t ) ] = − K La t + constant where Cs is the maximum ozone equilibrium concentration, and Ct is the real-time ozone concentration. Resultant ozone mass transfer coefficients are shown in Fig. 2(c) and Table 2. The measured power input (using calorimetry), the ultrasonic transfer efficiency, power density and power intensity, and the variation of water temperature are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the [O3]R in ozone alone system increased continuously to a maximum value of 2.61 mg/L at 30 min. Addition of ultrasonic irradiation at 500 W, 1000 W, or 1500 W, accelerated the formation of [O3]R. The dissolution of ozone in water involved two processes: gas-liquid mass transfer and radical chemical reactions. Under ultrasonic irradiation, the decomposition of ozone was accelerated by enhancement of the gas-liquid mass transfer and radical-chain propagation reactions due to formation of ultra-micro bubbles. Compared to ozonation alone (Fig. 2(b)), ozone consumption increased from 0.29 mg/L to 1.53 mg/L as ultrasonic irradiation power increased from 0 W to 1000 W, and then declined to 1.08 mg/L at 1500 W. Meanwhile, the ozone utilization increased from 72.5% to 93.75% from 0 W to 1000 W, and then decreased to 89% at 1500 W. The addition of ultrasonication on both enhances the dispersion and solubility of ozone, promotes the pyrolytic decomposition of ozone through cavitation effect effective, thus improving ozone utilization. When the ultrasonic input power exceeded 1000 W, the increase of ozone saturation concentration was insufficient to counteract the decomposition of ozone, leading to 5% reduction in ozone utilization. Compared to ozone alone, the magnification of apparent ozone KLa values were 1.39, 4.08, and 2.61 at 500 W, 1000 W and 1500 W, respectively (Table 2). Under ultrasound, gas-phase ozone was separated into many super-micro bubbles enhancing the interfacial contact area of the gas-liquid surface, and local turbulence arriving from implosive of cavitation bubbles reduced resistance to gas-liquid mass transfer. However, the energy level at 1500 W promoted the coalescence of cavitation bubbles, resulting in 36% reduction of KLa for ozone gas-liquid mass transfer. Per Table 2 and Fig. 2(b), increased ambient liquid-phase temperature with augmented ultrasonic input power was another factor that led to the lower ozone dissolution rate and ozone utilization. To investigate the formation of H2O2 during the decomposition of ozone, the accumulation H2O2 in solution was measured in both O3 alone and O3+US processes. Per Fig. 3, H2O2 was both formed by the decomposition of ozone in both two processes. Absent ultrasound, the concentration of H2O2 increased continuously to a maximal value of 62 μg/L at 30 min. With the addition of ultrasonic irradiation from 500 W to 1500 W, the concentration of H2O2 increased more rapidly, to maximum values of 62 μg/L, 96 μg/L, and 80 μg/L, and then declined steadily to 59 μg/L, 76 μg/L, and 68 μg/L at 30 min. Ultrasonic irradiation promoted up to 54.8% generation of H2O2 at a reaction time of 15 min. However, ultrasonic irradiation power over 1000 W accelerated the coalescence of cavitation bubbles, resulting in 17% decrement of maximal H2O2 concentration. In the O3 +US system, both [O3]R and accumulated H2O2 exhibited the same variation trend of increase and then decrease. It has been demonstrated that the thermal decomposition of water vapor and ozone during acoustic cavitation can promote the generation of •OH [19,36], and the generated •OH can also be scavenged by itself to form H2O2 through radical coupling reaction [37]. Therefore, the deprotonated HO2 ¯ (pK(H2O2/HO2 ¯)=11.6) from accumulated H2O2 accelerated the decomposition of ozone under neutral or alkaline conditions [29], resulting in the decrease of concentrations of both residual ozone and H2O2. The effect of ultrasonication enhanced the initiation and propagation steps in ozone decomposition, resulting in the decrement of accumulated H2O2 in the process of ultrasonic ozonation. In summary, the synergistic effect of ultrasonic irradiation facilitated the generation of H2O2, however, exorbitant ultrasonic irradiation energy accelerated the coalescence of cavitation bubbles, resulting in 36% reduction of ozone gas-liquid mass transfer and 17% decrement of H2O2 generation."
8,Evolution on H2O2 initiation,"3.2 Evolution on H2O2 initiation The decline of H2O2 in the process of synergistic ozonation indicated the existence of matrix chain initiation and propagation reactions between H2O2/HO2 ¯ (pK(H2O2/HO2 ¯) =11.6) and the intermediate active oxygen radicals. To further clarify the impact of ultrasound on the initiation effect of H2O2 in the process of ozonation, the evolutions of H2O2 were investigated under different initial pH in both O3 alone and O3+US processes. The pH of the batch solution was adjusted to 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0, respectively, with addition of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, and the applied ozone dose was again 4.0 mg/L. The ultrasonic input power and ultrasonic frequency were set as 1000 W and 20 kHz based on the optimal experimental results to this point. Per Fig. 4(a), at pH 3.0, the concentration of H2O2 increased steadily to 19 μg/L during ozonation alone process and 48 μg/L in the O3 +US process. Although the decomposition of ozone via the initiation of •O2 ¯ (pK(HO2•/•O2 ¯ = 4.8) [29] and HO2 ¯ (pK(H2O2/HO2 ¯ = 11.6) is restrained at acidic condition, the production of triplet atomic oxygen O(3P) from gaseous ozone and thermal decomposition of water vapor within transient cavitation bubbles can also yield •OH and H2O2 subsequently through self-termination reactions (Eqs. 2–4 in Table 1). Besides, with the pKa for HO2• of 4.8, 98.5% •O2 ¯ will be protonated as •HO2 state at pH 3, yielding H2O2 via the via self-react termination steps, resulting in the continuous increase of H2O2 under acidic conditions, and the increment was improved under the interaction of ultrasonic irradiation. However, HO2• is far less reactive with ozone than •O2 ¯, so that the chain propagation leading to •OH production is blocked [32]. Consequently, the accumulation of H2O2 at pH 3.0 was much smaller than that at pH 6.0 (62 μg/L for O3 process and 96 μg/L for O3 +US process, as depicted in Fig. 4(b)). When the initial pH of the solution increased to 6.0, as shown in Fig. 4(b), in O3 alone process, the concentration of H2O2 increased continuously to a steady value of 71 μg/L at 25 min, while in O3 +US process, the concentration of H2O2 presented a positive increase to a maximum of 146 μg/L at the first 20 min and then a decrease to 102 μg/L. With the pKa for HO2• of 4.8, 94.0% •O2 ¯ generated from the decomposition of ozone via chain propagation reactions is deprotonated at pH 6.0, and the •O3 ¯ is formed subsequently via the reaction between •O2 ¯ and O3 at a high reaction rate constant of 1.6 × 109 L/mol s [32]. Meanwhile, with the pKa for HO3• of 6.15, 58.5% •O3 ¯ is protonated as the HO3• state at pH 6.0 and then decomposes into •OH at a high reaction rate constant of 9 × 109 L/mol·s [30], resulting in the increase of •OH and H2O2 through radical coupling reaction at a high reaction rate constant 5.5 × 109 L/mol s [28]. Furthermore, the rate constant for H2O2 formation by the reaction between HO2• and •O2 ¯ (9.7 × 107 L/mol s) [20] is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the reaction between HO2• and HO2• (8.3 × 105 L/mol s) [20], resulting in greater H2O2 accumulation at pH 6. The instantaneous hot spot generated in and around cavitation bubbles accelerates the generation of •OH via ozone chain initiation and propagation reactions, resulting in enhancement of H2O2 concentration under ultrasound. At pH 9.0, H2O2 increased to a maximum of 41 μg/L at 15 min (O3 alone) and then declined to 15 μg/L at 30 min. Similarly, in O3+US process, the accumulated concentration of H2O2 reached a maximum of 72 μg/L at 10 min and then declined steadily to 15 μg/L at 30 min. Since HO2 ¯, the key initiator for ozone decomposition, always present at a higher concentration under alkaline condition [29], and this can account for the relatively low level of peroxide accumulation at pH 9.0. Previous studies also demonstrated that the concentration of H2O2 formed at pH 8.8 increased in the first 5–10 min and then decreased in both ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes, and that the combination of ultrasonication facilitated the production of •OH from O(3P) and water vapor within transient cavitation bubbles [21]. The faster achievement of maximal values of H2O2 in O3+US process at both neutral and alkaline conditions indicates that the recombination of •OH is one of the main reaction pathways for H2O2 formation. The evolution of H2O2 at different initial pH demonstrated that the HO2 ¯was involved in the initiation and propagation of ozone decomposition. Ultrasonic irradiation both promoted the generation and conversion of •OH into H2O2, and accelerated the subsequent decomposition of H2O2."
9,Influence of crucial active species on H2O2 formation,"3.3 Influence of crucial active species on H2O2 formation The experimental results of Section 3.1 and 3.2 showed that H2O2 was generated via the decomposition of ozone, and the HO2 ¯ was involved in the initiation and propagation of ozone decomposition under neutral and alkaline conditions. To further investigate the source of H2O2 resulting from either the direct decomposition of ozone or the recombination of intermediate products such as •OH and •O2 ¯, a series of experiments was conducted to establish the effects maximal values of H2O2 concentration ([H2O2]max) in the presence of 1 mol/L TBA (used to quench •OH), 500 U/ mL SOD (quench •O2 ¯), or 1 mol/L NBT (quench •OH and •O2 ¯) on maximum values of H2O2. Results are summarized in Fig. 5. The reaction rate constant of TBA with •OH (8 × 108 L/mol s) is much higher than that with ozone (3 × 10-3 L/mol s) [38], and the inert aldehyde intermediates generated from the reaction between TBA and •OH terminate the radical chain reaction. In the presence of TBA, [H2O2]max was reduced by 60%－from 46 μg/L to 18 μg/L during ozonation, and 69%－from 126 μg/L to 39 μg/L during ozonation/ultrasonication. Results suggest that •OH was dominant for H2O2 formation in both O3 alone and O3+US processes, and that the contribution of •OH was improved manifestly by ultrasonication. The decomposition of ozone yields numbers of unstable oxygen species such as •O2 ¯, HO2•, •O3 ¯, HO3• and •OH, and relatively stable H2O2 from the self-termination reactions involving •HO2. Application of ultrasound to the same ozone solution increased the production of •OH through the thermal decomposition of water vapor and gaseous ozone within transient cavitation bubbles. SOD catalyzes the decomposition of •O2 ¯ into H2O2 and O2 at a reaction rate constant of 1.3 × 109 L/mol s to terminate chain reactions involving •O2 ¯ [39]. The addition of SOD decreased the concentration of [H2O2]max by 40% during ozonation and 35% for the O3+US process. The lower inhibition of SOD system than that of TBA indicated that the •O2 ¯ generated from the decomposition of ozone via chain propagation reactions either transformed into HO3• and •OH via electron transfer reactions, or generated H2O2 directly by recombination reactions. On the one hand, after inhibiting the •O2 ¯ involved chain propagation reactions, a handful of H2O2 was still able to be generated via •OH self-termination reactions. On the other hand, certain amount of H2O2 was regenerated from the reaction between •O2 ¯ and SOD, leading to a relative lower inhibition rate of [H2O2]max in SOD system. With the addition of ultrasonic irradiation, •OH generated within the cavitation bubbles contributed to H2O2 concentrations, resulting in the lower inhibition rate of [H2O2]max in the SOD system. NBT was used as a probe to react with both •OH and •O2 ¯ simultaneously by electron transfer reactions [40]. With the addition of NBT, the [H2O2]max fell by more than 90% in both O3 alone and O3 +US systems, indicating that H2O2 was barely generated from ozone molecules under ultrasound irradiation. It follows that the primary source of H2O2 in both O3 alone and O3 +US processes involves •OH and •O2 ¯ radical-recombination reactions. Based on the above experimental results, the radical-mediated chain reactions in the process of ultrasonic ozonation involved initiation, propagation, and chain termination steps. The corresponding reaction pathway schema and reaction equations are summarized in Fig. 6 and Table 1. 3.3.1 Chain initiation reactions Thermal decompositions of water vapor and gaseous ozone within transient cavitation bubbles generate •OH at a reaction rate constant 1.3 × 104 L/mol s (Eqs. 1–3) [27], and then yield H2O2 through radical coupling reaction at a high rate constant 5.5 × 109 L/mol s (Eq. 4). 3.3.2 Chain propagation reactions The deprotonated HO2 ¯ (pK(H2O2/HO2 ¯) = 11.6) accelerates the decomposition of ozone into •O2 ¯/HO2• at a reaction rate constant of 2.2 × 106 L/mol s (Eq. 5–6) [39]. The •O2 ¯/HO2• produces H2O2 via radical self-reaction (Eq. 14). •O3 ¯ is formed in the subsequent reactions at a high reaction rate constant of 1.6 × 109 L/mol s (Eq. 7–10), facilitating the regeneration of •OH and H2O2 through chain propagation reactions (Eq. 11–12). 3.3.3 Chain termination reactions Multiple radical inhibitors such as inorganic ions and alkyl groups in natural waters block the chain reactions involving •OH and •O2 ¯ at high reaction rate constants (106–109 L/mol s) (Eq. 13), resulting in the termination of radical chain reactions and the decline H2O2 concentration."
10,Influence of water quality on H2O2 formation,"3.4 Influence of water quality on H2O2 formation The experimental results of previous sections indicated that the pH of the solution and the species of oxidation intermediates were the crucial factors for the formation of H2O2 in the process of ozonation. However, the complex constituents that act as promoters or inhibitors of ozone in natural waters may also participate in the complex radical-intermediate chain reactions. To further evaluate the influence of water constituents on the decomposition of ozone and the formation of H2O2, the half-lives of ozone (T1/2-O3) and the concentration of H2O2 in the O3 alone and O3 +US processes were investigated in ultrapure water, reverse osmosis pretreated water, tapwater and seawater. The primary water quality parameters were listed in Table 3, and the unabridged information is provided in Table S1. Tapwater was collected from Lingshui Reservior in Dalian, China, with total organic carbon of 1.35 mg/L and total algae of 21,300 cells/mL. The reverse osmosis pretreated water was derived from the tapwater after pre-filtration and reverse osmosis filtration (aperture = 0.1 nm) to remove most microorganisms and inorganic and organic matters. The ultrapure water was derived from reverse osmosis pretreated water after ion exchange treatment and UV disinfection to remove ultrastructural dissolved matters. The seawater taken from Dalian harbor, had a salinity of 32.50 PSU, total organic carbon of 1.85 mg/L, and total algae of 21,000 cells/mL. The applied ozone dose for the four different simulated waters was adjusted to 4.0 mg/L, and the ultrasonic input power was set as 1000 W. Experimental results are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 7. The ozone decay experiments in all four waters types followed first-order kinetics. The T1/2-O3 values were calculated from the logarithmic decline of ozone concentration. As shown in Table 2, in O3 alone process, the T1/2-O3 in ultrapure water reached 35.2 min and declined with attenuation ratio at 18%, 25% and 54% in reverse osmosis water, tap water and seawater, respectively. Similarly, in O3+US process, the T1/2-O3 in ultrapure water reached 20.9 min and declined with attenuation ratio at 37%, 39% and 70% in reverse osmosis water, tap water and seawater. From ultrapure water to seawater, the content of impurities that may affect the chain decomposition of ozone such as peroxides (initiator), aromatics (promoter), and carbonate ions (inhibitor) increases, resulting in the increase of turbidity, conductivity, TOC and the consumption of ozone. Aromatic rings at micromolar concentrations react with •OH or O3 to yield olefins and H2O2, and the dissociated HO2 ¯ would strongly accelerate the decomposition of O3 [41]. Previous experiments also proved that hydrogen peroxide was formed during the direct reaction of molecular ozone with para-chlorophenol [22]. In addition, the electrolytes and inorganic anions such as chloride ions contained in natural waters enhance the zeta potential and inner pressure of ultrasonic microbubbles [42], thus promoting the decomposition and chemical propagation reactions of ozone during the application of ultrasonic irradiation [43]. Per Fig. 7, the [H2O2]max values in reverse osmosis water were 78 μg/L for O3 alone process and 163 μg/L for O3 +US process, higher than the values of the other three kinds of background waters. Compared with the reverse osmosis water, the [H2O2]max values were reduced by 20%, 22% and 38% in ultrapure water, tap water and seawater in the O3 alone process and 23%, 40% and 56% in the O3 +US process, respectively. A slight addition of organics such as primary alcohol, fulvic and formic acids to reverse osmosis water promoted the decomposition of ozone to regenerate •OH and •O2 ¯ [23], increasing [H2O2]max by 26% of H2O2 generation during ozonation and 29% for the O3+US process. In addition, the residual inorganic radical inhibitors in reverse osmosis water such as HCO3 ¯ (2.6 mg/L) and SO4 2¯ (1.8 mg/L) would also transform the •OH into HO2• [20], and subsequently regenerate H2O2 through self-termination reactions, causing the higher [H2O2]max in reverse osmosis water than in ultrapure water. In the presence of ultrasonic irradiation, the potential difference (zeta potential) of ultrasonic microbubbles causing by surface charge was significantly increased owing to the charged ions that captured on the gas-liquid surface, restraining the coalescence of microbubbles and promoting the radical chain propagation reactions in reverse osmosis water [44]. However, superabundant levels of radical inhibitors such as inorganic ions and alkyl group in tap water and seawater terminated the •OH involved chain reactions at high rate constant (~108 L/mol s), resulting in the decline of H2O2 via •OH-mediate reactions. In addition, a more complete dissociation of H2O2 at higher pH also accelerated the decline of [H2O2]max to some extent. Overall, the electrolytes and inorganic anions contained in natural waters led to the enhancement of the zeta potential and inner pressure of ultrasonic microbubbles, and thus promoted the chemical propagation reactions of ozonation during the application of ultrasonic irradiation. A slight amount of organics in reverse osmosis water promoted the decomposition of ozone to regenerate •OH and •O2 ¯, thus accelerating the formation of H2O2. However, higher levels of radical inhibitors in natural waters terminated the •OH involved chain reactions, suppressing the formation of H2O2 via radical-mediated reactions."
11,Conclusions,"This study investigated the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on H2O2 formation mechanism in the process of ozonation. The evolution of O3 and H2O2 demonstrated that H2O2 initiated the radical-mediated chain reactions in ozonation, and the synergistic effect of ultrasonic irradiation facilitated the utilization of ozone and the chain propagation of H2O2 in the further chain reactions. The deprotonated HO2 ¯ was involved in the initiation and propagation of ozone decomposition, and the synergistic effect of ultrasonic irradiation promoted the generation and conversion of •OH into H2O2. Exorbitant ultrasonic irradiation energy over 1000 W promoted the coalescence of cavitation bubbles, resulting in 36% reduction of ozone gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient and 17% inhibition of H2O2 generation. More than 90% of H2O2 was suppressed with the addition of •OH and •O2 ¯ scavengers, indicating that H2O2 was generated from the radical-mediated reactions, rather than the direct decomposition of ozone under the irradiation of ultrasound. The electrolytes and inorganic anions containing in natural waters enhanced the cavitation efficiency on ultrasonic microbubbles, and thus promoting the chemical propagation reactions of ozonation. The moderate organic predecessors in reverse osmosis water promoted the generation of •OH, •O2 ¯, and H2O2. However, higher levels of radical inhibitors in tap water and seawater terminated the •OH involved chain reactions, suppressing the formation of H2O2 via radical-mediated reactions. The investigation of crucial influence elements on H2O2 evolution in the process of ultrasonic ozonation provided immediate experimental evidences to enhance the transformation of ozone and the production of radicals in actual water treatment."
