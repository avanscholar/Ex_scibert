0,Introduction,"Photocatalysis has been explored to utilize the solar energy to decompose organic contaminations for environmental remediation, to split water into H2 and O2 [1–4], to reform/consume methanol/sacrificial agents for H2 production [5–10], to reduce CO2 to produce renewable fuels [11–13], to fix N2 to produce NH3 [14–16] and to convert organic compounds to value-added chemicals [17–21], among which, conversion of organic molecules (photo-synthesis) is a promising application of photocatalysis due to the milder conditions and the cost-efficient energy input compared with the traditional thermal catalytic processes. The selective oxidation of alcohols, especially for the preparation of carbonyl compounds, is one of the fundamental chemical transformations in industrial catalysis. Generally, in a typical photocatalytic organic conversion reaction, the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols mainly involves five steps: i) the adsorption of alcohols onto the surface of the photocatalyst/cocatalyst; ii) the excitation of the photocatalyst to generate electron-hole pairs; iii) charge separation and migration to the surface of the photocatalyst/cocatalyst; iv) the redox reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst/cocatalyst and v) the desorption of products. Thus, the light-absorption ability, band structure, crystallinity, the structure of the cocatalyst, and the adsorption/desorption of alcohols/products play important roles in the efficient and selective photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols. Typically, photo-oxidation of alcohols follows two approaches: the aerobic photo-oxidation with oxygen (or air) as most suitable oxidant, and the anaerobic photo-oxidation via dehydrogenation, resulting in hydrogen gas as the coupled product [22–26]. To date, much effort has been devoted to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the oxidation of alcohols via adjusting the structure of the photocatalyst/cocatalyst, tuning the reaction medium and exploring the mechanism. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in catalyst design, reaction condition adjusting and mechanistic understanding, including defect engineering, hetero-structure formation, doping, cocatalyst engineering, solvent/atmosphere adjusting, and mechanistic analysis via EPR and DRIFTS. The challenges and prospective for future investigations in this field are also included."
1,Design and engineering of the photocatalysts,"Photocatalysis is an economically efficient and eco-friendly option for alcohol oxidation. Various semiconductor photocatalysts for selective organic synthesis have been investigated in the past few years. Oxides [27–30], sulfides [31–34], nitrides [35,36], MOFs [37,38], COFs [39,40] and their related hybrid materials [41–45] have been identified as effective photocatalysts for the oxidation of alcohols. However, in many cases, the photocatalyst is only active under UV light. With UV light irradiation, the photocatalytic systems may yield undesirable by-products because of over-oxidation, which results in low utilization efficiency of solar light and poor selectivity to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones [46,47]. For example, upon UV-light irradiation, not only benzaldehyde but also CO2 and benzoic acid are formed over titanium oxide during benzyl alcohol photo-oxidation under aerobic condition [48]. Therefore, visible-light responsive photocatalysts have been explored to improve the light-harvesting and to enhance the selectivity for efficient alcohol conversion into carbonyl compounds. Generally, the design of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts can be achieved by doping, defect engineering and hetero-structure construction using wide-band and narrow-band semiconductors."
2,Doping,"2.1 Doping In the process of photocatalysis, only when the valence band (VB)/the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst is more positive/negative than the potential of the redox pair in solution, the photogenerated hole-electron pairs can participate in the redox process, realizing the targeted oxidation/reduction reaction. When the difference between the VB and CB edges is larger than 3.1 eV, the photocatalyst can only be excited by UV light, which significantly limits the efficiency of solar light utilization [49,50]. Doping is one of the most widely applicable process in materials engineering which involves the introduction of atoms or ions into the host semiconductor lattices to obtain doped materials with desirable electronic structure and appropriate properties [51–53]. Basically, by the doping technique for band-structure adjusting, the metal or non-metal ions used as dopants can be introduced into the wide-band semiconductor resulting in impurity levels near the VB and CB, which would lower the band gap and decrease the oxidation/reduction ability of the host semiconductors (Fig. 1 ) [54–59]. The limited oxidation ability usually contributes to the enhanced selectivity in the photo-oxidation reaction [60]. Zhao et al. [61] first investigated Rh-doped strontium titanate (Rh-STO) prepared by a polymerized complex route (PC) loaded with Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as oxidic photocatalyst for alcohol dehydrogenation under visible light. Without added rhodium, the undoped STO showed nearly no activity under visible-light irradiation, while 1 mol% Rh-doped STO achieved the best photocatalytic performance with almost 70% conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. It was found that Rh doping causes a negative shift of the valence band, thus lowering the band gap, which is beneficial for both light adsorption and high selectivity. Xu et al. [62] synthesized PANI/FeUiO-66 nanohybrids via introducing Fe as dopant into UiO-66 and combining with conductive polyaniline (PANI) for the selective aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols under visible light. The authors found that due to the doping of Fe, the band gaps of as-prepared samples narrowed. However, when the other semiconductor PANI was introduced, the bandgap would be further narrowed, and the optimal doping hetero-sample, PANI/FeUiO-66 (1:1) obtained a ~ 0.85 eV lower bandgap than the original one. A multi-step process was proposed: firstly, PANI can be excited generating electrons and holes under visible-light irradiation. Since the CB potential of PANI was more negative than FeUiO-66 and the VB potential of FeUiO-66 was more positive than PANI, the photo-generated electrons of PANI can be easily and directly transferred into the CB of FeUiO-66, while holes can be transferred in the opposite way. Then, the electrons were transferred from the excited ligand to the Zr-O oxo-clusters by linker-to-metal cluster charge-transfer (LMCT) forming Zr3+, and then Zr3+ released electrons subsequently to reduce O2 generating O2 −. The doping of Fe is assumed to provide a synergistic effect with Zr species by metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT), thus enhancing the efficiency in charge separation. As a result, O2 − and holes oxidized the substrate alcohol to the aldehyde (Fig. 2 ). Non-metal elements were also recently doped into photocatalysts for enhancing photocatalytic activity [63–68]. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an attractive semiconductor because of its nontoxic and nonmetallic properties, and especially due to its narrow optical band structure. However, the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 is restricted by the low quantum efficiency and a high rate of recombination of excitonic charge carriers. To solve this problem, Zhang and co-workers [69] fabricated non-metal elements P and S co-doped mesoporous g-C3N4 microspheres by a facile supramolecular chemistry mediated one-pot strategy to achieve the simultaneous manipulation of morphology and electronic structure. DFT calculations were performed to verify that P and S doping was able to generate an extra defect state below the CB compared with pristine g-C3N4. The newly formed mid-gap states can act as donor levels for lower-energy photoexcitation, enabling better visible light harvesting and higher selectivity. Impressively, the optimal P-doped and S-doped photocatalyst samples produced much higher amounts of benzaldehyde and hydrogen as coupled product, which are 10.8 and 13.2 times higher than over bulk g-C3N4 under visible light, respectively."
3,Defect engineering,"2.2 Defect engineering Defect engineering has been one of the most widely used methods to improve the photocatalytic performance. Generally, appropriate defects can efficiently separate photoinduced charge carriers, properly alter the electronic structure and create surface active sites [70–74]. The introduction of defects has been usually accomplished with the aid of reductants like NaBH4, by thermal treatment in inert atmosphere or by doping [65–81]. For example, the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 is limited by rapid recombination of exitonic pairs, ineffective charge separation and unsatisfactory visible-light absorption. Wang et al. [82] prepared Bi2WO6-x nanosheets with tunable Bi quantum dots and oxygen vacancies using NaBH4. FESEM images showed typical two-dimensional nanosheets with an average length of ca. 700 nm and an ultrathin thickness less than 10 nm, and TEM images also revealed the presence of worm-like mesopores. The XPS signals of metallic Bi0, W5+ cations, and Oads indicated the presence of Bi quantum dots and oxygen vacancies (Fig. 3 ). Furthermore, with the amount of oxygen vacancies increasing, the band gap had a tendency to be narrowed confirmed by UV–vis DRS spectra. The authors attributed this phenomenon to oxygen vacancy (OV) defect states, proposing that the formation of OV induced defect states below the conduction band, causing the efficient separation of photoelectron-hole pairs and light-harvesting ability, and finally resulting in an improvement of photocatalytic performance. Zhang and co-workers fabricated defect-rich WO3 by calcining the WO3·H2O powder in a nitrogen atmosphere [83]. Oxygen adsorption was greatly enhanced due to the surface defects which provide abundant coordinately unsaturated sites for oxygen activation. Therefore, the presence of the surface defects successfully separated the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and delivered the charge carriers to the chemisorbed species. As a result, the superoxide radicals in a chemisorbed state can react with the amines, which were adsorbed at the neighbor sites, forming the corresponding imines eventually. The efficiency rate was 6 times higher than that over defect-deficient WO3 under the same conditions. Similar to oxygen vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors, nitrogen vacancies have been investigated in g-C3N4 to regulate the band gap and improve the overall quantum efficiency [84]. With high temperature thermal condensation of nitric acid-pretreated melamine as a precursor, g-C3N4 nanosheets with nitrogen vacancies have been fabricated, which exhibited a significant red-shift absorption with the band gap energies in the range of 2.06–2.70 eV. To understand the negative correlations between the amount of nitric acid and the band gap energies, XPS analysis demonstrated that the VB energy of g-C3N4 and defective g-C3N4 denoted as CNNA (0.9) are the same amounting to 1.57 eV, while the corresponding conduction bands of g-C3N4 and CNNA (0.9) were calculated to be −1.13 eV and −0.88 eV, suggesting that nitrogen vacancies in the g-C3N4 potentially result in a partial overlap of additional electronic states in the conduction band, leading to the narrowing of the band gap of g-C3N4 and the enhancement of optical absorption. Besides, defective g-C3N4 could provide not only a number of nitrogen-containing groups on its surface, but also a higher surface area, and these conditions act together to exert a significant positive effect on transforming aromatic alcohols under simulated sunlight [84]. As a well-known method to introduce defects into photocatalysts, moderate element doping can expand the photo-response region and reduce the recombination process of photo-generated charge carriers. During low-temperature calcination, Zhao et al. [61] showed that Rh in the lattice of STO mainly remains Rh3+, which can induce the generation of oxygen vacancies at the surface, especially in the case of nanoparticles, causing the facilitated dissociative adsorption of alcohols on the surface of Rh-doped SrTiO3, which leads to stable alcohol dehydrogenation with high conversion and selectivity. Further investigations indicated that the enriched oxygen vacancies in Rh-doped SrTiO3 calcined at 600 °C facilitate the cleavage of the α-C–H bond in alcohols. Moreover, Zhao et al. also found that the photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohols takes place via the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, but not via the coupled water reduction and benzyl alcohol oxidation, due to the activation of the α -C–H bond by the enriched oxygen vacancies (Fig. 4 ). Besides Rh as dopant, Hu and co-workers [85] also demonstrated that the introduction of Fe into the SrTiO3 lattice can successfully induce the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, which contribute to the adsorption and activation of the α-C–H bond, thus substantially enhancing oxidation efficiency compared with undoped SrTiO3."
4,Hetero-structure engineering,"2.3 Hetero-structure engineering Hybrid semiconductor catalysts have been reported to have improved performance compared with the single components, thus engineering heterojunctions in photocatalysts has been shown to be one of the most promising strategies for the preparation of advanced photocatalysts because of its feasibility and effectiveness for the spatial separation of electron-hole pairs [86–90]. In the preparation of heterojunction catalysts, the improved space charge separation due to the relative energy positions of the valence band and the conduction band of the semiconductor should be considered. Conventionally, there are four typical types of heterojunction photocatalysts (Fig. 5 ) [87]. For the type-I heterojunction photocatalyst, the CB and VB of semiconductor A are respectively higher and lower than the corresponding band positions of semiconductor B [91]. Therefore, under light illumination, photogenerated holes and electrons will only accumulate on semiconductor B, thus effectively separating the photogenerated carriers and lowering the redox potential to enhance the photocatalytic performance [87]. And for the type-II heterojunction photocatalyst, the CB and the VB positions of semiconductor A are higher than the corresponding bands of the semiconductor B [89,92,93]. In consequence, once light irradiate, the photogenerated electrons will migrate to the CB of semiconductor B, while the photogenerated holes will transfer to the VB of semiconductor A, leading to a spatial separation of photogenerated carriers. However, the architecture of type-III heterojunction photocatalyst is similar to the former one except for the extreme staggered gap so that the bandgaps will not be overlapped [94,95]. The forth type represents the Z-scheme type heterojunction with solid-state electron mediator as shown in Fig. 6 , which is advanced in the availability of the strongly reductive electrons of one photocatalyst and the strongly oxidative holes of the other [96]. As a result, there are two requirements when forming heterostructures, i.e., effective separation of photo-generated electrons and holes between two semiconductors, and relatively close band potentials [97–99]. The former one makes sure that the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes on narrow semiconductors is less likely, and the latter one provides accessible pathways for electrons and holes to enter the adjacent semiconductors. Therefore, the photoelectric characteristics of each component should be taken into consideration for designing suitable photocatalysts. Both rutile TiO2 and SnO2 belong to the tetragonal crystal system, and the dimension for rutile TiO2 is a = 4.594 Å and for SnO2 is a = 4.737 Å. By forming heteroepitaxial (HEPI) junctions consisting of SnO2 nanorods and rutile TiO2 (Fig. 7 ), Kenta Awa et al. [100] found a corresponding mismatch between SnO2 and rutile TiO2, and thus a compressive strain in the SnO2-NR near the interface, which induces the continuous increase in the a-axis length extending over 60 nm towards the (001) direction from the root to the tip, generating a downward band bending in the direction of the SnO2-NR. The change in band structure led to a decrease in the difference of the CB potential between rutile TiO2 and SnO2-NR. As a result, electrons are smoothly transferred to the CB of SnO2-NR through the atomically commensurate interface, while the holes are left in the VB of TiO2, and finally, the effective separation of electrons and holes can improve the performance of selective photooxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Wang et al. [101] carried out a series of experiments with heterostructure photocatalysts using BiOX and Bi2WO6 (X = Cl, Br, I) as the candidates. It was found that BiOBr had significantly better photocatalytic activities than other samples. The results originating from analyzing the band gap structures of heterostructure photocatalysts synthesized by different halogen elements showed that the CB and VB positions of BiOCl or BiOBr were staggered with that of Bi2WO6, while a sandwich band structure between BiOI and Bi2WO6 occurred, indicating the same movement direction of photo-generated electrons and holes on BiOI, which had no positive effects for the separation. When combining BiOCl with Bi2WO6, the wide band gap of BiOCl inhibited the generation of electrons under visible-light irradiation, although the differences the CB positions between the two semiconductors were slight which means electrons were able to transfer from Bi2WO6 to BiOCl, while the holes were still not able to pass from BiOCl to Bi2WO6, leading to a lower photocatalytic activity than BiOBr-Bi2WO6, in which the positions of the VB and CB edges between the two semiconductors matched quite well."
5,Cocatatalyst engineering,"Usually the cocatalyst itself cannot be excited under illumination, but it functions as supplementary catalyst to accelerate the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and to decrease the activation energy of the surface redox reaction [102–104]. For example, the deposition of metal nanoparticles as cocatalyst on the surface of photocatalysts has been demonstrated as one of the most efficient strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance. This is due to the metal cocatalyst’s ability to trap electrons to separate photo-generated electron-hole pairs and to provide active sites for the reduction of various absorbed species on the photocatalyst surface [105,106]. Several noble metals such as Pt, Au, Ag and Pd have been investigated in the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols as cocatalyst recently [23,61,85,107–110]. Especially Pt with the largest work function among the widely used noble metals is the best and most commonly used cocatalyst for trapping electrons [61,85]. Higashimoto et al. [109] proposed a mechanism for the anaerobic dehydrogenation of alcohols over a CdS-TiO2 photocatalyst with deposited Pd as cocatalyst. From the XPS analysis, Pd existed in two forms assigned to PdS and metallic Pd. The photo-generated holes transfer to the PdS sites for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, while the electrons reduced the protons to H2 on the metallic Pd sites. As a result, the catalytic performance was remarkably improved. In 2019, Zhao et al. [61] reported that the photocatalytic performance of benzyl alcohol oxidation was substantially enhanced when Pt was loaded on Rh-doped SrTiO3 (STO) photocatalysts. Under visible-light irradiation for 6 h, Rh-STO achieved only 4% conversion in the absence of Pt, while with optimized 2.65 wt% Pt loading, Pt-loaded Rh-STO reached a degree of benzyl alcohol conversion up to nearly 73% under the same conditions. Hu and co-workers [85] successfully deposited Pt nanoparticles with diameters of 4–5 nm homogeneously on the large Fe-STO particles sized 20–30 nm for anaerobic alcohol oxidation. As a result, the amount of produced benzaldehyde reached 130.3 μmol, which was almost 13-fold higher than that on Fe-STO without Pt loading. Meng’s group [106] concluded that the atomically dispersed Pt x clusters could offer the maximum atom efficiency and provide more active sites on the photocatalyst surface as cocatalyst in comparison to Pt nanoparticles or other conventional cocatalysts. As a result, 1962.1 μmol H2 and 1998.3 μmol benzaldehyde were produced with high selectivity, however, a quantifiable number of by-products was detected under the same conditions. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for H2 evolution over Pt-loaded Zn3In2S6 photocatalysts reached 4.6%. Paul and co-workers [110] first investigated the Ag/WO3 photocatalyst for the oxidation of various aromatic alcohols. The improved photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the size and morphology of the Ag/WO3 nanostructure. WO3 nanorods with diameters of ~ 20–40 nm served effectively as a platform for higher dispersion of small Ag nanoparticles (~10 nm) to create more active sites for the reaction. In conclusion, the loading of Ag successfully improved the separation of photoinduced charge carriers, thus efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic performance. When the frequency of the incident photons matches well with the inherent frequency of the free electrons on the metal nanoparticles surface, this will lead to a collective oscillation, and the metal nanoparticles will strongly absorb these photons. This effect is known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [111–113]. Supported gold nanoparticles can also exhibit a significant positive effect enhancing the photocatalytic ability during alcohol oxidation reaction process due to the LSPR effect. Zhu et al. [108] demonstrated that Au as cocatalyst on ZnIn2S4 was able to improve the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol efficiently. Fig. 8 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of ZnIn2S4 with different loading amounts of Au. It can be seen that the light absorption of the samples in the visible region is gradually improved with increasing amount of Au loading. The yields of H2 and benzaldehyde were 326.68 and 352.04 μmol, respectively, over optimal 0.5% Au/ZnIn2S4 under light illumination for 4 h. The introduction of plasmonic Au nanoparticles not only improved the photocatalytic performance, but also endowed the photocatalysts with extended light absorption. Li and co-workers [114] prepared Au/CeO2 hybrid nanofibers (Fig. 9 ) by electrospinning. The enhanced visible-light absorption caused by the Au nanoparticle LSPR effect has also proved to efficiently enhance the photocatalytic efficiency for selective alcohol conversion. Besides mono-metallic cocatalysts, metal alloys have also been synthesized and reported in the field of photocatalytic alcohol oxidation, which act as cocatalyst to trap electrons from the semiconductor and improve the charge separation and transfer efficiency. Compared with single metals, alloy cocatalysts commonly show higher activity due to the synergistic effect between the two metals. Bimetallic AuPt cocatalysts, which contain plasmonic metals, also possess the LSPR effect. Han and co-workers [115] reported that the H2 evolution rate of Au-Pt@CdS achieved 153 μmol h−1, which is about 21.2 times as high as that over blank CdS, indicating that AuPt is a promising cocatalyst for CdS enhancing the photocatalytic alcohol oxidation. Bimetallic AuPd NPs were also deposited on Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets by Wang and co-workers [23]. The absorption of visible light was obviously promoted, and higher efficiencies for the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers were achieved. Although noble metal cocatalysts are well-known for promoting photocatalytic activity, their practical applications are limited because of limited resources and high prices. Therefore, exploring alternative low-cost cocatalysts is necessary. Non-noble metals such as Ni and Co have been applied for photocatalytic anaerobic oxidation of alcohols [115–119]. Among the non-noble metals, the work function of Ni is the most promising as substitute for noble metal cocatalyst for alcohol oxidation [62,117,119,120]. In 2016, Xu’s group [62] successfully fabricated a Ni/CdS photocatalyst, in which the non-noble metal Ni as cocatalyst was loaded on the surface of CdS for alcohol dehydrogenation under visible-light irradiation. In the absence of the cocatalyst, the bare CdS showed a low conversion (50%) for benzyl alcohol, and the selectivity for benzaldehyde was only 9%. In case Ni was loaded, benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde with high conversion (96%) and excellent selectivity (96%). These results suggest that an interface between Ni and CdS efficiently enhanced the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and improved the photocatalytic activity. Zhang et al. [120] investigated the photocatalytic performance over Ni/ZnCdS, and indeed the activity of Ni/ZnCdS is much higher than that of pristine ZnCdS and ZnCdS loaded with NiO or Pt. Thus, metallic Ni plays a vital role in strongly inhibiting the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers and activating the α-C–H bond, which is a key step in the dehydrogenation of alcohols. Jiang and co-workers [121] investigated the role of the Co cocatalyst on a CdS photocatalyst for alcohol oxidation. It turned out that Co/CdS presented the best photocatalytic alcohol oxidation performance and yielded 848 μmol H2 with high selectivity. This phenomenon mainly results from efficient electrons transfer in the Co/CdS hybrid system from CdS to Co, leading to the spatial separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. Metal oxides have also been shown to play an important role in enhancing photocatalytic activity. Verma et al. [122] loaded vanadium oxide (V x O y ) on the surface of g-C3N4. Pure g-C3N4 showed 10% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light irradiation in 24 h, while conversion reached 98% over V x O y @g-C3N4 in 1 h with a selectivity of 99% under the same conditions. Further investigation indicated that the immobilization of VxOy on carbon nitride not only increases the photocatalytic activity but also provides the energy via visible-light absorption enhancement. Carbon-based materials are considered to be an ideal cheap non-metal cocatalyst and photocatalyst support because of their unique structure and excellent electrical conductivity. Yuan et al. [123] loaded TiO2 onto two types of graphene, i.e., solvent-exfoliated graphene (SEG) with lower defect density and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with higher defect density. The two cocatalysts both can improve the photocatalytic performance in the selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds in water to some extent. Fernandes and co-workers [124] successfully synthesized CNF/ZnO hybrid materials for the selective production of aromatic aldehydes from the respective alcohols, under irradiation of energy-efficient light sources (UV-LEDs) and mild temperature and pressure conditions. It was shown that the optimal photocatalyst was 10% CNF/ZnO in vanillyl alcohol oxidation. The role of CNF is to act as electron acceptor to decrease the recombination of photogenerated hole-electron pairs, thus enhancing both conversion and selectivity for vanillin formation. Although many different types of non-noble metal cocatalysts have been investigated for photocatalytic reactions, it is still challenging to find suitable low-price -metal cocatalyst which can be loaded onto stable oxide semiconductors for photocatalytic alcohol oxidation. Therefore, still more studies on cocatalyst deposition are needed."
6,Reaction condition adjusting,
7,Solvent adjusting,"4.1 Solvent adjusting As mentioned above, the products of the catalytic process have to desorb from the surface of the catalysts to recover the active sites. Thus, in most cases the solvent is necessary to dissolve the products and to decrease the accumulation of surface species. The solvents play a very important role in the reaction process because of the different interactions between the catalysts and the reactants/products in different solvents [125,126]. More importantly, the solvents also affect the reaction mechanism and the formed intermediates in the reaction mechanism [125,127–129]. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to improving photocatalytic activity and selectivity using different solvents to achieve a more complete use of solar energy [130,131]. For example, Farhadi and co-workers [132] screened many organic solvents such as n-hexane, CH3CN, CHCl3, Et2O, toluene, CH2ClCH2Cl, C6H6, cyclohexane and PhCl for the photocatalytic oxidation of benzhydrol over molecular iodine as catalyst in 2006. The experimental results showed that most of the solvents were suitable for the photo-oxidation reaction. Nevertheless, acetonitrile is the most commonly used solvent, because it is photochemically inert and it has a very high solubility for the alcoholic substrates. Furthermore, Farhadi’s group [133] investigated the influence of the solvent on the aerobic photocatalytic oxidation of 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol over POM/ZrO2, and acetonitrile was found to be the best solvent for this reaction probably because of its inertness. In addition, benzotrifluoride (BTF) has been widely studied as solvent, which can dissolve most organic compounds. Zhang et al. [134] investigated the photocatalytic oxidation of benzylic alcohols in BTF over flower-like Bi2WO6 under visible light irradiation. The resulting conversion of benzylic alcohols and the selectivity to the aldehydes were rather similar to those in water. The results indicate that although the solvent does not have a significant influence on the photocatalytic oxidation reaction itself, the differences in the oxidation mechanism can be attributed to the higher solubility of molecular oxygen in BTF compared with water, which leads to different photogenerated active species. However, the use of water as solvent is a more desirable from an environmental viewpoint. Zhang et al. [135] observed that the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over TiO2 in organic solvents such as BTF was dramatically different from that in water. The ESR trapping experiments showed that the main active oxidative species ·OH existing in aqueous system was not detected in BTF. Therefore, a much higher selectivity in BTF was observed. Other solvents have also been studied in the photo-oxidation of alcohols, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC) [131], ethyl acetate [134] and 1, 4-dioxane [130]. However, one of the largest challenges in alcohol oxidation catalysis is the development of non-toxic solvents. The ideal solvent from the viewpoint of green chemistry is water. Safaei and co-workers [136] explored the photocatalytic activity of nanohybrid Co-TCPP@TiO2/WO3 in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols in four solvents with different polarities: CH3CN, DMF, CH2Cl2 and water. The results showed that the best yield was reached in acetonitrile, while the lowest yield was obtained with water as solvent. Nevertheless, Mahyari et al. [137] evaluated the three solvents water, CH3CN, and CH2Cl2 in the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over iron (III) porphyrin supported on S and N co-doped graphene quantum dots. The results demonstrated that water significantly enhanced the yield and selectivity of benzyl alcohol oxidation. This observation indicates that there is no simple relationship between the polarity of solvents and the catalytic performance. Yu et al. [69] compared the partial oxidation ability of C/T-200 for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in DMC with the solvents BTF, CH3CN, toluene and water. The results showed that DMC is favorable for reaching higher photocatalytic performance. Xu’s group [62] found that ethyl acetate is an ideal solvent for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over PANI/FeUiO-66 with high selectivity and conversion. This result suggests that in such a catalytic system, selectivity does not rely on the selected solvent. In addition, Chen’s group [138] chose the solvents water, CH3CN, DMF, THF, toluene, DMSO, cyclohexane and dichloromethane to perform the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of n-octanol over Pt-loaded TiO2 in an inert atmosphere under UV light illumination. The results showed that polar solvents exhibited higher yields (78% in CH3CN) than nonpolar solvents (5% in toluene), indicating that the closer to the hydrophilic Pt − TiO2 surface the solvent is, the higher selectivity and conversion of n-octanol are. Liu et al. [139] tested the effect of solvents with different polarity on the selective conversion of (4-methoxyphenyl)-methanol to 4-methoxybenzaldehyde and H2 under visible-light irradiation over a Ru/SrTiO3: Rh photocatalyst. However, it was found that the polar solvents such as CH2Cl2 and CH3CN led to lower yields contrary to the previous conclusion. Imamura and coworkers [47] examined the effects of the amount of water dissolved in CH3CN on the simultaneous production of aromatic aldehydes and dihydrogen by the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol over Pt/TiO2. The results showed that the reaction rate drastically decreased in the presence of water, indicating that the adsorption of benzyl alcohol on the surface of TiO2 is competing with that of water. Thus, the main reason for the inhibition of the photocatalytic reaction is proposed to be the strong adsorption of water. It can be implied that the influence of solvents on the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols is not only related to their polarity, but also to the mutual interaction between the reactant, the solvent and the surface of the photocatalyst. In summary, it is concluded that the solvent effect on conversion and selectivity is complex for all photocatalytic reactions because of the different reaction pathways and the specific interactions between reactants, products and catalysts. Thus, more fundamental investigations are needed for a more general understanding."
8,Atmosphere adjusting,"4.2 Atmosphere adjusting Generally, the photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds can be divided into two types: the aerobic oxidation in O2/air, and the anaerobic dehydrogenation in N2/Ar. In aerobic photocatalytic alcohol oxidation, molecular oxygen usually captures the photoinduced electrons forming the superoxide radical, which contributes to the oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones [22–24,140–148]. In addition to superoxide radicals, photogenerated holes also play a significant role in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. However, in anaerobic photocatalytic alcohol oxidation, photo-generated holes are the main active species. On the one hand, under aerobic conditions, the generation of superoxide radicals can improve the reaction rate because of the improved separation of photogenerated electrons and holes [22–24,140–148]. On the other hand, under anaerobic conditions, photogenerated electrons can combine with protons to generate hydrogen, thus improving the economic benefits of the photo-reaction.[77] No matter in which condition, photo-generated holes play a vital role under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the oxidation of alcohols [25,27,46,107,109,115,120,124,146–151]. Su et al. [152] designed a mesoporous carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) polymer for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with > 99% selectivity and 57% conversion under visible-light irradiation for 3 h at 373 K using O2 (8 bar) in a closed autoclave. The photocatalytic system also works when oxygen is replaced by air, thus enabling aerobic oxidation of BA with 44% conversion and > 99% selectivity to benzaldehyde. When the reaction was carried out in the absence of oxygen, the degree of conversion of the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA was as low as 11% under standard conditions, however, with the selectivity to benzaldehyde still being higher than 99%. The experimental results and electron spin resonance (ESR) using the DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) spin trap technique illustrated that the oxygen concentration has a substantial influence on the catalytic reaction and that surface-mediated·O2 − plays a vital role in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. Electron transfer in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols over mpg-C3N4 is shown schematically in Fig. 10 . She et al. [46] prepared a novel synthesized photocatalyst (Ni-OTiO2) by doping nickel and introducing excess oxygen defect in TiO2 for the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of oxygen. Through conducting control experiments with different radical scavengers, it was shown that h+ and·O2 − have a strong influence on the photocatalytic reaction, while the effect of the ·OH radical was negligible. Ye et al. [151] synthesized Zn3In2S6 samples by a simple solvothermal method for the anaerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In this reaction aromatic alcohols are converted to the corresponding aldehydes and H+ by the photoexcited holes, and the released H+ is reduced to H2 by the photogenerated electrons. Accordingly, the molar ratios between aromatic aldehydes and hydrogen were close to 1: 1. Fig. 11 illustrates a possible reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and H2 evolution over Zn3In2S6 sample under light irradiation. In addition to these studies, many researchers have also demonstrated that photogenerated holes are the main active species in the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols in inert atmosphere [46,61,91,120]. Fig. 12. In conclusion, the comparative results under aerobic or anaerobic condition show that the atmosphere has different influence on photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols due to the different active species, reaction pathways and rate-determining step."
9,Elucidation of mechanisms,"Fundamental understanding of alcohol -photocatalyst interactions is essential to designing improved photocatalysts, which has been greatly assisted by advanced techniques such as adding scavengers, EPR spectroscopy, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."
10,Scavengers,"5.1 Scavengers Control experiments with scavengers are commonly conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism and verify the contribution of reactive species. Usually, different scavengers are added to the reaction system for capturing free radicals/intermediates, for example, benzoquinone (BQ) for ·O2 −, isopropanol (IPA) for ·OH, ammonium oxalate (AO) for photo-generated h+, and AgNO3 for photo-generated e-. She et al. [46] showed that h+ and ·O2 − have a strong influence on photocatalytic alcohol oxidation, while the effect of ·OH is negligible. It was also demonstrated by Li’s group [152] that ·O2 − and h+ were the main active species in benzyl alcohol oxidation over the Au/BiOCl photocatalyst. Lin et al. revealed that both photogenerated holes and electrons are consumed in the aerobic oxidation reaction, while hydroxyl radical shows negligible influence [148]. What’s more, Hu et al. [85] also conducted control experiments showing that photogenerated h+ played a dominant role during the anaerobic reaction process, while both e- and ·OH were not relevant, indicating that the absence of aggressive radical species led to the high selectivity of the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, similar to the reports by Zhao et al. [61]. Consequently, it is clear that photogenerated hole plays a dominant role during anaerobic alcohol oxidation process, while holes and ·O2 − both play a vital role under aerobic atmosphere. It is verified that the absence of hydroxyl radicals results in the high selectivity of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes or ketones."
11,EPR spectroscopy,"5.2 EPR spectroscopy To investigate the reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, EPR techniques are widely used to identify the location of unpaired electrons in the lattice of the semiconductor, the active species and the radical intermediates during the oxidation process. For the former, EPR is used to detect single electrons present in the oxygen vacancies or the fine structure in the catalyst lattice. For the latter, the spin trapping technique involves the addition of the reactive spin trapping agent to form a much more stable radical adduct which can be then detected by EPR. The most commonly used spin trapping agents are 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN). The free radicals such as ·OH, ·O2 − and ·OOH will combine with DMPO or PBN forming the corresponding radical adducts DMPO-OH/PBN-OH, DMPO-O2 −/PBN-O2 − and DMPO-OOH/PBN-OOH to be detected by EPR. Li et al. [153] observed a characteristic signal with a g factor near 2.001, which was assigned to electrons in oxygen vacancies (OVs) appearing on Au-BiOCl by low-temperature EPR. The presence of OVs is beneficial for the adsorption of reactant molecules and can substantially modify the optical properties of oxide materials. Moreover, comparative in situ EPR studies of BiOCl-OV, Au-BiOCl-OV under both aerobic and anaerobic condition were carried out. Six peaks attributed to carbon-centered radicals appeared, which were considered as key intermediates for photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation under most conditions. However, the EPR signal disappeared in the absence of O2 for BiOCl-OV. The results suggested that there seems exist a synergistic effect between plasmonic holes and hot electrons. Only when h+ and ·O2 − were both generated, a high selectivity can be achieved. Tao’s group [154] observed a strong signal of the superoxide radical and weak peaks of peroxide radicals (Fig. 11), which contributed to the oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes under aerobic conditions. A sextet of DMPO-carbon-radicals showed up, suggesting that a key intermediate was produced either by the photogenerated holes or the reactive oxygen species during benzyl alcohol oxidation. Song and co-workers [155] also applied in situ EPR spectroscopy using DMPO in the reaction system to identify intermediates, which showed that the generated ·O2 − radicals are strong oxidizing agents inducing alcohol dehydrogenation. Furthermore, EPR was also conducted for deeper understanding of the adsorption of cinnamyl alcohol on Cu-Cu2O/TNS. It was found that a chemical interaction between the alcohol and the photocatalyst resulted in the appearance of OVs. Also, Pavan et al. [156] added PBN as a spin trap. As shown in Fig. 13 , three types of carbon-centered radicals (benzoyloxyl, benzoyl and hydroxybenzyl radicals) were identified, implying that these stable intermediates were formed during the reaction. To be concluded, on one hand, Lewis acid sites like OVs on photocatalyst surface play a vital role during the oxidation of alcohol. The chemisorption of substrates on the active sites will enhance the activation of alcohol molecules to form carbon radicals which is a key intermediate in the reaction; on the other hand, O2 − is an important intermediate for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. Last but not least, to avoid the formation of ·OH is of significant importance to obtain high selectivity."
12,DRIFTS,"5.3 DRIFTS Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is a well-established technique which is often used to analyze the adsorption behavior of photocatalysts and the various reaction mechanisms. In situ DRIFTS was applied by Zhao et al. [61] to Rh-STO-600 and Rh-STO-900 photocatalysts using isopropanol (IPA) as a probe molecule at room temperature to elucidate the alcohol oxidation mechanism. The emerging bands indicated that IPA was adsorbed both molecularly and dissociatively on Lewis acid sites such as the surface OVs present on the photocatalysts. In addition, the trace amount of formed acetone over Rh-STO-600 suggested that enriched oxygen vacancies facilitate the cleavage of the α-C–H bond in the IPA molecule in agreement with the resulting higher photocatalytic oxidation activity over Rh-STO-600 than over Rh-STO-900. Hu et al. [85] also investigated the oxidation mechanism by in situ DRIFTS using 2-propanol as probe molecule. As shown in Fig. 14 , when increasing the IPA pressure from 0.001 mbar to 0.1 mbar, the intensity ratio of the band at 1128 cm−1 to that at 2972 cm−1 changed, which represents the percentage of chemisorbed IPA on STO and Fe-STO samples. The results indicated that chemisorption was clearly more favored on Fe-doped STO due to its defective structure. Moreover, the chemisorbed isopropoxy species was found to be an important intermediate subsequent the efficient adsorption and activation of the α-C–H bonds. Gu et al. [157] derived the adsorption mode of 2-propanol on the TiO2 surface based on FTIR results: chemisorbed 2-propanol and water coexisted in the first layer on the photocatalyst, while the physisorbed molecules were present in the second layer. It was shown that both the OH groups of the TiO2 surface and of the alcohol molecule served as anchors for chemisorption, favoring the further oxidation of 2-propanol. FTIR spectroscopy carried out by Li and co-workers [153] revealed that the characteristic O–H band disappeared while the C-O band was strengthened when benzyl alcohol was adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface. This observation suggested that the adsorption of benzyl alcohol proceeded via deprotonation to the alkoxide intermediate and surface-bound water due the high amount of surface OH groups present on BiOCl. In situ FTIR spectra of cinnamyl alcohol adsorption were also studied by Song and co-workers [155]. The results demonstrated that the surface Lewis acid sites were responsible for the adsorption of the OH groups of the alcohol molecules via chemical coordination. Therefore, the concentration of surface active sites may be the key factor that affects the chemisorption of alcohol, thus affecting the photocatalytic alcohol conversion [158]. To be brief, the studies on the surface interaction via DRIFTS indicated that the chemisorption of alcohol molecules on photocatalyst surface active sites is favorable for the dehydrogenation process, resulting in the boosting transformation of alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes or ketones."
13,Conclusions and perspectives,"Selective photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols can be efficiently carried out under mild conditions utilizing solar energy. The oxidation ability of photocatalysts can be regulated through the engineering of band edge positions and by surface modification, resulting in very high selectivity to the target products. Recent efforts identified cocatalyst loading as an effective strategy for efficient alcohol transformations, offering better catalytic performance and higher utilization efficiency of solar energy. Furthermore, the influence of the photocatalytic reaction conditions was analyzed in depth. EPR and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy and control experiments with scavengers were found to be particularly useful methods for identifying intermediates, active sites and reactive species responsible for the photocatalytic oxidation as well as revealing the mechanisms. However, more efforts are expected to improve the efficiency of photo-oxidation reactions and to expand their scope: i) To date, most studies were limited to aromatic alcohols, whereas the oxidation of aliphatic alcohols is still rarely investigated. Moreover, the development of novel heterogeneous photocatalysts with considerable activity, high reaction selectivity for alcohol oxidation and stability is of high relevance; ii) The mechanisms of photocatalytic alcohol oxidation are not fully understood, especially with respect to the activation of C–H bonds by novel photocatalysts like MOFs and carbon nitrides, as well as the solvent impact; iii) The crucial role of cocatalysts in photo-oxidation should be further investigated. In addition, noble metals are the most common used cocatalysts in alcohol oxidation, requiring the development of cost-efficient cocatalysts; iv) The quantum efficiency is rather low in visible light for most of the existing photocatalysts. Thus, expanding the photo-response to the NIR light region is to be investigated; v) More heterojunctions are needed explored such the Type I, and Z-scheme heterojunction for the efficient alcohol oxidation and light utilization; vi) In parallel, efficient, highly stable and cost-efficient photocatalysts are important for industrial application, but with limited progress up to now. In conclusion, photocatalytic oxidation is still rather challenging, and extensive research efforts should be devoted to searching for low-cost and robust artificial photocatalysts and to understanding the underlying chemical processes resulting in efficient photocatalytic reaction systems with high selectivity."
