0,Introduction,"Non-petroleum carbon resources such as coal, nature gas, shale gas, biomass or organic waste can be converted into clean liquid fuels and high value-added chemicals via syngas conversion route [1–3]. In the past several years, great successes have been achieved for direct syngas conversion to hydrocarbons including fuels [4], olefins [5–8] and aromatics [9,10] with high selectivity. Compared with hydrocarbons, synthesis of higher oxygenates (defined as linear alcohols or aldehydes with two or more carbon atoms, C2+OH) with partial retention of CO functional groups possesses higher degree of atomic utilization and has aroused widespread attention in both academy and industry [11–17]. This process is also known as higher alcohols synthesis (HAS). The as-obtained oxygenates from HAS process can be employed as fuels, fuel additives, feedstock for the production of paints, coatings, adhesives or as vital intermediate to produce pharmaceuticals, detergents, plasticizers and lubricants [12]. Among various types of HAS catalyst categories, the modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts attracted most attention due to their promising catalytic performance to synthesize C2+OH [2,12]. Typically, dual active sites are required [18,19], in which one site (i.e. Co0, FexC) functions for CO dissociation adsorption and formation of alkyl species, while the other site (i.e., Cu, Co2C, Coδ+) is in charge of CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion into alkyl species to form oxygenates. The tuning of synergistic effect between dual active sites is challenging due to the requirement of CC coupling as well as remaining some of the CO bonds simultaneously. In addition, the alkyl species tend to be hydrogenated to hydrocarbons instead of coupling with CO* intermediates to oxygenates, resulting in relative low yield and selectivity to higher alcohols [11,12]. It is very attractive but remains challenging to strengthen CO insertion rate through careful catalyst design and regulation of reaction network. In order to increase the selectivity to higher oxygenates during HAS process, a common strategy is to modulate the ratio of dual active sites [20–23] or tailor the interface structure of catalyst surface [17,24–26]. Another effective way is to increase the ratio of non-dissociative CO-relative species to alkyl species [12], i.e., increasing the CHxO* intermediate species concentration [11,26,27]. For example, Lebarbier et al. [20] observed a strong correlation between oxygenates selectivity and the ratio of Co/Co2C over a La-promoted Co/AC catalyst. By improving the vicinity of Cu and Fe, the rate for CO insertion into growing hydrocarbon chains would be intensified, and the oxygenates can be preferential produced according to the work of Luk et al. [28]. Recently, Li et al. [17] reported that the density of Cu-Fe5C2 interface sites can be largely enhanced by optimizing the ratio of Cu and Fe over a CuFeMn-layered double hydroxide catalyst, which exhibited a selectivity of 14.8 mol% for long-chain alcohols. Zhao et al. [25] designed a Co@Co2C nano-structure based on Mn-promoted Co/AC model catalyst for direct synthesis of higher alcohols and the maximum selectivity to alcohols and olefins reached ∼60 %. The Co-Co2C interface catalysts derived from CoMn-based oxides were also investigated in our previous works [29–31]. However, it is still very hard to achieve both high catalytic activity and high oxygenates selectivity, which may be attributed to the insufficient ability for CO activation, especially for CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion function. Recently, the reaction-coupling strategy on multifunctional relay catalysts has been successfully employed in oxygenates formation during syngas conversion [13,27,32], and it is also very interesting to find that a large fraction of olefins slates was co-produced over Co2C-contained HAS catalysts [11,23,25,26,29]. According to the CO insertion mechanism for HAS, the unsaturated alkyl species are one of the most important intermediates for oxygenates formation [12]. Inspired by the idea of relay catalysis, it is possible to further raise the oxygenates selectivity if the olefins slates can be in-situ converted with syngas through hydroformylation route. Moreover, as the traditional HAS process and hydroformylation reactions both require enhanced CO insertion ability to achieve high oxygenates selectivity, the introduction of alternative active site with function for hydroformylation reaction may be an efficient strategy to intensify CO insertion rate for HAS. Herein, we developed an effectively strategy to strengthen CO insertion function under the premise of retaining the Co2C/Co dual sites, which is realized through doping Rh or Ru species into CoMn oxides. The fabrication of Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn produced three types of synergistic active sites including Co0, Co2C and highly dispersed Rhδ+ (or Ruδ+) species, in which the Co0 species are mainly responsible for CO dissociative adsorption and carbon chain growth, while Co2C and highly dispersed Rhδ+ (or Ruδ+) species benefit the non-dissociative CO adsorption and subsequent insertion to generate C2+OH. In addition, the presence of Rhδ+ (or Ruδ+) species can tune the local chemical environment of surface catalyst, and induce the relay coupling of olefins with syngas to produce extra oxygenates, thus exhibiting outstanding activity and high selectivity for higher oxygenates along with low methane selectivity during CO hydrogenation process. The rationale for the enhanced HAS performance was also investigated in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The trimetallic Ru-CoMn was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Typically, 1 M mixed metal salt solution of RuCl3∙xH2O, Co(NO3)2∙6H2O, 50 % Mn(NO3)2 and 2 M NaCO3 solution were simultaneously precipitation method. Typically, 1 M mixed metal salt solution of RuCl3∙xH2O, Co(NO3)2∙6H2O, 50 % Mn(NO3)2 and 2 M NaCO3 solution were simultaneously dropped into a beaker contained 100 mL deionized water with vigorous stirring for 2 h at 25 °C. The pH was maintained at 8.0 ± 0.2. After that, the suspension was centrifuged and washed for six times with deionized water, and then dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Finally, the samples were calcined at 330 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace under static air. The prepared trimetallic Ru-CoMn catalysts were donated as xRu-CoMn, where x means the actual content of Ru measured by ICP-OES, and the Co/Mn molar ratio for all CoMn-based catalysts was kept at 1. The ternary Rh-CoMn catalysts and the bimetallic catalysts (CoMn, RuCo and RuMn) were prepared under the similar preparation procedure as described above, and the RhCl3∙3H2O was used as Rh salt."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder XRD measurement was performed on Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray power diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the scanning range of 5°-90°. The identification of the phases was based on the JCPDS standard card. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) characterization was conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem- II 2920 instrument equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and an MKS Cirrus 2 mass spectrometer (MS). 50 mg sample was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube, and the catalyst was pretreated with He at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 150 °C for 2 h. Once the TCD signal was stable at 50 °C, the gas stream was switched to 5 vol% H2/Ar with 30 mL min−1, and then the temperature was raised from 60 °C to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The TCD signal and mass signal (m/z = 2, 18, 44) was recorded. The elements analysis was performed on inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer) after determining the external standard curve with at least four different concentrations of metal standard solution. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with the Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation source. All the binding energy was corrected by 284.8 eV of C1s peak. The morphology and lattice fringe of phase for various samples was measured on transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a JEOL-JEM 2011 electron microscope which employing 200 kV accelerating voltage. Samples were dissolved in ethanol by ultrasonication and then one droplet of the dispersion was dropped on carbon-coated Cu grids for test. The Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of samples were carried out on a FEI-Tecnai G2 microscope with 300 kV accelerating voltage. High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping analysis and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) test were performed under STEM mode. To characterize the reduced samples, the catalysts were firstly reduced in a quartz tube (Φinner = 8 mm) with 10 vol% syngas/N2 (H2/CO = 0.5) at 300 °C for 5 h and then passivated with 1 vol% O2/Ar for 1 h. In-situ diffuse reflectance FIIR spectroscopy (In-situ DRIFTS) experiments were carried out on a Thermo FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet IS50) equipped with an MTC detector. The spectra in the range of 4000–900 cm−1 with resolution of 4 cm−1 and 64 scans per spectrum was recorded. Prior to each test, about 60 mg of catalysts was firstly loaded into the DRIFTS cell, and then the cell was vacuumed for 30 min at 150 °C to remove water and possible impurities species adhered to the sample surface. Subsequently, the cell temperature was cooled down to 50 °C, and the background spectrum was recorded. After that, 10 mL min−1 CO with 7.5 mL min−1 Ar) was introduced into the cell, and the series spectra were continuously recorded with pressure increasing to 2 bar (about 39 s per spectrum), then the pressure was dropped to atmospheric pressure without changing the gas flow for adsorption treatment for 20 min. Lastly, the cell was vacuumed again to exclude the extra gas, and the DRIFTS spectra of chemisorbed CO species were obtained. CO-TPD and C3H6-TPD experiments were implemented with a Micromeritics ChemSorb 2920. Taking CO-TPD as an example, prior to the adsorption, 50 mg sample was firstly purged with a flow of 30 mL mL−1 pure He at 250 °C for 1 h to remove the surface physiosorbed species, and then the CO adsorption was carried out in a flow of 5 vol% CO/Ar with 30 mL min−1 for 2 h after cooling to 50 °C. After the full adsorption, the pure He flow with 30 mL min−1 was introduced into the systems to remove the gas CO until the baseline of CO or C3H6 signal leveled off. Finally, the temperature was increased to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and the MS signal (m/z) of 28 or 42 was monitored by a mass spectrometer. The quantification of surface carbon species on catalyst surface was assessed with a Thermo DXR2xi Raman imaging microscope equipped with a TILON LC-D200 M mass spectrometer. About 20 mg samples were loaded into the Raman cell and a flow of Ar with 30 mL min−1 was introduced into the instrument. The temperature was then raised to 300 °C, and the gas stream was switched to 50 vol% syngas/Ar (5 mL min−1 H2, 10 mL min−1 CO, 15 mL min−1 Ar) for 1 h of reduction treatment under 300 °C. The Raman spectrum was real-time monitored. After reduction, the temperature was increased to 400 °C and the gas stream was switched to 50 vol% H2/Ar (15 mL min−1 H2, 15 mL min−1 Ar). The concentration of carbon species on catalyst surface was determined by monitoring the effluent for methane (m/z = 16) using TILON LC-D200 M mass spectrometer."
4,Catalytic reaction test,"2.3 Catalytic reaction test Typically, catalysts were tested in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor consisting of a stainless-steel reaction tube (Φinner = 10 mm) equipped with an inserted stainless-steel sleeve to monitor the reaction temperature in real time. About 1.5 g catalyst (40–60 mesh) diluted with 3.0 g quartz sand (40–60 mesh) was placed in the constant temperature zone of the reactor. Before reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated in situ at 300 °C for 5 h with 10 vol% syngas/N2 (H2/CO = 0.5), 8000 mL g−1 h−1 and atmospheric pressure followed by carburization at 250 °C for 24 h in a flow of syngas (H2/CO/N2 = 48.5/48.5/3) with WHSV of 2000 mL g-1 h-1 at the atmospheric pressure. After finishing carburization, the temperature was cooled down to 180 °C, and the reaction system was pressured to 6.0 MPa, then the temperature was raised to 220 °C. The flow rate of syngas was regulated by a mass flowmeter to provide WHSV of 1000−4000 mL g−1 h−1. After passing through a hot trap (120 °C) and a cold trap (0 °C), the effluent gas was on-line analyzed by Agilent 7890B apparatus equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The products were analyzed off-line by Shimadzu GC. More detailed chromatographic parameters and analytical information could be found in our previous reports [11]. The typical GC graphs of gas phase, aqueous phase, oil phase and wax phase were shown in Fig. S1∼3. CO conversion and products selectivity after 24 h of stabilization were typically used for discussion. The mass balance, carbon balance and oxygen balance were kept at 100 ± 5 %. Three repeat experiments under the same reaction conditions suggested that the studied catalyst shows excellent reproducibility. As for hydroformylation probe experiment, the following procedure was adopted: 0.5 g catalysts (40–60 mesh) diluted with 4.0 g quartz sand (40–60 mesh) was placed in a fixed-bed stainless steel plug-flow reactor with an 8 mm inner diameter. The sample was in-situ reduced in10 vol% CO/N2 with WHSV of 8000 mL g−1 h−1 at 300 °C for 5 h at the atmospheric pressure followed by carburization in syngas (H2/CO = 1) flow at 250 °C for 24 h with 4000 mL g−1 h−1. Subsequently, the reaction temperature was cooled down to 220 °C and the pressure was raised to 2.5 MPa without changing the gas atmosphere. After 24 h of reaction, the flow of ethylene was introduced into the reaction system for ethylene hydroformylation test. The volumetric ratio of H2:CO:C2H4 was kept at 1:1:1. The effluent products were on-line analyzed by an Agilent 7890B apparatus. A HP Plot Q capillary column and an FID with He as carrier gas was used to analyzed the hydrocarbons and oxygenates. A carbon molecular sieves column (TDX-1) with a TCD using He as the carrier gas was used to analyze H2, N2, CO, CH4 and CO2. The CO conversion obtained under stable reaction conditions was calculated based on carbon atoms as the following Eq. (1). C O C o n v e r s i o n = C O i n l e t - C O o u t l e t C O i n l e t × 100 % Where COinlet and COoutlet represent the moles of CO in the inlet and outlet, respectively. The CO2 selectivity( S C O 2 ) was calculated as following eq (2). C O 2 S e l e c t i v i t y = C O 2 o u t l e t C O i n l e t - C O o u t l e t × 100 % Where CO2 outlet represents the moles of CO in the outlet. The selectivity of individual oxygenates or hydrocarbon products (Si) were calculated as C atom % on a CO2-free basis and expressed as following eq (3). S i = C i × n i ∑ ( C i × n i ) × 100 % Where Ci represents the mole fraction of product i (oxygenates or hydrocarbons), and ni represents the carbon number of product i. The chain-growth probability (α) of product was calculated according to the equation: ln ( W ni n ) = nln α +ln ( 1 − α ) 2 α Where n represent the carbon number of product i, Wni represents the mass fraction of product i."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Catalytic results,"3.1 Catalytic results The catalytic performance for syngas conversion over various catalysts was evaluated as showed in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . For the CoMn bimetallic oxide, CO conversion and oxygenates selectivity were only 13.7 % and 23.1 %, respectively. However, when a trace amount of Rh was introduced into the CoMn catalytic system, the catalytic performance was greatly improved. For the case of 0.3Rh-CoMn, CO conversion and oxygenates selectivity ramped to 29.5 % and 35.5 %, respectively. The CH4 selectivity significantly dropped to 6.1 %. With the increase of Rh content, CO conversion and oxygenates selectivity for 1.1Rh-CoMn catalyst increased to 33.1 % and 40.9 %, respectively, without sacrificing the fraction of C2+OH in oxygenates distribution (>95 %). As far as mass-specific activity was concerned, the 1.1Rh-CoMn catalyst exhibited high activity of 48.4 mmolCO gCo −1 h−1, which was about 2.6-fold higher than that of CoMn (Fig. 1a). The space-time-yield (STY) for C2+OH (67.9 mg gcat −1 h−1) also showed four times higher than that of CoMn (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, the selectivity to undesired paraffins significantly decreased from 54.4 % to 31.7 %, among which the fraction of CH4 was far below that of CoMn counterpart. It seemed that the formation rate of olefins was accelerated, and the sum selectivity to high-value added chemicals including oxygenates and olefins was also improved and reached nearly 70 % for Rh-CoMn catalyst, while that of CoMn was only 45.6 %. The as-obtained catalytic performance of the current Rh-CoMn can compete with the state-of-the-art HAS catalysts (Table S1). When Rh was replaced with Ru, which cost is much lower than Rh, the as-obtained Ru-CoMn also exhibited similar trend for catalytic performance. Once a small quantity of Ru (i.e.,0.3 %) was added, CO conversion was significantly improved (13.7 %→32.6 %), and the oxygenates selectivity increased with increasing the content of Ru and achieved 42.9 % for 2.1Ru-CoMn. CH4 selectivity also decreased with the addition of Ru component. Apparently, the Ru concentration played a vital role in catalytic behavior of Ru-CoMn, and the highest activity and STY of oxygenates and C2+OH were simultaneously obtained at a Ru concentration of 0.7 % (Fig. S4). In addition, the sum selectivity to high-value added chemicals also reached the maximum (72.3 %), while remaining the lowest fraction of CH4. Since CO2 selectivity remained at around 20∼30 % for these studied catalysts, a H2-lean syngas feedstock such as H2/CO = 1 was most suitable for this reaction. To elucidate the role of each active component, the catalytic behaviors of RuMn and RuCo were specially investigated. The RuMn alone without Co showed extremely poor activity with high CO2 selectivity (39.0 %) and high CH4 selectivity (15.9 %) as well as very low productivity of C2+OH (0.6 mg gcat −1 h−1). The RuCo catalyst without Mn exhibited the highest CH4 selectivity (32.1 %) and relative low oxygenates selectivity. Furthermore, the influence of integration manner of CoMn and RuMn was also studied in detail (Fig. 1c). When CoMn was packed above the RuMn and separated by a layer of quartz wool (dual-bed configuration, CoMn//RuMn), the CO conversion was similar to that of CoMn, while a little higher oxygenates selectivity (28.9 % vs 23.1 %) was obtained. If CoMn was placed in the downstream (dual-bed configuration, RuMn//CoMn), the CO2 selectivity increased to 30.9 % and the oxygenates selectivity decreased to 20.9 %. In addition, the granule stacking configuration (CoMn|RuMn) exhibited similar catalytic performance as that of CoMn//RuMn. It seemed that the formation rate of oxygenated products could be promoted once the products flow of CoMn passing through the RuMn particles. The 2.1Ru-CoMn catalyst prepared by co-precipitation showed more close contact of each active component including Ru, Co and Mn (Fig. S5) and exhibited the best catalytic performance in terms of CO conversion and oxygenates selectivity. The studies of interaction manner strongly suggested that the close contact and synergistic effect between different active metal sites exert profound influence on the catalytic behavior of CO hydrogenation, and these comparison results also suggested that the components of Ru, Co and Mn are essential prerequisite to guarantee the superior catalytic performance for HAS. The effect of reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), reaction pressure and H2/CO ratio for 2.1Ru-CoMn catalysts were further investigated. As shown in Fig. 2 a, increasing temperature from 210 °C to 230 °C would cause the increase in CO conversion, CO2 selectivity and CH4 selectivity. The catalytic activity and STY of oxygenates (ROH), C2+OH and olefins also presented increasing trend (Fig. 2b). For example, the STY of C2+OH correspondingly increased from 36.4 mg gcat −1 h−1 at 210 °C to 51.8 mg gcat −1 h−1 at 230 °C. It is interesting to find that the selectivity to oxygenates and olefins changed slightly and the sum selectivity to high-value added chemicals kept in the range of 65 %–70 %. In addition, increasing WHSV from 1000 to 4000 mL gcat −1 h−1 caused the decrease in CO conversion but increased the CO activity from 24.6 to 43.5 mL gcat −1 h−1. Besides, a significant increase in the STY of oxygenates, C2+OH and olefins was also observed in Fig. 2d, suggesting that a higher WHSV benefited the CO conversion rate and oxygenates & olefins formation. Another striking phenomenon is that the production of CO2 and CH4 was greatly suppressed as increasing WHSV. CO2 selectivity decreased from 36.5 % for 1000 mL g−1 h−1 to 11.1 % for 4000 mL g−1 h−1, while CH4 selectivity decreased by 50 %. This result is different from a recent report about CoxMn/AC catalyst for HAS [25], which shows that the STY of oxygenates would be hindered under a higher WHSV. The above results suggested a strong signal that there may exist multiple active sites for the studied catalyst. We speculated that high WHSV can promote the desorption of olefins intermediates from one of specific active sites. The olefins intermediates then quickly diffuse to adjacent actives site to undergo some reaction to form oxygenates. It is most possible that olefins hydroformylation reaction may occur during this process, thus boosting CO reaction rate and oxygenates formation rate. As for the influence of reaction pressure, it can be seen that the increase of pressure increased CO conversion and favored the production of oxygenates while sacrificing olefins selectivity. The formation of CH4 was also greatly suppressed as increasing reaction pressure, and CO2 selectivity and hydrocarbons fraction remained almost unchanged. Surprisingly, the sum selectivity to high-value added chemical (olefins & oxygenates) was independence of reaction pressure and remained at around 70 %, indicating that the olefins intermediates may be converted into oxygenated products. Finally, the effect of H2/CO ratio was also investigated (Fig. 2g–h), and it was found that a better results in terms of selectivity and STY of alcohols could be obtained when syngas with H2/CO = 1 was used. The detailed distribution of oxygenates and hydrocarbons as well as the corresponding chain-growth probability (α) are investigated as displayed in Fig. S6 and Fig. 3 (a and b). The CoMn showed high fraction of C5+OH. However, the addition of Rh or Ru would shift the products to light components mainly dominated by lower oxygenates (C2OH∼C4OH). Interestingly, the fraction of lower olefins (C2−4 =) in olefins distribution was also greatly improved, which increased from 36.3 % for CoMn to 68.0 % for 0.7Ru-CoMn. As for paraffins, the slate of C1 and C5+ were significantly suppressed. The α values for both oxygenates and hydrocarbons significantly decreased for Rh- or Ru-CoMn (Fig. 3(a and b)). The ASF plot of oxygenates revealed negative deviations for C1∼C3 slate, and a strictly linear distribution was observed from C4 onward, which is in agreement with literature report [16]. It should be noted that the C3 slate showed the maximum deviation, especially for the sole CoMn catalyst. It can be illustrated from CO insertion mechanism that the C2Hx* alkyl species are the vital intermediate for the formation of C3 oxygenates. As the C2Hx* alkyl species are more likely to being re-adsorbed and participating in the chain-growth reaction, the surface concentration of C2Hx* species was low. Therefore, the C2 slate in hydrocarbons (Fig. 3a) and C3 slate in oxygenates (Fig. 3b) showed great deviation from the classical ASF distribution. With the introducing Rh- or Ru- to CoMn, the ASF gap of C3 oxygenates was gradually filled, indicating that the formation of C3 oxygenates was intensified. In other words, the adsorbed C2Hx* species are converted to C3 oxygenates in a larger fraction over Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn, providing a strong signal for the occurrence of hydroformylation reaction. In addition, both the ratio of αoxygenates to αhydrocarbons and selectivity ratio of oxygenates to hydrocarbons were greatly improved (Fig. 3c). For example, the ratio of αoxygenates to αhydrocarbons for CoMn was 0.85, while that ramped to 0.93 for 1.1Rh-CoMn, and 0.91 for 0.7Ru-CoMn. These results strongly confirmed that the kinetic rate of CO insertion was strengthened, whereas that of alkyl species hydrogenation was suppressed."
7,Structural characterization,"3.2 Structural characterization XRD profiles in Fig. 4 a suggested that the MnCo2O4.5 composite oxides existed for all calcinated samples, which is in line with previous reports [7,11,33]. No phases ascribed to Rh or Ru species could be detected due to the low loading amount with high dispersion. After pre-treatment under 10 % syngas, CoxMn1-xO composite oxide with low valence was observed (Fig. 4b) and it is the vital intermediates for the formation of Co2C [7,34,35]. It is worth noting that the characteristic peaks ascribing to Co2C only appeared in Rh-CoMn and Ru-CoMn samples, indicating that the doping of Rh or Ru promoted the carburization of Co species and favored the formation of Co2C during pre-treatment process. After reaction, a mixture of fcc Co0 and Co2C were identified for all of CoMn, Rh-CoMn and Ru-CoMn samples, while no peaks ascribing to Rh or Ru species could be observed. In addition, the phase of MnCO3 was also detected. To reveal the role of Rh or Ru during pre-treatment process, H2-TPR of various samples was performed (Fig. 4d). Three reduction peaks centered at 207 °C, 347 °C and 440 °C were detected for CoMn catalyst. The reduction peak locating at 207 °C might be attributed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and Mn3+ to Mn2+ in high-valence CoMn composite oxide [29,36]. The peak at 347 °C was probably attributed to the further reduction of Co2+ to Co0. It is reported that the Mn could hinder the reduction of cobalt in CoMn composite oxides [36,37], thus the broad peak at high temperature of 440 °C possibly belonged to the reduction of Coδ+ to Co0 from lower valence CoxMn1-xO [36]. Comparing with CoMn counterpart, no differences in reduction peak types were observed for Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn. However, the central position for reduction peak changed significantly. Obviously, the doping of Rh or Ru can greatly decrease the reduction temperature mainly due to the H2 spillover effect [38,39], and a much lower temperature was required as increasing content of Rh or Ru. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) upon CO adsorption was further carried out to compare the differences in CO activation behaviors for various samples. As shown in Fig. 5 , only CO gas peaks at around 2171 and 2116 cm−1 was observed for CoMn [33], and no chemisorption peaks attributed to CO can be detected after vacuum desorption (Fig. 5a, insert graph). Three peaks locating at 2170, 2082 and 2012 cm−1 emerged after CO adsorption for Rh-CoMn (Fig. 3b, insert graph). With the increase of CO pressure, the characteristic peaks intensity ascribing to asymmetric stretch Rh(CO)2 species (ca. 2012 cm−1) and linear Rh-CO species (ca. 2082 cm−1) obviously increased [40,41]. Besides, neither red-shift for linear Rh-CO nor bridged Rh-CO species at about 1840 cm−1 were observed, indicating the existence of single dispersed Rh atoms [40,41]. As For Ru-CoMn in Fig. 5c, the peak at 2053 cm−1 was assigned to linear Ru-CO species, and the band at 1837 cm−1 was characteristic of bridge-bonded CO on Ruδ+ site [42,43]. Red-shift phenomenon was observed for the CO stretching frequency (2015 cm−1 → 2011 cm−1) as increasing CO pressure. The DRIFTS spectra results suggested that different samples showed different CO activation behavior, and the Rh- or Ru- promoted catalysts exhibited much stronger CO adsorption capacity than that of CoMn. To further demonstrate this point, we assessed and compared the relative concentration of surface carbon species during pre-treatment process by the quantity of methanated carbon [44] (Fig. 5d). Remarkably, the surface carbon species concentration of 1.1Rh-CoMn was almost 14.2 times that of CoMn, while 3.6-fold was observed for 0.7-RuCoMn. These results strongly suggested that the doping of Rh or Ru can significantly benefit the CO activation and simultaneously favor the reduction and carburization of Co species. Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra of Ru-CoMn with different Ru contents. It can be seen that the Co 2p XPS spectra of fresh catalysts exhibited characteristic peaks at 780.3 eV and 781.6 eV, assigning to Co3+ and Co2+ [25], respectively. After pre-treatment, the positive valence state of Co was remained. However, the peak area ratio of Co2+/Co3+ increased significantly. Both metal Co0 (777.7 eV) [45] and Co2+ (781.3 eV) existed simultaneously in all spent catalysts. As for the Ru species, the intensity of Ru increased with increasing Ru content, and the oxidized Ru species (Ruδ+, ca. 463.2 ∼ 463.9 eV) [46,47] was identified for fresh, reduced and spent samples, suggesting that Ru species could maintain a highly dispersed oxidation state under the reaction conditions. Fig. 7 presents the Co 2p and Rh 3d 5/2 spectra of Rh-CoMn catalysts at different stages. The peaks located at 780.2 eV and 782.3 eV in fresh Rh-CoMn were assigned to Co3+ and Co2+, respectively. After pre-treatment under 10 % H2/CO (H2/CO = 0.5), the Co species maintained a positive valence state. However, the 1.1Rh-CoMn mainly showed the existence of Co2+, while Co3+ was still observed for 0.3Rh-CoMn, suggesting that the Rh can promote the reduction of Co species and this promotional effect was enhanced as increasing Rh concentration. These results are consistent with the H2-TPR results. After reaction, both Co0 and Co2+ were detected in all spent Rh-CoMn samples. For Rh species, the chemical state of Rh in fresh sample was attributed to Rh3+ (309 ∼ 309.3 eV) [40,41]. After reduction, both Rh3+ and Rh+ (308 eV) [41] were detected. For the spent samples, the Rhδ+ (0 < δ < 1) with slightly positively charged state at ca. 307.2 eV was observed [40], suggesting that the Rh species was slightly further reduced during CO hydrogenation process. In addition, we fitted and deconvoluted the peaks of Co 2p to roughly estimate the ratio of Co2+/(Co0+Co2+) in all spent samples, and the results in Table S2 showed that the content of surface Co2+ species for all Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn catalysts was always higher than that of CoMn, indicating that the Rh or Ru would promote the existence of Co in the form of positive chemical state. To investigate the crystalline structure of active species for reduced and spent catalysts, the samples were submitted to HRTEM characterization. As shown in Fig. S7, CoxMn1-xO was observed for all of reduced samples, while Co2C with lattice fringes of 2.17 Å and 2.43 Å was only detected for Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn. After reaction, the face-centered cubic (fcc) Co with lattice fringes of 1.77 Å or 2.04 Å existed in all of spent samples as shown in Fig. 8 (a–c). The d-spacing of 2.43 Å, 2.12 Å was attributed to Co2C (101) and Co2C (111), respectively. That is to say, a mixture of metallic Co and Co2C coexisted for the spent CoMn, Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn catalysts. In addition, sphere-like Co2C nanostructures were most observed. Previous work has demonstrated that the Co2C nanoprisms would gradually change from nanoprisms to nanospheres as increasing reaction pressure, and the product distribution correspondingly changed from typical FTO region to HAS region [30]. We further investigated the spatial distribution of each component for various fresh and spent samples by HAADF-STEM-EDS. As shown in Fig. S8, the EDX mapping of fresh 1.1RhCoMn and 0.7Ru-CoMn verified the uniform distribution of each element, and Rh or Ru species was highly dispersed. After reaction, the cobalt phase nanoparticles (red color) were randomly distributed with slightly local agglomeration, while the segregation of Mn phase (aqua color) with Co phase was clearly observed. The Mn phase mainly existed in the form of large particle, especially for the Ru-CoMn sample. In addition, the Fig. 8(d, e, f and g) indicated that Rh (gold color) or Ru (green color) was still uniformly distributed over the catalyst surface after undergoing sever reaction, and this highly dispersed state guaranteed the intimate contact with Co0 or Co2C or Mn phase, which might induce multiple active interface and facilitate the formation of oxygenated products. In fact, a lot of studies have disclosed that the formation of metal-metal [39] or metal-carbide [48] or metal-metal oxides [49] interface can produce remarkable promotional effect for catalytic performance during syngas conversion process."
8,Hydroformylation probe experiment,"3.3 Hydroformylation probe experiment The above studies strongly suggested that the olefins hydroformylation reaction occurred over the studied Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn catalysts, in which the olefins were firstly produced through syngas conversion, and then continuously underwent “relay coupling” with syngas to produce oxygenates. To prove the possible hydroformylation performance over the spent Rh- or Ru-based catalysts, probe experiment was specially designed. Before doing this, CO-TPD and propene-TPD over the spent catalysts were firstly carried out. As shown in Fig. 9 (a and b), a much stronger signal intensity for CO or C3H6 after desorption was observed for 0.7Ru-CoMn and 1.1Rh-CoMn than that of CoMn. We fitted, calculated and compared the peak area ratio and found that the CO peak area ratio of Rh-CoMn to CoMn (R1) reached 1.2, while that of Ru-CoMn to CoMn (R2) was as high as 1.5. C3H6-TPD experiment confirmed that the propene is prone to adsorb on Rh-CoMn and Ru-CoMn with R value reached 1.8 and 3.0, respectively. Obviously, the TPD results demonstrated that the CO and olefins species are readily adsorbed and activated on Rh- or Ru-promoted catalysts. We further performed ethylene hydroformylation on the spent Rh-CoMn, Ru-CoMn and RuMn at 220 °C, 2.5 MPa, 4000 mL g−1 h−1 and H2/CO/C2H4 = 1:1:1. As shown in Fig. 9c, CO conversion over both 0.7Ru-CoMn and 1.1Rh-CoMn was above 30 %. In addition, ROH selectivity remained at around 50 %, and CH4 selectivity was far below 1.0 %. For RuMn catalyst, 18.7 % of ROH selectivity was obtained at a very low CO conversion, and CO2 selectivity was also higher than 0.7Ru-CoMn and 1.1Rh-CoMn. The catalytic performance of RuMn is very similar to the value showed in Table 1 entry 7. As far as oxygenates distribution was concerned, a striking phenomenon was observed for the three cases that the oxygenates slates were dominated by C3 oxygenates (propanal & propanol, R3OH), confirming that the Rh- or Ru-contained catalysts can catalyze the coupling of syngas and olefins to oxygenates."
9,Synergistic effect of active sites,"3.4 Synergistic effect of active sites Combing the insights provided by the above results, the promotional effect of Rh or Ru and a synergistic effect between different actives sites were clearly observed. Only Co0, Co2C and MnCO3 were detected for the CoMn sample, while additional Rhδ+ or Ruδ+ species with highly dispersed state existed in Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn. For RuMn without Co component, the catalytic activity was rather low and a mixture of metallic Ru and Ruδ+ as well as MnCO3 co-existed after reaction (Fig. S9). As for the spent RuCo sample, only Co2C and a mixture of Ru0 and Ruδ+ were observed. Both MnCO3 and MnO have been proved to show negligible activity for CO hydrogenation process in our previous work [33]. It should be noted that the Na promoter with similar content in all of the studied catalysts also played an important role in catalytic performance, especially in promoting the formation of Co2C and the production of olefins and oxygenates [7,23,29,44]. In addition, literatures have suggested that the Ru-promoted Co-based catalysts without alkaline metal promoter mainly exhibit typical Fischer-Tropsch catalytic performance, where the hydrocarbons dominate the products and the active sites typically contain Ru0-Co0 bimetallic nanoparticles [39]. By comparison, it is reasonable to speculate that the catalysts with active sites including Co0, Co2C and Rhδ+ or Ruδ+ species would exhibit excellent catalytic performance for HAS, meaning that Co0-Co2C-Rhδ+ or Co0-Co2C-Ruδ+ constituted the synergistic active sites for Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn catalysts. The study of the effect of interaction manner and the HAADF-STEM-EDS characterization suggested that a close contact between these three types of active sites exerted profound influence on the HAS performance. Co0-Co2C dual active sites have been well studied for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas [2,20,23,25,48]. Co0 is responsible for dissociative adsorption of CO and CC coupling to form alkyl species, while Co2C works for CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion into alkyl species to form oxygenates instead of α-hydrogen addition to produce paraffins. The kinetic energy for CO insertion process is typically higher than that of α-hydrogen addition, and the stability of Co2C site under severe syngas conversion process remains a great challenging issue, resulting in lower selectivity and yield of oxygenates. Many works reported that the addition of Na [44], K [50], Mn [25,35,36], La [20,51] and Zn [52] et al. can benefit the existence of Co2C. In this work, the promotional effect of Rh or Ru on the formation and stabilization of Co2C in the presence of Na and Mn was firstly disclosed. According to the result of DRIFTS and CO-TPD results, the loading of Rh or Ru can greatly improve the ability in adsorbing and activating CO molecules, providing abundant surface carbonaceous species as indicated by Fig. 5d. Besides, the presence of Na and Mn promoter also shows prohibition effect for H2 uptake [25]. The increasing carbon species coverage over the catalyst surface provides a C-rich and H-lean surface local chemical environment, which is very beneficial to the formation and stabilization of Co2C [25,33]. In addition, the H2-TPR profiles indicated that the hydrogen spill effect derived from the doping of precious metals such as Rh or Ru benefited the reduction of adjacent Co species. Compared with cobalt oxides with high valence state, the metallic Co or Coδ+ species with low valence state are more likely to be carburized to cobalt carbide, and the carburization rate could be accelerated greatly with the existence of Na [34,44]. Moreover, an optimum concentration of Rh or Ru was observed in Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn for HAS, and we attributed this phenomenon to the “dual-side effect” of Rh or Ru. One the one hand, the Rh or Ru can create a C-rich chemical environment by providing abundant carbon species, while excessive carbon species may result in coke deposition over catalysts surface and slow down the catalytic performance. On the other hand, the excessive concentration of active H* species provided by H2 spill effect derived from precious metal would improve the hydrogenation ability. Maintaining a suitable C-rich and H-lean surface local chemical environment plays a very important role for HAS, which can be effectively tuned by changing the content of Rh or Ru."
10,Proposed cooperative reaction network,"3.5 Proposed cooperative reaction network Based on the catalytic performance and structure characterization, a cooperative reaction network with binary reaction route was proposed, as shown in Scheme 1 . For the reaction route 1, the Co0-Co2C constituted the dual active sites for HAS, and the alcohols formation was strengthened greatly by the addition of Rh or Ru species. On the one hand, the Rh or Ru species created a C-rich and H-lean surface local chemical environment and facilitated the stable existence of Co2C. On the other hand, a large amount of carbon species including activated CO* species surrounded the Co-Co2C interface, and can be easily captured by Co2C and followed by insertion into the alkyl chain to form oxygenates. High stability of non-dissociative CO adsorption site with increasing concentration of non-dissociative CO-relative species such as CO* or CHxO* species has been proved to be effective to promote the production of oxygenates [11,12]. The products distribution of Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn followed the classical ASF statistic further confirmed the rationality of this reaction route. In addition, the Co2C typically shows lower ability for CO dissociation and CC coupling compared with Co0 [7,34,39,53,54], leading to the decrease of α value and shift of product distribution to light components. Meanwhile, the hydrogenation ability on Rh- or Ru-CoMn catalyst was also weakened due to the existence of Co2C and the C-rich & H2-lean surface environment, which inversely promoted the olefins production and reduced the hydrogenation rate of alkyl species. The rate of CO insertion to alkyl species to form oxygenates was therefore significantly boosted, as evidenced by Fig. 3c. It should also be pointed out the Co2C phase would exhibit high activity for water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction [50], resulting in relative high CO2 selectivity. However, the H2-lean syngas derived from coal or biomass can be directly employed as feedstock for HAS process without requirement of H2/CO ratio adjustment. With the regard to the reaction route 2, we proposed that in-situ generated olefins via Fischer-Tropsch reaction can further react with syngas to produce oxygenates through relay catalysis process over the highly dispersed Rhδ+ or Ruδ+ sites. Both Rh- and Ru-based heterogeneous catalysts are typically used for olefins hydroformylation reaction [55,56]. The probe experiments in part of 3.3 also demonstrated that the olefins hydroformylation can occur over the Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn catalysts. It has been confirmed that Co2C can work as active phase for olefins formation from syngas, and the as-obtained olefins species easily desorbed from the Co2C surface [7]. C3H6-TPD suggested that the Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn catalysts showed a higher uptake of olefins intermediates, indicating that the desorbed olefins can be quickly captured by the adjacent Rh or Ru species. In addition, the large amount of activated CO* species surrounded the Rh or Ru center and may be conducive to the hydroformylation reaction. The closer contact between Co2C and Rh (or Ru), the more significantly improvement would be obtained, in accordance with the phenomenon observed from the study of the effect of interaction manner on catalytic performance. Another solid evidence is that the ASF gap of C3 oxygenates in Fig. 3a was effectively filled after introducing Rh or Ru to CoMn system. It was reasonable to infer that the ethylene hydroformylation process was intensified, thus promoting the formation of C3 oxygenates. Furthermore, as Co2C typically shows much lower activity than metallic Co, the increase ratio of Co2+/(Co2++Co0) would lead to the decreased activity. However, we observed an opposite experiment phenomenon. In other words, the enhancement in activity of Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn must originate from the promotional effect of Rh or Ru species, which can work as individual active sites for CO hydrogenation reaction. The above studies about the effect of WHSV and reaction pressure also provided a strong signal for the occurrence of hydroformylation. To sum up, a clearly cooperative reaction network can be depicted over Rh-CoMn or Ru-CoMn catalysts. Three types of vital active sites including Co0, Co2C and highly dispersed Rhδ+ (or Ruδ+) co-existed, which exhibited complementary and compatible properties. The Co0 can dissociate CO and H2 to form surface C* and H* species. The combination of these two species will lead to the formation of surface CHx* species, which then undergo carbon chain-growth to form CnHm* species. The Co2C sites can catalyze the non-dissociative adsorption of CO and subsequently insertion into the CnHm* species to form oxygenates (Route 1). The α-hydrogen addition by H* of CnHm* species would lead to the production of hydrocarbons (CnH2n+2), while the β-hydride elimination results in the formation of linear α-olefins (CnH2n), which can diffuse to the adjacent Rhδ+ (or Ruδ+) site and further couple with syngas to form additional oxygenates by hydroformylation reaction (Route 2). The synergistic effect of three types of active sites and the olefins relay coupling process significantly boost the CO insertion rate and benefit the enhancement in catalytic activity and oxygenates selectivity."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, we have proposed and demonstrated an effective strategy to tune the local chemical environment and the application of synergistic relay catalysis methodology can greatly promote higher alcohols formation from syngas conversion with elevated activity and selectivity enabled by doping Rh or Ru component into CoMn catalytic system. Compared with the sole CoMn catalyst, at least 2.5-fold in activity was obtained for 1.1Rh-CoMn and 0.7Ru-CoMn, while 4.1-fold and 2.7-fold higher in productivity of higher oxygenates were observed, respectively. The highly dispersed Rhδ+ or Ruδ+ sites provided abundant surface carbon-related species and created C-rich local chemical environment, which not only promoted the formation and stabilization of Co2C, but also increased the surface coverage of non-dissociative CO* species. This promotion effect greatly favored the construction of Co2C-Co dual-sites for HAS and benefitted the production of oxygenates. Importantly, the Rhδ+ or Ruδ+ species can also function as active site for hydroformylation reaction, which can capture the desorbed olefins intermediates and catalyze the coupling reaction with syngas to produce additional oxygenates. The modulation of chemical environment and the synergistic effect of multifunctional sites between Co2C-Co and Rhδ+ (or Ruδ+) species can effectively strengthen CO insertion rate and contributes to the unique HAS catalytic performance."
