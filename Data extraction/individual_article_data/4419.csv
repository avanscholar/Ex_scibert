0,Introduction,"Enantiomerically pure chemicals are chiral building blocks for synthesizing numerous products in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries (Edegger et al., 2006; Nakamura and Matsuda, 2006). Alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (E.C.1.1.1.X, where X ranges from 1 to 334, http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC1/1/1/), usually utilizes NAD(P)(H) as cofactors and acts to a variety of endogenous and xenobiotic hydroxyl or carbonyl compounds, including reduction of ketones and oxidation of alcohols to chiral compounds (Forrest and Gonzalez, 2000; Oppermann, 2007). Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases were divided into three protein superfamilies basing on their sequence and structural diversity, i.e., short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, aldo-keto reductases, or medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (Hoffmann and Maser, 2007; Kavanagh et al., 2008; Oppermann, 2007). Many naturally occurring alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have strict substrate specificities and require specific cofactors to perform their functions under physiological conditions. For example, (S)-carbonyl reductase from Candida parapsilosis is an NADPH-dependent enzyme, which only efficiently reduces 2-hydroxyacetophenone to (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol at pH6.5 and 30°C (Nie et al., 2007, 2011; Zhang et al., 2009, 2011). Rhodococcus erythropolis (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase was an NAD(H)-specific enzyme and catalyzed acetoin reduction at pH6.5 and 55°C on the synthesis of (R)-chiral alcohols (Yu et al., 2015). Natural alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases are not always efficient for a given stereospecific biosynthesis, because of their substrate specificities, cofactor dependences, and the required physiological conditions. For industrial processes in high-temperature, extreme-pH, and/or non-aqueous environments, alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases generally show low activities, and poor stereoselectivities and stabilities. To address these limitations, tailor-made alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases need to be developed using redesigning tools. Enzyme redesign is a promising approach to creating novel enzymes with desired properties, usually by targeting and manipulating their encoding genes (Penning and Jez, 2001). Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have been redesigned for the synthesis of novel chiral products in non-natural biocatalytic environments (Phillips, 2002; Ravot et al., 2003). When information on structure and function of an alcohol dehydrogenases/reductase is not available, directed evolution is a powerful tool for improving its function and stability (Sakaue and Kajiyama, 2003). This involves two essential steps: the generation of a number of genotype variants by random mutagenesis (Drummond et al., 2005), followed by high-throughput screening of variants for desired properties. The use of appropriate strategies for both steps is very important for achieving goals such as increased catalytic activity, enhanced enantioselectivity, and improved enzyme stability. In the directed evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, high-throughput screening is usually the bottleneck (Dalby, 2011). The rational design of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases is based on information-guided mutagenesis to tailor them for a given asymmetric biosynthesis (Jacobs et al., 2012; Khoury et al., 2009); this can be achieved by engineering enzymes based on their sequences, structures, and functional information. Recent advances in determining the three-dimensional structures of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have provided insights that will be useful in rational redesign. In the site-mutagenesis technique, key amino acids are usually selected for substitution based on the homologous sequence and structure alignment. Moreover, directed evolution and rational design are not incompatible, and can be combined to improve the efficiency. In this review, we focus on advances in strategies for redesigning alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases by directed evolution, rational design, and their combinations, to enable more efficient production of desired enantiopure isomers. Alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase redesign for substrate specificity, cofactor preference, and optimal conditions is also addressed."
1,Directed evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases,"The directed evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases is a practical process. First, it requires minimal knowledge of the catalytic mechanisms of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases and the connections among their structures and functions (Bloom et al., 2005; Valetti and Gilardi, 2004), especially for alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases for which much less information is available. Second, although the crystal structures of many alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have been elucidated, which aids understanding of their catalytic functions, various aspects of their functions/catalytic mechanism still cannot be predicted (Dalby, 2011; Neylon, 2004). For example, only a few amino acids are known to be critical for enzyme function and stability, so enzyme redesign by rational design is limited. Third, very small changes in the configuration of an enzyme associated with directed evolution are usually sufficient to induce unexpected results (Urano et al., 2011). Finally, there are large variations among natural amino acid sequences for similar three-dimensional configurations, making it difficult to exploit sequence flexibility and tailor alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases through rational design. A prerequisite for the directed evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases is to create variant pools. There are two methods for generating libraries (Dalby, 2011): nonrecombinative, random mutagenesis techniques, e.g., sequence saturation mutagenesis and error-prone polymerase chain reactions; and recombinative methods, involving the recombination of gene fragments from homologous enzymes sources, e.g., DNA shuffling and DNA family shuffling. There are some excellent comprehensive reviews of progress in these techniques, with detailed protocols (Goldsmith and Tawfik, 2012; Lutz, 2010; Lutz and Patrick, 2004). In directed evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, as in the cases of other enzymes, although the variant population is important, success is more dependent on the abundance of functional diversity and an active population (Shivange et al., 2009). The applicability of a mutant library therefore depends on the variant quality, not variant quantity (Lutz and Patrick, 2004). Novel methods are very important for developing variant libraries for the directed evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases (Li et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2010). It is worth noting that alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase evolution does not require detailed knowledge of the structure and function, although such information is useful in generating diversity by DNA family shuffling techniques. The following step of directed evolution is the screening and selection of the desired mutants from the generated variant library. As predicted, directed evolution is driving the development of next-generation biocatalysts (Turner, 2009). Alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase modifications can be used to develop novel catalysts with improved properties, such as activity, enantioselectivity, substrate specificity, cofactor preference, thermal stability and tolerance to solvents (Illanes et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010). It is difficult to predict with rational design, which amino acids contribute to protein enantioselectivity and solvent stability, so directed evolution approaches have proven more useful for making rational alterations of enzyme enantioselectivity and stability (Asako et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2011). Suzuk et al. (2010) altered the substrate specificity of promiscuous homoisocitrate dehydrogenase from homoisocitrate to 3-isopropylmalate by directed evolution. The resultant variant LR5-1, with eight amino acid replacements, was found to increase the k cat/K m value by 65-fold for 3-isopropylmalate. Aminoalcohol dehydrogenase from R. erythropolis MAK154 catalyzed the stereoselective reduction of (S)-1-phenyl-1-keto-2-methylaminopropane to d -pseudoephedrine. To improve the resistance of the d -pseudoephedrine, Urano et al. (2011) introduced random mutations into the enzyme for efficient production of double chiral amino alcohols. The mutant Gly73Ser/Ser214Arg showed high activity in the presence of 100mg/ml d -pseudoephedrine. This information is summarized in Fig. 1 ."
2,Screening and selection of desired variants,"These variants have been made available in generous amounts, therefore an efficient screening method is required to find the mutant with the desired properties (Dalby, 2011; Li et al., 2004). Based on most alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases requiring NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H to perform their catalytic functions and to produce enantiomeric products, the screening process can be monitored by detecting cofactor depletion and/or the enantiomeric excesses of the products. High-throughput screening methods have been constructed by determining the enantiomeric excesses of the products using gas chromatography (Reetz et al., 2001), high-performance liquid chromatography (Zhang et al., 2011), ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy (Abato and Seto, 2001), color indicators (van Delden and Feringa, 2001), nuclear magnetic resonance (Korbel et al., 2001), and other techniques (Mikami et al., 2001; Reetz et al., 2010; Taran et al., 2002). Recently, colorimetric assay for high-throughput screening methods has been developed to identify alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase variants with desired properties (Gerstenbruch et al., 2012)."
3,Detecting cofactor depletion and/or the enantiomeric excesses of products,"3.1 Detecting cofactor depletion and/or the enantiomeric excesses of products Most alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases use either NADH or NADPH as a cofactor, and the absorbance of NAD(P)H at 340nm can be monitored during asymmetric reactions. Alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase activity is commonly measured by following the production of NADPH at 340nm with ultraviolet light (UV340). Machielsen et al. (2008) evoluted Pyrococcus furiosus alcohol dehydrogenase and identified potential mutants to increase (2S,5S)-hexanediol production by a significant and fast change in absorbance at 340nm. They mixed cell-free extract and assay buffer, and determined the reaction rate by following the reduction/oxidation of NADP(H) at 340nm using a Hitachi U2010 spectrophotometer. O'Hare et al. (2006) screened the mutant with high reductase activity from the variant library of ketoreductase. They obtained the high-performance mutants by measuring the absorbance at UV340 in a UV-transparent 96-well plate, and analyzing the alcohol products by chiral HPLC. Li et al. (2004) developed a modified method to identify the desired mutant by measuring the enantiomeric excess of chiral alcohols using two enzymes involved in two separate enzymatic reactions. NAD(P)+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases A and B catalyzed the transformation of R-alcohol and S-alcohol, respectively. To determine the enantiomeric excess, they used enzymes A and B to oxidize alcohol independently, and determined the reaction rates by following the formation of NAD(P)H using the absorption at 340nm. Since the enantiomers are generally competing substrates, the reaction rates can be expressed using their V max and K m values. The kinetic constants can be established by separate oxidation of R-alcohol, S-alcohol, and the mixture of R- and S-alcohol in known ratios. The enantiomeric excess value can thus be calculated using the kinetic constants of enzymes A and B. However, these high-throughput screening techniques for enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases are time consuming and costly. These approaches are unsuitable for high-throughput screening for the following reasons: first, background absorbance in 96-well plates tends to be high in the UV range (~0.074 at UV340), and the cell lysate itself also has a moderate absorbance of about 0.04–0.05 at UV340, making reproducibility of measurements is very low; second, the high cost is prohibitive to large screening experiments. So it was desirable to develop the alternative method."
4,Colorimetric assay,"3.2 Colorimetric assay A colorimetric assay for more efficiently screening alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases with desired properties has been developed (van der Donk and Zhao, 2003; Urano et al., 2011). An indirect method using phenazine methosulfate/nitroblue tetrazolium (PMS/NBT) was developed to monitor the enzyme activity and kinetics of asymmetric reactions catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. The principle is as follows: in the presence of PMS, NBT reacts with NADPH from the dehydrogenation reaction and produces a blue–purple formazan, which can be monitored by its absorbance at 580nm (Zhang et al., 2010). Screening can therefore be performed by monitoring the absorption 580nm of blue–purple formazan, using a microplate reader or other instruments. Zhang et al. (2010) engineered glycerol dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli and selected positive mutants with 2.6-fold higher activities toward 1, 3-butanediol using NBT/PMS screening method. They monitored enzyme activity in a reaction system containing cell lysate, NAD+, 1,3-butanediol, NBT and PMS by following the increase in absorbance of formazan. Ravot et al. (2003) used PMS/NBT method to construct a mutant pool of 18 novel thermoactive alcohol dehydrogenases with a broad substrate spectrum, through directed evolution, and produced a useful enzymatic toolbox for asymmetric biosynthesis. Alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase activity can sometimes be monitored by checking the formation of a red clone, using p-rosaniline as an alternative to NBT (van der Donk and Zhao, 2003; Tsotsou et al., 2002). The colorimetric assay methods were also carried out according to some specific properties of different alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. For the directed evolution of alditol oxidase (Gerstenbruch et al., 2012), the screening system composed of 4-aminoantipyrine, chromotropic acid and horseradish peroxidase. After the reaction mixture was incubated, the oxidase reaction was stopped by addition of chromotropic acid and 4-aminoantipyrine. The color formation was induced through addition of moderate peroxidase. The absorbance (endpoint concentration of H2O2) was measured immediately in a spectrophotometer at 600nm. However, spectroscopic screening approaches basing on PMS/NBT are unsuitable for high-throughput screening, because of the background noise from colorful byproducts released during cell lysis, and instrumental limitations."
5,Other assay methods,"3.3 Other assay methods Alternative high-throughput screening methods have been developed according to the specific properties of different alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. To enhance ethanol tolerance of Clostridium thermocellum alcohol dehydrogenase, Brown et al. (2011) used cellobiose and ethanol as the sole carbon source for cell-growth. They screened the mutant with 10-fold higher activity in the concentrated alcohol. Suzuk et al. (2010) improved Thermus thermophilus homoisocitrate dehydrogenase activity toward 3-isopropylmalate. Using the screening plate without leucine, they obtained a mutant with a 31-fold increase in 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase activity and a 65-fold increase in the k cat/K m value for 3-isopropylmalate. Computational approaches hold particular promise in the creation of enzymes with novel properties. Hilvert (2013) reviewed recent progress in enzyme design by combining computational and directed evolution approaches. The computational approach requires the generation and equilibration of the mutant structure, followed by the calculation of partial free energy and comparison with experimental data. This approach for protein designs has implications for protein engineering and drug design. Directed evolution has become a powerful approach to redesigning alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, especially in the absence of structural and functional information (Eijsink et al., 2005; Magliery et al., 2011). However, directed evolution is a blind process, in which it is impossible to predict the results, and it generally requires gene expression, screening of desired variants from a large mutant library, and enzyme purification. In addition, A high-throughput method for determining enantioselectivity is required to make directed evolution of these enzymes efficient (Bommarius et al., 2006; Magliery et al., 2011). These techniques are very important for successful design of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases with improved properties (Drummond et al., 2005; Tao and Cornish, 2002) (Table 1 )."
6,Rational design of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases,"Rational design is used for biocatalyst improvement by site-directed mutagenesis/modification; this requires knowledge of the amino acid sequence, and the structures and functions of protein molecules and their connections. The rapid development of genetic technologies has supplied convenience for redesigning alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase properties by gene manipulation (Ishino et al., 2012; Yamagami et al., 2014). Although alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases are found in various organisms and have diverse amino acid sequences and enzymatic characteristics, they display similar Rossmann folds, because they have similar dinucleotide-binding motifs, making their rational design convenient (Ni and Xu, 2012). The mutation of active sites can have significant effects, including increased enantioselectivity, enhanced robustness in hostile organic solvents, and thermostability (Cedrone et al., 2000; Toscano et al., 2007). Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases catalyze interconversions between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. They have different substrate specificities because their C-terminal motif sequences for substrate binding differ (Kroutil et al., 2004; Ladenstein et al., 2008; Persson et al., 2008). These fingerprint characteristics form the basis of rational design of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases to fit different substrates or be more suitable for a given asymmetric biosynthesis (Eklund and Ramaswamy, 2008; Tanaka et al., 2001). Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases depend on pyridine nucleotides to perform catalytic functions; therefore they share the dinucleotide-binding motif sequence of the Rossmann fold (Eklund and Ramaswamy, 2008; Kavanagh et al., 2008; Oppermann et al., 2003). Cofactor dependence plays a critical role in determining the substrate specificity of an alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase, as well as the product enantioselectivity. There are different fingerprints for cofactor binding in NAD(H)- and NADP(H)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. NAD(H)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have an Asp or a Glu residue, which forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the adenine ribose of NAD(H). At the corresponding position, many NADP(H)-dependent enzymes have Arg, Ser, or Thr, which forms a hydrogen bond with the 2′-phosphate of NADPH (Eklund and Ramaswamy, 2008). The cofactor specificity is attributed partly to the presence of an Asp residue for NAD(H) instead of NADP(H) (Ghosh et al., 2001). The third Gly in some NADP(H)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases is always replaced by Ala, and a positively charged residue is close to the C terminus of the βαβ fold in NAD(H)-binding enzymes (Mittl et al., 1994). These structure properties supply the basis for rational design on cofactor preference alteration of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. Based on the increasing amount of structure information available, the molecular structures of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases can be elucidated in detail. Together with the rapid progress in molecular simulations that decipher the interactions between enzyme and its substrate, cofactor and product, this paves the way for more efficient modification of enzymatic properties by rational design. Meanwhile, novel properties of enzymes produced by rational redesign of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases complement basic research in enzymology."
7,Substrate specificity modifications,"4.1 Substrate specificity modifications The affinities of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases for non-natural substrates are usually poor, because their enantioselectivities are substrate-dependent. To meet the increasing demand for new enantioselective products from non-natural substrates, it is necessary to modify the substrate specificities of enzymes; this involves changing the substrate specificity and expanding the substrate spectrum of enzyme. Based on the quaternary structures of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, the general rationale for substrate specificity modification is to change the size of the active site and the substrate-binding site or channel, and to alter the charge distribution and conformational flexibility, which affect the substrate specificity. The following amino acids can be selected for site-directed mutation: residues inside or adjacent to the catalytic sites or substrate-binding pockets (Musa et al., 2009; Ziegelmann-Fjeld et al., 2007), and residues affecting or determining the stereochemistry of oxidation–reduction (Baerga-Ortiz et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2008). Other techniques such as constructing or eliminating a salt or disulfide bridge in the substrate- or coenzyme-binding domain (Folch et al., 2008), and isolating an intersection of “strong forcing sets” are also very effective for engineering substrate stereospecificity (Yin and Kirsch, 2007). Table 2 summarizes the major progress achieved in this area in the past two decades. By changing the hydrophobic interaction between the enzyme and substrate (Masuda et al., 2005), R.Z. Zhang et al. (2008, 2009, 2013) designed an Ala220Asp or Glu228Ser mutation inside or adjacent to the substrate-binding pocket of (S)-carbonyl reductase from C. parapsilosis; they altered the substrate specificity from β-hydroxyacetophenone to acetophenone, and the product enantioselectivity from (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol to (R)-phenylethanol. Zhu and Hua (2006), Zhu et al. (2006, 2008) used a docking program (Schapira et al., 2003) to generate a carbonyl reductase mutant from Sporobolomyces salmonicolor, for para-substituted acetophenone reduction with reversed enantiopreference and enhanced enantioselectivity. Nakajima et al. (1999) substituted five substrate-binding residues of tropinone reductase 1 by the corresponding residues of tropinone reductase 2, and switched its product stereospecificity; a 6288-fold increase in the K cat/K m value for tropinone was observed. Klimacek and Nidetzky (2010) reported that the Asn191Asp/Asn300Asp mutant of Pseudomonas fluorescens mannitol 2-dehydrogenase behaved as a fructose reductase at pH5.2, and lacked mannitol oxidation activity in the pH range 6.8–10.0. Recently, Wang et al. (2014) achieved a breakthrough in substrate stereoselectivity of medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases by replacing Phe285 and Trp286, located at the entrance of and inside the small pocket, with Ala (Fig. 3 ); this significantly enlarged the small pocket and completely inversed the enantioselectivity of (R)-carbonyl reductase toward the (S)-product with an optical purity of 99.9%. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying catalysis by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases will enable more efficient and productive rational design for tailoring of substrate specificity. Proteins are highly modular molecules made of smaller building blocks. Recent advances in enzyme redesign include loop grafting and chimera building; these processes are defined as module engineering. The designed enzymes are called chimeric enzymes, chimeric proteins, or chimera (Tawfik, 2006). Module engineering is also one of the important methods of rational design developed recently. Using engineering modular methods, Zhou et al. (2012) grafted a fungal β-ketoreductase domain into the highly reducing polyketide synthase Hpm8, to achieve substrate-dependent stereospecificity. Human 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase have a similarity of 97.2%, but they cannot be interconverted when all the substrate-binding residues of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are substituted by the equivalent ones of 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. However, as shown in Fig. 2, when loop A of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was replaced by that of 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the chimeric protein functioned as 3α- and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. When loops A and C of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase were replaced by the corresponding loops of 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the resulting chimera was a bifunctional 3α/20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. When loops A, B, and C of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase were all substituted by those of 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was converted to 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Ma and Penning, 1999). These results suggest that individual loop modulation does not yield a mutant with favorable features, but multiloop modulation does. Sometimes, the computer-aided program, such as sequence alignment, structure comparison, protein-substrate/cofactor docking and relative parameter calculation, is carried out to enhance the success probability of rational design. Using computational rational design, Hellgren et al. (2010) identified new ligands for human alcohol dehydrogenase from 40,962 compounds, which were sorted according to the distance between the catalytic zinc ion and the closest oxygen in the compound by docking methods. Then, by ranking the compounds based on the distance between the compound and the catalytic zinc, the catalytic zinc and cofactor and the catalytic zinc and Arg114, and the scoring energy, they selected the top-ranked compounds for further in vitro experiments. Two of these showed substrate activity when calculation of binding scoring energies correlated well with the k cat/K m values for the substrates. After docking two newly identified substrates into the active site of human alcohol dehydrogenase 3, some amino acid residues were suggested for mutations."
8,Cofactor preference alteration,"4.2 Cofactor preference alteration The specific biocatalytic functions of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases require cofactors such as NAD(H) or NADP(H); this results in versatile kinetic behaviors (Jörnvall et al., 2010). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is nicotinamide-mediated hydride and proton transfers (Bezsudnova et al., 2012; Bubner et al., 2008; Campbell et al., 2013). For industrial applications, converting the cofactor specificity of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductase from NADPH to NADH would be of great significance since NADH is much cheaper than NADPH. And sometimes, alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase is more efficient for given asymmetric biosynthesis by changing its cofactor specificity (R.Z. Zhang et al., 2014; X. Zhang et al., 2014). The cofactor preference alteration of an alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase can potentially redirect metabolic pathways to improve product yields (R.Z. Zhang et al., 2012, 2013; Wang et al., 2012), making it the preferred strategy for redesigning alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. Generally, cofactor dependence alternation is designed based on site mutation of the following amino acids: residues near or located at a cofactor-binding site (Wulf et al., 2012; Bubner et al., 2008), residues involved in cofactor binding or selectivity (Petschacher et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Zavala, 2008), or residues essential for catalytic activity (Rosado et al., 2012). The purpose of site mutagenesis is to enhance the electrostatic interactions of the enzymes. Usually, the cofactor dependence can be changed by substitution at the phosphate-binding site (Rosell et al., 2003) or adenosine-binding pocket (Morikawa et al., 2005), or introducing the loop region of a homologous enzyme (Tomita et al., 2006) or structural zinc (Watanabe et al., 2005). Khoury et al. (2009) designed cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase from NADPH to NADH using modified IPRO (iterative protein redesign and optimization) workflow. They identified seven out of the 8000 mutations possessed significant xylose reductase activity with its cofactor specificity shift from NADPH to NADH by introducing mutations in the cofactor-binding pocket. Experimental results revealed that seven mutations possessed 27-fold higher activity with NADH than NADPH. In some case, cofactor preference alteration is an effective strategy for increasing alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase activities in a given asymmetric biosynthesis to produce non-natural products (Banta et al., 2002). McKeevera et al. (2002) substituted Arg80 by other residues in 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3; this not only affected NADPH binding, but also changed the enzymatic kinetics. In C. parapsilosis (S)-carbonyl reductase, Asp67 and Asp68 promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with the adenine ribose of NADPH (Wulf et al., 2012); Zhang et al. (2009) designed a Ser67Asp/His68Asp mutation to modify the cofactor preference from NADPH to NADH, and consequently altered the product enantioselectivity. Campbell et al. (2010) broadened the cofactor specificity and achieved novel kinetic transient behavior of P. furiosus alcohol dehydrogenase. As shown in Fig. 4 , the side chain of an Asp or Glu residue located at the end of the second N-terminal β-strand or on the ensuing turn or loop of P. fluorescens mannitol 2-dehydrogenase. The carboxylate group of Asp69 forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the adenosine of NAD+ and contributes to much more preference of the enzyme for NAD+ as compared to NADP+. The variant Asp69Ala uses NADP(H) almost as well as wild-type enzyme uses NAD(H). The Glu68Lys substitution enhanced the electrostatic interaction of the enzyme with the 2′-phosphate of NADP+. So the Glu68Lys/Asp69Ala mutant enzyme showed preference for NADP(H) over NAD(H) (Bubner et al., 2008). Engineering the cofactor dependences of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases can adapt them for given asymmetric biosyntheses to produce non-natural products. These methods have enabled significant progress in altering coenzyme specificity, as shown in Table 3 ."
9,Adaptation to optimal conditions,"4.3 Adaptation to optimal conditions In addition to the enzymological properties, environmental conditions also affect enzymatic reactions, and thermal stability and operational stability are two important factors in asymmetric biosyntheses catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. 4.3.1 Improvement of thermal stability Thermostable alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases are desirable for biotransformations of enantiomers because many substrates are poorly soluble in water; high temperatures improve the solubility and facilitate the reactions. High temperatures can also reduce the viscosity and lower the risk of microbial contamination (Eijsink et al., 2005; Jacobs et al., 2012; Unsworth et al., 2007). Recently, techniques for protein thermostabilization by site mutagenesis have been developed, and three strategies have attracted attention: changing the hydrophobic interactions (Bezsudnova et al., 2012; Folch et al., 2008), improving the surface electrostatic interactions (Gribenko et al., 2009; Roca et al., 2007), and introducing disulfide bonds between Cys residues (Ding et al., 2013). As shown in Fig. 5 , an Ala275Ser/Leu276Gln mutation at the dimer interface and close to the active site of C. parapsilosis carbonyl reductase resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in the enzyme activity, 1.5-fold higher interfacial stability, and improved thermal resistance (ΔT 50 =5.2°C) (Jakoblinnert et al., 2013). Goihberg et al. (2008) thermostabilized Entamoeba histolytica alcohol dehydrogenase by Asp275Pro substitution at the dimer–dimer interface to reduce the flexibility and reinforce hydrophobic interactions at the dimerization interface. Watanabe et al. (2005) enhanced the thermal stability and cofactor specificity by introducing an additional zinc ion into Pichia stipitis NAD+-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase. The thermostabilities of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases can also be enhanced by making chimeric proteins consisting of subdomains of different proteins. In this way, favorable features, especially protein thermostabilities from different parents, can be combined. Campbell et al. (2013) completely altered the substrate and cofactor specificities of two similar hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases by modular exchange of their substrate-binding loops. After examining the modularity of the two dehydrogenases, they grafted some critical modules involved in substrate specificity from human aldose reductase into the hyperthermostable alcohol dehydrogenase D from P. furiosus. Human aldose reductase activity was imparted to alcohol dehydrogenase D from P. furiosus, and the thermostability of the parent enzyme was retained (Campbell et al., 2013). Wulf et al. (2012) designed a stabilized chimera by combining the domains of two mesostable polyol dehydrogenases by modular engineering. More efficient design can be achieved by changing the orientation of the cofactor and the substrate specificity at the active site rather than by substituting individual amino acids. Table 4 summarizes some successful redesigns, and their rationales, for improving the thermostabilities of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. 4.3.2 Improvement of operational stability Stereospecific reactions catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases to produce chiral compounds are frequently performed under harsh conditions, particularly with toxic solvents at nonphysiological pH. Many substrates are insoluble in water, and other solvents are needed for the reactions (Gröger et al., 2003). Reactions catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases need expensive cofactors, and organic–cosubstrate-coupled systems are introduced for cofactor regeneration (Wang et al., 2012). Aqueous–organic biphasic systems are often beneficial for processes such as recovery of enzymes or products (Eckstein et al., 2004). However, there have only been a few reports of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases to improve their solvent-resistance without effect their catalytic activity (B. Zhang et al., 2013; R.Z. Zhang et al., 2013), and most natural alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases have low activities, or are even completely denatured in the presence of solvents, especially polar solvents. Miroliaei and Nemat-Gorgani (2002) reported the effects of organic solvents on the stabilities and activities of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. The active conformations and enzyme stabilities of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases must be maintained for them to perform efficiently. Klibanov (2001) proposed that enzyme stability in aqueous–organic reaction systems could be increased by enzyme redesign. Musa et al. (2008, 2013) made Trp110Ala mutation in secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus involved in substrate specificity and product enantio-selectivity, and conducted biotransformations at high substrate concentrations in 50% (v/v) of organic solvents. Jakoblinnert et al. (2013) substituted Ala275 with Asn or Leu276 with Gln on the interface between dimers in carbonyl reductase from C. parapsilosis and increased the specific activity of 1.5-fold and interfacial stability in the presence of cyclohexane. It is beneficial to expand or change the pH spectrum for chiral biosynthesis by alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases. Liang et al. (2013) increased activity of glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis even at pH>10 by Gln252Leu/Glu170Arg mutation to reduce the electrostatic repulsion effect. Ding et al. (2013) carried out Asp255Cys mutation by Introduction of disulfide bridges between subunits in glucose 1-dehydrogenase from Lysinibacillus sphaericus G10, and made enzyme extremely stable at pH ranging from 4.5 to 10.5 and retaining nearly 100% activity after incubating at different buffers for 1h. Some breakthroughs in engineering alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases by rational design for improved operational stability are summarized in Table 5 . Rational design has had a tremendous impact on the development of new enzymes, but the strategy requires an in-depth understanding of the amino acid sequence, protein structure, and catalytic function. Unfortunately, for the majority of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, such complete information is still not available. Although it is now easy to sequence DNA coding for amino acids, elucidation of the molecular structure of the enzymes and their catalytic functions is a challenge, and this makes the selection of targets for rational design less efficient. Molecular simulation based on suitable algorithms and experimental verification is helpful in understanding the relationships among sequence, structure, and function in enzyme redesign (Turner, 2009). New techniques for enzyme redesign have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of directed evolution and rational design, such as combinations of directed evolution and rational design."
10,Combining directed evolution and rational design,"Traditional directed evolution involves time-consuming and low-efficiency screening of large mutant libraries, and rational design requires comprehensive information on the enzyme structure and function (Jochens and Bornscheuer, 2010; Lutz, 2010). The efficiency of directed evolution can be significantly improved by restricting the substitution to a limited “hot-spots” to design small yet “smart” libraries, utilizing information on protein sequence–structure–function relationships or by using computational methods (Bornscheuer et al., 2012; Goldsmith and Tawfik, 2012). To overcome these drawbacks of conventional directed evolution and rational design, an approach that combines directed evolution and rational design techniques, named semi-rational design, is very useful for redesigning alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases (Bommarius et al., 2006; Lehmann and Wyss, 2001). Akanuma et al. (1999) improved the thermal stability of B. subtilis 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase by rationally combining the advantageous mutations resulting from directed evolution. They used a random mutagenesis technique and identified two thermostabilizing substitutions, Thr22→Lys and Met256→Val. They combined other mutations of residues involved in hydrophobic subunit interaction and a rigid type II β-turn, and successively introduced amino acid substitutions into the mutant with the quintuple mutations by site-directed mutagenesis: Thr308Ile, Ile95Leu, Met292Ile, Thr22Lys, Met256Val, Glu253Leu, Glu112Pro, Ser113Gly, and Ser115Glu. The half-inactivation temperature of the mutant was higher than that of the wild-type enzyme by 23°C. Makino et al. (2005) illustrated the power of combining directed evolution and rational design of phenylacetaldehyde reductase from Corynebacterium sp. ST-10, and adapted phenylacetaldehyde reductase for efficient substrate conversion at high concentrations in concentrated 2-propanol. The maximum conversion was observed at around 3 to 10% (vol/vol) 2-propanol concentration, and conversions dropped when the 2-propanol concentration increased by >10% (vol/vol) with the wild-type. Using the combination strategy of directed evolution and rational design, the enantioselectivity ≥99% enantiomeric excess was obtained even at concentrations of 30% (vol/vol) of 2-propanol. Zhang et al. (2010) improved the overall catalytic activity of glycerol dehydrogenase toward 1, 3-butanediol. They combined the mutations from both DNA shuffling and rational design and produced the best mutant with a V max value of 126.6U/mg, a 26-fold activity increase towards 1,3-butanediol compared with that of the wild type. In C. parapsilosis carbonyl reductase, Ala275 and Leu276 are located at the dimer interface (Jakoblinnert et al., 2012). The two amino acids are selected for site mutation to decrease the extent of hydrophobic interactions with the organic solvent molecules by exchanging hydrophobic with hydrophilic residues on the protein surface (Ogino et al., 2007). The T 50-value of the mutant Ala275Asn/Leu276Gln is increased (T 50 =5.2°C) along with the interfacial stability (1.5-fold) when compared to wild-type enzyme. The structure–function relationship of redesigning thermal and operational stability of C. parapsilosis carbonyl reductase was showed in Fig. 5. The accumulation of mutations from different clones can cause cooperative damage, so there is no guarantee that combining mutations will have cumulative benefits (Chica et al., 2005; Ness, 2002). Effective cooperation is achieved by accumulation of positive mutations, in conjunction with other substitutions confirmed by sequencing experiments. New calculation tools for exploring the sequence–fitness relationship have been used to optimize enzyme redesign, making the combination of directed evolution and rational design more efficient (Keasling, 2010; Nov and Wein, 2005; Röthlisberger, 2008). The rapid advances in computational enzyme redesign algorithms have enabled the development of some highly promising strategies for biocatalyst engineering. Based on knowledge derived from biochemical and/or structural information, semi-rational design can be used to create smaller, smarter libraries. Some favorable variants have been found by screening virtual libraries (Lutz, 2010; Röthlisberger et al., 2008). For example, Vazquez-Figueroa et al. (2007) introduced a structure-guided consensus concept for developing a thermostable glucose dehydrogenase, and Watanabe et al. (2006) semi-rationally designed a thermostable 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase through phylogenetic analysis."
11,Conclusions,"Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases play important roles in catalyzing enantioselective reactions for the manufacture of a wide range of chiral compounds. Most of these enzymes have strict substrate stereospecificities, and are cofactor- and environment-dependent, so they are usually not efficient in reactions with non-natural substrates and non-natural cofactors under nonphysiological conditions. Alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases can be adapted for given enantioselective biosyntheses by engineering wild-type enzymes with enzyme redesign tools: directed evolution, rational design, and their combinations. The breakthroughs and rationale in the redesign of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases by substrate enantiospecificity modification, cofactor dependence alteration, and changes to nonphysiological conditions have been summarized and discussed. Knowledge of the sequences, structures, and functions of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, together with the rapid developments in algorithms for molecular simulations, will enable alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase redesign to improve their catalytic efficiencies for given enantioselective biosyntheses and production of desired enantiopure isomers."
