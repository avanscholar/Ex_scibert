0,Introduction to lignocellulosic biomass,"Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most abundant feedstocks that play the advantages over other renewable supplies since biomass is a non-edible part of the plants [1,2]. It has also been defined as a green sustainable feedstock with net zero carbon emission, thus protecting the world from global warming effect. Some studies have shown that lignocellulosic biomass can be used as a renewable feedstock for production of value-added biochemicals and biofuels [3–5]. For every year, agricultural activities produce a large quantity of lignocellulosic residue and accumulate in a huge number. This accumulation of biomass can cause a serious environmental problems due to improper disposal of these residues to landfill [6]. The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to hydrocarbon fuels is an alternative option that has many important advantages. It is not only owing to reduce environmental concerns but also being one of the most alternatives for replacement of fossil resources. Moreover, an efficient utilization of these wastes could provide a cost-effective substrate to meet the requirement and demand of the industries [4,7,8]. Basically, lignocellulosic biomass is derived from available atmospheric water, CO2 and sunlight through biological photosynthesis. It is a complex matrix composed of three major biopolymers, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Fig. 1 ) [9], which are distributed as a complex network within the cell walls [10]. For cellulose, it is a well-known structure representative of a polydisperse linear homopolymer in the cell walls of plant fibers, consisting of d-glucopyranose units bound together by the regio- and enantioselectively β-1,4-glycoside [9]. Cellulose can present in many crystal forms (cellulose allomorphs) showing differences in unit cell dimensions and chain polarity [9,11]. While hemicellulose is an amorphous structure comprising polysaccharide backbone surrounded the cellulose fibers and linked between cellulose and lignin [2]. The polysaccharide backbone typically has on its structure polysaccharide branches or other substituents such as carboxyl groups [11]. Therefore, the monosaccharide units in hemicelluloses are composed of different pentose (xylose and arabinose), hexose (glucose, mannose, galactose and rhamnose) and sugar acids (glucuronic and galacturonic) [9]. In contrast, lignin is a variety of three-dimensional cross-linked complex of different chemical bonds between phenyl propane, ether and carbon–carbon [9,10]. It has been known as a highly branched biopolymer with a bunch of different functional groups, including methoxyl (CH3O-), hydroxyls (HO-), carbonyl (CO-), and carboxylic groups (CO2-) [9,12]. Typically, lignin is concentrated between the outer layers of the fibers of polysaccharides and protect the degradation of the wood biomass. Here, we concentrate on the current knowledge and advanced processes for biofuel and biochemical production from lignocellulosic biomass, especially furfural derivatives. We also focused on heterogeneous catalysis for production of various value-added compounds from cellulosic sugars. In particular, furfural upgrading to furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, furfurylamine, furoic acid, levulinic acid, succinic acid, furan, and 2- methylfuran is intensively demonstrated through a catalytic chemical process. The bio-process utilizing bacteria, microorganisms or enzymes did not fall into the scope of this review."
1,Concept of lignocellulosic biomass utilization,"Currently, the advanced technologies for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass are being demonstrated worldwide. In the last decades, several researchers have attempted to discover the transformation of biomass into value-added products [7,11,13,14] and reported that lignocellulosic biomass not only offers a great potential as a abundant renewable resource but also represents a promising option of high output/input energy ratio and wide spectrum of possible products [15,16]. However, the high efficiency, ease and low-cost processing technologies to convert biomass in a large amount are key factors for actual implementation and do not yet exist. There are sizable numbers of technological barriers that need to be overcome. Thus, the challenges in advancement of technologies for a cost-competitive production of biofuels and biochemicals with scalability must be addressed. Up to date, the state-of-the-art technology to transform biomass into the biochemical platforms is achieved via biomass fractionation (e.g. steam explosion and organosolv) into cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Consequently, these three major components are further converted into intermediate chemical molecules such as furfural and 5-HMF before upgrading to biofuel or fine biochemical molecules. Presently, the available technologies are catalytic hydrolysis, solvolysis, hydroliquefaction, fast pyrolysis and gasification with hydrogenation over multifunctional solid catalysts [1,7,10,17–21], which are conventionally implemented. Fig. 2 shows the advance approaches for biomass processing toward value-added biochemicals and biofuels. Two technological platforms have been classified – one is thermochemical platform, and another is sugar platform – for explaining how to convert biomass into a variety of products. Thermochemical platform is referred to the process that degrades lignocellulosic biomass into syngas and pyrolysis oil by gasification and pyrolysis, respectively. The major products from gasification are gaseous CO and H2 (syngas), while the pyrolysis process produces oxygenated liquid intermediates (bio-oil or pyrolysis oil) along with biochar and gaseous portions. Further refineries are typically required by secondary processing to convert syngas into alkanes and oxy-hydrocarbons by Fischer-Tropsch technology and to deoxygenate, crack, isomerize, and esterify bio-oil molecules into high-quality biofuels. While sugar platform is relevant to the depolymerization of lignocellulosic feedstocks into lignin, celluloses and hemicelluloses by advances hydrothermal process before further hydrolyzing into hexoses (C6) and pentoses (C5) sugars."
2,Catalytic thermochemical platform,"2.1 Catalytic thermochemical platform Converting biomass into biofuels and biochemical platforms through thermal process has attracted much attention over the past decades. It is a flexible method in term of feed and liquid fuel products. The major processes are gasification and pyrolysis. Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is referred to the thermal decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin accompanied with heterogeneous catalysts in the absence of oxygen [22]. It has reported that fast catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is recognized as an efficient and feasible process to produce green aromatics and sustainable intermediate feedstocks (levoglucosenone, hydroxymethyl furfural, furfural, and phenolic compounds) as compared to intermediate-, slow- and hydro-pyrolysis [22–24]. During the pyrolysis process, it is involving simultaneous solid phase chemical reactions, liquid phase reactions, liquid evaporation, vapor phase reactions, and mass transfer of vapors through the solid [25]. The pyrolysis products are divided into solid biochar, pyrolysis oil, and gases [26]. For the primary product composition of pyrolysis oil, commonly known as crude bio-oil, predominantly depends on the type and sources of lignocellulosic biomass. It is dark brown and highly viscous containing oxygenated compounds up to 40 wt % [24]. Several researches in literatures have applied the solid acid catalysts such as zeolites [27–29], Ni supported catalysts [30], SAPO [31], and silica [32] for the pyrolysis of lignocellulose into hydrocarbons with different selectivity. Gasification of lignocellulosic biomass is now regarded as substantial current research interest. It is the process to generate gaseous fuel by burning biomass in a gasification medium such as air, oxygen and steam at elevated temperatures (ca. 500–1500 °C) and pressures (ca. 30–40 bars) to yield a mixture of gasses [33,34]. Based on the recent research, various possible routes to gasify biomass have been developed for utilizing syngas as feedstocks for biofuels and chemicals. There are several studies dealing with the gasification of biomass [35–37]. Up to now, the calcined dolomites (OCa.OMg) or related materials, including calcite, limestone, and magnesite are often applied in the process for cleaning up the hot gas [35,36]. Some abundant transition metal like Ni-based and Re-based catalysts are also used to prevent the coke formation from tar [38–41]. Furthermore, the supported noble metal catalyst of Rh is conducted to the system and found that the tar content of the producer was completely negligible [41,42]."
3,Advanced catalytic hydrolysis process,"2.2 Advanced catalytic hydrolysis process In contrast to the gasification and pyrolysis, the hydrolysis processing using heterogeneous acid catalysts is carried out at mild temperatures to deconstruct lignocellulose into fractionate phenolic compounds, sugar (mono- or oligo-saccharides) in hydrothermal media conditions before further catalyzing them to C5–C6 sugars (Fig. 3 ). This process potentially allows better control of the catalytic chemistry. Various types of solid acids of metal phosphates, metal oxides, sulfonated carbon, zeolites and modified zeolites, supported siliceous, MOF, and heteropolyacids have been developed [7–9,43–45]. The surface-grated or supported heterogeneous catalysts have been also selected for hydrolysis reaction of lignocellulosic materials in a short reaction time at low temperature [44]. Some other types of solid acids such as novel polymeric resins (Amberlysts-15) could also be used for hydrolysis of fragment lignocellulose [46]. The integrated thermochemical catalytic process along with co-solvent or ionic liquids could also claim as a highly efficient process [10]. Nonetheless, the high cost of ionic liquids and the recovery issue limit their large-scale application for sugar production. It is noteworthy that the utilization of solid catalysts can enhance the hydrolysis rate of biomass and subsequently the dissolution rate of sugars. Sugars are important chemicals derived from biomass which can be catalytically transformed in the aqueous phase to produce value-added chemicals and liquid alkanes. Therefore, sugar conversion to furans can be reached by dehydration of C5 sugar (xylose) to furfural and C6 sugar (glucose or fructose) sugar to HMF, in many solvents including water [44,45,47], ionic liquids [10,48], organics [49], and biphasic mixtures accompanied with heterogeneous acid catalysts [50,51]. Subsequently aldol condensation and aqueous-phase dehydration-hydrogenation can proceed to convert those furanic compounds into fuel additives. In fact, furfural and HMF can be potential feedstocks for specialty chemicals and various higher-value chemicals, materials and bioplastics. The synthesis of furfural and 5-HMF is based on the triple dehydration of sugars. The transformation of the C5 and C6 sugars to furfural and 5-HMF is occurred through the two sequence of 1,2-eliminations and 1,4-elimination of water molecules [11,44,52]. Many of heterogeneous acid catalysts have been developed and applied in this reaction, for examples, H-zeolite, metal phosphates, ion-exchange reins, and sulfonic-acid-modified silica, and metal oxides [7–9,43–46]. The acidity and basicity of catalyst were influenced the HMF and furfural yields [44,47]. ZrO2-based catalysts (i.e. ZrO2, WO3–ZrO2, TiO2–ZrO2, and SO4–ZrO2) was found to efficiently catalyze the hydrolysis/dehydration of lignocellulosic biomass to 5-HMF and furfural under hot compressed water conditions [47]. Nevertheless, the catalytic selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts is not as high as those observed over enzyme catalysts. Therefore, reaction optimization and catalyst design are indispensable to acquire the high product yield. To the best of our knowledge, several reviews have mentioned on conversion of 5-HMF to chemical platforms but there are few for furfural [44,53–55]. Thus, in this review, catalytic conversion of furfural to C5 chemical platforms have proposed."
4,Catalytic conversion of furfural to C5 chemicals,
5,Overview,"3.1 Overview Furfural is a green bio-based chemical derived from lignocellulose. It serve as precursors for the synthesis of biofuels and value-added C4 and C5 chemicals through oxidation, hydrodeoxygenation, hydrodecarbonylation, hydrogenolysis or rearrangement, and hydrogenation reactions [7,56]. The pathways for conversion of furfural are illustrated in Scheme 1 . The recent progress in conversion of furfural into fuel additives has been performed via hydrogenation reaction with a combination of aldol condensation (to enhance the molecule length during the C–C bond formation) and etherification (to produce some specialty chemicals) [7,11]. Furfural has several applications, depending on the chemical production routes as tabulated in Table 1 [57]. The catalytic conversion of furfural to C5 chemicals, including furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2-methylfuran (MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), levulinic acid (LA), γ-valerolactone (GVL), pentanediol, and cyclopentanone has been emphasized. Furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran are presently the most relevant chemicals and fuels, which could be widely consumed in chemical industry [63–65]. Therefore, much attention has been dedicated to developing nanostructured catalysts for conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran based on non-noble metal catalysts."
6,"Furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol","3.2 Furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol Furfuryl alcohol (FA) or 2-furanmethanol is synthesized by hydrogenation of furfural. It consumed around 65% of total amount of furfural produced each year [66]. Typically, furfural hydrogenation could take place on metal catalyst surface to produce FA. Various monometallic and bimetallic catalysts have been suggested as the good catalysts for hydrogenation of furfural both in liquid phase and gas phase reactions such as Ni, Cu, Co, Ru, Pt, Pd, Cu–Ni, Cu–Co, Cu–Zn, Cu–Cr, and Pd–Cu supported catalysts [7,66–70]. Among those metal catalysts, the Cu–Cr based catalysts could provide high activity among other metal catalysts. It is well known that copper chromite (Cu–Cr) catalysts have been applied in the furan industry since it exhibits great performance; 98% selectivity of furfuryl alcohol in liquid-phase reaction and 35–98% in gas-phase reaction. However, the Cr species exhibited excessive impact on the environmental problem resulting in limitation of further applications [19,71]. The copper catalysts in combination with Zn or Ni promoters and Al2O3 or SiO2 supports are other choices for this propose due to their highly selectivity toward hydrogenation of the carbonyl group (CC double bonds in the furyl ring). In addition, furfuryl alcohol production by catalytic transfer hydrogenation in various types of alcohols as hydrogen donors without direct feed of explosive H2 has received great attention [72]. Accordingly, this process is more economical and much safer under the operation with hydrogen. Among different hydrogen donors, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol are mostly attractive, especially 2-propanol, because this noncorrosive alcohol can act as both hydrogen donor and solvent [19]. Therefore, the great opportunities existing in the research and development of furfuryl alcohol production has employed in liquid phase hydrogenation in the presence of alcohols using non-chrome in particular to Cu-based catalysts. In case of 2-MF, many researchers focus on the production directly from furfural toward gas phase or liquid phase reactions. Liquid-phase catalytic transfer hydrogenation under alcohols as hydrogen donors has received much attention because it is more economical and much safer than the pure hydrogen system. Various types of catalysts have been utilized in furfural hydrodeoxygenation to 2-MF (see Table 2 ), for example Mo2C supported on Al2O3 or SiO2 as well as metallic Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Co, Fe, Ni, and Cu 80,83[65,80,82–84]. In a typical case, metallic Pt, Pd, and Rh catalysts are highly selectivity for CC hydrogenation, while Cu, Ni, Co, and Ag are preferable to CO bond hydrogenation [65]. Thus, the suitable catalysts for 2-MF production should selectively cleave C–O bonds and subsequently hydrogenation proceeds [83]. In particular, less oxophilic property and weak interaction with CO in the furan ring could be found on copper surface species [83]. Hence, they are highly selective to hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of furfural to generate FA, and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation reaction removes oxygen molecules to produce 2-MF [85]. The addition of aurichalcite and zincian malachite to Cu-based catalysts for furfural hydrodeoxygenation to 2-methylfuran could enhance the high yields of 2-methylfuran of 94.5% with conversion of 100%. Consequently, many efforts have been employed in Cu-containing catalysts with second metal additions such as Cu–Ni, Cu–Fe, and Cu–Zn catalysts. Similar to furfuryl alcohol production, the great opportunities existing in the research and development of 2-methylfuran production was employed in liquid phase hydrogenation in presence of alcohols using Cu-containing catalysts. Several research and development of furfural conversion to 2-MF have been recently published, and most of them focus on metal-support interactions [86,87]. They reported that the catalyst supports in particular to the surface properties play an important role to their side reactions and catalyst lifetime. The SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, and carbon supports have been widely utilized for the reaction. The strong metal-support interaction is TiO2, resulting in the superior performance of furfural hydrodeoxygenation contributed by the surface acidity of the catalysts. For instance, the CO hydrogenation can be promoted over Al2O3 support [25], whereas TiO2 is favorable in carbonyl hydrogenolysis reaction to generate 2-MF. Table 3 shows the catalyst performance for hydrodeoxygenation of furfural to 2-MF over different metal catalysts. In general, hydrogenating furfural under severe temperature and pressure could yield not only the FA and 2-MF products but also tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). Particularly, Furfural is first hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol by adding hydrogen to C═C bonds of furfural, and then furfuryl alcohol was further hydrogenated to THFA. It has been reported that Cu exhibits a high selectivity toward hydrogenation of the CO group but unreacted with the CC double bonds in the furanyl ring. Likewise, the group of Pd‐, Ru‐, Rh‐ and Ni‐supported catalysts along with their mixtures with copper species have also been employed in the catalytic hydrogenation of either furfural or furfuryl alcohol to THFA. Ni catalysts was active at low temperature of 100 °C, showing selectivity to furfuryl alcohol above 95%. Moreover, recent researches have indicated that supports are markedly influence their performance for catalytic liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to THFA. It has been reported that more stable SiO2 support gave high catalytic performance for production of THFA from furfural. Moreover, the utilization of hydroxyapatite as a support for Pd catalyst can improve the hydrogenation of furfural with almost 100% conversion and 100% yield under mild conditions (40 °C, 1 MPa H2, and 3 h) in liquid 2-propanol. It has been observed that the conversion of furfural to FA intermediate was less structure-sensitive, whereas the conversion of FA to THFA was strongly structure-sensitive. In addition, THFA can proceed to yield 1,5-pentanediol and 1,2-pentanediol, the important monomers in the plastic."
7,Levulinic acid and γ-valerolactone,"3.3 Levulinic acid and γ-valerolactone At present, the production of levulinic acid can be done via acid-catalyzed reactions of C5-sugars in hemicellulose and C6-sugars in cellulose. The conversion through C5-sugars produces 1 mol furfuryl alcohol from 1 mol of furfural by consuming 1 mol of H2, while the conversion through C6-sugars generates an equimolar mixture of levulinic acid and formic acid. From Scheme 1, it can be seen that the conversion of furfural to levulinic acid (LA) proceeds via selective hydrogenation of furfural to FA followed by hydrolysis of FA to LA which will further convert to γ-valerolactone (GVL) through hydrogenation. Remarkably, a key step in the levulinic acid production from the furfural is the conversion of furfuryl alcohol into levulinic acid, otherwise a polymer is obtained as a byproduct. However, sugars could be converted into levulinic acid in one-step reaction over catalysts comprising a combination of Lewis and BrØnsted acid sites [88]. The application of a biphasic reaction system is developed to reduce the undesired polymerization reactions by diluting highly reactive species in the liquid media [89]. Over the past decade, the yield of levulinic acid is limited to about 40–60%. The mix solvent of water and aliphatic ketone was used to prevent the formation of the undesired polymer, resulting in high levulinic acid yield. There is a use of Ambersyst-15 for the production of levulinate ester in water/butanol [90]; however, it was found that this catalyst is not stable when using water/ketone as a solvent. Over the last few years, a modified zeolite has been used as a catalyst in biphasic system to hydrolyze FA at a high concentration to LA before further hydrogenation of LA to GVL [88,91]. GVL has been classified as an important platform species for the biofuel and value-added chemical productions. GVL can be produced by hydrogenation or reduction process of levulinic acid (LA) or its esters. The conversion of LA into GVL can be reached by hydrogenation reaction via two different approaches: catalytic transfer hydrogenation with formic acid or an alcohol as the hydrogen donor or hydrogenation with external hydrogen under high pressure. A number of metal species, for example, Pt, Zr, Pd, Au, Ru, Ni, and Co, have been widely explored for the LA reduction to GVL [7,91]. Among them, Ru-nanoparticles have offered a good catalytic activity. Cervantes and García showed that GVL could be produced from LA successfully after 24 h using Ru nanoparticle catalyst at 130 °C [92]. However, other types of supports catalysts as Cu–Fe and Ni–Cu have also shown a good activity on GVL production from LA [81,93]. Typically, Ru-based materials were reported as efficient noble metal catalysts for conversion of LA or its esters to GVL due to their high activity and selectivity [92]."
8,Pentanediol and cyclopentanone,"3.4 Pentanediol and cyclopentanone Ring opening is interesting approach to convert furfural and its derivatives to other useful chemicals over metal catalysts. The dominant products from the ring opening reaction are alcohols, which can potentially be utilized as biofuel components or co-feedstocks in chemical industry. The conversion of furfural into THFA and then further hydrogenolysis over Rh-supported catalysts like SiO2 could produce pentanediols (PDO) with a good yield. Rh catalysts supported on silica or carbon and modified with Re, Mo or W favored the hydrogenolysis of THFA to 1,5-PDO rather than 1,2-PDO [94,95]. The synthesis of 1,5-PDO from furfural and THFA has been demonstrated via noble metal catalysis. Cyclopentanone is one of the valuable chemicals produced by the furfural rearrangement. The first step was the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol in aqueous solution. Subsequently, furfuryl alcohol was hydrogenated to cyclopentanone through 2-cyclopentenone [96]. Carbon was a suitable support for this reaction as it provided excellent hydrogen sorption capacity [97,98]. The addition of Zn in Cu/CNT catalyst showed selectivity improvement toward cyclopentanone with the furfural conversion of 95% and cyclopenatnone yield of 85% under mild conditions (reaction temperature of 140 °C, H2 pressure of 4 MPa) [97]. High furfural conversion (98%) and cyclopentanone yield (92 mol%) could be obtained over 5%Pd–10%Cu/C catalyst [98]. Moreover, calcined Cu/ZrO2 catalyst at 500 °C gave a significant performance with 100% furfural conversion and cyclopentanone yield of 91% at 150 °C and hydrogen pressure of 15 bar [99]."
9,Catalytic conversion of furfural to C5 chemicals,
10,Overview,"4.1 Overview Furfural-derived C4 chemicals including furan and tetrahydrofuran (THF) are biomass-based biochemical alternative to petrochemicals and can be used in medicine and green polymerization [100–102] (as tabulates in Table 4 .). Furan is produced by removing the carbonyl group from furfural through decarbonylation reaction, and consecutive hydrogenation to tetrahydrofuran (THF) through ring saturation (as shown in Scheme 2 ) [103]."
11,Furan,"4.2 Furan The production of furan can be implemented either in vapor-phase or liquid-phase reaction, however, vapor-phase system using hydrogen gas is more sustainable and technically feasible due to the simple operation, easy separation and recycling of catalyst [67]. Besides, the presence of hydrogen elevated the yield of furan due to the promoted transportation of reactant and product to and from the catalyst surface [26]. For the mechanism of decarbonylation and hydrogenation of furfural, Wang et al. [104] proposed the two different reaction pathways for furan formation through the acyl intermediate. Path A: furfural loses the aldehyde to form the intermediate, while in Path B, the intermediate is produced by removing H atom from the branched chain of furfural. The active phase and reaction conditions including reaction temperature, pressure and reactant contact time are the key factors in manipulating the activity and product selectivity [105]. Table 5 shows the catalytic performance of furfural decarbonylation to furan and hydrogenation to tetrahydrofuran. The precious metals (for examples, Au, Pd, Pt and Ru) have been used as the catalysts in this reaction with high activity in decarbonylation of furfural to furan due to the stronger reactivity in C–C bond scission [101,102,106,107]. Moreover, non-precious metals (e.g., Ni, Fe and Cr) are also active, although the activity are lower than the precious ones [52,95]. Among these, Ni and Pt catalysts exhibited higher selectivity toward furan than pure Cu on which furfuryl alcohol was formed as the main product [108]. In case of bimetallic catalyst, Ni@Pt displayed higher furan selectivity than either pure Pt or pure Ni [109]. The catalyst containing Ni element (Cu/Cr/Ni/Zn/Fe) yielded more furan than Cu/Zn/Al/Ca/Na in the range of 200–300 °C [12]. The doping of potassium (K) on Pd catalyst revealed better activity on furfural decarbonylation (conversion: 100% and furan yield: 99.5% at 260 °C), due to the enhancement of the adsorption strength of hydrogen and the strong interaction between furfural and the active site [101]. In addition, the reaction temperature had an important effect on the decarbonylation activity; furan formation increases as a function of temperature [110]. At the temperature range of 240–260 °C, the highest furan yield (85–99%) was obtained over Pd catalyst [52,101]. Over H-ZSM-5, furfural was fully converted and the yield of furan increased from 16.5 to 30.6% with increasing temperature from 300 to 400 °C. At temperature of 500 °C, the selectivity of furan was decreased to 19.5% due to the coke formation on catalyst surface. Interestingly, the yield of furan increased to the highest value of 64.2% when GHSV was increased from 2412 to 36,000 h−1 [105]. In the liquid-phase system, water can act as an indirect source of hydrogen which gave the impressive selectivity of furan (100 wt%) similar to toluene–water system (4:1 wt ratio); however low furfural conversion was obtained at 35.1 and 3.6 wt%, respectively). Iso-propanol–water (4:1) was the most suitable solvent as the furfural was converted to furan with yield of 82 wt% [111]."
12,Tetrahydrofuran,"4.3 Tetrahydrofuran Tetrahydrofuran (THF) has been used in wide range of applications such as a solvent for many chromatographic techniques, such as, Gel-phase chromatography, a precursor for anionic polymerization in urethane elastomer and fiber manufacture [109,112]. THF is often produced by the hydrogenation of furan (ultimately from furfural) over the same catalyst used for the decarbonylation of furfural [52]. The supported Pd catalysts exhibited complete conversion of furan to THF. However, Ni-based catalysts exhibited more attractive than noble metal ones because of the relatively low cost [67]. The doping of Ni on Pd/SiO2 catalyst showed comparable hydrogenation activity which gave furan conversion of 99% and THF selectivity of 98% in acetic acid medium at 40 °C and 80 bars hydrogen [112]. Moreover, one of the major challenges for improving THF production process is to suppress the rapid coking rate over the catalysts, resulting in the catalyst deactivation and THF yield detraction. The co-feed of a hydrogen donor could help reduce the coke formation during the process while the hydrogen pressure of 60 bars was found to be the optimum value. The typical catalytic reaction for transformation of furfural into C4 and C5 over metal or metal supported catalysts are summarized in Scheme 2. Various reaction mechanisms have been proposed for hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, and decarbonylation."
13,Current status and future outlook of biochemical and biofuel productions,
14,Current status for biochemical and biofuel productions,"5.1 Current status for biochemical and biofuel productions Currently, much research development and demonstration play attention on the ways to produce advanced value-added biochemicals or the specific biofuels from furfural platform in a sustainable step. Various kind of processes accompanied with highly active multifunctional catalysts to make them more efficient have been developed which is an important challenge for the future. The co-process of thermochemical accompanied with advanced hydrolysis in one step for valorization of the raw materials to both biofuels and bio-based products are the kind of processes requirement. A sequential co-production of primary and secondary biofuel chain from lignocellulosic or sugar platform through an integrated biorefinery process in one pot synthesis with an emphasis on new developments is also challenge. The emphasis in batch processes is put on acid hydrolysis-based production systems using homo- or heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, the continuous processes are based on dilute acid hydrolysis in the presence of catalysts. These could possibility scale-up to a large-scale process for furfural and derivative products. For the near future, much research could concern to study chemical reaction pathways, gain enhancement on knowledge concerning the integration of reaction and product separation to improve product yields significantly, improved investigation on kinetics and thermodynamic phase behavior."
15,Future trend for biochemical and biofuel productions,"5.2 Future trend for biochemical and biofuel productions The future achievements of lignocellulosic biomass conversion, especially at commercial scale, is expected to drive circular and bio-economy. The pyrolysis, gasification and hydrolysis along with solid catalysts have been conventional processes which can apply for variable feedstocks. However, different nature of feedstocks can lead to inconsistency in the product behavior. The economy of scale and competitiveness with petroleum and petrochemical refinery are major obstructions to diffuse the technology to new biofuel and biorefinery industry. The scale-up from laboratory scale to pilot- or industrial scale is also a serious problem. Pretreatment and fractionation processes are key steps in biomass utilization. The cost effectiveness and quality of fractionated products have to be optimized while green refinery concept needs to be realized. A standard method for harvesting, collecting and storing biomass should be initiated in order to sustain the quality of raw materials. In the further chemical conversion process, the use of solid catalysts can enhance product yield and selectivity, while the residue content and waste also reduce. The great opportunities existing in the research and development of C5 chemicals produced from furfural are essential to design the catalysts and to control the extent of reactions, which affected the selectivity for furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, tetrahydrofurfuryl, and other relevant products. Liquid phase catalytic transfer hydrogenation under alcohols as hydrogen donors is promising technology because this system is more economical and much safer than one operated under pure hydrogen. In recent years, many researchers have devoted to propose new reaction pathway in order to comprehend the reaction mechanism which would be beneficial for design the new catalysts. However, the product yields for each C5 chemicals over the selective catalysts are moderate in particular to the proposed reaction mechanisms did not clearly understand in the literature due to the complexity of the conversion of furfural to value-added C4 and C5 chemicals. Consequently, the development of multifunctional catalysts with high selectivity and activity toward to furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, tetrahydrofurfuryl, levulinic acid, γ-valerolactone, pentanediol, furan, and cyclopentanone has been considered a key issue for improving overall efficiency in both performance and minimizing the waste generated. Indeed, design and engineering of catalyst active sites and a clear understand of the reaction mechanism will facilitate the research and development of C5 chemicals produced from furfural. It can pave the way to produce other potential biochemical with higher value such as pharmaceuticals, food/feed and active compounds."
16,Trend and technology on furfural/furan research,"5.3 Trend and technology on furfural/furan research Since the first report on furfural production from sugar platform, it has become one of the most topic on research. The catalytic upgrading of furfural/furan-based compounds into drop-in biofuels have attracted significant attention. Several studies have been addressed the process development, catalysts design, and technological system for production furfural lignocellulosic resources or derived its into other value-added biochemicals and specific biofuels. The methodologies for achieving transportation fuels involved aldol condensation with ketones in the presence of acid or base catalysts to form and intermediate condensation product, and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using metal catalysts to convert the long-chain oxy-compounds into the final hydrocarbons. For instance, catalytic processes have included homogeneous catalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, and enzymatic catalysis. The flow sheet analysis was calculated from the relevant publication and patent/patty patent within last ten years. Concerning the trend and relevant research focus on catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic resources to furfural platform. So, what would research could consider for the next topic and trend for research can be supplied from this analysis. An information visualization which is represent a specific area of technology for production of furfural platform by using catalytic systems. This approach can be helpful to monitor the trends of research and relevant innovation. It also helps to provide a macro view of a technology status that would be difficult to see when working with patent documents on a one-to-one basis. According to the publication and patent analysis (Fig. 4 ), numbers of publications and patents increased drastically from the years 2011 till present year. Furan, levulinic acid, furfuryl alcohol, valerolactone, and tetrahydrofuran are among top five in the viewpoint of publication numbers, while the others are very minor. For patents, tetrahydrofuran clearly shows a promising number of patents filing around the world. Furan, levulinic acid, and pentanediol have become more and more important biochemicals as we can see a rapid growth in patent numbers during the last five years (2015–2019). In should be noted that the analytic data of furan would be overestimated since in many cases 5-HMF, furfural or other furanic compounds are referred to as furan in the publications and patents. In 2019, the publication percentage of heterogeneous or solid catalysts that were related to those biochemicals was around 43.9% compared with 16.0% of enzyme catalysts and 40.0% of homogeneous catalysts. The patent percentage of heterogeneous or solid catalysts (67.3%) was also clearly higher than those from enzymatic catalysts (6.4%). It should be noted that the patent percentage of heterogeneous catalysts in 2019 is significantly higher than the ten-year average data (2011–2019) at 57.0%. Although the developed technology is majorly based on enzyme and bioprocess, the rapid growth of the heterogeneous catalysts for those biochemical productions indicates that the heterogeneous catalysis would be a promising approach for biochemical production due to its simple processing, high performance, reusability, and flexible operating window."
