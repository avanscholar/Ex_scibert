0,Introduction,"Biomass is a renewable energy that poses a promising future in certain areas or scenarios, although it is not presently as competitive as the other sources of energy [1]. Hydrogen production is one of the ways to use biomass. Hydrogen is a kind of clear energy with good application prospects [2]. Biomass gasification is an effective way to carry out hydrogen production because the water gas shift reaction that occurs in the gasification phase can produce large amounts of hydrogen [3]. The addition of a catalyst during the gasification process can yield high-purity hydrogen under a suitable condition. Corella found that the biomass gasification in a fluidized bed with pure steam can generate 60 vol.% in a dry basis and that the H2 rich gas can increase to 70–80 vol.% H2 using a CO2 sorbent in the gasifier bed [4]. One of the main challenges in the thermochemical gasification process is the inducing of pyrolysis and endothermic gas reforming reactions while minimizing energy input into reactors, which should be economical to construct and operate [5]. The simple and effective method mainly provides heat by burning or exothermic reaction. The gasification process that provides heat by burning can be divided into two kinds, combustion and gasification furnaces. Both are clearly distant from each other, with the heat transfer ensured by circulating a heat carrier between the two vessels [6]. Other auto-thermal or direct heating processes are those where both reactions are performed simultaneously in one single common vessel [7–10]. These two kinds of technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages [11–19]. The gasification process is easily affected by the uneven energy when the high-temperature granular media are transferring between the two beds, during which energy loses. In order to meet the energy needs of gasification, combustion reactor requires higher temperature to compensate the heat loss. Otherwise, the tar content is higher than normal. It is compulsory to use heatproof material during the process, which generates a continuous producing gas. The single-bed gasification technology operates in the same reactor, all the energy of combustion can provide to the gasification stage, which proves to be better for tar cracking, and also can effectively prevent sintering of the raw materials in gasification process. This technology exhibits the characteristics of stability and reliability in the industrialization process. In addition, the gasification intensity and gas production rate of single-bed gasification technology are higher than those of the double bed technology. However, the deficiency is that it cannot produce gas in a continuous way. Based on a new process called the Single Fluidized Bed Gasification Process of Jiangsu University, this paper presents a single fluidized bed biomass gasification catalyzed two-step hydrogen production line. Given the analysis results of the biomass gasification reaction mechanism for hydrogen production, coal combustion is used to provide energy for the gasification process [20–22]. Coke is a product of the combustion process, and the biomass is added in the gasification phase to serve as the gasification material during gasification. Considering the balance of material, heat, and thermochemical reaction, the thermodynamic model of this process was established. The simulated data were collected through varied parameters. The results provide theoretical support for efficiently improving the catalytic hydrogen production from biomass."
1,Single fluidized bed biomass gasification catalyzed two-step hydrogen production process,"The technology divides the production process into combustion and gasification phases in one gasifier. Through two pairs of air-reversing valves (Fig. 1 ), namely, 1–1 and 1–2 valves and 2–1 and 2–2 valves, two working channels are formed. During combustion, the first pair of valves opens to supply air, coal, and the catalyst, dolomite or CaCO3, to the gasifier, during the process the coal and the catalyst are combusted in fluid state, and the bed temperature rapidly increases. The main ingredients of the catalyst CaCO3 are calcined into CaO. When the temperature rises to the preprogrammed temperature, the air supply ceased and the corresponding valves are closed. Meanwhile the second pair of valves opens successively to supply steam and biomass to the gasifier, thus inducing the high-temperature materials to undergo pyrolysis gasification reaction with steam in a fluid state. This produces hydrogen-rich gas, and CaO becomes CaCO3 through the reaction with CO2. Given that the reaction is of a strong endothermic nature, the bed temperature rapidly decreases. When the temperature drops to the predetermined value, the water vapor supply ceases, and the gasification process ends. The reversing valves then return to the combustion phase. Catalyst recycling is generated when the catalyst is calcined in the combustion phase and regenerated in the gasification phase. Both phases occur automatically by controlling the two pairs of reversing valves dominated by the predetermined temperatures (Fig. 1). The technology has the following features: 1. In the same gasifier, the combustion and gasification can be easily distinguished one thing from another, so there is no need to use oxygen to make air and water obtain the gasification reaction for pure water vapor. Thus hydrogen-rich, low tar (General < l mg/m3) of high-quality synthetic gas can be obtained and the investment and production cost for biomass synthesized alcohol ether fuel will be reduced greatly. 2. Replaces inertia particles which powder coal and makes it gasified together with biomass, thus improves the fluidization performance of the fluidized bed as well as the gasification performance of the biomass. 3. Raw materials have wide adaptability and availability for combination. One can set up two feeders for the fluidized bed biomass water gasifiers, one for biomass and the other for coal. In the process of combustion high-carbon and poor-activity coal will be added so that the temperature of the gasifier will be increased to form a high-temperature carbon layer. Biomass will be supplied in the gasification process to facilitate the rapid gasification. This combination will decrease the tar content of the gas and is conducive to the comprehensive utilization of resources. 4. Coal is the main energy resource in China’s energy structure. Since biomass supply is under the influence of season change, coal can be in replacement when biomass materials are in shortage. 5. The production capacity of the same size fluidized bed gasifier is lower than that of the serial gasifiers .At present the highest productive capacity of the gasifier is 10 t of biomass per hour, 240 t per day and 86,000 t per year, which can fully meet the requirement of the scale production of biomass. This technology uses corn stalks as raw materials, and the proportion between corn stalk and coal is 4 to 1, S/B ≈ 0.9–1.2 h, gas production will be divided into: CO + H2 > 75%, H2/CO = 1.0–2.0, CH4 < 4%, Tar < 1.0 mg/m3, gas production rate:1.0–1.4 m3/kg."
2,Modeling formation and solution,"As mentioned above, the co-gasification process consists of two separate stages, i.e. combustion and gasification, in a gasifier. In this section, a model describing the process is going to be elucidated in details. The purpose of coal burning in the combustion stage is to provide not only energy source but also the leftover char for the gasification stage. The combustion stage can be simulated by a coal combustion model which aims to predict the released energy during the stage and the amount of residual char at the end of the stage. The gasification stage is simulated based on the mass and energy balance. The residual char after the combustion stage is regarded as part of the gasification material in the gasification stage which links the combustion and the gasification models. According to the operation conditions as described in Section 2, a series of parameters are set as constants in the model as listed in Table 1 . The fluidized bed temperature, H2O/C, Ca/C and coal/biomass (mass ratio) are regarded as the variable inputs. Wood and coal are used as raw materials in the process. Tables 2 and 3 list the proximate and ultimate analyses respectively. It can be seen that the wood has considerably higher volatile matter (70–90%-wt) than coal. After the model formatting, we use these date to calculate the model, and the calculation flow chat is as Fig. 2 . The results will be analyzed in the next article."
3,Combustion model,"3.1 Combustion model 3.1.1 Coal pyrolytic model Merrick David’s coal pyrolytic model [25] is used to calculate the volatile components of coal. The model is based on the element balance method using the estimated precipitation of volatile components. Moreover, the product of the volatile components is assumed to be formed by CO, CO2, H2, H2O, CH4, N2, H2S, and the char as the solid product. The relationship of the different components of the produced gas, char yield of the coal, raw material base element, and values of Cdaf, Hdaf, Odaf, Ndaf, and Sdaf can be expressed by the element equilibrium matrix equation as follows: [ ω ( C ) 0.75 0.4286 0.2727 0 0 0 0 ω ( H ) 0.25 0 0 1 0.1111 0 0.0588 ω ( O ) 0 0.5714 0.7273 0 0.8889 0 0 ω ( N ) 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ω ( S ) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.9412 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ] [ Char CH 4 CO CO 2 H 2 H 2 O N 2 H 2 S ] = [ C daf H daf O daf N daf S daf x 1 4 H daf x 2 1.75 O daf x 3 1.375 O daf ] where the ω(C), ω(H), ω(O), ω(N), ω(S) is the concentration of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur of the coal coke. 3.1.2 Char combustion modeling The basic assumptions are: (1) The diameter of the char particle keeps constant (2) The char combustion is limited by both external mass transfer and by chemical kinetics, (3) The products of char combustion are CO and CO2. Thus, the char combustion reaction equation can be expressed as follows: C + 1 / ϕ O 2 → ( 2 − 2 / ϕ ) CO + ( 2 / ϕ − 1 ) CO 2 In this equation, ϕ is the mechanism of factors which has been confirmed that ϕ is a function of temperature, particle size, and char type. In general, the smaller particle size and the higher reaction temperature are conducive to the generation of CO. On the contrary, they help in the generation of CO2. In the model, Ross and Davidson expression is used to calculate ϕ. The reaction rate of coke combustion is calculated by the following expression: ⅆ x / ⅆ t = K c C O 2 where dx/dt is the unit surface area reaction rate, C O 2 is the main flow of the oxygen molar concentration, and Kc is the reaction rate constant. K c = 1 1 K s + 1 ϕ K dff where, Ks is the surface reaction rate; K dff is the gas diffusion rate constant. Ks can be calculated as follows: K s = 596 ∗ T p ∗ e [ − 1800 / T p ] where Tp is the surface temperature of the coke particle. The surface temperature of the char particles is calculated by the heat balance of the char particles. The specific method is as follows: Because the bed has good mixing characteristics of particles and large gas–solid contact area between particles and the bed heat transfer coefficient is relatively large, thus only the general chemical reaction and solid phase heat transfer exist, is regarded as being whole bed temperature uniform. However, in a strong endothermic reaction process that includes the solid phase combustion and gasification of coals, the temperature of particles and the bed temperature are pointed out to be different up to 200 °C [26]. Therefore, the simulation of fluidized bed combustion and gasification must consider the heat transfer between the particles and the bed. As to the calculation of temperature of reaction particles, numerous scholars have experimented with the bed and the heat balance between the particles. Use the particles as the object of heat balance, the heat balance equation as follows: π 6 d p , t ρ p c p ⅆ T p , t ⅆ t = Q rad + Q con + k Q c where, Q endothermic is positive, loss heat is negative. For the radiation heat transfer, using the following formula: Q rad = ɛ r δ π d p , t 2 [ ( T p , t + 273 ) 4 − ( T b + 273 ) 4 ] Convection heat transfer can be expressed as: Q con = α t π d p , t 2 ( T p , t − T b ) where, αt is the heat transfer coefficient between the particles and the bed. On the calculation of Nusselt number of convective heat transfer, different scholars have proposed a number of formulas to calculate, here we use the following formula: N u p = h p d p k g = 2 + 0.6 R e p 1 / 2 P r 1 / 3 where, R e p = d p u ρ g / μ g is the particle Reynolds number, Pr = C p g μ g / k g is the Prandtl number. K dff can be calculated as follows: K dff = s h D g d p where sh is Sherwood number; Dg is oxygen diffusion coefficient."
4,Gasification model,"3.2 Gasification model The main reactions in the gasification stage are as follows: (1) C + H 2 O → CO + H 2 , ⋯⋯ Δ H = + 118.628 kJ / mol (2) C + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 2 H 2 , ⋯⋯ Δ H = + 75.114 kJ / mol (3) C + 2 H 2 → CH 4 , ⋯⋯ Δ H = − 75.24 kJ / mol (4) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 , ⋯⋯ Δ H = 224.8 kJ / mol (5) CO + H 2 O → H 2 + CO 2 , ⋯⋯ Δ H = − 43.514 kJ / mol (6) CaO ( s ) + CO 2 ( g ) → CaCO 3 ( s ) , ⋯⋯ Δ H = − 181.4 kJ / mol (7) CaCO 3 ( s ) → CaO ( s ) + CO 2 ( g ) , ⋯⋯ Δ H = 170.5 kJ / mol (8) C + CO 2 → 2 CO , ⋯⋯ Δ H = + 162.142 kJ / mol (9) CaO ( s ) + H 2 O ( g ) → Ca ( OH ) 2 ( s ) , ⋯⋯ Δ H = − 96.6 kJ / mol A global chemical reaction can be used to describe reactions 1-9: (10) q C + p CH a O b + n q CaO + m q H 2 O ( g ) → x 1 H 2 + x 2 CO + x 3 CO 2 + x 4 H 2 O + x 5 CH 4 + x 6 CaCO 3 where q is the amount of char obtained from the combustion stage at different combustion conditions; p is the amount of the biomass; n is the value of Ca/C; m is the value of H2O/C. The x 1 – x 6 represents the values of gases, respectively. The parameters in Eq. (10) are calculated as following: (1) The approximate formula CH a O b (a = 0.136, b = 0.69) of the biomass is obtained according to the elemental and proximate analyses. (2) From the proximate analysis, the amount of char produced by coal and used as raw material during gasification is obtained. (3) Given the mass balance of the material in the fluidized bed, the balanced equation of carbon, hydrogen, calcium, and oxygen is formulated. More details are given below. Carbon balance x 2 + x 3 + x 5 + x 6 = C biomass + C left = C total Hydrogen balance 2 x 1 + 2 x 4 + 4 x 5 = 2 m C total + H biomass Calcium balance n C total = x 6 Oxygen balance x 2 + 2 x 3 + x 4 + 3 x 6 = O biomass + m C total + n C total where Cbiomass, Cleft, Ctot al is the carbon amount of the biomass, the leftover carbon in the combustion stage and the total amount of carbon separately; Hbiomass is the amount of hydrogen of biomass; and the Obiomass is the amount of oxygen of biomass. (4) Finally, according to a method in the independent component analysis, two compensatory equations were selected from the possible reactive equations. Thus, the amount and concentration of each composition is calculated by solving the following equations. (fd11) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 , Δ H = − 43.514 kJ / mol (fd12) C + 2 H 2 → CH 4 , Δ H = − 75.24 kJ / mol The equilibrium equation is as follows: (5) x 3 × x 1 = K 1 × x 2 × x 4 (6) x 5 = K 2 × x 1 × x 1 In the equations, we calculate the K 1 and K 2 as follows: log K 1 = 3384 T − 5.957 log T + 1.86 × 10 − 3 T − 1.095 × 10 − 7 T 2 + 11.79 ln K 2 = 5025.163 T − 0.0936 ln T + 1.4555 × 10 − 3 T − 2.4887 × 10 − 7 T 2 − 5.28947"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Validation of the simulated model,"4.1 Validation of the simulated model Fig. 3 compares the rate of producing hydrogen as a function of the ratio of H2O/C. In the simulation, it is assumed that the fluidized bed temperature is constant at 850 °C and Ca/C ratio is 0.5, while the ratio of H2O/C is increased gradually from 1.2 to 1.8 in the model. In both cases, the pressure is 1 atm. Fig. 3 shows that the simulated results are generally in agreement with the experimental results. The rate of producing hydrogen rises with the increases of the H2O/C because it can increase the reaction of (1) and (2). The errors between simulations and experimental results amounts with the increase of H2O/C which can be attributed to the simplification for the model."
7,Effect of coal/biomass (mass ratio),"4.2 Effect of coal/biomass (mass ratio) Fig. 4 shows the simulated concentration of the produced gases as a function of the ratio of coal/biomass under the conditions of the fluidized bed temperature at 800 °C, H2O/C = 1.8 and Ca/C = 0.5. The H2 concentration reaches a peak at the coal/biomass = 1/4. The simulation indicates that the total amount of the residual char after the combustion stage together with the biomass char makes reactions (1) and (2) dominate the gasification process, which generates the highest amount of H2 when coal/biomass = 1/4. The simulation matches the experimental results very well. In the following calculations, the coal/biomass is set as 1/4."
8,Effect of temperature,"4.3 Effect of temperature Figs. 5 and 6 show the effect of the fluidized bed temperature on the concentration of the produced gas under the conditions of H2O/C = 1.8, Ca/C = 0.5 and coal/biomass = 1/4. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the concentration of CH4 decreases with the increase of the temperature because reaction (3) is an exothermic reaction which limits the formation of CH4. The concentrations of H2 and CO augments with the increase of the temperature, indicating which fluidized bed temperature play a very important role in the biomass gasification process. It coincides with the concept that it needs enough energy for the gasification process. Moreover, the high fluidized bed temperature enhances the endothermic reactions of (1), (2) and (8) and increases the yield of H2 and CO. Meantime other reactions that consume the H2 and CO are inhibited. The concentrations of H2 and CO increase noticeably with the rise of the temperature when the fluidized bed temperature is below 850 °C, while they almost level off despite the further increase of the temperature. Therefore, it is recommended that the fluidized bed temperature should be in the range of between 800 °C and 850 °C when we want to get more hydrogen."
9,Effect of calcium/coke,"4.4 Effect of calcium/coke Figs. 7 and 8 present the effect of calcium/coke on the concentration of the produced gas. It is easily observed that H2 concentration increases while CO2 concentration decreases a little bit with the increase of Ca/C. With the increase of Ca/C, reaction (6) is intensified meaning more CO2 is absorbed which enhances H2 concentration. CO concentration decreases with the decrease of Ca/C because reaction (8) becomes weak by the low CO2 concentration. Meantime, low CO2 concentration also increases the generation of H2 by reaction (5). When the reaction reaches balance the concentration of hydrogen will be more than the condition of high CO2. Fig. 8 also shows that CH4 concentration increases with the increase of Ca/C which can be attributed that reaction is intensified while reaction (4) becomes weak by the high H2 concentration. It can be concluded from calculation that when the value of Ca/C is over 0.5, the content of CO is not right. It deserves further efforts regarding this field .In this paper the Ca/C is set as 0.5."
10,Effect of steam/coke,"4.5 Effect of steam/coke Figs. 9 and 10 show the effect of steam/coke on the concentration of the produced gas under the conditions of the fluidized bed temperature of 850 °C, Ca/C = 0.5 and coal/biomass = 1/4. CO concentration decreases with the increase of H2O/C. The more the amount of steam, the severer the reactions (1), (2) and (5). The increase of CO2 concentration is attributed to the decrease of CO by reaction (1). The high H2 concentration results in the high CH4 concentration by reaction (3). The detailed reactions cannot be found but these results is benefit for the experiment next. In this study, considering the yield of H2 and cost of production, the optimal value of steam/coke is found to be 1.8."
11,Conclusions,"The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The highest hydrogen production takes place when the ratio of coal/biomass (mass ratio) is 1/4. (2) The volume fraction of hydrogen augments with the increase of the fluidized bed temperature when the temperature is set in the range of 800–850 °C. The optimized gasification temperature therefore is within this range. (3) The molar concentration of hydrogen increases with the increase of steam/coke. Considering both the production cost and energy loss, the value of steam/coke equal to 1.8 is most desirable. (4) The H2 concentration grows gradually with the increase of calcium/coke. When the value of calcium/coke is over 0.5, its effect can be unnoticeable. Thus, the optimal value of calcium/coke is considered 0.5."
