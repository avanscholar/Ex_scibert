0,Introduction,"Greenhouse gas emissions and the associated climate change are one of the greatest challenges of today. The transportation sector accounts for around one third of total energy consumption worldwide and is particularly one of the largest sources of CO2 emissions (Lin and Xie, 2014). The second largest producer of CO2 emissions, for example in China, is the chemical industry (Lin and Long, 2016). Gas fermentation with synthesis gas is in many ways a promising approach for alternative production of platform chemicals or fuels (Daniell et al., 2012). The advantage of gas fermentation with acetogenic bacteria is that in addition to the gasification of biomass, waste gas streams from steel industry can also be used directly, which reduces CO2 emissions (Dürre and Eikmanns, 2015). Besides the production of natural short-chain products such as acetate, butyrate, acetone, ethanol, or butanol, which achieve a low market price, the production of medium-chained acids and alcohols, so called “high value” chemicals, is of enormous economic importance (Molitor et al., 2016; Tschaplinski et al., 2019). In addition, metabolic engineering has already expanded the product portfolio of acetogenic bacteria to such an extent that they form a promising alternative to conventional crude oil-based production of platform chemicals or fuel additives (Dürre, 2016; Humphreys and Minton, 2018). In this study, the production of C6 compounds with acetogenic bacteria was investigated. Hexanoate can be used as platform chemical for the organic synthesis of fine chemicals or in medicine, but is also used in the perfume industry (Šalić et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2015; Reddy et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019) and in the food industry as a precursor for aromas and flavors (Kenealy et al., 1995; Desbois, 2012). It is also possible to use hexanoate indirectly as a diesel or jet fuel substitute after conversion by organic chemistry (Levy et al., 1981; Spirito et al., 2014). Hexanol has a significantly higher energy density than short-chain alcohols such as ethanol or butanol, which makes it particularly suitable for use as a fuel additive in diesel engines (De Poures et al., 2017). Like hexanoic acid, hexanol is also suitable as a platform chemical for the production of jet fuel (Harvey and Meylemans, 2014). The medium-chained acids and alcohols are mainly obtained from fossil raw materials by petrochemical production (Spirito et al., 2014; Cavalcante et al., 2017). Alternatively, hexanoate can also be produced by microorganisms such as Clostridium kluyveri (Barker and Taha, 1942), Megasphaera elsdenii (Marounek et al., 1989), or Ruminococcaceae bacterial strain CPB6 (Zhu et al., 2017). In addition, there is the possibility of producing medium-chain carboxylic acids and alcohols with mixed cultures (Molitor et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; He et al., 2018) or co-cultures (Diender et al., 2016; Richter et al., 2016). However, the use of mixed cultures has the disadvantage that it is very difficult to determine the exact composition of the inoculum. The reproducibility of such a fermentation does not reach the same extent as in the case with monocultures (Harrison, 1978). Also, the volumetric production rates and titers in monocultures are usually higher and easier to improve than in mixed cultures (Richter et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Kantzow et al., 2015; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a; Molitor et al., 2017). The use of co-cultures is often associated with lower product yield. In addition, a small shift in pH, for example, quickly limits the metabolism of one strain (Diender et al., 2016). Among acetogenic bacteria that can be used for gas fermentation, there are two strains described capable of C6 compound production. Clostridium carboxidivorans and the closely related bacterial strain Clostridium scatologenes can both produce hexanoate. In addition to hexanoate, C. carboxidivorans is also able to produce the corresponding alcohol hexanol under autotrophic conditions (Küsel et al., 2000; Phillips et al., 2015; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). However, genes encoding the enzymes essential for strain development and further optimization of C6 compound production and the underlying metabolic pathway have not been identified in C. carboxidivorans so far (Fig. S1; Bruant et al., 2010). It is still unclear how chain elongation works in acetogenic bacteria and which enzymes are responsible (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b). The term chain elongation describes a possible way to convert short-chain acids or alcohols to medium-chained ones (Liu et al., 2017; Modestra et al., 2020). In the C4 compound-producing strain Clostridium acetobutylicum, enzymes that are essential for the formation of butyryl-CoA from acetoacetyl-CoA could be identified. Respective genes are arranged in a cluster and form a bcs operon (butyryl-CoA synthesis; Boynton et al., 1996; Inui et al., 2008). It is postulated that the further elongation of butyryl-CoA to hexanoyl-CoA takes place by reverse β-oxidation (Boynton et al., 1996). Enzymes involved in butyrate formation in C. acetobutylicum could also be detected in C. kluyveri. There, respective genes are clustered, too, and it was postulated that a second set of genes is involved in the formation of hexanoyl-CoA (Seedorf et al., 2008). In this study, we focused on the identification of genes encoding enzymes, which are essential for chain elongation in acetogenic bacteria to examine the metabolic pathway. Based on the comparison of the gene sequences of different bacterial strains, an attempt was made to enable a heterologous production of C6 compounds from synthesis gas by the construction of a recombinant acetogenic strain. For this purpose, it was necessary to transfer genes from C. carboxidivorans possibly essential for chain elongation into the acetogenic model organism Acetobacterium woodii. This was achieved by construction of a hexanoyl-CoA synthesis (hcs) plasmid system. The genes were also introduced separately into the C4 compound-producing strain Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum for a more detailed analysis. All resulting recombinant strains were characterized by fermentation and allowed to postulate a model of the metabolic pathway for C6 compound production in C. carboxidivorans."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and media,"2.1 Bacterial strains and media The bacterial type strains used in this work were obtained from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Brunswick, Germany): Clostridium carboxidivorans P7 DSM15243, Acetobacterium woodii WB1 DSM1030 (AWO), Clostridium drakei SL1 DSM12750, Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4(HMT) DSM14923 (CSAC), and Clostridium scatologenes DSM757 (Table 1 ). All strains were cultivated under strictly anaerobic conditions. C. carboxidivorans and C. scatologenes were cultivated at 37 °C, A. woodii, C. drakei, and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum were cultivated at 30 °C (Balch et al., 1977; Keis et al., 2001; Liou et al., 2005). Strains were preserved using lyophilization and afterwards stored at 8°C. C. carboxidivorans, C. drakei, and C. scatologenes were cultivated in modified Tanner medium (Tanner et al., 1993), which contained (per liter) 20 g MES buffer, 0.5 g yeast extract, 1 g cysteine hydrochloride, 2.5 g NH4Cl, 2 g NaCl, 0.5 g MgSO4 x 7 H2O, 0.25 g KCl, 0.25 g KH2PO4, 0.1 g CaCl2 x 2 H2O, 1 mg resazurin, 10 mL vitamin solution, and 10 mL trace element solution. The initial pH of the medium was set to 6.2. An atmosphere containing 80 % N2 and 20 % CO2 (pressurized to 100 kPa; MTI IndustrieGase AG, Neu-Ulm, Germany) was used for growth with fructose, which was added to a final concentration of 40 mM after autoclaving. For autotrophic growth, fructose was omitted and the gas phase was replaced with synthesis gas (50 % CO, 45 % H2, 5 % CO2, pressurized to 100 kPa; MTI IndustrieGase AG, Neu-Ulm, Germany) after autoclaving. A. woodii was cultivated in modified DSMZ medium 135 as described by Hoffmeister et al. (2016). For heterotrophic growth, fructose was added to 50 mL medium to a final concentration of 40 mM (gas phase 80 % N2 + 20 % CO2, as mentioned before) after autoclaving. Autotrophic growth experiments were carried out replacing the gas phase by a H2 + CO2 gas mixture (66.7 % H2 + 33.3 % CO2, pressurized to 100 kPa; MTI IndustrieGase AG, Neu-Ulm, Germany) after autoclaving. Heterotrophic and autotrophic growth experiments were carried out with biological triplicates. Gene expression in the strains AWO [pTet_hcs1] and AWO [pTet_hcs2] was induced by adding 300 ng/mL anhydrotetracycline. C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum was cultivated using CGM (clostridial growth medium; Wiesenborn et al., 1988). Heterotrophic growth experiments with C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum were conducted with optimized minimal medium (OMS; Standfest, 2013 per liter: glucose x H2O 40 g, MES buffer 20 g, [NH4]2SO4 2 g, KH2PO4 0.55 g, K2HPO4 0.42 g, FeSO4 x 7 H2O 45 mg, MgSO4 x 7 H2O 200 mg, NaCl 10 mg, CaCl2 x 2 H2O 10 mg, Na2MoO4 x 2 H2O 10 mg, MnSO4 x H2O 10 mg, Na2S2O4 500 mg, thiamine-HCl 2 mg, 4-aminobenzoic acid 2 mg, biotin 0.1 mg, resazurin 1 mg) with an initial pH of 7.3 and a gas phase containing 80 % N2 + 20 % CO2, as mentioned before. In CSAC [pTet_hcs1_C] gene expression was induced by adding 300 ng/mL anhydrotetracycline. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue MRF' (Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA)) was used for plasmid cloning. All E. coli experiments, unless otherwise stated, were performed in 50 mL medium in 125-mL Müller-Krempel flasks (Müller & Krempel AG, Bülach, Switzerland). If necessary, thiamphenicol (15 μg/mL) or clarithromycin (5 μg/mL) was used as antibiotic and added to the medium. E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ was cultivated under aerobic conditions in modified LB (Luria-Bertani) medium (per liter: tryptone 10 g, NaCl 10 g, yeast extract 5 g) at 37 °C with shaking (Bertani, 1951)."
3,Comparison and visualization of bacterial genome sequences,"2.2 Comparison and visualization of bacterial genome sequences Bacterial genome sequences were compared using the Integrated Microbial Genomes Expert Review (IMG ER; https://img.jgi.doe.gov/) together with the CLC Main Workbench V7.6.4 (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). These tools were also used for in silico cloning. tBLASTx comparison was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Visualization of the tBLASTx comparison was done with Easyfig software application V2.2.2 (Beatson Microbial Genomics Lab, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia)."
4,RNA isolation from C. carboxidivorans,"2.3 RNA isolation from C. carboxidivorans RNA isolation from C. carboxidivorans was carried out with guanidinium thiocyanate (TRIzol). 50 mL of a C. carboxidivorans culture was harvested (4500 g, 4 °C, 10 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the sediment was suspended in 600 μL lysis buffer. The lysis buffer was prepared freshly before use by dissolving 20 mg lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany) in 1 mL TSE buffer (per 0.25 liter: 62.5 g sucrose, 4.65 g EDTA, 1.5 g Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). After 5 min incubation at 37 °C, 1 mL ice-cold TRIzol™ RNA Isolation Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) was added and the solution was carefully homogenized. Then, 0.3 mL Roti® chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) were added and the solution was mixed vigorously. After an incubation of 3 min at room temperature (RT), a centrifugation step was carried out (12,000 g, 4 °C, 15 min). Then, the upper aqueous phase was carefully removed and 0.5 mL ice-cold isopropanol (Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) were added. The mixture was incubated at RT for 10 min. After centrifugation (12,000 g, 4 °C, 10 min), the supernatant was removed and discarded. 1 mL of ice-cold 70 % (v/v) ethanol (Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added to the pellet. This was followed by a final centrifugation step (4500 g, 4 °C, 4 min), in which the supernatant was discarded. The isolated RNA was dried at RT overnight and the sediment was dissolved in 22 μL Ambion® DEPC-treated H2Odemin. (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) afterwards. RNA was stored at −80 °C until further use."
5,RT-PCR with RNA from C. carboxidivorans,"2.4 RT-PCR with RNA from C. carboxidivorans To remove DNA contamination previous to RT-PCR, any remaining DNA was digested after RNA isolation using TURBO DNA-free™ Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA). DNA digestion was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity and concentration of RNA isolates were measured using the Invitrogen Qubit 4 fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA). cDNA synthesis from isolated RNA was carried out using the Maxima H minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) and specific primers (Table 2 ) for hcs cluster 1 (Fig. 2-B) and hcs cluster 2 (Fig. 2-C). Afterwards, PCR was performed with the resulting cDNA using ReproFast DNA Polymerase (Genaxxon Bioscience GmbH, Ulm, Germany). As positive controls, the RT-PCR was performed in parallel with isolated RNA from the E. coli strains harboring the plasmids pPta_hcs1 or pPta_hcs2. cDNA synthesis was set up once without reverse transcriptase (-RT), as negative control. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis."
6,Isolation and purification of genomic and plasmid DNA,"2.5 Isolation and purification of genomic and plasmid DNA Isolation of genomic DNA from Gram-positive bacteria was performed using the MasterPure™ Gram Positive DNA Purification Kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Plasmid DNA from E. coli was isolated using the Zyppy™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit (ZYMO Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). This kit was also used to isolate plasmid DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. However, an additional step for cell lysis was added to the protocol. Thus, 50 μL lysozyme (20 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany) were added to the suspended cell sediment and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. For cloning, double-stranded DNA fragments were cut out of agarose gels with a scalpel after separation by gel electrophoresis. Purification of DNA was carried out using the Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit (ZYMO Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The DNA Clean & Concentrator-5-Kit™ (ZYMO Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) was used for purification and concentration of double-stranded DNA fragments amplified by PCR according to the manufacturer's instruction."
7,Construction of the modular hexanoyl-CoA synthesis plasmid system,"2.6 Construction of the modular hexanoyl-CoA synthesis plasmid system All plasmids used in this study were constructed using the In-Fusion® HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio USA Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) and are listed in Table 1. All plasmids are based on the modular hexanoyl-CoA synthesis plasmid system (Fig. S2), which consists of the vector backbone of pMTL83151 (Heap et al., 2009) with repH, catP, ColE1, and traJ. hcs Clusters 1 (Ccar_22805-Ccar22810) and 2 (Ccar_01430-Ccar_01436) were amplified performing PCR with genomic DNA isolated from C. carboxidivorans and using specific primers with overhangs (Table 2) designed with the NEBuilder® Assembly Tool (New England Biolabs® Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) and the CloneAmp™ HiFi PCR Premix (Takara Bio USA Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Additionally, a promoter sequence was cloned into pMTL83151 previous to cloning the hcs clusters using standard molecular cloning techniques (Green and Sambrook, 2012). Either the constitutively active promoter P pta-ack from C. ljungdahlii (Hoffmeister et al., 2016) or the tightly regulated promoter P tet previously described by Ransom et al. (2015) were used. Before introducing the hcs gene clusters 1 or 2, plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes Eco81I/NheI (plasmids with P pta-ack ) or XhoI/NheI (plasmids with P tet ) purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, Ma, USA). The In-Fusion® reaction for introduction of hcs cluster 1 or 2 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thereby, four hexanoyl-CoA synthesis plasmids pPta_hcs1, pPta_hcs2, pTet_hcs1, and pTet_hcs2 could be obtained and verified by sequencing. Construction and cloning was performed in E. coli XL1-Blue MRF'. Afterwards, plasmids were isolated and subsequently transferred into A. woodii for investigating potential production of C6 compounds. Genes from hcs cluster 1 from C. carboxidivorans were further investigated by transferring the plasmids pPta_hcs1 and pTet_hcs1 into the C4 compound-producing strain C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum. For this purpose, the antibiotic resistance cassette catP had to be replaced by ermB (from pMTL82151; Heap et al., 2009), since several transformation approaches were unsuccessful and two genes in the genome of C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum were identified as encoding potential chloramphenicol O-acetyltransferases type A (Cspa_c32480; Cspa_c34740). The exchange was achieved using restriction digestion (FseI/PmeI; New England Biolabs® Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) and ligation (T4-DNA-Ligase; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). This resulted in the two plasmids pPta_hcs1_C and pTet_hcs1_C (Fig. S3). Additionally, the genes thl, crt, hbd, and bcd (including etfB and etfA) from hcs cluster 1 were cloned separately into plasmids harboring the P pta-ack promoter. The modular hexanoyl-CoA plasmid system was extended using the In-Fusion® HD Cloning Kit with specific primers (Table 2). This resulted in the four plasmids pthl, pcrt, phbd, and pbcd_etfAB. All six plasmids were verified by sequencing and transferred after isolation from E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ into C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum for further analysis."
8,Electroporation procedure for A. woodii and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum,"2.7 Electroporation procedure for A. woodii and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum Electroporation of A. woodii and verification of the corresponding recombinant strains was carried out according to the protocol previously described by Hoffmeister et al. (2016). Electroporation of C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum was performed using a slightly modified protocol described by Flitsch (2015). First, a culture of C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum was incubated in 5 mL CGM overnight at 30 °C. Afterwards, the culture was used to inoculate 50 mL of CGM to an OD600 of 0.1 which in turn was incubated at 30 °C. After the culture reached an OD600 of 1.2, cells were harvested under anaerobic conditions (2200 g, 4 °C, 10 min) and the supernatant discarded. The sediment was washed with 20 mL anaerobic electroporation buffer A (per 0.5 liter: 51.3 g sucrose, 0.3 g NaH2PO4 x 2 H2O, 53.3 mg Na2HPO4 x 2 H2O, 101.6 mg MgCl2 x 6 H2O). After centrifugation (2200 g, 4 °C, 10 min), the sediment was suspended in 1 mL electroporation buffer B (electroporation buffer A without MgCl2 x 6 H2O). 1 μg of plasmid DNA was added to 200 μL of competent cells and the solution was incubated on ice for 5 min. Electroporation was performed at 1.5 kV, 200 Ω, and 25 μF in electroporation cuvettes (Biozym Scientific GmbH, Oldendorf, Germany) with a gap of 2 mm. Cells were then placed in 1 mL of CGM for regeneration and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, 200 μL of transformation solution were plated on CGM agar plates with the corresponding antibiotic. Plates were incubated at 30 °C until colonies appeared. 5 mL of CGM with antibiotic were inoculated with individual colonies and incubated at 30 °C. Growing strains were verified by isolating genomic DNA and sequencing the DNA."
9,Analytics,"2.8 Analytics 2.8.1 Optical density and pH measurement Optical density was measured at 600 nm (OD600) in a 1.6-mL semi-micro cuvette with a layer thickness of 1 cm (Sarstedt AG & Co., Nümbrecht, Germany) in an Ultrospec™ 3100 pro photometer (Amersham Bioscience Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Samples were diluted with water to remain within the logarithmic measuring range of the device, when OD600 of cultures exceeded 0.3. The appropriate medium was used as reference. pH was measured using a semi-micro pH electrode (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). 2.8.2 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) HPLC has been used for quantification of fructose, glucose, and lactate during bacterial growth. For this purpose, culture samples were taken under sterile conditions and centrifuged (15,000 g, 30 min, 4 °C). 500 μL supernatant were transferred into 2-mL vials (CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany). These were sealed with aluminum caps (CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany). A 1260 Infinity Series HPLC System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for analysis. The system was equipped with a diode array detector and a refractive index detector (heated to 35 °C). 20 μL of culture supernatant or external standard (cooled to 15 °C) was injected by an autosampler at an injection temperature of 24 °C. The separation was carried out using a CS-Chromatographie organic acid column (packing material polystyrene-divinylbenzene; CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) with the dimensions 150 mm × 8 mm at 40 °C. 5 mM H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min was used as mobile phase. 2.8.3 Gas chromatography (GC) 2.8.3.1 Analysis and quantification of fermentative products in the liquid phase GC analysis was used to quantify the metabolic fermentation products acetate, ethanol, butyrate, butanol, hexanoate, hexanol, and acetone. Samples were taken under sterile conditions and centrifuged (15,000 g, 30 min, 4 °C). 480 μL supernatant were transferred together with 20 μL 2 M HCl into 2-mL vials (CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany). These were sealed with aluminum caps (CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany). 1 μL of culture supernatant or external standard were injected into a PerkinElmer Clarus 680 GC System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Ma, USA) using an autosampler and an injection temperature of 225 °C with a split of 1:20. Hydrogen with a flow rate of 2.25 mL/min served as carrier gas. Separation was performed with an Elite-FFAP capillary column (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) with a length of 30 m, 0.32 mm inner diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness for determination of free organic acids (polar phase nitroterephthalic acid modified with polyethylene glycol). The system was equipped with a flame ionization detector (heated to 300 °C; detector gas flow: 45 mL/min H2 + 450 mL/min synthetic air). The following program was used for separation of the metabolites in the column: 90 °C, 2 min; 90–250 °C with 40 °C/min; 250 °C, 2 min. 2.8.3.2 Identification of C4 and C6 compounds using GC-MS Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to characterize butyrate, butanol, hexanoate, and hexanol in the liquid phase. For this purpose, culture samples were taken and prepared in the same way as for quantification using GC (2.8.3.1). The single quadrupole system Thermo Scientific ISQ LT SSQ 7000 with GC-MS coupling (Thermo Scientific Trace 1300) (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) was used to analyze the samples. The measurement was carried out using the following conditions: GC temperature 50 °C–300 °C at 10 °C/min; chemical ionization with 100 eV; 100 μA; temperature of source 150 °C; SEV voltage 2.0 kV; 0.2 s/scan; measuring range 60–600 u. 2.8.3.3 Analysis of the composition of the gas phase A PerkinElmer Clarus 580 GC System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine and quantify the gas composition during autotrophic growth. Sampling was carried out from the gas phase of culture bottles. 2.5 mL of gas were withdrawn with a gas-tight syringe (SBU Analytical Science™, Melbourne, Australia) and completely injected into the sample loop of the gas chromatograph. Argon was used as carrier gas in the column with the designation MS13X4-09SF2 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The individual gases were separated in the column at a temperature of 60 °C and a program duration of 11 min and then analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector (heated to 200 °C). To quantify the gas fractions, a single-point calibration was performed with a gas mixture (50 % CO, 45 % H2, 5 % CO2). The obtained data were calculated using the ideal gas law, based on the volume of the culture medium."
10,Results and discussion,
11,In silico comparison of C6 compound-producing acetogenic bacteria,"3.1 In silico comparison of C6 compound-producing acetogenic bacteria The fact that the closely related bacterial strains C. carboxidivorans, C. scatologenes, and C. drakei can produce C6 compounds during growth under autotrophic conditions (Küsel et al., 2000; Phillips et al., 2015, for C. drakei see Fig. S4), indicates that hexanoate and hexanol are synthesized starting from the central metabolic intermediate acetyl-CoA. For elucidation of the metabolic pathway for the production of medium-chained acids and alcohols, we investigated which genes might be possible candidates for chain elongation in the acetogenic bacteria. For this purpose, an in silico analysis of the chromosomal DNA of the three bacterial strains was carried out. The ABE-fermenting bacterial strain Clostridium acetobutylicum, in which the mechanism of chain elongation from C2 to C4 compounds has already been elucidated, was used as reference (Nölling et al., 2001). With the gene products of crt, bcd, etfB, etfA, hbd, and thl, which, apart from thl, are organized as bcs gene cluster (butyryl-CoA synthesis), C. acetobutylicum can produce C4 compounds (Boynton et al., 1996). It is reasonable to assume that in the three C6 compound-producing acetogens chain elongation also takes place via reverse β-oxidation with enzymes corresponding to the bcs gene cluster. The in silico analysis showed that C. carboxidivorans, C. scatologenes, and C. drakei have a corresponding gene cluster. In case of C. carboxidivorans and C. scatologenes, two such clusters were identified in each genome. A tBLASTx was carried out for comparison of the clusters, and the result was then visualized with Easyfig (Sullivan et al., 2011). The tBLASTx comparison of the annotated gene clusters is shown in Fig. 1 . In contrast to C. acetobutylicum, the gene thl is an integrated part of the gene clusters of the acetogenic strains. The gene hbd is also organized differently compared to the gene cluster of C. acetobutylicum. The differences in the amino acid sequences between the strains C. carboxidivorans, C. scatologenes, and C. drakei are comparatively small. However, the second gene clusters (designated cluster 2) additionally found in C. carboxidivorans and C. scatologenes differ from the first gene clusters (designated cluster 1) with respect to the derived amino acid sequences. Furthermore, an additional seventh open reading frame was identified in clusters 2 of C. carboxidivorans and C. scatologenes. The respective gene was annotated as R-specific crotonase. However, a domain analysis revealed that the resulting protein lacks essential functional domains."
12,Gene expression of hcs clusters 1 and 2 from C. carboxidivorans,"3.2 Gene expression of hcs clusters 1 and 2 from C. carboxidivorans According to the hypothesis that one or both bcs gene clusters present in C. carboxidivorans are together or independently responsible for chain elongation to C6-compounds, these were henceforth called hcs clusters (hcs: hexanoyl-CoA synthesis). An analysis using RT-PCR should show whether both gene clusters are transcribed during growth of C. carboxidivorans while C6-compounds are produced simultaneously. Therefore, samples for RNA isolation were taken from a heterotrophic growth experiment with C. carboxidivorans (Fig. 2-A; 40 mM fructose; biological triplicates) and cDNA was synthesized for hcs cluster 1 (Fig. 2-B) and hcs cluster 2 (Fig. 2-C). The results of RT-PCR are shown in Fig. S5-A and Fig. S5–B. The transcript of hcs cluster 1 could be detected in both growth phases and is expressed as an operon. The expected PCR fragments for the transcript detection of cluster 2 were only found in the positive PCR control with genomic DNA from C. carboxidivorans and the RT-PCR with isolated RNA from the E. coli strain. Neither in the exponential nor in the stationary growth phase a transcript of hcs cluster 2 from C. carboxidivorans could be detected under the conditions tested. In case of the hexanoate-producing strain C. kluyveri, it was assumed that the enzymes of the identified bcs gene cluster enable butyrate production and that further chain elongation takes place through other genes scattered in the genome (Seedorf et al., 2008). Since i) only one of such gene clusters was identified in C. drakei (produces hexanoate), ii) only one of the clusters was expressed in C. carboxidivorans, and iii) no further set of genes was found in the genome sequences of both strains, it can be assumed that the gene clusters are both involved in the synthesis of butyryl-CoA, and are also responsible for the synthesis of hexanoyl-CoA."
13,Heterologous production of C6 compounds with recombinant A. woodii strains,"3.3 Heterologous production of C6 compounds with recombinant A. woodii strains For further analysis of the function of hcs cluster 1 (Ccar_22805_Ccar22810) and hcs cluster 2 (Ccar_01430-Ccar_01436) from C. carboxidivorans, genes should be heterologously expressed in the acetogenic model organism A. woodii, which is only capable of forming C2 compounds (Buschhorn et al., 1989). For this purpose, a modular hexanoyl-CoA synthesis plasmid system (hcs plasmid system, Fig. S2) was developed. hcs Clusters 1 and 2 from C. carboxidivorans were each cloned into a plasmid. Constitutively active promoter P pta-ack from C. ljungdahlii (Hoffmeister et al., 2016) and the anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter P tet (Ransom et al., 2015) were used. After transformation of the four constructed hcs cluster plasmids into A. woodii, the strains AWO [pPta_hcs1], AWO [pPta_hcs2], AWO [pTet_hcs1], and AWO [pTet_hcs2] could be verified by sequencing. Growth behavior and product spectrum of the recombinant A. woodii strains were examined together with the strain AWO WT (wild type) and AWO [pMTL83151] as a control in heterotrophic and autotrophic growth experiments. Growth behavior and product formation under heterotrophic conditions are shown in Fig. 3 . Gas chromatography analysis of culture broth from growth experiments of AWO [pPta_hcs1], AWO [pPta_hcs2], AWO [pTet_hcs1], and AWO [pTet_hcs2] revealed further peaks in addition to the peak of acetate. These peaks could be assigned to the acids butyrate and hexanoate by additional analysis with GC-MS. A. woodii strains carrying plasmids with hcs clusters 1 and 2 from C. carboxidivorans also produced butyrate and hexanoate in addition to acetate during heterotrophic fermentation. Product titers determined at the end of the heterotrophic growth experiment are summarized in Table 3 . By the end of fermentation, the strains with constitutively active promoter produced significantly more butyrate (AWO [pPta_hcs1] 2.58 mM, AWO [pPta_hcs2] 2.05 mM) than the strains with inducible promoter (AWO [pTet_hcs1] 0.86 mM, AWO [pTet_hcs2] 0.83 mM). Similar results were obtained for hexanoate production. The strains AWO [pPta_hcs1] and AWO [pPta_hcs2] produced 4.15 and 3.55 mM, the strains AWO [pTet_hcs1] and AWO [pTet_hcs2] 1.63 and 1.22 mM hexanoate. Alcohol production could not be detected in any of the A. woodii strains examined. Next, C6 compound production was examined under autotrophic conditions with the A. woodii strains AWO WT, AWO [pMTL83151], AWO [pPta_hcs1], AWO [pPta_hcs2], AWO [pTet_hcs1], and AWO [pTet_hcs2]. Growth pattern and product formation of respective A. woodii strains are shown in Fig. 4 . During fermentation, gas phase was replaced twice with fresh gas and cumulative H2 or CO2 uptake was determined. As already observed during heterotrophic growth, the strains expressing the genes of hcs clusters 1 and 2 from C. carboxidivorans were able to produce butyrate and hexanoate in addition to acetate. The titers of acetate, butyrate, and hexanoate achieved during autotrophic fermentation are shown in Table 3. Independent of the promoter, hcs cluster 1 was able to produce more butyrate and hexanoate than hcs cluster 2 with the corresponding promoter. Even under autotrophic conditions, significantly more product was obtained with the constitutively active promoter P pta-ack than with the inducible promoter P tet . The experiments showed that by introducing the genes of hcs cluster 1 and also those of hcs cluster 2 from C. carboxidivorans, the recombinant acetogenic model organism is capable of chain elongation. With the enzymes encoded in hcs cluster 2, the production of butyrate and hexanoate was comparatively lower than with the enzymes from hcs cluster 1. However, it is still unclear to which extent the additional seventh coding sequence has an influence on gene expression, formation of enzymes, or product formation. The ability of the recombinant A. woodii strains to form hexanoyl-CoA and hexanoate with only one gene cluster showed that the four enzymes Thl, Hbd, Crt, and Bcd from C. carboxidivorans are capable of both C4 compounds and C6 compounds synthesis. For Crt and for Hbd from C. acetobutylicum, it has already been demonstrated that enzymes from the bcs gene cluster are not specific for C4 or C6 compounds (Waterson et al., 1972; Shen et al., 2011). However, C6 compounds production with Thl and Bcd from C. acetobutylicum was not possible. It appears that Thl and Bcd of C. carboxidivorans, unlike those from C. acetobutylicum, can also nonspecifically catalyze the reactions to acetoacetyl-CoA and 3-ketohexanoyl-CoA as well as to butyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA. The further reaction to butyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA in A. woodii appears to be catalyzed by native unspecific enzymes such as phosphate transferase (Ptf) and fatty acid kinase (Fak)."
14,Hexanoate and hexanol production with recombinant C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum strains under heterotrophic conditions,"3.4 Hexanoate and hexanol production with recombinant C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum strains under heterotrophic conditions The next question was whether a single gene of hcs cluster 1 is sufficient for the formation of hexanoyl-CoA. The genes thl, crt, hbd, and bcd (together with etfA and etfB) were cloned separately into individual plasmids (Fig. S3). These plasmids, together with the plasmids pPta_hcs1_C and pTet_hcs1_C already used in A. woodii, were introduced into the ABE-fermenting bacterium C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum (CSAC) and the product spectrum was analyzed. After plasmids transformation in C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum and verification by sequencing, the strains CSAC [pPta_hcs1_C], CSAC [pTet_hcs1_C], CSAC [pthl], CSAC [pcrt], CSAC [phbd], and CSAC [pbcd_etfAB] were analyzed together with wild type strain CSAC WT and strain CSAC [pMTL83251] in a heterotrophic growth experiment. Growth behavior and product formation of the recombinant C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum strains are shown in Fig. 5 . A total of eight different products were detected by GC analysis. In addition to the native fermentation products of C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum (lactate, acetone, acetate, ethanol, butyrate, and butanol), the C6 compounds hexanoate and hexanol were determined. Hexanoate production could only be detected in the strains CSAC [pPta_hcs1_C] and CSAC [pTet_hcs1_C], which carry the entire hcs cluster 1 from C. carboxidivorans. With the same strains, production of hexanol could also be demonstrated for the first time. A comparison of the product titers of all eight strains investigated is shown in Table 4 . With strain CSAC [pPta_hcs1_C], in which genes of the complete hcs cluster 1 from C. carboxidivorans are under the control of the constitutively active promoter P pta-ack , it was possible to produce twice as much hexanoate (0.8 mM) and eight times as much hexanol (5.2 mM) compared to the strain CSAC [pTet_hcs1_C] (0.4 mM hexanoate; 0.6 mM hexanol), in which genes are under the control of the inducible promoter P tet . As also described for C. acetobutylicum, C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum carries a bcs operon in which similar proteins are encoded except for thiolase (Cspa_c04330-Cspa_c04370). C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum is only able to synthesize hexanoyl-CoA from butyryl-CoA with the additionally introduced genes. Hexanoyl-CoA is then further converted to hexanoate or hexanol by native enzymes. Since activity for 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase as well as for crotonase from C. acetobutylicum could already be demonstrated against C6 compounds (Dekishima et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2011), thiolase and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase from C. carboxidivorans seem to be the essential enzymes for chain elongation. The growth experiment showed that with only one of the genes of the hcs cluster 1 from C. carboxidivorans, C6 compound production is not possible. Consequently, at least two of the enzymes are necessary for conversion of butyryl-CoA to hexanoyl-CoA."
15,The metabolic pathway for the production of medium chain acids and alcohols in C. carboxidivorans,"3.5 The metabolic pathway for the production of medium chain acids and alcohols in C. carboxidivorans Based on the experimental results of this study, a model of the metabolic pathway for the synthesis of medium-chained acids and alcohols in C. carboxidivorans was developed. Genome analysis has already identified the genes encoding enzymes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and responsible for the formation of acids and solvents in C. carboxidivorans (Bruant et al., 2010). Acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate by a phosphotransacetylase and an acetate kinase. Analogously, the synthesis of butyrate from butyryl-CoA is carried out by a phosphotransbutyrylase and a butyrate kinase. The conversion of acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA to ethanol and butanol is believed to be catalyzed by the identified bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase AdhE. In C. acetobutylicum, the conversion of acids into corresponding alcohols is catalyzed by a CoA transferase. The required genes ctfA and ctfB could not be found in the genome sequence of C. carboxidivorans (Bruant et al., 2010). Therefore, it is likely that the conversion of acids to alcohols in C. carboxidivorans takes place by the identified aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Aor). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in both acetogens, C. scatologenes and C. drakei, which both are not capable of producing alcohols, no aor gene was found, but instead a gene encoding AdhE. Bruant et al. (2010) also identified the two gene clusters with thl, hbd, crt, bcd, etfA, and etfB. Based on the results obtained in this study, the described metabolic pathway in C. carboxidivorans can now be expanded. Fig. 6 shows the complete metabolic pathway for the synthesis of medium-chained acids and alcohols in C. carboxidivorans, starting from CO and CO2. The chain elongation mechanism of acetyl-CoA via butyryl-CoA to hexanoyl-CoA takes place with proteins encoded in the hcs clusters 1 and 2. The enzymes Thl, Hbd, Crt, and Bcd (together with EtfA and EtfB) catalyze the formation of both, butyryl-CoA as well as hexanoyl-CoA. Further conversion of hexanoyl-CoA to hexanoate and hexanol is presumably carried out by the same enzymes, which can also convert acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA to corresponding acids and alcohols. Each of the two hcs gene clusters forms an operon. However, no gene expression of hcs cluster 2 from C. carboxidivorans with simultaneous C6 compound production was detected. Nevertheless, the recombinant A. woodii and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum strains have shown that both gene clusters allowed chain elongation from acetyl-CoA to hexanoyl-CoA via reverse β-oxidation. Heterologous chain elongation for the production of C6 compounds has only been successfully established in E. coli (Dekishima et al., 2011). In addition to Hbd and Crt from C. acetobutylicum, Ter (trans-enoyl-CoA reductase) from Treponema denticola and BktB (β-kethotiolase) from Cupriavidus necator were required for the formation of hexanoyl-CoA. It seems that especially the activity of BktB towards the C6 substrate and thus that of Thl from C. carboxidivorans are the bottleneck in the formation of C6 compounds (Dekishima et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2011). In contrast, the recombinant strain CSAC [pthl] could not produce any hexanoate or hexanol. Nevertheless, it would be possible that Bcd from C. carboxidivorans is also essential for the synthesis of hexanoyl-CoA. In order to determine which proteins are really involved in chain elongation, the next step would be to investigate their enzyme activity in an in vitro experiment."
16,Conclusion,"In this study, our data showed that the acetogenic C6 compound-producing strain C. carboxidivorans carries two gene clusters originally identified as bcs gene clusters which are similar in their amino acid sequence to the gene clusters found in C. scatologenes and C. drakei (Bruant et al., 2010). All three strains can produce hexanoate from synthesis gas (Fig. S4). However, the arrangement of the genes is different from that of C. acetobutylicum, which only can produce C4 compounds. RT-PCR revealed that under the examined conditions only cluster 1 was expressed regardless to the growth phase, which might suggest that cluster 2 just acts as a backup in C. carboxidivorans. Nevertheless, heterologous production of hexanoate in A. woodii was possible with genes of cluster 1 or cluster 2 under heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions. This shows that contrary to what was claimed for the hexanoate-producing strain C. kluyveri, only one set of genes is necessary for chain elongation from acetyl-CoA via butyryl-CoA to hexanoyl-CoA in C. carboxidivorans (Seedorf et al., 2008). Therefore, gene clusters in C. carboxidivorans were renamed as hcs operons. With the transfer of the individual genes from cluster 1 into the C4 compound-producing strain C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum, it was examined if only one gene might be sufficient for chain elongation from C4 to C6 compound in acetogenic bacteria. The results clearly showed that at least two or more genes are required for the production of medium-chained acids or alcohols. Additionally, it was possible to construct recombinant C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum strains which were able to produce hexanoate and hexanol with the complete hcs cluster 1 from C. carboxidivorans. Thus, the complete metabolic pathway for the formation of hexanoate and hexanol in C. carboxidivorans was postulated based on the experimental results from this study."
