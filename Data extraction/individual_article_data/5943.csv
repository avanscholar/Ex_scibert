0,Introduction,"Over the past few decades, the conversion of renewable biomass resources into various valuable chemicals has been the focus of academic research to reduce the excessive dependence on nonrenewable fossil resources [1–3]. Among many biomass-derived chemicals, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered as a very crucial versatile intermediate [4–6], because it can be used to synthesize a wide range of high-value derivatives such as 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) [7–9], 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) [10–12], 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) [13–15], 1,6-hexanediol (HDO) [16–18], 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) [19–21] and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) [22–24]. In this respect, it is necessary to point out that DHMF, which is prepared by the selective hydrogenation of HMF, is extremely attractive due to its special chemical structure and great application potential in the production of ethers [25–27], ketones [28] and polymers [29–32], hence, it has received tremendous interest of many scientists in recent years. As is known to all, HMF contains three functional groups, one is the carbonyl group, another is the hydroxyl group and the third is the furan ring, which make it has a strong reactivity [33–35]. Thus, during the selective hydrogenation of HMF into DHMF, how to ensure the hydrogenation priority of carbonyl group and avoid the further hydrogenolysis of hydroxyl group and furan ring are the pivotal issues. To solve these issues, designing an appropriate catalytic system is especially important. Until now, most conventional catalytic systems for the selective hydrogenation of HMF into DHMF are composed of precious metal catalysts (such as Ru/C [35], Ru/MSZN [36], Pt/C [37], Pt/MCM-41 [38], Au/Al2O3 [39], Au/FeOx [40], Ir/TiO2 [41] and Ir-ReOx/SiO2 [42]) and molecular hydrogen (H2). Although good results were achieved, these conventional catalytic systems have a serious deficiency, which is that precious metal catalysts and H2 are highly expensive. More recently, in order to reduce costs, some novel catalytic systems have been gradually employed for the selective hydrogenation of HMF into DHMF via disproportionation reaction [43–45], electrocatalytic method [46–48], photocatalytic method [49] and biocatalytic method [50], which can be performed over non-precious metal catalysts without the need of external H2. However, the lower catalytic selectivity and longer reaction time are their main demerits, respectively. Therefore, an economical and effective catalytic system is urgently desired for the selective hydrogenation of HMF into DHMF. As a typical catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) method, Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction is widely applied for the selective reduction of various carbonyl compounds such as 5-methylfurfural (MF) [51], furfural (FF) [52], cyclohexanone (CHN) [53], levulinic acid (LA) [54] and ethyl levulinate (EL) [55], which can be catalyzed by the inexpensive zirconium-based catalysts in the presence of alcohols [56–60]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that HMF is also a carbonyl compound, therefore, it should be applicable to MPV reaction in theory. In order to verify this speculation, our research group prepared a zirconium hydroxide in 2016, and when it was used for the CTH of HMF via MPV reaction, DHMF with the yield of 83.7% was produced in ethanol [61], indicating that MPV reaction is completely feasible for the CTH of HMF into DHMF over a zirconium-based catalyst. Imperfectly, the catalytic activity and recyclability of catalyst are also needed to be further improved. Inspired by the present research situations, this work synthesized a neoteric zirconium-cyanuric acid coordination polymer with magnetic property (MZCCP), which was more active for the CTH of HMF into DHMF via MPV reaction under the mild reaction conditions. More satisfyingly, MZCCP could also show a superior universality for the CTH of MF, FF, CHN, LA and EL via MPV reaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of magnetic zirconium-based organic-inorganic hybrid catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of HMF and other biomass-derived carbonyl compounds."

Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and used without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Zirconium-cyanuric acid coordination polymer (ZCCP): ZrCl4 (6.99 g, 30 mmol) and CA (5.16 g, 40 mmol) were firstly dissolved in DMF (400 mL), respectively. And then, the solution of CA was slowly added into the solution of ZrCl4, which was followed by the dropwise addition of TEA (24.29 g, 240 mmol) in 2 h at an agitation speed of 400 rpm. After that, the mixture was continuously stirred for 4 h at room temperature and statically aged for 4 h at 80 °C. Finally, the white precipitate was filtrated and washed with DMF and ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. For comparison, zirconium-phytic acid coordination polymer (ZPCP), zirconium-benzenetricarboxylic acid coordination polymer (ZBCP), stannum-phytic acid coordination polymer (SPCP) and stannum-cyanuric acid coordination polymer (SCCP) were also synthesized by using the similar procedure for ZCCP. Magnetic zirconium-cyanuric acid coordination polymer (MZCCP): FeSO4·7H2O (1.39 g, 5 mmol) and FeCl3·6H2O (2.70 g, 10 mmol) were completely dissolved in the deoxidized and deionized water (DDW, 200 mL) under an atmospheric pressure of nitrogen. Next, NH3·H2O was slowly added into the mixed solution at an agitation speed of 400 rpm until the value of pH was kept at 10. After continuous stirring for 1 h at 80 °C, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the black precipitate was collected by a permanent magnet and washed with DDW and ethanol to neutrality. Subsequently, the black precipitate was resuspended in 400 mL DMF solution of ZrCl4 (6.99 g, 30 mmol), which was continuously stirred for 30 min and sonicated for 10 min. Soon afterwards, 400 mL DMF solution of CA (5.16 g, 40 mmol) was gradually added into the above mixture at an agitation speed of 400 rpm. After that, the following procedure was the same with ZCCP."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an ARL X’TRA diffractometer (ARL, Switzerland) using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were conducted on a Zeiss Sigma scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan), respectively. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on a 3FLEX surface analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) at 77 K. Specific surface areas and pore sizes were evaluated by the method of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the method of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH), respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected on a Nicolet IS50 spectrometer (Nicolet, USA) using the KBr pellet method. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) profiles were estimated on an AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on a Quantum 2000 spectrometer (Physical electronics, USA) using a Al Kα excitation source (hv = 1486.6 eV). The contents of zirconium (Zr), iron (Fe), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) were analyzed on a VISTA-MPX inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (VARIAN, USA) and a Vario EL III elemental analyzer (EA) (Elementar, Germany), respectively."
5,CTH of HMF into DHMF,"2.4 CTH of HMF into DHMF All the reactions were carried out in a 100 mL cylindrical stainless steel reactor (Parr, USA) with the external temperature and stir controllers. In a typical reaction, 0.5 g HMF, 0.2 g catalyst and 24.5 g alcohol were charged into the reactor. After sealing, the reactor was purged with nitrogen for 5 times. Under the autogenous pressure, the reaction mixture was stirred at a known temperature for the specific time. When the reaction was completed, the reactor was immediately quenched to room temperature in an ice-water bath, and the reaction mixture was collected and filtered with 0.22 μm syringe membrane filter."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis HMF, DHMF and other products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu GC-2014) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP2010) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-WAXETR capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). For the analysis of GC and GC–MS, the initial column temperature of 40 °C was maintained for 2 min, and then, the column temperature was increased at 5 °C/min until 100 °C was reached and maintained for 2 min, after that, the column temperature was further increased at 10 °C/min until 250 °C was reached and maintained for 4 min. Moreover, HMF conversion and DHMF yield were based on the external standard method and calculated using the following equations: (1) HMF conversion % = 1 - Mole of HMF in products Initial mole of HMF × 100 (2) DHMF yield % = Mole of DHMF in products Initial mole of HMF × 100"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The preparation procedure of MZCCP includes two successive steps: (1) the synthesis of ferriferrous oxide (Fe3O4) via the method of coprecipitation; (2) the encapsulation of ZCCP on the surface of Fe3O4, which are detailedly presented in the experimental section, respectively. When ZCCP and MZCCP were prepared, they would be systematically characterized by ICP, EA, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, BET, BJH, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD and XPS, and the corresponding characteristic results are summarized in the subsequent section. The ICP and EA analysis in Table S1 show that the molar ratio of Zr and C in ZCCP was approximately 1:4, indicating that one mole of Zr4+ could coordinate with one and a third moles of CA. Due to the whole coordination ability of phenate group in CA and the steric hindrance of CA, the most possible mode for the connection of Zr4+ and CA is shown in Scheme 1 , and the network of ZCCP was mainly generated through this connection mode. However, the patterns of XRD in Fig. 1 a show that ZCCP was highly amorphous, demonstrating that there were many defects and anomalous connections in ZCCP. In contrast to ZCCP, the peaks at around 30.2°, 35.6°, 43.3°, 53.5°, 57.1° and 62.7° in MZCCP were assigned to (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1) and (4 4 0) lattice planes of Fe3O4, respectively, which is in accordance with the standard magnetite structure data in the JCPDS Card No. 19-0629 [62], indicating that Fe3O4 had been successfully introduced into MZCCP. Furthermore, it should be particularly noted that no other obvious peak was detected in MZCCP, demonstrating that the introduction of Fe3O4 did not change the chemical structure of ZCCP, which can be further proved by the spectra of FT-IR in Fig. 1b. Meanwhile, the images of SEM and TEM in Fig. 2 show that ZCCP and MZCCP were composed of primary nanoscale particles, which were aggregated in different degrees. Differently, the primary nanoscale particles in MZCCP were relatively bigger than those in ZCCP, leading to a slight decrease in the surface area of MZZCP (Table 1 ). In addition, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at various relative pressures in Fig. 3 a show that ZCCP and MZCCP were mesoporous, and the pore size of MZCCP was estimated to be larger than that of ZCCP (Fig. 3b), which should be ascribed to that the introduction of Fe3O4 promoted the formation of pores in relatively greater size by restraining the excessive aggregation of primary nanoscale particles in MZCCP [63]. Generally, the zirconium-based organic-inorganic coordination polymers possess the amphoteric properties with the corresponding acidic sites (mainly originating from Zr4+) and basic sites (mainly originating from O2−) [57–59]. In this work, ZCCP and MZCCP, no exception, also had the amphoteric properties that can be confirmed by the profiles of NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD in Fig. 4 , respectively. At the same time, it is worth noting that the desorption temperatures of ZCCP and MZCCP were nearly the same, indicating that compared with ZCCP, the introduction of Fe3O4 did not apparently change the acid-base strength of MZCCP, which can be further verified by the relevant binding energies of Zr and O in the spectra of XPS (Fig. 5 ), respectively. However, it affected the acid-base content and ratio of MZCCP to a certain extent (Table 1), and then would influence its catalytic activity. In a word, according to the above characteristic results, it can be deduced that ZCCP and MZCCP with the amorphous and mesoporous structures and amphoteric properties may serve as good catalysts. For comparison, other organic-inorganic coordination polymers such as ZPCP, ZBCP, SPCP and SCCP were also prepared with the similar structural and textural properties (Figs. S1–S7 and Table 1)."
9,CTH of HMF into DHMF over various catalysts,"3.2 CTH of HMF into DHMF over various catalysts In the initial study, the catalytic activities of various catalysts for the CTH of HMF into DHMF via MPV reaction were firstly evaluated in the presence of 2-butanol, which acted as hydrogen donor as well as reaction medium. As shown in Table 2 , it is obvious that HMF conversion and DHMF yield are significantly dependent on the employed catalysts. Without the addition of any catalyst, although 3.4% HMF was converted at 130 °C for 4 h, DHMF was not generated, indicating that the usage of catalysts was necessary for the successful formation of DHMF from HMF. Under the same reaction conditions, when ZPCP, ZBCP, SCCP and SPCP were used as catalysts, HMF conversion and DHMF yield were improved in varying degrees. However, the corresponding numerical values were still lower than 65.0% and 40.0%, respectively. Excitingly, in contrast to the above catalysts, ZCCP and MZCCP showed the higher catalytic activities, HMF conversion and DHMF yield were more than 78.0% and 61.0%, respectively. It is a common knowledge that the amorphous and mesoporous structures of catalysts with the larger surface areas and pore sizes are beneficial for the CTH of carbonyl compounds in most cases, because they can increase the contact of reactants with the active centers and then facilitate the formation of products [59,64,65]. But, they were not the crucial factors in this work, which can be seen from Tables 1 and 2. Due to the preeminent promotion roles of acidic sites and basic sites in activating the carbonyl groups of carbonyl compounds and dissociating the hydroxyl groups of alcohols, respectively, high acid-base strengths and contents of catalysts have been proved to be essential for the CTH of carbonyl compounds in many previous studies [51,53,57,58,61]. Particularly, among various catalysts in this work, ZCCP and MZCCP had the higher acid-base strengths and contents (Figs.4, S6 and S7 and Table 1). According to the above findings, it can be concluded that the two factors should be the main reason for the higher catalytic activities of ZCCP and MZCCP, which is in agreement with the results in Table 2. Moreover, compared with ZCCP, MZCCP also had a more proper acid-base ratio (about 0.7:1) that might balance the respective roles of acidic sites and basic sites in the CTH of HMF into DHMF [51,57,58], leading to a superior performance, and so it was chosen as the appropriate catalyst for the subsequent experiments."
10,Influence of reaction conditions on CTH of HMF into DHMF over MZCCP,"3.3 Influence of reaction conditions on CTH of HMF into DHMF over MZCCP Apart from the physicochemical properties of catalysts, the catalytic activities of catalysts are also strongly relied on various reaction conditions. Therefore, in order to obtain more insights into their influences on the CTH of HMF into DHMF over MZCCP, alcohol type, reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount were investigated in detail. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, the CTH of HMF into DHMF are closely related to various alcohol types with the different reduction potentials, which are defined as the difference of the standard molar enthalpy of formation between alcohols and their corresponding carbonyl products [66]. It is generally known that the numerical values of reduction potentials represent the complexity of hydrogen abstraction [66]. Because methanol possesses the highest reduction potential in various alcohols (Table S2), hence, it exhibited the poorest capacity as hydrogen donor. Nearly half of HMF was converted, however, DHMF yield was only 3.1%. On this occasion, it should be pointed out that 5-hydroxymethyl-2-(dimethoxymethyl)furan (HMDMMF) was identified as the major byproduct (Figs. S8 and S9), which could be synthesized by the acetalization of HMF with methanol. When ethanol was employed as hydrogen donor, HMF conversion and DHMF yield were 70.5% and 33.8%, respectively, they were more than those in 1-butanol, even the reduction potential of 1-butanol is lower than that of ethanol, which may be attributed to the stronger steric effect of 1-butanol [56]. Expectedly, compared with the primary alcohols, the secondary alcohols such as 2-propanol and 2-butanol with much lower reduction potentials were found to be more active for the CTH of HMF into DHMF, resulting in more than 80.0% HMF conversion and 63.0% DHMF yield. In addition, it should be specifically noted that the better results were obtained in the presence of 2-butanol, hence, it was selected as the ideal hydrogen donor in this work. As presented in Fig. 6b–d, reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount also have a great influence on the CTH of HMF into DHMF, and their influence trends are very similar. To be specific, with the increase of reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount in a certain scope, HMF conversion and DHMF yield were gradually increased, suggesting that the CTH of HMF into DHMF could be promoted by the higher reaction temperature, longer reaction time and larger catalyst amount. When reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount were over a critical value and further increased, respectively, although HMF conversion was continuously increased, DHMF yield would be distinctly decreased, this is because that the excessive reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount gave rise to the occurrence of much more side-reactions such as the hydrogenolysis of HMF and DHMF into MF and MFA, which could be detected by GC–MS in Figs. S10 and S11. From the above analysis, it can be seen that reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount should be precisely controlled and adjusted to achieve the satisfactory results in the CTH of HMF into DHMF. Thus, based on the highest DHMF yield of 93.4% with 98.7% HMF conversion, 140 °C, 5 h and 0.25 g were set to be the suitable reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount in this work, respectively."
11,Recyclability of MZCCP in CTH of HMF into DHMF,"3.4 Recyclability of MZCCP in CTH of HMF into DHMF The recyclability of catalyst is extremely important to appraise the catalytic stability of catalyst, which is also one of momentous indexes to assess its application potential in the industrial process. In the recycling experiments, MZCCP could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by an outer magnet when each reaction run was accomplished (Fig. 7 a). After separation, MZCCP would be washed with DMF and ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the spent MZCCP was directly reused for the next reaction run under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 7b, an apparent decrease in the catalytic activity of MZCCP was not observed after five reaction runs, and HMF conversion and DHMF yield were still achieved to 96.3% and 91.5%, respectively, indicating that MZCCP displayed an excellent catalytic stability. Moreover, the spent MZCCP after five reaction runs was also characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and FT-IR in Fig. S12, it is clear that the spent MZCCP remained almost unchanged in the structure and property compared with the fresh MZCCP, further demonstrating that the prepared catalyst of MZCCP in this work was stable in the CTH of HMF into DHMF."
12,Reaction mechanism for CTH of HMF into DHMF over MZCCP,"3.5 Reaction mechanism for CTH of HMF into DHMF over MZCCP As described above, MZCCP was prepared by the encapsulation of ZCCP on the surface of Fe3O4. Although the introduction of Fe3O4 affected the structure and property of MZCCP to some extent, Fe3O4 itself was almost inactive (entry 7, Table 2). Hence, the dominant active component of MZCCP should be ZCCP in MZCCP. Furthermore, its acidic sites (mainly originating from Zr4+) and basic sites (mainly originating from O2−) have been verified to be very important for the CTH of HMF into DHMF. According to the experimental results and the relevant reports [53,58,59,61,64], a plausible reaction mechanism for the CTH of HMF into DHMF over MZCCP in the presence of 2-butanol was proposed in Scheme 2 . In the catalytic cycle, 2-butanol firstly interacted with O2− under the assistance of Zr4+, and then dissociated to the corresponding alkoxide and hydrogen. Concurrently, the carbonyl group of HMF was activated by Zr4+ with the help of O2−. Next, the activated carbonyl group and the dissociated alcohol would interact to form a six-link intermediate, from which DHMF was finally generated through hydrogen transfer."
13,CTH of different substrates over MZCCP,"3.6 CTH of different substrates over MZCCP Delighted by the remarkable performance of MZCCP for the CTH of HMF into DHMF, this work explored the possibility for the CTH of other biomass-derived carbonyl compounds over MZCCP. As listed in Table 3 , it is found that MZCCP also showed the excellent catalytic activity for all the examined substrates, and they could be effectively catalyzed to produce the corresponding products in high yields. Moreover, based on the results of Table 3, two more points should be particularly noted in this section. (1) Compared with aldehydes such as MF and FF, the relatively rigorous reaction conditions were required for the CTH of ketones such as CHN, LA and EL due to their stronger steric hindrances [51]. (2) As for LA and EL, the former possessed a higher reactivity because of its self-acidity that could improve the lactonization of 4-hydroxypentanoate and thus increase the reaction rate [53]."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, this work prepared a magnetic zirconium-cyanuric acid coordination polymer (MZCCP). As a heterogeneous catalyst, it was proved to be very active for the CTH of HMF in the presence of 2-butanol. Under a moderate reaction temperature of 140 °C, DHMF yield could be achieved to 93.4% in 5 h, this satisfactory result should be mainly ascribed to the higher acid-base strength and content and the proper acid-base ratio of MZCCP. In addition, MZCCP displayed a good catalytic stability, it could be used at least five reaction runs without an apparent decrease in catalytic activity. More surprisingly, MZCCP could also be employed for the CTH of MF, FF, CHN, LA and EL into the corresponding products in high yields, which clearly indicates that it has an enormous application potential for the selective reduction of various biomass-derived carbonyl compounds."
