0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen production by the photocatalysis of semiconductor nanomaterials may be the possible solution for the fossil fuel depletion because hydrogengasas an environmental fuel is one of the most important alternative energy carrier to replace fossil fuels [1–3]. A lot of materials were studied for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Recently, ZnS was reported to be useful in photocatalysts [4,5] and phosphors [6]. The activity of photocatalysts can be improved by doping [7,8], deposition of metal [9,10], combination with semiconductor as composite photocatalyst [11], and introducing the light-harvesting effect. Doping leads to bandgap modification [12]. Light trapping effect can be achieved by modifying the surface texture [13,14]. Introducing co-catalysts can enhance the separation of photogenerated holes and electrons for photocatalytic hydrogen production [15]. To achieve high photocatalytic activity, the photocatalyst nanoparticles should exhibit good dispersing stability to achieve effective contact between photocatalysts and reaction mixtures. However, such good dispersing stability in aqueous solution will make it more difficult to separate and collect ultrafine particles of photocatalysts for repeated use by filtration and centrifugation [16]. Efficient separation of photocatalytic nanoparticles from the reaction mixture is important for the repeated use of photocatalysts. Magnetic core–shell photocatalysts were studied to recycle photocatalysts by applying an appropriate magnetic field. Many research efforts have been carried out for the preparation and optimization Fe3O4 based core/shell photocatalysts [17,18]. Besides, combination of photocatalytic nanomaterials with other magnetic nanoparticles such as Fe2O3 [19,20], NiFe2O4 [21], ZnFe2O4 [22], and CoFe2O4 [23] to fabricate magnetically separable composite photocatalyst was studied by some researchers. Magnetic CoFe2O4 has been used as a core material for the preparation of magnetically separable CoFe2O4@TiO2 core–shell photocatalysts which can eliminate the pollutants in solution by photocatalytic degradation [24]. The photocatalysts could be separated from the reaction mixtures by a magnet and used for repeated operations. These magnetic nanoparticles not only contribute for magnetic separation of photocatalysts, but also act as an electron acceptor to effectively inhibit the charge recombination. The photocatalytic degradation activities of iron oxide/ZnO photocatalyst was significantly improved because of the effective electron–hole separation at the interfaces of the spindle-like core–shell photocatalysts [25]. Kim et al. [26] reported that magnetically separable core@ shell structured NiFe2O4@TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited better hydrogen production activity than either pure TiO2 or NiFe2O4, resulting from the suppression of electron/hole pair recombination and effective charge transfer from TiO2 to NiFe2O4. Zhang et al. [27] reported that SnO2/α-Fe2O3 composite photocatalysts had excellent photocatalytic degradation ability which was attributed to the large specific surface area, wide visible-light absorption range and effective electron–hole pair separation of the nanoheterostructures. The goal of this study is to synthesize a photocatalyst which exhibits high hydrogen production activity and good magnetic recycling capability. In this research, ZnS shell was grown onto magnetic CoFe2O4 core by a solvothermal method. The samples with different ZnS shell thickness and calcinations treatment were prepared. The morphology, crystalline property, magnetic property, photocatalytic H2 production performance, and magnetic recycling capability of the core–shell photocatalysts were studied."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles,"2.1 Synthesis of magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2•6H2O) and iron sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4•7H2O) were dissolved in deionized water to prepare 0.00625M Co(NO3)2 and 0.0125M FeSO4 aqueous solutions. Then, these two solutions were mixed and stirred. Aqueous 2M NH4OH solution was added gradually into the previous mixed solution until the pH value reached 9. The mixed solution was heated to 90°C and reacted for 1h. The precipitates were filtered and repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol several times until the pH of the solution became 7. The precipitates were dried prior to use."
3,Synthesis of CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts For the synthesis of CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts, 6.18mmol zinc acetate was added into 80ml ethylene glycol (EG) with CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The solution was stirred for 1h. Then, 6.18mmol thiourea was added. The resulting mixture was reacted at 150°C for different growth time (0.5, 2, and 4h). After being cooled to room temperature, the CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts were separated from the reaction solution by a magnet to remove the excessive ZnS nanoparticles that did not adhere on the CoFe2O4 cores."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystallite structures of the samples were determined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). An MXP3 diffractometer (Mac Science) with a Cu Kα (0.154nm) X-ray source (current: 40mA, voltage: 40kV) was used for the XRD analysis. The morphology and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) was investigated by Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) using glass substrates coated with the samples. FESEM experiments were carried out with a HITACH S-4800 FESEM (accelerating voltage: 3kV). The magnetic property of the samples was measured using SQUID VSM Magnetometer. BET surface area measurements were carried out by N2 adsorption at 77K on a high resolution surface area and porosimetry analyser (Micromeritics ASAP2000 instrument). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded over a relative pressure (P/P0) range of approximately 10−3–0.995. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F7000). The microstructures of the photocatalysts were analyzed by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOLJEM-2010)."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test The photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts was performed in a 100ml Quartz cell. A 300W high-pressure mercury lamp was used as the UV light source. 0.05g of CoFe2O4 photocatalyst was placed into the quartz cell which was filled with 100ml sacrificial aqueous solution. The sacrificial aqueous solution consisted of 3M sodium chloride, 0.1M sodium sulfide, and 0.040M sodium sulfite. The solution was continuously stirred during the UV light irradiation process, preventing the photocatalyst particles from settling at the bottom of the reactor. The amount of hydrogen production was measured by a gas chromatography (TCD, 5m Stainless Steel packed column, inner diameter: 5mm, carrier gas: Argon, stationary phase: Molecular Sieve 5 A)."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Morphology and compositions,"3.1 Morphology and compositions The morphology of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts were investigated by FESEM. A series of CoFe2O4@ZnS samples were prepared by different ZnS shell growth time with fixed precursor concentrations (thiourea and zinc acetate in EG). The pristine CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were used as core material. Fig. 1 (a) shows that the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles have an average diameter of 10nm. In Fig. 1(b), ZnS layer was grown on the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with the growth time of 0.5h. The average diameters of CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell nanoparticles are larger than the pristine CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The average diameter of CoFe2O4@ZnS nanospheres is 165nm. When the ZnS shell growth time is increased to 2h and 4h, the diameter of the samples become 190nm and 220nm. The CoFe2O4@ZnS based core–shell particles were spherical particles of irregular aggregates. All core–shell particles were prepared by the same batch of CoFe2O4 cores. The increase in the CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell nanoparticles indicates that the ZnS shell thickness increases with increasing shell growth time. The photocatalysts were coated on the glass substrates. Spatially resolved energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) measurements were carried out to investigate the chemical composition of the photocatalyst. Fig. 2 is the EDS patterns of CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts. There are Fe, Co, O, Zn, and S elements in the CoFe2O4@ZnS sample, which can be attributed to CoFe2O4 and ZnS. The atom ratio of cobalt to iron is 0.57, which is close to that of CoFe2O4. HR-TEM image of the CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst shown in Fig. 3 (a) demonstrates the core–shell structure of the CoFe2O4@ZnS based photocatalyst. Enlarged HR-TEM image of the CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts shown in Fig. 3(b) reveals the formation of heterojunction at the interface of CoFe2O4 and ZnS which may result in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of CoFe2O4@ZnS based photocatalysts. In addition, the average distance between the adjacent lattice planes of a typical CoFe2O4 core is 0.278nm, which corresponds to the (220) lattice plane of CoFe2O4 crystal. There is a shell layer around the core. Bright-field TEM image of a CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalyst, and the corresponding EDS elemental mapping of O, S, Fe, Co and Zn elements were shown in shown in Fig. 3(d)–(h). Considering the EDS elemental mapping results and the HR-TEM images, it confirms the CoFe2O4 core@ZnS shell structure of the photocatalyst. The CoFe2O4 core was decorated by ZnS nanoparticles. The mapping result is consistent with the SEM EDS spectrum shown in Fig. 2."
8,Crystalline property,"3.2 Crystalline property X-ray diffraction patterns were measured to investigate the crystal structure of CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell nanoparticles. Fig. 4 illustrates XRD patterns of as-synthesized CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts grown with different shell growth time. Both the CoFe2O4 and ZnS peaks are observed in Fig. 3. All the peaks appeared in the XRD pattern matches well with those of the ZnS (JCPDS Card No. 5-5066) [28] and CoFe2O4 (JCPDS Card No. 22-1086) [29]. Peaks at 2θ =30.5° and 35.5° can be attributed to (220) plane and (311) plane of CoFe2O4 [30]. In this study, broad ZnS diffraction peak at 2θ =28.5° which was attributed to (111) plane of the ZnS cubic structure [31] was observed for CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts. The intensity of ZnS peaks increases when the ZnS shell growth time is increased."
9,Magnetic property,"3.3 Magnetic property The magnetization curves of pristine CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, and CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts, were investigated by VSM and shown in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5(a), the saturation magnetization (Ms) value for pristine CoFe2O4 is 13 emu. From Fig. 5(b), the saturation magnetization values of the CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts with ZnS shell became 5emu. Compared to pristine CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst has a lower saturation magnetization. The non-magnetic ZnS shell around the magnetic CoFe2O4 cores lead to the decrease in magnetic saturation for CoFe2O4@ZnS microspheres. The CoFe2O4@ZnS based core–shell photocatalysts exhibits almost no hysteresis, demonstrating superparamagnetic characteristics. This property is important for repeated H2 production of the photocatalysts. No residual magnetism will remain in the photocatalysts after removing the external magnetic field. After being separated by a magnet from the previous operation, the recycled CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts can be redispersed in the reaction solution for repeated protocatalytic H2 production tests. Well-dispersed photocatalysts will exhibit large surface area and improved protocatalytic activity. The CoFe2O4@ZnS nanocomposites with the paramagnetic CoFe2O4 cores can act as magnetically separable photocatalysts."
10,Optical property,"3.4 Optical property The UV–vis DRS spectra of pristine CoFe2O4, pristine ZnS, and all of the synthesized CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . The pristine CoFe2O4 has the highest absorption with visible light absorption band tail. In comparison with the pristine CoFe2O4, there are red shifts of the band edges for the DRS spectra of CoFe2O4@ZnS nanospheres photocatalysts. In addition, the absorption decreased gradually as the ZnS growth time increased. For the pristine ZnS sample, the spectrum locates only within the UV range. Its absorption band is the lowest among CoFe2O4, ZnS, and all CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts."
11,Nitrogen adsorption isotherms,"3.5 Nitrogen adsorption isotherms The surface area of the photocatalyst plays an important role in the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. Pinnavaia et al. [32] reported that the catalytic activity of a HMS molecular sieve for a sterically demanding condensed phase reaction (such as the alkylation of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol with cinnamyl alcohol) is greatly dependent on the textural mesoporosity available for transporting reagents to the framework mesopores. In this study, the surface areas for the CoFe2O4@ZnS based core–shell photocatalysts were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 7 . Adsorption isotherms of all three samples are of type II of IUPAC classification. [33] A slight hysteresis is observed at the middle P/P 0 range for CoFe2O4@ZnS 0.5h photocatalyst, indicating the presence of mesopores on the surfaces of the core–shell microspheres. Since the desorption curve locates above the adsorption curve in the high P/P 0 region for CoFe2O4@ZnS 0.5h photocatalyst, it indicates the presence of the narrow entrance for pore spaces. The surface of CoFe2O4@ZnS 0.5h is larger than CoFe2O4@ZnS 2h and CoFe2O4@ZnS 4h samples. The change in the BET surface area of CoFe2O4@ZnS based core–shell photocatalysts is consistent with the structural change observed by FESEM. Similar trend was also observed for the CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts. The pores can be attributed to the space between the ZnS nanoparticles on the shell layer. From Table 1 , the surface area of CoFe2O4@ZnS decreases when the growth time is increased. The surface area of the samples is related to their morphology. The data in Table 1 are consistent with the FESEM images (Fig. 1). The thicknening the ZnS layer results in the particles aggregation, which can block the micro/meso-pores within photocatalyst particles and decrease the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume."
12,Photocatalytic activity,"3.6 Photocatalytic activity In addition to the magnetically separable properties, the CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts also have high photocatalytic activity. Fig. 8 shows the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts prepared by different ZnS shell growth time. The photocatalysts exhibited a steady photoactivity. The hydrogen evolution activity increased with the increasing of ZnS shell thickness. CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts exhibit the highest evolution rate at 900µmol/hg. After reaching an optimum level, the activity decreased with further increase of ZnS shell growth time. Compared with other samples, the CoFe2O4@ZnS-4h photocatalysts with a thicker layer of ZnS shell did not exhibit good photocatalytic H2 production performance. Fig. 1 showed that the ZnS shell thickness of the photocatalyst increases with increasing shell growth time. Since the inner layer ZnS is not accessible by the UV irradiation and the reactants, further increase of the ZnS layer thickness will not increase reactive sites and will not improve the activity of the photocatalysts. The increased encapsulated portion of active material in the inner layer of the photocatalysts will not help to increase the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, thickness of the ZnS layer should be optimized to achieve high photocatalytic activity."
13,The photocurrent response,"3.7 The photocurrent response The transient photocurrent responses of photocatalysts towards the on-off cycles of UV irradiation were investigated. Fig. 9 shows the chopped current-time transient responses of CoFe2O4@ZnS based photocatalysts prepared with different ZnS shell growth time as electrodes. The photocurrent response of the CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst was reproducible during the repeated on/off cycles under the UV irradiation. Compared with CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h, further extension of ZnS shell growth time resulted in a decreased photocurrent of the CoFe2O4@ZnS-2h and CoFe2O4@ZnS-4h photocatalysts. In addition, the second responses for CoFe2O4@ZnS-2h and CoFe2O4@ZnS-4h photocatalysts were lower than their first responses. The CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst exhibited the largest photocurrent among the three photocatalysts. The CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst can provide more active sites and adsorb more reactive species for photocatalytic H2 production reaction due to its large surface area (Table 1). The photocurrent indicates the high separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalyst. Effective separation of the photogenerated electrons helps the formation of hydrogen. That may explain why the trends of photocurrent responses are consistent with the photocatalytic activities for the CoFe2O4@ZnS based photocatalysts prepared with different ZnS shell growth time (Fig. 7). Zhang et al. found that the improved photocatalytic efficiency resulted from the formation of heterojunction in ZnO-semiconductor interface which can enhance charge separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs [34]. CoFe2O4 embedded one dimensional ZnO have been used for the photocatalytic degradation of phenolphthalein under UV irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the sample results from a hetero-junction formed at the interface of CoFe2O4 and ZnO [35]. The VB edge potential and CB edge potential of ZnS are +2.48 and −0.95eV (vs. normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE)), respectively. The VB edge potential and CB edge potential of CoFe2O4 are 2.92 and 0.72eV (vs. NHE), respectively. [36,37] When the CoFe2O4–ZnS hetero-junction was excited by UV light with photon energy higher or equal to the band gaps of ZnS and CoFe2O4, the electrons in the valence band (VB) moved to the conduction band (CB) generating equal amount of holes in VB. The photogenerated electrons were transferred from the CB of ZnS to the CB of CoFe2O4. The photogenerated electrons and holes in the heterojunction were efficiently separated. The photogenerated electrons can be scavenged by H+ to generate H2. Na2S and Na2SO3 can act as the hole scavenger in the solution. Hydrogen can be produced stably by such a novel photocatalyst. In this study, the formation of a hetero-junction formed at the interface of CoFe2O4 and ZnS may be one of the reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity of the CoFe2O4@ZnS based photocatalysts. The other contribution is the increase of surface area."
14,Photoluminescence (PL) spectra,"3.8 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra PL spectra of the semiconductor particles can be used to investigate the migration, transfer, and recombination behaviors of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs of these materials [38,39]. Fig. 10 demonstrates the PL spectra for ZnS and CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts under excitation at 280nm at room temperature. In comparison with ZnS, the PL of CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst show obvious decrease in the intensity of PL spectra, indicating the suppressed recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the core–shell photocatalysts."
15,Calcination treatment,"3.9 Calcination treatment The influence of calcination temperature on X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns ofCoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst was demonstrated in Fig. 11 . With the calcination of the CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst at 500°C for 2h, sharper diffraction peaks were observed. The influence of calcination temperature on photocatalytic H2 production rate was demonstrated in Fig. 12 . The optimized photocatalytic H2 production rate of CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell nanoparticles is 900µmol/gh. The H2 production rate of CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst calcinated at 400°C is similar to that of the pristine photocatalyst. The H2 production rate of calcinated CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst increases with increasing calcination temperature. The H2 production rate of CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst calcinated at 500°C reaches the maximum value of 1650 μmol/gh."
16,Magnetic separation capability,"3.10 Magnetic separation capability Fig. 13 shows the magnetic separation capability of calcinated CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts. The photocatalysts were placed into the sacrificial aqueous solution with a concentration of 0.1g-catalysts/100ml aqueous solution. The mixture was treated under ultra-sonication condition and then a small portion of the photocatalyst dispersion was placed in a bottle. Fig. 13(a) shows that the calcinated CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts were initially uniformly suspended in water. Then, an external magnet is placed beside the bottle to separate the photocatalysts from the reaction solution. Fig. 13(b) shows the image of separation of CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst by external magnetic force. Most of the photocatalysts were successfully attracted by the external magnet, indicating good magnetic separation property of the CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalyst."
17,Activity of recycled photocatalysts,"3.11 Activity of recycled photocatalysts The reusability of recycled photocatalysts is important for the industrial applications [40,41]. The H2 evolution of calcinated CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst for repeated three cycles was investigated and shown in Fig. 13(c). The test was carried out in NaCl solution using Na2S–Na2SO3 as an electron donor. The photocatalysts was continuously employed for 3 cycles. After each 180min of irradiation, the photocatalysts were separated and removed from the solution using external magnetic force. The photocatalyst was washed with distilled water. The sacrificial solution for the photocatalytic H2 production reaction was renewed for each cycle. The H2 evolution by calcinated CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst decreased slightly. However, at least 87% photocatalytic activity of CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts can be successfully retained after 3 cycles."
18,Conclusion,Magnetically recyclable and photoactive CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalysts with different ZnS contents were successfully prepared by a solvothermal method. The optimized photocatalytic H2 production rate of CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts is 900µmol/hg. The H2 production rate of CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalyst calcinated at 500°C reaches 1650μmol/gh. The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the large specific surface area and efficient electron–hole pair separation properties of the CoFe2O4@ZnS nanoheterostructures. The magnetic CoFe2O4 core does not retain any residual magnetism after magnetic field is removed. The CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalysts can be separated easily from the treatment media by an external magnet and then be well-dispersed for next operation because they exhibit almost no hysteresis. The photocatalysts can be easily recovered from the medium by an external magnetic field and be repeatedly used for photocatalytic hydrogen production. About 87% photocatalytic activity of recycled CoFe2O4@ZnS-0.5h photocatalysts can be retained after 3 cycles. CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell nanoparticle is an efficient and easily separable photocatalyst for hydrogen production application.
