0,Introduction,"Economic growth and our lifestyle in the last few decades have been strongly dependent on fossil fuels as sources of energy. However, the excessive dependence on fossil fuels has caused severe problems to human beings due to a continual rising of their cost, insecurity in their sustainability, as well as their impacts on global warming and environmental pollution [1,2]. Hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel and widely recognized as a potential substitute for fossil fuels, with several technical, socio-economic and environmental benefits to its credit [3,4]. Although H2 is traditionally produced by electro- or thermo-chemical process [5], biohydrogen has gained attention due to its potential as a sustainable alternative to conventional methods [6,7]. Hydrogen can be produced biologically by biophotolysis (direct and indirect), photo-fermentation and dark-fermentation or by a combination of these processes [8,9]. Among the biohydrogen production approaches, a two-step process combining dark- and photo-fermentation using low-cost or waste organic substrates is of particular interest due to its dual function of waste reduction and clean energy production, thereby acting as a promising option for biohydrogen production [10–12]. Dark fermentation involving mainly acidogenic bacteria (such as Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp.) produces H2 while converting organic substrates into volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols as the first stage [13,14], and photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., purple nonsulfur bacteria) utilize the end products of dark fermentation, converting them into H2 via photo-fermentation with simultaneous VFA reduction as the second stage [15,16]. However, the economical feasibility of phototrophic H2 production appears to be limited by the poor H2 production rate of the photosynthetic bacteria, which is about one-tenth to one-fiftieth of the H2 production rate of dark fermentation [4]. Thus, though combination of dark and photo-fermentations seems to be an ideal biohydrogen producing model leading to the highest theoretically and practically H2 yield [11,12], photo-fermentation may act as a rate limiting step for the overall hydrogen producing process. Various strategies have been tried in an effort to enhance the rate of photohydrogen production, including photobioreactor designs, utilization of immobilized cells, continuous-flow operations, optimization of media nutrient composition and genetically modified microorganism. Matsunaga et al. [17] developed a novel double-phase photobioreactor consisting of light and dark compartment, enhancing H2 production rate under microaerobic condition. Kondo et al. [18] constructed a multi-layered photobioreactor (MLPR), which could dilute a strong incident light and diffuse it uniformly in the reactor, ultimately increased H2 production. Fißler et al. [19] reported that using immobilized Rhodopseudomonas palustris cells with polymeric materials could improve photohydrogen production. Also, there are researches describing improvement of photohydrogen production by using continuous-flow operations [20]. Notably, combining a continuous-flow photobioreactor with hollow fiber displayed an increase in photohydrogen production [21]. Moreover, Ren et al. [22] proposed that different concentration (12.5–100mmol/l) of butyrate added in acetate medium had obviously affected the maximum H2 production rate. The maximum H2 production rate (32.54ml/l/h) was reached when acetate was at 25mmol/l and butyrate at 25mmol/l. In addition, inactivation of the uptake hydrogenase by genetic modification showed increased nitrogenase-dependent photo-H2 production rate [23]. However, few reports dealt with the effect of shaking/mixing on the photo-H2 production, which plays a crucial role on mixing of cells and substrate and the hydrogen removal from the broth. In this study, engineering approaches were applied to improve the rate and substrate conversion efficiency of photohydrogen production. First, we investigated the influence of light intensity on the photohydrogen production, and evaluated the characteristics of light attenuation with cell density and optical path in the liquid culture medium during photo-fermentation. Next, the feasibility and efficiency of two cultivation methods – standing-culture and shaking-culture were compared. Finally, based on the experimental data, we originated a novel cultural method of photosynthetic bacteria, i.e., shaking and extra-light supplementation (SELS), which greatly increased the rate and substrate conversion efficiency of photohydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and medium for photo-fermentation,"2.1 Microorganism and medium for photo-fermentation Rhodobacter sphaeroides ZX-5 (gift from Prof. Zhihua Zhou, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences) was used as the inoculum for photo-fermentation in this study. The characteristics and application of the strain were reported previously [24]. Starter cultures were inoculated with 1ml aliquot of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 cells stored in 20% glycerol solution at −80°C into 250ml shake flask containing 100ml RCVBN medium [25], then pre-cultured aerobically in a shaker at 200rpm at 30±1°C for 15h."
3,Hydrogen production in photo-fermentation with different culture methods,"2.2 Hydrogen production in photo-fermentation with different culture methods Conventional batch tests (i.e., Standing-culture) on the substrate conversion efficiency and rate of the photosynthetic bacterial strain by photo-fermentation were performed in 38-ml anaerobic tubes containing 34ml sterilized media and 1ml pre-cultured R. sphaeroides ZX-5 cells. RCVBN medium with 30-mM DL-malic acid as the carbon source and 7-mM L-glutamic acid as a nitrogen source was used for hydrogen production. Anaerobic tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers, illuminated by tungsten lamps, and kept at 30±1°C controlled by air-conditioner; 60-ml syringes were used to collect and measure gas production. The shaking-culture was conducted in the same 38-ml anaerobic tubes fixed on a shaker at 120rpm during photo-fermentation, and the other conditions were the same with standing-culture."
4,Kinetic model for light attenuation,"2.3 Kinetic model for light attenuation The characteristics of light attenuation were determined by aligning a series of cuvettes along the light penetration axis, each with a 1.0-cm light path and containing different cell density. Light intensity emitted from the light source at one end of cuvette was detected using a digital luxmeter (ZDS-10, Shanghai, China) from the other end. The distance of optical path can be lengthened by increasing the number of cuvettes, which ranged from 1 to 5cm. The intensity of incident light was adjusted to 6800lux. As cell density and optical path increase, light intensity detected on the other end of the cuvette sharply attenuated due to the shielding effects of the cells. To check the effect of deionized water on light attenuation with the increase of optical path, deionized water (i.e., OD660 =0) was served as Control."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Cell concentration of the culture was determined regularly by measuring the optical density at a wavelength of 660nm (i.e., OD660) using a spectrophotometer (Spectrumlab 22pc, Shanghai, China). As the light source, tungsten lamps of 60W were used in the experiment. The light intensity was measured with a digital luxmeter (ZDS-10, Shanghai, China). The composition of gas produced (mainly H2 and CO2) was analyzed with a Core Mass Spectrometer (Extrel CMS Max 300-LG, USA), calibrated with standard gas (including 10.1% CO2, 4.94% Ar and 84.96% H2)."
6,Data analysis,"2.5 Data analysis The yield of gas produced in each batch fermentations was corrected under normal conditions (30°C, 0.1MPa). The cumulative hydrogen production was calculated according to the biogas yield and hydrogen composition in collected gas. Substrate conversion efficiency for malate is determined as the ratio of moles of hydrogen that have actually been produced per moles of hydrogen that would have been produced if all of the substrate had been converted to hydrogen through the stoichiometric equation: C4H6O5 +3H2O→6H2 +4CO2·"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of illumination intensity on photo-fermentation hydrogen production of Rhodobacter sphaeroides ZX-5,"3.1 Effect of illumination intensity on photo-fermentation hydrogen production of Rhodobacter sphaeroides ZX-5 In photo-fermentation, the efficiency of hydrogen production by strain ZX-5 is influenced by the illumination intensity. As shown in Table 1 , the volumetric hydrogen production and substrate conversion efficiency of strain ZX-5 increased when the illumination intensity was raised from 2000 to 5000lux, but slightly decreased at above 5000lux. The increase is likely to be caused by higher illumination intensity which provided more ATP and reductive power by the photosynthetic system, which are essential for hydrogen production [26,27]. However, light saturation might have occurred when the photosynthetic system supplied excess ATP and Fdred compared to the capacity of nitrogenase [28]. Nitrogenase activity and hydrogen production decrease when light saturation occurs. Previously, Sasikala et al. [29] carried out a similar study and showed saturation of hydrogen production at 5000lux. In this study, when illumination intensity reached 4000 or 5000lux, 123ml H2/34ml culture medium was achieved and this was the highest volumetric H2 production under standing-culture condition in our investigation. It is concluded that the illumination intensity of 4000–5000lux is the optimum condition for hydrogen photo-fermentation by R. sphaeroides ZX-5, which is similar to that of other reported hydrogen-producing purple non-sulphur (PNS) bacteria [30–32]. The maximum hydrogen production rate and the average hydrogen production rate increased when light intensity was raised from 2000 to 9000lux. But it is worthy to notice that the measurement errors of maximum hydrogen production rate were obviously greater than that of the average hydrogen production rate under the same culture conditions possibly due to the time interval of sampling. Additionally, fermentation period markedly reduced from 91h to 72h as light intensity increased (Table 1). In addition, pH value maintained within a small range regardless of the changes of light intensity."
9,Kinetic model for light attenuation,"3.2 Kinetic model for light attenuation This experiment examined the influences of cell density (denoted by OD660) and optical path (denoted by the depth of photobioreactor) on the characteristic of light attenuation in the culture medium. Previously, Nakada et al. [33] have investigated the light saturation and estimated the hydrogen production rate and the conversion efficiency at various light penetration depths of the reactor. They have demonstrated that the hydrogen production rate decreases rapidly with increasing light penetration depth due to a heterogeneous light distribution. Meanwhile, the light intensity tends to decrease rapidly due to the shading effects arising from increases in the concentration of cells and products or from formation of biofilm on the surface of photobioreactor [34–37]. In this study, we performed a more precise experiment: the intensity of incident light was adjusted to 6800lux, and the deionized water (OD660 =0) set was a control. As shown in Fig. 1 , when cell density and optical path increased, light intensity detected by luxmeter sharply reduced due to the shielding effects of the cells. In other words, the light shading effects appear more noticeably as the culture becomes denser due to the progress of the cultivation or as the depth to which light penetrates the reactor increases. Fig. 1 illustrated the changes of light intensity with respect to cell density and optical path in the R. sphaeroides ZX-5 culture system. From the results, at identical optical path, light intensity seriously decreased as cell density increased. For the photo-fermentation hydrogen producing process, at earlier period of cultivation, the light shading by bacterial cells had very little influence since the cell concentration was lower. However, at the later stage of cultivation, cell concentration reached maximal which enhanced the shielding effects of cells, and in turn drastically reduced light penetration within the medium [34,37]. Using regression analysis method on experiments data, the kinetic equation model for the light attenuation within R. sphaeroides ZX-5 culture medium is derived: (1) I = I 0 exp [ − ( 0.4762 + 0.3266 OD 660 ) L ] where I 0 denotes incident light intensity (lux), I denotes light intensity whose value is dependent on cell density and optical path (lux), L denotes optical path (cm) and OD660 denotes cell density. By F-test, F value=2353.634> F 0.95(2,33)=3.28. Based on this statistical analysis, it proved the kinetic model is correct. Moreover, the calculated values according to Eq. (1) and the measured values by luxmeter matched well except for the results of the deionized water (control) set. Therefore, the above obtained model was further used for estimating the actual light intensity in the tube under different culture conditions."
10,Effect of different culture methods on photo-fermentation hydrogen production of strain ZX-5,"3.3 Effect of different culture methods on photo-fermentation hydrogen production of strain ZX-5 In order to test the effect of mixing on the strain ZX-5 growth and hydrogen production, the shaking-culture was carried out under the illumination intensity of 4000lux in a shaker at 120rpm at 30±1°C. The results were summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 2 . In contrast with standing-culture, the fermentation period of shaking-culture greatly reduced to 60h, but in terms of substrate conversion efficiency, it was lower than standing-culture by 22.76%. However, the maximum and average hydrogen production rate of both cultures showed no significant difference (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 2, OD660 value of shaking-culture exceeded that of standing-culture after 9h from the start of the photo-fermentation. Moreover, OD660 value of both standing- and shaking-culture stayed constant within its range after 18h, at 1.73 and 2.35 respectively, indicating the cultures advanced to stationary phase. Obviously, hydrogen production occurred from 18h. Therefore, it can be concluded that regardless of standing- or shaking-culture, hydrogen production occurred at the stationary phase. Fig. 2 showed that the final total hydrogen production by shaking culture was obviously lower than that by standing-culture. According to Eq. (1), as the value of OD660 increases, the attenuation of light penetration in culture medium worsens, resulting in insufficient light intensity within the shaking-culture medium. It can be deduced that low substrate conversion efficiency of shaking-culture was due to the insufficiency of light intensity. However, the hydrogen production in shaking-culture case at the beginning of hydrogen synthesis was higher than that in standing-culture. We speculate the shaking culture is in favor of the mixing of cells and substrate, thus speed up H2 production. In addition, good mixing does favor of H2 removal from the medium. Based on the mentioned experiment results and analysis, we would propose an extra-light supplementation approach to examine whether it is able to improve the substrate conversion efficiency of shaking-culture and ultimately fulfill the objective of maximizing the hydrogen production rate."
11,Effect of shaking and extra-light supplementation (SELS) approach on phototrophic hydrogen production of strain ZX-5,"3.4 Effect of shaking and extra-light supplementation (SELS) approach on phototrophic hydrogen production of strain ZX-5 The distribution of light intensity within photobioreactor was calculated according to Eq. (1) in order to compare the light intensity of standing-culture to that of shaking-culture. The photobioreactor was an anaerobic tube with a diameter of 2cm, the intensity of incident light was 4000lux, and final OD660 values of standing- and shaking-culture were 1.73 and 2.35 respectively. Since the OD660 values at stationary phase were consistent, we used the final OD660 to estimate the actual light intensity in the medium. Calculated according to Eq. (1), the distribution of light intensity under illumination of 4000lux in standing- and shaking-culture medium was summarized in Table 3 . In comparison with standing-culture, under the same initial illumination of 4000lux, light attenuation in shaking-culture was more serious (Table 3), which in turn reduced substrate conversion efficiency and total H2 production. By increasing incident light intensity of shake-culture to 6000lux, the illumination condition in shaking-culture medium was nearly equal to that in standing-culture medium. So we further tested whether extra-light supplementation was able to improve the volumetric hydrogen production and substrate conversion efficiency in shaking-culture. Table 4 describes the performance of phototrophic hydrogen production illuminated with different light intensity in shaking-culture; while the standing-culture batch was carried out under the light intensity of 4000lux as a control. As shown in Table 4, as light intensity increased, volumetric hydrogen production and substrate conversion efficiency of shaking-culture improved as well. An increase in light intensity up to 6000lux improved substrate conversion efficiency up to 86.08% on a par with that of standing-culture, but further increase in light intensity from 6000lux to 8000lux showed no significant difference. The highest substrate conversion efficiency 88.26% was recorded at 8000lux. In addition, as light intensity increased, the maximum and average hydrogen production rate of shaking-culture increased obviously as compared to those of standing-culture, arising from shortened fermentation period and elevated total H2 production. Shaking-culture under the illumination of 8000lux was effective in promoting H2 production, resulting in a 59% and 56% increase in the maximum and average hydrogen production rate respectively, when compared to standing-culture under the illumination of 4000lux, which was the optimum illumination condition for standing-culture. It is certain that light insufficiency and uneven distribution in photobioreactor led to the reduction of H2 production rate and substrate conversion efficiency. Wakayama et al. [38] studied the production of hydrogen under sunlight by photosynthetic bacteria and also found that the hydrogen levels produced depended on the irradiation intensity of the sunlight; they stated that the distribution of light in the reactor influences bacterial activity and when the irradiation exceeded a threshold level, the hydrogen production rate by the photosynthetic bacteria would reach a saturation level. Also, stirring was proved to enhance total hydrogen evolution and the conversion efficiency of substrate to hydrogen by PNS bacteria in photo-fermentation process [39,40]. In conclusion, illumination intensity of 6000–8000lux is the optimum condition for R. sphaeroides ZX-5 in shaking-culture, which is different from optimum condition for standing-culture. Therefore, optimum light intensity for PNS bacteria is not definite, depending on many external and internal factors, e.g. culture methods. During the shaking culture under light intensity from 4000lux to 8000lux, we found surprisingly that the actual OD660 value at stationary phase decreased from 2.35 to 1.86 (Table 4), not the hypothetic constant of 2.35, therefore the actual distribution of light intensity under different illumination in shaking-culture medium was re-calculated and shown in Table 5 . When incident light intensity increased from 5000 to 8000lux, the internal illumination intensity in shaking-culture medium became significantly superior to that in standing-culture medium under illumination of 4000lux. This phenomenon showed that the actual demand of light intensity for hydrogen production under shaking-culture increased markedly. As presented in Fig. 3 , in standing-culture, hydrogen production rate declined gradually after attaining peak hydrogen production rate at 27h. However, in shaking-culture, high-rate hydrogen production lasted for a long period until nearly the end of photo-fermentation. As the ATP supply for photo-H2 production is derived from photophosphorylation alone, we speculate that keeping higher photo-H2 production rate during shaking-culture needs a corresponding higher supply rate of ATP, resulting in the enhanced optimal light intensity in comparison with the standing culture."
12,Performance assessment of the present SELS approach on phototrophic hydrogen production system,"3.5 Performance assessment of the present SELS approach on phototrophic hydrogen production system Table 6 summarizes the present works and relative studies in the literature on phototrophic hydrogen production performance. However, compared to the reported relative studies, photo-hydrogen produced by the SELS approach was able to attain a maximum hydrogen production rate of 165.9ml H2/lh. To our knowledge, this record is currently the highest hydrogen production rate of PNS bacteria, except that of immobilized R. sphaeroides [41,42]. Meanwhile, using this approach, much higher substrate conversion efficiency (88.26%) was obtained. The substrate conversion efficiency and photo-H2 production rate are the two key parameters for developing high-effective and low-cost biohydrogen production system. The proposed SELS method has proved to be capable of attaining high-rate and high-yield phototrophic H2 production at the same time. Moreover, the optimum illumination condition is not constant, depending on many external and internal factors; therefore SELS method broadens the vision of conventional optimum illumination for phototrophic H2 production."
13,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated an innovation of technology to improve photo-H2 production rate simultaneously with substrate conversion efficiency for sustainable, sufficient, and economically feasible phototrophic hydrogen production process. The novel shaking and extra-light supplementation (SELS) approach was shown to effectively enhance the photo-H2 production. To our knowledge, the record of 165.9ml H2/lh obtained by R. sphaeroides using SELS approach is currently the highest hydrogen production rate of PNS bacteria in non-immobilized culture. It is concluded that SELS method appears to be capable of attaining high-rate and high-yield phototrophic H2 production at the same time. The distribution of light intensity is an important factor for photobioreactor design in developing high-yield and high-rate biohydrogen production system. The kinetic equation model, I = I 0exp[−(0.4762+0.3266OD660)·L], well described the relationship among optical path (L), cell density (OD660) and light intensity (I). Thus, this equation could quantitative evaluate the distribution of light intensity during fermentation in photobioreactors. As cell density and optical path increased, light intensity sharply decreased due to the shielding effects of the cells. The optimum illumination condition for shaking-culture by strain ZX-5 increased to 6000–8000lux, markedly higher than that for standing-culture (4000–5000lux). This indicates that the optimum illumination condition for PNS bacteria to produce hydrogen would alter even in the case that some culture environments were changed. Under shaking and elevated illumination (6000–8000lux), the culture was effective in promoting photo-H2 production, resulting in a 59% and 56% increase of the maximum and average hydrogen production rate, respectively, in comparison with the culture under standing and 4000–5000lux conditions. Moreover substrate conversion efficiencies to hydrogen of both cultures were of no significant difference (ca. 89%)."
