0,Introduction,"Dimethyl ether (DME) has been recently recognized as an alternative diesel fuel and potential fuel for power generation and domestic uses. DME is relatively inert, non-corrosive, and non-carcinogenic. The physical properties of DME are similar to those of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It can be easily liquefied, stored and transported using the well-established facilities supplying LPG. In addition, DME can be synthesized directly from syngas, which is more thermodynamically favored, compared to methanol synthesis from syngas. This makes DME production more economically favored. DME will play an important role in the future fuel supply. In fact, DME has been investigated as a potential fuel for automotive proton exchange membrane fuel cell system [1]. DME is also an alternative hydrogen carrier due to its high H/C ratio and high energy density. Hydrogen can be produced from hydrocarbons, alcohols and biomass via catalytic conversion at elevated temperatures [1–5]. In recent years, hydrogen production from DME has attracted increasing interests [6–12]. Galvita et al. reported steam reforming of DME to hydrogen for the first time [8]. Since then studies on the conversion of DME to produce hydrogen have quickly increased. Partial oxidation and steam reforming are usually used to convert DME into hydrogen. Partial oxidation is conducted at 400– 600 ∘ C over supported Ni catalysts [6,7]. Steam reforming of DME is carried out at 200– 400 ∘ C . Multi-component catalysts like Cu, Zn, Pd and/or Pt supported on acidic oxide are often used for this reaction [8–12]. Most of the established or developing processes for hydrogen production are conducted at elevated temperature with the presence of catalysts. These processes need a start-up stage and no hydrogen is produced before the temperature reaches the defined value. In addition, the catalysts inevitably suffer from deactivation. A simple, flexible and quick-responding hydrogen production technology is more favorable for remote and domestic applications where temporary but instant hydrogen supplying is needed. In these regards, cold plasma could be a good choice. Exactly, cold plasmas have attracted much attention in materials, environmental and many other applications. Cold plasma is characterized by highly energetic electrons and low gas temperature. A major advantage of cold plasma is its rapid response. Plasma reactions can be carried out quickly without induction period that exists in conventional catalytic processes. The cold plasmas have been successfully utilized for the production of ozone and have been extensively investigated to convert methane into higher hydrocarbons and syngas [13–16]. The cold plasmas are also promising as a hydrogen generation technology. Water, methane and methanol have been studied as the feedstock [17–23]. Hydrogen has been produced at room temperature but the energy efficiency is very low. We have utilized corona discharge plasma (a type of cold plasmas) to decompose methanol into hydrogen with greatly improved energy efficiency [24]. This process is easily manipulated with quick response, demonstrating great potential for practical applications. Recently, we have further studied a DME decomposition using the corona discharge plasma and achieved a better result for hydrogen production [25]. However, some carbon filaments were produced as the by-products that posed a negative effect on the operation. Steam reforming or partial oxidation may be prior alternatives to solve this problem. With this regard, we have studied the plasma steam reforming of DME [26]. In this work, we aim to investigate the partial oxidation of DME to hydrogen at ambient conditions using the corona discharge plasma, in order to obtain a stable operation and to further improve the energy efficiency."
1,Experimental,"Fig. 1 shows the schematic representative of the corona discharge apparatus used in this work. A quartz tube (i.d. 6mm) was used as the tubular reactor. The corona discharge plasma was initiated between two electrodes placed in the quartz tube. The top electrode was a stainless steel pin (with a diameter of 2mm) and the bottom electrode was a circular stainless steel disk with a diameter of 5mm and a thickness of ca. 1.5mm. There were four holes (i.d. 1mm) on the disk to facilitate the flow of gas. The gap between the two electrodes was 6mm. The top electrode was connected with a high voltage amplifier (Trek, 20/20B) and the bottom electrode was grounded. The discharge was generated by a DC and AC voltage supplied by a power supply unit consisting of a signal generator (HP 33120A) and the high voltage amplifier. Four types of waveforms with frequency ranging from 0 to 15kHz were used. The input waveform was 2.0kHz sinusoid if not specifically addressed in the discussions below. The discharge voltage and current were measured with a high voltage probe (Tektronix P6015) and a pulse current transformer (Pearson Electronics 411) and recorded with a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix 2440). The consumed power was measured with a digital multimeter (Keithley 2000). The temperature of electrode inside the reactor was measured using an infrared camera (Ircon, 100PHT) [27]. The temperature was calibrated by adjusting its emissivity until the recorded temperature equaled to the known temperature of the electrode ( 150 ∘ C ) that was placed inside the quartz tube and heated by an external heater. The temperature was measured when it reached a stable value (after the reaction being conducted for 10min). We have previously shown that the dilute gas Ar can improve the energy efficiency of plasma DME decomposition [25]. Therefore Ar was used as the dilute gas in this work. The flow rate of DME and Ar was 1.02mmol/min ( 22.9 cm 3 / min ) and 2.25mmol/min ( 50.6 cm 3 / min ) , respectively. The flow rate of O2 was controlled using a mass flow controller. The effluent gas was cooled by mixture of ice and water and then analyzed with an on-line MS (AVI-GmbH, Ominstar). The effluent flow rate was measured with a bubble meter. The gas product included H2, CO and CO2. Carbon deposits were measured with gravimetric analysis. The analysis showed good carbon balance in the range of 97–102%. The conversions were defined as DME: x DME %= ( rate of DME consumed / rate of DME introduced ) × 100 % O2: x O 2 %= ( rate of O 2 consumed / rate of O 2 introduced ) × 100 % The selectivities were defined as H2: S H 2 %= [ rate of H 2 produced × 2 / ( rate of DME consumed × 6 ) ] × 100 % CO: S CO %= [ rate of CO produced / ( rate of DME consumed × 2 ) ] × 100 % CO2: S CO 2 %= [ rate of CO 2 produced / ( rate of DME consumed × 2 ) ] × 100 % C: S C %= 100 - S CO - S CO 2 The energy efficiency was defined as the mass of H2 produced with 1kWh power consumed: Energy efficiency (gH2/kWh)=[rate of H2 production (g/min) × 60]/power consumed (kW)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Comparison of partial oxidation with decomposition reactions,"3.1 Comparison of partial oxidation with decomposition reactions Table 1 shows results of decomposition and partial oxidation of DME. For DME decomposition, the selectivities of CO and C are both 50%, and the selectivity of H2 is 100%. The H2/CO/C ratio equals to 3/1/1, indicating that DME is decomposed in the plasma zone: (1) CH 3 OCH 3 → 3 H 2 + CO + C . With this reaction, a significant amount of carbon filaments are produced. Carbon deposit will deteriorate the discharge and cause the operation unstable in the present design of discharge reactor. As shown in Fig. 2 , the conversion of DME sustains for only 15min and then quickly declines. The reaction is ultimately ceased when the space between two electrodes are filled with carbon filament. To restart the reaction, the carbon deposits in the wall of reactor and surface of electrodes have to be cleaned. It can be seen that the DME decomposition has to be operated intermittently, which is not suitable for practical application. The presence of oxygen can significantly suppress the formation of carbon deposit. As shown in Table 1, when equal amount of O2 is present as the co-reactant, the selectivity of CO is as high as 99.3% whereas that of carbon is only 0.7%, indicating that carbon deposits are completely inhibited: (2) C + 1 2 O 2 → CO . Fig. 2 shows that the partial oxidation reaction is very stable. During a 3-h operation, the conversion of DME does not change and the reactor and electrodes are clean without obvious carbon deposit. Moreover, partial oxidation can improve the reaction rate and the energy efficiency. The conversion of DME is 1.31 times higher and the rate of H2 production is 1.23 times higher than that of decomposition reaction, respectively. And the energy efficiency is 1.63 times higher than that of decomposition reaction. The discharge parameters are also different when oxygen is introduced as co-reactant. Fig. 3 shows the waveforms of the discharge voltage and current. With the presence of oxygen, the voltage (peak–peak value) required for the discharge is dramatically reduced, indicating that the plasma is more easily ignited in the oxygen-containing gas. More importantly, the current waveform exhibits many pulses that are the characteristic of streamer discharge. These pulses are welcomed because they are very efficient to induce chemical reactions and to improve the reaction rate [14]. These results can be explained by different pathways for decomposition and partial oxidation reactions. The decomposition is started by the dissociation of DME molecules through collision with energetic electrons of Ar plasma [28] (3) CH 3 OCH 3 + e * → CH 3 O + CH 3 + e , Δ H 298 K = 81.10 kcal / mol , (4) CH 3 OCH 3 + e * → CH 3 OCH 2 + H + e , Δ H 298 K = 92.93 kcal / mol , where asterisk means the electrons with higher energy. Then the formed species further dissociate through the activation of electron and hydrogen abstraction by H species. When oxygen presents in the system, the reaction pathway is changed. O 2 is easy to trap electrons and form negative ions because of its electronegative nature. Then oxygen is readily activated by dissociative attachment [29,30]: (5) O 2 + e * → O 2 - , (6) O 2 - → 2 O + e . This process requires the least energy in comparison with the other reactions. The formed oxygen species can directly activate DME [31]: (7) CH 3 OCH 3 + O → CH 3 OCH 2 + OH , Δ H 298 K = 2.85 kcal / mol . Therefore, the presence of oxygen can facilitate the plasma conversion of DME, which is in agreement with the case of methane conversion [29,30]. When no reactants are introduced, the plasma exhibits sky-blue margin. The electrode temperature is only 30 ∘ C as shown by thermal images in Fig. 4 , indicating that heating caused by plasma is very low. The discharge zone becomes brighter and the temperature reaches 82 ∘ C when DME is introduced. The presence of oxygen turns the plasma zone to significantly bright with red color, with the temperature further rising to 118 ∘ C . This suggests that exothermal oxidation reactions occur."
4,Effect of O2/DME ratio,"3.2 Effect of O2/DME ratio Fig. 5 shows the effect of the O2/DME ratio on the selectivities of products. The selectivity of carbon is decreased when the O2/DME ratio is increased, indicating that the formed carbon is oxidized by oxygen. As a result, the selectivity of CO is increased. When the O2/DME ratio is increased to 1.05, carbon deposit is completely inhibited and the selectivity of CO is near 100%. At this point, the reaction turns to a partial oxidation reaction: (8) CH 3 OCH 3 + 1 2 O 2 → 3 H 2 + 2 CO . If the ratio is further increased, the selectivity of CO will be reduced and CO2 is formed. The selectivity of CO2 gradually increases with the increase of the concentration of oxygen. As the ratio is increased from 1.05 to 2.51, the selectivity of CO is decreased from 99.2% to 70.2% whereas that of CO2 is increased from 0% to 29.7%. These results suggest that the higher concentration of O2 will lead to the complete oxidation reaction: (9) CO + 1 2 O 2 → CO 2 , (10) H 2 + 1 2 O 2 → H 2 O . Although the complete oxidations occur, the selectivity of H2 does not decline much and the production of H2O is nearly un-detectable. This result seems contradictive to the fact that hydrogen is easy to be oxidized to form water. There are two possible reasons for this abnormal experimental result. Firstly, H2O in plasma can be dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen through the converse reaction of Eq. (10) [17,18,29,30,32]: (11) H 2 O → H 2 + 1 2 O 2 . Secondly, H2O has been used to eliminate carbon deposits formed in plasma reaction. This indicates that the reaction between H2O and carbon is easy to take place in plasma [13,26]: (12) H 2 O + C → H 2 + CO . Therefore, H2O derived from hydrogen oxidation is most likely conversely transferred to hydrogen through the pathway mentioned above. As shown in Fig. 6 , the temperature of electrode is very low when only decomposition reaction occurs. It slowly increases with the increase of percentage of partial oxidation (with the O2/DME ratio less than 1.05). When the complete oxidation reaction occurs (with the O2/DME ratio more than 1.38), the process becomes strongly exothermic and the temperature of electrode linearly increases. It is as high as 202 ∘ C when the ratio is 2.51. Fig. 7 shows the effect of the O2/DME ratio on the conversion and conversion rate of reactants. The conversion of DME increases with the increase of O2/DME ratio and reaches the highest value when the ratio is 1.38. Thereafter it stays as a stable value. The conversion of O2 decreases with the increase of O2/DME ratio but the conversion rate always increases. Fig. 8 shows the rate of H2 production and energy efficiency under the influence of O2/DME ratio. The highest rate of H2 production appears when the O2/DME ratio is 1.38, in agreement with the highest conversion of DME. The energy efficiency is also the highest under this condition."
5,Effects of frequency and waveform,"3.3 Effects of frequency and waveform The corona discharge plasma can be ignited by high voltage with various waveforms and frequencies. Four types of waveforms, sinusoid, sinusoid triangular, square and ramp with the frequency ranging from 0 to 15kHz were investigated to optimize the operation conditions. Fig. 9 shows that the rate of H2 production is very low when the DC voltage ( frequency = 0 ) is applied. The AC voltage induces an obviously higher reaction rate. The reaction rate increases quickly with the increase of frequency and reaches the highest value when the input frequency is increased to 2kHz. Then the reaction rate does not change much with frequency. Fig. 10 shows that the energy efficiency is significantly improved for the DC plasma. As to the effect of the waveforms, the rate of H2 production and the order of energy efficiency increases in the following order: sinusoid > sinusoid triangular > square > ramp. Figs. 11 and 3a show the waveforms of the discharge voltage and current. Although the input waveforms are different, the discharge waveforms are similar. The current (peak–peak value) decreases as following: ramp (40.8mA) > sinusoid (38.7mA) > sinusoid triangular (34.2mA) > square (22.5mA). Higher current means more electrons produced from plasma that can induce chemical reactions, thereby which should result in a high reaction rate. This is true for sinusoid waveform. However, the rise time to ignite plasma for ramp waveform is much longer compared with the others. This means that the effective period in each cycle is very short, which fatally reduces the reactive efficiency. Therefore, the sinusoid is the best among the four types of waveforms."
6,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production from the partial oxidation of DME using corona discharge plasma has been studied. Hydrogen is produced at ambient conditions without the use of catalysts and external heating. The partial oxidation can inhibit the formation of undesired carbon deposits existing in the decomposition of DME. The partial oxidation is very stable for a long-term operation. The hydrogen generation reaction is also greatly improved. The optimal O2/DME ratio is 1.38, where the rate of H2 production is 1.33 times higher and the energy efficiency is 1.72 times higher than that of the DME decomposition. The AC plasma is more efficient than the DC plasma and the favorable frequency is 2kHz. The order of desired waveform is: sinusoid > sinusoid triangular > square > ramp."
