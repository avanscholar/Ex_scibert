0,Introduction,"Metal catalyzed carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom reactions are powerful tools that are widely utilized by the synthetic chemist in a great number of syntheses. 1 Key to the success of such catalytic reactions is the development of new methodologies, ligands and (or) pre-catalysts. N-alkylation of amines is an important class of reactions 2 applied in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and functional materials. Traditionally, reactive alkyl halides have been used for the production of N-alkylated amines which often produces over-alkylated products. This method not only reduces the overall yield of the product but also produces stoichiometric amounts of waste. On the other hand use of alcohols as alkylating reagents has emerged as an interesting greener approach, owing to the fact that it produces only water as a byproduct by using “hydrogen borrowing” methodology. 2 As alluded in the literature, 2,5c the poor electrophilic alcohols are converted to more active carbonyl intermediates by temporary removal of hydrogen from the alcohols. In the presence of amine the insitu formed carbonyl is converted into imine, which upon hydrogenation forms the final alkylated amine by transferring the borrowed hydrogen (Scheme 1 ). Various catalytic systems using different metals have been developed and used for the N-alkylation of amines using alcohols. 2–7 However in comparison with the Ru 3 and Ir 4 based catalysts, there are limited studies on the development of Pd-based 5 catalysts or pre-catalysts, especially homogeneous 5c,5e pre-catalysts for N-alkylation of amines using alcohols. Recently Ramón and co-workers 5e reported Pd(OAc)2 (1 mol %) in the presence of 100 mol % of CsOH at temperatures of 130–150 °C in toluene as the solvent. Using benzylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, up to 99% yield of the alkylated amine was reported. However, this system was not active under the optimized conditions when aliphatic or secondary alcohols were used as the alkylating agents. In 2013, Seayad and co-workers 5c reported (Scheme 2 ) PdCl2 as a catalyst in the presence of dppe or Xantphos(t-Bu) as the ligand for the N-alkylation of primary and cyclic secondary amines, with TON up to 900 using neat reagents (no solvent) at temperatures of 90–150 °C. It is noteworthy to mention that an improved TON of about 46000 was reported using supported-palladium NiXantphos complex. 5b Keeping these reported results in mind we focused our efforts in developing more active homogenous catalysts for the N-alkylation of amines using alcohols. Palladacycles 8 are the most promising and versatile catalysts (or) pre-catalyst in carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions. Owing to their facile synthesis, easy handling and possibility of tuning electronic and steric properties many research groups have devoted their efforts in synthesizing new palladacycles and studying their applications in catalysis, organic synthesis, materials and medicinal chemistry. Among the different types of palladacycles, pyrazole-based palladacycles are scarcely studied 8d for their applications towards catalysis. Grigg and co-workers showed that pyrazole-based palladacycles could effectively be used for CC bond formation. 8f In a recent study we 8e showed the synthesis of 1,3,5-triphenylpyrazole palladium dimer and its catalytic activity towards Mizoroki-Heck and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Although ample reports exist for the dehydrogenation of alcohols, 8c CN and CC bond formations using alkyl or aryl halides as reagents and palladacycles as catalyst or pre-catalyst, 9 surprisingly to the best of our knowledge none of the palladacycle based pre-catalysts have been tested for the N-alkylation of amines and sulfanilamide using alcohols as reagent. Herein, we report a new palladacycle which is stable in air- and moisture and highly active towards N-alkylation of amines and sulfanilamide."

10,Results and discussion,
11,Synthesis and characterization of palladacycle,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of palladacycle The palladium pre-catalyst (palladacycle (1)) was synthesized in two steps from commercially available starting materials according to literature reported method. 8e,f The formation of the pre-catalyst was confirmed by standard techniques like 1H, 13C &19F NMR spectroscopy, HRMS and elemental analysis as well as single crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. 1 , Table S1). It is noteworthy to mention that the palladacycle (1) reported in this study shows CH bond activation on the 3-phenyl of the pyrazole and not on the N-phenyl of the pyrazole as observed in our previous studies. 8e,11"
12,Optimization and study of catalyst efficiency towards N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol,"3.2 Optimization and study of catalyst efficiency towards N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol Initially, we studied the reaction of benzyl alcohol with aniline as a model reaction using different bases/solvents, 4 Å molecular sieves for 24 h by using 0.2 mol % of pre-catalyst and 0.4 mol % of PPh3(1:1 ratio metal to ligand) as a ligand at 120 °C. After screening various solvents and bases, we found that LiOH (50 mol%) was the best choice under solvent free conditions (Table 1 ). The use of carbene as a ligand resulted a low yield of only 19%. When we lowered the temperature from 120 °C to 100 °C using PPh3 as a ligand the yield got reduced from 91% to 26%. To determine the best suited phosphine for a particular reaction, in many instances it is necessary to rely on a trial and error type screening process. 12 Keeping this in mind we examined the effect of different phosphines at 100 °C. The combination of the pre-catalyst with P(2-Fur)3 gave an almost quantitative yield (98%) of the N-alkylated product. Next, the amount of P(2-Fur)3 loading with respect to pre-catalyst was evaluated. It was found that 2:1 ratio of the P(2-Fur)3 to pre-catalyst is optimum to get maximum yield of the desired product (see Table 2 , entries 8,9,10 and 11). In the absence of P(2-Fur)3, the combination of the pre-catalyst with the base gave a low yield of 12% (Table 2, entry 14). Under similar conditions, in the absence of the pre-catalyst no product formation was observed (Table 2, entry 13), however palladium precursors such as Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2 or Pd2(dba)3 gave lower yields of 26%, 46% and 37% respectively (Table 2, entry 16, 17 & 18). It is noteworthy that the N-phenyl ring of pyrazole ligand with electron withdrawing group (CF3) gave high yields of the N-alkylated product. However, our previously reported palladacycle 8e did not yield any product under the reaction conditions mentioned above. The observed results are consistent with pyrazole-based palladacycles reported by Grigg and co-workers, where fluorinated pyrazoles show superior activity for the Heck reaction. We believe that fluorination on pyrazoles plays a very important role for the observed catalytic activity of our palladacycle reported in this study over the non-fluorinated pyrazole. The efficiency of the catalyst for the N-alkylation of aniline using benzyl alcohol as an alkylating agent was studied by gradually decreasing the pre-catalyst loading from 0.2 mol% to 0.001 mol% and by increasing the temperature from 100 °C to 130 °C (Table 3 ). With 0.01 mol % of pre-catalyst at 100 °C, 93% (TON = 4600) of the N-alkylated product was observed. When the catalyst loading was lowered to 0.001 mol %, the pre-catalyst exhibited higher turnover number (43000) at 130 °C, which is among the highest TON's (Table 3, entry 11) reported for any homogeneous Pd-based catalytic system till date for N-alkylation of amines using aniline and benzyl alcohol."
13,Substrate scope of the reaction for N-alkylation of various amines using primary and secondary alcohols,"3.3 Substrate scope of the reaction for N-alkylation of various amines using primary and secondary alcohols With these optimized conditions, we examined the substrate scope of the reaction using various substituted anilines, secondary amines and heterocyclic amines with benzyl alcohol at 100 °C using 0.2 mol % of pre-catalyst (Table 4 ). As presented in Table 4, most of the amines underwent the coupling reactions with benzyl alcohol to yield the desired product in good to excellent yields. Aromatic amines such as aniline, o,p-methoxy aniline, o,m,p-methyl aniline, o,p-fluoroaniline and benzylamine were alkylated to give the corresponding N-benzyl amines in isolated yields of 74–98% (Table 4, compounds 1–9). Cyclic secondary amines were also readily alkylated to the corresponding tertiary amines in good yields (Table 4, compounds 11 and 12). Aromatic primary alcohols such as p-methyl benzyl alcohol, p-methoxy benzyl alcohol were also used as alkylating agents (Table 4, compounds 14, 15). Sterically hindered o-methyl benzyl alcohol, o-methoxy benzyl alcohol and 2-biphenyl methanol were also efficiently utilized as alkylating agents at 120 °C (Table 4, compounds 15, 16 and 17). o-Toluidine was also successfully alkylated with 3,4-methylenedioxy benzyl alcohol (Table 4, compound 18). However, 4-chloroaniline and 4-bromoaniline were failed to give the desired products. The least reactive and more challenging alcohols such as aliphatic alcohols and secondary alcohols were also tested for N-alkylation using our pre-catalyst (Table 5 ). The reaction between aliphatic alcohols such as 1-octanol, 1-hexanol, n-butanol with p-methoxy aniline or aniline provided the corresponding N-alkylated product in good isolated yield of more than 72% (Table 5, compounds 19, 20, 21 and 22). The reactions of benzyl alcohol with p-trifluoromethylaniline and 2-phenylethanol with p-methoxyaniline progressed well to give the corresponding secondary amines in 76% and 72% isolated yields respectively (Table 5, compounds 31 & 23). To our delight, a good yield of N-alkylated morpholine was achieved with 2-phenylethanol as an alkylating reagent (Table 5, compound 32). When we applied this approach to the more challenging secondary alcohols such as 1-phenylpropanol, 1-phenylethanol,1-(3-methylphenyl)ethanol, 1-(4-methylphenyl)-1-propanol, 2-hexanol, 2-decanol, 1-phenyl 2-propanol and cylohexanol at 120 °C (or) 130 °C, they were successfully alkylated to the corresponding amines (Table 5, compounds 25–30, 33–35). Heteroaromatic amines, such as 4-aminopyridine, 2-aminopyridine and 2-aminopyramidine, were also efficiently alkylated under these conditions to give the products 36, 37, and 38 in 84%, 96% and 97% yields respectively (Table 6 ). 2-Aminopyridine was successfully alkylated with 1-decanol and gave quantitative yield of the corresponding product (Table 6, compound 42). Heteroaromatic aryl alcohols such as 2-pyridinemethanol, 3-pyridinemethanol and furfuryl alcohol were also efficiently utilized as alkylating reagents at moderate temperatures (Table 6, compounds 39, 43 and 44). Interestingly, 2-amino benzothiazole (Table 6, compounds 40 and 41) selectively alkylated at the primary amine position with benzyl alcohol and 1-naphthyl methanol. 13 As reported in the literature the regioselective N-alkylation of 2-amino benzothiazole is a challenging task, here we show that our pre-catalyst has the potential to prepare 2-(N-alkyamine)benzothiazoles via regioselective N-alkylation of 2-amino benzothiazoles with benzylic alcohols. Compared to the solvent free condition, the use of representative reactions using non-polar solvent (tert-butylbenzene) gave relatively low yields for the N-alkylation of amines (Table 4, compounds 1, 2, 5; Table 5, compounds 22, 35; Table 6, compound 37)."
14,Regioselective N-alkylation of sulfanilamide using benzyl alcohols,"3.4 Regioselective N-alkylation of sulfanilamide using benzyl alcohols Inspired by the regioselective N-alkylation of sulfanilamides using alcohols reported by Feng Li and co-workers 14a,14b we attempted N-alkylation of sulfanilamide using alcohols. To our delight our pre-catalyst successfully alkylated sulfanilamide, regioselectively, at moderate temperatures (Table 7 , compounds 45–49). As representative examples, single crystals of product 49, were grown and analysed using X-ray crystallography to confirm the regioselectivity (Fig. 2 ). Benzyl alcohol having electron withdrawing group such as CF3 gave the N-alkylated product in 64% yield. Furthermore, benzyl alcohol bearing electron donating group such as methyl and methoxy gave the desired products 46 and 47 in 71% and 64% yield respectively."
15,Synthesis of piribedil by using our palladacycle,"3.5 Synthesis of piribedil by using our palladacycle Furthermore, we established the synthetic utility of our palladacyle in the synthesis of piribedil, 3d which is clinically used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. To our delight the reaction of 1-(pyrimidin-2-yl)piperazine with piperonyl alcohol in the presence of 0.5 mol % of palladacycle afforded 76% isolated yield (Scheme 3 )."
16,Proposed mechanism,"3.6 Proposed mechanism A plausible mechanism is proposed based on the control experiment. As shown in Scheme S1, under our optimized reaction conditions, 3 mmol of aniline and 3.6 mmol of benzyl alcohol was refluxed for 12 h. The resultant crude product was analysed using 1H NMR (Fig. S1). The formation of aldehyde and imine was observed, suggesting that abstraction of hydrogen atoms takes place to generate benzaldehyde followed by condensation of amine to form imine. Finally, the desired product is obtained by hydrogenation of the imine as shown in Scheme 4 . 5c, 15"
17,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated that a pyrazole based palladacycle synthesized from simple starting materials is a highly active and versatile catalyst or pre-catalyst for the N-alkylation of amines using alcohols as reagent under solvent free condition. Our palladacycle provided very high turnover numbers for N-alkylation of amines compared to the palladium based homogeneous catalysts or pre-catalysts reported in the literature. Notably, our palladacycle has been shown to be an active regioselective catalyst for the monoalkylation of sulfanilamide."
