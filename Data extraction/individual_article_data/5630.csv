0,Introduction,"Renewable jet fuel production from alternative biobased feedstocks is gaining traction in recent years mainly due to the concerns associated with the adverse environmental effects of fossil fuel use in the aviation industry, and the energy security [1]. Several biobased feedstocks, such as canola, camelina, soybean, and carinata oilseeds, have been considered as potential sources for the production of renewable jet fuel [1,2]. However, jet fuel production from these feedstocks at the commercial scale is still encumbering mainly due to high cost of production, competition with food resources, impacts on the ecosystem due to changes in land use patterns, as well as environmental impacts associated with feedstock production and conversion processes [3–6]. Renewable jet fuel production technologies vary based on the type of feedstock. Four of the most common technologies include alcohol-to-jet, syngas-to-jet, sugar-to-jet, and oil-to-jet [7]. Alcohols, e.g., ethanol and butanol, can be converted to jet fuel through dehydration and oligomerization processes [8]. Syngas-to-jet technology includes Fischer-Tropsch and gas fermentation to produce jet fuel from hydrogen and carbon monoxide [9]. Sugar-to-jet technology includes catalytic upgrading or biological conversion processes to produce hydrocarbons from sugars and sugar intermediates [10]. Oil-to-jet technology is used for conversion of oil extracted from oleaginous feedstocks, including oilseeds and other oil- or lipid-based feedstocks, such as algae and waste oil, into renewable jet fuel [7]. Hydroprocessing technology is currently the most common oil-to-jet technology [11]. This technology is at a relatively developed stage, and has been identified as the most profitable pathway to produce hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) from oleaginous feedstocks [12–15]. Through hydroprocessing technology, vegetable oil is converted to hydrocarbons containing the carbon chains mainly in the range of renewable diesel and jet fuel. This technology is effective to produce drop-in quality HRJ, which is equivalent of petroleum-based jet fuel [2], and it can be used as jet fuel blendstocks at up to 50 vol%, by common aviation fleets [16]; thus, bringing significant strategic and financial benefits to the aviation industry [17]. In addition, this technology can be used for conversion of algal and microbial triglycerides to HRJ, which can reduce dependency on food resources, e.g., vegetable oils [18]. So far, HRJ from oilseeds has been used by several of the airlines at the demonstration scale [15,19]; however, to be a viable alternative to the petroleum-based jet fuel, HRJ should be producible in large scale with available resources and technology level, be economically competitive and have environmental benefits. Evaluation of techno-economics of commercial HRJ production from different biobased feedstocks has been the focuse of multiple studies (Table 1 ), all of which have identified the high cost of production as the major challenge towards commercialization of biobased HRJ production [20–23]. Feedstock has been identified as the largest contributor to the total HRJ production cost from soybean, sunflower, palm and macaw through hydroprocessing technology, as well as from corn, sugarcane, and sweet sorghum through alcohol-to-jet technology [24]. Some oilseeds, such as camelina, carinata, and soybean, have been identified as the promising feedstocks in terms of low production cost [25,26], and greenhouse gas emissions reduction [17,27]. Although commercial production of soybean has been established [28], there are concerns regarding technical feasibility of supply of camelina and carinata at the commercial scale [29]. In addition, at the current state of technology, HRJ production from these oilseeds is not economically viable compared to petroleum-based jet fuel mainly due to high cost of feedstock supply which causes higher selling price of HRJ [25]. Minimum selling price (MSP) of HRJ form tallow (0.79–1.42 USD/L), soybean (0.87–1.60 USD/L) and camelina (2.90 USD/L) was found to be higher than the 5-year average price of petroleum-based jet fuel (0.64 USD/L) [14,15]. In addition, recent literature has highlighted the dominant contribution of feedstock supply to the overall production cost of HRJ from oilseeds. For example, contribution of feedstock supply to the overall production cost of camelina-based HRJ was reported as 80–90% [30]; and feedstock supply highly affected the economics of HRJ production from carinata [25]. Pennycress (Thalaspi arvense) is a potential jet fuel feedstock with several advantages, in that it can be grown with low levels of inputs, such as fertilizer and pesticide [32], as well as without additional land requirement, because it can serve as a cover-crop to be planted between corn and soybean in corn-soybean cropping system [1,33,34]. It is estimated that there are ~12 million ha of land under corn-soybean rotation in the Midwestern U.S., which are currently left as fallow during the winter, and cause several environmental consequences, such as soil erosion, run off and nutrients load to the water bodies [35]. Planting pennycress in these lands, i.e., almost half of the U.S. annual soybean production land, can potentially produce 9–15 million tons of pennycress grain per year [36]. It will also provide the opportunity for soil and root carbon storage and consequently climate change mitigation [37]. In addition, pennycress grain has 25–36% oil content, i.e., comparable to, or higher than, that of the other oilseeds, such as soybean, camelina and canola, with acceptable quality to produce renewable jet fuel [38,39]. Pennycress can potentially be supplied at lower price compared to similar oilseeds, such as soybean and canola, due to lower inputs requirement [32]. In addition, due to the similarities of pennycress oil fatty acid profile to that of the similar oilseeds, such as canola, the yield and quality of pennycress-based HRJ is expected to be similar to HRJ from other oilseeds [40]. Despite merits of pennycress as potential HRJ feedstock, literature lacks a thorough assessment of techno-economics of HRJ production from pennycress at the commercial scale. A recent study [14] compared the costs of HRJ production from several types of vegetable oil, including pennycress oil (Table 1). Although pennycress oil was considered in comparative evaluations, the study did not include the complete processes of pennycress oil extraction and conversion to HRJ. It is also worth mentioning that due to the high levels of glycosinolates and erucic acid in pennycress grain, currently pennycress meal cannot be used as a protein source for animal feed which is the typical use of meal from similar oilseeds [41,42]. This is expected to highly affect the economic viability of pennycress-based HRJ production due to reducing the byproduct credit associated with the meal [17]. Due to all these reasons, thorough assessment of techno-economics of pennycress oil extraction and conversion to HRJ at the commercial scale is becoming more important. The objective of this study was to assess the technical feasibility and costs of pennycress-based HRJ production at the commercial scale. Resources and consumables requirements, equipment capacities, labor and utilities requirements, costs, revenue, and credits were estimated and the economics of pennycress-based HRJ was evaluated. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to analyze the influences of potential variations in different input parameters and alternative processes on the MSP of pennycress-based HRJ. The outcomes of this research help identify the bottlenecks and key parameters affecting the technical feasibility and economic viability of establishing the HRJ biorefineries in the Midwestern U.S.; thus they are useful for the biobased industries, farmers, investors, and policy makers."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Techno-economic modeling,"2.1 Techno-economic modeling 2.1.1 Process simulation The HRJ biorefinery capacity was considered based on the U.S. small-scale biodiesel plants, as it is expected that the initial commercial biobased HRJ plants will be of smaller size. Out of the total 100 biodiesel plants currently operational in the U.S., the capacities of the lower 50 are in the range 0.03–15 million gal/yr (MGPY), with the average of 5.09 MGPY [43]. Thus, the capacity of HRJ biorefinery for this analysis was considered to be 5 MGPY (~18.9 million L/yr (MLPY)). System boundaries for the analysis included pennycress grain handling and conditioning, oil extraction, oil conversion to HRJ, meal processing, wastewater treatment (WWT), and steam and electricity generation (Fig. 1 ), as discussed in detail in the following section. The process model was built in SuperPro Designer software v10 [44], and the mass balance was conducted by quantifying the mass rate of inputs and outputs for the defined system. The process parameters, e.g., temperature, pressure, efficiencies, residence time, etc., were considered as indicated in the following section. Process data obtained from SuperPro Designer built-in model was used for equipment sizing, and determining the required number of different equipment. 2.1.2 System overview This study assumed that the oil extraction and HRJ production are based in the same biorefinery to take advantages of shared resources and minimize the transportation and storage requirements. The system comprised of different processes for oil extraction from pennycress grain up to production of HRJ and byproducts, which includes pennycress grain handling and conditioning, mechanical and solvent oil extraction, oil purification, hydrogenation, hydrocracking, separation, pennycress meal processing, and WWT processes (Fig. 1). 2.1.2.1 Pennycress grain handling and conditioning Typical operations for handling and conditioning of oilseeds include receiving, cleaning, drying, flaking, and conditioning (or cooking) [45], which have also been considered for pennycress grain in this study (Fig. 1). Small grains, e.g., canola, are graded based on multiple factors, e.g., dockage, heating, rate of infestation, type of grain, moisture, and odor [46]. Grain cleaning usually includes a vibrating screen designed to remove the fine and oversized particles, and aspiration to remove the light foreign materials which include 1.5–1.8% of pennycress grain, similar to that of other small grains [45,47,48]. For this analysis, foreign materials were considered to be 1.5w%. Cleaned grain is pre-heated at 30-40 °C to prevent shattering which is caused when cold grain enters the flaking unit [17]. The preheating temperature of 35 °C considered for pennycress grain conditioning in this study. Preheated grain is then flaked to break the coat, using a set of roller mills. During the flaking process, the pennycress grain is squeezed into flakes with 0.30–0.38 mm thickness. This results in the cell wall of oilseeds being distorted to make the solvent easier to diffuse through the grain particles, which makes the oil more accessible [45]. The flaked grain is then heated to 75-100 °C (average 85 °C, also used for this analysis), mainly for rupturing the intact cells to release the oil, denaturing the protein, and adjusting the moisture content of conditioned grain before entering the oil extraction process. 2.1.2.2 Oil extraction Oil content of pennycress grain ranges from 25 to 36% [38,39]. This study considered an average oil content of 29%. Typically, oil is extracted from oilseeds in two steps, including mechanical press and solvent extraction [49], which were also considered for pennycress oil extraction in this study. Mechanical press is usually performed using a screw press to remove 50–60% of available oil from the flaked and conditioned grain [45], with 55% considered for this analysis. This makes the solvent extraction more efficient and economic. The oil flow of the mechanical press usually has meal fine, which is returned to the mechanical press after passing through a filtration or sedimentation mechanism [49]. Sedimentation mechanism was considered for this study. The pressed material, which is known as press cake, is then processed with solvent extraction for further oil extraction. During the solvent extraction, a solvent specifically produced for the vegetable oil industry (typically n-hexane) is used to achieve sufficiently low residual oil contents (usually less than 1%) in the meal [50], which was considered for this study. The solvent is flammable; so, the solvent extraction operation is usually performed in an isolated area. Solvent extraction includes three steps, namely extraction, solvent distillation, and liquid-phase recovery [45]. There are different mechanical designs for the solvent extraction process; this study considered the basket and continuous loop extractors which are the most common extractors for oil extraction from canola and similar oilseeds [51]. In this design, the press cake is deposited into individual deep baskets of the extractor and purged or washed with a solvent which releases the oil in the press cake. The most common flake depth is 2–3 m. The baskets, supported on the drainage screens, are filled with press cake, and during the rotary movement, the solvent and oil solution, also known as miscella, are passed, while the solid part, also known as meal, is retained in the basket and deposited at the exit [48]. During the extraction, the press cake and solvent-oil miscella usually move in an opposite direction using a countercurrent flow device [45]. The upper limit of extractor operating temperature is 63 °C, which is less than the boiling temperature of commercial hexane (i.e., 64–69 °C) [42]. To provide a safety margin, the operating temperature was suggested to be 60 °C [45], and thus was considered for this study. Total residence time in the extractor, including the washing and draining time, is typically 50 min, which is divided into 30 min for washing and 20 min for draining, as suggested elsewhere [45]. The oil content of the hexane-saturated meal, which leaves the extractor, was considered to be less than 1%, containing 25–35% residual solvent, as suggested in the literature [51]. After extraction, the pennycress meal is conveyed to the desolventizing equipment. Miscella, containing 25–30% oil is also proceed to solvent recovery to separate oil and solvent [45]. The recovered solvent was considered to be recirculated for reuse in the solvent extraction process, as suggested in the literature [45]. In addition, a make-up solvent was considered to be added to compensate the solvent losses during the recovery step. After solvent recovery process, the crude pennycress oil was considered to pass through the purification process. 2.1.2.3 Oil purification Crude vegetable oil contains several impurities; and it is usually purified through degumming process [52], which was also considered for this study. Degumming is used for removing phosphatides, particulate impurities such as meal residue, as well as water-soluble compounds such as sugars and glycolipids [53]. In this step, color pigments and free fatty acids are also separated [45]. During the degumming step, crude oil is heated up to 80 °C and a water and citric acid solution, containing 30% citric acid, is added to the degumming reactor and is continuously stirred for 20 min, as it was considered for this study. This leads to the conversion of nonhydratable phospholipids (NHP) into phospholipids (PL) (Eq. (1)): (1) 1 Citric acid +6 NHP → 6.2 PL The stream is further processed with washing and centrifugation (Fig. 1). During the washing process, water is added to the degummed oil, and the mixed stream proceed to the agitated hydration tank, where the gums are agglomerated, and separated from the oil. During the centrifugation, the light phase, i.e., oil, is separated, cooled down and delivered to the hydrogenation process. 2.1.2.4 Hydrogenation and propane clave Pennycress oil contains C14 to C24 fatty acids, which can be processed into shorter and more useful hydrocarbons, and can be used as fuels, including propane (C3), LPG (C3–C4), naphtha (C5–C7), HRJ (C8–C16), and green diesel (C17–C22) [54]. Depropanation (Eq. (2)) and hydrogenation reactions (Eqs. (3)–(5)) are conducted in hydrogenation reactor. During the depropanation reaction, hydrogen is added to the unsaturated fatty acids at the presence of catalyst, and saturated fatty acids are produced [54]. Then propane is cleaved, and 3 mol of free fatty acids are produced (Eq. (2)). Three reactions then occur simultaneously in the hydrogenation step. This study considered hydrodeoxygenation (Eq. (3)) by 5%, decarboxylation (Eq. (4)) by 90%, and decarbonylation (Eq. (5)) by 5%, as suggested elsewhere [55]. During these reactions paraffin chains are produced, and oxygen is removed from the fatty acid molecules in the forms of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide in hydrodeoxygenation (Eq. (3)), decarboxylation (Eq. (4)), and decarbonylation (Eq. (5)) reactions, respectively [56]. (2) C n H ( 2 n − 6 m − 1 ) ( C O O H ) 3 + 3 H 2 → 3 C n H 2 n + 1 C O O H + C 3 H 8 (3) C n H 2 n + 1 C O O H + ( m + 3 ) H 2 → C n + 1 H 2 n + 4 + 2 H 2 O (4) C n H 2 n + 1 C O O H + m H 2 → C n H 2 n + 2 + C O 2 (5) C n H ( 2 n + 1 − 2 m ) C O O H + ( m + 1 ) H 2 → C n H 2 n + 2 + C O + H 2 O where n and m denote the number of C and H in the hydrocarbons and they are varying from 1 to 24 based on the fatty acid profile of pennycress oil (Table S1). The operating temperature and pressure in hydrogenation reactor were considered as 300 °C and 3 MPa, respectively, as suggested in the literature [30]. Platinum on Aluminum (Pt/Al2O3) was considered as the catalyst for hydrogenation of pennycress oil at 5% (mass ratio), as suggested in the literature [30]. The lifetime of catalyst depends on several factors, such as presence of solvent. In this study the lifetime of catalyst was considered to be one year, as suggested in the literature [57]. After hydrogenation, dissolved CO2 and CO, as well as most water, propane and hydrogen are separated from the main flow through a flash mechanism. The separated flow is further divided into propane and light gases through condensation and distillation mechanisms (Fig. 1). The product of hydrogenation is then sent to the hydrocracking process. 2.1.2.5 Hydrocracking The process flow, after hydrogenation and breaking the alkanes to hydrocarbons in the range of C15 to C22, was considered to be treated with selective hydrocracking and isomerization, in which the long hydrocarbons are broken down to shorter ones in the range of HRJ (C8–C16), such that the low freeze point HRJ is produced and the product after this step meets the requirement of the HRJ cloud point [30,56]. The operating temperature and pressure during the hydrocracking reaction were considered as 355 °C and 4 MPa, respectively, as suggested in the literature [30]. The flow is proceeded for the separation of the main product, as well as the byproducts [58]. 2.1.2.6 Separation The separation of flow into the main product, i.e., HRJ, and byproducts, i.e., light gases, LPG, naphtha, and green diesel, was considered to be conducted in three distillation columns (Fig. 1). In the first column, light flow containing the mix of light gases, LPG and hydrogen was considered to be separated. The light flow was considered to be further separated into different components using a condensation mechanism. In the second distillation column, the light flow mostly containing naphtha and water was considered to be separated and further divided into naphtha and the remaining as wastewater, using a condensation mechanism. In the third distillation column, light flow of HRJ was considered to be separated, and the heavy flow, containing heavy hydrocarbons and catalyst, was considered to proceed to the centrifuge for catalyst recovery, and green diesel separation [30]. 2.1.2.7 Wastewater treatment At the HRJ biorefinery, wastewater from oil purification, propane clave, as well as from separation of HRJ and green diesel is mixed and sent to the WWT section (Fig. 1). The purpose of using WWT is to manage wastewater for proper disposal. We considered use of anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce effluent which is rich in nutrients and suitable for land application, as well as biogas which is rich in methane [59], and was considered to be fed to the cogeneration unit for steam and electricity generation (Fig. 1). 2.1.2.8 Pennycress meal processing Pennycress meal contains ~31% crude protein, which is comparable to that of canola meal (~36%); however, it contains a higher level of erucic acid (1.6–1.7%). It also contains a higher level of glucosinolates (18.2–21.7 μmol/g) [41] compared to the other oilseed meals typically used as protein source for animal feed [60]. Due to high levels of glycosinolates and erucic acid on pennycress meal, recent studies have suggested that pennycress meal cannot be used as animal feed [41,42]; thus, alternative applications have been suggested. Pennycress meal contains sinigrin, which makes it a valuable biofumigant for effective weed control [61,62]. Incorporation of pennycress meal in the soil has also been suggested to provide suppression of weed seeds [63,64], in addition to its value as an organic fertilizer by adding nutrients to the agricultural land [61]. Pennycress meal can also be used as a bio-based filler to be incorporated into plastic composites and fiber [60]. Regardless of high quantities of fiber, glucosinolates, and erucic acid in pennycress meal, some studies have reported a limited nutritive value of pennycress meal for poultry production [65]. In addition, recent studies have confirmed its use as a protein source for the broiler starter diets at up to 8.5% [42]. However, at the current state of technology, none of these applications have been approved at the commercial scale. Thus, this study considered direct combustion of pennycress meal as boiler fuel for energy (steam and electricity) generation as the primary application. In addition, the impact of alternative application of pennycress meal as a high value product for animal feed was evaluated. 2.1.2.9 Use of pennycress meal and biogas for steam and electricity generation Pennycress meal and biogas from AD were considered to be burnt in a boiler to generate steam. Part of steam, in high-pressure form, was considered to be used as utility needed for the plant, and the remaining to be converted to electricity, which was partially reused in the process. The excess electricity was also considered to be sold to the grid. Boiler and turbine-generator efficiencies were considered to be 80 and 85%, respectively, as suggested in the literature [59]. 2.1.2.10 Alternative use of pennycress meal as animal feed After oil extraction, residual solvent in meal is removed in a desolventizer, and it is recycled in the process. In this step, the solvent is distilled from the meal by heating it in a sealed chamber on a series of plates heated by steam. During this process, the meal enters the chamber at 60 °C, and it is heated to 95-115 °C using steam. The moisture is also increased to 12–18%. This process takes place over 50–90 min, with an average 70 min considered in this study. Then, pennycress meal is cooled down and dried until 12% moisture content, and is granulated using a hammer mill [51]. 2.1.3 Economic analysis The analysis was conducted in 2019. Biorefinery construction period and startup period were assumed to be 18 and 6 months, respectively (Table S5). Purchase prices of equipment were estimated based on their required size using an exponential scaling procedure as suggested in the literature [59]. Adjustments were made to determine the equipment purchase price based on the scale of process and the year of analysis. The parameters and assumptions for estimation of the total investment for establishing the pennycress oil extraction and conversion facilities were obtained from the process model developed with SuperPro Designer software, as presented in Table S6. The cost of equipment installation was estimated using associated factors taken from the literature [44,59], and consequently the capital costs of the biorefinery establishment was estimated. Annual operating cost was estimated by including the costs associated with materials, labor, utilities, laboratory and quality control, as well as facility-dependent cost. Facility-dependent cost accounts for the costs associated with the equipment maintenance, depreciation, insurance, taxes as well as other overhead costs [44]. Labor hours were estimated based on the labor needs by different operations or sections in the process. Labor basic rate was considered as 20 USD/h [63], and labor cost was estimated using the following eq. [44]: (6) Labor cost = Basic rate × (1+Benefits+Supplies+Supervision+Administration) × Labor use where the benefits, supplies, supervision, and administration factors were assumed as 0.40, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.60, respectively [44]. Prices of materials used, utility required, as well as the main product and byproducts of the process are presented in Table 2 . The required process electricity and steam were generated by using pennycress meal and biogas as boiler fuel and conversion to electricity and steam. Excess electricity was considered to be supplied to the grid. In addition, the byproduct credits associated with propane, LPG, naphtha, green diesel, and electricity were estimated by considering their market prices (Table 2). Capital and operating costs data obtained from the TEA model were used to determine the MSP of HRJ at the biorefinery gate, considering total credit and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 10% (Table S5) [59,66]. Financial analysis was conducted by estimating return on investment (ROI) and net present value (NPV) of establishing the HRJ biorefinery, as well as the MSP of HRJ production [59]. 2.1.3.1 Sensitivity analysis There are different sources of variation in model inputs. For example, the oil content of pennycress varies within the range 25–36% [38,39]. The uncertainty associated with the MSP of HRJ was assessed using sensitivity analysis, which helps determine differences in the model output parameters due to the variations in the individual inputs. The biorefinery size, pennycress grain price, fixed capital investment, oil content, and pennycress meal price were used for the sensitivity analysis, by considering the 5th and 95th percentiles of their distributions, which were obtained either from the process modeling or related literature. Pennycress grain price was considered based on the previous study [32], which was reported in the range of 0.17–0.23 USD/kg based on lower and upper limits of 90% central range, with an average of 0.20 USD/kg. In addition to the sensitivity analysis, changes in the process technology to produce higher value byproducts are also expected to cause significant impacts on the overall competitiveness of HRJ. So, the impact of alternative use of pennycress meal as protein source for animal feed on the overall economics of pennycress-based HRJ was also assessed. Thus, the study considered partial use of pennycress meal as boiler fuel and on-site energy generation to fulfill the steam and electricity requirements for the plant, and the remaining pennycress meal to pass through drying and grinding processes and be used as a protein source for animal feeding (Fig. 1). The selling price of pennycress meal as a protein source for animal feed was assumed to be 0.15 USD/kg, which was obtained by considering the meal prices of similar oilseeds which can be used as protein source [16]."
3,Results and discussion,
4,Mass balance and utilities requirements of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel biorefinery,"3.1 Mass balance and utilities requirements of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel biorefinery For the selected HRJ biorefinery capacity, ~13,310 kg/h pennycress grain would be required to produce ~2390 L/h HRJ, at an annual operating time of 7920 h (Fig. 2 ). After oil extraction from pennycress grain, ~10,380 kg/h pennycress meal would be produced. In addition, 181 kg/h LPG, 96 kg/h naphtha, and 1656 L/h green diesel would be produced after separation of the byproducts through the hydroprocessing technology. The process would also generate wastewater which was considered to be treated through AD to produce 1.40 kg/h biogas. Pennycress meal and biogas were considered to be used as boiler fuel to produce steam and electricity. Through this process, ~1% (1,748 kg/h) of the steam generated in the boiler would meet steam requirement for different processes of HRJ biorefinery at the selected capacity. The remaining steam was considered to be converted to electricity through turbine-generator to generate ~26 MW electricity (Fig. 2). The mass-based conversion rate of pennycress oil-to-HRJ was estimated to be 0.45, and would be affected by the efficiency of hydrogenation, hydrocracking and separation processes. The estimated pennycress oil-to-HRJ conversion rate is comparable to that of HRJ production from camelina oil (0.5) [17]. By considering the total productions of HRJ and byproducts, including green diesel, naphtha, and LPG, the overall mass-based conversion rate of pennycress oil-to-products was estimated to be 0.81. In addition, the mass-based conversion rate of pennycress grain (at 8% moisture content)-to-HRJ was estimated to be 0.13, which is in the range of that of biomass-to-fuel conversion rate (0.126–0.135) reported in the literature [67]. This conversion rate would be affected by different parameters, including oil content of pennycress grain, oil extraction rate for the combined mechanical press and solvent extraction, and the oil-to-HRJ conversion rate. The main utilities required for the process were estimated to be electricity, steam, process water, and cooling water (Fig. 2). Estimated onsite steam and electricity generations were sufficient to fully meet their biorefinery demands. The remaining steam was considered to be used to generate electricity through a turbine-generator. For the selected biorefinery capacity, a total of ~26 MW electricity was estimated to be generated through use of pennycress meal and biogas as boiler fuels. The HRJ biorefinery processes would use ~1.8 MW electricity, leaving about ~24.2 MW to be sold to the grid. Electricity would be mainly needed for equipment in feedstock handling and conditioning (mainly dryers) as well as hydrogenation and solvent extraction processes."
5,Capital cost,"3.2 Capital cost Total investment for establishing the HRJ biorefinery of the selected capacity was estimated to be ~90.8 million USD (Fig. 3 ). The contributions of total plant direct and indirect costs to the total investment were estimated to be 50 and 30%, respectively. Construction, equipment purchase, installation and building were estimated to be the main contributors to total plant direct cost by around 28, 21 and 12%, respectively. High contribution of equipment purchase was mainly due to several equipment needed for the overall process of oil extraction, conversion, WWT and energy generation. In addition, equipment needed for energy generation, hydrogenation, and separation processes were the main contributors to the total equipment purchase cost. The most expensive pieces of equipment were found to be boiler and turbine-generator, mainly due to their high capacities for conversion of high rate of pennycress meal (~10,380 kg/h) to energy (~26 MW electricity) at the selected biorefinery capacity. In addition, several processes were considered for hydrogenation of pennycress oil and propane clave, which would lead to high purchase cost of this section. High contribution of separation section to equipment purchase cost was mainly due to equipment needed for three steps of distillation to separate HRJ, different byproducts and emissions. The results are in line with those of previous studies on HRJ production from vegetable oils [15,25,30]. Indirect cost would be mainly contributed to biorefinery construction. In addition, working capital (2.8 million USD) and startup cost (4.2 million USD) were estimated to contribute to ~8% of the total investment (Fig. 3)."
6,Operating cost and minimum selling price,"3.3 Operating cost and minimum selling price The contributions of grain conditioning, hydrogenation, oil extraction and separation processes on annual utility cost (1.4 million USD) were estimated to be 36, 32, 18 and 14%, respectively (Fig. 4 -a). High utility cost of grain conditioning was mainly due to higher amount of energy used for drying of pennycress grain. In addition, solvent used for oil extraction as well as hydrogen and catalyst used for hydrogenation of pennycress oil were estimated to be the main contributors to utility cost of these processes. The utilities cost for other sections were estimated to be minimal (Fig. 4-a). The main contributors to annual labor cost of biorefinery (6.3 million USD) were oil extraction, separation and hydrogenation processed by 29, 24, 15%, respectively. In oil extraction section, labor was mainly needed for solvent extraction and oil purification processes. The high contribution of separation section to labor cost was due to high labor requirement for multiple separation steps needed for different products, including LPG, naphtha, green diesel and HRJ. Operator need for each of the distillation units was considered to be 0.5 labor-h/h. Pennycress grain supply and conditioning were estimated to contribute to ~46% of annual operating cost (i.e., ~47 million USD) of the HRJ biorefinery at the selected capacity (Fig. 4-c). Facility-dependent cost of boiler and turbine-generator equipment was the main reason for the high contribution (~20%) of energy generation process on the annual operating cost. High purchase prices of boiler and turbine-generator, mainly due to their high capacities, were the main reason for the high contributions of these facility-dependent costs. In hydrogenation process, costs of raw materials, i.e., hydrogen and catalyst, and utilities were found to be the main drivers. Total operating cost of HRJ production was estimated to be ~2.5 USD/L (Fig. 5 ). Raw materials contributed to around half of operating cost. The other main contributors were facility-dependent cost (~34%), and labor cost (~14%). Among raw materials, pennycress grain had the highest contribution (~45%) to the total operating cost of HRJ production. The main reason for the high contribution of pennycress grain was the high amount of feedstock required for conversion to HRJ at the selected biorefinery capacity. In previous studies, feedstock supply was reported as the main contributor to the operating cost of similar products, including HRJ from camelina [30] and hydrogenated renewable diesel from canola [57]. Reduction of feedstock supply cost would significantly improve the economics of HRJ. Pennycress grain price was considered based on a previous work [32] on techno-economics of pennycress supply in Ohio, in which pennycress yield and oil content of grain highly affected the pennycress grain price. In addition, increasing oil content of pennycress grain could reduce pennycress grain requirement for the selected biorefinery, and consequently feedstock supply cost. Other consumables, including citric acid, hydrogen, solvent, and catalyst, contributed to ~13.5% of total operating cost. In a previous study the operating cost of HRJ production from camelina oil was reported as 0.4–1.7 USD/L, depending on the variations in biorefinery size and feedstock supply price [30]. Slightly higher operating cost in this study was due to expanding the system boundary to cover the oil extraction from pennycress grain and conversion to HRJ. In addition, the size of biorefinery considered in the previous study was bigger than that of our study. For this design, a total of ~24.8 MW electricity was estimated to be supplied to the grid. No credit was assigned for the generated steam at the biorefinery, as it was considered to be reused for the processes. Total byproducts credit was estimated to be 1.3 USD/L HRJ (Fig. 5). The main contributors to total credit were electrical power (0.7 USD/L HRJ) and green diesel (0.5 USD/L HRJ). The net HRJ production cost was estimated to be 1.1 USD/L. By considering a 10% IRR [59], the MSP of HRJ at the biorefinery gate was estimated to be 1.2 USD/L, which is in the range of MSP of HRJ from similar biobased feedstocks. In a previous study, MSP of HRJ from vegetable oils through the hydroprocessing technology was reported as 1.1–1.3 USD/L (in 2019 USD) for the HRJ biorefinery size of 116–378 MLPY [12,17]. However, the MSP of pennycress-based HRJ, at the biorefinery gate was estimated to be more than 2 times of the 5-year average price of the commercial jet fuel (Jet A) for the end-users, i.e., 0.5 USD/L, which is in line with the results of previous studies on techno-economics of HRJ production from similar biobased feedstocks [3,12,15,68]. The HRJ biorefineries typically generate additional credit from selling byproducts, including LPG, naphtha and green diesel. Thus, any upgrading in the byproducts’ values could increase the selling prices and further reduce the MSP of HRJ. Thus, evaluating the impacts of variabilities in the prices of byproducts can help identify the key parameters affecting the economics of HRJ."
7,Sensitivity analysis,"3.4 Sensitivity analysis MSP of HRJ was found to be the most sensitive to the pennycress grain price, which is in line with the results of previous study [57]. When pennycress grain price was considered to be 0.17 USD/kg, i.e., the lower limit of its 90% central range [32], the MSP of HRJ could decrease to 1.07 USD/L (Fig. 6 ). The other most influencing parameter was found to be fixed capital investment. Biorefinery size, and pennycress oil content could also inversely affect the MSP of HRJ. Increasing the biorefinery size could reduce the cost of production mainly because of the economy of scale, and consequently the MSP of HRJ. At a certain biorefinery size, increasing the pennycress oil content would reduce the pennycress grain requirement. It would also reduce the capital and operating costs, and consequently reduce the MSP of HRJ. These results are consistent with those of technical feasibility and costs of camelina-based HRJ production at the commercial scale [17]."
8,Potential improvements in economics of pennycress-based jet fuel,"3.5 Potential improvements in economics of pennycress-based jet fuel Effects of variations in pennycress grain price (at three levels, including low: 0.17 USD/kg, average: 0.20 USD/kg and high 0.23 USD/kg, as presented in the previous study [32]), biorefinery size (1–400 MLPY, as suggested in the literature [43,48,69]), and alternative application of pennycress meal (as energy source and animal feed, as suggested in the literature [42,60]), on the competitiveness of HRJ were evaluated and the results are presented in Figs. 7–9 . Although the pennycress grain price was considered to be lower than that of similar oilseeds [32], the byproducts credit associated with electrical power was estimated to be less than the byproduct credit associated with meal of similar oilseeds which is typically used for animal feed. Total capital cost of HRJ production increased by increasing the biorefinery size (Fig. 7). When pennycress meal was considered as a source of energy or animal feed, the scaling factors were estimated to be 0.76 and 0.60, respectively, which were in the range of scaling factors for the processing industries, i.e., 0.4–0.8 [70]. However, when pennycress meal was considered to be used as energy source, the scaling factor was estimated to be higher than those of the common chemical processing industries [27]. The scaling factor of 0.76 indicates that doubling the biorefinery size would increase the capital cost by 76%. Higher scaling factor of the HRJ biorefinery, with pennycress meal use as energy source, is interpreted by the higher prices of boiler and turbine-generator, compared to those of the meal processing equipment. NPV of establishing the HRJ biorefinery showed the most increasing trends at low feedstock supply price (i.e., 0.17 USD/kg), for both applications of pennycress meal as energy source and animal feed. Similarly, it showed the most decreasing trends when pennycress grain was considered to be supplied at high price (i.e., 0.23 USD/kg), regardless of different applications of pennycress meal (Fig. 8-a). The results indicated that NPV of establishing the HRJ biorefinery is mostly affected by feedstock supply price, rather than alternative applications of pennycress meal. When feedstock was considered to be supplied at the low price (0.17 USD/kg) and pennycress meal was considered to be used for animal feed at the price of 0.15 USD/kg, the HRJ biorefinery was estimated to generate positive NPV at sizes greater than ~80 MLPY, while the minimum size to generate positive NPV at low feedstock price and use of pennycress meal as energy source was estimated to be ~120 MLPY (Fig. 8-a). Similar trends of NPV with biorefinery size and feedstock price were observed in a previous study on techno-economic evaluation of HRJ production from camelina [30]. Upgrading pennycress meal to high-value product, e.g., protein source for animal feed, would increase the byproduct credit due to higher selling price of pennycress meal, which would reduce the net production cost and increase the NPV of pennycress-based HRJ production. ROI of establishing the HRJ biorefinery was increased by increasing the biorefinery size (Fig. 8-b). The highest ROI could be obtained when pennycress grain was considered to be supplied at low price, and pennycress meal was considered to be used as animal feed. Conversely, when pennycress meal was considered to be used as animal feed and pennycress grain be supplied at the high price, the minimum ROI was estimated. Overall, it was estimated that the impact of feedstock price could be higher than alternative application of pennycress meal on achieving a higher ROI. MSP of HRJ was estimated to be highly affected by pennycress feedstock price, followed by pennycress meal use, and biorefinery size (Fig. 9). It was estimated to decrease by increasing the biorefinery size in both alternative uses of pennycress meal, i.e., boiler fuel or animal feed, and all ranges of feedstock price, especially when the biorefinery size was less than ~40 MLPY; however, the MSP curves became relatively flat at the biorefinery sizes greater than ~100 MLPY (Fig. 9). This flatness was mainly due to lower impact of economy of scale at higher production capacities. These findings are in line with those of previous study on techno-economics of commercial production of hydroprocessed renewable diesel from camelina and canola feedstocks [57]. In addition, when pennycress meal was considered as animal feed and feedstock was considered to be supplied at low price, the minimum MSP of HRJ could be achieved. MSP of HRJ at the biorefinery gate would be competitive with jet A fuel price when the biorefinery size be greater than ~57 MLPY and pennycress meal be used as animal feed with a selling price of 0.15 USD/kg, and pennycress grain price be considered at the low level (0.17 USD/kg). When pennycress meal was considered to be used as animal feed at average feedstock price and pennycress meal was considered as energy source at low feedstock price, the minimum biorefinery size to reach a competitive MSP of HRJ would be ~100 MLPY. Li et al. [30] analyzed the variation of MSP of camelina-based HRJ over variations in biorefinery size, camelina oil price, and byproduct credit. They reported that at 225 MLPY biorefinery size, when feedstock was supplied as lowest price and the byproduct credit was the highest, the MSP of HRJ dropped to 0.43 USD/L, or even to 0.40 USD/L when the biorefinery size increased to 675 MLPY. Overall, the results highlighted the main parameters affecting the techno-economics of HRJ production from pennycress. NPV of HRJ biorefinery at the selected capacity was negative for both alternative applications of pennycress meal as energy source and animal feed. Feedstock price was the main parameter affecting the economics of HRJ. Alternative use of pennycress meal as animal feed rather than energy source would improve the economics of HRJ. In addition, maximizing the biorefinery size showed a better economic performance, due to the economy of scale. To generate a positive NPV, the feedstock needs to be supplied at low price (0.17 USD/kg) and the biorefinery size be greater than ~120 MLPY, when pennycress meal is used as energy source. However, use of pennycress meal as animal feed would increase the NPV, due to increasing the byproduct credit. Thus, for this scenario, the minimum biorefinery size for observing positive NPV was estimated to be ~80 MLPY. Research efforts are needed to identify possible options for commercial uses of pennycress meal, and the market development would be required for pennycress meal as a high-value product. In addition, for increasing the biorefinery size, the risks associated with feedstock supply and consistency in terms of both the quality and quantity at the commercial scale need to be taken into account. Developing integrated biorefineries to feed with similar types of feedstock would be an alternative strategy to maximize the HRJ biorefinery size in the region and consequently make HRJ economically more competitive. In addition, exergoeconomic evaluation of biorefinery would help establish resource-efficient and cost-effective pennycress-based HRJ biorefineries in the region [71]."
9,Practical implications,"3.6 Practical implications There is a growing interest in making the aviation sector more environmentally sustainable by implementing aviation biofuels from renewable resources. To help accomplish this, the feedstock types and production technologies are developing rapidly. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the technical feasibility and costs of producing HRJ from pennycress, a new jet fuel feedstock with several advantages [32]. Feedstock price, capital investment for establishing the oil extraction and conversion facilities, biorefinery size, oil content of pennycress grain, as well as alternative use of pennycress meal as high-value product were identified as the main parameters affecting the economics of pennycress-based HRJ; and the potential improvements were critically analyzed. The findings can help researchers in this area to focus on improving the key parameters for sustainable development of locally appropriate feedstocks and conversion technologies for commercial HRJ production. This study can also help identify the local opportunities, potential resources and competitive advantages associated with establishment of pennycress-based HRJ biorefineries. In addition, it can help policy makers in developing the sustainability criteria, establishing minimum aviation biofuel standards, as well as developing the supportive plans for sustainable development of aviation biofuel industry."
10,Conclusions and prospects,"The estimated minimum selling price of HRJ (1.2 USD/L) was similar to that of HRJ from similar oilseeds, and it could be further reduced by decreasing the price of pennycress grain at the biorefinery, increasing the pennycress oil content, increasing the production capacity as well as upgrading pennycress meal to higher value products. Increasing pennycress grain yield would reduce the cost of pennycress production through increasing the grain harvest per unit area. Further work needs to focus on identifying the best locations for the HRJ biorefinery to minimize the transportation distance and costs, and consequently the feedstock supply price at the biorefinery. In addition, evaluating the social, environmental, and exergoeconomic performances would help sustainable establishment of pennycress-based HRJ biorefineries in the region. Genetic modification of pennycress seeds can also be considered as an effective strategy to increase the oil yield per unit harvest area, and consequently to minimize the cost of feedstock supply. In addition, future research studies need to focus on identifying the potential applications of pennycress meal as higher-value products, such as protein source for animal feed, to help improve the economics of HRJ through increasing the byproduct credit. In addition, governmental subsidy would support economic viability of HRJ production from pennycress. This work is useful for establishing the performance targets needed to improve the techno-economics of HRJ production from pennycress. The outcomes of this research would help the researchers, farmers, investors, and policy makers towards establishing the commercial production of HRJ from pennycress in the region."
