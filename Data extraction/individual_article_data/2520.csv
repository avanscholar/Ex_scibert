0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is often recognized as an ideal energy carrier for the future, due to its high energy content per unit (2.75-fold greater than hydrocarbon fuels), and clean combustion that does not generate greenhouse gases. However, the technologies involved in hydrogen production still rely on very energy-intensive processes that are not sustainable. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for efficient approaches to produce H2 in a renewable, sustainable and environmentally friendly way. Biological hydrogen (BioH2) production is a very interesting alternative as it requires low energy input and is sustainable if using wastes or renewable substrates [1,2]. In particular, dark-fermentation processes appear as a promising option due to their high H2 production rates, low energy requirements, simple bioreactor design and versatility in terms of the possible organic substrates [3,4]. The main drawback of fermentative processes is the low hydrogen yield per mole of organic substrate consumed, due to the co-production of other fermentation products such as carboxylic acids and alcohols [5]. However, additional energy can be derived from these fermentation products by the use of two-stage systems [3,6], where a second process allows further production of H2 by a photo-fermentation or a microbial electrolysis process, or in alternative, the production of methane by an anaerobic digestion process. This last option mimics the natural events in anoxic environments, where primary fermenters produce H2, formate and short-chain fatty acids that are then used by terminal oxidizing organisms such as methanogens, acetogens and sulfate reducers [7,8]. In environments rich in sulfate, the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) outcompete the methanogens and homoacetogens, due to a higher affinity and lower threshold value for hydrogen, and for this reason SRB are generally viewed as H2-consuming organisms. However, SRB are metabolically very versatile and are also present in sulfate-limited environments, where they grow fermentatively by producing H2, CO2 and acetate in syntrophy with other organisms [9]. The possible intermediary production of H2 during sulfate reduction, as proposed by Odom & Peck [10], would also suggest that in the absence of sulfate SRB could function as H2 producers. SRB are a major group of environmental anaerobic bacteria that play a key role in the global cycles of carbon and sulfur, and which have important biotechnological applications in waste water treatment and bioremediation [11–15]. They also have the ability to use simple organic compounds such as lactate, ethanol, formate and butyrate, usually produced in the fermentation processes. These organisms are characterized by a very high level of hydrogenases, the enzymes responsible for production/consumption of H2, with multiple copies usually being present in the genome [16]. Although hydrogenases from SRB have been extensively studied [17–19], very few studies have yet addressed the potential of these organisms for H2 production, apart from two reports that described H2 production from lactate [20,21]. Recent investigations have focused on using these bacteria as biocathodes in microbial electrolysis cells (MEC) [22–25]. In these reports, the electrocatalytic H2 production activity of SRB was either higher [22], or similar [24], to their H2 oxidation activity, confirming a high potential for H2 production. In the present study we explored for the first time the possibility of using SRB in a second stage system for hydrogen production from sub-products of dark-fermentation, with the model strain Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. D. vulgaris was chosen as the model organism since its genome is sequenced and revealed a high number of hydrogenases (seven), and several studies have characterized its H2 metabolism as well as the role of its hydrogenases and their regulation [20,21,26–32]. We investigated the impact of several factors on H2 production by D. vulgaris, in order to determine the optimal conditions for the highest production. Subsequently, these conditions were used to study H2 production in an ASTR. Our results demonstrate a very interesting H2 production capacity by D. vulgaris that warrants further studies into exploring SRB for this new biotechnological application."
1,Material and methods,
2,Microorganism and growth conditions,"2.1 Microorganism and growth conditions D. vulgaris Hildenborough (DSM 644) was grown in modified Postgate medium C containing 0.5 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L NH4Cl, 2.5 g/L Na2SO4, 0.06 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 0.06 MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L yeast extract, 0.0071 g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 0.3 g/L sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, 0.1 g/L ascorbic acid, 0.1 g/L sodium thioglycolate, 4.5 g/L sodium lactate and 0.3 mg/L resazurin. A 10% (v/v) inoculum was used in all experiments. Batch experiments were carried out at 37 °C using 120 mL serum bottles with a working volume of 50 mL and N2 as gas headspace. The bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals."
3,H2 production from several substrates,"2.2 H2 production from several substrates The studies of BioH2 production were performed using the medium described above, but with a limiting sulfate concentration (4 mM). The potential of three electrons donors (sodium lactate, sodium formate and ethanol) for BioH2 production was evaluated using 40 mM of each. When formate was used as substrate the medium was also supplemented with sodium acetate (10 mM) and MOPS buffer (100 mM). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.2 ± 0.1. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and the most efficient electron donor was used for further studies."
4,Optimization of hydrogen production in batch conditions and ASTR,"2.3 Optimization of hydrogen production in batch conditions and ASTR The effect of several parameters (metal cofactors, pH, cell load and substrate concentration) on hydrogen production by D. vulgaris was evaluated in order to find the optimal conditions for H2 production. The effect of metal cofactors of hydrogenases (Fe, Ni and Se) on H2 production was evaluated by supplementing the medium with 1 μM nickel chloride or 1 μM of both nickel chloride and sodium selenide. The effect of initial pH was investigated in range of 6.6–8.2 in MOPS buffer. Hydrogen production efficiencies at different formate concentrations (10–100 mM) and initial cell loads (27–352 mgdcw L−1) were also studied. The optimal conditions were then used for H2 production in an ASTR with a total volume capacity of 3 L. The bioreactor was operated in batch mode at 37 °C, with a working volume of 1.5 L, and a stirring rate of 50 rpm. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Cell growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm (OD600) with a Shimadzu UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Biomass was determined by measuring the dry cell weight (dcw) and correlated with OD600 values. One unit value of OD600 corresponded to 0.31 gdcw L−1. Sulfate was quantified by UV/Vis spectrophotometry at 450 nm using the method of SulfaVer®4 (Hach-Lange). The concentration of substrates was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters system (Waters Chromatography, Milford, MA) and a LKB 2142 Differential Refractometer detector (Bromma, Sweden). Chromatographic separation was undertaken using an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm), 9 μm particle size (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) at 45 °C. Elution was carried out isocratically with 0.005 N of H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1. All liquid samples were filtered (0.22 μM) before analysis. The H2 content in the headspace of the serum bottles was determined using a Trace GC 2000 gas chromatograph (Thermo Corporation) equipped with a MolSieve 5A 80/100 column (Althech) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 mL min− 1."
6,Gel stained for hydrogenase activity,"2.5 Gel stained for hydrogenase activity The identification of the hydrogenases involved in hydrogen production was performed with a native gel stained for hydrogenase activity, using crude cell extracts as described by Valente and co-workers [26]. Briefly, crude cell extracts were obtained by cell disruption using the BugBuster Plus Lysonase™ Kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of crude cell extracts were run in a 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The gel was incubated in a solution of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 0.5 mM metlyl viologen under a H2 atmosphere and after the development, the bands were fixed with 10 mM 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution."
7,Results and discussion,
8,H2 production from several substrates,"3.1 H2 production from several substrates In order to investigate the possibility of using SRB in the second step of a dark fermentation process, hydrogen production from lactate, ethanol and formate, typical SRB substrates and also sub-products of fermentation processes, was evaluated. Bacterial growth and H2 production from the three substrates are shown in Fig. 1 . A limiting amount of sulfate was added in the beginning of the process, as it was observed that in its absence the production of H2 was erratic. This effect is due to the production of sulfide, which lowers the redox potential of the medium, as the initial addition of sulfide had a similar effect to sulfate. Complete reduction of the limiting sulfate was observed in the first 24 h of incubation with lactate and ethanol, and in the first 16 h with formate. During sulfate reduction a rise of cell mass was observed, achieving a maximum OD600 of 0.32, 0.23 and 0.22 with lactate, ethanol and formate, respectively. Hydrogen production from all substrates started after sulfate depletion. Although lactate and ethanol are thermodynamically more favorable substrates than formate in the working conditions (Table 1 ), the highest H2 production was observed from the latter substrate. A very high 320 mL L−1 medium of H2 were produced from formate, while only 21 and 5 mL L−1 medium were produced from lactate and ethanol, respectively. These results can be explained by the different metabolic pathways involved in the production of hydrogen from the different substrates. The production of H2 from lactate and ethanol proceeds via pyruvate and acetaldehyde, respectively [33]: (1) lactate - → pyruvate - + H 2 Δ G o ′ = + 43 kJ / mol (2) pyruvate - + 2 H 2 O → acetate - + HCO 3 - + H + + H 2 Δ G o ′ = - 47 kJ/mol (3) ethanol → acetaldehyde + H 2 Δ G o ′ = + 42 kJ / mol (4) acetaldehyde + H 2 O → acetate - + H + + H 2 Δ G o ′ = - 32 kJ / mol These two metabolic pathways comprise two highly endergonic steps: the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate (E o′ = −190 mV) and that of ethanol to acetaldehyde (E o′ = −200 mV), with protons as electron acceptors (E o′ = −420 mV). In fact, Pankhania and coworkers demonstrated that H2 production from lactate oxidation is an energy driven step [34]. Thus, the oxidation of lactate and ethanol requires the initial input of energy, possibly by reverse electron transfer. In H2 production from formate, the reaction involved is thermodynamically favorable in the working conditions (Table 1), explaining the high production. In the case of lactate as electron donor, the pyruvate produced may also be converted to formate by a pyruvate-formate lyase, which is present in D. vulgaris. Recently, we showed that two D. vulgaris mutants containing deletions of the main formate dehydrogenases had impaired growth on lactate/sulfate, revealing that formate is indeed involved in the process [35]. Thus, the conversion of lactate to formate and of this to hydrogen, may help to explain why H2 production is higher with lactate than ethanol. The production of H2 was not coupled to bacterial growth, independently of the substrate. This is in accordance with previous reports, which demonstrated that growth of Desulfovibrio spp. coupled to H2 production is only observed in syntrophic association with H2 consuming organisms, such as methanogens, which keep the H2 partial pressure low [28,36]. However, in terms of hydrogen production the use of non-growing cells has the advantage that the substrate can be converted to H2 with 100% efficiency, since there is no consumption for cell growth. Thus, in subsequent experiments, formate was used as the substrate for H2 production. Formic acid has emerged recently as an environmentally friendly H2 storage compound that can be easily transported, and has relatively low toxicity [37]. Formic acid is also a by-product of dark-fermentation and it can be easily obtained by biomass processing or hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, in the presence of suitable catalysts [37]. Extensive studies have been carried out on the use of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for conversion of formic acid to H2 and CO2 [37–40], but most of these catalysts use precious metals and require high temperatures and pressures. An alternative approach is found in biologic systems, since the production of H2 from formate is known to be catalyzed by several microorganisms [36,41–44]. Formate and H2 have similar redox potentials, but their conversion can be thermodynamically favored by the removal of H2. Growth of D. vulgaris on formate/sulfate leads to increased expression of formate dehydrogenases, relative to growth on lactate/sulfate [45,46], and it is probable that their expression remains high even after sulfate is consumed, facilitating the conversion of formate to H2."
9,Optimization of hydrogen production in batch conditions,"3.2 Optimization of hydrogen production in batch conditions Hydrogenase expression in D. vulgaris has been shown to be regulated by factors such as concentration of H2 [29] and the metals available [26]. Furthermore, biological H2 production is known to be regulated by factors such as pH, temperature and cell load. Thus, these factors were studied in order to establish the optimal conditions for H2 production from formate by D. vulgaris. 3.2.1 pH and metal cofactors In order to investigate the role of pH on hydrogen production, D. vulgaris was incubated in medium with initial pH ranging from 6.6 to 8.2, using MOPS as buffering agent (Fig. 2 a). A significant increase in hydrogen production, from 170 to 350 mL L−1 medium, was observed when the initial pH was raised from 6.6 to 7.0. This production was maintained at pH 7.5, but, a further increase in pH from 7.5 to 8.2 resulted in a decrease in the hydrogen production (40 mL L−1 medium). This range of pHs did not affect growth by sulfate reduction (data not shown), indicating that the effect of pH on H2 production may result from its influence on the hydrogenase activity. To test the influence of the metal cofactors of hydrogenases (Fe, Ni and Se) on H2 production, the medium was supplemented only with Fe, with Fe and Ni or with Fe, Ni and Se, since different hydrogenases are expressed in these three conditions [26]. We observed the addition of Ni to the Fe-containing medium did not improve hydrogen production (Fig. 2b). However, when the medium was supplemented with Ni and Se an increase in H2 production, from 350 mL L−1 medium to 478 mL L−1 medium, was observed. The genome of D. vulgaris encodes for seven hydrogenases, of the [Fe] and [NiFe] (which includes [NiFeSe]) families [16]. The periplasmic [FeFe], [NiFe], and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases are the main enzymes detected in crude cell extracts by native gels stained for H2 uptake activity [26]. Therefore, we investigated the relative expression of these hydrogenases, in the fermentative conditions and in the presence of different metals (Fig. 3 ). For cells grown in the presence of Fe or Fe and Ni, only the [NiFe] hydrogenase was observed, which agrees with the fact that the same H2 production was observed in both conditions, and indicates that enough Ni was present in the unsupplemented Fe-containing medium to induce expression of this enzyme. The inclusion of Se in addition to Fe and Ni improved the H2 production, and led to the appearance of a strong band corresponding to the [NiFeSe] hydrogenase, which became the major hydrogenase detected, as previously reported [26]. The increased H2 production with the presence of Se is in accordance with the very high catalytic activity of the D. vulgaris [NiFeSe] hydrogenase, particularly in H2 production (6900 U mg−1 protein) [27,47]. Besides its high H2 evolution activity, this hydrogenase has an apparent increased tolerance to inactivation by oxygen [27,48,49], which is obviously a favorable property for H2 production in a real process. The following experiments were conducted at an initial pH of 7.2 and in medium containing Fe, Ni and Se. 3.2.2 Cell load The effect of increasing the amount of cells in hydrogen production was also investigated (Fig. 4 ). An increase in the cumulative H2 produced (from 340 to 490 mL L−1 medium) and specific H2 production rate (from 1090 to 1713 mL g−1 dcw d−1) was observed when the initial cell load was increased from 27 to 36 mgdcw L−1. A further increase from 36 to 105 mgdcw L−1 resulted in a decrease of the total hydrogen produced, as well as of the specific hydrogen production rate. On the other hand, above 105 mgdcw L−1 the cumulative H2 production is maintained at 350 mL L−1 medium, whereas the specific H2 production rate decreases as the cell concentration increases. Similar results of lower specific hydrogen production rate at higher cell densities were previously reported in Escherichia coli strains [43,50]. Ineffective substrate transfer caused by an excess of cells may be an explanation for these results. 3.2.3 Formate concentration Optimization of substrate concentration is another important factor in order to achieve an efficient hydrogen production. Therefore, the specific hydrogen production rate and cumulative hydrogen production from different formate concentrations were determined (Fig. 5 ). Both parameters followed sigmoidal kinetics (R 2 > 0.98). The concentration required for half-maximal H2 production and specific H2 production rate was 25 ± 3 mM in both cases, and the maximal H2 production and specific H2 production rate were 590 ± 20 mL L−1 medium and 2270 ± 150 mL g−1 dcw d−1, respectively. The concentration of formate required for half-maximal H2 production activity by D. vulgaris is similar to the value reported for E. coli [50] and superior to the value obtained for Methanococcus maripaludis [42]."
10,Hydrogen production in an anaerobic stirred tank reactor (ASTR),"3.3 Hydrogen production in an anaerobic stirred tank reactor (ASTR) Hydrogen production at the optimal conditions selected in the previous experiments was evaluated in an ASTR operating in batch mode, monitoring growth, sulfate and formate consumption and H2 production (Fig. 6 ). A high production value of 560 mL L−1 medium of H2 was achieved in the reactor, with a maximum volumetric hydrogen production rate of 15 mL L−1 h−1 and specific hydrogen production rate of 177 mL g−1 dcw h−1. The kinetics of formate and sulfate consumption and H2 production are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reactions involved (4 mol formate/mol sulfate and 1 mol formate/mol H2 produced), and revealed 100% of conversion of formate to H2. The specific rate of H2 production from formate by D. vulgaris (7 mmol g−1 h−1) is quite significant and compares favorably with the value reported for an engineered E. coli strain (SH5), which has been reported to produce 5.8 mmol g−1 h−1 of hydrogen from formate by cells immobilized in agar [43]. Phototrophic bacteria are the most usual organisms of choice for second stage systems [6]. The volumetric hydrogen production rate displayed by D. vulgaris (15 mL L−1 h−1) is similar to the values reported by photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodovulum sulfidophilum P5 (19.4 mL L−1 h−1 from acetate) [51] or Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5 (12.7 mL L−1 h−1 from acetate) [52], and much higher than the maximum values obtained by a phototrophic consortium (1 mL L−1 h−1 from malate) [53] or by the combination of anaerobic sludge and Rhodobacter sphaeroides [54]. In terms of specific hydrogen production rate D. vulgaris also displays higher values than those reported for several phototrophic organisms (reviewed in Ref. [55]), with the advantage that no additional energy input is required. Furthermore, the volumetric H2 production rate obtained in the present work (14 mmol L−1 d−1) is higher than the ones reported recently for two SRB species being used as bio-electrodes in MEC (Desulfovibrio paquesii 8 mmol L−1 d−1 and Desulfovibrio caledoniensis 0.13 mmol L−1 d−1) [22,25], while the ASTR used in the present work is a low cost technology compared with MEC."
11,Conclusions,"The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time the potential of a suspension culture of D. vulgaris for hydrogen production. Therefore, D. vulgaris can be a suitable microorganism to be used in second stage systems, for hydrogen production from dark-fermentation effluents containing formate. Additionaly, it can also be used as an efficient biocatalyst for the conversion of formate to hydrogen. The data obtained in this study provide a proof of principle that SRB can be alternative microorganisms for hydrogen production, namely from formate, and warrant further studies into this issue."
