0,Introduction,"Biomass has attracted increasing attention as it is renewable and of great potential to replace petroleum in the near future [1,2]. There are several routes for the conversion of biomass to liquid fuels (bio-oil), including fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction and so on [3–5]. However, bio-oil could not be directly used as transportation fuel due to these undesirable properties: high viscosity, high corrosiveness, high oxygen-content, low heating value, and instability [6]. It is reported that bio-oil contains multiple kinds of compounds, including acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, esters, phenols, and ethers [7]. The complex composition leads to those aforesaid undesirable properties of bio-oil. For example, the presence of acids contributes to the corrosiveness of bio-oil, and the presence of aldehydes and phenols leads to its instability and difficulty for storage. Therefore, those acids, aldehydes, and phenols are always of low effective hydrogen carbon ratio (H/Ceff factor), which should be removed or converted to other stable and useful compounds with high H/Ceff for the improvement of bio-oil property. In previous studies, single model compounds were always chosen for the initial screening of catalysts, and few literatures focused on the simultaneous conversions of different kinds of model compounds [8–12]. It was reported that sulfided CoMo and NiMo catalysts, transition-metal-based catalysts [13–15] and some noble metal catalysts [16,17] were prepared for the conversion of different model compounds to stable compounds. However, the high cost and deactivation of the above catalysts made them unprofitable for the large-scale hydroprocessing of bio-oil. Thus, it is imperative to exploit possible alternatives for those sulfided catalysts or noble metal catalysts for the upgrading of bio-oil and its model compounds at relatively mild conditions. In this work, multiple carbon nano-tubes (CNT) supported non-precious metal catalysts were prepared and investigated for the hydrogenation of model compound mixture (synthetic bio-oil) in aqueous and the aqueous fraction of bio-oil. The research on catalytic conversion of aqueous fraction of bio-oil over non-precious metal catalysts in relatively mild conditions would avoid the application of either noble metal catalysts or sulfided catalysts, which would decrease the catalysts cost and benefit for the industrial production for the conversion of raw bio-oil to transport fuels. Herein acetic acid, furfural and hydroxyacetone (acetol) and guaiacol were chosen to represent the organic acids, aldehydes, ketones and phenols, respectively. According to previous reports [10,18,19], the amount of acetic acid, furfural, acetol, guaiacol and water in the synthetic bio-oil was 10wt.%, 9wt.%, 7wt.%, 8wt.% and 66wt.%, respectively. The catalytic hydroprocessing of synthetic bio-oil and aqueous fraction of bio-oil were carried out for the conversion of the undesirable compounds into stable and combustible alcohols with high H/Ceff."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All of the reagents except CNT were of analytic purity grade, and were purchased from local Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. CNT was purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co., Ltd (purity>97%). Raw bio-oil was obtained by fast pyrolysis of wheat straw at 500°C in a bench-scale fluidized-bed reactor. Then raw bio-oil and water were mixed in certain water/oil ratios and then centrifuged. The aqueous fraction of bio-oil with large volume was selected for further application."
3,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.2 Catalyst preparation and characterization CNT-supported catalysts were prepared in a similar way by impregnation method reported in our previous studies [8,10,11]. All catalysts were loaded in a tubular reactor and reduced under H2 before use. The spectrometer microstructure of the catalyst was examined with TEM (Tecnai G2 20). The NH3-TPD studies were carried out in a quartz tube reactor with a thermal conductivity detector."
4,Catalytic hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil and aqueous fraction of bio-oil,"2.3 Catalytic hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil and aqueous fraction of bio-oil All the aqueous-phase catalytic hydrogenations were carried out in a 100ml stainless autoclave equipped with an electromagnetic driven stirrer. For the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil, 50g synthetic bio-oil and certain amount of catalyst were added to the reactor vessel, and then the hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a temperature range of 150–250°C to evaluate the effect of reaction temperature, for a reaction time of 2–10h to evaluate the effect of reaction time. After displacing the air, the hydrogen pressure was raised to a certain value. Then the reactor was heated to desired temperature and the stirring speed fixed to 600rpm to eliminate the diffusion effects [10]. Finally, the reactor was quickly cooled down, and the reaction products were separated from the catalysts by centrifugation. The product was analyzed by GC–MS. Hydrogenation of aqueous fraction of bio-oil was also carried out with 50g water soluble fraction of bio-oil and certain amount of catalyst. The mass balance of carbon was evaluated by the sum of reaction products and unreacted materials in comparison with raw materials, which was approximately 93%. The formation of gaseous product (such as CO2) and/or cokes could be attributed to the mass loss during the hydrogenation reaction. All the experiments were carried out at least two times and the results agreed within 5%. The effective hydrogen carbon ratio (H/Ceff factor) [11] was calculated and defined as follows: H / C eff = H - 2 O C where H, O and C are the moles in the O-contained compounds. The H/Ceff factors of the model compounds in synthetic bio-oil and possible products were given below: acetic acid (HAc), 0; furfural (FFR), 0; acetol, 0.67; guaiacol, 0.67; catechol, 0.33; cyclopentanol (CPOL), 0.8; 1,2-propanediol, 1.33; ethanol, 2; cyclohexanol (CPL), 1.67."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil,"3.1 Catalytic hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil 3.1.1 Effect of catalysts on the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil Herein the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil was conducted over 20% Ni/CNT, (15+5)% NiMo/CNT, (10+10)% NiCu/CNT and (10+10)% NiCo/CNT, which were selected over single model compounds in previous studies [8–11]. The general comparison of products distribution was presented in Table 1 . As can be seen, the main product was in liquid phase with very few gaseous product, and there was a subtle increase in catalyst amount after drying due to the formation of coke in the hydrogenation process. The detailed product distribution in liquid phase was presented in Fig. 1 . With the extension of reaction time from 2h to 10h, the conversion of furfural, acetol and guaiacol increased gradually with very low conversion rate of acetic acid, as organic acids were the slowest step for the hydroprocessing of bio-oil [20]. The conversion rate of acetol and furfural was all high than 80%, and the conversion rate of acetic acid was all below 20% (up to 17% over NiMo/CNT) over the four kinds of catalysts. The conversion rate of guaiacol increased when the reaction was carried over (15+5)% NiMo/CNT, (10+10)% NiCu/CNT and (10+10)% NiCo/CNT catalysts. The aforesaid results indicated that the metal synergistic effect could improve the catalytic activity for the conversion of those low H/Ceff compounds (furfural, acetol, guaiacol and acetic acid) to corresponding alcohols with high H/Ceff, which were needed for the catalytic upgrading of bio-oil. As existed in Fig. 1, there were six kinds of alcohols detected in the liquid phase product: ethanol, 1,2-propanediol, cyclopentanol (CPOL), cyclohexanol (CPL), catechol and furfuryldeneacetol (F-A-OH). Ethanol and 1,2-propanediol mainly came from the hydrogenation of acetic acid and acetol respectively; CPOL came from the hydrogenation of furfural; catechol and CPL came from the hydrogenation of guaiacol, and CPL was the further hydrodeoxygenation product of catechol [11]. F-A-OH was produced in an aldol condensation reaction between furfural and acetol (Fig. 2 ), which involved the CC coupling between the carbonyl group of one molecule and the carbonyl α-carbon of the other molecule (in this case acetol, since furfural has no α-H atoms). Additionally, different isomers existed in the formed F-A-OH, which could give most valuable hydrocarbon after deep hydrogenation [21]. It could be found that, the hydrogenation products of synthetic bio-oil were in good accordance with our previous studies [8–11]. An obvious synergistic effect happened in the hydrogenation process of synthetic bio-oil, which confirmed that the presence of other model compounds would inevitably influence the hydrogenation pathway of single model compound. The relative compound compositions of synthetic bio-oil after hydrogenation are presented in Table 2 . It could be seen that CNT-supported bi-metal catalysts showed better catalytic activity with increased alcohol amount with high H/Ceff and decreased aldehydes, ketones, phenols and acids amount. The synergetic activation between different metals might lead to the improvement of catalyst activity, which was observed that the properties (such as dispersibility and metal mean size) improved in bi-metal catalysts. Additionally, in comparison with the four catalysts, NiMo/CNT could give higher acetol and acetic acid conversion and NiCo/CNT could give better furfural and guaiacol conversion due to the decreased amount after hydrogenation, which was also in accordance with our previous studies toward the conversion of single model compound [8–11]. 3.1.2 Effect of catalyst amount on the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil Based on the results in Fig. 1 and Table 2, when the reaction was carried out over NiMo/CNT catalyst, the amount of compounds with high H/Ceff was relatively higher than other catalysts, so (15+5)% NiMo/CNT catalyst was chosen for other studies. As can be seen in Fig. 3 , when (15+5)% NiMo/CNT catalyst amount increased from 1.5wt.% to 2.5wt.%, there was general improvement in conversion rate of each model compound in the synthetic bio-oil due to the increase in catalytic active sites. When 1.5wt.% catalyst was used, higher amount of catechol was detected in the liquid product for there were no more catalytic active sites for the deep hydrogenation of intermediate [11]. Additionally, when the catalyst amount increased, the alcohol composition in the liquid product was as high as 64.4% with a general decrease in those compounds with low H/Ceff. The results were reasonable as increased catalytic active sites were favorable for the deep hydrogenation of those undesirable compounds to stable compounds with high H/Ceff. 3.1.3 Effect of temperature and initial H2 pressure on the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil The product distributions over different reaction temperature are presented in Table 4. As can be seen, increased reaction temperature would lead to the increase in both solid and gaseous phase products. When the catalyst was separated from liquid product after reaction at 250°C, the catalyst was surrounded by dark and viscous material, and after drying, the catalyst amount was up to 2.7g, which was caused by the formation of polymers produced in high temperature. The increased reaction temperature would also lead to the increase in gaseous products due to the decomposition of small molecule compounds such as acetic acid and ethanol. As higher reaction temperature (250°C) would lead to side reactions such as polymerization and decomposition, so herein, 150°C and 200°C were chosen for the analysis of detailed liquid phase product distributions. As presented in Fig. 4 , when the reaction was carried out at 200°C, the guaiacol conversion improved with very few amount of catechol and increased amount of compounds with high H/Ceff in the products, which indicated that high temperature was favorable for the conversion of the intermediate catechol to cyclohexanol [11]. The increase in F-A-OH amount indicated that the aldol condensation between furfural and acetol happened easier at relatively high temperature. The effect of initial H2 pressure on the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil is presented in Fig. 5 . It could be found that all the conversions of each model compound were much lower with decreased amount of alcohols in liquid product when the reaction was carried out at lower initial H2 pressure (<5MPa). As hydrogen was reactant during the reaction, the product distribution results indicated that enough hydrogen was needed for the conversion of either those undesirable compounds or intermediate (such as catechol) into alcohols. In Table 3 and Fig. 5, continued increase in alcohol amount was observed with the increase in either NiMo/CNT amount or initial hydrogen pressure in the reaction, as increased NiMo/CNT amount could lead to the increase in catalytic active sites, and higher initial hydrogen pressure would be beneficial to the further hydrogenation. As for this phenomenon, higher NiMo/CNT amount and initial hydrogen pressure were applied in the hydrogenation reaction, and the results showed that when the NiMo/CNT amount was up to 4wt.% and initial hydrogen pressure was higher than 8MPa, the alcohol amount was as high as 69.6%, which would not continue to increase with the increase in catalyst amount and initial hydrogen pressure. Although the results were reasonable as those two factors would do good for the further hydrogenation, detailed studies were still in need for the hydrogenation process."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation of aqueous fraction of bio-oil,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of aqueous fraction of bio-oil 3.2.1 Effect of catalysts on the product distribution The catalytic conversion of aqueous fraction of bio-oil was carried out over previously screened catalysts: Ni/CNT, NiMo/CNT, NiCu/CNT and NiCo/CNT. And the results before and after hydrogenation are presented in Table 5 . The alcohol amount was only 7.3% with lots of undesirable compounds with low H/Ceff such as aldehydes and phenols. However, the alcohol amount increased to 42.6%, 62.1%, 55.1% and 58.7% respectively, with decreased amount of those undesirable compounds over Ni/CNT, NiMo/CNT, NiCu/CNT and NiCo/CNT, which indicated that the four catalysts exhibited varied catalytic activity to convert those compounds with low H/Ceff to alcohols. As exhibited in Table 5, the alcohol amount was up to 62.1% with lower aldehydes, ketones, phenols and acids amount when the reaction was carried out over NiMo/CNT, which was in good accordance with the results in synthetic bio-oil hydrogenation. The results also confirmed that it was reasonable to choose synthetic bio-oil for the screening of catalysts. Additionally, the element analysis was carried out for the detailed analysis of H/Ceff. The H/Ceff of aqueous bio-oil (water/oil=3:1) was only 0.15, and when the hydrogenation reactions were carried out over Ni/CNT, NiMo/CNT, NiCu/CNT and NiCo/CNT respectively, there was an obvious improvement in H/Ceff of the reaction products. It was presented in Table 5 that, the H/Ceff improved to 0.50–0.68 over different catalysts, which was directly associated with the catalytic activity and the content of high H/Ceff compounds (such as alcohols). The improvement of H/Ceff also conformed to the results for the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil considering the product distribution. Based on the aforesaid results, NiMo/CNT catalyst was chosen for other studies. 3.2.2 Effect of water/bio-oil ratio on the products distribution The product distributions of aqueous fraction of bio-oil under different water/bio-oil ratio are presented in Table 6 . It could be seen that almost all compounds amount in aqueous increased with the increase in water/bio-oil ratio. When the water/bio-oil ratio was up to 3:1, there was no significant change in the compound amount. As presented in Table 7 , when the hydrogenation of aqueous fraction of bio-oil was carried in low water/bio-oil ratio (<3:1), those undesirable compounds would lead to side reactions, such as polymerization reaction, which would inevitably lead to the increase in solid phase amount. So, 3:1 was selected as the final water/bio-oil ratio for the preparation of aqueous fraction of bio-oil in the further studies. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction temperature and initial H2 pressure on the product distribution The effect of temperature on the product distribution is presented in Tables 8 and 9 . As can be seen, the undefined compound amount increased when the reaction temperature raised, which might come from the polymerization of large molecular compounds and the decomposition of small molecular compounds in high temperature. As bio-oil contained much more kinds of compounds than synthetic bio-oil, so the hydrogenation of bio-oil in high temperature would lead to the formation of those undesirable compounds. On the other hand, the results in Table 8 confirmed that the prepared NiMo/CNT catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity in mild reaction conditions with enhanced alcohol amount and decreased in other chemical amounts. The results in Table 10 confirmed that initial H2 pressure also had great influence on the hydrogenation reaction as H2 played the part of reactant during the reaction. The enhancement of initial H2 pressure would lead to completely and further hydrogenation of those compounds with low H/Ceff, which were confirmed that the alcohol compound amount improved from 56.4% to 67.3% with further decrease in other compound amount after reaction. 3.2.4 GC–MS and IR analyses of aqueous fraction of bio-oil before and after hydrogenation The GC–MS analysis results of aqueous fraction of bio-oil before and after hydrogenation over different catalysts are presented in Table 11 . It could be seen that, in the aqueous fraction of bio-oil, acetic acid, furfural, hydroxyacetaldehyde, and acetol were the main components of acids, aldehydes, ketones. Phenol compounds contained different kinds of chemicals, such as guaiacol and 4-ethyl-phenol. Those compounds were all of low H/Ceff, which was not needed for bio-oil. The results in hydrogenated bio-oil showed that NiCu/CNT, NiCo/CNT, NiMo/CNT had varied catalytic activity to convert those aforesaid undesirable compounds with low H/Ceff into alcohols, although the acetic acid amount decreased a little after hydrogenation as it was most difficult to be converted. Other acids, such as propanoic acid and butanoic acid, could also convert to alcohols. Aldehydes, such as furfural and hydroxyacetaldehyde could convert to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, cyclopentanol and ethylene glycol, respectively. Acetol, the main component of ketones, converted to propylene glycol, and other kinds of ketones could transform to corresponding alcohols. Those phenols were always of low H/Ceff (e.g. guaiacol, 0.67; catechol, 0.33), and the conversions were much complex compared with acids, aldehydes and ketones. However, the decrease in phenol amount and the increase in alcohol amount confirmed that the hydrodeoxygenation reaction actually happened over NiCu/CNT, NiCo/CNT, NiMo/CNT catalysts. 2-Methyl-cyclohexanol and cyclohexanol mainly came from the hydrodeoxygenation of 2-methyl-phenol, 3-methyl-phenol and guaiacol, and the detailed conversion paths were presented in our previous study [11]. The guaiacol and catechol amount decreased a little with the increased amount of 2-methyl-cyclohexanol and cyclohexanol. This phenomenon happened due to the conversion of vanillin to guaiacol and catechol, which indicated that the catalytic hydrogenation was much complex process in comparison with model compounds as bio-oil contained various kinds of compounds. Additionally, the levoglucosan amount decreased after hydrogenation over the three catalysts. The hydrolysis and hydrogenation of levoglucosan happened in the upgrading process would help to convert levoglucosan to either ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. As the complexity of compound composition of bio-oil, detailed conversion paths were still in need in the further study. The IR results of aqueous fraction of bio-oil before and after hydrogenation over different catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . The peak at 3400cm−1 was connected with the OH functional group in alcohols and aromatic compounds. The peak at 2800–3000cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of CH. The peaks at 1650–1760cm−1, 1720–1740cm−1, and 1705–1725cm−1 were connected with CO functional group in acids, aldehydes and ketones. The peak at 1580–1730cm−1 was connected with CC functional group in aromatic compounds. The decrease in the intensities of CO and CC functional groups and the increase in the intensities of OH functional group and CH confirmed the decrease in acids, aldehydes, ketones and phenols amount, which indicated that NiCu/CNT, NiCo/CNT, NiMo/CNT catalysts were of varied catalytic activity for the conversion of those undesirable compounds to alcohols, and those catalysts were of good catalytic activity for the conversion of compounds with low H/Ceff to alcohols. 3.2.5 TEM and NH3-TPD analysis TEM images of (15+5)% NiMo/CNT, (10+10)% NiCu/CNT, (10+10)% NiCo/CNT are shown in Fig. 7 . In comparison with the particle size distributions of the three catalysts, it could be seen that (15+5)% NiMo/CNT gave smaller mean metal particle size, which was only 13.16nm compared with the other two catalysts (14.36nm and 13.26nm respectively) confirming that (15+5)% NiMo/CNT had better dispersibility. The metal sizes were mainly between 9.8 and 13.6nm, which was also much smaller compared with other catalysts. In our previous studies, it was found that the much larger particles were Ni particle and smaller ones were the other kinds of metal particles [9,10]. Actually, the better dispersibility would lead to the improvement of NiMo/CNT catalyst activity. The NH3-TPD profiles for both CNT and CNT supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . It could be seen that only weak acid sites existed in both CNT and NiMo/CNT. In comparison, the acidity in NiMo/CNT was relatively stronger than CNT. However, both weak acid sites and mediate strong acid sites were found in NiCu/CNT and NiCo/CNT catalysts. As exhibited in Fig. 8, the overall acid amounts increased slightly with the addition of either Cu or Co. The peaks of NiCu/CNT and NiCo/CNT catalysts shifted to relatively strong acid, although the strength of acid sites was still weak. Thus, the order of catalysts acidity for the same metal loading was (10+10)% NiCo/CNT>(10+10)% NiCu/CNT>(15+5)% NiMo/CNT. Combined with previous studies, it could be found that weak acid sites were prone to the hydrogenation reaction in aqueous [9–11], and strong acid sites were unfavorable for the hydrogenation of bio-oil. As (15+5)% NiMo/CNT catalyst had much weaker acid sites, better metal size distribution, and better dispersibility, NiMo/CNT showed better catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of either synthetic bio-oil or aqueous fraction of bio-oil, which was confirmed in the aforesaid studies. 3.2.6 Catalyst recyclability of NiMo/CNT catalysts To investigate the recyclability of catalysts, a batch of (15+5)% NiMo/CNT catalysts was used repeatedly for the catalytic hydrogenation of aqueous fraction of bio-oil at 150°C for 10h with an initial hydrogen pressure of 6MPa. As exhibited in Table 12 , there was a relatively obvious catalyst deactivation after the catalysts were reused twice considering both alcohols and other compound amount. The agglomeration of active component in NiMo/CNT might lead to the catalyst deactivation, which was confirmed by the TEM results. It could be seen in Fig. 9 that when the catalyst was reused twice, metal agglomeration was observed which would inevitably decrease the catalytic activity. As for the deactivation of catalysts, further studies were still needed for the modification of catalysts."
8,Conclusion,"CNT-supported nickel-based catalysts exhibited varied catalytic activity for the conversion of either synthetic bio-oil or aqueous fraction of bio-oil to alcohol compounds. The synergetic activation between different metals in bi-metal catalysts would lead to the improvement of catalyst activity due to better metal dispersibility, smaller metal mean size, proper acid sites and acidity. The optimal reaction conditions were selected as 150°C for 10h with an initial hydrogen pressure of 5MPa. Results showed that reduced (15+5) wt.% NiMo/CNT exhibited better catalytic activity with higher amount of alcohol compounds, and the alcohol amount was 61.8% and 63.9% respectively when the hydrogenation was carried out with synthetic bio-oil and aqueous fraction of bio-oil. Additionally, the possible reaction pathways were proposed and discussed. CNT-supported non-sulfided nickel-based catalysts showed good usability in the upgrading process of bio-oil, which could provide possible alternatives for those sulfided catalysts and noble metal catalysts."
