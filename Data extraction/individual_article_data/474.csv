0,Introduction,"The main criteria for the selection of feedstock for biofuels production are their availability, cost, carbohydrate content and biodegradability. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) meets with them and it is the most abundant renewable resource on earth [1,2]. From them, wheat straw is one of the most abundant LCB worldwide, with a production of 529 million tons [3]. The greater production of agricultural residues is obtained from cereals (e.g., wheat among others) and is directly associated with the production of grains. In Mexico, for every kilogram of grain produced, approximately one kg of lignocellulosic residue (i.e., straw) is obtained [4]. At the end of 2019, the Mexican Agricultural and Fisheries Information Service (SIAP by its acronym in Spanish) reported a production of 3 million tons of wheat-grain [5]. Their residues are mainly used as fodder in livestock, as well soils improvers, construction materials, and composting [4]. Notwithstanding, with the search for alternative and renewable energy sources, the use of agricultural residues as feedstock for biofuels production is seen as a prominent option. For biorefining purposes, the complex LCB lignocellulosic matrix must be debilitated and deconstructed to simpler chemical forms by pre-treatment methods before further processing [6,7]. After pre-treatment, the simple carbohydrates from LCB can be converted into biofuels through fermentation. Microbial fermentations offer an attractive alternative to produce sustainable energy because metabolic diversity of microorganisms enables the use of different substrates as the starting point for biofuels (e.g., ethanol, hydrogen, biodiesel, among others) production. However, high yields and productivities in every step during biofuel production by microorganisms are required for profitable industrial-scale production. Genetically modified microorganisms with redesigned metabolic pathways can improve both yield and productivity [8-10]. Escherichia coli has the capability to generate simultaneously hydrogen (H2) and ethanol (EtOH), because the anaerobic pyruvate breaking produces formate and acetyl-CoA. Then, H2 is produced by formate hydrogenlyase system through the decarboxylation of formate [11], while EtOH formation is carried out by the action of alcohol dehydrogenase, which catalyses the reaction from acetyl-CoA to EtOH [12]. However, under anaerobic conditions, other end-products such as lactate, acetate, and succinate are synthetized to maintain the NADH/NAD+ balance and intracellular pH reducing both H2 and EtOH production [13,14]. Therefore, the removal of the synthesis of one or more of these end-products will increase the carbon flux towards H2 and EtOH synthesis. Different E. coli strains has been constructed to improve H2 and/or EtOH production. Strains such as SR15 (ΔldhA ΔfrdBC) [15], BW25113 ΔhyaB ΔhybC ΔhycA ΔfdoG ΔfrdC ΔldhA ΔaceE [16], and SH5 (ΔhycA ΔhyaAB ΔhybBC ΔldhA ΔfrdAB) [17] may obtain 1.3 to 2.1 mol H2/mol glucose, using glucose as substrate. Additionally, engineered ethanologenic strains [e.g., AH001 (KO11 ΔldhA), AH003 (KO11 ΔldhA ΔpflA), AH005 (KO11 ΔldhA Δpdh), SL40 (KO11 spontaneous mutant resistant to fosfomycin), SZ420 (ΔfrdBC ΔldhA ΔackA ΔfocA-pflB ΔpdhR::pflBp6-pflBrbs-aceEF-lpd)] can produce EtOH-titters approximately of 6–40 g/L and obtain EtOH-yields > 90% of the theoretical maximum (2 mol EtOH/mol glucose) [18-20]. Furthermore, both hydrogenogenic and ethanologenic E. coli strains obtained by genetically engineering may convert complex substrates –likewise raw Agave lechuguilla [21], sweet sorghum [22], wheat straw [23], marine algae [24], cheese whey powder [25]– into H2 and/or EtOH. Although metabolic engineering in E. coli have been widely studied and employed to improve biofuels performance [11,14,26], to our knowledge, studies on the scale-up have not been reported. Therefore, the scale-up of the co-production of H2 and EtOH by a metabolic engineered E. coli using wheat straw hemicellulosic hydrolysates as substrate is presented."
1,Material and methods,
2,Lignocellulosic biomass,"2.1 Lignocellulosic biomass Wheat straw (WS) used in this work was harvested in the spring of 2017 in La Barca (Jalisco, Mexico). The feedstock was milled with a hammer mill (Azteca 301012) using a 1.27 cm screen. LCB composition was determined according to NREL laboratory analytical procedures [27]. Glucan, xylan and lignin content in the LCB (dry basis) were 41.39, 21.0 and 16% for WS, respectively."
3,Hydrolysis of hemicellulosic hydrolysate,"2.2 Hydrolysis of hemicellulosic hydrolysate The hydrolysate was obtained by auto-hydrolysis followed by a 0.25% H2SO4 pre-treatment [28]. Auto-hydrolysis was carried out in a semi-pilot scale pre-treatment continuous tubular reactor (PCTR) at 150 psi (about 180 °C) with a mean residence time of 18 min [28]. The biomass from auto-hydrolysis was further hydrolyzed with 0.25% (v/v) H2SO4 in a 1:2 (w/v) solids loading ratio, in an autoclave at 121 °C for 60 min. The liquid fraction from the pre-treatment was separated by centrifugation and collected for further analysis, and it was identified as wheat straw pretreated (WSP); which contained 1.8 g/L glucose, 39.8 g/L xylose, 7.9 g/L arabinose, 2.6 g/L formate, 7.8 g/L acetate and 1.2 g/L furfural. Further dilutions were made to obtain a hydrolysate with a final concentration of 16.1 ± 0.2 g/L of total reducing sugars (TRS) to perform the scale-up experiments."
4,Construction of mutant strains,"2.3 Construction of mutant strains Strains, plasmids, and primers used for the construction of the mutant strains are shown in Table 1 . W3110 ΔfrdD and W3110 ΔldhA strains from Keio collection [29] were used as donor. The deletion of frdD and ldhA genes was performed using P1 transduction method [30], with some modification as follows: To prepare liquid phage P1 lysate, an overnight culture of E. coli donor strain (W3110 ΔfrdD or W3110 ΔldhA) in LB broth with 30 mg/L kanamycin was washed and suspended in MC medium (10 mM MgSO4 and 5 mM CaCl2). Phage P1 was added with multiplicity of infection between 0.1 and 1.0, and the culture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the culture was added into soft agar and finally plated in LB agar plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After lysis, the culture was treated with chloroform and the debris was removed by centrifugation. The phage was stored at 4 °C until its application. For transduction, an overnight culture of E. coli recipient strain (WDH or WDHL) in LB medium was washed and suspended in MC medium. Phage P1 lysate with the donor strain (W3110 ΔfrdD or W3110 ΔldhA) was added with multiplicity of infection between 0.1 and 1.0. The phage was allowed to absorb for 30 min at room temperature, and then 1 M sodium citrate was added. Finally, all the mixture was plated on selective LB plates with 30 mg/L kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C until colonies appeared. The deletion of frdD and ldhA genes was verified by colony PCR with OGF-F, OGF-R, OG-L-F and OG-L-R primers (Table 1). The ΔfrdD, ΔldhA, or ΔldhA ΔfrdD strains were transformed by electroporation with the pCP20 plasmid and selected by ampicillin resistance in LB + 30 mg/L ampicillin plates at 28 °C. Kanamycin resistance loss was verified by subcultivation on LB plates plus 30 mg/L kanamycin. Selected colonies were tested by PCR to confirm the loss of kanamycin resistance."
5,Effect of frdD and ldhA genes deletion on co-production of H2 and EtOH,"2.4 Effect of frdD and ldhA genes deletion on co-production of H2 and EtOH The effect of frdD and ldhA genes deletion on co-production of H2 and EtOH by Escherichia coli strains (Table 1) was determined by using glucose as substrate (20 g/L). The experiments were done in anaerobic serological bottles containing 0.1 L of B buffer [31], 1 mL/L trace elements solution [25], 0.01 g/L MgSO4 and 1 g/L yeast extract (Difco). The cultures were started with an optical density of 0.2 measured at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600), pH 7.5, and they were incubated at 31 °C and 175 rpm, until no longer production of H2 was observed. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate. The production of H2, EtOH, and other metabolites was measured as indicated in section 2.6."
6,Scale-up of H2 and EtOH co-production,"2.5 Scale-up of H2 and EtOH co-production E. coli WDH-LF strain was selected to perform the scale-up of H2 and EtOH co-production using WSP as substrate (16 g/L TRS). The scale-up experiments were done under anaerobic conditions using the B buffer [31] plus 1 mL/L trace elements solution [25], 0.01 g/L MgSO4 and 1 g/L yeast extract (Difco). The working volumes used were 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 L. A volume of the headspace relative to that of the liquid approximately of 40% was used in 0.01, 1 and 10 L reactors, while 20% was employed in 0.1 L reactors. The cultures were started with an OD600 of 0.2 and pH 8.2. They were incubated at 31 °C and 200 rpm, until no longer production of H2 was observed. The 10 L bioreactors were stirred at 250 rpm during the first 29 h, after which the stirred was increased at 400 rpm. The batch cultures of 0.01 and 0.1 L were accomplished in 14 mL and 120 mL serological bottles, respectively. The batch cultures with working volumes 1 and 10 L were performed in 1.5-L and 13.5-L bioreactors equipped with two six-flat blade Rushton turbines, with a H/D ratio of 2.1 and 1.5, respectively. The pH was monitored using an autoclavable electrode (Applikon® Biotechnology) and connected to Bioconsole ADI 1035 (Applikon® Biotechnology) controlled by the ADI 1030 Biocontroller (Applikon® Biotechnology). BioXpert 1.3 software (Applikon® Biotechnology) was used for data acquisition. The serological bottles experiments (0.01 L, 0.1 L) were realized in quadruplicate, whereas bioreactors (1 L and 10 L) were carried out in duplicate. The production of H2 and EtOH was measured as indicated in Section 2.6."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods TRS determination was performed by the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method [32], with some modifications, as follow: 250 µL of diluted sample with 750 µL of DNS reagent (10 g/L NaOH, 200 g/L KNaC4H4O6·4H2O, 0.5 g/L Na2S2O5, 2 g/L C6H6O, 10 g/L 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid) were heated for 5 min at 100 °C and then cooled down to room temperature. Then, 400 µL of distilled water were added. Xylose (0.1 to 1.0 g/L, Sigma) was used as the reference standard. The absorbance was measured at 595 nm wavelength (iMark™ Microplate Absorbance Reader). Simple carbohydrates and metabolites were quantified by an Agilent HPLC equipped with a refractive index (Agilent Technologies 1220 Infinity LC), using a Rezex™ ROA-Organic Acid H+ (Phenomenex) column, operated at 60 °C with H2SO4 0.0025 M as a mobile phase (0.550 cm3/min). Furfural was analyzed by Gas Chromatography (Agilent Technologies 6890 N Network GC Systems) using a capillary column HP-Innowax (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 m film thickness; Agilent Technologies). Injector and flame ionization detector (FID) temperatures were 220 and 250 °C, respectively. Helium was used as carrier gas at 25 mL/min. Analyses were performed with a split ratio of 10:1 and a temperature program of 35 °C for 2 min, then 10 °C/min to 210 °C for 1 min. Gas production was measured by acidified water (pH ≤ 2) displacement in an inverted burette connected to serological bottles/bioreactor with rubber tubing and a needle. H2 concentration (%, v/v) in the gas was determined by with a Gas Chromatography (Agilent Technologies 6890 N Network GC Systems) coupled to a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent Technologies 6890 N Network GC Systems) and using Agilent J&W HP-PLOT Molesieve column (0.32 mm ID, 30 m length, 12 μm film) under the following conditions: 200 °C, injector temperature; 280 °C, detector temperature; 300 °C, oven temperature. Helium was used as carrier gas. H2 volume was corrected to standard conditions of temperature and pressure (298.15 K and 105 Pa)."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis For comparisons between samples, the data was analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test (Origin® 9). A probability of 5% was accepted as statistically significant."

10,Improvement of H2 and EtOH co-production by frdD and ldhA genes deletion in H2-overproducer Escherichia coli strains,"3.1 Improvement of H2 and EtOH co-production by frdD and ldhA genes deletion in H2-overproducer Escherichia coli strains To enhance the co-production of H2 and EtOH, the effect of deletion of ldhA and frdD genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase was determined. The modified pathway is shown in Fig. 1 A, and the genotypes of the constructed strains are shown in Table 1. The first step involved the deletion of ldhA gene in two H2-overproducer strains, E. coli ΔhycA (WDH) and E. coli ΔhycA ΔlacI (WDHL) [25], through phage P1 transduction method (Fig. 1B). Then, ΔhycA ΔldhA (WDH-L) and ΔhycA ΔlacI ΔldhA (WDHL-L) E. coli strains were generated. The effect of ldhA gene deletion on co-production of H2 and EtOH was determined in batch cultures (0.01 L) using glucose (20 g/L) as substrate at 31 °C and initial pH of 7.5. After 160 h (Fig. 2 A), the WDH-L and WDHL-L strains produced 1,639.7 ± 231.3 and 1,870.5 ± 286.0 mL H2/L, respectively. According to the analysis of variance, not statistically significant difference (Table A1, p < 0.05) was found in the H2 produced by each strain. The H2 production rate (rH2) obtained by WDH-L strain was 8.0 ± 0.4 mL H2/L, whereas WDHL-L strain almost doubled that value (i.e., 13.7 ± 2.5 mL H2/L), as shown in Fig. 2A. However, comparing it with their parental (WDH and WDHL) strains [25,33], rH2 seems to not have been affected by ldhA gene deletion, which agrees with previously reported for E. coli ldhA mutant strains [34,35]. Regarding to metabolites distribution at the end of dark fermentation (Fig. 2B), the WDH-L strain produced 1.20 ± 0.10 g/L succinate, 0.90 ± 0.45 g/L lactate, 3.18 ± 0.33 g/L acetate and 5.90 ± 0.75 g/L ethanol. Whereas, the WDHL-L strain generated 1.58 ± 0.02 g/L succinate, 3.60 ± 0.34 g/L lactate, 3.82 ± 0.13 g/L acetate and 3.60 ± 0.30 g/L ethanol. The end pH was ranging between 4.75 and 4.93. According to the results, the WDH-L strain produced 1.6-fold more ethanol than the WDHL-L strain. There was statistically significant difference in the final concentration of the metabolites in the cultures after 160 h of fermentation (Table A2). Both strains (WDH-L and WDHL-L) produced approximately the same amount of H2, but the WDH-L strain produced the higher concentration of EtOH. This finding helps us to select WDH strain for the following experiments. The deletion of frdD gene was performed in WDH and WDH-L strains to obtain the WDH-F (E. coli ΔhycA ΔfrdD) and WDH-LF (E. coli ΔhycA ΔldhA ΔfrdD) strains. To determine the effect of frdD gene deletion on co-production of H2 and EtOH by E. coli, the fermentation of 20 g/L of glucose in a batch culture during 180 h at 31 °C and initial pH of 7.5 was conducted (Fig. 3 ). The WDH-F strain obtained 1.3- and 1.4-fold more H2 than the wild-type (E. coli W3110, WT) strain and its parental (WDH) strain, respectively. Regarding to rH2, the WT, WDH, and WDH-F obtained almost the same results –ranging between 53.9 and 59.4 mL H2/L/h without statistical difference– as shows Table A3. However, both WT and WDH strains produced more EtOH (2.7 ± 0.1 and 1.9 ± 0.2 g/L, respectively) than WDH-F strain (1.3 ± 0.20 g/L). This behavior responds to the fact that in WDH-F strain the flux of glucose was utilized mainly to produce lactate instead of EtOH or another metabolite. Comparing both double mutant strains, WDH-F strain produced 1.5-fold more H2 and obtained 2.4-fold higher rH2 than WDH-L. But the latter produced 4.5-fold more EtOH than WDH-F due to the fact flux of glucose seems to be partially redirected to EtOH by the ldhA gene deletion. The co-production of H2 and EtOH was significantly improved by both ldhA and frdD genes deletion. The WDH-LF strain produced 2,950.3 ± 261.8 mL H2/L, 1.7-fold and 1.5-fold more H2 than the WT and WDH strains, respectively (Fig. 3A). Also, WDH-LF strain produced more H2 than WDH-L (1,650.83 ± 234.20 mL H2/L) and WDH-F (2,523.03 ± 93.54 mL H2/L). Although, H2 production was increased by ldhA and frdD genes deletion. rH2 seems to be decreased in WDH-LF strain, WDH-LF strain obtained 40.35 ± 3.89 mL H2/L/h, whereas WT and WDH attained 53.91 ± 3.15 and 55.69 ± 3.23 mL H2/L/h (Fig. 3B), respectively. Succinate and lactate production were dramatically reduced by the deletion of frdD and ldhA genes, whereas the EtOH production was improved compared to WT strain (Fig. 3C). The WDH-LF strain produced 7.20 ± 0.26 g EtOH/L, which is 2.7-, 3.8-, 1.2, and 5.5-fold more EtOH than obtained by WT, WDH, WDH-L, and WDH-F strains, respectively (Table A4). These results are consistent with the previously reported [16,35], and confirmed that the absence of frdD and ldhA genes improves the co-production of H2 and EtOH by E. coli using glucose as substrate. Mutagenesis of competing metabolic pathways has been widely employed to improve H2 and/or EtOH production performance [36]. To improve H2 production, the most utilized strategies are related to disruption of genes –such as ldhA, frdAB, hycA, hya, and hyb–, inactivation of formate-hydrogen lyase (FHL) repressor (encoded by hycA), and/or overexpression of FHL (encoded by fhlA). Regarding to the EtOH production, EtOH-producer strains [e.g. E. coli SE2378 (Δldh Δpfl) and E. coli SZ420 (ΔfrdBC Δldh ΔackA ΔfolA-pfl ΔpdhR::pflBp6-aceEF-lpd)] have been constructed by deleting the competing fermentation pathways, and implementing another molecular strategies such as gene overexpression. However, the low H2 yields is still a limitation for large-scale H2 production via dark fermentation, and it is not economically sustainable. To overcome this issue, co-production of H2 and EtOH has been proposed [37]. In this regard, using E. coli ΔhycA ΔhyaAB ΔhybBC ΔldhA ΔfrdAB as parental strain, mutant strains devoid pta-ackA (encoding to phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase, respectively) or pfkA (encoding to phosphofructokinase 1) genes were constructed to increase the H2 and EtOH co-production [38]. The authors concluded that Δack-pta strain does not improve the biofuels co-production. However, the ΔpfkA strain resulted in an increase of approximately 50% and 9.5% of H2 and EtOH, respectively. In the present study, we used the E. coli Keio collection to introduce two mutations into a single strain by the repetition of resistance-gene elimination and P1 transduction; this method may be used to engineer E. coli for many applications where multiple chromosomal genes must be eliminated. The deletion of the lhdA and frdD genes in WDH strain, produce an improvement of 70 and 167% on H2 and EtOH production, respectively."
11,Scale-up of H2 and EtOH co-production from wheat straw hemicellulosic hydrolysate,"3.2 Scale-up of H2 and EtOH co-production from wheat straw hemicellulosic hydrolysate Conversion of biomass into H2 and EtOH has the potential to contribute significantly towards the future energy needs. However, process viability lies in its capacity to be scaled-up to the industrial level. For this reason, the effect of the reactor size on co-production of H2 and EtOH by E. coli WDH-LF was determined. Since lignocellulose is a sustainable and worldwide available biomass, it was selected as feedstock to perform the scaling-up of dark fermentation. Therefore, wheat straw hemicellulosic hydrolysate (WSP) obtained by autohydrolysis followed by a 0.25% diluted sulphuric acid pre-treatment was used as substrate for H2 and EtOH co-production by E. coli WDH-LF. The reactor sizes used to scale-up the process were 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 L. Additionally, the temperature and initial pH previously optimized to co-produce H2 and EtOH by an engineered E. coli strain that utilized lignocellulosic biomass as substrate were employed [23]. The average of the maximum H2 concentration (considering all working volumes) was 50.9 ± 7.4%. The H2 production obtained in 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 L reactors was 5,259.9 ± 540.2, 4,076.1 ± 468.4, 5,574.8 ± 156.6, and 5,603.0 ± 233.5 mL H2/L, respectively, as shows in Fig. 4 A. H2 production was similar in all working volumes except in 0.1 L (Table A5), which was approximately 25% lower than the other sizes. Regarding to the H2 yield, the results obtained were 328.7 ± 33.8, 253.2 ± 29.1, 350.6 ± 9.9, and 342.7 ± 14.3 mL H/g TRS for 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 L reactors, respectively. H2 yield seems to be lower in 0.1 L reactors compared with the other reactor sizes (Fig. 4B). These behaviors respond to the fact that the volume of the headspace relative to that of the liquid (working volume) may affect dark fermentation [39,40], because both H2 and CO2 accumulate to high pressures in the headspace and inhibits H2 production [41]. As described in Section 2.5, 0.1 L reactors employed a lower volume of the headspace relative to that of the working volume than the other reactor sizes. The maximum rH2 attained by WDH-LF strain were 40.7 ± 2.3, 39.2 ± 5.8, 36.9 ± 1.4 and 41.5 ± 4.0 mL H2/L/h for 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 L reactors, respectively (Fig. 4B). Kinetic of H2 production are shown in Fig. 5 . As noted, 10 L reactor attained the longest lag phase compare to the other reactor sizes. This can be explained by the agitation rate utilized in 10 L reactors, which was maintained at 250 rpm during first 29 h and then it was increased at 400 rpm, as described Section 2.5. Mixing may promote dark fermentation performance by enhancing liquid–gas mass transfer, heat transfer, as well as homogenization. However, inappropriate stirring can be harmful to H2 producing bacteria, and thus H2 production may be inhibited [42,43]. The EtOH productions obtained by WDH-LF strain were 8.9 ± 1.3, 7.8 ± 1.7, 7.9 ± 0.6, and 7.9 ± 0.3 g EtOH/L in 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 L reactors, respectively. And the EtOH yields attained during dark fermentation by WDH-LF strain were 0.56 ± 0.08, 0.48 ± 0.11, 0.50 ± 0.04, and 0.48 ± 0.01 g EtOH/g TRS in 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 L reactors, respectively. EtOH yields exceeding theoretical maximum were obtained most probably due to the complex nature of the WSP, which contains several carbon sources (mainly monosaccharides) as described Section 2.2, but also other fermentable organic molecules. At the end of the fermentation, neither reducing sugars nor succinate or lactate were detected in the fermentation broth. Only acetate was detected (~2–3 g/L), which may be due to remaining acetate content in WSP, as well as that WDH-LF strain still the capacity to produce acetate. The production and yield of EtOH seem not to be affected by the change of reactor size, as shown in Fig. 4C. The pH profile of H2 and EtOH co-production for 1 and 10 L appear in Fig. 6 . In 1 L reactors, H2 and EtOH production started in the first 15 h of fermentation, while for 10 L reactors, the first evidence of H2 and EtOH production was after 36 h of fermentation. The pH decreased only two units due to the low organic acids production, which is a consequence of the frdD and ldhA genes absence, involved in the succinate and lactate production, respectively. The optimal culture conditions used in this work were previously established using the WDHL strain [23]. By comparing the results obtained in this work by WDH-LF strain with those previously reported for WDHL strain, the following is noticed: (a) the WDH-LF strain increased 38% the EtOH yield; (b) the H2 production rate was improved approximately 4-fold by E. coli WDH-LF; (c) the H2 yield increased 2-fold by the deletion of ldhA and frd genes. H2 yields reported for microbial consortia and pure cultures from lignocellulosic sources, under mesophilic or thermophilic conditions, are in the range of 200 to 500 mL H2/g consumed sugar [44]. Also, theoretical yields between 70 and 99% has been reported for lignocellulosic ethanol attained by yeast and bacteria [45]. Nonetheless, mainly these biofuels are obtained in separated processes or coupled to the production of other components (Table 2 ). In the present work, co-production was obtained in one step, hydrogen and ethanol, with yields up to 342.7 mL H2/g TRS and 97% (0.48 ± 0.01 g EtOH/g TRS) of the maximum theoretical of ethanol; this strategy could be used in the conceptual design of 2G biorefineries [37]. Dark fermentation has been shown as the most realistic opportunity to leave laboratory scale production behind, which is attributed to the relatively low energy requirements, high biofuels production rates and the chance of using a broad spectrum of organic matter as substrate [46]. However, they still have certain limitations that could be crucial for scaling-up, as the stability of the process in self [47,48]. As an answer to the limitations of the dark fermentation, several researchers have proposed the use of genetically modified microorganisms with advanced selected properties [49]. In the present work, we demonstrate that: (1) the increase of biofuels production yields by deletion of the ldhA and frd genes in a H2-overproducer E. coli strain; (2) E. coli WDH-LF can produce efficiently and simultaneously H2 and EtOH from hemicellulosic hydrolysates via dark fermentation; (3) the yields obtained by WDH-LF strain are stable despite the change in the reactor size."
12,Conclusions,"Deletion of frdD and ldhA genes positively impact the co-production of H2 and EtOH by E. coli, since production, production rate and yield of both biofuels were improved. The metabolic engineered WDH-LF strain may utilize hemicellulosic hydrolysates as substrates to produce simultaneously and efficiently H2 and EtOH, under optimal temperature and pH conditions. The change in the reactor size have not impact on the co-production of H2 and EtOH by E. coli WDH-LF using wheat straw hydrolysate as feedstock, which is inferred because the H2 and EtOH yields were similar despite the working volumes employed. Still, further genetic modifications, as well as engineering techniques must be employed to improve H2 and EtOH production rates and make them competitive in the actual biofuels framework."
