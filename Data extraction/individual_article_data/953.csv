0,Introduction,"The sugar cane industrial sector is one of the main Brazilian economic activities due to its high efficiency and competitiveness [1]. In this segment, sugar mills, alcohol distilleries, and integrated plants of sugar and ethanol are commonly found. In recent years, electricity also has been an aggregate product to this segment, and sugar cane bagasse is being used as fuel in cogeneration systems. In 2006, there were 300 sugarcane plants in operation in Brazil [2]. A total of 394.4 Mt of sugar cane were processed in the 2005/2006 harvest for the production of sugar and ethanol [3]. In the case of Brazil, the equivalent 1% of its total area (3.6 million hectares) is dedicated to sugar cane culture [4]. This amount provides the production of ethanol at a cost of approximately 0.22 USD/L [4]. In a near future in the hydrogen era, sugar and ethanol mills may be modified to produce hydrogen to be used as fuel, besides the conventional products of the traditional ethanol production chain. An aggregate production planning model for sugar and alcohol (ethanol) mills was developed by Ref. [5]. The developed mathematical model was based on the process selection model and the lot-sizing production model, and it aimed to help decision makers in production planning, and in the control of several aspects of the process. A thermodynamic analysis of the ethanol/water system using the Gibbs energy minimization method was carried out by Ref. [6]. An expanded overview about sugar cane mills where electricity generation is considered as a product to sales was evaluated by Ref. [7], considering thermoeconomic and environmental aspects, and also optimization techniques. Other production aspects were reviewed, such as a didactic distillation tower developed by Ref. [8], the thermodynamic analysis of electrical power generation control [9], the exergetic analysis of a simplified model for the gasification process based on chemical equilibrium considerations [10], and also an exergetic assessment of the biomass gasification process [11]. In Ref. [12], it was showed that innovative power plant configurations can increase the bagasse-based cogeneration potential. In Ref. [13], an exergy analysis was run to assess an integrated sugar and ethanol plant with its cogeneration system and, in Ref. [14] strategies, tools and expertise of authors in energy systems optimization were applied to optimize the synthesis and the design parameters of the process, and of the total site starting from the basic idea of dissociating the heat exchanger network design problem from its synthesis problem. A comparative thermoeconomic study of typical systems for sugar cane mills based on real systems that could be adapted to biomass use was presented by Ref. [15]. Simulations of bioethanol production from sugar cane juice and bagasse were carried out by Ref. [16] using software UniSim Design®, where a typical large-scale production plant was considered: 1000 m3/day of ethanol is produced using sugar cane juice as material. In Ref. [17], simulations of an autonomous distillery were carried out along with utilities demand optimization using Pinch analysis concepts. Also, the recovery of residues from sugar cane waste for its use as a renewable energy source was obtained, such as [18], and also for educational purposes based on bio-energy [19]. A review of the disposal practices for the agro-industries sugar cane residue, and the trends of energy use in Cuba were carried out by Ref. [20]. In Ref. [21], it was presented a mathematical model for helping mills choose sugar cane varieties for planting which maximizes crop residual biomass energy balance by considering the difference between the generated and the consumed energy in the process of transferring this biomass from the field into the processing center. Environmental aspects are related [22,23], such as pollutants emission and ecological efficiency that are associated to economic analysis, as it was adapted by Ref. [24,25]. An analysis of the environmental impacts of methanol production from sugar cane bagasse, taking into account the balance of the energy life cycle and its network environmental impacts, both being included in a life cycle assessment approach, was presented by Ref. [26]. Proposed studies on catalysts are very important to steam reforming of ethanol, such as the development of cobalt catalysts to produce hydrogen from ethanol, that was studied by Ref. [27], and it was observed that the ethanol conversion was 50–70% with 10-<1% of CO in the hydrogen. This work aims to assess the impacts of the incorporation of hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming in a traditional sugarcane industry. In order to attain this purpose, a thermodynamic, economic and ecological analysis was performed, and a comparison of the traditional and the innovative sugarcane industry is presented. For the economic analysis, the operational cost, the maintenance cost, the operation period, the interest rate, and the annuity factor are considered. The investment to be applied on the reformer is estimated based on Boehm's Technique. The goal is to make the sugar and ethanol mill production processes more innovative by the incorporation of hydrogen production process through ethanol steam reforming association, as it can be viewed in Fig. 1 ."
1,Methodology,"The methodology adopted in this proposal aims to innovate the production process of sugar and ethanol mills by incorporating the hydrogen production process through ethanol steam reforming. A technical analysis of the power plant was carried out in order to check the feasibility of electricity reduction and, subsequently, an incorporation of hydrogen production process is considered. Afterwards, an economic engineering analysis was run in order to allocate production costs of the new proposed configuration, as well as determining the effects on pollutants emission. Therefore, the incorporation of ethanol steam reforming process into sugar and ethanol mills brings hydrogen production to the sector besides the conventional products (ethanol and sugar), as showed in Fig. 1. The incorporation of steam reforming process into sugar and ethanol mills consists in a conventional plant for sugar and ethanol production associated to the ethanol steam reforming process. In this context, the produced ethanol which is for the consumer market through the drying process achieves an ideal of purity and alcohol content that is required by the National Petroleum Agency [28]. A fraction of the ethanol produced at the plant is targeted directly to the process of hydrogen production. After the evaporation of the mixture of ethanol and distilled water, there are two catalytic steps: one occurring at high temperatures in a device named reformer in which the steam reforming reactions (SRR) occur, and the other one occurring at lower temperatures in a reactor, called as the shift reactor, in which water–gas shift reactions (WGSR) occur."
2,Ethanol steam reforming,"2.1 Ethanol steam reforming In the global reaction of hydrogen production utilizing ethanol, 6 mol of hydrogen from 1 mol of ethanol are produced. The global reaction is shown in Eq. (1). At high temperatures, this one consists in a reaction of ethanol and water in a gaseous state, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, as shown by Ref. [29]. (1) C 2 H 5 OH ( v ) + 3 H 2 O ( v ) → 2 CO 2 ( g ) + 6 H 2 ( g ) Eq. (2) shows the steam reforming reaction which is an endothermic reaction of ethanol with water, resulting in the production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This reaction may occur through an external reforming process. (2) C 2 H 5 OH ( v ) + H 2 O ( v ) → 2 CO ( g ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) The water gas shift reaction is exothermic and reversible, that can occur at lower temperatures than the latter reaction. However, the CO conversion is incomplete, and an additional process to remove it is necessary, as shown in Eq. (3). (3) CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( v ) → CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Several chemical reactions can occur simultaneously with the steam reforming of ethanol reaction. Eq. (4) shows a representative equation, that is, a production of methane from carbon monoxide, also called as methanation. (4) CO ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) → CH 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) In Bouduard's reaction, the production of carbon is described through carbon monoxide decomposition, as shown in Eq. (5). (5) 2 CO ( g ) → CO 2 ( g ) + C ( s )"
3,Energetic analysis,"2.2 Energetic analysis In order to incorporate the ethanol steam reforming, it was chosen the third configuration of the studies and data, obtained by Ref. [37], where five different configurations of power plants were analyzed besides considering the expansion of the cogeneration system. This configuration is shown on Fig. 2 , and its data are in the Appendix. First, the calculations are applied to region of the condensing turbine which is detached, as shown on Fig. 3 , where there are two extractions (sections 5 and 6). Low pressure steam is directed to the condenser at point 7. The goal is to verify whether there is surplus electric power that can be redirected without affecting the production processes of sugar and ethanol. According to operational data from the turbine manufacturer, it has flow limitations, pressure, and temperature of steam, as shown in Table 1 . As the steam extraction in 5 and 6 are directed to the process (sugar and ethanol production), the mass flow must be kept constant. Point 7 (directed to the condenser) presents a steam amount which is higher than the minimum flow rate, indicated by manufacturer. Therefore, it is possible to reduce its electricity generation by diminishing the mass flow rate to the minimum quantity allowed (8 t/h) and, consequently, the surplus bagasse can be redirected to produce steam for the reforming process. The bagasse amount is obtained using Eq. (6). (6) m ˙ b g = m ˙ s ( h b e − h b i ) η b · LHV Where: h be enthalpy at boiler exit [kJ/kg]; h bi enthalpy at boiler inlet [kJ/kg]; m ˙ b g bagasse mass flow rate [kg/s]; m ˙ s steam mass flow rate [kg/s]; η b 83.5 boiler efficiency [%]; LHV lower heating value [kJ/kg] (7320 kJ/kg [33]). According to [30], in his experimental work, the energy supplied for the combustion of 1.23 kg/h of bagasse provides energy to produce 1 Nm3/h of hydrogen, as well as 0.7961 L/h of anhydrous ethanol is consumed to produce 1 Nm3/h of hydrogen. Based on this work, it was used 0.8597 L/h of hydrated ethanol to produce 1 Nm3/h of hydrogen. 2.2.1 Power plant efficiency The power plant efficiency is given by Eq. (7). (7) η cog = W ele + W mec + Q proc − W pump LHV b g · m ˙ b g Where: LHVbg lower heating value of bagasse [kJ/kg]; m ˙ b g mass flow rate of bagasse [kg/s]; Q proc power used in the production process of sugar and ethanol [kW]; W ele electric power [kW]; W mec mechanical power [kW]; W pump power consumed by pumps [kW]. 2.2.2 Thermodynamic efficiency of ethanol steam reforming process According to [30], the calculation of the thermodynamic efficiency of hydrogen production process, as shown in Fig. 4 , can be done using the Eq. (8). (8) η ref = m ˙ H 2 · LHV H 2 m ˙ b g · LHV b g + m ˙ eth · LHV eth Where: LHVbg lower heating value of bagasse [kJ/kg]. LHVeth lower heating value of ethanol (anhydrous or hydrated) [kJ/kg]; LHV H 2 lower heating value of hydrogen [kJ/kg]; m ˙ b g bagasse mass flow [kg/s]; m ˙ eth ethanol volumetric flow [L/s]; m ˙ H 2 hydrogen volumetric flow [Nm3/h]. The results are shown on Table 2 ."
4,Economic analysis,"2.3 Economic analysis The economical engineering calculations were based on [31,32], and it was considered the feasibility of the sugarcane industry to produce a maximum amount of hydrogen using ethanol (anhydrous or hydrated) by electricity generation reduction. In order to reach this proposal, an economic analysis based on the investment of hydrogen production system was applied, where the input costs, the operating cost, the maintenance cost, the operation period, the interest rate, and the annuity factor were taken into account. According to [30,33,34], in order to determinate the cost of hydrogen production, Eqs. (9) and (10) can be used. (9) C H 2 = I n v ref · f H · E H 2 + C OP + C MAN (10) C OP = E b g · C b g E H 2 + E EtOH · C EtOH E H 2 Where: C bg bagasse cost [US$/kWh]; C EtOH ethanol cost [US$/kWh]; C H 2 hydrogen production cost [US$/kWh]; C MAN maintenance cost [US$/kWh]]; C OP operation cost [US$/kWh]; E bg energy supplied by bagasse [kW]; E EtOH energy supplied by ethanol [kW]; E H 2 energy supplied by hydrogen [kW]; f annuity factor [1/ano]; H operation period [h/year]; Inv ref reference investment [×104 US$]. Operational cost using bagasse as fuel is shown in Eq. (10), and according to [35], the maintenance cost of the steam reformer can be estimated as 3% of the investment, such as in Eq. (11). (11) C MAN = 0.03 · I n v ref · f H · E H 2 The annuity factor (f) is shown in Eq. (12) and the capital value in Eq. (13). (12) f = q k · ( q − 1 ) q k − 1 (13) q = 1 + r 100 The reference investment (Inv ref) was estimated using Boehm's technique [36], and its application is according to Fig. 5 . Through Fig. 5, Eq. (14) was obtained. (14) C = C r ( S / S r ) m Where: C equipment cost for a size of interest; C r equipment cost for a size of reference S r ; m factor that indicates the economic level (0.5–1.0). The reference investment for the reformer ranging from 1 to 1500 Nm3/h was adapted by Ref. [33], resulting in Eq. (15). (15) I n v ref = 400 ( m H 2 750 ) 0.5304 Where: m H 2 hydrogen production capacity [Nm3/h]. In order to make a comparison between different types of ethanol (anhydrous and hydrated), it was assumed that the hydrated ethanol production cost is 70% of the anhydrous ethanol's total production cost."
5,Ecological efficiency of the power plant,"2.4 Ecological efficiency of the power plant According to [24,25], the pollution indicator that measures the environmental impact is given by Eq. (16). (16) Π g = ( CO 2 ) e LHV b g Where: (CO2) e equivalent carbon dioxide [kg/kgfuel]; Π g pollution indicator [kg/MJ]. The equivalent carbon dioxide is given by Eq. (17). (17) ( CO 2 ) e = CO 2 + 80 ( SO 2 ) + 50 ( NO x ) + 67 ( M P ) Where: (SO2) e = 80(SO2) equivalent sulphur dioxide in (CO2); (NO x ) e = 50(NO x ) equivalent nitrogen dioxide in (CO2); (MP) e = 67(MP) equivalent particulate material in (CO2). For the calculations, two scenarios were considered: one of them measures the total emission/absorption of carbon dioxide cycle since the planting up to ethanol production that is named “with carbon cycle”. The other scenario, named “without carbon cycle”, does not consider all cycles. Fig. 6 shows the scenario with the carbon cycle. According to [30], pollutant emissions from the hydrogen production process by ethanol steam reforming and their pollution indicator, and the equivalent carbon dioxide for sugarcane bagasse as fuel are shown on Tables 3 and 4 , respectively. Based on it, the parameters for the power plant can be calculated, as shown on Table 5 . The ecological efficiency for the power plant is given by Eq. (18). (18) ε cog = [ 0.204 · η cog ln ( 135 − Π g ) η cog + Π g ] 0.5 And the ecological efficiency of the steam reforming process is given by Eq. (19). (19) ε ref = [ 0,204 η ref ln ( 135 − Π g ) η ref + Π g ] 0,5 Where: ε cog power plant ecological efficiency [–]; ε ref thermodynamic efficiency for hydrogen production process [–]; η cog power plant efficiency [%]; η ref hydrogen production process efficiency [%]; Π g pollution indicator [kg/MJ]. 2.4.1 Overall ecological efficiency (power plant + steam reforming process) In order to calculate the overall ecological efficiency (ε gl), it must be taken into account the two processes, the power plant and the steam reforming process. In order to do so, it is taken into account the weight of equivalent carbon dioxide generation (CO2)e of each process, as shown in Eq. (20). (20) ε g l = ( [ ( CO 2 ) e ] cog ε cog + [ ( CO 2 ) e ] ref ε ref ) [ ( CO 2 ) e ] cog + [ ( CO 2 ) e ] ref Where: [(CO2)e]cog equivalent carbon dioxide of power plant; ε cog ecological efficiency of power plant; [(CO2)e]ref equivalent carbon dioxide of steam reforming process; ε ref ecological efficiency of steam reforming process."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Technical analysis,"3.1 Technical analysis On Table 6 , it is shown the energy calculations associated with the new hydrogen production process in the power plant. Fig. 7 shows a comparison between the consumption of hydrated and anhydrous ethanol for the same amount of hydrogen production. It is consumed about 8% of more hydrated ethanol for the same hydrogen amount production. Fig. 8 shows the bagasse consumption and a consequent reduction of electricity generation for a hydrogen amount. In order to produce 5000 Nm3/h of hydrogen, it is required a reduction of around 3000 kW of power. Fig. 9 shows how the power plant efficiency is affected by the bagasse amount that is directed to produce steam for the ethanol reforming process. There is an increase of around 6% in the power plant's efficiency for a hydrogen production of 5000 Nm3/h."
8,Economic analysis,"3.2 Economic analysis As previously stated, it is adopted that the hydrated ethanol production cost is 70% of the anhydrous ethanol's total production cost, and thus it is possible to compare them. Fig. 10 shows that the hydrogen production cost with the hydrated ethanol is more feasible than with the anhydrous ethanol, regardless of the annual interest rate having an equivalent period of operation (H) of 4000 h/year. Fig. 11 shows that the hydrogen production cost is strongly affected by the equivalent period of operation (H) because using anhydrous ethanol with an equivalent period of operation of 4000 h/year is more advantageous than using hydrated ethanol with 2500 h/year."
9,Ecological efficiency,"3.3 Ecological efficiency 3.3.1 Steam reforming process The ecological efficiency results of the steam reforming with different ethanol types associated to the carbon cycle are shown on Table 7 . Hydrated ethanol presents higher ecological efficiency than anhydrous ethanol in both cases, with and without the carbon cycle. 3.3.2 Power plant affected by hydrogen production Table 8 shows that the hydrogen production slightly affects the ecological efficiency of the power plant, which can be considered constant. There is just an increase of approximately 1% without the carbon cycle and 0.4% with it. As expected, the ecological efficiency, considering the carbon cycle, presents higher results than those without the cycle, approximately 10%. 3.3.3 Overall ecological efficiency Table 9 shows the overall ecological efficiency for both types of ethanol (anhydrous and hydrated), considering the effects of the carbon cycle. As expected, the overall ecological efficiency, considering the carbon cycle, is higher than without the carbon cycle, approximately 18%."
10,Conclusions,"This work examines the incorporation of hydrogen production by an ethanol steam reforming process in a sugarcane industry. For this purpose, it was identified a sugarcane industry with a cogeneration system, where its main products were: sugar, anhydrous and hydrated ethanol, and the sale of surplus electrical power. In order to avoid further impacts to the existing production processes, firstly, it was analyzed whether there would be surplus electric power and what would be its availability. From this analysis, it was reached an electric power of 3050.77 kW and a consequent available bagasse amount that is responsible for producing steam for the reforming system. Based on that, it was determined the maximum volumetric flow of hydrogen (5126 Nm3/h) and ethanol amount (anhydrous 4080.8 L/h or hydrated 4406.8 L/h). It was observed that the power plant efficiency can be considered constant with hydrogen production, presenting an increase of approximately 6% for the production of 5000 Nm3/h of hydrogen. The same behavior is observed for the ecological efficiency. Furthermore, it is not so affected by the type of ethanol, with the difference between them being approximately 1.5%. With this study, it is concluded that the incorporation of hydrogen production at a sugarcane industry through ethanol steam reforming process is a feasible alternative, and that despite the generation reduction of surplus electricity (3000 kW), it was produced a kind of nobler energy, hydrogen (5000 Nm3/h) that is equivalent to 5000 kW, obtaining a energetic gain. Although the anhydrous ethanol has a lower heating value that is greater, and it takes less amount of it to produce 1 Nm3/h of hydrogen (around 8%), the results have shown that the hydrated ethanol is the best alternative for hydrogen production through ethanol steam reforming. The main reason for this result was the production cost difference between the anhydrous and the hydrated ethanol that, in the present situation, the production cost of hydrated ethanol was assumed as being 70% of production cost of the anhydrous ethanol."
