0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H) represents the ultimate energy carrier due to its lightness, high abundance and potentially zero environmental impact. Its low mass results in unparalleled gravimetric energy density (142 MJ kg−1), about 3 times higher than liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrogen can be produced from water using renewable energy, either by integrating alkaline electrolysers [1] with photovoltaic power generation or by photoelectrochemical water splitting exploiting sunlight [2]. In combination with oxygen in a fuel cell, it produces electricity and yields only clean water vapor as exhaust product [3,4], therefore its use in the transportation sector would significantly abate atmospheric pollution. This scheme builds up a carbon-neutral energy cycle, also offering a viable solution to the problem of storing energy from intermittent sources such as sunlight and wind. The principal disadvantage of hydrogen is the very low temperature of its critical point (33.2 K), which makes it quite impractical to handle liquid H2 in everyday’ s life [5]. Due to the low volumetric density of the gas, there is a need to develop compact hydrogen storage media in order to manage efficiently hydrogen production and use. An attractive solution in this respect is provided by solid-state hydrogen storage in hydrides [6], since it can achieve a volumetric density above 100 kg H2 m−3, i.e. well above liquid H2 (70 kg H2 m−3) and ~ 3 times higher than pressurized tanks (<40 kg H2 m−3 at 70 MPa), moreover allowing for operation under safe pressure conditions. Among the numerous materials investigated to this purpose, magnesium hydride (MgH2) remains a prominent candidate by virtue of high gravimetric (7.6 wt% H2) and volumetric (109 kg H2 m−3) storage capacities, high abundance (2% of Earth surface composition and almost unlimited in sea water), non-toxicity, and relatively safe operation [7,8]. However, the exploitation of Mg as hydrogen storage medium has been hampered by its slow absorption and desorption kinetics and high thermodynamic stability, both usually requiring high operating temperatures of about 300 °C. In this work, we present the new concept of biphasic Mg–Ti–H nanoparticles (NPs) that outperform existing Mg-based materials both from the kinetic and thermodynamic point of view. The fundamental sources of kinetics and thermodynamics limitations in Mg/MgH2 are of different nature [9,10]. In fact, sluggish kinetics relate to both surface and bulk properties. Theoretical calculations of Mg surfaces show very low rates of both H2 dissociation and recombination, which are required steps for hydrogen absorption and desorption, respectively [11]. The rapid formation of MgO or Mg(OH)2 passivating surface layers, that takes place even under clean atmosphere, aggravates the situation [12]. As for bulk properties, the formation of a MgH2 outer layer during hydriding, coupled with the slow diffusivity of hydrogen through MgH2, results in a so-called blocking effect that strongly slows down H2 absorption kinetics [13]. On the other hand, thermodynamics reflects the strength of the Mg–H bond and dictates the equilibrium pressure/temperature conditions for hydrogen uptake and release. With a strongly negative enthalpy of hydride formation Δ H ≈ − 74 kJ/mol H2, and a formation entropy Δ S ≈ − 133 J/K·mol H2 [14], H2 desorption from MgH2 at atmospheric pressure can only take place above T = 282 °C. It is important to remark that kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogen sorption exhibit no straightforward relation. For instance, in TiH2 the stronger Ti–H bond results in an even less favorable thermodynamics compared to MgH2, with a formation enthalpy Δ H ≈ − 130 kJ/mol H2 [15]. However, H2 sorption kinetics are faster, because i) H2 dissociation and recombination at the surface is favored by the availability of s-type orbitals around the Fermi level [16] and ii) atomic hydrogen diffuses rapidly in TiH2, e.g. the characteristic time for a diffusion length of 13 nm is only 22 s at room temperature [17]. It is therefore by no means obvious how to steer both kinetics and thermodynamics in the right direction at the same time. In the case of Mg/MgH2, H2 sorption can be significantly enhanced by grain refinement coupled with the addition of suitable additives such as transition metal oxides [18,19] and hydrides [20]. The most popular synthesis route is mechanochemistry through ball milling that yields MgH2 particles of about 2–5 μm in diameter with a dispersion of smaller nanoparticles (10–20 nm) of the additive phases. Among the best performances reported within the vast literature on the subject, we cite MgH2–TiH2 ball-milled nanocomposites, showing a H2 desorption rate of about 3.2 wt%/min at T = 300 °C [17] that strongly decreases down to 0.10 wt%/min at 150 °C even under high vacuum conditions [21]. Another benchmark example is that of ball-milled MgH2–Nb2O5 that exhibits a similar desorption rate (into vacuum) of about 4 wt%/min at T = 300 °C and 0.6 wt%/min at 250 °C [22]. However, the thermodynamics of these microstructures is essentially the same as bulk Mg, because the MgH2 particle size is too large and the interface/surface area too small [23–25]. Until today, significant changes in the thermodynamics of hydrogen desorption by MgH2 have been reported only in ultra-thin films (<10 nm) generally embedded within TiH2 and have been attributed to the interface free energy change upon H2 sorption [26,27]. The key to observe a measurable effect is the high interface area per molar volume of the material. While ultra-thin films are extremely useful model systems to study such effects and may find applications in sensors [28], they fail to comply with the possibility of upscaling, which is needed for a hydrogen storage application. Moreover, all experiments in Mg-based thin films employed a Pd capping layer to protect the samples and promote H2 dissociation/recombination. Herein, we provide evidence of simultaneous improvement in kinetics and thermodynamics for Mg–Ti–H composite NPs, the length scale of which is two orders of magnitude smaller than for conventional ball-milled powders. We obtain an ultra-fine mixing of MgH2 and TiH2 phases within single nanoparticles grown by gas-phase condensation of Mg and Ti vapors under He/H2 atmosphere. This is noteworthy because Mg and Ti are bulk-immiscible both as metals and as hydrides. The unique nanostructure of these samples combines the high interface area featured by ultra-thin films with the three-dimensional scalable morphology of powders. Therefore, by a suitable up scaling of the NPs preparation equipment, it would be possible to conceive a high throughput production of a hydrogen storage medium unaffected by the severe volumetric and gravimetric penalty of supported thin films. The Mg–Ti–H composite NPs feature full H2 desorption at temperatures as low as 150 °C, at a rate between 0.1 and 0.2 wt%/min against a pressure of about 100 Pa. Moreover, the equilibrium H2 pressure increases by a factor of up to ≈ 4.5 at T = 100 °C compared to bulk-like MgH2, being similar to that observed in 2 nm thin films. Remarkably, these results are achieved without using Pd as H2 dissociation/recombination catalyst and with a maximum reversible hydrogen storage capacity that approaches 5 wt% for the best Ti/Mg atomic ratio."
1,Material and methods,
2,Preparation of nanoparticles,"2.1 Preparation of nanoparticles Mg–Ti–H nanoparticles (NPs) were grown by Gas Phase Condensation (GPC) of mixed Mg–Ti vapors under an equimolar H2/He gas atmosphere at the total pressure p ~ 260 Pa . The growth process was carried out in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) stainless-steel chamber previously evacuated to the base pressure ≈ 2 × 10 − 5 Pa. The precursor materials, Mg ingots (Alpha Aesar 99.95% purity) and Ti powders (Alpha Aesar 99.9% purity, 150 mesh), were evaporated inside two Joule-heated tungsten boats positioned few centimeters apart in order to favor the vapor mixing. The metal vapors lose kinetic energy through collisions with the surrounding gas atmosphere and attain a supersaturation state that leads to homogeneous condensation of NPs. The evaporation rates of Mg and Ti were monitored by means of a quartz crystal microbalance and tuned by controlling the heating currents, in order to prepare samples with different Ti content. From now on, the samples will be labelled as Mg– X Ti Ti–H, where the average Ti atomic percentage X Ti is defined as X Ti ≡ 100 ⋅ Ti/(Ti + Mg). He (99.9996%) and H2 (99.995%) were continuously fed into the chamber at a constant flow rate of 5 nml/min by means of two mass flow controllers, while a rotary pump connected to the chamber via a metering valve counteracted the inlet flow, dynamically maintaining a constant gas pressure. The NPs aerosol was collected onto the surface of a stainless-steel rotating cylinder internally cooled by liquid N2. After the evaporation, the NPs were scraped off the cylinder under high vacuum, collected into a stainless-steel cup and transferred into a secondary UHV chamber for in situ characterization of hydrogen sorption properties. Fig. S1 of the Supporting Information displays a detailed mechanical drawing of the NPs preparation set-up."
3,In-situ hydrogen sorption measurements,"2.2 In-situ hydrogen sorption measurements The secondary chamber had a total volume of 5144 cm 3 calibrated by means of a reference volume using a pressure sensor. The NPs sample, with a typical mass of about 50 mg, was held inside a glass vial connected to a sub-section with a smaller volume of 1888 cm 3 that could be isolated via a gate valve to achieve a higher sensitivity to hydrogen uptake and release. A small tubular oven with a resistive wire heater, variable power supply and feedback thermocouple in contact with the sample holder allowed for the realization of isothermal conditions in the range from 100 to 150 °C. The thermocouple was calibrated by comparison with a semiconductor thermistor. The temperature accuracy was estimated as ± 0.5 °C and the temperature stability was also in that range, yielding an overall temperature uncertainty of ± 1 °C. The hydrogen pressure p ( H 2 ) in the 1 − 2 ⋅ 10 4 Pa range was measured using a Varian ceramic capacitance diaphragm gauge (CDG) pressure sensor. At low pressure, the sensor output was amplified 100 times to achieve the necessary sensitivity; the sensor signal was digitized by a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter. As a first treatment, the as-prepared NPs were soaked in H2 ( p ( H 2 ) = 20 kPa ) at room temperature and then heated at 150 ° C for 1 h to induce the complete hydride formation. One set of samples with X Ti = 7 , 35 , 63 at.% was employed to study pressure-dependent H2 absorption and desorption kinetics at 150 °C, starting with a desorption from the hydride state. The kinetics were determined by recording the pressure change Δ p ( t ) at 150 °C until the pressure remained essentially constant. The asymptotic pressure change was of the order of 100 Pa, depending on the Ti content and on the sample mass. In the case of absorption, this was much smaller than the initial pressure and therefore the kinetics were quasi-isobaric, thus maintaining nearly constant the driving force of the transformation. Differently, for desorption kinetics the initial pressure was quite low, typically only 10 Pa, as requested in order to start well below the desorption plateau pressure. Therefore, the conditions could not be maintained nearly isobaric. To overcome this limitation, desorption kinetics were also determined under high vacuum conditions p ( H 2 ) < 10 − 2 Pa by measuring the ion current associated with the m / q = 2 mass-to-charge ratio with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (model Pfeiffer QMS-200). After ten cycles of desorption/absorption kinetics, one full desorption/absorption pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) was recorded at 150 °C. The PCIs were determined by the manometric method, i.e. by monitoring pressure changes Δ p ( t ) after stepwise increments (absorption branch) or decrements (desorption branch) of the hydrogen pressure. The measurements were carried out under quasi-equilibrium conditions, with a waiting time of 1000 s between two subsequent pressure steps. Due to the lower limit of the pressure sensor, it was not possible to collect accurate equilibrium pressure data below 1 Pa. The measured Δ p ( 1000 s ) values were converted into moles of absorbed or desorbed hydrogen and finally into a hydrogen-to-metal mass ratio (H/M in wt%) by knowing the calibrated volume and the sample mass. High vacuum coupled with mass spectrometry analysis was also used to quantify the amount of desorbed H2 in the low-pressure final part of the PCI desorption branch. A second set of samples with X Ti = 14 , 22 , 46 , 63 at.% was employed to study the temperature dependence of the plateau pressures and to construct the van ‘t Hoff plots, from which thermodynamic data were obtained. The plateau pressures for absorption and desorption were determined from PCIs steps carried out at T = 150 , 137 , 125 , 112 , and 100 °C. The measurement sequence was designed in order to limit coarsening phenomena during the measurements. In fact, even if Ti helps as a nanostructure refiner, the formation of larger NPs and the segregation of Ti was spotted by electron microscopy analysis of the NPs subjected to several H2 sorption cycles. Moreover, the relative MgO amount can also increase upon cycling, which could deteriorate the H2 sorption kinetics and affect the determination of equilibrium. This issue may be solved in the future by filtering oxygen and moisture impurities and/or by optimizing the amount of material relative to the reaction chamber. Here, we adopted an experimental strategy that minimizes contamination and coarsening while conveying the relevant data to assess the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. Full details about the experimental sequence are provided in the Supporting Information."
4,"Structural, chemical and morphological characterization","2.3 Structural, chemical and morphological characterization Prior to their extraction from the UHV system, the NPs were subjected to a final H2 absorption at T = 150 °C and p ( H 2 ) = 15 − 20 kPa, after which the glass vial containing the sample was cooled to room temperature and filled with pure Argon at atmospheric pressure. The sample vial was finally sealed under Ar for further analyses. The previously defined average Ti content X Ti in each sample was determined employing a Leica Cambridge Stereoscan 360 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-ray detector for energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDS). Microstructural and nanoscale compositional analyses were performed by using a Philips TECNAI F20 ST transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200 kV. The instrument is equipped with EDS and scanning transmission (STEM) accessory. The TEM images were taken in the phase contrast mode. STEM pictures were recorded using a High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) detector. Selected Area electron Diffraction (SAD) patterns were processed using the PASAD plugin developed for the Digital Micrograph software to determine the azimuthal integration profiles [29]. For (S)TEM observations, a sealed vial containing the NPs was filled with isopropyl alcohol using a syringe that perforated the plastic cap. The obtained suspension was sonicated, and few drops of the suspension were casted on a copper grid coated with an amorphous carbon film. The lattice parameters and the crystallite size of the phases constituting the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical X'celerator diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation. The XRD profiles were analyzed using the MAUD full-profile refinement software [30]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural characterization,"3.1 Structural characterization The typical morphology of Mg–Ti–H NPs prepared by GPC and subjected to a single hydrogen loading at 150 °C is illustrated by Fig. 1 (a,c) , showing the two samples Mg–14Ti–H and Mg–63Ti–H. The average size of the primary NPs decreases from d N P ≈ 26 nm for low X Ti = 7 at.% to d N P ≈ 10 nm for high X Ti , as reported in Table S1. The NPs exhibit significant aggregation, as commonly observed in GPC due to partial sintering in proximity of the hot vapor source [31,32]. The peculiarity of these samples is that each NP contains both Mg and Ti, the two elements being finely distributed at the nanoscale despite their mutual immiscibility in the bulk. This feature is highlighted in Fig. 1 (b,d) by the STEM-EDS line scans taken across individual NPs after H2 sorption cycling, similar results being obtained on all NPs for every composition. We notice that the K-line X-rays of both Mg and Ti are detected at each point inside the NPs. The fluctuations of the Mg/Ti ratio along the scans sometimes exceed the statistical uncertainty, indicating that the two elements do not form a homogeneous solid solution and that segregation into Mg-rich and Ti-rich domains takes place. This view is consistent with the picture provided by XRD, as discussed in the following. The XRD profiles in Fig. 2 show that the crystalline phases after H2 absorption are tetragonal MgH2 (space group P 42 / m n m ), TiH2 and MgO. In addition, a small amount of metallic Mg is detected in the samples with lower X Ti of 7 and 14 at.%, indicating that H2 absorption is not complete within the time-temperature window of the measurements described in the next section. The Bragg reflections associated with TiH2 are rather broad, pointing to a small crystallite size that ranges from about 3.5 nm at low X Ti to about 7 nm at high X Ti (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). This makes it difficult to distinguish between the fluorite-type cubic TiH2 (space group F m 3 ‾ m ) and its distorted tetragonal variant ε-TiH2 (space group I 4 / m m m ). Goodness of fit indicators are in favor of the tetragonal phase, in agreement with our previous reports [33,34]. With increasing Mg content, the Bragg reflections of ε-TiH2 shift toward lower angles, indicating an expansion of the ε-TiH2 unit cell volume by 2 − 4 % (see lattice parameters in Table S1) that may arise from solubility of Mg, whose atomic radius is larger than Ti. The observed expansion corresponds to a 6 − 10 at.% Mg solubility within ε-TiH2 domains [34]. Conversely, for MgH2 the Bragg angles and the derived lattice parameters are not affected by X Ti , indicating that the solubility of Ti in MgH2 is certainly below 1 at.% [33]. The crystallite sizes of both hydride phases strongly correlate with their relative amount. In particular, the decreasing content of one phase comes along with the increasing crystallite size of the other (Table S1), showing that each hydride acts as a grain refiner and/or coarsening inhibitor for the other, a phenomenon already reported for hydride-based composites [17,20]. This effect already takes place while NPs nucleate and grow in the gas phase [33,35] and becomes more important during H2 sorption cycles. A clear example of cycling-induced morphological evolution for X Ti = 14 at.% is conveyed by Fig. 1b, showing cycled NPs that are significantly larger than the corresponding primary NPs of Fig. 1a. In samples Mg–7Ti–H and Mg–14Ti–H, the average NPs diameter observed by TEM after cycling is d N P ≈ 40 nm, while in Mg–22Ti–H d N P ≈ 30 nm. These values are similar to the MgH2 crystallite size given by XRD, consistently with the observation that the NPs are mostly single-crystalline. For the other samples with higher Ti content, we did not detect a significant evolution of the NPs size upon cycling. The increased NPs size likely slows down H2 sorption kinetics, which may explain the presence of residual metallic Mg for samples Mg–7Ti–H and Mg–14Ti–H. As a possible coarsening mechanism, we propose that sintering occurs between metallic Mg NPs after H2 desorption, on account of the low melting point of Mg. In the subsequent H2 absorption, the MgH2 phase nucleated at the grain boundary between sintered NPs may grow into a larger crystallite. However, unravelling the atomistic coarsening mechanisms would require dedicated experiments, possibly including in situ observations, which are beyond the scope of the present work. In summary, STEM-EDS shows that Mg and Ti are present inside each NP with a composition that fluctuates around the overall average value for each sample, while XRD shows that the main phases are MgH2 and TiH2, with little or no mutual solubility. The combination of these results therefore proves that MgH2 and TiH2 coexist at the single NPs level. Unfortunately, it is not possible to record high resolution TEM images of MgH2/TiH2 interfaces because MgH2 readily decomposes under the electron beam [36], yielding metallic Mg and MgO. Such a decomposition is proved by the SAD pattern with azimuthal integration displayed in Fig. 3 a for the sample Mg–14Ti–H. In comparison with the XRD pattern in Fig. 2, we notice a strong increase in the diffracted intensity by Mg and MgO at the expenses of MgH2. After prolonged e-beam exposure, we do not observe any MgH2 diffraction spots, hinting at its full decomposition. At low X Ti it is also difficult to detect the electron diffraction of TiH2 because the corresponding rings partially overlap with those of Mg and are quite faint due to the small crystallite size. At high Ti contents, only TiH2 and MgO are detected by electron diffraction following MgH2 decomposition under the electron beam, as shown in Fig. 3b for sample Mg–46Ti–H. The absence of metallic Mg may be due to the smaller NPs size that facilitates full oxidation by residual gaseous impurities in the TEM column. In this sort of post mortem scenario, one can figure out the original spatial distribution of TiH2 and MgH2 phases through HR-TEM images that highlight the lattice spacing of TiH2 and MgO, as shown in Fig. 3c. Here, TiH2 crystallites smaller than 10 nm are here seen in close proximity to MgO crystallites, a clear indication that many MgH2/TiH2 interfaces were present in the samples before decomposition. These interfaces are the subject of the subsequent discussion centered on improved hydrogen thermodynamics and kinetics of Mg–Ti–H NPs."
7,Hydrogen sorption thermodynamics,"3.2 Hydrogen sorption thermodynamics Fig. 4 displays the PCIs recorded at 150 °C on three samples with X Ti = 7 , 35 , and 63 at.%, covering the widest compositional range available in the present work. The same data are plotted on a normalized horizontal scale from 0 to 1 in Fig. S2 of the Supporting Information. Actually, these PCIs were recorded after a set of ten desorption/absorption kinetics, presented later on in Section 3.3. We notice that it is not possible to compare directly these data with bulk Mg because its kinetics are so sluggish that no measurable hydrogen sorption takes place at this temperature under close to equilibrium conditions. The inspection of the figures highlights several distinct features, discussed here below, which reveal a composition-dependent thermodynamics in Mg–Ti–H NPs. • The gravimetric reversible hydrogen storage capacity decreases with increasing Ti content. This is because the main contribution to reversible storage arises from the Mg + H 2 ↔ MgH 2 reaction. In fact, TiH 2 does not decompose under the pressure/temperature conditions of our experiments. There is, however, a reversible capacity likely associated with Mg 4 − n Ti n clusters, which release hydrogen at low pressure but still within the range of the experiments, as discussed next. • Besides the main absorption and desorption plateaus shown by all samples in the H-rich part of the PCIs, the two Ti-rich samples exhibit reversible H2 sorption at much lower pressure. The sensor range and the pressure control system of the in situ setup did not allow the accurate determination of low equilibrium pressures, and we can only state that the equilibrium pressure of the low-pressure H2 sorption process is lower than the experimental limit, i.e. ≤ 1 Pa. The relative importance of the low-pressure H2 sorption on the overall reversible capacity increases with Ti content as shown by Fig. S2. Previous studies on Mg1-xTixHy thin films showed that several low-pressure plateaus are associated with H2 sorption by Mg 4 − n Ti n clusters in a metastable solid solution [37]. We therefore suggest that the low-pressure H2 sorption originates with the solution of Mg in TiH 2 , as indicated by XRD analysis. In the following, the discussion of H2 sorption thermodynamics will focus on the main plateau at higher pressure associated with the Mg + H 2 ↔ MgH 2 reaction. • Fig. 4 and Fig. S2 show that the mid-plateau pressures for both desorption ( p d e s ) and absorption ( p a b s ) are higher in the Ti-rich samples compared to Mg–7Ti–H. This result points to an upward shift of the equilibrium pressure, i.e. a destabilization of the hydride, with increasing Ti content. The upward shift of the desorption plateau is noteworthy, because it is a signature of destabilization that is not always present in Mg-based nanostructures. For instance, in elastically clamped Mg–Pd alloy thin films, p a b s was clearly composition-dependent and could be shifted upward by exploiting elastic constraints, while p d e s was not [38]. Also in Mg–Ti–Pd layered nanodots it was observed that the p a b s increased with decreasing nanodots size, while p d e s remained essentially unchanged [39]. A thickness-dependent upward shift of both p a b s and p d e s was reported for quasi-free MgH2 thin films sandwiched within TiH2 layers [26], as well as for MgH2 clusters embedded in a TiH2 film [27]. In order to assess the temperature and composition dependence of equilibrium pressures, we have proceeded to determine p a b s and p d e s on another set of four samples with X Ti = 14 , 22 , 46 and 63 at.%. These samples were subjected to a single desorption/absorption cycle at 150 °C, during which kinetics were measured, prior to carrying out PCI steps at five temperatures in the range 100 – 150 ° C ( 373 − 423 K ), as detailed in the Supporting Information. The equilibrium pressure was calculated as: (1) p e q = ( p a b s ⋅ p d e s ) 1 / 2 The results are summarized in Fig. 5 , where the coloured dashed lines represent best fits according to the van ‘t Hoff equation for the different compositions. It is interesting to compare these data with those measured at 90 °C for unclamped Mg films of 2 and 50 nm [26], also displayed in Fig. 5. The 2 nm Mg film appears to almost lie on the line of Mg–63Ti–H NPs, while the thicker 50 nm film has a much lower p e q , which lies on the black dash-dotted van ‘t Hoff line in Fig. 5, calculated using the thermodynamic parameters of bulk Mg Δ H b u l k 0 = − 74.1 kJ / molH 2 and Δ S b u l k 0 = − 133.4 J / K ⋅ molH 2 [14]. We remark again that no experimental values are available for bulk Mg in this temperature range, and that the above parameters were obtained from equilibrium data collected around 300 °C. Nevertheless, the fact that the calculated dash-dotted line crosses the experimental p e q value of a relatively thick, unclamped Mg film supports the validity of this extrapolation. The equilibrium value previously measured on similar Mg–6Ti–H NPs at 100 °C is also reported [33]. The important message of Fig. 5 is that p e q lies clearly above the line of bulk Mg for all Mg–Ti–H NPs and tends to shift upward with increasing Ti content, although both data and fit for X Ti = 14 and 22 at.% are nearly superposed and indistinguishable within the experimental uncertainties. These considerations hold also for the separate p a b s and p d e s data reported in Figs. S3 and S4. The enthalpy and entropy values obtained from the best fit parameters are displayed in the inset of Fig. 5 where the same colours used for p e q data have been applied to distinguish samples with different Ti content. As one can see, the enthalpy Δ H N P 0 and entropy Δ S N P 0 data for the NPs are affected by large uncertainties because the investigated temperature range, constrained by slow kinetics on the low T side and by coarsening phenomena on the high T side, is too narrow to allow a robust determination of two fit parameters. Despite these uncertainties, it appears that both Δ H N P 0 and Δ S N P 0 depart from the bulk values represented by the black circle in the inset of Fig. 5 and that they exhibit a decreasing trend (in absolute value) with increasing X Ti . The solid line in the inset of Fig. 5 is the best linear fit to the Δ H N P 0 vs Δ S N P 0 series. Its slope, T ∗ = 477 ± 5 K, represents an apparent enthalpy-entropy compensation temperature, i.e. a temperature, at which all samples have the same Gibbs free energy Δ G N P 0 and therefore the same plateau pressure. The fact that T ∗ is well above the average temperature of the measurements may point to a genuine enthalpy-entropy compensation temperature. However, in our opinion a solid proof of such a compensation would require a more accurate determination of enthalpy and entropy through measurements over a more extended temperature range [40]."
8,Hydrogen sorption kinetics,"3.3 Hydrogen sorption kinetics Fig. 6 displays the absorption kinetics measured at 150 °C on the same three samples of Fig. 4 for different hydrogen pressures p ( H 2 ) , while Fig. 7 shows the corresponding desorption kinetics. As mentioned above, the kinetics were actually measured before the PCIs, carrying out 2 or 3 absorption/desorption cycles at each pressure with the aim to check reproducibility and stability. The H2 sorption rate strongly depends on composition, the time necessary to attain 50% of the maximum hydrogen storage capacity clearly decreasing with increasing X Ti . A collection of kinetics measured at 150 °C on all samples is provided in Fig. S5 of the Supporting Information. Inspection of kinetic data in Fig. S5a reveals that the H2 absorption rate peaks at about 4.8 wt%/min for the two samples with X Ti = 14 and 22 at.%. The desorption rate is also quite good for these samples and increases further in sample Mg–35Ti–H as shown in Fig. S5b. Moreover, the reversible gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity peaks at about 4.8 wt% for Mg–14Ti–H. Therefore, as far as reversible storage kinetics are concerned, the most appealing performances are found in the range X Ti = 14 ÷ 35 at.%. This result originates with two competing factors that intervene when the Ti content is increased, namely the speed up of the metal-hydride transformation and the loss of reversible capacity. There is no point in going to lower Ti contents because both the reversible capacity and the H2 sorption rate appear to decrease. As concerns the pressure dependence of H2 absorption, illustrated by symbols with different brightness in Fig. 6, we clearly observe that the kinetics speed up with rising p ( H 2 ) . The transformed fraction α ( t ) is described well by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation for nucleation and growth kinetics [34]: (2) α ( t ) = 1 − e x p ( − ( k a b s t ) n ) The corresponding best-fit curves are displayed as solid lines in Fig. 6. In all cases, the reaction order n is close to unity, a value compatible with instantaneous nucleation followed by 2-dimensional diffusion-controlled or 1-dimensional interface-controlled growth [34,41]. The rate constant k a b s , displayed in Fig. S6, increases with X Ti and appears to increase linearly with p (H2), as often reported for absorption kinetics [42]. The pressure dependence function f ( p ) of the kinetic rates has been discussed extensively by Ron [42], who reviewed different forms of f ( p ) used in the literature. The most common forms for f ( p ) are compared in Fig. S7, which confirms that the linear dependence is the one that best fits our k a b s values. This result can be explained considering that the flow of hydrogen from the environment toward the surface of the reacting material is proportional to p − p e q [42]. The function f ( p ) must be inserted into the differential rate equation attributed to a specific mechanism or reaction order, i.e. nucleation and growth in the present case. For nearly isobaric kinetics with p well above p e q , the integration is straightforward and yields the observed linear dependence of k a b s on the H2 pressure. Our kinetic data show that the blocking layer effect is negligible in the biphasic NPs, even at low Ti content where after H2 sorption cycles the average NPs diameter d N P grows to about 40 nm. In this context, it is worth to remark that Duan et al. have also recently found fast in-plane H diffusion in thin Mg films deposited on a Ti-buffer layer [43]. In contrast to out-of-plane H diffusion there is absolutely no blocking effect for in-plane H diffusion. Therefore, we suggest that Mg/TiH2 interfaces constitute accelerated paths for H diffusion also in our NPs. Using the mobility data of Duan et al. it is possible to estimate that, if H2 absorption were diffusion-limited, the loading time at 150 °C would be very short, i.e. ≈ 0.01 s for d N P = 10 nm and ≈ 0.16 s for d N P = 40 nm [43]. Since the H2 absorption times visible in Fig. 6 are definitely much longer, we may deduce that the rate-limiting step of hydride growth is not given by in-plane H diffusion. In conjunction with the above JMAK fitting, we therefore suggest that hydride forms by nucleation followed by 1-dimensional interface-controlled growth. In the case of H2 desorption kinetics, it was not possible to carry out measurements under nearly isobaric conditions due to the low desorption plateau pressure. In fact, the pressure rises significantly during H2 release from the sample, eventually approaching the plateau pressure. Under these conditions, H2 release becomes so slow that it may be necessary to restore high vacuum in order to complete the desorption, as shown in Fig. 7 for Mg–35Ti–H. The dependence of the initial desorption rate on p (H2), already demonstrated in Fig. 7 for p (H2) = 10 and 60 Pa, is represented in Fig. S8 over a wider pressure range. A remarkably fast desorption rate of about 0.19 wt%/min is measured at p (H2) = 100 Pa."
9,Interface destabilization model for biphasic nanoparticles,"3.4 Interface destabilization model for biphasic nanoparticles The ratio p e q , N P / p e q , b u l k can be converted into a free energy bias δ Δ G 0 , i.e. a change of the reaction's free energy, through the simple equation [26,44]: (3) δ Δ G 0 ≡ Δ G N P 0 − Δ G b u l k 0 = R T ln p e q , N P p e q , b u l k This thermodynamical bias is therefore the vertical distance from the bulk Mg line in Fig. 5 converted into suitable energy units. By inspection of Fig. 5, one can easily realize that δ Δ G 0 exhibits an increasing trend with increasing Ti content and that it decreases with increasing T . In particular, at T = 100 °C and X Ti = 63 at.%, we determined δ Δ G 0 ≈ 4.7 kJ / mol H 2 , which corresponds to a pressure increase p e q , N P p e q , b u l k ≈ 4.5 and is very close to the bias measured in 2 nm thick Mg films sandwiched within TiH2 [26]. By comparison, the standard free energy for bulk MgH2 formation at T = 100 °C is Δ G b u l k 0 = Δ H b u l k 0 − 373 ⋅ Δ S b u l k 0 = − 24.3 kJ / mol H 2 . These results are relevant because they show an altered thermodynamics of hydrogen in Mg-based NPs from both absorption and desorption experiments, while previous reports were based solely on absorption data [45,46]. Three main causes may be responsible a priori for the observed thermodynamical bias. The first is the presence of Ti atoms in solid solution within the Mg/MgH2 lattice. However, this can be excluded because the lattice parameter should change with Ti content, in contradiction with the results of XRD analysis. The second is the strain associated with elastic constraints in a multiphase nanostructured material [24,47]. While this effect can dominate the behavior of thin films rigidly attached on a substrate and of fully encapsulated nano-objects, we suggest that it plays a minor role here, since the NPs are free to expand outward and because the Mg/TiH2 interface provides only a very weak clamping [48]. The third is the change of the interface free energy upon hydride formation and decomposition, that can induce a thermodynamical bias according to Refs. [23–26]: (4) δ Δ G 0 = ∫ h y d γ h y d ⋅ d A − ∫ m e t γ m e t ⋅ d A Where γ h y d ( γ m e t ) is the interface free energy per unit area in the hydride (metal) phase. The integrals are calculated over all interfaces in either the hydride or metal phase and are normalized to 1 mol of Mg. There are some relatively simple cases, in which the total interface area A i n t per mole of Mg does not change upon hydride formation/decomposition. If this is so, the bias becomes simply δ Δ G 0 = A i n t ⋅ Δ γ where Δ γ ≡ γ h y d − γ m e t . Clearly, A i n t depends on sample microstructure and/or composition. One example is provided by Mg/MgH2 thin films of thickness d embedded within TiH2 layers, for which Mooij et al. have shown that [26]: (5) δ Δ G 0 = A i n t ⋅ Δ γ = 2 V ‾ Mg d Δ γ where V ‾ Mg = 13.98 ⋅ 10 − 6 m 3 is the molar volume of Mg. Another case, relevant for the modelling of our samples in the limit of low Ti content, is that of separated TiH2 nano-crystallites of diameter d TiH 2 embedded within larger Mg/MgH2 NPs. Fig. 8 illustrates the essential features of hydride formation in such a nanostructure highlighting the interface regions. In this case Δ γ represents an average over the different crystallographic orientations of the involved interfaces. As detailed in the Supporting Information, the thermodynamical bias is inversely proportional to d TiH 2 and augments with increasing Ti content according to: (6) δ Δ G 0 = A i n t ⋅ Δ γ = 6 V ‾ TiH 2 d TiH 2 X Ti 100 − X Ti ⋅ Δ γ where V ‾ TiH 2 = 13.30 ⋅ 10 − 6 m 3 is the molar volume of TiH2. The interface area considered is the one between Mg (or MgH2) and TiH2, schematically visualized in yellow in Fig. 8. These models take into account neither homophasic interfaces, such as grain boundaries, nor the outer surfaces of the NPs. These may contribute to an additional bias but our assumption seems justified given the observed dependence on the Ti content. One can therefore convert X Ti into A i n t by means of the microstructure parameters reported in Table S1, considering also the contact between TiH2 crystallites at high X Ti [49], as discussed in the Supporting Information. The interfacial free energy difference Δ γ is then simply obtained by a linear fit of δ Δ G 0 versus A i n t . This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the two extreme temperatures. We obtain Δ γ = ( 0.20 ± 0.02 ) Jm − 2 at T = 150 °C and Δ γ = ( 0.38 ± 0.04 ) at T = 100 °C. These values should be compared with those obtained in MgH2 thin films using Equation (5), for which the authors reported Δ γ ≈ 0.22 Jm − 2 at 150 °C and Δ γ ≈ 0.33 Jm − 2 at 90 °C [26]. The good agreement supports our interpretation that the observed thermodynamical bias in MgH2–TiH2 biphasic NPs originates with interface free energy difference between hydride and metal phase."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, we have proposed the new concept of biphasic nanoparticles for hydrogen storage, in which two bulk-immiscible phases are intimately mixed within single nanoparticles: TiH2 provides catalytic activity for H2 dissociation and recombination as well as paths for accelerated diffusion of atomic hydrogen, whereas MgH2 conveys reversible hydrogen storage capacity under mild pressure/temperature conditions. Differently from previous reports on Mg thin films, we do not make use of Pd catalyst and the morphology is compatible with scale-up. The peculiar nanostructure permits to achieve full absorption (desorption) within tens of seconds (minutes) at the remarkably low temperature of 150 °C, where hydrogen desorption kinetics have never been reported in conventional ball-milled Mg-based nanostructured powders. Moreover, equilibrium data collected in the 100 − 150 °C range reveal a composition-dependent thermodynamics of hydrogen sorption. The thermodynamical bias δ Δ G 0 , a measure of the free energy difference compared to bulk Mg, tends to increase with increasing Ti content X Ti , indicating destabilization of the hydride. In particular, we measure δ Δ G 0 ≈ 4.7 kJ / mol H 2 at T = 100 °C and X Ti = 63 at.%, which corresponds to an increase of the pressure for hydride formation/decomposition by a factor of ≈ 4.5 . This means that, with increasing Ti content, the conditions for hydrogen desorption become more favorable than for bulk Mg. However, this thermodynamic alteration comes at the cost of a reduced gravimetric capacity linked with the high weight fraction of TiH2. We show that a model based on interface - induced destabilization explains well the observed hydrogen sorption thermodynamics. Accordingly, by analyzing the dependence of δ Δ G 0 on composition and microstructure we obtained an interfacial free energy difference Δ γ = 0.38 4 and 0.20 ( 2 ) Jm − 2 at T = 100 and 150 °C, respectively, in excellent agreement with the Δ γ values reported for model 2-dimensional films [26]. The van ‘t Hoff analysis and the temperature dependence of δ Δ G 0 suggest that Δ γ contains an enthalpic and an entropic contribution, the latter partly compensating the destabilization induced by the former. Therefore, further advances in destabilization of MgH2 nanostructures would certainly benefit from a progress in the modelling and engineering of the interfacial entropy. In summary, this work proves that properly designed nanostructures can significantly stretch the temperature/pressure window for fast Mg-based hydrogen sorption toward ambient conditions."
