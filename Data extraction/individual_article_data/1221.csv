0,Introduction,"In recent decades, much research has been done on the optimization of the performance of certain polymeric membranes as molecular sieves [1–12]. The factors controlling the solubility and permeability of small molecules into/through polymeric membranes are now well-understood, a knowledge that can be exploited in the development of novel gas separation, foaming, and plasticization technologies [13]. The diffusion of small molecules through amorphous polymeric solids have been studied theoretically and experimentally to evaluate their permeability and selectivity as functions of a given material’s molecular weight distribution and polymerization rates during the manufacturing process. Pooling this understanding together can subsequently lead to a systematic approach in the optimization of residual monomer and chain oligomers length of a given polymer [14–20]. The transport mechanisms of small molecules in soft materials are amenable to elucidation by MD simulations [3–4,10,21–22]. Such investigations have yielded insight into the dynamics of penetration of small molecules into a polymer matrix in terms of their mutual physical interactions. The random motion of the polymer’s side chains can cause the continual dynamic creation and disappearance of nano-porous interstices or “nano-channels”. This continual random change in the network of available nano-channels can greatly influence the diffusion and local concentrations of small molecules in these nanoporous membranes [3–4,10,21]. MD simulations have been used to explore the phase- and direct-space trajectories of small molecules through the polymer matrix. Where, torques and forces on the adsorbates over several nanoseconds under different thermodynamic conditions can be recorded for further analysis [23–25]. The self-diffusion coefficient of a chemical species represents the limit of the diffusion coefficient at the vanishing gradient of its chemical potential. Thus, the diffusion coefficient Di of the ith small molecule can be evaluated from its self-diffusion coefficient (Ds)i from: (1) D s i = D i ∂ ln C i ∂ ln a i , where Ci is the concentration (expressed as a dimensionless mole fraction) and ai is the activity of the ith species. According to Einstein’s equation in a medium without long-range correlations, the squared displacement of a given molecule from an initial position increases linearly with time [21,26]. It can, hence, be calculated from the limiting slope of the mean-square displacement (MSD) as a function of time [2,19,21]: (2) MSD = 〈 r k → ( t ) - r k → ( 0 ) 2 〉 , where the angular brackets indicate averaging, r k → ( t ) and r k → ( 0 ) are the position vectors of the particle at times = t and 0, respectively. The self-diffusion coefficient of a species is then calculated from ensemble average of its MSD over a sufficiently large simulation time: (3) D s = 1 6 N ∑ k = 1 N lim 1 t 〈 r k → ( t ) - r k → ( 0 ) 2 〉 . In MD simulations, the classical equations of motion are solved to find the trajectories of atoms within the desired time range [23,26–27]. The diffusion of small molecules through polymers has been the subject of numerous MD simulations (see for example Refs. [3–4,10,13,19,21,27–29]). A particularly relevant study to the present work is that of Gusev et al. who focused on the mechanism of diffusion of small molecules and noble gas atoms (He, H2, O2, CH4, Ne, Ar, Kr) in amorphous poly-isobutylene and bisphenol-A polycarbonate [1]. Hofmann et al. have established the usefulness of atomistic MD as a powerful tool for the elucidation of the structure and dynamics of diffusion and transport through dense amorphous polymer membranes [2]. Polymeric matrices that have been explored for the diffusion of small molecules by MD simulations (often in conjunction with experiment) include polycarbonates [6,9,27,30–31], polyesters (such as polyethylene terephthalate) [26,28,32], polyolefins (such as polyethylene and polypropylene) [33–36], silicones (such as polydimethylsiloxane) [11,15,37–38], polyimides [8,10,21,39], and rubber polymers [40]. There appears to be a scarcity of studies reporting MD simulations for molecular diffusion through vinyl polymers [41–42] despite their wide industrial-technological uses. Examples of vinyl polymers include polyvinyl chloride, nitrate, acetate, acetate phthalate, alcohol, and polyvinyl butyral (PVB), to list a few common ones. In this paper, the diffusion of a representative small molecule (H2) and of two monoatomic (rare) gases (He and Ne) through polyvinyl butyral (PVB) is studied using MD simulations at different temperatures. This combination of diffusing species and membrane, up to our knowledge, have never been investigated before, neither by numerical simulations nor by experiment. PVB is prepared from the reaction of polyvinyl alcohol [(-CH2-CHOH-)n] and butyraldehyde (CH3CH2CH2-CHO) [43]. This polymer is widely used industrially as protective coatings for glass (in the production of laminated safety glass), metal and wood, and to improve the impact resistance of glass such as used in automobile windshields [44]. Furthermore, PVB is also used in the ceramics, paint, textile, food, and pulp-and-paper industries. It enhances the strength of the binding, for example, in lithographic and offset printing plates, as a binder transparent matrix in photoactive films, and as a structural adhesive to several surfaces, to mention a few more important applications [45]. While a sizeable literature exists that describes the physical and chemical properties of PVB [43,46], the mechanism of diffusion of small gas molecules and atoms through this polymer, the focus of the present paper, appears to remain largely unexplored. Understanding the mechanism of the diffusion of small species through PVB can eventually contribute to improving its industrial applications. For instance, it may help us limit the inclusion of small atomic/molecular weight impurities during manufacturing to obtain pure PVB of the correct/needed molecular weight difficult or impossible. Another goal of this work is to explore the temperature dependence of the diffusivity of small gas molecules through a PVB membrane which, again, could be invaluable in the design of synthetic conditions that limit the inclusion of small molecules impurities during the synthesis of PVB."
1,MD simulation details,"Fig. 1 shows the general chemical structure of PVB and a ball-and-stick model of the particularly studied PVB monomer in which m = n = p = 1. To simulate the self-diffusion coefficient of gases through PVB polymeric membrane, at first, it is necessary to build a model for the amorphous bulk and match the experimental density of 1.09 ± 0.02 g/cm−3 [47]. Several cubic unit cells with lengths ranging between 20.3 and 34.61 Å containing the polymer chains were generated with a minimum/maximum of 862/4310 atoms. The simulation cells, containing one to five polymer chains at different random conformations, were then energy-minimized. Fig. 2 compares the calculated bulk density for different monomer population per unit cell with the experimentally-measured density. One can see that the computed density converges to the experimental value as the number of monomers in the polymer chain increase. The computed density agrees with the experimental value within the statistical error for the point at the very left of the plot represents the best population of monomers per cell, that is, (0.01) − 1 = 100 monomer/cell. After constructing the model polymer consisting of five chains, each composed of 20 monomers with 4310 atoms, the MD simulations were started after verifying that the bulk density equals the experimental value (to within a precision of ± 0.005 g/cm3) as depicted in Fig. 2. Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) were applied on the parallelepiped to avoid edge effects when simulating the bulk of the polymer. The construction of a simulation cell in a square lattice including PVB model relied on the self-avoiding random-walk procedures [49] within the PySimm [50–51] software package using the DREIDING force field [52]. All simulations were carried out using LAMMPS [53]. Time-steps of 1 fs was taken in the simulations unless otherwise stated. The DREIDING force field [52] has been used to describe all intra and inter-particle interactions in the simulations. The spherical cut-off distance was set to be slightly smaller (by ∼ 0.1 Å) than the half of the simulation cell (which for a cubic cell with a length of 34.61 Å, for example, would place the spherical cut-off distance at 17.2 Å. The Berendsen thermostat and barostat [23,26–27] was used to maintain the temperature and the pressure with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps and 0.1 ps, respectively [3,26]. Following Meunier [54], three different simulation cells containing the polymer chains and four molecules of each studied gases (H2, He, and Ne) were prepared and undergo an energy minimization simulation at 300 K and 1 atm for a simulation time of 1 ns. This represented the initial equilibrium stage. After equilibration, the simulation cell was subjected to an annealing process under a stepwise procedure of NPT runs consisting of five cycles of heating and cooling with steps of 25 K. The temperature extrema of this cycling were 250 and 350 K. Each step was simulated for 100 ps leading to a total simulation time for the annealing process of 4.1 ns. This annealing procedure relax the polymer chains structures to an equilibrium. Once the equilibrium has been reached, the boxes were then relaxed by NPT-MD at T = 248, 273, 298, 313, and 333 K, and P = 1 atm for an additional 3 ns to complete the equilibrium phase of the MD simulations. In the next stage, NVT simulations were performed at 248, 273, 298, 313, and 333 K and 1 atm pressure for 10 ns at each temperature. The time step was set to 3 fs while the SHAKE algorithm [23,26–27] was applied to freeze bond lengths but leaving the bond angles to relax [3]."
2,Results and discussion,"The MSD of hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and neon (Ne) in bulk PVB have been calculated to estimate their self-diffusion coefficients according to Eq. (3). A double-logarithmic plot of MSD versus time with a slope β = 1 is taken as an indicator of a “normal” diffusion mode [2]. Fig. 3 shows the range of “normal diffusion” at different temperatures (248, 273, 298, 313, and 333 K and 1 atm pressure) for the three gases. Table 1 lists the slopes of MSD vs. time plotted in a double-logarithmic scale as depicted in Fig. 3 along with the corresponding Ds [2]. The ranges of time whereby the slope of MSD vs. time is close to unity were chosen for calculating the self-diffusion coefficients (Ds) of gases through the polymer [2–3]. The time-range for normal diffusion of H2, He, and Ne at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 4 . The normal diffusion time-range is defined as the time-range that the gas is undergoing normal diffusion. Generally, molecules undergo ballistic motion before starting their diffusive motion which is dominated by inter-particle collisions. Therefore, the diffusive regime for different molecules has different end-times (not the end of the simulation). The motion could become sub- or super-diffusive outside the normal diffusion time-range [55–57]. From Fig. 4 it can be seen that the normal diffusion time-range for the three gases in the range of T = 248 to 280 K shows a wide-peaked maximum. Fig. 4 also reveals that the normal diffusion time-range of H2 is longer than that of rare gases. The wider region of the H2 diffusivities in Fig. 4 can be related to this molecule’s interaction with the atoms of the PVB matrix. In particular, oxygen atoms in PVB can interact with a guest molecule/atom (H2, He, or Ne), and - as will be shown below - interacts preferentially with hydrogen. The radial distribution function, g(r), is used here as a gauge of the strength of the interaction between the guest and the two types of oxygen atoms in the PVB host. Fig. 5 shows g(r) of the three gases as a function of the distance (r) from the ketonic- and the alcoholic-oxygen atoms of PVB at different temperatures. The plots on the left of Fig. 5 display the radial distribution function for each of the three gases with respect to the ketonic-oxygen of PVB while the plots on the right display the corresponding function but with respect to the alcoholic-oxygen of the polymer. From the plots describing g(r) around the ketonic-oxygen (plots to the left), the first peaks are around 3.0 for Ne, 2.8 for H2, and 2.7 Å for He, with corresponding average heights of ca. 1.7, 1.4, and 1.5, respectively. Thus, the strongest peak in the radial distribution function around the ketonic-oxygen of PVB decreases in the order Ne > He > H2 occurring at smaller distances from the oxygens in the cases of He and H2 compared to Ne. The location and the height of the second broader (and less pronounced) peak in g(r) decreases in the order: Ne > He > H2. The calculated distribution functions also suggest that, in the second shell, H2 is closer to the ketonic-oxygen of PVB, on average, than Ne. This may be interpreted as a stronger long-range interaction of H2 with ketonic-oxygen of PVB than Ne and He. Next, we turn to the interaction of the three gases with the alcoholic-oxygen. The plots to the right in Fig. 5 represent g(r) in the vicinity of that oxygen for Ne, He, and H2, respectively. From these plots, the height of the first peak for these gases decreases from Ne to H2 (around 1.5 for Ne, ∼ 1.4 for He, and ∼ 1.2 for H2). All these peaks, however, have similar distances from the oxygen, hovering around 3 Å. These observations regarding g(r) suggest that hydrogen interacts more strongly with both the ketonic- and the alcoholic-oxygen atoms of PVB than either helium or neon. Neon interacts less than helium with both oxygen atoms of PVB. As a consequence, Ne has the lowest normal diffusion time-range and self-diffusion coefficient. These observations emanating from Fig. 5 can support those drawn from Fig. 4. The small diffuse time-range of Ne in Fig. 4 can be related to the week interaction with the oxygen atoms of PVB, while the reverse argument can be made for the case of the higher diffusivity of H2. Hydrogen has a larger normal diffusion time-range in PVB than either helium and neon, while neon has the smallest. The order of the normal diffusion time-range correlates with the order of self-diffusion coefficients among the three different species. Fig. 6 shows the behavior of Ds as a function of temperature showing that the self-diffusion coefficient of hydrogen is larger than that of the two other gases. This figure also shows that the self-diffusion coefficient is an increasing function of temperature for all three studied gases. Temperature affects hydrogen’s diffusivity the most while its influence on that of neon is negligible within the temperature window that has been examined. Said differently, increasing the temperature cannot increase the self-diffusion coefficient of Ne considerably. The dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient on temperature can shed light on the mechanism of the diffusivity of gases. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient normally follows an Arrhenius-type relation: (4) D s = D 0 exp ( - E a / R T ) where D0 is the pre-exponential coefficient and Ea is an activation energy. Fig. 7 shows the Arrhenius plot of Ds for the three studied gases. The slopes of these plots indicate that the diffusion of these three gases occurs with different mechanisms at low and high temperatures. At low temperatures, these gases tend to diffuse with a hopping mechanism. In contrast, at a high temperature, they adopt a liquid-like diffusion mode [58–60]. In Fig. 7, the slope of the Arrhenius plot decreases slowly for H2 and He but changes rapidly for Ne. Hydrogen and helium have much smaller atomic radii (respectively approx. 0.37 and 0.31 Å), while Neon has the largest (ca. 0.70 Å). Atomic size and temperature appear, hence, to play important roles in governing the mechanism of diffusion while temperature has a more pronounced effect on atoms with a relatively larger size. Fig. 7 also suggests that for small atoms/molecules such as He and H2, the diffusion coefficient is mostly controlled by molecular size rather than by temperature. Consequently, for understanding the mechanisms of guest molecules diffusion in polymeric membranes, both atomic size and temperature should be considered. The self-diffusion coefficient of Ne is not significantly affected by temperature in the studied range of temperatures, but the mechanism of Ne diffusion at low temperatures is primarily through hopping then changes to a predominantly liquid-like behavior at higher temperatures. Meanwhile, both hopping, and liquid-like behavior together underlie the diffusion mechanism of H2 and He in studied temperature-range, where the dominant mechanism is hopping. Two important related other properties, here, are the selectivity and permeability of gasous components inside a membrane such as a PVB polymeric membrane. Gas selectivity calculations have been subjects of plenty of research in the field of membrane science [61–63], including our pervious works [64–66]. The selectivity can be estimated as the ratio of the mole fractions of two components in the adsorbed and bulk phases using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation of a two component system [64–66]. On the other hand, there are sparse investigations on characterization of membrane permeability using MD simulations [67–68]. These studies clearly emphasized that (i) permeability is a non-equilibrium property obtained from Fick’s Law or Flux-Based monitoring methods and that (ii) to calculate permeability, it is necessary to simulate a permeant’s concentration gradient within the membrane. Such simulation techniques are beyond the scope of this paper, nevertheless a qualitative description of permeability can be obtained using obtained RDFs and diffusion coeffients in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Ne can be expected to has the highest selectivity among the three gases due to the strongest interaction with polymeric PVB as shown in Fig. 5. Also, one can assume qualitatively that the permeability of H2 is greater than that of He and of Ne since the former (H2) has the weakest interaction with both the alcoholic- and the ketonic-oxygen atoms of the PVB membrane and larger diffusitivitty. This study has important implications for the use of the PVB membrane approach to improve the permeability of gases."
3,Conclusions,"The diffusion of gases inside amorphous polymers is important since trapped gases can damage the process of polymerization. Furthermore, these organic polymers can combust and produce toxic gases (e.g., F2, CO2, NOx) that can result in suffocation if this happens in a closed area. The radial distribution functions of the three studied gases with respect to alcoholic- and ketonic-oxygen atoms of PVB reveal that (molecular) hydrogen has a stronger interaction than either He or Ne. Self-diffusion coefficient calculations and Arrhenius plots show that, in PVB, Ne has the lowest self-diffusion coefficient while H2 has the highest. Arrhenius plots also indicate that increasing the temperature can alter the mechanism of diffusion of neon without considerably changing its self-diffusion coefficient. The change of temperature cannot affect a change of the mechanism of diffusion of molecular hydrogen and helium; the dominant mechanism of diffusion of both being most likely a hopping mechanism."
