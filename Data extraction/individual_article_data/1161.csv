0,Introduction,"Depletion of the energy sources and increasing the environmental pollution due to the excessive use of fossil fuels can be considered as one of the biggest challenges in the future (Akinbomi et al., 2015). Renewable energy sources including solar, wind, and biomass energy (biohydrogen, biomethane, bioethanol, etc.) are expected to substitute the conventional energy sources i.e. fossil fuels in the near future (Hawkes et al., 2002). Among them, hydrogen has gained more attention because it is clean and environmentally friendly fuel, which produces only water rather than greenhouse gases when combusted (Bakonyi et al., 2013). In addition, the energy mass-based content of hydrogen is higher than other fuels as well as hydrogen can be produced from renewable substrates (Antonopoulou et al., 2008). Several methods have been used to produce biohydrogen such as photo-fermentation, dark fermentation and biophotolysis of water (Antonopoulou et al., 2008). Among them, researchers have given more interest to dark fermentation because the process can be conducted in absence of light e.g. low energy consumption under ambient temperature and pressure as well as it can produce valuable products i.e. H2, CH4, etc., from waste substrates (Mohan et al., 2008). However, the main drawback of dark fermentation is the low hydrogen yield as maximum 33% of the electrons in the substrate can be converted into H2, with 66% of the substrate electrons form soluble liquid metabolites (SLM) such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohol, etc. (Akinbomi et al., 2015; Bakonyi et al., 2018; Jung et al., 2012). In order to increase the total energy recovery and reduce the organic content, the H2 fermented effluent should be further utilized in photo-fermentation, CH4 production and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) (Jung et al., 2012). In the recent years, two-stage fermentation for H2 and CH4 production has been proposed as a promising method to post-treat the H2 fermented effluent and increase the total energy value of the process (Chu and Wang, 2017). During the two-stage process, hydrogen is produced in the first stage i.e. acidogenesis, then the liquid effluent of the H2 fermentation is used as feedstock for CH4 production in the second stage i.e. methanogenesis (Bakonyi et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2011). The effluent of the H2 dark fermentation contains high volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentrations including acetic acid, butyric acid, etc. (Algapani et al., 2018). Two-stage process for H2 and CH4 production has been widely investigated in previous works using various substrates and different operating conditions (Antonopoulou et al., 2008; Chu and Wang, 2017; Park et al., 2010). The authors reported that the major obstacle of the H2/CH4 combined system is the low H2 and CH4 yields especially when agricultural residues are used as feedstock. This behavior may be due to the complex structure of the lignocellulosic matrix that can reduce the hydrolysis of the waste substrates (Monlau et al., 2015). Authors reported that application of pre-treatment methods such as acid, alkaline, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), aerobic pre-treatment, etc., showed positive impact on the efficiency of the anaerobic digestion (Cheng et al., 2015; Monlau et al., 2015; Rafieenia et al., 2017). These pre-treatments are required to improve the biodegradability of the substrates and thus increase the H2 and CH4 yields (Pakarinen et al., 2009). For instance, Khatri et al. (2015) found that the methane yield increased from 302.81 mL-CH4/g-VS using untreated maize straw to 313.35 and 370.99 mL-CH4/g-VS when 4% and 6% NaOH pre-treated maize straw were used. Zhang et al. (2015) reported methane yield of 288 mL-CH4/g-VS using 3% NaOH pre-treated rice straw compared to 187 mL-CH4/g-VS for untreated rice straw. Cesaro and Belgiorno (2013) found that the biogas volume increased by 37% using ozonation pre-treated solid organic waste (0.16 g O3/g TS ozone dosage) compared to the untreated substrate. However, few studies have considered the effect of pre-treatment on two-stage process for H2 and CH4 production so far and most of the studies have been conducted in batch assays. Therefore, more investigations are required to study the long-term H2 and CH4 production from pre-treated wastes. Such investigations are necessary to assess the long-term operation before application in industry and provide data about the energy and economical assessments (Monlau et al., 2015). In a previous study, the effect of pre-treatment methods including thermal, alkaline, acid, H2O2, ultrasonication alone or in combination on biohydrogen production from potatoes and bean wastes was investigated in batch tests. Higher biohydrogen production was obtained using pre-treated wastes than the control tests. Thermal, ultrasonic pre-treatments did not show a great impact on the biohydrogen production, while alkaline, acid and H2O2 pre-treatments showed a significant influence on biohydrogen production. In addition, continuous biohydrogen production from organic wastes (sucrose, potatoes and bean wastes) was studied at different hydraulic retention time (HRT), of 24, 18 and 12 h. In case of potatoes and bean wastes, optimum hydrogen yields were observed at high HRT (Salem et al., 2018). However, it was observed that the removal efficiency of hydrogen fermentation was not high and the H2 fermented effluent was rich in VFAs that could be used in a subsequent step. Based on the findings of the previous study and the scarce of the research studies that considered the effect of pre-treatment on continuous hydrogen and methane production, the main objectives of the present study are: (a) investigating the effect of pre-treatment methods (alkaline, acid and H2O2) on bio-hydrogen and bio-methane production using potatoes and bean wastes, (b) analyzing the process parameters such as hydrogen and methane production (yield), VFAs concentration, etc., and (c) evaluation of the energy production efficiency in one-stage system for H2 production and two-stage process for H2 and CH4 production using raw (or pre-treated) wastes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The inoculum used in bio-hydrogen production experiments was obtained from Kasslerfeld wastewater treatment plant (Duisburg, Germany), and sieved through a mesh (2 mm) to remove waste materials. Thermal pre-treatment (at 100 °C for two hours) was applied on the bacterial species before inoculation to gather the hydrogen-producing bacteria such as Clostridium species as well as inhibit the activity of the hydrogen-consuming species e.g. methanogens and other non H2-producing microorganisms. The heat-shock pre-treatment has been recognized as simple, effective and fast process compared to other inoculum pre-treatment methods such as chemical, acid/base, etc. (Bakonyi et al., 2014). For methane production, the sludge was collected from lab-scale continuous stirring tank reactor (CSTR). The CSTR was operated at HRT of 25 d for methane production from sewage sludge."
3,Feedstock preparation and characterization,"2.2 Feedstock preparation and characterization The wastewaters were prepared as reported previously (Salem et al., 2018). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the feedstock substrates before and after the pre-treatment. The experimental results presented are the average measurements performed throughout the operation of the bioreactors. Three different pre-treatment methods as alkaline, acid and H2O2 were studied. The pre-treatment processes were performed as reported previously (Salem et al., 2018). The bioreactors were operated at feed and drain mode using peristaltic pumps. A nutritional solution was used as mentioned in previous work (Salem et al., 2017)."
4,Experimental procedures,"2.3 Experimental procedures Two parallel CSTRs (active volume of 4 L) were used for biohydrogen production; the bioreactors were operated at HRT of 24 h and continuously mixed at 150 rpm. pH–control was used to maintain the pH at 5.5 by addition of 2 M NaOH and/or 4 M HCl according to the system requirements (iks Aquastar version 2.XX, iks Computer System GmbH, Germany). The feedstock tanks were continuously mixed to avoid sedimentation of the particles. The effluents from the H2-producing bioreactors were collected in sedimentation tanks, and then were pumped into the CH4-producing bioreactors. Methane was produced in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactors (UASB). Two bioreactors: UASB-1, inner diameter 22 cm and height 140 cm, and UASB-2, inner diameter 24 cm and height 81 cm, with working volumes of 47.5 and 34 L, were operated at HRT of 13.6 and 12.1 d using H2 fermented potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. The experiments were performed at mesophilic temperature of 35 °C by circulating water in the jacket of the bioreactors connected to water bath. The schematic diagram for the H2 and CH4 production fermenters is shown in Fig. 1 ."
5,Analytical procedures,"2.4 Analytical procedures Total solids (TS), soluble solids (SS), volatile solids (VS) and VFAs concentrations were measured. VFAs concentration was estimated using commercial cuvettes (Dr. Lange, Hach Co., Germany). TS, SS and VS concentrations were measured as mentioned in the standard methods (APHA, 1998). The biogas production from H2-CSTR and CH4-UASB bioreactors was measured every day using gas meter (Ritter, Apparatebau, Germany), and collected in aluminum gas bags. Analysis of the biogas composition for H2 was performed using gas analyzer as described previously (Salem et al., 2017). Methane-based biogas was analyzed for CH4, CO2, H2S and O2 using portable biogas 5000 gas analyzer (Geotech, Geotechnical Instruments (UK) Ltd, England). CH4 is measured using dual beam infrared absorption, carbon dioxide is measured by infrared absorption at a wavelength specific to carbon dioxide and O2 concentration is determined using galvanic cell type sensor. The microstructure of the microbial species was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Quanta 400 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; FEI) at standard high vacuum conditions. A K-550 sputter coater (Emitech, U.K.) was used to coat the outer surface of the sample with gold for 0.5 min. Before characterization, the samples were prepared as reported in literature (Fang, 2000)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the waste,"3.1 Characterization of the waste Table 1 shows the effect of pre-treatment on the average properties of the waste substrates. It can be stated that the treated wastes showed higher solubilization than the raw substrates. H2O2 pre-treatment exhibited the highest effect on both substrates, where the increase in the VS (soluble) concentration was 33.26% and 19.89% for potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. Alkaline and acid pre-treatments showed less effect of 20.78% and 26.18% for potatoes wastes, and 11.09% and 14.74% for bean wastes, respectively. These findings are in accordance with previous works (Ding et al., 2017; Monlau et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2010). Furthermore, it was noted that the effect of pre-treatment was higher in case of potatoes wastes than the corresponding effect showed in case of bean wastes. This could have a relation to the carbohydrate content, where the substrate with high carbohydrate content (potatoes wastes) hydrolyzes faster than low carbohydrate content substrates (bean wastes). Previous works reported similar trends (Rafieenia et al., 2017). According to Lay et al. (2003), the presence of considerable protein content could alter the effect of pre-treatment on the raw substrates."
8,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production The results presented in this study are the average values obtained after reaching steady state conditions. Figs. 2 and 3 show the effect of pre-treatments on biohydrogen production: (a) hydrogen production rate (HPR), and (b) hydrogen yield (amount of hydrogen gas produced per gram total volatile solids e.g. TVS), from potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. The HPR was dependent on the pre-treatment methods. It was noted that the average HPR varied as 2.07 ± 0.62, 2.63 ± 0.79 and 3.42 ± 1.11 L/L.d, corresponding to alkaline, acid and H2O2 pre-treated potatoes wastes, respectively, higher than 1.01 ± 0.31 L/L.d measured in the control bioreactor using untreated potatoes wastes (Fig. 2a). These results are comparable to those reported in literature for food waste i.e. 2.7 L/L.d (Algapani et al., 2018). The same behavior was observed in case of bean wastes. The highest biohydrogen production of 1.88 ± 0.53 L/L.d was obtained using H2O2 pre-treated samples compared to 1.49 ± 0.47, 1.24 ± 0.41 and 0.75 ± 0.19 L/L.d, measured when acid, alkaline pre-treated and raw bean wastes were used, respectively (Fig. 3a). The high biohydrogen production observed using H2O2 pre-treatment could be explained by the fact that H2O2 is a strong oxidizing agent to delignate the agricultural residues and their decomposition produces highly oxidizing species (hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals). These oxidizing species could facilitate the degradation of the lignin and/or hemicellulose (Han et al., 2012). In addition, the reactions that occur during the H2O2 pre-treatment such as electrophilic substitution, displacement of side chains, cleavage of alkyl aryl ether linkages or the oxidative cleavage of aromatic nuclei may remove hemicellulose and lignin as well as increase the accessibility of the cellulose (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009). Similar trends were found in literature (Han et al., 2012; Salem et al., 2018). Likewise, the hydrogen yield increased by application of the pre-treatment. In case of potatoes wastes, average hydrogen yields of 252.7, 163.2 and 126.4 mL-H2/g-TVS, corresponding to H2O2, acid and alkaline pre-treated wastes, respectively, were achieved higher than 58.7 mL-H2/g-TVS measured in the control reactor as shown in Fig. 2b. Average hydrogen yield of 53.3 mL-H2/g-TVS was measured in the reactor fed with raw bean wastes. The hydrogen yield increased to 93.0, 118.6 and 152.1 mL-H2/g-TVS for alkaline, acid and H2O2 pre-treated bean wastes, respectively as given in Fig. 3b. The enhancement of hydrogen yield might be due to increasing the solubilization of the waste as a result of destruction of the ligno-cellulosic structure as well as conversion of the high molecular weight carbohydrates into small ones (glucose, xylose, etc.), which may facilitate their fermentation by hydrogen-producers (Cheng et al., 2015). Chu et al. (2012) achieved hydrogen yields of 85 and 20 mL-H2/g-VS for untreated potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. In other study, average hydrogen yield of 65 mL-H2/g-VS using untreated food waste was obtained (Wang and Zhao, 2009). The results achieved in the above studies are comparable to the yields obtained in the current study using untreated wastes but lower than the yields measured in case of pre-treated wastes. According to Xie et al. (2008), the hydrogen yield increased by application of amylase and glucoamylase pre-treatments and hydrogen yield of 200.4–271.2 mL-H/g-VS was obtained in batch experiments. The yields achieved in this study are lower than 120.0–497.0 mL-H2/g-VS for pre-treated potatoes wastes and 97.0–265.0 mL-H2/g-VS for pre-treated bean wastes obtained in the previous work (Salem et al., 2018). Although, all the studied pre-treatment methods showed enhancing effect on biohydrogen production, H2O2 pre-treatment was more effective than alkaline and acid pre-treatments. In case of potatoes wastes, the hydrogen yield achieved using H2O2 pre-treatment was 35.4% and 49.9%, higher than the yield measured in case of acid and alkaline pre-treatment, respectively. The hydrogen yield in case of H2O2 pre-treated bean wastes was 22.0% and 38.8%, higher than the yield measured using acid, alkaline pre-treated wastes, respectively. In both substrates, the best yield was achieved using H2O2 pre-treatment, while NaOH pre-treated wastes showed less yields. The low yield measured using NaOH pre-treated wastes compared to the yields obtained using HCl and H2O2 pre-treated wastes can be due to NaOH pre-treatment was less effective than HCl and H2O2 pre-treatments for solubilization the organic wastes (Kim and Lee, 2010). These findings are in accordance with previous works (Han et al., 2012; Kim and Lee, 2010; Salem et al., 2018). Several authors reported that the pre-treatment increased H2 production in H2/CH4 system. Cheng et al. (2015) used microwave (steam)-heated acid pretreatment methods combined with enzymolysis in the study conducted to investigate the hydrogen and methane production from cassava residues. In the above study, the hydrogen yield was 102.1 (steam-heated acid pre-treatment), and 106.2 (microwave-heated acid pre-treatment) mL-H2/g-TVS higher than 10.0 mL-H2/g-TVS obtained from raw cassava test. Ding et al. (2017) found that application of hydrothermal pre-treatment (increasing the pre-treatment temperature from 100 to 140 °C), increased the hydrogen yield and peak yield of 43.0 mL/g-VS was reported higher than 34.7 mL/g-VS achieved using untreated food waste. However, the hydrogen yield decreased to 25.4 mL/g-VS with further increase in the pre-treatment temperature from 140 to 200 °C. In other study, it has been reported that application of alkaline pre-treatment did not show enhancing effect on biohydrogen production from sunflower stalks (Monlau et al., 2015). On the other hand, Rafieenia et al. (2017) found that application of aerobic pre-treatment showed a negative effect on biohydrogen production from food waste. In the above work, the aerated samples showed hydrogen yields of 44.4, 21.0 and 5.27 mL/g-VS lower than the results obtained using raw carbohydrate rich, lipid rich and protein rich food waste of 55.31, 27.93 and 7.96 mL/g-VS, respectively. The average hydrogen concentration was in the range of 42.9–47.8% and 43.8–45.5% for potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. These results are comparable to the results reported in literature (Kim and Lee, 2010; Salem et al., 2018). Methane was not detected and the balance was CO2."
9,Methane production,"3.3 Methane production In this section, the effect of pre-treatment on the second CH4 production stage compared to the corresponding results achieved using raw waste is discussed. The pre-treatment of organic residues showed similar enhancing effect on methane production as presented in Table 2 . The average methane production rate (MRP) increased from 0.620 ± 0.20 L/L.d using raw potatoes wastes to 1.205 ± 0.41, 1.244 ± 0.83 and 1.892 ± 1.29 L/L.d for alkaline, acid and H2O2 pre-treated potatoes wastes, respectively. Analogous behavior was observed for bean wastes. Average MPR of 0.403 ± 0.11 L/L.d was measured for untreated bean wastes. The MPR increased to 0.713 ± 0.15, 0.822 ± 0.50 and 1.207 ± 0.23 L/L.d by application of alkaline, acid and H2O2 pre-treatment on bean wastes before conduction of the H2 production experiments, respectively. These results are consistent with 1.3–1.8 L/L.d (Luo et al., 2011). Enhancing the bio-methane production in the combined system may be due to increasing the VFAs concentration from the first stage reactors available for the methane-producing species (Cheng et al., 2015). Similarly, the methane yield increased by application of the different pre-treatment methods. The methane yield increased from 198.6 mL-CH4/g-TVS for untreated potatoes wastes to 322.9, 402.8 and 507.1 mL-CH4/g-TVS using alkaline, acid and H2O2 pre-treatment, respectively. In case of raw bean wastes, the methane yield was 124.3 mL-CH4/g-TVS. Alkaline, acid and H2O2 pre-treated bean wastes showed methane yields of 284.3, 341.0 and 462.6 mL-CH4/g-TVS, respectively. The high methane yield achieved in this study especially in case of using H2O2 pre-treatment may be due to the strong oxidation power of H2O2 which can accelerate the hydrolysis producing high concentrations of COD and VFAs as well as undissociated oxidizing species during the pre-treatment process may increase the methane yield (Katukuri et al., 2017). The methane yields are comparable to 456.0–536.0 mL/g-VS (Algapani et al., 2018), 459.9–647.5 mL/g-VS (Ariunbaatar et al., 2014), 511.6 mL/g-VS (Ding et al., 2017), and lower than 817.0 mL/g-VS (Yin et al., 2016). Similar enhancing effect of pre-treatment on methane production in H2/CH4 system was reported by other authors. Monlau et al. (2015) found that the methane yield increased by application of alkaline pre-treatment and the authors reported maximum methane yield of 196 mL/g-VS. Zhu et al. (2008) reported average methane yield of 507.3 mL-CH4/g-VS with maximum value of 672.9 mL-CH4/g-VS in the study conducted for H2/CH4 production from thermally pre-treated potatoes wastes. Cheng et al. (2015) reported that the methane yield from the H2 fermentation production effluent increased to 93.2 and 75.4 mL-CH4/g-TVS by application of steam and microwave -heated acid pre-treated cassava, respectively. Ding et al. (2017) found that increasing the pre-treatment temperature from 100 to 140 °C increased the methane yield with a maximum yield of 511.6 mL/g-VS achieved at pre-treatment temperature of 140 °C compared to 387.9 mL/g-VS measured in case of untreated waste. However, further increase to 160–200 °C decreased the methane yield. In contrast, Pakarinen et al. (2009) showed that the CH4 yield was negatively affected by application of NaOH pre-treatment in a combined system for H2 and CH4 production from grass silage. In the above study, methane yield of 334 mL/g-VS for pre-treated grass silage lower than 430 mL/g-VS for untreated substrate was achieved. Other author reported that the effect of pre-treatment may be varied depending on the waste composition (Rafieenia et al., 2017). They found that application of aerobic pre-treatment increased the methane yield using carbohydrate and protein rich food waste. But, non-aerated (raw) lipid rich food waste showed higher methane yield than the aerated (pre-treated) sample. The average methane concentration ranged between 68.0 and 72.9% and 53.9–63.0% for potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. These results are higher than 50.66 ± 2.86% (Chu and Wang, 2017), and 52.5–58.0% (Monlau et al., 2015). Comparable results of 55–73% (Xie et al., 2008), and 68% (Buitrón et al., 2014) cited in literature. Zhu et al. (2008) reported higher methane concentration of 69–8% with average value of 76%. Hydrogen was detected during the first operation days with concentration of 1.4–5.5%, and H2S (8–200 ppm) was measured. It can be seen that there is no agreement on the effect of pre-treatment on two-stage process for H2 and CH4 production. Some authors reported that application of the pre-treatment showed positive effect on both hydrogen and methane productions (Cheng et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2008), which is in agreement with this study. Other researchers showed that the pre-treatment may have enhancing effect on one stage (H2 or CH4), while the other stage may be inhibited (Pakarinen et al., 2009; Rafieenia et al., 2017). This behavior could be explained by the fact that the pre-treatment depends on the concentration and/or type of the oxidizing agent (HCl, NaOH or H2O2). The concentration of the oxidizing agents should be optimized because higher concentrations than optimal values may lead to the production of inhibitors (Han et al., 2012; Monlau et al., 2015). In addition, the concentration of the soluble sugars in the waste could have a direct impact on the bio-H2 production using mixed inoculum (Monlau et al., 2012). Several parameters including temperature, pH, C/N ratio, pre-treatment reagent, inhibiting compounds, composition and concentration of the VFAs, type of reactor, organic loading rate, HRT, etc. must be optimized during the methanogenic stage (Khan et al., 2016; Kwietniewska and Tys, 2014). Therefore, optimization of the pre-treatment effect on combined H2 and CH4 production must be considered in further studies. Although high yields have been achieved in the current study, some operational issues must be taken into account in future works to improve the process efficiency and reduce the operational cost. Recycling of the effluent either the H2 fermented effluent or the CH4 fermented final effluent should be considered. Authors reported that effluent recycling can increase the biohydrogen production because it provides sufficient buffering capacity, reduces the NaOH consumption and avoids the loss of the biomass (Chen et al., 2012). In addition, the washout of the bacterial species was another operational issue of the CTSR that could lead to instable hydrogen production. Researchers found that cell immobilization may represent an efficient solution to avoid the biomass removal and run the bioreactors with high biomass concentration even short HRT was used (Kumar et al., 2013)."
10,Performance of the bioreactors and production of VFAs in H2 and CH4-producing bioreactors,"3.4 Performance of the bioreactors and production of VFAs in H2 and CH4-producing bioreactors Combining the H2 and CH4 bioreactors increased the efficiency of the fermentation process. The TVS degradations of one-stage for biohydrogen production from potatoes and bean wastes were 20.2–58.9% and 18.8–47.6%, respectively. The removal efficiencies increased to 91.9–94.0% and 84.4–88.0% at the end of two-stage (H2/CH4) fermentation for potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. This behavior reflects higher utilization of the substrates in two-stage process than one-stage system. The production of VFAs in H2- and CH4-producing reactors is shown in Table 3 . The VFAs concentrations of the raw potatoes and bean wastes are 409 and 208 mg/L, respectively. At the end of H2-fermentation, the average VFAs concentration ranged between 2272 and 3182 mg/L, and 2041–2526 mg/L for potatoes and bean wastes, respectively. Application of the pre-treatment did not only increase the methane production but also reduced the accumulation of the VFAs in the CH4-producing bioreactor. In case of potatoes wastes, the VFAs concentration ranged between 54.4 and 126 mg/L (pre-treated), lower than 133 mg/L measured in case of raw substrate. For pre-treated bean wastes, the average VFAs concentration in the final effluent was 52.1–135 mg/L compared to 178 mg/L measured in case of raw bean wastes. Previous investigations reported similar trends (Rafieenia et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2007)."
11,Calculation of the total energy yield from waste substrates,"3.5 Calculation of the total energy yield from waste substrates Table 4 shows the average energy yield values of the raw and pre-treated substrates using the heating values of 120 and 50.0 kJ/g for hydrogen and methane, respectively (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Though the hydrogen production increased by application of the pre-treatment methods, hydrogen production from potatoes and bean wastes represented only 7.90–13.1% and 8.90–11.4%, of the total energy produced from the combined system, respectively. The highest energy yields of 5.13 and 4.47 kW h/kg-TVS were observed using H2O2 pre-treated potatoes and bean wastes, representing 63.2% and 72.4% higher than the non-treated samples, respectively. Therefore, it can be stated that combining CH4 reactor with H2 reactor showed a great positive impact on increasing the energy efficiency using both substrates, indicating the success of the combined system. Similar trends were reported in literature (Cheng et al., 2015; Rafieenia et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008)."
12,Conclusion,"In the current study, three pre-treatment methods as alkaline, acid and H2O2 were studied to increase the H2 and CH4 production using potatoes and bean wastes. It was found that all the studied pre-treatment techniques showed enhancing effect on H2 and CH4 production from wastes. The best hydrogen and methane yields of 252.7 mL-H2/g-TVS and 507.1 mL-CH4/g-TVS (potatoes wastes), and 152.1 mL-H2/g-TVS and 462.6 mL-CH4/g-TVS (bean wastes), respectively, were observed using H2O2 pre-treatment. NaOH pre-treatment showed the lowest enhancing effect compared to acid and H2O2 pre-treatment. The total energy yield increased by combining H2 and CH4 two-stage fermentation system."
