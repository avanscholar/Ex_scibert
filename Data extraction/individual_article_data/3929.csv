0,Introduction,"As more attention is paid to new hydrogen (H2) energy for its high heat value (142.35kJg−1) and because only water produced by combustion [1], many researchers have studied its production. There has been some success in producing H2 fermentatively, from simple substrates such as glucose, monosaccharides, some well defined polysaccharide substances such as starch and cellulose [2–4] and some more complex and heterogeneous such as wastewater. But relatively low H2 production and content from dark bacterial H2 fermentations has been observed. Mohan's [5] used designed synthetic wastewater as substrate and a closed loop to recirculate the substrate between two-phase reactors to produce H2 and CH4. After 60 days the COD removal efficiency was only 36.6% in the first phase. Xie used heat-shocked sludge and improved substrate, in which Cl− was substituted for SO4 2− to produce H2 and CH4, and obtained 43.0–69.0% H2 content in the biogas [6]. Cooney et al. used a glucose–yeast extract–peptone medium as substrate to produce H2 and CH4. The H2 content obtained was only 30.7–38.0% [7]. To increase H2 production and limit accumulation of VFAs, the most effective method is pretreatment of inoculum sludge to prevent CH4 production and inhibit the activity of hydrogen-consuming bacteria [8]. There have been many reports on pretreatment methods including acid, alkali, heat, ultrasonic, chemistry treatment [9,10] and combined treatment [11]. The first three methods are considered to be more effective. In the second method methanogenesis is suppressed and the fermentation substrate is substantially diluted [6]. However, these methods resulted in poor duration of H2 production, incomplete degradation of organic matter, and more difficult and expensive subsequent treatment of substrate effluent. So, a two-phase fermentation, which can produce organic acids, H2 and CO2 in the first phase, and CH4 and CO2 in the second phase [12] has been studied as the best method to settle these questions. During the anaerobic fermentation reactor, VFAs are the important mid-productions. Most of the CH4 produced in conventional anaerobic digesters is derived from VFAs such as acetic acid (HAc) and butyric acid (HBu). It is known that the H2 and CH4 productions are affected greatly by degradation pathway of substrate, so there are many researches are developing about it. As shown in many studies, the conversion rates of VFAs to CH4 vary in the order of HAc>ethanol (HEt)>HBu>propionic acid (HPr) [13]. Before being degraded to CH4, all VFAs are first degraded to HAc, and their conversion rates also vary in the order of HEt>HBu>HPr. Therefore, accumulation of HPr always results in failure of methanogenesis [14]. Siegert and Banks [15] considered that VFA concentrations above 2.0gL−1 led to inhibition of cellulose degradation, while VFA concentrations above 4.0gL−1 caused only feeble inhibition of glucose degradation. Hajarnis [16] found that when the pH was 7 and the HPr concentration was 5.0gL−1, the CH4 production decreased to 22.0–38.0%. Similarly Palmisano [17] reported inhibition when VFAs concentrations were above 10.0gL−1. In the present study, the swine manure used as fermentation substrate, two-phase anaerobic fermentation was used to study the effects of pretreatment methods on gas production, using H2 and CH4 production and their proportions as indexes to choose optimal methods. The relationship of HAc, HPr and HBu production, total VFA concentrations, and H2 and CH4 production was analyzed to study the gas production mechanism. The conditions in the first phase were suitable for H2 production targeted to industrial scale high-efficiency and low-cost production. The residue from the first phase was re-used to produce traditional fuel-methane."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental design,"2.1 Experimental design Seven fermentation experiments were performed during this study according to the reactor design shown as Fig. 1 . All experiments, with 1L fermentation bottle, were inoculated with 80.0g digester sludge (see Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and fed 121.5g additional swine manure as substrate in the first phase. Then the mixture was diluted to 500ml (the COD concentration was about 12.3–13.0gL−1) and the pH was adjusted to 6.2 to produce H2. Simultaneously, 100.0g sludge with no pretreatment was contained in the fermentation bottle of the second phase to produce CH4. After H2 production terminated, 400ml effluent from the first phase, with pH adjusted to 7.0, was used as feedstock for the second phase to produce CH4. The two bottles were flushed with nitrogen for 30s to remove oxygen from the headspace and maintain an anaerobic environment. They were then capped with rubber stoppers and put into a heated water jacket connected to a thermostatically controlled flow heater, and measurement of gas production commenced. To minimize random error three experiments were carried out in parallel, and average values determined for each set of parallel experiments. The biogas samples in the first phase and the second phase were taken at intervals of 6 and 24h, respectively, and the liquor samples were taken at 6 and 48h intervals, respectively."
3,Inoculum and substrate,"2.2 Inoculum and substrate The inoculum sludge was taken from an anaerobic digester operated for two years, then filtered using a 0.0469inch sieve. The filtrate was put into an incubator and cultivated for two months with constant feed of swine manure, at COD 5.0gL−1 d−1, hydraulic retention time (HRT) 48h and temperature 35±1°C. Several minerals were added to the culture to meet the requirement for microbial growth: 1.50g KH2PO4, 2.00g (NH4)2SO4, 0.10g FeCl2, 0.10g MnCl2·6H2O, 0.05g ZnCl2, 0.10g CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01g Na2MoO4, 0.20g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01g AlK(SO4)2 and 0.01g NiCl2·6H2O, in 1L of substrate. After being deposited and concentrated, the cultivated sludge was used as inoculum. The TS (total solid) and VS (volatile solid) values of the sludge were 8.18% and 4.37% respectively. The substrate was fresh swine manure taken from a piggery, with TS 28.44%, CODcr 52.0mgg−1, TP 3.4mgg−1, TN 5.9mgg−1 and pH 6.96."
4,Sludge pretreatment methods,"2.3 Sludge pretreatment methods The inoculum sludge in experiment 1 was not-pretreated. The sludges in experiments 2 and 3 were heat-treated at 80°C with a heated water jacket for 15 and 30min, respectively. The sludge in experiments 4 and 5 was alkali-pretreated with pH regulated to 10 and11, respectively. The sludge in experiments 6 and 7 was acid pretreated, and the pH regulated to 3 and 4, respectively. In alkali or acid pretreatment, the pH was regulated using 1molL−1 NaOH or HCl solution. It was then adjusted to neutral after 3h using 1molL−1 HCl or NaOH solution (Table 1 )."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The biogas contents of the reactor headspace were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC-900C, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 1.5m stainless-steel column packed with 5Å molecular sieve. The temperatures of the injector, detector and column were maintained at 100, 140 and 80°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mlmin−1. The concentrations of ethanol and VFAs, including acetate, propionate and butyrate in the substrate liquid were determined with the same gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and Nukol free fatty acid phase fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP, 30m×0.32mm×0.25μm). The liquid samples were first centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 10min, then acidified with formic acid and filtered through a 0.45μm membrane, and finally measured for free acids. The operating temperatures of the injector, detector and column were 200, 220 and 180°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 3.0mlmin−1. The sample injection volume was 1.0μL. The volume of biogas produced was recorded using water displacement equipment. pH was measured using a PHS-25 (Shanghai Hongyi Instrumentation Factory, China) acidity meter. COD, TN, TP, TS and VS were determined according to the standard methods [18]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production and accumulation of VFAs,"3.1 Hydrogen production and accumulation of VFAs The H2 production fermentation lasted for 120–144h (Fig. 2 (a)) and the H2 productivity of sludge was enhanced by pretreatment. Experiment 3 gave the highest H2 production and production rate of 1265.6ml, 36.6ml (g TS)added −1, respectively, which was 77.4% higher than the production from experiment 1(20.6ml (g TS)added −1). The H2 productions from experiments 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were 56.7, 37.4, 41.2, 35.4 and 22.3% higher, respectively, than from experiment 1. Thus to improve H2 productivity of sludge the order of effectiveness of pretreatment methods was found to be heat treatment>alkali treatment>acid treatment. This is consistent with the findings of many researchers who reported that it is necessary to inactivate hydrogenotrophic methanogens in sewage sludge prior to using it as an inoculum. As shown in Fig. 2(a), H2 production rate increased first and decreased sharply after 72–96h. Considering H2 production rate and efficiency, an appropriate fermentation period for H2 production is between 72 and 96h. Fig. 2(b) and (c) showed that H2 content was the lowest and fluctuated between 11.0 and 55.0% in experiment 1. The average H2 and CH4 contents were 46.6 and 9.9%, respectively, in the first 72h. However, the H2 content fell to 19.2% and the CH4 increased sharply to 39.0% on the 4th day. The reason is that there are many methanogenic bacteria in inoculum sludge, which was not-pretreated in experiment 1, and the VFAs with high concentration produced in the experiment inhibit the activity of acidogenic bacteria. These fluctuation phenomena appeared faintly in other experiments with the average H2, CH4 contents of 65.2% and 2.7%, respectively, in the first 72h because methanogenic bacteria were destroyed after the sludge was pretreated. The highest H2 content appeared in experiments 3 and 2 with average values 64.9 and 64.5%, respectively, in the first 72h, with only 0.9% of CH4. After the first phase fermentation, the COD value dropped to 9.7–10.7gL−1, and the removal rate was only 14.0–16.2%, so the post treatment of fermentation residua is needed. VFAs and alcohols are the main aqueous products in the H2 production reactor [19]. In this experiment the HEt production was not taken into account because it was very low (480–730mgL−1). This observation is similar to that in Shin and Youn's report [20], where the highest HEt concentration was 634mgL−1. Figs. 2 and 3 showed that the cumulative HAc and HBu productions had a similar increasing trend to that of H2 production. With H2 production the VFA concentrations increased (Fig. 3(a)), in accordance with the results of Antonopoulou's report [21]. However VFA with high concentration can inhibit H2 production. As shown in Fig. 3, when the cumulative HAc and HBu and the total VFA concentrations in the first 72h reached 3524, 2430 and 8770mgL−1 in all experiments, the average H2 production rate and H2 content decreased from 49.7mld−1(g VS)−1and 55.3% to 18.7mld−1(g VS)−1 and 43.2%, respectively. HPr concentration increased slowly during this time. Except for experiment 1, HPr concentrations in other experiments were below 2850mgL−1, however they increased rapidly to 3970–4500mgL−1 after 72h with the H2 production falling dramatically. This result corresponded with the fermentation theory that HPr fermentation type exhibited low H2 production capability [22]. This means that VFAs production can rapidly decrease pH, then change the fermentation pathways and end-products, which lead to different H2 productions. Furthermore, higher HPr concentration seriously inhibited the activity of acidogenic bacteria, as reported by several researchers [23,24]. As shown in Table 2 , data analysis using the SPSS software indicated that the H2 production had a positive correlation with HEt and HBu productions and a negative correlation with HPr production in all experiments. H2 production in experiments 3, 2, 5 is higher and it had a higher positive partial correlation (P <0.01) with HEt and HBu productions and higher partial correlation negative with HPr production while it had no significant correlation with HEt and HBu productions and lower partial correlation with HPr production in other experiments. H2 production was lower and had insignificant correlation coefficients with HEt and HBu production in experiments 1 and 7. These data analysis indicated that H2 production was enhanced by the process of HEt and HBu production and inhibited by the process of HPr production, which is accordance with the reaction equations of organic compounds degradation under anaerobic fermentation condition. But the effect of one kind of VFAs on H2 production is affected by others, and their interactions should be studied further."
8,Methane production and accumulation of VFA,"3.2 Methane production and accumulation of VFA The effluent from the first phase was fed to the second phase to produce CH4. As shown in Fig. 4 , the fermentation period last for 21–23 days. In the first 3d, experiment 1 gave the highest production of CH4. From the 4th day, except for experiments 6 and 7 the cumulative CH4 productions of other experiments were higher than for experiment 1. The effluent from the reactor with inoculum sludge that had been heat-treated in the first phase had a maximum specific production rate of 199.9–201.7mld−1 (g TS)added −1 and the highest CH4 productivity of 6909.9 and 6986.5ml from experiments 2 and 3, respectively, which were 16.8% and 18.1% higher, respectively than from experiment 1. The CH4 productions from experiments 4 and 5 (alkali pretreatment), 6 and 7 (acid pretreatment) were 5970.2, 5973.5, 5714.2 and 5631.2ml, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(b), there are indistinctive CH4 contents of the gas in every experiment though the influents are different. Fig. 4 indicated that CH4 production in all experiments in the first 5d had a lower average rate of 13.1mld−1(g VS)−1 with the low content of 10.0–49.4%. The reason is that the activity of methanogenic bacteria was inhibited by VFAs due to their high concentrations (about 10.0gL−1 in experiments 4, 5, 6 and 7 and more than 12.0gL−1 in the other experiments, as shown in Fig. 5 (d)) and a lag time occurred. Up to the 5th day, the total VFA concentrations fell to 6200–8500mgL−1 and inhibition significantly decreased. It resulted in the CH4 production rate in all experiments increasing from 4.0 to 12.5mld−1(g TS)added −1 with the average CH4 content increasing from 10.0–49.4% to above 65.0% in all experiments. Meanwhile the degradation rate of VFA greatly accelerated, with only 100–300mgL−1 except in experiment 3 (which gave 756mgL−1) on the 19th day with 0.5% HAc remaining. The average COD concentration was only 948mgL−1 at the end of the whole fermentation, and the removal rate reached 92.5%. Except for experiments 6 and 7, the HAc concentration in other experiments decreased little and even had an ascending trend on the 5th day (Fig. 5(a)). The reason is that although part of the HAc is degraded to CH4 by methanogenic bacteria, other VFAs are converted to HAc by HAc-producing bacteria at the same time. Fig. 5(b) shows that the degradation rate of HBu was very fast in the initial stages of fermentation, while its concentration increased to different extents in 5–6d. Thereafter HBu concentration decreased rapidly, falling to below 1000mgL−1 in 9–10d, and only trace amounts remained in experiments 1 and 4 on the 20th day. Because the degradation rate from HBu to HAc was faster, thermodynamically unfavorable metabolism of the higher organic acids and alcohols to acetic acid and H2 was able to occur [25]. The degradation rate of HPr was slower than of HBu and had a lag time for degradation (Fig. 5(c)). In 1–10d, the HPr concentration kept high and increased to different extents, the reason was that the degradation speed of HPr was slow and the primary degradation type of the left organic substrate was HPr fermentation type. While the concentrations of HAc and HBu decreased gradually, the HPr degradation rate began to increase. By the 19th day, the HPr concentration decreased to 80–330mgL−1 except in experiment 3, for which the HPr concentration was 686mgL−1, which is a little higher than was reported by Ding and Wang [26]. This means that HPr is degraded rapidly by methanogenic bacteria after a lag time and when the concentrations of HAc and HBu fall to below about 2500mgL−1 and 1000mgL−1, respectively. As reported by Wiegant [27], when HPr is the main pollutant in wastewater treated by the anaerobic fermentation method and H2 is inevitably produced, a two-phase anaerobic reactor should be used to degrade HPr in the second phase. The heating value of H2 and CH4 is 242, 801kJ/mol, respectively. Based on the highest H2 and CH4 production observed in this experiment (1265.6, 6986.5ml, respectively), the energy yields in two reactors are 13.7, 250.6kJ, respectively. It indicates that the H2 energy is only 5.2% of all biogas energy and it is negligible by comparison with CH4 energy yield."
9,Conclusions,"The H2 and CH4 fermentation lasted for 120–144h, 21–23d, respectively, the H2 and CH4 productivity of sludge was enhanced by pretreatment. The relative order of pretreatment methods of H2 productivity effectiveness and CH4 productivity effectiveness produced by the residua of the first phase was heat treatment>alkali treatment>acid treatment. When the inoculum sludge was heat-treated at 80°C for 30min, the H2 and CH4 production rate was the highest of 36.6, 202.2ml (g TS)added −1, which increased by 77.4%, 18.1%, respectively. In the first phase, when the cumulative HAc, HPr and HBu and the total VFA concentrations after 72h reached 3534, 2400, 2425 and 8770mgL−1, respectively, in all experiments, the average H2 production rate and H2 content decreased from 49.7mld−1(g VS)−1 and 55.3% to 18.7mld−1(g VS)−1 and 43.2%, respectively. H2 production was positive correlated with HAc and HBu productions and negative correlated with HPr production. When the HPr and total VFA concentrations reached about 2850mgL−1 and 10.0gL−1, respectively, the H2 production rate fell rapidly to almost zero. In the second phase, when the total VFA concentration was above 10.0gL−1 in the first 5d, the CH4 productions in all experiments had a lower average rate of 4.0mld−1(g VS)added −1 with the low contents of 10.0–49.4%. When the total VFA concentration fell to 6200–8500mgL−1 CH4 production reached about 12.5mld−1(g VS)added −1 with the average CH4 content increasing to above 65.0%. HPr was degraded more rapidly when HAc and HBu concentration dropped to 2500mgL−1 and 1000mgL−1, respectively. Synthetically the H2 energy is only 5.2% of all biogas energy and it is negligible by comparison with the CH4 energy yield."
