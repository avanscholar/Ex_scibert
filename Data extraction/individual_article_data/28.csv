0,Introduction,"Production of energy in a sustainable way and its increased availability for various applications are among the top priorities of governments and various stakeholders worldwide. Fig. 1 shows the historical and projected energy consumption in 2040 taking into account various resources. Combustion of conventional petroleum-based fuels account for more than half of the world's primary energy use, which is expected to increase further around 56% by 2040 compared with that of the year 2010 (Awad et al., 2018; Dogan et al., 2009). The global energy consumption rate in 2018 and energy requirement in 2040 has been shown in Fig. 2 . It has been noted that the gasoline and other liquid fuels are the dominant sources of energy for transportation sector, although there is a slight decline in total transportation energy consumption from 96% in 2012 to 88% in 2040. Several initiatives have taken by the automotive manufactures for the partial replacement of gasoline by other renewable biofuels. In particular, the ethanol has become one of the most viable option for effective utilization with petroleum fuels in the form of blending mode and this technique has been widely incorporated in many countries. Very recently, India has successfully introduced 10% ethanol with gasoline for all gasoline fuelled vehicles and even Brazil has implemented ethanol -gasoline blending mode up to 20% (IEA,2016). The high energy density of gasoline and diesel along with their superior burning ability are the main boosters for their usage in power systems. In the last three decades, hydrocarbon fuel driven prime movers are major contributors in greenhouse gas emissions in 30–40% of total world production rates. Due to the exponential hike and growth in number of operating vehicles and the overall growth of the transportation sectors have led rise in the consumption of petroleum fuels resulting in exacerbated air pollution and associated adverse impacts on human health. The heavy demand on transportation fuels leads to faster exploitation of petroleum reserves which might deplete the petroleum resources due to their non-renewability (Manisalidis et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a need for renewable energy resources which should be employed in sustainable manner for the partial substitution or complete replacement of petroleum-based fuels. The production of renewable alternative fuels from numerous biological sources is being considered as one of the thrust areas in many countries (Babu and Murthy, 2017). Any organic or carbonaceous materials produced from the activities of living organisms that can be used as energy or materials are commonly called “biomass” (Matsumura, 2020). Furthermore, any biomass conversion into useful bioenergy could yield “syngas” as by-product when the effective conversion could take place through or gasification techniques. Biomass based fuels such as bio-methane, bio-alcohols, bio-hydrogen, biodiesel and bio-oil from waste resources are currently being considered as alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector. It is important to note that generally biomass is abundantly available at almost uniform rate worldwide and many technological methods are already available for large scale production of biofuels at competitive prices (Kuo et al., 2019). There are only few biomasses used for the large-scale production of biofuels due to their availability and their characteristics. Corn is the biggest biofuel source in United States, because corn ethanol is more sustainable than gasoline. After corn, sugarcane is the second most widely used biomass source in the world of biofuel production. Particularly, sugarcane develops in warm parts of the world in abundance and has made the countries like Brazil to become energy independent (Pereira et al., 2019). Furthermore, many innovative solutions are being proposed for the production of biofuels of third and fourth generation and these biofuels are expected to have predominant role in future (Kumar and Saravanan, 2016). Alcohol based fuels are promising alternatives due to their relatively low global warming impact, various feedstock availability and more importantly, their clean burning feature (Yusri et al., 2017). Methanol, ethanol, butanol and fusel oil are few among alcohols with already proved properties as transportation fuels, while some of their derivatives like methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), dimethyl ether (DME) and diethyl ether (DEE) represent additional compounds from alcohol hydroxyl family that can provide a competition to petroleum-based fuels (Papadaskalopoulou et al., 2019). Methanol is generally known as “wood fuel” and this alcohol has excellent properties which favourable for applications in engines, while its simple chemical form (CH3OH) and low carbon content (the least among the alcohols) result in the clean burning ability (Ramadhas, 2016). Even though, there are several production routes for methanol production, the handling difficulties due to toxic nature is the main threats for its commercialization. Many European have successfully demonstrated the route map for the replacement of gasoline with ethanol at a reasonable rate to meet the stringent emission norms. Ethanol (C2H5OH) is the most consumed biofuel among not only in the alcohol family but also taking into account all other alternative fuels. This is the resultant of its low carbon background, less toxicity than methanol and blending ability with gasoline and other fuels. The ethanol in transportation sector has been became commonly used since 1970 in Brazil and USA. Butanol, a four-carbon alcohol (C4H9OH), seems to be a promising candidate for transportation sector in recent times. The superior anti-knocking ability, comparable heat carrying capacity and more importantly the least cold starting and corrosion issues (compared to ethanol and methanol) are the dominant factors for the selection of butanol as primary choice (Zhen et al., 2020). Recently, the waste to wealth approaches have been used as successful techniques for butanol production and these techniques are currently tested on laboratory scales. Moreover, fermentation technique has been used as a common production process for the development of alcoholic fuels like ethanol and butanol with different biomasses, microorganisms, pre-treatment methods and separation techniques ( Veza et al., 2021 ). Fusel alcohol is a mixture of few alcohols (amyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, iso-butanol and traces of other components), which is obtained during production of ethanol by alcoholic fermentation. There are few significant improvements on utilization of fusel alcohol in gasoline engine. However, the production rate of fusel alcohol is extremely low as hardly 2.5 L per 1000 L of ethanol production (Ferreira et al., 2013). Pentanol (C5H11OH) is a longer chain alcohol which offers extremely superior qualities like better auto-ignition ability, easily mixing ability with petroleum products and more importantly, the low moisture formation (Federico et al., 2015). The ethers-based fuels like DME and DEE are derivatives of alcohols and these ethers are considered to be the best alternative sources for internal combustion engine applications in the near future. However, lot more research is needed to reduce the production cost of alcohol-based fuels and to make their large-scale commercial production in an economically viable rate (Kim et al., 2008). From the insight overview of alcohol and ethers application as well as their utilization scenario in the global market, there are hardly few reports on production ethanol and butanol. Several studies have also investigated various technologies for the production of methanol. However, only few studies have focused on the production of higher alcohols, and there is no comprehensive technical review available on the production of alcohol fuels used as transportation fuels. None of technical reports deals with the production of ethers too. It has been realized that the alcohols will be used as automotive fuels at different concentration in automobiles and other gasoline power generating devices. There are wider research studies in last few decades both at laboratory and industrial scales which served as a basis for this review with focusing on various production aspects of methanol, ethanol, butanol, fusel oil and other higher alcohols which are produced from different feedstocks. This review has been outlined the overall and an in-depth discussion on production of low carbon and high carbon-based alcohols by analysing the traditional production routes and examining the recent state of the art technological developments. More importantly, an overview on production of dimethyl ether and diethyl ether is also discussed and summarized as well. Finally, an elaborative discussion has been attempted to pinpoint the opportunities as well as the challenges and limitations of low and high carbon alcohol production from different types of feedstocks under various operating conditions."
1,Production of methanol,"Methanol is one of the highly demanded chemicals and it has been utilized as renowned raw material for developing many valuable compounds including octane boosters of gasoline like MTBE. Also, methanol has been considered as one of the important alcoholic fuel for automotive application because of its calorific value of 19.58 MJ/kg. Methanol has high volatile quality and toxic effects also (Surisetty et al., 2011). It can be produced from wide range of feedstocks including those of fossil origin such as coal and natural gas as well as the renewable ones based on biomass. Another interesting choice for methanol production is the synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2), the main gas among the greenhouse gases (GHG) from any carbon footprints. However, the current production of methanol on industrial scale is mainly based on the natural gas conversion by steam reforming into synthesis gas. Fig. 3 shows the various techniques used for methanol production. Many similarities were noticed on methanol production based on gasification processes, whereas the technology of CO2 conversion is entirely different."
2,Lignocellulosic biomass,"2.1 Lignocellulosic biomass The biomass in the form of lignocellulose is commonly categorized as any waste that is originated from industry, agriculture and household wastes like stalks, sawdust, straw, bagasse, shells, sticks, husks, sludge and municipal solid waste (MSW) etc. Many innovative ideas are developed and investigated in recent times on production of methanol from biomass particularly from biowaste resources. Pyrolysis and gasification methods are preferred by many researchers and these techniques are widely accepted for large scale production also. The conversion of municipal solid waste and slurry waste into bio-methanol is achievable by bio-synthesis process. Interestingly, few innovative techniques like photo electrochemical and electrolysis processes are shown to be the potential pathways for bio-methanol production. However, these methods are currently on lab scale mode. Any type of wooden based feedstocks of hazelnut shells, beach wood and hardwood can expose to pyrolysis process at extremely higher temperature and pressures and this might result bio-methanol yield at the rate of 8.75%. During this process, the formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen are reformulated into methanol which is enhanced by suitable catalyst (Wiggers et al., 2009). Notably, one metric ton of solid waste would generate up to 185 kg of bio-methanol but at the expense of higher heat input. It is also interesting to note that the heating temperature and presence of volatile compounds in biomass are playing a pivotal role in methanol production rate. On the other hand, the biomass based on fishery and goat wastes are shown very poor yield of methanol content (less than 1%) (Kamarudin et al., 2013). Gasification is another pathway for bio-methanol production at elevated temperature of 1000 °C in which biomass or coal could be used as feedstocks. With proper gasification process around 36–55% of methanol yield is quite achievable from agricultural biomass wastes but this method requires high energy input (Nakagawa et al., 2007). The conversion of greenhouse gases (CO2) and methane into bio-methanol is comprehensively generated by Methylosinus trichosporium bacteria as biosynthesis process without any additional requirement of hydrogen. However, this method is feasible only for suitable pH value, reaction temperature and more importantly the reactor cell density (Lee et al., 2004). In biomass conversion history, the solar assisted biomass gasification has shown remarkable improvement in ambient environment as well as in production rate. With this solar integrated gasification of biomass feedstock would generate bio-methanol via syngas at elevated operating conditions. It was proved that the annual production rate could raise up to 54.80 ktons without much deportation on environment when compared to coal gasification process (Bai et al., 2019)."
3,Food and municipal solid waste,"2.2 Food and municipal solid waste Methanol production from waste materials from food processing industry is another topic of research nowadays. The basic pre-treatment and anaerobic fermentation are the most commonly used techniques for the high yield methanol production. The waste from food like apple pomace, and waste bread could be easily converted into methanol with the yield of about 295 L for one ton of dry feed waste by anaerobic digestion (Hegde et al., 2018). The countries’ economic and environmental growth is highly appreciated by proper waste to methanol approach (WtM) for recovery of useful fuel from municipal waste via anaerobic co-digestion process (Iaquaniello et al., 2017). It also has been reported that the cow dung and many animals manure are highly favourable for bio-methanol production as a result of anaerobic digestion process. The yield rate through this method was also highly competitive as 14–39% which is better than pyrolysis process (Anitha et al., 2015). Further, the reaction rate is greatly enhanced by the selection of suitable catalyst like Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 etc. The greenhouse gas savings through anaerobic digestion process is significantly better about 14%–35% and this was not evident even in CO2 conversion method also (Borgogna et al., 2019)."
4,Carbon dioxide,"2.3 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission formed by anthropogenic activities is a major contributor of global greenhouse gas emissions which are results in climate change and dispersion in the atmosphere. The exponential hike in CO2 in environment is an alarming threat to human mankind. However otherwise it is one of the valuable resources and it has been traditionally used as a potential feedstock for certain processes. The carbon dioxide can be directly used as feedstock for the production of methanol through hydrogenation with catalyst. Carbon dioxide is more stable and extremely inert with a high C–C coupling barrier compound and it requires more energy input to convert to other products. However, hydrogen is a high energy material that can be used as a reagent for the transformation of CO2 to other products. Hence CO2 hydrogenation is an effective process to convert into various value-added products such as methanol, lower olefins, gasoline, aromatics, and liquefied petroleum gas and so on. In conventional method, the production of methanol from syngas was produced at 6 MPa and 250 °C operating conditions with a catalyst of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 in an industrial scale by BASF, Germany (Behrens et al., 2013). It is a good alternative to use CO2 as feedstock by replacing CO for methanol production (Ma et al., 2009). However, the inevitability in this process is the formation of water vapor which inhibits the reaction resulting to serious catalyst deactivation. To improve the catalytic stability an efficient catalyst is needed, and it also avoids the formation of some undesired by-products during the methanol synthesis (Li et al., 2014). Wide variety of heterogeneous catalysts have been evaluated in the conversion of CO2 and H2 into methanol such as Cu-based catalysts with noble metals such as Pd and Pt as active components (Ding et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2013). Studies reported that increase in pressure from 30 to 950 bar could increase the methanol production with 15 times higher than other methods (Tidona et al., 2013)."
5,Production of ethanol,"Bio-ethanol is one of the clean and renewable biofuels which is playing crucial role in worldwide transportation sectors due its eco-friendly nature, partial fulfilment of petroleum products and more importantly mitigation in global warming issues (Sivagurunathan et al., 2020). Many governments have taken unanimous decision on implementation of bio-ethanol in two-wheelers and light duty vehicles under partial mode without much deviation in existing infrastructure due to its better physicochemical properties than other biofuels. Some of ethanol properties like calorific value (26.83 MJ/kg), oxygen content and high-octane number are making ethanol as primary choice than methanol. Interestingly, the ethanol occupies 74% of world biofuel market and its production rate has been doubled in last 10 years (13,123 million gal in 2007 to 25,583 million gal in 2016) (Halder et al., 2019). Because of this hercules demand, the bio-thermal production has been developed as first generation to fourth generation in last two decades. Initially, the kernels and starchy corns-based biomass are used for bio-ethanol production and these are called as “First generation biofuels”. The lignocellulose biomass has been available in huge amount throughout the world and the biofuel production from these lignocellulosic biomasses are termed as “second generation” (Prasad et al., 2019). Now, the dominant role of algae biomass in biofuel production as “third generation”. In future, the recovery of CO2 gas from industrial sector would play a pivotal role in ethanol production as “fourth generation biofuel” (Akbar et al., 2019). The schematic representation of various techniques used for bio-ethanol production is depicted in Fig. 4 ."
6,Sugar and other food grains,"3.1 Sugar and other food grains Significant modifications are being developed to produce ethanol from different possible biomasses and few of them are considered for the production of ethanol on large scale as well as in an economic way. Initially, the sugarcane-based compounds are found to be the best choice for bio-ethanol production due to the better yield rate at low conversion cost (Dutta et al., 2014). The generation of bio-ethanol from corn, wheat, cassava also considered in the past and however, the utilization of these food related stocks has made direct impedance on animal and human living standards. It is also interesting to note that more than 80% of bio-ethanol is commonly developed mainly from sugarcane and corn in the world and in particular, fewer countries are successfully used as automotive fuel also. (Rolz and De Leon, 2011). In general, the process involved for bio-ethanol generation from starch or sugar-based raw materials are more or less same with slight changes in reaction temperature and pressure. For both feedstocks, the milling, fermentation and distillation are the common process. However, the conversion of starch feedstocks into bio-ethanol might require gelatinization and hydrolysis processes along with the aforementioned process (Liu et al., 2008; Toor et al., 2020). The carbohydrates present in the starch-based grains need to be changed in the form of glucose. So that this will enhance the bio-ethanol fermentation reactions. Many significant works were carried out in the past on bio-ethanol production under various operating conditions. All these methods have shown clear information that the fermentation reactions should undergo at desirable agitation rate, temperature and reaction time along with pH value (Ferreira et al., 2018). More importantly, the type of microorganism used for fermentation is also plays vital role in bio-ethanol conversion rate. Many microorganisms are utilized successfully for fermentation reactions and most of the organisms are belongs to S. cerevisiae category and few studies are conducted using yeast also. It is reported that the bio-ethanol yield rate would be more appropriate at certain conditions like 3.7–5.5 pH value, 30–40 °C reaction temperature and 150–300 rpm agitation rate. More importantly, the fermentation time (32–160 h) is also play big role in bio-ethanol conversion rate (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2013). One of the greatest benefits of sugarcane fermentation is superior yield rate by about 94–97%. Even though the sugarcane fermentation is a viable option for alternative solution of petroleum products, its edible characteristic will be the primary consequence in food scarcity for animal and human beings."
7,Lignocellulosic biomass,"3.2 Lignocellulosic biomass The conversion of waste biomass from any kind of origins into bio-ethanol is quite achievable from wider range of resources such as all kinds of straw, wooden debris, cotton stocks and other husks also. All these raw materials should undergo proper pre-treatment process, suitable hydrolysis pathway, accurate fermentation and finally defensive distillation process. The first two process are very much essential for the breaking the heavy lignocellulosic molecules into light weight glucose molecules whereas the last two processes are required to extract the bio-ethanol in a cleanable manner (Rastogi and Shrivastava, 2017). The cellulose is one of the most and easily available organic compounds which is exist everywhere in the earth surface (around 170 billion metric tons for one annum) (Su et al., 2020). The ribbon structure of cellulosic contains many thousands of glucose compounds and these needs to be converted into ethanol at proper operating conditions. The lignocellulose structure consists of mostly cellulose and hemicellulose along with slight portion of lignin compounds. These lignin compounds are generally treated as waste products and it can be separated during production process. In all types of fermentation process, the pre-treatment of lignocellulose itself occupies around 10–27% of production cost (Sindhu et al., 2016). Depending on the type of cellulose feedstock, the pre-treatment could be carried in physical form, chemical form, physico-chemical form and in biological form also. The purpose of proper pre-treatment method could accelerate the cellulose and hemicellulose for conversion into sugar with the help of enzyme treatments. Numerous experimentations are tested globally for bio-ethanol production in last one decade and lots of significant movements are developed so far. More importantly, the lignocellulose particle size is making high influence on higher yield rate of bio-ethanol and due to which the correct pro-processing technique is playing a crucial role in production process. All these treatments have certain merits and demerits also. In particular, the biological form of pre-treatment using bacteria and enzymes are leads to degrade the lignin and cellulose compounds (Klein Marcuschamer et al., 2011). After the initial stage of pre-treatment, the suitable hydrolysis with selective fermentation process could enhance the yield rate of bioethanol. Before bio-ethanol formation from lignocellulose, the formation of glucose and xylose are very much essential to increase the yield recovery. The pre-treated biomass would undergo the hydrolysis process in order to separate the heavy compounds like carbohydrates and starch materials by the addition of water under the utilization of enzyme or acid as catalyst (Mosier et al., 2002). The enzyme catalyst would be preferable choice because of better economy and less damage to ambient conditions from its waste disposal. Many integrated pathways are developed in recent times to obtain the higher yield at reasonable prices. These literatures reveal that, the chemical components of lignocellulosic feedstocks and its inbuilt proportionate ratio decides the proper final treatment process like separate form of hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or simultaneous mode of saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and latest one is about simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation methods (SSCF) (Vohra et al., 2014). All these methods are successfully developed for bio-ethanol production and however, each method has its own excellence and limitations. The SHF method offers independent feeding of prepared stock and this method can be taken place at desirable operating conditions. The possibility of sugar production and then ethanol generation could be enhanced simultaneously. However, the operation time and production cost are extremely low in SSCF pathway. Very recently, in consolidated bioprocessing, the microbial conversion pathway is getting reasonable attention due to no wastage and higher yield rate which is also happening at lowest price (Aditiya et al., 2016). The final stage is called fermentation technique in which the hydrolysate has been subjected to heat in the absence of oxygen with the help of bacteria or enzyme. The fermentation conditions are very important in order to get the final output like pH value, reaction temperature and type of microorganism (Liu et al., 2020a). It is estimated that the pH value should be 3.5–5 for fungus and whereas for bacteria, the pH value needs to be slightly higher as 6.5–7.5. Table 2 highlights the summery of bio-ethanol production from various resources."
8,Algae,"3.3 Algae The bio-ethanol production through advanced technology from several waste lignocelluloses have many distinguish features like low relay on food sources, ease of operation and more importantly the eco-friendly supply etc. However, these techniques have fewer technical issues like damage on forest resources, need of advanced techniques for large scale development (Singh and Olsen, 2011). Therefore, an attempt has been made to look of new alternative feedstocks from other than food and forest resources. In this scenario, the marine based algae organisms have enormous potential like excellent carbohydrate, enormous lipid content, ease of cultivation on any waster ambient and lastly, ability to extract CO2 gas in an exponential way etc. (Schenk et al., 2008). It is an interesting point to note that the formation of algae on water surface (microalgae) or the formation of algae on rock surface or other surfaces (macro algae) are the feedstock for “Third generation biofuels”. Both the forms of algae are finding remarkable place in bio-ethanol formation under lab scale or large-scale model in the current scenario (Anto et al., 2020). It is also interesting to note that both of these algae contain several carbohydrates like starch and cellulose which make them as potential candidate for biofuel development (Subhadra, 2010). Seawood, an another nae of macroalgae is potentially available in seashore countries like China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Philippines (Sudhakar et al., 2018). The generation of bio-ethanol from algae is also following the same path of lignocellulose biomass like enzymatic or acid hydrolysis process, SHF or SSF technique for bio-ethanol conversion processes. For most of the acid hydrolysis process, the sulfuric acid is the best choice for the extraction of simple sugars from polysaccharides compounds at elevated temperature. However, the conversion rate is widely improved for enzymatic technique. In all the bio-ethanol conversion from algae, the yeast-based microorganism is mostly employed due to better recovery rate, higher reaction rate and more importantly the least formation of by-products (Pienkos and Darzins, 2009). Various research works available on the bio-ethanol production are presented in Table 2."
9,Carbon dioxide,"3.4 Carbon dioxide The technological developments on biofuel sectors have shown the way to develop “fourth generation biofuels” in which the bio-ethanol production has been combined with input from carbon capture technique and biomass cultivation. Recently, the research work carried out on generation of lipids for biomass production in a genetic modification process by oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms. Further, the developed biomass needs to undergo the bio-chemical conversion process via hydrolysis and fermentation which has resulted in higher bio-ethanol yield rate. One of the biggest benefits of the carbon recovery technique is the remarkable reduction in GHG emission when compared to all previous methods (Abdullah et al., 2019). These things are evident that the supply of fourth generation biofuel on economically viable rate is not possible in near future and it may take its own time over next decade. Currently there are many processes uses CO2 as a base material for the production of ethanol (Jones et al., 2013; Kuhl et al., 2014) through several routes. Studies reported that conversion of CO2 to ethanol through electrochemistry route using specific anode and cathode in a fuel cell setup (Ramadan et al., 2018). The synthesis of ethanol depends upon the electrode materials, potential applied, pH of the solution, pressure, temperature etc. (Lee and Tak, 2001). Carbon is used as anode for the oxidation to generate the electrons and protons and this source will be used to reduce CO2 to ethanol in the cathode chamber (Yang et al., 2016). Reduction of CO2 occurs to form COOH on the cathode surface by accepting the electrons and protons then it is hydrogenated by releasing H2O and adsorb CO2 to form ethanol (Yang et al., 2016)."
10,Production of butanol,"Butanol has extreme attraction in last five years due its many significant benefits compared to other alcohols like methanol and ethanol. Interestingly, the butanol has low evaporation tendency and it also has high heating capacity than other lower alcohols. Moreover, it also can be generated from several feedstocks as like ethanol (Ashok et al., 2019). Butanol has less intrusive than ethanol and it can be easily relocated via pipelines also. Moreover, the same existing supply infrastructure is preferable for its effective utilization. It is predicted that in future, butanol would be an important component in transportation sector around the globe (Pugazhendhi et al., 2019). The recent defeat on economic aspects and damage on environment can be alternated by butanol due to its many remarkable benefits like common fuel for spark ignition and compression ignition engine, low latent heat of evaporation, superior burning ability, higher energy content (33.09 MJ/kg) and excellent resistance for auto ignition (Xue et al., 2013). Many experimental works that have been conducted in recent years revealed that the application of butanol could be widen not only in gasoline engine, but it may be act as dominant role in diesel engine also. The butanol production has two common routes as one is generally known as “Acetone-butanol -ethanol (ABE)” fermentation and other method is called as petro-chemical process. Both of these methods seem to produce higher rate with quite expensive route and however, the ABE technique is considered to be the best solution for the current scenario due to its renewable nature. As for us the history concerned, the ABE fermentation production technique is one of the oldest production methods in the word ever developed so far. At the same time, it is considered to be the second-best biotechnical production method which is just behind ethanol fermentation process. There are about four different forms of feedstocks that have been utilized for butanol production such as molasses based raw materials, food-based feedstocks (starch foods), lignocellulose biomass and switch grass (Jin et al., 2011). Fig. 5 shows the various production routes of butanol generation. It is very much unfortunate that the major portion of butanol price is taken over by raw material cost and this has happened due to the war between supply and demand of food chain materials. In-depth efforts by biological scientists and Engineers have shown the ways for finding new alternative sources in recent years. Interestingly, the ABE The fermentation process could be achieved in the form of batch pathway, fed-batch pathway or continuous pathway (Badr et al., 2001)."
11,Molasses and starch,"4.1 Molasses and starch Any starch and carbohydrate related raw materials could be converted into butanol via microorganism fermentation pathway with the help of bacteria. Initially, the conversion of sugar juice would be changed into sugarcane bagasse and ethanol which is then followed by butanol production. This method is commonly known as Guerbet reaction in which aliphatic alcohols are restructured into alkylated alcohols at the expenses of equivalent of water (Green, 2011). The most widely used bacteria for butanol production are Clostridium acetobutilicum and Clostridium cellulolyticum (Li et al., 2019). In the first stage of ABE fermentation, the production of acetic and butyric acids would happen at prescribed conditions then followed by re-assimilation for the formation of acetone, ethanol and butanol. Many studies were undergone on butanol production via ABE fermentation route from sugarcane. In this production method, the juice is extracted from sugarcane and fed into the crystalized zone for molasses development. Before that, a proper pre-treatment process is very much important for the removal of sand, fibers and other impurities. Meanwhile, the dilution of sugarcane juice is achieved by mixing suitable sugar at desired rate, before it is fed into fermentation reactor (Mariano et al., 2013). Different forms of sugarcane feedstock as well as other raw materials like potato, maize, sugar beet molasses and thin-shell silk cocoons have been utilized for the production of bio-butanol. In most of the bio-butanol production pathway, the pH value, sugar recovery rate and urea content are also play a pivotal role. Table 3 shows the various production aspects of butanol from all possible feedstocks. It is also noted that more than 65% of production cost in the starch and sugar-based feedstocks would be accounted for raw material cost and the remaining amount will be taken away by other costs (Zhang et al., 2015). It is also worthwhile to note that the controlling the inhibitory contents like ferulic acid, hydroxymethylfurfural, syringaldehyde is the major challenge during microbial fermentation in most of the sugar and starch-based feedstock conversion process. However, the wheat straw does not need this kind of detoxification and for other feedstocks; a small amount of lime can be used to minimize the unnecessary accumulations in the reactor (Kolesinska et al., 2019). This has resulted in improper utilization of sugar (only 60% utilized) which could lead to reduce the butanol yield rate. Even though the bio-butanol production from starch-based feedstock has many positive outputs such as higher volumetric output and titers, an increase in demand on food crops is the major concern due to which the researchers show the way in different route as second generation for butanol production."
12,Lignocellulose,"4.2 Lignocellulose Due to the coherent fighting between food crops for human usage and raw material for biofuel generations, the scientists and researchers have identified new route to use all resources from agricultural waste, forestry, municipal solid waste and other non-food waste residues. These developments are highlighted as “second generation biofuels”. Several iterations are focused on these biomasses-based feedstocks because of extreme carbohydrate content (Cellulose:35–50%), renewable form, widely available everywhere and more importantly the sublime reduction in CO2 emission compare (Sims et al., 2010). For this second-generation bio-butanol development, the proper pre-treatment technique is more important along with detoxification process when the lignocellulose materials are used. This is very much important to segregate the higher cellulose and hemicellulose content to extract maximum bio-butanol production. Literatures are also revealed that there are many approaches for these pre-treatment processes like physical form, chemical form, thermophysical form, thermochemical form and the biological form (Berndes et al., 2003). The other conversion methods like suitable fermentation, recovery and distillation are remaining same as sugar-based feedstocks. Many studies are also suggested that the batch/fed batch form of fermentation would be more favourable for small scale development and continuous batch is preferable for large scale production. As per the report on global energy consumption, nearly 250–500 EJ of energy will be generated as biofuels and that too from lignocellulose biomass by the year 2050 (Nanda et al., 2014). There are many lignocellulose biomasses which are originated from various fields such as bamboo, palm oil waste, waste from fruit peels and agro wastes. Furthermore, the biomass selection for ABE fermentation is highly influenced by the number of monosaccharides which might enhance the ABE fermentation (Khedkar et al., 2017). The quantity of glucose in biomass would enhance the ABE fermentation with higher bio-butanol yield rate and in general the bagasse contains highest glucose content (407 g/kg) and whereas the other biomasses might have around 300–400 g/kg (Huzir et al., 2018). Finally, the proper upstream and downstream technologies could have also made substantial improvement in reducing biomass structure and at the other end the bio-butanol titration is greatly influenced by proper downstream process. The major obstacles in lignocellulose bio-butanol conversion are the complex feedstocks, unexpected cost in upstream and downstream process and low productivity at various operating conditions (Rabemanolontsoa and Saka, 2013). Based on several research works (Table 3), still lots of works need to be carry out in a systematic way to combine the pre-treatments with suitable recovery techniques to uphill the production rate."
13,Municipal solid waste,"4.3 Municipal solid waste Now days, an exponential growth in human population everywhere in the world creates huge amount of municipal solid wastes from various day-to day activities. These wastes are the biggest threat not only to the human beings but for other living things and also for environment (Ebrahimian and Karimi, 2020). It is also revealed that the proposed MSW would be closer to 4 billion tons in the year 2100 and the removal or exploration would be a serious problem for many countries (Hosseini et al., 2013). Another main reason for MSW as feedstock for butanol conversion is that the enriched pentose and hexose sugars in MSW which seems to be as greatest potential for cost reduction of butanol generation. The conversion of butanol from MSW has also synthesis in a same manner as that of other biomass waste resources. With suitable solvent removal method like gas stripping and pervaporation method for water removal from solvent which makes the butanol product in more clean form at economic rate. The summer of all production routes of butanol is listed in Table 3. However, the segregation and converting all shapes of MSW into uniform is the biggest challenge and proper modern technique need to identified to segregate the MSW into small sizes."
14,Algae,"4.4 Algae As the earlier discussions on butanol production have shown poor yield rate, scientists are utilized algae for the production of “Third generation of biofuel”. Very recently, the biomass developed from algae seems to be best and feasible substrate for bio-butanol production which ultimately reduce the greenhouse gas emission and enhance the renewable energy utilizations in future. Algae are nothing but the composition of several organisms, which are generally available in microform and macroform and these algae are used for biofuel productions through various techniques. The former type maybe generated in smaller sizes which is exists in marine water or in fresh water surfaces. All the larger sizes of algae are easily grown up in seabeds (Potts et al., 2012). Due to the rich carbohydrate and protein content in micro and macro algae, the conversion into butanol would be more beneficial when compared to other fuels. Moreover, the production of butanol from algal feedstocks could adopt the same technique of ethanol production route except the yeasts which are used for ethanol generation. These kinds of microorganisms might slowdown the pentoses and other hexoses generation (Wang et al., 2017). It is also interesting to note that the alage compounds like Spirulina platensis, Chloroccum and Nitzchia cioterium have highest carbohydrate content (more than 50% of its own dry weight) and this will enhance the fermentation reaction. Due to the absence of hemicelluloses and lignin content, the aldehyde formation is significantly controlled which has resulted in low pre-treatment cost when compared to ethanol production of lignocellulose materials (Markou et al., 2012). Furthermore, the production of bio-butanol from algae is at the initial stage and most of the researchers are looking to enhance other valuable products rather than developing carbohydrate for butanol production. Many bottleneck issues need to be addressed before these feedstocks are getting wider attention in the fuel development market. It has been reported that the production of butanol can be at the range of 0.02–0.29 g butanol per gram of sugar and it could harvest around 0.8–13.2 g of butanol per liter."
15,Carbon dioxide,"4.5 Carbon dioxide The production of butanol from greenhouse gas is another topic for research in recent years. The gas fermentation is formed in this process uses reversed-pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (rPFOR)/pyruvate-formate-lyase-dependent (Pfl) pathway for the production of butanol using specific microbes. This pathway allows one-carbon (C-1) molecules into Acetyl-CoA and this molecule is used for producing various products like acetate, ethanol and butanol etc (Sandoval-Espinola et al., 2017). The yield of butanol from heterotrophic fermentation is very low due to the carbon loss in the form of xylose and nearly 1/3 is lost in terms of CO2 and hence this could be overcome to enrich the bacteria to uptake the CO2 and use it as a substrate (González-Tenorio et al., 2020). The autotrophic anaerobic bacteria can use carbon sources such as CO and CO2 in combination with hydrogen with electron-bifurcating, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase complex and/or an aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Bertsch and Müller, 2015). Studies reported that at pH 5.3 and 37 °C similar butanol concentrations (14.8 mM) were also obtained in a continuously (Rajagopalan et al., 2002). Clostridium acetobutylicum was used to reduce H2 and CO2 with a butanol production of 0.58 g•l−1•h−1. Spirochaetales, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, and Proteiniphilum reported as effective substrate for the production of butanol titer of 889 mg/L (González-Tenorio et al., 2020)."
16,Production of fusel alcohol,"Another type of higher alcohol is fusel alcohol which is having similar behavior like ethanol and it is getting wider usability in spark ignition engine applications. Fusel alcohol has better calorific value of 30 MJ/kg, higher octane number and significant oxygen content. These properties are making it as a strong contestant in automotive sector especially in spark ignition engine mobility (Calam et al., 2015). At present, the fusel alcohol has been commonly utilized for isoamyl acetate, biodiesel and synthesis lubricant developments. The main constituents of fusel alcohol are mainly isoamyl alcohol, certain amount of butanol and propanol and small fraction of ethanol and moisture content as well (Solmaz, 2015). Fusel alcohol is one of the by-product of fermentation process during ethanol production. The formation of ethanol from any food grains during fermentation could develops sucrose and this sucrose then subjected to develop aldehyde by distillation process. The other product which is obtained at the base of the distillation container is nothing but fusel alcohol (Jannathulla et al., 2017). Moreover, the distillation of alcohols via fermentation can also yield fusel alcohol in large quantity and this is the method that has been adopted in all industries for long period (Ferreira et al., 2013). Furthermore, the pH value which is maintained during fermentation process for ethyl alcohol in a bioreactor could also plays a vital role in fusel alcohol generation. Likewise, a study revealed that the type of yeast strain, temperature, composition of wort and fermentation methods also influencing the fermentative production of fusel alcohol (Montoya et al., 2016). Notably, higher production of fusel alcohol is observed in batch fermentation under stirred and accumulating conditions. It is also reported that the all kinds of aromatic alcohols like fusel alcohols are generally produced from proteinaceous food products by fermentation reaction with the help of yeasts. This technique is also named as Ehrlich pathway in which transamination reaction and decarboxylated are the common reactions (Patel et al., 2015). It is also reported that, in Turkey, the fermentation of 1000 L of ethanol could distilled 1 L of acetaldehyde and 5 L of fusel alcohol. They have used sugar beets in general for manufacturing of 32 million liters of ethanol every year (Anonymous, 2013). Similarly, slightly small quantities of 2.5 L were obtained for every 1000 L of ethanol production in Brazil. It also has been reported that the yield rate of fusel alcohol from fermentation process is commonly influenced by type of raw material used for molasses development, the conditions at which the fermentation takes place, method of distillation adapted and pouring of the oil (Patil et al., 2002; Patidar and Mahajani et al.,2012). Fig. 6 shows the chemical combination fusel alcohol which has been derived from corn molasses. In all the fusel alcohol generation, a simple distillation process based on the boiling point extraction would be more preferred rather than using complicated steps. This is mainly preventing the azeotrope formation during distillation process. Table 4 highlights the summery of fusel alcohol production from various feedstocks. The rate of acceleration of ethanol production would also results in higher fusel oil generation rate. It is also projected that the annual production rate of fusel oil was around 550 million liters in the year 2019 and more than 50% production is achieved in USA (Awad et al., 2017). In another research work, the fusel alcohol mainly contains isobutanol and isopentanol which can be produced from microalgae with the help of Escherichia coli microorganism through fermentation process. This fusel alcohol is very competitive and adhere all required qualities like superior energy density, lower corrosive behaviour and more importantly less soluble in water ( Liu et al., 2019). Fig. 7 shows the fusel alcohol production status by various countries as on 2019. There is no specific method is existing for fusel alcohol production and it is obtained as by-product during fermentation of all kinds of agricultural resources like plants, ounces, sweet potatoes, rice and other food grains."
17,Production of higher alcohols,"The major setbacks of shorter-chain alcohols are miscibility with water, difficult to evaporate and lower heat carrying capacity. In addition, these alcohols have superior boiling point, auto-ignition quality and energy density than ethanol. The energy density of various higher alcohols like, pentanol (34.65 MJ/kg), octanol (37.53 MJ/kg) and hexanol (39.11 MJ/kg) are nearly similar to the calorific value of gasoline (45.8 MJ/kg) and diesel (45.5 MJ/kg). On the other hand, the lubricity, viscosity and surface stability are better when compared to low carbon chain alcohols. Till date, the production of low carbon alcohols is mainly occurring from food related resources and the utilization of non-food related feedstocks might take few years for large scale development. An important advantage of higher alcohol is their ability to blend with diesel and gasoline also. In last few years, several attempts have been made to develop various higher alcohols like pentanol, hexanol, octanol and few others. Therefore, the various production pathways towards higher alcohols are explained in this section. Most of the higher alcohol productions are carried out using Escherichiacoli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae microorganisms and Clostridium species through fermentation pathway. However, the lack of knowledge on microbial production and lack of ideas on genetic tools have prevented them from wider applications. In a research work, a 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2-EH) could be produced from ethanol via Guerbet reaction with the help of bifunctional catalyst. It is estimated that 1.757 kg of Ethanol from biomass could develop one kg of 2-EH with suitable other inputs. With addition of external amino acid to the fermentative substrate, the possibility of higher alcohol production is extremely higher. It is also clearly evident that the pH value of substrate during fermentation reaction and addition of mineral salts inside the fermentative reactor are playing crucial role in solventogenesis process and these might result in improvement of bio-alcohols production. A brief summary of various higher alcohol productions is listed in Table 5 . In recent years, conversion of syngas into alcohols is achieved via catalytic transformation with significant catalysis reactions from Cu–Zn catalyst, ZnAl2O4 and zeolite mordenite (H-MOR) (He et al., 2019). Valero et al. (2002) pointed out that the higher alcohol production using microalgae via fermentation reaction with Saccharomyces cerevisiae as yeast. They pointed out that the initial injection of oxygen during the process could increase the yield rate when compared to without oxygen support and this has resulted in annual yield rate of 340 million liters per year. Furthermore, the addition of amino acids along with desired level of nitrogen might increase the alcohol production which is more suitable for aircraft application also. Interestingly, the flow rate of substrate and average pH are acting as dominant role in higher alcohol generation when the continuous fermentation process is used for synthesis gas conversion (Sizov et al., 2017). From the above discussions, it can be concluded that the fermentative technique using E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae microorganisms could increase the higher alcohol production at large scale level compared to non-fermentative pathway. To valorize the carbon foot prints to value added products, microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is one of the sustainable processes (Mohan et al., 2016; Aryal et al., 2017). Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) stimulates the microbes to make electrical contacts with electrodes in a fuel cell setup for the production of biofuels by using the bacteria or enzymes as catalyst. The effect of microbe is a self-regenerating catalyst that has long-term stability and biocompatibility which make the processes very advantages. The bio-electrochemical redox reactions exchange the electron to the solid electron acceptors to catalyze CO2 into alcohols through Wood-Ljungdahl route (Lewis and Nocera, 2006; Lovley and Nevin, 2013; Rabaey et al., 2005; Rabaey and Rozendal, 2010). In this process the charge transfer may occur outside of the cell via the outer membrane (Patil et al., 2012; Logan, 2008; Ehrlich, 2008). It is one of the versatile methods for the production of produce lower chain organic acids like acetic acid, butyric acid through the enriched acetogens (Modestra et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2013). This technique is an effective way of increasing carbon chain length for the production of ethanol and butanol etc. An experimental study reported that ethanol and butanol production of 45% and 16% of total products with 21 g/L of alcohol is observed using mixed culture as inoculum (Srikanth et al., 2018). The conversion of CO2 into alcohols is also achieved using pure cultures like Clostridium ljungdahlii, Moorella thermoacetica, Sporomusa ovata, etc., and some mixed cultures are (Modestra et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2012; Mohanakrishna et al., 2010)."
18,Production of ethers,"Ethers are considered to be the potential alternative fuels for partial or complete replacement of petroleum products due to their significant benefits like clean burning ability with extreme low NOx and PM emissions. Among the available Ethers, the dimethyl ether (DME) and diethyl ethers (DEE) are the most commonly used alternative fuels for diesel engine whereas the derivative forms of ethers like methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (ETBE) are preferred as anti-knocking agent for petrol engine applications. These ethers have superior volatile behaviour, better combustion ability and also have better storage ability like other gaseous fuels etc.. There can be many feedstocks for DME production through renewable form of biomasses using direct route or indirect route. In addition, the dehydration of methanol is also one of the possible methods for DME production. However, the dehydration process is highly effective at low temperature level (Preferably 150–300 °C) and this is due to the fact that the reaction being taking place as exothermic form. Moreover, there are greater numbers of by-products that are formed during methanol dehydration like ethylene, hydrogen, carbon monoxide etc. It has been reported that the Brazil has developed 0.37 ton of DME from 1 ton of dry wood biomass. In similar way, Brazil has also generated about 92.5 thousand tons of DME from 250 thousand tons of sugarcane biomass in the year 2004–05. The conversion ability of biomass into DME is highly influenced by solid based catalysts like zeolite and γ-alumina (Al2O3). Furthermore, the addition of Cu–ZnO or SiO2 catalyst with Al2O3 at suitable composition might enhance the production rate of DME up to 34–52%. However, the water removal is the biggest concern for these catalysts utilization due to the possible backward reaction and the reduction in methanol dehydration rate (Armenta et al., 2020). Another method for DME is the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in which nearly 68.5 mt/day could be possible at economically viable rate (Matzen and Demirel., 2016). Another common feature of direct synthesis of DME is about utilization of bi-functional catalyst as it is the combination of two mode of catalyst (metallic side and acidic side) for direct conversion of DME through methanol dehydration. The CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) are the very attractive techniques that have been getting wider attention in recent times due to their greenhouse gas reduction and changes in the global environment. Through these methods, it is quite possible to develop DME via hydrogenation process from methanol or reforming process from syngas. The summary of ethers production from various resources is listed in Table 6 . A combined approach of anaerobic digestion along with pyrolysis process could be considered for the generation of DME through development of CO2 and methane gases where the organic rich based biomass is the possible feedstock. Similarly, the Diethyl ether (DEE) is also being developed by many possible ways like dehydration of ethanol and also in the form of by-product during ethanol synthesis ( Phung and Busca 2015 ). The dehydration of ethanol depends on type of catalyst used for the chemical reaction and the required reaction temperature. It is also interesting to note that the acidic form of solid catalyst is shown higher yield rate when compared to other catalysts. Several catalysts like zeolite, Alumina, molybdophosphoric acid (MPA) and silica supported tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) are the common catalysts which have yielded higher DEE during the production process. It is also well-known fact that the reaction temperature is around 48–200 °C for better yield rate. It is also interesting to note that the increasing trend in reaction temperature would damage the yield rate especially when the temperature is moves beyond 250 °C. Interestingly, the hybrid conversion technique has been successfully used for other forms of ethers through dehydration of ethanol."
19,Challenges and limitations in alcohol productions,"Alcohols are of budding attention to all the governments in the current century as there is an emergent requirement which need to generate as renewable energy under economically feasible rate. There are few issues that need to be addressed in common before adapting any kind of alcohol as transportation fuel like acute land requirement, shortage of food products and impact on environment (Yao et al., 2012). However, an effective utilization of land for alcohol feedstocks could make significant balance the greenhouse gas (GHG) generation also (Stephen and Periyasamy, 2018; Da Silva Trindade and dos Santos, 2017). The various challenges occurred in all these alcohol productions are depicted in Fig. 8 . For all the alcohol production, there is an exponential debate between food productions versus fuel development. In most of the processes, the unexpected and uphill raise in feedstock cost could influence the production cost. It is also noticed that all the alcohol production processes still make significant damages on eco-friendly nature and environment. Huge water requirement is another major cause which may increase the water scarcity also. Most of the production pathways involved desired temperature and different heating rate which directly increase the power consumption rate. Even though most of the alcohol production techniques deals with CO2 capturing capability, the expected reduction of GHG is still need further improvement. All the production methods are experimented on small scale approaches. However, there is need of enormous supply of biomass for continuous development. In particular, the pyrolysis process is one of the main processes for alcohol development which requires rapid capital investment and huge energy consumption also. Many conversion processes for alcohol production have resulted in low conversion rate. Harvesting of algal biomass in required quantity at economically viable rate is the biggest challenge in third generation of alcohol production. The pre-treatment techniques which are generally used in alcohol developments need to be extended at economically viable condition. Large amount of agricultural land requires for the cultivation of lignocellulose biomass. In some of the fermentation reaction, even the accumulation of sugars itself preventing enzyme activities and this is a major setback in alcohol production. Even though significant research outputs have been obtained in recent times on bio-alcohols production from algae resources, still there is a deficiency in understanding of algal growth and metabolism. Formulation of cytotoxicity in the host cells due to accumulation of biofuel metabolites is another major challenge. The low yield rate of butanol would also make significant contribution in final production cost. Knowledge of genetic tools for all the microorganisms is very poor due to which the biofuel generations of very stringent and moving in narrow down direction. There is a lack of correlation between supply chain and the issues towards sustainable development of alcohols. Therefore, a proper integration technique needs to be adopted otherwise, it may harmful to climate, communal and pecuniary factors also. Methanol production from syngas is obtained in highly adulterated form which may increase the cost of cleaning process also. Lack of studies or infect no studies on production of alcohols from waste food resources. Storage of all kinds of feedstocks and its transportation to the production site is another huge task and this might be resulting in higher operational cost as well. The variation of inherent composition of feedstocks can make significant influence on production of alcohols. Small scale production of alcohols with empowerment of decentralization is significantly lacking. There are no transparent policies on alcohols development from various resources from governments all over the word which formulate the gap between expected and demand of fuels. Improper harmonization between various statuary bodies in any country would certainly delay the biofuels development. There is also poor waste management system all over the world, especially the collection and segregation of all waste feedstocks to the required level. Repeated changes towards waste management guidelines, strategic plans and campaigns would certainly affect the alcohol production rate. The production of alcohols in bio-form under profitable manner is highly impossible based in the present scenario. In few alcohol productions, the recovery of alcohol itself needs huge energy demand and it is also not possible under economically viable rate. The presence of water and gum in fusel alcohol is need to be controlled by suitable method in order to improve its utility in IC engine applications. Discarding fusel alcohol in atmosphere after usage is an undesirable one due to severe damage in the environment."
20,Summary and conclusions,"Raising demand on renewable energy and eco-friendly ambient for human and other livings lead to the investigation of sustainable biofuels as viable alternative to the fossil resources. In addition, the fluctuation in oil prices also prompt biofuels generation at economically feasible rate. Alcohols are the important candidates as alternative fuels for automotive sectors in near future due to its multiple resources for production, wide range of waste feedstocks and more importantly simple or complex development techniques. Besides, the physical and chemical properties of alcohols are highly favourable to spark ignition engine and compression ignition engines for their usage in slight form or huge form. Therefore, this comprehensive review provides a viable platform to gather the knowledge on sustainable alcohols production methodologies and possible improvement in production sector at reasonable prices. The production of methanol, ethanol and butanol is observed to be varied from the same feed stock since the mechanism of the valorisations varies for each product (Tables 1–3). Majority of the lignocellulosic biomass is composed of biological polymers which are of highly recalcitrant structure and strongly associated with each other by covalent and hydrogen bonds, hence cleaving depends on several factors. The cellulosic possesses properties such as biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, stereoregularity, and reactive hydroxyl groups, the hemicellulose consists of short chains of different polysaccharides such as xylan, galactomannan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, glucomannan, and xyloglucan and lignin links the cellulose and hemicellulose covalently. These properties of feed stocks vary the yield of the product to be synthesis and it also depends on several factors such as pre-treatment methods, catalyst used, extraction methods etc. However, lots of scopes are there for making significant improvement in production aspects of alcohols. Various possible remedies for the improvement of alcohol production have been listed in Fig. 9 . In this review, the production aspects of alcohols have been compared based on maximum possible yield rate from several feedstocks which is depicted in Fig. 10 . From the figure, it is noted that production of methanol from agricultural waste through gasification technique would produce higher yield then followed by ethanol production from sorghum juice using fermentation technique. Furthermore, sugarcane molasses would offer better yield of bio-butanol with possible yield of 40 g/L. On the other hand, the fusel alcohol production from algae would be best method with possible yield rate of 5 g/L. From the insight review on alcohol production from various possible methods, the following conclusions are drawn from this comprehensive review; • With proper genetic engineering method, the insertion of Clostridia gene in reactor would ultimately produce the scope of higher yield rate. • Rapid utilization of E. coli, S. cerevisiae organisms with highly integrated pre-treatment and upstream methods could enhance the production of butanol at economically viable rate. • Need of cordial integrative approaches among government, research organizations and industries are necessary for effective implementation of fermentation and extraction techniques. • Further life cycle analysis and assessment need to be continuously carried out for various waste resources feedstocks. • An effective storage system and viable transportation are very much essential for movement of waste resources from place to place • There are no effective government policies on alcohols generation at reasonable cost. Therefore, the policy makers have to develop relevant policies for commercial usage. • The hybrid production techniques need to be developed with integrated approaches for developing economically viable form of ethers from alcohols."
