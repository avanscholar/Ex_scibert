0,Introduction,"The world orange production has passed over 64.9 million tons, however, 19 million tons of those could be processed in 2009/2010 season [1]. When orange fruits are processed in the juice production, 50–70% of their weight is thrown out as waste consisting of peel, membrane, vesicles, seeds, etc. The waste is generally used as dairy cattle feed or compost [1,2]. Nevertheless it causes a significant pollution with phenolic compounds and huge landscape occupation whilst holding. Actually, orange peel has a noticeable economic value. One of the most valuable orange peel products is its essential oil. Raw orange peel has 1.45±0.16mL essential oil per kg according to Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC). Essential oil which produced from orange peel is a low-cost and abundant material and includes many components are used in synthesis of some food, cleaning, cosmetic, drug, etc. chemicals [2,3]. Indeed, orange peel essential oil may include upwards of 200 components depending on sort and maturity of the orange, kind of extraction and separation processes [4]. Though approximately 90–95% of the essential oil are terpenes. However, compounds which create essential oil’s special character are mainly oxygenated derivatives of terpenes. Besides these, there can be also nitrogenous or sulfuric compounds in the oil. On the other hand, terpenes generally decompose under the sway of heat, light and/or air [5]. More valuable products can be synthesized in consequence of terpene transformations through hydrogenation, oxidation, isomerization/rearrangement, hydration, hydroformylation, condensation, cyclization, ring contraction, etc. Especially, more favorable and high-price compounds like p-cymene can be manufactured with catalytic transformations of compounds like limonene which is in the orange peel essential oil in the ratio of about 90%. It was proposed that limonene tends to turn into monocyclic terpenes like terpinenes and terpinolenes. It is dissociated into menthenes and cymenes as final products. The dissociation needs space volume because of bimolecular reaction, so it is limited by process progressing on microporous heterogeneous catalysts [6]. p-Cymene can be added in inks, adhesives, varnishes, pigments, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, allaying foul industrial smells, producing cresol and some products that are normally obtained from petroleum-based compounds. p-Cymene is conventionally produced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation of toluene with propene or 2-propanol. In default of toluene, benzene can be used with methyl and isopropyl halides. This operation is processed in company with acid catalysts like HCl containing AlCl3, HF, BF3 or H2SO4. Because of chemicals are used, current production of p-cymene is highly polluting, unhealthy and destructive. Using of zeolite supported catalysts can overcome the acidic problem, however by-products like n-propyltoluen, m- or o-cymene are formed substantially in that time. Instead of this process, p-cymene production can be occurred by the way of transformations of compounds that generated via isomerization or hydrogenation as well as limonene dehydrogenation directly [7]. Nickel or palladium supported by carbon or alumina, platinum supported by carbon, chromium oxide with/without copper or zinc oxide, Fuller’s earth, copper-nickel, activated alumina, heteropolyacid H5PMo10V2O40 are some catalysts that are used on dehydrogenation of terpenes [8]. Brönsted acid sites are not functional in the matter of p-cymene production because of its low selectivity. On the other hand, Pd or CaO have high conversion rate and selectivity in the acceptable reaction conditions. Onto CaO catalyst, it was claimed that only limonene dehydrogenation to p-cymene took place and its conversion rate was up to 98% and selectivity was about 100%. When it comes to base catalysts, Mg/Al hydrotalcides are neither active nor selective [7]. With effects of carbocation mechanism on the acid sites, p-cymene selectivity is quite low in the end of multiple reactions. Thus dominant trend is using catalysts which are not acidic [9,10]. p-Cymene production from limonene can be carried out via isomerization and hydrogen transfer on acid sites, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation on metallic sites or transformation on both acidic and metallic sites [6]. It was suggested that p-cymene selectivity of limonene transformations onto acidic catalysts can be increased via using an alkali element like Na+ [11,12]. Besides, existences of α-olefins as H2 acceptors in the reaction media improve the p-cymene selectivity of silica supported Pd catalysts [13]. It had been seen that hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalysts were active and selective in the p-cymene production processes from limonene. p-Cymene selectivity has been enhanced up to 97% under favour of Cr2O3, CuO, ZnO, ZrO2, MgO, La2O3, ThO2, and C supported Pd doped with Se catalysts [14,15]. Titanium oxide catalyst overperformed than silica and alumina supported catalysts in the matter of product yield and p-cymene selectivity [7]. It was claimed that p-cymene also was synthesized in the ratio of 19.5% as a result of H2 disproportionation mechanism while polymerization of limonene with catalytic effect of silicophosphoric acid [16]. Industrial dipentene vapor that includes 36.9% limonene was fed into a packed bed reactor with H2 under atmospheric pressure at 200°C. On HZSM-5 catalyst with Brönsted acid sites, only limonene cracking reaction was occurred but on Al/SBA-15 catalyst with Lewis-Brönsted acid sites, it was produced that p-cymene as the dehydrogenation product and toluene as the cracking product. Zn/SBA-15 has Lewis acid sites and is more stable and more selective for p-cymene. It was found that dipentene conversion rate has been up to 98.2% and selectivity of p-cymene has been up to 88.3% [17]. In the study of [18], dipentene transformation was performed with Cu/Ni formate. While essential oil that had obtained from turpentine was boiling, addition of the catalyst was about 2% by weight of the oil. In the end of 8h, product that was gained from condenser contained 2 units (p-, o- and m- isomers of) cymene and 1 unit menthane of every 3 units. According to [9,10], p-cymene selectivity was smaller than selectivities of m- and o-cymene when hydroisomerization proceeded on through Pd-on-ZSM-5 but in case of same reaction was fulfilled on zeolite Y, the selectivities were similar. Despite this, supporting with Ce improved the p-cymene selectivity up to 60.1%. It was also established that Ce addition to zeolite supported Pd catalyst not only prevents to transalkylation reactions and catalyst poisoning but also improves the p-cymene selectivity during dehydrogenation. Pd parts of catalyst can give rise to isomerization reaction by the way of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation mechanism. Pt and Pd catalysts were investigated by Bogel-Łukasic et al. [19–21] for limonene hydrogenation. As reported by those studies, Pt has a higher activity than Pd but also it is more unstable because its metal part shows a tendency to poisoning and being washed away. It was studied that alkanes can be generated via hydrodeoxigenation of lipids or stearic acid with released H2 following the limonene dehydrogenation into p-cymene in [22,23] on the purpose of bio-jet fuel production. Pd/HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5 structures have higher conversion ratios for limonene and stearic acid. However it was suggested that the more H2 addition to the atmosphere, the less p-cymene selectivity because of hydrogenation dominance. Supercritical fluid technology is an eligible and effective technology for chemical transformation of essential oils’ compounds, specially. Its some benefits are lasting a short time, finishing with high efficiency, expediting transport phenomena, reducing catalyst poisoning and not affecting quality of the essential oil adversely through the agency of its own characteristic properties [24–26]. In a heterogeneous catalysis, the interaction between reactant(s) and the active surface of catalyst is normally limited by concentration(s) of the reactant(s) around the catalyst. Furthermore, resistance against mass-transfer for transport is strong at interphase boundaries of materials in the adsorption-desorption processes. When a supercritical fluid is used as the reaction media, single-phase mixture around the catalyst removes these problems. Using of supercritical fluids accelerates the catalytic processes and intensifies the reactivities via enrichments of solubility and diffusivity [27]. Also, supercritical alcohols are in the most interesting supercritical fluids. The critical points of ethanol (240.7°C and 6.137MPa) and 2-propanol (235.1°C and 4.762MPa) are relatively mild conditions for organic reactions [24]. Besides, ethanol can be produced from orange peel with fermentation process [3]. In this work, chemical transformation of orange peel essential oil was studied in the supercritical conditions of ethanol and 2-propanol. Moreover, the effects of temperature, pressure and reaction time on the content of the reaction product were investigated using Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 10-Fold i.e. 10 times-concentrated orange peel essential oil was used during the experiments. Before the studies, the oil had been obtained from a commercial firm and was stocked in a refrigerated polypropylene container. Compounds in the orange peel oil according to its GC–MS analysis are given in Table 1 . The feeds were prepared by diluting the oil with absolute ethyl and isopropyl alcohols (Merck Millipore) to 5% concentration. Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were supplied from Alfa Aesar. The weights of Pt/Al2O3 (d=1.961g/cm3), Pd/Al2O3 (d=2.783g/cm3) and Ni/Al2O3 (d=3.028g/cm3) used in the reactor were 30.396g, 35.759g and 36.982g and their shapes were in spherical form, in cylindrical form, and in a special four-roomed cylindrical form, respectively. SEM photos of the catalysts are showed in Fig. 1 . XRF spectrums that indicate the content analyses of the catalysts were obtained using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 2 )."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The scheme of experimental system is given in Fig. 3 . Feed was injected by means of a high-pressure pump (Autoclave Engineers Series III) whose flow rate was adjusted to reaction conditions. Maximum flow rate of the pump is 10mL/min. If flow rate calculated for a specific condition is more than 10mL/min, two pumps can be operated in parallel. The feed flow rates that are regulated for the chosen reaction time, which is the amount of time the solution spends inside the reactor, were calculated according to Eq. (1). Helicoid pre-heating line (50cm×4.35mm Ø) and straight packed bed reactor (10cm×2cm Ø) were heated in a PID controlled split furnace (Protherm SPT 11/70/750). The temperature of the essential oil-alcohol solution was provided to reach the desired value by passing through a pre-heating zone, before coming upon the catalyst in the reactor. As soon as reaction finished, the solution was cooled by an exchanger on the way out. The system pressure was pegged at the desired value in a sensibility of ±0.5MPa by a back pressure regulator (GO Regulator Inc.). From the feed pump to the back pressure regulator, all wet parts of the system were made of 316 SS. The liquid products left the regulator was taken into a glass tube. Then, the solvent was separated from the oil with a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Laborota 4000) equipped with a vacuum pump. The oil product was kept in refrigerator until the gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of it was done. For that analysis, Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatography and 5975C XL Inert MSD Mass Spectrometry devices were operated. The aim of the analysis is that components and their percentages of the samples are become known."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The liquid samples were analyzed by using Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatography coupled with 5975C XL Inert MSD Mass Spectrometry. For the analysis, HP-INNOWax column (60m×0.25mm Ø) whose stationary phase is polyethylene glycol with 0.25μm film thickness was employed. SEM images were obtained from scanning electron microscope (JEOL-5410LV) using Bath Scatter Electron Detector and Secondary Electron Detector."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The effects of catalysts on the products,"3.1 The effects of catalysts on the products Three different catalysts, namely Pt/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, and Ni/Al2O3, were employed in the packed bed reactor for the catalytic transformation reactions of limonene in supercritical alcohols. As seen on Fig. 4 , Ni/Al2O3 shown no activity on limonene conversion in those conditions, but nonetheless Ni was used effectively with HZSM-5 that a specific complex of zeolite support by Zhang and Zhao [22]. Except for this study, there is no work includes limonene transformation using a Ni catalyst. Hence it was understood that alumina support is more impotent than zeolite support when used with Ni. In the Pt/Al2O3 used experiments, it was seen that 10s reaction time was not enough for transformation of limonene, withal composition of the oil was not changed. Increasing of the reaction time resulted to reduction in the number of oil compounds, nevertheless limonene transformation occurred about 300°C as shown in Fig. 4. In other respects, Pt/Al2O3 is an effective catalyst if desideratum is just limonene decomposition at higher temperatures. It was seen that production of a special compound of the oil is not possible at the end of this decomposition in the experimental conditions. In Table 2 , a list of detected compounds after reactions over Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 in supercritical ethanol and 2-propanol. p-Cymene is main product in all reaction conditions. Except limonene and p-cymene, other all compounds are intermediate products or components formed via undesired reactions over the catalysts. As seen Table 2, much more compounds were produced via undesired reactions Pt/Al2O3 in SC-ethanol. In those catalysts, Pd/Al2O3 was stated as the most effective catalyst in the experimental conditions. Owing to Pd/Al2O3, it was achieved that conversion of limonene was up to 100% in very short times as much as 10s (Fig. 4). Consequently, thanks to this catalyst, p-cymene was gained as the most quickly and the most selectively in nearly all conditions studied. With respect to [28], isomerization activity of Pd catalyst is larger when supporting with alumina than with carbon by contrast with hydrogenation activity in line with our study. In the study of [11], Pd catalysts that were supported with different silica structures were investigated for the p-cymene selectivity in points of temperatures, pressures and carrier gases. According to their results, it was attained that 100% conversion rate and 99% selectivity in 3h while our process got result in seconds. Contrary to [21], Pd catalyst did not spend any time for activation in advance of reactions. Martin-Luengo et al. were found that Ni, Fe, and Mn contained sepiolites more effective than additive-free one in respect to conversion and p-cymene selectivity. Sepiolite with Na additive was inactive due to obstruction of pores with Na molecules [29]. Though negligible acidic silica supported catalysts did not worked, a bit more acidic alumina supported catalyst showed significantly low performance than titania supported catalysts [7]."
7,The effects of temperature and reaction time on the products,"3.2 The effects of temperature and reaction time on the products Reaction time in supercritical phase was scaled in accordance with the equation written below: (1) τ = V R e a c t o r F * ρ S C ( T , P ) ρ L where VReactor is space volume of the reactor in mL, F is volumetric flow rate of feed in mL/s, ρSC is fluid density in a specific supercritical condition and ρL is fluid density at pump in laboratory condition in g/mL. The reaction media was formed with dilute mixtures of essential oil in ethanol or 2-propanol above the critical temperature and pressure. Densities of liquid in the pump and of supercritical fluid in the reactor were assumed to be those of pure alcohol. In the experiments with Pt/Al2O3, limonene decomposition was seen over the 280°C after reaction time of 30s (Figs. 4 and 5 ). Limonene ratio in the product decreased to 53.14% and 20.29% when the reaction time was increased from 30s to 50s in the reaction temperature of 340°C, respectively (Fig. 5). p-Cymene whose ratio was 0.02% in the raw material, came to 37.66% at 340°C rising after 280°C in the 50s reaction time. In this way, p-cymene was the main component at last point. Intermediate products formed during the reaction over Pt/Al2O3, which are α-terpinolene and 1-menthene, are seen in Fig. 6 . α-Terpinolene and 1-menthene were seen at lower temperatures before occurring of p-cymene in the 50s reaction time, when Figs. 5 and 6 are evaluated together. α-Terpinolene and 1-menthene were achieved up to 13.30% and 12% at the reaction temperature of 300°C and time of 50s, respectively (Fig. 6). Those were formed under 10% after upsurge of p-cymene at higher temperatures. The highest occurred terpenoid was linalool in all conditions. Its ratio was between 0.5–1.5%. Formation of α-terpinolene during the reaction shows that isomerization reactions occur at the Pt/Al2O3 catalyzed system in SC-ethanol. It can be seen that the reactions are serial reaction carried out via α-terpinolene and 1-menthene which are intermediate products. Fig. 7 shows possible reaction pathways over Pt/Al2O3 in SC-ethanol. Limonene isomerizes to terpinolene and hydrogenates to 1-menthene, and then each compound transform to p-cymene mutually. When the subject is activity of Pd/Al2O3, limonene ratio quickly decreased to 5.46% and p-cymene ratio increased to 80.74% at 340°C in the reaction time of 10s (Figs. 5 and 6). Aside from those compounds, only 1-menthene was descripted as a noticeable compound in the reaction time of 10s (Fig. 6). Limonene ratio of the product was 59.24% and p-cymene ratio of the product 19.02% at 245°C in the 30s reaction time (Fig. 5). 1-Menthene ratio was heightened up to 12.54% at 280°C and after that point, the ratio was almost lost like limonene ratio (Figs. 5 and 6). It was stated that p-cymene ratio was 82.82% and 86.40% at 340°C in the reaction times of 30s and 50s, respectively. Ratios of p-cymene, 1-menthene, and limonene were determined as 26.11%, 21.96%, and 17.78% even at 245°C, respectively. It was detected that there was a special point for composition of the product in the midst of 280°C and 300°C. It is assumed that the reaction is a serial reaction carried out via 1-menthene which is intermediate product. Possible reaction pathways over Pd/Al2O3 in SC-ethanol can be showed as Fig. 8 . With undesired reactions, it was observed that compounds such as 1-butanol, hexanol, 1-p-menthene and 3-p-menthene were formed. As shown in Fig. 8, isomerization reactions did not take place and compounds either got or gave H+ ion onto Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. In SC-ethanol medium, Pd/Al2O3 catalyst expedited p-cymene production. For this reason, reaction environment was neater than products of reaction worked Pt/Al2O3 in SC-ethanol. More stable composition was created and high efficiency was achieved quickly. Even though containing different components, isomerization was not appear because process finished fast with Pd/Al2O3 in SC-2- ethanol. p-Cymene selectivity according to other undesired compounds was calculated with Eq. (2). i in Eq. (2) represents total wt% of undesired compounds formed during the reaction [30]. (2) ∝ p − C y m e n e / i = w t % p − C y m e n e w t % i Fig. 9 indicates the influences of temperature on the p-cymene selectivity, and shows the selectivity in the reaction times of 10s, 30s and 50s over the Pd/Al2O3, and 50s over the Pt/Al2O3, respectively. Maximum p-cymene selectivity was observed in the reaction temperature of 300°C at the reaction time of 30s over the Pd/Al2O3. On the other hand, p-cymene selectivity over the Pt/Al2O3 was low generally because of many undesired compounds for all reaction conditions compared with Pd/Al2O3 (Table 2). According to Anikeev et al. [24], temperature increase enhances the transformations into saturated compounds, however hydrogenation got behind in isomerization and dehydrogenation mechanisms. Earliest formed compounds terpinolene and terpinene that are isomerization products. Limonene and the other components decomposed at nearly same time. p-Menthene, p-menthane, and p-cymene had slower increase rates. All these developments accelerated with temperature increase as compatible with [28,31]. In accordance with Anikeev [32], p-cymene selectivity did not fall behind other compounds with the influence of temperature. In the study of Kamitsou et al. [7], p-cymene selectivity induced to nearly 90% when the temperature was 300°C and unchanged with time-on-stream except for initial 5h onto TiO2 catalyst. Martin-Luengo et al. [29] were found that with Ni, Fe, and Mn contained sepiolites it was reached to 100% conversion in 20min and all of products were p-cymene since 5min. With advantages of supercritical phase, high conversion and selectivity were obtained in a short time."
8,The effects of pressure on the products,"3.3 The effects of pressure on the products One of the most important advantages of the supercritical fluids is that pressure can be used as an impressive adjusting parameter. For the comprehension of the pressure effect on the process, other parameters was fastened. Points to consider about choosing the temperature and the reaction time for the process are very important with regards to being suitable for purposes of using. Physical and chemical structures of the oil spoiled at the higher temperatures. On the other hand, limonene conversion was not adequate at the short reaction times. Due to these reasons, the temperature and the reaction time were chosen 300°C and 50s for the experiments of pressure scanning. As shown in Fig. 10 , while it was studying with Pt/Al2O3, increasing of the pressure up to 12.5MPa from 6.5MPa caused decreasing in the conversion of limonene, and limonene ratio increased from 63.53% to 79.85%. Consequently, the ratio of p-cymene in the reaction products was decreased to 1.75% from 8.32%. At 6.5MPa, ratios of α-terpinolene and 1-menthene which were intermediate products were also measured 14.70% and 12.33%, respectively. In addition, 1-butanol was 6.71% as another considerable compound. Different terpenoids also were identified with ratios of 1–2%. However the process acted inversely in the matter of limonene transformation under the higher pressures. Limonene ratio rose up to 79.85% and each one of other three components were below 5% under the pressure of 12.5MPa. In the product of reactions that progressed onto Pd/Al2O3 at the same conditions, pressure increasing to 12.5MPa increased limonene ratio from 1.42% to 12%. At the end of process which employed Pd catalyst, p-cymene was the main component under the higher pressures, its ratios were seen between 70% and 60% in the meanwhile limonene ratios were between 10% and 20%. It can be said that increment in the pressure caused slightly decreasing in the limonene conversion and p-cymene formation over both catalyst in SC-ethanol. On the other hand, pressure changed the intermediate steps as good as mentioned by Anikeev et al. [32]. Pressure did not affect the selectivity as stated by Ipatieff et al. [18] and Anikeev et al. [24]. In some studies, different atmospheres were investigated. For example, H2 and He atmospheres were almost identical in especially lower temperatures [7]. While adding of H2 to high pressure CO2 medium, limonene was faster hydrogenated to menthane and terpinene derivatives [31]. Similarly, H2 containing highly developed p-cymene selectivity in N2 atmosphere [23]. On the other hand, equally selective yield was reached without any gas enhancing limonene transformation in supercritical conditions. Besides, selectivity is tunable for a specific component only in supercritical phase."
9,The effects of supercritical alcohols on the products,"3.4 The effects of supercritical alcohols on the products Because permittivity of an alcohol decreases in the supercritical conditions, single-phase structure of essential oil/alcohol solution is supported [33]. In the supercritical conditions, 2-propanol was much better than ethanol as shown in Fig. 11 . Limonene only disappeared above the higher temperatures in the SC-ethanol at all reaction times. Limonene ratio in the product was 53.14% in the reaction time of 30s at 340°C. However, p-cymene existence depended on reaction time firstly and it occurred reaction time of 50s in that conditions. On the other side, SC-2-propanol created a gorgeous reaction medium on the subject of limonene and p-cymene compositions. Even in the mild temperatures like 300°C, limonene consumed totally and p-cymene composition exceeded the half of product. p-Cymene composition also constituted approximately 3/4 of the product volumes above the 300°C (Figs. 12 and 13 ). Homomorphic components like p-menthane, 1-menthene, and d-3-p-menthene abounded in product at lower temperatures until those were extinguished around end of limonene transformation. All the same, reaction time is another key parameter as mentioned above and as shown in Fig. 13. Specially, product composition changed markedly in the end of reactions over Pt/Al2O3 in SC-2-propanol. For example, compositions of 1-menthene, p-cymene, p-menthane, d-3-p-menthene, and limonene were 37.48%, 20.99%, and 20.39%, 10.15%, and 9.59% under 275°C in 30s, respectively. With extension of time to 50s at that point, p-cymene composition was as plentiful as 44.45% while p-menthane composition was increasing to 29.75%. p-Cymene selectivity according to those components are given in Fig. 14 . p-Cymene selectivity increased with increasing reaction temperature from 250°C to 350°C. In conclusion, it was observed that the longer chain length of alcohol the higher terpene conversion at the sufficient reaction times. SC-2-Propanol was not only more productive but also less selective than SC-ethanol as reported by Anikeev et al. [24,32]. According to Gubin and Buslaeva [34], supercritical alcohols also have an impact on hydrogenation differently. Indeed, hydrogenation ability of 2-propanol is higher than which of ethanol and methanol has less hydrogenating among them in supercritical conditions. Addition to this, p-menthane was a significant compound in SC-2-propanol medium (Fig. 15 .). For this reason, 2-propanol had a higher conversion rate but limited p-cymene selectivity at least for lower temperatures in supercritical conditions. Because degradation of long-chain alcohols is an effortless process, bonding between methyl groups are separated from alcohols and other compounds is possible. At that moment, methyl groups can transform into methylene groups and H+ ions consisted can accelerate hydrogenation process. Likewise, in the case of instability of structures in reaction medium, H+ ions which emergence as a result of dehydrogenation can participate to building of long-chain alcohols. With several methods like pH measurement, it can be understood that hydrogenous supercritical fluids perform not only as reaction media but also as reactants. For instance, ionic product of water so much more increase while processing in supercritical conditions. Ionic products of alcohols also expand above their critical points probably, if above-mentioned results are taken into account. One of the most important features of supercritical fluid systems is its wieldy selectivity. Enhancing of rate of a specific compound means reducing of rate of another compound. In this study, it is seen that p-cymene percentage in the oil increases against hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and isomerization products. In addition to all these, Ni/Al2O3 was an unsuitable catalyst for p-cymene production from limonene. According to Al2O3 is a useful support to Pd and Pt metals, Ni is non-utilizable metal for this purpose. Whereas especially 8.0MPa was optimum pressure value in reaction time of 30s and temperature of 300°C, temperature affected p-cymene selectivity positively all the while."
10,Conclusions,"Supercritical fluid technology can be very effective when used to create selective reaction media. In this paper, influences of temperature, pressure, and reaction time on limonene transformation in orange peel oil were investigated onto different heterogeneous catalysts in different supercritical alcohols. Main product of this transformation was p-cymene over all catalysts in every supercritical fluid. It was observed that Ni/Al2O3 was ineffective to the conversion of limonene or orange peel oil. However, when Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were used, the yield of p-cymene which was main product increased with increasing reaction temperature. Especially, when Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was used, it was detected that limonene converted completely and obtained p-cymene in yield of 80%. Furthermore, p-cymene selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 was much better compared with Pt/Al2O3. On the other hand, 2-propanol was more productive for p-cymene compared with ethanol as a supercritical solvent when Pt/Al2O3 catalyst used."
