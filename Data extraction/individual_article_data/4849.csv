0,Introduction,"Increasing concern about a global change in climate has brought about a substantial increase in the production of alternative fuels, which, when substituted for fossil fuels, have potential to reduce the net greenhouse gases emitted by anthropogenic activities. Biodiesel is one such alternative fuel, the production of which has expanded rapidly (Bozbas, 2008; Ayoub and Abdullah, 2012). Biodiesel is produced from plant or animal oils by the trans-esterification of triacyl glycerides with methanol or ethanol to produce a fatty acid methyl or ethyl ester, concomitantly producing glycerol as a by-product. The stoichiometry, of 1mol glycerol per 3mol biodiesel, is such that a substantial volume of glycerol is produced per unit volume of biodiesel (Thompson and He, 2006). The increase in the availability of glycerol caused by the expanding biodiesel market has brought about a glut of the crude material, the price of which has fallen 20-fold since 2002 to approximately $0.10/kg currently. Consequently, many producers of biodiesel discard glycerol as a waste (Johnson and Taconi, 2009), as it is no longer cost-effective to refine crude glycerol sufficiently for sale. In the EU, it is generally classified as a hazardous waste, because of its contamination with methoxide, thereby increasing the cost of disposal (Johnson and Taconi, 2009; EU directive 2000/76/EC). Many routes for exploiting crude glycerol as a cheap feedstock have been explored (Posada et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012; Leoneti et al., 2012), amongst which hydrogen production using the photofermentative bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris has been prominent (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009; Ghosh et al., 2011, 2012; Pott et al., 2013). While the photofermentative production of hydrogen by purple non-sulphur bacteria has been known for several decades (Gest and Kamen, 1949), the use of crude glycerol as a substrate has only recently been demonstrated (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009), because compounds such as organic acids have been more frequently investigated (Pott et al., 2013). However, the use of glycerol as a substrate has shown significant promise (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009; Ghosh et al., 2011, 2012; Pott et al., 2013). This recent work has demonstrated the generation of up to 90% of the stoichiometric maximum, i.e. 6.3mol of hydrogen out of a potential 7mol of hydrogen per mol of glycerol (Pott et al., 2013), as shown in the stoichiometric equation below: C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 7 H 2 + 3 CO 2 . However, whilst R. palustris readily metabolises glycerol to generate hydrogen, inhibition of growth and hydrogen production is observed when crude glycerol generated from biodiesel production is used instead of pure glycerol (Pott et al., 2013; Ghosh et al., 2012). The interference of contaminants in crude glycerol (CG) with both biological and chemical production of hydrogen is a common theme in the literature, with many possible routes to exploitation hindered by one or more of the contaminating components (Chatzifragkou and Papanikolaou, 2012; Yang et al., 2012). These contaminants include sodium hydroxide, methanol or ethanol, saponified fatty acids (SFAs), incompletely-converted acyl glycerides, various salts and trace components (Hu et al., 2012; Thompson and He, 2006). However, the inhibition of growth of R. palustris on crude glycerol appears to be largely due to SFAs (Pott et al., 2013), although no work has been done to characterise the concentrations of SFAs at which this organism is inhibited. An understanding of the levels of SFAs which cause inhibition of growth, and development of methods for removing these inhibitory soaps are essential for the development of a biological process for producing hydrogen by this organism. Several methods for purifying CG have been suggested in the literature, including vacuum distillation, removal of salts by alcohol precipitation, adsorption of contaminants on activated carbon, pH adjustment and solvent extraction (Kovács, 2011; Anand and Saxena, 2012; Rehman et al., 2008; Sarma et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2010; Manosak and Limpattayanate, 2011). However, it is unclear which of these methods is appropriate for application in a biological process for producing hydrogen. The first objective of this study was to examine the inhibition of R. palustris by SFAs, in order to understand the concentrations of soap tolerated by the organism. The second objective was to examine the applicability of methods of soap removal suggested in the literature, specifically: (i) pH adjustment, (ii) various treatments to precipitate soap, (iii) adsorption on activated carbon, and (iv) solvent extraction. These published techniques were compared with a novel precipitation method adapted from our previous work (Pott et al., 2013). In order to assess each method’s applicability in a hydrogen production process using R. palustris, the third objective was to quantify the SFA removal efficiency for each method and determine the growth and hydrogen production rates of R. palustris on each treated CG."
1,Experimental,
2,Bacterial strains and growth conditions,"2.1 Bacterial strains and growth conditions The purple non-sulphur bacterium R. palustris (NCIMB 11774) was used for all experiments. The growth medium consisted of: (per litre) 0.2g yeast extract, 1.7g K2HPO4, 1.7g KH2PO4, 0.2g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05g CaCl2·2H2O, 0.4g NaCl, 0.15g Na2S2O3, 0.005g ferric citrate, 0.002g para-aminobenzoic acid and 1ml of trace element solution containing: (per litre) 70mg ZnCl2, 100mg MnCl2·4H2O, 60mg H3BO3, 200mg CoCl2·6H2O, 20mg CuCl2·2H2O, 20mg NiCl2·6H2O and 40mg NaMoO4·2H2O. To the growth medium was also added 1ml of vitamin solution containing: (per litre) 1.2g thiamine HCl and 0.01g cyanocobalamin, filtered sterile. The pH of the growth medium was adjusted using HCl and NaOH to pH 7.4±0.1. For continuous pre-culture, the above growth medium was supplemented with pure glycerol and sodium glutamate to give final concentrations of 50mM and 10mM, respectively. Cultures were grown anaerobically under an argon atmosphere, in 100ml conical flasks, which were sealed and agitated by a magnetic stirrer and flea and illuminated by fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs (Sylvania, standard F15W/35-535) giving about 50–60μmol photons/m2/s (Skye Instruments Quantum Sensor). For an inoculum, 1ml of pre-culture in late exponential phase (optical density (OD) ∼1) was used. Each experiment was repeated between 3 and 5 times to determine standard deviation, which is displayed as error bars on the figures."
3,Purification of crude glycerol,"2.2 Purification of crude glycerol The crude glycerol used was obtained from R. L. Skelton, University of Cambridge, and was derived from a pilot plant producing biodiesel by the transesterification of canola oil with methanol, catalysed by sodium hydroxide. Titration curves were prepared for the following materials: (i) crude glycerol (CG), diluted to 50vol% with deionised water to prevent the sample becoming too viscous, (ii) a solution of 300mM pure sodium oleate and (iii) 50vol% CG in deionised water with the SFAs removed by calcium precipitation, as described below. The curves were produced by titrating 200ml of sample with 2.5M HCl. After each addition of acid the pH was read using a pH metre (Mettler-Toledo, MP220) and recorded. CG purification by treatment with activated carbon was performed in several steps. Initially, the pH was lowered to pH 1 by the addition of 12M HCl. The lighter, fatty-acid phase was removed by decanting after centrifugation at 5000×g for 5min. The pH of the remaining glycerol-rich phase was then increased to pH 7 by the addition of 3M NaOH. A volume of ethanol equal to the volume of glycerol, after adjustment to pH 7, was added to the glycerol and the mixture cooled to 4°C. The solution was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10min to remove any precipitated salts. The ethanol, and any remaining methanol, was then evaporated off by heating in a water bath at 90°C overnight. Activated carbon was added to the remaining glycerol at a ratio of 1g activated carbon per 100ml glycerol. This was agitated for 2h, and then centrifuged at 5000×g for 5min and the supernatant filtered through a 0.44μm syringe filter to remove any remaining carbon particles. SFA removal by reduction of pH was performed by adding the required volume, between 0 and 1.2ml, of 12M HCl to 25ml of CG and 25ml of deionised water. This mixture was vortexed for 1min and centrifuged at 5000×g for 5min. If two phases were formed the lower, glycerol-rich, layer was separated from the free fatty acid layer by decanting. The glycerol-rich phase, or the unsegregated CG if no phase separation occurred, was then analysed for fatty acid content, using the assay described in Section 2.4. The solvent extraction of SFA was conducted as described by Anand et al. (2012), with some modification to determine if the efficacy was dependent on pH. Briefly, equal volumes of 50vol% CG, hexane and various volumes, between 0 and 1.2ml, of 12M HCl were added to a Falcon tube, which was then continuously agitated for 2h. The Falcon tube was then centrifuged at 5000×g for 5min and the glycerol-rich phase separated from the hexane phase by decanting. Both phases were then analysed for fatty acid content. This washing protocol was repeated twice more, analysing the phases for fatty acid on each occasion. The precipitation of SFAs as calcium salts was performed by adding 25ml of CG to 25ml of the appropriate molarity CaCl2 or Ca(NO3)2 solutions (between 0 and 1M). This solution was vortexed for 2min, and then filtered through 0.44μm filter paper. The resulting filtrates were then analysed for fatty acid concentration."
4,Determination of rates of growth and of hydrogen production,"2.3 Determination of rates of growth and of hydrogen production Cultures were grown on CG treated with the methods described in Section 2.2, either in 100ml flasks to measure growth or in 500ml bottles to measure hydrogen production rates. The amount of treated CG added per culture was standardised to the amount of glycerol added, so that the final glycerol concentration in each culture would be 50mM. To achieve this, to 100ml of medium, 0.9ml of either the pH treated, adsorption treated, calcium treated samples or 0.36ml of pure glycerol were added along with 0.25ml of 2M sodium glutamate, to give a final concentration of 10mM. These cultures were then monitored by OD to determine growth characteristics. In experiments testing the inhibition of growth by SFAs, cultures of R. palustris were grown in a CaCl2-free medium with 50mM glycerol and 10mM glutamate, supplemented with various concentrations of sodium oleate or sodium stearate, being representative of the SFAs most often found in CG (Ramos et al., 2009). CaCl2 was omitted from the medium to prevent precipitation of the soap from solution. Similarly, cultures were cultivated in 500ml bottles, as described above, to determine hydrogen production rates from the various treated CGs. Once again, each culture was standardised to the concentration of glycerol, by adding either 4.5ml of the pH treated, calcium treated, or adsorption treated crude glycerol or 1.8ml of pure glycerol with 1.25ml of 2M sodium glutamate. The gas production of these cultures was determined by displacement of water, as described above, and the hydrogen concentration determined by gas chromatography as described in Section 2.4. The 500ml glass bottles were fitted with airtight screw-lids, which contained two sample ports for the collection of gas and liquid. The irradiance was kept approximately constant at 150–180μmol photons/m2/s by incandescent lights (Sylvania, Satin 100W, measured with a Skye Instruments Quantum Sensor). As with the flasks, each port for the removal of liquid was sealed with a tube clamp. In order to collect any gas produced, each gas port was extended to an inverted glass measuring cylinder filled with water and submerged in a water bath, where the cumulative volume of gas produced could be measured by the displacement of water. For all experiments, the medium, glassware, rubber stoppers and rubber tubing were autoclaved at 121°C and 2bar (absolute) for 30min prior to inoculation. In order to create an oxygen- and nitrogen-free atmosphere, the cultures were sparged with argon for 10min and the flasks sealed with a rubber stopper containing two sample pipes, one each to sample the gas phase and the liquid culture. For each flask, a 20ml leuer lock syringe was attached to the gas phase sample port to allow any gas produced to be collected, and to relieve pressure within the flask. Each liquid culture port was sealed with a tube clamp to prevent any ingress of air. Periodically, the OD of the cell suspension was determined using a spectrophotometer (Thermospectronic UV1). The dry cell mass was correlated with the OD at 660nm, as described by Pott et al. (2013). In these experiments, the maximum growth rate in the exponential phase, μmax , was determined by plotting ln(n) versus t, where n is the biomass concentration at time t. The slope of this plot gives the maximum specific growth rate at these conditions, μmax , provided the substrate is in excess and the growth is exponential. The error in each reported value was determined by taking the standard deviation of several repeats of the same growth conditions."
5,Analytical,"2.4 Analytical Concentrations of hydrogen gas produced were analysed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph fitted with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) with nitrogen as the carrier gas, through a 1.2m Hayesep 13X 45/60 column fitted with a molecular sieve, as described by Pott et al. (2013). The method outlined in Pott et al. (2013) was used to determine bacterial concentration when grown in a medium containing SFAs. Briefly, 2ml of sampled culture medium was spun down at 16,000×g for 300s. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet resuspended in 2ml of 50g/100ml calcium chloride solution. This was again spun down at 16,000×g for 300s and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in growth medium and the OD determined. In order to determine the concentration of free or saponified fatty acids in aqueous solution, the method of Kwon and Rhee (1986) was adapted to include sensitivity to SFAs. Copper acetate reagent was prepared by dissolving and filtering 5% w/v copper acetate in warmed water. The pH of this solution was adjusted to pH 6.1 by the addition of pyridine. A 2.5ml sample was acidified with 100μl of 37% HCl. To this was added 2.5ml of iso-octane, and the mixture vortexed for 1min. The system was allowed to separate into two distinct phases, aided by a short period of centrifugation at 5000g. A 2ml volume of the lighter iso-octane phase was removed and added to 250μl of copper acetate reagent. This two-phase system was then vortexed for 1min and allowed to settle. The fatty acid concentration was determined from the OD of the green cupric soaps in the iso-octane at 715nm, using the following equation: fatty acid concentration (mM)=13.44×absorbance±0.5 at 715nm, determined by testing a series of solutions of known concentration of sodium oleate, or sodium stearate."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of different SFA concentrations on growth rate of R. palustris,"3.1 Effect of different SFA concentrations on growth rate of R. palustris Fig. 1 shows the maximum growth rates achieved under these conditions. A control experiment was conducted (results not shown) with the CaCl2-free medium and pure glycerol and this revealed that the growth of the organism was not affected by the reduction in concentration of calcium ions. From Fig. 1, it is clear that SFAs exert a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of R. palustris, in this case decreasing the maximum growth rate to essentially zero at a concentration of 0.2mM sodium oleate. This is consistent with previous work (Pott et al., 2013), and corresponds well with the work of Ghosh et al., (2011), although those researchers had not identified SFAs as the cause of the inhibition seen at high GC concentrations."
8,Purification of crude glycerol,"3.2 Purification of crude glycerol 3.2.1 pH adjustment The use of pH adjustment to remove SFAs from a crude glycerol solution has been reported previously (Kongjao et al., 2010; Javani et al., 2012; Sarma et al., 2012; Hidawati and Sakinah, 2011; Manosak and Limpattayanate, 2011). With a decrease in pH the equilibrium of SFAs moves from the water-soluble, ionised, saponified form of the fatty acid to the water-insoluble, protonated, free fatty acid. The resulting two-phase system allows for separation of the glycerol-rich phase from the free fatty acid phase, which can then be recycled for further biodiesel production. Fig. 2 a shows titration curves for CG, 300mM sodium oleate and SFA-free CG against HCl. The pH curve obtained with a 50vol% CG solution (diluted in order to circumvent an increase in viscosity often associated with adjusting the pH of CG) showed two distinct equivalence points; the first at approximately pH 10–11 after 0.02mmol HCl was added per ml of CG, and the second at about pH 4–5 after ∼0.28mmol HCl per ml of CG had been added. The other two curves, which describe the titration of a 300mM solution of sodium oleate, and CG from which all SFA has been removed by calcium precipitation, each showed single equivalence points at pH ∼4–5 and pH ∼7 after ∼0.3 and ∼0.02mmol HCl /ml had been added, respectively. The equivalence point in CG at pH 4–5 is similar to that of the isolated SFA and the other equivalence point is attributable to NaOH catalyst remaining from the biodiesel production process, as discussed further in Section 3.5, below. Fig. 2b compares the titration of 50% crude glycerol with hydrochloric acid with the experimental determinations of fatty acid concentration in the glycerol phase at corresponding pH values for the same, diluted material. The concentrations of free fatty acid in the glycerol fell rapidly from 350mM to essentially 0mM over a small increase in acidification at around pH 7.6, reflecting the transition from soluble SFA to protonated free fatty acid and the change to a two-phase system. Thus, our results indicate that essentially all fatty acids move to the free fatty acid phase at pH<∼7.6. No intermediate SFA concentrations were found, with the glycerol-phase SFA concentration being either 350mM or essentially 0mM, although the experiment was repeated many times in the region close to pH 7.6. The fatty acid phase has a lower density than the glycerol-rich phase and so forms the upper layer and the phase separation occurred spontaneously and quickly, not requiring centrifugation to hasten the separation. 3.2.2 Solvent extraction Some studies have investigated the use of an organic solvent, such as petroleum ether or hexane, to remove the SFAs (Anand and Saxena, 2012; Rehman et al., 2008). However, the results in Fig. 2b indicate that the efficacy of this method depends on the pH of the solution, with an added solvent causing no reduction in the glycerol-phase SFA concentration unless accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in pH to lower than pH 7.6. This is unsurprising, as the salts of fatty acids are poorly soluble in non-polar solvents unless they become protonated by the addition of an acid. No improvement in separation was found when using an added solvent over simply separating the free fatty acid and glycerol phases once acidified. Indeed, the concentrations of SFA in the glycerol after solvent extraction matched those of the pH treatment shown in Fig. 2b almost exactly. Furthermore, the separation of the liquid phases in the system containing solvent and glycerol was no easier than those in the system containing free fatty acid and glycerol. 3.2.3 Calcium precipitation The calcium salts of fatty acids are very sparingly soluble in water (for e.g. the solubility of calcium stearate is 0.004g/100ml at 15°C in water (Aylward and Findlay, 1999)), such that on addition of a soluble calcium salt, such as CaCl2 or Ca(NO3)2, the calcium soap precipitates out of solution. This solid precipitate can then be recovered from the glycerol-phase by filtration, settling or centrifugation. As calcium is divalent, 2mol of SFA are removed for each mol of calcium added. This hypothesis was verified by the results on precipitation shown in Fig. 3 , which compares the theoretical prediction of concentration of free fatty acids remaining in the glycerol with experimental determinations, as the amount of calcium chloride solution added was increased."
9,Growth rates of R. palustris on treated CG,"3.3 Growth rates of R. palustris on treated CG To determine if each treatment reduces the concentration of the SFA in CG sufficiently to allow for normal growth, cultures of R. palustris were grown using each treated CG as a carbon source. Fig. 4 shows the maximum growth rate (μmax ) for each CG treatment, and for untreated CG, all other conditions being identical. The fact that the maximum rates of growth are similar for cells grown on glycerol after any of the treatments shows that each method provides sufficient glycerol purification to remove the inhibition due to SFAs. Many papers call for glycerol to be purified much more stringently than was done in our experiments. For example, it has been suggested that the methanol be distilled off, the SFAs removed by one of several methods, the salts removed by alcohol precipitation (Ooi et al., 2001; Hájek and Skopal; Kongjao et al., 2010; Hidawati and Sakinah, 2011), and the remaining impurities removed by adsorption on activated carbon (Manosak and Limpattayanate, 2011; Kovács, 2011). As a comparison, a series of purifications, including SFA removal by pH reduction, salt precipitation by alcohol addition and adsorption onto activated carbon, was performed on one CG sample, and the maximum growth rate of R. palustris on the resulting glycerol is shown in Fig. 4, as the column labelled ‘activated carbon’. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the stringent purification by this several-step process did not lead to a higher growth rate than with other treatments for CG. This is unsurprising, as previous work by Pott et al. (2013) showed that the only inhibiting compounds in CG at the concentrations in question are SFAs, with the alcohol, salts and further contaminants causing no reduction in growth rate or hydrogen production rate."
10,Hydrogen production on treated and untreated CG,"3.4 Hydrogen production on treated and untreated CG The effect of the various treatments on the rate of production of hydrogen was determined, as described by Pott et al. (2013). In the present case, experiments were conducted on each treated CG as carbon source, as well as on untreated CG. Fig. 5 a shows plots of the cumulative production of hydrogen, and concentration of biomass, as a function of times after inoculation for the growth of the organism of pure glycerol. It can be seen that for times in excess of about 170h, the concentration of biomass is approximately constant. Furthermore, between 170 and ∼250h, the cumulative volume of hydrogen increases approximately linearly, but beyond ∼270h, hydrogen production ceases. These curves correspond well to those reported in Ghosh et al., (2011). Separate experiments (Pott, 2013) show that the cessation of hydrogen production occurs when the glycerol in the batch is depleted, but up to ∼250h, growth is not inhibited by availability of carbon substrate. Accordingly, Fig. 5a can be approximately divided into two sections: I and II, as shown in Fig. 5b. In section I the ratio of cumulative hydrogen and biomass shows a linear correlation with time, with the rate of hydrogen production being growth unassociated. In fact, further analysis (Pott, 2013) shows that in most experiments, the rate of hydrogen production is proportional to biomass concentration only. Accordingly, Fig. 5b shows plots of the cumulative hydrogen production at a particular time divided by the total amount of biomass present in the culture up to that time. Section I of Fig. 5b has been used as a convenient means of computing the average maximum hydrogen production rates, shown in Fig. 6 . Here, maximum hydrogen production rate is obtained from the slope of the linear regression through the points in Section I. From Fig. 6 it is clear that, as was the case with the growth rates shown in Fig. 4, hydrogen production rates from CG purified by pH drop and CaCl2 precipitation were not significantly different from those from pure glycerol, as well as from the CG more stringently purified using treatment with activated carbon. The amount of hydrogen produced from untreated CG was significantly less than that from the treated material. Evidently, the concentration of SFA was sufficiently high to cause reduction in the rate of hydrogen production, as well as in the rate of growth seen in Fig. 4, although there is a large standard deviation. The low rate of hydrogen production seen from CG treated by Ca(NO3)2 was probably a consequence of the nitrogenase regulatory system in R. palustris. In the presence of a fixed nitrogen source, such as NO3 -, the bacterium no longer expresses nitrogenase, the principal enzyme in hydrogen production (Burris, 1991). This regulatory system thus prevents hydrogen production until all the fixed nitrogen is consumed."
11,Comparison with previous findings,"3.5 Comparison with previous findings As noted in the literature, SFAs often elicit an inhibitory effect on the growth of many microogranisms, as SFAs interfere with cell membranes, leading to death if the cell has no method of protection (Chatzifragkou and Papanikolaou, 2012). The inhibition of growth of R. palustris by impurities present in crude glycerol has been shown in several studies (Pott et al., 2013; Ghosh et al. 2011; Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009), and in Pott et al. (2013) it was shown that the effect is due to SFAs. However, little work has been done to examine the relationship between the inhibition of R. palustris and the concentration of SFAs. Fig. 1 illustrates that R. palustris is susceptible to inhibition by SFAs even at low concentrations, with the growth rate decreasing with the addition of any SFA. This information is needed to guide how a process utilising R. palustris to convert CG should be developed. The inhibition by SFAs must therefore be avoided or eliminated, by adapting the organism, protecting the organism or removing the contaminating compounds. This study has focused on the latter: removing the inhibition SFAs. While this study is the first to focus on hydrogen production by R. palustris from treated CG, the results of other studies using treated CG for other purposes show similar improvements when using the treated substrate rather than the crude material (Anand and Saxena, 2012; Rehman et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2010). It was found that lowering the pH of CG is an effective means of removing the SFAs. Careful analysis of Fig. 2a shows that the SFA-free CG titrates in a similar fashion to a simple solution of 0.02M NaOH with 2.5M HCl, which agrees well with the assumption that the principal components of the system were any NaOH remaining from the biodiesel production process, and the SFAs left in solution. The titration curves for CG and sodium oleate can be reproduced theoretically if the pKa values of the SFAs are of the order 7.0 or larger. This is somewhat surprising as the pKa values for short chain fatty acids (e.g. acetic acid) are generally in the region of 4.5–4.9. However Kanicky and Shah (2002) have reported the pKa of oleic acid to be up to 9.85 under certain conditions, the higher value being due to intermolecular interactions exacerbated by any unsaturated bonds in the fatty acid chain and by interfaces formed between immiscible phases. These effects might be exacerbated by the presence of glycerol in the solution. It is this unexpectedly large value of pKa which accounts for the fact that only moderate changes in pH are required to remove the SFA. This is in contrast to previous research recommending that the pH be lowered to values between 1 and 3 (Kongjao et al., 2010; Javani et al., 2012; Sarma et al., 2012; Hidawati and Sakinah, 2011; Manosak and Limpattayanate, 2011). Kongjao et al. (2010) noted a decrease in inorganic salt content as the pH was lowered, owing to salts precipitating out as their solubility decreased at low pH. This did not occur in our experiments because of the prior dilution of the CG with water. However, these inorganic ions do not interfere with the growth of R. palustris at the concentrations present in the current work, as shown by Pott et al. (2013). Lowering the pH to 7.6 instead of pH 1–3 reduces the volume of acid added significantly, by 0.18–0.36mmol HCl per ml diluted CG solution, a 60–75% decrease over the acid needed to reduce the medium to pH 1–3. A further significant benefit is that the glycerol-rich phase does not require the addition of an alkali for neutralisation after SFA removal, if the glycerol is to be used as carbon source for a neutrophilic organism, such as R. palustris. Several studies (Hidawati and Sakinah, 2011; Manosak and Limpattayanate, 2011; Javani et al., 2012) have recommended the addition of a solvent miscible with glycerol, such as ethanol or methanol, to decrease the solubility of ionic salts present, Accordingly, the salts are precipitated and so can be removed, and the alcohol evaporated off, purifying the glycerol. While this is effective in reducing glycerol-phase salt concentrations, it was found to be unnecessary for R. palustris, because the concentration of inorganic salts present was sufficiently low not to cause inhibition. This can be observed from Fig. 4, where cultures grown on CG treated only for SFA removal and not for salt removal exhibited the same maximum specific rate of growth as those grown on pure glycerol. The calcium precipitation method used in the present research is an adaptation of the method used by Pott et al. (2013) and has not been described in the literature previously. Care must be taken with choice of anion, e.g. using Ca(NO3)2 as a source of calcium has the potential benefit of leaving nitrate ions in solution, which R. palustris can use as a nitrogen source, although the rate of production of hydrogen is depressed until the culture becomes N-limited. The solid calcium soap can be recovered, and acidified, with HCl for example, to produce free fatty acids which can be recycled for further biodiesel production, as well as calcium chloride solution which can be recycled for further SFA precipitation. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that the stringent purification processes often recommended in the literature are not required in order to grow R. palustris without inhibition. Of course, to choose amongst the various options for purification at scale, their economic feasibility needs to be assessed in the process application of interest."
12,Conclusion,"R. palustris was found to be inhibited by SFAs in CG; several techniques to reduce SFA concentration were examined. Two methods in particular were effective. In the first, the pH of the solution of CG was reduced to pH ∼7, causing the SFAs to form a separate, easily removable, phase. In the second, the precipitation of SFAs as calcium salts was found to be effective. The fact that there is little difference in growth on highly-purified CG compared with CG which has undergone comparatively simple treatment has a bearing on the economics of producing hydrogen from CG using the organism."
