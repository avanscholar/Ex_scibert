0,Introduction,"Early transition metal carbides (e.g., molybdenum carbide, Mo2C) are potentially alternative catalysts to Pt-group metals [1] and are catalytically active in a variety of reactions, such as hydrogenolysis [2], isomerization [3,4], dehydrogenation [5–8], condensation [8,9], water–gas shift [10], aromatization [11,12], and CO hydrogenation [13–24]. Molybdenum carbide catalysts are well known to produce light hydrocarbons from syngas [19,25,26], but the selectivity of the reaction can be shifted from hydrocarbons to alcohols when appropriate promoters (i.e., alkali metal salts of weak acids [16,22]) and reaction conditions are used [15,18]. Unfortunately, the specific activity of the Mo2C-based catalysts in CO hydrogenation is very low compared to other catalysts. For example, the apparent turnover frequency, or TOF, of CO on Mo2C/α-Al2O3 catalysts [21] (normalized by the amount of surface metal atoms) was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that on an iron-promoted, titania-supported rhodium catalyst under similar conditions [27]. The very low apparent activity of molybdenum carbide can be attributed to either an intrinsically slow rate of catalytic turnover, or to a very small number of the active sites that accomplish the catalytic cycle related to the amount of Mo at the surface. Due to the high oxophilicity of Mo2C, it is not straightforward to count the active sites that participate in the CO hydrogenation reaction. We therefore used isotopic transient kinetic analysis to probe the kinetics of CO hydrogenation catalyzed by supported molybdenum carbide. Transient methods have been used for many years to explore the kinetics of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions [28]. In particular, steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA), as developed by Happel [29], Bennett [30], and Biloen [31], is useful for evaluating fundamental kinetic parameters of operating solid catalysts, including surface coverages of reaction intermediates, surface residence times, and active site heterogeneities. In addition, the technique can help identify possible mechanisms [32]. For CO hydrogenation, SSITKA has been employed on various metal catalysts, including Fe [33–38], Pd [39–42], Co [33,34,43–47], Ru [48], Ni [49,50], and Rh [51,52]. For a complete discussion of SSITKA, please see the review by Shannon and Goodwin [32]. In the current work, we have used SSITKA to probe the kinetics of CO hydrogenation over alumina-supported Mo2C nanoclusters, with and without Rb promoters. As discussed above, the unpromoted Mo2C catalyst functioned primarily as a hydrocarbon formation catalyst with a standard Anderson–Schultz–Flory distribution [19,25,26]. Addition of alkali metal promoters to Mo2C allowed alcohols to be produced in addition to hydrocarbons [15–18,20–22]."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis The Mo2C nanoclusters were prepared on α-Al2O3 by incipient wetness impregnation of an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24 followed by drying, calcination, reduction, and temperature-programmed carburization up to 900K (with a mixture of C2H6 and H2) as described in detail in previous work [21]. The addition of Rb2CO3 promoter was performed between reduction and carburization, by physically mixing Rb2CO3 with the supported suboxide precursor in a mortar and pestle. After carburization, the catalysts were cooled to room temperature in flowing He before being passivated in a stream of 1vol.% O2/N2 mixture at room temperature for 12h. The nominal loading of Mo2C and Rb on alumina was 5wt.% and 1.5wt.%, respectively. According to the characterization results presented previously [21], the 5wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst showed a 4.7wt.% Mo loading and a C/Mo molar ratio of 0.39. The results from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of highly dispersed molybdenum carbide on alumina support, with the particle size of 1nm. The 1.5wt.% Rb–5wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst revealed a Rb/Mo molar ratio of 0.31, which was close to the nominal value (0.34). After passivation of the molybdenum carbide catalysts, the surface was partially oxidized [21]."
3,Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide,"2.2 Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide Hydrogenation of CO was conducted in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (3/8in. OD) with 0.5g of 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 or 2.0g of 1.5wt.% Rb−5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3. The catalysts were tested at nominally identical conditions of 573K, 1.2bar total pressure with equivalent partial pressure of H2 (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) and CO (GTS-Welco, 99.997%). The products were analyzed by an online SRI 8610C gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A Restek MXT®-Q-Bond column (0.53mm I.D., 30m length) connected to an FID was used to quantify hydrocarbons and alcohols, while a HayeSep-D column (3.2mm I.D., 1.8m length) connected to a TCD was used to analyze CO and CO2. The conversion of CO was derived from the molar fraction of CO that formed carbon-containing products [53]. The conversion of CO, if low, can be described as follows: Conversion ( % ) = ∑ n i M i × 100 / M CO , where ni is the number of carbon atoms in product i, Mi is the molar percentage of product i detected, and M CO is the molar percentage of CO in the syngas feed. The selectivity toward product i is based on the total number of carbon atoms in the product and is therefore defined as follows: Selectivity ( C % ) = n i M i × 100 ∑ n i M i . The conversion and selectivities were based on the identified products, which present more than 97% of the total peak area in GC chromatograms."
4,Multi-product SSITKA,"2.3 Multi-product SSITKA Our lab has used SSITKA to study a variety of reactions on solid catalysts such as ammonia synthesis on Ru [54,55], CO hydrogenation on Au [56,57], and ethanol coupling on MgO [58]. Our reactor system in previous works analyzed for only one product of the reaction. We therefore needed to make substantial changes to our reactor system to analyze the multiple products formed during CO hydrogenation. The system used for the multi-product SSITKA experiments is based on the design reported by Goodwin and co-workers [47,51,59] and is shown in Fig. 1 . The isotopic switch from 12CO to 13CO was carried out after the reaction achieved steady state (typically more than 72h on stream) at 573K, 1.2bar, and H2/CO=1. Although higher pressures were utilized in our previous works with supported Mo2C catalysts (30bar) [20–22], a lower pressure was used in our transient experiments to minimize the consumption of 13CO because the amount of 13CO provided in the lecture bottles was quite limited. The syngas flow rate was varied from 10.8 to 15.6cm3 min−1 to explore any potential influence of product re-adsorption on the transient response, while the Ar tracer flow rate was maintained at 0.2cm3 min−1. During an isotopic transient experiment, a switch between naturally abundant 12CO (GTS-Welco, 99.997%) with Ar tracer (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) and 13CO (Cambridge Isotopes, 99.5% CO, 98+% 16O, 99+% 13C) was made using a Valco 2-position valve with an electric actuator. All of the reaction conditions remained undisturbed during the switch, including flow rates, partial pressures, and reaction temperature. Back pressure regulators were used to minimize the pressure disturbance during the switch. The gas-phase holdup of the system was determined by using an Ar tracer fed with the 12CO stream. The multiple products formed during CO hydrogenation created a complex fragmentation pattern in the mass spectrometer. To simplify the product analysis, we first separated the products by gas chromatography and then converted the C2+products to CH4 prior to admission to the mass spectrometer. This methodology was used previously by Bennett and co-workers [49,50] and recently by Goodwin and co-workers [47,51,59] to study the kinetics of CO hydrogenation. In our transient reactor system, a Valco 34-port auto-sampling valve was employed to collect 16 samples during the isotopic transients. The collected effluent samples were separated in a Restek MXT®-Q-Bond column (0.53mm I.D., 30m length) placed in the same GC oven used for steady-state product analysis. Dihydrogen was used as the carrier gas and as a reactant for the subsequent hydrogenolysis reaction. After separation, the products were fed into a hydrogenolysis reactor containing 5g of 5wt.% Pt/Al2O3 (Sigma–Aldrich) held at 673K to convert CO and all the products to CH4. The resulting CH4 was subsequently fed to the mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum) to measure the isotope content of the products. The signal for m/z=15 and 17 was monitored for 12CH4 and 13CH4, respectively. Since the fragmentation of 13CH4 also contributes to the signal for 12CH4 (14% of the 13CH4 signal according to calibration), the 12CH4 responses (m/z=15) were all corrected by subtracting the fragment from 13CH4. Because the Restek GC column was unable to separate CO2 and CH4 from CO, another series of transient experiments had to be performed. To analyze CH4 and CO2, the hydrogenolysis reactor prior to the MS was bypassed, and the responses for CH4, CO2, and the Ar tracer were monitored directly by MS. Fig. 2 shows the normalized steady-state transient responses of the 12CH4 and 13CH4 produced over 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 during CO hydrogenation after a switch from 12CO to 13CO. The mean surface residence time of the reaction intermediates leading to a certain product (τi ) was determined by integrating the area between the normalized transient response of the 12C portion in the corresponding product (Fi ) and that of the inert tracer Ar (F Ar): τ i = ∫ ( F i - F Ar ) dt , as depicted in Fig. 2 by τ methane (shaded area). Assuming a pseudo-first-order reaction of surface intermediates [32], the corresponding turnover frequency (TOF) to produce a specific product is simply as follows: TOF i = τ i - 1 . The amount of active surface intermediates leading to a specific product (i) can be determined by a straightforward material balance on the reactor: N i = τ i R i X i , where Ri is the rate of formation of product i at steady-state reaction and X i refers to the fractional change in 12C response (after the switch to 13CO) from the initial value. The corresponding surface coverage (θi ) is thus: θ i = N i / (amount of surface Mo atoms). Given the nearly 100% dispersion of Mo in the Mo2C nanoclusters as indicated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) [21], θ i = N i / ( amount of Mo atoms ) . We performed this simplified analysis of the transient results (simple carbon material balance) because all of the experiments were performed at identical conditions of pressure and temperature. In another series of experiments, the desorption of the surface intermediates leading to different products in CO hydrogenation was studied after the CO flow was halted. A switch between CO (GTS-Welco, 99.997%) and Ar (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) was made using the Valco 2-position valve with an electric actuator at the steady state of reaction, while the H2 (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) flow was maintained. The Valco 34-port auto-sampling valve was employed to collect 16 samples of product gas during desorption. The downstream setup (GC column, hydrogenolysis reactor, MS, etc.) was the same as that used for the SSITKA experiments."
5,Results and discussion,"Prior work in our lab explored the structure and reactivity of supported Mo2C nanoclusters on MgO [20] and Al2O3 [21,22]. In particular, we found the clusters to be partially oxidized under reaction conditions of 30bar syngas at 573K. Infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on activated catalysts revealed very weak absorption features, suggesting a very low CO coverage on the clusters [22]. Addition of Rb2CO3 to the supported Mo2C clusters redshifted the IR bands of adsorbed CO and altered the product selectivity from hydrocarbons to alcohols during syngas conversion [22]. A detailed analysis of the steady-state rates showed that the observed shift in selectivity with addition of the alkali metal promoter resulted from severely inhibiting the production of hydrocarbons while minimally affecting the production of alcohols [21]. Since the active site density was not available for normalization, the rates determined in those studies were normalized by the amount of Mo in the clusters. In the following sections, the intrinsic turnover rate of the catalytic reaction and the fraction of Mo that participated in the catalytic cycle were determined from isotopic transient analysis. Table 1 summarizes the performance of unpromoted and Rb-promoted alumina-supported Mo2C catalysts in the reaction of syngas (H2/CO=1) at 573K and 1.2bar. The unpromoted 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 catalyst produced only hydrocarbons (82% paraffins and 18% olefins) and CO2 at these conditions. The selectivity toward alcohols increased to 21% after addition of 1.5wt.% Rb, which is in good agreement with the earlier works on the catalytic performance of Mo2C promoted by alkali metal species in CO hydrogenation [15,18–23]. It should be noted that the alcohol selectivity during our ambient pressure CO hydrogenation studies was not as high as that observed at elevated pressure [21]. Nevertheless, the relatively high selectivity toward olefins (36% on a CO2-free basis) observed at ambient pressure over 1.5wt.% Rb–5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 is consistent with the findings by Park et al. [25] As shown in Table 1, the CO conversion was kept below 1%, thus ensuring differential reaction conditions. Fig. 3 shows that the CO conversion was strictly linear with respect to the inverse of the gas flow rate, confirming the differential behaviors of the reactor system."
6,Transient analysis of CO hydrogenation over Mo2C/α-Al2O3,"3.1 Transient analysis of CO hydrogenation over Mo2C/α-Al2O3 Multi-product SSITKA allows the determination of the surface reaction parameters, including the surface residence times of reaction intermediates (τ) and amount of intermediates (N) leading to different products. Fig. 4 presents the transient responses of various products formed over a 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 catalyst up to 1h after an isotope switch. All the transient responses were normalized by the steady-state signal of 12C before the transient occurred. The 12C transient response over a Mo2C catalyst typically included a rapid decay, a slow decay, and a persistent background signal of 12C. In other words, the 12C signal did not decay completely to the background level, even after 1h. The major fraction of the transient response happened quickly and is attributed to a catalytic turnover on sites denoted as Pool A. The origin of the slow decay on sites denoted as Pool B and the background 12C signal is unclear. It has been reported previously that the species adsorbed on the Mo2C surface can have a fairly high adsorption energy [22,60–62] and that activation of adsorbed CO may involve the formation or participation of the carbidic carbon [22,63–65]. Because α-Al2O3 has been used previously in SSITKA experiments as an inert agent during CO hydrogenation experiments [47], we suspect that re-adsorption of products on the α-Al2O3 support was unlikely to cause the slow transient response. Therefore, we attribute the slow decay in the 12C transient response to either a strong interaction between the adsorbed reaction intermediates and the Mo2C surface (which may be catalytically relevant), or the exchange of carbon between the adsorbed reaction intermediates and the underlying carbidic carbon (which is likely to be catalytically irrelevant). The background incorporation of 12C into products after 1h was presumably due to the very slow exchange of unlabeled carbidic carbon with labeled reactive carbon. Since the isotopic transient responses in Fig. 4 appear to be composed by two different exponential functions, we fit the curves with the following expression: F ( t ) = X A exp - t - t 0 T A + X B exp - t - t 0 T B + X bkg , where A, B, and bkg stand for the fraction of sites associated with Pool A (rapid turnover), Pool B (slow turnover), and background exchange, respectively. The results of the curve fits are summarized in Table 2 . The sites associated with Pool A account for about 80% of the C1 products, and about 65% of the C2 products formed over 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3. This rapid transient associated with Pool A is nearly complete by 200 s at a flow rate of 15.6cm3 min−1, so we repeated the transient experiment to collect more samples during the rapid transient. Because our sampling system allowed only 15 samples to be collected after the change in feed, shortening the total collection time allowed us to acquire more points throughout the rapid transient. Table 3 compares the fraction of the transients responsible for Pool A derived from both short (measured) and long (fitted) collection times and confirms that our acquisition of rapid transient results (290–430s) reproduce well the conclusion obtained from the long-time transient experiment (3600s). The typical transient responses of hydrocarbons and CO2 associated with Pool A are shown in Fig. 5 , and the calculated values of mean surface residence time (τ) of various hydrocarbons and CO2 on unpromoted and Rb-promoted Mo2C at different syngas flow rates are displayed in Fig. 6 . The τ values for the various products in Fig. 6 were fairly independent of flow rate over the range investigated, indicating that product re-adsorption on the catalyst or support was negligible. Therefore, τ values for each product were averaged, and the results are summarized in Table 4 . The corresponding reaction parameters such as intrinsic TOF and coverage of reaction intermediate were subsequently calculated from those values. It should be noted that two types of N and θ are shown in Table 4, namely “fractional” and “maximum,” respectively. The “fractional” values were based on the potential existence of catalytically active sites in Pool B, on which reaction intermediates turn over at low rates. On the other hand, the “maximum” values were calculated assuming the slow transients resulted solely from exchange of carbon between the reaction intermediates and the carbidic carbon of the catalyst, which is not directly involved in the steady-state reaction rate. Since neither of the two mechanisms can be excluded, both types of coverages are reported. The very low apparent TOF of CO hydrogenation over Mo2C catalysts, as reported in Table 1, was very different from the intrinsic TOF (τ −1) determined by SSITKA. The intrinsic TOF for CO hydrogenation associated with Pool A on 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 (0.067s−1, Table 4) was nearly three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding apparent one (0.00008s−1, Table 1) and is comparable to the intrinsic TOF of CO hydrogenation derived from SSITKA on a bulk Fe catalyst [59] (0.15s−1, at 553K, 1.8bar and H2/CO=20) and a Rh/SiO2 catalyst [51] (0.1s−1, at 553K, 1.8bar and H2/CO=20). Likewise, the apparent TOF on a Fe–Rh/TiO2 catalyst [27] was 0.1s−1, at 567K, 20bar, and H2/CO=1. Nørskov and co-workers used a first-principles approach to compare the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationship of a variety of adsorbed species on the (211) surfaces of various late transition metals (Ru, Ir, Fe, Co, Rh, Ni, and Pd) [66] with a representative Mo2C(001) surface [62]. The authors concluded the chemistry of carbon on Mo-terminated Mo2C(001) was indeed similar to that on the late transition metals and suggested that Mo2C should exhibit similar activity to these metals for reactions where hydrocarbons are the main intermediates [62]. Thus, our SSITKA results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. A high intrinsic TOF for CO hydrogenation over Mo2C (0.067s−1) relative to a low apparent TOF (0.00008s−1, Table 1) must necessarily correspond to a very low coverage of carbon-containing intermediates. As summarized in Table 5, the coverage of carbon-containing reaction intermediates leading to hydrocarbons was 8.4 mmol C mol Mo - 1 , which is far lower than the coverage of species observed on Fe- [38] and Rh-based [52] catalysts. The low surface coverage of adsorbed species is consistent with a very weak IR band of adsorbed CO on Mo2C [22,67–69] and might be attributed to the carbidic carbon occupying the surface [64], to adsorbed oxygen on the molybdenum carbide surface due to the strong oxophilicity of Mo2C [20,70–72], or to graphitization during reaction [65,78]. The values of τ for hydrocarbons associated with Pool A (Table 4) follow the trend, τ C3 > τ C2 > τ C1, which results from the elementary reactions needed to grow the carbon chain. Similarly, unsaturated hydrocarbon (C2H4) showed slightly shorter residence time than the corresponding saturated one (C2H6), which is related to the time needed for chain termination via hydrogenation. According to Lohitharn and Goodwin [59], the maximum reaction time of carbon chain growth and chain termination via hydrogenation can be estimated by τ C 3 H 6 - τ C 2 H 4 ≈ 9 s and by τ C 2 H 6 - τ C 2 H 4 ≈ 3 s , respectively, and both are slightly longer times than those values on Fe-based catalysts (1.7s and 0.9s, respectively) revealed by SSITKA [59]. The mean residence time for CO2 on 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 was approximately the same as that for overall CO hydrogenation, indicating water produced in the reaction rapidly consumed CO in the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. In fact, Mo2C is known as a good catalyst/catalytic component in WGS [10,73–76]. The corresponding overall surface coverages of reaction intermediates (Pool A and the potentially existing Pool B combined) were derived from the isotopic transient experiment up to 1h (see Fig. 4, for example, curves) by subtracting the background signal, and the results are summarized in Table 5 . With Pool B being considered, the residence times for hydrocarbons were increased by an order of magnitude. Nørskov and co-workers used a first-principles approach to predict that if oxygen is a key intermediate on the surface of oxophilic Mo2C during CO hydrogenation, the activity of CO hydrogenation can be much lower than when hydrocarbons are the main intermediates [62]. Therefore, Pool B might be composed of those reaction intermediates that have oxygen strongly interacting with the Mo2C surface. The inclusion of Pool B in the analysis increased the total coverage of reaction intermediates by a factor of 8 ( θ A + B = 16 mmol C mol Mo - 1 , θ A = 2 mmol C mol Mo - 1 ) ."
7,Transient analysis of CO hydrogenation over Rb-promoted Mo2C/α-Al2O3,"3.2 Transient analysis of CO hydrogenation over Rb-promoted Mo2C/α-Al2O3 With the addition of Rb promoter, the time constants for the hydrocarbons associated with Pool A were almost the same as those measured on the unpromoted Mo2C catalyst, but the surface coverages of carbon-containing reaction intermediates were lowered by an order of magnitude (Table 4). These results provide direct evidence for the site-blocking mechanism of alkali metal promotion on Mo-based catalysts for the enhancement of alcohol selectivity suggested by Lee and co-workers [16,77] and by our previous studies [20–22]. It should be noted that the CO2 transient on the Rb-promoted Mo2C catalyst was not complete after 290–430s, and labeled alcohols were never observed over that time frame. Since labeled alcohols were not detected in the effluent of the reactor containing 1.5wt.% Rb–5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 even after sampling for 2h beyond the switch to labeled 13CO, SSITKA could not be used to quantify the surface coverage of intermediates leading to alcohols. Evidently, the alcohols were strongly retained by the catalyst. To overcome this problem, we decided to perform a long-term transient experiment in which the steady-state CO flow was simply replaced with Ar, so that we could follow the desorption of the products formed into a stream of H2 and Ar. The profiles of normalized desorption rates over 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 and 1.5wt.% Rb–5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 7 , and the amount of the reaction intermediates (N) and the corresponding surface coverages (θ) determined from the material balance are summarized in Table 6 . The values of N and θ for the total carbon intermediates on 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 measured by the desorption experiment (N =13 μ mol C g cat - 1 , θ = 27 mmol C mol Mo - 1 , in Table 6) are comparable to those derived from SSITKA (N =8.1 μ mol C g cat - 1 , θ = 16 mmol C mol Mo - 1 , in Table 5), which suggests that desorption experiments with flowing H2 and Ar provide reasonable estimations of N and θ. Interestingly, increases in the desorption rates of hydrocarbons were observed in the first several minutes of the desorption experiments under flowing H2 and Ar (the portions exceeding 1 in Fig. 7), and the effluent CO2 from 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 in the desorption experiment (0.8 μ mol C g cat - 1 , in Table 6) was much less than the value measured by SSITKA ( 3.9 μ mol C g cat - 1 , in Table 5). These results suggest that the carbon intermediates leading to CO2 formation during steady-state syngas reaction (presumably associatively adsorbed CO) may undergo hydrogenation to hydrocarbons instead. Additionally, halting the flow of CO may facilitate rapid hydrogenation of adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments, thus resulting in a rapid desorption at short times. Nevertheless, these changes in specific products did not significantly affect the overall decay in the overall desorption rate of the carbon intermediates with time-on-stream and should not affect the quantification of the total amount of carbon intermediates on the surface at the time of the transient. With added 1.5wt.% Rb, the mean residence time of CO2 on 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 was significantly increased (noted the change in scale of the x-axis in Fig. 7), indicating a strong affinity between CO2 and the basic Rb species, which is to be expected. The amount of the total carbon desorbed from the 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 catalyst increased by a factor of 3 after adding Rb (see Table 6), among which about a fifth (8 μ mol C g cat - 1 ) was associated with alcohols. Evidently, the presence of Rb on the catalyst increased the retention of products on the surface during CO hydrogenation. Since the total amount of carbon desorbed from the promoted catalyst (43 μ mol C g cat - 1 ) was much less than the amount of Rb (180 μ mol C g cat - 1 ) in the catalyst, we concluded that interactions of products and/or reaction intermediates with the Rb promoter are significant. Also, given the total amount of the carbidic carbon (210 μ mol C g cat - 1 ) exceeded the measured amount of carbon-containing intermediates formed on 5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 (13 μ mol C g cat - 1 ) and on 1.5wt.% Rb–5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 (43 μ mol C g cat - 1 ), the slow exchange of carbon between the reaction intermediates and the carbidic carbon cannot be completed during the time of measurements. Fig. 7 and Table 6 show that addition of Rb delayed the desorption of hydrocarbons from the carbide catalyst while substantially inhibiting the hydrocarbon formation rate. Hydrocarbons can be formed either directly or from secondary reactions involving alcohols. The remaining sites available to produce hydrocarbons after the addition of a base promoter showed a longer time to desorb products in Fig. 7 than those sites on an unpromoted catalyst. Evidently, the reaction intermediates to produce hydrocarbons, which might be surface oxygenates, are retained longer on the Rb-promoted surface."
8,Conclusions,"The isotopic transient analysis revealed that although the catalytically relevant pool on Mo2C catalysts was capable of relatively rapid turnovers in CO hydrogenation (0.067s−1 at 573K in 1.2bar syngas), the surface coverage of reaction intermediates was extremely low, resulting in a low apparent activity of the Mo2C-based catalysts in the CO hydrogenation reaction. The low surface coverage of the reaction intermediates was decreased even further by adding Rb promoter. The added Rb promoter interacted strongly with the alcohols formed during CO hydrogenation, suggesting that Rb alkoxides may be one form of the Rb species present during reaction. Exchange of carbon between the adsorbed reaction intermediates during CO hydrogenation and the carbidic carbon in the carbide catalysts likely accounted for the long transient response and background level of signal after an isotopic switch. The results of this work show that appropriately active sites, typical of late transition metals, indeed exist on supported Mo2C catalysts for CO hydrogenation, but the number of those sites is very low compare to the total amount of Mo at the surface. Future work with Mo2C catalysts for CO hydrogenation should involve identification of those sites and optimization of their number density."
