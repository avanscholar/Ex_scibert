0,Introduction,"H2 is regarded as a promising energy carrier, because it can store and transfer energy without producing any pollutant or greenhouse gas [1]. Fermentative hydrogen production, in which carbohydrates are directly fermented into H2, CO2, and organic acids/alcohols without any external energy or electron acceptors, is considered as feasible biological process to produce H2 [2]. Organic solid wastes would also be a feasible feedstock of which reduction and stabilization could be also accomplished by H2 fermentation. In recent years, continuous H2 production from various organic solid wastes has been documented [3–7]. However, it has also been reported that H2 production sometimes stopped during continuous waste feeding to the reactor [8–10]. One of the major reasons of the deterioration is the dominance of non-H2-producing acidogens and/or H2-consuming microorganisms in the reactor. Besides the organic solid waste itself contained many types of indigenous microorganisms, so that it would act as the continuous inoculum of the unintended microorganisms [9–11]. The microorganisms could prevail easily in start-up period when the H2-producing bacteria have not been fully acclimated to the waste [12]. Optimum operation conditions such as pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), substrate concentration and H2 concentration may reduce the risk and provide favorable environment to H2-producing bacteria [5,6,13,14]; however, additional methods might be considered if there is a risk of serious contamination. In South Korea, food waste is one of the most abundant and problematic organic solid waste. The generation of food waste reaches about 12,977tons/day, accounting for 38.5% of municipal solid wastes [15]. It had been the major source of odor emanation, vermin attraction, toxic gas emission and groundwater contamination in collection, transportation and landfill of municipal solid waste due to the high organic concentration (volatile solids (VS)/total solids (TS): 0.8–0.9) and moisture content (80–85%). In 2005, as the direct landfill of food waste is prohibited by the government, 97% of food waste is collected separately and 91% of the collected food waste is converted to animal feed or aerobic compost. However, only 6% of animal feed made from food waste was sold in 2002 owing to anxiety for the inferior nutrient balance and impurities [16]. Aerobic compost is a high energy consumption process (30–35kWh/ton) that has little volume reduction efficiency. Furthermore, aerobically composted food waste is also not popular in agricultural market. Only 28% of compost from food waste was sold in 2002 [16]. Unsold animal feed and compost are major burdens in the recycling facilities. As food waste has high energy content and biodegradability, anaerobic digestion would be a relevant alternative to achieve dual benefits of energy production and waste stabilization. H2 production from food waste has considerable potential to enhance the economic feasibility of the waste treatment. However, food waste contains many kinds of indigenous bacteria [3,9]. They may cause unintended microbial population in H2 fermentation using non-aseptic feedstock and reactor, especially during start-up period. The aim of this study was to establish a stable continuous enriched culture for H2 production from food waste at mesophilic condition. Two anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) were operated to examine the effect of CO2 sparging, acid-pretreatment, and base-pretreatment. The effect of the pretreatments on the reduction of indigenous bacteria in food waste and the microbial population in H2 fermentation was also evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and food waste,"2.1 Seed sludge and food waste Seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester at the municipal wastewater treatment plant in Daejeon, South Korea. The digester was operated at 35°C at a HRT of 25 days, and fed with a mixture of primary and secondary sludge. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentrations of the sludge were 7.6, 2.83g CaCO3/L, and 5.5g/L, respectively. The sludge was heat-treated at 90°C for 10min to deactivate any bioactivity of H2 consumers. Food waste was obtained from a cafeteria at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology every 3 or 4 days. After the bones and clamshells were removed, the authors shaped the food waste into an elongated pile with uniform width and thickness [17]. One tenth of the food waste was taken through the entire thickness. Manual assortment and the consequent separate drying at 105°C during 1 day of the subsample showed that the food waste was composed mainly of grains (36.3±1.8%), vegetables (45.8±2.7%), meat (12.2±2.3%), and fish (4.6±0.5%) on a total solid (TS) basis. The remained food waste was ground in a garbage disposal unit (Waste King Gourmet model 1001; Anaheim Manufacturing). We found that about 96.4% of the dried ground particles could pass through US sieve #8 (2.38mm). The characteristics of the ground food waste are summarized in Table 1. The ground or further pretreated food waste was stored at 15±1°C. Storage in refrigerator was not chosen because it may not be easily realized in the field application."
3,Reactor operation,"2.2 Reactor operation Two identical tank reactors with a working volume of 4.5L (200mm high, 170mm ID) were installed in a 35±1°C constant temperature room. Each tank reactor was equipped with an impeller and connected to a gas reservoir and a wet gas meter (W-NK-1B, Shinagawa). At start-up I, the authors added the predetermined amount of tap water to the ground food waste adjusting the carbohydrate concentration to 27.0g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L (average VS 4.4%). FeCl2·4H2O (36mg/L) was also annexed to prevent iron limitation [12]. At start-up II, the feedstock was made same as in start-up I. In addition, CO2 (>99.9%) was sparged to the reactor using a dispersion plate placed at the bottom. The sparging rate was maintained at 80L/L/day on every day according to a previous study [18]. At start-up III, the ground food waste was acid-pretreated before diluted by tap water. pH was adjusted to 2.0 using 6M HCl, and then the acidified food waste was agitated at 60rpm and 35±1°C under anaerobic condition for 1 day. Subsequently, the feedstock was made by adding tap water and 6M KOH to adjust the carbohydrate concentration and pH to be the same as in start-ups I and II. At start-up IV, the ground food waste was base-treated before dilution. KOH (6M) was used to adjust pH to 12.5. After 1 day incubation, the alkali-treated food waste was diluted using tap water. Carbohydrate concentration was the same as in start-ups I–III, while pH was 11.8±0.3. At each start-up, the reactors were inoculated with 1.35L of the heat-treated sludge and filled with the feed to the working volume. Subsequently, the headspace of the reactors were flushed with N2 gas for 1min, and then the reactors were agitated at 200rpm and the pH was kept at 5.3±0.1 with 3M potassium hydroxide. When cumulative H2 production was equivalent to 0.5mol H2/mol hexoseadded, the reactors were put into sequencing batch feed mode, going through three 8-h batches/day of feeding (5min), reaction (470min), and drawing phases (5min). The feeding and drawing were controlled by automatic pumps. As the volume of the gas reservoir (2L) was larger than the drawn volume, the gas phase of the reactors was kept anaerobic during drawing phase. The HRTs were maintained at 24 and 30h. After start-up IV, further runs were conducted for HRT 24h with introducing a settling phase between the reaction phase and the drawing phase to enhance biomass retention. We stopped the agitation and pH control during the settling and drawing phases. The feeding, reaction, settling, and the drawing phases were designed to be 5, 370, 100, and 5min, respectively. As a part of solids floated during the settling phase due to internal gassing, we used the drawing port at 84mm from the bottom, so the relative height with respect to the depth of mixed liquor (200mm) was 0.42. Fig. 1 summarized the reactor operation method."
4,Batch tests for food waste pretreatment,"2.3 Batch tests for food waste pretreatment Batch tests were performed to evaluate the effects of the pretreatments on H2 production from food waste. After adjusting pH to 12.5/2.0 with 6 M KOH/HCl, the ground food waste was agitated at 60rpm and 35±1°C under anaerobic condition as the feedstock preparation in continuous operation. During 2 days agitation, samples were taken periodically to estimate the reduction of anaerobic bacteria in food waste."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The measured biogas production was corrected to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mmHg) (STP). H2 content in biogas was determined by a gas chromatograph (GC, Gow-Mac series 580, Gow-Mac Instrument Co., USA) using a thermal conductivity detector and a 2.0m×3.2mm molecular sieve 5Å 45/60 column (Restek Co., USA) with N2 at a flow rate of 30mL/min as a carrier gas. The contents of CH4, N2, and CO2 were measured using a GC of the same model noted previously with a 1.8m×3.2mm Porapak Q 80/100 column (Ohio Valley Specialty Chemical, USA) using helium at a flow rate of 30mL/min as a carrier gas. The temperatures of injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50°C, respectively, in both GCs. VFA (C2–C6) and lactate were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Finnigan Spectra SYSTEM LC, Thermo Electron Co., USA) with an ultraviolet (210nm) detector (UV1000, Thermo Electron) and a 100mm×7.8mm Fast Acid Analysis column (Bio-Rad Lab, USA) using 0.9mM H2SO4 as mobile phase. Aliphatic alcohol was determined using another HPLC (DX-600, Dionex Co., USA) with an electrochemical detector (ED50A, Dionex) and a 250mm×9mm IonPac ICE-AS1 column (Dionex) using 50mM HClO4 as mobile phase. The liquid samples were pretreated with 0.45μm membrane filter before injection to both HPLCs. Carbohydrate was determined using the phenol–sulfuric acid method [13,19]. Lipids were measured by Soxhlet method [20]. The solids, COD, VSS, Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia, and alkalinity were quantified according to standard methods [21]. The reduction of total anaerobic bacteria during pretreatment was evaluated by spread plate method [22]. Samples taken during batch tests were immediately spread over surface of agar after dilution. Wilkins–Chalgren anaerobic agar of Oxoid company was used and its composition is as follows: tryptone 10.0g/L, gelatin peptone 10g/L, yeast extract 5.0g/L, sodium pyruvate 1.0g/L, menadione 0.0005g/L, haemin 0.005g/L, and agar 10.0g/L [23]. The agar plates were incubated at 37°C and the colony growth results were recorded as the number of colony-forming units on the agar plates. The microbial community was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified V3 region of 16S rDNA [14]. DNA in mixed liquor samples was extracted using the Ultraclean Soil DNA kit (Cat # 12800-50; Mo Bio Laboratories, USA). The region corresponding to positions 357F and 518R in the 16S rDNA of Escherichia coli was amplified by PCR using the forward primer EUB357f (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) with a GC clamp (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCC-3′) at the 5′ end to stabilize the melting behavior of the DNA fragments and the reverse primer UNIV518r (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) [24–26]. PCR amplification was carried out in an automated thermal cycler (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC). Initial denaturation was at 94°C for 4min; this was followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40s and annealing at 55°C for 40s. Each annealing step was followed by extension at 72°C for 1min except the final extension step, which was 8min. The PCR samples were applied to 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in 1×TAE buffer [20mM Tris–acetate (pH 7.4), 10mM acetate, 0.5mM Na2EDTA] with a denaturing gradient that ranged from 40 to 60%. The gradient gel was cast with a gradient delivery system (Model 475, Bio-Rad, USA). Electrophoresis was carried out at 60°C and at a constant voltage of 70V. After 8h of electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 30min before being visualized on a UV transilluminator. The bands of interest were excised from the gel and were immersed in Tris–EDTA buffer (pH 8) for 24h. The eluted DNA was reamplified by PCR with the forward primer EUB357f without a GC clamp and the reverse primer UNIV518r. The product was then purified using the Millipore MultiScreen Vacuum Manifold. All purified PCR products were sequenced with primer EUB357f using the ABI PRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). A search for the closest reference microorganisms in the GenBank database using the partial 16S rDNA sequences was carried out with the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Continuous enriched culture for H2 production from food waste,"3.1 Continuous enriched culture for H2 production from food waste At start-up I, H2 production decreased below 7.1mL H2/g VS (0.10mol H2/mol hexoseadded) within 20 days in both the reactors as shown in Fig. 2(a). However, Table 2 shows that effluent carbohydrate concentrations were 4.5 and 2.4g COD/L, meaning more than 83% of carbohydrate was degraded. CH4 content of the biogas was below the detection limit (0.06%) in the whole operation period. It meant that carbohydrate was converted to other fermentation products such as organic acid and alcohol. Either of the bacterial contamination from organic waste and improper operating conditions such as pH, HRT, and substrate concentration could result in the population shift to non-H2-producing bacteria. pH was kept above 5.3±0.1 with 3M KOH, which was in the range of reported optimum pH (5.0–6.7) for H2 production using mixed cultures [2,13]. HRTs (24 and 30h) were also within the reported optimum values (18–48h) for organic wastes [5,6]. Hawkes et al. [12] assumed fed-batch operation as inappropriate configuration for H2 production because low carbohydrate concentration near the end of a cycle might cause population shift to non-H2-producing acidogens. However, carbohydrate concentrations just before the decanting phase were 2.4g COD/L or higher, which was enough to prevent the population shift to non-H2-producing bacteria [14]. Meanwhile, carbohydrate concentrations just after the feeding, 12.0 and 12.7g COD/L, were in the range of the acceptable initial carbohydrate level (8.9–24.0g COD/L) in batch H2 production from food waste [27]. It implied that the operating conditions, pH, HRT and substrate concentration did not cause the failure of start-up I. Then, possible reasons for failed start-up could be narrowed down to bacterial contamination from food waste. CO2 sparging was examined because it was reported to inhibit non-H2-producing bacteria including lactic acid bacteria [18]. During days 5–18, high H2 production was found in all the reactors. However, Fig. 2(b) illustrates that the H2 production drastically decreased from day 19. The reactors reached the steady poor performance after day 21. We concluded that the bacterial contamination from food waste should be prevented by different ways. Jo et al. reported a deterioration of continuous H2 production from Korean food waste due to population shift to indigenous lactic acid bacteria [9]. They prevented it by storage of feed at low temperature, 4°C. Noike et al. heat-treated bean curd manufacturing waste at 70°C for 30min and filtered because the same authors had observed that continuous hydrogen production had ceased within 5 days owing to indigenous bacteria in the waste [4,10]. Shin et al. reported that thermophilic H2 production was superior to mesophilic production where non-H2-producing acidogenesis were prevailed [3]. However, cool-storage/heat-treatment of massive organic waste or thermophilic fermentation could have some disadvantages, including high capital and operation cost in field application [2,28]. A chemical treatment might be an alternative to prevent the contamination by non-H2-producing bacteria in organic waste at moderate cost. It was reported that acid-enriched (pH 3 for 1 day) or base-enriched (pH 10 for 1 day) sewage sludge was successfully used for inoculum pretreatment in continuous H2 production from sucrose [29,30]. Consequently, the acid-treated food waste (at pH 2.0 for 1 day) was fed to reactors at start-up III. pH 2.0 was selected because it was the highest initial pH value to maintain constant pH during the acid-treatment. However, the acid-pretreatment for feedstock showed no positive effect on H2 production in this work as depicted in Fig. 2(c). At start-up IV, the base-treated food waste (at pH 12.5 for 1 day) was used. pH 12.5 was chosen as the lowest initial pH value to keep constant pH during the base-treatment. Fig. 2(d) illustrates that this attempt was successful. Steady hydrogen production over 7.1mL H2/g VS was achieved; 18.0 and 24.5mL H2/g VS of H2 production were maintained during days 22–30 at 24 and 30h HRTs, respectively. Chemical cost for the base-pretreatment might be challenged. However, the reduced base addition during H2 production complemented it. Increased alkalinity of the feed decreased the demand of base to maintain the pH in the reactor above 5.3±0.1. At 24h HRT, 2.9meq OH−/g VS was added, while 8.8meq OH−/g VS was added at start-up I. As the base addition for the pretreatment was 7.0meq OH−/g VS, total base dosage at start-up IV was 9.9meq OH−/g VS. Only 11% (1.1meq OH−/g VS) increased base dosage enabled the successful start-up. From day 31, enhanced biomass retention using settling was applied for 24h HRT. Within 25 days, the reactors showed steady (±7%) H2 production as shown in Fig. 3 . The maximum H2 yields of 62.6mL H2/g VS (0.87mol H2/mol hexoseadded) was achieved. The VSS in the mixed liquor increased from 9.3 to 27.4g/L, which may have been related to the enhanced H2 production through retention of active H2-producing bacteria. The maximum H2 yields were comparable to the reported maximum values (24.0–189.5mL H2/g VS) in continuous processes fed with organic solid waste and even the reported maximum values (0.6–2.5mol H2/mol hexoseadded) from a continuous operation fed with glucose or sucrose [2]. Organics in food waste were converted to H2, soluble by-products (organic acids and alcohols), and biomass. Fig. 4 shows COD mass balance between influent and effluent. More than 1% of total COD was converted to H2 at only start-up IV and the following further operation. Carbohydrate would be the main substrate converted to H2 and soluble by-products in this work [2]. The feedstock also contains protein and lipid. However, effluent ammonia concentration was lower than influent concentration (1.1±0.1g/L), which meant H2/soluble by-products production/consumption by protein degradation could be negligible in this study. Lipid content was minor (2.6±1.1% of VS). Furthermore, the degradation of long-chain fatty acids, the large portion of lipid, is thermodynamically unfavorable at H2 fermentation [19]. Soluble by-products included acetate, propionate, n-butyrate, lactate, ethanol, and isopropanol as shown in Table 2. Trace amount of formate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, n-caproate, n-propanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, and sec-butanol was also detected [each trace byproduct is <1% of total COD]. Among organic acids, n-butyrate productions at start-up IV were higher than those in other start-up conditions. Concurrent n-butyrate production with H2 production was reported in many previous studies using pure cultures of Clostridium spp. and naturally derived microflora. On the other hand, acetate, propionate, and lactate productions decreased at start-up IV. It is almost impossible to estimate the contribution of acetate production to H2 production by mixed microflora because it can be formed during either H2 production or H2 consumption [14]. Propionate is a well-known product of H2 consumption. The increase of ethanol, a reducing end product, was observed at the conditions; however, the decrease of lactate, another reducing end product, might compensate it. Isopropanol was found only at start-up IV. Unlike other alcohols such as ethanol and butanol, 1mol of isopropanol could be produced together with 3mol of H2 from 1mol of hexose as shown in Eq. (1) [31]. For H2 production, 0.6g COD of isopropanol production is equivalent to 1.0g COD of n-butyrate production. (1) C6H12O6 +4H2O→CH3CH(OH)CH3 +3HCO3 − +3H+ +3H2, ΔG 0′=−200kJ/mol At the further operation with high SRT, n-butyrate concentration slightly decreased, although it was still the most abundant organic acid. Instead, isopropanol concentration increased with H2 production, which would explain the improved H2 production. The calculated increment of H2 production based on butyrate and isopropanol was 43.7mL/g VS ({ΔHBu g COD/L×mol HBu/160g COD×2mol H2/mol HBu+ΔPrOH g COD/L HBu×mol PrOH/144g COD×3mol H2/mol PrOH}×22400mL/mol H2 ×L/44g VS), which was near the observed increment, 44.6mL/g VS."
8,Reduction of indigenous bacteria in food waste by chemical pretreatment,"3.2 Reduction of indigenous bacteria in food waste by chemical pretreatment Food waste, the leftover and nutritive organic waste, is regarded as putrescible [9]. The colony-forming units (CFUs) of anaerobic bacteria/g VS of ground food waste was 8.7log. The base-treatment showed a 4.9log reduction in CFU/g VS for 1 day as shown in Fig. 5 . It affirmed that the successful operation at start-up IV resulted from the reduction of indigenous non-H2-producing bacteria in food waste. Even if H2-producing bacteria were in food waste, they would survive during the pretreatment owing to their spore-forming characteristics. Acid-treatment also showed a rapid bactericidal effect for 0.5h. However, the CFU/g VS values at further incubation were not much different from that at 0.5h. A 2.6log reduction in CFU/g VS was found for 1 day. Less impact of acid-treatment might be caused by the acclimation of some indigenous bacteria to low pH. The pH value of the ground food waste was 4.6 owing to partial putrefaction, fermented foods and added organic acids for flavor and preservation [9]."
9,Analysis of microflora population,"3.3 Analysis of microflora population Mixed liquors at ends of start-up I, start-up IV and the further operation using settling at 24h HRT were sampled for microbial analysis. Fig. 6 illustrates the DGGE profiles of the 16S rDNA gene fragment amplified from the sample. The major bands were excised and purified to determine the sequence. Table 3 shows the sequence affiliation of major bands and their characteristics, respectively. At start-up I, all the five bands were related to presumptively non-H2-producing acidgens. Megasphaera elsdenii (bands 1 and 6) was known to ferment mainly carbohydrates and lactate to acetate, propionate, and butyrate [32]. Megasphaera micronuciformis (band 4) was reported to carbohydrate to acetate, propionate, and butyrate [33]. Microbacterium phyllosphaerae (band 5) was known as proteolytic–saccharolytic bacteria. The bacteria could produce organic acids but no hydrogen [34]. Dialister invisus was known to ferment carbohydrates to acetate and propionate [35]. As the authors used heat-treated inoculum, the non-H2-producing acidogens would mainly come from food waste. Kim also reported that the indigenous microbial community in food waste was dominated by non-H2-producing acidogens, so when food waste was left by itself at mesophilic condition, non-H2-producing acidogenesis occurred [36]. At start-up IV, eight major bands were examined. All the bands were totally different from start-up I owing to the base-pretreament of the possible microbial contamination source. Among them, seven bands were related to H2-producing bacteria. Six bands (bands 2, 3, and 7–10) were related to one species, Clostridium proteoclasticum. The proteolytic–saccharolytic bacterium could ferment to carbohydrates to hydrogen [37]. Band 11 was affiliated with Anaerotruncus colihominis within Clostridium leptum subgroup [38]. The species was known as a saccharolytic bacterium which is able to produce hydrogen. Exiguobacterium aurantiacum (band 12) was reported as a facultative alkaliphile [39]. DGGE profiles at further operation showed similar results with those at start-up IV. All the bands except band 12 were found again. It meant that all the seven bands were related to H2-producing bacteria. In H2 fermentation using mixed cultures, the increase in total biomass does not always accompany the increase in H2 production due to microbial population changes [12,13]. However, in this study, the base-pretreatment of feedstock, the selection of H2-producing bacteria in start-up, and appropriate operating conditions could suppress the unintended phenomena."
10,Conclusion,Process instability is a frequently reported phenomenon in fermentative H2 production. This study aimed to examine the reason of instability and to establish a reliable method for continuous H2 production from food waste at mesophilic and non-aseptic condition. Base-pretreatment at pH 12.5 for 1 day reduced indigenous anaerobic bacteria in food waste by 4.9 and it enabled a successful long-term operation over 90 days. PCR–DGGE analyses verified that the base-pretreatment of organic solid waste would prevent the microbial population shift to non-H2-producing acidogens.
