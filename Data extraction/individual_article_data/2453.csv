0,Introduction,"The use of fossil fuels is associated with adverse environmental effects. Moreover, the reserves of oil and natural gas are limited and are likely to be depleted in the next 50–100 years [1]. Therefore, the search for possible alternative sources of energy to replace fossil fuels is desirable. In recent years, hydrogen is projected as an energy carrier and substitute of fossil fuels [2,3]. The greatest advantage of hydrogen is that it is environment friendly and reduces global greenhouse gas emissions. The introduction of efficient hydrogen-based end-use technologies such as fuel cells would help in reducing primary energy consumption and provide regional and global environmental benefits. Conventionally, hydrogen is produced mainly from fossil fuels (natural gas) by steam reforming. Other industrial methods are coal gasification and water electrolysis [4]. However, these methods use non-renewable energy sources to produce hydrogen and are thus not sustainable in long run. Therefore, hydrogen production from renewable energy sources is desirable. In recent reports, hydrogen production by biological methods is projected as a clean and climate neutral energy system [4]. These processes mostly operate at ambient temperatures and pressures, thus are expected to be less energy intensive than thermochemical or electrochemical methods. In addition, they can use various waste materials, which facilitate waste recycling. Hydrogen can be produced biologically by various processes, such as direct and indirect biophotolysis, dark fermentation and photofermentation. Among these methods, dark fermentation is a promising method due to its higher rate of hydrogen evolution as well as the versatility of the organic substrates used. However, the main constraint of this method is the low yield of hydrogen per mole of organic substrate consumed [5], resulting in an unviable alternative to existing thermochemical or electrochemical processes of hydrogen generation [4]. Therefore, improvement in yields of hydrogen production in dark fermentation is a key step towards its commercialization. These processes utilize microorganisms, which have the metabolic capability of producing hydrogen. Since these organisms are obtained from natural resources, these are optimized towards growth and not for product yield. Significant improvement in product yield can be expected through genetic modifications in the microorganisms. In the past, genetic modifications were obtained through random processes such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light etc., but with the advent of metabolic engineering these efforts have become more systematic. With the help of metabolic engineering techniques, the effect of intended genetic modification on the product formation can be analyzed a priori. Many authors describe techniques to analyze metabolic networks under stationary conditions [6–8]. Among these techniques, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is of central importance especially when the goal is to maximize the product yield [9]. MFA is a tool for calculating intracellular fluxes from extracellular fluxes. If the measured fluxes are not sufficient to determine all intracellular fluxes, optimization approaches are applied. This method was mainly established by Edwards et al. [6] and was called “flux balance analysis” (FBA). The analysis of possible metabolic routes falls into “metabolic network analysis” (MNA). MFA technique has been applied to optimize production of lysine [10], acetate [11], ethanol [12], etc. However, MFA for biological hydrogen production has not been reported. In the present work, we focus on evaluating metabolic fluxes in Escherichia coli (E. coli). We analyze the theoretical capability of the microorganism to produce hydrogen. We use existing experimental data to calculate fluxes in a batch culture and comment on the limitations on the yield of hydrogen."
1,Metabolic flux analysis,"MFA yields steady-state reaction rates of the metabolic reactions in microorganism. The stoichiometry of the intracellular metabolic reactions is an input for the MFA. The reaction rates (or metabolic fluxes) are calculated based on the assumption of pseudo-steady state for all the intracellular concentrations of the metabolites and involving molar balances for all the intracellular metabolites. The solution is constrained by measuring the production or consumption rates of extracellular metabolites. The intracellular metabolite concentrations, reaction fluxes, and the stoichiometry in a metabolite system are related by a dynamic mass balance equation given below [11]: (1) d x d t = S · v , where x is a m × 1 concentration vector, v is a r × 1 reaction rate vector, t is time, and S is the m × r stoichiometric matrix, in which the element of the ith row and jth column is obtained by the stoichiometric coefficient of species i in reaction j. Assuming pseudo-steady state for the intracellular metabolites, left-hand side of Eq. (1) becomes zero, which leads to (2) S · v = 0 . Since, the number of reactions (r) are always greater than the number of intracellular metabolites (m), the degree of freedom is given by F = r - m . Therefore, some of the elements in v have to be measured in order to determine the remaining reactions rates. The system becomes determined and the solution is unique, if exactly F fluxes are measured. In order to obtain the solution, measured rates in v can be collected in a new vector, v m , and the remaining elements of vector v in another vector, v c . Similarly, the stoichiometric coefficients in matrix S are partitioned by collecting those of the measured reactions in S m and the remaining in matrix S c [13]. Eq. (2) may then be written as (3) S m · v m + S c · v c = 0 . Because exactly F = r - m fluxes are measured, S c is a square matrix (dimension m × m) and, if this matrix can be inverted, then v c can be found from (4) v c = - ( S c ) - 1 · S m · v m . However, if less than F fluxes are measured, then the system becomes underdetermined, and the unknown fluxes can then be determined by imposing an overall optimization criterion on the metabolic balances. In such a case the maximum of a flux is determined by imposing Eq. (2) as the constraint as given below. (5) max ( v i ) s . t S · v = 0 at - ∞ < v i < ∞ , where v i is the rate of i th reaction."
2,The stoichiometric model for E. coli,"The general biochemistry of fermentative metabolism in E. coli is well known. It transforms glucose into the precursor metabolites, energy for biomass growth and fermentation products, as shown in Fig. 1 . Under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of alternative electron acceptors, E. coli converts glucose to a mixture of products by fermentation [14]. The major products are acetate, lactate, ethanol, formate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide in addition to small amounts of succinate. The precursor metabolites are the branch points leading to biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and building blocks for the cell envelope. The following assumptions are made, in order to develop the stoichiometric model: (1) Biomass composition is assumed as the protein composition of E. coli cells, given in Battley [15], and represented by a unit carbon formula CH 1.601 O 0.291 N 0.286 S 0.009 . Hence, 1mol of biomass (based on unit carbon formula) is equal to 22.549gDW. (2) Stoichiometric coefficients of precursor metabolites necessary to produce biomass are taken from Neidhardt [16]. (3) Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are also produced as fermentation products. However, they are not considered in the analysis as they are produced in low amounts [17]. (4) Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh) complex is largely repressed [14] and the only role of pdh is to provide precursor metabolites like α -ketoglutarate (see reaction 25 in Appendix A). The stoichiometric model contains 31 compounds and 27 pathway reactions. Pseudo-steady state is assumed for 21 intracellular metabolites resulting in a model with six degrees of freedom. The stoichiometric matrix S is given in Table 1 . The condition number of the stoichiometric matrix is 18, which shows that the model is numerically robust [13]. The last column of S corresponds to biomass formation rate and contains the stoichiometric coefficients of the precursor metabolites necessary to produce biomass."
3,Results and discussion,"Metabolic fluxes for anaerobic growth of E. coli are solved using the stoichiometric matrix given in Table 1 as constraints. The fluxes are evaluated for the optimum hydrogen production as shown in Fig. 1. The maximum yield for hydrogen production is 2mol for every mole of glucose consumed. It should be noted that no biomass growth is obtained for this condition. Thus, in reality such a metabolic state cannot be attained. The analysis indicates that the maximum hydrogen production is accompanied by acetate and ethanol formation. Formation of these by-products is essential towards balancing the NADH produced during the glycolysis. In glycolysis, 2mol of NADH is produced for every mole of glucose consumed. Maximum hydrogen production is determined by the way this NADH is recycled by conversion of pyruvate to fermentation products. In E. coli, maximum 2mol of hydrogen is produced for every mole of glucose consumed via pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) and formate hydrogen lyase (fhl) [18,19] and in order to balance the NADH produced during the glycolysis, ethanol needs to be produced (Fig. 2 a). However in strict anaerobes (Fig. 2b), maximum 2mol of hydrogen is produced via pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pfor) and NADH produced during glycolysis is reoxidized to produce two extra moles of hydrogen by ferredoxin–oxidoreductase, ferredoxin and hydrogenase [18]. Hence in strict anaerobes, maximum 4mol of hydrogen is produced per mole of glucose consumed. Fig. 3 shows the flux distribution obtained through the analysis using maximization of biomass as the objective function. In such a metabolic state, the maximum biomass yield is 1.97mol for every mole of glucose consumed (approximately 44.4gDW / mol glucose consumed). Further, the hydrogen yield decreases to 1.4mol per mole of glucose consumed. Even in this case, both acetate and ethanol are produced; however, at lower yields. Other by-products such as lactate, glycerol and succinate are not essential to maintain optimality of the biomass synthesis. Kabir et al. [20] have reported the fermentation data for the growth of E. coli under anaerobic condition in a batch culture. We have determined the fluxes in the metabolic network from the uptake rate of glucose and production rates of lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate and formate (see Table 2 ) as input to the MFA. It should be noted that we do not utilize the production rate of hydrogen as input, implying that this rate is predicted. The flux distribution is shown in Fig. 4 . The stoichiometric molar balances predict that the rate of biomass formation was 0.63mol (14.2gDW) per mole of glucose consumed and a hydrogen production rate of 0.17mol per mole of glucose consumed. Lactate was also produced in this case, which was used for recycling NADH. Substantial amount of acetate and ethanol were also synthesized during the fermentation for ATP and redox balance. Genetic engineering can be applied to develop mutant strains by knocking out specific genes to eliminate any particular reaction. Fig. 5 shows the flux distribution for a mutant strain lacking lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). This eliminates the reaction of lactate formation from pyruvate (i.e. v 18 = 0 in Fig. 6 ). Rates for ldh lacking strain are obtained from Kabir et al. [20] that are listed in Table 2. Such a flux distribution demonstrates that hydrogen production increased to 0.23mol from 0.17mol per mole of glucose consumed. This indicates a 35% increase in hydrogen production. In the absence of ldh, redox balancing was not possible through lactate formation; therefore more ethanol was produced to balance the redox potential. It increases the production rate of formate and acetyl-CoA (reaction 21 in Appendix A) from 117 to 146 (Figs. 4 and 5), which finally increases the hydrogen and residual formate production. Further, acetate formation also increased to avoid accumulation of pyruvate inside the cell. The hydrogen production yield in E. coli can also be increased (upto 1.2mol of hydrogen/mole of glucose) by using immobilized whole cells containing fhl activity [18]. Improvement in hydrogen production was achieved in strict anaerobes also through redirection of metabolic pathways. Kumar et al. [21] achieved hydrogen production of 3.4mol for per mole of glucose consumed in Enterobacter cloacae (strict anaerobe) by blocking the formation of alcohol and some organic acids using the proton suicide technique with NaBr and NaBrO 3 . Similar enhancement of hydrogen yield using Enterobacter aerogenes HU-101 was reported by blocking the formation of alcohol and the acidic metabolites [22]. Liu et al. [23] reported hydrogen yield of 2.61 mol / mole of glucose for ack-deleted mutant of Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 as compared to 1.35mol / mole of glucose for parent strain. MFA can also be used to determine the feasible operating space for a given objective function such as production of hydrogen. Eq. (5) is used to evaluate the space for hydrogen production against varying yields of acetate and ethanol. The constraints imposed to evaluate the fluxes are (i) less than 10% of the total carbon in the glucose forms biomass and (ii) net ATP accumulation rate was greater than 0mmol / 100mmol of glucose uptake. Maximization of net accumulation of ATP was the criterion to establish the molar balances to yield feasible flux distribution. Fig. 6a shows the feasible set of acetate and ethanol yields for hydrogen production. It is clear from the figure that both acetate and ethanol has to be produced for the synthesis of hydrogen. The maximum hydrogen production (200mmol / 100mmol of glucose uptake) occurs when both acetate and ethanol production rates are maximum (100mmol / 100mmol of glucose uptake). The figure also shows the location of the acetate and ethanol yields in the feasible set for the data reported by Kabir et al. [20] for parent strain (as empty square) and for strain lacking ldh (as empty oval). The genetic manipulation increased the yields of both acetate and ethanol while moving towards maximum hydrogen synthesis. The same analysis is used to determine the feasible set of production rates of lactate and succinate for hydrogen production (see Fig. 6b). This figure clearly confirms that both lactate and succinate are not necessary for hydrogen synthesis and the maximum occurs when both are zero. Fig. 6b shows the production rates for lactate and succinate for the cases (i) for parent strain (as empty square); (ii) mutant strain lacking ldh (as empty oval); and (iii) maximum hydrogen synthesis rate (dark oval) , in the feasible set. In this case, the mutations resulted in decreasing the yields of succinate and lactate, thus predicting improvement in hydrogen synthesis."
4,Conclusion,"MFA is a powerful tool to analyze the capability of an organism to produce a specific metabolite of interest. The analysis also suggests and quantifies the methodology to improve strains towards higher productivity. We applied this methodology of flux distribution to evaluate the metabolic network of E. coli for hydrogen production. The analysis yielded the maximum synthesis rate for both hydrogen and biomass. The analysis of the experimental data of Kabir et al. [20] resulted in a flux distribution indicating a hydrogen production of 0.17mol per mole of glucose consumption. The predicted hydrogen production for mutant strain lacking ldh was 0.23mol per mole of glucose consumed. The prediction based on strains lacking ldh indicated a possible methodology to increase the hydrogen production. This also implies that the yields of acetate and ethanol play an important role in fixing the synthesis rate of hydrogen. It was also found that the maximum hydrogen production (2mol per mole of glucose consumed) corresponds to zero biomass growth. However, in reality such a metabolic state cannot be attained since higher number of cells is also necessary for hydrogen production. MFA methodology can be applied to other microorganisms also to analyze their hydrogen production capabilities and other related issues. Optimization based on dynamic modeling of the process needs to be performed in order to find the optimum hydrogen production. Mutant strains need to be developed to prove the predictions of higher yields of hydrogen made by MFA."
