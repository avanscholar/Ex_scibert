0,Introduction,"2-Phenylethanol (2-PE), an aromatic alcohol with a pleasant rose-like fragrance, is widely used in the cosmetic and food industries. 2-PE is traditionally extracted from rose, the yield is typically low (Etschmann et al., 2002). Nowadays, 2-PE is mostly produced by chemical synthesis, which is environmentally unfriendly and produces unwanted by-products (Xu et al., 2007). On the other hand, biotechnologically produced flavors are currently considered as natural by European and U.S. food agencies (Xu et al., 2007). Therefore, biotechnological 2-PE production is highly desirable and holds promise to be the most commercially viable route to produce 2-PE (Hua and Xu, 2011). 2-PE can be produced by yeast via the Ehrlich pathway from L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) (Hazelwood et al., 2008). There are three reactions involved in this synthetic pathway ( Fig. 1a). First, aromatic transaminase converts L-Phe to phenylpyruvate (PPA) using 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) as an amine receptor. Second, PPA is converted to phenylacetaldehyde (PAAL) by phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). Finally, aldehyde reductase or alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts PAAL to 2-PE, at the expense of the cell's reducing power. Great efforts have been made on yeast-based production of 2-PE, encompassing metabolic engineering, fermentation and process engineering, leading to the production of about 6g/L 2-PE by yeast fermentation (Eshkol et al., 2009; Etschmann and Schrader, 2006; Kim et al., 2014; Morrissey et al., 2015; Stark et al., 2002). Furthermore, since cell growth is inhibited by the accumulated 2-PE (Etschmann and Schrader, 2006), in situ product removal (ISPR) has been used to extract 2-PE in the aqueous phase to circumvent the problem of product inhibition, which is proven to be a useful approach. Extractants such as polypropylene glycol 1200 and Hytrel® 8206 were used to remove 2-PE from the fermentation broth, and 10.2–20.4g/L 2-PE was achieved in 30–36h (Etschmann and Schrader, 2006; Gao and Daugulis, 2009). However the yeast fermentation process usually takes 30–50h or even a few days, so 2-PE productivity is relatively low (Etschmann and Schrader, 2006; Mei et al., 2009). E. coli is a widely used chassis for the production of fine chemicals because it is fast-growing and easy to manipulate. However, E. coli cannot intrinsically produce 2-PE because it lacks PDC, which converts PPA to PAAL (Koma et al., 2012). By heterogeneously overexpressing PDC from Azospirillum brasilense, the engineered E. coli was able to produce 6.9mM 2-PE (Koma et al., 2012). To further improve the efficiency of the pathway, well-characterized genes encoding phenylacetaldehyde synthase and phenylacetaldehyde reductase from plants were introduced to optimize the 2-PE biosynthetic pathway in E. coli (Achmon et al., 2014; Sakai et al., 2007). The shikimic acid pathway was redesigned to increase the supply of the intermediate (PPA) and 2-PE production from glucose was improved to 2.33mM (0.285g/L) (Kang et al., 2014). Hwang et al. engineered E. coli for the whole-cell bioconversion of phenylalanine and 38mM (4.7g/L) 2-PE was produced from 100mM L-Phe (Hwang et al., 2009). However, the yield of 2-PE produced by engineered E. coli remained low. For the biosynthesis of 2-PE, 2-OG and NAD(P)H are required for the transamination and dehydrogenation reactions, respectively, the limited cofactor supply and redox imbalance remain major bottlenecks. Cofactor recycling is key not only to lower process costs, but also to drive the reaction of interest to completion. When reducing power is needed in a whole-cell biotransformation process, introducing an oxidoreductase is one solution to recycle NAD(P)H, and often leads to improved catalytic efficiency (Hummel and Groger, 2014). The enzymes most commonly exploited to recycle NAD(P)H are formate dehydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase, which obtain reduction equivalents by oxidizing a sacrificial substrate (Kratzer et al., 2015). For example, by coupling the relevant reaction to the oxidation of formate to CO2 for NADH regeneration, o-chloroacetophenone and xylose were reduced to (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol and xylitol with high yield (Eixelsberger et al., 2013; Madje et al., 2012). For 2-PE biosynthesis, glucose dehydrogenase was overexpressed in engineered E. coli for NADPH regeneration, which resulted in a 3-fold increase of 2-PE yield (4.7g/L), compared to the parent strain without glucose dehydrogenase (Hwang et al., 2009). This enzymatic approach thus offered a solution for NAD(P)H regeneration and resulted in higher yield. However, since enzyme-mediated cofactor recycling for NAD(P)H regeneration consumes a sacrificial substrate, and an additional coproduct is produced, this approach increases the complexity of product purification, and thus adds up the overall process costs. In addition, the high concentrations of sacrificial substrate or coproduct may inhibit enzyme activity. Recently, Mutti et al. developed an elegant redox self-sufficient system using alcohol and amine dehydrogenases, which operate in tandem to convert alcohols to amines with hydrogen shuttled by a nicotinamide coenzyme (Mutti et al., 2015). However, for a biosynthesis pathway consuming both cosubstrate and redox equivalents, such as 2-PE biosynthesis, the simultaneous regeneration of cosubstrate and redox equivalents remains a challenge. Metabolic engineering strategies have to be devised to generate a more efficient biocatalyst for enhanced production of 2-PE from the perspective of cofactor supply and regeneration. In this study, a heterogeneous 2-PE biosynthetic pathway was constructed in E. coli, and the pathway flux was increased by substituting key enzymes. Glutamate dehydrogenase was found to play a crucial role in cofactor regeneration and in maintaining redox balance during 2-PE biosynthesis. Therefore, we designed a “bridge” between L-Phe and 2-PE using glutamate dehydrogenase, to develop a cofactor and redox self-sufficient system for efficient 2-PE production. The system was further improved by removing the by-product NH3 to form a cleaner process. Finally, this cofactor self-sufficiency strategy was applied to the bioconversion of L-Phe into D-phenyllactic acid (D-PLA). The cofactor and redox self-sufficient strategy has the potential to enhance the production of a number of desirable chemicals with respect to cofactor regeneration and balance."

The primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The PCR products were inserted into pRB1s yielding a series of pRB1s derivatives using the Gibson assembly method."
5,Bioconversion conditions,"2.4 Bioconversion conditions For 2-PE bioconversion, cells were collected after 16h culture, by centrifugation at 8000×g for 10min, washed with ice-cold 0.85% NaCl solution twice, and suspended in 200μL (OD600 = 30) reaction mixture containing 50mM L-Phe and 50mM MOPS buffer (pH = 6.5). The bioconversion reactions were performed at 30°C on a 250rpm shaker for 12h. L-Glu and zeolite were added as required. For bioconversions producing D-PLA, cells were collected and washed with ice-cold 0.85% NaCl solution twice, and suspended in 200μL (OD600 = 30) reaction mixture containing 50mM L-Phe, 50mM Tris-HCl buffer and 5mM L-Glu (pH 8.0).

Additional 35mM L-Phe (17.5mL of 2M L-phenylalanine sodium) was added within 1h after 6h bioconversion. The total concentration of L-Phe used in the system was 85mM. The scaled-up bioconversion was performed in a 5L fermenter at 200rpm and 30°C with a 1.0vvm air flow rate. The pH was maintained at pH 6.5."

The expression of recombinant enzymes was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The concentrations of L-Phe, PPA, PAAL, 2-PE and D-PLA were measured by HPLC (Agilent 1260 series, Hewlett–Packard) with a Waters XBridge C-18 3.5µm column (4.6*150mm). The analysis was performed at 25°C with a mobile phase comprising 30% acetonitrile in water at a flow rate of 0.5mL/min and the analytes were detected at OD210nm. The 2-PE concentration in Hytrel® 8206 was determined according to a previous study (Zaganas et al., 2013)."
8,Results,
9,Construction and optimization of the 2-PE biosynthetic pathway in E. coli,"3.1 Construction and optimization of the 2-PE biosynthetic pathway in E. coli A heterologous Ehrlich pathway was constructed for 2-PE biosynthesis in E. coli by co-overexpressing the aromatic transaminase from E. coli (TyrB, WP032305522.1), phenylpyruvate decarboxylase from S. cerevisiae (Aro10, NP 010668.3) and alcohol dehydrogenase from S. cerevisiae (ADH1, NP 014555.1) under the control of the pBAD promoter (Hazelwood et al., 2008; Hwang et al., 2009). The resulting E. coli strain BW25113 pRB1s-aro10-adh1-tyrB (designated as 31B) was used as the whole-cell biocatalyst, and 7.8mM 2-PE was obtained from 50mM L-Phe in a 12h bioconversion (Fig. S1). The overall stoichiometric equation of the reactions in this biosynthetic system is: (1) L-Phe+2-OG+NAD(P)H+H+→2-PE+L-Glu+NAD(P)++CO2 To optimize the engineered 2-PE biosynthetic pathway, the alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1 was substituted with YahK (WP 057696407.1) from E. coli (Koma et al., 2012) and Par (BAG13450.2) the phenylacetaldehyde reductase from the rose (Rosa sp.) (Chen et al., 2011). The engineered strains with Par (32B) and YahK (33B) produced 30.4mM and 29.5mM 2 -PE, respectively, which was significantly more than the strain with ADH1 (31B)(7.8mM) (Fig. 1b). For PPA decarboxylation, the indolepyruvate/phenylpyruvate decarboxylase from Azospirillum brasilense (AbPDC, WP 038529346) (Koma et al., 2012; Spaepen et al., 2007)and a PDC from Zymomonas mobilis (ZmPDC, WP 011241152.1) were tested (Chang et al., 2000). The engineered strains coexpressing TyrB and Par with different PDCs, 32B (Aro10), 34B (AbPDC) and 35B (ZmPDC) produced 30.4, 12.7 and 1.0mM 2-PE, respectively (Fig. 1c). The results showed that the engineered strain 32B which coexpressed TyrB, Aro10 and PAR was the most suitable for 2-PE production, yielding 30.4mM 2-PE at a conversion rate of 60.8mol% (Fig. S2)."
10,Glutamate dehydrogenase plays a key role in 2-PE biosynthesis,"3.2 Glutamate dehydrogenase plays a key role in 2-PE biosynthesis The production of 2-PE was significantly increased (~3.8 fold) in the engineered E coli strains expressing NADPH-dependent PAR or YahK compared with the strain with the NADH-dependent ADH1 (Fig. 1b). We speculated the cofactor preference of the reductases was responsible for the difference in 2-PE production. In E. coli, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) converts L-glutamate (L-Glu) and NADP+ to 2-OG and NADPH (Hudson and Daniel, 1993). We hypothesized that the NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase might play a role in 2-PE biosynthesis by coupling it to NADPH regeneration. To test this hypothesis, the glutamate dehydrogenase in the E. coli BW25113 was knocked-out, and a significant decrease of 2-PE production (7.6mM) was observed in the GDH-deficient strain E. coli ΔgdhA (32G) (Fig. 1d). When GDH was functionally complemented with EcGDH (WP 044790188.1) expression in plasmid, the production was increased 3.8- fold, and 28.9mM of 2-PE was obtained (Fig. 1d). However, when NADH-dependent ADH1 was expressed, there was no obvious difference in 2-PE production between the strains, whether gdhA was knocked-out or not (Fig. 1e). These results suggested that the NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase in E. coli, which catalyzes the conversion of L-Glu and NADP+ to 2-OG and NADPH, may help to regenerate the cosubstrate and redox equivalents in the 2-PE whole-cell transformation process."
11,The self-sufficient system with coordinated enzymes,"3.3 The self-sufficient system with coordinated enzymes We anticipated that coupling GDH to transaminase and cascading with reductase would be restricted by cofactor matching. It was clearly demonstrated by the poor production of 2-PE when the cofactor requirement was not matched, as in the case of the NADPH-dependent EcGDH and the NADH-dependent ADH1 (Fig. 1e). To further prove this hypothesis, ΔgdhA was used as the chassis to negate the influence of EcGDH. NADH-dependent GDHs including BsGDH from B. subtilis (WP 003227482.1) and PaGDH from Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (P28997.1) and NADPH-dependent GDHs including hGDH from Homo sapiens (NP 005262.1) and EcGDH were expressed in ΔgdhA as replacements for EcGDH in the E. coli genome ( Fig. 2a). When NADH-dependent ADH1 was used for the reduction of the final step of 2-PE synthesis, strains expressing NADH-dependent GDHs (such as BsGDH and PaGDH) produced much more 2-PE than those with NADPH-dependent GDHs (such as hGDH and EcGDH) (Fig. 2b). More than 250% increase of 2-PE production was obtained by strain 41G with NADH-dependent BsGDH (21.8mM) compared to that of the strain without BsGDH (31G) (8.5mM) (Fig. 2b). When NADPH-dependent PAR was matched with the NADPH-dependent EcGDH (47G), and hGDH (48G), the production of 2-PE reached 28.9 and 26.2mM, respectively, about twice that obtained with NADPH-dependent GDHs (Fig. 2c). The strain coexpressing PAR and EcGDH produced the highest amount of 2-PE (28.9mM). These results further proved that GDH plays a key role in cofactor and redox balance, and that there was cooperation between GDH and alcohol dehydrogenase or phenylacetaldehyde reductase. We subsequently designed a “bridge” between L-Phe and 2-PE using glutamate dehydrogenase ( Fig. 3a). The GDHs regenerated NAD(P)H and shifted the reaction towards 2-PE synthesis. Consequently, the endogenous amine donor (L-Glu) and amine acceptor (2-OG) of the transamination step were recycled concomitantly with cofactor regeneration in the reduction step. By coupling glutamate dehydrogenase with transaminase and alcohol dehydrogenase (41G and 42G) or phenylacetaldehyde reductase (47G and 48G), the cofactor (2-OG) and reduction equivalents (NAD(P)H) were regenerated simultaneously, so that no external additional cofactor or redox source was required. Thus, a cofactor self-sufficient system was obtained. Furthermore, the results indicated that the cofactor specificity of GDHs should be coordinated with the cofactor specificity of the reductases, and only in such a case was the self-sufficient system able to be activated to produce 2-PE with high efficiency. With this cofactor system, the equation of the overall reactions in the 2-PE biosynthesis can thus be simplified as: (2) L-Phe+2H2O→2-PE+CO2+NH4 ++OH-"
12,Improve the efficiency of the self-sufficient system using L-Glu and zeolite,"3.4 Improve the efficiency of the self-sufficient system using L-Glu and zeolite In the 2-PE biosynthesis system, L-Glu is the substrate of GDH to determine the effect of L-Glu on 2-PE production, different concentrations of L-Glu were used in the bioconversion mixture using 32B as the biocatalyst. The results showed that low concentration of L-Glu (1 ~10mM) enhanced 2-PE production significantly ( Fig. 4a). The maximum amount of 2-PE (45.2mM) was obtained when 10mM L-Glu was added, with a conversion rate of 90.4mol% (Fig. 4a). While in the strain without a self-sufficient system (△gdhA pRB1s-aro10-par-tyrB, 32G), L-Glu had no significant effect on 2-PE production, and the yield was typically low, at approximately 7.5mM, (Fig. 4b). The results suggested that L-Glu acted as an accelerator of the whole-cell biocatalyst with the self-sufficient system. As the conversion progressed, ammonium was generated by the reaction catalyzed by GDH, and thus, if ammonium were removed from the mixture, the reaction could be driven towards the synthesis of NAD(P)H, which would improve the efficiency of 2-PE biosynthesis. Zeolite, a porous hydrated aluminosilicate material with a tetrahedral framework, which is an effective ammonium filter, was used to remove ammonium from the bioconversion reaction. The addition of 1g/L zeolite increased the conversion rate from 60.8mol% to 74.4mol%. When 20g/L zeolite was added, the 2-PE conversion rate further improved to 87.3mol% and 43.6mM 2-PE was achieved (Fig. 4c). On the contrary in the strain without the self-sufficient system (32G), zeolite had no significant effect on bioconversion efficiency (Fig. 4d). This result indicated that removing ammonium by zeolite stimulated the regeneration of NAD(P)H by the self-sufficient system. After removing ammonium using zeolite (NH4 ++zeolite-Na→zeolite-NH4+Na+), the self-sufficient system for the bioconversion of L-Phe to 2-PE proceeded with L-Phe as the only input besides H2O and CO2 as the only byproduct, resulting in a clean biocatalytic system. Therefore, the equation of the overall reaction was further simplified: (3) L-Phe +2H2O→2-PE+CO2"
13,Scale-up of 2-PE production,"3.5 Scale-up of 2-PE production The whole-cell bioconversion was performed in a 5L reactor using E. coli 32B as biocatalyst. The thermoplastic polyester elastomer Hytrel® 8206 was used for in situ removal of 2-PE (Gao and Daugulis, 2009). Using the in situ extractant Hytrel® 8206 and eluting with methanol, 110mM (13.38g/L) 2-PE was obtained in the polymer phase. The total 2-PE production was 9.14g/L (74.83mM), with productivity of 0.51g/L/h and yield of 88% mol from L-Phe in 18h bioconversion ( Fig. 5). The high titer of 2-PE would benefit the purification process."
14,Another example to demonstrate the system feasibility,"3.6 Another example to demonstrate the system feasibility D-Phenyllactic acid (D-PLA) is synthesized from L-Phe by transamination to PPA followed by reduction by NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LdhD) (Fig. 3b). The strain (BW25113 pRB1s-ldhD Y52L-tyrB, 22B) was constructed for D-PLA production by coexpressing TyrB from E. coli and the mutant LdhD Y52L from L. bulgaricus (WP 011543503.1) (Zheng et al., 2013). Only 5.4mM D-PLA was obtained from 50mM L-Phe by strain 22B ( Fig. 6). By overexpressing an NADH-dependent BsGDH, BW25113 pRB1s-ldhD Y52L-tyrB-BsGDH (23B) produced 20.2mM of D-PLA (with productivity of 3.32g/L/h and conversion rate of 40mol%), which was 2.74-fold higher than that of 22B (Fig. 6). The result showed that by introducing NADH-dependent BsGDH, the self-sufficient system was constructed and enhanced the production of D-PLA. Furthermore, when the chromosomal gdhA of E. coli was deleted (△gdhA pRB1s-ldhD Y52L-tyrB-Bsgdh, 23G), there was no significant difference in the D-PLA production, which suggested that NADPH-dependent EcGDH can not form the self-sufficient system with NADH-dependent LdhD. The result was coincident with the result of 2-PE production that the self-sufficient system should function with the coordinated enzymes with cofactor specificity (Fig. 6). Thus, the strategy of cofactor self-sufficient biotransformation was successfully applied to improve the efficiency of the bioconversion of L-Phe for D-PLA production (Fig. 3b)."
15,Discussion,"Due to the cytotoxicity of 2-PE, it is difficult to achieve high titer of 2-PE in the traditional fermentation processes. In whole-cell biotransformations that utilize E. coli, the cell growth stage and substrate conversion stage are separated, so that growth-inhibition is avoided. Therefore, whole-cell biotransformation using engineered E. coli are preferable for 2-PE production. In the biosynthesis of 2-PE, cofactors such as 2-OG and NAD(P)H are required for the transamination and reduction reactions, respectively. However, the intracellular 2-OG concentration was low and far from sufficient for continuous deamination. Internal cofactor regeneration was also not fast enough to cope with the enhanced 2-PE biosynthetic reactions. Consequently, the limited cofactor supply and redox imbalance remained major bottlenecks. The introduction of an oxidoreductase was applied as an important solution to recycle NAD(P)H (Blank et al., 2008). Hwang et al. had developed a whole-cell biotransformation process for 2-PE production in which glucose dehydrogenase and glucose were used for NADPH regeneration. At the same time, 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid was used as the amino acceptor so that L-homophenylalanine was produced simultaneously with 2-PE. In this system, glucose were used as sacrificial substrates, and D-gluconic acid was produced as byproduct, which increased the complexity of downstream processing (Hwang et al., 2009). Therefore, the regeneration of the cofactor and redox simultaneously without sacrificial substrates is well worth studying. In this study, we designed a cofactor self-sufficient system for 2-PE production by borrowing hydrogen from glutamate dehydrogenase reaction for reduction of the final step of 2-PE synthesis. GDHs from different species have distinct cofactor preferences (Hudson and Daniel, 1993). We used matched cofactor pairs to develop a cofactor self-sufficient system for 2-PE biosynthesis. When GDH was incorporated into the 2-PE biosynthesis, L-Glu was converted to 2-OG by GDH, with the simultaneous generation of NAD(P)H, which not only supplied sufficient reduction equivalents for the final reduction step, but also regenerated 2-OG as the cosubstrate for the initial deamination step. The two reactions catalyzed by TyrB and PAR/ADH1 were coupled like a gearwheel through GDH, which drastically improved the efficiency of the biocatalyst (Fig. 3a). Thus, a cofactor self-sufficient system based on a bridging mechanism was developed to rebalance the cosubstrate and redox equivalents simultaneously, so that no external cofactor or redox source was required. In microorganisms, GDHs are mainly responsible for nitrogen assimilation (Hudson and Daniel, 1993). GDHs tend to aminate 2-OG to L-Glu, with concomitant consumption of NAD(P)H. Therefore, GDHs are typically used for NAD(P)+ regeneration rather than for the provision of NAD(P)H (Carrea et al., 1984; Lee and Whitesides, 1986). To the best of our knowledge, the cofactor regeneration system developed in this study is the first case to apply the reversible activity of GDH for NAD(P)H regeneration. In this system, GDH converts L-Glu to 2-OG, which is then available for L-Phe deamination. 2-OG thus accepted amino from L-Phe and then remove NH3 and renewed itself with the assist of GDH. In this way, 2-OG no longer acts as a cosubstrate, but as a continually recycled cofactor of the system. Additional strategies have been applied to improve the efficiency of the self-sufficient 2-PE biosynthesis system. Firstly, L-Glu was added to the reaction system to increase the deamination rate, which provided not only the amino carrier but also the reducing force which further improved the reduction of PAAL. With the addition of L-Glu, 2-PE production was improved by 49%. Secondly, in the cofactor self-sufficient system for 2-PE production, NH3 was the only by-product. Since accumulated NH3 in the system would affect the reversible reaction of GDH, it was removed via adsorption on zeolite, which further pulled the reaction equilibrium towards the formation of 2-OG and NAD(P)H. With zeolite addition, the 2-PE production was improved by a further 43%, compared to the system without zeolite. Zeolite is widely used as an ion-exchanger for ammonium removal in water and wastewater treatment (Kwakye-Awuah et al., 2014; Wang and Peng, 2010; Wang et al., 2008). It may be the first example of zeolite being applied to a bioconversion for ammonium removal to improve the efficiency of biosynthesis reactions. Thirdly, the resin Hytrel® 8206, which showed excellent 2-PE adsorption properties, was used in the bioconversion, extracting most of the produced 2-PE into the solid phase. Together with the addition of Hytrel® 8206 and zeolite, 2-PE production was further improved to 9.14g/L. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest titer of 2-PE ever obtained in E. coli. Recently, Mutti et al. designed an elegant redox self-sufficient system in vitro, to convert alcohols to amines using alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and amine dehydrogenase (AmDH), which operate in tandem, with hydrogen shuttled by a nicotinamide coenzyme (Mutti et al., 2015). In this case, redox was regenerated, but recycling of other cofactor was not involved. Klatte et al. developed a redox self-sufficient system by cascading alcohol oxidation and L-alanine-dependent transamination with an L-alanine dehydrogenase, which allowed for the redox self-sufficient conversion of alcohols to the corresponding amines (Klatte and Wendisch, 2014, 2015). In the system, efficient redox recycling was achieved, while the regeneration efficiency of cofactor (L-alanine) was still low. High concentration of L-alanine (10–25-fold or 2–5-fold higher than that of the substrate) was required for complete conversion (Klatte and Wendisch, 2014, 2015), which indicating that L-alanine was more like a cosubstrate instead of a cofactor in the system (Klatte and Wendisch, 2014, 2015). In this study, another amino donor/acceptor (L-glu/2-OG) were used for the transamination reaction. A cofactor self-sufficient whole-cell biocatalyst was developed for 2-PE production by a “bridge” between the amino acid and its corresponding alcohol. By borrowing hydrogen from glutamate dehydrogenase reaction for reduction of the final step of 2-PE synthesis, a self-sufficient system was constructed, in which redox equivalents and cofactor were simultaneously recycled. Although the whole-cell biotransformation strategy yielded a high titer of 2-PE, the productivity was not high enough (0.51g/L/h), indicating that the system may require further improvements to meet the very high demands for cofactors and redox equivalents needed for economically competitive 2-PE production. Further studies are underway to improve the titer and productivity of the process including improving the efficiency of the cofactor regeneration system, optimizing the concentration of substrate (increasing initial concentration of L-Phe or feeding of L-Phe), screening for better extractant, optimizing in situ product removal process and so on. Although the self-sufficient system was demonstrated by limited examples (2-PE and D-PLA) in our study, the system can also be coupled to other productions. Branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), and the sulfur-containing amino acid (methionine) are assimilated by the Ehrlich pathway. Catabolism of these amino acids leads to the formation of fusel acids and fusel alcohols via the Ehrlich pathway (Table S3). After the initial transamination reaction, the resulting α-keto acid can be converted into the corresponding alcohols or acid. Transamination, decarboxylation and reduction are involved in the pathway. 2-OG and NAD(P)H are used as cofactors in the transamination and reduction steps. Our cofactor self-sufficient strategy can be applied for the production of corresponding alcohols or acid from these amino acids (Table S3). By coupling glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) with transaminase and alcohol dehydrogenase, 2-OG and redox equivalents (NAD(P)H) were regenerated simultaneously. Furthermore, transamination of the amino acid can be coupled with other reduction reactions for production of some other products. The self-sufficient system will make the addition of expensive external cofactors unnecessary. Cofactor recycling is important not only to lower the cost of a process but also to drive the reaction of interest to completion."
16,Conclusion,"In this study, a “bridge” was designed between an amino acid and a structurally equivalent fusel alcohol using glutamate dehydrogenase. A cofactor self-sufficient system was developed for enhanced 2-PE production in E. coli, so that the cofactor and redox equivalents were regenerated simultaneously, and no external cofactor or redox source was required. In this system, ammonium and CO2 are produced as the only by-products. Zeolite was applied to remove ammonia, which made the system clean and efficient. Because 2-OG is responsible for preferential amino acid deamination, and NAD(P)H can be used in many reduction reactions, especially chiral synthesis, the self-sufficient strategy for cofactor regeneration might be a universal method for resolving the cofactor and redox imbalance problem."
