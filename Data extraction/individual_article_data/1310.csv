0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be a viable alternative fuel and “energy carrier” of the future by virtue of its carbon-neutral state, recyclability, nonpolluting nature and efficient conversion to electricity by fuel cells (Akkerman et al., 2002; Basak and Das, 2007; Rupprecht et al., 2006). In addition, hydrogen has a high energy yield of 122kJ/g, which is 2.75 times greater than that of hydrocarbon fuels (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Currently, electrolysis of water, steam reforming of hydrocarbons and coal gasification are well-known conventional hydrogen production methods but they are not cost-effective or sustainable, due to their high energy intensities and large pollutant emissions (Takabatake et al., 2004). On the contrary, biological production of H2 provides a feasible means for generating a sustainable supply of H2, and is therefore expected to be a promising method for H2 production, with the advantage of low energy requirements, as the process is carried out at ambient temperature and pressure (Cheong and Hansen, 2007; Ishikawa et al., 2008; Jo et al., 2008). Currently, four groups of microorganisms (green algae, cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and fermentative bacteria) can be employed for H2 production (Kokua et al., 2002; Takabatake et al., 2004). Of these, the biological production of H2 by photosynthetic bacteria (PSB), which may represent the ultimate technology for producing clean hydrogen without the use of fossil fuels, is considered the most promising (Kondo et al., 2006). This is mainly because of the high theoretical conversion yield of organic substrates into hydrogen by PSB, the ability to trap energy over a wide range of the light spectrum for conversion into hydrogen energy and the lack of Photosystem II, which automatically eliminates the difficulties associated with O2 inhibition of H2 production (Eroğlua et al., 2004; Basak and Das, 2007; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Furthermore, PSB can produce hydrogen from organic acids, e.g. acetic, propionic, lactic and butyric acid, which offers the advantage of combining organic wastes disposal with the production of a clean fuel (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Kovács et al., 2006). Many studies on biological hydrogen production by PSB are conducted in suspended culture modes. Suspended systems allow good mass transfer between microorganisms and substrates but have difficulty maintaining a sufficient level of H2-producing bacterial cells in the bioreactor under a low hydraulic retention time (HRT), as washout of the biomass usually occurs (Lin et al., 2006) and therefore require recycling of biomass from the effluent to maintain a sufficient cell density (Wu et al., 2005). As a result, an immobilized-cell reactor, which can be integrated with a variety of bioreactor designs, such as fluidized (Laurinavichene et al., 2006) or fixed beds (Lin et al., 2006), has recently been introduced into photoheterotrophic hydrogen production systems. This immobilized-cell system can effectively enhance biomass retention using physical or biological immobilization approaches (Chang et al., 2002) and its stability and reusability are significantly enhanced, compared with suspended cell systems. Among the applied cell immobilization techniques, such as biofilms, entrapment and self-flocculation, cell entrapment in porous gels is promising for biohydrogen production because it is inexpensive and easy to handle (Wu et al., 2007b). Also, gel entrapment allows higher biomass content of H2-producing bacteria in the reactors and creates a local anaerobic environment, which is well suited to oxygen-sensitive fermentative H2 production (Lin et al., 2006). Additionally, an entrapped-cell system can be stably operated at a low HRT without suffering cells wash-out and the H2 production rate can be enhanced by elevation of organic loading rates. However, the entrapped-cell technology has not been widely adopted in H2 production by photo-fermentation because mass transfer limitations reduce the productivity in hydrogen bioconversion (Banerjee et al., 2001). Moreover, cell-entrapment gel beads must overcome the dual challenges of maintaining the desired mechanical stability and allowing light transfer during long-term operation. Currently, there is great demand for the development of feasible cell immobilization approaches for efficient H2 photo-fermentation. Several groups of investigators have attempted to improve hydrogen production through entrapment using polysaccharide gels such as agar, agarose, alginate, carrageenan and chitosan (Cheong and Hansen, 2007; Kokua et al., 2002). Some of these studies have claimed that the immobilized cells were effective for H2 production in batch mode (Jo et al., 2008) and that the entrapped-cell system was also suitable for continuous H2 production with mixed or pure cultures (Wu et al., 2007a). In the present work, a photobioreactor, packed with entrapped-PSB gel granules, was adopted in a continuous hydrogen production mode. A modified immobilization matrix containing sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol-124 and carrageenan powder was created to entrap a pure culture of PSB for efficient and stable H2 photo-fermentation. The strain used in this research was isolated from sewage sludge and identified as Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The effects of operational parameters, including light wavelength (λ), illumination intensity (I), flow rate of influent substrate solution (Q), substrate concentration (C in), temperature (T) and pH of the influent medium, were investigated to identify favorable parameter variables for H2 production by the entrapped-cell system. The outcome of this work is expected to provide useful information on the effects of multiple operation variables on the characteristics of photo-biochemical reactions and mass transfer in this immobilized-cell bioreactor for H2 production."
1,Methods,
2,Organism and cultivation,"2.1 Organism and cultivation R. palustris CQK 01 (Wang et al., 2008) was cultured on a basal culture medium comprising (g/L) C6H12O6·H2O, 4.024; K2HPO4·3H2O, 0.6; KH2PO4, 0.554; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.30; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.0018; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.0025; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.0024; NaCl, 0.20; CaCl2, 0.015; CO(NH2)2, 1.50; yeast extract, 0.40. Illumination was achieved with a tungsten filament lamp with 3000lx illumination intensity. For preculture, three loopfuls of cells were suspended in 100mL of synthetic medium containing (g/L) K2HPO4·3H2O, 1.006; KH2PO4, 0.554; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.20; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.0417; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.0010; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.0010; NaCl, 0.20; CaCl2, 0.010; CO(NH2)2, 1.35; C6H12O6·H2O, 4.024. Moreover, 1.0g yeast extract and 1mL growth factors solution (biotin, 1.0g/L; puridoxine hydrochloride, 1.0g/L; riboflavin, 1.0g/L; thiamine hydrochloride, 1.0g/L; nicotinic acid, 1.0g/L) were added to 1L of the synthetic medium to improve growth. The initial pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 7 with 0.1mol/L NaOH before sterilization. The culture (100mL) was grown anaerobically at 28°C for 72h with illumination (3000lx). Before the bottle was sealed, argon gas was introduced to create anaerobic conditions."
3,Preparation of immobilized cells,"2.2 Preparation of immobilized cells A 10% (v/v) inoculum of the 72-h culture was added to 3L of the synthetic culture medium containing 8.04g/L glucose and the culture was unilaterally illuminated with incident light from LED lamps (red light) with an illumination intensity of approximately 5000lx. Argon was used to create an anaerobic environment. After 62h (exponential phase), precipitate was removed from the culture by centrifugation at 2250 g for 5min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,300 g for 10min, washed twice with deionized water, suspended in 50mL of 0.1mmol/L phosphate buffer and used as inoculums for the preparation of bacteria-containing granules."
4,Entrapment of PSB cells in the polymeric matrix,"2.3 Entrapment of PSB cells in the polymeric matrix The test matrix components included polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, with 1750±50 degree of polymerization) (Long et al., 2004), sodium alginate (Ishikawa et al., 2006) and carrageenan powder. PVA was mixed with sodium alginate at a weight/weight ratio of 7/3. Thirty grams of the mixture was weighed and additional material (1.5g carrageenan) was added to improve the physical strength of the immobilized-cell gel granules. The composite gel solution was prepared by adding 150mL of distilled water to the powder mixture and heating at 80°C for 1.5h by an electro-thermostatic water bath until completely dissolved. After the colloid medium cooled down to room temperature, the collected bacteria (equivalent to 0.76g dry cell weight) were added and mixed thoroughly. The colloidal mixture was extruded drop-by-drop by a peristaltic pump into a crosslinking solution containing (w/v) calcium chloride (1.8%) and boric acid (2.0%). Finally the gel granules (4.0mm average diameter) entrapping R. palustris CQK 01 were obtained by stirring the crosslinking solution with a magnetic agitator. The granules were left in the crosslinking solution for about 24h for complete hardening (Long et al., 2004; Sergio and Bustos, 2009). The granules were then washed three times with 0.5% NaCl and stored in this solution at 4°C. To obtain the transparency of the matrix, a 4mm thick solid slab was made with the colloid mixture and illuminated with a tungsten filament lamp from one side. The transparency of the gel matrix, which was defined as the ratio of transmitted light intensity to incident light intensity, was obtained by measuring the light intensities on the incident side and opposite side of the solid, respectively. The compressive strength of the entrapped-cell granule was measured by using a universal material testing machine (America, Instron Model 1011)."
5,Setup and operation of a packed-bed bioreactor for H2 photo-production,"2.4 Setup and operation of a packed-bed bioreactor for H2 photo-production Continuous hydrogen production by immobilized R. palustris CQK 01 in anaerobic mode was studied in a packed-bed photobioreactor. A schematic description of the bioreactor system is shown in Fig. 1 . A flat panel photobioreactor (100×40×200mm) with a working volume of 800mL was made from transparent polymethylmethacrylate and the entrapped-cell granules were packed within it. Except for the side exposed to incident light, the surfaces of the bioreactor were covered with polyurethane foam for thermal insulation. Two heaters were arranged at the bottom of the bioreactor to maintain the designated temperature of the influent glucose solution at the inlet. Five T-type thermocouples were uniformly distributed at different heights of the bioreactor to detect internal temperatures. External illumination with a radiation area of 200mm2 was provided by four sets of LED lamps with main wavelengths of 630, 590, 520 and 470nm and the illumination intensity was adjusted from 2000 to 8000lx by varying the distance between the LEDs and the bioreactor. Transparent glass pipes were used to make gas and liquid flows visible. The components of the system were autoclaved except for the photobioreactor body which was sterilized with formalin vapor and rinsed three times with sterile water. Approximately 800mL (expanded volume) of granules was gently loaded into the photobioreactor. Thus, the photobioreactor was completely filled with granules and substrate solution during the startup and run, maximizing the efficiency of the packed-bed bioreactor because the working volume was always equal to the reactor volume. The need to use an inert gas (such as argon) to create an anaerobic atmosphere was thereby eliminated in the test system. A synthetic medium containing glucose as the sole carbon resource, in which the other components were the same as in the medium for above preculture, was introduced into the packed-bed reactor from the bottom by a peristaltic pump. The flow rate of the medium was controlled by adjusting the rotation speed of the peristaltic pump. The evolved biogas and effluent liquid was discharged from the top of the bioreactor and transferred into a gas–liquid separator. The biogas produced was collected in a glass bottle by reversible replacement of water. The entrapped-cell bioreactor was operated in two stages. During the first stage, the startup was operated in batch mode for 80h to activate the entrapped PSB and enhance the H2 producing activity. The photobioreactor was illuminated at 630nm and 3000lx using LED lamps. The initial glucose concentration was 50mmol/L and no further glucose was added. During the second stage, evaluation of the performance of the entrapped-cell photobioreactor was conducted in continuous flow mode at quasi steady-state. The quasi steady-state operation was defined as a constant H2 production rate and constant substrate consumption rate to be obtained for an operation period of over 24h with the designated parameters. The performance of the photobioreactor with different operation parameters was assessed mainly by hydrogen production rate (HPR), substrate utilization efficiency (η s) and hydrogen bioconversion yield (Y H)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Hydrogen content in the biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography (SC-2000, China) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m stainless steel column packed with porous polymer pellets of TDX. Argon was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 25mL/min and the temperature of the oven and TCD was maintained at 55 and 100°C, respectively. The electric current of the TCD was 70mA. The pH of culture medium was adjusted using a pH meter (Manual pH6, Singapore). The incident light wavelength was determined by a spectrometer (WSB 2000, USA) and the illumination intensity by a digital luxmeter (ST-85, China). The rotation speed of the peristaltic pump was matched to the flow rate of the medium via proper calibration prior to the experiments. The concentration of glucose was determined by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method. The cell concentration of the suspension was determined by optical density at a wavelength of 600nm (i.e., OD600nm) using a spectrophotometer (756MC, China) and the dry cell weight as function of OD600nm of the bacteria suspension was calculated by the formula: Dry cell weight = 0.44 × OD 600 nm + 0.0226 , R 2 = 0.9905 According to the formula, the dry cell weight of PSB entrapped in these granules was calculated by measuring the volume and absorbance at 600nm of the cell suspension added to the gel solution. The hydrogen production rate (HPR), which represents the hydrogen generation capacity of the immobilized-cell bioreactor, is defined as the amount of H2 produced per unit time (h) and per unit volume of bioreactor (L) and can be calculated by HPR = amount of H 2 evolution ( mmol ) H 2 evolution time ( h ) × bioreactor volume ( L ) Substrate utilization efficiency (η s) is defined as the ratio of the glucose concentration difference between effluent and influent to the influent concentration, which shows the efficiency of glucose utilization in the photobioreactor, and is given as η s = C in - C out C in where C in and C out represent the glucose concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the photobioreactor (mmol/L), respectively. The substrate consumption rate (SCR) refers to the amount of glucose consumption per unit time (h) and per unit volume of bioreactor (L), and is shown as SCR = amount of glucose consumed ( mmol ) H 2 evolution time ( h ) × bioreactor volume ( L ) The substrate (glucose) is assumed to be completely decomposed to produce H2 and CO2 according to the following stoichiometric equation (Kokua et al., 2002): C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O = 12 H 2 + 6 CO 2 Based on this, the hydrogen bioconversion yield (Y H) for glucose is determined as the ratio of moles of hydrogen that have actually been produced to moles of hydrogen that would have been produced if all of the substrate has been converted to hydrogen (Uyar et al., 2007). Here, 12mol H2 will be produced when 1mol of glucose is completely consumed by the cells. The hydrogen bioconversion yield shows the capacity of PSB for converting the hydrogen in the substrate to molecular hydrogen and is written as Y H = amount of actual H 2 production ( mmol ) amount of theoretical H 2 production ( mmol ) × 100 % = amount of actual H 2 production ( mmol ) amount of substrate consumption ( mmol ) × 12 × 100 %"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physical characteristics of entrapped-cell matrix,3.1 Physical characteristics of entrapped-cell matrix The desired mechanical stability and transparency of entrapped-cell granule are necessary for continuous H2 production during long-term run. The strength and transparency tests showed that the prepared entrapped-cell granule obtained 107.8N/particle of compressive strength and 98% transparency. The above results indicate that the entrapped-cell matrix prepared in the present study can well meet the requirements of physical intensity and light transport for hydrogen production in the immobilized-cell bioreactor.
9,Effect of incident light on hydrogen production in the immobilized-cell bioreactor,"3.2 Effect of incident light on hydrogen production in the immobilized-cell bioreactor Recent studies show that light wavelength and illumination intensity are two key parameters affecting substrate consumption and hydrogen production by photofermentative bacteria (Uyar et al., 2007). In the present study, experiments on performance of the immobilized-cell photobioreactor under different illumination conditions were carried out to determine the optimal illumination wavelength and intensity for hydrogen production by R. capsulatus CQK 01. First, the effects of incident light wavelengths on H2 photo-production by the entrapped-cell photobioreactor were respectively investigated in two runs with influent substrate concentrations of 40 and 50mmol/L at an illumination intensity of 5000lx, a flow rate of influent medium of 70mL/h, an influent medium temperature of 30°C and a pH of 7. In the two experimental runs, the HPR increased respectively to 1.25, 1.52mmol/L/h when the illumination wavelength was increased to 590nm, and decreased when the illumination wavelength was 630nm (Fig. 2 a). These results demonstrate that at a defined influent substrate concentration, the immobilized-cell photobioreactor achieved the best hydrogen production performance at 590nm; the lowest hydrogen production rate was observed at 470nm. When the effects of illumination intensities on the hydrogen production by the immobilized-cell photobioreactor were respectively investigated at the optimal wavelength of 590nm, an intensity of 2000–8000lx and an influent substrate concentration of 40 and 50mmol/L, it was observed that that at an intensity below 6000lx, the HPR of the entrapped-cell packed bed increased with increasing illumination intensity and at 6000lx the HPR of the bioreactor achieved 2.06 and 2.22mmol/L/h for the two defined concentrations above, respectively (Fig. 2b). From these results, it can be concluded that a wavelength of 590nm and an intensity of 6000lx give optimal hydrogen production and that the absorption and conversion of light energy by PSB should be the most effective at 590nm."
10,Effect of flow rate of the influent medium,"3.3 Effect of flow rate of the influent medium Current research indicates that organic loading rate, resulting from the product of volumetric feeding rate and substrate concentration, is a critical parameter affecting the H2 production rate (Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005; Wu et al., 2007b). The amount of metabolized substrate depends on the influent substrate loading rate, which is proportional to the flow rate of the influent medium for a given substrate concentration. The effects of influent medium flow rates, accompanied with different influent glucose concentrations (30, 40, 50, 60 and 70mmol/L), on hydrogen production and substrate consumption in the immobilized-cell photobioreactor illuminated at 590nm are shown in Fig. 3 , where the illumination intensity was set at 6000lx and the pH and temperature of the influent medium were 7 and 30°C, respectively. At an influent glucose concentration below 50mmol/L, the HPR showed an increasing trend across the entire influent flow rate range (Fig. 3a), while the η s went down slightly (Fig. 3b). For example, at 40mmol/L glucose concentration, the HPR increased from 1.36 to 2.01mmol/L/h when the flow rate increased from 30 to 70mL/h and then rose slightly when the influent flow rate was increased further to 120mL/h, the ηs decreased from 48.8% to 36.0% with increasing the flow rate from 30mL/h to 120mL/h. Fig. 3c indicates that a high influent medium flow rate led to a significantly high SCR at the low glucose concentrations. The results imply that a high volumetric feeding rate should favor effective substrate consumption and hydrogen production at a low influent substrate concentration, due to the absence of inhibitory threats to the survival and metabolizing capacity of the photosynthetic bacteria in the entrapped-cell granules. However, at an influent glucose concentration above 50mmol/L, the η s dropped sharply when the influent flow rate increased from 30 to 120mL/h. While the SCR and the HPR increased initially, the SCR decreased significantly and the HPR decreased only slightly with a further increasing in the flow rate to 120mL/h. These results clearly indicate that the optimal performance of the immobilized-cell photobioreactor did not appear at the highest flow rate of influent medium and thus, sufficient hydraulic retention time was essential for effective substrate utilization and H2 production by the entrapped cells. Specifically, at the influent glucose concentration of 60mmol/L the η s decreased from 85.4% to 79.9% with the flow rate increasing from 30 to 70mL/h and then declined sharply to 46.9% with a further increase in the influent flow rate to 120mL/h. The HPR increased from 1.92 to 2.61mmol /L/h and then tended to go down slightly, the SCR increased from 1.92 to 4.19mmol/L/h and then dropped to 3.68mmol/L/h at the flow rate of 120mL/h. According to the above results, it is possible that the initial increase in influent flow rate resulted in a gradual decline in the external diffusion resistance of glucose transport from the bulk liquid into the granules. Thus, hydrogen production and substrate consumption of the immobilized-cell photobioreactor were improved. The subsequent drop in substrate utilization efficiency can be attributed to the shorter HRT and an increase in the influent substrate loading rate. Furthermore, under high influent glucose concentration conditions, the influent substrate loading rate obviously increased with further increases in the flow rate. As a result, the maximal metabolic rate of PSB cells entrapped in granules became the rate-controlling step of the entire process due to inhibition of hydrogen production and substrate consumption by influent glucose loading. With respect to the hydrogen bioconversion yield of the substrate, it was observed that the values of Y H were inversely related to the volumetric feeding rates, except at a 30mmol/L influent glucose concentration (Fig. 3d). For example, the Y H decreased from the maximum 19.4–10.0% across the entire flow rate range at 40mmol/L influent glucose concentration. This drop was ascribed to the possibility that with an increase in volumetric feeding rate, more substrate available was converted to intermediate products, such as a variety of organic acids, rather than hydrogen and carbon dioxide, even though more substrate could be consumed. Meanwhile, the low Y H at a high influent flow rate implies that the short reaction time for substrate in the photobioreactor was insufficient to effective H2 bioconversion. As a whole, the above results suggest that both influent medium flow rate and substrate concentration were important determinants of feasible operation for hydrogen production in the entrapped-cell photobioreactor. Based on the above experimental results, an optimal substrate medium flow rate of 70mL/h was adopted for hydrogen production by the immobilized-cell photobioreactor."
11,Effect of influent substrate concentration,"3.4 Effect of influent substrate concentration It is well known that influent substrate concentration is one of the important factors affecting the performance of the immobilized-cell bioreactor. To investigate the effects of influent substrate concentration on hydrogen production and substrate consumption, four sets of experiments were conducted with four different illumination intensities of 2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000lx, where the illumination wavelength was fixed at 590nm, the flow rate of the substrate solution was 70mL/h and the temperature and pH of the influent medium were 30°C and 7, respectively. The influent glucose concentrations used in the study were set at 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70mmol/L, respectively. The results are presented in Fig. 4 . It can be clearly observed that at an illumination intensity below 4000lx the HPR, η s and SCR increased significantly with influent glucose concentration increasing from 30 to 70mmol/L (Fig. 4a–c), while the Y H tended to decrease with an increase in the influent substrate concentration (Fig. 4d). For example, at 4000lx illumination intensity the HPR, η s and SCR reached to 1.12mmol/L/h, 74.4%, 4.56mmol/L/h, respectively, with the glucose concentration increasing to 70mmol/L, whereas the Y H dropped slowly to 2.6%. This outcome can be explained by the provision of insufficient light energy at the low illumination intensity. To compensate for the energy deficiency, more ATP was produced by metabolizing more substrate (Basak and Das, 2007). According to the principle of mass transfer, it is also inferred that the driving force for mass transfer of glucose into the entrapped-cell granules was enhanced with an increase in the influent glucose concentration. As a result, the HPR and SCR of the immobilized-cell bioreactor increased gradually but, conversely, the Y H dropped slowly, due mainly to the increase in influent glucose loading in the two cases of the experiments. For illumination intensities at or above 6000lx, the HPR and η s initially increased with increasing influent glucose concentration and then decreased with further increases in the influent glucose concentration, while the Y H showed a tendency to decrease. For instance, at 6000lx, both the HPR and η s increased with the influent glucose concentration increasing from 30 to 60mmol/L, reaching the experimental maxima of 2.61mmol/L/h and 79.9% at 60mmol/L, after which they dropped to 1.91mmol/L/h and 73.7% when the influent glucose concentration was increased to 70mmol/L. As shown in Fig. 4c, the SCR also demonstrated an essentially consistent tendency with the HPR and η s as functions of the influent substrate loading. However, the Y H significantly descended from 15.3% to 4.4% with the influent glucose concentration increasing from 30 to 70mmol/L (Fig. 4d). This reveals that glucose transfer from the bulk liquid into the granules in the bioreactor with sufficient illumination intensity was limited by diffusion at an influent glucose loading below 60mmol/L. With an increase in the influent substrate concentration, PSB cells in the granules absorbing sufficient light energy were provided with sufficient substrate, so that they mainly utilized the photo-heterotrophic pathway producing hydrogen, resulting in increased H2 production and substrate consumption. Here, mass transfer rather than the maximal metabolic activities of PSB cells was the rate-limiting factor in the photobioreactor. However, when the glucose concentration reached 70mmol/L, H2-production and substrate consumption markedly deteriorated. Therefore, the metabolic rate of the entrapped cells must have been surpassed by the flux of mass transfer into the granules under the conditions of sufficient light energy and high influent substrate loading. This resulted in H2 being produced concomitantly with other metabolites (such as acetic acid and ethanol, according to the metabolic pathway), followed by inhibition of H2 production due to accumulation of these metabolites. Several other studies have also found that large amounts of intermediate products produced from a highly concentrated influent inhibited the metabolic activities of bacteria for hydrogen production (Ren et al., 2006; Shi and Yu, 2006; Ruggeri et al., 2009). In addition, it should be noted that the Y H always dropped with increasing influent substrate concentration. This also shows that more intermediate products rather than H2 were being produced with the increase in the influent substrate loading. Therefore, the maximal metabolic rate of the entrapped cells became the rate-limiting step of H2-production in the immobilized-cell photobioreactor under the conditions of high influent glucose concentration and sufficient illumination intensity. Illumination intensity, coupled with influent substrate loading, had a complicated influence on the hydrogen production and substrate consumption by PSB (Fig. 4). At a fixed influent glucose concentration, the HPR and SCR initially increased with increasing illumination intensity and then, dropped with a further increase in illumination intensity. This outcome indicated that significant inhibition of hydrogen production and substrate consumption occurred at high illumination intensity. In particular, at 80001× and 70mmol/L influent glucose concentration, the dual inhibiting effect of light energy and substrate concentration on the metabolism of PSB cells became more intense and led to the entrapped cells engaging in fermentative pathways producing organic acid. As a result, the HPR, SCR and η s dropped rapidly to 0.826mmol/L/h, 1.90mmol/L/h and 31.1%, respectively."
12,Effect of influent medium temperature,"3.5 Effect of influent medium temperature Operation temperature is another critical factor affecting the performance of a photo-fermentation hydrogen production by PSB since the activity of microorganisms is generally inhibited when the environmental temperature is not suitable for their growth. Here, experiments were accomplished at eight different temperatures (15–40°C) to determine the effects of influent medium temperatures on the performance of the entrapped-cells photobioreactor exposed to two illumination wavelengths (520nm and 590nm). The influent glucose concentration was set at 60mmol/L, the illumination intensity was 6000lx and the flow rate and pH of the influent medium were 70mL/h and 7, respectively. Fig. 5 clearly indicates that in both cases, the HPR, η s and Y H showed the same variation with changing temperatures. For example, at 590nm wavelength, the HPR, η s and Y H increased initially from 0.54 to 2.61mmol/L/h, from 42.8% to 79.9% and from 2.0% to 5.2% over the temperature range from 15 to 30°C, respectively. These then dropped significantly to 1.06mmol/L/h, 54.4% and 3.1%, respectively, with the influent medium temperature increasing to 40°C. The activities of the intracellular enzymes of the entrapped cells were initially improved by the increased influent medium temperature and, as a result, the HPR, η s and Y H increased significantly and achieved their maxima at an optimal operating temperature of about 30°C. However, a further increase in the influent medium temperature might have inhibited some essential enzymes and proteins associated with growth or H2 production (such as nitrogenase) and caused a significant drop in HPR, ηs and YH. Therefore, the optimal temperature of the influent medium for hydrogen production in the immobilized-cell photobioreactor was 30°C. Furthermore, based on the fact that the HPR, ηs and YH demonstrated the same tendencies at different temperatures in the two cases, it can be inferred that the effect of influent medium temperature on the metabolic performance of PSB entrapped in granules for H2 photo-production was independent of the illumination wavelength."
13,Effect of influent medium pH,"3.6 Effect of influent medium pH Different influent medium pHs change the ionic form of the active site and enzymes activity, hence affecting bioconversion. The effects of initial pH values of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 on hydrogen production and substrate consumption in immobilized-cell photobioreactor illuminated at 590nm and 520nm were studied under operating conditions of 60mmol/L influent glucose concentration, 70mL/h flow rate, 6000lx illumination intensity and 30°C influent medium temperature. According to the data shown in Fig. 6 , operation at pH7 displayed relatively high HPR, η s and Y H in two runs. Increasing the pH to 9 or decreasing the pH to 4 resulted in severe decreases in HPR, η s and Y H at constant substrate loading and other given operation parameters. This revealed that the strain used in the study had no natural tolerance to acidity or alkalinity, although the activity of R. palustris CQK 01 entrapped in the granules could be detected at the pH extremes of 4 and 9. This behavior can be attributed to the acid or alkaline culture media leading to the inactivation of cellular enzymes and depressing the process of substrate consumption and electron transfer (Fang et al., 2006). As a consequence, Y H decreased due to low intracellular ATP levels and interruption of the metabolic pathway of hydrogen production. Furthermore, at pH4 and 9, the HPR, η s and Y H were considerably lower and varied less at the two different illuminations. This result shows that the activities of intra-particle cells were significantly inhibited and that the synthesized biomass decreased in extreme acid or alkaline environments. According to the principle of hydrogen production (Cheong and Hansen, 2007; Jo et al., 2008) and the above research results, more available electrons in the substrate must have been transported to nitrogenase for production of H2 at pH7 (Öztürk et al., 2006). Furthermore, variations of the hydrogen production and substrate utilization versus pH values in two cases were similar and the optimal pH value of influent medium was 7, which was independent of the illumination wavelength."
14,Novelty and limitations of the proposed entrapped-cells photobioreactor system,"3.7 Novelty and limitations of the proposed entrapped-cells photobioreactor system In the past, similar systems have not been successfully utilized for continuous H2 production by photo-fermentation mainly due to insufficient physical strength, transparency and stability of the gel particles for long-term operation. Therefore, a modified matrix and crosslinking solution was developed in the present study to create a more stable and transparent entrapped-cell granule, suitable for H2 photo-production. The key preparation techniques for entrapped-cell granules were to optimize the ratio of various components of the matrix. Indeed, the resulting immobilized-cell granules displayed a stable performance during the continuous H2 production from glucose for over 3months. In addition, the photobioreactor was able to achieve a maximum HPR of 2.61mmol/L/h and a η s of 79.9%, which were higher than those reported by Chen et al. (2007) and Zabut et al. (2006). The maximum YH of 29.9% (equal to 3.59mmol H2/mmol glucose) was also higher at much lower organic load rates than those reported by Kokua et al. (2002) and Eroğlu et al. (2008). In addition, another major objective in the present study was to determine the effect of operating parameters on performance of H2 photo-production. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that the maximal metabolic rate of PSB cells was one of the key factors that affected the HPR and Y H of PSB in the immobilized-cell bioreactor. Therefore, a genetically modified photosynthetic bacterium strain is in urgent demand to enhance the abilities of hydrogen production and substrate conversion. Furthermore, mass transfer limitation was another important factor restricting the HPR and SCR, which might be overcome by an appropriate adjustment of the pore size in the entrapped-cell granules."
15,Conclusions,"The studies on an immobilized-cell photobioreactor for hydrogen production showed that an increase in the influent substrate concentration and flow rate enhanced glucose transfer rate benefiting to performance improvement, but may inhibit hydrogen production at high organic loading. The PSB cells entrapped in the granules mainly utilized the photo-heterotrophic pathway producing hydrogen at low glucose loading, while they engaged in the fermentative pathways producing organic acid at high glucose concentration and sufficient illumination intensity. The optimal temperature and pH of the influent medium were independent of the light wavelength for hydrogen production by the packed photobioreactor."
