0,Introduction,"The increased consumption of fossil fuels has caused significant energy crisis and environmental pollution, potentially deteriorating the sustainable development of human society [1,2]. Therefore, it is critical to develop clean, massive and sustainable energies to substitute conventional fossil fuels. Hydrogen (H2), as an ideal clean energy, can combust as emission-free gas or convert chemical energy to electricity through fuel cells [3]. Nevertheless, the physical properties of H2 make it difficult in storage and transportation [4]. To this end, small molecular alcohols are promising materials for hydrogen storage, as their liquid physical state increases the energy density and thus facilitates transportation [5–8]. As a common alcohol, ethanol is a renewable biofuel that can be obtained by the fermentation of surplus biomass [9]. Industrially, H2 can be produced at high pressures and high temperatures through ethanol reforming [10], in which many side reactions including ethanol dehydration [11], water gas conversion [12], and carbon deposition [13] occur, resulting the generation of uncontrolled byproducts, such as CH4, CO, and CO2, etc [14,15]. At the same time, this conventional reforming route also waste the carbon resources in ethanol, especially the contained carbon-carbon bond prototype that can be used for synthesis of valuable larger molecules [16,17]. Consequently, the selective dehydrogenation of ethanol to aldehyde at room temperature is an unexceptionable approach due to the mild reaction conditions and zero emission in the whole process [18–21]. Solar energy is an inexhaustible source of natural energy. The conversion of renewable solar energy into sustainable energy of H2 has attracted tremendous interests. Since TiO2 first used as a semiconductor material for photocatalytic hydrogen production through water splitting, diverse photocatalysts have been developed for photocatalytic water splitting in the past few decades [22,23]. Compare to the wide band gap (3.2 eV) of TiO2 [24], the inherent narrow band gap of CdS (2.4 eV) allows its utilization of visible light and results in preferable photocatalytic activity [25–27]. To date, CdS has been extensively studied in various photocatalytic reaction systems, including pollutant degradation [28], organic synthesis [29], water splitting [30], and CO2 reduction [31,32]. However, the high recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and light corrosion severely hampered the photocatalytic activity of pure CdS in practical application [33–36]. To enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS, great efforts have been devoted to CdS modification, including band structure optimization [37,38], cocatalyst utilization [39,40], transition metal loading [41,42], and microstructure adjustment [43,44], etc. Among them, loading transition metals on CdS can trap electrons and promote electron transfer to the catalyst surface, effectively improving its photocatalytic activity [45–47]. Nevertheless, ethanol is often utilized as a sacrificial agent in CdS based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution systems [48]; these alcohol photoreforming processes not only generate CO x as carbon waste and pollution, but also produce H2 from ethanol or water ambiguously in some cases. Accordingly, given that active aldehyde is an important material in fine chemistry industry and H2 can provide clean energy, it is highly desired to split ethanol into H2 and aldehyde directly without CO x formation at room temperature. In this work, we report the fabrication of AgNPs/CdS hybrid photocatalyst for selective ethanol splitting into hydrogen and acetaldehyde at room temperature without producing CO x . To fabricate the fibrous AgNPs/CdS hybrids, CdS nanofibers were initially synthesized by a microwave-assisted method, followed by photodepositing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with the presence of methanol under vacuum. The introduction of AgNPs improves the activity and stability of photocatalysts; at the same time, its surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect can increase electron–holes generation by allowing the photocatalyst to utilize light irradiation over 650 nm [49]. More importantly, a Schottky barrier was constructed at the CdS and AgNPs interface after photodeposition, which accelerates the electron transfer from the conductive band (CB) of CdS to AgNPs, suppressing the electron–hole recombination and thus further boosting the photocatalytic performance of AgNPs/CdS hybrids [50]. To our best knowledge, this is the first photocatalyst example for CO x -free photocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation over 650 nm under room temperature. Different from the conventional steam reforming with high investment and complex process conditions, the approach introduced in this study provides an emission-free and easy-going route toward hydrogen energy development and green organic chemistry advancement."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Sliver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥99.8%), thiocarbamide (CH4N2S, ≥99.8%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥96.0%), ethanediamine (C2H8N2, ≥99.0%), nitric acid (HNO3, 68.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2 · 4H2O, ≥99.0%), acetal (C6H14O2, ≥98.0%), sodium nitroferricyanide (III) dihydrate sodium sulfate (C5FeN6Na2O · H2O, ≥99.0%), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO, ≥99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ethanol (C2H5OH, ≥99%) and methanol (CH3OH, ≥99.5%) were obtained from Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. All reagents were used as received without further purification. High-purity water with the resistivity of 18.25 MΩ cm was used in all experiments."
3,Synthesis of AgNPs/CdS photocatalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of AgNPs/CdS photocatalyst First, CdS nanofibers were prepared via a microwave-assisted route [51]. In a typical preparation, Cd(NO3)2 · 4H2O (3.08 g) and thiocarbamide (2.28 g) were dissolved in ethanediamine (100 mL), which was then heated to 116 °C for 1 h by microwave (500 W). The yellow product after the reaction was collected by centrifugation, and then washed with the mixture of distilled water and ethanol for 3 times to remove unreacted species. The purified CdS sample was dried under vacuum at room temperature. To fabricate AgNPs/CdS hybrids, 0.2 g of as-prepared CdS was dispersed in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing 20% methanol, followed by adding different amount of AgNO3 aqueous solution (0.2 mol L−1). The solution was then put into a Pyrex reactor under vacuum and irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 350 nm) for photodeposition. As shown in Fig. S1, the reaction equipment includes 250 mL reactor, double-layer flume temperature control system, vacuum system, and online analysis system. The AgNPs/CdS hybrids was obtained after 1 h of photodeposition, then separated from the solution through centrifugation and washed with distilled water. The weight ratios of sliver to CdS in different AgNPs/CdS hybrid samples were determined to be 0.29 wt%, 0.58%, 1.09%, 1.38%, and 1.58% by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES), which are corresponding to 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt%, 1.5 wt%, 2.0 wt%, and 2.5 wt% expected silver amounts, respectively."
4,ICP-AES measurement of Ag content,"2.3 ICP-AES measurement of Ag content The AgNPs/CdS hybrid samples (20 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL concentrated HNO3 (68%) in screw capped glass bottles (5 mL). The samples were sonicated for 2 h and kept at room conditions for another 12 h. The resulted solutions were then diluted to 5 mL with distilled water in a 5 mL volumetric flask, and analyzed by a PerkinElmer Optima 7300 DV DRC Emission Spectrometry after removing precipitates through centrifugation (3000 g, 3 min)."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test The photocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation reaction was also carried out in the Pyrex reactor under vacuum at room temperature (Fig. S1). The photocatalyst AgNPs/CdS (20 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL pure ethanol in the reactor under magnetic stirring. A 300 W xenon-lamp (CEL-HXF) with a 400 nm cut-off-filter was used as the light source. Products of the reaction were analyzed by a gas chromatography (CEAULIGHT, GC-7920) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionized detector (FID) with N2 as carrier gas. The control photocatalytic experiment with CdS was also carried out under identical conditions. Note: (I) To maintain the reaction temperature, recycled water (6 °C) was used in the whole reaction process. (II) Given the highest photocatalysis performance is achieved when the weight ratio of sliver to CdS is 1.09 wt%, all following characterizations of AgNPs/CdS hybrids refer to the 1.09 wt% AgNPs/CdS hybrids."
6,Electrochemical characterization,"2.5 Electrochemical characterization A typical three-electrode electrochemical system was used for electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurement (Gamry Interface 1000). AgNPs/CdS hybrids (5 mg) and naphthol (25 µL) was dispersed in ethanol (1.0 mL) under sonication, which was then drop-coated onto an FTO glass (1 cm2 availability working area) as working electrode. A Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) was used as electrolyte. Pt was used as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/KCl (sat.) electrodes was used as reference electrode. The transient photocurrent was measured in the same three-electrode system. Light was supplied by a 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 350 nm). The electrochemical characterizations of pure CdS nanofibers were conducted under the same conditions."
7,Instrumentation,"2.6 Instrumentation The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were conducted on an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, BRUKER-AXS) using Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10°−80°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on a field-emission transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2F30 S-TWIN, FEI). Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) between 500 and 4000 cm−1 were acquired on a Bruker spectrometer (Tensor 27). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an electron spectrometer (ESCALAB250 Xi, Thermo Scientific). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were determined with a UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary-5000, Varian) in the range of 200–800 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were investigated using a spectrofluorometer (F-4500, Hitachi). The time-resolved fluorescence spectra were measured using a time-resolved spectroscopy with an excitation wavelength of 405 nm (FLSP20, Edinburgh Instruments). The specific surface area (S BET) was analyzed using nitrogen adsorption–desorption by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Autosorb IQ3, Quantachrome Instruments). The headspace-gas chromatography (HS-GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with FID detector and Agilent 7697A headspace sampler was employed for product analysis."
8,Measurement of acetaldehyde concentration,"2.7 Measurement of acetaldehyde concentration The concentration of acetaldehyde was analyzed by a spectrophotometric method. First, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.40 mL standard aqueous solutions of acetaldehyde (0.1 g L−1) were diluted to 100 mL with DI water in volumetric flask. Secondly, 0.7 mL sodium nitroferricyanide (III) dihydrate sodium sulfate solution (C5FeN6Na2O · H2O, 1 wt%) and 0.05 mL NaOH solution (2 mol L−1) were separately added into the above acetaldehyde standard solution (10 mL). The standard calibration curve of acetaldehyde was determined by measuring the above solutions at 555 nm with UV–vis spectroscopy 20 min after they were made. The measurement of acetaldehyde concentration in photocatalytic solution was carried out with identical spectrophotometric method. The acetaldehyde concentration of photocatalytic solution can be calculated by interpolating the absorbance intensity in the obtained calibration curve."
9,Results and discussion,"The microstructure and morphology of the as-prepared CdS was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the CdS shows cumulate fibrous conformation with over 100 nm in length and a diameter around 5 nm (Fig. 1(b)). High resolution TEM (HRTEM) image was used to resolve the crystallinity and lattice spacing. The 0.36 nm lattice space measured corresponds to the (100) plane of hexagonal phase CdS (Fig. 1(c)). For the AgNPs/CdS hybrids synthesized by silver photodeposition, a rod-like linear nanostructure was observed (Fig. 1(d) and (e)). The average diameter of AgNPs is 8.45±1.54 nm by measuring 200 individuals (Fig. S2). The lattice space of 0.23 nm emerged in addition to the (002) plane of hexagonal phase CdS can be assigned to the (111) plane of AgNPs (Fig. 1(f)), confirming that AgNPs has been photo-deposited onto CdS nanofibers. Fig. S3 shows the FT-IR spectra of CdS and AgNPs/CdS hybrids. The absorption peak at 1383 cm−1 is regard to the adsorption of NO3 −, while several characteristic absorption peaks in the 1610–990 cm−1 region can be attributed to the adsorbed ethanediamine on the CdS surface [52]. The peaks between 1500–1350 cm−1 ascribed to the CN and NO3 − become weaker when silver was photodeposited onto the CdS, which is likely induced by the complexing action between silver and ethanediamine [53]. XRD patterns were also recorded for the pure CdS and AgNPs/CdS hybrids to analyze the crystal and phase structures. As shown in Fig. S4, seven major peaks at 25.3°, 26.8°, 28.7°, 37.0°, 43.8°, 48.2°, and 51.9° are observed from the XRD spectra of CdS and AgNPs/CdS hybrids, which correspond to the diffractions of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) crystal planes of wurtzite CdS (JCPDS card no. 41-1049), respectively. However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of AgNPs are unfound due to the low content of Ag in the sample. In addition, UV-visible diffuse reflectance (DRS) was used to investigate the optical performance of pure CdS and AgNPs/CdS hybrids. Compare to pure CdS, the AgNPs/CdS hybrids exhibit stronger absorption and longer absorption edge because of the local surface plasmon resonance effect of AgNPs (Fig. 2) [54]; the energy band gap of CdS also negative shifted from 2.48 eV to 2.4 eV (Fig. S5), suggesting an increment in visible light absorption capability from AgNPs/CdS hybrids. In addition, the existence of AgNPs resulted a higher specific surface area (95.2 m2 g− 1) from AgNPs/CdS hybrids than that of pure CdS (55.5 m2 g− 1) (Fig. S6), which can improve the photocatalytic performance of AgNPs/CdS hybrids. To further examine the surface chemistry and element composition of the as-prepared CdS and AgNPs/CdS hybrids, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted. Signals from Cd, S, C, N, and O were shown in the CdS XPS survey spectrum; the presence of carbon and nitrogen can be attributed to the existence of ethanediamine, and the oxygen peak might arise from the gaseous O2 absorbed or the partially oxidized Cd in the reaction process (Fig. S7). Apart from Ag signal, the XPS survey spectrum of AgNPs/CdS hybrids demonstrate similar peaks to CdS. While the high resolution XPS spectrum of Cd3d of pure CdS revealed two typical peaks of Cd3d3/2 and Cd3d5/2 at 404.2 and 410.9 eV (Fig. 3(a)), the XPS peaks of Cd3d3/2 and Cd3d5/2 in AgNPs/CdS hybrids slightly shifted to higher energies (0.5–0.6 eV). Likewise, both the binding energies of S2p1/2 (161.2 eV) and S2p3/2 (162.3 eV) of the AgNPs/CdS hybrids are upshifted ∼0.7 eV compare to those in pure CdS (Fig. 3(b)). These positive binding energy shifts of both Cd3d and S2p can be due to charging under the X-rays, which indicate the formation of a band bending at the interface of CdS and AgNPs [55]. Conversely, different from the standard Ag03d3/2 (386.2 eV) and Ag03d5/2 (374.2 eV) [56], high resolution XPS spectrum of silver reveals an obvious negative shift of Ag3d3/2 (367.6 eV) and Ag3d5/2 (373.6 eV) in the AgNPs/CdS hybrids (Fig. 3(c)). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdS and AgNPs/CdS hybrids were measured to intuitively understand the charge transfer behavior between CdS and AgNPs. As displayed in Fig. 4 (a), compare to pure CdS, the fluorescence intensity of AgNPs/CdS hybrids at 540 nm emission decreased significantly. Meanwhile, time-resolved fluorescence spectra also verified a shorter fluorescence lifetime of AgNPs/CdS hybrids, with bi-exponentially fitted lifetimes of 4.38 ns for pure CdS and 1.60 ns for AgNPs/CdS hybrids, respectively [57]. The weaker fluorescence and shorter fluorescence lifetime of AgNPs/CdS hybrids are observed because the excited electrons from CdS can rapidly transfer to AgNPs and hinder the excited-ground state electron transitions (radiative recombination) [58], potentially leading to enhancement of catalytic performance through AgNPs. To further confirm this charge separation and transfer process, electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) and photocurrent performance were performed (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). Compared to CdS, AgNPs/CdS hybrids demonstrate smaller capactive arc radius in EIS and stronger photocurrent, verifying the rapid charge separation and transportation in AgNPs/CdS hybrids, in accordance with the XPS results (Fig. 3(b)–(d)). The fundamental origination of these enhanced charge separation and transfer can be attributed to the Schottky barrier formed between AgNPs and CdS, as well as the eminent electrical conductivity of silver [59,60]. The photocatalysis of ethanol dehydrogenation was carried out with CdS nanofiber and fibrous AgNPs/CdS hybrids as photocatalysts under visible light (λ > 400 nm) at room temperature. While pure CdS can generate H2 at a rate of 42.3 µmol h− 1 g− 1, the AgNPs/CdS hybrids with small amount of silver (0.29–1.6 wt%) show remarkable enhancement for H2 production, suggesting a vital role of silver on the photocatalyitc performance. The H2 evolution rate reached the highest (1720.9 µmol h− 1 g− 1) at the optimal composite of 1.09 wt% silver, which is over 40 times higher than that of pure CdS (Fig. 5 (a)). When the silver content was further increased, the H2 evolution rate will obviously decline, which might due to the light shield effect of silver and increased recombination centers on CdS surface [61]. A linear increase of H2 production amount was observed from both CdS and AgNPs/CdS hybrids under 6 h light irradiation (Fig. 5(b)). In addition, no H2 evolution rate decrease was found in 1.09 wt% AgNPs/CdS hybrid photocatalyst after 3 consecutive runs for a total of 18 h (Fig. 5(c)), sugeesting a favorable stability of AgNPs/CdS photocatalyst. The photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol with 1.09 wt% AgNPs/CdS hybrids under different monochromatic light irradiations was also investigated. While the H2 evolution rate decreases with the red shift of irradiation wavelength from 400 to 650 nm (±10 nm) (Fig. 5(d)); encouragingly, H2 can still be produced with 1.09 wt% AgNPs/CdS hybrids as photocatalyst under 650 nm irradiation (Fig. 5(d)), indicating the AgNPs/CdS hybrids can utilize low energy light more efficiently and boosts its photocatalytic activity. The wavelengths and corresponding photo flux are presented in Table S1. On the contrary, no H2 production can be detected with pure CdS as photocatalyst at 500 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of pure ethanol photocatalytic dehydrogenation under irradiation wavelength over 600 nm. The amount of acetaldehyde generated from ethanol is about 0.4 µmol after 6 h visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) (Fig. S8), which is significantly lower than the evolved hydrogen (∼206 µmol) in the same time, owing to the photocatalytic reaction was conducted under vacuum and acetaldehyde (b.p. 20.8 °C) can be easily volatilized out of the solution. To verify whether CO x was produced in the photocatalytic ethanol splitting process, a control on-line experiment was carried out with flame ionization detector (FID) system. Neither CO nor CO2 was found in the GC-FID spectrum (Fig. S9) after 3 h photocatalysis reaction. In addition, HS-GC-FID was employed to analyze photocatalytic reaction solution, which also shows there are no other products evolved (Fig. S10), further indicating ethanol has been selectively split into hydrogen and acetaldehyde. On the basis of the above results, a feasible mechanism (Fig. 6 ) is suggested for the photocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation over AgNPs/CdS hybrids inspired by the previous work [62]. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons (e−) are activated from valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) of the CdS nanofibers and leave holes (h+) on VB. The photogenerated holes then migrate to the liquid-solid interface (AgNPs/CdS and ethanol) to activate ethanol and form ethoxy species (•CH2CH2OH) and proton (H+) [63]. Afterwards, the generated •CH2CH2OH interacts with Ag to give metastable Ag–CH2CH2OH, which inclines to dissociate to acetaldehyde and Ag–H [62,64]. In addition, as mentioned above, the generated electrons can easily transfer to the AgNPs through Schottky barrier, which further react with the Ag–H and foregoing proton (H+) to produce H2 [65,66]. More importantly, the AgNPs in the hybrids not only broaden the use of visible light with absorption enhancement, but also lead to the “hot spots” via SPR, promoting photocatalytic ethanol splitting to H2 and acetaldehyde [67,68]."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, an efficient hydrogen generation from pure ethanol under visible light has been demonstrated with AgNPs/CdS hybrid photocatalyst. These AgNPs/CdS hybrids possess broad light absorption, plentiful electron generation capacity induced by SPR, and eminent electron transfer feature offered via Schottky barrier. These encouraging functions allow AgNPs/CdS hybrids to achieve an over 40 times enhancement of photocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation than that of pure CdS. Quite excitingly, different from conventional ethanol reforming, the reaction carried out at room temperature can avoid overoxidation of ethanol to CO x and yields valuable acetaldehyde for applications in fine chemistry. Consequently, this emission-free atom-economical photocatalytic reaction meets green chemistry and may offer new insights to the exploration of continuable energies and resources."
