0,Introduction,"WO3 is a low band gap semiconductor (Eg = 2.6 eV), which is widely used in photoelectrochemical cells [1,2], electrochromic devices [3,4], gas sensing [5–8], energy storage [9–11] and so forth. Regarding its potential as photocatalyst, photo-activity is reduced due to the high recombination rate of the hole-electron pairs (10 μs at 475 nm) [12], as well as to the small size of the crystallite, resulting in a limited performance for photo-reactions [13]. Due to the high oxidation potential of its valence band, WO3 has been used for the photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation, displaying promising results [13,14]. Conversely, very low performance has been observed when WO3 is used for the photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen, given the low reduction potential of its conduction band, which hampers the reduction of H2O into H2 [14]. Band gap engineering by substitutional doping of W with high loadings (12 wt.%) of Hf has demonstrated to efficiently upshift the reduction potential of the conduction band in monoclinic WO3, achieving the conversion of H+ into H2 [15]. Likewise, surface modification of WO3 with Au metallic nanoparticles offers an efficient approach for decreasing the recombination rate of the hole-electron pairs [16] while increasing the reduction potential of the photo-electrons, achieving the reduction of H2O into H2 [17]. Higher transference rate of photo-electrons is achieved as Au metallic nanoparticles are smaller and better dispersed on the semiconductor surface [18]. Decoration of WO3 with tiny and well dispersed Au metallic nanoparticles has been successfully achieved by impregnation [19,20], sputtering [8,21,22], photodeposition [23,24], sonochemical deposition [25], solvothermal route [5] and colloidal deposition [26], while efforts for using deposition-precipitation (DP) have resulted in negligible deposition of the Au precursor. This is attributed to the negatively charged surface of the semiconductor throughout the pH scale. Given the low isoelectric point (IEP) of WO3 (∼0.5), deposition of the AuCl4 − precursor is unlikely to occur, making necessary the use of positively charged Au precursors in order to achieve the complete deposition. Cationic adsorption is a chemical deposition method based on the preparation of positively charged Au precursors by the formation of dative-bonds based bifunctional organometallic complexes with ethylenediamine [27,28]. The [Au(en)2]3+ (en = ethylenediamine) complex is synthesized from HAuCl4 −. The cationic complex is then deposited on negatively charged surfaces by electrostatic interactions, then metallic nanoparticles are formed upon thermal treatment. In this last step, most of the organic complex and Cl− ions are oxidized and volatilized, depending on the temperature and the atmosphere used in the annealing step [29]. In order to obtain tiny and well dispersed nanoparticles as well as to avoid interferences both in the formation of metallic Au nanoparticles and in the catalytic performance of the surface modified materials -by the occurrence of Cl− ions-, a careful control of the pH value during the synthesis and a proper thermal treatment are necessary. Cationic adsorption method has been successfully used for deposition of Au on negatively charged materials, such as SiO2 [29–34] and PMMA [35], boosting the catalytic activity of the modified materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the deposition of Au on WO3 by the cationic adsorption method. The aim of this work was to optimize a synthetic method based on cationic adsorption to deposit Au on WO3 nanoparticles, obtaining functional Au/WO3 materials for the photocatalytic reduction of the water molecule."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of the WO3 support,"2.1 Synthesis of the WO3 support WO3 was prepared as described by Sánchez-Martínez et al. [36]. In a typical synthesis step, 5.478 g of ammonium paratungstate hydrate (H42N10O42W12∙H2O) were dissolved in 50 mL of 30% v/v HNO3 at 70 °C. Then, 0.516 g of citric acid (C6H8O7) were added to the solution under vigorous stirring. The solution was stirred for 30 min, while the formation of a yellowish suspension occurred. The solid was separated by centrifugation and washed several times with 100 mL of distilled water per gram of material. After the washing step, the solid was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 2 h. Lastly, the solid was annealed at 700 °C in a furnace for 3 h, using a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1."
3,Synthesis of the [Au(en)2]Cl3 complex,"2.2 Synthesis of the [Au(en)2]Cl3 complex The [Au(en)2]Cl3 complex was synthesized following the procedure proposed by Block and Bailar [37]. In brief, 1 mL of ethylenediamine was mixed with 5 mL of diethyl ether. The solution was added to a second solution containing 10 mL of diethyl ether and 1 g of HAuCl4∙3H2O (violent reaction); a gummy yellowish precipitate was formed. The solid was dissolved in 1 mL of water and consecutively re-precipitated with 10 mL of ethyl alcohol. The process was repeated three times until a white solid was obtained."
4,Synthesis of Au/WO3 by cationic adsorption,"2.3 Synthesis of Au/WO3 by cationic adsorption The preparation of the Au/WO3 material was accomplished via the cationic adsorption of the positively charged Au-ethylenediamine complex on the negatively charged WO3 surface. For this, 1 g of the support was dispersed in 100 mL of a preheated (45 °C) aqueous solution containing the [Au(en)2]Cl3 complex. The initial pH of the suspension was 4. The mass added of the Au-ethylenediamine complex was set to achieve nominal Au loadings of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 wt.%. Calculations were done considering that 46% of the complex mass corresponded to Au, according to analysis by ICP-OES. The suspension was thoroughly stirred to promote the adsorption of the positively charged [Au(en)2]Cl3 complex on the negatively charged WO3 particles. The optimization of the cationic adsorption procedure was carried out by modifying either the pH of the suspension or the reaction time. For the former, four pH values were tested, namely 1, 4 (natural pH), 7 and 10; which were achieved by adding dropwise either 1 M ethylenediamine or 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. The reaction time was varied by testing 2, 12, and 16 h. All the reactions were performed under dark conditions and 45 °C in order to avoid the reduction of gold and the decomposition of the [Au(en)2]3+ complex, respectively [29]. Upon the Au adsorption, the solid was separated by centrifugation at 10,500 rpm for 8 min. Then, the sample was washed with 100 mL of distilled water at 40 °C, in order to remove the Cl− ions and other residues. The washing step was repeated four times; then, the solid was dried for 12 h at room temperature under vacuum conditions. To degrade the organic complex and to nucleate the gold nanoparticles, a thermal treatment from room temperature to 350 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, followed by a 3-h isothermal step at 350 °C was performed. Air stream was used for activation of Au nanoparticles at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 per milligram of material. After this step, electrostatic interactions of the Au complex were transformed to solid-solid interactions of the metallic nanoparticles with the WO3 support. All the samples were stored at room temperature under dark and vacuum conditions in order to prevent further growth of the Au nanoparticles."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The determination of the crystalline phase of the WO3 support was carried out by X-ray diffraction analysis, using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with a Cu-Kα radiation source; a window of 20–70° was selected with a step size of 0.02° and a scan rate of 0.2° min−1. The crystallite size was determined using the Scherrer equation (Eq. (1)). (1) β = k ∙ λ τ ∙ c o s θ Where β is the mean crystallite size, k is a proportionality constant (0.94), λ is the X-ray wavelength, θ corresponds to the Bragg angle, and τ is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM). Raman analysis was performed using a confocal microscope Alpha 300AR (WITec), with a laser excitation source of Nd:YAG at a wavelength of 532 nm. The size and morphology of the WO3 particles were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a JEOL microscope model 5600LV, with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The samples were mounted on a double-sided adhesive carbon tape on a SEM stub. The specific surface area of the materials was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement, which was performed using a BELSORP-mini II instrument. Determination of the IEP of WO3 was carried out via dynamic light scattering, using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 Malvern equipment. These measurements were accomplished by suspending WO3 particles in a 0.03 M KNO3 solution at different pH values. The efficiency of Au deposition on WO3 was elucidated by chemical analysis using inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 8300 equipment. Prior to analysis, samples were treated using microwave-assisted digestion in HCl at 175 °C. The size distribution of the Au nanoparticles supported on WO3 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), using a JEOL JEM 2010F microscope, equipped with a Z-contrast annular detector. Size distribution was determined by the examination of at least 500 nanoparticles. The average particle diameter ( d ¯ ) was calculated using the Eq. (2). (2) d ¯ = ∑ n i d i N Where ni corresponds to the number of particles with a diameter di , and N is the number of particles used for the measurement. The standard deviation ( σ ) was determined by the Eq. (3) (3) σ = ∑ d i - d ¯ 2 N 1 2 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to assess the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) displayed by the Au nanoparticles supported on WO3. Determinations were performed using an Agilent UV–vis-NIR Cary 5000 apparatus, in a window of 200–800 nm, a step size of 1 nm, and a scan rate of 600 nm min−1 were used."
6,Electrochemical characterization,"2.5 Electrochemical characterization Thin films of the WO3 and Au/WO3 materials were fabricated as follows: a nafion-ethanol mixture was put in contact with the appropriate amount of the sample and thoroughly stirred. Then, an aliquot of the suspension was dropped on 0.14 cm2 ITO substrates, previously cleaned with acetone and water. All the films were dried at room temperature for 0.5 h. Electrochemical measurements were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell. An Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl electrode was used as the reference electrode [EAg/AgCl/3M KCl = 0.210 V/SHE]. The counter electrode was a graphite rod (99.9995% pure, Alfa Aesar) and the prepared films on ITO were used as the working electrode. A 0.03 M KClO4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte; which was mixed with methanol in a 80:20 water:methanol proportion. The illumination tests were performed in a Newport Q Housing (Model 60025), equipped with a 100 W Hg arc lamp. The semiconducting properties of the materials were estimated from the Mott–Schottky plots. The space charge capacitance of the film was potentiodynamically measured in the dark (v = 20 mV s−1) at a frequency of 400 Hz. For the (photo)electrochemical measurements an Autolab PGSTAT 302N potentiostat was used."
7,Photocatalytic activity tests,"2.6 Photocatalytic activity tests The functionality of the synthesized materials was assessed via the photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen via the reduction of the water molecule. The reactions were carried out in a borosilicate cylindrical photo-reactor with a quartz tube located along the z axis. For each experiment, 200 mL of a 80:20 water:methanol solution were put in contact with 100 mg of the tested photocatalyst. The suspension was sonicated for 5 min and stirred in the dark for 30 min to disperse the solid; then, the dissolved air was displaced by bubbling nitrogen. After stirring, the light source was turned on. Light came from an UVP mercury lamp with primary emission at 254 nm (5.1 mW cm−2), which was located inside a quartz tube at the center of the photo-reactor. A gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) was used to assess the H2 evolution throughout the 7 h of the photoreaction. The GC device was equipped with an Agilent CP7429 column and a thermal conductivity detector. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the hydrogen production of each material was measured using an UVX radiometer (Eq. (4)) [38].

8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the WO3 support,"3.1 Characterization of the WO3 support The prevalence of the monoclinic phase of WO3 was evidenced by the occurrence of the diffraction patterns at 2θ = 23.12, 23.59, 24.38, 33.10 and 34.16 (Fig. 1 ) which correspond to the planes (002), (020), (200), (022) and (202), respectively, in accordance with the JCPDS 05-0386 card. Raman shifts at 715 and 804 cm−1 (Fig. 2 ) were assigned to the OWO stretching modes, while signals at 266 and 326 cm−1 were attributed to the bending modes of monoclinic WO3 [39]. The monoclinic phase is the metastable form of WO3, which is achieved above 500 °C, with its highest crystallization at 700 °C [40,41]. The size of the WO3 crystallite was calculated by the Scherrer equation as 23.2 nm, and very low specific surface area (4.25 m2/g) was determined via BET analysis, which is consistent with that previously found in studies reporting the synthesis of monoclinic WO3 using the precipitation method [36,42]. It is well known that condensation of the H2WO4 precursor by organic ligands leads to the precipitation of tiny nanoparticles of ∼20 nm [43]. Scanning electron microscopy images showed ellipsoid crystals with high agglomeration of small WO3 crystals (Fig. 3 ). Such agglomeration may be caused by sinterization at 700 °C, resulting in the fading of the grain boundaries [40,44]. The isoelectric point (IEP) of the synthesized WO3 was determined as 0.7 (Fig. 4 ), which falls within the range commonly reported in literature [31,45]. IEP of metal oxides can vary depending on the chemical species occuring on the surface, the crystalline phase, the hydration of the crystal, the agglomeration of the particles as well as the Lewis and Bronsted sites on the crystal surface. In the case of WO3, the monoclinic phase is known to have a lower value of IEP than other polymorphs, due to the abundance of Lewis acid sites [43]. Given the prevalence of negative charges on the WO3 surface in a broad range of the pH scale, the deposition-precipitation method may result in low deposition of Au when anionic precursors are used."
10,Deposition of Au on WO3 by the cationic adsorption method,"3.2 Deposition of Au on WO3 by the cationic adsorption method As an attempt to synthesize Au/WO3 via the deposition-precipitation method, HAuCl4 was used as precursor, resulting in negligible deposition of gold on the semiconductor surface; i.e., 0.001 wt.% out of the nominal loading of 3 wt.%. The addition of HAuCl4 along with WO3 lowered the pH of the suspension to ∼1.8. Under such conditions, the superficial charge of the WO3 remained negative, hampering the deposition of the Au(OH)xCl4-x − anions. According to Zanella et al. [46], some AuCl4 − can be deposited on the negatively charged surface of nanosized semiconductors by impregnation, as they observed for TiO2 at pH = 10. However, given the low specific surface area and high agglomeration of the WO3 particles, impregnation is quite unlikely to occur. When cationic adsorption was tested, the deposition of the [Au(en)2]3+ complex on the WO3 nanoparticles increased as pH increased (Fig. 5 ). The complete adsorption of 3 wt.% of Au was achieved at pH = 10. This is consistent with that reported [29,33] when SiO2 (IEP ∼ 2.0) and even TiO2 [46] (IEP ∼ 6.2) were used as support in previous works. Cationic adsorption was negligible under acid (pH = 1 and 4) conditions, even when the surface of WO3 particles was already negatively charged based on the IEP value (see Fig. 4). At pH values above the isoelectric point, electrostatic interactions between the Au-ethylenediamine complex and the negatively charged WO3 surface may occur as follows. (5) [Au(en)2]3+ + Cl− + 2−(O-O2W) → [Au(en)2Cl]2+−(O-W2O)2 Gold is able to form tetracovalent bonds with ethylenediamine in the [Au(en)2]3+ complex. This metal may work with the coordination numbers 5 and, in some cases, 6 [47]. It is known that under neutral conditions and high Cl− concentrations, the planar structure of the [Au(en)2]3+ complex can be distorted by the insertion of Cl− ions within the coordination sphere, resulting in a pseudo octahedral structure [33,47]. According to Eq. (5), one molecule of the [Au(en)2Cl]2+ complex can neutralize two negative charges on the surface of WO3 particles, assuming that all of the WOH terminal sites are deprotonated (WO−). As the pH increased in the cationic adsorption process, the deprotonation of the bis-ethylenediamine complex was achieved, as shown in Eq. (6). (6) [Au(en)2]3+ → [Au(en)(depen)]2+ + Cl− → [Au(en)(depen)Cl]+ Where depen is the deprotonated form of ethylenediamine. Based on the pKa values of the NH moieties of ethylenediamine (7.84 and 10.57) [48], the deprotonation of the complex is expected to happen at pH values higher than 8. The positive charge of Au (III) increases the acidity of ethylenediamine, boosting the deprotonation of the NH group [33]. The deprotonation of the ethylenediamine moiety neutralizes one positive charge of the Au(III) atom, then Cl− is integrated within the coordination sphere, which gives a net charge of +1. Under such conditions, the cationic adsorption of the Au-ethylenediamine complex on the WO3 surface occurs in a 1:1 ratio, as shown in Eq. (7). This means a higher number of Au deposited on the WO3 surface. (7) [Au(en)(depen)Cl]+ + −O-O2W → [Au(en)(depen)Cl]+−O-WO2 Lastly, at pH = 10, the excess of OH− in the solution results in the substitution of Cl− within the coordination sphere [33]; then, cationic adsorption takes place as previously explained (Eq. (8)). (8) [Au(en)(depen)Cl]+ + OH− → [Au(en)(depen)OH]+ + −O-WO2 → [Au(en)(depen)OH]+−O-WO2 A decrease in the net charge of the Au complex under basic conditions may explain the differences observed in the adsorption rate of the Au complex within the range of pH tested, as basic conditions were achieved, adsorption of the cationic complex on the negatively charged WO3 surface occurs in a 1:1 ratio. Given that pure ethylenediamine was used as basifying agent, its protonated form prevailed when the pH of the suspension was below the pKa value, making possible the cationic adsorption of the organic molecule. Conversely, the adsorption of ethylenediamine on the WO3 nanoparticles decreased as basic conditions were achieved due the appearance of the neutral form of the organic molecule. In any case, most of the adsorbed organic molecules were eliminated by calcination through thermal treatment at 350 °C [29]. In terms of the reaction time, 2, 12 and 16 h were tested. Such conditions were selected on the basis of that previously reported [29,33,34] for the cationic adsorption of the [Au(en)2]3+ complex on SiO2. It can be observed in Fig. 5 that 83% of the Au adsorption was achieved within the first 2 h when the pH of the suspension was 10; then, 100% was deposited upon 16 h of stirring (Fig. 5). Using SiO2 as supporting material, which displays a larger surface area than WO3, Zanella et al. [46] reported 78% of [Au(en)2]3+ adsorption after 2 h, under basic conditions and Au loadings as high as 7%, while Zhu et al. [33] found the complete adsorption of the Au complex on mesoporous silica, obtaining 9 wt.% Au/SiO2 in 2 h. Koruda et al. [35] observed the complete adsorption of 0.5 wt.% [Au(en)2]3+ in only 30 min using PMMA as support. Considering the low specific surface area of the WO3 material, it is clear, from the aforementioned, that surface area and porosity played a main role on the reaction time required to achieve the complete adsorption of the Au complex when optimal pH conditions are used. When the pH value of the reaction was 7, less than 30% of the Au adsorption was achieved upon 2 h of stirring. Au loading went from 0.8 to 2.1 wt.% when the reaction time changed from 2 to 12 h. No changes in the deposition rate were observed when the reaction time increased to 16 h. On the other hand, under acid conditions, the highest adsorption rate of the [Au(en)2]3+ complex (0.32 wt.% at pH = 4) was achieved upon 12 h of stirring. Considering that under neutral and acid conditions the adsorption of the Au complex on WO3 occurred at a 1:2 ratio (see Eq. (5)), equilibrium conditions could be slowly achieved, probably presenting some steric hindrance; and thus, longer reaction time might be necessary to achieve the complete adsorption. Using the optimal adsorption conditions (i.e. pH = 10 and 16 h), different loadings of Au were successfully deposited on the WO3 support, as shown in Table 1 . In general terms, 100% of Au deposition was achieved for loadings as low as 0.1 and 0.5 wt.%, while a slight decrease of the adsorption efficiency was observed when Au loading increased to 1 wt.%. This result was not attributed to saturation of adsorption sites on the WO3 surface, since complete deposition of the Au complex was achieved when higher loadings (3 wt.%) were tested. It is worth mentioning that using the cationic adsorption method with supports displaying high IEP values, such as oxides of the alkaline earth metals, may result in negligible deposition rates due to the cationic exclusion effect of the [Au(en)2]3+ complex with the positively charged support surface. In such case, a considerable increase of the pH is necessary, in order to negatively charge the surface and thus adsorb the organometallic complex. Zanella et al. [27] observed this behavior for TiO2, which presents higher IEP value than WO3, achieving the maximum Au loading (1 wt.%) under basic conditions. Moreover, when low calcination temperatures are used, a residual amount of carbon may remain on the material due to the incomplete decomposition of the ethylenediamine precursor, which may represent a drawback in the usage of this method for certain applications, for instance the photocatalytic degradation of some organic pollutants in water."
11,Formation of functional Au nanoparticles on WO3,"3.3 Formation of functional Au nanoparticles on WO3 Upon deposition, thermal treatment at 350 °C was performed in order to completely remove the bis-ethylenediamine moiety in the Au complex, since decomposition of organic ligands occurs from 150 to 400 °C [34]. According to previous studies in our research group, tiny and well dispersed Au metallic nanoparticles are formed using annealing temperatures below 500 °C [49]. Electrostatic interactions between the positively charged Au complex and the negatively charged WO3 surface disappeared upon the calcination of the Au complex, and solid-solid interactions were established between Au nanoparticles and the WO3 support. Given the instability of the Au(III) species, reduction to Au° can be achieved at 120 °C either under H2-reductive or air atmosphere [50]. Even though the size of metallic nanoparticles vary when oxidative or reducing conditions are used in thermal treatment [51], only air flow was used in this work, in order to prevent the reduction of WO3 [52,53] into monoclinic WO2.9 via the partial loss of oxygen atoms (Eq. (9)) [54]. (9) WO3 + 0.1H2 → WO2.9 + 0.1H2O Indeed, thermal treatment using air prevented the reduction of the support, as shown in Fig. 1b, and highly dispersed nanoparticles with average size of 4.1 nm were observed on the surface of the WO3 support by TEM characterization (Fig. 6 ). Diffraction patterns corresponding to Au0 were not observed, more likely because of the low size and high dispersion of the metallic nanoparticles. Low contrast between Au and WO3 was observed in HAADF images because of the proximity of atomic mass of W and Au. Metallic nanoparticles produced in this work were smaller than those obtained using other deposition methods (see Table 2 ). This result may be explained by the homogeneous adsorption of the Au-ethylenediamine complex on the negatively charged WO3 surface. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the Au metallic nanoparticles was observed in the modified materials, with an absorption band centered at 555 nm (Fig. 7 ), confirming the size of nanoparticles within the range of 2–20 nm [55]. SPR signal for gold is usually reported between 530 and 550 nm [56,57], which is in accordance with the results obtained in this work. Xiang et al. [16] observed the occurrence of the plasmonic band centered at 582 nm, when Au nanoparticles (average diameter of 10 nm) were supported on WO3 nanorods. Differences in our results compared with those reported by Xiang et al. may be attributed to the difference in the average size of the metallic nanoparticles."
12,Photocatalytic activity,"3.4 Photocatalytic activity The photoactivity of the Au modified materials was evaluated via the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. UV-C light was used in photocatalytic tests in order to a) testing the photo-stability of the WO3 support (i. e. its reduction into WO2.9) under illumination with high energy irradiation, and b) to discriminate the contribution of the plasmon resonance displayed by Au nanoparticles in the photocatalytic performance of the Au/WO3 materials. As shown in Fig. 8 , the superficial modification of WO3 with Au nanoparticles increased the evolution of hydrogen, compared with that observed for the unmodified WO3. These results are consistent and even higher than those reported for other systems, namely Au/TiO2, Au/MoS2 and Au/CdS [49,58–60]. The positive role of Au nanoparticles could be related to the increase of the charge carrier lifetime, since Au nanoparticles act as an electron trap triggered by the higher work function of the metal [61]. Additionally, the high electronegativity of Au allows metallic nanoparticles to produce active sites for the reduction of water molecules [62]. The 0.5 wt.% Au/WO3 material displayed the highest photocatalytic H2 production rate (472.71 μmol g−1 h−1), while lower efficiency was observed as the Au loading increased. This behavior could be associated with the agglomeration of the metallic nanoparticles on the WO3 surface, which may consume the photo-holes, acting as recombination centers [63]. It is noteworthy that both Au loaded and unmodified tungsten oxide materials displayed higher H2 production rate than that obtained when Degussa P25 was tested (Fig. 8). One additional experiment was performed using the Au/WO3 material obtained by deposition-precipitation method, which showed a H2 production rate quite similar to that obtained by using the unmodified semiconductor because as expected, the gold loading was much lower than the theoretical one. It was possible to elucidate an apparent reaction rate constant based on experimental results shown in Fig. 8, with a linear behavior as a function of time, which indicates a zero order apparent reaction rate (Table 3 ). Similar results have been previously reported by others research groups working with Au/TiO2 [64,65] and Pt/TiO2 [66] for the photocatalytic production of H2. When comparing the photocatalytic activity of the 0.5 wt.% Au/WO3 material upon four consecutive reaction cycles (Fig. 9 ), negligible reduction of hydrogen production was observed, indicating that this material can be reused. ICP-OES analysis of the reused material showed negligible loss of Au after the photocatalytic process (Au content of 0.52 wt.% in the reused material), demonstrating the stability of the material. Apparent quantum yield (AQY) increased as the amount of Au deposited on WO3 increased (Table 3), with a maximum at the loading of 0.5 wt% of Au; then, an AQY decrease was observed. Such results are in accordance with those of the photocatalytic activity mentioned above, and prove that when Au loading surpasses the optimum, photo-activity decreases [67]."
13,Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical test,"3.5 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical test In order to explain the increase in the photocatalytic production of H2 observed for the surface modified materials, the semiconducting properties were determined by potentiodynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions. In these assays a 80:20 water:methanol mixture was used in order to simulate the experimental conditions in the photocatalytic tests, while 0.03 M KClO4 was used as supporting electrolyte. It is important to point out that the occurrence of KClO4 does not modify the semiconducting properties of the synthesized materials. The Mott–Schottky curves (Fig. 10 ) showed a positive slope when the C−2 sc values varied linearly with the potential, which is consistent with n-type semiconductors. The flatband potential (Efb) of the materials was estimated from the Mott–Schottky curves, by extrapolating the linear region of the C−2 sc vs the potential axis. The donor density (Nd) was determined using the slopes of the Mott–Schottky curves (Fig. 10) through Eq. (10). (10) N d = 2 N A d C - 2 d v F ε ε 0 where Nd (cm−3) is the donor density, NA is the Avogadro’s number (6.023 × 1023 mol−1), F is the Faraday constant (∼9.65 × 104 C mol−1), ε is the dielectric constant of WO3 ( ε = 300), ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.8542 × 10−14 F cm−1) and [d(C−2 sc)/dv] is the slope of the Mott–Schottky curve obtained for each material. The value of the Efb obtained for the unmodified WO3 was −0.71 V (vs Ag/AgCl electrode), which is more negative than that reported in other works at neutral pH [68,69]. Given that in this experiment Efb was measured in a 80:20 water:methanol solution, this value is more representative of the photocatalytic system than that reported in literature for pure water systems. The Efb value of the unmodified WO3 was higher than that required for the reduction of the water molecule (–0.62 V vs Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl)), indicating that, under the experimental conditions, the semiconductor meets the minimal thermodynamic requirements to perform the hydrogen evolution process. When Au nanoparticles were supported on WO3, the Efb shifted toward more negative values (Table 4 ), along with the increase of the Nd values, which indicates the generation of energy states in the Au-WO3 interface. This behavior has been observed in other structures [70–76], and is commonly related with a high accumulation of electrons in the interface of the composite. It is important to point out that more negative potential to reduce water into hydrogen was achieved as Au loading increased up to 0.5 wt.%, which is the optimal Au loading found in the photocatalytic tests. Under this optimal condition, the improved separation of the photo-generated charge carriers and thus higher H2 generation rate was achieved. Conversely, for the 1 wt.% Au/WO3 material, the Efb was slightly displaced toward less negative values, which may be related, on the one hand, to the alignment of the Fermi level between WO3 and the gold nanoparticles; and on the other hand, to the formation of Au aggregates, which may act as recombination centers, reducing the Nd value [70,71]. According to Kong et al. [77], the displacement of the flat band potential (Efb) toward more negative values can be associated to strong interactions between Au nanoparticles and oxygen atoms on the WO3 surface. In this work, interactions became stronger as the optimum Au loading was achieved, at 0.5 wt.% (see Fig. 10). In order to evaluate a) the effect of the energy states formed at the Au-WO3 interface, and b) the stability of the photo-generated charge carriers and its impact on the photocatalytic activity, open circuit potential (OCP) measurements under UV-C light irradiation were performed for all the Au/WO3 materials through 3 consecutive on-off cycles under deaerated conditions. When the materials were illuminated, the OCP started to change towards more negative values (typical of n-type semiconductors) [78,79], indicating the accumulation of electrons either in the conduction band or in the energy states below it; such energy states may be located in the Au-WO3 interface (Fig. 11 a). When UV-light was off, the OCP of the unmodified WO3 material slightly changed towards less negative values, but reached the same value when illumination returned. This behavior proves the stability of the electron accumulation process for the unmodified semiconductor. The OCP of Au/WO3 materials under illumination reached less negative values as the amount of Au increased (Fig. 11a (ii, iii)), displaying the minimum value when the 0.5 wt.% Au/WO3 material was tested. This effect proves that the photo-generated electrons by the WO3 support are transferred to lower energy levels, which might be either the conduction band of Au or the energy states generated at the Au-WO3 interface. When illumination was definitely turned off (Fig. 11b), the photo-generated electrons returned to the valence band, recombining with holes. The kinetics of this process depends on the place where the photo-generated electrons are located: either free in the conduction band of WO3, or trapped in energy states at the Au-WO3 interface [79]. Regarding the Au/WO3 materials, the recovery time observed for the Au loading of 0.5 wt.% (Fig. 11b iii) resulted slower than the ones observed for the 0.25 and 1 wt%. Au/WO3 materials (Fig. 11b ii and iv), indicating that electrons are trapped in the interfacial energy states in the 0.5 wt.% Au/WO3 material. Such energy states favor the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and accelerate their transfer to the solution, via the Au nanoparticles. These photo-electrons ultimately are able to reduce the adsorbed water molecules. Conversely, the recovery time in the dark resulted quite slower for the unmodified WO3 material than the ones observed for any of the modified materials (Fig. 11b i). Even when the recombination rate of the hole-electron pairs was the slowest for the unmodified semiconductor, H2 production using this material was markedly lower than that observed for the Au modified ones. This result suggests that Au nanoparticles were not only playing an important role in the separation of photo-generated charge carriers, like an electron trap, but also improved the reduction of water molecules through two ways: i) accelerating the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the composite to the solution, co-catalyzing the H2 production process (see Fig. 11b iii) and ii) increasing the flat band potential (see Table 4), generating photo-electrons owing higher reduction potential for the photocatalytic reduction process [70,71]. According to the (photo)electrochemical characterization, the interaction between Au nanoparticles and WO3 can be described as shown in Scheme 1 . Upon irradiation, photo-electrons are transferred from WO3 to Au nanoparticles; these photo-electrons, with higher reduction potential are then transferred to the adsorbed water molecules, boosting the hydrogen production. On the other hand, the holes produced in the valence band are trapped by methanol, preventing the recombination [80]."
14,Conclusions,"Cationic adsorption is a liable method for deposition of Au on the low IEP semiconductor WO3. The most basic conditions are the best for the adsorption of the [Au(en)2]3+ complex, due to the reduction of the complex charge from +3 to +1, and thus the 1:1 Au:WO3 reaction ratio was achieved. Due to the low specific surface area of the semiconductor, 16 h were necessary to accomplish the 100% deposition of the Au under basic conditions. Higher reaction times would be necessary to complete deposition under neutral and acidic conditions. Small and well dispersed Au nanoparticles were obtained upon thermal treatment using air. The nanoparticle size was ∼2 nm smaller than that reported using photodeposition and sonochemical deposition methods. Au/WO3 materials demonstrated to be more efficient (3152, 3309 and 2951 μmol/g for 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%, respectively) than unmodified WO3 (2771 μmol/g) and Degussa P25 (1287 μmol/g) for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The 0.5 wt.% Au/WO3 material was 1.2 times more effective in the H2 production than unmodified WO3 and 2.57 times than Degussa P25. This behavior can be associated with the higher electronegativity of Au and the increase of the reduction potential of the photo-generated electrons upon their migration to the conduction band of the Au metallic nanoparticles."
