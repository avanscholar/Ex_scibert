0,Introduction,"For catalytic gas-liquid reactions such as production of aniline by hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, slurry or fluidized-bed reactors have been commonly used in industry [1] and academic research [2–4]. With the emerging trend of process intensification and miniaturization, catalytic membrane reactors [5] and falling film reactors [6] have been investigated to minimize heat losses and chemical processes. Monolith and micro reactors are two of recent promising concepts for intensifying heterogeneously catalyzed gas-liquid reactions [7]. For sufficiently low superficial gas and liquid velocities, a segmented two-phase slug flow with elongated gas bubbles occurs in mini- and microchannels, so-called Taylor flow [8]. The large interfacial area per unit volume, the thin liquid film, and the recirculation vortex in the liquid slug make Taylor flow attractive for multiphase monolith reactors [9,10]. The mass transfer of chemical species from the gas bubble to the catalytic wall takes place by two different paths. The first path is given by the mass transfer from the elongated bubble body into the liquid film and through the liquid film toward the wall. The second path is given by the mass transfer from the front and rear caps of the bubble into the liquid slug and from the liquid slug towards the wall. For hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, the hydrogen mass transfer through the liquid film may contribute to more than 70 % of the total hydrogen transport [11]. For recent reviews on hydrodynamics and mass transfer in Taylor flow, we refer to [12–15]. Process intensification in multiphase reactors requires elimination of the diffusional resistances [16]. In Taylor flow, the thin liquid film between the elongated gas bubbles and the coated walls provides a short diffusion path. Only when diffusive mass transfer through the liquid film supplies the reactants to the reaction sites at a rate commensurate with the kinetics of the reaction, the intrinsic reaction rate can be achieved. In combination with detailed experimental investigations [17,18], modeling and simulation remain a great need for understanding the coupling between hydrodynamics, mass transport, and chemical reaction in Taylor flow in order to guide optimization. Despite a rapid increase in computing power, interface resolving numerical simulations are still not able to cover all details of the fully coupled processes. For example, the effects of varying liquid composition during the reaction progress on hydrodynamics and mass transfer have not been sufficiently addressed so far. In the present study, we consider the example of liquid phase catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in Taylor flow. Being an important technological stage in the production of aniline, this reaction represents one of the sample systems studied within the Helmholtz-Energy-Alliance “Energy-efficient chemical multiphase processes” [19] which funded this work. Aniline is one of the most important chemical compounds, assisting human life in recent years as a precursor of many chemical products from kitchen sponges to building insulation, finding use in rubber processing, dyes and pigments, agricultural chemicals and pharmaceuticals [1]. Aniline is produced by a chemical reduction of nitrobenzene through the catalytic hydrogenation process. While both gas-phase and liquid-phase hydrogenations are available, liquid-phase production is advantageous for chemical processing. Typical operating conditions of this liquid-phase process in industrial slurry or fluidized-bed reactors are temperatures in the range 363 – 573 K at pressures in the range 0.1 – 0.6 MPa [1]. The aim of this study is identifying the influence of liquid composition on physical (non-reactive) mass transfer in the liquid film of Taylor flow with a view to guidance of optimal hydrodynamic operating conditions. A sketch of the problem to be examined is shown in Fig. 1 , which is described in more detail below. One basic requirement for carrying out the study is knowledge of the physical properties of the liquid mixture. Unlike gaseous mixture that can be mostly estimated by known equations of state such as ideal gas law, there is no rigorous and univocal rule for estimating physical properties of liquid mixtures. The knowledge is still highly depending on the availability of experimental data in literature. For simplicity, we restrict our study to two different binary liquid mixtures. The first one consists of nitrobenzene (NB) and aniline (AN) as reactant and product of the reaction. The second mixture consists of nitrobenzene and ethanol (ET) which is normally added as solvent to dilute nitrobenzene [2]. The high heat of reaction of NB hydrogenation requires an adequate heat management of the reactor. Experiments using lab scale batch reactors such as an autoclave are often conducted with a heating jacket [3], a cooling bath [4] or a water run cooling coil [20] to keep constant temperature. For monolith reactors, structures made out of materials with a high thermal conductivity have been proposed as an attractive alternative to conventional catalyst supports for the use in highly exothermic reactions [21,22]. For micro- and milli-reactors, Westermann and Mleczko [23] proposed a short-cut approach for the simple assessment of maximum channel diameters permitting near-isothermal operation of fast exothermic reactions. According to the respective criterion, diameters < 500 μm are required for hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds. However, such small channels may result in a pressure drop prohibitive for industrial production capacities. In the present study, the influence of temperature on physical properties is neglected for simplicity. Instead, the effect of liquid composition is investigated for a fixed temperature of 303.15 K and atmospheric pressure, since knowledge on physical properties at higher temperature and pressure is very limited. For these conditions, the dependencies of density, viscosity, surface tension, solubility and hydrogen diffusivity on composition are determined for both liquid mixtures using information from literature. By numerical solution of the unsteady one-dimensional diffusion equation with composition-dependent physical properties, the instantaneous hydrogen concentration across the liquid film is obtained for different conditions. The time required to achieve a certain degree of hydrogen saturation in the liquid film is evaluated and used to estimate the necessary Taylor bubble length to achieve this saturation during the passage of one Taylor bubble. The results of the present study indicate that a change of composition of the liquid film either due to dilution or due to reaction progress notably affects mass transfer in the liquid film of Taylor flow due to a complex interplay between various processes relying on composition-dependent physical properties."
1,Mixture properties,"The physical system of interest in the present study is related to the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene where liquid nitrobenzene is transformed to liquid aniline with water as a byproduct. As the liquid composition changes during the reaction process, the physical properties of the liquid phase change accordingly. In this paper, the influence of byproduct water is neglected since reliable correlations for physical properties of ternary liquid mixtures are hardly known. The physical properties of the remaining pure liquids are summarized in Table 1 . This section provides an estimation of the physical properties of the liquid mixtures nitrobenzene-aniline (NB + AN) and nitrobenzene-ethanol (NB + ET) at 303.15 K and 1 atm. For consistency of notation, the species i = 1 – 3 are distinguished by subscripts as follows: 1 = H2, 2 = NB, 3 = AN or ET. Fundamentally, the physical properties of solutions consisting of two liquid components A and B depend on the molecular interactions between particles A-A, A-B and B-B. In this context, three categories are distinguished in chemical thermodynamics [30]. In the most general case of real solutions, these interactions are all different, leading to non-zero enthalpy of mixing in combination with a change of volume. In ideal solutions, all these interactions are similar, the enthalpy of mixing and the volume change being both zero. In regular solutions [31], the molecular interactions are non-similar, while the differences are sufficiently small so that the entropy of mixing is nearly that of an ideal solution. The enthalpy of mixing and the volume change of regular solutions are, however, non-zero in contrast to ideal solutions."
2,Density and viscosity of liquid mixture,"2.1 Density and viscosity of liquid mixture The density of liquid mixtures depends not only on composition but also on temperature, pressure and volume, as for the density of pure liquids. Ideal gas law is a widely used equation of state for gaseous mixtures and is also applicable to the liquid mixtures with additional correlations. The difference between ideal gas approximation and real properties is mainly caused by the volume of liquid mixture varying with respect to the liquid composition. Likewise, viscosities of gaseous mixtures can be described by a linear function of composition while viscosities of liquid solutions require more complex equations especially when they contain alcohol or water. The liquid viscosities are sensitive to the molecular structures and small association affects the viscosity significantly [32]. Many studies have been carried out by means of complex expressions and computational tools; however, there has been no rigorous basis found to describe the interactions of different mixture components [32]. Irving [33] listed the classical methods for viscosities of liquid mixtures, showing that they highly depend on the experimental data. UNIFAC-VISCO [34] is one of the predictive methods that is widely recommended for many binary mixtures and even for certain ternary and quaternary systems. However, it is only recommended in the absence of experimental data [32]. In this paper, mixture properties of NB + AN and NB + ET are computed from empirical correlations proposed in references [24] and [25], respectively. In both references, the excess molar volume (1) V E = x 2 M 2 + x 3 M 3 ρ m − x 2 M 2 ρ 2 + x 3 M 3 ρ 3 and the excess viscosity (2) μ E = μ m − ( x 2 μ 2 + x 3 μ 3 ) ︸ = μ MA were measured. Here, M 2, x 2, ρ 2, μ 2 and M 3, x 3 = 1 – x 2, ρ 3, μ 3 are the molecular weight, mole fraction, density and viscosity of pure components NB and AN or ET, respectively. Both excess quantities are fitted by least square method to the Redlich-Kistler polynomial (3) V E or μ E = x 2 x 3 ∑ j = 0 n a j ( x 2 − x 3 ) j where n denotes the number of coefficients. With the values given in Table 2 , the mixture density and viscosity can be obtained by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. Fig. 2 presents the mixture density and mixture viscosity for NB + AN and NB + ET as a function of nitrobenzene mole fraction x NB. Also shown for comparison are the molar-average densities ρ MA = x 2 ρ 2 + x 3 ρ 3 and the molar-average viscosities μ MA. The profiles for the density in Fig. 2(a) show only small differences between ρ m and ρ MA for both mixtures. This is because the excess molar volumes, whose order of magnitude are 0.1 cm3 mol−1, are much smaller than the molar volumes of nitrobenzene (103.2 cm3 mol−1) and aniline (92.0 cm3 mol−1). In contrast, excess viscosities in the mole fraction range x NB = 0.4 – 0.6 are up to 24.6 % and 18 % of molar-averaged viscosities for NB + AN and NB + ET, respectively. These relatively high excess viscosities result in significant differences between mixture viscosities and molar-averaged viscosities as shown in Fig. 2(b)."
3,Surface tension of liquid mixture,"2.2 Surface tension of liquid mixture The surface tensions of pure nitrobenzene and pure aniline are very similar, cf. Table 1. The surface tension of the NB + AN mixture is therefore taken as constant regardless of liquid composition, using the value of pure nitrobenzene. The surface tensions of pure nitrobenzene and pure ethanol are different in contrast. Therefore, for estimation of the surface tension of NB + ET mixture, a model is required. Estimating surface tension of the liquid mixtures is as complex as the other mixture properties described previously, as neither experimental data nor rigorous models are available in literature. Suri and Ramakrishna [36] identified two theoretical correlations that predict surface tension of binary liquid solutions containing nitrobenzene satisfactorily. Here, we apply and compare both models for estimating the surface tension of NB + ET. Assuming that both the bulk liquid and the surface layer form ideal solutions, the correlation by Hildebrand and Scott [37] is (4) σ m = x 2 σ 2 + x 3 σ 3 − A m 2 R ¯ T ( σ 2 − σ 3 ) 2 x 2 x 3 Here, R ¯ is the gas constant and A m denotes the surface occupancy of molecule, which can be approximated as A m= (A 2+ A 3) / 2. The surface occupancy of species i is given by Hoar and Melford [38] as A i = V i 2 / 3 N 1 / 3 where N is the Avogadro number. The second correlation proposed by Hoar and Melford [38] is based on the regular solution theory [31]. Assuming that the total volume remains unchanged, it reads (5) σ m = σ 2 + R ¯ T A 2 ln x ′ 2 x 2 + Y A 2 ( l ′ x ′ 3 2 − x 3 2 ) = σ 3 + R ¯ T A 3 ln x ′ 3 x 3 + Y A 3 ( l ′ x ′ 2 2 − x 2 2 ) Here, x 2′ and x 3′ are liquid mole fractions on the surface monolayer. The model parameter l′ is in the range between 0.5 and 0.75. Furthermore, Y = ΔH m / (x 2 x 3) is a parameter related to the enthalpy of mixing ΔH m. The latter can be estimated by solubility parameters as ΔH m= (δ L,2–δ L,3)2 V H2,L [39]. For a fixed value of l′ and given mole fractions x 2 and x 3 = 1 – x 2, the surface monolayer mole fractions x 2′ and x 3′ = 1 – x 2′ are obtained from Eq. (5) by an iterative root-finding method within 0.01 % relative error. Fig. 3 shows the surface tension of NB + ET monotonically varying with x NB taking values between the surface tensions of both pure liquids. For the Hoar and Melford method [38], a value l′ = 0.5 is used in Fig. 3 as recommended in [36]. Changing the value to l′ = 0.75 gives almost no difference. The surface tensions profiles from both correlations are close over the entire range of liquid composition. In the following, surface tension from the Hildebrand method is employed."
4,Hydrogen diffusivity in liquid mixture,"2.3 Hydrogen diffusivity in liquid mixture Measurements of hydrogen diffusivity in both liquid solutions are not available in literature to our knowledge. The hydrogen diffusivity is therefore estimated by the multicomponent and effective diffusivity models. For the one-dimensional case of a ternary system studied here, the diffusive fluxes in the multicomponent model can be expressed as (6) J = - c tot D MC G ∂ x ∂ z Here, J = (J 1, J 2)T represents the column vector of species fluxes in z-direction and x = (x 1, x 2)T the corresponding column vector of species mole fractions. Furthermore, it is x 3 = 1 – x 1 – x 2 and c tot=c 1+c 2+c 3. For a ternary gas mixture, the constituents of 2 × 2 square matrix of Fick’s diffusivity D MC are defined by the combination of binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities Ð i , j of i-component diffusing into j-component as follows [40] (7) D MC = 1 S Ð 1 , 3 x 1 Ð 2 , 3 + ( 1 − x 1 ) Ð 1 , 2 x 1 Ð 2 , 3 ( Ð 1 , 3 − Ð 1 , 2 ) x 2 Ð 1 , 3 ( Ð 2 , 3 − Ð 1 , 2 ) Ð 2 , 3 x 2 Ð 1 , 3 + ( 1 − x 2 ) Ð 1 , 2 where S = x 1 Ð 2 , 3 + x 2 Ð 1 , 3 + x 3 Ð 1 , 2 . The effective diffusivity model defines the diffusive flux as (8) J = − c tot D eff G ∂ x ∂ z where the matrix D eff is given by [41] (9) D eff = ( 1 − x 1 ) x 2 Ð 1 , 2 + x 3 Ð 1 , 3 − 1 0 0 ( 1 − x 2 ) x 1 Ð 1 , 2 + x 3 Ð 2 , 3 − 1 The matrix G in both formulations represents the thermodynamic correction factor which accounts for non-ideality effects. For ideals fluids, where only binary collisions take place, it is G = I with I denoting the identity matrix. However, ideal fluid assumption is not valid for liquids where three (or more) molecule collisions occur sufficiently frequently and contribute to the momentum transfer process [41]. Here, we neglect the hydrogen concentration in liquid phase which is very small as compared to the concentration of liquid species. The ternary mixture in liquid phase then reduces to a binary mixture. This allows simplifying the matrix of thermodynamic factor as G = I where Γ is a scalar. From regular solution theory it is [41] (10) Γ = 1 − 2 Δ G E R ¯ T where ΔG E is Gibb’s excess energy for flow defined in [24] as (11) Δ G E = Δ G m − ( x 2 Δ G 2 + x 3 Δ G 3 ) The binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities for hydrogen Ð H2 , j (index i = 1 in Eqs. (7) and (9)) are given in Table 1. The binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities of liquids Ð 2 , 3 = Ð NB , AN = Ð NB , ET are assumed to be zero, as diffusion between liquid components is neglected here. The matrix elements in Eqs. (7) and (9) simplify accordingly. The hydrogen diffusivities in the two mixtures estimated by both diffusion models are compared in Fig. 4 (a), showing the upper diagonal elements of matrices D MC and D eff . The diffusivity profiles show non-linear behaviors in terms of mixture composition, which is caused by the non-ideality effect. The estimated diffusivities from both diffusion models are almost identical for the two liquid mixtures, similar to the case of pure liquids [42]. Fig. 4(b) displays the Schmidt number Sc= μ m/ (ρ m D H2-L) as a function of x NB. For pure NB it is Sc = 545. As x NB decreases, Sc strongly increases for NB + AN up to Sc = 1724 but decreases for NB + ET down to Sc = 389 in the limit of pure AN and ET, respectively."
5,Hydrogen solubility in liquid mixture,"2.4 Hydrogen solubility in liquid mixture No experimental work regarding the solubility of hydrogen in NB + AN and NB + ET mixtures has been found in literature. The solubility of hydrogen in both liquid mixtures is therefore estimated from the solubility in the pure liquids given in Table 1 using correlations from literature. Radhakrishnan et al. [29] employed two correlations for estimating hydrogen solubility in binary liquid mixtures. The first one suggested by Prausnitz and Shair [39] is a correlation based on regular solution theory. The mole fraction of gaseous hydrogen in liquid mixture is defined by (12) − ln x H2-L = ln f H2-L f H2-L,atm + V H2-L ( δ ¯ L − δ ¯ H2-G ) 2 R ¯ T where f H2-L is the fugacity of hypothetical liquid hydrogen and f H2-L,atm is the fugacity of hydrogen at hydrogen partial pressure of 101 kPa. V H2-L represents the molar volume of hypothetical liquid hydrogen. In Eq. (12), δ ¯ L and δ ¯ H2-G are the mean solubility parameters for liquid and hydrogen defined by (13) δ ¯ L = ϕ 2 δ L , 2 + ϕ 3 δ L , 3 , δ ¯ H2-G = ϕ 2 δ H2-G , 2 + ϕ 3 δ H2-G , 3 where (14) ϕ 2 = x L , 2 V L , 2 x L , 2 V L , 2 + x L , 3 V L , 3 denotes the volume fraction of NB and ϕ 3 = 1 − ϕ 2 . With these definitions, the second correlation suggested by Hildebrand et al. [43] reads (15) ln x H2-L = ϕ 2 ln x H2-L , 2 + ϕ 3 ln x H2-L , 3 − ϕ 2 ϕ 3 ( δ L,2 − δ L,3 ) 2 V H2-L R ¯ T The solubility parameters δ L,2 and δ L,3 are a function of temperature and correlated to the heat of evaporation and molar volume of the solvent, see [29]. Fig. 5 shows the estimated solubility of hydrogen in the liquid mixtures in terms of a non-dimensional Henry number defined as ratio of concentrations (16) H H2 = c H2-L c H2-G = x H2-L / V L,m ρ H2 / M H2 Solubility changes almost linearly between the solubility values for two pure liquids. Both methods show similar trends. Radhakrishnan et al. [29] reported that the two correlations agree quite well with the experimental data with Hildebrand’s method being slightly closer to the experimental data. Therefore, the correlation from Hildebrand [43] is used in the following."
6,Hydrogen mass transfer in liquid film,
7,Taylor flow hydrodynamics,"3.1 Taylor flow hydrodynamics The hydrodynamics of gas-liquid Taylor flow is essentially governed by two dimensionless parameters, the capillary number (Ca) and the Reynolds number (Re). The capillary number Ca= μ m u B / σ m represents the ratio between viscous and surface tension forces, while the Reynolds number Re = ρ m u B d / μ m represents the ratio between inertial and viscous forces. Here, d denotes a characteristic lateral dimension of the channel. For the pipe it is d = 2R and for the planar channel d = 2H. The ratio of both dimensionless groups is the Laplace number L a = R e / C a = σ m ρ m d / μ m 2 . The Laplace number is independent on bubble velocity but varies with composition as shown in Fig. 6 . This shows that the relative importance of viscous, inertial and surface tension forces that determine Taylor flow hydrodynamics also depends on composition. The main hydrodynamic parameter of interest here is the liquid film thickness (h F), respectively its non-dimensional counterpart δ F = 2 h F / d. For planar Taylor flow, the non-dimensional film thickness relates to the capillary number as [44] (17) δ F, ∥ ( C a ) = h F, ∥ H = 0.417 1 − exp ( − 1.69 C a 0.5025 ) while the film thickness of Taylor flow in a circular pipe is [45] (18) δ F, ○ ( C a ) = h F, ○ R = 1.34 C a 2 / 3 1 + 3.35 C a 2 / 3 Since Ca varies with composition, the same is true for h F and δ F. As a consequence, the diffusive mass transfer through the liquid film depends on liquid composition as well. In the following, the composition-dependent interaction between hydrodynamics and mass transfer is investigated by two hypothetical scenarios: fixed capillary number and fixed Reynolds number. Both scenarios may not occur in reality, where more likely the mean axial pressure gradient along the capillary is constant. The pressure drop in Taylor flow depends in a complicate manner on Ca and Re, and on the length of the liquid slug [46,47], so that the constant pressure-gradient scenario is not investigated here. The advantage of the two present scenarios is that the assumptions of constant values for Ca or Re determines the bubble velocity, see below, which is otherwise unknown. In the first scenario, the capillary number is set to 0.01 corresponding to the fixed film thicknesses h F,|| / H = 0.032 and h F, ○ / R = 0.027 in a planar and circular channel, respectively. In this scenario, the composition-dependent physical properties of the liquid mixture result in a variation of the bubble velocity according to u B(x NB) = 0.01 σ m(x NB) / μ m(x NB). In the second scenario, the Reynolds number is fixed to Re = 100. In this case, both the bubble velocity u B(x NB) = 100 d −1 μ m(x NB) / ρ m(x NB) and h F are varying with liquid composition since Ca(x NB) = Re(x NB) / La(x NB). Fig. 7 displays the corresponding relationships for u B and h F for the two test scenarios and both liquid mixtures. For NB + ET, the variations of u B and h F with x NB are quite small. However, for NB + AN, they are larger, especially for the case Re = 100, where u B varies by a factor of two. Fig. 7(b) also illustrates the influence of channel shape on h F which is quite small. Overall, the dependence of u B and h F on composition is very weak for fixed Ca but is much stronger for fixed Re."
8,Unsteady unidirectional diffusion,"3.2 Unsteady unidirectional diffusion If the Taylor bubble is sufficiently long, an axial region with a uniform liquid film is formed extending over most of the bubble length. Under negligible gravity and for low gas-to-liquid viscosity ratios, the liquid film is stagnant since the gas phase cannot exert tangential stresses at the interface. Accordingly, mass transfer of hydrogen from the gas-liquid interface through the stagnant liquid film towards the wall is by diffusion only. From experiments in batch reactors it is known that the reaction rate of nitrobenzene hydrogenation is very slow as compared to hydrogen mass transfer [3,4]. Given the short time scales corresponding to the passage of a Taylor bubble considered here, the effects of the heterogeneous reaction at the catalytic wall are neglected in the following. In addition, we assume that there is no variation of liquid composition in wall-normal direction so that the hydrogen diffusivity D H2-L across the liquid film is uniform. Fig. 1 shows a sketch of the problem. For a circular pipe, we consider a cylindrical coordinate system with radial coordinate 0 ≤ r ≤ R, where r = 0 corresponds to the pipe axis and r = R to the pipe wall. The radial position of the gas-liquid interface is r int = R – h F. For a planar channel with height 2H, we consider a Cartesian coordinate system. The wall-normal coordinate is denoted by z, where z = 0 corresponds to the symmetry axis so that the upper channel half is represented by 0 ≤ z ≤ H. The position of the gas-liquid interface is z int = H – h F. With the above assumptions and definitions, hydrogen mass transfer in the liquid film is described by the following generalized one-dimensional unsteady diffusion equation (19) ∂ c H2-L ∂ t = − 1 r a ∂ J ∂ r = D H2-L r a ∂ ∂ r r a ∂ c H2-L ∂ r Here, a serves to distinguish between cylindrical (a = 1) and Cartesian (a = 0) coordinates, where for the latter case r is replaced by z. Eq. (19) needs to be complemented by appropriate initial and boundary conditions. As initial condition, we assume that the hydrogen concentration in the liquid film (c H2-L) is zero at time t = 0. Concerning the boundary conditions, we assume that the hydrogen concentration in the Taylor bubble is constant during the short period of calculation time, with a value of c H2-G =40.2 mol m−3 at 303.15 K and 1 atm. With these assumptions, the boundary condition at the liquid side of the gas-liquid interface is given by (20) c H2-L r = R − h F = c H2-L z = H − h F = c H2-L-eq = H H2 c H2-G where H H2 = H H2 (x NB) is the non-dimensional Henry number, cf. Fig. 5. The boundary condition at the solid wall is a no-flux condition (21) ∂ c H2-L ∂ r r = R = ∂ c H2-L ∂ z z = H = 0 By analogy between heat and mass transfer, analytical solutions for the present problem are available in literature [48]. For the planar case, Eq. (4.10) in [48] transfers to the similarity solution (22) c H2-L ( z , t ) c H2-L-eq = 1 − 4 π ∑ n = 1 ∞ ( − 1 ) n − 1 2 n − 1 cos 2 n − 1 2 π z − z int h F exp − 2 n − 1 2 π 2 F o where F o = D H2-L t / h F 2 is the Fourier number and z int ≤ z ≤ H. The mean concentration in the liquid film follows from Eq. (4.19a) in [48] as (23) c H2-L-mean ( t ) c H2-L-eq = 1 − 8 π 2 ∑ n = 1 ∞ 1 ( 2 n − 1 ) 2 exp − 2 n − 1 2 π 2 F o For the circular pipe, the time-dependent radial concentration profile in the annular liquid film c H2-L ( r , t ) can be obtained from Eq. (6.136) in [48] in terms of an infinite series involving Bessel functions. Due to the complexity of the analytical solutions, we solve Eq. (19) numerically by a (Forward-Time Central-Space) finite difference method employing 41 uniform mesh cells using a time step width of 10−8 s. Numerical solutions are obtained for nitrobenzene mole fractions x NB = 0, 0.1, 0.2, …, 0.9, 1. The problem is governed by three main parameters; hydrogen diffusivity (D H2-L) and liquid film thickness (h F) are the key parameters to govern hydrogen diffusion from the Taylor bubble to the wall, while the composition-dependent Henry number (H H2) determines the hydrogen concentration at the gas-liquid interface. Further composition-dependent physical properties (density, viscosity, surface tension) affect the hydrogen mass transfer in both liquid mixtures only indirectly by changing the liquid film thickness."
9,Hydrogen saturation times,"3.3 Hydrogen saturation times To quantify the time needed to achieve a certain level of hydrogen saturation in the liquid film, two kinds of saturation time are defined (24) 1 h F ( R − h F / 2 ) a ∫ R − h F R c H2-L ( r , t sat-L ) c H2-L-eq r a d r = k sat-L (25) 1 h F ( R − h F / 2 ) a ∫ R − h F R c H2-L ( r , t sat-G ) c H2-L-eq r a d r = k sat-G H H2 where 0 < k sat-L < 1 and 0 < k sat-G < H H2. Both time scales are basically different. The saturation time t sat-L does not include the influence of variation of Henry number with regards to composition and is useful for analyzing the combined effects of hydrogen diffusivity and liquid film thickness. The saturation time t sat-G instead includes this influence and accounts for changing equilibrium concentration on the liquid side of the interface. To evaluate both saturation times, the one-dimensional numerical concentration profiles obtained for discrete instants in time are integrated in space until Eq. (24) and Eq. (25) are satisfied. Fig. 8 illustrates the dependence of t sat-L and t sat-G on x NB for both scenarios and channel geometries. For fixed capillary number, the t sat-L profiles for both mixtures in Fig. 8(a) correspond to the inverse profiles of diffusivity shown in Fig. 4. For the NB + AN mixture, t sat-L is in a wide range of composition larger than in the pure liquids; its value is largest for x NB = 0.4, meaning that hydrogen mass transfer is lowest. Due to the influence of composition-dependent equilibrium concentration, the profiles for t sat-L in Fig. 8(a) show a different shape as compared to the curves for t sat-L, while the overall trend is still similar. For the NB + ET mixture, the decrease in solubility with increase of x NB results in an increase of t sat-G delaying mass transfer. Dilution of nitrobenzene with ethanol thus increases the diffusive mass transfer of hydrogen in the liquid film. The saturation times for fixed Reynolds number are shown in Fig. 8(b). In this case, both saturation times are mainly affected by the liquid film thickness in combination with minor effects due to composition-dependent diffusivity and solubility. Interestingly, with decrease of x NB, both saturation times strongly increase for mixture NB + AN, while they moderately decrease for mixture NB + ET. This can be explained by the dependence of mixture viscosity on x NB, showing opposite trends in Fig. 2(b). The relevant non-dimensional group for unsteady diffusion is the Fourier number (Fo) introduced above. To further characterize the saturation times from Fig. 8, we define Fo sat-L= Fo (t = t sat-L) and Fo sat-G= Fo (t = t sat-G). The results for both saturation Fourier numbers are displayed in Fig. 9 . For the case Ca = 0.01 shown in Fig. 9(a), Fo sat-L is independent on x NB for both geometries. For the case Re = 100 shown in Fig. 9(b), Fo sat-L is independent on composition for the planar channel only. Furthermore, in all cases where Fo sat-L is independent on x NB, the value of Fo sat-L is identical for both mixtures (NB + AN and NB + ET). The reason for these behaviors will be given below. In contrast to Fo sat-L, the Fourier number Fo sat-G always depends on composition, see Fig. 9(b). The reason is that t sat-G depends on the Henry number, cf. Eq. (25), which varies with composition. Notably, for Fo sat-G opposite trends are observed for NB + AN and NB + ET as x NB decreases, due to opposite trends for the Henry number, cf. Fig. 5. The composition-dependent liquid equilibrium concentration is thus a decisive parameter to control hydrogen saturation in the liquid film of Taylor flow. So far, one specific value of k sat-L and k sat-G is considered only. Since in Fig. 9(a) Fo sat-L is independent of composition, we are interested in the relation Fo sat-L=Fo sat-L(k sat-L) for both channel types. For a planar channel, we obtain from the analytical mean hydrogen concentration in Eq. (23) and the definition of t sat-L in Eq. (24) the relation (26) k sat-L = 1 − 8 π 2 ∑ n = 1 ∞ 1 ( 2 n − 1 ) 2 exp − 2 n − 1 2 π 2 F o sat-L The independency of Fo sat-L on liquid composition in the planar channel observed in Fig. 9 for both scenarios (Ca = 0.01 and Re = 100) is thus in full agreement with Eq. (26). The analytical relation of Eq. (26) is graphically displayed in Fig. 10 . As expected, the Fourier number Fo sat-L strongly increases as k sat-L approaches unity. Included in Fig. 10 are numerical results for Fo sat-L for different values of k sat-L in the range 0.1 – 0.9. For the planar channel (a = 0), numerical and analytical results are in excellent agreement, thus validating the computations. For the circular pipe (a = 1), the numerical results for Fo sat-L depend not only on k sat-L but also on ratio h F/R. However, when displaying Fo sat-L(1–δ F/2) a versus k sat-L, as done in Fig. 10, all data collapse to one master curve. To obtain an explicit relation Fo sat-L(k sat-L), we fit the master curve in Fig. 10 by relation Eq. (27) results from an alternative series representation of Eq. (26) which is more suitable for small values of Fo, see pg. 49 in [48], where here the first term in the series is considered only. Similarly, Eq. (28) is obtained by restricting the sum in Eq. (26) to the first term only. Fig. 10 shows that Eqs. (27) and (28) are excellent approximations of Eq. (26) for the planar channel (a = 0) in the ranges 0 ≤ k sat-L< 0.4 and 0.4 ≤ k sat-L< 1, respectively. In conclusion, the diffusive mass transfer in the liquid film depends in a complex manner on the composition of the liquid mixture. Prominent roles are taken by hydrogen diffusivity and solubility. The delay caused by the non-ideality effect in liquid mixture may be limitation factor which further retards the overall rate of surface reaction."
10,Bubble length and liquid film saturation,"3.4 Bubble length and liquid film saturation In this subsection, we utilize the saturation time to estimate the necessary Taylor bubble length to obtain a certain degree of hydrogen saturation in the liquid film during the passage of one Taylor bubble. To quantify this length, a second time scale for the duration of unsteady mass transfer between the moving bubble and the stagnant liquid film is required. Here, the film exposure time t F,ex = L B/u B serves for this purpose, as it characterizes the time period when the stagnant liquid film is exposed to hydrogen during the passage of one Taylor bubble. Equating saturation time and film exposure time (t sat-L = t F,ex-sat-L = L B-sat-L/u B) yields a condition for the proper bubble length L B-sat-L which reads (29) L B-sat-L d = t sat-L u B d = F o sat-L h F d h F u B D H2 ⏟ = P e F = 0.25 ⋅ S c ⋅ L a ⋅ F o sat-L C a ⋅ δ F 2 Here, Pe F is a Peclet number with liquid film thickness as length scale. The importance of Pe F for mass transfer in Taylor flow has already been noted in [49]. The dimensionless film thicknesses δ F = δ F(Ca) for the planar and the circular channel are given in Eqs. (17) and (18), respectively, while Fo sat-L is given by Eqs. (27) and (28). To evaluate Eq. (29), we consider pure nitrobenzene with a Schmidt number Sc = 545. For the planar channel, Fo sat-L and La are both independent on Ca, whereas for the pipe, only La is independent on Ca. To quantify the required bubble length for both channel geometries, we evaluate Eq. (29) for values k sat-L = 0.05 and 0.5 in combination with d = 100 μm (La = 1951) and 1000 μm (La = 19512). The results in Fig. 11 show that for given values of channel size and degree of saturation, L B-sat-L / d strongly depends on the capillary number. An increase of Ca requires much longer bubbles to reach the same level of saturation. This is due to two effects: an increase of liquid film thickness and a decrease of film exposure time. The channel geometry only has a slight effect, with circular channels requiring slightly shorter bubbles. In Taylor flow, the ratio between bubble length and channel size is typically in the range 1 < L B/ d≤ 10 (the shaded region in Fig. 11), though larger ratios are possible as well. For d = 100 μm and L B/ d = 5, a saturation of 5 % may easily be reached during the passage of one Taylor bubble for Ca up to 0.2. For d = 1000 μm, a saturation of 5 % is only reached for Ca < 0.05. For reaching a saturation of 50 %, capillary numbers below 0.015 and below 0.004 are required in channels with d = 100 μm and d = 1000 μm, respectively. Since with decrease of Ca, the dimensionless film thickness δ F decreases as well, the volume of the saturated film decreases accordingly. Alternative to the latter approach, Eqs. (27) - (29) may be used to estimate from given values of Sc, La, Ca and L B/ d, the corresponding degree of film saturation k sat-L. Because the Schmidt number and Laplace number depend on liquid composition, the same holds for the necessary bubble length. Fig. 12 displays the necessary bubble length to obtain a saturation of 1 % of gas concentration for NB + AN and NB + ET at fixed capillary number 0.01 as a function of x NB. In overall procedure of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, the effective bubble length is nearly 1.5 times longer than those for the pure liquids. Meanwhile, L B-sat-G for NB + ET mixture is shorter than that for NB + AN mixture. Adding ethanol to the nitrobenzene hydrogenation process thus may reduce L B-sat-G which enables to have a sufficient time for saturation with shorter Taylor bubbles. This evidence supports the fact that ethanol plays not only a role of diluent of reactant, but also acts to reduce the time for mass transfer. Eq. (29) represents a rough estimate of the required bubble length, tending to underestimate reality due to two effects. First, the uniform region of the liquid film extends only over a part of the total Taylor bubble length. This effect may be accounted for by a correction factor similar as in [47]. Second, due to the heterogeneous reaction at the catalytic wall the liquid film will tend to possess a certain lower hydrogen concentration. The latter effect may be investigated by replacing the no-flux boundary condition at the channel wall, Eq. (21), by an appropriate boundary condition depending on heterogeneous reaction rate."
11,Conclusions,"The influence of composition-dependent physical properties on diffusive mass transfer in the stagnant liquid film of gas-liquid Taylor flow is studied theoretically. The physical system investigated is related to the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline. Hence, the diffusion of hydrogen in liquid mixtures consisting of nitrobenzene and reaction product aniline or solvent ethanol are investigated. For both binary liquid mixtures, composition-dependent physical properties are determined in terms of nitrobenzene mole fraction using data and correlations from literature. Hydrogen mass transfer in the liquid film of Taylor flow in a planar channel and a circular pipe is studied by solving the unsteady one-dimensional diffusion equation with composition-dependent physical properties numerically. The numerical results are quantified in terms of the time needed to achieve a certain degree of hydrogen saturation in the liquid film. Relating this time to the duration, where the liquid film is exposed to hydrogen during the passage of one Taylor bubble, allows estimating the necessary bubble length to achieve a certain degree of saturation, or alternatively estimating for given bubble length the corresponding saturation. From the present study the following main conclusions can be drawn: • Density, surface tension and solubility of both liquid mixtures vary almost linearly with nitrobenzene mole fraction while viscosity and hydrogen diffusivity exhibit non-linear behaviors. • Hydrogen mass transfer is mainly governed by the thickness of the liquid film in combination with hydrogen diffusivity and solubility, all depending on composition. • In nitrobenzene-aniline mixtures, hydrogen diffuses in a wide range of compositions slower than in both pure liquids. • Dilution of nitrobenzene by ethanol may be an effective measure to enhance mass transfer. • Theoretical relations in terms of dimensionless parameters are derived which allow estimating the achievable hydrogen saturation in the liquid film of Taylor flow at various hydrodynamic conditions. These relations are not restricted to the present fluids but may be useful for other systems as well. In summary, the present study indicates that a change of liquid composition either due to reaction progress or due to dilution may notably affect mass transfer in the liquid film of Taylor flow due to a complex interplay between various processes relying on composition-dependent physical properties. In reality, the situation is even more complex due to reaction byproduct water which is not considered here."
