0,Introduction,"At present, fossil fuels, for instance, coal, petroleum, and gas, play a major role as the supply of chemicals and energy. However, because of the continuous depletion of fossil resources and global warming, sustainable biomass conversion into bio-fuel has turned out to be a sensitive topic in the research area to substitute energy based on oil. With all the improvements in transformation technology, plentiful resources of biomass have actually possible as starting material for biofuels [1,2]. On earth, cellulose is considered the most widespread non-food biomass, is really an ensuring renewable feedstock for the manufacturing chemicals and fuels. Particularly, the transformation of renewable raw biomass resources into high-grade liquid biofuels [3,4] as well as highly valuable chemicals [5]. Without a doubt, biomass conversion is probably the most attractive strategy [6]. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) has turned into a platform chemical that comes from biomass and a worthwhile intermediate to manufacture fine chemical and biofuel. 5-HMF is usually prepared by the dehydration of hexoses (also known as glucose and fructose) through acid catalysis [7,8]. Because of its high versatility and reactivity, it has been selected among the list of the leading 12 significant platform molecules produced from biomass by the United States of America- Department of Energy. It is known as a resourceful intermediate to connect the chemical industry and biomass resources. Because it contains a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde group. HMF could be furthermore transformed into a number of top-quality fuels such as 5-Methylfurfural, 5-Methylfurfuryl alcohol, Dimethylfuran [9–12]. Notably, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is a next-generation renewable biofuel produced from biomass, which is very attractive because of the advantages of the ideal boiling point (94 °C), significant research octane number (RON = 119), and energy density (30 kJ cm−3). Furthermore, it is perfectly miscible with gasoline, and in water, the solubility is lower (2.3 g L−1) [13,14]. Besides, a minimal solubility in water is better than miscible ethanol, which will make DMFmore desirable with water than ethanol as the blended fuel [15]. These exceptional properties make biomass-derived DMF a far more promising and appropriate liquid biofuel for transport. Presently, the most typical method for producing 2,5-dimethylfuran is hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of platform chemicals derived from biomass such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with hydrogen using metal-based catalysts. Hydrogenation of a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group is the primary concern; however, in the selective hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran, the major difficulty is to prevent the hydrogenation of a furan ring. Until now, a number of scientists have actually concentrated on the enhancement of the hydrogenolysis procedure, and a few heterogeneous catalysts were employed with this reaction [16]. In 2007, Dumesic and his co-workers presented a catalytic approach for the 2,5-dimethylfuran production from fructose through intermediate hydroxymethylfurfural, developing a strategy to convert large amounts of renewable biomass materials into liquid fuel. In this multi-stage pathway, Cu–Ru/C catalysts have been employed in the catalytic transformation of HMF into DMF, having a 71% yield of 2,5-dimethylfuran. The reaction conditions are feed (HMF) - 5 wt%; reaction temperature - 220 °C; pressure - 6.8 atm of H2 [17]. In 2013, Nishimura and his colleagues carried out the selective hydrogenation of HMF in the presence of a palladium−gold catalyst supported on carbon (Pd–Au/C) by using HCl and at atmospheric hydrogen pressure condition and gave excellent yield (96%) of 2,5-dimethylfuran. Wang and his coworkers synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles of PtCo, and obtained an HMF conversion and DMF yield of 100% and 98% respectively at 180 °C and 10 bar pressure after a reaction time of 2 h. Yang and his colleagues prepared Ni/Co3O4 catalysts performed a reaction at 1.0 MPa pressure, and at 130 °C, the DMF yield reached a maximum of 76% [18]. In recent times, Saha and his collaborators designed a Zn and Pd bimetallic catalyst supported on carbon and tested in the HMF conversion. The HMF and DMF reach a high conversion with better selectivity of 99% and 85%, respectively. But, after the fourth cycle, the catalyst was experienced deactivation [19]. From the above literature studies, we understand that noble metals are a good choice to catalyze HMF to DMF because of their excellent catalytic conversion and selectivity. However, taking into consideration of high cost, shortage, and long-lasting accessibility of noble metals, significant efforts were made to improve non-noble metal catalysts in recent times. Yong Sun achieved a 71.0 mol% yield of 2,5-DMF from vaporous 5-HMF over Ni–Cu/SBA-15 catalyst with a high H2 to the 5-HMF ratio 17:1 [20]. In Srivastava's research and his colleague's research, 2-methyl furan with a yield of 84 mol% was achieved by Cu–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with 4 MPa initial hydrogen pressure, and also the bimetallic catalyst synergistic effect was examined [21]. Hence, in the current study, we have prepared a series of bimetallic NiCu catalysts supported on SBA-16 with varying different wt.% of Cu (8, 10, 12 & 14) by a simple wet-impregnation method. The prepared non-noble catalysts were investigated in the hydrogenation reaction of HMF to DMF at the temperature 150–230 °C regime at different reduced hydrogen pressure (5–25 bar) in a liquid phase reactor. The enhanced activity of catalysts in relation with its structure relationship of NiCu/SBA-16 catalysts were obtained, compared and discussed in detail."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (>99%) and 2,5-Dimethylfuran (99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, Chennai), and solvents were purchased from SRL Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, Chennai). The metal precursors such as Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99%), Cu(NO3)2·6H2O (99%) and Pluronic F127 (99%) and TEOS (98%) for support synthesis were purchased from SRL (America). The other chemicals were purchased from local companies and used without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of SBA-16 support The preparation of SBA-16 materials was carried out based on the method described by Kleitz and his co-workers [22], making use of Pluronic F127 (triblock co-polymer - Sigma) and n-butanol as a nonionic template a co-surfactant, respectively. In a standard synthesis procedure, 3.5 g of Pluronic F127 was mixed in a 0.4 M HCl solution (175 mL) at 45 °C. The n-butanol (13 mL) was added to the above mixture. After that, 16.7 g of 98% TEOS (Tetraethyl orthosilicate - Acros Organics) was added with continuous stirring for 20 h. Then, the final mixture was heated in a polypropylene bottle for 24 h at 98 °C under standard conditions. The product that is precipitated was filtered in hot condition with no washing and followed by drying at 100 °C overnight. Final product calcinated for 5 h at 550 °C with airflow to remove the template. The final solid substances are designated as SBA-16. 2.2.2 Synthesis of bimetallic catalysts supported on SBA-16 The catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method [23]. Cu(NO3)2.3H2O and Ni(NO3)2.6H2Owere utilized as the metal sources, and SBA-16 was the support material. A specific quantity of a mixture of the two salts or each salt was dissolved in a distilled water (1.0 g SBA-16/1.1 mL H2O) based on the loading quantity (it had been described in which the loading quantity was the wt % of metal mass divided by the catalysts total weight). Subsequently, the solution was introduced into SBA-16, followed by the aging process continued at room temperature for 10 h with periodic stirring. The sample was dried for 10 h at 80 °C and followed by calcinated for 5 h at 500 °C (heating rate: 5 °C/min). Finally, the product (Cu/SBA-16) was reduced at 400 °C (10 °C/min heating rate) for 2 h, and the product Ni/SBA-16 or Ni–Cu/SBA-16 was reduced at 550 °C (10 °C/min heating rate) correspondingly. The 50 vol% Ar and 50 vol% H2 (300 mL/min) gas mixtures are passed for the reduction atmosphere."
4,Characterisation of support and catalysts,"2.3 Characterisation of support and catalysts The Advance X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV) operated at 40 kV with a radiation source of Cu Kαemployed for recording X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-synthesized catalysts. The diffraction information was obtained between 10° and 90° (2θ range) having a step size and scanning speed of 0.02° and a 10° min−1. The Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Surface area and Porosimetry Analyzer were used to measure N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of samples at −196 °C. At 373 K, the samples were degassed for 4 h in a vacuum before nitrogen adsorption experiments. The Chemisorption Analyzer (Make - Micromeritics, Model - AutoChem II 2920) fitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to perform H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis. The catalysts were reduced at a flow rate of 100 mL/min with a gas mixture (95%Ar/5%H2) and heating between 100 and 800 °C and having a 10 °C/min heating rate.NH3-TPD experiments were completed with QUADRASORB SI. TPD by making use of gas mixtures (95% of Ar and 5% of H2). The sample (about 0.05 g) was pre-treated for 2 h under 80 ml/min helium gas flow and at 400 °C prior to the TPD analysis. The sample's surface morphology and microstructural information's (HR-TEM images) were collected with the help of a Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope and JEOL instrument (JEM2010). The chemical environment of the Ni–Cu/SBA-16 catalyst was examined by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Make - Omicron Nanotechnology, Germany) having a monochromatic AlKα source XM1000 (hν = 1486.6 eV) operated at a power of 300 W(15 kV and 20 mA). And a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. The Casa XPS software was used for spectral fitting of C, O, Si, Cu, and Ni species."
5,Catalytic activity (hydrogenation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfual),"2.4 Catalytic activity (hydrogenation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfual) A benchtop autoclave batch reactor (Make - Amar Equipment, Mumbai, India; Materials - stainless steel; Capacity - 100 mL) with an automatic temperature controller, a pressure gauge, and a magnetic stirrer was used for the catalytic hydrogenation of 5-HMF. In a standard investigation, about 1.0 g of catalyst was reduced at 300 °C for 3 h bypassing H2 with a pressure of 0.1 bar. The temperature of the reactor was brought down to room temperature and purged with nitrogen. A later determined quantity of reactant (5-HMF - 0.2 g) with 20 mL of Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was introduced into the reactor. The catalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts was examined at temperatures ranging from 150 to 230 °C and a fixed hydrogen pressure of in the range of 5–25 bar and at 1000 rpm (stirring speed) for 6 h. Every single experimental run was carried out two times to making sure of reproducibility. Gas chromatography, coupled with an FID detector (Make - Shimatzu), was utilized to analyze the product samples. AB-5 capillary column with a dimension of 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 μm was used. In a general process, the oven temperature (initial) was kept at 50 °C, and the temperature elevated until 180 °C (heating ramp - 10 °C/min) and raised even further until 280 °C (heating ramp - 5 °C/min) and maintain for 2 min. The liquid product (about 1 μL) is injected into a capillary column with a split ratio of 20:1, and N2 was employed as a carrier gas."

7,Physicochemical properties of SBA-16 and Ni(5)-Cu(x)/SBA-16 catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of SBA-16 and Ni(5)-Cu(x)/SBA-16 catalysts 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction investigations 3.1.1.1 Low-angle X-ray diffraction Fig. 1 showing the SBA-16 and Ni(5)-Cu(x)/SBA-16 catalysts low angle X-ray diffraction patterns. Every single sample displays a characteristic peak around 0.8–1.4°, which are fits into the documented structure of 3D cubic microstructure and a space group of Im3m [1]. These characteristic reﬂections become wider, and peak intensity decreases with increasing Cu content, signifying that the materials structural order-level decreased. The 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 and 5Ni–14Cu/SBA-16 samples intensity much lower, which confirms that Cu is effectively loaded on these samples. The characteristic peak assigned to d (110) spacing shifted towards a lower angle in 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 and 5Ni–14Cu/SBA-16 samples, showing that the unit cell parameter enlarges with the increasing Cu content and signiﬁcant Cu incorporation in the extra framework position. 3.1.1.2 Wide-angle X-ray diffraction X-ray Diffraction analysis was carried out to determine the as-synthesized bimetallic catalysts phase purity and crystalline. Fig. 2 displays the 5Ni–8Cu/SBA-16, 5Ni–10Cu/SBA-16,5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16, and 5Ni–14Cu/SBA-16 catalysts high angle X-ray diffraction patterns. Each sample exhibited a broad peak around 23° (2θ) with a (002) plane, representing the amorphous silica phase. The diffraction peaks at 35.7°, 39.1°, and 49.2° were matches with the JCPDS No. 05–0661 and designated as copper oxide phases, and also the peaks at 37.5°, 43.4°, and 63.1° matches with the nickel oxide phases were noticed in the same X-ray diffraction pattern [24,25]. The intensity of diffraction peaks 35.5°, 38.8°, and 48.8° increases with increasing copper content from 8 to 14%, confirming that the copper is effectively loaded on SBA-16 support. The diffraction peak of nickel oxide at 37.2° was even found in a higher copper loading sample (5Ni–14Cu/SBA-16), which further proved that copper and nickel species were effectively dispersed on mesoporous SBA-16 support without agglomeration. By applying the Scherrer formula, the mean crystallite size of the bimetallic catalysts was estimated [26]. The FWHM and the position of the peak were acquired by fitting the calculated peaks by two Gaussian curves so as to find the width and real peak location related to the Cu Kα (monochromatic radiation). The average crystallite size for as-synthesized bimetallic catalysts calculated from the diffraction peaks 35.6° and 38.8°. Due to the crystallinity of the sample increases by increasing copper content from 8 to 14%, the crystallite size of the samples also decreases from 42.43 nm to 31.18 nm. 3.1.2 N2 adsorption and desorption analysis(BET) The pure SBA-16, as well as bimetallic loaded (various proportions of Ni–Cu) SBA-16 samples adsorption isotherms along with the pore size distribution curves, were shown in Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3B. The as-synthesized samples physicochemical characteristics are presented in Table 1 . The mesoporous support (SBA-16) showed the highest BET surface area of (500.15 m2/g) with a total pore volume (0.4031 cm3. g−1), respectively. In comparison, surface area and total pore volume considerably decrease for the bimetallic loaded supported catalysts because of the deposition of bimetals (Ni–Cu) inside the pores of the support. Every single material displayed standard type IV isotherms by having an H1-type hysteresis loop based on the IUPAC definition, which was the normal characteristic of uniformly arranged mesoporous materials alongside narrow pore-size distribution. For SBA-16, 5Ni–8Cu/SBA-16 and 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalysts and 0.50 to 0.80 for 5Ni–10Cu/SBA-16 and 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalysts, the adsorption-desorption branches had been situated at relative pressures within the range between 0.55 and 0.85.The sharp rise in the nitrogen adsorbed amount is a special characteristic of capillary condensation in mesoporous materials [27,28]. The samples pore size distributions had been calculated by the BJH technique, showing a narrow pore distribution within the selection of 15–20 nm for bimetallic loaded SBA-16 catalysts and 15–38 nm by pure SBA-16 sample. 3.1.3 Scanning electron microscopy and high resolution electron microscopy studies(HR-SEM) The SBA-16 and 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16samples SEM images are displayed in Fig. 4 a and b. The SEM images clearly suggest that the SBA-16 sample (Fig. 4a) showed a uniform circular slab-like morphology and the circular micro-blocks of approximately 3.7–4.0 μm in length without agglomeration. However, the morphology of the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 sample showed almost uniform peanut-like morphology, and the size of the micro-blocks of about 1.5–2.0 μm in length without agglomeration(Fig. 4b). However, each individual micro-blocks are composed of densely-populated nanocrystals, which is confirmed by XRD and TEM analysis. A clear cubic and equidistant arrangement of consistent pores were noticed after the electron beam was parallel to the mesopores main axis, ensuring a highly ordered arrangement (Fig. 5 a). This arrangement gives beneficial characteristics of the sample, for instance, high surface area, uniform distribution of pore size, well-defined pore size, and thermal stability. When Ni–Cu is deposited on SBA-16, the orderliness of the pores is reduced, and in addition, the Ni–Cu metal deposits have been noticed (Fig. 5b). The TEM image of 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 sample displays the existence of Ni–Cu particles with a size range of 40–70 nm, showing a relatively effective dispersion of the metal in the support (Fig. 5b). The TEM image of 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst after hydrogenation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural reaction is shown in Fig. 5c.The surface of the material becomes dark, and the Ni–Cu particles are not clearly seen, which might be due to the product 2,5-Methylfuran adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. 3.1.4 NH3 temperature programmed reduction investigation The surface acidity of bi-metallic supported Ni–Cu/SBA-16 catalysts with various proportions of Ni–Cu was investigated by the NH3-TPD analysis. In general, materials display three kinds of surface acidity, which are grouped as weak (<250 °C), moderate (250–350 °C), and strong (>350 °C) acidity depending on the desorption of ammonia in accordance with the temperature [21]. In the present study, we have used SBA-16 as support for bimetallic Ni–Cu catalysts. The amount of these acid sites might differ with the loading of Cu, according to Ni. The ammonia desorption profiles for Ni–Cu/SBA-16 (various proportions of Ni–Cu) catalysts were found to be very broad and is shown in Fig. 6 . All the samples showed a broad NH3-desorption peak starting from 130 °C to 750 °C and having many shoulder peaks ascribed to all three acidic sites (weak, medium, and strong). The intensity of maxima desorption (between 300 °C and 750 °C) increases with an increase in Cu loading resulted in the highest acidity. The increase in acidity with an increase in Cu loading may be attributed to the synergy between Ni and Cu [29]. The acid sites (medium and weak) can be increased by Cu loading function as active sites and can play an important role in catalytic hydrogenation of 5-HMF. Table 1 displays the total acidic sites of SBA-16 and Ni–Cu/SBA-16 samples. As stated before, the Ni–Cu/SBA-16 catalysts total acidity increased with proportions of Ni–Cu as 5Ni–8Cu/SBA-16, 5Ni–10Cu/SBA-16, 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16, and 5Ni–14Cu/SBA-16 catalysts contained 0.56, 0.64, 0.71, and 0.79 mmol/g cat respectively. 3.1.5 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) The reduction behavior of monometallic (Ni, Cu) and bimetallic Ni–Cu catalysts supported on SBA-16 has been analyzed by the H2-TPR technique, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . The calcined catalysts Cu/SBA-16 and Ni/SBA-16 showed the reduction peak for copper oxide and nickel oxide centered at 286 °C and 420 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7.The nickel oxide reduction peak matches with the reported literature for the bulk nickel oxide that occurred at 400–450 °C [30]. All the Ni(5)-Cu(x)/SBA-16 materials (where x = 8, 10, 12, 14 wt %) showed reduction peak between 230 and 600 °C. However, the bimetallic catalysts reduction peaks with the various Ni/Cu ratio shifted in the direction of lower temperature (190–240 °C), which might be a consequence of a strong interaction amongst nickel and copper atom [31]. It was also agreed with the earlier conclusion that the addition of Cu in Ni catalysts enhanced the reduction of nickel oxide. For bimetallic catalysts, the position of the highest hydrogen consumption peak is based on the Cu content, with greater Cu contents causing less reduction temperature. Also, in our results, the reduction of the bimetallic catalyst peaks shifted toward a lower temperature. Compared to other three catalytic systems, the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst's reduction peaks shifted more towards a lower temperature. The peak intensity comparatively higher attributed to synergistic reduction process of NiO and CuO occurred on the SBA-16 surface [32]. 3.1.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS spectrum was tested for 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 sample so as to get details regarding the metal oxide species chemical states and is shown in Fig. 8 .XPS results show that the surface of 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 is conformed only by Si, C, O, Ni, and Cu only. The existence of low carbon quantities corresponds to surface adventure carbon from the environment pollution and some residual carbon in the organic template following the thermal treatment of the supports synthesis, which is characterized by the slight asymmetry of the C1s peak at 285.34 eV [33].This confirms that the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 sample is without any contaminant or residual reagents employed in the process of sample preparation. The well-known characteristic orbital's Si, which is Si2p3 and Si2s, was located at around 104.2 and 152 eV, respectively. The presence of O1s orbital at 533.8 eV (strong spectral line) showed metal oxide forms (SiO2, NiO, and CuO) [34]. The spectra consist of two sharp peaks, which correspond to the Ni2p3/2–Ni2p1/2 spin-orbit doublet. The Ni2p3/2 binding energy for the Ni metal and NiO refers to the range of 852.4–853.0 and 854.5–854.6 eV, respectively. The sample 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 shows Ni2p3/2 binding energy peak at 855.9 eV and its satellite about 862.5 eV, which is characteristic of Ni2+ species due to surface oxidation of metallic Ni in the air. It is interestingly noted that the present BE value of Ni2+ species in the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 sample is larger than that reported in the literature (854.5–854.6 eV), indicating the formation of the strong metal oxide−support interactions [35]. According to the literature data [36], the Cu metal and Cu2O are characterized by the Cu2p3/2 binding energy in the range of 932.4–932.8 eV, while the binding energy for CuO is between 933.6 and 934.6 eV. In the fine Cu 2p spectrum of 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16, there are two obvious Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at 934.6 and 943.1 eV, respectively, indicating that Cu species exist in the form of CuO (Fig. 8). From XPS results, we conclude that Ni and Cu are in the oxide state. Hence, the metallic oxides were reduced to metallic states by passing H2 before starting every reaction."
8,"Influence of reaction parameters in the hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran","3.2 Influence of reaction parameters in the hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran 3.2.1 Ni/cu ratio A number of Ni(5)-Cu(x)/SBA-16 samples was synthesized to find out the ideal Ni/Cu ratio of the catalyst. These catalysts were tested in the hydrogenation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfual to 2,5-Dimethylfuran at 210 °C under 20 bar pressure for 4 h. The examined Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts displayed exceptional catalytic performance in the 5-HMF transformation, while the yield of DMF considerably differed with the various Ni/Cu ratios (Fig. 9 ). While the transformation of 5-HMF reached 99%, the lowest yield of DMF was noticed by the 5Ni–8Cu/SBA-16 catalyst. It is usually thought that by increasing the content of copper, better possibilities are there for the reactants to achieve additional active sites. As expected, the yield of DMF considerably increases with increasing Cu content from 8 to 12 wt%. But, further increasing the Cu content from 12 to 14 wt%, the yield of DMF decreases. The maximum DMF yield of 60.7% with 100% conversion was obtained over the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst. Excellent performance of 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 for 5-HMF hydrogenation could possibly be because of the combined outcome of excellent dispersion of Cu and Ni nanoparticles on the SBA-16surface, and the synergistic effect between nickel and copper species in hydrogenation mechanism, which makes it extremely efficient as well as the selective catalyst for 5-HMF hydrogenation [37]. The primary factor of activity of Cu and Ni could be known a connection between the surface of Cu and Ni and the furanic ring of 5-HMF by which –CO functional group of furan ring is bonded to Cu and Ni surface through both of its carbon and oxygen atoms that results in the η2 intermediate formation [38,39]. The hydrogenation route is enhanced by the formation of this η2 intermediate. The nickel reducing ability can be improved by the copper addition and prevents the deactivation as a result of the coke formation and the reaction of hydrogenation. Furthermore, the carbon deposition was prevented due to the edge position is occupied by copper, which is the preferred location for nickel atoms and carbon deposition. Hence, catalyst deactivation was minimized and promote the conversion of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfual [40,41]. More recently, Zheng et al. employed Ni–Cu catalysts on pyrolysis of oleic acid and found nickel promoted conversion and decreases coke formation [42]. However, all the three other catalysts showed performance inferior to that of the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst, and the order of activity among them was found to be 5Ni–14Cu/SBA-16 > 5Ni–10Cu/SBA-16 >5Ni–8Cu/SBA-16. Based on the above results, the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 was chosen as the best catalyst and was used in further studies presented below. 3.2.2 Reaction time Fig. 10 displays the 5-Hydroxymethylfurfual conversion and the 2,5-Dimethylfuran selectivity by employing a number of Ni(5)-Cu(x)/SBA-16 catalysts at different reaction times. We observed that the reaction continued for a minimum of 71% of the complete conversion of 5-HMF in just 30 min. The 5-Hydroxymethylfurfual initial conversion is continuously improved by increasing the reaction time from 1 h to 4 h and attained the highest conversion of 100%. After the reaction time of 4 h, the yield of DMF reaches 65%. However, the yield of DMF continued to be constant even after 6 h reaction time. We found that 97% 5-HMF was converted in the initial 3 h with the DMF yield of 60.7%. However, prolonging the reaction time to 6 h, no significant changes in the yield of DMF was observed. This might be due to the 5-HMF almost totally converted within 3 h, and also other products such as MFA and MF are stable even after prolonged reaction time. The MFA and MF are intermediate species that can form to DMF, which are consistent with earlier reported literature [43–45]. However, 5-methylfurfurylalcohol (MFA) and 5-methylfurfural (MF) might be converted into (5-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl) methanol and 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and polymerization of products facilitated in the longer reaction time, which was stated by Chen et al. [46].The same trend also followed on the 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural hydrogenolysis reaction catalyzed by copper‐cobalt catalysts carried out by srivastavaet al. But, it required longer reaction time (8h) to achieve maximum yield of 78% [47]. It was determined from Fig. 10 the 4 h is the ideal reaction time for obtaining the optimum conversion of HMF and the yield of DMF. 3.2.3 Temperature The reaction temperature positively influences the conversion of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfual. The influence of temperature in the conversion of 5-HMF and selectivity of DMF and other products in the temperature between 150 and 230 °C is displayed in Fig. 11 . The low HMF conversion (45%) and DMF yield (22%) was observed when the reaction performed at a low temperature (150 °C). Even at low temperatures, the major product was DMF only. The lower conversion of 5-HMF at 150 °C is due to the poor hydrogen production capacity of the catalyst at the relatively low reaction temperature [32]. Further increasing reaction temperature to 170 °C, the 5-HMF conversion was considerably increased to 64.6% with 32.8%yield to DMF. Thus, high temperature improved the reaction once the temperature was elevated beyond 170 °C. As expected, the conversion of 5-HMF increases with increasing the reaction temperature from 170 to 190 °C as well as 190–210 °C. On the other hand, the yield of DMF also increases. The 5-HMF conversion reaches a maximum of 100% with a DMF yield of 60.7% at 210 °C. Further increasing of reaction temperature(230 °C), no considerable changes in the conversion observed. On the other hand, the selectivity of DMF decreases. This might be due to the increase in the reaction rate due to the cracking of the C = O bond facilitated by the NiCu bimetallic catalysts at higher temperature, which leads to the increased activity of the hydrogen molecule in the reaction mixture [48,49]. Increasing the reaction temperature beyond (230 °C), results in the formation of over hydrogenolysis products and as a result the DMF yield reduced [47]. Thus, the ideal reaction temperature was 210 °C, and additional investigations were performed only at that temperature. It should be noted that the yield of 5MFA and 2 MF increases along with DMF. The results indicate that the cleavage of C–O bond in the 5-HMF molecule can be simply carried out at high temperatures. 3.2.4 Hydrogen pressure and reaction mechanism The biomolecules hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation reactions can be accelerated by the presence of high pressure H2 [49]. Fig. 12 shows the results of the effect of H2 pressure at 230 °C on 5-HMF conversion and the yield of DMF. At a lower hydrogen pressure (5 bar) the DMF yield was only 42% with 80% conversion of 5-HMF. The conversion of 5-HMF increased to 85% and 92% with 49% and 53% yield of DMF when the hydrogen pressure increased from 5 bar to 10 bar and 15 bar. With further increase in H2 pressure up to 20 bar, the yield of DMF enhanced to 60.7% with complete conversion of 5-HMF at 210 °C. Still, higher H2 pressures of 25 bar favored further ring hydrogenation producing by-products at the cost of reduced selectivity to DMF of 54% as well as a decrease in 5-HMF conversion to 93%. This is due to the solubility of H2 increases with increasing pressure in the reaction medium. But, when the pressure increased to 25 bar pressure, greater proportion of hydrogen chemisorbed at the catalyst surface and convert DMF into hydrogenolysis products as a result DMF selectivity decreases [47]. Considering the 5-HMF conversion and the DMF selectivity comprehensively, 20 bar is advisable. Possible reaction network of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural hydrogenation over 5Ni-xCu/SBA-16 has been proposed based on our experimental results shown in Scheme 1 . The reactant HMF was adsorbed via a CO bond on the coordinative unsaturated sites of Ni2+ from NiO species, and then, different hydrogenated products are formed via the attacking of hydrogen atoms on the aldehyde (CO) group, and CC in the furan ring takes place [32]. The reaction initiated by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of HMF leads to the formation of 5-Methylfurfural (MF) with the removal of water. The formed 5-methyl furfural undergoes further hydrogenation of aldehyde group (CO) of MF leads to generate 5-Methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFA). Hydrogenation of MFA facilitates the formation of 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) as a major product. At higher hydrogen pressure beyond 25 bar, ring hydrogenation (furan ring hydrogenation) of DMF takes place, which yields 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) as a by-product. The optimum loading of 12 wt% of Cu on 5 wt% Ni/SBA-16 facilitated to perform better hydrogenation of HMF, compared to other catalysts. The catalyst also possesses a comparatively high amount of DMF yield (%) than other catalysts, which implies that the optimum loading is highly favourable for generating a large number of active sites and acid sites supported by BET and TPD results. In addition to that, the ease of reducibility of Ni and Cu on the support. Overall, the structure of the 5Ni-12-Cu/SBA-16 is responsible for the better hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathway for the generation of a high yield of DMF as a major product. Table 2 displays comparison results of hydrogenation of HMF using 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst with previously published catalysts. This result demonstrated that the catalyst showed comparable yield of DMF under optimized reaction condition. 3.2.5 Catalyst recyclability Testing for reuse of catalysts is extremely significant for industry-related applications. The catalyst can be deactivated by the following reasons, such as thermal, mechanical, and chemical [55]. The performance of the regenerated catalysts decreases may be as a result of the products, reactants, or byproducts strongly chemisorbed in the catalytic active sites [56]. Developing a regenerative technique for the deactivated catalyst is highly significant from the point of view of the overall costs of the process. For this reason, the recyclability and stability of the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst were assessed under 5 reaction cycles under optimized conditions, and the results are presented in Fig. 13 . After each cycle ends, the catalyst was separated from the reaction system by centrifugation followed by washing with new THF and used directly under similar conditions for the next cycle. The fresh catalyst showed a 100% conversion and a 63% DMF yield. The used catalyst continues to possess high catalytic performance, and it offers more than 85% product conversion and 58% DMF yield after five cycles. It is noted that only a slight decline in the DMF selectivity is observed. Therefore, little losses in the HMF conversion as well as the yield of DMF are observed after five recycles. The present investigation demonstrates that the 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst is well suited for commercial application in the conversion of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-Dimethylfuran."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, 5 wt% Ni loaded Cu(x) (where x = 8,10,12 &14%) catalysts supported on SBA-16 have been prepared successfully by incipient wetness impregnation method. The XRD patterns and BET results indicated that of the crystallinity, high surface and mesoporosity, and well dispersion of Ni and Cu on 5Ni-12-Cu/SBA-16 catalysts The acidic and low-temperature reduction properties of the Ni catalyst on the support is enhanced by optimum loading of the Cu content (12%), which is verified by TPD and TPR. The results of the XPS analysis show that the Ni and Cu species are in the oxide states. Selective hydrogenation of 5-HMF to DMF was successfully achieved over a highly efficient 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst, showing the complete conversion of 5-HMF with a considerable yield of DMF in 4 h, 210 °C and 20 bar hydrogen pressure. The 5Ni–12Cu/SBA-16 catalyst showed better recycling performance and stability and recycled until 4 times. The results thus propose that the Ni–Cu/SBA-16 catalysts have various potential applications in the biomass transformation reactions."
