0,Introduction,"S. aureus is an opportunistic Gram-positive bacterium initially identified by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur [1]. S. aureus forms golden colonies which mostly colonize human anterior nares and skin, and play a pathogenic role (e.g. impetigo, pimples, cellulitis, and abscesses) [2–4]. The emergence of opportunistic pathogens is mainly explained by natural resistance of antibiotics including beta-lactams such as cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides [4]. CFX, a first generation cephalosporin belonging to the broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics which inhibit cell wall synthesis, is a hydrophilic drug with an in-vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1–2 μg/mL, a pronounced oral absorption and high bioavailability compared to other members of its group [5]. CFX is widely and frequently used to fight mild to moderate infections of soft tissues like skin, upper respiratory tract and urinary tract in the daily dose of 500–2000 mg/day (i.e. up to 30 mg/kg/day orally administrated for an adult of 70 Kg) [6]. Nevertheless, a significant increase of cephalosporin-resistant S. aureus strains has been reported in Pakistan [7,8]. Hence, to overcome this issue and better manage staph infections in developing countries, efficient and biocompatible antibiotic delivery systems are urgently required. Interestingly, polymeric NFs are gaining significant attention as promising therapeutic nanocarriers due to their impressive capacity of surpassing bacterial resistance and low drug solubility, enhancing loading capacity, antibiotic bioavailability and therapeutic response, improving drug (e.g. antibiotic) release over time, thereby reducing side effects (e.g. systemic toxicity) [9–14]. Moreover, electrospun NFs are a new generation material that possess unique features including efficiency (in diverse and advanced applications such as wound dressings, drug and gene delivery), biocompatibility (to overcome problems related to the necessity of a second surgery to remove implants), adhesiveness, sterile nature, tunable porosity and high surface area-to-volume (to offer maximum antibiotic payload capacity and encapsulation efficiency), use of common routes for drug administration (e.g. ocular, vaginal, transdermal, rectal, nasal and oral), easy functionalization with biological molecules (for a controlled targeted/smart drug delivery) [9,10,15–22]. NFs can be fabricated either from natural polymers (e.g. nucleic acids; proteins such as gelatin, collagen, fibrinogen, silk, or wheat protein; polysaccharides such as chitosan, dextran, or hyaluronic acid) [23–35] and/or from synthetic polymers (e.g. PVA, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PU), poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) (PEVA), poly(l-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLLA-CL), or poly(ethylene oxyde) (PEO)) [12,36–53]. For instance, CS is a natural polycationic linear polysaccharide derived from partial deacetylation (DA) of chitin – an important structural molecule found in arthropods such as insects and crabs, and the second most occurring polysaccharide after cellulose [31,33,54]. The molecular weight (MW) and degree of DA (DDA) of CS mainly depends on the source of chitin and hydrolysis methods [31,33]. DDA and acetyl group distribution in the polymer chains impact the physical properties of CS in aqueous solution (i.e. decreased solubility and increased aggregation) [54]. Moreover, contrarily to electrospinning process of pure CS in acetic acid [32,33], low solubility occurred in neutral and alkaline solutions which induced its spinability, entanglement, and hindered its applicability [33]. Also, pure CS NFs are physically fragile and prone to swelling if not blended with a synthetic polymer (e.g. PVA) [12,37,38] using one of the available fabrication techniques (e.g. electrospinning, freeze drying, drawing, template synthesis, phase separation, or self-assembly) [12,16,36–41]. Indeed, the transformation of CS into derivatives or composites increases its solubility and stability and thus makes it more versatile as a biopolymer [54]. The stabilization between a natural (e.g. CS) and a synthetic polymer (e.g. PVA) can be further enhanced by physical [55,56] (e.g. temperature, radiations) or chemical cross-linking [56,57]. Although cross-linking by chemical agents, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) [56] or glutaraldehyde (GA) [57], allows permanent junction-induced mechanical strength, it is not an eco-friendly concept and requires several washes to minimize the chemical induced-cytotoxicity [56]. Importantly, the inherent antimicrobial activity of CS along with its biodegradability, biocompatibility, low allergenicity, high-permeability, wound healing, hemostatic, cost-effectiveness and non-toxicity properties, represent a valuable asset in pipeline development of drug delivery systems [38,54]. Besides, PVA is a major artificial polymer for which much attention has been given not only because it enhances the mechanical properties of CS NFs [12] but also because it represents a non-toxic, water permeable, biodegradable and biocompatible synthetic polymer with great electrospinnability for numerous biomedical applications (e.g. development of efficient antibiotic release systems) [39,41,56–61]. Thereby, PVA and CS cumulate interesting features for the development of advanced and safe materials for drug delivery, wound healing and tissue engineering [39,41,56,59–61], although most studies reported the preparation of CPNFs without complete physicochemical and/or biological (e.g. cell behavior) characterizations [60]. Importantly, electrospinning is the main method of choice [16–30,32–35,37–39,44,47,50–52,55,59–64] for the large scale production of NFs – especially from polymer blends – due to its controllable diameter, easy handling, great flexibility for selecting diverse therapeutic molecules, minimum consumption of solution and cost effectiveness [16]. It is a unique and versatile technique that applies electrostatic repulsion between surface charges to constantly draw NFs from viscoelastic fluids [16]. This promising technology uses various processing parameters (e.g. applied electric field/voltage, flow rate of polymer, effect of collector and capillary to collector distance) and solution characteristics (e.g. polymer concentration, volatility of solvent and solvent conductivity) for efficient loading, release and accumulation of the therapeutics into the target site [16,59–64]. Eventually, in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that electrospun (composite) NF scaffolds can enhance both the bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities of antibiotics [16]. Indeed, in a recent study, electrospun CPNFs loaded with antibiotics showed an optimal nanofibrous structure (i.e. that most similar to natural tissue) at the volumetric ratio CS/PVA of 50:50 and a great potential to be used for infection related wound dressing for skin tissue regeneration [59]. In another recent study, different volume ratios (30:70, 50:50, and 70:30) of electrospun CS/PVA blend solutions in acetic acid 70% showed that the best nanofibrous mat was achieved at the volumetric ratio 30:70 which enabled the attachment and proliferation of dermal fibroblast cells [60]. Therefore, this pioneered study aimed to develop a cost-effective, safe and more efficient antimicrobial delivery system than the free CFX by (i) fabricating a quick, simple, and green electrospun CFX loaded-CPNFs at the optimal volumetric CS/PVA ratio, (ii) determining their major physicochemical characteristics, (iv) assessing their cell behavior characteristics ex vivo to ensure their safety and in vitro to evaluate their antibacterial activity against (resistant) clinical isolates of S. aureus."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and instruments,"2.1 Reagents and instruments PVA (range of MW: 146–186 kDa, hydrolysis degree (HD): 87–89%) and acetic acid (99.5%) were purchased from Daejung Company Ltd., Korea. CS (range of MW: 300–500 kDa), DDA (≥75% with respect to the parent chitin), as well as Muller-Hinton agar (MHA), Muller-Hinton broth (MHB), nutrient agar (NA) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Korea. CFX was offered from Bio-Labs Pharmaceutical, Pakistan. S. aureus strains and primary cultures of human epidermal keratinocytes were kindly obtained from hospital wards. Thermostatic incubator (model: DHP-9052), high-speed refrigerated centrifuge (model: TGL20MC), and multifrequency ultrasonic cleaning machine (model: NB-600 DTY) were all purchased from Zhengzhou Nanbei Instrument Equipment Co. Ltd., China. Sample stirring and heating were carried out with a heating magnetic stirrer (model: IKA-RCT-B) purchased from IKA group, China. Microplate reader (model: Infinite 200 Pro) was purchased from Tecan Trading AG., Switzerland. Thermogravimeter (model: Thermo-plus TG 8120) was purchased from Rigaku Corp., Japan. SEM Quanta 450 FEG was purchased from Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc., USA. FT/IR-4100 type A spectroscope was purchased from JASCO Inc., USA. UV-Vis spectrophotometer (model: Lambda 950) was purchased from PerkinElmer, UK."
3,Green preparation of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"2.2 Green preparation of CFX-loaded CPNFs CPNFs were fabricated by electrospinning technology (Fig. 1 ) following a process under sterile conditions and without the use of toxic or hazardous solvents (Fig. 2 ). Indeed, the only solvent we employed is acetic acid (AA), which is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and drug Administration (US FDA, 21CFR184.1005) and further exempted from the requirement of a tolerance under the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) [65]. Briefly, CS (1–5% w/v) was dissolved in AA (90% v/v) under continuous stirring at 50 °C (Solution 1) for 2 h and blended with PVA powder (5–9% w/v) which was dissolved in distilled water (D/W) under continuous magnetic stirring for 5 h at 80 °C (near to its boiling point) to facilitate complete dissolution and stability of the blend (i.e thermal cross-link). CFX (2% w/v) was then loaded (Solution 2). Alternatively, blank CPNFs represented the unloaded solution which was used as control (Solution 3). No chemical cross-linked agent was used. CS/PVA (CP) solutions were homogenized at different volumetric ratios, i.e. 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50 (v/v), under continuous magnetic stirring for 30 min at 340 rpm and room temperature (RT). We retained the optimized ratio 30:70 (CS/PVA) based on our experimental observations which corroborated previous studies [12,41,60]. To further ensure the highest level of fiber diameter uniformity and reproducibility, electrospinning was carried out under constant process parameters and controlled atmospheric conditions. Indeed, each prepared CP solution was transferred into a 5-ml syringe with a blunt-end 22 G needle. The solution was ejected at a feeding/flow rate of 1 mL/hr using an infusion pump (NE-300, New Era Pump Systems Inc., USA). The distance between the needle tips to the grounded aluminum collector was kept constant at 14 cm. A high voltage of 30 kV was applied to the needle. The relative humidity of the room was in the range of 50–60%. The resulting fibers were washed several times with D/W to carefully remove any remaining amount of AA, dried overnight and stored in a desiccator prior to analysis. Based on pH measurements and FTIR analyses, no evidence of impurities or residual solvent were noticed in electrospun CPNFs resuspended in D/W."
4,Determination of loading capacity and entrapment efficiency of CFX into CPNFs,"2.3 Determination of loading capacity and entrapment efficiency of CFX into CPNFs Weight amount of CFX-loaded CPNFs (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of D/W to form the solution. After 24 h, a 1:10 dilution of the solution was made (in D/W) and analyzed for total CFX content by spectrophotometry at the wavelength of 263 nm (UV) using a standard curve. Percent (%) CFX loading capacity (LC) and CFX entrapment/encapsulation efficiency (EE) were, respectively, calculated by the following equations [74]: LC % = Amount of CFX in NFs Weight of NFs * 100 where, Amount of CFX in the NFs = 1.03 mg Weight (amount) of the NFs = 10 mg EE % = Amount of CFX in NFs Total Weight of CFX added * 100 where, Amount of CFX in the NFs = 1.03 mg Total Weight of CFX added into NFs (amount of initial CFX) = 2 mg"
5,Stability studies of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"2.4 Stability studies of CFX-loaded CPNFs Thermal stability of CFX loaded-CPNFs, blank CPNFs and free CFX was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA examines the relationship between one or more predictors (independent variables) and a response variable (dependent variable), with the goal of defining a “ best fit” model of the relationship. TGA permitted to measure temperature-induced mass changes and confirm the loading of CFX into CPNFs. TGA scans were carried out at heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere at purge rate of 30 mL/min, from 0 to 1400 °C. The curve fitting was performed by using Origin Pro 8.0. The following parameters were reported: (i) the temperature corresponding to 10% weight loss (WL T10%), (ii) temperature at maximum decomposition rate (Tmax), (iii) weight loss associated with Tmax (WL Tmax), (iv) the residual weight (RW) associated with maximum WL (WLmax). Further, the thermal stability of CFX loaded-CPNFs, blank CPNFs and free CFX was also carried out for 20 days in oven at one of three classical storage temperatures, i.e. 25 °C, 37 °C, or 60 °C."
6,SEM and FTIR characterizations of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"2.5 SEM and FTIR characterizations of CFX-loaded CPNFs High-resolution imaging of surface morphology and microstructure of the synthesized samples were evaluated using SEM. Thereby, CFX-loaded CPNFs were subjected to SEM measurements, comparatively to blank CPNFs used as control, using 1/1 cm samples coated with a thin layer of gold by sputtering (Emitech K450X, Ashford, UK) following a method previously published [42]. This coating is commonly required to obtain a clear micrograph of an insulating material, although it is so thin (200 Å) that it does not hinder the identification of specific minerals [56]. Their morphologies, including average diameters [39,66], were then assessed under a scanning electron microscope that operated at the acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Image analysis program ImageJ (US National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD), which uses grayscale level processing based on image structure, was used to characterize the SEM micrographs in the original magnification of 25×. The presence of specific functional chemical groups and their structural interactions in fabricated samples were examined by FTIR spectroscopy analysis following a method previously described [56]. CFX-loaded CPNFs and controls (blank CPNFs and free CFX) were separately milled and mixed at a ratio of 1.0% to KBr powder (infrared grade) dried for 24 h at 120 °C. They were pelletized under vacuum. Then, pellets between 500 and 4000 cm−1 were analyzed, with 120 scans averaging 4 cm−1 resolution, at a scanning speed of 2 mm/s."
7,Drug’s release behavior of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"2.6 Drug’s release behavior of CFX-loaded CPNFs Drug’s release behavior of CFX-loaded CPNFs was characterized, comparatively to blank free CFX, by UV-Vis Spectrometry following absorbance of the samples at the wavelength of 229 nm and 263 nm. Briefly, prepared CPNFs and free CFX were placed separately inside a dialysis bag (i.e. semi-permeable film) which was pre-filled with 5 mL of PBS (pH 7.4, 37 °C) to “mimic” the human body/physiological conditions. Then, the respective dialysis bags were hanged inside a beaker containing 20 mL of the same buffer. A continuous magnetic stirring was eventually applied with a constant rate of around 200 rpm at controlled temperature. At indicated times ranging from 0 to 800 min (~13 h), 3 mL of the beaker solution was removed and stocked for subsequent absorption measurement. Immediately after removing each sample, 3 mL of the same buffer thermostated at 37 °C was added to the beaker solution in order to maintain the initial volume (20 mL). Eventually, the degree of drug release from the analysis bag method was calculated using a plotted standard curve. Non-linear regression fitting curve fitting were then used to get the parameters and their uncertainties. This way, release kinetics of CFX from CFX-loaded CPNFs was described using Korsmeyer-Peppas’method [67–70], following this equation: M t M ∞ = Kt n where, Mt is the cumulative amount of drug released at time t, M∞ is the initial drug loading, K is a constant characteristic of the drug-polymer system, and n is the diffusion exponent suggesting the nature of release mechanism. n was 0.513 in case of CFX-loaded CPNFs."
8,Ex vivo cytotoxicity of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"2.7 Ex vivo cytotoxicity of CFX-loaded CPNFs The potential cytotoxicity (i.e. alteration of the cell’s metabolic activity) of CFX-loaded CPNFs versus free CFX was tested on primary cultures of proliferating human epidermal keratinocytes using MTT assay as previously reported [71]. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells per well keratinocytes were cultured in 96-well plates containing 90% DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were further incubated for 24 h in DMEM media containing either CFX-loaded CPNFs or free CFX, using concentrations ranging from 0 to 32 µg/mL (i.e. 0 µg/mL; 0.5 µg/mL; 1 µg/mL; 2 µg/mL; 4 µg/mL; 8 µg/mL; 16 µg/mL; 32 µg/mL). Blank CPNFs and D/W were used as internal and external controls, respectively. Eventually, the cells were washed with PBS 1X, and treated with MTT 30 µL (5 mg/mL) for 4 h. Finally, DMSO (150 µL) was added into the cells to dissolve the formazan crystals, and a muti-mode microplate reader was applied to measure the absorption at 490 nm in each well. The absorption was directly related to the number of viable cells. The percentage viability of keratinocytes was calculated as follows: % of keratinocytes viability = Absorption of sample Absorption of control * 100"
9,In vitro antibacterial activity of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"2.8 In vitro antibacterial activity of CFX-loaded CPNFs The antibacterial effect of CFX-loaded CPNFs was examined in vitro against clinical strains of S. aureus (n = 10, numbered S.a 1 to S.a 10), using agar well diffusion method (aka Kirby–Bauer test) and MTT assay [71,72], once the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the unloaded antimicrobial agent (i.e. free CFX) was determined [73]. Thereby, the sensitivity of the clinical isolates of S. aureus to free CFX was done by serial dilution method to determine MIC. Briefly, serial dilutions of CFX solution were prepared in MHB medium and the final concentration of CFX in the prepared tubes were 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 μg/mL. The tubes then received 10 μL of bacterial inoculums containing 1 × 106 CFU/mL. The inoculated tubes were eventually incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration (8 μg/mL) showing no growth represented the MIC, which was used for subsequent agar well diffusion and MTT experiments. To determine the zone of inhibition (ZOI) of CFX-loaded CPNFs by agar well diffusion assay, MHA was first prepared according to the manufacturer specifications, sterilized at 250°F (121 °C) for 15–20 min at 15 psi (100 kPa) pressure and poured into Petri plates. Then, the bacterial suspension, matching with 0.5 McFarland standards, was spread on Petri plates via sterile cotton swab. Subsequently, 18 mm wells were made and sealed. Suspensions of CFX-loaded CPNFs, blank CPNFs (internal control 1), free CFX (external control 1), or sterilized D/W (external control 2) were added to each well separately. Eventually, the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C before the plates were examined and the ZOIs recorded. Further, the effect of CFX-loaded CPNFs on bacterial cell viability was examined by MTT assay. S. aureus strains were cultured on MHA, and after incubation overnight at 37 °C, a bacterial suspension (10 μL) of each strain containing 5 × 105 colony forming units (CFUs) was prepared in sterilized D/W by comparing with 0.5 McFarland (turbidity) standards against black and white background. The bacterial suspension was added to each well of the 96-well plate containing MHB (100 μL). Then, suspensions of CFX-loaded CPNFs, blank CPNFs, free CFX, or sterilized D/W were added to each well separately. The microplate was incubated for 12 h at 37 °C, before 10 μL of MTT reagent (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and the microplate further incubated for 1 h. S. aureus reduced the MTT to purple color formazan. The formazan ring was dissolved by adding 120 μL isopropanol, and the production of formazan in each sample was quantified by measuring its absorption at 560 nm using a multiplate reader. The absorption was directly related to the number of viable bacterial cells. The percentage viability of S. aureus was calculated as follows: % of bacterial cells viability = Absorption of sample Absorption of control * 100 where, sample = CPNFs or CFX control = D/W"
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis Each experiment was reproduced thrice independently following the same protocol to ensure the consistency of the data. The values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The statistical significance of the differences in each experiment was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a least significant difference (LSD) post hoc test. The significance level was set at p < 0.05."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Green preparation of electrospun CFX-loaded CPNFs,"3.1 Green preparation of electrospun CFX-loaded CPNFs The broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic CFX is particularly used in developing countries to fight skin infections [6] and a significant increase of cephalosporin-resistant S. aureus strains has been reported in Pakistan [7,8]. Hence, we sought to develop a new biocompatible drug delivery system that may have potential for efficient antibiotic release using common routes for drug administration (e.g. Per Os, transdermally) [16] and so can be not only used orally but also as wound dressing materials (e.g. gauze mats) [61]. CS/PVA polymer blends at different volumetric ratios, loaded (or not) with CFX antibiotic, were successfully fabricated by electrospinning. Indeed, CS dissolved in AA was blended with PVA aqueous solution at different volumetric ratios i.e. 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50 (v/v) in order to sterilely fabricate, without the aid of any chemical cross-linking agent, biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and antibacterial electrospun CPNFs. Several thorough washings of electrospun CPNFs with D/W were performed followed by pH-metry and FTIR checking to ensure absence or minimal presence of impurities or residual solvent. Comparatively to other NF fabrication processes, electrospinning is versatile and superior in production and construction of ordered or more complex nanofibrous assemblies [55,59–61,82]. Indeed, electrospun NFs are a new generation material that possess unique features (e.g. efficiency, biocompatibility, tunable porosity and high surface area-to-volume to offer maximum antibiotic payload capacity and encapsulation efficiency, functionalization for a controlled targeted/smart antibiotic delivery) [9,10,15–22]. Also, to ensure the highest level of fiber diameter uniformity, optimal nanofibrous structure and reproducibility, electrospinning was eventually carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions, i.e. at RT with RH of 50–60%. In this regards, we noticed that the most proper CS/PVA volumetric ratio to be retained for electrospinning was 30:70 which confirmed previous studies that reported the morphological, mechanical/stability, swelling and safe properties of CPNFs at such ratio [12,41,60,74]. The selected CPNFs (10 mg) were then loaded with CFX (2 mg). The CPNFs’ LC and EE of the drug was 10.3% and 51.5%, respectively. These data would mean that the maximum (100%) possible drug amount to be loaded into 10 mg CPNFs is 19.40 mg. Also, these data appear acceptable when compared to other studies reporting other compound(s)-loading CPNFs [74,75], keeping in mind that the current daily dose of free CFX is about 30 mg/kg/day [6]. For instance, in a recent study [74] that aimed to develop curcumin-loaded electrospun CPNFs, EE and LC were about 76.4% and 4.6%, respectively. It would be then worthy to investigate whether CS with MW below 300 kDa could improve the LC and EE in CFX-loaded CPNFs. Interestingly, c and significantly decreased with increasing the GA concentration. This report supports the fabrication of electrospun CPNFs without the use of a chemical cross-linking agent."
13,Thermal stability of CFX-CPNFs,"3.2 Thermal stability of CFX-CPNFs Thermal stability of CFX loaded-CPNFs was evaluated by TGA using blank CPNFs and free CFX as controls (Fig. 3 ). TGA scans were carried out at heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere at purge rate of 30 mL/min, from 0 to 1400 °C. Initially, WL T10% observed at 121.3 ± 1.3 °C for CFX loaded-CPNFs, blank CPNFs and free CFX is explained by the moisture vaporization. Tmax was observed at 610 ± 2.65 °C, 600 ± 3.51 °C and 540 ± 3.12 °C for CFX loaded-CPNFs, blank CPNFs and free CFX, respectively. WL Tmax of 25 ± 4.0%, 30 ± 3.5% and 42 ± 4.2% was observed for CFX loaded-CPNFs, blank CPNFs and free CFX, respectively. The significant difference (p < 0.05) between WL Tmax for CFX-loaded CPNFs and blank CPNFs was due to the CFX loading. At the end of analysis, CFX loaded-CPNFs, blank CPNFs and free CFX completely lost their respective water contents and showed RW at WLmax of 41 ± 1.2%, 35 ± 4.7% and 24 ± 2.02% for CFX loaded-CPNFs, blank CPNFs and free CFX, respectively. Comparatively, Santos et al. [76] reported TGA of CPNFs with a RW of 29.7 ± 0.5% (of the starting mass) at 900 °C, which corroborate our findings. Thus, free CFX showed significantly more thermal degradation (about 59 ± 0.51%, p < 0.05) compared to CFX-loaded CPNFs, which withstand at elevated temperatures. This can be explained, at least partially, by the fact that the heat stabilized nanofibrous mat CS/PVA 30:70 as previously described [60]. Further, the thermal stability of CFX-loaded CPNFs was carried out for 20 days in oven under three routine storage conditions, i.e. 25 °C, 37 °C, and 60 °C. Blank CPNFs and free CFX were used as controls. After the experimental time period, no macroscopically and statistically physical changes (p < 0.05) were observed under any of these temperatures for or between any of the samples group (Table 2 ). Taken together, our data indicate that CFX-loaded CPNFs are more thermostable than free CFX at drastic temperatures but that both products can be stored for at least 3 weeks up to 60 °C without expecting degradation that would negatively modify their efficacy and safety."
14,Physical characteristics of CFX-loaded CPNFs by SEM and FTIR,"3.3 Physical characteristics of CFX-loaded CPNFs by SEM and FTIR The synthesized composite nanofibers were evaluated by SEM at 10 kV. SEM micrographs at 25× magnification depicted with high-resolution surface morphology and microstructure of electrospun CFX-loaded CPNFs, which were compared to blank CPNFs used as control (Fig. 4 ). SEM images revealed that the volumetric ratio of CS/PVA electrospun scaffold at 30:70 achieved an optimal nanofibrous structure (i.e. thin fiber uniformity that is most similar to natural tissues) compared with other volumetric ratios (e.g. 10:30; 20:80; 40:60 or 50:50) (Fig. S1). This indicated that CS/PVA 30:70 electrospun scaffold has great potential to be used for infection related wound dressing for skin tissue regeneration [12,41,60]. The surfaces of both CFX-loaded and blank CPNFs, fabricated at volumetric ratio CS/PVA of 30:70, exhibited flat smooth surface, did not display an interface layer, appeared homogenous but pores were not visible at 25× magnification [39] and so, were not measured [66] (Fig. 4). The average diameter of CFX-loaded CPNFs was found to be 290 +/− 86 nm, which was about twice higher compared to that of blank CPNFs (168 +/− 42 nm). This significant difference (p < 0.05) in size may be attributed to drug loading induced-viscosity changes. Indeed, it has been reported, that in electrospinning, the loading of antibacterial entities (e.g. nanoparticles or drugs) can lead to viscosity changes, which subsequently induce alterations of the stress relaxation time and chain entanglement of the synthetic polymer (i.e. PVA), resulting in fibers with a variable average diameter [39]. Further, it was worth noting that decreased CS (or increased PVA) contents in electrospun blank CPNFs (e.g. CS/PVA 20:80 or 10:90 compared to that of CS/PVA 30:70) has caused an increase in the diameter of the NFs (Figs. 4 and S1). Conversely, increased CS (or decreased PVA) content in electrospun blank CPNFs (e.g. CS/PVA 40:60 compared to that of CS/PVA 30:70) has caused a decrease in the diameter of the NFs (Figs. 4 and S1). These observations can be explained by the fact that CFX and/or CS affected not only the viscosity of the blend while CS also could have modified the surface charge density, through its cationic polyelectrolytic property, which in turn increased the elongation force [39]. These overall SEM data are in agreement with several observations [12,39,41,60,74] including those made by Lin et al. and Ignatova et al. who investigated, with the purpose of drug-delivering and/or tissue engineering, a series of CS/PVA blend nanofibrous membranes at different ratios [77,78]. The composite NFs were subjected to further analysis by FTIR. FTIR spectroscopy was performed using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–500 cm−1 in order to assess the potential interaction sites between the polymer nanocomposite (CS/PVA) prepared at the volumetric ratio of 30:70 and the drug (CFX). The determination of the chemical groups of CS, PVA, electrospun CS/PVA blend, and free CFX was previously reported [39,85,86]. The FTIR spectrum of CFX-loaded CPNFs was then enlightened, for the first time, in comparison to the FTIR spectra of blank CPNFs and free CFX. As seen in Fig. 5 , a highly noticeable difference exists between types of CPNFs, not only in terms of spectral absorbance (higher after drug loading into CPNFs) but also in terms of the spectral pattern (slight shift of characteristic peaks), indicating that the bonding strongly occurred between the drug (Fig. S2) and the polymers (Fig. S3). The observed peak assignments are indicated in Table 3 . Briefly, the absorption band from 3450 to 3200 cm−1 is assigned to O-H and N-H stretching vibrations, and the band at 3301 cm−1 is specifically attributed to NH stretching vibration [39]; It is postulated that the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds occurs between the OH and NH groups in CS and the OH groups in PVA [39,81]. The band at 2926 cm−1 is associated with CH stretching vibration [39,80]. The peak at 2400 cm−1 can be attributed to NH2 group of CFX which formed hydrogen bond with OH group in CH2OH of CS [84,85]. The band at 1633 cm−1 can be attributed to CO stretching of the remaining acetate groups in PVA (saponification reaction) [41]. The peak at 1425 cm−1 is assigned to OH bending vibration [39]. The peak at 1066 cm−1, assigned to CO stretching and related to saccharide structure as a repeating unit of CS, shifted to a higher wavelength when the drug was loaded into the CS/PVA blend [39,79,83] which indicated another chemical interaction between CS and CFX. Besides, our FTIR data with electrospun blank CPNFs and free CFX are in good agreement with other FTIR studies [39,41,84,85]. Indeed, the FTIR spectrum of CPNFs displayed the characteristic peaks i.e. 1425 cm−1 (carboxylic acid group), 1555 cm−1 (amine/symmetric deformation of NH3+) and 1712 cm−1 (carboxylic acid dimers) found for PVA and CS [39,81]. Moreover, our data confirmed a good miscibility between CS and PVA when the blend is performed at the volumetric ratio 30:70 [39,60], strengthening our choice of this experimental condition in the present investigation. Besides, the FTIR spectrum for CFX showed characteristic peaks at 3470 cm−1 (stretching vibrations of the ‘free’ OH group of hydroxyphenyl), 3432 cm−1 (stretching vibration of NH of the amide group), 2400 cm−1 (amine), 1750 cm−1 (carbonyl group of the β-lactam ring), and 1680 cm−1 (stretching vibrations of the amide group) [85]. In general, the infrared spectra of cephalosporin antibiotics (which have a zwitterionic character) exhibit the characteristic band arising from stretching vibrations of the carbonyl group of the β-lactam ring [85]."
15,In vitro drug’s release behavior,"3.4 In vitro drug’s release behavior UV-Vis Spectrometry was used to evaluate the release profile of CFX from CPNFs, which helped to reveal the structure-function relationship of the electrospun CFX-loaded CPNFs in PBS (pH 7.4, 37 °C) during the time course of 800 min. The release behavior of free CFX was assessed as control. The cumulative release rate profiles, in the buffer solution of either free CFX or CFX from the CPNF samples, are plotted in Fig. 6 . The release rate for CFX-loaded CPNFs after 800 min (a bit more than a half-day) was 98.02% ± 1.02% whereas for free CFX it was already of 98.00 ± 1.0% after only 150 min. Free CFX was also released at 96 ± 1.20% within the first 20 min, which was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to that of CPNFs which released 90.37% ± 1.92% of the loaded drug. Burst release is a phenomenon commonly observed in delivery devices of different forms and compositions [83]. The burst effect may be favorable for certain indications or applications such as wound treatment and/or targeted delivery [43,86]. This in vitro release study, led in physiological-like conditions [83], showed that CPNFs had lower drug release rate and smaller amount of drug burst release compared to that of free CFX. According to release exponent “n”, which was found to be 0.513, the release of CFX from CPNFs occurred predominantly by diffusion following non-Fickian (anomalous) transport mechanism [67,68] (Table 1). This in vitro burst release of CFX from CFX-loaded CPNFs during the initial period of 20 min followed by a sustained antibiotic drug release profile in the next upcoming ~13 h fitted a zero order kinetics, which is most likely due to the hydrophilic nature of PVA [40]. These data are encouraging when compared to that of CFX-loaded poly(methylmethacrylate)‐poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PMMA‐PVP) microspheres from which CFX was released up to 10 h only [5]. In general, diffusion (Fickian-), erosion, and degradation are the most important mechanisms for drug transport from polymeric matrices [43]. Such zero order kinetics release profile was also observed in previous drug-delivery studies evaluating the behavior of a given encapsulated drug [12,21,43,69,70], including CFX [5]. Interestingly, drug release studies revealed that the cross-linked network structure could effectively reduce both the antibiotic (e.g. ampicillin sodium) release rate and its burst effect from electrospun CPNFs, following a Fickian diffusion [75]. Once more, these reports support the fabrication of electrospun CPNFs without the use of a chemical cross-linking agent. Taken together, our results showed a burst CFX release during the initial period of 20 min and then a sustained drug release profile observed in the next upcoming 13 h thanks to CPNFs [83]. Considering that the first criteria for developing an effective delivery system is to ensure the excess and sustained release of the encapsulated drug into the physiological environment [16], CFX-loaded CPNFs shall contribute to the tailoring of transdermal drug delivery systems (e.g. gauze mats) for optimal controlled CFX drug release. Our data also provide certain insights into the performance of the formulation in vivo, albeit our experiments were not performed in body fluids."
16,Ex vivo cytoprotective effect of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"3.5 Ex vivo cytoprotective effect of CFX-loaded CPNFs The potential cytotoxicity of a wide concentration range (i.e. 0 to 32 μg/mL) of CFX-loaded CPNFs was tested on primary cultures of proliferating human epidermal keratinocytes using MTT assay (Fig. 7 ). Blank CPNFs, free CFX and D/W were used as controls. Keratinocytes were found, in a dose-independent manner, metabolically active (i.e. viable and proliferating) in the presence of CFX-loaded CPNFs, blank CPNFs and D/W while free CFX impaired the activity of the cells (92.47% ± 2.36) especially at 32 μg/mL (90.66% ± 0.44). The significantly higher (p < 0.05) viability of keratinocytes (average of 98.52% ± 0.45) in presence of CFX-loaded CPNFs is certainly due to the indirect exposure of the cells to the drug which is protected by the biocompatible polymers (Fig. 7). Indeed, recent studies reported the safety use of electrospun CPNFs and their high potential for tissue engineering [39] and improving the wound healing process [60,61,87]. In particular, a cell behavior study indicated that the heat stabilized nanofibrous mat CS/PVA 30:70 was able to support the attachment and proliferation of the fibroblast cells [60]. Taken together, these data revealed the non-toxic effect of CFX-loaded CPNFs in skin cells and would support their use as a new and promising efficient transdermal delivery system for stimulating the wound healing process and/or bacterial clearance."
17,In vitro antibacterial activity of CFX-loaded CPNFs,"3.6 In vitro antibacterial activity of CFX-loaded CPNFs After ensuring the safety and non-toxicity of CFX-loaded CPNFs through cytotoxic study, the antibacterial activity of CFX-loaded CPNFs was investigated by agar-well diffusion method (Figs. 8 and 9 ) and MTT (Fig. 10 ) at MIC (8 μg/mL) against different strains of S. aureus (n = 10). Blank CPNFs, free CFX solution, and D/W were used as controls. Importantly, among the isolated S. aureus strains (n = 16), only 1 (6.25%) strain showed susceptibly to CFX, while the remaining strains (94.75%) showed resistant against break point value of CFX which is 4 μg/mL according to EUCAST [88]. This finding is an affirmation of some other works from different part of the world and from Pakistan. For instance, Harris et al. reported 90% resistant strain of S. aureus to CFX [8]. The data obtained by agar-well diffusion indicate that CFX-loaded CPNFs exerted a greater antimicrobial activity against all the tested clinical S. aureus strains (n = 10) compared to the free drug (Figs. 8 and 9). Indeed, CFX-loaded CPNFs was active to all the tested strains and elicited at least 3 times more antibacterial activity in average compared to free CFX (p < 0.05), whereas inherent activity of blank CPNFs was even lower compared to free CFX (p < 0.05) (Fig. 9). Indeed, the ZOI averaged 15.11 ± 1.67 mm, 4.01 ± 1.15 mm and 1.4 ± 0.97 mm, for CFX-loaded CPNFs, free CFX, and blank CPNFs respectively (Figs. 8 and 9). As expected, ZOI was not detectable with D/W. Further, the effect of CFX-loaded CPNFs on bacterial cell viability examined by MTT assay was enhanced compared to that of free CFX (66.5 ± 3.2% versus 47.3 ± 4.0%) (Fig. 10). This can be explained by the fact that the negatively-charged microbial cell membranes have lost their integrity when they interact with positively-charged CS molecules, leading to cell lysis (i.e. alterations in cell wall permeability and leakage of intracellular compounds) [89]. Overall, such antimicrobial nanosystem is a promising strategy because of its substantially prolonged activities outside of drug resistance. In general, antibiotic-loaded NFs show moderate to strong antibacterial and antifungal activities by inhibiting cell wall synthesis (e.g. CFX [5]), protein synthesis, DNA/RNA synthesis, mycolic-acid synthesis, and/or folic acid synthesis [12,83]. A study carried out with ciprofloxacin (Cipro)-loaded CPNFs reported improved antibacterial activity of the carrier system compared to that of free Cipro when tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Candida albicans [12]. Interestingly, another recent study also showed an enhanced antibacterial effect using CFX-loaded CS nanoparticles (NPs) compared to that of free CFX, strongly suggesting that such nanosystem could be used to accelerate the wound healing process and bacterial clearance [73]. We conclude that (i) CFX-loaded CPNFs displayed enhanced antibacterial properties towards resistant S. aureus compared to that of free CFX, which means that such formulation may be administrated using a lower CFX dose which subsequently would reduce CFX side effects in vivo; (ii) the activity of CFX synergized with CPNFs; (iii) if the potent in vitro effect is safely reproduced in vivo, CFX-loaded CPNFs might be a valuable nano-delivery system (e.g. wound dressing material) to treat resistant S. aureus induced-skin infections. WHO recommends surveillance program for monitoring antibiotic resistance. The present study is a step in this direction."
18,Conclusions and perspectives,"The amount of antibiotic release and the effectiveness of its therapeutic window mainly depend on the nature of the carriers and the antibiotic loading efficiency in these carriers. Importantly, during the last two decades, electrospun nanofiber-based drug delivery systems have gained more consideration for controlled and sustained drug release. Indeed, sustained dosing frequency of antibiotics can result in fewer side effects, high patient compliance, minimization of antibiotics’ fluctuation level in the bloodstream and overcoming dose-dependent toxicity. In our study, the inherent antibacterial activity of electrospun biocompatible and stable CPNFs was largely enhanced against resistant strains of S. aureus once loaded with the broad-spectrum antibiotic CFX, demonstrating a synergistic effect. This promising data is explained by the excellent sustained drug release behavior of CFX-loaded CPNFs compared to free CFX. Therefore, electrospun CFX-loaded CPNFs system might be a very promising tool for wound healing and bacterial clearance applications. Ongoing research aims to test our formulation against a panel of bacterial and fungal species, develop CFX-loaded CPNFs in various dosage forms (e.g. cream, gel, gauzes), and assess their respective efficacy and toxicity in-vivo."
