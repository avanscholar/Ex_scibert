0,Introduction,"Biomaterials have, in recent years, become the focus of many studies in the field of energy conversion, and, due to environmental and energy security concerns, biodiesel demands have increased dramatically (Patchimpet et al., 2020). So, in the future, there will be an essential need for renewable fuels all over the world (Shirmohammadi et al., 2020a,b). Since biodiesel is of the few biomass energies that can be derived from different resources including vegetable and animal oil, it is of significant interest (Bhatia et al., 2020; Foroutan et al., 2020). Additionally, recent studies suggest that between 60% and 75% of expenses in many laboratories comes from raw materials, therefore, researchers have paid considerable attention to produce economic biofuels using wastes and renewable resources (Singh et al., 2020; Fereidooni and Pirkarami, 2019). This in mind, this study focuses on the specifics of how appropriate disposal of Waste Fried Oil (WFO) can promote sustainability via the production of Free Fatty Methyl Ester (FAME) (Guabiroba et al., 2017). Transesterification via electrolysis offers an attractive method to current industrial biodiesel production methods. The Japanese researchers, Guan and Kusakabe (2009), first used electrolysis for transesterification of waste cooking oil and corm oil in biodiesel production (Guan and Kusakabe, 2009). Putra et al. (2015) investigated the synthesis of FAME via electrolysis method. They utilized used cooking oil and 2 wt% DI water along with various mass ratios of chitosan as an organo–catalyst and NaCl as supporting electrolyte. NaCl increases the total concentration of ions in the electrolyte and hence reduces its resistance. Under these circumstances, the electrochemical reactions are enhanced as a result of facilitated electron transportation (Putra et al., 2015). In electrochemical hydroxide ions (OH–), methoxides obtained from methanol produces FAME from triglycerides (Sarno and Ponticorvo, 2020). Due to its shorter reaction time, high quality FAME production, low cost, simple reaction conditions and equipment, use of waste materials containing high fatty acids and water, and its reuse of resistant electrodes like graphite, electrolysis offers a fantastic alternative to current methods (Fereidooni et al., 2018b; Fereidooni and Mehrpooya, 2017). Just as a point of comparison, electrolytic transesterification can take place at only 25 °C and at atmospheric pressure, whereas a reaction under these conditions using conventional methods would likely reduce the fatty acid esters and negatively affect reaction conversion (Fereidooni et al., 2018b). Replacing homogenous catalysts by heterogeneous ones is the most challenging issue in order to solve problems including catalysts separation, saponification, by–products neutralization, corrosion of reactors, and quenching step (Salib et al., 2019). Similarly, the use of new and efficient heterogeneous catalysts has been of topic of recent interest (Nath et al., 2020). One pathway into the burgeoning field of heterogeneous catalysis is through Chitosan (C56H103N9O39) (Francis et al., 2019), a natural, non–toxic, biodegradable polymer which comprises several active functional groups such as hydroxyl and amino groups (Bano et al., 2017). Research has already been done to investigate the beneficial characteristics of chitosan such as its non–toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability in using it as a biomaterial, as this chitin derivative has been used in several products such as hydrogels, films, fibers or sponges (Zhang et al., 2017). Moreover, it has been reported that some changes in the structure of chitosan such as integration of zeolitic minerals can result in chelation with metal ions and zeolite as a porous material. Zeolites, which are crystalline aluminosilicates, is a common class of materials often used in heterogeneous catalysis, ion exchangers, nanotechnology and absorbents (Prinsen et al., 2018). This is mind, porous zeolite–chitosan composites have been reported to have a variety of applications and increasingly are being used for biomaterial applications due to their innate sustainability and reusability (Taaca and Vasquez, 2018). Using this biocomposite as a natural catalyst, new heights can be achieved in sustainable chemistry while maintaining the principles of environmental protection. This study explores electrolysis as a novel and highly efficient process to produce FAME from WFO. In this study, Na+ catalytic activity through zeolite and chitosan modification was used for biocomposite synthesis through transesterification. In spite of the interest in utilizing biomaterials as catalyst, little has been done to explore zeolite and chitosan as heterogeneous catalyst. Due to limited number of studies in this area, development of this zeolite–chitosan biocomposite has been restricted. As a result, developing a composite from biomaterials may advance the use of this composite in biodiesel production. Samples were analyzed using TEM, BET, SEM–EDX, FTIR and XRD to characterize the catalyst. Acid and saponification values of waste oil were determined using titration. This study also aims to provide an analysis of how key parameters such as substrate and applied voltage affect electrolysis performance. Finally, the physical properties of the FAME produced in the optimal conditions as well as the ratios of the considered factors are characterized with FTIR, GC–MS and viscosity survey."
1,Experiment,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials WFO was obtained from a food production factory around Tehran (Iran). Chitosan (medium viscosity, 80% deacetylated, Mw = 1.9 × 105, 200–400 mPa·s,) was obtained from Alborz Company (Iran); The Clinoptilolite zeolite with an average particle size of 1800 µm was purchased from Zeolites International Company in Semnan (Iran). Acetone (C3H6O; purity ≥ 99.8%), sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3; purity ≥ 99.5%), ethanol (C2H5OH; purity ≥ 99.9%), hydrochloric acid (HCl; purity ≥ 37%), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4; purity ≥ 99%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4; purity ≥ 95–97%), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3; purity ≥ 99.9%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH; purity ≥ 99%), methanol (CH4O; purity ≥ 99%) and diethyl ether ((C2H5)2O; purity ≥ 99.7%) were obtained from Merck Company."
3,Analysis of surface oxygen groups via Boehm titration,2.2 Analysis of surface oxygen groups via Boehm titration Boehm titration method was applied to measure the number of groups containing oxygen on the surface of the composite. 50 mL conical flask containing the composite and 20 mL of different bases was sealed and shaken for 72 h. The solution was then filtered. 5 mL of each filtrate was separated for the subsequent titration using 0.1 M HCl and methyl orange indicator dissolved in a mixture of water and ethanol. The amount of reacted HCl with the composite was considered to determine the amount of basic sites.
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods Powder XRD was performed on a Bruker D 8 discover A 25 diffractometer (Billerica, Bruker Corporation, USA) equipped with a vertical goniometer under theta-theta geometry. The XRD was done using nickel filteredcopper Kα with λ equivalent 1.5418 A° radiation operated at 40 keV and 40 mA. Phase identification was conducted through comparison of the measured data with the JCPD standard. A JEOL JSM–5600 LV SEM was used to record microscopic images. Wide–ranging angle patterns were gathered 10–80° by 0.01° step size. Using a detector from oxford instruments, an EDX was employed for semi–quantitative chemical analysis. To perform TG analysis (Q50 TA instrument), samples were placed in alumina crucibles and heated up to 700 °C at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1. A Nicolet–6700 spectrometer with potassium bromide pellet was utilized for recording FTIR spectra of the biomaterials. With 32 scans and having a wave number ranging 500–4000 cm−1, all of the spectra attained a 4 cm−1 resolution. A GC–MS analysis, Shimadzu Corp model made in Japan with a column (Hewlett–Packard, 0.25 mm to 30 m) and a helium flow rate of 3 mL per minute was used to analyze the FAME products. Based on the ASTM D445 standard method, kinematic viscosity values were specified using Rheometer Aton paar MCR300 (Denmark) at temperatures between 10 and 40 °C. A DC power strip TDGC2–KVA (Japan) was also used."
5,Zeolite–chitosan biocomposite preparation and design of experiments,"2.4 Zeolite–chitosan biocomposite preparation and design of experiments Fig. 1 shows the scheme of the composite production method from zeolite and chitosan biomaterials: first, four grams chitosan and four grams clinoptilolite were stirred in 170 mL of CH3COOH to produce a suspension in a beaker (5% v/v). The suspension was mixed for three hours, then 100 mL of CH3COOH (5%) was added to the beaker and subsequently mixed for two hours. Once the two hours had elapsed, 500 mL of sodium hydroxide (0.50 M) was added drop wise to the beaker from a burette. Finally, the suspension was mixed for three hours at 100 rpm and then filtered over beads. The beads as the synthesized product were air–dried at room temperature. Fig. 1 shows the essential physical components of an electrochemical cell. This includes a graphite anode and cathode, a power supply filled with the volume 100 mL of mixture containing water, oil, co solvent, methanol and Na+/zeolite–chitosan biocomposite as a catalyst. The graphite electrodes were kept at distance of 1 cm apart and the electrolysis cell (2 cm × 2 cm × 0.1 cm) was agitated using a magnetic mixer. Based on the method reported by Tanawannapong et al. (Tanawannapong et al., 2013), fine particles and suspended matter were first separated from the WFO and then it was reacted with sulfuric acid (1 wt%) for 2 h to reduce the acid value determined via titration. The ASTM D664 method was used to determine the acidity of the original WFO as well as the acidity of WFO after its use in esterification of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs). In this technique, a test sample is dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and diethyl ether then titrated with a potassium hydroxide solution. Calomel electrodes and pH–meter equipped with glass was utilized to determine the end point. The following equation was used to calculate the acid value X (Corro et al., 2017): (6) X = 56.1 × V × c m where c is the concentration (mol L−1) of the standard volumetric KOH solution used, V is the volume (mL) of standard volumetric potassium hydroxide solution used, molecular mass of KOH is 56.1, and m represents the mass (grams) of the test portion. Equation (7) was used to determine FFA% from the acid number ratio (Doyle et al., 2017): (7) F F A % = A V t 0 - A V t A V t 0 × 100 % In this Equation, AVt represents the acid value after reaction at time t and AVt0 shows the acid value at time 0. The following equation was used to calculate the saponification: (8) Q = N × 56.1 × ( L 1 - L 2 ) W where Q is the saponification value, L1 and L2 are the amount (in mL) of HCl 0.5 N for the control titration and sample titration, respectively, W is the WFO weight (g) and N is the normality. Thus, the molecular weight of WFO can be determined through the following equation (Fereidooni et al., 2018b; Fereidooni and Mehrpooya, 2017): (9) M o l e c u l a r w e i g h t o f W F O = 3 × 56100 Q Table S1 shows the results of determinations of characterization of WFO. Different ratios of acetone as a co solvent (5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5% and 15%) were set; Based on the available literature, the co solvent was added in wt% of oil (Guan and Kusakabe, 2009; Fereidooni et al., 2021). The methanol to WFO molar ratios were examined at 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1 and 9:1. The voltages were set by DC power that ranged from 20 to 55 V. The Na+/zeolite-chitosan composite to oil weight ratios were 0.5%, 1% and 1.5%. 2 wt% of H2O and were also added to the reaction mixture. To purify FAME, the water washing method was performed during which 15 wt% of distilled hot water (85 °C) was mixed with FAME and agitated continuously at 400 rpm for 20 min. Purified FAME separation from waste water was conducted using gravitational settling through a separating funnel for two hours. For an extensive cleaning process, the experiment was repeated twice. Glycerol is produced as a by–product of WFO electrocatalytic transesterification for FAME production, but most of the free glycerol was removed after the gravitational–separation process. Next, the FAME was warmed at 100 °C with continuous mixing for 20 min to flush out the residual moisture and the remaining alcohol. Anhydrous sodium sulfate followed by filtration was used to dry the final FAME. After transesterification, the quality parameters of FAME were analyzed and compared to biodiesel Standards ASTM D664. Equation (10) was used to calculate the percent yield of FAME: (Foroutan et al., 2020). (10) F A M E Y i e l d ( % ) = ( W e i g h t o f F A M E p r o d u c e d W e i g h t o f W F O ) × 100 %"
6,Kinetic analysis,"2.5 Kinetic analysis The exponential function in equation (11) was used to describe the reaction kinetics of biodiesel for engineering applications (Wang et al., 2018). Experimental kinetic parameters were also used to determine the apparent activation energy and the order of reaction to obtain a rate equation. The following exponential equation represents the total transesterification reaction rate of WFO for unchanged catalyst (Chen et al., 2020): (11) r = k × C WFO α × C methanol β where r is the reaction rate, k is the equilibrium rate constant, CWFO and Cmethanol are the concentration of WFO and methanol, respectively. α and β are the reaction order of CWFO and Cmethanol, respectively. The concentration of WFO (methanol) did not change during the reaction. α and β parameters were determined experimentally by OriginLab software and least square method. Arrhenius equation (equation 12) was applied to graphically determine the pre–exponential factor, A, and the activation energy, Ea, for the transesterification of WFO (Yadav et al., 2018): (12) k = A × exp (–(Ea/R × T) where T is the absolute temperature (in K) and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1). Tangential slopes at t = 0 were used to calculate the initial reaction rates, r0, based on exponential curve fitting method."
7,Results and discussion,"Characterization of the surface morphology of the biomaterials was performed using SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and TG (Fig. 2 ). Based on the SEM micrograph from Fig. 2 (a), zeolite has rough and flaky surface. Characterization of the SEM of chitosan in Fig. 2 (b) shows that chitosan has a compact, dense, and rough surface. Fig. 2 (c), reveals that the biocomposite has a rough, compressed and irregular surface; on the other hand, shows that the zeolite–based composite has a large surface area, high thermal stability, well defined pore structures with cavities and channels of molecular dimensions, and good figure selectivity. TEM images in Fig. 2 (d) demonstrate that channels and holes with different sizes are highly porous in raw zeolite. Similarly, TEM of zeolite–chitosan composite in Fig. 2 (e) shows that there are different cages and pores on the surface of the structure. XRD diffractograms of clinoptilolite zeolite (f), chitosan (g), and composite (h) are shown in Fig. 2. The XRD analysis reveals that the diffraction peaks of the zeolite chiefly characterized zeolite as well as some impurities including leucite, montmorillonite, ferrosilite and quartz. XRD diffractograms of chitosan are shown in Fig. 2 (g) with peaks where 2θ equals 9.8° and 19.8°. Such patterns characterized a chitosan polymorph, known as a “tendon” hydrated polymorph (Belamie et al., 1997). The diffracted intensity at 2θ equals 19.8° in Fig. 2 (g) showcases a notable difference between the diffractograms of chitosan and the zeolite–chitosan composite. Compared to the composite, the intensity of the peak in chitosan is notably higher. In Fig. 2 (h) by contrast, this peak has disappeared, meaning there were significant structural changes that took place during zeolite-chitosan biocomposite formation. The disappearance of this peak is specifically due to high intercalation between zeolite and chitosan. The position of this peak is moved to marginally higher diffraction angles to reduce the basal spacing demonstrates the composite nature from both zeolite and chitosan. This composite formation also shows hydrogen bonding destruction between the hydroxyl and amino groups in chitosan after linking. The absence of chitosan in the XRD spectrum after coating may be caused by lower degree of chitosan crystallinity as a function of the degree of deacetylation. Additionally, the absence of chitosan in the spectrum is may be due to Na+ peaks overlapping with the XRD peaks related to chitosan, which are observed as wide peaks at 2θ = 10° and 20°. The substantial broad peaks in XRD spectrum and the disappearance of 10° and 20° diffraction peaks in zeolite-chitosan composite show chelation incidence and interaction between the Na+ zeolite as a substrate and molecules of chitosan. Furthermore, after modification of zeolite and chitosan, some clinoptilolite characteristic peaks were intensified and other peaks related to impurities were declined or removed. The decrease in the intensity of zeolite peaks by increasing the Na+ content reveals the sustainability of the crystallinity (Intarapong et al., 2013). The clinoptilolite characteristic peak was retained after chitosan coating, which shows that the modification of zeolite by chitosan did not make any change in crystal structure of zeolite. Fig. 2 exhibits EDX for pure zeolite (i), chitosan (j), and the zeolite-chitosan composite (k). Zeolites consist of a 3D tetrahedral network of Al and Si as TO4 (T = Si, Co, Al, P, Fe, B, Ge) connected to each other by oxygen atoms (Jacobs et al., 2001). The negative charge of the zeolite network can be neutralized by positive ions such as Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+. So, zeolites have severe affinity to cationic species (Moshoeshoe et al., 2017; Supamathanon and Khabuanchalad, 2019). Fig. 2 (k) shows that within raw zeolite, some sodium is present in significant quantities. This sodium might have been produced by sodium hydroxide, as negative charge on the surface of zeolite attracted Na+ ions as a charge counterbalanced. Fig. 2 (k) similarly reveals the presence of Na+, originated from clinoptilolite, in the zeolite–chitosan composite where the Na+ ions counterbalance the negative charge of the composite. C, Al, Si and O were found to be the main componants of the zeolite–chitosan composite, which is in line with expectations of the composition. Zeolites are porous aluminosilicate compounds in which oxygen atoms occupy tetrahedral positions, making them attractive for biocatalyst applications (Mahmodi et al., 2020). A comparison of the SEM patterns reveals that through zeolite–chitosan composite loading by Na+, a considerable amount of Na+ is adsorbed on the faces of the composite resulting in needle–shaped frames on the catalyst. This is in accordance with the EDX results. EDX spectrometry was also employed to determine the Na+ content of the zeolite and catalyst. The results revealed that Na+ accounted for 1.30 wt% and 7.95 wt% of zeolite and the catalyst, respectively. Silicon and aluminum presence confirms the formation of zeolite–chitosan composites demonstrating that the pretreatment of zeolite with Na+ possibly washed off some of the metals adsorbed on the surface clinoptilolite. A final consideration to make is that certain amount of Na+ may have been brought into the zeolite by chitosan. Fig. 2 (l) shows the TG curves obtained for zeolite, chitosan and composite. Chitosan showed two weight losses in the range of 47–123 °C and 222–425 °C owing to the water vaporization (~20% weight loss) and saccharide degradation (~65% weight loss), respectively. Zeolite–chitosan biocomposite also yields a TG curve similar to that of chitosan with two initial weight losses of about 8 and 5%. This biocomposite shows higher thermal stability in comparison with zeolite and chitosan. This may be the presence of chitosan within the zeolite cavities, improving the physio–chemical stability as well as the rigidity of the composite (Mahmodi et al., 2020; Batista et al., 2011). The zeolite and synthesized biocomposite pore volume and specific surface area were characterized by adsorption of nitrogen using a multipoint BET sorptometer. Table 1 shows BET of natural zeolite and the composite. The biocomposite's surface area was determined to be 3.731 m2 g−1 whereas the surface area of zeolite was determined to be 8.302 m2 g−1. The difference between these two values can likely be attributed to coating of chitosan in the inner surface of clinoptilolite's pores as active sites and cages. This was a predictable result, since zeolite's surface and pores were coated by Na+ during the impregnation process. Composite surface coating by Na+ lead to a significant decrease in pore volume such that Na ions would be able to cover a considerable part of the surface pores in the composite structure. The surface area of the biocomposite was measured to be 3.731 m2 g−1 which was possibly due to the heating of the composite in the preparation stage which formed AlONa groups and Na+ species on the surface. The results indicate that the AlONa groups and Na+ species linking process have reduced the composite average pore size. Molecules of chitosan were packed in cages and pores of the zeolite surface after coating, which caused the pores to decrease and blockage inhibiting the nitrogen absorption. Chitosan entrapment in clinoptilolite was caused by the bridging mechanisms and hydroxyl group interactions at zeolite surface. These findings show that the structure of chitosan is entrapped in the pores in the natural zeolite not vice–versa. Fig. 3 show FTIR of pure zeolite (a), chitosan (b), and the zeolite–chitosan composite (c). Across all three spectra, the wide peak at 3413 cm−1 is due to the OH groups found in all three compounds. The peak at 2880 cm−1 in the spectrum of chitosan (Fig. 3 (b)) corresponds to the CH stretching vibration of OCHO. The NH group in the primary amine are shown in medium peaks at 1639 cm−1 and 1617 cm−1, while the NH group of the secondary amines are shown in small peaks at 1422 cm−1. A peak at 1383 cm−1 is due to CH bending which demonstrates the presence of the alkyl group. The CO stretching in chitosan is responsible for peaks at 1257 cm−1 and 1152 cm−1. The stretching vibrations of CN correspond to the peak at 1084 cm−1. The zeolite major adsorption bands were: 3413, 1635, 1038, 796, 472 cm−1. The vibration in the region 1600–3700 cm−1 is due to the presence of water in zeolite. The stretching vibration of SiO creates the band at 1038 cm−1. The bands observed at 472 cm−1 and 796 cm−1 correspond to bending mode of SiOSi and quarts or amorphous stretching vibration of SiO2 respectively. Analysis of the zeolite–chitosan biocomposite spectrum (Fig. 3 (c)) demonstrated the features of both of the individual zeolite and chitosan spectra. The stretching vibrations of SiO group are represented at 1021 cm−1 peak. The peaks at 643 cm−1 and 673 cm−1 characterize the stretching vibration of SiOSi and SiC stretching vibration respectively. The SiC peaks show the presence of bonding between zeolite and chitosan in the synthetized composite. As shown in Fig. 3, the peak indicating NH3 + group in biocomposite is observed at 1560 cm−1 clearly. The negative surface of zeolite is counterbalanced by Na+ cations. As a result, the zeolite's negative surface binds to the chitosan protonated amine site. Fig. 4 represents a model of the structure of a zeolite–chitosan biocomposite with different holes, channels and cages with different sizes. Using an alkali post–treatment process, the Na+ cations can be added to the pores in the structure, the defect species on the inner mesopores and the outer composite structure. Generally, it can be said that the cations of Na+ stored in the composite’s cages were adsorbed to the biocomposite's surface structure. These Na+ cations and the basic species on biocomposite are the active sites for WFO transesterification. During the CH3ONa production in the methanol, the surface Na+ could be leached out from the zeolite-chitosan composite's surface. The area depleted with Na+ could then be refilled with Na+ primarily stored in the cages and pores of composite's mesopores. When the catalyst and water are added to the electrolysis cell, O2 evolves on the anode electrode, and H2 and OH− ions are formed on the electrode of cathode (Fereidooni et al., 2018b). In order to utilize the experimental results for industrial purposes, gas exhaust pipes should be mounted in the reactor around the cathode and anode. In order to obtain reasonable FAME yield, the WFO transesterification with methanol requires active sites, i.e., CH3O− ion (Fereidooni and Mehrpooya, 2017). Methoxide ions are produced when alcohol reacts with an OH− ion and after its formation, CH3O− is an extremely nucleophilic molecule. Due to its nucleophilicity, methoxide can attack the carbonyl group in glyceride to produce FAME. Chitosan's Na+ ion containing amino groups form complex structures in which Nitrogen donates an electron pair; in addition, hydroxyl groups OH of chitosan participate in the reaction (Varma et al., 2004). The biodegradation and insolubility of chitosan molecules which brings about the porous structure formation and viscosity loss are attributed to hydrophilicity. The presence of amino and hydroxyl groups cause chitosan's highly hydrophilic behavior (Ludwiczak and Mucha, 2010). The formation of the zeolite–chitosan biocomposite, which is stabilized by coordination of chitosan's covalent bonding with Na+ ions, is probably influenced by the roughness of the zeolite surface. This roughness of zeolite's surface is brought about by the primary evolution of hydrogen and dissolution of sodium ions. It should be noted that the protonated amino groups in chitosan’s structure have the potential to bind with metal ions (Dambies et al., 2001). The mechanism proposed for understanding and monitoring the interaction between ions of Na+ and structure of chitosan is relatively complicated due to linking reactions metal ions, formation and complexation of coordinate–covalent bonds, hydrogen molecule bonding and electrostatic repulsion changes. Instead of electrostatic interactions, the transition ions of the metal form coordinate–covalent bonds with chitosan. However, in the electrolysis setup, the water in the reactor is responsible for transferring the electric charge between two electrodes meaning water molecules are continuously electrolyzed near the cathode. The most active site for electrocatalytic transesterification is the area near the cathode in electrolysis cell. In this study, transesterification was performed in room temperature by electrolysis water without saponification. The existing water in the reactor was consumed with the passage of reaction time. Fig. S1 shows the proposed mechanism for FAME formation through electrolysis. Tetrahedral bonding between Al and Si leads to the formation of a negative–charged stable 3D honeycomb structure which can be neutralized by positive ions like Na+ (Rožić et al., 2000; Safie and Zahrim, 2020). It has been shown that COH groups on chitosan can mineralize the SiOH groups on zeolite, generating an interpenetrating network (Mahmodi et al., 2020). The negative amino groups on the surface of the zeolite can absorb cationic metal ions (Truong et al., 2019). So, Na+ cations can form basic SiONa after interaction with SiOH. The bridging of SiOH⋯Al group, known as Brønsted acid site, gives amphoteric property to natural zeolites, as shown in Fig. 5 . Lewis acids typically have electron accepting characteristic, while Lewis bases donate their electrons. As a result, zeolites can represent both electron donating and electron accepting properties against guest compounds, the strength of which depends on the adsorption site. In addition, framework oxygen atoms and charge compensating cations can be considered as Lewis base and acid, respectively. So, the zeolites have both electron donating and electron accepting property for guest species depending on the adsorption site. So, oxygen atoms next to Al (SiOAl oxygen atoms) with larger negative charge are more basic (Hashimoto, 2003). Since transesterification is a reversible reaction, an excessive amount of alcohol is needed to drive the reaction forward. The excessive alcohol also facilitates the dissolution of water generated from the reaction. The relationship between the methanol/oil molar ratio and the FAME yield content is shown in Fig. 6 (a). It can be seen that the higher the methanol/oil molar ratio (9:1 ≥ ), the lower is the FAME yield content. This can be achieved by simply diluting the reactants. By further increasing the methanol to WFO ratio (9:1 ≥ ), the solubility of glycerol increases which leads to lower production of ester, hence decreases the FAME yield. In contrast, the presence of excess water in the reaction enhances soap formation, leading to the reduction of basic catalytic activity and hence lower FAME yield (Asl et al., 2020). In Fig. 6 (a), when methanol (at constant oil to methanol molar ratio) is 3:1 in the presence of 1 wt% of zeolite-chitosan biocomposite, the methyl ester yield is 88.5%. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), electric conductivity is low in 1 wt% of zeolite–chitosan composite and 1:4 methanol to WFO ratio. Since the wt% of the composite is determined according wt% of WFO, electric conductivity is lost when 8:1 ratio of methanol to WFO reaches 9:1. When biocomposite concentration is increased further to 1.5 wt%, FAME production declined to 63% because of poor mixing between solid and liquid. Therefore, for the next experiments, 1 wt% catalyst was selected. Among the alkaline catalysts for transesterification, CH3ONa as an active species in zeolite–chitosan composite is regarded as the most reactive catalysts. This works in conjunction with zeolite as it is regarded as a base catalyst for CH3ONa in transesterification reactions. The optimized amounts of biocomposite concentration enhance the active spaces in the structure of catalyst. According to Fig. 6 (a), the optimal methanol/oil ratio was 8:1 which was kept constant in the subsequent experiments performed to optimize other parameters. Electrolytic transesterification was performed under optimum conditions with the addition of methyl orange. No significant variation was observed neither in the basic pH value nor the mixture color until the FAME yield of 96.5% in the presence of catalyst. A known amount of energy, provided by DC power, is required to start the chemical reaction at the electrodes in electrolysis. The electrical circuit and the mixed conductivity of the reaction is nearly proportional with the concentration of the catalyst in the solution. Moreover, the circuit increases with the enhancement of electrocatalytic transesterification voltage which leads to the formation of OH− at the cathode. In an electrolytic cell, electrons flow through an electrical circuit to the cathode electrode. Using DC power, electrons combine with the free protons in the reaction mixture to generate OH− and H2 (cathode reaction) as a diminishing reaction takes place. Through the concentration of the hydroxide ions which are formed in the cathode. The overall process in a fuel cell happens at the same time which lead to the generation of electricity concurrent with substrate oxidation. As shown in Fig. 6 (b), in 1 wt% of the catalyst concentration, the FAME yield reaches to 91.5% when the electrolysis voltage is lowered from 45 V to 30 V. Fig. 6 (b) shows that 40 V was chosen as the optimized voltage for continuing transesterification reaction. The FAME yield obtained after 30 min without catalyst at 40 V using alcohol/WFO molar ratio of 8:1 and 2 wt% H2O is about 32% (Fig. 6 (a)). This very low value for the FAME yield may be due to the lack of electron transmitters and hence incomplete electrolytic transesterification in the absence of catalyst. The electrolytic transesterification reaction under optimum conditions fails in the presence of water at 0 V. In fact, without water electrolysis and soap formation, no FAME is obtained due to the presence of basic catalyst together with water. The reaction yield using catalyst at 0 V in the absence of water is low mainly due to the existence of active sites for transesterification reaction. This may be the result of saponification reaction between alkaline catalyst and the high content of FFA in the reaction medium (Moradi et al., 2021). The FAME yield after 30 min at room temperature and stirring rate of 400 rpm using alcohol/WFO molar ratio of 8:1 and 1 wt% Na+/zeolite–chitosan composite was 53.5%. The FAME yield obtained via electrolytic transesterification by using only chitosan and water was negligible due to the lack of electrolyte. Electrolysis using pure zeolite in the presence of water does not result in the formation of FAME because the solution has not sufficient electrical conductivity in the absence of electrolyte. So, water, which is required as the promoter for methoxide ion formation, is not electrolyzed (Moradi et al., 2021). Electrolytic transesterification with zeolite as the only catalyst without water does not occur because the solution has not sufficient electrical conductivity in the absence of electrolyte. Electrolytic transesterification with chitosan as the only catalyst without water does not occur because the solution has not sufficient electrical conductivity in the absence of electrolyte. Two phases are formed before adding acetone as the co solvent. In the beginning stage, transesterification reaction is restricted by alcohol's low solubility in oil. To ease this restriction, the use of co solvent in transesterification has been suggested. When the acetone to methanol ratio is 10 wt% and catalyst concentration is 1 wt%, the highest yield is reached at 96.5% after 30 min. Adding acetone with molar ratio of 15, in contrast, homogenizes the solution but results in a decrease of FAME yield (Fig. 6 (c)). The solubility increases with adding acetone but decreases the resistance of mass transfer for transesterification reaction (Fereidooni et al., 2018b). In an electrolysis cell, the electrical conductivity declines when wt% of co solvent increases; consequently, the optimum ratio of co solvent for transesterification of WFO should be selected in this stage. As shown in Fig. 6 (d1), the rotation speed of the homogenizer was tested in range of 100 to 700 rpm with constant composite loading of 1 wt%, molar ratio of 8:1 WFO to alcohol, and temperature of 25 °C. As shown, there is a constant rise in yield from 88.5% to 96.5% with the increase in rotation speed of 400 rpm; however, further increase of speed above 400 rpm did not show a considerable impact on FAME yield. Rotation speed beyond 500 rpm can cause the formation of super cavitation, which causes the collapse of cavities with declined intensities thus affecting the overall reaction rate. As a result, the optimum rotation speed of was determined to be 400 rpm and was used in all experiments. Na+/zeolite–chitosan biocomposite is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for WFO electrolytic transesterification. So, the internal and external diffusion limitations can be overcome by determining the intrinsic kinetics data. The influence of mass transfer was also investigated at various agitation rates (100–700 rpm). Fig. 6 (d2) shows the effect of reaction time on the FAME yield at agitation rates in the range of 100–700 rpm. Fig. 6 (d3) shows the FAME yield and r0 as a function of agitation rate. As can be seen from the figure, r0 increases gradually until the agitation rate of 400 rpm and then becomes stable. The determined activation energy was 59.05 kJ mol−1. Fig. 6 (e) reveals that temperature has significant influence on the FAME yield. It is worth mentioning that by increasing the reaction temperature, the FAME yield reduces. This may be caused by the evaporation of water and alcohol at higher temperatures, leading to lower FAME yield. Guan and Kusakabe (2009) and Putra et al. (2015) reported that the highest yield can be obtained at ambient temperature (25 °C). The same result was reported in our previous work (Fereidooni et al., 2018b,a). In contrast, at higher temperatures, the graphite electrodes can resist and cut the electric current (Fereidooni and Mehrpooya, 2017). The effect of water content on FAME yield was also investigated due to its significant importance in anodic and cathodic reactions in the electrolytic transesterification. Fig. 6 (f) shows that the highest FAME yield (96.5%) is obtained at the optimum water content of 2 wt%. Some water is consumed as a result of electrolysis in the electrolytic transesterification, while the excess unconsumed water participates in the saponification reaction, reducing the FAME yield (Asl et al., 2020). Boehm titration (AbdelDayem et al., 2020) was performed before and after electrolytic transesterification to quantify the amount of basic and oxygenated acidic groups on the surface of the composite, as show in Table 2 . Since the positively charged functional group carries one positive charge at each site through the protonation equilibrium equation of functional groups of composite. Anions in the aqueous solution interact with the protonated surface functional groups via electrostatic interaction. In addition, amino groups (NH2) of chitosan provide binding sites and are transformed to NH3 + via protonation of the lone pair, improving the reactivity and solubility. A chelate can be formed by the OH and O groups on the N–glucosamine and N–acetyl glucosamine (Safie and Zahrim, 2020). The surface acidity and basicity of Na+/zeolite–chitosan composite is 3.78 mmol g−1 and 4.15 mmol g−1, respectively. The existence of both acidic and basic sites on the surface of Na+/zeolite–chitosan biocomposite makes it a promising candidate for electrolytic transesterification, as shown in Table 2. SEM image of the biocomposite after electrolytic transesterification reaction in Fig. 7 (a) indicates accumulated particles in the structure. Comparison of SEM images before and after transesterification verifies the acceptable stability of the catalyst. With the exception of some slight particle distortion, the morphology of the catalyst has not changed after transesterification. Fig. 7 (c) shows the XRD patterns of the biocomposite after transesterification. The peaks at about 7.7° and 22.5° can be assigned to the zeolite support. There is no significant peak change after transesterification, except for a slight intensity reduction mainly due to the presence of methyl ester and glycerol molecules on the surface of the catalyst. Fig. 7 (d) confirms the presence of Al, Ca, Si, Al and O elements of zeolite along with the C element from chitosan. It can be seen that the composite is mainly consisted of zeolite elements. The estimated amount of calcium in the spent composite is about 0.59 wt% and the high content of equivalent oxygen is related to the chitosan. Fig. 7 (e) shows the FTIR spectra of the biocomposite after transesterification. The large peak at 1015 cm−1 is related to the asymmetric valence vibrations in the SiO4 tetrahedron, while the bands at 2926 cm−1 and 1320 cm−1 correspond to the CH bond in the adsorbed methyl and/or methylene groups of methyl esters on the surface of the composite. The band at 3380 cm−1 arises from the vibration of bulk OH groups and the adsorbed water on the surface of the composite. The shift in SiO band of zeolite implies that the chitosan is attached either by means of NH moieties (hydrogen bonds) or forming an amine oxide (Arcibar-Orozco et al., 2020). The band corresponding to the pseudo–lattice vibrations of the zeolite shifts to lower wave numbers due to the participation of zeolite cations in the composite formation (most likely through electrostatic interaction with the chitosan OH groups). The durability of the catalyst was investigated for 5 runs at 40 V and 25 °C for 30 min using methanol/WFO molar ratio of 8:1, 1 wt% zeolite–chitosan composite, 2 wt% H2O, and stirring speed of 400 rpm, as shown in Fig. 7 (f). The consumed catalyst was washed after each run using DI water, ethanol, and acetone and then dried at ambient temperature for 48 h. The test revealed that most of the sodium (Na+) sites are active and stable after such a long reaction times. The FAME yield decreased from 96.5% in the first run to 92.9% in the fifth run. The reduced interaction between the basic catalytic sites and the reactants may be caused by two reasons: (i) leaching of sodium catalytic sites, and (ii) deactivation of these sites by the by–products adsorbed during the transesterification reaction (Abukhadra et al., 2019). FTIR spectra of the consumed catalyst and the functional groups relating to oil by–products are shown in Fig. 7 (e), which confirms the abovementioned hypothesis. Viscosity is a main factor impacting characteristics of fuel spray and the effective power of engine brakes. High viscosity may cause operational problems such as engine deposits and poor atomization upon injection into the combustion chamber. Moreover, high viscosity may cause problems in fuel transport from tank to engine. Biodiesel viscosity is an essential element in biodiesel combustion. Rhropexy or rheopecty is the infrequent property of some non–Newtonian fluid where the longer fluid shear time brings about higher viscosity. Fig. 8 (a) shows shear stress in which rheopecty behavior is observed followed by Newtonian behavior. Thixotropy is the characteristic of some non–newtonian pseudoplastic fluids to show a time–dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), viscosity increased within the range of 10−2 - 10–1, and it was fixed within the range of 10–1–100 then, thixotropy was observed within the range of 100–101. When the knots are untied, a stable state is found in the fluid where the formation and decomposition of knots are the same. There are no knots at very high shear rates, and the trends for viscosity is mostly fixed as well as independent of shear rate. This fluid has Newtonian behavior at high shear rates. Fig. 8 (b) shows shear stress in which viscosity decline is observed followed by shear thickening behavior within the range of 100–101. After this a sudden increase in viscosity is observed. When the shear speed increases, the chain knots are untied, and dependence on molecular weight decreases. As a result, fluid concentration increases and the fluid shows a sudden Newtonian behavior. As shown in Fig. 8 (b), the viscosity of the fluid increases within the range of 10–2–100 followed by rheopecty behavior. After that, viscosity is fixed. Fig. 9 shows the FTIR spectra for WFO and FAME. As seen in both spectra, the biodiesel fingerprint region is within the range of 900–1500 cm−1. Methyl esters usually display a peak around 1436 cm−1 (OCH3), and this peak, which stretches asymmetrically, is a property of FAME. Moreover, it has been detected that the peak measurement needed to give a direct indication of the attachment of the alkyl group of the alcohol with the fatty acids of the triglycerides is not influenced by the alkyl group (CH3). The functional groups in FTIR adsorption were assigned as: CH2 bending (1244 cm−1), (CH2)n rocking (723 cm−1), OH stretching vibration of hydroperoxide (3467 cm−1), C═O stretching (1743 cm−1), symmetrical stretching of CH2 (2854 cm−1), CH2 scissoring (1463 cm−1), symmetrical bending of CH3(1362 cm−1), asymmetrical stretching of CH2 (2926 cm−1), CH2 bending (1170 cm−1) and trans CCH bending (914 cm−1). The presence of the (CH2)n group vibration band is seen at 723 cm−1, ester COC vibration at 1170 cm−1 and 1207 cm−1 reveals medium intensity bands, and the ester carbonyl compound stretching vibration at 1743 cm−1 is shown by strong bands. The 1170 cm−1 peak shows an OCH3 stretch which is a characteristic of FAME. The FAME was obtained through GC–MS which is based on the ASTM D5442 method. The sample synthesized in optimum conditions was selected for further analysis to investigate the components of FAME. Table S2 shows GC–MS analysis of the FAME which demonstrates the main components to be methyl oleate, methyl stearate and methyl palmitate for this sample Table 3 . Table 4 shows a comparison of performance of the present work with literature data of different catalysts for FAME production from different feedstock."
8,Conclusions,"Zeolite–chitosan biocomposite modification using Na+ is an important strategy to enhance their potential as a catalyst for transesterification stability. In the electrolysis method used in this study, FAME was produced when the methoxide ion, coming from the reaction of methanol with Na+ ions, attacks the carbon of carbonyl group of WFO. The catalytic activity of Na+ increases with the reaction of chitosan's amino groups and AlONa groups on zeolite surface as well as with the chelation of Na+ in pores and cages of the synthetized composite. The highest FAME yield achieved was as high as 96.5% via this electrocatalytic transesterification possess. This was accomplished using 10 wt% acetone as a co solvent at room temperature in the presence of 2 wt% H2O, 1 wt% Na+/zeolite–chitosan composite, and an 8:1 methanol to WFO molar ratio at 40 V with rotation speed of 400 rpm over the course of 30 min."
