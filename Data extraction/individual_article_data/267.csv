0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is back in fashion as it offers possibilities to move away from fossil fuels and when produced from renewable sources such as solar or wind, it becomes an indispensable solution to climate change [1–5]. The current enthusiasm towards H2 has a simple reason: It can be generated from renewable sources such as biomass and water, and whether it is used to produce electricity using fuel cell or burned to produce heat, its only “exhaust” is clean water [2,4]. Various routes are being pursued for low cost hydrogen production such as two-step thermochemical reactions [6], steam reforming of bio-ethanol [7], high-temperature electrolysis of water [8], photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic water splitting [9–12]. Among these, photocatalytic water dissociation over semiconducting particulate photocatalysts using sunlight is considered one of the cheapest routes to make carbon free hydrogen, also known as “green” hydrogen” [13]. There has been considerable research effort devoted to the development of an efficient and stable photocatalyst for H2 production [14,15]. TiO2 has proven to be the most stable candidate but its large band gap (>3 eV) limits light absorption to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation that comprises only ~4% of sunlight [16–19]. Therefore, there is a need to develop active and stable photocatalysts that absorb direct sunlight [20]. Among possible photocatalytic materials, metal sulfides are considered as suitable candidates for H2 generation reaction in the presence of visible light which compromises ~40% of sunlight [21–24]. In particular, CdS is very attractive for hydrogen production under direct sunlight because of its suitable band-gap width (2.4 eV) and appropriate band-edge positions [25–27]. However, there are several major challenges that need to be addressed for practical use of CdS for photocatalytic hydrogen production. For example, CdS nanoparticles tend to aggregate, generating larger sized particles, which results in reduction of surface area [28]. This also leads to increase of charge carrier recombination rates which is detrimental for its photocatalytic activity [29]. Finally yet importantly, CdS suffers from photocorrosion due to self-oxidization via photogenerated holes (CdS + 2h+ → Cd2+ + S) prior to oxidation of hydroxyl ions [5,27,30]. To mitigate the issue of agglomeration, various strategies have been deployed via morphological engineering. Nasir and coworkers prepared high surface area CdS nanorods by thermal decomposition of a cadmium (II) complex as single source precursor and ethylenediamine as a decomposing solvent [31]. Xu and coworkers synthesized ultrathin CdS nanosheets with high surface area and deposited Ni based complex as molecular cocatalyst for hydrogen production [32]. It was found that electron transfer rates from CdS nanosheets to the molecular cocatalyst was much high as compared CdS nanoparticles. Khan and coworkers synthesized highly porous NiO–CdS structures by single pot hydrothermal synthesis. They also demonstrated efficient transport of photogenerated electrons and holes, which can minimize photocorrosion of CdS [5,33]. The photocorrosion of CdS has also been controlled by utilizing inorganic sacrificial agents (Na2S & Na2SO3) with redox potential higher than the valence band holes of CdS to prevent its self-oxidation. We recently reported that the photocorrosion of CdS can effectively be controlled by adding ethanol along with Na2S/Na2SO3 as a source of α-Hydroxy radicals [28]. Efficient extraction of photo-generation charge carriers has also been demonstrated by depositing noble metals on the CdS surface. These noble metal nanoparticles have low Fermi levels and therefore are excellent electron scavengers, thus suppressing charge carrier recombination [34,35]. Precious metals such as platinum, palladium and gold have also been shown to be active sites for H2 generation reaction (HER) [30,34,36]. However, low natural abundance and high cost associated with noble metals presents a hindrance to the future application of M/CdS photocatalysts, motivating the search for alternative, low-cost transition metal co-catalysts. Recently, non-noble metal based deposits/sheets on CdS nanorodes/nanowires have been reported to exhibit excellent H2 production rates, as reported by Yin and coworkers [37,38]. Yu and coworkers reported that when Ni(OH)2 was deposited over CdS, hydrogen production rates exceeded bare CdS and 1 wt% Pt/CdS by a factor of ×145 and ×1.3, respectively [39]. The high photocatalytic H2 evolution rates were attributed to in-situ formation of metallic Ni as result of Ni2+ to Nio reduction by the transfer of conduction band electrons from CdS to Ni(OH)2. Simon and coworkers achieved 53% quantum yield (QY) by depositing Ni over CdS by quenching photogenerated holes using redox couple •OH/ OH as a shuttle [40]. Recently bimetallic nanoparticles have been gaining attention as promising cocatalysts due to unique optical and catalytic properties [41]. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit unique properties which are different than that of mono metallic components due to the synergistic effect [42]. Our group reported a new strategy of co-depositing bimetallic hydroxide cocatalysts of Cu and Ni on TiO2, where hydrogen production rates comparable to noble metals was achieved [34]. Stimulated from our previous work, herein, we report a simple precipitation procedure to fabricate a series of Cu/Ni hydroxides modified CdS nanorods. We demonstrate the potential of these composites for H2 generation under direct sunlight. We report the optimum combination of Cu/Ni hydroxide comprehend photocatalytic and synergistic mechanisms along with the kinetics of reaction. The photocatalyst with an overall 3 wt% metal hydroxide loading and Cu/Ni hydroxides ratio of (0.8: 0.2) was found to be the most active. The synergism between the high surface area CdS nanorods and bimetallic hydroxide cocatalysts significantly enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity which was comparable to CdS catalysts that used noble metals [28,43]."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of CdS nanorods,"2.1 Synthesis of CdS nanorods Solvothermal method was used to prepare CdS nanorods. Briefly, 48.6 mmol thiourea and 16.2 mmol Cd(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 15 mL ethylenediamine and poured into a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave with Teflon inner container. The autoclave was then kept in an oven at 160 °C for 48 h. The yellow precipitates of CdS were collected by filtration, washed with double distilled water and ethanol three times, and finally dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h."
3,Synthesis of Cu-Ni (hydroxides)/CdS,"2.2 Synthesis of Cu-Ni (hydroxides)/CdS Copper and nickel hydroxides were loaded onto the CdS by deposition precipitation method. In a typical preparation procedure, 300 mg of CdS were suspended in 30 mL of (0.2–1.5) M NaOH, sonicated for (15 min) and followed by stirring to yield homogeneous slurry. Known amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O aqueous salt solutions were added drop-wise to the CdS slurry under continuous stirring. The subsequent mixture was further stirred for 1 h. Metal hydroxide loaded CdS catalysts were obtained using vacuum filtration. The catalysts were washed multiple times with ethanol and water, followed by drying at 80 °C for 12 h. At first the photocatalysts with an overall 1 wt% nominal loadings of Ni and Cu were synthesized e.g 0.5Cu(OH)2/0.5Ni(OH)2, 0.8Cu(OH)2/0.2Ni(OH)2, 0.2Cu(OH)2/0.8Ni(OH)2, 1.0Cu(OH)2 and 1.0Ni(OH)2 where prefixes symbolize the ratios of each associated metal. The 0.8Cu(OH)2/0.2Ni(OH)2 CdS photocatalyst was found best among the synthesized photocatalysts. Secondly, by keeping the ratio of Cu(OH)2/Ni(OH)2 constant (0.8: 0.2), another series of photocatalysts were synthesized with upto 5 wt% overall metal hydroxide loading. We found that the catalyst with an overall loading of 3 wt% was the most active among all catalysts."
4,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were performed in a Pyrex reactor (140 mL). In each experiment 10 mg photocatalyst powder was dispersed into the reactor containing 25 mL of 0.1 M Na2S and 0.02 M Na2SO3 water electrolyte mixture at pH 13. Prior to the photoreaction, the reactor was continuously purged with nitrogen gas for 10 min at a flow rate of 15 mL per minute to remove reactor headspace and dissolved oxygen. All experiments were performed during clear days in May, 2018 between 10.00 am and 4.00 pm. The reactor was located (73°08′20′E, 33°44′50′N, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan) under direct sunlight for photocatalysts activations. The average solar irradiance during the experiments was measured using a handheld 105HP pyranometer from SolData Instruments and was found equal to 870 W/m2 (300–1100 nm). H2 evolution was estimated by taking gas sample from reactor head space (0.5 mL) at fixed time intervals and injecting them into a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 2014) fitted with molecular sieve capillary column (length=25 m; average thickness=0.50 µm; ID=0.32 mm) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Hydrogen gas was quantified against an internal standard calibration curve. Each photoreaction was repeated at least three times to maintain accuracy. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined by using the Eq. (1): (1) EQE ( % ) = No . of H 2 molecules ( s − 1 cm − 2 ) No . of incident photons ( s − 1 cm − 2 ) x 100 CdS has a band gap of 2.38 eV which can be excited by visible spectrum below 520 nm. Total number of incident photons s-1 cm-2 was calculated by AM 1.5-ASTM G173-03 Reference Spectra derived from SMARTS v. 2.9.2, NREL (online). Total photon flux below 520 nm wavelength was calculated by global tilt part of data and corrected for flux measured at reaction site (1.61 ×1016 photonss 1 cm 2). Based on the directly exposed reactor area to sun (ca. 14 cm2) and hydrogen production rate, a 13.7% EQE was calculated. This high EQE was also partly contributed by Cu and Ni metal nanoparticles visible light absorption."
5,Photocatalyst characterizations,"2.4 Photocatalyst characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried out using a Siemens, D5000 X-ray diffractometer fitted with graphitic curved monochromator. The XRD data was obtained over the 2θ range of 10–80° (scan rate 30 min−1, step size 0.059) using X-rays of Cu Kα origin (40 mA, 40 kV, λ = 1.5418 A°). The diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectra of as prepared photocatalysts were taken covering 400–850 nm wavelength range by using UVvisible spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fitted with a diffuse reflectance accessory of praying mantis type. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was collected by using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD analysis chamber at ~1 × 10−9 Torr base pressure and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. A 150 W monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.69 eV) source was used to excite samples. The samples were prepared by gently pressing into thin pellets of ~0.1 mm thickness. Buildup of charge during the analysis was removed by a charge neutralization system. Survey scans were obtained at 80 eV pass energy value over 1200–0 eV binding energy range, whereas pass energy of 20 eV was used to collect core level scans. C1s signal measured at 285 eV for adventitious carbons was used to calibrate the spectra. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were performed using Titan ST microscope (FEI company) operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV equipped with a field emission electron gun, a 4k× 4k CCD camera, a Gatan imaging filter (GIF) Tridiem and Gatan imaging software suite (Gatan Inc.). The microscope was operated in HR-TEM (phase contrast) with point-to-point resolution of ca. 0.24 nm and the information limit of ca. 0.12 nm. To prepare samples for analysis, a spec of catalyst were dispersed in ethanol followed by ultra-sonication of the mixture for 15 min. A drop of supernatant suspension was poured onto a holey carbon coated Au grid placed on a filter paper and let it dry before the grid was loaded on to the sample holder. Catalyst nanoparticles sitting on holes were selected for analysis where possible. FFT image was obtained, by selecting a region of interest on HRTEM image indicating the presence of a single particle, using FFT function in Gatan imaging software suite (Gatan Inc.). EDS spectra were collected after adjusting the appropriate magnification and focus to collect most of the signal from the deposit. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was measured using steady-state Flau Time 300 (FT-300) spectrometer, GmbH PicoQuant, Germany. The PL signals was recorded using a pulsed LED laser excitation source PLS-300, centered at 305 nm with FWHM ~416 ps and 0.077pJ pulse energy. The PL curves were fitted with the help of Easy Tau and FluoFit software. The electrochemical experiments were performed by using a SP-300, Bio-Logic Potentiostat with three electrode system; catalyst ink impregnated glassy carbon (GCE) as the working electrode, Platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode (counter) and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and with 0.1 M aqueous Na2SO3 as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out in the frequency range of 1.0 MHz to 1.0 Hz with amplitude of 10 mV at 200 mV potential (vs. Ag/AgCl)."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as prepared CdS as well as bimetallic Cu/Ni hydroxides supported CdS. The 100, 002 and 101 peaks in as prepared CdS catalyst indicates the formation of hexagonal phase at low synthesis temperature of ~160°C, without formation of photo-catalytically inactive cubic phase (ICDD PDF 80-0006) [44]. Typically, low temperature synthesis leads to CdS in cubic phase, which then must be annealed at high temperatures (>500°C) in inert atmosphere in order to convert it to the hexagonal phase. The high temperature annealing step generally leads to increase of particle size due to sintering. The catalysts with bimetallic Cu and Ni cocatalysts showed identical XRD pattern as CdS, suggesting that bimetallic hydroxides are merely deposited over CdS surface rather than doping the CdS crystal lattice. Diffraction peaks of Cu and Ni did not appear upto 3 wt% overall metal loading due to low loading and high dispersion but can be clearly observed for higher metal loadings (3 & 5 wt%) with peaks at 2θ= 23.8°, 31.8°, 53.2°, 60.5°. Fig. 2(a) shows DRS UVVis spectrums of different bimetallic supported CdS and pure CdS. Absorption spectra of pristine CdS shows a sharp absorbance edge at 520 nm which indicates an optical band gap of ~2.38 eV, with the sharp edge indicating high crystallinity of nanorods. For comparison, in Fig. 2(b) we plot the absorption spectra of CdS nanorods against CdS nanoparticles prepared by sol-gel method. The absorption edge of CdS nanorods is clearly shifted towards shorter wavelength (blue shift) by ~20 nm versus the CdS nanoparticles. The reasonable explanation for this is that band gaps alter with the change of overall crystallinity and that of crystal facets due to specific atomic configurations associated with each surface [45,46]. Therefore, change in morphology and surface atomic structures may ultimately results in band gap widening. All bimetallic supported CdS photocatalysts showed absorption in visible range which gradually increased with total metal (Cu and Ni) loading and becomes intense with > 2 wt% metal loading (discussed later). This enhanced absorption from 600 to 800 nm is due to d-d electronic transitions in Cu2+ ions (700–800 nm) and Ni2+ ions (600–800 nm). The increased absorbance of asprepared xCu(OH)2–yNi(OH)2/CdS photocatalysts in visible range suggests an intimate contact between CdS support and metal hydroxide particles. In comparison to pristine CdS, xCu(OH)2 yNi(OH)2/CdS photocatalysts did not show any change in CdS absorption edge, indicating that Cu/Ni hydroxides did not migrated into CdS lattice but were only deposited over the surface. This result was as expected because deposition of Cu/Ni hydroxides at room temperature does not impart enough energy to Cu2+/Ni2+ ions to leach into CdS lattice. By the selection of CdS nanorods and suitable bimetallic hydroxides, a significant utilization of visible light was successfully achieved in this study. Under photoreaction conditions, a change in color of photocatalysts was observed, with the color change being substantial for samples with increasing Cu content. In contrast Ni containing photocatalysts showed long induction times to show any color change. This is because Ni2+ ions in Ni(OH)2 clusters could not be reduced during present photoreaction conditions. On exposing Cu(OH)2/CdS to air after photoreaction, the change in color was reverted back, which was most probably related to re-oxidation of Cu° to Cu2+/Cu+1. Fig. 3(a–d) shows TEM images of as prepared 3 wt% 1.5Cu(OH)2 1.5Ni(OH)2/CdS which validates the fabrication of nanorods with ca. 1–2 µm length and ca. 50 nm diameter. Irregular shaped bimetallic hydroxide deposits of different size can be clearly spotted on CdS nanorodes. This high dispersion of metal hydroxides can give rise to greater hydroxides/CdS interface ratio and facilitates charge transfer from semiconductor support to hydroxides cocatalysts acting as proton reduction cathodic sites [37,38]. Fig. 3d is HRTEM image of a nanorode with inset showing its FFT image. The latter clearly shows the Wurtzite phase (hexagonal unit cell) predominantly exposing its (002), (011) and (010) planes. The existence of Cu/Ni hydroxides on CdS was also confirmed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) as represented in Fig. 3e. While EDS spectra collected for multiple deposits at different locations indicate that hydroxide for both metals are mixed with each other, different CuKα/NiKα indicates that they have different compositions. XPS spectra of as-prepared 3 wt% 2.4Cu(OH)2 0.6Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalysts gave core level peaks for Cd 3d5/2 and S 2p3/2 at binding energies (BE) 404.8 eV and 161.8 eV, respectively. S (S2− form): Cd ratio was found to be 0.92 [47]. An overall discrepancy in ratio was due to appearance of SO4 2−/SO3 2− over the surface of CdS. This formation of SO4 2−/SO3 2− can be confirmed by the presence of S2p doublet with S 2p3/2 at 168.2 eV. The formation of SO4 2−/SO3 2− over the surface may be due to thermodynamically favored surface oxidation of S2− in CdS into S6+/S4+ by valence band holes over the time [48]. The Cu2p XPS regions for three oxidation states of Cu (0,1&2) have been thoroughly studied [49]. Typical Cu2p3/2 XPS binding energy values of Cu+ and Cu° were found in 932.3–932.5 eV range making these oxidation sates hard to differentiate. The Cu2p3/2 XPS peak for Cu2+ is observed at about 933.6 eV which is 1 eV higher than Cu+/Cu° and has also characteristic satellites at ~ 6 eV above Cu2p3/2 due to multiple splitting shown by open 3d9 shells [35]. An identification of Cu in zero oxidation state in current work was due to (Cu2+/Cu°, NHE= 0.24 V) reduction caused by excited electrons flow from conduction band of CdS (NHE= 0.61 V) to subnanometeric Cu(OH)2 clusters under Xrays during XPS measurements [50]. Considering photocatalysts synthesis methodology and strong dd Cu(II) absorption (700–800 nm) detected in UVVIS experiments both are strongly establishing the presence of Cu2+ in freshly prepared samples [35,51]. The position of XPS Ni2p3/2 peaks at binding energy values 855.6 eV and 873.2 eV is shown in Fig. 4 which confirms the presence of Ni2+ in freshly prepared nickel containing photocatalysts. Ni2+ ion due to its paramagnetic behavior also gives rise to additional ‘‘shake-up’’ satellite features at binding energy ~ 6 eV higher than the main Ni2p3/2 peak. The absence of Ni 2p3/2 peaks multiple split represents that Ni2+ is predominantly present as hydroxide in fresh samples, not as NiO. Conclusively, Ni2+ in the form of Ni(OH)2 is not reduced by CdS conduction band electrons transfer during XPS analysis due to its thermodynamically unfavorable redox potential (NHE=−0.72 V) [50]. XPS results are given in Table 1. To get insight into the dynamics of electron transfer, steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdS, 3 wt% Cu(OH)2/CdS, 3 wt%Ni(OH)2/CdS and 3 wt% 2.4Cu(OH)2 0.6Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalysts were recorded (excitation with 305 nm light), and results are shown in Fig. 5a. A broad PL emission peak centered at 510–615 nm is seen for all four samples. This broad emission is a likely recombination of photogenerated electrons in shallow traps within the CdS defect states with photogenerated holes present in valence band or shallow hole traps near the valence band [31]. Fig. 5a shows that PL signal of 3 wt%Cu(OH)2 CdS has ~3x lower intensity compared to CdS. This clearly indicates the quenching of conduction band excited electrons from CdS by Cu(OH)2 surface nanocluster. Interestingly, CdS and 3 wt%Ni(OH)2/CdS exhibited almost similar PL intensities which indicates the inability of Ni(OH)2 to extract CdS conduction band electrons. Furthermore, 3 wt% 2.4Cu(OH)2 0.6Ni(OH)2/CdS showed a PL intensity ~2 times higher than of 3%Cu(OH)2 CdS. This is again due to the presence of Ni(OH)2 in sample with inappropriate reduction potential. To unveil interfacial charge transmission, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used. The Nyquist plots of pure CdS, 3 wt% Ni(OH)2/CdS, 3 wt% Cu(OH)2/CdS, 3 wt% 2.4Cu(OH)2 0.6Ni(OH)2/CdS are shown in Fig. 5b. In general, a smaller arc radius of EIS plots presents a lower resistance to charge transfer. It can be seen in Fig. 5b, Cu(OH)2/CdS generating smallest arc radius compared to all other photocatalysts, indicating the slowest interfacial charge transfer resistance. Similarly, the arc radius of EIS plots is the largest for the pristine CdS photocatalyst indicating that pristine CdS offers the lowest charge mobility. Conversely, CdS and 3%Ni(OH)2/CdS exhibit almost similar arc radius which indicates the inability of Ni(OH)2 to extract CdS conduction band electrons. Moreover, it is important to note that the trend of EIS arc radius is in agreement with the PL results. Photocatalytic H2 generation activity was evaluated under direct sunlight using 0.02 M Na2SO3/0.1 M Na2S electrolyte solution. Pristine CdS showed negligible hydrogen production activity due to rapid charge carrier recombination. Each experiment was continued for a time period of 6 h. To start with, hydrogen production was carried out on a series of 1.0 wt% xCu(OH)2 yNi(OH)2/CdS. Various studies previously established that an overall 1.0 wt% metal cocatalyst loading is optimum for good rates of hydrogen production over semiconductor photocatalysts [34,52]. The 1 wt% Ni(OH)2/CdS was the least active photocatalyst, due to the inability of Ni(OH)2 to quench conduction band electrons of CdS as discussed earlier, with a H2 generation rate ~2x lower compared to 1 wt% Cu(OH)2/CdS. The H2 generation rate of CdS increased with the use of bimetallic Cu/Ni hydroxides cocatalysts with the exception of 1 wt% 0.2Cu(OH)2 0.8Ni(OH)2/CdS which was less active than 1 wt% Cu(OH)2/CdS due to greater amount of Ni(OH)2 in it. Among the series, 1 wt% 0.8Cu(OH)2 0.2Ni(OH)2/CdS was found to exhibit the best activity. It produced a total 57.4mmolsg-1 of hydrogen at rate of 9.8mmolg-1 h-1. It was interesting to note that the photoactivity of 1 wt% 0.8Cu(OH)2 0.2Ni(OH)2/CdS sample decreased considerably when it was calcined at 300 °C. As the calcining at 300 °C does not change the surface area [28], this deactivation of photocatalyst could be linked with the conversion of Cu/Ni hydroxides to oxides with larger particles size, which are not easy to reduce and consequently do not produce the needful bimetallic cathodic sites for proton reduction. Fig. 7a displays the effect of NaOH concentration as the precipitation solution during the deposition of 1 wt% 0.8Cu(OH)2 0.2Ni(OH)2 on CdS. The observable dependency of catalytic activity on NaOH concentration might be due to the effect of NaOH solution on agglomeration of hydroxides nanoparticles on the CdS surface during synthesis process. In the next series of experiments the Cu/Ni hydroxides ratio in photocatalysts was kept similar (0.8/Cu:0.2/Ni) to the best performing 1 wt% photocatalyst but overall metal hydroxide loading was increased as shown in Fig. 7b. Contrary to previous reports, it was found that 3 wt% metal hydroxide loading gave maximum H2 production rate (15.21mmolg-1 h-1) thereafter a decrease in rate was observed. The plausible explanation behind this is that by transforming semiconductor morphology to nanorods provided a greater surface area for the dispersion of metal hydroxide nanoparticles. Further increase in metal loading to 3–5 wt% led to decrease in hydrogen production rates. This is because of a balance between the active sites (metal centers) and metal shadowing effect with an increase in overall metal concentration. Shadowing effect arises due to partial blockage of incoming sun radiations by metal particles (oxides and hydroxides) necessary to produce photogenerated charge carriers. One particular point is, however, worth mentioning, the nickel hydroxide containing photocatalyst showed prolonged induction time before any hydrogen production in both cases, as Ni(OH)2 alone and in Ni-containing photocatalysts which increased with Ni(OH)2 percentage (Fig. 6, Fig. 8). Table 2 summarizes photocatalytic hydrogen activity reported from CdS based photocatalysts. It can be seen in Table 2 that comparatively good hydrogen evolution rates are observed over the bimetallic cocatalyst formulations used in present work compared to monometallic cocatalysts. The activity and stability of 3 wt% 2.4Cu(OH)2 0.6Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst was explored in 0.02 M Na2SO3/0.1 M Na2S electrolyte solution. As shown in Fig. 9, the catalysts showed stable hydrogen production activity over four different runs for total time period of 16 h without any sign of deactivation. A considerable increase in rate (up to 10–15%) was observed for the first two runs and a rate of 20mmolg-1 h-1 was achieved in fourth run. Ongoing from third to fourth run still a noticeable increase in line slope was observed. This indicates a very high stability and activity of our best performing photocatalyst with time. It was observed that photocatalytic activity was started to decrease in 5th run (upto 5% of 4th run) due to the deposition of photocatalyst particles (clearly seen with the naked eye) on the reactor walls with time, thus scattering away a small fraction of incoming light radiation and also might be due to the decrease of the sacrificial reagent. Theoretically, H2 evolution through water splitting can be achieved under visible light over pristine CdS due an ideal band gap of ~2.4 eV. CdS has appropriate conduction band and valence band potentials (0.6 V, +1.8 V vs. NHE) for both oxidation and reduction of water. Albeit the absolute conduction band edge potential of CdS is much higher than reduction potential of protons (H+/H2), but still H2 production rate is negligible over CdS alone without the presence of any metal cocatalysts due to ultrafast recombination rate of charge carriers. Once CdS is decorated with Cu/Ni bimetallic hydroxides over its surface, the hydrogen production rate considerably increases. The potential of Cu(OH)2/Cu° (Cu(OH)2 + 2e = Cu+ 2OH , E°= 0.224 V vs NHE) is considerably below the CdS conduction band potential (NHE= 0.61 V). During photoreaction, Cu2+ ions present in Cu(OH)2 nanoclusters are immediately reduced to Cu° by direct flow of electrons from the conduction band of CdS. This direct electron transfer process can be established by five observations: (1) Instantaneous yellow to dark yellow color change of photoreaction slurry on exposing the reactor to solar radiations. The change in color decreased proportionally with Cu(OH)2 content in photocatalyts. (2) The apparent presence of Cu in its metallic state in as prepared photocatalyst samples due to Cu(OH)2 nanoclusters reduction by CdS conduction band electrons excited by high energy X-rays during XPS analysis. (3) ~3 times lower PL signal intensity of 1 wt% Cu(OH)2/CdS compared with pristine CdS, clearly indicating that photoexcited electrons are captured by Cu2+ in Cu(OH)2 nanoclusters from the conduction band of CdS. (4) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies indicating the lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance for Cu(OH)2/CdS. (5) Cu(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst is showing lowest induction time for hydrogen production which gradually increased with decreasing the amount of Cu(OH)2 contents in as prepared photocatalysts. The H2 generation rate observed using Ni(OH)2 was considerably lower when compared with similar Cu(OH)2 loading (Figs. 6, 8). The reduction potential of Ni(OH)2/Ni [Ni(OH)2 + 2e = Ni°+ 2OH E°= 0.76 V] is slightly higher compared to potential of CdS conduction band (NHE= 0.61 V). Thus, the direct electrons transfer to Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters from CdS conduction band is unlikely. Although it is clearly evident from XPS and photoluminescence results that the reduction potential of Ni2+ in Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters lies above CdS conduction band for all photocatalysts under present conditions, still significant H2 generation rates using Ni(OH)2 loaded photocatalysts were observed. Furthermore, 1 wt% Ni(OH)2/CdS displayed superior activity to that of pristine CdS. These experimental observations ruled out the possibility of Ni(OH)2 cocatalyst to stay passive during photoreaction. As we discussed in our previous study that a photoreactions involving mono or polyhydroxy alcohols as hole scavenging agents, the pH of photoreaction slurry drops to ~4.0 within an hour due to formation of oxidation products. So, in case of alcohols used as sacrificial reagents, Ni(OH)2 is proposed to first dissolve in photoreaction slurry followed by Ni re-deposition over semiconductor (E°, Ni2+/Ni°= 0.23 V), At pH 6, the presence of Ni2+ in equilibrium with Ni(OH)2 has been reported [34,62]. But under present conditions, in the presence of 0.02 M Na2SO3/0.1 M Na2S electrolyte solution the pH of photoreaction cannot drop below 7 due to formation of Na2SO4 as final product and consequently the possibility of Ni2+ leaching into photoreaction mixture is negligible. We further carried photoreaction tests using higher concentration (100 mg) of 3 wt% Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst to allow the detection of Ni2+ ions in the photoreaction slurry using dimethylglyoxime (DMG) as Ni2+ ions complexing reagent. The absence of any red colored complex after 4 h ruled out any dissolution of Ni2+ ions in photoreaction mixture. Therefore, the role of Ni(OH)2 as cocatalyst under present conditions is described by taking into account of both kinetics and thermodynamics of charge carriers. Since the semiconductor and metal both have different Fermi levels, an upward band bending occurs with the formation of depletion layer due to electron transfer from semiconductor to metal until equilibrium is reached. Similarly, when composite photocatalysts is immersed in electrolyte solution, an electrons transfer starts between composite photocatalyst and the solution until equilibrium is reached under dark conditions. Under continuous illumination a non-equilibrium electron/hole populations is generated, which is described by quasi-Fermi level concept. This quasi-Fermi level gradient generates an electric field at the vicinity of semiconductor surface and consequently causes shift in conduction band level to more negative potential and disappearance of depletion layer as illustrated in Fig. 10 [63]. So, in present study under continues sunlight illumination after prior induction period Ni2+ present in Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters is reduced to Ni° due to thermodynamic shift in conduction band level of CdS [64]. This indirect transformation can be established through five observations. (1) Absence of any instant change in photocatalyst slurry color in the presence of sunlight and sacrificial reagents. (2) The presence of Ni2+ in Ni(OH)2 clusters in XPS results of as prepared photocatalyst. (3) Similar PL intensity of 1 wt% Ni(OH)2/CdS compared with pristine CdS. (4) Similar Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies to PL. (5) Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst is showing highest induction time for hydrogen production which gradually decreases with decreasing the amount of Ni(OH)2 in as prepared photocatalysts (Figs. 6, 8). The considerable rate of hydrogen production over 3 wt% Cu(OH)2/CdS was due to formation of metallic Cu with work function (5.1 eV) to develop schottky barrier of appropriate height. A considerably high hydrogen production rate upto 20mmolh 1 g 1, in 0.02 M Na2SO3/0.1 M Na2S electrolyte solution observed for 3 wt% 2.6Cu(OH)2 0.6Ni(OH)2/CdS is consequence of high synergism developed by co-deposition of Cu from Cu(OH)2 nanoclusters and a delayed deposition of Ni under continuous illumination of photoreaction. The Ni may photodeposit directly over electron-rich CdS surface or the already deposited reduced Cu nanoparticles, forming Cu/Ni alloy. It is has been previously established that for an optimized Cu/Ni alloy, a Schottky barrier with more appropriate height is established and at the same time Ni reducibility is enhanced in the alloy [65]. A decrease in H2 evolution rate from 3 wt% 2.6Cu(OH)2 0.2Ni(OH)2/CdS to 3 wt% Ni(OH)2/CdS is due to decrease of Cu content in photocatalysts."
7,Conclusions,"A series of Cu/Ni bimetallic hydroxides supported over CdS (cocatalysts loading ~1–5 wt%) was synthesized by using a facile co-deposition precipitation method, characterized, and their performances were evaluated for H2 production through water splitting reaction under direct solar irradiation. Among the series, 3 wt% 2.4Cu(OH)2 0.6Ni(OH)2 CdS photocatalyst produced very high H2 generation rates of 20 mmol h-1 g-1. This high rate of H2 production over bimetallic photocatalyst compared to monometallic counterparts is due to high synergism achieved by nanorods morphology of CdS and suitable Schottky height obtained by Cu and Ni transformation into their metallic states during photoreaction. Detailed analysis comprising of reaction kinetics, chemical impedance spectroscopic studies, photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) proposed a new mechanism for hydrogen evolution over Cu(OH)2 Ni(OH)2/CdS. During photoreaction both hydroxides were converted into their active metallic states by two different pathways. With an appropriate reduction potential Cu(OH)2 is directly reduced to Cu° by conduction band electrons of CdS during photoreaction whereas a shift in conduction band under continues sunlight illumination helped in the delayed reduction of Ni(OH)2 to Ni°. The current study reveals that Cu–Ni cocatalysts deposited on CdS are promising alternatives to precious metals for H2 generation from water splitting."
