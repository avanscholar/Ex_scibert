0,Introduction,"An increasing research attention in recent years has been focused on lignocellulosic biomass conversion and biorefinery for production of multiple bio-based products (ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, lipids, enzymes, polyhydroxybutyrate, biochar-based catalyst) to add profit and promotes sustainability to the agricultural industry and rural economy (Chen and Wan, 2017; Ding et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2015a; Sun et al., 2018a; Xiong et al., 2017). Biofuels and bio-chemicals are the most important products from the lignocellulosic biorefinery which are generally achieved through two conversion platforms: biochemical and thermochemical. Biochar, produced from thermochemical conversion, can account for 10–60% of the total products depending on feedstock types and process conditions (Qian et al., 2015). Biochar is a carbon-rich solid material formed during thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, algae biomass, animal wastes, municipal solid wastes and other organic carbonaceous materials with limited supply of oxygen (Lehmann et al., 2006). Biochar contains minerals and trace metals, has porous structure with high surface area and functional groups, possesses pH buffering and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (Sun et al., 2018a; Yuan et al., 2011), and serves as reservoir of electron donor and acceptor (Saquing et al., 2016). The properties of biochar are largely affected by the feedstock type and production method such as slow or fast pyrolysis, gasification or hydrothermal carbonization (Sun et al., 2014). Biochars produced from different feedstocks are commonly used in soil amendment, greenhouse gas sequestration and removal of contaminants in wastewater due to their high surface area, high porosity and rich functional groups (Ahmad et al., 2014; Lehmann et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2011). For bioprocessing and biomass refinery, biochar as a common inexpensive by-product with rich physiochemical characteristics can be used to promote more sustainable and integrated processes, thus reducing the reliance on using expensive pure chemicals and materials that consumes more energy and causes environmental issues (Cheng and Li, 2018). Recently, biochar has received increasing attention for use in several applications where biochar facilitated bioprocessing for enhanced productions of biofuel and chemicals, and are focused in this review. Biochar production through thermochemical conversion process and how the feedstock compositions, process conditions and modification affect biochar characteristics have been discussed by researchers for decades (Cha et al., 2016; Srinivasan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017a; Yang et al., 2006). The production method and characteristics of biochar were critical and directly determined its utilization, and therefore were reviewed and discussed first. Recent advances in biochar-facilitated productions of biofuels and biochemicals (hydrogen, biogas, ethanol, butanol, fatty acids) including bio-fertilizer and biomass-derived hydrocarbons were then critically reviewed. The physicochemical properties of biochar can modify microbial processes conditions which could directly affect growth and metabolisms of microorganisms, resulting in improved products profile. Such microbial processes include anaerobic digestion for production of hydrogen (Sharma and Melkania, 2017), methane (Shen et al., 2017), medium-chain fatty acids (Liu et al., 2017), and microbial fermentation for production of bioethanol (Klasson et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2018a) and bio-butanol (Sun et al., 2019a; Sun et al., 2018b). Microbial processing has also been involved in composting where addition of biochar could improve the quality of the end-compost as an agricultural fertilizer (Kammann et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014a). Besides, the adsorption ability of biochar benefited lignocellulosic biofuel fermentation by removing inhibitory compounds such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) generated during biomass pretreatment (Klasson et al., 2013). Biochar serving as a low-cost catalyst for biomass hydrolysis and dehydration (Xiong et al., 2018), tar removal (Gilbert et al., 2009), syngas and bio-oil upgrading (Ren et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2011), and synthesis of biodiesel via esterification and transesterification (Dehkhoda and Ellis, 2013) are also elaborated. However, there is very limited research on biochar utilization in fungi and algal bioprocessing where most valuable enzymes, antibiotics, amino acids, proteins were obtained. Therefore, potential biochar uses in these fungal and algal-based processes are proposed for future research and collaboration to achieve more sustainable and low-carbon economy."
1,Biochar productions and characteristics,
2,Thermochemical conversions,"2.1 Thermochemical conversions The most common thermochemical conversion processes for biochar production are pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and gasification. Each one is different from the other in heating rate, highest temperature achieved, residence time, media used or feedstock conditions, and the resulting products profile is different. The most commonly acknowledged method for biochar production is pyrolysis which refers to the heat-treatment of biomass to biochar in an oxygen limited or free environment with bio-oil and syngas as co-products (Manyà, 2012). Pyrolysis is considered as one of the most efficient processes to reserve energy and organic carbon in the form of char (mostly aromatic carbon) from biomass and other carbonaceous materials. Pyrolysis can occur at temperature ranging from 400 to 1200 °C but lower temperature (Table 1 ) and higher residence time are typically considered preferable for biochar formation (Tripathi et al., 2016). Under oxygen-limited condition, biomass can be heated to a temperature above its thermal stability threshold without combustion. During the heating process, biomass is firstly subjected to a series of chemical reactions such as dehydration, decarboxylation, and dehydrogenation, forming various functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. Then cracking is occurred to convert heavy components of biomass into char, gases (CO, CO2, H2, CH4, H2S, NOx, etc.), with some volatile hydrocarbons being re-condensed into liquids called bio-oil (Tripathi et al., 2016). Based on processing conditions, pyrolysis is categorized into different types: slow, fast and flash, intermediate, vacuum, hydro pyrolysis (Tripathi et al., 2016). Slow pyrolysis, with heating rate between 0.1 and 1 °C/s, residence time ranging from 5 to 30 min, highest temperature about 400–500 °C, yields more biochar and gaseous components than fast pyrolysis. Compared to slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis is performed with higher heating rate (10–200 °C/s) and temperature (850–1250 °C), and lower residence time (1–10 s), resulting in yields of more liquid products, or bio-oil, which accounts for 60–75% of total products. One type of novel pyrolysis is microwave assisted pyrolysis which has the advantage of faster heating rate, resulting in increased surface area in biochar and reduced water content in bio-oil, compared with traditional phyroylsis. Besides, easier operation through instant off/on control and process enhancement with addition of microwave absorbing materials are also advantages of microwave pyrolysis (Mohamed et al., 2016). Hydrothermal carbonization is another thermochemical treatment method that focuses on the production of biochar, bio-oil and syngas. Biochar production from hydrothermal carbonization (also called hydrochar) is conducted at low temperatures (180–250 °C). The differences between HTC and pyrolysis is that HTC is performed with biomass soaked with water at high pressure so that the water remains as liquid state throughout the range of temperatures used (Cha et al., 2016). Therefore, hydrothermal carbonization becomes advantageous when the biochar feedstock has high moisture content, while pyrolysis required a drying process of feedstock in advance. Besides, HTC process produces biochar with higher C content than the dry processes (pyrolysis and gasification). Temperature, pressure, heating rate and water to biomass ratio are important factors affecting properties of HTC products (Cha et al., 2016). Because of its wet processing characteristics, HTC process broadened the spectrum of feedstocks that can be used from wet agricultural residues and municipal solid wastes to human wastes and sewage sludge (Libra et al., 2011). During the process, the pressure is raised to maintain a liquid state of water above 100 °C. HTC process increases heating value of feedstocks typically by 50%–80%. The resulting hydrochar contains high amount of oxygen functional groups, phenolic compounds and unique spherical morphology on the char surface (Román et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2012). It is worth noting that due to the associated increase in pressure, raising temperature of a hydrothermal process is much more difficult than a pyrolysis process. Consequently, either pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization can be more advantageous over the other for biochar production depending on the conditions of feedstock used (e.g. moisture content, particle size, etc.), energy and cost input (e.g. drying process, pressure increase, etc.), and the products application (e.g. wastewater treatment, composting, soil remediation, in-situ catalysis, etc.). Gasification is either relatively uncommon for biochar production or are typically used to produce gaseous products, or syngas, rather than biochar (Ngan et al., 2019). Gasification is a thermochemical process where carbonaceous contents of biomass are converted into the gaseous fuel or chemicals in the presence of gasifying agent such as oxygen, air, steam or some mixture of them at an elevated temperature ranging between 500 °C and 1400 °C (Morrin et al., 2012). The gaseous products consists of mainly CO, CO2, H2, N2, and other trace amount of impurities including methane (CH4), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen cyanide (HNC) (Kumar et al., 2009). The residues after gasification include biochar, ash, tar and bio-oil (Morrin et al., 2012; Neves et al., 2011). Gasification biochar typically has smaller specific surface area and pore volumes than pyrogenic biochar due to ash melting and pore collapse under high temperature, which however, could also be counteracted by in situ activation process with gasifying agent (oxygen or steam) (You et al., 2017). Carbon content and functional groups (carboxyl or carbonyl) of gasification biochar are also lower than pyrolysis biochar due to oxidation of carbon into CO and CO2. A detailed review on biochar produced from gasification can be found in You et al. (2017). Under thermochemical conversion platforms, process conditions and biomass feedstock composition determines the yield, physicochemical properties and quality of bio-char produced (Yang et al., 2006). Post-modification (activation) can improve the physicochemical properties of biochar and are included in the following discussion."
3,Characteristics,"2.2 Characteristics The physicochemical and biological properties of biochar are primarily affected by feedstock type and process conditions (Sun et al., 2014; Vijayaraghavan, 2019). The feedstock type can range from lignocellulosic biomass and biogenic materials such as sugar cane bagasse (Abdelhafez et al., 2014), corn stover (Shen et al., 2017), soybean straw (Yuan et al., 2011), micro-/macro- algal residues (Yu et al., 2017), to organic wastes such as animal manure (Cely et al., 2015) and sewage sludge (Yue et al., 2017) (Table 1). The difference of biochar properties can be significant based on different feedstock types. For example, biochars derived from wastewater solids typically have higher H to C ratios than other biochars, concomitant with their lower C content (Liu et al., 2018). Besides, biomass containing high lignin and low moisture contributes to high biochar yield, while volatile compounds are more favorable with biomass having high proportion of cellulose and hemicelluose (Tripathi et al., 2016). Primary process conditions including temperature, heating rate, residence time and other process parameters such as particle size, reactor bed height, pressure, carrier gas flow rate, and catalyst type also affect biochar yield and physiochemical properties (Tripathi et al., 2016). Attributes of biochar include its fixed carbon and ash content, leaching ability of alkali and alkaline compounds (Na, K, Ca and Mg), minerals and metals (P, S, Fe, Mn and Zn) content, pH buffer capacity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity, surface area and pore size distribution, morphology, surface elements, surface chemical compounds and functional groups, thermal stability, crystallinity, binding structure/aromaticity (EC) (Azargohar et al., 2014; Ngan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2011). Some of the major biochar characteristics are listed in Table 1. The biochar matrix is mainly amorphous with some local crystalline structures of highly conjugated aromatic sheets which are cross-linked in a random manner (Cao et al., 2017). Generally, increasing the pressure lowered the solid yield (Fiori et al., 2014) and increasing temperature led to an increased heating value and pH (Zhang et al., 2017b). The effect of residence time on biochar yield was reported to be associated with temperature: long residence time is favorable for biochar yield at high temperature but not at low temperature. Larger particle size of feedstock mostly favors higher biochar yield (Tripathi et al., 2016). Higher carrier gas flow rate shortens the vapor residence time allowed for repolymerization process and consequently leads to reduction in biochar yield (Tripathi et al., 2016). Pyrolysis temperature had a positive correlation with pH, surface area, basic functional groups, fixed C content, biochar stability, and ash content, whilst having a negative correlation with biochar yield, O and H mass fractions, acidic functional groups, volatile matter, and total content of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur and the number of surface functional groups (Ahmad et al., 2012; Al-Wabel et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2018). Physicochemical properties of biochar can be enhanced via physical, chemical and biological activation processes (Sewu et al., 2019). Physical activation occurs at relatively higher temperatures using steam, carbon dioxide, or other suitable oxidizing agents and no post-activation washing step is required (Tan et al., 2017). As the one of the simplest processes, steam activation was found to improve the adsorption performances (Chakraborty et al., 2018), increase the surface area, pore volume and porosity (Sewu et al., 2019), decrease biochar polarity by degrading the carboxyl and phenol functional groups (Shim et al., 2015), but do not change biochar hydrophilicity (Sewu et al., 2019). Chemical activation, which occurs at lower temperatures require the use of dehydration chemicals such as zinc chloride, potassium hydroxide, and phosphoric acid – which may raise environmental concerns – thus require a washing step after activation. Chemical activation has the potential to make biochar form more favorable functional groups and discard undesirable groups (Sajjadi et al., 2018). However, chemical activation is still carried out at high temperatures with chemicals used being more expensive than physical activation but yields biochar products with higher specific surface area (Ngan et al., 2019). Anaerobic digestion can be an effective biological treatment on biomass prior to production of biochar. The biochar produced from treated biomass had higher pH value, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity, less polarity, and more negative surface charge as compared with biochar from untreated biomass. The reason could be due to that the digestion process can alter the redox potential and pH values of the feedstock biomass (Inyang et al., 2010). Detailed reviews of biochar modification had already been discussed by Wang et al. (2017a) and Wang and Wang (2019). The International Biochar Initiative (IBI) strictly suggests that biochar being characterized before utilizing for certain objectives (IBI, 2015). The selection of proper characterization methods is important to provide sufficient and reliable knowledge of biochar properties for its application. Proximate analysis (moisture and ash content, fixed carbon, volatile matter) are performed based on standard procedures in ASTM, ISO, BSI, and DIN. The composition of elements in biochar is commonly determined by elemental analysis (C, H, O, N, S) where samples are combusted at excessive oxygen and the products (CO2, H2O, NO2, etc.) are collected for calculating composition of each elements. Biochar stability can be basically examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) based on monitoring biomass loss under elevated temperature. Biochar functional groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonate, alkane, aromatic, alcohol, ester, ether, ketone) are characterized by Fourier transform inferred (FT-IR) spectroscopy. More detailed biochar structures, organic and inorganic compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XRPE), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Igalavithana et al., 2017). Inductive coupled plasma (ICP) – optical emission spectroscopy (OES) or mass spectrometry (MS) is preferred to quantify inorganic components (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, S, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Ni, etc.) in biochar digested or extracted solutions (Sun et al., 2019c). Biochar specific surface area (SSA), micro-/macro pore volume can be determined using N2 sorption isotherm. SSA is commonly calculated based on BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) equation. Micro-/macro pore volume can be calculated based on Dubinin – Radushkevich equation (Igalavithana et al., 2017). Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Taskin et al., 2019), some other basic properties of biochar such as pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), buffering capacity had been characterized for specific applications (Sun et al., 2018a; Sun et al., 2018b; Yuan et al., 2011). A comprehensive review of current status of biochar characterization can be found in literature (Igalavithana et al., 2017). It is worth noting that except for soil amendment, few instructions have been published by international organizations on biochar production and characterization for other emerging applications in bioprocessing and biomass refinery. Table 2 lists an overview of biochar from different feedstocks for applications in soil amendment, wastewater treatment, and emerging applications such as gas adsorption, organic waste composting, bioprocessing for production of biogas, bio-hydrogen, bio-based ethanol, butanol, fatty acids, and biomass refineries for tar and bio-oil upgrading, production of hydrocarbons and biodiesel."
4,Biochar use in anaerobic digestion,
5,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production Anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of waste materials for production of hydrogen is an eco-friendly bioprocess. Hydrogen can be directly combusted to make electrical power or thermal energy without producing harmful by-products. Studies on enhanced anaerobic digestions amended with biochar have become an active research topic in recent decades (Sharma and Melkania, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017a; Shen et al., 2016; Kanjanarong et al., 2017; Mumme et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017). Biochar addition was reported to enhance cumulative H2 production by four-fold in a co-culture of Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli in anaerobic digestion of municipal solid wastes (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). During the process, composition of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) changed and total production of VFAs increased with elevated loading of biochar. These changes after biochar application were attributed to biofilm formation on the surface and porous structure of biochar. Enhanced H2 production was also attributed to the reduced inhibition by ammonium that was adsorbed onto the biochar (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). Fe-containing hydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme for H2 production in anaerobic digestion and suitable pH between 5.0 and 7.0 is critical for the Fe-containing hydrogenase (Zhang et al., 2017a). It was reported that the addition of both Fe2+ and biochar reduced the lag phase by half and increased H2 yield by 48%. The reasons for the enhancement in H2 production were attributed to 1) appropriate Fe2+ concentration, which improved hydrogenase activity; 2) well-developed biochar surface and porous structures that provided support for biofilm formation; 3) compounds in biochar used as nutrient supply; and 4) pH buffering from biochar provided suitable pH level (between 5.0 and 7.0) for cell growth and H2 production (Zhang et al., 2017a). Therefore, biochar affects H2 production from anaerobic digestion by changing both abiotic and biotic conditions."
6,Methane production,"3.2 Methane production Anaerobic digestion of sludge is an economic and environmental friendly way to dispose organic wastes and generate energy. Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion typically contains 50–70% of methane (CH4), 30–50% of CO2 and trace amounts of H2S and NH3 (Shen et al., 2016). Biochar from corn stover (CSBC), pinewood (PWBC) and white oak (WOBC) had been reported to facilitate anaerobic digesters for biogas production, and all these biochars were found to enhance substrate consumption, biogas production and process stability (Shen et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2016). In addition, the micro- and macro- nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg and Fe) released from biochar to the digestate added more value to the sewage sludge as a fertilizer. The enhanced CH4 production in biochar amended digesters was to some extend attributed to removal of CO2, H2S and NH3 by their physical–chemical interaction with biochar. CO2 generated during anaerobic digestion amended with biochar was converted to HCO3 −/CO3 2− buffer by reacting with biochar released alkali and alkaline compounds and produced NH3 (Shen et al., 2016). H2S is highly corrosive compound and removal of H2S by biochar started when H2S gas was absorbed on biochar surface, followed by a series of oxidative reactions to HS−, S0 or SO4 2− (Kanjanarong et al., 2017). Besides, the enrichment of acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms’ community in biochar amended digestate also contributed to the enhanced biogas production. Shen et al. (2017) performed a year-long two-stage anaerobic digestion with biochar to fully understand the long-period development of microbial community interacted with biochar. The digester amended with biochar improved abundance of acetogenic species Firmicutes (mainly Clostridia) and methanogenic species Methanosarcina. The carbohydrates present in sewage sludge were converted by Clostridia to acetate, which was then metabolized to CH4 by Methanosarcina. The biofilm formation on surface and inside the porous structure of the biochar contributed to enrichment and synergy of the two microorganism species. The possible mechanisms of biochar amended anaerobic digestion are featured in Fig. 1 . Cases of methane enhancement in anaerobic digestion had been reported in various studies. Shen et al. (2016) used pine wood and white oak wood biochar as additives in biogas production from sludge under anaerobic digestion. In the study, biochar addition increased the methane content in biogas by 92.3% and 79.0% for pine wood and white oak wood biochar, respectively. Those two biochars also increased the CO2 sequestration in biogas by 66.2% and 32.4% and inhibited NH3 evolution during biogas production. Sunyoto et al. (2016) and researchers observed increases in H2 and CH4 productions by 31.0% and 10.0%, respectively, caused by the addition of biochar during anaerobic digestion of carbohydrates food wastes. Moreover, biochar addition also increased volatile fatty acids generation besides enhanced H2 and CH4 production, which was considered due to that biochar serves as a temporary substrate and pH buffers for microbial growth in the digester (Sunyoto et al., 2016). Biochar from pyrolysis (pyrochar) and hydrothermal carbonization (hydrochar) had also been evaluated in anaerobic digestion for biogas production (Mumme et al., 2014). The researchers showed that hydrochar significantly enhanced biogas yield, which might be due to conversion of bioavailable carbon fraction of the hydrochar into methane (Mumme et al., 2014). However, the inhibitory effect of ammonia on biogas yield could be avoided using pyrochar only when the ammonia concentration was low (e.g., 0.5 g kg−1), while inhibition by high ammonia concentrations (e.g., 1.5, 2.5, and 5.0 g kg−1) on biogas yield was not reduced either by pyrochar or hydrochar (Mumme et al., 2014). One theory of reduced inhibition from ammonia could be due to the alkalinity of biochar, which could contribute to shifting of ammonia-ammonium dissociation equilibrium and reduced concentration of undissociated ammonia, which is toxic to microbes (Mumme et al., 2014). Another possible mechanism for the relieved inhibition from ammonia and improved cell growth and product formation could be the support of biochar surface for biofilm formation, which makes the microbes robust enough to resist ammonia inhibition and facilitate metabolisms compared to suspended microbes (Mumme et al., 2014)."
7,Generation of medium-chain carboxylates,"3.3 Generation of medium-chain carboxylates Medium-chain carboxylates (MCC) such as hexanoate (C6) and caprylate (C8) are valuable commercial chemicals that can be converted to biofuels (Liu et al., 2017). The MCCs can be produced from anaerobic digestion during microbial chain-elongation (CE) process and their enhancement occurs when the digester is amended with biochar. Liu et al. (2017) reported improvement of hexanoate and caprylate production by addition of PWBC to anaerobic sludge from a paper wastewater digester. Hexanoate and caprylate formation in the digestate treated with pine biochar were enhanced by about 50% and 100%, respectively, after 100 h of incubation, compared to digestate without biochar treatment. H2 and CO2 productions were also significantly enhanced during the chain elongation process. The biochar in the digestate was considered to initially attract microbes by electrostatic adsorption followed by biofilm formation. The dense biofilm formation provides effective defense against toxicity of undissociated carboxylic acids. Besides, the tightly and closely attached microbes of different phyla have more opportunity to perform electron transfer for oxidation of alcohol and reduction of acetate to butyrate which was then converted to hexanoate and caprylate (Liu et al., 2017)."
8,Effects on microbial community,"3.4 Effects on microbial community Microbial community profile in anaerobic digestion (AD) process was typically identified via high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosome RNA of the mixed culture in digestate (Liu et al., 2017; Mumme et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2017). Bacteria were mostly predominant over archaeal in anaerobic digester, with the main phyla being Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Thermotogae (Shen et al., 2017). Clostridia are the major classes of Firmicutes that are able to consume simple carbohydrates and also recognized as syntrophic bacterial to assist acetate oxidation. However, the diversity of archaeal in AD is relatively low with Methanothermobacter being the dominant methanogen to metabolize acetate to methane. Clostridia and Methanothermobacter were found being enriched in biochar-amended digester, the improved microbial activities of which accounted for the overall enhanced methane yield (Shen et al., 2017). Biochar with large surface area and porosity can cause random collision with microorganisms followed by physical entrapment and secretion of cell surface protein or extracellular polysaccharides that assist biofilm formation. Biofilms are tightly clustered microorganisms which could facilitate electron transformation among syntrophic species and defend against toxic compounds by blocking their infiltration through the biofilm (Liu et al., 2017). With the formation of biofilm in biochar, microorganisms could be robust enough to resist inhibition from substrate limitation, low pH, and high content of ammonia in anaerobic digestion (Mumme et al., 2014). Syntrophic interactions in electron transport among different species in densely formed biofilm increases chances of oxidation and reduction and have been considered to promote chain-elongation process during AD (Liu et al., 2017). pH buffering capacity of biochar could not only alleviate drastic pH decrease due to acidification in early stage of AD but also improve pH instability caused by formation of ammonia at the later stage (Pan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017b). Volatile fatty acids (mainly acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids) are the major contributors to pH drop during AD and were reported to inhibit methanogenic bacteria. The addition of biochar significantly reduced inhibition and improved the AD process for methane production (Wang et al., 2017b). Besides, the alkalinity of biochar facilitated carbonization of CO2 to HCO3 − and CO3 2− which could also be used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens for methane production (Jang et al., 2018). Free ammonia nitrogen (FAN) in anaerobic digester is more toxic to microorganisms than ionized ammonium (NH4 +) and typically accumulated at later stage of AD (methanogenesis occurred) with increase of cultural pH. The pH buffering capacity of biochar was considered to mitigate the effect of large accumulation of FAN and hence improve methane yield (Pan et al., 2019). A recent study also indicated that biochar was more likely to benefit microorganisms under stress or inhibition (mostly methanogens such as Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta) than the well-functioned microorganisms (Shao et al., 2019), further elucidating the possible mechanisms behind biochar amended AD process."
9,Biochar use in composting,"Composting is an effective and prevalently used method for converting organic wastes (e.g. animal manure, sewage sludge) into value-added fertilizer which can be safely used in agricultural land and less-fertilized soil. Recent advances of biochar facilitated composting had shown advantages in improving compost physiochemical properties and reducing toxic compounds and emissions. These improvements were achieved via both abiotic interactions and enhanced microbial activities in biochar-compost mixture (Godlewska et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017)."
10,Effects on compost physical properties,"4.1 Effects on compost physical properties Addition of biochar can fill the space between solid composting materials and reduce the heat losses. Therefore, biochar amended composting typically can achieve higher temperature than composting without biochar (Zhang et al., 2016). The higher microbial activity due to appropriate habitat and physical barrier biochar provided could in turn generate more heat to speed up the heating process. The increased temperature is therefore favorable for thermophilic microbial activity and results in higher degradation of organic compounds and oxygen utilization in shorter period of time (Czekała et al., 2016). This could explain in some studies that compost with biochar reached a higher temperature much faster (Pandit et al., 2019; Sánchez-Monedero et al., 2019) and maintained a higher temperature (>50 °C) longer (Chen et al., 2010) than compost without biochar. Besides, higher temperature could be more efficient to eliminate pathogens during composting, resulting in a healthier and pathogen-free final compost when used as organic fertilizer (Casini et al., 2019). Moisture content between 50 and 60% is considered to be appropriate for composting (Gajalakshmi and Abbasi, 2008). Low moisture content can lead to low microbial activity while high moisture content disrupt proper air flow inside the compost. Moisture loss can be big issue during composting. However, addition of biochar can reduce the moisture loss during composting (Pandit et al., 2019) due to water holding capacity in biochar that could maintain a proper moisture level for extended and high microbial activity (Li et al., 2015). Besides, raw materials containing high moisture content when mixed with dried biochar can also be used in composting without external energy input. pH is critical value during composing and its profile reflects the biochemical changes of the processing. The pH of the compost typically decreased at the initial stage due to the organic and inorganic acids accumulation by degradation of organic matters. The generation of ammonia at the later stage caused the raise of pH (Casini et al., 2019). The effect of biochar addition on pH profile of composting varies from different studies. Chen et al. (2010) observed that composting with biochar had lower pH profile during thermophilic phase while higher pH profile in mesophilic and maturing phase was obtained as compared to pH of composting without biochar. The initial lower pH in compost with biochar could be due to more acids production from enhanced decomposition of organic matter by biochar-induced higher microbial activity, while the later higher pH was attributed to retaining of accumulated ammonia via biochar absorption instead of direct loss through volatilization. However, higher pH was also reported in biochar-amended compost during thermophilic phase compared to compost without biochar (Sánchez-Monedero et al., 2019) which could be due to release of alkaline and alkali earth compounds from biochar that created buffering effect and dampened the acidifying conditions during thermophilic phase. Biochar in composting also undergoes certain significant changes in its physicochemical properties which result from intensive abiotic oxidation and microbial activities (Godlewska et al., 2017). Such changes include increase of acidic functional groups (e.g. carboxylic group) and CEC among others. Besides, the change of minerals and metals profile in biochar during composting relies to large extent on the quantity difference of these elements between biochar and composting material (Godlewska et al., 2017)."
11,"Changes of compost organic matter, nutrients and pollutants","4.2 Changes of compost organic matter, nutrients and pollutants Decomposition of organic matter in the compost is mainly dominated by microbial metabolism. Addition of biochar in composting could improve organic matter degradation by modifying porous structures and bulk density of the composted pile and therefore enhanced aeration required for aerobic microorganisms (Sánchez-Monedero et al., 2019). Besides, the decomposition of organic matter generates inhibitory molecules such as NH3, H2S, NH4 + and SO4 2− which in turn impedes the process. Adsorption of these undesirable molecules to biochar significantly improved the composting process (Vandecasteele et al., 2016). Compared to composting without biochar, the biochar-amended composting had higher content of humic and fulvic acids, which contributes to its higher stability when used as fertilizer (Jindo et al., 2016). K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and PO4 3− are critical macronutrients that are beneficial for growth of plants (Pandit et al., 2019). Composting with biochar had been demonstrated to alter the profiles of these elements in the final compost (Zhang et al., 2016). Biochar is a rich reservoir of macro- (Na, K, Ca, Mg, K, S, P) and micro- (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, etc.) nutrients. Some of these nutrients are water soluble while others are not but can be released after neutralization by organic and inorganic acids accumulated during the processing (Sun et al., 2019c). Amendment of biochar to composting could increase the total macro-nutrients in the final compost by their release from biochar and meanwhile their retention within biochar via adsorption, and therefore improve the nutritional value of the final compost as organic fertilizer (Pandit et al., 2019). Besides, anions such as Cl− can also be released from biochar and are favorable ions for plant adsorption (Zhang et al., 2016). Some elements in compost such as Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, Pb, and Hg are recognized as heavy metals and usually reach to considerable high level, which could be detrimental to plant health when applied as fertilizer. Biochar amendment could reduce the mobility of the heavy metals and reduce their bioavailability to plants (Ignatowicz, 2017). The possible mechanisms include physical adsorption, complexion, precipitation, electrostatic interactions and ions exchange. Organic pollutants especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are commonly existed in sewage sludge. With biochar addition, the bioavailability of PAH in sewage sludge can be reduced, which promoted plant root growth and relieved inhibition to plant reproduction when used as fertilizer (Stefaniuk and Oleszczuk, 2016). The PAH reduction in biochar amended sewage sludge could be due to physical adsorption resulting from affinity of PAH to aromatic binding site in biochar. Biochar amended compost could also assist in reducing emission of CH4, N2O and NH3, which are considered as direct or potential greenhouse gases. Compost after adding biochar could significantly improve the porous structure of the composted pile with enhanced aeration which could suppress microbial activity of methanogen (generate CH4) and promote that of methylotrophs (consume CH4) (Wu et al., 2017). Reduction of N2O in biochar-amended compost was due to the binding of nitrate (NO3 −) or nitrite (NO2 −) compounds to biochar, making them less available for microbial denitrification. Besides, iron and manganese on biochar surface could serve as catalyst for direct reduction of nitrate to N2 (Kammann et al., 2015). NH3 is usually released during degradation of nitrogen-containing organic matter. Reduction of NH3 emission from composting can be beneficial both in reducing potential greenhouse gases and retain nitrogen source for high quality fertilizer. Biochar addition to compost could reduce NH3 emission by adsorption of free NH3 and creating preferred environment for nitrifying bacteria to transform NH3 to NO3 − (Malińska et al., 2014). However, it should be noted that the dosage of biochar applied is critical in determination of the NH3 emission (biochar loading usually above 5% to achieve noticeable NH3 reduction)."
12,Biochar use in fermentation process,
13,Syngas fermentation,"5.1 Syngas fermentation The hybrid gasification-syngas fermentation is a promising technology for producing eco-friendly biofuels and platform chemicals (Devarapalli and Atiyeh, 2015; Pardo-Planas et al., 2017). This technology also provides a reliable pathway for disposal of carbon-rich waste materials with minimum adverse influence on the environment (Sun et al., 2019b; Wainaina et al., 2018). Syngas is the major product of gasification with biochar as byproduct. Biochar can provide mineral and metal nutrients, and pH buffer for microorganisms. The use of biochar in syngas fermentation largely reduced the use of expensive pure chemicals as nutrients and buffer in the fermentation medium, resulting in a reduction of the total production cost. Biochars from various sources and production methods have different properties. For successful bioprocessing, it is critical to determine the composition and characteristics of biochar before use. The use of biochar with microorganisms to make various products unlocks its potentials as low cost nutrient supplement with environmental benefits. Biochar has the potential use as low-cost medium component in syngas fermentation because of its high pH buffering capactiy and rich minerals and metals content that can be used as nutrients (Fig. 2 ). In recent studies, biochar from switchgrass (SGBC), forage sorghum (FSBC), red cedar (RCBC) and poultry litter (PLBC) were incorporated in syngas fermentation media for ethanol production by C. ragsdalei (Sun et al., 2018a) and butanol production by C. carboxidivorans (Sun et al., 2018b). Compared to standard yeast extract (YE) medium, C. ragsdalei produced 16% and 59% more ethanol in media containing RCBC and PLBC, respectively. The same microorganism consumed 69% more H2 and 40% more CO in PLBC medium compared to YE medium (Sun et al., 2018a). Media with PLBC and SGBC enhanced ethanol production by C. carboxidivorans by 90% and 73%, respectively, and butanol production by four fold compared to YE medium without biochar (Sun et al., 2018b). The enhancement of biofuel production can be explained in two aspects. Elemental analysis of media during fermentation showed that PLBC had the highest release of Na, K, Ca, Mg, S and P elements compared to SGBC, FSBC and RCBC media. These elements support growth and metabolism of cells. In addition, significant amounts of Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn in PLBC medium were released during fermentation, which was caused by neutralization of undissociated acetic acid accumulated during acetogenic phase. The neutralization of undissociated acetic acid, which is inhibitory to acetogens, slowed the rate of pH drop, reduced “acid stress” on cells and extended the acetogenic phase (Sun et al., 2018a). This resulted in accumulation of more acetate that was later converted to ethanol or butanol (Sun et al., 2018b) (Fig. 3 )."
14,Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) fermentation,"5.2 Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) fermentation ABE fermentation is a commonly used biological route alternative to petro-chemical route for production of acetone and butanol (Ezeji et al., 2003). Acetone and butanol both are commercially valuable products used as solvents and precursors for manufacture of other chemicals. Besides, butanol has been considered as a “drop-in” biofuel that has the potential to replace or mix with gasoline without many modifications of current car engine and fuel distribution systems (Brito and Martins, 2017). Medium for ABE fermentation contains substrates (usually fermentable sugars such as glucose and xylose), mineral and metal nutrients, and buffer. The cost of the medium can affect economic feasibility of the whole processing. A recent study used biochars from different sources to replace expensive minerals and buffer in ABE fermentation medium (Sun et al., 2019a). Biochar from switchgrass (SGBC), forage sorghum (FSBC), red cedar (RCBC) and poultry litter (PLBC) each at loading rate of 2 % (w/v) was supplemented to medium without expensive 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer and mineral stock solution. Medium with rich nutrients containing MES buffer and minerals and deficient medium without MES buffer and minerals were used as controls. Both controls were free of biochar. It was shown that medium with each of SGBC, FSBC, and RCBC had no significant difference with rich medium in cell growth, glucose consumption, productions of acetone and butanol. However, cell growth, glucose consumption and products were severely limited in control medium without MES buffer and minerals. This study demonstrated that biochar can replace expensive MES buffer and minerals in medium for ABE fermentation, resulting in medium cost reduction by 84% compared to rich medium without biochar (Sun et al., 2019a). Biochar amended ABE fermentation had also shown enhanced productivity of butanol and hydrogen by Clostridium beijerinckii (Wu et al., 2019). In this study, biochar was considered serving as barrier and carrier for the microbes to attach and form biofilm, which could contribute to higher butanol tolerance and more efficient utilization of substrate for energy conservation and metabolisms in the microbes (Wu et al., 2019). Further studies are still needed to thoroughly explore the biochar application in ABE fermentation."
15,Hydrolysate detoxification,"5.3 Hydrolysate detoxification Production of ethanol and butanol from lignocellulosic biomass requires removal of inhibitory compounds such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), coumaric acid, syringic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, and cinnamaldehyde generated from hydrothermal or thermochemical pretreatment of biomass because such compounds can severely inhibit enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent microbial fermentation (Klasson et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015a; Liu et al., 2015b). The biochar’s adsorption ability due to its high surface area and porosity allowed the removal of the inhibitors from aqueous environment. To achieve better removal efficiency, biochar is usually subjected to physical or chemical activation to increase surface area and porosity. Klasson et al. (2013) used flax shive derived activated biochar to amend the acid-pretreated switchgrass hydrolysate. The activated biochar at 5% (w/v) dosing rate removed furfural and HMF by 89% and 83%, respectively. The fermentation of the detoxified hydrolysate to ethanol resulted in significant reduction in lag phase. Lee et al. (2011) reported that activated carbon with 2.5 wt% loading amended to hydrothermal pretreated hardwood chips resulted in removal of 93% of furfural, 96% of HMF, 42% of formic acid, 14% of acetic acid and about 9% of fermentable sugars. The removal of above inhibitors before fermentation improved ethanol yield. Diallo (2014) showed that hydrolysate from steam-exploded poplar amended with poultry litter biochar (PLBC) was converted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to ethanol faster than that without PLBC amendment. The ethanol productivity was two times higher in PLBC amended hydrolysate than non-amended hydrolysate. Besides, maximum growth rates were 47%–66% higher in biochar amended medium compared to medium without biochar. The reason for the higher ethanol productivity and growth rate was due to adsorption of lignin-derived microbial inhibitory compounds (LDMICs, including furfural and HMF) by PLBC. It was also reported that adsorption efficiency of furfural by biochar-derived activated carbon was pH dependent whereby the highest adsorption efficiency was occurred at pH around 5.9. Besides, the carbon loading rate, initial furfural concentration, contact time, and temperature also affected furfural adsorption efficiency (Sahu et al., 2008). Therefore, detoxification of media used in microbial processing with biochar or activated biochar is an important approach to improve growth and microbial metabolisms for a more efficient bioprocessing."
16,Biochar-based catalysts used in various biomass refining processes,"Biochar-based catalysts are used in various biomass refining processes, such as biomass hydrolysis and dehydration (Cao et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2017), biodiesel production (Dehkhoda et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2015), biomass pyrolysis (Ren et al., 2014), bio-oil upgrading (Nguyen et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2014), tar removal (Luo et al., 2018; Shen, 2015), and the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons from syngas (Yan et al., 2013), etc. Detailed information can be found in related reviews (Cao et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2017). The application of biochar-based catalysts in biomass refining represents a more sustainable and more integrated process. This is because biochar is a common byproduct of biomass refinery, and use of it can improve the economics of the whole process."
17,Hydrolysis and dehydration,"6.1 Hydrolysis and dehydration As effective solid catalysts in biomass hydrolysis and dehydration, biochar activation and functionalization are required. Activation is to increase surface area and porosity of biochar, which can be achieved through physical or chemical route (Cao et al., 2017). Physical activation occurred during an extended pyrolysis with temperature above 700 °C where steam or CO2 or their mixture can further erodes the carbon materials via C-H2O and C-CO2 reactions. Chemical activation is conducted by treating biochar with acid (H3PO4 and H2SO4) or base (KOH) followed by increased temperature under inert atmosphere. Since the chemicals used are corrosive, erosion to biochar material to form porous structures can be readily achieved especially under high temperature. Chemical activation is considered more efficient in creating higher surface area and porosity than physical activation. However, washing steps are needed for chemical activated biochar which are energy-intensive and cause environmental issues. Biochar functionalization is typically achieved by introducing acidic functional groups such as –SO3H and –COOH by sulfonation using concentrated sulfuric acid (Xiong et al., 2017). Biochar-based catalysts have been successfully used in hydrolysis and dehydration of lignocellulosic biomass (Xiong et al., 2018). Hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose with biochar catalyst cleaved glycosidic bonds of polysaccharides (e.g. glucan and xylan) and generated reducing sugars (e.g. glucose and xylose) (Li et al., 2013). These sugars can be further dehydrated by sulfonated biochar catalyst to furfural (Deng et al., 2016) and HMF (Cao et al., 2018). Compared to enzymes or acids and bases, biochar-based catalysts are less-expensive, can be easily separated for reuse, and generate less environmental issues."
18,Pyrolysis and gasification products upgrading,"6.2 Pyrolysis and gasification products upgrading Biochar-metal catalysts are commonly used in syngas upgrading, tar removal and bio-oil reforming, and prepared by pre-loading metal precursors (e.g. Ni2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, or Fe3+) on the biomass before or after pyrolysis. This is usually achieved by impregnating pre-pyrolyzed biomass with aqueous solution of the metal precursors which are absorbed onto biomass surface. After pyrolysis of the metal-impregnated biomass, the metal precursors are converted to their oxides (e.g. NiO, CuO, MgO, or Fe2O3) nanoparticles concurrently with biochar formation, generating the biochar-supported metal catalysts (Cao et al., 2017). The metal precursor impregnation can also be directly applied to biochar followed by a brief heat treatment, which also generate effective biochar-metal catalyst (Nguyen et al., 2016). The porous structures developed on biochar could not only disperse metal nanoparticles but also entrap reactants, resulting in high catalytic activity of the biochar-metal catalyst. Biochar has been used as a catalyst to upgrade bio-oil to commercially valuable hydrocarbons. Nguyen et al. (2016) used a biochar-Ni catalyst to treat the bio-oil from pyrolysis of algae biomass. The bio-oil after treatment with biochar/Ni catalyst was effectively upgraded to mainly n-heptadecane (accounted for 76% of all produced hydrocarbons) which is an important diesel fuel component. Biochar without metal pretreatment also showed promising efficiency in upgrading bio-oil (consists of mainly guaiacols and aliphatic compounds) into valuable product containing mainly phenols and hydrocarbons (Ren et al., 2014). Biochar has also been demonstrated to be effective as a catalyst in liquid and gaseous fuel production from biomass. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis clearly showed that biochar-based iron (Fe) nanoparticles were successful as a catalyst for conversion of syngas into liquid hydrocarbons with olefin as dominant product (Yan et al., 2013).Moreover, biochar-supported ruthenium (Ru) catalyst was successfully used for syngas methanation where CO and CO2 were converted to CH4 at high conversion efficiency under sufficient hydrogen supply (Wang et al., 2014). Different from volatile vapors (CO2, H2O, CH4, HCN, etc.), tars are condensable organic fractions of the thermochemical conversion products and contain aromatic hydrocarbons with higher molecular weight. Tars are difficult to clean and handle, leading to clogging issues during the thermochemical process. Tars can be catalytically converted to CO and H2 by cleave of C–C bonds in heavy hydrocarbons. CO2 can be generated via water–gas shift reaction when steam is present during reforming (Shen, 2015). Biochars from pine bark and rice straw had shown capability of catalytically decomposing tarmodel compounds(i.e. toluene, phenol and naphthalene) (El-Rub et al., 2008; Mani et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014b). Different types of biochar such as wood derived charcoal and corn stover derived biochar were found to enhance the syngas yield and decreased the heavy hydrocarbons in bio-oil and tars from different feedstocks (e.g. pinewood, fir sawdust) (Gilbert et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2011). Biochar from wastewater solids as a catalyst can reduce bio-oil yield by approximately 10–20%, meanwhile increasing the mass fraction of syngas (Liu et al., 2018). The catalytic effect of wastewater solid biochar for the destruction of tar model components could be due to its inherently high content of Fe and Ca nanoparticles that enhanced the catalytic effect of biochar used."
19,Biodiesel production,"6.3 Biodiesel production Biodiesel, or mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids, is a renewable and alternative liquid fuel to petroleum based diesel fuel. It is produced from processing of vegetable oil or animal fat with alcohols and catalysts. The processing steps involve two major reactions, transesterification (Eq. (1)) and esterification (Eq. (2)), preference of which depends on the ratio of triglycerides and free fatty acids (Fig. 4 ) (Dehkhoda et al., 2010). Biochar has been used as a solid acid catalyst for biodiesel production. One example is utilizing sulfuric acid-pretreated biochar to catalyze transesterification of canola oil and esterification of waste vegetable oil with alcohol (Dehkhoda et al., 2010). Observations by Dehkhoda et al. (2010) indicated that the efficiency of biochar catalytic activity and reusability depends on the surface area and acid density of biochar during biodiesel production. The study also showed that the higher surface area in biochar and a longer sulfonation time could lead to the higher catalytic activity in transesterification of canola oil and methanol, resulting in more biodiesel production. The particle strength, hydrophobicity, and density of the sulfonic acid groups also govern the efficacy of biochar-based solid acid catalysts (Dehkhoda et al., 2010; Kastner et al., 2012). Besides, biochar-based catalyst can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction system for potential reuse, and prevent costly neutralization procedures during reactions (Kastner et al., 2012). The sulfonated biochar based catalyst also showed promising catalytic activity for the combination of transesterification and esterification reactions in a mixture of canola oil and oleic acid (Dehkhoda and Ellis, 2013). The enhanced esterification and transesterification was reported to be due to protonation of carboxylic and carbonyl groups in free fatty acids and triglyceride molecules, respectively, on acidic sites of sulfonated biochar (Dehkhoda and Ellis, 2013). It was also shown that increasing the alcohol to free fatty acid molar ratio at constant alcohol to oil ratio led to a continuously increasing reaction yield and thus improved biodiesel production. Oleaginous microalgae with its fast growth rate, high lipid contents, and environmental friendly nature has gained much attention in biodiesel production. The sulfonated biochar catalyst had also been used to catalyze pre-esterification of microalgal oil with free fatty acids and methanol followed by alkali-catalyzed transesterification (Dong et al., 2015). It was suggested that the removal of chlorophyll and phospholipids is necessary to avoid catalyst degradation when using crude algal oil as feedstock. Besides, the biochar catalyst can be separated easily from the reaction system and was reported to be reused for ten cycles without much activity loss (Dong et al., 2015)."
20,Future perspectives,"Biochar, a by-product form pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization and gasification, enhanced methane, hydrogen and medium-chain carboxylates productions from anaerobic digestion, improved nutrients profile of fertilizer production via composting, demonstrated huge potential in pure-culture microbial fermentations by behaving as low-cost buffer, mineral and metal source, and served as efficient catalyst in biomass refineries due to its unique physicochemical properties. This review provides insights of current status of biochar production, characterization and utilization in facilitating biofuels and chemicals production. More potential and novel applications of biochar require better understanding of different biochar physiochemical properties formed as response of biochar sources and producing methods. Besides, different physiochemical properties of biochar are beneficial to different processing. For example, pH buffering capacity is useful for pH sensitive bioprocessing where acid-producing strains (e.g. clostridia species) are involved. Exchangeable minerals and trace metals in biochar could supplement or replace nutrients required for microorganisms. High surface area, porosity and functional groups can provide protective habitats for enrichment of productive microbes, and catalytic sites for physical–chemical reactions involved in biomass gasification, pyrolysis, esterification and transesterification. Electrical conductivity of biochar can also assist oxidation and reduction during biological processing (Fig. 5 ). Enhancing certain properties of biochar via proper selection of feedstock and production parameters for certain biological or chemical based processing could improve conversion efficiency and productivity of products of interest. Fungi and microalgae are two other important organisms that could decompose natural resources (e.g. lignocellulosic biomass) and capturing atmospheric CO2, respectively, for production of protein-rich biomass and other value-added products such as enzymes, lipid, bio-polymers, etc. (Fig. 5). However, biochar use in bioprocessing with fungi and microalgae are rarely reported and could be future direction towards bio-products economy with low-carbon footprint. To develop better knowledge and understanding of relationships between biochar and its potential applications, consistent and repeatable experimental testing with biochar characterizations are essential. Moreover, there is a need to understand the degree of natural variations in chemical and structural properties of biochar and to develop strategies for mitigating and/or minimizing the potential impacts of natural variations on the characteristics of biochar materials. While there is a rich body of existing knowledge on structures of various scales in biomass (e.g. wood anatomy), little is known as to how these structural features may be retained when biomass is transformed into biochar either pyrogenically or hydrothermally, and how this transformation is affected by carbonization process conditions. These challenges call for close collaboration among scientists and engineers who specialize in relevant fields from environmental science and natural resources to chemical and biochemical engineering."
21,Conclusions,"Biochar has long being used in soil amendment. However, recent advances of biochar applications in anaerobic digestion, microbial bioprocessing, and cheap catalysis in biomass refinery and biodiesel synthesis have brought new insights for biochar use. These processes with facilitation of biochar showed improved performance in productions of methane, hydrogen, medium-chain carboxylic acids, and enrichment of functional microbial communities; enhanced biofuel (ethanol, butanol) production from microbial fermentation of C1 gases and carbohydrates; efficient catalysis in refining of syngas and bio-oil during thermochemical processing and synthesis of biodiesel during esterification and transesterification. Biochar utilization could promote low-carbon footprint economy in the future."
