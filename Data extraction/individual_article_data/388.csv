0,Introduction,"In recent years, hydrogen has become a clean and renewable energy. Hydrogen production from non-fossil fuels is very important because of the energy consumption increasing, population growth, and the probability of energy crisis in the world. The abundance of the primary resources, the low releasing of pollutants, the reversibility of production cycle, and the decreasing of greenhouse effects are the properties that make hydrogen an especial fuel. Hydrogen can be generated through clean ways without air pollution increasing [1]. The sacrificial reactants for H2 production are divided to the organic and inorganic reactants [2]. S2−/SO3 2–, Fe2+, H2S, Br–, I–, CN–, and Ce3+ are some examples of the inorganic sacrificial reactants, and alcohols, acids, aldehydes, and sugars are the examples of organic ones. Cargnello et al. [2] discussed the recent developments in the use of the biomass-derived oxygenated compounds, such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and sugars. Photocatalytic degradation of alcohol is a neat way for hydrogen generation. In this process, irradiation to photocatalyst separates the electrons, and the remained positive holes are the strong oxidants. Methanol is largely used as sacrificial agent in photocatalysis, and it is attractive compound due to its high reactivity, structural simplicity, and absence of C–C bonds [2]. Photogenerated electrons react with the protons and produce hydrogen molecules. TiO2 nano photocatalyst is a highly active photocatalyst. It is a remarkable catalyst in hydrogen production from alcohol due to its biological and chemical characteristics, being nontoxic, its high photocatalytic activity and its stability. Due to electron-hole recombination, TiO2 nanostructures generally exhibit the low hydrogen production efficiencies. To decrease the electron-hole recombination, two different approaches are mainly used: 1) A sacrificial organic agent is adding to the reacting solution. It reacts with photogenerated positive holes and prevents electron-hole recombination. 2) Using metal particles such as Rh, Au, Pt, Ni, Pd, and Cu on the TiO2 surface inhibits electron-hole recombination. The Fermi levels of these metals are lower than that of TiO2, and the electrons can be transferred to them, while the holes remain on the TiO2. Therefore, the possibility of electron-hole recombination is reduced. The availability, cheapness, and high efficiency of hydrogen generation are the reasons which make methanol and Cu species as the suitable compounds for hole scavenger and TiO2 surface modifier, respectively [3-7]. Choi and Kang [8] showed that the CuO species on the surface of anatase TiO2 improve the H2 production via methanol/water photodecomposition. In another study [9], they found the H2 production in the methanol photodecomposition system reaches 16,000 mol after 24 h over Cu.TiO2 with a rutile structure. Montini et al. [10] observed photocorrosion under solar-like irradiation, and minor leaching under UV irradiation. They showed after a few hours, the amount of Cu ions becomes constant. This suggests that at this time, the Cu photodeposition process and the leaching phenomena reach to the equilibrium. Ampelli et al. [11] studied H2 production from ethanol and acetaldehyde using CuOx/TiO2 nanocomposites. They investigated three different routes to prepare CuOx/TiO2 nanocomposites by copper photodeposition on TiO2. Their results showed the H2 production efficiency is related to the modification of TiO2 by Cu2+ ions. Artioli et al. [12] showed that the structural and morphological properties of the CuO nanostructured thin films are effective parameters for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In a good review, Konstantinos et al. [13] studied the current progress, the challenges, and the future research directions in the field of photocatalysis hydrogen production by Cu-based photoactive materials. They indicated photocorrosion of Cu nanoparticles and CuxO is a major issue. They suggested we need to obtain further insights into mechanistic aspects and reaction pathways to increase the catalytic efficiency. In 2010, Gombac et al. [14] investigated hydrogen production by photocatalytic reforming of ethanol and glycerol with the use of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalyst. Their results indicate Cu-TiO2 materials have a considerable Cu leaching under oxidizing conditions. They showed by Cu photodeposition under UV irradiation, the copper leaching is minimized. In another study, they [15] synthesized Cu nanoparticles, surrounding by TiO2 matrix, and proved this catalyst is successful for enhanced hydrogen production from water/methanol solution. Barreca et al. [16] studied the role of Cu in photocatalytic H2 production, and they proved that the control of the system morphogenesis is vital for H2 production on the supported Cu2O and CuO catalysts upon irradiation with UV and even visible light. In 2016, Clarizia et al. [4] studied the kinetics of hydrogen generation from methanol on TiO2, in the presence and in the absence of Cu ions. The researchers showed that adding Cu ions to TiO2 and methanol solution can increase the efficiency of hydrogen production. The system seems complex and it can have equilibrium between Cu ions and Cu nanoparticles, photo corrosion and photodecomposition. Finding further insights into mechanistic aspects and reaction pathways can help us to increase the efficiency of H2 production by this system. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques which is used to design experiments, and optimize processes [17-19]. The optimization methods are useful to increase the yield of reactions. RSM is one of the successful methods for optimization. Recently, we showed that using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation and RSM together is an appropriate method to optimize heterogeneous catalytic reactions with lowest cost [19, 20]. Chemical kinetic simulator (CKS) is a vital tool to determine the process mechanism and kinetic parameters of chemical reactions [21-23]. Design of experiment (DOE) method analyzes the result (output) variations by making significant variations in process input [24]. The combination of simulation and experiment design can be a useful approach to solve problems influenced by variable factors [19]. In this study, we are going to simulate the hydrogen generation from methanol in an aqueous solution containing cupric ions and TiO2 nano photocatalyst using KMC and RSM. Using chemical kinetic simulation, the process mechanism and the rate constants of elementary steps will be determined. The effects of five factors initial concentration of methanol, irradiance, reaction time, initial concentration of Cu ions, and TiO2 concentration on the hydrogen generation process will be investigated."
1,Method,
2,Simulation method,"2.1 Simulation method In 1960, a kind of Monte Carlo algorithm was provided to study the chemical kinetics. In 1990, a collection of the modified Monte Carlo algorithms for kinetics study was formed in title kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). KMC has different algorithms, and one of them was presented by Gillespie [25]. Gillespie developed a numerical method to simulate the statistical evolution of the chemical systems by changing time. In this research, for the KMC simulation based on Gillespie algorithm, the chemical kinetic simulator (CKS) package, version 1.01 (from IBM, Almaden Research Center, http;//www.Almaden.ibm.com/st/msim/), has been used [26]. In this package, a group of the possible elementary reactions is considered. In this algorithm, a collection of reactions is considered. For a first-order reaction, a i is used to show the rate of reaction as follows: (1) a i = k i C i Here, k i is the rate constant of reaction step, and C i is the concentration of i specie. In the simulation algorithm, the system considers one reaction each time. a is the summation of the rate of all possible reactions in the reaction list: (2) a = ∑ i M a i At each step, two random numbers are generated, which are distributed between zero to one. The first random number (r 1) is used to calculate the time of each step (τ). (3) τ = 1 a In ( 1 r 1 ) By generating the second random number (r 2), the reaction ‘n’ will be selected using the following equation. (4) ∑ i = 1 n − 1 a i < r 2 a ≤ ∑ i = 1 n a i The selected reaction is considered and the concentrations of reaction species are changed. This algorithm shows a single time step in the KMC simulation. The events lists are updated in the result of each time step, and this procedure is repeated to recognize (realize) the next step. These steps are repeated until closing the simulation time to the real-time [25, 27]. Until now, this stochastic simulation method has been utilized to simulate several chemical reactions [23, 28, 29]. In this research, we have used this method to study the mechanism of hydrogen generation from methanol in an aqueous solution containing Cu ions and TiO2 nanocatalyst."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design The design of the experiment is utilized to achieve helpful information about the effect of variables, and the optimum value of some operation variables [30]. The combination of RSM with central composite design (CCD) is a practical, economic, and accessible approach for the design of experiments [17]. This technique doesn't need a large number of design points, and it is one of the common methods for the design of experiment, which usually includes three steps: (1) design of experiments, (2) RSM through regression, and (3) optimization. The quadratic polynomial equation presented in Eq. (6) is utilized to correlate the independent operation variables, and the responses variables: (5) y = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 k β i x i + ∑ i = 1 k β i i x i 2 + ∑ ∑ i < j β i j x i x j + ε where, β 0 is the intercept term, and β i , β ii, and β ij are linear, quadratic, and interaction coefficients of the variables, respectively. In this equation, x i and xj show the variables; k is the number of variables; ɛ is error, and y is the predicted response. The coefficient of determination (R2) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to measure the accuracy of the model. The contour plots are applied to study the effect of variables, and the interactions among them [31]. In this research, Design Expert software (ver. 7.0.0) is used, and a CCD with α = ± 2.37841 is utilized to investigate the effect of variables. Previously, we used RSM and dynamic Monte Carlo simulation for studying the kinetics and mechanism of hydrogen production by formic acid decomposition on Ni(100) [20] and Cu(100) [19]."
4,Results and discussion,"In this section, the experimental data of an article about hydrogen production from methanol using TiO2 nano photocatalyst and Cu ions were used [3]. They studied the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from methanol utilizing TiO2 in the aqueous solution either with or without Cu ions. Their results showed the amount of produced hydrogen in the presence of Cu ion is more than its absence. The experimental data have been used to obtain a suitable and comprehensive mechanism for this system. To find the best mechanism for this process, different mechanisms were examined. The first one was the provided mechanism by Clarizia and his co-workers [3], and a good fitting between the simulated and experimental data wasn't seen. Then, several mechanisms were examined, and the best one, which showed the best fitting with empirical data, was obtained. For the experimental study [3], Cu ions were added to the solution, 30 min after starting the reaction. Therefore, we provided the mechanism for the reaction in an aqueous solution either with or without Cu ions. At the first 30 min of reaction, there is no Cu ion in the solution, and then, by adding Cu ions to solution, some steps were added to the mechanism. Correlation coefficient between the simulated and experimental data for the first thirty minutes of reaction and after that was obtained (R2 = 0.9995). The perfect fitting confirm the provided mechanism for the reaction. In the first step, UV irradiation on the TiO2 nano photocatalyst makes a couple of electron-hole. (6) Ti O 2 + h v → e − + h + + Ti O 2 Three effective irradiances at 305, 313, and 366 nm were used in the reactor of Clarizia et al.’s research (2.56 × 10−6, 2.70 × 10−6, and 3.30 × 10−6 Einstein.s−1) [32, 33]. Therefore, the rate constant of this step was obtained using the following equation: (7) k 1 = ∑ i = 1 3 I i 3 here, I i is the effective irradiance. The produced electrons and holes in the reaction (7) can be recombined again. (8) e − + h + → Light In the next reversible step, methanol is adsorbed on the active sites of the nano TiO2 surface. (9) C H 3 OH + Site ⇌ C H 3 O H ( ads ) Then, the adsorbed methanol reacts with the hole, and H+ is produced. (10) C H 3 O H ( ads ) + h + → C H 3 O ( ads ) + H + The produced H+ ions are adsorbed on the active sites of the TiO2 surface and react with electrons to generate H•. (11) H + + Site → H + ( ads ) (12) H + ( ads ) + e − → H • Then, the reaction among CH3O(ads), H+, and H• makes the active site and H+. (13) C H 3 O ( ads ) + H + + H • → Site + C H 3 O + 2 H + The active sites can be released by generating the hydrogen molecules. (14) 2 H • → H 2 + 2 Site In the presence of Cu ions, three steps will be added to the provided mechanism. The Cu ions in solution are adsorbed on the active sites of TiO2 surface and then, they react with electrons. Transferring electron from the TiO2 surface to Cu surface causes depositing of Cu, and releasing the active site. (15) Cu ( II ) + Site ⇌ Cu ( II ) ( ads ) (16) Cu ( II ) ( ads ) + 2 e − ⇌ Cu + Site Methanol has an important role in the reduction of Cu ions. It reacts with the hole as seen in reaction 14 and prevents the electron-hole recombination. Then, the remained electrons cause the reduction of Cu ions, as seen in reaction 17. Some experimental results showed that Cu-TiO2 materials have a considerable Cu leaching [14], therefore, an establishment of Cu/Cu ions equilibrium is considered in the mechanism. (17) Cu ⇌ Cu ( II ) + 2 e − Some other steps and producing some other intermediates such as formaldehyde [4] and HCOO− have been examined. Establishment of equilibrium between formaldehyde species in the liquid phase and on the surface was examined, too. By using these steps, a good fitting between the simulated and experimental data wasn't seen and that steps were not considered in the mechanism of this system. The rate constants of the three first steps were reported by Clarizia et al. [3]. The rate constants of the other steps and the number of active sites of TiO2 nano photocatalyst (dose = 150 mg.L−1) were obtained as the adjustable parameters by fitting the simulated and empirical kinetic data. The proposed mechanism and rate constant of each step are represented in Table 1 . The number of active sites on the empty surface of TiO2 (with dose 150 mg.L−1) was obtained as 7 × 10−2 M. The overall reaction mechanism is: (18) 2 C H 3 OH + 2 Site + 2 Cu ( II ) → H 2 + 2 Cu + 4 h + + 2 C H 3 O In this mechanism, one mole of hydrogen is generated by the consumption of two moles of methanol. Input data for simulation are temperature (25 °C), concentration of TiO2 nano photocatalyst (TiO2 dose = 150 mg.L−1), initial concentrations of methanol, and Cu ion ([CH3OH]0 = 2.47 M, [Cu(II)]0 = 0.24 mM), initial concentration of H+ ([H+]0 = 10−7) [3], initial concentration of active sites on catalyst surface ([Site]0 = 7 × 10−2 M), the steps of mechanism and their rate constants. The experimental time for this reaction was 120 min and Cu ions were added to the reacting solution after 30 min. Therefore, we simulated the system in the two following steps: 1) The first 30 min of reaction using the mechanism without Cu ions. 2) The next 90 min of reaction using the mechanism in a solution containing Cu ion. The obtained concentrations of species after 30 min, in step 1, have been used as the initial concentrations for the second step, and are reported in Table 2 . The comparisons between the simulated results in the first (first 30 min) and the second (next 90 min) steps with experimental data is shown in Fig. 1 . The perfect correlation coefficient (R2) between simulated and experimental data was obtained as 0.9995. In the following, the KMC and RSM will be used to study the effects of variables on the yield of hydrogen generation by methanol using TiO2 nano photocatalyst and Cu ions."
5,Central composite design (CCD),"3.1 Central composite design (CCD) In this research, Design-Expert software (version 7.0.0) has been used to study the effects of five variables initial concentration of methanol (A), irradiation (B), reaction time (C), Cu ions concentration (D), and TiO2 concentration (E) using CCD with α = ± 2.37841. Using some empirical articles, the ranges of variables have been determined [7, 10, 34-37]. The actual and the coded values of independent variables are shown in Table 3 . Fifty different conditions for fifty simulation runs were provided by Design-Expert program. The designed conditions of CCD were used as the input of simulation. The “hydrogen generation efficiency” is used as the response variable (R 1) and it was calculated as follows: (19) Hydrogen generation efficiency % = The amount of produced hydrogen The initial amount of methanol × 2 × 100 The coefficient of 2 in this equation demonstrates two moles of methanol are used to generate one mole of hydrogen. The designed experiments with CCD matrix and the response variables related to each simulation of this research are shown in Table 4 ."
6,Regression model and statistical analysis,"3.2 Regression model and statistical analysis A quadratic model was utilized to correlate the coded independent operation variables, and the response variable proposed the following model using evaluation 6: (20) R 1 = 0.033 − − ( 9.227 × 10 − 3 ) A + ( 8.402 × 10 − 3 ) B + 0.011 C + ( 2.886 × 10 − 3 ) D + ( 4.049 × 10 − 3 ) E − ( 1.932 × 10 − 3 ) AB − ( 2.773 × 10 − 3 ) AC − ( 6.798 × 10 − 4 ) AD − ( 1.082 × 10 − 3 ) AE + ( 2.851 × 10 − 3 ) BC + ( 7.666 × 10 − 4 ) BD + ( 1.126 × 10 − 3 ) BE + ( 8.497 × 10 − 4 ) CD + ( 1.336 × 10 − 3 ) CE + ( 2.073 × 10 − 5 ) DE + ( 3.168 × 10 − 3 ) A 2 − ( 3.302 × 10 − 4 ) B 2 − ( 5.849 × 10 − 5 ) C 2 − ( 1.070 × 10 − 3 ) D 2 − ( 1.005 × 10 − 3 ) E 2 Here, R 1 indicates the response variable, A, B, C, D, and E are the initial concentration of methanol, irradiation, time of reaction, Cu ions concentration, and TiO2 concentration, respectively. AB to DE are the interactions among variables, and A 2 to E 2 are the second-order effects of each variable. This equation shows irradiation, time of reaction, Cu ions concentration and TiO2 concentration have a positive effect, while the initial concentration of methanol has a negative impact on the response. Also, the time of reaction (C) has the most significant effect on the response. Time of reaction and irradiation (BC), the initial concentration of methanol and time of reaction (AC), and the second-order effect of the initial concentration of methanol (A 2) have the essential effects on the response. ANOVA results of this model are reported in Table 5 . P-value < 0.0001 and F-value = 94.49 demonstrate the good accuracy of this model. A good correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9849) shows the variability of the response can be explained with the effective variables and interactions among them. This model explains 98.49% of the changes of the response, and it is not able to explain 1.51% of changes. The pred R-square of 0.9320 is in a reasonable agreement with the Adj R-square of 0.9745. C.V% = 8.41shows all of the experiments were completely done with high accuracy. The Adeq precision measures the signal to noise ratio, and the ratio greater than four is desirable. The ratio of this model is 42.430, which indicates an adequate signal. The Pareto analysis calculates the percentage effect of each variable, and interaction among them on the hydrogen generation efficiency, according to the following equation [38, 39]: (21) P i = ( b i 2 ∑ b i 2 ) × 100 i ≠ 0 here, Pi is the effect percent of each variable, and b i is the coefficient related to each variable in the developed model. The Pareto graphical analysis for the response is represented in Fig. 2 . As seen in this Figure, time of reaction (C) is the most significant variable on hydrogen generation efficiency. Then, the initial concentration of methanol (A), irradiation (B), TiO2 concentration (E) and Cu ions concentration (D) have effect on the response, respectively. Then, time of reaction and irradiation (BC), the initial concentration of methanol and time of reaction (AC), and the initial concentration of methanol and the initial concentration of methanol (A2) are the essential interactions between variables. They have the same effects on the response."
7,Investigation of diagnostic and perturbation plot,"3.3 Investigation of diagnostic and perturbation plot The plot of the predicted data by model versus the simulated data (diagnostic plot) is shown in Fig. 3 . The predicted values are distributed almost around a 45° line, and it offers a high ability in predicting the response variable. The perturbation plot, which investigates the effects of five variables in design space, is shown in Fig. 4 . In this plot, the response variable is plotted by changing one variable, while other variables are kept constant. The amounts of variables are the initial concentration of methanol = 5.75 M, time = 275 min, irradiation = 3.5 Einstein.s−1, Cu ions concentration = 236.64 µM, and TiO2 concentration = 13.85 mM. As shown in Fig. 4, time is the most effective variable on the yield of hydrogen production. Cu ions concentration is the least effective variable on the response. As seen in Fig. 4, by increasing the initial concentration of methanol, hydrogen generation efficiency will be decreased. The lower initial concentration of methanol has more hydrogen generation efficiency and by increasing it, its adsorption on the photocatalyst occurs, and the empty active sites on the TiO2 surface decrease. It causes less efficiency of the reaction. The positive slope of the plot B shows that by increasing irradiation, R 1 value raises. Actually, by increasing irradiation, the rate constant of the first step increases, and more electron–hole pairs are produced, so that hydrogen generation increases. The positive slope of plot C indicates by passing time, more hydrogen is produced, and hydrogen generation efficiency increases. The positive slope of plot D shows that R 1 raises by increasing Cu ions concentration. By increasing the concentration of Cu ions, more Cu ions adsorb on the surface. It causes consuming more electrons, and the amounts of vacant active sites decreases, so that hydrogen generation increases. The positive slope of plot E indicates by increasing TiO2 concentration, more hydrogen is produced, and hydrogen generation efficiency increases."
8,Effect of variables as response surface plots,"3.4 Effect of variables as response surface plots Three-dimensional surface plots have been used to investigate the effects of the interaction among five variables on the hydrogen generation efficiency. Each of these plots is plotted using the developed model. In the design space, two variables change simultaneous and other variables are constant. The used constant values are the initial concentration of methanol = 5.75 M, time = 275 min, irradiation = 3.5 Einstein.s−1, Cu ions concentration = 236.64 µM, and TiO2 concentration = 13.85 mM. Fig. 5 (a) shows the simultaneous effect of initial concentration of methanol and irradiation on R 1. As shown in this Figure, the most amount of R 1 is obtained at the most amount of irradiation and the least amount of initial concentration of methanol. At the low concentration of methanol, there are many active sites on the TiO2 surface, and it can be separated easily. By irradiation increasing, hydrogen generation increases. As shown in Fig. 5(b), hydrogen generation efficiency increases by the time increasing, and the initial concentration of methanol decreases. According to Fig. 5(c) and (d) the most amount of R 1 can be seen in the high concentration of Cu ions and the low concentration of methanol and high concentration of TiO2. As Fig. 5(e) shows the high amount of R 1 is obtained at high irradiation and time. At low irradiation, fewer amounts of e− and h+ are generated, and hydrogen generation increases over time, but it is small. According to Fig. 5(e)–(j), the high amount of hydrogen production is obtained by irradiation, more time, high values of Cu ions, and high concentration of TiO2."
9,Response optimization,"3.5 Response optimization In this section, the Design Expert program has been used to achieve the optimum value of the response variable. Two sets of the favorite optimum values for variables were selected. To check the accuracy of results, the system was simulated at the optimum conditions. The amount of variables, and the predicted and calculated values of the response at the optimum conditions are reported in Table 6 . The calculated values are very close to the predicted values, which shows a reasonable accuracy and validity of the developed model with RSM. Increasing Cu ions in the solution until a certain amount has a positive effect on hydrogen generation efficiency, and then, it has a negative impact. The obtained amount of hydrogen generation efficiency is 0.133%. In the experimental research of Clarizia et al., the amount of generated hydrogen in a solution containing methanol 0.001703 M has been reported, and the amount of hydrogen generation efficiency was attained as 0.009% [3]. Therefore, the hydrogen production efficiency increases almost fourteen times. This result shows that using RSM and KMC together is a useful and constructive method to find the optimum conditions of a photocatalytic reaction."
10,Conclusion,"In this study, KMC and RSM have been applied to study the kinetics of hydrogen generation from methanol in the solutions containing TiO2 nanocatalyst either with or without Cu ions. By studying different mechanisms for this process, the favorite mechanism was obtained for hydrogen generation in this system. The rate constants of the mechanism steps, which give us the best fitting with empirical data, were obtained. RSM based on CCD has been used to study the main square and the interaction among the independent variables initial concentration of methanol, irradiation, time, Cu ions concentration, and TiO2 concentration. The initial concentration of methanol has a negative effect on the hydrogen generation, and a less amount of methanol has the most hydrogen generation efficiency. The reaction time and irradiation have positive impact on hydrogen generation efficiency. The time of reaction is the most significant variable on hydrogen generation in this system. The optimum conditions were obtained at the initial concentration of methanol 3.13 M, irradiation 5.98 Einstein.s−1, time of reaction 392.41 min, Cu concentration 252.79 µM, and TiO2 concentration 22.75 mM. The hydrogen generation efficiency at the proposed optimum conditions was obtained as 0.133%. It is about fourteen times higher than the empirical hydrogen generation efficiency (0.009%). The result shows that using KMC and RSM together is a low-cost and suitable method to increase the yield of photocatalytic reactions."
