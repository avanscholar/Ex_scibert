0,Introduction,"Recently, semiconductor-based photocatalysis has drawn intensive attention due to the serious environmental deterioration and the energy risks. In recent years, metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been the hotspot of photocatalysis owing to its exciting characteristics of low cost, facile preparation, good stability, excellent optical and electronic properties [1]. And g-C3N4 possesses the medium band gap energy of 2.7 eV, which is corresponding to the blue light region up to 450 nm. The suitable band gap and the thermal as well as chemical stability make g-C3N4 become a potential leadership in photochemistry and photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the pristine g-C3N4 exhibits an inefficient utilization rate for visible light and also suffers from the high recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, thus resulting in the unsatisfactory photocatalytic performance [2]. Therefore, there is still huge room for the enhancement of the photocatalytic properties for the pristine g-C3N4. Fabrication of porous g-C3N4 with higher specific surface area is one of the most efficient methods to improve the photocatalytic performance. And it is worth mentioning that the porous structures could result in the acceleration of mass transfer, the improvement of the light harvesting ability and the generation of sufficient reaction sites [3]. On the other hand, chemical doping is a commonly used way to modify the electronic characteristics and the surface properties of semiconductors, and extend their light absorption region [4]. In recent years, a large amount of heteroatoms doped g-C3N4 have been successfully developed and are being reported, for example, C, S, P, Fe and Mo doped g-C3N4 [5–9]. And the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of these doped g-C3N4 catalysts have been improved dramatically. Moreover, compared with the mono-atom doped g-C3N4, co-doping of g-C3N4 is currently a growing avenue, which could further promote the performance of the pristine g-C3N4 [2,10]. In addition, the introduction of intrinsic point defects (nitrogen defects) into the g-C3N4 framework caused by the carbon self-doping results in the significant improvement of the photocatalytic performance under the visible light illumination [11,12], So we suspect that introducing carbon-rich materials into the thermal condensation process of melamine would be propitious to the development of the defective structure. Because the vacancies would always bring novel impurity levels into the semiconductors, the narrower band gaps could be obtained [13]. Furthermore, nitrogen deficient g-C3N4 photocatalysts are also being successfully fabricated, and an efficient photocatalytic performance are obtained, which illustrates the feasibility of the hypothesis [14,15]. Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to simultaneously integrate the advantages of these modification methods about g-C3N4 through a facile and cost-effective strategy. Herein, we develop a novel fabrication route to prepare the porous P and Mo co-doped g-C3N4 with feeble nitrogen vacancies, labeled as (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx. The photocatalytic hydrogen production ability of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx could be substantially enhanced after adding EY dye and reaches as high as 118 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 6.6 times that of EY-sensitized pristine g-C3N4. The composite also possesses a high reduction efficiency of Cr(VI). Based on the above results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed. And it is expected that this work would pave a new way for the development of low-cost and high-performance photocatalysts."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Melamine(C3H6N6, 99%), Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O, 99%), and Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate(C3H35O4P, 95%) were all purchased from Shanghai macklin Biochemical Co.Ltd, and being directly used without further purification."
3,"Synthesis of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx","2.2 Synthesis of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx Typical preparation of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx was prepared by consulting the method being reported previously with some modifications [9]. Firstly, 12.6 g melamine (C3H6N6), 2.279 mL C3H35O4P (P204) were added into 80 mL of absolute alcohol under the constant stirring for about 4 h at 80 °C, followed by evaporation(60 °C) under continuous shaking. Then, the white samples were being further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. Secondly, the above white solid was grinded into powder, and then being dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water in the company of 0.529 g H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O. The mixture was under constantly stirring until a homogeneous solution was being obtained. Then the above solution was being poured into the evaporating dishes placed in an oven at 180 °C to dry out water completely. After a cooling procedure, the resulted sample was put into a crucible with a cover and being heated in air at 550 °C for 4 h at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. For the purpose of comparison, P-g-C3Nx, Mo-g-C3N4 and the pristine g-C3N4 were also fabricated similarly by using P, Mo precursor or in the absence of both precursors, respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples were recorded on the X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Y2000, Dandong, China) using Cu kα X-ray irradiation. And the morphology of the samples was determined by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS ULTRA 55, Germany) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-1400PLUS, Japan). The Brunauer Emmett Teller(BET) specific surface areas(SBET) of the as-prepared samples were analyzed using a nitrogen adsorption apparatus(ASAP 2020, USA) with all the samples degassed at 150 °C for 8 h under flowing N2 prior to measurements. And the pore size distributions were determined by the Barret-Joyner-Halenda method. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were determined by a FT-IR spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet 6700, USA) using the standard KBr disk technique. And X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo Scientific spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250, USA) with Al kα radiation as the excitation source operated at 150 W. The UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (UV–vis, DRS) of the samples were obtained by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-3010, Hitachi, Japan) with 100% BaSO4 as the background at room temperature. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (PL, F-2700, Hitachi, Japan) at ambient temperature."
5,Photocatalytic H2 production activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production activity Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were carried out at ambient temperature in a 280 mL Pyrex reaction cell with an efficient irradiation area of ca. 15.1 cm2 connected to a glass closed gas circulation system. A typical photocatalytic reaction was conducted by dispersing 10 mg of the as-prepared samples in a 100 mL aqueous solution containing triethanolamine (TEOA) (5 Vol.%) and 17.5 mg eosin Y (EY). A 300 W xenon Lamp (PLS-SXE300BF, Beijing, Trustech) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the light source, and the light intensity is 150 mW/cm2. Before the visible light irradiation, the system was degassed by bubbling N2 gas for 15 min to ensure the anaerobic conditions in the reaction. And the aqueous temperature was maintained around room temperature upon a flowing of cooling water during the photocatalytic reaction. Finally, the amount of H2 evolution was measured every hour using gas chromatography (GC-9560, shanghai, huaai chromatography Technology Co., Ltd) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using Ar gas as the carrier gas."
6,Photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction measurement,"2.5 Photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction measurement The photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction experiments of the as-prepared catalyst were carried out in the photocatalytic reactor, the light source was a 300 W xenon Lamp (PLS-SXE300BF, Beijing, Trustech) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. In each photocatalytic test, before the visible light irradiation, the mixture containing 40 mL K2Cr2O7 aqueous solution (100 mg/L) and 0.03 g tartaric acid (hole scavenger agent) as well as 0.05 g of catalyst was being stirred constantly for 1 h to ensure the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. During the reaction, 3 mL of the suspension was being taken out at given time intervals(0.5 h) and then centrifugated to isolate the photocatalyst, the residual concentration of Cr(VI) was reflected by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan), detected at the main characteristic absorption peak of Cr(VI) (540 nm)."
7,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements The transient photocurrent responses of the as-prepared samples were measured on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660E) in a standard three-compartment cell with a working electrode. And the working electrodes were prepared as follows: 5 mg of the as-obtained photocatalyst was suspended in 1 mL of water to form slurry, which was then being dip-coated onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode (1.0cm2). Afterwards, the electrodes were being placed in air atmosphere for about 12 h to fully eliminate water and subsequently calcined at 200 °C for 5 h. A platinum wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as a counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. And 0.1 M Na2SO4 was served as the electrolyte solution."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The chemical structures of the as-prepared samples are first tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As shown in Fig. 1 , the XRD patterns of all samples exhibit two feature diffraction peaks at 27.5° and 13.2°, which are assigned to the (002) and (100) crystal planes of g-C3N4, representing the typical interfacial stacking and the in-plane structural packing motif [16,17]. The unchanged features of the modified samples indicate that the primordial atomic structure is being largely obtained. Nevertheless, the overall diffraction intensities of the modified samples become much weakened, especially for Mo-g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx. The results suggest that the Mo species are embedded into in-planes and chemically coordinated to the g-C3N4 matrix, most likely in the form of Mo-N bonds [8,10,18] and the structural correlation length of interlayer periodicity is decreased significantly. The FT-IR spectra for samples are depicted in Fig. 2 , and the spectra for four samples are extremely similar with each other. The sharp band at 810 cm−1 typical for the breathing mode of heptazine rings is exhibited in all samples [14]. The peaks locked from 900 cm−1 to 1800 cm−1 are corresponding to NCN heterocycles in the “melon” framework, whilst multiple broad peaks between 3000 and 3600 cm-1 originate from the NH stretching vibrations [14]. And the weaker intensity between 900–1800 cm−1 is caused by the destruction of NCN heterocycles. And the development of the less defined and broad band at 3000–3600 cm−1 can be assigned to the formation of a more dense structure resulting from the interaction of P204 and the supramolecular precursors [19,20]. The FT-IR spectrum of the doped samples resembles g-C3N4 in the related characteristic bands, suggesting that the graphitic-like structure is remarkably well-preserved after modification. However, for P-g-C3Nx and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx, the new band revealed around 950 cm-1 is attributed to the stretching mode of PN [20]. Fig. 3 a depicts the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) results. Notably, compared with the pristine g-C3N4, the modified ones show a remarkable red shift, which is attributed to the successful introduction of P, Mo or N defects. And the influence could also be reflected by the color change of the as-obtained samples more intuitively (Fig. 3a insert). The bandgaps of the samples are determined by the Kubelka-Munk function, the results are shown in Fig. 3b. And the bandgaps of the pristine g-C3N4, P-g-C3Nx, Mo-g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are calculated to be 2.73, 2.44, 2.17 and 2.10 eV, respectively. The above results indicate that this modification accompanied by the specific porous nanostructures could enhance the ability of photocatalyst to harvest visible light and ameliorate the charge transport and mass transfer, creating a platform for the effective heterogeneous photocatalysis. The XPS survey spectra for P-g-C3Nx and Mo-g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. S1a, b. Compared with the pristine g-C3N4 who only possesses a single peak at 532.6 eV (Fig. S2) which is assigned to the adsorbed H2O, (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx exhibits a new peak located in 531.0 eV (Fig. 4 b), which could be attributed to O2− in molybdenum oxide [21]. XPS C1s spectrum for the pristine g-C3N4 contains two components located at 284.7 and 288.2 eV (Fig. S1c), corresponding to the CC bond and the three-coordinated C atoms (C3C), respectively [22,23]. The modified sample (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx possesses the typical C1s spectrum, but there is an additional peak at around 285.7 eV which corresponds to CN [20]. Interestingly, 288.2 eV signal is weakened compared to the pristine g-C3N4. Apparently, the formation of CN is attributed to the introduction of large amounts of C atoms, resulting in C3C to CN, as shown in Fig. 4c. In Fig. 4d, the typical g-C3N4 N1s could be fitted into three components at 398.7 eV (two coordinated N atoms, N2C), 400.1 eV (three coordinated N atoms, N3C) and 401.1 eV (NHx groups), respectively [14,24]. Comparing the peak area ratio of the N3C to the N2C peak (N3C/N2C), it increases for (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx as compared to the pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. S1d). The results suggest that the large number of N2C vacancies is formed on the surface of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx. The high-resolution P2p and Mo3d spectra give a more direct evidence for P and Mo co-doping into g-C3N4 (Fig. 4e and f). Based on the XPS analysis for (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx, the contents of P and Mo are determined to be 1.58 atom% and 2.15 atom%, respectively. The deconvoluted spectra of P2p reveals three peaks located at about 133.4 eV, 134 eV and 134.9 eV, respectively. The peaks at 133.4 eV and 134.0 eV are typical for PN coordination [25,26], corresponding to PN and PN respectively, which suggests that P atoms might substitute the C atoms in the CN framework of g-C3N4. And the accompanied peak at 134.9 eV (PO) results from the reaction in air at high temperature between P and O2 during the copolymerization reaction [27]. Furthermore, Mo3d peaks of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are discovered at 236.5 eV and 233.3 eV, which are attributed to Mo6+ [28]. On the basis of reports of Fan et al. [29], P from P204 could easily squeeze into the skeleton of g-C3N4 after the thermal treatment because of the reaction between P204 and melamine (Scheme1 ). Meanwhile, according to the previous computational studies about the transition metal embedded g-C3N4 [30], we suspect that Mo6+ are coordinated into the large CN rings upon the N-bridge linking of the triazine units, and the corresponding interpretation is exhibited. Firstly, the atom radius of Mo6+ (about 60 pm) is smaller than that of C (about 70 pm), so Mo6+ could not be doped as an ion state in the substitutional site of C. Secondly, based on the XRD analysis and XPS result, Mo species is doped into the g-C3N4 lattice in the form of Mo6+ by forming Mo-N bonds. It confirms that Mo6+ ions are embedded into the big CN rings upon the N-bridge linking the triazine units in g-C3N4. The main reaction in the synthesis process is shown in Scheme 2 . To interpret the narrower bandgap in the modified samples, valence band (VB) XPS of the pristine g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are employed in Fig. 5 . The VB maximum for the pristine g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are 2.12 eV and 1.50 eV, respectively. The contact difference between the analyzer and the samples is calculated to be ≈1.56 V (0.94 V) (vs. NHE at pH = 7) by using the formula ENHE/V =Φ + 2.12 eV (1.50 eV)-4.44 (ENHE: potential of standard hydrogen electrode, Φ of 3.88: the electron function of the analyzer) [31,32]. The VB-XPS data indicates that the VB position is heavily affected by the modification. Combined with the DRS results above, the conduction band minimum (CBM) potential of g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are calculated to be −1.17 V and −1.16 V, respectively. The results suggest that the modification not only enhance the light absorption, but also still keep the high reduction ability of the g-C3N4. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are applied to investigate the morphology and the microstructure of the as-obtained samples. Fig. 6 a and b show the SEM images of the pristine g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx, respectively. It could be seen that the typical slate-like morphology and the stacked lamellar structure are exhibited in the pristine g-C3N4 sample. In contrast, for (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx, the huge lamellar-like microstructure comprising of the interconnected carbon nitride walls is emerged and much more pores could be observed. And the porous structure of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx could be further confirmed by the TEM analysis. The TEM for the pristine g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are shown in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. Fig. 6c exhibits that the pristine g-C3N4 is composed of the typical layered sheet-like surface morphology. Distinctively, as shown in Fig. 6d, the in-plane mesoporous range from several to tens of nanometers are randomly distributed on g-C3N4 nanosheets. The specific nanostructure for (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx could bring much more active sites and simultaneously could boost the mass transfer and charge carriers separation, thus optimizing the π-conjugated system for practical applications in the field of photochemistry [33,34]. The corresponding elemental analysis of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx tested by energy dispersive spectroscopy is shown in Fig. 6e, indicative of the presence of C, N, P, Mo, which is consistent with the results of the XPS measurements. Nitrogen sorption measurements at 77k are used to test the textual information of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 7 ). The adsorption isotherms for the pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 7a) and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx (Fig. 7b) all possess a type IV with H3 hysteresis loop, which is the characteristic of the typical mesoporous materials on the basis of the IUPAC classification [35]. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (SBET) determined for (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx is 46.02 m2 g−1, which is about 3.0, 2.1 and 1.3 times that of the pristine g-C3N4, P-g-C3Nx and Mo-g-C3N4, respectively. The pore size distribution curves (Fig. 7b inset) reveals that (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are rich in mesopores, and the average pore size is about 29.3 nm, which is smaller than that of the pristine g-C3N4 (about 30.9 nm). The mesoporous materials with high SBET are easier to expose the catalytic sites, thus enhancing the catalytic efficiency dramatically. The transfer behavior and separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers in semiconductors could be reflected by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The PL spectra of the as-obtained catalysts excited by 367 nm are shown in Fig. 8 . Relative to the pristine g-C3N4, the fluorescence signal at approximately 445 nm for (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx debases the intensity, suggesting that the recombination of charge carriers occurring in (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx is largely inhibited. This is attributed to the promoted electron relocalization at terminal sites on surface resulting from co-doping of (P, Mo) and N vacancies as well as specific structure [3,36,37]. And the low recombination rate corresponds to the increased photocatalytic activities and higher quantum yield, which is prerequisite for the excellent photocatalytic ability. And the transient photocurrent measurements are also employed to further qualitatively test the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges during the photoreactions. As shown in Fig. 9 , it can be clearly seen that the prompt and reproducible photocurrent responses are detected during on/off visible-light irradiation cycles in all of the electrodes. Interestingly, the photocurrent responses rapidly decrease to near zero (dark) when the light is off and revert once the light is turned on. Obviously, benefiting from the enhanced light harvesting ability, the photocurrents of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are much larger than that of the three other samples, proving the constructive effect of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx in achieving the more effective charge mobility and separation and photocatalytic activity."
10,Photocatalytic H2 production,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production Now EY has been one of the most important sensitizers of g-C3N4-related photocatalysts for improving the quite limited response to the visible light [36,38]. Therefore, herein, the photocatalytic H2 evolution of the as-obtained samples under visible light irradiation are tested by using triethanolamine (TEOA) and EY dye as the electron donor and the photosensitizer, respectively [39,40]. Fig. S4 compares the photocatalytic H2 evolution ability based on the as-prepared samples upon adding TEOA. The experimental results indicate that the pristine g-C3N4 could hardly produce H2 in the absence of EY under visible light irradiation, and the modified samples also exhibit a poor H2 production performance in the same condition. By comparison, as shown in Fig. 10 , the photocatalytic H2 production increases dramatically after EY incorporated into the photocatalytic system as a photosensitizer. Among which, (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx shows the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate, which is as high as 118 μmol h−1 g−1. And the photocatalytic H2 production rate for the pristine g-C3N4, P-g-C3Nx and Mo-g-C3N4 are 18 μmol h−1 g−1, 63 μmol h−1 g−1, 79 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. The above results demonstrate that the positive sensitization of g-C3N4 by EY during the photocatalytic H2 production process."
11,Photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction,"3.3 Photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction As the classic representatives of heavy metal pollutants, Cr(VI) is often chosen as the model pollutant to appraise the photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples. The results of blank experiment show that Cr(VI) reduction without catalyst is almost negligible. And Fig. 11 a displays the photocatalytic reduction curves of Cr(VI) over g-C3N4, P-g-C3Nx, Mo-g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx samples under visible light irradiation. And (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx possesses the best photocatalytic performance, almost 95% in 2 h, but the pristine g-C3N4 exhibits only 22% under the same condition. Fig. 11b depicts the reaction kinetics curves of the reduction of Cr(VI) fitted with the typical pseudo-first-order model: ln C 0 / C = k t Wherein k represents the apparent reaction rate constant (min−1), t means the irradiation time, C0 and C are the initial Cr(VI) concentration (t = 0) and the Cr(VI) concentration at t, respectively [41]. The rate constants k of g-C3N4, P-g-C3Nx, Mo-g-C3N4 and (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx are 0.0007, 0.00199, 0.00415, 0.0129, 0.0229 min−1, obviously, (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx shows the highest value of k, which is corresponding to the best photocatalytic performance."
12,"Stability evaluation of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx photocatalyst","3.4 Stability evaluation of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx photocatalyst For practical applications, As shown in Fig. 12 , the stabilities of photocatalytic H2 production(a) and Cr(VI) reduction(b) over (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx sample are investigated under visible light irradiation. No obvious deactivation of photocatalytic H2 evolution (Cr(VI) reduction) ability is observed for (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx during 16 h (8 h) reaction, indicating that the as-prepared (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx catalyst is significantly stable during the photocatalytic processes under the visible light irradiation."
13,Possible photocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 Possible photocatalytic mechanism Based on the above results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed. After the defects levels (nitrogen vacancies states, labeled as Nv. states) inducing by carbon self-doping are introduced on (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx, many shallow nitrogen-vacancy states appear above and partly overlap with the valence band (VB) of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx. This could result in rising of the VB maximum and narrowing the bandgap width, making (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx more efficient in the absorption of visible light. The raised VBM is advantageous to the enhancement of the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and more electrons can be excited to the conduction band of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx, thus the photocatalytic performance can be improved. Besides, the specific porous structure could offer more reaction sites for photocatalytic activity. On the basis of the analysis, the redshift of the absorption edge exhibits in Fig. 3a could be easily interpreted. The above three reasons contribute to the increase of the photocatalytic performance of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx. The probable process of photocatalytic H2 production reaction in the EY dye-sensitized (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx catalyst in TEOA aqueous system could be interpreted in the form of Route 1 in Fig. 13 . Under the visible light irradiation, the EY dye molecules could absorb visible light photon to form singlet excited state EY1*, and then produces the lowest-lying triplet excited state EY3* through an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). [38,42] Subsequently, EY3*can be reductively quenched by TEOA (sacrificial donor) to produce EY− and oxidative donor (TEOA+) [42] Then the e− of EY− specie would transfer to the conduction band (CB) of (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx, resulting in the spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The Route 2 in Fig. 13 depicts the possible mechanism of Cr(VI) reduction, in the photocatalytic reaction system, tartaric acid acts as hole scavenger, the surplus electrons will participate in the reaction of Cr(VI) reduction(from Cr(VI) to Cr(III))."
14,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we successfully fabricate porous (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx with feeble vacancies by a simply polycondensation strategy using the environmentally benign precursor (melamine) and cheap sources of P (P204) and Mo (H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O). The obtained (P, Mo)-g-C3Nx exhibits significant improvement both in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution sensitized by EY and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) reduction compares with the benchmark of the pristine g-C3N4 and the single-doped ones. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effects of N vacancies, (P, Mo) co-doping and the porous structure. It is anticipated that this work marks an important step toward designing and optimizing the structure of g-C3N4 upon integrating the advantages of various methods synchronously, and represents a remarkable strategy for fabricating highly efficient photocatalytic materials using inexpensive elements (C, N, P and Mo) rich in nature."
