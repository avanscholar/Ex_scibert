0,Introduction,"By 2050, the human population on Earth is predicted to reach 9 billion, with the current growth rate estimated to be ∼228,000 people day−1. Growing and aging populations create an ever increasing demand for energy, potable drinking water and arable land for food production [1–3]. Modern societies remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas) for electricity generation, transportation and as a cheap source of commodity feedstocks for the chemical industry. Combustion of fossil fuels to produce electricity is the single largest producer of anthropogenic CO2 and thus the principal cause of the global warming. Concerns about the environmental impact of using fossil fuel energy are further compounded by the knowledge that eventually fossil fuel reserves will eventually be exhausted. Accordingly, an enormous amount of research effort is currently being directed towards the development of low cost renewable energy technologies which can 1) lessen our dependence on fossil fuel energy over the next 50–100 years, and 2) eventually replace our existing fossil fuel energy infrastructure. As part of a suite of renewable energy technologies currently under development, semiconductor photocatalysis using sunlight has the potential to make an important contribution via the production of energy carriers such as H2 from water and biofuels, and also CO2 reduction to fuels (e.g. CH3OH or HCOOH) and N2 fixation to generate NH3. Semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2 are already used in many countries for water disinfection (killing bacteria), organic pollutant mineralisation (removal of dyes and pesticides) as well as volatile organic chemical (VOC) abatement. In all of these applications, there are incentives (both practical and economic) to develop photocatalysts with improved activity and stability. For most photocatalytic applications, TiO2 is the photocatalyst of choice due to its modest electronic band gap (3.0–3.3 eV allowing solar excitation), its favourable valence and conduction band edges relative to redox processes of interest (including water splitting), its deep valence band which allows water oxidation to hydroxyl radicals (a key to titania’s action against bacteria and activity for dye degradation), its resistance to photocorrosion and finally its low cost. TiO2 photocatalyst performance is dependent on surface area, crystallite size, crystal shape, surface facets exposed and polymorphic composition, with commercially available Degussa P25 TiO2 (85 wt.% anatase + 15 wt.% rutile, BET surface area ∼49 m2 g−1, Eg = 3.15 eV) widely considered the benchmark against which to evaluate photocatalyst performance. Few TiO2 photocatalysts reported to date exceed the performance of P25 TiO2 under UV excitation, though improvements beyond P25 TiO2 performance levels should be possible through collective optimisation of the various factors listed above which influence the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the archetypal semiconductor photocatalyst and exists in three different polymorphic forms: anatase (I41/amd, a = 3.7845 Å, c = 9.5143 Å, Z = 4, Eg = 3.2 eV), brookite (Pbca, a = 5.4558 Å, b = 9.1819 Å, c = 5.1429 Å, Z = 8, Eg = 3.3 eV) and rutile (P42/mnm, a = 4.5937 Å, c = 2.9587 Å, Z = 2, Eg = 3.0 eV), all of which are based on TiO6 octahedra but different edge and corner sharing arrangements [4,5]. The rutile polymorph is the thermodynamically stable form of TiO2, with both the anatase and brookite forms converting to rutile with heating at high temperatures (typically ∼700–800 °C, though the onset temperature for the transition to rutile may be lower depending on the initial TiO2 crystallite size). Bulk absorption of electromagnetic radiation (E > Eg, where Eg is the TiO2 band gap) generates electron-hole pairs which either (1) recombine or (2) migrate to the TiO2 surface and drive photocatalytic reactions [6]. The valence band of TiO2 is mostly of O 2p character, with the top of the valence band for anatase, brookite and rutile sitting at +2.7, +2.7 and +2.3 V versus NHE, respectively. Accordingly, valence band holes in TiO2 are very strong oxidants, capable of readily oxidising most organic compounds and water (O2/H2O = 1.23 V versus NHE, OH·/H2O = 2.5 V versus NHE) [7–9]. The conduction band of TiO2 consists of Ti 3d states, with the bottom of the conduction band for anatase, brookite and rutile being located at −0.5 V, −0.6 V and −0.7 V versus NHE, respectively. Accordingly, the conduction bands of these different polymorphs are suitably positioned to reduce water or protons to H2 (H2O/H2 = 0.00 V versus NHE), hence the widespread interest in TiO2 for H2 production via solar water splitting and alcohol photoreforming [10,11]. Anatase and brookite are both indirect band gap semiconductors, whereas rutile is a direct band gap semiconductor. Accordingly electron-hole pair separation (and recombination) in rutile following photoexcitation occurs much faster than in the other two polymorphs, which additionally require a phonon (lattice vibration) to assist electron transport across the band gap. Coupling anatase with rutile (as is the case in commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 which is 6:1 anatase:rutile by weight) or brookite with rutile is an excellent strategy for increasing the concentration of charge carriers (electrons and holes) available for photoreactions. In P25 TiO2, electrons photoexcited in rutile can migrate into the conduction band of anatase (offset by +0.2 V relative to CB of rutile), whereas holes in the VB of anatase can migrate into the VB of rutile (offset by −0.4 V relative to the VB of anatase) [12]. This migration of electrons and holes across anatase-rutile heterojunctions has been shown to increase the concentration of available charge carriers available for photoreactions by up to a factor of ∼2 relative isolated anatase and rutile nanoparticles at the same weight ratio (i.e. 6:1) [13,14]. Accordingly, P25 TiO2 consistently demonstrates improved photocatalytic performance compared to anatase, brookite and rutile photocatalysts (rutile alone is poor photocatalyst for most reactions due to it low specific surface area and high electron-hole pair recombination rate). Hydrothermal syntheses at various pH are commonly used to synthesize anatase, brookite or rutile in pure form and with tailored morphologies. Morphologies can be tuned by the addition of crystal shape directing agents (such a fluoride ions), with the aim of increasing the proportion of reactive facets exposed [15–24]. It was initially thought that anatase {001} facets with low Ti cation coordination numbers and high surface energies (0.90 J m−2) were the most reactive surfaces for this polymorph, but subsequent studies confirmed the reactivity order {010} (0.53 J m−2) > {101} (0.44 J m−2) > {001} (0.90 J m−2). The result was counter to expectation, since typically facets with high surface energies are the more reactive. However, the dye degradation tests used to establish this reactivity order consume hydroxyl radicals generated by water oxidation at the photocatalyst surface, with the {010} facets proving superior to the other facets in generating hydroxyl radicals. A large body of research has now been reported targeting the synthesis of anatase, brookite and rutile crystals which preferentially expose a high proportion of reactive low index or high index facets. Whilst this work is of fundamental interest, it rarely yields TiO2 crystals with higher photocatalytic activity than P25 TiO2, due in part to the persistence of the crystal growth directing agents (e.g. such as adsorbed fluoride ions) which block active sites. Alternative synthetic strategies towards highly reactive TiO2 photocatalysts need to be developed, with the preference being for strategies which afford clean TiO2 surfaces. Calcination of hydrogen titanate (H2Ti3O7) nanotubes at temperatures above 500 °C can yield anatase nanoparticles with excellent photocatalytic performance for dye degradation and other reactions [25–31]. Typically, sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) nanotubes are first synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of a TiO2 powder in 10 M NaOH at 150–160 °C for 48 h. H2Ti3O7 nanotubes are subsequently obtained by ion exchange (H+ for Na+) via immersion of the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes in aqueous HCl. Calcination at 400–600 °C for 2–3 h yields anatase nanorods with different surface areas and particle sizes. The effect of calcination temperature on the properties of anatase photocatalysts derived H2Ti3O7 by calcination has been widely studied in relation to aqueous dye degradation, yet few studies have systematically explored the effects of both calcination time can calcination temperature of photocatalyst performance. Almost all studies reported to date used a 2–3 h calcination period at a specific temperature, presumably to increase the crystallinity of the end product. However, flash calcinations at temperatures higher the usual 400–600 °C traditionally used to transform H2Ti3O7 to anatase may be beneficial in preventing losses in surface area caused by anatase crystallite sintering during prolonged heating at 500–600 °C [25,32–37]. A knowledge gap currently exisits in the scientific literature regarding the effect of calcination time on the photocatalytic properties H2Ti3O7-derived anatase. Another notable gap is the lack of studies exploring photocatalytic hydrogen production over M/TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Pt, Au) based on H2Ti3O7-derived anatase, especially in comparison with M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts under the same testing conditions. The few studies reported in this area to date have yielded very promising results. Alcohol photoreforming over M/TiO2 photocatalyst generally affords very high rates of H2 production (typically 20–30 mmol g−1 h−1) compared with water oxidation (∼1 mmol g−1 h−1 at best), due to the superior hole scavenging properties of alcohols. H2 production rates for alcohol photoreforming generally follow the order triols > diols > primary alcohols > 2° alcohols > 3° alcohols >> water. Lin et al. deposited 1 wt.% Pt on TiO2 nanofibers obtained by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at 100–600 °C [32]. The TiO2 nanofiber support obtained by calcination at 400 °C afforded the highest H2 production rate (23.8 mmol g−1 h−1) in methanol-water mixtures under UV. Wang et al. synthesised two series Pt/TiO2 nanofibers; one series prepared by pre-calcination of H2Ti3O7 followed by Pt deposition, the other prepared by Pt deposition on H2Ti3O7 followed by calcination. Hydrogen evolution rates of 10.9–23.9 mmol g−1 h−1 were observed in absolute ethanol under UV excitation, with the Pt/pre-calcination series yielding the higher rates. Dosado et al. recently compared the performance of 0.5–2.0 wt.% Au/TiNT600 photocatalysts (i.e. using an anatase support prepared from hydrogen titanate nanotube calcination at 600 °C for 2 h) and 0.5–2.0 wt.% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in various alcohol-water mixtures under UV irradiation [25]. A 0.5 wt.% Au/TiNT600 photocatalyst afforded H2 production rates of 29.2 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% glycerol, outperforming a 1.5 wt.% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst (27.4 mmol g−1 h−1) under the same testing conditions. For both photocatalysts, H2 production rates at a fixed alcohol concentration of 10 vol.% followed the order glycerol > ethylene glycol ∼ 1,2-propanediol > ethanol > 1-propanol, an order rationalised in terms the relative hole scavenging ability of each alcohol. Interesting, for the Au/TiNT600 photocatalyst the optimum Au loading was 0.5 wt.%, whereas for the Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts the optimum Au loading was 1.5 wt.%. This result suggests that TiO2 powders obtained by calcination of H2Ti3O7 may be advantageous in that they require less precious metal co-catalyst in order to achieve high activity. These promising reports prompt a detailed systematic investigation of the effect of calcination conditions (both temperature and calcination time) on the photocatalytic properties of H2Ti3O7-derived anatase photocatalysts. A current shortcoming of literature relating to TiO2 photocatalysis is the dearth of studies examining the performance of the same photocatalyst(s) in several different photoreactions, such as dye degradation and H2 production. Such studies should be mainstream (even if labour intensive) to allow researchers to accurately gauge the merits of any newly developed photocatalytic material. Here, through a systematic manipulation of H2Ti3O7 nanotube calcination conditions, we sought to fully optimise the photocatalytic activity of the anatase nanorod products for both dye degradation and solar H2 production. This study targeted several key gaps in the scientific literature concerning TiO2 photocatalysts derived from H2Ti3O7 nanotube precursors by calcination. The objectives of this study were fourfold: (1) to characterize in detail the physico-chemical properties of anatase nanorods obtained by calcination of H3Ti2O7 nanotubes at 500–700 °C for different lengths of time (10–240 min); (2) to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the anatase nanorods for methylene blue photo-oxidation in aqueous solution at pH 6; (3) to prepare a series of M/TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au and Pd-Au) using the anatase nanorods, and then evaluate the performance of the M/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in various alcohol water mixtures under UV excitation, (4) to benchmark the performance of the anatase nanorods against the commercially available photocatalyst Degussa P25 TiO2. Through conducting such a systematic study, we hoped to identify calcination conditions will afford highly reactive anatase photocatalysts for the aforementioned reactions."

3,Synthesis of sodium titanate and hydrogen titanate nanotubes,"2.2 Synthesis of sodium titanate and hydrogen titanate nanotubes Sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) nanotubes were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of the bulk anatase TiO2 powder according to the method described by Liu et al. [38]. Briefly, anatase TiO2 powder (6 g) was dispersed in aqueous NaOH (80 mL, 10 M). After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the suspension was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave. This was then put in a convection oven and heated at 150 °C for 48 h. The Na2Ti3O7 nanotube product was collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with milli-Q water until the washings were near neutral, and finally dried at 80 °C for 10 h. Hydrogen titanate (H2Ti3O7) nanotubes were synthesized from the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes by ion exchange. Briefly, the sodium titanate nanotubes were immersed in 1 M HCl (500 mL) for 2 h. The H2Ti3O7 nanotubes were collected by centrifugation, washed with milli-Q until the washings were neutral, and finally dried at 80 °C overnight."
4,"Synthesis of xTiO2(t) (x = 500–700 °C, t = 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min) photocatalysts by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes","2.3 Synthesis of xTiO2(t) (x = 500–700 °C, t = 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min) photocatalysts by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes The xTiO2(t) photocatalysts used in this study were obtained by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at temperatures between 500–700 °C (x = calcination temperature) for different periods (t = calcination time). Hydrogen titanate nanotubes (3 g) were placed in a porcelain evaporating basin, which was subsequently transferred to a muffle furnace preheated to the desired calcination temperature. This approach resulted in the H2Ti3O7 nanotubes achieving the set calcination temperature in ∼ 1–2 min. After calcination for a fixed time, the samples were removed from the furnace and allowed to quickly cool to room temperature."
5,"Preparation of M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au or Pd-Au)","2.4 Preparation of M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au or Pd-Au) M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = 0.5 wt.% Pd, 0.5 wt.% Au or 0.25 wt.% Pd-0.25 wt.% Au) were synthesized by the deposition precipitation with urea method described by Zanella et al. [39]. Briefly, 4.2 mM stock solutions of HAuCl4·3H2O (1.654 g) or PdCl2 (0.745 g) were prepared by dissolving the respective metal salts in milli-Q water (1 L). To assist with the dissolution of PdCl2, HCl (37 wt.%, 5 mL) was first added to the PdCl2 in 20 ml of water, after which the solution was made up to 1 L with milli-Q water. To prepare the 0.5 wt.% Au/xTiO2(t) and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts, the titania support (2 g), Au3+ stock solution (12.5 mL), urea (5.04 g) and milli-Q water (187.5 mL) were added to a 500 ml glass Schott bottle, then heated with constant stirring at 80 °C for 8 h. The obtained pale yellow powders were collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with milli-Q, then air dried at 60 °C overnight. The powders were then calcined at 300 °C for 2 h to reduce surface Au3+ to Au°. For the preparation of the 0.5 wt.% Pd/xTiO2(t) and Pd/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts, Pd2+ stock solution (16.78 mL), urea (5.04 g) and titania support (2 g) and milli-Q (183.22 mL) were added to a Schott bottle, then heated with constant stirring at 80 °C for 8 h. The resulting powders were collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with milli-Q and dried at 60 °C. The obtained powders were then heated to 500 °C for 2 h in a H2/N2 flow (10 vol.% H2) to reduce adsorbed cationic species to the metallic form. A similar procedure was used for the preparation of the bimetallic Pd-Au/xTiO2(t) and Pd-Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts, using appropriate amounts of the Pd(II) and Au(III) stock solutions to achieve the desired nominal Pd and Au weight loadings (both 0.25 wt.%, total metal loading 0.5 wt.%). Reduction at 500 °C for 2 h in a H2/N2 flow was used to transform the cationic species to their metallic form (Pd° and Au°, respectively)."
6,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.5 Photocatalyst characterization UV–vis absorbance spectra were collected over the wavelength range 250–1400 nm on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating sphere attachment. BaSO4 powder was used as a reference. TEM images for xTiO2(t) photocatalysts were collected using a TECNAI 12 transmission electron microscope. Powder samples were dispersed in absolute ethanol and then 1 μl of the resulting dispersion placed on carbon coated copper TEM grids for analysis. HRTEM microanalyses on the M/TiO2 photocatalysts were performed sing a JEOL 2200FS transmission electron microscope equipped with a Field Emission Gun and a High Resolution (HR) lens system. All images were collected at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For bright field HRTEM imaging, the maximum achievable point-to-point resolution was 0.1 nm and was recorded using a GATAN UltraScan1000 4 megapixel (2048 × 2048) CCD camera. STEM/HAADF images were recorded using an Upper High Angular Dark Field detector and data was processed on the OXFORD instruments software INCA. INCA was also used to process EDS data collected in tandem with STEM/HAADF images. EDS signals were detected using a thermoelectrically cooled OXFORD instruments 80 mm Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) shielded by an ultra-thin polymer window. EDS analyses consisted of three modes; (1) spatial EDS spectral analyses from a 0.5–1.0 nm probe; (2) EDS line mapping over individual nanoparticles; and (3) full-image EDS mapping. XRF data was taken on a Siemens SRS3000 spectrometer. Data reduction used Siemens SPECTRA 3000 software. Samples were analysed directly as powders supported on Mylar films. Powder XRD patterns were taken on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode X-ray tube and a curved graphite filter monochromator. XRD data was collected from 2θ = 10–90° (step 0.02°, scan rate 2° min−1) using Cu Kα X-rays (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 mA, 40 kV). Anatase crystallite sizes (L) were determined from the powder XRD data using the Scherrer equation and line-widths of the anatase (101) reflection at 2θ = 25.3°. The rutile:anatase ratio in P25 TiO2 was determined according to the method described by Ding et al. [40]. % R u t i l e = 1 1 + 0.8 I A / I R × 100 where IA is the peak intensity for the anatase (101) reflection, and IR is the peak intensity for the rutile (110) reflection. XPS data were collected on the soft X-ray Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, which was equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer and an analysis chamber pressure of ∼1 × 10−10 Torr. Spectra were excited using X-rays of energy 1486.7 eV (equivalent to an Al Kα source). Samples were sprinkled onto a carbon sticky dot for the analyses. A charge neutralisation system was used to alleviate sample charge build up during analysis. Survey scans were collected at a pass energy of 80 eV over the binding energy range 1200–0 eV, whilst core level scans were collected with a pass energy of 20 eV. The spectra were calibrated against the C 1s signal at 285.0 eV from adventitious hydrocarbons. N2 physisorption isotherms were determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) using a Micromeritics TriStar II PLUS instrument. Specific surfaces areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption data according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using P/Po values in the range 0.05–0.2 [22]. Cumulative pore volumes and pore diameters were calculated from the adsorption isotherms by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method [23]. Samples were degassed at 100 °C under vacuum for 1 h prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. Photoluminescence measurements of radiative electron-hole pair recombination in the TiO2-based photocatalysts were performed in air at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer. Spectra were excited at 310 nm and photoluminescence data recorded over a range of 330–600 nm using a standard photomultiplier."
7,Methylene blue photo-oxidation tests,"2.6 Methylene blue photo-oxidation tests Methylene blue photo-oxidation studies were performed at 20 °C in aqueous methylene blue solutions (4 × 10−5 mol L−1) buffered at pH = 6. A 1 L stock solution of methylene blue (3 mM) was first prepared by adding methylene blue monohydrate (0.9592 g) to Milli-Q water. The methylene blue stock solution (3 mM, 13.3 mL) was subsequently diluted with a phosphate buffer solution (986.7 mL) to give a 4 × 10−5 mol L−1 MB solution that was used for the photocatalytic tests. Experiments were performed in a doubled-jacketed borosilicate glass beaker (250 ml internal volume, internal diameter 7.0 cm, depth 6.5 cm) that was connected to a continuous cold water supply to maintain a constant temperature of 20 °C. For each test, P25 TiO2 or xTiO2(t) photocatalyst (0.030 g) was dispersed in 150 ml of the 4 × 10−5 mol L−1 MB solution. The beaker was then covered with a thin planar sheet of quartz glass, and the photocatalyst-containing dispersion stirred in the dark for 1 h to achieve equilibrium adsorption of methylene blue on the photocatalyst surface. After 1 h, a 3 ml aliquot was withdrawn from the solution and the dissolved oxygen concentration measured (HANNA instruments HI4421 dissolved oxygen meter, 7.5–9 ppm for all solutions), after which a UV lamp (Spectraline model SB-100 P/F lamp, 100 W, 365 nm) was switched on and the beaker irradiated directly from above. The photon flux at the top of the liquid level in the beaker was ∼6.5 mW cm−2, comparable to the UV flux in sunlight (approximately 5 mW cm−2). Every 10 min, a 3 ml aliquot was withdrawn from the MB solution by pipette, and the experiment continued over a one hour period (two hours for rutile-based photocatalysts due to their lower activity). The aliquots taken during the experiment were transferred to 3 ml Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged to remove any TiO2, and then UV–vis absorbance spectra collected over the range 400–850 nm on a Shimadzu UV-1700 PharmaSpec spectrophotometer. The difference between the absorbance at 664 nm (absorbance maximum for the methylene blue monomer) and 850 nm (baseline reading) was used to calculate the MB concentration. Photo-catalytic tests for each sample were carried out in triplicate."
8,Analysis of OH radical formation,"2.7 Analysis of OH radical formation The fluorescence of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) formed by the reaction of terephthalic acid (TA) with OH radicals was used probe the effectiveness of the xTiO2(t) and P25 TiO2 photocatalysts in generating aqueous hydroxyl radicals under UV excitation [41]. 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid fluoresces strongly at 426 nm under 310 nm excitation. A 3 mmol L−1 TA solution was prepared by dissolution of terephthalic acid in aqueous NaOH (4 mL, 0.5 mol L−1) solution. For the OH• radical generation experiments, xTiO2(t) or P25 TiO2 (0.030 g) was dispersed in 130 ml of pH 6 phosphate buffer, to which 20 ml of the prepared TA solution (3 mmol L−1) was added to give a total volume of 150 ml (TA concentration = 0.4 mmol L−1). The remaining experiment procedure was the same as that described for the MB photo-oxidation tests above (i.e. UV excitation at 365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2, with aliquots being withdrawn at 10 min intervals for analysis). Photoluminescence measurements were then performed at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer. The aliquots from UV irradiation of the photocatalysts were excited at 310 nm and photoluminescence spectra recorded over a range of 330–600 nm using a standard photomultiplier."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests,"2.8 Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests on the M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Au, Pd or Pd-Au) and the bare TiO2 supports were carried out in a tubular Pyrex reactor (100 ml volume). Photocatalyst (6.5 mg) was placed in the reactor and flushed under a N2 flow for 30 min to remove oxygen. Then, 20 ml of a 10 vol.% alcohol-90 vol.% water mixture (alcohols tested were ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol) was injected into the reactor through a rubber septum and the resulting photocatalyst dispersion stirred continuously for 1 h in the dark (no UV excitation). A 1 ml sample of the headspace gas was taken to confirm that no hydrogen formed by dark reactions, after which the reactor was exposed to UV light supplied from a Spectraline model SB-100 P/F lamp (100 W, 365 nm) at a distance of 10 cm from the reactor. The photon flux at the sample was approximately 6.5 mW cm−2. Hydrogen evolution was monitored by taking gas head space samples (1 mL) at 20 min intervals and injecting these into a Shimadzu GC 2014 equipped with a TCD detector and Carboxen-1010 plot capillary column (L × I.D. = 30 m × 0.53 mm, average thickness 30 μm). H2 evolved was quantified against an external calibration curve of peak area versus moles of H2. Photocatalytic tests for each sample were carried out in triplicate."
10,Results and discussion,
11,"Characterisation of xTiO2(t) (x = 500–700 °C, t = 10–240 min) formed by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes","3.1 Characterisation of xTiO2(t) (x = 500–700 °C, t = 10–240 min) formed by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes Fig. 1 shows SEM and TEM images for the bulk anatase powder, Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of the former in 10 M NaOH at 150 °C, and H2Ti3O7 nanotubes obtained by ion exchange from the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes. The SEM and TEM data confirmed the successful synthesis of Na2Ti3O7 and H2Ti3O7 nanotubes of length 200–600 nm and outer diameter ∼10 nm) (Fig. 1(c)–(f)). Detailed information about the mechanism of Na2Ti3O7 nanotube formation by layer exfoliation from TiO2 powders and can be found elsewhere [42–46]. Powder XRD data for the Na2Ti3O7 and H2Ti3O7 nanotubes (Fig. S1) were in excellent accord with previous literature for the same titanate materials [42–46]. Electronic band gaps (Eg) of 3.52 and 3.40 eV were determined for Na2Ti3O7 and H2Ti3O7 nanotubes, respectively, using the Tauc plots shown in Fig. S2(b). BET specific surface areas determined by N2 physisorption at 77 K were 185 and 216 m2 g−1 for Na2Ti3O7 and H2Ti3O7 nanotubes, respectively. The 16–17% increase in BET surface on transforming Na2Ti3O7 to H2Ti3O7 by ion exchange is in excellent agreement with theory. The molar mass of H2Ti3O7 (257.61 g mol−1) is ∼15% smaller than that of Na2Ti3O7 (301.58 g mol−1). Thus, for same geometric area of exposed surface (reasonable here since the morphologies of the sodium and hydrogen titanate nanotubes were near identical by SEM and TEM), the specific surface area of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes should be ∼15% larger than that of Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes. Calcination of the H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at 500–700 °C for 10–240 min afforded pure anatase nanorods, with the size and aspect ratio of the nanorods being strongly dependent on the calcination conditions. Figs. 2 and S3 show SEM images of nanorods obtained by H2Ti3O7 nanotube calcination at 500, 600 and 700 °C for different lengths of time. After calcination at 500 °C for 10 min, the nanorods obtained were 50–300 nm in length with a mean width of 10–15 nm (Fig. 2(a)). Nanorods obtained after calcination at 600 °C for 20 min were of similar length, but had widths in the range 15–20 nm (Fig. 2(c)). Nanorods obtained by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at 700 °C for 10 min were shorter (<200 nm) and had a significantly increased width (15–40 nm) (Fig. 2(e)). Increasing the calcination time at each temperature decreased the length and increased the width of the nanorods (Fig. 2(b), (d) and (f), respectively). The exact mechanism by which H2Ti3O7 nanotubes transform into rectangular anatase nanorods during calcination at 500–700 °C is unclear, though the data in Fig. 2 suggests that the transformation takes place over very short time scales (10–20 min). Corresponding TEM images are shown in Fig. 3 , and confirmed that all the nanorods were solid and crystalline, rather than tubular like the H2Ti3O7 nanotube precursor (Fig. 1(f)). For many of the nanorods in the TEM images, lattice fringes with a spacing d ∼0.352 nm could be discerned (Fig. S3 shows an expanded view of a several nanorods revealing the lattice fringes), corresponding to anatase (101) planes. Powder XRD patterns for the nanorods obtained by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at 500, 600 and 700 °C for different lengths of time are shown in Figs. 4 , S4 and S5, respectively. Anatase was the only phase identified by XRD at each calcination temperature and calcination time. No preferential orientation was seen in the XRD patterns, since the relative intensities of all peaks matched data given in Fig. S1(a) for the bulk anatase powder used in the synthesis of the H2Ti3O7 nanotubes. The XRD peaks for the nanorods sharpened on increasing the calcination time at each temperature, and also with increasing temperature for a fixed calcination time, consistent with an increase in the crystallinity in the nanorods. A direct comparison of powder XRD data collected at the three calcination temperatures and specific calcination times (10 min and 180 min) is provided in Fig. S6. The absence of any diffraction peaks characteristic for rutile in the XRD patterns of Figs. 4, S4 and S5 suggests that anatase nanorods synthesized by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes possessed high thermal stability. The onset of the anatase-to-rutile phase transition can be as low as 500 °C depending on the method by which the anatase was synthesized. Anatase crystallite sizes, calculated from the FWHM of the anatase (101) reflection at 2θ = 25.3° using the Scherrer equation, are listed in Table 1 . Anatase crystallite sizes increased with both calcination temperature and calcination time (10 to 240 min), from 20 to 32 nm at 500 °C, from 27 to 54 nm at 600 °C and from 46 to 80 nm at 700 °C. The BET specific surface area and BJH cumulative pore volume of the nanorods decreased with increasing calcination time and calcination temperature (Table 1). This result is consistent with SEM and TEM findings in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, which revealed that the anatase nanorods became thicker and shorter (i.e. larger and more granular) as both calcination time and temperature increased. The BJH average pore diameter was similar for most nanorod samples (28–33 nm), not surprising as this measurement is determining the mean size of voids between nanorods packed in the sample tube of the N2 physisorption analyser. Fig. S7 shows the UV–vis absorbance spectra for a selection of xTiO(t) nanorods, all of which displayed intense absorption below 400 nm. Tauc plots yielded Eg = 3.18–3.21 eV for all the xTiO(t) nanorods, in agreement with expectations for anatase (Eg = 3.2 eV, λ < 388 nm, Fig. S2(b))."
12,Comparative performance evaluation of xTiO2(t) photocatalysts and P25 TiO2 for methylene blue photo-oxidation in aqueous solution,"3.2 Comparative performance evaluation of xTiO2(t) photocatalysts and P25 TiO2 for methylene blue photo-oxidation in aqueous solution The photo-oxidation of methylene blue in aqueous solution is widely used to gauge and compare the activity of TiO2 photocatalysts. Whilst the exact mechanism for methylene blue photo-oxidation has yet to be established, the process is known to be driven by hydroxyl radicals (OH) generated at the surface of TiO2 during UV irradiation. The key processes leading to hydroxyl radical formation in aqueous suspensions of TiO2 photocatalysts are summarised in Eqs. (1)–(4). (1) Ti O 2 + hν → e CB − + h VB + photoexcitation, t ∼ 1 0 − 15 S (2) H 2 O ads + h VB + → H + + O H • hydroxyl radical, t 1/2 ∼ 10 − 9 S (3) e CB − + O 2 → O 2 − • superoxide radical, t 1/2 ∼ 1 0 − 5 S (4) 2 O 2 − • + 2 H 2 O → 2 O H • + 2 O H − + O 2 hydroxyl radical, t 1/2 ∼ 1 0 − 9 S Hydroxyl radicals generated in Eqs. (2) and (4) then drive the mineralisation of aqueous methylene blue, as described by the overall reaction below. (5) C16H18N3S+ + 102 OH → 16 CO2 + 3 NO3 − + SO4 2− + 6 H+ + 57 H2O The initial step in the process is thought to be OH radical attack at the MB ring sulphur atom, which initiates a series of reactions that lead to ring opening and the loss of extended conjugation in the MB structure [47–56]. The methylene blue monomer in aqueous has an absorption maximum at 664 nm, which enables the photo-oxidation of the monomer by OH• radicals generated by TiO2 under UV irradiation to be followed spectrophotometrically. The photo-oxidation of MB in aqueous solution is widely assumed to follow pseudo first order reaction kinetics, as described by the integrated rate law expression below: (6) ln [ MB ] t [ MB ] 0 = ln Ab s t Ab s 0 = − k ' t where [MB]t and [MB]0 are the molar concentrations of methylene blue at time = t and time = 0, respectively; At and A0 are the absorbances of the MB solution (i.e. A664 nm – A850 nm) at time = t and time = 0, respectively, and k′ is the pseudo first order rate constant (typically expressed as min−1). Recently, Chen et al. reported results of a detailed study of methylene blue photo-oxidation over different TiO2 photocatalysts, placing emphasis on the effect of TiO2 polymorph and solution pH [11]. The optimum pH for MB photo-oxidation was found to be ∼6, just above the isoelectric point of TiO2 (5.8), with rate constants (k′) dropping sharply below pH 6 (methylene blue is cationic, and thus a positively charged TiO2 surface at lower pH will repel MB). Further, linear plots of ln(At/A0) versus time and reliable pseudo first order rate constants were only observed in buffered MB solutions (e.g. phosphate buffer at pH 6) [11]. The mineralisation of MB yields protons, and thus unless MB solutions are buffered the results obtained from MB photo-oxidation tests are not very meaningful on account of the dependence of k′ on pH. A further point that should be noted is that TiO2 polymorphs differ in their rates of hydroxyl radical generation and also in the fate of the hydroxyl radicals once they are generated (we explore this in detail below). In the case of anatase and brookite, hydroxyl radicals generated at the surface of these polymorphs migrate into solution, whereas for rutile the hydroxyl radicals remain adsorbed on the rutile surface. Accordingly dye photo-oxidation rates for anatase and brookite photocatalysts tend to be higher than that of rutile, since the latter necessitates dye adsorption on the photocatalyst surface. Such differences in the MB photo-oxidation mechanism are generally neglected and only the overall global rate reported in most literature reports. In general, even though the photo-oxidation of aqueous MB is widely used to evaluate and compare the performance of different TiO2 photocatalysts, care needs to be taken to ensure that the MB photo-oxidation tests are conducted under appropriate conditions (e.g. buffered solutions, constant temperature) and with the manner in which hydroxyl radicals are formed and released from the TiO2 photocatalysts given due consideration in the discussion of the results. Fig. 5 (a) shows representative UV–vis absorption spectra for aliquots taken at successive 10 min intervals during MB photo-oxidation tests on a 600TiO2(120) photocatalyst. The experiment was conducted at 20 °C in a pH 6 phosphate buffer. At time = 0 min (i.e. before the MB solution containing the photocatalyst was exposed to UV), two intense absorption peaks at 610 and 664 nm were observed and readily assigned to dimeric and monomeric methylene blue species, respectively [11]. After UV exposure in the presence of a photocatalyst, the concentration of both MB species decreased. Plots of ln(At/A0) versus time derived from similar absorbance spectra for xTiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts obtained at calcination temperatures of 500, 600 and 700 °C are shown in Fig. 5(b)–(d), respectively. Data for H2Ti3O7 nanotubes and P25 TiO2 is also included for comparison. All plots show excellent linearity confirming pseudo first order kinetics were obeyed. Rate constants (k′) for each photocatalyst determined from the slopes of the plots in Fig. 5(b)–(d) are summarised in Fig. 6 and Table 1. The effect of calcination time on the photocatalytic activity of the xTiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts will first be discussed. Firstly, the H2Ti3O7 nanotubes used to synthesize the xTiO2(t) nanorods demonstrated low activity for MB photo-oxidation at pH 6 (k′ = 0.0016 min−1), which was not surprising as the band gap of the nanorods was 3.52 eV (i.e. λ < 352 nm) which would have resulted in the generation of few charge carriers under 365 nm UV irradiation. However, many of the xTiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts demonstrated outstanding performance for MB photo-oxidation at pH 6, superior to commercial P25 TiO2 (k′ = 0.0221 min−1) under the same testing conditions. The data in Fig. 6(a) shows that the activity of 500TiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts increased with calcination time up to 120 min (k′ = 0.0223 min−1), whereas for the 600TiO2(t) and 700TiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts rate constants >0.0230 min−1 were achieved after only 10–20 min calcination. Results confirm that flash calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at 700 °C for 10 min, as opposed to prolonged calcinations at 500 °C, can yield anatase nanorods with very good performance for MB photo-oxidation. The highest rate constants achieved at each calcination temperature were 0.0233 min−1 for 500TiO2(120), 0.0258 min−1 for 600TiO2(180) and 0.0248 min−1 for 700TiO2(180), though for the latter a comparable rate constant was also achieved after only 10 min calcination at 700 °C (k′ = 0.0239 min−1). For calcination times greater than 20 min, the activity of the xTiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts followed the order 600TiO2(t) > 700TiO2(t) > 500TiO2(t). Table 1 shows that the BET specific surface area of the xTiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts decreased with calcination time at each of the 3 calcination temperatures used in this study. Accordingly, we normalized the pseudo first order rate constant determined for each xTiO2(t) photocatalyst (min−1 g−1) against its BET specific surface area (in m2 g−1). The obtained area normalized rate constants (in min−1 m−2) are shown in the right hand column in Table 1 and Fig. 6(b). Following normalization, the rate constants clearly followed the order 700TiO2(t) > 600TiO2(t) > 500TiO2(t) at all calcination times. The activity of anatase photocatalysts depend on a variety of factors, especially surface area (a high surface area gives more sites for OH radical generation and short diffusion paths for electrons and holes to diffuse to reach the surface) and also the crystallinity of the support (larger crystals have less bulk defects that can act as electron-hole recombination sites). The data in Table 1 and Fig. 6(b) can easily be rationalised on this basis, with the xTiO2(t) photocatalysts that afforded the highest k′ (min−1) representing the best compromise between anatase particle/crystallite size and surface area. Note that the 600TiO2(180) and 700TiO2(10) nanorod photocatalysts, two best performing xTiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts identified in this study for MB photo-oxidation at pH 6, had remarkably similar anatase crystallite sizes (48 and 46 nm, respectively) and BET specific areas (40.5 and 41.2 m2 g−1, respectively). In order to understand the origin of the excellent MB photo-oxidation activity demonstrated by the xTiO2(t) nanorod photocatalysts, we conducted experiments to monitor hydroxyl generation from the photocatalysts under UV irradiation in pH 6 phosphate buffer. Hydroxyl radicals (OH•) react with terephthalic acid (TA) to form 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) according to the equation below [57]. (7) C 6 H 4 ( COOH ) 2 + O H • + h + ( VB ) → C 6 H 3 ( COOH ) 2 OH + H + (8) C 6 H 4 ( COOH ) 2 + 2 O H • → C 6 H 3 ( COOH ) 2 OH + H 2 O HTA fluoresces strongly at 426 nm under 310 nm excitation, thus allowing OH• formation during UV irradiation of aqueous suspensions of xTiO2(t) to be quantified. Preliminary experiments using P25 TiO2 were first conducted in order to examine the effect of the dispersion medium on the rate of OH. Fig. S8 revealed increased OH• radical formation from UV irradiation of P25 TiO2 in pH 6 buffer (Fig. S8(a) and (b)) compared to UV irradiation of P25 TiO2 in pure water. The generation of protons will make the surface of TiO2 positively charged, which appears detrimental to OH• radical generation. Using a pH 6 phosphate buffer will keep the TiO2 surface neutral or slightly negatively charged (TiO2 I.E.P. = 5.8), which is clearly advantageous for both OH• radical generation and the photo-oxidation of MB. Accordingly, for the OH• radical generation studies using xTiO2(t) nanorods, 20 ml of TA and 130 ml of pH 6 phosphate buffer were used as the reaction medium. Fig. 7 shows photoluminescence data for 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) formed during UV irradiation of pH 6 suspensions of 600TiO2(180), P25 TiO2, anatase (size ∼25 nm, BET area ∼51 m2 g−1) and rutile nanoparticles (size ∼50 nm, BET area ∼26 m2 g−1) isolated from P25 TiO2 by selective chemical dissolution. Data for 700TiO2(10) (not shown) was almost identical to that presented for 600TiO2(180). HTA production followed the order P25 TiO2 > 600TiO2(180) ∼ 700TiO2(10) ∼ anatase from P25 TiO2 >> rutile from P25 TiO2, indicating P25 TiO2 was the most effective photocatalyst in generating OH• radicals under the conditions of the tests (∼25–30% higher than the 600TiO2(180) and 700TiO2(10) photocatalysts). This can be explained by the presence of anatase-rutile heterojunctions in P25 TiO2, which as outlined above facilitate charge separation and increase the concentration of holes (accumulating in the VB of rutile) and electrons (accumulating in the CB of anatase) available during photoreactions. The much lower activity of the pure rutile sample for generating OH radicals is explained by radicals being strongly adsorbed on the rutile surface, thus requiring adsorption of TA before HTA production can occur [58]. Results of Table 1 and Fig. 7 are interesting, in that the 600TiO2(180) and 700TiO2(10) photocatalysts demonstrated superior performance to P25 TiO2 for MB photo-oxidation at pH 6 (8 and 13% higher rate constants, respectively), yet P25 TiO2 was 25–30% more efficient in generating OH• radicals at pH 6 under UV excitation. Irrespective of the underlying reason, results here clearly demonstrate that pure anatase nanorod photocatalysts derived by calcination from H2Ti3O7 nanotubes can outperform P25 TiO2 for aqueous dye degradation by some margin."
13,"Characterisation of M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au, Pd-Au)","3.3 Characterisation of M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au, Pd-Au) Noble metal modified titania photocatalysts demonstrate excellent activity for H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures under UV excitation. Accordingly, we prepared a series of M/xTiO2(t) photocatalysts using the xTiO2(t) supports described in Section 3.1. Corresponding M/P25 TiO2 (M = Au, Pd, Pd-Au) photocatalysts were prepared using commercially available Degussa P25 TiO2. Pd, Au and Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles were deposited on the TiO2 supports by the deposition-precipitation with urea method [39]. Previous studies of the Pd/TiO2 system established that the optimal Pd loading for promoting H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures is ∼0.5 wt.% [25]. Dosado et al. found that the optimum Au loading depended on the TiO2 support, with loadings ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 wt.% being reported as optimal by various groups. In this work, we used a fixed metal co-catalyst loading of 0.5 wt.% for the synthesis of all photocatalysts. For the Pd-Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, the loadings of Pd and Au were both 0.25 wt.%, thus giving the desired total metal co-catalyst loading. Powder XRD data (not shown) confirmed that the phase composition of the xTiO2(t) support was unaffected by co-catalyst deposition (anatase was the only TiO2 polymorph detected). BET surface areas for the 600TiO2(120), Pd/600TiO2(120), Au/600TiO2(120) and Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) were similar (43.9, 41.5, 42.1 and 41.7 m2 g−1, respectively). TEM images for different M/600TiO2(120) nanorod photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . The M/600TiO2(120) photocatalysts all possessed that same nanorod structure typical for the 600TiO2(120) support (c.f. Fig. 8(a), (c) and (e) with Fig. 3(d)), further evidence that functionalisation of the nanorods with the metal co-catalyst nanoparticles did not alter the structure of the support. Average Pd, Au and Pd-Au nanoparticles determined from the TEM images for Au/600TiO2(120), Pd/600TiO2(120) and Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) were 2.2, 5.8 and 3.5 nm, respectively (Fig. 8(d), (b) and (f), respectively). The larger size of Au nanoparticles can be attributed to a weaker metal-support interaction compared to Pd and Pd-Au with the anatase support. The average size of the Pd, Au and Pd-Au nanoparticles determined by TEM for the M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts were similar to those of M/600TiO2(120) photocatalysts (Fig. S9). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy with high-angle annular dark-field imaging (STEM-HAADF) and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) were applied to probe the chemical composition of the nanoparticles on the Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) and Pd-Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts. Data for the Pd-Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 9 . HRTEM analyses on the supported metal nanoparticles revealed lattice fringes with a spacing of ∼0.24 nm (Fig. 9(a) and (b)), intermediate between values ∼0.20 nm seen for Pd/TiO2 and values of ∼0.28 nm determined for Au/TiO2. The intermediacy in the fringe spacing provides good evidence for Pd-Au alloy formation. The STEM image (Fig. 9(c)), the EDAX line scan (Fig. 9(d) and the Pd and Au element maps (Fig. 9(e) and (f), respectively) provide further compelling evidence for Pd-Au alloy nanoparticle formation. Similar Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles were found on the Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) support (data not shown). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to confirm the valence state of the supported Pd, Au and Pd-Au nanoparticles. Photocatalysts with a total co-catalyst loading of 1 wt.% were used for the XPS study to achieve an improved signal to noise ratio. Fig. 10 (a) and (b) show Pd 3d and Au 4f XPS spectra, respectively, for the Pd/600TiO2(120), Au/600TiO2(120) and Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) photocatalysts. The Pd 3d XPS spectrum for the Pd/600TiO2(120) photocatalyst contained peaks at 335.2 and 340.5 eV in a 3:2 area ratio, readily assigned to the Pd5/2 and Pd3/2 peaks, respectively, of Pd metal (reported Pd5/2 binding energies for Pd°, PdO, PdCl2, PdO2 and K2PdCl6 are 335.2, 336.3, 337.8, 337.9 and 340.2 eV, respectively). The Au/600TiO2(120) photocatalyst similarly contained only metallic Au, evidenced by Au 4f peaks at 83.7 and 87.4 eV (4:3 area ratio, Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively) and Au 4d peaks at 334.9 and 352.9 eV (3:2 area ratio, Au 4d5/2 ad 4d3/2, respectively). The binding energy of the Au 4f peaks were -0.3 eV lower than values typically observed for bulk Au (Au 4f7/2 = 84.0 eV), which is likely due to electron density transfer from the TiO2 support, as has also been reported by other groups. XPS analysis of the Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) photocatalyst revealed the presence of Pd° and Au°, as expected for the Pd-Au nanoparticles seen by STEM and EDX in Fig. 9. Alloying did not alter the Pd 3d and Au 4f/Au 4d binding energies. Quantitative XPS analysis performed for Pd and Au in the Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) photocatalyst, using Pd 3d and Au 4d peak areas and appropriate sensitivity factors of 16.04 and 19.8 based on instrument-modified Schofield cross sections, afforded a Pd:Au weight ratio of ∼1:1, consistent with the nominal Pd and Au loadings. Some authors have reported positive shifts in Pd and Au binding energies with Pd-Au alloy formation [59,60]. These studies typically involve unsupported Pd-Au nanoparticles, or deposition of one metal as a thin film on another (e.g. Au deposition on Pd(111) surface). In the current study, the binding energies of the Pd 3d and Au 4f peaks for the Pd-Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were almost identical for those determined for the monometallic Pd/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, respectively. The absence of any discernible XPS peak shifts in the Pd-Au/TiO2 system is likely due to the strong influence of the metal support interaction with TiO2. The MSI of Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles with TiO2 is expected to be reasonably strong, intermediate between that of Pd with TiO2 (a very strong MSI resulting in well-dispersed and small Pd NPs) and Au with TiO2 (a weaker MSI, resulting in larger Au NPs located on TiO2 crystallite boundaries). Here it seems that the MSI suppresses any core level Pd and Au chemical shifts with Pd-Au alloy nanoparticle formation. Indeed, our findings are comparable to those reported by Bukhtiyarov et al. for Pd-Au nanoparticles on HOPG, where the Pd 3d and Au 4f binding energies for supported Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles were near identical to those determined for Pd/HOPG and Au/HOPG [61]. Fig. 11 (a) and (b) shows UV–vis absorbance spectra and corresponding Tauc plots for various M/xTiO2(t) photocatalysts. All photocatalysts showed an intense absorption below 400 nm due to band gap excitation in the anatase TiO2 support (Eg ∼3.2 eV from the Tauc plots). Pd/ xTiO2(t) photocatalysts were grey in colour and showed strong absorption across the entire visible spectrum, due to d-d interband transitions of supported metallic Pd nanoparticles. The Au/xTiO2(t) photocatalysts were purple and displayed a broad absorption feature centred around 570 nm, which can readily be assigned to the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of supported Au nanoparticles. The UV–vis absorbance spectra for the Pd-Au/xTiO2(t) photocatalysts were similar to those collected for Pd/xTiO2(t), though did also show a very weak absorption feature at ∼570 nm, the wavelength expected for the LSPR of supported Au nanoparticles. Pd-Au/TiO2 photocatalysts containing discrete Pd and Au nanoparticles would be expected to show an intense Au LSPR feature, thus the UV–vis data reported in Fig. 11(a) adds further evidence to support the existence of Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles on the surface Pd-Au/xTiO2(t) photocatalyst. Corresponding UV–vis and Tauc plots for the M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 11(c) and (d), and were near identical to those reported in Fig. 11(a) and (b) for the M/xTiO2(t) photocatalysts. High work function metal co-catalysts such as Pd (Φ = 5.6 eV) and Au (Φ = 5.3–5.6 eV) enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 (Φ = 4.1–4.5 eV depending on the polymorph) for H2 production by accepting electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 and acting as cathodic sites for H2 evolution [10,62–69]. By accepting electrons excited into the conduction band of TiO2, the metal co-catalysts suppress electron-hole pair recombination and increase the concentration of charge carriers available for photoreactions. Fig. 12 (a) and (b) show photoluminescence spectra collected in air for 600TiO2(120) and P25 TiO2 under UV excitation. Both of the bare supports gave very intense and broad photoluminescence signals due to high rates of electron-hole pair recombination. Following metal co-catalyst deposition on the supports, the photoluminescence signals were attenuated, confirming that metal co-catalysts were effective in suppressing electron-hole pair recombination in TiO2, even at low metal loadings (0.5 wt.%). Pd was the most effective co-catalyst in suppressing electron-hole pair recombination (by weight), though if the co-catalysts were compared in terms of metal atoms present (ratio Pd:Au:Pd-Au = 1.85:1:1.43), then the suppression ability was probably quite similar for all co-catalysts."
14,"Comparative performance evaluation of M/xTiO2(t) photocatalysts and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au, Pd-Au) for H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures","3.4 Comparative performance evaluation of M/xTiO2(t) photocatalysts and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au, Pd-Au) for H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures The performance of the M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in ethanol-water, ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water mixtures (10 vol.% alcohol) were evaluated under UV irradiation (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2). The experiments were designed to examine the effect of the TiO2 support (xTiO2(t) versus P25 TiO2), metal co-catalyst (Pd, Au or Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles) and alcohol sacrificial reagent (1° alcohol, diol and triol) on photocatalytic H2 production rates. Fig. 13 (a)–(f) shows plots of H2 production versus time for M/xTiO2(t) and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts in the three alcohol-water systems. All photocatalysts displayed stable performance during the photocatalytic tests, as evidence by the excellent linearity of the plots. H2 production rates determined from the slopes of the plots in Fig. 13(a)–(f) are summarised in Table 2 and Fig. 14 (a)–(c), where H2 production rates are expressed in mmol g−1 h−1 (catalyst mass normalized rate), mmol m−2 h−1 (surface area normalized rate) and mol molmetal −1 h−1 (metal co-catalyst normalized rate). The xTiO2(t) and P25 TiO2 supports demonstrated very low activities for H2 production in all the alcohol-water systems (<1.2 mmol g−1 h−1) due to the high overpotentials for H2 evolution in the absence of a metal co-catalyst [25]. Table 1 shows that the addition of Pd, Au, Pd-Au co-catalysts dramatically improved the H2 production performance of xTiO2(t) and P25 TiO2, with H2 production rates (in mol g−1 h−1) depending on the co-catalyst and decreasing in the order Pd-Au > Pd > Au. After normalisation against the molar amount of metal co-catalyst, rates (in mol molM −1 h−1) followed the order Pd-Au ∼ Au > Pd. Amongst all the photocatalysts, the Pd-Au/600TiO2(20) and Pd-Au/600TiO2(120) photocatalysts exhibited the highest activities (H2 production rates = 37.2–39.0 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% ethanol, 43.1–44.0 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% ethylene glycol and 45.0–45.6 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% glycerol). The performance of M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts were general inferior to the M/600TiO2(20) and M/600TiO2(120) photocatalysts under the same testing conditions, except in 10 vol.% glycerol where the Pd-Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst demonstrated superior activity (49.6 mmol g−1 h−1). M/700TiO2(10) photocatalysts also displayed very good performance for H2 production, suggesting flash calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at 700 °C is also effective in producing anatase supports for H2 production photocatalyst development. Cargnello et al. fabricated brookite nanowires with diameters 4–6 nm and lengths between 20–50 nm via a high temperature hydrothermal route in the presence of fluoride as a shape direction agent [70]. As the length of the nanowires increased, electron and hole separation improved, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 production in aqueous solutions of ethanol, glycerol and glucose under UV. Photoexcited holes were effectively confined to width of the nanorods due to their short diffusion lengths (∼10 nm), whereas electrons could migrate over the whole length (due to their much longer diffusion lengths up to several microns). In our work, conducted in the absence of F− as a shape direction agent, anatase nanorods with aspect ratios ranging from 2 to 8 were successfully fabricated by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at different temperatures (500–700 °C) and times (10–240 min). At each temperature, nanorods with a high aspect ratio were initially formed, which subsequently sintered to give thicker rods with lower aspect ratios at the longer calcination times. The rates for both aqueous methylene blue photo-oxidation (Table 1) and alcohol photoreforming (Table 2) actually improved as the aspect ratio in the nanorods decreased (i.e. with increasing calcination time at each temperature), which was especially evident when rates were normalized against catalyst surface area. We thus conclude that the enhanced charge separation seen by Cargnello et al. in brookite nanowires was not apparent in the anatase nanorods synthesized here by calcination of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes. It is possible that adsorbed fluorine may have enhanced the anisotropy of electron and hole migration in the brookite nanowire study. Considering the relative work functions of bulk Pd, Au, Pd-Au and TiO2 (5.6, 5.31, 5.46, and 4.2–4.4 eV, respectively) [66–69], it was expected that Pd should have acted as the best co-catalyst for promoting H2 production. Theoretically, the larger the work function difference between metal co-catalyst and the TiO2 support, the more effective the co-catalyst in accepting electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 and promoting H2 production [71]. Accordingly, the Pd/TiO2 photocatalysts show superior photocatalytic H2 production activity to Au/TiO2 photocatalysts in all the alcohol-water systems tested [72]. The low electron affinity and high density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level allows Pd (4d8) to effectively trap electrons from TiO2 and transfer the electrons to electron accepting species [68]. Contrary to expectation, we found that Pd-Au co-catalysts were actually superior to Pd co-catalysts in promoting H2 production. To explain this result, further investigation is needed. However, a plausible explanation is that Pd-Au alloying gives a d-band center intermediate value between that of Pd (1.8 eV) and Au (3.6 eV), resulting in a MH bond strength that is ideal for H2 evolution (c.f. Pt which is widely considered the best co-catalyst for H2 production, and which has a d-band center of 2.3 eV). An XPS valence band study on Pd-Au alloys would be useful for determining how the d-band center shifts with alloy composition. For both the M/xTiO2 and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts, H2 production rates followed the order 10 vol.% glycerol >10 vol.% ethylene glycol >10 vol.% ethanol (Table 2). To explain this trend, the structure and physical properties of the three alcohols need to be considered (Table 3 ). Figs. 15 and S10 showed plots of H2 production versus selected physical properties of the alcohols for various M/xTiO2 and M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts. Alcohol properties considered were the number of alpha hydrogens on the alcohol, the number of OH groups on the alcohol, alcohol polarity and exp − ( E V B ( T i O 2 ) o − E o x o ) , following the recent work of Al-Azri et al. and Chen et al. [10,73]. In all cases, reasonable linear correlations could be established between H2 production rates the specific properties of the alcohols. The basis for these correlations can be easily understood. Alcohol oxidation on TiO2 surfaces proceeds via the formation of alpha hydroxyl radicals, which are subsequently oxidised to the corresponding aldehyde. The formation of alpha hydroxyl radicals necessitates the presence of α-H atoms on the alcohol, explaining the linear relationship established in Fig. 15(a) (c.f. rates of photocatalytic H2 production in 10 vol.% tertiary butanol are very low [74,75]). Hydroxyl groups on the alcohol are important for adsorption on TiO2 surfaces (lone pairs on the OH groups interact with unoccupied Ti 3d orbitals), with adsorption strengths predicted to increase on going from primary alcohols to diols to triols. Stronger adsorption facilitates electron donation from the alcohol donor to the acceptor (h+ in the semiconductor VB). Further, alcohol polarity increases with the number of hydroxyl groups, explaining the linear relationships seen in Fig. 15(b) and (c), respectively. Using standard Gibbs free energies of formation ((ΔfGo), we calculated the standard oxidation potentials (Eox o) of ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol (Table S1). The calculations gave values of 0.084, 0.009 and 0.004 V versus NHE, respectively, all significantly lower than the oxidation potential of water (1.23 V versus NHE). Thus, under the conditions of our photocatalytic H2 production tests, the alcohols will be preferentially oxidised (preliminary photocatalytic H2 production tests conducted in pure water showed the M/TiO2 photocatalysts possessed some activity for pure water splitting under UV excitation, though rates were low <1.5 mmol g−1 h−1). Glycerol and ethylene glycol afforded the highest H2 production rates for all M/TiO2 photocatalysts (Table 2), in agreement with expectations since they had the lowest standard oxidation potentials (0.004 and 0.009 V versus NHE, respectively). The lower the oxidation potential, the better the hole scavenging properties of the alcohol. We calculated the potential difference between the anatase valence band (+2.7 V versus NHE) and the standard oxidation potential ( E o x o ) of each alcohol, then plotted H2 production rates versus exp − ( E V B ( T i O 2 ) o − E o x o ) , with the analysis revealing a strong linear relationship for all M/TiO2 photocatalysts. Further improvements in the H2 production yields reported here could be achieved by optimising the alcohol concentrations used in the H2 production tests. All H2 production experiments reported here were conducted at a fixed alcohol concentration of 10 vol.%. Recently, Wang et al. examined the mechanism of methanol photoreforming over gold-embedded boron-doped TiO2 photocatalysts [76]. Using isotope tracer experiments, it was revealed that most of the hydrogen evolved from water, with the methanol sacrificial agent reacting with hydroxyl radicals formed by water oxidation on valence band holes (thereby facilitating charge separation). Results here add weight to such a mechanism, since the 600TiO2(t), 700TiO2(t) and P25 TiO2 supports were all effective in generating hydroxyl radicals in aqueous media under UV excitation. Further, Majeed et al. recently reported exceptional rates of hydrogen production in alcohol-water mixtures over Cu(OH)2-Ni(OH)2/TiO2 nanorod photocatalysts based on a H2Ti3O7 precursor [77]. Cu° and Ni° formed during alcohol photoreforming were identified as the active co-catalysts in the photocatalyst system. Whilst the H2 production rates reported in that particular study were not as high as those reported here (as expected since they used a non-precious metal co-catalyst system), the work adds evidence to the story developed herein that H2Ti3O7-derived photocatalysts show very high activities in a range of different photoreactions."
15,Conclusion,"Calcination of hydrothermally synthesized H2Ti3O7 nanotubes at 500–700 °C for selected time periods produces anatase nanorods with outstanding photocatalytic properties. Optimal calcination conditions were 600 °C for 20–180 min or 700 °C for 10 min, which yielded anatase nanorods with reasonably high specific surface areas (>40 m2 g−1) and excellent crystallinity. Anatase nanorods synthesized under these optimal calcination conditions demonstrated excellent performance for aqueous methylene blue photo-oxidation at pH 6 under UV excitation, superior to Degussa P25 TiO2 under the same testing conditions. M/600TiO2(20), M/600TiO2(120) and M/700TiO2(10) photocatalysts (M = Pd, Au or Pd-Au, total metal loading = 0.5 wt.%) similarly outperformed corresponding M/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in 10 vol.% alcohol-water mixtures under UV irradiation. The Pd-Au/600TiO2(20) photocatalyst afforded H2 production rates of 45.6, 44.0 and 37.2 mmol g−1 h−1 in glycerol-water, ethylene-glycol-water and ethanol-water mixtures, respectively, at realistic solar UV fluxes (6.5 mW cm−2). Co-catalyst activity followed the order Pd-Au > Pd > Au for both M/xTiO2(t) and P25 TiO2 supported photocatalysts. Results guide the development of improved TiO2-based photocatalysts for dye degradation and renewable energy applications."
