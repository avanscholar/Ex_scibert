0,Introduction,"An increase in energy products and depleting fossil fuel reserves have necessitated great efforts in searching for renewable resources such as biomass [1–3]. Abundant and carbon-neutral biomass is known as the only renewable carbon resource that could replace fossil resources for the production of chemicals and fuels [4]. Levulinic acid (LA) is listed as one of the top 12 building block chemicals derived from biomass as identified by the United States Department of Energy in 2004 and is also in the revised list of top 10 platform chemicals in the year 2010 [5]. Herein, many researchers pay attention to the conversion of LA to γ-valerolactone (GVL), as GVL can be used as sustainable solvent and the precursor for the production of traffic fuel [6,7]. Ethyl levulinate (EL) has similar chemical property to LA and is also used for the synthesis of GVL by hydrogenation [8–12]. EL is primarily synthesized from the alcoholysis of carbohydrates (such as cellulose, glucose and sucrose) [13–17], and via the transformation of LA [18–20], furfuryl alcohol (FAL) [21,22] or chloromethyl furfural (CMF) [23] in the minority. Comparatively, LA is mainly from the hydrolysis of carbohydrates [24]. Compared to hydrolysis method, alcoholysis process can greatly decrease the formation of humins and increase the yield of EL. [25,26]. Moreover, EL possesses relatively lower boiling point and is acid-free in comparison with LA, which is benefit for improving catalyst stability and reactor anticorrosion. Thus, EL is a better alternative for the synthesis of GVL. Up to now, a variety of catalysts, including Ru, Pd, Cu, Ni, Co and zirconium phosphate have received considerable attention for efficient GVL production by alkyl levulinate hydrogenation, including EL [27–41]. Liu et al. [35] reported that Cu-Zn/ZrO2 with 20 wt% alumina gave 96.4% conversion of EL and 94.0% selectivity of GVL at 240 °C and atmospheric pressure. Zhang et al. [36] achieved 99.3% conversion of EL and 99.0% yield of GVL over activated carbon supported NiFe bimetallic catalyst at 100 °C and 4 MPa H2 for 6 h. A recent study by Guan et al. showed the synergistic effect of Nb2O5 with Pd/C by stabilizing Pd nanoparticles, leading to superior performance with 87% conversion of EL and 97% selectivity of GVL at 100 °C. Of all the investigated catalysts, Ru was found to be one of the most active catalyst under mild condition in aqueous phase [29,33]. Regardless of the great advances, most of previous studies mainly focus on catalytic performance (activity, selectivity and stability) or structure-performance correlation in EL hydrogenation, while the complex reaction mechanism has been less deeply investigated on Ru/support interface owing to the limitation of experimental techniques. In addition to the nature of active metal phase, the choice of support also has a large effect on the catalytic performance. CeO2, a well-known functional rare earth material, has been widely used in many catalytic reactions due to its ability to vary the oxygen concentration without changing phase, providing a large and stable capacity for oxygen storage. For CeO2 supported metal catalysts, the catalytic activity of many reactions, including catalytic oxidations [42], reduction [43], reforming [44], ammonia synthesis [45], etc. are reported to depend on the morphology and exposed planes. Moreover, the shape of CeO2 nanoparticle has also been reported to strongly affect the metal-CeO2 interaction and thus tuned up the catalytic performance of CeO2-supported metal catalyst. The morphology and exposed crystal planes of active metals such as Pt and Pd have been demonstrated to play key roles in the catalytic performance of biomass platform chemical hydrogenation [46,47]. Somorjai et al. [46] found that the product selectivity was highly dependent on the shape of Pt in furfural hydrogenation. Octahedral Pt nanoparticles selectively produced furfuryl alcohol, while cube Pt yielded both an equal amount of furan and furfuryl alcohol. Vinod et al. [47] reported that the exposed Pd (1 0 0) facet achieved a high selectivity (~90%) of cyclohexanone in phenol hydrogenation. However, few literature have disclosed the crucial role of support morphology and related crystal planes in the catalytic conversion of biomass. In this paper, Ru/CeO2 catalysts with three types of CeO2 (nanorod, nanocube and octahedral) supports were prepared for EL hydrogenation to GVL, in which the CeO2 exposed different facets of (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1). The rod CeO2 supported Ru achieved excellent catalytic performance, reaching 99.4% GVL yield. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation, a powerful tool to explore the reaction mechanism on metal-oxide interface structure at the atomic level [48,49], has been applied for elucidating the key role of CeO2 facets. The overall reaction diagrams of EL hydrogenation to GVL reveals that the activation energy barrier generally follows the order of Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) < Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0) < Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 1). The shape-dependent performance of Ru/CeO2 catalyst for EL hydrogenation to GVL are strongly related to CeO2 exposed facets and the concentration of oxygen vacancies."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemical reagents,"2.1 Chemical reagents Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China (SCRC)), NaOH (Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), NaPO4·12H2O (SCRC), NaBH4 (SCRC), RuCl3·3H2O (SCRC), and SiO2 (Qingdao Ocean Chemical CO., Ltd., China)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Ceria nanorods (CeO2-rod) and nanocubes (CeO2-cube) were prepared by the hydrolysis of Ce(III) ions in a condensed NaOH solution, followed by a hydrothermal treatment [50]. Typically, 1.736 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 19.2 g NaOH were dissolved in 10 and 70 mL deionized water at 25 °C, respectively. After the mixing of two solutions, the mixture was kept stirring for another 30 min at 25 °C. Then, the sealed Teflon bottle with suspension was placed in a stainless steel autoclave, and hydrothermally treated at 100 °C or 180 °C for 24 h to obtain ceria nanorods or cubes, respectively. The formed solids were separated by filtration and washed by deionized water at 25 °C until the pH of filtrate is close to 7, followed by drying at 100 °C for 12 h and calcination at 500 °C for 3 h in air. For the synthesis of ceria octahedron (CeO2-octa) [51], 0.858 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.0076 g NaPO4·12H2O were firstly dissolved in 10 and 70 mL deionized water at 25 °C, respectively. Then, these two solutions were mixed together, and stirred for another 30 min at 25 °C. After sealing the Teflon bottle in a stainless steel autoclave, the mixture was heated at 170 °C for 10 h. The gained solids were separated by centrifugation and washed by deionized water and methanol for several times at 25 °C. The sample was dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in air. All Ru/CeO2 samples and Ru/SiO2 were prepared by deposition methods. 0.2 g CeO2 was added into 10 mL RuCl3 (0.004 mol/L) aqueous solution and stirred vigorously at 25 °C for 1 h. 2.37 mL NaBH4 solution (0.25 mol/L) was dripped into the above mixture under stirring condition at 25 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the solid catalyst was separated by centrifugation and dried in vacuum overnight at 80 °C."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore size were examined by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Prior to the measurement, the sample was pretreated under vacuum at 250 °C for 8 h. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Optima 2100 DV, PerkinElmer) was used to analyze element content. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku MiniFlex II desktop X-ray diffractometer operated at 30 kV and 15 mA with Cu Kα radiation. The data were collected in a 2θ range of 5–90° at a scanning speed of 4° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed on a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DLD spectrometer with a monochromated Al Kα radiation source (hv = 1486.6 eV) and a multichannel detector. All spectra were recorded by using an aperture slot of 300 × 700 μm, and survey spectra were recorded with a pass energy of 160 eV while high-resolution spectra with a pass energy of 40 eV. Before XPS measurement, the as-prepared Ru/CeO2 samples were pretreated in H2 at 100 °C for 1 h in an auxiliary pretreatment chamber, and then transferred to XPS measurement chamber under high vacuum conditions without air exposure. The binding energies were calibrated by the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as reference. The experiment error was given within ±0.1 eV. Raman spectra were performed on a Horiba Labram HR800 spectrometer. An Ar+ laser operating at 514 nm was employed as the excitation source with a power of 30 MW. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM 7001-F, JEOL). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was taken on a field emission transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Prior to the tests, the as-prepared Ru/CeO2 samples were dispersed in ethanol with ultrasonication for 15 min, dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid, and dried in a vacuum oven without air exposure. Temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) was conducted on Micromeritics Autochem 2920. The sample was generally pretreated in Ar at 300 °C for 0.5 h, and then cooled to 30 °C. Subsequently, the sample was heated from 30 °C to 500 °C at a rate of 5°/min in 10 vol% H2/Ar and the consumed H2 was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). CO-chemisorption was performed with the same apparatus as H2-TPR. After the pretreatment in Ar at 300 °C for 0.5 h, the cooled sample was injected in pulse by pure CO at 30 °C. The Ru particle size was determined by assuming that the stoichmetry of adsorbed CO molecule to surface Ru atom was one."
5,DFT calculation,"2.4 DFT calculation The calculations were conducted in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with plane-wave-based periodic DFT method [52,53]. The exchange and correlation energy were treated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, while the electron-ion interactions were described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) setups [54,55]. Previous studies [56,57] have confirmed that Ru10 cluster is very stable and generally used as a DFT model to investigate adsorption and reaction mechanism for various reactions. Further increase in Ru atoms cannot change the reaction trend in binding energy. Accordingly, Ru10/CeO2 should be reasonable to describe the trend in the catalytic properties of Ru/CeO2 catalysts at the interface. The three Ru/CeO2 interface models (Fig. S1) were built with a 10 Ru atoms clusters bound to CeO2 (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) facets, in which 3 × 3 supercell with 4 layer slab was used to describe CeO2. The highly localized Ce 4f orbital electron was treated using DFT + U method with a U value of 5. Oxygen vacancies were created by removing one oxygen atom for CeO2 (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) facets while two oxygen atoms for (1 1 0). Adsorption energy (Eads) of stable intermediate states was defined relative to clean slab (Eslab) and substrate gas molecule (Esub) according to Eads = Esub/slab − Eslab − Esub, in which Esub/slab is the total energy of adsorbed substrate on slab surface. The transition states (TSs) were located by a climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [58,59], and confirmed by the existence of a single imaginary vibrational mode along the reaction coordinate. Activation energy (Ea) of elementary reaction was calculated by the energy difference between TS and initial state (IS). Reaction energy (Er) was defined by the energy difference between final state (FS) and IS."
6,Catalysts activity tests,"2.5 Catalysts activity tests The hydrogenation of EL was conducted in a 10 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (NS-10-316L, Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd.). In a typical run, 2 mmol EL, 4 g H2O, and 0.01 g catalyst (Catalyst particle size is ca. 50 μm and internal diffusion effect has been excluded.) were charged into the autoclave. The reactor was purged with H2 for five times and pressurized to 4 MPa. The stirring speed was fixed as 1200 rpm. Then, the autoclave was heated to the desired temperature, and kept for a designated time. Subsequently, the reactor system was quickly cooled down in an ice-water trap. The mixture was separated by centrifugation. The liquid supernatant were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014C) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-WAX capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 0.25 μm). All the liquid products were identified by GC–MS. The solid catalyst after reaction was separated by repeatedly centrifugation and then dried at 80 °C. The dried catalyst was reduced by a certain amount of NaBH4 solution (0.25 mol/L). After that, the spent catalyst was conducted for reusability test under the same conditions as above."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural and morphological study,"3.1 Structural and morphological study Fig. 1 shows SEM and TEM images of three Ru/CeO2 catalysts and bare CeO2 support, confirming the formation of CeO2 nanorods, nanocubes and octahedral, respectively. Some CeO2-cubes are aggregated and not totally uniform in size, because the rate of nucleation and crystallization are hard to self-control at 180 °C owing to lack of stabilization agents. Compared to bare CeO2 support, CeO2 morphology shows no apparent change after loading Ru. Some Ru nanoparticles can be roughly observed on the edges of CeO2 surface. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis in Fig. 2 indicates that CeO2-rod predominantly exposes (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) facets, while CeO2-cube and CeO2-octa expose (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surface facets [50,51,60,61], respectively. The exposed facets of CeO2 (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) can be definitely verified by their lattice spacings of 0.19 nm, 0.27 nm and 0.31 nm, respectively. HRTEM images in Fig. 2 clearly show that Ru nanoparticles strongly anchor on the surface or edges of CeO2. The corresponding lattice spacing of 0.204 nm and 0.214 nm are indexed to the (1 0 1) and (0 0 2) planes of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Ru [62]. The Ru nanoparticles are directly connected to CeO2, an indication of forming strong anchoring interface. Ru nanocrystals are uniformly distributed on the CeO2 support with an average size of 1.7 nm, 3.3 nm and 5.3 nm for the Ru/CeO2-rod, Ru/CeO2-cube and Ru/CeO2-octa catalysts, respectively. As listed in Table 1 , the calculated Ru dispersion based on TEM counting is well consistent with the results of CO-chemisorption. Large oxygen vacancies (see below) and high surface area (Table 1) of CeO2-rod (1 1 0) plane enable Ru bind to CeO2 and disperse Ru species, thus leading to very high Ru dispersion over Ru/CeO2-rod. The presence of many diffraction rings in selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 2a3, b3 and c3 can be used to confirm the crystalline nature of CeO2, which was taken from an area of ~300 nm in diameter. The ring patterns can be indexed to (1 1 1), (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (3 1 1) and (2 2 2) facets of fluorite crystal CeO2 structure, in agreement with XRD results. The XRD patterns of CeO2 and Ru/CeO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . All the CeO2 supports display a cubic fluorite-type CeO2 phase at 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.4° and 56.3° (PDF#43-1002). After Ru deposition, XRD patterns of Ru/CeO2 catalysts are almost the same as those of pure CeO2 supports. After the introduction of Ru species, there are no new diffraction peaks corresponding to RuO2 phase (at around 28° or 35°) or Ru phase (at around 44°) [63]. The absence of peaks related to Ru species is attributed to low content of Ru or high dispersion of Ru species on CeO2. The chemical states of Ru and their concentrations on the surface of Ru/CeO2 catalysts were detected by in situ XPS spectra after H2 treatment at 100 °C. All XPS spectra are calibrated by C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The Ru 3d signal interferes with the C 1s signal, and thus is difficult to resolve. Instead, we measured Ru 3p to study the chemical states of Ru. Fig. 4 a shows the Ru 3p XPS spectra of Ru/CeO2 catalysts. The peaks at about 461.5 eV and 463.1 eV are assigned to Ru0 and Ru4+, respectively [64]. As shown in Table 2 , the intensity ratio of Ru0/(Ru0 + Ru4+) is 79.4%, 66.3% and 52.2% for Ru/CeO2-rod, Ru/CeO2-cube, and Ru/CeO2-octa, respectively. Therefore, the surface Ru0/(Ru0 + Ru4+) ratio is strongly influenced by the nature of support. Additionally, the spent Ru/CeO2-rod (Fig. 4d) exhibits similar Ru0/(Ru0 + Ru4+) ratio as the fresh one, suggesting that the Ru states kept stable during the reaction. Fig. 4b shows the O 1s XPS spectra of Ru/CeO2 catalysts. There are two clear oxidation states of surface oxygen. Binding energy at 529.4–529.8 eV is assigned to lattice oxygen (OL) and the peak at 531.1–531.5 eV is characteristic of O2− in oxygen deficient regions (Ov) [65,66]. The Ov/OL ratio is, therefore, a measure for the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies on CeO2 nanoparticles. Table 2 displays that the ratio of Ov/OL decreases in the order of Ru/CeO2-rod > Ru/CeO2-cube > Ru/CeO2-octa. Compared to bare CeO2 support (Fig. S2), addition Ru to CeO2 can mildly declines the concentration of oxygen vacancies, because Ru species can bind to oxygen defects sites. The change trend of Ru/CeO2 kept the same as bare CeO2. As illustrated in Fig. 4c, the Ce 3d XPS spectra consists of two series of spin-orbit lines u and v. There are ten peaks resulting from the pairs of spin orbit doublets, which can be identified through deconvolution. Ce 3d3/2 spin-obit components include three characteristic peaks labeled as u (900.8 ± 0.2 eV), u″ (907.3 ± 0.1 eV) and u″′ (916.7 ± 0.2 eV), which correspond to u lines. Ce 3d5/2 spin-orbit components include three peaks labeled as v (882.4 ± 0.2 eV), v″ (888.6 ± 0.3 eV) and v″′ (898.5 ± 0.25 eV), which are assigned to v lines. These three pairs of peaks are related to the characteristic peaks of Ce4+. Moreover, the residual four spectral lines labeled as u0 (898.5 ± 0.25 eV), v0 (881.4 ± 0.22 eV), u′ (903.1 ± 0.8 eV) and v′ (884.6 ± 0.8 eV) belong to the Ce3+ species [43,66]. The appearance of Ce3+ species leads to the formation of oxygen vacancy on the CeO2 surface. The high concentration of Ce3+ on the surface reflects the formation of large amounts of surface oxygen vacancies [65–67]. As listed in Table 2, Ru/CeO2-rod has the highest atomic ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ (0.91), followed by Ru/CeO2-cube (0.50) and Ru/CeO2-octa (0.42). This is exactly consistent with the Ov/OL results. Raman spectra of Ru/CeO2 with different morphology were performed and the results are displayed in Fig. 5 a. All Ru/CeO2 samples have a very sharp peak around 470 cm−1, which is assigned to fluorite F2g mode of CeO2 [61]. The peak centered at 270 cm−1 is related to a second-order transverse acoustic mode [61]. Additionally, Ru/CeO2-rod shows two obvious peaks around 610 cm−1 and 995 cm−1, which are linked with oxygen defect of CeO2 owing to the formation of oxygen vacancy [61,67]. The peak intensity of oxygen vacancy declines in the order Ru/CeO2-rod > Ru/CeO2-cube > Ru/CeO2-octa, in well line with XPS results. As shown in the H2-TPR profiles of Fig. 5b, all the bare CeO2 supports display a broad H2 consumption peak around 420 °C, which is assigned to the reduction of surface oxygen [61]. In comparison to CeO2-cube and CeO2-octa, CeO2-rod possesses a much larger H2 reduction peak, suggesting its high oxygen mobility. Addition of Ru to CeO2 suppresses the reduction of CeO2, probably because Ru binds to surface O sites and forms strong RuOCe bond. All the Ru/CeO2 samples exhibits two reduction temperature centered at ~80 °C and ~250 °C, respectively, which are assigned to the reduction of RuO2 with different strengths of interaction with CeO2 [43]. Compared to Ru/CeO2-cube and Ru/CeO2-octa, Ru/CeO2-rod possesses much less high temperature peak area, indicating that its RuO2 species can be easily reduced. The high Ru0/(Ru0 + Ru4+) ratio and reduction degree are also confirmed by XPS results, because small Ru nanoparticles dispersed in high surface area CeO2-rod tend to reduce easily. When Ru/CeO2-rod was pre-reduced by NaBH4 and pretreated carefully in a vacuum glove box, its H2-TPR profile shows that the low temperature peak disappears while the high temperature peak remains, indicating that the weakly interacted RuO2 is totally reduced by NaBH4. As can be seen from Fig. 5b, the reduction of strongly interacted RuOCe species needs the temperature at least 180 °C, and thus NaBH4 pre-reduced Ru/CeO2 catalyst can keep stable Ru0/Ru4+ states during the course of reaction, consistent with XPS results."
9,Catalytic performance of EL hydrogenation to GVL,"3.2 Catalytic performance of EL hydrogenation to GVL The reaction temperature has a profound effect on the reaction rate. Thus, the hydrogenation of EL was carried out at different reaction temperatures, ranging from 40 to 100 °C (Fig. 6 a–c). When the reaction proceeded at 40 °C, almost 100% conversions of EL were achieved over three types of Ru/CeO2 catalysts. However, their yields of GVL were less than 10% and the major products were ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (EHP). With the increase of reaction temperature, the GVL yields continuously increased along with the gradual decrease of EHP. At 100 °C, the Ru/CeO2-rod catalyst reached the highest yield of GVL (54.8%), followed by Ru/CeO2-cube (33.2%) and Ru/CeO2-octa (14.4%). Obviously, all the three catalysts present high activity and completely convert EL at low temperature (40 °C), but their yields of the target product (GVL) are different. Since Ru/CeO2-rod obtained the highest yield of GVL, we selected it to investigate the influence of reaction time on the hydrogenation of EL (Fig. 6d). On the Ru/CeO2-rod catalyst, the conversion of EL reached 99.7% and the yield of GVL was 21% for only 5 min of reaction time. GVL yield gradually increased as the reaction proceeded. The maximum yield of GVL (99.4%) occurred at 15 h. Meanwhile, the yield of EHP decreased from 78.9% to 0.6%. The recyclability result of Ru/CeO2-rod is presented in Fig. 7 a. The catalyst was reused for four catalytic runs with only a slight decrease in GVL yield. Additionally, the conversion of EL had been maintained at 100%. ICP test showed that no Ru ions were leached during the course of reaction. The TEM image of spent Ru/CeO2-rod in Fig. 7b presented good preservation of rod-shape CeO2 and highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, confirming the robust structure of Ru/CeO2-rod. XPS results of spent catalyst in Table 2, Fig. 4d and Fig. S3 indicate that Ru, O and Ce states basically kept stable during the reusability tests. The minor increase of Ce4+ species in spent Ru/CeO2-rod is probably due to the reason that the interface Ce3+ was involved into the catalytic cycle. The reaction pathway for the synthesis of GVL from EL hydrogenation is widely accepted in Scheme 1 . EL initially undergoes hydrogenation to the intermediate EHP followed by its lactonization. The reaction trends in our Ru/CeO2 conform to this pathway, in which an increase of GVL accompanies with the decrease of EHP, irrespective of the effect of reaction temperature or time. The conversion of EL is very high and reaches 100% at very low temperature or short time, and the major reaction product is EHP under these circumstances. However, the conversion of EHP to GVL needs much more reaction time or higher temperature. Conclusively, the reaction rate of the first step, that is the hydrogenation of EL to EHP, is very quick, while the rate of the subsequent conversion of EHP to GVL is much slower. Therefore, the second step is the rate-determining step of the whole reaction, in consistent with the kinetic study by Palkovits et al. [33]. In their report, the activation energy of EHP lactonization is 58 kJ/mol over Ru/C, higher than that of EL hydrogenation with 45 kJ/mol, also confirming that EHP lactonization is the rate-determining step. Turnover rate (TOR) [46] can be used to reflect the production rate of GVL based on accessible surface Ru atoms at the initial reaction time. As displayed in Table 1, Ru/CeO2-rod achieved excellent TOR value, being 13,140 h−1 at 100 °C. However, the TOR values of Ru/CeO2-cube and Ru/CeO2-octa were only 3250 h−1 and 1660 h−1, respectively. Unexpectedly, the TOR of Ru/CeO2-rod is ca. 4 or 8 times higher than that of Ru/CeO2-cube and Ru/CeO2-octa. Along with the high yield of GVL up to 99.4%, Ru/CeO2-rod has been demonstrated an excellent catalyst in the conversion of EL to GVL, superior to most of previous counterparts under similar conditions [35,36,38]. Various sizes (1.2 nm, 1.7 nm, 2.9 nm and 4.1 nm) of Ru nanoparticles were synthesized by controlling Ru contents to investigate Ru size effect on GVL production in EL hydrogenation. As illustrated in Fig. 7c, the TOR values basically kept constant with an increasing Ru particle size. Accordingly, the correlation between TOR with Ru particle size has excluded the particle size effect, and thus Ru particle size cannot be a predominant factor in controlling reaction performance. Moreover, the initial hydrogenation of EL to EHP is not the rate-determining step. Thus, the huge difference in reactivity is strongly related to CeO2, particularly for the exposed facets. Compared to CeO2 octahedron and cube, CeO2 rod should be better support for anchoring Ru in constructing Ru/CeO2 interface. The CeO2 octahedron and cube expose (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) facets, while CeO2 rod exposes both (1 1 0) and (1 0 0). It can be inferred that the CeO2 (1 1 0) facet supported Ru reaches the highest performance, followed by (1 0 0) and the worst (1 1 1) facet."
10,Effect of support on the performance of Ru/CeO2,"3.3 Effect of support on the performance of Ru/CeO2 In order to further explain the effect of support morphology on the performance of Ru/CeO2 catalyst, we designed the experiment of adding support to reaction system. As displayed in Table 3 , the individual CeO2 support did not show any activity for EL conversion. All Ru/CeO2 catalysts gave complete conversion of EL at 100 °C, suggesting that the individual Ru or Ru/CeO2 interface are associated with initial hydrogenation of EL to EHP. When equal amounts of CeO2-rod and CeO2-octa were added to Ru/CeO2-octa catalyst, the yield of GVL increased obviously in comparison to Ru/CeO2-octa. Moreover, the introduction of CeO2-rod doubled the yield of GVL on the Ru/CeO2-octa. These above results directly reveal that CeO2 support can promote the lactonization of EHP to GVL on the Ru/CeO2 catalyst. However, the yield of GVL on Ru/CeO2-octa + CeO2 support was still much lower than that of Ru/CeO2-rod, indicating that the lactonization of EHP requires both Ru and CeO2, and the Ru/CeO2 interface possibly provides the predominant active site for the reaction. A comparable Ru/SiO2 gave high EL conversion (82.4%) and EHP yield (63.9%), but low GVL yield (18.5%). Combined with the reaction results of Ru/CeO2-rod, it can be inferred that the hydrogenation of EL to EHP can smoothly proceed on different Ru-based catalysts while the support plays a more important role on the conversion of EHP to GVL. The lactonization of EHP to GVL was also evaluated to probe the intrinsic active sites. Bare CeO2-octa and CeO2-rod reached very poor GVL yield, being 3.3% and 9.5%, respectively. Ru/CeO2-octa and Ru/CeO2-rod obtained 15.2% and 57.9% yield of GVL, respectively. These results indicate that the combination of Ru and CeO2 support is the predominant active site in determining GVL production. Moreover, support can greatly affect the catalytic performance of EHP lactonization to GVL. The high surface area and high concentration of oxygen vacancies of CeO2-rod facilitate the dispersion of Ru on CeO2 surface and formation Ru/CeO2 interface, which can likely promote the reaction performance."
11,Reaction mechanism of EL hydrogenation over Ru/CeO2 by DFT calculations,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of EL hydrogenation over Ru/CeO2 by DFT calculations DFT calculation was performed to understand the facet effect of the Ru/CeO2 interface during EL hydrogenation to GVL. Herein, the Ru10/CeO2 interface was modeled by depositing a small Ru cluster on CeO2 (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) facet, respectively. Surface oxygen vacancies were created by removing O atoms of CeO2 to account for the formation of Ce3+/Ce4+, as observed by XPS spectra. The oxygen vacancy formation energy of CeO2 (1 1 0) facet is calculated to be 1.63 eV, consistent with previous results [68,69]. The value of oxygen vacancy formation energy for CeO2 (1 1 0) is much lower than that of CeO2 (1 0 0) (1.91 eV) and CeO2 (1 1 1) (2.26 eV), indicating that CeO2 (1 1 0) facet facilitates creating more oxygen vacancies. Thus, two oxygens were removed over Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) while other two models depleted only one oxygen according to XPS results. To study the interface interaction between Ru10 clusters and CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with oxygen vacancies, the adsorption energy is defined (Eads = E(Ru10/CeO2) − E(CeO2) − E(Ru10)) and calculated by DFT modelling. The adsorption energy is calculated to be −6.04 eV, confirming that Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) is a stable interface model structure. Compared to previous references such as Ru10 clusters supported on ZrO2 [70] or TiO2 [70,71], the rather low adsorption energy of Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) indicates that Ru10 clusters are strongly bound on CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with oxygen vacancies. Tables S1–S3 display the most stable adsorption structure of reaction intermediates that are involved in EL hydrogenation. The adsorption energy (-2.33 eV) for EL on Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) is much stronger than that for Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0) (-0.53 eV) and Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 1) (−1.53 eV), suggesting that the activation and transformation of EL is easier to occur at Ru/CeO2 (1 1 0) interface. On Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0), the two carbonyl oxygen from acetyl and ester groups are bound strongly to the atop sites of Ru with the Ru-O bond lengths of 1.994 Å and 2.050 Å. Similar EL adsorption structure is observed in the case of Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 1). Only the oxygen atom of ester group is weakly adsorbed to the atop site of Ru with longer Ru-O bond distance of 2.177 Å on Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0). More electron-deficient oxygen vacancies on CeO2 surface of Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) can attract Ru electrons, which makes the electron-deficient Ru facilitate adsorption electron-rich O atoms of EL. On Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0), the oxygen atoms locate on the subsurface, and thus the oxygen vacancy effect on the adsorption of EL is greatly suppressed. For other species, the O or C atoms also tend to bind on interfacial Ru sites not on CeO2, while the adsorption energy and structure differ greatly on Ru10/CeO2 with different facets. However, surface Ru site prefers to adsorb H2* in comparison with interfacial Ru. As mentioned above, the reaction pathway of EL hydrogenation to GVL undergoes initial hydrogenation to EHP followed by its lactonization, as confirmed by our experiment results. As displayed in Tables S4–S6, the activation energies, reaction energies and TS configurations for every elementary reactions [33,72] were calculated on Ru10/CeO2 with different facets. Fig. 8 compares their reaction diagrams of EL hydrogenation to GVL. On Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0), the adsorbed H2* is dissociated very easily on Ru sites and has nearly no activation energy barrier. According to previous study [72,73], the carbonyl of EL can prefer to undergo initial CH bond hydrogenation with low activation energy of 0.32 eV and reaction energy of −0.31 eV. The generated CH3CHOCH2CH2COOCH2CH3* (AL) further proceeds to hydrogenation to a key intermediate EHP with moderate activation energy of 0.63 eV. Subsequently, EHP initially eliminates CH3CH2O* with low activation energy of 0.43 eV followed by dehydrogenation to produce CH3CHOCH2CH2CO* with moderate activation energy of 0.68 eV. Both the elimination of CH3CH2O* and dehydrogenation steps are thermodynamically favourable. Finally, the formed CH3CHOCH2CH2CO* proceeds to lactonization to generate GVL*, which is thermodynamically unfavourable (0.45 eV) and requires a high activation energy of 0.91 eV. Notably, the remaining CH3CH2O* will react with nearby H* to produce CH3CH2OH* with moderate activation barrier (0.46 eV). During the whole pathway, the lactonization of CH3CHOCH2CH2CO* to produce GVL requires the highest activation barrier of 0.91 eV, and this step should be the rate-determining step for EL hydrogenation on Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0). This conclusion is consistent with our and previous experiment results [33] that the reaction rate of EHP lactonization to GVL is much lower than that of EL initial hydrogenation to EHP. As displayed in Fig. 8, the stability of adsorbed intermediates generally follows the order of Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) > Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 1) > Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0). Compared to Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 1) and Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0), an obvious enhancement of adsorption energy of intermediates on Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0), such as EL + H*, EHP* and others, is found by generally > 0.4 eV. These increased stability would ensure that the intermediates on Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) interface would be found at higher surface coverage at equilibrium conditions. More importantly, the activation barriers of all elementary steps on Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) are similar or lower than those of Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0) and Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 1). On all the Ru10/CeO2 three models, the lactonization of CH3CHOCH2CH2CO* to produce GVL is the rate-determining step and the activation barriers are 0.91 eV, 1.15 eV and 1.24 eV for Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1), respectively. Obviously, the low reaction energy barrier greatly improves the production rate of GVL in EL hydrogenation in Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0), in well line with the observations of reaction results. According to our experimental results and DFT calculations, it can be inferred that the Ru/CeO2 interface plays a decisive role in the catalytic reaction cycle of EL hydrogenation to GVL, particularly in the rate-determining step. Thus, the Ru/CeO2 interface should be the predominant active sites. Of course, the surface Ru site enable H2 to activate and dissociate to H* and should be the minor active center. Therefore, the great difference in GVL yield in the three Ru/CeO2 catalysts with different shape is strongly related to the Ru/CeO2 interface, namely the different CeO2 facets structure. Ru/CeO2 (1 1 0) surface possesses more electron-deficient oxygen vacancies and decreases the adsorption energy of EL and other intermediates, correspondingly resulting in low activation energy barriers in EL hydrogenation to GVL. It is evident that the GVL production rate, namely TOR, is linearly proportional to the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies (OV/OL) (Fig. 9 ), directly confirming the key role of oxygen vacancies. Apparently, the CeO2 surface structure and concentration of oxygen vacancies determine the property of Ru/CeO2 interface, which leads to the well-known facet effect."
12,Conclusions,"Three Ru/CeO2 catalysts with different support morphology (rod, cube and octahedron) were well controllably synthesized and different facets were exposed, including (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1). The Ru/CeO2-rod with primarily exposed (1 1 0) facet achieved the best catalytic performance in EL hydrogenation to GVL, resulting in 99.4% GVL yield and 13,140 h−1 of TOR value. DFT calculations showed that the lactonization of CH3CHOCH2CH2CO* to produce GVL is the rate-determining step in EL hydrogenation. The Ru/CeO2 interface is the predominant active sites, while the surface Ru sites synergistically activate and dissociate H2 to H*. Moreover, the overall reaction diagrams of EL hydrogenation to GVL reveals the activation energy barrier generally follows the order of Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 0) < Ru10/CeO2 (1 0 0) < Ru10/CeO2 (1 1 1), particularly the rate-determining step, which is consistent with the reaction trends of Ru/CeO2. The shape dependent catalytic behavior of Ru/CeO2 in EL hydrogenation to GVL is strongly associated with their different support facets. The concentration of oxygen vacancies is linearly proportional to GVL production rate, highlighting the critical role of CeO2 surface oxygen vacancies in Ru/CeO2 interface. Solid evidence in our work confirms that the surface CeO2 structure and concentration of oxygen vacancies determine the well-known facet effect in catalysis chemistry."
