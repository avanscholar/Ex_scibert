0,Introduction,"Several types of polymeric particulate systems have been attempted as potential drug delivery systems to achieve site-specific and/or time-controlled delivery of small or large molecular weight drugs and other bioactive agents. As a family of particulate materials, hydrogel particles have gained considerable attention in recent years for their unique physicochemical properties resembling that of the living tissues such as high-water content, soft and rubbery consistency, low interfacial tension with water or biological fluids [1]. Hydrogels require control over the polymeric network structure for appropriate design, providing proper mechanical performances, tuning the degradation behavior of hydrogels and promoting the diffusion of bioactive agents. The choice of polymer, cross-linking reaction and cross-linking agent, as well as the fabrication techniques are key parameters that are receiving great attention to develop bespoke drug delivery system-based hydrogels for targeted applications. Microparticles, exhibiting particle sizes ranging from a few to several hundred microns, have stimulated great interest in academia and industry due to their simplicity and versatility, many products have been commercialized [2]. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels have been recognized as promising biomaterials and suitable candidates for drug delivery systems [3] in oral, transdermal, buccal, intramuscular, rectal routes of administration [4]. PVA-based dosage forms can have different designs and shapes depending on the route of drug administration. The production of membranes and fibers based on PVA has been extensively reported [5–11], on the contrary, only few examples are available for the production of PVA particles [12–14]. The potential application of a drug delivery system depends on the choice of the drug carrier [15]. Membranes find broad application in pills, implants and patches for oral and transdermal/ocular delivery, respectively. Particulate drug delivery systems have attracted much attention due to the large surface to volume ratio associated with the small size. This has many effects on functioning of the particles and their properties. Size has a marked effect on ability of drug-delivery carriers to cross cell membranes, on bioavailability and blood circulation time. However, the selection of the appropriate production approach can tweak the functionality of the carriers. For instance, during particle formation, drugs contained in the dispersed phase of nascent particles formed by an emulsion system can partition into the surrounding external continuous phase, leading to substantial loss of payload. This uncontrolled reagent manipulation can ensue in the production of carriers with a low encapsulation efficiency and drug loading. Consequently, there is a need of developing efficient approaches to promote a high and efficient loading of cargos, as well as to ensure a high reproducibility and scalability to translate the production from laboratory to mass scale. Through rational design, particulate drug-delivery systems can be manufactured to combine desirable structural properties (size, size distribution, morphology, surface properties) with their functionality (payload amount, drug delivery). Membrane emulsification (ME) is recognized as a powerful emulsification approach to assist particle formation at micro and nanoscale levels. Membrane emulsification exerts the advantages of governing and fine-tuning both structural and functional properties [16]. The template emulsions can be transformed into structured particles using a variety of solidification processes [17]. Membrane emulsification has been demonstrated to be one of the most efficient drug-encapsulation methods [18,19]. It is rationalized because droplets generation occurs by a drop-by-drop mechanism instead of drop disruption, evading the loss of payload by surrounding external continuous phase. In addition, the emulsification mechanism and the solidification conditions achieved in solid-lipid particles produced by membrane emulsification have been well-correlated with the improved encapsulation efficiency of amphiphilic and hydrophilic drugs [20–22]. Several marketed drugs suffer from poor water solubility, low permeability, rapid metabolism and elimination from the body along with poor safety and tolerability. For that reason, the encapsulation of lipophilic drugs by membrane emulsification has stimulated great interest in a myriad of scientific and biomedical fields [23]. However, considering that the majority of drugs are hydrophilic, and of these, many are low-molecular-weight molecules (less than 500 Da), there are several drawbacks to consider in order to improve their bioavailability [24]: 1) Hydrophilic drugs are often subject to low intracellular absorption, enzymatic degradation at the digestive tract and rapid renal clearance; 2) Low bioavailability can lead to lower than expected drug concentration, resulting in sub-optimal drug distribution and compromising pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics targets. Consequently, the controlled production of particulate delivery systems with a high loading of hydrophilic, low molecular weight drugs is currently an ambitious goal. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of membrane emulsification on hydrophilic drug encapsulation for continuous production of particulate materials based on hydrogels has never been evaluated. The work is expected to afford new insights in nano- and micro-scale design associated with PVA hydrogels for biomedical applications from their manufacturing to the design of functional material properties. Then, the aim of this work was to develop high-drug loading systems in continuous flow for a controlled delivery of hydrophilic bioactive molecules based on uniformly distributed PVA-based hydrogel microparticles by membrane emulsification approach. Conventional homogenization process was selected to benchmark the production of PVA microparticles and their physical and chemical properties. Two water-soluble bioactive molecules have been used as model drugs: Catechol and Diclofenac Sodium. Catechol is a benzene derivative molecule with two neighboring (ortho-) hydroxyl groups and plays a variety of important roles in biological processes [11]. Diclofenac sodium is the salt form of a phenylacetic acid and it is used in rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative joint disease, ankylosing spondylitis and allied conditions, as well as in the treatment of pain resulting from minor surgery, trauma and dysmenorrhea for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties [25]. As a novelty, this work has attempted the study of catechol and diclofenac sodium loading in PVA hydrogel microparticles produced by membrane emulsification and homogenization processes, coupled with chemical cross-linking reaction. Drug physicochemical properties, as well as the drug release profiles were studied on PVA hydrogel microparticles. Finally, as the main target of herein produced PVA microparticles is mainly focused on a biomedical application as drug delivery systems, it was evaluated their in-vitro toxicity in order to consider them as potential vectors for biomedicine drug delivery uses. This study is expected to give more insight for the micro-scale design associated with PVA hydrogels for the potential development of drug delivery devices."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The polymer used in this study was Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, average MW 13,000–28,000 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Catechol (CA) and diclofenac sodium (DS) supplied by Sigma-Aldrich were used as model drugs. Span 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as stabilizer in the external phase during the microencapsulation process and isooctane (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as organic solvent. Toluene, glutaraldehyde (GA) and Benzoyl chloride were used for microparticles solidification step and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich."
3,Drug-loaded microparticles preparation by membrane emulsification,"2.2 Drug-loaded microparticles preparation by membrane emulsification The dispersed phase used to produce the w/o emulsion was obtained by dissolving PVA in water (90 °C) at adequate polymer concentration (1, 3.5, 7 and 15 wt.%). The continuous phase was an isooctane solution containing Span 80 at 20 mg mL−1. To evaluate the encapsulation efficiency and drug loading, the dispersed phase was modified by including catechol or diclofenac of sodium (1 and 10 g L−1, for both the drugs). The w/o emulsion was prepared by using a Shirasu porous glass-based (SPG, Miyazaki, Japan), hydrophobic, tubular membrane with a pore size of 1 μm having a membrane area of 31.3 cm2. The dispersed (aqueous) phase was injected through the membrane under gas pressure. A dispersed phase flux (Jd) of 4.5 Lh−1 m−2 was used in all the experiments. The continuous phase was agitated by means of a pulsed back-and-forward mode along the lumen side of the membrane by using a programmable peristaltic pump (Digi-Staltic double-Y Masterflex® pump Micropump, model GJ-N23.JF1SAB1) [26] using a continuous phase Flow value ( Q c ) as 850 mL min−1, continuous phase displaced volume ( V c ) of 2.8 mL corresponding to a shear stress ( τ m a x ) of 2.08 Pa calculated using the following equation, as reported in previous papers [26,27]. (1) τ m a x = 2 α π f 1.5 ( μ c ρ c ) 0.5 (2) α = 4 V c π d h 2 (3) f = 2 Q c V c According to Eq. (1), shear stress is a function of the amplitude (α, Eq. (2)) and frequency (f, Eq. (3)). μc is the continuous phase viscosity [Pa·s] and ρc is the continuous phase density [kg·m−3]. The volume ratio % of the dispersed phase obtained for each experiment respect to the continuous phase was 20 %. The emulsification process was carried out at 20 ± 5 °C. The membrane was pre-wetted in the continuous phase solution before each experiment. After each experiment, a membrane cleaning step was carried out by using soap solution. The liquid droplets obtained by membrane emulsification (Fig. 1 ) were precipitated as solid microparticles by the addition of toluene saturated with glutaraldehyde (cross-linking agent). The particles with toluene saturated with glutaraldehyde were stirred for 2 h. The cross-linking reaction was also attempted using benzoyl chloride as a cross-linking catalyst [14]. The resulting particles were centrifuged at 2100 g for 10 min and the supernatant was stored for further analysis while the pellet was lyophilized using a LyoAlfa 10/15 from Telstar for 24 h (0.01 bar, −40 °C)."
4,Drug-loaded microparticles preparation by rotor-stator homogenization process,"2.3 Drug-loaded microparticles preparation by rotor-stator homogenization process The same dispersed phase and continuous phase composition was used for the preparation of microparticles by a rotor-stator homogenizer (OV5, Velp Scientifica). 6 mL of dispersed phase were added dropwise to the continuous phase (30 mL) and mixed at 10.000 rpm for 1 min. Liquid droplets were solidified as described above."
5,Drug-loaded microparticles characterization,"2.4 Drug-loaded microparticles characterization 2.4.1 Particle analysis Microparticles were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using Inspect F50 operated at 10–15 kV; FEI from Eindhoven, Netherlands at the LMA-INA-Universidad Zaragoza facilities. Prior the observation, the sample was stained with a phosphotungstic acid solution (75 mg mL−1) and washed three times with distilled water. One drop of the particulate dispersion was placed on a glass slide, dried overnight and sputtered with platinum to improve electron transfer during SEM analysis. The size distribution was expressed in terms of the surface weighted median diameter or Sauter diameter (D(3,2)) calculated according to Eq. (4). (4) D 3,2 = ∑ D i 3 n i ∑ D i 2 n i Where Di is particle diameter of class i and ni is number of particles in class i. The width of particle size distribution was expressed as Span number calculated by Eq. (5). (5) S p a n = D 90 - D ( 10 ) D ( 50 ) Where D(X) is the diameter corresponding to the percent of volume on a relative cumulative particle size curve. To achieve a robust particle size characterization, an adequate number of SEM images (at least five) and more than 400 microparticles were counted and measured. Attenuated Total Reflectance-FTIR spectra were recorded on loaded and unloaded particles using a Vertex-70 FTIR spectrophotometer (Brucker, USA) to evaluate the molecular structure and possible compounds interaction. 2.4.2 Encapsulation efficiency and drug loading The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL) have been evaluated according to the following equations (Eqs. (6) and (7)), as reported in previous papers [16,20]: (6) E E = D r u g e n c a p D r u g t o t a l * 100 (7) D L = D r u g e n c a p P V A t o t a l * 100 Where EE is the encapsulation efficiency (%), Drugencap is mass of drug (catechol or diclofenac sodium) encapsulated (mg) measured by mass balance, Drugtotal is the initial Drug (catechol or diclofenac sodium) mass in the dispersed phase(mg), DL is drug loading efficiency (%) and PVAtotal is the initial PVA mass in the dispersed phase (mg). The drug content has been measured by HPLC analysis. For catechol, a reversed-phase Luna C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) was used. The mobile phase was water/acetic acid (99:1, v/v) (70 %, solvent A) and methanol/acetonitrile/ acetic acid at (90/9/1, v/v) (30 %, solvent B). The flow rate was 1 mL min−1 and detection was obtained at 280 nm by the UV detector. The linear regression coefficient (R2) was determined in the range 0.01–0.5 mg mL−1 as 0.9993 (n = 5). For diclofenac sodium, a reversed-phase C18 column (2.6 μm, 50 × 4.6 mm Phenomenex kinetex) was used. HPLC analysis was performed at 40 °C and the mobile phase was acetonitrile/water (50/50 v/v). The flow rate was 0.4 mL min−1 and detection was obtained at 260 nm by UV detection. The linear regression coefficient (R2) was determined in the range 0.01–30 μg mL−1 as 0.9993 (n = 10). The supernatant collected after samples centrifugation after emulsification and cross-linking reaction (as previously described) has been analysed by HPLC for encapsulation efficiency determination. 2.4.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed to characterize the thermal properties of drug loaded and unloaded microparticles. For TGA tests (PerkinElmer, TGA 7, Norwalk, CT), 6 mg of each sample was heated from 30 to 794 °C at 10 °C/min. DSC (PerkinElmer, DSC7) curves were obtained by heating 6 mg of the samples from 30 to 240 °C at 10 °C/min under a nitrogen ﬂow of 50 mL/min to investigate the melting and crystallization behavior of the samples. After that the samples were cooled and then heated by a second step, from 30 to 240 °C, at 10 °C/min. 2.4.4 Swelling studies The swelling study was performed on the PVA particles cross-linked with different GA:PVA ratios (0.05-0.2). 0.5 g of PVA particles were mixed with 10 mL of swelling (release) media (water) and the samples were placed in a moisture analyzer (MB45 Moisture Analyzer; OHAUS, USA). Kinetic swelling curves were made using the following equation: (8) % S w e l l i n g = W t o f s w o l l e n p a r t i c l e s - W t o f d r y p a r t i c l e s W t o f d r y p a r t i c l e s * 100 where Wt is the weight of particles."
6,In vitro drug release studies,"2.5 In vitro drug release studies About 0.5 g of lyophilized drug-loaded microparticles were transferred to the filtration cell using a cellulose acetate membrane of 0.45 μm. The particles were suspended in 10 mL of release media (water) at room temperature and stirred at 200 rpm. Samples of 1 mL were collected and 1 mL of release media have been added into the filtration cell. Drug content during the release study was evaluated by HPLC using the same method described above. The release profiles were evaluated by fitting the experimental data to equations describing different kinetic release. Linear regression analyses of the experimental data obtained from in-vitro drug release studies were made for four different models: zero order, first order, Korsmeyer–Peppas and Higuchi."
7,Cytocompatibility studies,"2.6 Cytocompatibility studies 2.6.1 Cell culture and -microparticles treatment Human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from Lonza (Belgium) while human tumoral cells U251MG were kindly gifted by Dr Pilar Martín-Duque. THP1 human monocytes were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, US). Fibroblasts and U251MG cells were grown in DMEM high glucose (Biowest, France) containing 2 mM of l-glutamine and supplemented with 10 % v/v fetal bovine serum (Gibco, UK) and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Biowest, France). THP1 monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Biowest, France) containing 2 mM of l-glutamine and supplemented with 10 % v/v fetal bovine serum, 1 % HEPES, 1 % Non Essential Aminoacids, 0.1 % 2-mercaptoethanol 50 mM, 1 % Sodium Pyruvate 100 mM, 1 % Penicilin/Streptomycin (100X) and 0.1 % Fungizone (1000X), all of them purchased from Gibco (UK). The differentiation of monocytes to macrophages was performed by the addition of 1 μM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma Aldrich, US) to the cell culture medium for 72 h obtaining the characteristic adherent morphology of macrophages. All cell types were cultured at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. PVA microparticles were resuspended in sterilized water and added to the cells at different concentrations between 0.05 and 0.4 mg mL−1. Microparticles were incubated together with cells for 24 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. 2.6.2 Alamar blue cell viability assay Alamar Blue Cell Viability Reagent (Invitrogen, US) was used to evaluate the viability related to the cellular metabolism after microparticles incubation. In brief, cell metabolic activity converts the non-fluorescent substrate resazurin into the fluorescent resorufin. The assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Alamar blue reagent was added to the cells (10 %) and after incubation (4 h, 37 °C, 5 % CO2), fluorescence was recorded (535/590 nm ex/em) in a Synergy HT Microplate Reader (Biotek, US). Control samples without cells were also run to test the potential microparticles interference with the assay. Experiments were performed in triplicate wells. 2.6.3 Effects of Microparticles in cell membrane Cells were treated for 24 h with PVA microparticles at a final concentration of 0.4 mg mL−1, collected in PBS and stained with Annexin V-FITC. Then, samples were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 100 μL Annexin V binding buffer, 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of propidium iodide to each 100 μL of cell suspension. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, 400 μL of Annexin V binding buffer were added and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSARIA BD equipment while results were analyzed by the software FACSDIVA BD (Cell Separation and Cytometry Unit, CIBA, IIS Aragon, Spain). Negative controls were also tested to determine the basal level of apoptotic, necrotic and viable cells of each cell type. 2.6.4 Evaluation of cell cycle As above, cells were exposed for 24 h to PVA microparticles (0.4 mg mL−1), collected in PBS, fixed in 70 % ice-cold ethanol and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. Then, DNA was stained by adding a solution of 50 μg mL−1 propidium iodide and 100 μg mL−1 RNase A in PBS, following an incubation of 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Next, DNA content was analyzed in a FACSARRAY BD equipment (Cell Separation and Cytometry Unit, CIBA, IIS Aragon, Spain). Cell cycle distribution was determined using the software MODIFIT 3.0 Verity. Negative controls were also run to compare the basal level of cell cycle to that obtained after microparticles treatment."
8,Results and discussion,
9,The effect of variables studied on particle size distribution and morphology,"3.1 The effect of variables studied on particle size distribution and morphology In this section it was studied the main constraints in the production of hydrogel polymeric microparticles with a controlled morphology and homogenous particle size distribution: 1) the type of emulsification method, 2) polymer concentration, 3) cross-linking reaction (glutaraldehyde to PVA molar ratio), and 4) acidic cross-linking conditions. 3.1.1 Emulsification method In order to identify the proper emulsification technique available to fulfill aforementioned requirements, PVA microparticles were produced by both membrane emulsification and high-shear homogenizing techniques (Figs. 2 and 3 ). The membrane emulsification method promoted a fine control of the particle size, and resulted in a narrow particle size distribution (D(3,2) = 2.12 μm, span = 0.4). A span of distribution of 1 was obtained by using the homogenizer device while uniform particle size distribution (span close to 0.4) was obtained in the case of membrane emulsification process. The wide particle size distribution achieved by the homogenization approach resulted in a mean particle size of 8.16 ± 0.41 μm, a value larger than the size achieved by membrane emulsification. In conventional homogenization devices, emulsions are produced by repeated droplets disruption and smaller droplets are usually obtained applying high specific energy inputs [17] that are not spatially uniform. This emulsification method results to be unable to produce droplets with a precisely controlled morphology and narrow size distribution (Fig. 3-A). On the contrary, in membrane emulsification, droplets are generated by a drop-by-drop mechanism and a linear correlation exists between the droplet size and the membrane pore size [16,17], so that the formation of droplets at the membrane/continuous phase interface results in uniform particle size that can be well controlled over a wide range of sizes that are highly dependent on the membrane pore size (Fig. 3-B). 3.1.2 Polymer concentration The effect of polymer concentration (1, 3.5, 7 and 15 wt. %) on PVA particles preparation by membrane emulsification was studied (Figs. 1 and 2). SEM images show that PVA amount affected the structure of the microparticles. In particular, when PVA concentration was 1 % (Fig. 3-E), only few microspheres maintained the spherical shape while, in general, the PVA polymer solidified in the form of irregularly shaped aggregates. Phase separation occurred during the cross-linking reaction and the formation of a precipitated polymer was observed at the bottom of the container. From these results it can be inferred that an optimal PVA concentration is needed to promote a controlled formation of PVA microparticles since the smallest concentration (1 % wt) was not suitable for the preparation of microparticles because of the instability of the W/O emulsion (Fig. 3-E). The increase of PVA concentration in the dispersed phase from 3.5–15% resulted in the production of microparticles with a well-defined spherical shape (Fig. 3-B-D). It should be noted that PVA concentration lower than 15 % has never been reported for microparticles preparation, although the reduction of the amount of inert carrier coupled with a high drug loading are two main challenges for the development of polymer pharmaceutical systems. 3.1.3 Cross-linking reaction The effect of the amount of the cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde (GA) on particle size and particle size distribution has been investigated. This amount was dependent upon the desirable GA-PVA ratio (GA:PVA) defined as the mass of cross-linking agent per mass of polymer. Glutaraldehyde was used as a cross-linking agent because it favors the intermolecular reaction with PVA, where the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the PVA microspheres are then converted into aldehyde groups. Fig. 2 shows the resulting particle size and span of PVA microparticles as a function of GA:PVA ratio in the range from 0.05 to 4. Results demonstrated a small decrease of particle size and span when GA:PVA was increased from 0.05 to 0.1 while SEM images reveal that PVA microparticles produced in these conditions were not consistent in morphology (Fig. 3. F, G). An average diameter and a span of distribution equal to 2.48 μm and 0.50 were obtained in the GA:PVA range from 0.2–4, respectively. SEM pictures reveal that PVA microparticles were consistent in morphology, and exhibited excellent size uniformity (Fig. 3H–L). The effect of cross-linking agent amount on particles morphology has not been reported in previous work in which PVA microparticles have been obtained after cross-linking reaction [12–14]. Morelli et al. only reported that the lowest glutaraldehyde concentration needed for particles solidification was 1 % v/v of glutaraldehyde. The cross-linking of PVA using glutaraldehyde is an acidic catalyzed reaction [14] and, in this work, it was carried out with and without benzoyl chloride The acid catalyst (HCI) was generated after the addition of benzoyl chloride (electron pair acceptor) when it comes in contact with water (electron pair donor) at oil/water interface according to the nucleophilic addition-elimination. The addition of the benzoyl chloride was found necessary to adequately perform the cross-linking reaction and improve the mechanical resistance of the particles. PVA microparticles obtained in the absence of benzoyl chloride did not completely maintain the spherical shape (Fig. 3) and the formation of a solid polymer film with a continuous structure was observed after lyophilization. Based on our findings and taking into the account the aim to reduce the amount of glutaraldehyde, only the results of microparticles with GA:PVA range from 0.2 to 2 will be hereafter discussed."
10,The effect of variables studied on encapsulation efficiency and drug loading,"3.2 The effect of variables studied on encapsulation efficiency and drug loading In this section the effect of emulsification method, phases composition (PVA concentration, drug concentration), cross-linking reaction (glutaraldehyde to PVA ratio and acidic cross-linking conditions) on encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of catechol and diclofenac sodium are discussed. In particular, encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were studied for particles produced with PVA concentration (higher than 1 wt. %) and in the conditions of cross-linking reaction that allow to produce well defined, stable and spherical particles (GA:PVA of 0.2 and 2) according to the results obtained in the previous section. 3.2.1 Emulsification method In the present work, the encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of catechol and diclofenac sodium obtained by both membrane emulsification and homogenization method is compared in Table 1 using an identical concentration either of catechol or diclofenac sodium, as reported in the experimental section. Membrane emulsification process, compared to homogenization method, endows PVA hydrogel microparticles with a higher encapsulation efficiency of diclofenac sodium while same encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were obtained for catechol. These results are strictly correlated with the affinity of the drugs with PVA matrix. Indeed, although the factors affecting the drug encapsulation efficiency in the final formulation are various, the affinity between the encapsulated drug and the emulsified phases exert a major influence [16]. To demonstrate this behavior the solubility of catechol and diclofenac sodium into the external phase after emulsification and the partition coefficient between isooctane and PVA (LogPIsooctane/PVA) have been calculated and reported in Table 2 together with the partition coefficient between 1-octanol and water (LogPOctanol/Water) obtained from literature [28,29]. The higher solubility (2.70 ± 0.03 g L−1) in the continuous organic phase and LogPOctanol/Water of catechol (0.95) [28] with respect to diclofenac sodium (solubility = 1.73 ± 0.04 g L−1 and LogPOctanol/Water = 0.7 [29]) indicate that catechol is more hydrophobic than diclofenac sodium. Conversely, the lower LogPIsooctane/PVA of catechol (-3.1) with respect to diclofenac sodium (-1.6) indicates a high affinity of catechol toward the PVA solution (considering also that catechol can form hydrogen bond with PVA) that explain the higher encapsulation efficiency of catechol with respect to diclofenac sodium whatever was the encapsulation method used. However, when membrane emulsification was used, higher encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of diclofenac sodium was obtained with respect to the homogenization approach. The diffusion into the external phase of the diclofenac sodium may be influenced by individually formation of each droplet through the membrane pore, at low imposed shear and pressure, as well as by the uniform interfacial area of the generated droplets. This effect was irrelevant in case of catechol because of catechol-PVA interaction (see also Section 3.2.2). Consequently, the results obtained in this section indicate that the emulsification method not only influences the monodispersity of resulting emulsions based on hydrogel materials, but also the encapsulation efficiency of single emulsion due to the interactions between the drug and the polymeric matrix. 3.2.2 Phases compositions The increase in polymer concentration generally allows an increase in encapsulation efficiency. However, in the present work it was found that increasing the concentration of PVA does not affect the effectiveness of catechol encapsulation (Table 1) achieving an encapsulation efficiency of 90 % whatever PVA concentration was used while the drug loading was increased as the polymer concentration decreased. The effect of drug concentration on encapsulation efficiency has been also evaluated for both catechol and diclofenac sodium (Fig. 4 ). For catechol, encapsulation efficiency was constant irrespective of the drug concentration, while the encapsulation efficiency of diclofenac sodium slightly increased as drug content increased. The effect of drug concentration on the encapsulation efficiency of PVA microspheres has been previously studied only for Aspirin and the encapsulation efficiency has been demonstrated to increase at low drug concentration [13,14]. The results here reported could be related with the interactions between the polymer and the drugs as established by the FTIR analysis. In fact, the FTIR spectrum of catechol-loaded particles (Fig. 5 A) shows that there is almost no signal related to OH groups in the region of 3600−3000 cm−1 indicating a bonding interaction between PVA and catechol. The peak at 1684 cm−1 that is the most important peak in the spectrum could be assigned to CO groups that could be attributed to the unreacted glutaraldehyde confirming catechol competition with the cross-linker. On the other hand, in the spectrum of diclofenac sodium -loaded particles a slight reduction of OH groups signal was observed while the peak in the range of the ester groups appear at 1715 cm−1 shifted respect to catechol-loaded particles and with reduced intensity (Fig. 5B). This peak could be related to the carboxylic acid CO stretching and assigned to the acid form of diclofenac. The acidic form of the drug could be promoted by the addition of the benzoyl chloride during the cross-linking reaction. Results evidence that a covalent interaction is involved in the encapsulation of the studied drugs and that the fraction of encapsulated drug depends on the physico-chemical properties of drugs and polymer matrix. 3.2.3 Cross-linking reaction 3.2.3.1 The effect of cross-linking agent amount The effect of glutaraldehyde amount respect to PVA on encapsulation efficiency of catechol and diclofenac sodium has been evaluated (Table 1). As previously discussed, catechol and diclofenac sodium demonstrate a different drug loading behavior also with respect to the cross-linking reaction. The encapsulation efficiency of catechol was not influenced by the cross-linking reaction conditions and it was mainly controlled by the covalent interaction between the polymer and the drug (Fig. 5B). On the contrary, the encapsulation efficiency of diclofenac sodium further decreases after emulsification step and it increases as of the ratio GA:PVA is incremented. The encapsulation efficiency was higher at higher GA:PVA because diclofenac sodium solubility decreased when the toluene amount was increased (Table 2). 3.2.3.2 The effect of acid addition The use of benzoyl chloride as catalyst of the cross-linking reaction also influences the encapsulation efficiency of diclofenac sodium (Table 1). Previous works demonstrated an influence of drug properties (i.e. polarity) on the encapsulation efficiency of PVA microparticles as a function of cross-linking degree [13,14]. In particular, encapsulation efficiency increased when the cross-linking degree was increased for diltiazem HCl [14] encapsulation while it was not affected by the changes in the cross-linking density for aspirin [13]. The encapsulation efficiency of diclofenac sodium increased because the drug solubility in the external phase decreased when Benzoyl chloride was added as reported in Table 2. In addition, FTIR analysis suggested a low degree of cross-linking in absence of acid (Fig. 5B). One important effect of avoiding acid in the cross-linking reaction is the increase in the OH broadband in the region 3700−3000 cm−1 indicating the presence of large number of hydroxyl groups that would be related to uncross-linked PVA. In absence of benzoyl chloride, the FTIR spectrum shows peaks that are characteristic of PVA (1416 and 1075 cm−1)."
11,The effect of variables studied on PVA microparticles swelling,"3.3 The effect of variables studied on PVA microparticles swelling Releasing of drug from hydrogels depends strongly on their degree of swelling [30]. Based on this rationale, the swelling behavior of PVA microparticles containing different PVA amount (3.5 and 15 %) and GA:PVA (0.2 and 2) has been studied (Fig. 6 ). The swelling % was quite constant when the polymer concentration was varied in the range from 3.5–15% while decreased from 400 to 100 % when GA:PVA increased from 0.2 to 2. This tendency can be rationalized because a chemically cross-linked polymer is capable of increasing its volume several fold by absorbing large amounts of solvent. In particular when the polymer concentration was varied from 3.5–15% the relative amount GA:PVA was kept constant to 0.2 and the swollen polymer network was held together by molecular strands that are connected by the same chemical bonds (cross-links) giving the same swelling responses. On the contrary, the degree of cross-linking was strictly correlated with the swelling properties and the results indicate that the high cross-linking density of microparticles obtained with GA:PVA of 2 resulted in the absorption of less water as compared with those obtained with GA:PVA of 0.2. Results agree with previous works [13,14]."
12,The thermal properties of PVA microparticles,"3.4 The thermal properties of PVA microparticles DSC and TG analyses of PVA microparticles were performed to characterize their thermal properties. DSC and TG analyses of the PVA and PVA-GA are presented in Fig. 7 and were referred to the GA:PVA ratio of 0.2. As expected, DSC results indicated a complete loss of polymeric crystallinity due to GA cross-linking (Fig. 7 A). Indeed, the addition of GA to PVA solution increased the distance between the polymer chains avoiding PVA organization into crystal lattices [31]. On the other hand, the addition of drugs does not influence the loose of crystallinity. The TG analysis and DTG curve (Fig. 7 B and C) of neat PVA showed three main degradation steps: the ﬁrst one, around 100 °C, due to the water evaporation, which is present in the hydrophilic material. The second degradation step, at 286 °C, due to the elimination of acetic acid to form a polyene, whereas the last step, around 450 °C, due to the breakage of the main chains. TGA and DTG curves of GA-crosslinked PVA also showed three main degradation steps which occurred at higher temperatures, namely 325 and 480 °C, indicating an increase in the thermal stability compared to neat PVA. However, a different TGA and DTG profile was obtained when the drugs (CA or DS) are included in the PVA-GA matrix. In particular, the main degradation step (311 and 314 °C for catechol and diclofenac sodium, respectively) was higher than neat PVA (286 °C) and lower than GA-crosslinked PVA (325 °C). This different profile suggested that PVA was not exclusively linked to GA but appears that there a competition between the drugs and the glutaraldehyde during the crosslinking reaction. The formation of chemical bonds between the polymer and the drugs, as also confirmed by FTIR measurements, could also be correlated with the lower drug release (see also Section 3.4)."
13,The effect of variables studied on drug delivery,"3.5 The effect of variables studied on drug delivery The drug release of catechol was not influenced by the emulsification method (S2). Considering that particle structure was not influenced by the processing method, the only difference observed by using the two methods was the particle size and size distribution. However, the relative lower surface/volume ratio of larger and heterogeneous droplets produced by the homogenizer did not influence the drug release while smaller but uniform particles obtained by membrane emulsification gave the same catechol release profile (Fig. 8 ). This fact can be rationalized because both carriers exhibited an initial burst release due to a high degree of swelling. Although, no differences in the release profile of the former PVA microparticle was observed, membrane emulsification is presently one of the more attractive technologies in pharmaceutical industry as it is a more reproducible and higher-throughput manufacturing method of uniform-sized particles, comparing to the conventional mechanical stirring (i.e homogenization or ultrasonication method). The release of catechol was found to be strictly dependent on its interaction with PVA. Catechol release curves obtained with PVA 3.5 and 7 % follow the same trend and reach the plateau after 4 h with a catechol released amount of 47 %, while the microparticles of PVA 15 % reach, after the same release time, a catechol released amount of 60 % (Fig. 8). The not complete release further highlighted that catechol competes with glutaraldehyde during the cross-linking reaction to form covalent bond with PVA. Therefore, the amount of catechol released can be attributed to the amount of catechol solubilized in the polymer matrix and not covalently linked to him. As the polymer concentration increases also the amount of catechol solubilized in the polymeric matrix is expected to increase giving reason of the higher drug release at higher polymer concentration. The rate of release of catechol was found to be considerably influenced by the cross-linking density (GA:PVA of 0.2 and 2). Microspheres prepared by using low concentration of glutaraldehyde released 66 % of catechol in 4 h, while microspheres prepared by using high concentration of glutaraldehyde, released 30 % of catechol in 4 h. Such wide variation in the release rate demonstrates that tuned drug release may be achieved by changing the cross-linking density of the microspheres. More glutaraldehyde gave rise to a more cross-linked gel which retarded the diffusion of the drug into the release media. This agrees with the swelling % and less swelling gel was obtained when the cross-linking degree increased as a result of a less hydrophilicity of the microspheres, since most of the hydroxyl groups in the PVA are involved in the cross-linking reaction by acetal formation. The drug delivery as a function of drug concentration for catechol and diclofenac sodium has been studied (Fig. 9 ). As it was expected because of the different drug affinity of catechol and diclofenac sodium with PVA microparticles, a different behavior was observed. Catechol delivery was increased from 36 % to 70 % as the drug concentration was increased from 1 to 10 gL−1. On the other hand, diclofenac sodium delivery was practically negligible (< 1 %) and increased when the microparticles were prepared without benzoyl chloride. The very low release of diclofenac sodium could be attributed to its conversion from salt to the acid when the cross-linking reaction was carried out with the addition of benzoyl chloride since the acid form of diclofenac is highly water insoluble [32]. The physicochemical properties of the hydrogel microparticles will determine the drug release mechanism(s) by which the loaded drug is released. The mesh size of hydrogel polymer microparticles increases as the degree of swelling increases, affecting the drug diffusion and the theoretical prediction of the drug release mechanism. The hydrogel swelling is just a mechanism to control the release of molecules that are smaller than the gel mesh size. The catechol release was substantiated by fitting the cumulative fraction release, Mt/M∞, as a function of time to the empirical Ritger-Peppas equation that is widely used in the kinetics of hydrogel systems [33]: (9) M t M ∞ = k t n where Mt is the mass of drug released at time t, M∞ is the total mass of released drug, k is a kinetic constant, and n is the diffusional exponent. According to this equation, the mass fraction of drug released over time follows a power law relationship. The power n depends on various factors such as [34]: 1) type of molecular transport, 2) hydrogel geometry and mesh size and 3) polymer polydispersity. Catechol-PVA microparticles (PVA = 15 %; GA:PVA = 0.2) were selected as representative delivery systems, obtaining that the n-values was 0.85, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93. In the case of microspheres, n-values 0.43 < n < 0.85 show non-Fickian diffusion [33], where more than one mechanism controls the catechol release. In fact, the release mechanism can be controlled in parallel by diffusion, hydrogel swelling, reversible drug–polymer interactions, and degradation of labile covalent bonds [35], and the diffusion coefficient can vary over the time-scale of release."
14,Cytocompatibility studies,"3.6 Cytocompatibility studies Glutaraldehyde was used in this work as an efficient cross-linking agent. Despite glutaraldehyde is extensively used in medical products, it remains some concerns about its potential cytotoxicity [36,37]. Then, the cytotoxic properties of PVA microparticles chemically cross-linked with glutaraldehyde were analyzed against human dermal fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages and U251MG cells under the same conditions through the treatment of these cell lines with microparticles for 24 h. The effects in cell metabolism were assessed by the Alamar Blue assay while cell membrane damage and cell cycle changes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Regarding the influence of PVA microcapsules treatment in the cellular metabolism, the results obtained are depicted in Fig. 10 . In general, the exposure of these cell types to increased concentrations of microparticles until 0.4 mg mL−1 were found not cytotoxic showing viability percentages higher than 70 %. It should be noted that the lowest percentages were found in tumoral cells. Furthermore, viability data were higher than 70 % in all cases, which is considered not cytotoxic by the ISO standard 10993-5 (“Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 5: Tests for in vitro cytotoxicity”). These results agree with previous studies [38] in which PVA microparticles synthesized by spray drying were tested in human alveolar basal epithelium A549 cell cultures, showing cell viability percentages higher than 80 % after treatment for 24 h at concentrations up to 1 mg mL−1. The ability of PVA microparticles to induce apoptosis and necrosis was tested by flow cytometry in the four cell lines studied and at the higher concentration assayed (0.4 mg mL−1), as viability studies determined its non-cytotoxicity (Table 3 ). Fibroblasts showed a slight increase in apoptosis (< 20 %) compared to the control sample though viability remained in percentages higher than 80 %, while macrophages also displayed a slight increase in apoptosis (< 15 %) after treatment with PVA microparticles. Monocytes and U251MG did not exert changes in the parameters studies when treated with microparticles. The evaluation of the possible influence on cell cycle after microparticles treatment was developed by flow cytometry (Table 3). The distribution of cell cycle phases in the different cell types studied suggests that microparticles did not exert any effect in DNA, not showing changes after microparticles treatment. In conclusion, PVA microparticles did not damage significantly cell metabolism, cell membrane or cell cycle at the concentrations and cell lines tested, showing their suitability for potential biomedical applications."
15,Conclusions,"Uniform PVA microparticles were successfully developed by membrane emulsification and chemical cross-linking by using a polymer concentration and GA:PVA ratio higher than 1 % and 0.1, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency of catechol was close to 90 % whatever emulsification method, PVA and catechol concentration, as well as the GA:PVA ratio were used. The encapsulation efficiency of diclofenac sodium was higher when membrane emulsification was used as emulsification method with respect to the homogenizing approach, and it increased as a function of GA:PVA increase. Results indicated that the encapsulation of drugs in hydrogel materials is influenced by the interactions between the drug and the polymeric matrix. Catechol release was tuned by changing the polymer concentration and the cross-linking density of the microspheres while release of diclofenac sodium was negligible due to its conversion from salt to the acid (after the addition of benzoyl chloride). Catechol is released according to a non-Fickian diffusion mechanism, where several drug release mechanisms can occur over the time-scale of release. Cytocompatibility studies demonstrated that cell metabolism, cell membrane or cell cycle at the concentrations and cell lines tested were not significantly affected by the PVA microparticles, highlighting their suitability for potential biomedical applications. The proposed method permits to fabricate hydrophilic polymeric particles with desirable properties (in terms of size, size distribution, morphology/surface and encapsulation efficiency) for drugs encapsulation. From a practical point of view, the controlled drug release from PVA cross-linked matrices is strictly correlated with the physico-chemical properties of the drug. Progress on the physicochemical strategies to control the gelation process and on the design of micro-nanostructured devices would further expand the utility of hydrogels like PVA for both drug delivery and tissue engineering- based applications."
