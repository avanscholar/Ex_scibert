0,Introduction,"Past decades have witnessed an acceleration of environment pollution and fossil resource shortage (including petroleum, coal, natural gas, etc.), which motivate us to exploit clean and sustainable energy alternatives to alleviate above condition. Hydrogen (H2) has been proposed to replace traditional fossil fuels because of its high energy density and environmentally friendly features [1–3]. How to obtain H2 eco-friendly is the focus of current research. Among various approaches, semiconductor photocatalytic technology has been a promising route since 1972 [4], because it can convert solar energy to chemical energy using H2O as sustainable raw material and is widely applied in the field of hydrogen production, carbon dioxide reduction and degradation of organic pollutants [5,6]. TiO2 and g-C3N4 [7,8] are widely employed photocatalysts, however, the inferior light absorption ability, rapid recombination of the carriers, weak surface redox reaction driving forces severely limit their application for the lower H2 evolution efficiency [9–11]. Transition metal chalcogenides have been regarded as excellent candidates due to their unique electronic and optical features such as ZnS, CdS, ZnxCd1−xS (0 < x < 1), ZnSe, CdSe, etc. [12–15]. Se element has larger ionic radius and lower electronegativity compared with S element, those properties can attenuate attractive force of outer electrons from transition metals, leading to the improved redox reaction, therefore, transition metal chalcogenides are widely used in field of electrocatalysis. Photocatalysis is similar to electrocatalysis to some extent, transition metal selenides might be excellent candidates in photocatalytic H2 evolution [16–20]. Zinc Selenide (ZnSe) has been extensively employed for its suitable energy band positions (~2.7 eV) [21–25]. As a direct band gap semiconductor, it has relatively higher absorption ability of visible light. Nevertheless, the application of ZnSe in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction is severely restricted owing to the quick recombination of carriers. A multitude of strategies have been applied to conquer above shortcoming including element doping [26], metal loading [27,28], heterojunctions construction [29,30], and so on. Heterojunction structure has been proved to be one of the most promising approaches among the proposed strategies. Many heterojunction composites have been reported, such as ZnSe/MoSe2 type-I heterojunction [31], ZnSe/FeSe2 [32], ZnO/ZnSe/MoSe2 [33], ZnO/ZnSe [34], g-C3N4/ZnSe type-II heterojunctions [35], ZnSe/rGO [36] and ZnSe/WC schottky junction [37]. However, the oxidation and reduction abilities of electrons and holes of type-I, type-II, even schottky junctions become weaker compared with that of their original components. As we know, the strong redox ability can be well maintained through Z-scheme heterojunction, implying a higher H2 production kinetics. Xue group found that reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in the middle of Cd0.5Zn0.5S and g-C3N4 contributes to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction as charge transfer bridge, while the preparation processes for this ternary system are very complicated [38]. Zhang reported that a H2 evolution rate of 1530 μmol·g−1·h−1 can be achieved by Z-scheme ZnCo2O4/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, which is 10 times higher than that of g-C3N4 illuminated by UV and visible light [39]. Feng demonstrated that the H2 evolution rate of the CdS/Co9S8 Z-scheme heterojunction can reach 11.60 mmol·g−1·h−1, which is 13.6 and 55.2 fold of CdS and Co9S8, respectively [40]. Liu found N-doped K4Nb6O17/g-C3N4 heterojunction follows Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism, which exhibited excellent activity in both H2 evolution (~16.91 μmol/h) and Rhodamine B removal under visible light [41]. Xing constructed a direct Z-scheme heterojunction by depositing ZnIn2S4 nanosheets on HxMoO3 nanobelts, which also displayed superior H2 production activity (5.9 mmol·g−1·h−1) than pure ZnIn2S4 in the range of visible light [42]. Exploring more Z-scheme systems is focused because it can maintain the redox potential of charge carriers. Cadmium selenide (CdSe) has been widely investigated due to its outstanding response to visible-light and appropriate band gap (~1.7 eV) [43–48]. TiO2 nanotube sensitized by CdSe and ZnSe can form a type-II heterojunction, which displayed excellent photocurrent density (1.18 mA·cm−2) with a H2 production rate of 252 μmol·h−1·cm−2 [49]. Li reported that Z-scheme ZnSe/CdSe composite (precursor ratio Zn:Cd = 1:0.125) in the field of photocatalytic reduction of CO2, which exhibited much higher CO yield of 116.9 μmol·g−1, which is 33.4 times than that of pristine ZnSe (3.5 μmol·g−1) [50]. However, the combination of CdSe and ZnSe to construct a Z-scheme system for the photocatalytic H2 production has not been reported until now. Inspired by above investigations, CdSe and ZnSe were prepared separately using simple solvothermal method, subsequently, CdSe/ZnSe heterojunction was successfully obtained via a facile mechanical mixing strategy. As expected, 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe composite exhibits superior photocatalytic H2 production activity of 15.3 mmol·h−1·g−1 without any cocatalyst in Na2S/Na2SO3 solution, the AQE is approximately 4.0% under 400 (±5) nm light irradiation. The charge transfer route was discussed in detail based on active species trapping experiments and photochemical analyses. The excellent activity is attributed to the Z-scheme charge transfer route between CdSe and ZnSe, which restrain the charge recombination and maintain higher redox ability of electrons and holes."

3,Synthetise of ZnSe and CdSe,"2.2 Synthetise of ZnSe and CdSe ZnSe nanobelt was synthesized using the reported method with a minor modification [51–53]. First, 2.2 g of SeO2 and 1.6 g of NaOH were added into 20 mL of deionized water to form 1 M Na2SeO3 solution, Subsequently, 0.658 g of Zn(OAC)2.2H2O and 3 mL of 1 M Na2SeO3 solution were added and dissolved in a mixing solution including 13 mL of distilled water, 14 mL of DETA and 5 mL of N2H4·H2O. After stirring for 30 min, the transparent solution was transferred to a 100 mL sealed Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was then heated at 180 ℃ for 16 h. Finally, ZnSe nanobelt was obtained by washing the yellow precipitate 4 times with ethanol, followed by drying at 60 ℃ for 10 h.

Subsequently, the two suspensions were mixed and subjected to evaporation under successive stirring to obtain green powder."

6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology Initially, the ZnSe nanobelts and CdSe nanospheres were obtained via a simple one-step solvothermal method using DETA, hydrazine hydrate and water as reaction medium, afterwards, ZnSe and a certain amount of CdSe were mixed under ultrasonic treatment. Just as expected, CdSe microspheres were successfully loaded on ZnSe nanobelts, then closed heterostructures were obtained, which is affirmed by TEM characterization. ZnSe, 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe, and CdSe samples were examined by XRD to analyze phase purity and crystalline structures. As shown in Fig. 2a, the characteristic peaks related to cubic phase of ZnSe are observed at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.6°, 65.9°, 72.6°, 83.5°, respectively, which correspond to the (1 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 2) planes of ZnSe (JCPDS No. 37–1463) [54]. The peaks of CdSe are consistent with its hexagonal phase (JCPDS No. 08–0459) [55]. No impurity was detected in ZnSe and CdSe. Simultaneously, the characteristic peaks of ZnSe and CdSe can be both found in their hybrid, indicating the formation of the CdSe/ZnSe heterostructure. N2 absorption-desorption isotherm is used to analyze that how specific surface area of the catalysts affects the H2 generation performance. According to classification from Brunauer−Deming−Deming−Teller (BDDT), the isotherms of all samples belong to type IV due to its mesoporous hysteresis loops characteristic (Fig. 2b and S1). 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe (26.791 m2·g−1) has a slightly higher surface area compared with ZnSe (21.164 m2·g−1), which is attributed to the introduction of CdSe with higher surface area (96.382 m2·g−1). The increased specific surface area offers more reaction active sites. Among all composites with different content of CdSe, 5 wt% CdSe/ZnSe processes highest surface area (61.873 m2·g−1), which shows that the surface area has little effect on the photocatalytic H2 production ability. SEM and TEM measurements were conducted to investigate the morphology and structure of all samples. Pure ZnSe with 2D nanobelt morphology can be observed in Fig. 3a [56], which may create abundant superficial channels and large interfacial contacts between photocatalysts and reactant molecules. Pure CdSe with microspheric shape was obtained, which is made up of many nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). However, it is difficult to identify CdSe microsphere due to low content of CdSe in composites (Fig. 3c). From EDX elemental mapping images of 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe composites in Fig. 3d, Zn, Se and Cd elements are homogeneously distributed, which illustrate that CdSe have been successfully deposited on the ZnSe. The TEM images of 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe composite are showed in Fig. 4, clearly, the surface of ZnSe nanobelts is decorated by numerous CdSe microspheres with an intimate contact interface, which facilitates the migration of charge carriers. The lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.325 nm result from the (1 1 1) facets of ZnSe [27]. The characteristic lattice spacing of 0.352 nm is consistent with (1 1 1) crystal plane of CdSe, which is similar to previous research [43]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to deeply understand the chemical composition and surface chemical states of hybrids. As displayed in Fig. 5a, the survey spectra of 25 wt% CdSe/ZnSe samples are composed of Zn, Cd and Se elements. Due to low Cd content in 3 wt% composite, the peaks assigned to Cd 3d of CdSe cannot be obviously observed and accurately fitted in high resolution XPS spectra (Fig. S2). Therefore, the XPS spectra of 25% CdSe/ZnSe samples was tested and analyzed. High resolution XPS spectrum of Zn 2p is presented in Fig. 5b, two peaks at the binding energy of 1020.88 eV and 1043.78 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of Zn2+ from ZnSe, respectively [57,58]. The peaks assigned to Cd 3d of CdSe located at 404.7 and 411.5 eV, respectively (Fig. 5c) [59]. The peaks at 54.18 and 53.34 eV for ZnSe are attributed to Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2 of Se2− (Fig. 5d) [60]. The binding energy of Zn 2p for CdSe/ZnSe shifted to lower values in comparison with that for ZnSe after the hybridization of CdSe and ZnSe, the binding energies of Cd 3d for 25 wt% CdSe/ZnSe composite shifted to higher binding energy, which implies the intimate interactive force and the presence of electron transfer from CdSe to ZnSe."
8,Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance The photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of pure ZnSe, CdSe and the x wt% CdSe/ZnSe composites with various loading amounts were investigated using 0.35 M Na2S/0.25 M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight irradiation. There is no H2 evolution without photocatalyst, indicating that H2 results from photocatalytic reaction. ZnSe exhibits a relatively higher H2 evolution rate of 3.65 mmol·g−1·h−1 than that of CdSe (0.45 mmol·g−1·h−1), photocatalytic activity of ZnSe is severely limited by poor absorption ability of visible light and rapid recombination of the carriers, H2 evolution rate over ZnSe can only reach 3.65 mmol·g−1·h−1. CdSe processes outstanding response to visible light, but it achieves H2 generation rate of 0.45 mmol·g−1·h−1 due to less negative CB potentials and narrow band gap, resulting in a lower reactive driving force and rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively. The performance of the hybrids is improved significantly after adding a small amount of CdSe. Among all samples, the highest H2 evolution rate of 15.28 mmol·h−1·g−1 is achieved using 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe, which is 4.2 and 34.1 times higher than those of the pure ZnSe and CdSe. However, excessive loading of CdSe influences the activity negatively. For 1 wt% CdSe/ZnSe sample, the e− on the CB of CdSe can only consume a small part of h+ on the VB of ZnSe, remaining h+ of ZnSe still can recombine with e− of itself, therefore, the composite with lower content of CdSe exhibits relatively lower H2 evolution rate at 9.88 mmol·g−1·h−1. For 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe, the e− on the CB of CdSe can consume most of the h+ on the VB of ZnSe. Finally, the separated e− at the CB of ZnSe and the h+ left behind on the VB of CdSe can reduce H+ to produce H2 and oxidize the sacrificial agent (Na2S/Na2SO3). For 5 wt% and 10 wt% CdSe/ZnSe, the h+ on the VB of ZnSe are already filled with electrons from CdSe, more CdSe loading amounts not only do not enhance photocatalytic activities, but restrain H2 generation rate due to the shielding effect. The above results illustrate that the positive effect of CdSe/ZnSe heterojunction can accelerate the charge transfer, leading to an enhanced H2 evolution activity. The image of three successive cyclic experiments is illustrated in Fig. 6c, after three times of circulation, there is slightly decrease in amount of the water splitting to generate H2. Besides, the XRD analysis also show that the crystal structure are almost consistent with samples before use with small amount of impurities (Fig. 6d). SEM and XPS results demonstrate that the morphology and surface composition of samples before and after use are well maintained (Fig. S3 and S4)."
9,UV–vis DRS results,"3.3 UV–vis DRS results UV–vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy was measured to investigate the optical properties of the samples. As shown in Fig. 7a, pristine ZnSe exhibits a steep absorption edge at approximately 500 nm, corresponding to the band gap energy of 2.59 eV calculated by the Kubelka-Munk method (Fig. 7b), while CdSe shows a better absorption ability for ultraviolet and visible light with the absorption edge of approximately 750 nm. The 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe heterojunction displays almost consistent absorption edge with ZnSe after introduction of CdSe, but the light harvesting ability is obviously enhanced compared with ZnSe ranging from 200 to 700 nm. ZnSe and CdSe are both directly n-type semiconductor for the positive Mott-Schottky slopes displayed in Fig. 7c and d. According to the intersection between tangent and X-axis, the flat band potentials (Efb) of ZnSe and CdSe can be obtained at −1.47 and −0.49 eV vs. SCE, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the CB position of the n-type semiconductor is about 0.20 eV deeper than its flat band potential [61]. Therefore, the CB potentials of ZnSe and CdSe are −1.67 and −0.69 eV vs. SCE (−1.43 and −0.45 eV vs. NHE), separately. The VB positions of ZnSe and CdSe are equivalent to +1.16 and +1.31 eV based on the formula of Eg= EVB-ECB."
10,Photoelectrochemical performance,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical performance The photoelectrochemical test was conducted in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 7). Fig. 8a illustrates photocurrent responses of different samples under interval illumination. The sample of CdSe displayed excellent photocurrent response at about 12 μA·cm−2, the photocurrent density of 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe is approximately 2.49 μA·cm−2, which is 1.81 times that of ZnSe (1.37 μA·cm−2) and demonstrates that the introduction of CdSe can accelerate the charges separation and transfer of ZnSe [62]. Much smaller arc radius in EIS curve can be observed in CdSe/ZnSe composite compared with the bare ZnSe (Fig. 8b), indicating that the heterojunction structure can reduce electron transfer resistance, promoting separation and migration of charge carriers [63]. Moreover, From LSV curves (Fig. 8c), the CdSe/ZnSe composite possesses relatively lower overpotential at 0.4 V than pure ZnSe (0.43 V vs. Hg/HgCl2) when the photocurrent density is 6 μA·cm−2. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was applied to reveal the recombination efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. ZnSe, CdSe and CdSe/ZnSe composite with a wide emission located at around 475 nm under the excitation wavelength of 329 nm (Fig. 8d) [64]. The PL intensity of the CdSe/ZnSe sample is obviously reduced after the introduction of CdSe, suggesting a lower carrier recombination rate. Although CdSe presented the lowest the PL signals, indicating highest electron-hole separation efficiency, recombination of the holes and electrons of CdSe itself lead to consumption of electrons and less effective electrons involved in hydrogen production. However, although recombination rate of 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe is higher than CdSe, combine of the e − on the CB of CdSe and the h + on the VB of ZnSe contribute to the maintain of higher redox ability of electrons and holes and enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation. To probe the charges transfer principle and the influence of different active species on photocatalytic reaction, capture experiments of active free radicals were conducted. During methylene blue (MB) degradation reaction, triethanolamine (TEOA), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were selected as trapping agent to capture the holes (h +) and hydroxyl free radicals (·OH), while N2 was employed to avoid production of superoxide radical (·O2 −) (Fig. S1). As displayed in Fig. 9a, for pure ZnSe, the degradation performance is almost unchanged after introducing TEOA and IPA. However, it is clear that the removal ratio is remarkably decreased after introduction of N2, implying that·O2 − is the main reactive active species compared with·OH and h + for pure ZnSe. Similarly, from Fig. 9b, it is surveyed that the·O2 − also plays leading role in the degradation reaction for the CdSe/ZnSe hybrid (Fig. S2). In addition, nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) trapping experiments were carried out for gauging the existence of·O2 − radicals originating from reduction of electrons [65,66], because no absorption peak of reduction products of NBT (peak at 260 nm) and·O2 − is observed in UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra. As shown in Fig. 10 (a) and (b), the UV-Vis absorption intensity of NBT sharply decreases along with the irradiation time for both pure ZnSe and CdSe/ZnSe composite, indicating a large number of·O2 − have emerged. However, Fig. 10 (c) shows that negligible change of the absorption intensity is achieved for CdSe due to the smaller difference between CB position of CdSe (−0.45 V vs. NHE) and O2/·O2 − (−0.33 V vs. NHE) [67], leading to lower reactive driving force. Furthermore, the VB potential of ZnSe (1.16 V vs. NHE) and CdSe (1.31 V vs. NHE) is more negative than those of H2O/·OH (1.99 V vs. NHE) and OH−/·OH (2.34 V vs. NHE) [68,69]. Therefore, the generation of·OH results from two-electron reduction of O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Eθ = +0.70 V vs. NHE) instead of oxidation of VB, H2O2 is further decomposed into·OH. In general, photocatalytic reaction processes can be expressed as follows: Photocatalyst + hv→ e −+ h + O2 + e − →·O2 − O2 + 2e − + 2H+ → H2O2 H2O2 + e − + H+ → H2O +·OH The DPD-POD coloration method was applied to detect the formation of H2O2 during water splitting without Na2S/Na2SO3 solution as the hole sacrificial agent. As illustrated in Fig. 10(d), double characteristic absorption peaks at 500 nm and 550 nm of two samples can be observed, confirming that the two-electron reduction process of O2 has also been built to produce H2O2 which further reacts to produce ∙OH. On the basis of the above experiments and the corresponding CB and VB potential of ZnSe and CdSe, a possible charges transfer route in CdSe/ ZnSe heterojunction is proposed in Fig. 11. When ZnSe is combined with CdSe, built-in electric field is formed in contact area. Irradiated by sunlight, the electrons can be migrated from the VB to the CB of CdSe and ZnSe, respectively. Subsequently, recombination between the e − on the CB of CdSe and the h + on the VB of ZnSe occurs. Finally, the separated e − at the CB of ZnSe and the h + left behind on the VB of CdSe can reduce H+ to produce H2 and oxidize the sacrificial agent (Na2S/Na2SO3), separately. As a result, Z-scheme charges transfer pathway is formed. The most efficiently photocatalytic activity toward H2 evolution of CdSe/ZnSe Z-scheme heterojunction arises from several factors as follows: (i) enhanced light harvesting ability and abundant superficial active sites, (ii) efficient charges transfer and lower H2 evolution overpotential, and (iii) strong redox ability of the electrons and holes."
11,Conclusion,"ZnSe nanobelts and CdSe microspheres were prepared by a facile solvothermal method, then CdSe was deposited on the surface of ZnSe to form heterojunction using a facile mechanical mixing method. It was found that the ZnSe and CdSe can form Z-scheme heterojunction system, which can efficiently facilitate the charges transfer and maintain their higher redox ability. As a result, a higher H2 evolution rate of 15.3 mmol·h−1·g−1 was achieved over 3 wt% CdSe/ZnSe composite, which is 4.2 times and 34.1 times higher than those of ZnSe and CdSe with an apparent quantum yield of 4.0% at 400 (±5) nm, respectively. This work provides a simple and promising approach for synthesizing a highly efficient Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalytic system for H2 generation."
