0,Introduction,"Semiconductor-mediated photocatalytic processes have been widely investigated in recent years as potentially efficient, economic and environmentally friendly methods for hydrogen production. Since 1972, after the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda [1], who discovered that water can be photo-electrochemically decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen using a semiconductor (TiO2) electrode under UV irradiation, a large number of metal oxides has been reported to have photocatalytic activity for water splitting. Nowadays, research efforts have attempted mainly to extend the photosensitivity of semiconductor photocatalysts toward the visible light region in order to fully harvest solar energy, since it accounts for approximately 43% of the incoming solar energy spectrum against only about 3% of UV light. Several strategies for the development of visible-light-driven photocatalysts have been tested, such as dye sensitization, band gap modification by nonmetals doping and transition metal doping and co-doping [2,3]. Dye sensitization has been demonstrated as a useful tool to induce visible light photocatalysis on the surface of wide band gap semiconductors. The conceptual mechanism [4] of photocatalytic hydrogen production over dye-sensitized metal oxide semiconductor is based on light excitation of the dye sensitizer molecule (S) followed by electron injection into the conduction band of metal oxide, leading to the oxidized form of the dye (S+). The excited electrons in conduction band migrate to the metal attached on semiconductor where water is reduced to achieve hydrogen. At the same time, the original form of the dye is regenerate by a sacrificial electron donor. It is known that the positions of the valence band and conduction band are critical variable in determining the feasibility of semiconductor for hydrogen production. In the last decades a lot of attention was devoted to study bismuth niobates and tantalates. These materials are envisaged as interesting photocatalysts for eliminating organic pollutants from domestic or industrial effluents [5], as well as for producing H2 by the photocatalytic decomposition of water under UV light irradiation [6]. Recently, we prepared nano-sized triclinic BiTaO4 (known as type β polymorph, stable at high temperatures) by polymeric precursor method with BET surface area of 3.31m2 g−1 [7,8]. It is seven times much higher than surface area of BiTaO4 obtained from solid state reaction. The band gap have also been estimated to be 2.65 and 2.45eV using photoacoustic spectroscopic (PAS) method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, respectively, as well as the positions of reduction and oxidation levels with respect to vacuum level were identified. Results showed that the energy level for water reduction (H+/H2) exist 0.5eV lower than the conduction band (CB), thus leading to inject electrons into the solution phase for hydrogen production. Oxidation level (O2/H2O) exists about 0.7eV higher the valence band (VB), so the holes can spontaneously transfer to the oxidizing potential of the water splitting with oxidation power 0.7eV, which confirms that BiTaO4 can be a good photocatalyst for hydrogen production. However, despite the narrow band gap energy (Eg<3eV) and the suitable VB and CB position, no photocatalytic activity is observed above 400nm, probably due to the too low absorption intensity of β-BiTaO4 in the visible region. In this work we submitted BiTaO4 to a photosensitization process to extend its photoresponse into a visible region and the photocatalytic activity was evaluated for each sensitized material under visible light irradiation. In order to accomplish the photosensitization, several cationic, anionic and neutral organic dyes, such as methylene blue, methyl orange, alizarine and eriochrome black T (Fig. 1 ), have been employed as photosensitizers. Before sensitization, it was performed a previous study about hydrolysis reactions on the BiTaO4 surface suspended in water in order to identify the optimum pH to promote the complete adsorption of dye on the BiTaO4 surface. Metal oxide particles suspensions behave as if they were simple diprotic acids. In general, hydroxyl groups on the metal oxide surface are involved in the follow acid–base equilibrium: (1) MOH2 + = MOH+H+, Ka1 (2) MOH= MO− +H+, Ka2 The pH of zero point of charge (pHZPC) is given by one half of the sum of the two surface pK as [9]. At high pH, under conditions in which the pH>pHZPC, the metal oxide surface become negative (MO−) and the interactions with cationic dye will be favored, while anionic dye will be favored at low pH under conditions in which pH<pHZPC, where the surface is positively charged (MOH2 +)."
1,Experimental,
2,BiTaO4 preparation,"2.1 BiTaO4 preparation BiTaO4 was prepared by the citrate method according to reference [7]. In a typical synthesis, bismuth citrate and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) are used as starting materials and citric acid and ethylene glycol as chelating agent and reaction medium, respectively. All reagents used in the entire procedure were of analytical grade."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The powder obtained was characterized by X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu XRD6000), using CuKα, Ni-filtered radiation, and scanning rate of 2° 2θ min−1, in a 2θ range of 5–80°, at 35kV and 15mA. The average crystalline sizes were calculated from the X-ray line broadening at 2θ =32.06° using the Debye–Scherrer equation [7,10]. The PAS experiments were performed using a spectrometer consisting of a 1000W xenon arc lamp whose beam was modulated by a mechanical chopper (SRS, model SR540). This technique is able to give the absorption spectrum of a given sample directly."
4,Point of zero charge,"2.3 Point of zero charge The point of zero charge of BiTaO4 was determined by the solid addition method according to the procedure described by Vieira et al. [11]. To a series of 50mL of cylindrical flasks were transferred 10mL of solution with pH varying of 1–12 and the initial pH values of each solution was adjusted by adding either 1.0molL−1 of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The initial pH (pHo) of the solutions were then accurately measured and 0.040g of BiTaO4 was added to each flask, which was securely sealed immediately. The suspensions were then manually shaken, allowed to equilibrate for 24h with intermittent manual shaking and the pH values of the supernatant were measured (pHf). The difference between the initial and final pH value, ΔpH=pHo −pHf, was plotted against pHo and the point of intersection of the resulting null ΔpH corresponds to the point zero charge, pHPZC."
5,Dye absorption,"2.4 Dye absorption 0.8g of material was added to 40mL of the organic dye with concentration of 10−4 molL−1 in appropriate pH. The mixture remained under agitation for 24h then centrifuged 4 times with deionized water, once with ethanol and dried at room temperature."
6,Photocatalytic reactions,"2.5 Photocatalytic reactions A high-pressure 500W Hg–Xe arc lamp was used as the light source for the photocatalytic reactions. The collimated light beam was passed through an IR filter, a focusing lens and a 418nm cutoff filter before reaching the photocatalytic cell, which was air cooled to maintain a constant temperature. Before each experiment, the photocatalytic cell was purged with argon for 30min to eliminate O2. Hydrogen gas evolution was measured by gas chromatography SHIMADZU (GC2014) with thermal conductivity detection (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) with methanator. Because He and H2 have similar conductivity values, argon was used as a carrier gas. In a typical photolysis experiment, 60mg of a target sensitized BiTaO4 was dispersed in an aqueous solution (total volume=60mL) containing 30% isopropanol and 40μL of 8% H2PtCl6 (∼0.3wt.% Pt), with pH adjusted to the adsorption pH by the addition of 1.5mL of buffer solution (fenate, pH 9.3, for cationic dyes and acetate, pH 4, for anionic and neutral dyes). Metallic platinum was deposited in situ on the photocatalyst surface by the photodecomposition of PtCl6 2−. The photocatalytic cell was equipped with argon gas inlet/outlet tubes, which serve to collect and transfer gaseous products to the analytical system."
7,Results and discussion,"Pure triclinic phase of BiTaO4, known as high-temperature β-type is obtained and confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) by comparison with the pattern (PDF 16-0906). The crystallite size of β-BiTaO4 was estimated in 47nm by Scherrer's equation from XRD data. The pH of zero point of charge, pHzpc, was determined by solid addition method to be 7 (Fig. 2 ). In very simple terms, a pHzpc of 7 for BiTaO4 implies that interactions with cationic dye will be favored for adsorption at high pH (pH>pHzpc), while anionic dye will be favored at low pH (pH<pHzpc). In Fig. 2 one can see a minimum in the curve at pH 4, which represents an increase in solution pH after metal oxide contact, indicating the surface protonation and maximum positive charge. Under this condition, the anionic dyes were adsorbed. On the other hand, the maximum in the curve at pH 9.3 indicates a decrease in solution pH, as a consequence of the surface deprotonation, yielding a maximum negative charge on metal oxide surface. Under this condition cationic dyes are adsorbed on β-BiTaO4 surface. UV–vis photoacoustic spectra of pure and photosensitized β-BiTaO4 in Fig. 3 show clearly the absorption band of the dyes in each case. In the case of alizarine, neutral dye, the adsorption was tested in both pH 4 and 9.3. Alizarine deprotonation takes place in pH 11–13, yielding an anionic dye. Meanwhile, the optimum pH to adsorb anionic dye is pH 4, where the metal oxide surface is positively charged. Photoacoustic spectra reveal that dye adsorption takes place at pH 4, which means a better interaction between alizarine and positive surface, indicating that alizarine behaves as an anionic dye, probably due to the high electronic density of the oxygen atom in the p-quinone group. The hydrogen production rate, as well CO and CO2 evolution, was measured from an aqueous solution containing isopropanol (30%) as sacrificial reagent under visible light irradiation (λ ≥418nm) for each target photocatalyst. The results demonstrate that only β-BiTaO4–methylene blue presented photocatalytic activity with respect to hydrogen production. Fig. 4 shows the profile of hydrogen, CO and CO2 evolution as a function of time for β-BiTaO4–methylene blue photocatalyst. The kinetic curve display an apparent induction period of 4h before the evolution of hydrogen started, but an immediate production of CO and CO2 is observed. The induction period for hydrogen production could be associated with either PtIV photo-reduction to Pt0, which plays role as a co-catalyst for hydrogen reduction, as CO adsorption on Pt. A mechanism proposed for photocatalytic alcohols reforming reaction on Pd/TiO2 [12,13] and Pt/CdS, Pt/TiO2/CdS and Pt/CdS/TiO2 [14] based on alcohol decomposition to gas phase hydrogen, an organic moiety and adsorbed CO on the metal as the initiation of the process. According to this proposition, the reaction stops after very little hydrogen has evolved due to blockage of the surface with CO, even at ultralow concentrations, which is strongly held and has a self-poisoning. This proposition must be considered here since it was observed CO evolution in the beginning of the irradiation, followed by decrease until CO concentration remain constant, while CO2 concentration increases in this period. It is evidence that CO was continuously removed as CO2 by an active oxygen species, leaving a vacant site on the metal. After virtually suppression of CO evolution, we observed a hydrogen production. The CO evolution was also observed by Zou and Arakawa [6] from CH3OH/H2O solution with pure BiTaO4 under UV irradiation as the oxidation product, but in this case, the CO evolution increases with illumination time as does hydrogen evolution. Nevertheless, the rate of CO evolution is much lower than that of H2 evolution. Our results are still lower than those obtained by Zou and Arakawa [6] from pure BiTaO4 irradiated with UV light but open up prospects for improving systems that are able to drive photocatalytic reaction with visible light illumination to make effective use of solar light (∼45% of visible light) to produce hydrogen from water."
8,Conclusions,"The hydrolysis reactions on the β-BiTaO4 surface suspended in water result in charged surface particles, it makes easier the dyes adsorption. The employed adsorption method demonstrated to be efficient, with complete adsorption of dye on the β-BiTaO4 surface under the optimum pH conditions. β-BiTaO4–methylene blue presented photocatalytic activity with respect to hydrogen production, but an apparent induction period of 4h before the evolution of hydrogen was observed, mainly due to blockage of the surface with CO. However, CO was continuously removed as CO2, leaving a vacant site on the metal co-catalyst to produce hydrogen."
