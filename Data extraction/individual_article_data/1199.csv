0,Lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable resource,"Biomass has become the largest source of renewable energy in the European Union, and goals were set to generate 27% of energy from renewable sources by 2030, mainly from lignocellulosic biomass [1]. Because lignocellulosic biomass does not compete with food sources and is widely available as a low-cost feedstock, it has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to replace fossil raw materials for the production of chemicals and fuels [2,3]. One of the most interesting routes for biomass use is its direct conversion into valuable compounds. Hydrolytic hydrogenation is a very attractive process because it converts biomass into polyols in a one-pot process using only water as a solvent in the presence of hydrogen [4–6]. Polyols, such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, glycerol, ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG), are important intermediates in chemical industry and pharmaceuticals and also considered as a new generation of the green energy platform chemicals [7]. In particular, sorbitol, xylitol, and EG are three of the most interesting products that can be obtained from biomass, each one presenting a tremendous growing market size and value (Fig. 1 ) [8]. Sorbitol and xylitol are both on the TOP-12 of high added-value products that can be obtained from biomass [9–11]. Sorbitol can be used as sweetener, dispersing agent, and humectant in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and textiles industries, as well as a platform chemical for the synthesis of engineering plastics such as Durabio and chemical compounds such as isosorbide, sorbitan, glycerol, and vitamin C [12,13]. Xylitol can be used as sweetener and starting material for vitamin C synthesis [4], and also in the pharmaceutical industry due to its low caloric value (with a 1.2 times higher sweeting capacity than sucrose and lower insulin requirements, working as a substitute for diabetics), as well as for treating osteoporosis and preventing tooth decay and ear infections [10,14,15]. Moreover, EG is a valuable product due to its important role in the synthesis of valuable chemicals that have a large market, such as polymers, also being widely used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food, dye, and automobile industries [12,16–18]. Usually, the process from biomass to polyols is hydrolysis coupled with hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis [19–22]. In the last years, hydrolysis and hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis have been combined in one-pot using both acid functionality (to transform cellulose and hemicelluloses into the respective monomers), as well as metal sites (to convert the monomers into polyols) (Fig. 2 ) [17,23]. This one-pot reaction helps in decreasing reaction time, reducing the waste formed, and reducing consumption of raw materials, energy, and solvents [24]. Enzymes and mineral acids have been widely used for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass and its components but have serious drawbacks involving low activity, difficult separation of products and catalysts, waste and corrosion hazards, and harsh conditions. Heterogeneous catalysis brings advantages that overcome these weaknesses, and their use in biomass conversion is very attractive because they are readily removed from reaction mixtures and thus can be reused, which allows to save energy and reduce waste [25–27]. Carbon materials, such as activated carbon (AC) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are known as heat- and water-tolerant supports, with high resistance to acid and base attack and excellent stability [28,29]; for this reason, carbon-supported metal catalysts have been extensively studied [30–32]. ACs have been widely used to stabilize Ru particles due to their low cost [33], whereas CNTs gained some attention as promising support material for heterogeneous catalysis [19,34]. However, the studies must not only focus on the support material and its modification to enhance the hydrolysis but also on the metal sites because they are fundamental for the definition of the conversion route [24]. Ru has shown to be a good catalyst for hydrogenation and has been receiving considerable attention from the researchers [22,33,35–38] because it has high activity and is relatively less expensive compared with other noble metals (Pt, Au) [19,34,39]. On the other hand, when the direct hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose or hemicelluloses is performed over tungsten-based catalysts, 1,2-alkanediols (EG and PG) will be the main products instead of hexitols, showing that the catalyst has the key role in the selectivity [40]. In this review, based on our own results and research from other groups, we present recent advances in the one-pot catalytic conversion of biomass and its components into sorbitol, xylitol, and EG, focusing on the use of carbon materials as catalysts supports."
1,Hydrolytic hydrogenation using carbon-supported metal catalysts,
2,Catalytic conversion of cellulose,"2.1 Catalytic conversion of cellulose First investigations involved the use of mineral acids in combination with hydrogenation catalysts to proceed the hydrolytic hydrogenation process [41]. In 2006, Fukuoka and Dhepe used for the first time only solid-supported noble metal catalysts at 190 °C and 50 bar of H2, obtaining sorbitol and mannitol with yields of 25 and 6%, respectively, over Pt/γ-Al2O3 [21]. Since then, several carbon-supported monometallic (Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt)-based catalysts were tested in the one-pot conversion of cellulose to C6 alcohols, as well as bifunctional catalysts, such as Ru/CNT, reshaped Ni on carbon nanofibers (CNF) and Pt on carbon black (BP2000). In 2007, Luo et al. [22] obtained sorbitol and mannitol yields of 30 and 10%, respectively, over 4%Ru/AC at 245 °C (Table 1 , entry 1) and, two years later, Deng et al. [19] attained a 69% yield of sorbitol, which was the highest value till date, over a Ru catalyst supported on CNT after the cellulose has been pre-treated with phosphoric acid (Table 1, entry 2). Besides, this group also examined cellulose conversion using CNT-supported Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Ag, and Au catalysts [19]. Afterward, Ignatyev et al. [42] outperformed the previous results by completely converting cellulose into sorbitol and glucose with yields of 74 and 26%, respectively, over HRuCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Rh/C at 150 °C. Furthermore, Kobayashi et al. investigated several metal catalysts on carbon supports [35]. The BP2000 (carbon black) support was shown to be superior to both other carbon supports (AC and carbon black Vulcan XC72) and Al2O3, ZrO2 and TiO2, affording 58% yields of sugar alcohols (Table 1, entry 3). More recently, Han’s research group developed bifunctional catalysts by Ru impregnation on AC previously treated with sulfuric acid, which promoted the straightforward conversion of cellulose with high sorbitol yields (59 and 51% over Ru/AC-SO3H and Pt/AC-SO3H, respectively) at 165 °C (Table 1, entry 4) [33]. Palkovits et al. performed the conversion of microcrystalline cellulose at only 160 °C and 50 bar of H2 for 1 h, obtaining a yield of sorbitol of 33% over Ru/AC combined with H2SO4 (Table 1, entry 5) [43]. More recently, our group performed an initial study for cellulose pre-treatment, where ball-milling was presented as an effective and green technique [44]. In this work, we studied the influence of different metal phases (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir) and reaction conditions, as well as tested several materials as catalytic supports (e.g. AC, CNT, graphene, graphite, carbon black, carbon xerogel, and so on). Accordingly, various microporous material–supported and mesoporous material–supported Ru catalysts were applied on the hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose, most of them showing an efficient conversion (>75%) within 5 h [45]. The most efficient catalyst was Ru/CNT that allowed attaining a 51% sorbitol yield in just 5 h (Table 1, entry 6). Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of the surface chemical properties by modification of the carbon supports, and despite enhancing the rate of hydrolysis of cellulose, the oxidative treatment lowered the selectivity to sorbitol directly from cellulose [46]. Moreover, our group synthesized glucose-based carbons and glucose/CNT hybrids to be used as supports for the preparation of Ru catalysts for sorbitol production from cellulose [47]. The total conversion of cellulose (100%) and the highest sorbitol yield (64%) was achieved over a hybrid catalyst with a high specific surface area of 1200 m2/g within 3 h, at 205 °C and 50 bar of H2 (Table 1, entry 7). These results were better than those previously reported over Ru/CNT (the highest yield reported to date over carbon supports) under the same reaction conditions, indicating that CNT could be successfully replaced by a low-cost support derived from biomass. Mix-milling cellulose and solid acids was an innovative approach that enhanced their interaction and resulted in rapid cellulose depolymerization [48,49]. As an example, mix-milling cellulose with amorphous zirconium phosphate combined with 5% Ru/C resulted in hexitols yield of 86% [50]. Furthermore, Fukuoka’ et al. [51,52] obtained a high cellulose conversion (89%) and yield of sugar alcohols (58% sorbitol and 9% mannitol) by mix-milling cellulose with a 2% Ru/AC catalyst (Table 1, entry 8). Our group also developed an AC-supported Ru catalyst that allowed obtaining a 90% ball-milled cellulose conversion with 45% sorbitol yield after 5 h. Moreover, the yield could be further enhanced to an outstanding 68% after just 1 h by mix-milling the catalyst with cellulose (Table 1, entry 9), which allowed obtaining one of the best results to date for cellulose conversion to sorbitol by a green process [53]. Similar results were then attained over a CNT-supported Ru catalyst (Fig. 3 ) [45]. All the aforementioned catalytic reactions require expensive H2, with pressures higher than 20 bar, which comes as a clear disadvantage [54]. Accordingly, Kobayashi et al. [37] investigated the hydrogenation of cellulose using an alcohol (2-propanol) as an alternative to H2, finding that sugar alcohols are obtained as major products using carbon-supported Ru catalysts. The highest yields of sugar alcohols (36% sorbitol and 11% mannitol) at a 85% cellulose conversion were obtained using a Ru/AC catalyst (Table 1, entry 10). In addition, this group found that the same catalyst could achieve similar yields of sugar alcohols (30% sorbitol and 8% mannitol) from cellulose using a hydrogen pressure as low as 8 bar instead of the alcohol (Table 1, entry 10). Despite showing promising results, the use of noble metals on catalytic design inhibits their application in large-scale processes for the hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose. Accordingly, to reduce cost, Ni catalysts have also been studied in replacement of precious metals [55]. However, the main disadvantage of Ni-based catalysts relates to their sintering [40], as was the case of Ni2P/AC, regardless of displaying high activity for the hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose (Table 1, entries 11 and 12) [56,57]. Yet, this problem was solved by Kobayashi et al. by increasing the Ni content up to 70% supported on carbon black (Table 1, entry 13) [55]. Moreover, Van de Vyver et al. [58], attained a 50% sorbitol yield over Ni/CNF at 190 °C (Table 1, entry 14). To the best of our knowledge, bimetallic catalysts were firstly used by Pang et al. [59] on the one-pot synthesis of sugar alcohols directly from cellulose. This group studied Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on mesoporous carbon (MC), and also tested different metals, obtaining a complete cellulose conversion with sorbitol yields of 40, 48, 42, 52 and 48% over Pt-Ni/MC, Pd-Ni/MC, Ru-Ni/MC, Rh-Ni/MC and Ir-Ni/MC at 245 °C, respectively (Table 1, entry 15). Our group also tested Ru-Ni catalysts supported on CNTs and AC, and the presence of Ni improved the catalytic performance of the Ru catalyst both in terms of activity and selectivity to the product of interest [60]. Yields of sorbitol of 52 and 61% were reached after just 5 h when using Ru-Ni/AC and Ru-Ni/CNT, respectively, as catalysts at 205 °C (Table 1, entry 16). The results demonstrate the effect of combining two metals to obtain a very efficient catalyst because the addition of other metals to monometallic catalysts can modify the selectivity to the desired product and increase the catalyst stability in the presence of biomass-derived impurities and under more severe reaction conditions. In addition, mix-milling the catalyst together with the substrate allowed to obtain similar EG yields in just 1 h. Interestingly, tungsten-based catalysts can favor the conversion of cellulose into EG and PG instead of sorbitol [61–63]. In fact, tungstenic catalysts are inactive for hexitols formation [64]. Therefore, the role of W and of the second metal (Ni, Ru) would be the C–C cleavage and catalyzing the hydrogenation, respectively [65]. Accordingly, several groups have dedicated their research to the direct production of EG from cellulose [62,65–76]. EG production from biomass started in 1933 or earlier [77], and for many decades the yield of the target diol was lower than 40%. Ji et al. [62,73] reported for the first time an effective cellulose conversion to EG over a nickel-promoted W2C catalyst, achieving a 61% EG yield after 30 min at 245 °C and 60 bar of H2 (Table 1, entry 17). It was also shown that not only W2C but also W, WO3, or H2WO4 combined with Ni or noble metals (Ru, Pt) were effective for the direct production of EG [61,75,78] because tungsten species are highly active in promoting the selective C–C bond cleavage of glucose [66,79]. Since then, the yields of EG have been enhanced by the use of bimetallic catalysts [72,74,75], and the catalytic stabilities have been greatly improved using binary catalysts [79]. Tungsten-based Ru bimetallic catalysts were found to be highly active and selective for the direct conversion of cellulose to EG, resulting in yields of 62% over 5%Ru–25%W/AC after 30 min at 245 °C and 60 bar of H2 (Table 1, entry 18) [75]. In addition, Pang et al. [80] managed to obtain EG yields of 51 and 46% from microcrystalline and ball-milled cellulose, respectively, over a 2%Ni-30%W2C/AC catalyst after 2 h at 245 °C and 60 bar of H2. Later on, Wang and Zhang [28] reported the one-pot conversion of cellulose to EG with high yield (60%) over multifunctional tungsten-based catalysts. This direct process comprises three steps: (1) hydrolysis of cellulose to oligomers and glucose, (2) retro-aldol reaction of glucose to glycolaldehyde, and (3) hydrogenation of glycolaldehyde to EG [28,76,81–83]. Although many groups have been investigating the sustainable production of EG, until now, to the best of our knowledge, the highest EG yield (around 76%) obtained directly from cellulose was achieved over Ni-W/SBA-15 catalysts [75]. However, these catalysts cannot be reused due to the complete collapse of the mesoporous structure of SBA-15. Therefore, the use of carbon materials as supports is highly preferred due to their high resistance to acid and base attack and excellent stability under hydrothermal conditions [28]. Ni-WC supported on mesoporous and AC were used on the conversion of cellulose and yields of EG of 73–74% were attained (Table 1, entries 19 and 20) [72,84]. In addition, Zhao et al. [71] obtained an EG yield of 46% over a Ni-WP/AC catalyst (Table 1, entry 21). Moreover, Liu et al. [61] found that the performance of the WO3 promoted selective conversion of cellulose into EG and PG, on a Ru catalyst, strongly depends on the domain size of the WO3 crystallites and the type of support. Later, Liu et al. [68] obtained a 58% yield of EG from microcrystalline cellulose using a NiWB/CNT catalyst, after 2 h at 250 °C (Table 1, entry 22). In addition, Xu et al. [85] developed a series of CNT-supported Pd and Fe monometallic and bimetallic catalysts for cellulose conversion into polyols, including EG (yields around 8% after 2 h at 240 °C and 60 bar of H2). Our group also synthesized and tested Ru-W catalysts supported on AC and CNT for the one-pot conversion of cellulose into EG [76,86]. After appropriate optimization of reaction conditions and metal loadings, an EG yield of 40% was reached in just 3 h using Ru-W/CNT at 205 °C (Table 1, entry 23) [86]. Besides, EG yield could be further enhanced to more than 40% by modification of the CNTs surface chemical properties [76]. Moreover, we prepared Ru-W supported on glucose-based carbon and glucose/CNT hybrid catalysts for the direct production of EG from cellulose [87]. The synthesized materials showed to be sustainable and cheaper catalytic supports than CNT, allowing to obtain similar EG yields, around 34% after 5 h. Yet, the incorporation of acid groups during the carbon materials preparation resulted in enhanced EG yields with values close to 50% at 205 °C and 50 bar of H2 (Table 1, entry 24). In collaboration with the Guerrero-Ruiz’s group, we investigated the cooperative effect of heteropolyacids (HPA) and Ru nanoparticles supported on AC and on a high surface area graphite for the direct conversion of cellulose [88]. The binary HPA-catalyst based on tungsten showed the most distinguished performance in terms of EG selectivity, allowing us to obtain yields close to 30% after 5 h at 205 °C. More recently, Pang et al. [89] reported the one-pot conversion of cellulose into EG with an yield close to 60% after 2 h at 245 °C, over a binary catalyst of tungstic acid and Ru/AC (Table 1, entry 25). In general, the conversion of cellulose to PG involves more reaction steps in comparison with those for EG formation, which could be one of the reasons why the highest EG yield obtained to date is 76%, but the yield of PG is only 42% [70,75]. In addition, apart from tungsten, a significant progress was accomplished with nickel catalysts and Sun et al. [90] developed binary nickel-lanthanum(III) and nickel-cerium(III) catalysts. The group managed to achieve an overall yield of glycols of 53% (38% EG and 15% PG) directly from microcrystalline cellulose in just 2 h over 10%Ni/AC-La(OH)3 at 245 °C and 50 bar of H2 (Table 1, entry 26). Moreover, a higher EG yield of 58% was obtained over composite catalysts of Ni/AC and metallic Sn powders (Table 1, entry 27) [91]."
3,Catalytic conversion of hemicelluloses,"2.2 Catalytic conversion of hemicelluloses Hemicelluloses are typically polymers of C5 sugars (mainly xylose). Because of their branched structure and low degree of polymerization, hemicelluloses hydrolyze more rapidly than cellulose, and the products formed (pentoses) are more reactive than glucose [10]. Yet, historically, hydrolytic hydrogenation of hemicelluloses has been less studied than cellulose [13,15]. For the past few years, although a great variety of noble metals has been under study, Ru-based catalysts have received some greater attention [92–94] because they show much less or no deactivation, being found as an alternative to Ni-based catalysts in hydrogenation processes. Kobayashi et al. [95] used a carbon-supported Pt catalyst for the conversion of arabinoxylan at 160 °C and 50 bar of H2, obtaining xylitol and arabitol yields of 96% (based on xylan content) and 61% (based on arabinan content), respectively, after 24 h. Moreover, Dietrich et al. [96] combined a commercial 5%Ru/C catalyst with HPAs for the direct conversion of hemicellulose (xylan from beech wood) to xylitol. Among the acids tested, phosphotungstic acid allowed attaining a yield of xylitol of 70% after 3 h at 140 °C and 20 bar of H2. Furthermore, our group investigated the direct conversion of hemicellulose (xylan) into xylitol by performing an intensive study of the catalytic properties, where different metal phases and carbon supports were tested, as well as reaction conditions [97]. Xylan could be converted into xylitol with a yield close to 76% after 2 h over 0.4%Ru/CNT at 170 °C and 50 bar of H2, which was one of the highest yields ever reported for the direct conversion of xylan using an environmentally friendly method. More recently, our group also developed a novel and efficient system for converting hemicelluloses (xylan) into xylitol, by finding a synergetic effect between cellulose and xylan when converted simultaneously [98,99]. Remarkable yields of sorbitol and xylitol around 80% (76% xylitol and 74% sorbitol) were achieved after 6 h of reaction in the one-pot conversion of ball-milled cellulose and xylan under a two-step temperature program (2 h at 170 °C + 4 h at 205 °C), using Ru (0.4% loading) supported on CNTs [99]. This approach was new and presented one of the highest sorbitol and xylitol yields reported to date. Yi and Zhang [100] also settled a one-pot procedure for converting xylan to xylitol, achieving yields over 80% in 3 h over Ru/C, but using propan-2-ol as source of hydrogen, instead of the traditional use of H2 under high pressure. However, a small amount of H2SO4 was crucial to convert xylan to xylitol, since without acidic additives the xylitol yield was only 6%. Later, Dietrich et al. [96] used isopropyl alcohol as hydrogen source and were able to reach an 82% yield of xylitol from beech wood xylan over phosphotungstic acid combined with 5% Ru/C, after 3 h at 140 °C and 20 bar of H2."
4,Valorization of lignocellulosic biomass wastes,"Forestry and agricultural residues have been the most studied materials for the direct conversion into valuable chemicals. For the present process, biomass has been typically hydrolyzed in a temperature range of 120–220 °C. Selective dilute acid hydrolysis of hemicelluloses from both wood chips and agricultural wastes has been investigated by several groups. Wood is one of the most common ‘non-food’ renewable resources containing large amounts of hemicelluloses, which strongly depends on the type of biomass [101], whereas agricultural wastes typically contain 30–42% cellulose, 20% xylan, and 20–27% lignin [4]. Acid hydrolysis of wood chips has been studied for different tree species, such as aspen, birch, paper birch, willow, pine, spruce, eucalyptus, loblolly pine, poplar, yellow poplar, oak, and red oak [102–112]. Agricultural residues, such as corn stover, corncobs, rice straw, rice hull, switchgrass, corn fiber, envelopes of corn grains, cashew nut shells, sugar cane bagasse, sugar beet pulp, wheat straw, maize straw, tobacco stalk, cornstalk, sunflower stalk, sunflower husk, and cotton husk have been used as raw materials for acid hydrolysis [103,112–121]. Still, only a few works report the direct conversion of biomass over carbon-supported metal catalysts, as detailed in the following sections."
5,Sugar alcohols production,"3.1 Sugar alcohols production Only a few reports have addressed the one-pot conversion of raw or less-treated biomass for sugar alcohols production. Palkovits et al. [43] achieved conversions of spruce wood chips between 44 and 59% and yields of sorbitol up to 36% using Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts at 160 °C and 50 bar of H2. Then, Fukuoka et al. [93,122] found that 2% Ru/AC converts beet fiber into arabitol (yield of 83% based on weight of hemicelluloses) at 155 °C for 24 h under 50 bar of H2. Käldström et al. [5] converted bleached birch kraft pulp from a Finnish pulp mill over protón and metal form of H-MCM-48 and Ru on carbon at 185 °C and 20 bar of H2, obtaining xylose and glucose as main products. Later, Kobayashi et al. [95] studied the direct conversion of raw silver grass by a carbon-supported Pt catalyst, producing small amounts of sorbitol (3 wt%) and xylitol (7 wt%). Zhou et al. [123] directly converted Jerusalem artichoke tube into hexitols, reaching yields of 93% (32% mannitol and 61% sorbitol) over 3%Ru/AC-SO3H (Table 2 , entry 1). More recently, Yamaguchi et al. [124] performed the direct conversion of Japanese cedar, eucalyptus, bagasse, empty fruit bunch, and rice straw into sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, galactitol, xylitol, and arabitol, using a 4%Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, a bimetallic 3% Ru-1%Pt/C catalyst was also tested by this group and showed higher activity for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. The amount of total sugar alcohols was increased up to 0.551 g from 1 g of milled substrate. Afterward, our group studied the direct conversion of waste cellulosic materials, such as cotton wool, cotton textile, tissue paper, and printing paper. With the exception of printing paper, a 100% conversion was reached in just 3 h with sorbitol yields around 50% using a 0.4% Ru/CNT catalyst at 205 °C and 50 bar of H2 (Table 2, entry 2) [125]. In this case, amounts of sorbitol of 0.525, 0.511, and 0.559 g could be obtained from 1 g of cotton wool, cotton textile, and tissue paper, respectively. Furthermore, Li et al. [18] accomplished the production of polyols from cornstalk (25% sorbitol, 12% xylitol, and 5% EG) and beech wood (18% sorbitol, 13% xylitol, and 4% EG) over a Ru/C catalyst at 200 °C (Table 2, entry 3)."
6,Glycols production,"3.2 Glycols production The direct conversion of biomass into 1,2-alkanediols using carbon-supported catalysts is still in its infancy. Pang et al. [80] performed the direct conversion of cornstalk into ethylene and PGs over nickel-promoted W2C catalysts. The highest yields (18% EG and 14% PG) were reached after 2 h at 245 °C over 2%Ni-30%W2C/AC (Table 2, entry 4). Moreover, birch wood without any pre-treatment produced EG with a yield of 51% over a 4%Ni-30%W2C/AC (Table 2, entry 5) [74]. Besides birch wood, this group also successfully produced EG from various woody materials, such as poplar, basswood, ash tree, bagasse, and pine wood, with EG yields between 28 and 53%. Then, an EG yield as high as 46% could be obtained from the conversion of miscanthus pre-treated with base solvents (e.g. ammonia, ethanol-ammonia, ethanol-NaOH) [126]. Zhou et al. [127] investigated a series of Ni-promoted W2C/AC catalysts for the catalytic conversion of Jerusalem artichoke tuber under hydrothermal conditions and hydrogen pressure. They found a synergy between W2C and Ni, and the best performance yielded 14 and 39% of EG and PG, respectively, over a 4%Ni-20%W2C/AC catalyst at 245 °C, 60 bar of H2 and 80 min (Table 2, entry 6). Furthermore, Pang et al. [89] evaluated the conversion of ball-milled and ethanol/NaOH pre-treated cornstalk, miscanthus, sugarcane, and wood (pine and poplar) into EG . The highest EG yields over 50% were attained after 2 h from the miscanthus that was pre-treated only by ball-milling for 3–6 h (Table 2, entry 7), whereas pine and poplar woods allowed attaining similar EG yields. Recently, our team investigated the one-pot conversion of various agricultural, forestry, and urban wastes directly into EG by a green process that only uses water as solvent, using CNT-supported Ru and W catalysts [128]. The highest yields of EG of 41–42% were attained from eucalyptus wood and cotton wool in just 5 h of reaction, whereas corncob and tissue paper also allowed reaching 24 and 34% yields, respectively (Table 2, entry 8)."
7,Concluding remarks,"The catalytic valorization of biomass wastes into valuable chemicals is a promising technology that can link the traditional refinery and renewable sources. This mini-review focussed on the direct conversion of biomass and biopolymers, such as cellulose and hemicelluloses, for the production of polyols such as sorbitol, xylitol, and EG. These compounds are extremely important because they are extensively used in food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. Great progress has been observed in the selective production of sorbitol, xylitol, and EG over a variety of highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Namely, various carbon-supported noble and non-noble metal catalysts have been developed for the one-pot conversion of biomass and its components. Moreover, some of the reported results are very encouraging for large scale application and the accumulated knowledge from these extensive studies will be a valuable guide for tuning the reaction selectivity and meet the market demand. However, the catalytic upgrading of biomass in the industry remains a significant challenge, one of the main obstacles being the absence of a low-cost processing technology that could be economically competitive with those existing for fossil-fuel-based feedstocks. To achieve this goal, the development of highly integrated systems that allow the one-pot conversion of entire lignocellulose or its components is essential. Accordingly, to accomplish the global requirements, some advances still need to be carefully thought."
8,Challenges and recommendation for future studies,"Although the direct conversion of raw lignocellulose to sugar alcohols and glycols has already been described, their successful production is mostly achieved so far from cellulose and hemicelluloses components. Lignocellulose could also be effectively converted to polyols with high yields mostly in the cases, where the lignin fraction was previously removed. Thus, the processes for biomass valorization still need to be better investigated in the future and improved for practical uses, so that further progress on performing the biorefinery by heterogeneous catalysis allows us to ensure a sustainable development. Accordingly, to promote the industrial application of biomass transformation more efforts must be made on the following aspects: (1) full use of biomass fractions; (2) continuous reaction systems to decrease energy consumption and time; (3) development of powerful in situ characterization techniques for high temperature and pressure media; (4) in-depth mechanistic understanding at a molecular level of the reactions involved; (5) synthesis of cheaper but more efficient and robust catalysts; (6) development of cost-effective pre-treatments of raw biomass; and (7) development of advanced energy-saving methods for separating the final products."
