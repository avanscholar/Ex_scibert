0,Introduction,"Pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41) is a starch-debranching enzyme that can hydrolyze the α-1,6-glucosidic linkages of pullulan, amylopectin and other branched polysaccharides [1]. Pullulanase is generally employed together with α-amylase and glucoamylase to efficiently break down starch for the production of high-glucose syrup. Pullulanase specifically hydrolyzes the branch points in amylopectin, whereas α-amylase and glucoamylase hydrolyze linear α-1,4-glucosidic linkages [2]. Addition of pullulanase to the saccharification process allows reductions in amount of glucoamylase usage and saccharification time and improves the substrate concentration and conversion rate [3]. The current saccharification reaction is usually carried out at pH 4.0–4.5 and 60 °C to maximize glucoamylase activity. An ideal pullulanase should be compatible with glucoamylase in terms of pH and temperature [4]. Bacillus acidopullulyticus pullulanase (BaPul) is a thermostable debranching enzyme that is more stable than most pullulanases at pH 4.0–4.5. BaPul is widely used in the production of glucose syrups owing to its remarkable thermo-acidophilic characteristics [5,6]. Other thermostable pullulanases, such as Geobacillus thermoleovorans US105 pullulanase, are rapidly inactivated at pH 4.5 and, thus, limited in their application [7]. The pH optimum of BaPul is 5.0, which is slightly higher than the pH required for saccharification reactions. Acidic adaptation of BaPul is of special interest; success in this endeavor will not only provide new developments in industrial applications and a better understanding of sequence–structure science. The pH-dependent activity of pullulanaes follows the pK a of catalytic residues [8–11] which is governed by the intrinsic acidity of catalytic residues and the neighboring ionizable groups [12–15]. These ionizable groups are always connected to catalytic residues by hydrogen bonds [4,16–18]. In BaPul, Glu651 is an acid/base catalyst, Asp622 is a nucleophile, and the third essential residue (Asp736) is believed to assist catalysis by elevating the pK a of Glu651 [17,19]. At pH 5.0, which is the pH optimum of the wide-type BaPul (WT), the dissociated states of Glu651 and Asp622 are different despite both acidic side chains featuring intrinsic pK as lower than 5.0. This difference is mainly due to variations in the microenvironments of Glu651 and Asp622. The objective of the present study is to improve the acidic adaptation of BaPul using hydrogen-bond-based approach to identify promising residues that may change the pK a of the catalytic residues."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Strains, plasmids, and genes","2.1 Strains, plasmids, and genes Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21(DE3) were used as cloning and expression hosts, respectively. The plasmid pET-28a(+) was used as the expression vector. B. acidopullulyticus pullulanase gene (GenBank Accession No. Ax203843.1) was synthesized by Invitrogen (Shanghai, China). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the recommended protocol in the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, USA). The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing."
3,Protein expression and purification,"2.2 Protein expression and purification Seed cultures were started by inoculating 10 mL of LB medium in a 100 mL shake flask with 10 μL of glycerol stock seed (kept frozen at −80 °C). The resulting culture was maintained at 37 °C for 10 h in a rotary shaker operated at 230 rpm. The seed culture (100 μL) was then diluted in 10 mL of modified TB medium in a 100 mL shake flask at 20 °C and shaken at 230 rpm. After 5.5 h, target protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG and then incubation for another 18–20 h. Protein purification was performed according to the detailed purification protocol described in our previous work [20,21]. Enzyme purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis. Enzyme concentrations were measured using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard."
4,Enzyme activity,"2.3 Enzyme activity Pullulanase activity was measured by incubating the enzyme at 60 °C and pH 5.0 for 10 min with 1% pullulan as the substrate. Activity was determined by assaying the release of reducing sugars via the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1.0 μmol of reducing sugars (with glucose as the standard) per minute under the specified assay conditions."
5,pH optimum and stability,"2.4 pH optimum and stability The pH optimum was determined by assaying enzyme activity in buffers with different pH ranging from 3.0 to 7.0 at 60 °C; these buffers included glycine–HCl (pH 3.0, 100 mM), citric acid–sodium citrate (pH 3.5 100 mM), sodium acetate–acetic acid (pH 4.0–5.5, 100 mM), and Na2HPO4–NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0–7.0, 100 mM). pH stability was assessed after pre-incubation of the enzymes for 24 h (4 °C) at different pH. Enzyme activity was determined under standard conditions."
6,Computer aided analysis,2.5 Computer aided analysis A model of the L627R mutant structure was generated using the fully automated homology-modeling server SWISS-MODEL (http://www.swissmodel.expasy.org/). WT (PDB code: 2WAN) was adopted as the template. The pK aS of catalytic residues in the WT and L627R mutant were predicted using PROPKA 3.0 (http://propka.org/) [22].
7,Optimum temperature and thermostability,"2.6 Optimum temperature and thermostability The optimum temperature was determined by assaying enzyme activity in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer at different temperatures (40–80 °C). The enzyme was incubated at 60 °C to determine its thermostability. Enzyme aliquots were collected at different time intervals, and enzyme that had not been incubated was used as the control (100%)."
8,Enzyme kinetics,"2.7 Enzyme kinetics Pullulan was prepared at concentration between 0.25 and 16.0 mg/mL (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 14.0, and 16.0 mg/mL) in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0. The reaction mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 10 min, and the enzyme activity was measured as above. V max and K m were determined using nonlinear regression with Origin 8.6 (OriginLab, USA). k cat was obtained using the equation k cat = Vmax/[E], where [E] is the molar concentration of the enzyme."
9,Glucose syrup production,"2.8 Glucose syrup production Starch slurry (1.5 L) with 30% solid fraction (dry weight) was prepared at pH 5.5–6.2 with α-amylase (10–15 U/g of solid substrate) and calcium (1 mM). The liquefaction process was performed with stirring at 95 °C for 1–2 h. Then, the pH was reduced to 4.0, and a high temperature (above 95 °C) was maintained for 30 min to inactivate the liquefying α-amylase. Thereafter, the temperature was lowered to 60 °C, the pH was adjusted to 4.5, and glucoamylase (120 U/g of solid substrate) and pullulanase (0.5 U/g solid substrate) were added to the mixture. Samples were taken at regular intervals to determine DX. The saccharification experiment was completed when dextrin was no longer detected using anhydrous alcohol. Samples were boiled for 10 min in water to inactivate the enzymes and then diluted with deionized water. The final mixture was filtered through a 0.22 μm micropore membrane before being subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography using a Hypersil APS-2 NH2 column with 70% (v/v) acetonitrile as the mobile phase at 35 °C and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. DX was defined as the percentage of d-glucose on a dry basis [3,20]."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Hydrogen-bond-based amino acid selection,"3.1 Hydrogen-bond-based amino acid selection Seven amino acids, namely, Val552, Asn555, Arg620, Phe621, Leu623, Met624, and Ala625, directly formed hydrogen bonds with the nucleophile Asp622 and acid/base catalyst Glu651. These amino acids were defined as primary hydrogen bonds. The secondary hydrogen bonds comprised 12 amino acids, namely, Met550, Asp551, His556, Ser586, Phe592, Leu626, Leu627, Gly628, Tyr649, Gly650, Leu665, and Val666, which formed hydrogen bonds with the primary hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1 ). Of these amino acids, eight amino acids were hydrophilic. The side chain of His556 was positive, whereas that of Asp551 was negative. Placement of a positively charged amino acid some distance from the nucleophile stabilized its deprotonated form and resulted in a reduction of the pK a of the enzyme. This placement produced a shift in the acidic limb toward more acidic values [23,24]. Thus, the selected amino acids were mutated to Arg. All of the selected amino acids may affect the pK a of the catalytic residue via electrostatic forces or by changing the proton transfer process [16–18]. In B. circulans cyclodextrin glycosyl transferases, the placement of a negatively charged residue Asp instead of Asn near the acid/base catalyst results in electrostatic elevation of the pK as values of the nucleophile and acid/base catalyst, thereby raising the pH optimum of the enzyme toward a more alkaline value [17]. However, in B. circulans xylanase, substitution of Asn35 with Asp35 results in a pronounced decrease in the pH optimum (from pH 5.7 to 4.6) despite the elevated pK as of the nucleophile Glu78 and acid/base catalyst Glu172. To explain this paradox, the author proposes that Asp35 (with a low pK a) and Glu172 may act together via a short and strong hydrogen bond to fulfill the role of the acid/base catalyst with a low pK a for the loss of the first proton [18]. Hydrogen bonds affect the pH optimum by changing the proton transfer process in this case."
12,pH dependence of pullulanase activity,"3.2 pH dependence of pullulanase activity The pH profile experiment was conducted using pullulan dissolved in the designated assay buffer between pH 3.0 and 7.0. WT showed a pH optimum of 5.0, and the two mutants revealed pH optima shifted from pH 5.0 to a more acidic value. Five mutants (Ser586R, Phe592R, Gly628R, Leu665R and M624R) reveal pH optima identical to that of the WT; except for M624R, these mutants are not shown in Fig. 2 . M624 was the only highly conserved amino acid that exhibited enzyme activity after mutation. Met550, Asp551, Val552, Asn555, His556, Arg620, Phe621, Leu623 Leu626, Tyr649, and Gly650 mutants, which are all located in the conserved regions of BaPul [25], had no catalytic ability. Experimental results indicate that these conserved amino acids are essential groups of the active center, facilitating the binding of enzymes to substrates, promoting chemical changes in the substrate, and maintaining specific enzyme conformations. Pullulanase belongs to the α-amylase family, the members of which are believed to feature the same hydrolysis mechanism. In the case of Bapul, the proton donor Glu651 protonates the glycosidic oxygen, and the catalytic nucleophile Asp622 attacks at C1 leads to the formation of the first transition state. The deprotonated state of Glu651 promotes the attack of the incoming water molecule on the formation of the covalent intermediate, resulting in a second transition state and then in the generation of a hydrolysis product [26]. The side chain carboxyl groups of Glu651 and Asp622 are protonated COOH and dissociated COOˉ, respectively, which are essential for hydrolytic functions [27,28]. Catalysis of the α-amylase family is limited both at low pH because of protonation of the nucleophile and at high pH because of deprotonation of the proton donor [29–32]. The bell-shaped curve of the pH-dependent activity profile suggests that the acidic limb of the pH activity profile is determined by the titration of the nucleophile (pK a1) and that the basic limb reflects the titration of the acid/base catalyst (pK a2) [33]. The maximum catalytic efficiency is achieved at the pH optimum, which is approximately the average of pK a1 and pK a2 [19,34,35] (Fig. 3 ). The pK a basis for the L627R mutant shifted the pH optimum of BaPul downward by 1 unit was elucidated through computer-aided analysis. The pK as values of Asp622 and Glu651 in the WT are 3.32 and 8.61, respectively, whereas those of Asp622 and Glu651 in the L627R mutant are 3.57 and 7.68, respectively. The average pK a of L627R was lower than that of the WT by 1 unit. This result is essentially in agreement with the profile shown in Fig. 2."
13,pH dependence of pullulanase stability,"3.3 pH dependence of pullulanase stability The initial pH profile assay indicated that L627R showed the best overall catalytic properties among the mutants screened. The pH optimum shifted to 4.0, and the relative activities at pH 5.0 and 4.0 were 0.65-fold and 1.17-fold, respectively, of the relative activities of WT. The acid-induced inactivation of WT was initiated once the pH dropped below 5.0. The L627R mutant showed a stability profile identical to that of WT at pH 7.0–5.0 but demonstrated remarkable tolerance to acid-mediated denaturation, retaining 95% residual activity after pre-incubation at pH 4 for 24 h (Fig. 4 ). Hydrogen bonds play an important role in the stability of proteins. A number of studies have shown that introduction of hydrogen bonds into proteins is an efficient approach to further enhance their stability [36,37]. In the present study, analysis of the structure model of L627R also showed that new hydrogen bonds were introduced to Asp622 and Val552 (Fig. 5 ). These newly added hydrogen bonds appeared to confer reduced flexibility at low pH and, thus, increased the stability of L627R."
14,Kinetic characterization,"3.4 Kinetic characterization The enzymatic basis for the improved efficacy of L627R compared with that of WT at more acidic conditions was elucidated through kinetic analysis. As the optimal temperature and heat stability of the L627R mutant were not noticeably different from those of WT (data not shown), kinetic analysis was conducted at 60 °C and pH 4.0. Table 1 shows that the substrate affinity (K m) and catalytic constant (k cat) of the L627R mutant decreased by 35% and 21%, respectively, compared with those of WT, resulting in 20% greater overall catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for the former. The specific activity of WT was 984.2 ± 54.1 U/mg, whereas that of the L627R mutant was 1,178.5 ± 76.4 U/mg. The L627R mutant exhibited greater substrate affinity than the WT, but the catalytic constant of the former was lower than that of the latter. This phenomenon may be explained by the fact that the proper conformational flexibility is critical to the catalytic activity. Compared with WT, the L627R mutant features residues with reduced flexibility in the substrate binding site due to the formation of two new hydrogen bonds. As such, the mutant has a lower catalytic constant than WT."
15,Application of the L627R mutant to glucose syrup production,"3.5 Application of the L627R mutant to glucose syrup production Liquefaction and saccharification are the two enzymatic hydrolysis processes involved in glucose syrup production. Liquefaction is the hydrolysis of gelatinized starch into short-chain oligosaccharides and requires addition of α-amylase. At the end of liquefaction, the iodine test shows a brownish-red color when a d-glucose content (DX) of 12%–15% has been achieved. Saccharification is the treatment of short-chain oligosaccharides with glucoamylase in combination with pullulanase to produce glucose syrup. Within the first 18–20 h of this process, the DX rapidly exceeds 90%. The curves of the L627R mutant and WT pullulanase were nearly identical as the enzymes feature highly similar relative activities at pH 4.5. The DX increased slowly with time, and the maximum DX for WT reached 95.7% after incubation for 50 h. The maximum DX (97.4%) for the L627R mutant was obtained after 40 h of incubation, which is shorter than WT by 10 h. Prolonged saccharification resulted in a slightly decreased DX (Fig. 6 ). The improved acid stability may result in a shorter saccharification time and a higher DX."
16,Conclusion,The strategy of changing pH-dependent profiles by altering hydrogen bonds connected to catalytic residues was explored. The acidophilic performance of BaPul was successfully improved by mutation of Leu627 to Arg. This finding serves as evidence of the important role of hydrogen bonds connected to catalytic residues in the pH-dependent regulation of enzyme activity. We suggest that the amino acid at positions corresponding to 627of BaPul play a significant role in the pH optimum of homologous pullulanases. Insights into the key amino acids correlated with the acid resistance of BaPul may serve as a guide for the development of acidophilic pullulanases.
