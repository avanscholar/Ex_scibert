0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production over semiconducting catalyst is one of the promising solutions to the increasing energy demand and its associated environmental concerns. Over the past decades, various photocatalysts have been fabricated and applied to the photocatalytic H2 production under UV or visible-light irradiation [1,2]. As a visible-light-driven photocatalyst, CdS has been extensively studied because of its excellent water-splitting property, in that its bandgap (ca. 2.42eV) corresponds well with the solar spectrum and its conduction band (CB) edge is more negative than the reduction potential of water [3,4]. Nevertheless, CdS is prone to photocorrosion during the photoreaction where CdS is itself oxidized by the photogenerated holes. Therefore, many encouraging strategies have been developed to design and prepare CdS-based photocatalysts with good photoactivity and stability [5–8]. Recently, Liu and co-workers have prepared Cd1− x Zn x S solid solution with twin nanostructures, which exhibited a superior photocatalytic H2-production activity as compared to the pristine CdS [3,9]. Moreover, carbon nanostructured materials such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTS) [10,11], graphene and/or its oxide [5,12,13] have also been used to stabilize and enhance the photoactivity of CdS. Also, noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh are generally loaded on CdS nanoparticles as co-catalyst to provide active sites for the photoreaction and suppress the charge recombination [1–8]. However, the above-mentioned noble metal co-catalysts possess the disadvantages of being rare and expensive, which limited their wide application in the field of photocatalytic H2 production. Although some non-noble metals such as Cu, Ni, and/or their oxides have been well investigated as alternative to those noble metals for promoting the charge separation and acting as a water reduction site, the chemical stability is the major shortcoming [14–18]. Therefore, the development of photocatalysts with high visible-light-responsive activity and stability for cheap and efficient H2 production is currently an intensive research area [16–20]. Metal encapsulated in carbon shell shows excellently chemical and thermal stability and might overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks [21,22]. Recent progress in encapsulation strategy is core–shell-structured co-catalyst, consisting of a noble metal (Rh, Pd, and Pt) or metal oxide (NiO x , RuO2, and Rh2O3) core and a chromia (Cr2O3) shell [23], and photodeposition of Cr2O3 on GaN/ZnO modified with the above noble metal or metal oxide co-catalyst resulted in enhanced photoactivity for overall water splitting under visible light. It was found that the enhancement in activity was primarily due to the suppression of undesirable reverse reactions (H2–O2 recombination and/or O2 photoreduction) and/or protection of the core component from chemical corrosion depending on the core type [23]. Very recently, an integrated strategy was employed to prepare visible-light-responsive Ni@C/TiO2 nanocomposite by using a pre-prepared carbon-coated Ni (Ni@C) as starting material in our group, it was found that the obtained Ni@C/TiO2 without Pt-loading exhibited remarkable stability and photocatalytic H2-production efficiency with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) up to 12% under 420nm monochromatic light irradiation [24]. Herein, the above Ni@C was used to prepare a novel CdS-based nanocomposite via a facile solvothermal process. It is noteworthy that the present carbon encapsulation strategy can not only utilize the metallic Ni in Ni@C as co-catalyst but also the graphite-like carbon coating as CdS nanoparticles’ support and electron acceptor and consequently leading to the efficient charge separation and high stability both for CdS nanoparticles and metallic Ni co-catalyst. As a result of that, a significantly enhanced photoactivity and a good stability for H2 production as compared to the pristine CdS nanoparticles were achieved over the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite without Pt-loading under visible-light irradiation."
1,Experimental,
2,Material preparation,"2.1 Material preparation All chemical reagents used were obtained from commercial sources as guaranteed-graded reagents and used without further purification. Ni@C samples were prepared by an AC arc discharge method under He gas atmosphere according to the previous publication [25]. Before using for the material preparation, 2.0M HCl solution was used to treat the Ni@C product to remove the uncoated metallic Ni particles. The as-prepared Ni@C product has particle size distribution in the range of 10–50nm and contains 67.97wt.% face-centered cubic (FCC) Ni nanocrystals encapsulated by graphite-like carbon shells [25]. Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite was prepared by a facile solvothermal process similar to the previous work but with some modifications [26]. In a typical process: 0.461g Cd(Ac)2·2H2O and 15.2mg Ni@C were added in 40mL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) under stirring. After sonication for 15min, the suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50mL) from solvothermal treatment at 180°C for 12h. The obtained sample was then washed extensively with acetone and alcohol in a sonication washer to remove non-reacted reactants and then dried at 40°C overnight to obtain 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite. By varying different Ni@C addition amount, Ni@C/CdS nanocomposites with different Ni@C addition levels were prepared. For comparison, the pristine CdS was prepared under the same procedure without addition of Ni@C. The resultant pristine CdS nanoparticles were further applied to load Ni species without carbon coating according to the previous paper [16]. In a typical process, 1.0g CdS powder and a suitable amount of Ni(NO3)2 solution were mixed in a crucible. The slurry was stirred continuously in a water bath at 80°C to evaporate the water. The dried mixture was then calcined in air at 350°C for 1h to produce a 5wt.% NiO/CdS. Some of the prepared NiO/CdS were reduced in H2 atmosphere at 400°C for 2h and subsequently oxidized in air at 200°C for 1h to produce NiO x /CdS, which should contain NiO@Ni core–shell structure according to the previous report [16]. Moreover, Pt-loading of CdS was conducted according to a typical photodeposition method. 0.2g as-prepared CdS was dispersed into 40mL distilled water under stirring, and then, 10mL methanol and 0.65mL H2PtCl6 (0.077M) solution were added in the suspension in sequence. The mixture was irradiated by a 500-W high-pressure Hg lamp for 3h under stirring. After centrifugation, the sample was washed with water and dried at 80°C for 10h to obtain 5wt.% Pt/CdS."
3,Material characterization,2.2 Material characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm). Morphology of product was observed by using a JEOL JEM 2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) working at 200kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Kratos XSAM800 X-ray photoelectron spectroscope equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (Al Kα). The diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped an integrating sphere by using BaSO4 as a reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F4500 fluorometer. The contents of various elements in sample were detected by using Bruker S4 Pioneer X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer with Rh target without standard sample. Ni content in the suspension after photoreaction was detected by using Varian AA240FS atom absorption spectrometry (AAS).
4,Photoactivity measurement,"2.3 Photoactivity measurement Photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions were carried out in an outer irradiation-type photoreactor (Pyrex glass). The photocatalyst (0.10g) was dispersed in 100mL of sacrificial reagent aqueous solution containing 0.25M Na2SO3 and 0.35M Na2S solution, which can serve as hole scavengers and allow an effectual H2 production [3,4]. A 300W Xe-lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) with a cutoff filter (Kenko L-42) was employed for visible-light (λ ⩾420nm) irradiation. Before the light irradiation, the photoreactor containing photocatalyst and the sacrificial reagent was sonicated several minutes to let the photocatalyst dispersed uniformly and then thoroughly degassed to remove air completely. The amount of evolved H2 was determined by a gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6800A, TCD, 5Å molecular sieve columns and Ar carrier). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was measured under the same photoreaction condition except for the incident monochromatic light wavelength as reported before [12,13,27]. The H2 yields of 1-h photoreaction under different monochromatic light wavelengths were measured. The band-pass and cutoff filters and a calibrated Si photodiode (SRC-1000-TC-QZ-N, Oriel, USA) were used in the above measurement. The AQY values at different wavelengths were calculated by the following equation [12,13,27]. (1) AQY(%)= The number of reacted electrons The number of incident photons × 100 = 2 × The number of evolved H 2 molecules The number of incident photons × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Crystal phase analyses,"3.1 Crystal phase analyses Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the various products. As can be seen, the graphite shows a sharp (002) peak with 2θ located at ∼26.5°, ascribable to the interlayer distance of 0.334nm, and the single Ni@C also shows an diffraction peak, basically consistent to the graphite’s diffraction peak with 2θ located at ∼26.5°, indicating the carbon in Ni@C existed as graphite-like structures. Moreover, there are two obvious diffraction peaks with 2θ located at ∼44.6° and ∼51.8°, ascribable to the (111) and (200) crystal planes of face-centered cubic (FCC) metallic Ni, indicating Ni in Ni@C existed as metallic particles even through the acid pre-treated process [25]. The pristine CdS derived from the DMSO solvothermal process without calcination post-treatment shows broadening diffraction peaks, indicating its small particle sizes. Those diffraction peaks with 2θ located at ca. 26.9°, 44.2°, and 52.0° can be ascribed to the (111), (220), and (311) crystal planes of cubic-phase CdS (JCPDS 42-1411) [8], respectively. As for the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposites with different Ni@C contents, all of those diffraction peaks with 2θ located at ca. 26.9°, 44.2°, and 52.0° are similar to the pristine CdS as shown in Fig. 1, indicating the CdS in the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposites also exists as cubic crystal phase, and there is no diffraction peak attributable to Ni@C, which might be due to the low content and high dispersion of Ni@C [5,14,28]. However, even for the 10wt.% Ni@C/CdS, diffraction peak ascribable to metallic Ni or Ni@C cannot be observed from the XRD pattern. The detail reason on this issue might be that those broadening diffraction peaks of the cubic CdS enshrouded the corresponding Ni@C peaks, which are overlapped with those of the CdS as can be observed from Fig. 1. Moreover, the diffraction peak intensities of CdS gradually decrease upon enhancing the Ni@C addition level, indicating the Ni@C can successfully immobilize CdS nanoparticles and retard the crystal growth [13,29]."
7,Microstructure and composition analyses of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite,"3.2 Microstructure and composition analyses of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite TEM images in Fig. 2 a and b shows that 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite consists of Ni@C with its graphite-like carbon coatings densely decorated by CdS nanoparticles with an average particle size of ∼5nm, whereas Ni@C nanoparticles with broader size distribution range and larger mean particle sizes (∼40nm) randomly disperse in the sample. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 2b that the metallic Ni nanoparticle is encapsulated in several carbon layers, and some carbon layers show decreased crystallinity and/or amorphous structures. As can be seen from Fig. 2c, the pristine CdS derived from the solvothermal process without addition of Ni@C shows that those CdS aggregations composed of nanoparticles with particle size in the range of 2–12nm, indicating that the aggregation and growth of the CdS nanoparticles can be retarded by introducing Ni@C in the reaction system, which is consistent to the above XRD observation results. Moreover, the well-resolved lattice fringes with d-spacings of ca. 0.206, 0.198, and 0.334nm can be assigned to CdS(220), Ni(111), and graphite(002) crystal planes, respectively. It indicated that Ni@C can retain its original structure even after the present solvothermal process, and the tiny CdS nanocparticles have high crystallinity. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum inserted in Fig. 2b reveals that the nanoparticle with the largest diameter contains Ni and C elements, implying those nanoparticles with lager particle diameters and lower transmissivity in Fig. 2a can be identified as the Ni@C nanoparticles; their particle size distribution and morphology are also similar to those of the as-prepared Ni@C sample [25]. As can be seen from Table 1 , the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis results reveal that Ni@C contents in 1wt.%, 5wt.%, and 10wt.% Ni@C/CdS nanocomposites are 0.95wt.%, 4.96wt.%, and 8.68wt.%, which is approximate to the corresponding initial addition amount except for the 10wt.% Ni@C/CdS, and their atom molar ratios of Cd/S are equal to ca. 1:1 with Ni/C atom molar ratio of 0.41:1, while the single Ni@C has Ni/C atom molar ratio of 0.50:1, indicating the Ni contents in various nanocomposites are slightly lower than its addition amount. To further check the effects of the present solvothermal process on Ni@C, Ni@C was also treated by the same preparation process of Ni@C/CdS without addition of Cd(Ac)2, and the corresponding XRF analysis results of the solvothermally treated Ni@C are also listed in Table 1. As can be seen, the Ni and C contents in the Ni@C samples with and without solvothermal treatment are very similar. The above results suggested that the present solvothermal process does not destroy the original structure of Ni@C, and the loss of Ni@C during the preparation process is limited. The survey XPS spectrum of the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS in Fig. 3 can support the above suggestions. There is no obvious XPS peak due to Ni species observed from the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS, implying that most of Ni species are enveloped by the graphite-like carbon coatings and maintained its original structure. Cd peaks are found at 412.4eV (Cd2+, 3d3/2) and 405.7eV (Cd2+, 3d5/2), respectively. In addition, S peak located at 162.0eV can be assigned to S2−(2p3/2) in the form of CdS [29], and the peak located at 284.5eV can be assigned to C1s. Based on the above observations, it is reasonable to conjecture that the Ni@C has a high chemical and thermal stability, and most of Ni@C nanoparticles maintained its original structures with metallic Ni core and graphite-like shell, which is consistent with our previous observation [24]."
8,Absorption spectra analyses of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite,"3.3 Absorption spectra analyses of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite Fig. 4 shows the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) of Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite catalysts containing different Ni@C contents. As can be seen, the pristine CdS shows an absorption edge at ca. 530nm, and its bandgap energies can be estimated to be ∼2.34eV by a related curve of (αhv)1/2 vs. photon energy. It is worthy to note that the bandgap is lower than the commonly bulk CdS (2.42eV) [12,30]. The reason may be due to the different physical properties, such as particle size, morphology, aggregation state, surface states and defects, stemming from the different preparation processes [12,31,32]. Moreover, Ni@C displays full absorption in the observed wavelength range, and the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposites show slight red-shift and the absorbance in the range of 500–700nm increased with enhancing the Ni@C content as compared to the pristine CdS. Although CdS has no absorption above its fundamental absorption edge rising at ∼530nm, the composites show a broad elevated background in the visible region due to the presence of Ni@C. Moreover, there is an enhanced absorbance in the visible-light region (>500nm) with enhancing the Ni@C content. It could be attributed to the enhancement of the surface electric charge of the CdS in the composite because of the introduction of Ni@C, which leads to the possible electronic transition of π → π * of Ni@C and n → π * between the n-orbit of the sulfur species in CdS and Ni@C [11]. This enhancement happens at wavelength >500nm, indicating a more efficient utilization of the solar energy can be obtained. Therefore, it can be inferred that the introduction of Ni@C in CdS particles would have influence on the fundamental process of the photogenerated carrier formation and separation in the photocatalytic process [24]."
9,BET surface area analyses of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite,"3.4 BET surface area analyses of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite Fig. 5 shows the liquid N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves of the obtained products. As can be seen, both the pristine CdS and 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS show similar type II isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, which are associated with the mesoporous structures existing in the aggregates of nanoparticles. The BET specific surface area of the pristine CdS and Ni@C/CdS is calculated to be ∼49 and ∼50m2 g−1, respectively. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, the Ni@C/CdS has one broad peak centered at ∼30nm in the BJH pore size distribution curve, whereas the pristine CdS shows a much narrower one with much lower porosity. The much higher porosity of the Ni@C/CdS can be ascribed to the less aggregations of the CdS nanoparticles, which would lead to more efficient surface adsorption and faster photogenerated carrier separation, and then to the improvement of photoactivity."
10,Photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency and stability,"3.5 Photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency and stability The photoactivities for H2 evolution from an aqueous suspension containing Na2S (0.25M)–Na2SO3 (0.35M) solution and the obtained photocatalyst (100mg) were achieved under visible-light (λ ⩾420nm) irradiation. Control experiments show no appreciable H2 evolution in the absence of either photocatalyst or visible-light irradiation. The effects of Ni@C contents in the nanocomposite on the average photocatalytic H2-production rate under 5h of visible-light irradiation were shown in Fig. 6 . As can be seen, the pristine Ni@C shows limited photocatalytic H2-production activity (21.5μmolh−1), and the Ni@C treated by the solvothermal process still exhibits very similar photoactivity (23.2μmolh−1). It further confirms the above conclusion that the present solvothermal process does not destroy the original structure of Ni@C. Those Ni@C/CdS composites with different Ni@C contents show higher photoactivity than the pristine CdS. Among those, 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS has the maximum average H2-production efficiency (622.7μmolh−1), which is 2.2 times as high as that (280.5μmolh−1) of the pristine CdS. The increased H2 evolution rate with enhancing the Ni@C content from 1wt.% to 5wt.% could be attributed to the distinctive structure and electrical properties of the Ni@C/CdS, which is favorable for the separation of the photogenerated carriers. By considering the single Ni@C shows limited photocatalytic H2-production activity (21.5μmolh−1) as shown in Fig. 6, it is reasonable to think that the excessive Ni@C may hinder the nanocomposite’s light absorption and lead to the decrease in the CdS relative content, which will decrease the electrons excited from the valence band (VB) of CdS. Thus, the photoactivity shows a decreasing trend when the Ni@C content exceeds 5wt.%. As a result, the maximum photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency (622.7μmolh−1) is obtained from 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS without Pt-loading. Further experiments show that the physical mixture (Ni@C+CdS) of 5wt.% Ni@C and CdS also exhibits considerable photocatalytic H2-production activity (332.8μmolh−1), which is higher than that of the pristine CdS but much lower than that (622.7μmolh−1) of the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6. Moreover, the solvothermally prepared nanocomposite (Soot/CdS) containing CdS and single soot (amorphous carbon prepared by an AC arc discharge under the same conditions of Ni@C without addition of Ni power [25]) shows lower photocatalytic H2 production than the pristine CdS, while those solvothermally prepared nanocomposites containing CdS and Ni species derived from the similar solvothermal process, for example Ni/CdS or (Soot+Ni)/CdS) prepared by using Ni powders or (soot+Ni) mixture instead of Ni@C, show slightly higher photoactivity than the pristine CdS as shown in Table 2. The above results indicate that the existence of metallic Ni species can promote the photocatalytic activity of CdS in the present photoreaction system, and the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite has the best photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency among those products tested. Therefore, it can be conjectured that the particular structure of Ni@C containing graphite-like carbon shell and the metallic Ni core should exert an important synergistic effect during the photocatalytic H2-production reaction. It is well known that Pt serving as a co-catalyst can enhance the photoactivity [29,33,34]. In this study, it is also found an enhanced photoactivity for 5wt.% Pt/CdS as shown in Table 2. 5wt.% Pt/CdS also exhibits considerable photocatalytic H2-production activity (534.8μmolh−1), which is slightly lower than that (622.7μmolh−1) of 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS. However, the Pt co-catalyst possesses the disadvantages of being rare and expensive, which limited their wide application in the photocatalytic H2 production as mentioned above [17,18]. Previous reports indicated that Ni metal and/or its oxide loaded on CdS can efficiently improved the water-splitting efficiency [2,16]. To further make clear the role of the carbon coating of Ni nanoparticles, two kinds of carbon-free Ni-loaded CdS (NiO/CdS and NiO x /CdS) were prepared as mentioned in the experimental section [16], and their photocatalytic H2-production efficiencies were checked under the photoreaction conditions similar to the Ni@C/CdS and the corresponding results are also listed in Fig. 6. As can be seen, NiO/CdS and NiO x /CdS nanocomposites under 5h of visible-light irradiation show average photocatalytic H2-production efficiency of 460.6 and 523.9μmolh−1, respectively. Namely, the NiO@Ni core–shell structure loaded on CdS nanoparticles is more effective for improving the H2 production as compared with the NiO, which is consistent with the previous reports [2,16]. Nevertheless, NiO/CdS still shows much lower photoactivity than the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS for the visible-light-driven H2 evolution. However, the H2 generation rate (622.7μmolh−1) of the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS is only slightly higher than that (523.9μmolh−1) of NiO x /CdS. By considering that this none so huge difference in photoactivity may come from the different surface areas or accessibility of electrolyte to the metal Ni rather than the role of carbon as an electron conduit, the BET specific surface area of the NiO x /CdS was determined to be ∼47m2 g−1, which is very similar to that (50m2 g−1) of the Ni@C/CdS. Therefore, the difference in H2 generation between Ni@C/CdS and NiO x /CdS is unlikely due to their different surface areas. Unlike the NiO@Ni core–shell structure, in which NiO is the core and metal Ni is the shell, the graphite-like shell structure of Ni@C would block the accessibility of electrolyte to the metal Ni core, which might suppress the H2-production reaction and its release to gas phase, and then lead to a reduced photoactivity. However, the NiO x /CdS shows lower photoactivity than the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS for the present visible-light-driven H2 evolution. The reason may result from the different properties of those shell structures (metallic Ni and graphite-like carbon). As a stable charge carrier, the graphite-like carbon shell is a more efficient electron conductor to transfer its accepted electrons to the metallic Ni core, whereas NiO core of NiO x usually acts as n-type semiconductor and will carry through relative complicated charge change and transfer processes during the following photoreaction for H2 production as compared to the Ni@C, which would lead to the breakage of the core–shell structure of NiO@Ni and then to the decrease in photostability of NiO x /CdS. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the carbon shell of Ni@C also acted important role on improving the photoactivity and stability of CdS, and there is synergistic effect in the present nanocomposites. The above conjecture on stability can be supported by the time courses for the visible-light-driven H2 production of the above-mentioned representative products as shown in Fig. 7 . The photocatalytic H2 production over those photocatalysts in three or five consecutive runs, in which fresh sacrificial reagent solution periodically is replaced in each run. As can be seen, the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS can produce more than 14mmol H2 during 25-h photoreaction with an average H2 generation rate of 622.7μmolh−1 in the first run of 5h photoreaction and then slightly declines to 577.5, 579.0, 546.5 and 547.6μmolh−1 in the second, third, fourth and fifth run of 5h photoreaction, respectively. The percentages of the H2-generation rate of the second, third, fourth and fifth run as compared to the first run’s are calculated to be 92.7%, 93.0%, 87.8% and 87.9%, respectively, whereas the pristine CdS, Ni/CdS, NiO x /CdS, (soot+Ni)/CdS, and Pt/CdS nanocomposites show more obvious declines in the H2 generation rate in three consecutive runs as shown in Fig. 7. After the third run, the corresponding percentages of the H2 generation rate as compared to the first run’s are calculated to be 54.2% for the pristine CdS, 65.8% for Ni/CdS, 76.5% for the NiO x /CdS, 80.6% for (Soot+Ni)/CdS, and 85.5% for the Pt/CdS, respectively. The above results indicate that the existence of metallic Ni species can improve both the photoactivity and photostability of CdS in the present photoreaction system. Moreover, (Soot+Ni)/CdS has better photostability than the pristine CdS, Ni/CdS and NiO x /CdS, also indicating the existence of carbon can improve the photostability of CdS though the solvothermally prepared Soot/CdS shows lower photocatalytic H2-production activity than the pristine CdS as shown in Table 2. Meanwhile, AAS analysis results (Fig. 7) on the supernatant of the 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS suspension after the photoreaction process show that no obvious changes in the Ni concentration, indicating limited Ni corrosion occurring during the photoreaction. The above results imply that the Ni@C/CdS is more stable photocatalyst than the pristine CdS, Ni/CdS, NiO x /CdS, (soot+Ni)/CdS, and Pt/CdS. Namely, the present carbon encapsulation strategy of Ni co-catalyst exerted important role in the present photocatalytic system with high efficiency and good chemical/thermal stability."
11,Overview of the photocatalytic mechanism of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite,"3.6 Overview of the photocatalytic mechanism of the Ni@C/CdS nanocomposite As can be seen from Fig. 8 , 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS shows a wide photoresponsive wavelengths ranging from 420 to 550nm. The AQY values at 420, 450, 475, 500, 520 and 550nm monochromatic light is ca. 20.5%, 15.2%, 12.0%, 6.4% and 1.8%, respectively. However, 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS shows no obvious H2 production when the monochromatic light wavelength is ⩾575nm. Obviously, the AQY values decrease with enhancing the incident light wavelength, and the wavelength suitable for H2 evolution is found to coincide with the absorption edge of the pristine CdS even though the composite photocatalyst still shows high absorbance at wavelength >550nm, indicating that the H2 evolution reaction was indeed driven by the photoinduced CdS excitation, and the light absorption property of CdS in the nanocomposite governed the photoactivity for H2 production [28,35,36]. Nevertheless, the photoresponsive wavelength range of the composite can be expanded to at least 550nm after coupling with Ni@C though the absorption edge of the pristine CdS is ca. 530nm as shown in Figs. 4 and 10 . Namely, the addition of Ni@C can finitely expand the photoresponsive wavelength range of CdS from 530 to 550nm, but the absorption at >600nm for Ni@C/CdS could not contribute to the photoactivity for H2 production. Therefore, a possible mechanism for H2 production over the present Ni@C/CdS was proposed as illustrated in Fig. 9 . The primary role of Ni@C in CdS photocatalytic reaction is likely to be the conduction band (CB) electron acceptor since the graphite carbon has a more positively leveled work function position (ca. 4.60eV [37]) as compared to CB energy level (ca. 3.49eV [6,12]) of CdS. This indicates that charge transfer from CdS to carbon shell of Ni@C is thermodynamically allowed. The charge transfer from photo-excited CdS to MWCNT has been studied in photoelectrochemical systems [6]. A similar mechanism can be applied to Ni@C/CdS system of this study. As discussed above, the graphite carbon has a more positively leveled work function position as compared to CdS [6,12,37]. The VB electrons of CdS can be excited to its CB by the absorbed light and then transfer to the densely contacted graphite-like carbon shell of Ni@C, where those photogenerated electrons can further accumulate in Ni nanoparticles and then react with the adsorbed proton/water to produce H2 [16,29,38]. Moreover, the graphite-like carbon as the supporting matrix of CdS nanoparticles can transfer those photogenerated electrons from CdS quickly and resulting in the suppression of the photogenerated carrier recombination [34]. In addition, the work function (ca. 4.60eV) of carbon shell in Ni@C is greater than the CB energy level (ca. 3.49eV) of CdS, but is smaller than that (ca. 5.35eV) of metal Ni co-catalyst [6,37], leading to facile charge transfer from carbon shell to Ni and resulting in high H2 production. The above control experiment revealed that soot/CdS and Ni/CdS prepared via a similar solvothermal process show no obvious improvement in the photoactivity as compared to the pristine CdS, which is similar to the previous results [39]. Therefore, it is reasonable to conjecture that the synergy effect is the crucial for the efficient electron transfer and separation and then for the significant improvement in the photoactivity. It should be noted, however, that such relative energetics is just one of many factors and all the other factors such as proton adsorption/desorption energy, intrinsic rates of electron transfer (e.g., exchange current), and particle size effects seem to influence hydrogen production with different degrees [6]. To further confirm the above assumption, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the obtained photocatalysts under illumination by 380nm light are shown in Fig. 10. It can be clearly seen that the pristine CdS nanoparticles exhibiting a strong broad peak locates at ca. 530nm, which locates near the absorption edge, may be attributed the bandgap excitation of CdS nanoparticles [17,29]. In addition, almost no emission can be directly observed from the single Ni@C, and significant fluorescence quenching of CdS can be observed after coupling CdS with Ni@C, which shows ∼5nm blue-shift and much lower PL peak intensity as shown in Fig. 10. Moreover, a similar quenching effect can be observed from both 1wt.% and 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS nanocomposites. Namely, the fluorescence quenching effect is mainly due to the addition of Ni@C though Ni and C species may hinder light absorption by CdS more or less. The above results indicate the electron–hole pairs in the excited CdS could be efficiently transfer from the CdS to the densely contacted carbon shells of the Ni@C and then to Ni for H2 production [29]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the graphite-like carbon coating on metal Ni nanoparticles acted not only as protection layers of the Ni core and supporting matrix of the CdS nanoparticles, but also as electron acceptor to increase the electron acceptance and transport rates in the composite and then suppress the charge recombination; thereby, a higher efficiency and stability could be achieved. Apparently, the above results suggested interesting possibility for the fabrication of carbon encapsulated Ni co-catalyst coupled in CdS-based composite photocatalyst with better durability and broader light absorption range in comparison with the pristine CdS. The present distinctive and extraordinary carbon encapsulation structures of Ni co-catalyst are helpful to hinder the backward electron transfer and improve the electron injection and quantum efficiency although the detailed charge transfer mechanism should be further elucidated due to the unknown relative energetics of the Ni@C, which is a critical factor determining photocatalytic activity for H2 production. Anyway, the present Ni co-catalyst encapsulation strategy can be utilized to couple with not only CdS but also other semiconductors, which can provides an inexpensive fabrication routine of novel photocatalyst with excellent photoactivity and durability for the practical application of the H2 production."
12,Conclusions,"Carbon encapsulation strategy of Ni co-catalyst is applied to the fabrication of novel carbon-coated Ni (Ni@C)/CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst, which were prepared by a facile solvothermal process by using a pre-prepared Ni@C as a starting material. The obtained Ni@C/CdS nanocomposites exhibit enhanced photoactivity and photostability for photocatalytic H2 production as compared to the pristine CdS under the same photoreaction conditions, and 5wt.% Ni@C/CdS shows a maximum average photocatalytic H2-production rate of 622.7μmolh−1 during 5-h visible-light irradiation and an apparent quantum yield up to ca. 20.5% under 420nm monochromatic light irradiation. The metallic Ni in Ni@C acted as co-catalyst while the graphite-like carbon as CdS nanoparticles’ support and electron acceptor, which resulting in the efficient charge separation, and then the enhanced photoactivity and stability for H2 production under visible-light irradiation. The present novel carbon encapsulation strategy of co-catalyst seems to highlight the most possibility that utilizing the unique properties of Ni@C as stable co-catalyst, electron acceptor and supporting matrix by appropriate designing of photocatalyst microstructures, which is cheap, abundant, and environmentally friendly, to develop cheap, efficient photoactivity for H2 production with durable and steady property."
