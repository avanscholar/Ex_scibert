0,Introduction,"Increasing destructive environmental pollution due to increasing demand of automobile’s vehicles, industrialisation of world and energy consumption [1]. On the other hand, use of gasoline fuels is restricted mainly due to presence of sulfur content which causes corrosion and ecological destructive pollution [2]. Most of the countries development depends upon imported gasoline fuels due to limited sources of resources and which means great impact on countries economy [3]. Energy demand is increasing melodramatically due to fast industrialisation and rising population, expanding development and economic growth in the world. To energy demand problem, a widely used of CI engine from different gasoline resources. The application of biodiesel has shown a positive impact in resolving these issues. Edible biodiesels are one of the potential feed stocks alternative fuels for of CI engine production [4]. In this regards biodiesel is non-hazardous, biodegradable and eco-friendly for environmental as compared to gasoline fuel. Alternative fuel for CI engine is produced from agricultural feedstocks and virgin vegetable oil, these biodiesel are used as a replacement of regular diesel fuel. Therefore, the feedstocks of these renewablesource and lesser emissions should be agricultural wastes, edible and non-edible vegetable oils, animal fat, waste oil and alcohol biodiesel and biodiesel is considered as the potential fuel for complete replacement of diesel in CI engines [5,6]. In this respect, there is a need for clean and non-deleterious alternative source of energy for CI engine and to supply the continues increase energy consumption for blended fuels such as edible and non-edible vegetables oil, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol biodiesel investigated by previous researches. Edible vegetable oil (Rapeseed, soybean, coconut, palm, sunflower, peanut, olive and sesame seed), Non-edible vegetable oil (jatropha curcas, karanja, pongamia, jojoba, cottonseed, algae and sea mango), Animal fats oil (Chicken fat, yellow grease and by-products from fish oil), Waste oil (Oil and grease from households, restaurants and food processing factories) and Alcohol feedstocks (butanol, Ethanol, methanol, propanol, pentanol) [1–4] are commonly used as biofuels in engines. Many researchers have found that soot formation [7,8,21,49], carbon monoxide (CO) emission and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emission [8–10,49], carbon dioxides emission (CO2) [10–12], hydrocarbons (HC) emission [12–14], particulate matter (PM) emission [14–16], smoke emission [17–19] are reduced through the use of edible and non-edible vegetables oil, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol biodiesel for alternative fuels is CI engine. Edible vegetables oil biodiesel used by Qi et al. (2016) [21] by on soybean oil, Chong C T. et al. (2015) [22] on palm oil, Kuleshov and Mahkamov (2008) [20] by numerically investigation of engine performance, mission parameters, Albo et al. (2017) [24] by experimentally investigation of fuel properties, Zhao et al. (2018) [23] by numerical studies of soot formation using rapeseed oil and soybean, Saydut et al. (2016) [2] and on sunflower oil optimization production, Zareh et al. (2017) [11] by experimentally investigation engine characteristic using coconut and Mishra et al. (2017) [38] by engine characteristics based on experiments done on coconut, palm, sunflower oil are investigated diesel engine. Non-edible vegetables oil biodiesel reviewed in 2014 by Ashraful et al. [4] production, fuel properties, engine characteristic, in 2011 experimental investigation of diesel engine characteristic fueled with karanja biodiesel and its blend with methanol. Another numerical investigation was conducted in 2016 by Wang et al. [7] use of the three different fuel (jatropha methyl ester, cottonseed methyl ester, and rubber seed oil methyl ester and obtained soot formation. Huzayyin et al. (2004) [8] experimentally evaluated engine parameters using jojoba oil and its blends with regular diesel fuel and biodiesel production from karanja oil and its use in CI engine as a alternative fuel and completely replaced diesel in 2017 by Patel et al. [26]. In 2011 properties of spirulina algae, swine manure and digested anaerobic sludge of bio crude oil through the hydrothermal liquefaction are investigated by Vardon et al. (2011) [32] and third generation biodiesel production and characteristic from microalgae was investigated by Nautiyal et al. (2014) [37]. Production of microalgae (spirulina maxima) biodiesel and optimization of processes variable through two step reaction method by Rahman et al. (2017) [33]. Another non-edible reviewed studies on biodiesel production from microalgae by Faried et al. (2017) [31]. In 2004, biodiesel production from beef tallow with methanol and potassium hydroxide as catalyst reaction by Cunhan et al. [30]. In 2013, an optimization of conversion ethylic biodiesel from animal fat waste using alkali-catalyzed process by Cunha et al. [39] was performed. The revived studies in 2014, biodiesel production from animal fat waste using transesterification reaction by Banković-Ilić et al. [40] and in 2015, investigated engine characteristic use of waste oil of chicken fat and flesh based biodiesels and its blends with regular diesel fuel and biodiesel production in the pilot plant. Result was evaluated at constant engine speed and different loads [5]. Šánek et al. (2016), investigation of pilot-scale production of biodiesel from animal fats waste and waste frying oils used of tetramethylammonium hydroxide reaction method [41]. Sales et al. (2017) investigation of biodiesel production from animal fat and vegetables soybean and palm oils by ethylic transesterification method without any chemical or biochemical catalysts at different subcritical thermodynamic conditions was achieved [42]. Production of biodiesel from animal fats such as veal, beef tallow, lard, chicken and goose by using of transesterification catalysed chemical reaction through alkali catalyst in 2017 by Sander et al. [27]. In 2018, biodiesel production and purification from waste animal fats was done by Sander et al. [36] and Kirubakaran and Selvan [43]. Effect of fuel injection pressure (FIP) was investigated in 2014 and its effect on the engine characteristic combustion and emission was studied. Result shows that peak cylinder pressure and the peak heat release rate is lowered as compared to diesel fuel but showsreduction in smoke level, CO, HC exhaust gas emissions with higher FIP using of WCO (waste cooking oil) by Hwang et al. [44]. In 2016, investigations of energy recovery from lingo cellulosic SMW, POW with slow pyrolysis reacts to the growing tendencyof alternative resources as well as waste handle administration. Zaafouri et al. [28] and another experimental studied in 2017 by castor oil biodiesel (CAB), coconut oil biodiesel (COB) and wastecooking oil biodiesel (WCB) were produced by transesterification approach and blended different percentage with diesel and found engine characteristic with different engine loads [11]. Wei et al. (2017) experimental investigation engine performance and emission characteristic fueled with waste cooking oil and the result shows that reduction in weighted particlemass concentration (PMC) and the weighted geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles and observed that using blend (B75%) or biodiesel than shows reduction in weighted total number concentration[25]. In 2017, reviewed studies is made on waste-oil biodiesel utilization as an alternative fuel for CI engine and replacement completely convention fossil fuel by Hajjari et al. [48]. In 2010, experimental studied was conduct by Rakopoulos et al., diesel engine use of blends (30% biodiesel and 25% n-butanol) with regular diesel fuel and test conducted on a turbocharged truck model. Theresultshows that formation of nitric oxide and smoke level at daily base operated conditions with different accelerating schedules experienced. The exhaust gas emissions of the two blend ration with unchanged diesel and blends shows reduction in smoke but higher of NO as compared to baseline operating condition [17]. Numerical investigation and optimization of methanol power in CI engine was carried out by Soni and Gupta in 2016. They adopted three methods in this numerical work which are diesel-methanol blend, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and water addition with diesel fuel with same operating condition for engine. The result shows that, the water addition method is more effective as compared to other two due to reduction in emissions. In 2016 by Qi et al., the experiment was conducted and investigated the effects of ambient temperature on the CI engine combustion characteristic and formation of soot and oxidation, fuel withdiesel-soybean biodiesel and butanol blends. The result shows theincrease is ambient temperature, by which the flame propagates downstream of the sprayjet and developed brighter hence forming the soot higherata higher ambient temperature for blend ratio, and S10B10 which had a lower value of normalized time integrated soot mass (NTISM). Therefore, 80% diesel-10% soybean and butanol, results in the reduction ofsoot formation, emission as compared to 80% diesel-15% soybean-5% butanol [21]. (2016) studies of diesel–waste oil biodiesel and propanol, n-butanol or 1-pentanol blends in a diesel engine and obtained engine performance and exhaust gas emission. The alcohol blend ratio shows reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emissions as 1-pentanol, n-butanoland propanol buton the other hand increased of CO emissions [35]. Jamrozik (2017), experimental examined the diesel engine characteristic (combustion, performance and emission) fueled with alcohol (0–40%) content in the fuel blends (diesel-methanol and diesel-ethanol). The result shows the improvement in efficiency and great impact on CO emission reduction and negative effect on nitrogen oxides emissions [12]. Due to accurate results, less time consuming and dependable output, more and more researchers were moving forward to numerical approach for studying the characteristics of internal combustion engine. One such specialized numerical solver for internal combustion engine is the Diesel-RK. A study by Datta et al. [51] have performed a numerical analysis through which an internal combustion engine is modelled in the numerical solver by keeping 1500 rpm as engine speed and injection of 23°b TDC with alcohol as fuel additive in diesel. The results shows that there is reduction of various harmful pollutants from the exhaust, but little changes are observed in CO2. The authors suggested that NOX reduction is more in ethanol blended with diesel, as compared to methanol. Another study by Al-Dawody et al. [52] has also optimized the emission of NOX from biodiesels (Soybean methyl ester) in an internal combustion engine through the numerical solver Diesel-RK. The optimized results from the numerical solver shows the reduction of NOX emission by up to 50.26%, and the results were validated using experimental study at identical conditions of operation. Other optimization models include regression analysis being performed on an internal combustion engine using Diesel-RK numerical solver [53]. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been known to provide reliable and accurate results of modelled experiments while reducing time and cost of the research. Numerical solver such as FIRE® have been found to be successful in modelling and predicting the performance, combustion and emission characteristic of internal combustion engines. Characteristics such as NOX, soot concentrations, in-cylinder pressure/temperature etc. was found to have been in good correlation between experimental and numerical results. Petranović Z at al. (56–57) has demonstrated the application of FIRE® in capturing chemical phenomenon and predicting concentration of pollutant from the emissions. They have concluded that NOX is significantly reduced in blending biodiesels with conventional diesel. The aim of the present study is to numerically investigate the NOX, PM, smoke and summary of emissions while using five different categories (edible and non-edible vegetables oil, waste animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) of biodiesel, comparing with identical conditions of regular diesel fuel. The present study will be helpful in understanding emission level on a CI engine with alternative biodiesel without any modification in the engine model. The proposed numerical model were first validated against experimental resultsof cylinder pressure versus crank angle, smoke and NOX versus load using advance injection timing 23.0° bTDC and 24.0° bTDC. The authors have also conducted an uncertainty analysis of the instruments for increasing the accuracy of the results."

9,Results and discussion,"The main objective of this numerical simulation is to take the test fuels diesel and five different categories (edible and non-edible, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) biodiesel for evaluating the exhaust gas emission characteristics through a single cylinder, four stroke, DI, water cooled, naturally aspirated diesel engine. The study was carried out at an advanced SOI of 23.0° CA bTDC with constant FIP of 220 bar, different engine loads with constant engine speed (1500 rpm) andCR17.5."
10,Emission characteristic,"5.1 Emission characteristic The exhaust gas emission characteristic by the engine under study is presented herein. Emission characteristics such as NOX, smoke, particulate matter (PM) and summary of emissions (SE) are discussed in this section. 5.1.1 NOX emission The nitric oxides emission and NO2 are emission generated during combustion process due to reason of oxygen and nitrogen at high temperatures. Main reason of NOXemissions produced in combustion process is oxygen present in free air. However, regular fossil fuel have a trace amount of nitrogen molecules in their structure but the nitrogen content within the fuel have as lighting effect on nitric oxides emission. The NOX emission depends on combustion cylinder temperature, pressure, air-fuel ratio during combustion process and properties such as viscosity, bulk modulus and humidity also affects the NOX emission. The NOX emission shows reduction with increase in humidity of air. The biodiesel blends of B20% produced lower NOX emission due to calorific value and viscosity of biodiesel fuel [5,9,12]. The NOX emission are the destructive pollutants produced by diesel engine due to flame temperature, oxygen percentage within fuel and time of reaction process [14]. The NOX emission at different engine load for the different categories of biodiesel (such as edible and non-edible, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) with diesel are shown in Fig. 5 (a–e). The NOX increases with increasing load of engine at all tested fuels in the present study. Almost all the tested biodiesel fuels in the numerical method predicts that NOX emission computed was lower as compared to diesel fuel, due to calorific value, viscosity of biodiesel fuel, etc. at in CR17.5. It was observed during full load that, NOX was found (for edible vegetable oil) to be 3490 ppm, 3220 ppm, 3850 ppm, 3050 ppm and 3690 ppm for coconut, palm, rapeseed, soybean and sunflower; (non- edible vegetable oil) 4070 ppm, 3970 ppm, 3003 ppm, 3580 ppm and 3240 ppm for cotton seed, jatropha, jojoba curcas, karanja and microalgae; (waste animal fats oil) 2680 ppm, 3690 ppm, 3758 ppm, 3650 ppm, 3940 ppm and 3790 ppm for chicken fats, beef oil, fish oil, lard oil, poultry oil, and veal oil; (waste oil) 3280 ppm, 3360 ppm and 3790 ppm for grease oil, waste cooking oil and waste frying oil; (alcohol) biodiesel of 212 ppm, 218 ppm, 1120 ppm, 2000 ppm, 989 ppm and for butanol, ethanol, methanol, pentanol, propanol and 3900 ppm for diesel; with constant speed, CR, injection timing and fuel injection pressure of 220 bar. The fraction of wet NOX in exhaust gas is lower by 21.79% for soybean biodiesel (edible vegetable oil), 23% for jojoba curcas biodiesel (non-edible vegetable oil), 31.28% for chicken fats oil biodiesel (waste animal fats oil), 15.89% for grease oil biodiesel (waste oil) and 94.56% for butanol biodiesel (alcohol); as compared to diesel. The NOX increases with increasing load of engine at all tested fuels in the present study. It can be observed that the NOX emission is depends upon the temperature of engine cylinder, percentage of oxygen and time taken for reaction to take place during combustion. Most effected on NOX emission by using of soybean, jojoba curcas, chicken fats, grease oil and alcohol (butanol) biodiesel in a diesel engine. 5.1.2 Particulate matter emission The PM emission shows reduction in biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel which may be due tohigher percentage of oxygen content and better oxidationof air and fuel [11]. The main factor of PM emission is improper fuel burning within the combustion chamber in the fuel-rich sections. The complete combustion leads to production of lower PM, due to higher oxygen percentage within the biodiesel. The advanced injection timing lead to higher combustion temperature and help in reduction of PM emission [25]. The PM emission reduction factors includes higher oxygen content, flame temperature, air-fuel mixing rate, load, etc. [14]. The PM and NOX emission reduces with increase in surface tension of fuel, while improving combustion process [54]. The PM emission at different engine load for the different categories of biodiesel (such as edible and non-edible, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) with diesel are shown in Fig. 6 (a–e). Almostall the tested biodiesel in the numerical method predicts that PM emission computed was lower than diesel fuel at CR17.5. The PM was found (edible vegetable oil) to be 0.0111 g/kWh, 0.0129 g/kWh, 0.017 g/kWh, 0.0105 g/kWh and 0.056 g/kWh for coconut, palm, rapeseed, soybean and sunflower; (non- edible vegetable oil) 0.0045 g/kWh, 0.0053 g/kWh, 0.00534 g/kWh, 0.00845 g/kWh and 0.00293 g/kWh for cotton seed, jatropha jojoba curcas, karanja and microalgae; (waste animal fats oil) 0.0049 g/kWh, 0.0022 g/kWh, 0.0096 g/kWh, 0.0013 g/kWh, 0.0012 g/kWh and 0.0098 g/kWh for chicken fats, beef oil, fish oil, lard oil, poultry oil, and veal oil; (waste oil biodiesel) 0.023 g/kWh, 0.0163 g/kWh and 0.0147 g/kWh for grease oil, waste cooking oil and waste frying oil; (alcohol) 10.5 g/kWh, 9.19 g/kWh, 15.5 g/kWh, 0.0034 g/kWh, 1.68 g/kWh and for butanol, ethanol, methanol, pentanol, propanol and 0.0193 g/kWh for diesel; with constant speed, CR, injection timing and fuel injection pressure of 220 bar. It can observed from the graph that PM emission decreases with increases in engine load. The fraction of specific PM emission in exhaust gas is lowered by42.0% for coconut oil biodiesel (edible vegetable oil), 84.8% for microalgae biodiesel (non- edible vegetable oil), and 93.7% for poultry oil biodiesel (waste animal fats oil), 23.8% waste frying oil biodiesel (waste oil) and 82.3% for pentanol biodiesel (alcohol); as compared to diesel. The PM emission reduction with increasing load of engine has been calculated for all the tested fuels. Some alcohol biodiesel give negative effect on PM emission which is clear from test alcohol in present study. Coconut oil, microalgae, poultry oil, frying oil and pentanol has great effect on PM emission as compared to other biodiesel. 5.1.3 Smoke emission The smoke emission measured in BSN are typically caused by an inadequate supply of air during combustion phaseduring engine acceleration and lower temperatures of combustion zone. Stable complete combustion shows reduction in soot formation emission due to oxygen content in combustion phase. Higher fuel injection pressure leds to less smoke emission due to introduction of small particles of fuel into combustion chamber and better air-fuel rate [9,58]. Smoke emission for KME – 50% and diesel – 50% and shows 21.4% reduction for a coated engine than that in uncoated engine [57]. The smoke emission at different engine load for the different categories of biodiesel (such as edible and non-edible, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) with diesel are shown in Fig. 7 (a–e). All most tested biodiesel fuel in the numerical study predicts that smoke emission computed was lower than diesel fuel at CR17.5. The smoke emission was found (for edible vegetable oil) to be 0.0134 BSN, 0.0148 BSN, 0.0105 BSN, 0.0122 BSN and 0.0101 BSN for coconut, palm, rapeseed, soybean and sunflower; (non- edible vegetable oil) 0.0663 BSN, 0.0754 BSN, 0.0532 BSN, 0.0107 BSN and 0.0304 BSN for cotton seed, jatropha, jojoba curcas, karanja and microalgae; (waste animal fats oil) 0.0459 BSN, 0.0257 BSN, 0.0126 BSN, 0.0149 BSN, 0.0144 BSN and 0.0128 BSN for chicken fats, beef oil, fish oil, lard oil, poultry oil, and veal oil; (waste oil) 0.0247 BSN, 0.0183 BSN and 0.0177 BSN for grease oil, waste cooking oil and waste frying oil; (alcohol) biodiesel of 7.9 BSN, 8.0 BSN, 8.2 BSN, 0.034 BSN and 4.25 BSN for butanol, ethanol, methanol, pentanol, propanol and 0.163 BSN for diesel; with constant speed, CR, injection timing and fuel injection pressure of 220 bar. It can observe from the graph that smoke emission decreases with increase in engine load. The fraction of specific smoke emission in exhaust gas is lowered by 93.8.0% for sunflower oil biodiesel (edible vegetable oil), 93.4% for karanja biodiesel (non- edible vegetable oil), 92.2% for fish oil biodiesel (waste animal fats oil), 89.1% waste frying oil biodiesel (waste oil) and 79.2% for pentanol biodiesel (alcohol); as compared to diesel. The smoke emission reduces with increases in loading of engine for edible & non-edible vegetable oil, waste animal fats and waste oil tested fuel but emission for alcohol increases (propanol decreased) in the present study. The smoke emission decreased with higher content of oxygen in the fuel, contributing to complete combustion of the fuel even in rich zones and sunflower, karanja, fish oil, frying oil and pentanol biodiesel great impact on smoke emission as compared to regular diesel fuel. 5.1.4 Summary of emission (PM and NOX) The summary of emission (SE) at different engine load for the different categories of biodiesel (such as edible and non-edible, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) with diesel are shown in Fig. 8 (a–e). All the tested biodiesel in the numerical approach predicts lower SEas compared to diesel fuel at CR17.5. In the full loading of the engine, the SE was found (for edible vegetable oil) to be of 3.46, 3.29, 3.67, 3.19 and 3.61for coconut, palm, rapeseed, soybean and sunflower; (non- edible vegetable oil) 6.6, 3.78, 2.80, 3.55 and 3.16 for cotton seed, jatropha, jojoba curcas, karanja and microalgae; (waste animal fats oil) 2.66, 3.43, 2.81, 3.71, 3.68 and 1.88 for chicken fats, beef oil, fish oil, lard oil, poultry oil, and veal oil; (waste oil) 3.22, 3.33 and 3.53 for grease oil, waste cooking oil and waste frying oil; (alcohol) 35.4, 31.0, 54.6, 2.07 and 6.66 for butanol, ethanol, methanol, propanol, pentanol and 3.32 for diesel; with constant speed, CR, injection timing and fuel injection pressure of 220 bar. It can observed from the graph that SE decreases with increase in engine load but alcohol increased SE (only propanol decreases). The total summary of emission in exhaust gas is lowered by 3.92% for soybean oil biodiesel (edible vegetable oil), 15.66% for jojoba curcas biodiesel (non- edible vegetable oil), 43.3% for veal oil biodiesel (waste animal fats oil), 3.0% waste grease oil biodiesel (waste oil) and 37.65% for propanol biodiesel (alcohol); as compared to diesel. The SE reduced with increase in loading of engine foredible and non-edible vegetable oil, waste animal fats and waste oil fuel but alcohol unevenlyincreases or decreased (only propanol show proper manner decreased) in the present study."
11,Conclusion,"The multi-zone fuel spray combustion model developed for diesel engines running on different categories of biodiesel (such as edible and non-edible, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) with diesel fuel. The working process of engines operating on different engine load (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) with twenty-four different bio-fuels has been described. The numerical simulation of the single cylinder, four stroke, diesel engine with a constant cyclic fuel injection, injection timing, engine speed and fuel injection pressure running on different alternative fuels were undertaken for this study. Table 11 summarizes the numerical values of emission of single cylinder diesel engine for different biodiesel. The emission was numerically investigated and conclusions can be drawn from presentnumerical study. • Replacement of fossil fuel by soybean, palm, jojoba curcas, microalgae, chicken and beef fats, grease and cooking oil and pentanol, which strongly affects emission production within combustion chamber in diesel engine. • The lowest level of NOX pollutant emission for soybean (edible), jojoba curcas (non-edible), chicken fats (animal fats), grease oil (waste oil), butanol (alcohol) is decreased by 3050 ppm, 3003 ppm, 2680 ppm, 3280 ppm, 212 ppm respectively. • The PM pollutant emission is reduced for soybean (edible) by 0.0105 g/kWh, microalgae (non-edible) by 0.0029 g/kWh, poultry oil (animal fats) by 0.0012 g/kWh, frying oil (waste oil) by 0.0147 g/kWh, pentanol (alcohol) by 0.01 g/kWh. • Smoke pollutant emission is found to be least in sunflower (edible) by 0.0101 BSN, karanja oil (non-edible) by 0.0107 BSN, fish oil (animal fats) by 0.0126 BSN, frying oil (waste oil) by 0.0177 BSN, pentanol (alcohol) by 0.034 BSN. • It was found by the summary of emission that there reduction for soybean (edible), jojoba curcas (non-edible), veal oil (animal fats), grease oil (waste oil), pentanol (alcohol) by 3.19, 2.80, 1.88, 3.22, 2.07 respectively. It can be concludedby emission resultsthat, under the unvarying operating conditions for this numerical simulation, five different categories of biodiesel (such as edible and non-edible, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol) has been tested for producing power for IC engines and produces lower NOX, PM and smoke emission, which has been elaborated in Table 12 , as compared to regular diesel fuel."
