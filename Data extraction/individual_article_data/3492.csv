0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted much attention as a promising energy carrier due to its clean, renewable, and non-polluting nature [1–5]. Therefore, much attention has been paid on the hydrogen production in the petrochemical and electrical device industries [6,7]. Various reforming processes such as steam reforming [8–11], partial oxidation [12–14], auto-thermal reforming [15–17], and dry reforming [18,19] have been investigated for converting hydrocarbons or alcohols into hydrogen. Among these reforming reactions, steam reforming has been recognized as the most feasible process for production of hydrogen from methane. Liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is abundant and mainly composed of methane, can serve as an alternate source for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. LNG infrastructure in modern cities may become more widespread in the future, which will make LNG well suited as a hydrogen source for residential and on-board reformers in fuel cell applications. Nickel-based catalyst has been considered as the most feasible catalyst for steam reforming reactions due to its high intrinsic activity and low price [20,21]. Conventional steam reforming reaction has been carried out at high reaction temperature ( > 800 °C), high reaction pressure ( > 20 bar), and high steam to carbon ratio (steam/carbon > 2) in order to achieve a maximum catalytic performance of nickel-based catalyst [21–24]. However, such severe reaction conditions are not favorable for on-site hydrogen production due to safety problems. Therefore, developing an efficient steam reforming catalyst with high catalytic activity and durability at moderate reaction conditions is of great importance. Textural modification of nickel-based catalysts has been extensively studied to achieve high catalytic performance in the reforming reactions [25–27]. In particular, it has been reported that well-developed mesoporous structure of Ni–Al2O3 catalyst not only enhanced the dispersion of active nickel site on the alumina support, but also facilitated the heat/mass transfer over the catalyst, resulting in a high catalytic performance [27–31]. Thus, mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts have received much attention for improving both catalytic activity and stability in the reforming reactions. Addition of second metal such as Ca [32], Mo [33], and Mg [34] to the nickel–alumina catalyst has also been attempted to improve the catalytic activity and stability of nickel-based catalyst. When large amount of second metal was added into nickel-based catalyst, however, decrease of catalytic reforming activity was inevitable due to the blocking of active sites [33,34]. Recently, it has been reported that lanthanum effectively enhanced the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst compared to other second metals [35]. Therefore, a systematic investigation on finding optimum lanthanum addition to Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst for hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG would be worthwhile. In this work, a series of mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts ((40-x)NixLa) with different lanthanum content (x) were prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. The effect of lanthanum content on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of mesoporous (40-x)NixLa catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts A series of mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 catalysts with different lanthanum content (x) were prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method, according to the similar methods reported in literatures [28,31,35]. A known amount of aluminum precursor (aluminum sec-butoxide, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol at 80 °C with vigorous stirring. Small amounts of distilled water and nitric acid, which had been diluted with ethanol, were slowly added into the solution of aluminum precursor for partial hydrolysis of aluminum precursor. After maintaining the resulting solution at 80 °C for a few minutes, a clear sol was obtained. The sol was cooled to 60 °C. Known amounts of nickel precursor (nickel acetate tetrahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) and lanthanum precursor (lanthanum acetate hydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) were then simultaneously added into the sol to obtain a nickel–lanthanum–alumina composite sol. After cooling the nickel–lanthanum–alumina composite sol to room temperature, a monolithic gel was obtained by adding an appropriate amount of water diluted with ethanol into the sol. The gel was aged for 7 days, and then it was dried at 50 °C and 170 atm for 24 h in a stream of supercritical CO2. The resulting powder was finally calcined at 700 °C for 5 h to yield the mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst. The prepared Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts were denoted as (40-x)NixLa (x = 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12), where x represents lanthanum content (wt%) in the catalysts. Total metal content in the (40-x)NixLa catalysts was fixed at 40 wt%. For example, 36Ni4La denotes a Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst containing 36 wt% nickel and 4 wt% lanthanum."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Textural properties of the catalysts were examined using an ASAP-2010 (Micromeritics) instrument. Chemical compositions of the catalysts were determined by ICP-AES (ICPS-1000IV, Shimadzu) analyses. Crystalline phases of the catalysts were investigated by XRD (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) measurements using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. In order to examine the interaction between nickel species and alumina, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (2 ml/min) and N2 (20 ml/min) was used for 50 mg of catalyst sample. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure the nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter of the catalysts. Prior to the chemisorption measurements, 50 mg of each catalyst was reduced with a mixed stream of hydrogen (2.5 ml/min) and argon (47.5 ml/min) at 700 °C for 3 h, and subsequently, it was purged with pure argon (50 ml/min) for 15 min at 700 °C. The sample was then cooled to 50 °C under a flow of argon (50 ml/min). The amount of hydrogen uptake was measured by periodically injecting diluted hydrogen (5% hydrogen and 95% argon) into the reduced catalyst using an on-line sampling valve. Nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom. To examine the nickel dispersion in the reduced catalysts and to see the carbon deposition and nickel sintering on the used catalysts, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (JEM-2100, Jeol) were conducted. The amount of carbon deposition in the used catalysts was quantitatively determined by CHNS elemental analyses (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG,"2.3 Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG LNG used in this work was simulated LNG composed of methane (92.0 vol%) and ethane (8.0 vol%). Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (100 mg) was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (3 ml/min) and N2 (30 ml/min) at 700 °C for 3 h. Feed composition was fixed at CH4:C2H6:H2O:N2 = 4.6:0.4:10:30. Total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was maintained at 27,000 ml/h⋅g. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). LNG conversion and hydrogen yield were calculated according to the following equations. (1) LNG conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out F CH 4 , in + F C 2 H 6 , in ) × 100 (2) Hydrogen yield ( % ) = F H 2 , out 2 × F CH 4 , in + 3 × F C 2 H 6 , in × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural properties of Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.1 Textural properties of Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Textural properties of (40-x)NixLa (x = 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . Actual nickel and lanthanum contents in the (40-x)NixLa catalysts were similar to the designed values. All the (40-x)NixLa catalysts showed high surface area ( > 256 m2/g), large pore volume ( > 1.41 cm3/g), and large average pore diameter ( > 15.9 nm). This indicates that mesoporous (40-x)NixLa catalysts were successfully prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method, as attempted in this work. However, no noticeable trends of textural properties with respect to lanthanum content were observed."
7,Crystalline structure of calcined Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.2 Crystalline structure of calcined Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of (40-x)NixLa (x = 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) catalysts calcined at 700 °C. For comparison, XRD pattern of bare alumina aerogel is also presented in Fig. 1. All the (40-x)NixLa catalysts showed three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.0°, 44.9°, and 65.5°, indicative of nickel aluminate phase (solid lines in Fig. 1). A close examination revealed that the diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 1) shifted to a lower diffraction angle, representing lattice expansion of γ-Al2O3 caused by the incorporation of Ni2+ ions [36,37]. This is because Ni2+ ions might intimately exist in the cationic deficient sites of γ-Al2O3, resulting in the formation of nickel aluminate phase in the (40-x)NixLa catalysts, in good agreement with the previous results [38,39]. The above results indicate that nickel species were finely dispersed in the (40-x)NixLa catalysts through the formation of nickel aluminate phase. It is known that lanthanum generally exist as a form of La2O3 on the alumina support, because it is difficult for La3+ ions to diffuse into the vacant sites of alumina due to their large ionic radius [40]. It is noteworthy that diffraction peaks of La2O3 were not detected in all the (40-x)NixLa catalysts, indicating that La2O3 was highly dispersed on the surface of (40-x)NixLa catalysts. Furthermore, intensities of diffraction peaks corresponding to nickel aluminate phase decreased with increasing lanthanum content. This indicates that finely dispersed La2O3 caused fine dispersion of nickel aluminate phase, in good agreement with the previous results [40,41]. It can be inferred that lanthanum added to nickel-alumina aerogel catalyst was responsible for fine dispersion of nickel aluminate phase of the catalyst by serving as a structural promoter."
8,Metal-support interaction in the Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.3 Metal-support interaction in the Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to examine the interaction between metal species and support in the (40-x)NixLa (x = 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) catalysts. It is known that TPR profiles of supported metal catalysts are related to the nature of metal–support interaction [42]. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of (40-x)NixLa catalysts calcined at 700 °C. All the catalysts showed single reduction band at around 700 °C. This indicates that nickel species strongly interacted with support through the formation of nickel aluminate phase [43,44], in good agreement with XRD result (Fig. 1). It is noticeable that the reduction peak temperature of (40-x)NixLa catalysts shifted to lower temperature with increasing lanthanum content. In other words, (40-x)NixLa catalysts became more reducible with increasing lanthanum content. It is known that interaction between nickel and alumina decreased when lanthanum was presented as a promoter, resulting in the formation of more reducible nickel aluminate phase [45]. This is because interaction between nickel and alumina was lowered due to the existence of surface La2O3 interacting with alumina support. The decrease of absolute amount of nickel with increasing lanthanum content in the (40-x)NixLa catalysts was also responsible for the decreased interaction between nickel and alumina support."
9,"Nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter in the reduced Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts","3.4 Nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter in the reduced Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of (40-x)NixLa (x = 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) catalysts reduced at 700 °C. It is interesting to note that the diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 3) moved back to the original diffraction angle in all the reduced (40-x)NixLa catalysts when compared to the diffraction peak in the calcined catalysts (Fig. 1). In addition, all the reduced catalysts showed diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic nickel (solid lines in Fig. 3). This indicates that nickel aluminate phase in all the (40-x)NixLa catalysts was completely reduced into metallic nickel during the reduction process employed in this work. However, no diffraction peaks of metallic lanthanum were observed due to its fine dispersion, as also revealed in Figs. 1 and 2. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted in order to determine the nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter in the reduced (40-x)NixLa catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption results for reduced (40-x)NixLa catalysts are listed in Table 2 . The amount of hydrogen uptake decreased with increasing lanthanum content and with decreasing nickel content in the (40-x)NixLa catalysts. As a consequence, nickel surface area of reduced (40-x)NixLa catalysts decreased with increasing lanthanum content. Nickel dispersion of the catalysts increased with increasing lanthanum content up to 4 wt%, but decreased after this point with increasing lanthanum content. This volcano-shaped trend of nickel dispersion with respect to lanthanum content might be due to the change of absolute amount of nickel and lanthanum. Active nickel species on the catalyst with high nickel content might be poorly dispersed because excess amount of nickel was aggregated. Nickel species might be well dispersed in the alumina support with increasing lanthanum content. It is known that a certain amount of lanthanum facilitates the formation of small nickel species during the reduction step [46]. This means that lanthanum located on the catalyst surface serves as a “spacer” by preventing the nickel species from forming a large particle and by causing a strain in the nickel lattice [46]. In case of (40-x)NixLa catalysts with lanthanum content higher than 4 wt%, however, nickel species became unfavorable for adsorbing hydrogen. Although it was revealed that addition of lanthanum was effective for dispersion and reducibility of nickel aluminate phase (Figs. 1 and 2), addition of large amount of lanthanum was unfavorable for nickel dispersion during the reduction process. This is because large amount of lanthanum atoms located on the surface of alumina support was known to cover the reduced active sites, by acting as a poison for nickel [45,47,48]. Therefore, the number of surface active sites would decrease by the blocking of large amount of lanthanum. It was found that 36Ni4La catalyst retained the highest nickel dispersion due to the effective promotion by optimum lanthanum addition, resulting in the smallest average nickel diameter. TEM images of the reduced (40-x)NixLa catalysts showed the same result. 36Ni4La catalyst retained small nickel particles without distinct agglomerates, representing fine dispersion of metallic nickel (Fig. 4 (b)). However, some large aggregates were formed due to poor dispersion of metallic nickel in both 40Ni0La (Fig. 4(a)) and 28Ni12La (Fig. 4(c)) catalysts. From this observation, it can be inferred that 36Ni4La catalyst retained strong resistance toward sintering during the reduction process."
10,Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG over Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.5 Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG over Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts LNG conversions and hydrogen yields with time on stream in the steam reforming of LNG over 40Ni0La, 36Ni4La, and 28Ni12La catalysts at 600 °C are presented in Fig. 5 . All the catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the reaction. (40-x)NixLa (x = 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10) catalysts also showed a stable catalytic performance during the reaction, although they are not shown here. High surface area, large pore volume, and well-developed mesoporosity might play an important role in facilitating internal mass transfer of reactant and product in the steam reforming reaction. Highly dispersed metallic nickel species reduced from nickel aluminate phase in the (40-x)NixLa catalysts were also responsible for stable catalytic performance of (40-x)NixLa catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen yields over (40-x)NixLa catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG, plotted as a function of lanthanum content. Both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield showed volcano-shaped curves with respect to lanthanum content, and they were decreased in the order of 36Ni4La > 37Ni3La > 34Ni6La > 32Ni8La > 39Ni1La > 30Ni10La > 40Ni0La > 28Ni12La. Among the catalysts tested, 36Ni4La catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen yield. Correlations between average nickel diameter and catalytic performance of (40-x)NixLa catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG are presented in Fig. 7 . It is noticeable that both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield increased with decreasing average nickel diameter. This indicates that average nickel diameter played an important role in determining the catalytic performance of (40-x)NixLa catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, 36Ni4La catalyst with the smallest average nickel diameter exhibited the best catalytic performance. According to kinetic studies, steam reforming of methane over nickel-based catalysts is related to some adsorption and dissociation mechanisms [49]. It is generally accepted that dehydrogenative adsorption of methane (equation (3)) takes place during the steam reforming reaction, and this step is known as the rate-determining step for the steam reforming reaction [50]. (3) CH 4 + xNi ∗ ↔ CH x – Ni ∗ + ( 2 − 0 . 5 x ) H 2 It has been reported that reactants such as methane are more strongly adsorbed on step sites which have lower activation energies than close packed nickel surfaces. Step sites have fewer neighboring nickel atoms than packed nickel surfaces, resulting in the upshift of d-band center of nickel atoms and stronger interaction between reactants and active sites [51]. Considering this electronic factor of step sites, it is important to make more step sites on the surface of catalyst. Addition of some amount of lanthanum to Ni–Al2O3 catalyst has an effect of increasing amount of step sites, because lanthanum located on the surface of Ni–Al2O3 catalyst makes it difficult for nickel atoms to be clustered. The result that nickel dispersion decreased with increasing lanthanum content at lanthanum loading higher than 4 wt% can also be understood by the fact that excess amount of lanthanum cover the step sites. Therefore, optimum lanthanum content is required for high nickel dispersion, small average nickel diameter, and high catalytic performance of Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst in the steam reforming reaction."
11,Characterization of used nickel–lanthanum–alumina catalysts,"3.6 Characterization of used nickel–lanthanum–alumina catalysts Fig. 8 shows the TEM images of 40Ni0La, 36Ni4La, and 28Ni12La catalysts obtained after a 1000 min-reaction. Compared to the reduced 40Ni0La (Fig. 4(a)) and 28Ni12La (Fig. 4(c)) catalysts, large agglomerates of nickel particles were observed in the used 40Ni0La (Fig. 8(a)) and 28Ni12La (Fig. 8(c)) catalysts. Large metallic nickel particles were susceptible to aggregation, resulting in significant nickel sintering during the steam reforming reaction. On the other hand, no significant morphological change was observed in the 36Ni4La catalyst before (Fig. 4(b)) and after (Fig. 8(b)) the reaction. This means that small nickel particles of 36Ni4La catalyst were not sintered during the steam reforming reaction. Furthermore, it was observed that carbon tubes were formed on the surface of used 28Ni12La catalyst (Fig. 8(c)). This might be due to the fact that carbon deposition reaction requires a number of adjacent active nickel atoms compared to steam reforming reaction [52]. This implies that large nickel particles are vulnerable to carbon deposition compared to small nickel particles. The above results were further confirmed by measuring the amount of carbon deposition on the used (40-x)NixLa (x = 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) catalysts, as listed in Table 3 . The result shows that a catalyst with small average nickel diameter retains strong resistance toward carbon deposition. It is concluded that optimum lanthanum content was required for maximum hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG over mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst."
12,Conclusions,"A series of mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts ((40-x)NixLa) with different lanthanum content (x) were prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. The effect of lanthanum content on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of mesoporous (40-x)NixLa catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated. Physicochemical properties of (40-x)NixLa catalysts were strongly influenced by lanthanum content. Lanthanum added to Ni–Al2O3 catalyst caused fine dispersion of nickel aluminate phase by serving as a structural promoter. Reducibility of (40-x)NixLa catalysts was also influenced by lanthanum addition. Some amount of lanthanum was effective for fine dispersion of nickel species during the reduction process, but addition of large amount of lanthanum was unfavorable for nickel dispersion because reduced active sites were blocked. All the catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the steam reforming of LNG. Both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield showed volcano-shaped curves with respect to lanthanum content, and they were decreased in the order of 36Ni4La > 37Ni3La > 34Ni6La > 32Ni8La > 39Ni1La > 30Ni10La > 40Ni0La > 28Ni12La. Average nickel diameter played an important factor determining the catalytic performance of (40-x)NixLa catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, 36Ni4La catalyst with the smallest average nickel diameter showed the best catalytic performance and the strongest resistance toward carbon deposition and sintering. In conclusion, optimum lanthanum content was required for the best catalytic performance in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG over mesoporous Ni–La–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst."
