0,Introduction,"Nowadays, people are paying more attention to the development of new energy to alternatives traditional fossil fuels [1–3]. The new materials that make solar energy to conversion chemical energy are particularly eye-catching. The traditional semiconductor material TiO2 has been extensively studied by scientists [4–6], however, the low solar energy conversion limited its application range. Due to excellent catalyst properties, MoS2 has received much attentions [7–10]. MoS2 has a layered structure in which each layer of molybdenum atoms is sandwiched between sulfur atoms (S-Mo-S) through covalent bonds [11,12]. This special structure has significant advantages in applications such as catalysis [13–15], optoelectronics [16], energy storage devices [17], and lubricants [18]. In photocatalytic reactions, MoS2 is considered to be an effective cocatalyst to replace precious metals to improve the photocatalytic properties of other semiconductors [19–21]. Modification of MoS2 to expose more active sites and increase its carrier mobility has attracted the attention of more and more researchers [22–28]. The performance of MoS2 depends on its lattice structure and morphology [23,28]. A large number of research experiments on MoS2 defects have been conducted, demonstrating that defects can alter the charge transport properties and optical properties of materials [22,25,26,29]. The introduction of defects can change the local structure of MoS2 and form a unique chemical and electronic environment in MoS2 [30]. The introduction of these atomic defects plays an important role on the catalyst properties of MoS2 [31]. The impact of various defect types on the photoelectric properties of MoS2 are being studied in depth [32]. These research conclusions have very important guiding significance for improving material quality. Feng [33] used first-principles calculations to study the structure and photoelectric properties of single-layer MoS2 with Mo-vacancy. The introduction of Mo-vacancies improves the strength of the Mo-S bond. Tsai [34] demonstrates that active sites can be created on the base of 2H Phase MoS2 by generating sulfur vacancies. The uncoordinated Mo atoms in the S-vacancy MoS2 introduce a gap state, which facilitates hydrogen bonding. The concentration of the S-vacancy can be controlled by varying the applied desulfurization voltage. Therefore, the selection of suitable atomic defect control methods is an important part of the current research on photocatalytic material defects [35,36]. Based on the first-principles calculation of density functional theory (DFT); Guo [37] explored various defects of MoS2 to enhance the photo catalytic activity of TiO2/MoS2 composites. There are many articles on the preparation of S-vacancy MoS2 as a cocatalyst; however, there have been few reports on the preparation of Mo-vacancies MoS2 as a cocatalyst to enhance the PHP. In this study, MoS2 was treated with NaBH4 to prepare MoS2 with rich Mo-vacancies. The amount of Mo-vacancies was controlled by varying the addition of NaBH4. Mo-vacancy MoS2 as a cocatalyst can enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production. And a possible PHP mechanism of the MoS2/TiO2 composite was suggested."

Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), diethanolamine (C4H11NO2), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were purchased from McLean biochemical technology co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of Mo-vacancy MoS2,"2.2 Synthesis of Mo-vacancy MoS2 Original MoS2 was prepared according to the method of literature [31]. And 0.112 g of MoS2 was added to 10 mL of 20 M NaOH solution, and ultrasonic treatment was continued for 45 min to prepare solution A. The solution B was prepared by adding NaBH4 to 10 mL of 20 M NaOH solution and magnetically stirring at 50 °C for 30 min. The A solution was then added dropwise to the B solution for 60 min. The solution was poured into a Teflon-lined autoclave (30 mL) and kept at 150 °C for 10 h, and then the black powder was washed three times with 1 mM diluted hydrochloric acid and deionized water, respectively. Then, it was placed in a vacuum drying oven and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Samples treated by NaBH4 solution with different concentrations of 0, 0.023, 0.045, 0.09, 0.23 and 0.45 mol/L were labeled as MoS2-0, MoS2-0.023, MoS2-0.045, MoS2-0.09, MoS2-0.23, and MoS2-0.45, respectively."
4,Synthesis of MoS2/TiO2 composites,"2.3 Synthesis of MoS2/TiO2 composites The preparation details of MoS2/TiO2 composites can be obtained from the previous work [31]. Similarly, a series of MoS2 with Mo-vacancy and TiO2 composites were prepared by the same method."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The analysis of crystalline structure were detected by X-ray diffraction Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKa radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 401KV, 40 mA). Raman spectra were measured using a Reflex micro-Raman spectrometer (inVia) with a 532 nm laser source. The size and morphology of the final product were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JOEL, JSM-7500F). And GeminiSEM 500 was used to perform elemental distribution analysis on samples. Transmission electron microscope (TEM; Hitachi-9000) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was also used to record the electron micrographs of photocatalysts. The ultraviolet (UV)-visible (vis) absorption spectra were performed on spectrophotometer(SolidSpec-3700, Japan) using BaSO4 as the background. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Thermo-Fisher Escalab 250Xi) were recorded using Al Kα radiation. N2 adsorption-desorption data of the samples were obtained at 77 K using a JW-BK132F BET analyzer. And the pore size distribution was acquired from the N2-desorption branch using the BJH method. The transient photocurrent measurement uses the CHI660E (Chenhua, Shanghai) instrument as a standard three-electrode configuration. The catalyst was used as an anode, and the Pt foil was used as a cathode and Ag/AgCl was used as a reference electrode containing 1 M KOH solution. 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution (starting potential of ~−0.038 V) was used as a test solution."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of the sample was tested by a photocatalytic hydrogen production evaluation system (AuLight, Beijing, and CEL-SPH2N) at room temperature. The test methods of PHP and catalyst stability were referred to our previous work [31]."
7,Results and discussion,"The XRD pattern of synthesized MoS2 was shown in Fig. 1 (a), all the characteristic peaks prove that MoS2 phase (PDF No. 37-1492) [31,38,39]. Compared to MoS2, the degree of crystallization of MoS2-0.09 began to decrease. The most obvious finding of MoS2-0.45 is that the disappearance of each characteristic peak of MoS2 indicates that the crystal structure has been completely destroyed. The results (Fig. S1) show that NaBH4 treatment of MoS2 can gradually erode its crystal structure. The Raman spectroscopy was showed in Fig. 2 . The peaks at 406 and 377 cm−1 in MoS2 represent the vibration modes of A1g and E1 2g, respectively. Two peaks in MoS2-0.045 and MoS2-0.09 indicate that a small amount of NaBH4 treatment does not destroy the integrity of the MoS2 structure. The sheet structure of MoS2 remains intact in Figs. 3 (a, b) and S2(a, b). This is further confirmed by Fig. 3(d, e). However, as the concentration of NaBH4 increased, the vibration peaks of E1 2g and A1g of MoS2-0.23 and MoS2-0.45 weakened until disappeared, indicating that the structure of MoS2 has been completely destroyed. The same conclusion is demonstrated in Figs. 3(c, f) and S2(c, f). And by the additional Raman peaks 223, 345, 337, 490, 565, 730 cm−1 and the asymmetric vibration in the Mo4O11 [40], the symmetric vibration is consistent. The synthesis schematic diagram of Mo-vacancies MoS2 is shown in Fig. 3(g). NaBH4 reacts with MoS2, and Mo4+ is reduced to Mo3+ and precipitates, resulting in Mo-vacancies. Therefore, it is converted to MoS2+x after being treated with NaBH4. Excess NaBH4 destroys the structure of MoS2, and a large amount of Mo3+ forms molybdenum hydroxide under alkaline conditions. As the pH is lowered during pickling, the molybdenum hydroxide reacts with oxygen in the air to form Mo4O11. As shown in the reaction equations (1) and (2). (1) Mo3+ + 3OH− = Mo(OH)3 The reaction equation that occurs in contact with oxygen in the air: (2) 8Mo(OH)3 + 5O2 = 2Mo4O11 + 12H2O It indicates that the MoS2 nanostructure is converted to MoS2+x. This structure assures the stability of the MoS2 structure and produces a large amount of Mo-vacancies on the surface compared to the untreated MoS2 nanostructure. The UV–vis spectra of the MoS2/TiO2 were shown in Fig. 4 . Treatment of the Mo-vacancy MoS2 with NaBH4 effectively increases the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light of TiO2. Moreover, the light absorption range of the MoS2/TiO2 composite was shifted toward visible light. MoS2/TiO2 composite has a significant absorption enhancement effect at 725 nm, corresponding to its band gap width of 1.72 eV. At the same time, it was also proved that MoS2 in the composite material is a structure of a few sheets [41]. Moreover, MoS2-0.09/TiO2 composites have reached a band gap width of 2.8 eV. However, the absorption strength of the MoS2-0.23/TiO2 composites was weakened, indicating that the structural integrity of MoS2 was destroyed. This demonstrates that an appropriate amount of NaBH4 treated MoS2 can effectively enhance the light absorption range of TiO2. And since MoS2 after NaBH4 treatment has more surface vacancies, these Mo-vacancies serve as nucleation sites for TiO2 growth. It can effectively improve the strength between the MoS2/TiO2 composite interfaces, so that the photogenerated carriers can be effectively separated in the photocatalytic process. Furthermore, the positions of the valence band and the conduction band can calculate with empirical formulas [42,43]. As follow: E C B = X - E C - E g / 2 E V B = E C B + E g where EC is a constant relative to a standard hydrogen electrode, EC = 4.5 eV; Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor; X is the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of each atom in the semiconductor. According to the above formula, consult the relevant table to get the relevant data brought into the formula, and the conduction band and valence band value of sample can be calculated. ECB(MoS2-0.09/T) = −2.41, EVB(MoS2-0.09/T) = 0.39; ECB(MoS2/T) = -2.51, EVB(MoS2/T) = 0.49, obviously, compared with the original sample, the band gap of MoS2-0.09/T was reduced, which improves the utilization rate of photo-generated carriers and reduces the probability of photo-generated electrons and holes recombining, thereby improving the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production. The XPS results for C 1s, O 1s, S 2p, and Mo 3d (Fig. 5 ) showed that the composition and valence state have changed greatly after MoS2 treatment with different contents of NaBH4. Calibration was performed using the binding energy of the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV in Figs. 5(a) and S3). The O 1s can be deconvolved into three peaks (Fig. 5(b)) with peak positions of 531.4 eV and 532.4 eV. Corresponding to the oxygen molecules and water molecules adsorbed in MoS2, the peak value of 533.3 eV can be attributed to OMoO in molybdenum oxide [44,45]. The fitted peaks of untreated MoS2 at 228.7 eV and 231.9 eV represent the binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 in 1T-MoS2. 229.4 eV and 232.6 eV are considered to be 2H-MoS2 Mo3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks [34]. As shown in Fig. 5(c), there is a significant difference between MoS2-0.09 and MoS2. Both the 1T and 2H phases of the MoS2-0.09 peak shifted to the high energy direction by 0.4 eV which indicates a shift up in binding energy. The Mo-vacancy leads to a shift up in the binding energy of the remaining atoms (Mo and S) on the surface of MoS2 after NaBH4 treatment. In addition, the MoS2-0.09 showed three new peaks of 233.5, 235.4 and 236.6 eV, representing the formation of Mo5+ and Mo6+ [46]. A phenomenon similar to the Mo spectrum was also found from the S 2p spectrum of Fig. 5d, peak shifting and producing two new peaks of 163.5 and 164.7 eV. Represents the S atom exposed after the Mo-vacancy. This phenomenon is consistent with the Raman test results. In addition, the XPS measurement results also show that when the amount of NaBH4 continuously increases, the stoichiometric ratio of Mo:S in MoS2 gradually changes from 1:2 to 1:3 (as shown in Table 1 and Fig S4), revealing that MoS2 is treated after NaBH4. A large number of Mo-vacancies are generated. However, despite these Mo-vacancies, the Raman spectrum at MoS2-0.09 shows that the main features of the Raman peaks E1 2g and Alg are still sharp, indicating that MoS2 generally has high crystallinity but the NaBH4 treatment produces partial Mo-vacancies. To further confirm change of sample structure, physical property investigation on the pore structure and size distribution was conducted (Fig. 6 (a)). The results show that MoS2 treated with NaBH4 can effectively increase the specific surface area (Table 2 ). The untreated MoS2 specific surface area was only 8.5 m2/g. The specific surface area of the treated MoS2 increases with the concentration of NaBH4 increase. MoS2-0.09 reached a maximum specific surface area (167.0 m2/g). At the same time, the micropore volume and total pore volume also showed similar trends. MoS2-0.09 also has the largest micropore volume (12.4 × 10−3 cm3/g) and total pore volume (17.7 × 10−2 cm3/g). In addition, the pore size distribution curve of MoS2 in Fig. 6(b) also shows that the NaBH4 reduction treatment can make MoS2 have a rich microporous structure. This is advantageous for the progress of the catalytic reaction. However, as the NaBH4 concentration further increased, there was a heavy decrease in the specific surface area (99.6 m2/g), micropore volume (7.8 × 10−3 cm3/g) and total pore volume (13.0 × 10−2 cm3/g) for sample MoS2-0.23. This also demonstrates that excess NaBH4 destroys the integrity of the MoS2 structure. The NaBH4 treated MoS2/TiO2 composite was used as the photoelectrochemical property of the photoelectrode evaluation electrode. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the transient photocurrent response of the ITO electrode modified with MoS2/TiO2 and MoS2-0.09/TiO2 composites was recorded in several switching cycles under UV irradiation with a bias of −0.038 V. The MoS2-0.09/TiO2 sample showed a remarkable improvement in photocurrent density and showed the best performance, and the photocurrent density increased by 2.4 times compared with the original MoS2/TiO2 composite. It is proved that NaBH4 treatment can effectively improve the photocatalytic performance of MoS2. The PHP performance of MoS2/TiO2 composites was examined with a 300 W Xe lamp. As is shown in Fig. 7(b), pure TiO2 showed a low H2 evolution (176 μmol g−1 h−1), because of the rapid recombination of photogenerated carrier. However, the hydrogen evolution rate of MoS2/TiO2 composites was 798 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 4.5 times that of pure TiO2. The MoS2/TiO2 composite shows high hydrogen evolution effective, because the heterojunction was formed between TiO2 and MoS2, due to the improvement of separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs, improving the PHP efficiency. When MoS2-0 was loaded, the growth rate of H2 increased to 2460 μmol g−1 h−1. When the concentration of NaBH4 was 0.045 mol/L, the hydrogen evolution rate arrived at 4836 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 6.8 times than that of MoS2/TiO2 composite. Obviously, with the increase of NaBH4 concentration, the active site of MoS2 increased significantly, and the MoS2-0.09/TiO2 achieved the maximum H2 evolution efficiency (5424 μmol−1 h−1). When the amount of NaBH4 added continues to increase, there is a clear downward trend, and the efficiency of PHP is remarkably lowered. As shown in Fig. 7(c), the hydrogen production efficiency of MoS2/TiO2 composite only reduced 15% after the three times cycle test. It has been considered that the MoS2/TiO2 composite material has good stability. Furthermore, we compare the photocatalytic effect of this article with the reported work, as shown in Table 3 . Our experimental results showed that the photocatalytic activity of MoS2 is related to the number of Mo-vacancies. A suitable number of Mo-vacancies will cause a dangling bond on the surface of the MoS2 that is adjacent to the Mo-vacancies. Therefore, a large amount of unsaturated S atoms will be generated on the surface or edge of Mo-vacancy MoS2. The PHP mechanism of Mo-vacancy MoS2/TiO2 composites is shown in Fig. 8 . The abundant unsaturated S atoms in the Mo-vacancy MoS2 are easily combined with hydrogen ions in water to generate sulfur-hydrogen bonds, which reduces the PHP activation energy. Thereby, the photogenerated electrons are combined with H+ in the water to achieve the purpose of efficient PHP. MoS2 with suitable amount of Mo-vacancies can reduce the recombination of photogenerated carrier effectively and strengthen interface charge transfer. The active sites of MoS2 in the surface or edge can enrich electrons, which combine with H+ to form H2. Simultaneously, photogenerated holes was consumed the sacrificial reagent. Therefore, the TiO2/MoS2 with Mo-vacancies can boost the photocatalytic efficiency. On the contrary, excessive Mo-vacancies also cause the incomplete of the MoS2 structure and limit the transmission of photogenerated electrons, thus reducing the performance of PHP."
8,Conclusion,"In this paper, Mo-vacancy MoS2 with high catalytic effect was successfully prepared through NaBH4 treatment. The amount of Mo-vacancies was controlled by the addition of the concentration of NaBH4. The MoS2 surface and edges after processing produced a lot of Mo-vacancy defects, so more dangling bonds of unsaturated S atoms were exposed. These unbonded S atoms can act as adsorption sites for H+, greatly increasing the reaction site of MoS2. In the photocatalytic process, Mo-vacancy defects can generate localized charge enrichment, thereby achieving more efficient PHP efficiency of Mo-vacancy MoS2/TiO2 phtocatalyst. It can open a new doorway to develop functional two-dimensional layered materials."
