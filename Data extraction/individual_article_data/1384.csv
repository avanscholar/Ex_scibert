0,Introduction,"In recent years, environmental problems caused by pollution have occurred frequently, such as fires in Australia, anomalies in Antarctica, extreme weather, and sea-level rise, which have brought disasters to people all over the world [1,2]. Human health has been seriously affected by such a deteriorating ecological environment system-chain. Photocatalytic technology has some advantages of low energy consumption, low cost, low temperature, and profound reaction without secondary pollution [3,4]. The purpose of degrading pollutants is achieved by using sunlight to convert solar energy into chemical energy directly [5,6]. So it has become a kind of green ecological environment purification technology with broad application prospects. The core of the development of photocatalytic technology is the improvement of the properties of photocatalytic materials and the in-depth study of the mechanism. Bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) is a photocatalytic material as a simple Aurivillius Oxide [7,8] with excellent application potential because of the narrow band-gap, good photo-stability, photo corrosion resistance, non-toxicity [9–12]. It has a unique electronic structure that the conduction band comprises W-5d orbital and the valence band is formed by hybridising Bi-6s and O-2p orbital with strong interaction [13,14]. The orbital hybridisation makes the valence band more dispersed, which is beneficial to the movement of photogenerated holes in the valence band. Recent years, besides photocatalysis, it also presents activity as photopiezocatalyst and tribocatalyst. For example, researchers have taken advantage of Bi2WO6 with visible-light harvest and intrinsic ferroelectric properties. Coupling the synergistic effect of low-power (9 W) LED irradiation and ultrasonic vibration (120 W) in an ultrasonic cleaner, which showed a much more enhanced photopiezocatalysis performance for purification of organic compounds [56]. Meanwhile, Bi2WO6 can also be used as a friction catalyst to convert mechanical energy to chemical energy through friction,.which provides a green friction-catalysis strategy for oxidation purification of organic pollutants [57]. It can be seen that the excellent characteristics of Bi2WO6 enable it to have a very broad application field. However, there are still some critical challenges need to be solved urgently in the practical application of Bi2WO6 in photocatalysis. From the energy levels consideration, the valence band potential satisfies the requirement of strong oxidation ability of photogenerated holes. Nevertheless, the conduction band's electrochemical potential is more positive, which leads to a weaker reduction ability of the photogenerated electrons. The photocatalytic reduction ability could be affected, which brings it far from the practical application. The more positive the valence band's electrochemical potential, the stronger the photogenerated holes' oxidation ability will be. The more negative electrochemical potential of the conduction band, the stronger the photogenerated electrons' reduction ability will be. The potential of the conduction band determines the reduction property of photogenerated electrons. Due to the more positive conduction band potential, the photogenerated electrons' reduction capacity of Bi2WO6 is greatly limited [15,16]. At present, the use of rare earth element Ce to regulate the negative potential movement of Bi2WO6 conduction band has not been reported. Usually, the conduction band is made up of less electronegative metal atomic orbitals [17,18]. In order to regulate the potential of the conduction band, the cationic doping is needed to replace the W position in the bismuth tungstate [19,20]. Among all the periodic table elements, the rare earth element Ce is a metal element that ions have many unfilled orbitals and can lose or accommodate electrons or holes [21,22]. Therefore, it is suitable to be used as a doping ion to replace the W site in conduction band. Meanwhile, the Ce4+ and Ce3+ can be switched back and forth in the REDOX reaction [23–25], which plays the role of electron pickup. It is conducive to regulating the conduction band potential and help to promote the separation of photoelectric charge [26]. Additionally, the non-metallic N element as an anion was doped into the system to enhance the light absorption. The N impurity level makes the valence band more dispersed so that the photogenerated charge movement can be highly promoted. Based on the above considerations, firstly, the first-principles simulations based on DFT were used to calculate the energy band structure, density of electronic states, and charge density of the material, replacing the W/O atom lattice with Ce/N of Bi2WO6. Secondly, A series of Bi2WO6: xCe3+(x = 5 mol%, 10 mol%, 15 mol%, 20 mol%) and Bi2WO6: (20%Ce3+, yN3−) (y = 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%）samples doped of Ce/N ions with different concentrations were successfully prepared by a simple, economical and efficient preparation method，which was named BWO/BWCeO-1/BWCeO-2/BWCeO-3/BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-1/BWCeNO-2/BWCeNO-3/BWCeNO-4. The photocatalytic performance revealed that the as-prepared BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 presents enhanced photocatalytic degradation and H2 evolution performance. The experiments and characterisation analysis jointly revealed that the Ce/N successfully enters the bismuth tungstate's lattice to replace the W/O sites. The systematic electrochemical characterisation and other structural tests were carried out to fully explain the mechanism of photocatalytic activity enhancement in results and discussion."
1,Experimental,
2,Computational scheme,"2.1 Computational scheme The simulated doping system based on DFT was carried out by the Supercomputer Center of Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Research Institute. In order to facilitate the simulation, one cell was magnified 8 times. A Ce and N atoms are used to replace W and O atoms to simulate the doping system calculation. The calculations of the Bi2WO6, Bi16W7CeO48, and Bi16W7CeNO47 were performed using the Vienna plane-wave ab initio simulation package (VASP), realising the generalised gradient approximation of PBE (GGA-PBE). Using a kinetic energy cut-off of 420 eV for Bi2WO6, 440 eV for Bi16W7CeO48 and Bi16W7CeNO47 with a Γ-centred Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes of 8 × 8 × 3 and 6 × 3 × 2. The convergence tolerance of energy is 10−6 eV/atom for the Bi2WO6, Bi16W7CeO48, and Bi16W7CeNO47 systems."
3,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts All chemical reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and without further purification. The chemicals used in the experiment are bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O), cerous nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O), carbamide(CH4N2O), sodium hydroxide(NaOH), nitric acid(HNO3) and so on. A series of Bi2WO6: xCe3+(x = 5 mol%, 10 mol%, 15 mol%, 20 mol%）were prepared by hydrothermal method. The synthesis process of Bi2WO6: xCe3+goes through the following steps: Firstly, 2.037 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 70 mL deionized water, then four different contents of 0.658 g, 0.623 g, 0.589 g, 0.554 g Na2WO4·2H2O were added into the above solution under vigorous stirring respectively. Secondly, four different contents of 0.047 g, 0.093 g, 0.139 g, 0.187 g, (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) were added in the same solution. The mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature until the solution was completely dissolved. After that, NaOH solutions (10 mL, 2 M) were dripped slowly into the stirring mixture to adjust the solution system's pH value to 7. After 6 h stirring, the mixture was put in a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 18 h. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the precipitate was separated from the suspension by centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water, acetone, and absolute ethyl alcohol, respectively, followed by drying 60 °C overnight. For comparison, pure Bi2WO6 samples were also prepared using the same preparation method, which using 2.037 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.693 g Na2WO4·2H2O reagents for synthesis. The as-prepared Bi2WO6: xCe3+ samples with 5 mol%, 10 mol%, 15 mol%, 20 mol% concentrations were named as BWCeO-1, BWCeO-2, BWCeO-3, BWCeO-4, the pure Bi2WO6 sample was named BWO, respectively. A series of Bi2WO6: (20%Ce3+, yN3−) (y = 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%）samples named BWCeNO-1, BWCeNO-2, BWCeNO-3, BWCeNO-4 were prepared as follows: 2.037 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.554 g Na2WO4·2H2O and 0.187 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in 70 mL deionized water in sequence with constant magnetic stirring, then four different contents of 0.076 g, 0.151 g, 0.227 g, 0.303 g CH4N2O were added into the above solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature until the mixture solution was completely dissolved. The NaOH solutions (10 mL, 2 M) were dripped slowly into the stirring mixture to adjust the solution system's pH value to 7. After 6 h stirring, the mixture was put in a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 18 h. Cooling down to room temperature, the precipitate was separated from the suspension by centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water, acetone, and absolute ethylalcohol, respectively, followed by drying 60 °C overnight. In addition, further increase of Ce and N species doped Bi2WO6 samples was obtained by the same preparation method. The four samples of Bi2WO6: xCe3+(x = 25 mol%, 30 mol%) and Bi2WO6: (20%Ce3+, yN3−) (y = 50 mol%, 60 mol%）named BWCeO-5, BWCeO-6, BWCeNO-5, BWCeNO-6 were prepared to analysed."
4,Characterisation,"2.3 Characterisation The crystal structure and the lattice parameters of samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Discover, Bruker, Germany). The XRD patterns were collected using a D2 phaser (Brucker) diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å), a scanning angle 2θ = 10°~80°, and a step size of 0.01°. The morphology structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S4800, Rigaku), and the element constitution was detected by energy-disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The surface chemical compositions, elemental states, and valence band spectrum were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, America). The BET surface areas and pore diameter distribution of as-prepared materials were measured using a surface area and porosity analyser (ASAP2460, Mack Instrument, America) by nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The optical properties were examined by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS, Agilent Cary 5000, America). The Motschottky, transient photocurrent, and AC impedance curves were measured by a CHI660 Electrochemical Workstation."
5,Photocatalytic degradation measurements,"2.4 Photocatalytic degradation measurements Photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples were evaluated by the degradation of 10 mg·L−1 Rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution. 1000 W xenon lamp irradiation was used as the visible-light irradiation. 0.045 g of as-prepared samples were added into 45 mL 10 mg/L RhB solution. The loading amount of catalysts was 1 g·L−1. The photochemical reactor with an 8-sites disc-reactor can simultaneously hold 8 quartz tubes with a 1000 W tubular Xe lamp in the centre. The distance between Xe lamp and reaction solutions (quartz tubes) is 10 cm. Before illumination, the suspensions of RhB with catalysts were magnetically stirred in the dark for 20 min to ensure the establishment of an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between catalysts and RhB. Then, the solution was exposed to a 1000 W xenon lamp under magnetic stirring for a photodegradation reaction. 5 mL of the solution was collected by centrifugation every few minutes. The concentrations of the remnant RhB in the collected solution were monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Unico UV-2600) at 553 nm."
6,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.5 Photocatalytic H2 production Photocatalytic H2 production experiments were carried out in a photoreactor (Pyrex glass) connected to a closed-cycle gas circulation system with a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source. Typically, 50 mg of the photocatalyst was suspended in a mixed solution of 75 mL distilled water and 25 mL methanol. This suspension was bubbled by nitrogen for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen before photocatalytic reaction. Afterwards, the H2 production test was carried out on an online photocatalytic reaction system (Labsolar-6A) and analysed by gas chromatography (GC7890B, Agilent, America). The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment lasted for 4 h. Hydrogen production data were measured and recorded every 60 min. The first test point started at 8 min. Additionally, the control experiments of the methanol dosage on H2 production influence were tested with the sacrificial agent concentrations of 15 vol%, 20 vol% and 30 vol%, respectively."
7,Photo-electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photo-electrochemical measurements The photo-electrochemical measurements were measured by an electrochemical workstation(CHI 660) through a standard three-electrode model with saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, platinum filament as the counter electrode, and 4 cm2 area of 2.0 cm × 2.0 cm of FTO conductive glass coated with samples as the working electrode, respectively. The three-electrode system was performed in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution and exposed to the illumination of visible light provided by a 300 W Xe lamp. The working electrode’s detailed fabrication steps were as follows: 10 mg of as-prepared sample was weighed, then 1 mL isopropanol and a 0.5 mL naphthalene membrane solution were added. After ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h, the sample was uniformly coated on the conductive surface of FTO using a disposable dropper. Finally, drying at room temperature for 16 h, the electrochemical performance can be tested at night."
8,Results and discussion,
9,DFT simulated calculation,"3.1 DFT simulated calculation Before the experiment, a simulated calculation based on DFT was conducted. The density of electronic states and energy band structures of three different materials, including pure orthogonal bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6), Ce-doped Bi2WO6 system (Bi16W7CeO48) and Ce/N double doped Bi2WO6 system (Bi16W7CeNO47), were calculated using first-principles based on DFT. The electron structures of Ce-doped and Ce/N co-doped systems were simulated by VASP software. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The calculated results show that the bandgap of Bi2WO6 is 2.75 eV, while the bandgaps of Bi16W7CeO48 and Bi16W7CeNO47 with Ce and Ce/N doping is 2.65 eV and 2.35 eV, respectively. There are apparent impurity levels in the energy band structure diagram of the doping system derived from the Ce and N atoms that are doped in the matrix material, as shown in Fig. 1(b and c) [27,28]. The DOS was also used to calculate the densities of the three materials’ electronic states. The valence band (VB) edge of Bi2WO6 is formed by hybridising O 2p with Bi 6s and 6p orbitals, whereas the conduction band (CB) edge is dominated mainly by W 5d orbitals. For the Bi16W7CeO48, the VB edge is also formed by the hybridisation of O 2p with Bi 6s and 6p orbitals, but the CB-edge is contributed by Ce 4f and W 5d orbitals. The CB-edge of Bi16W7CeNO47 is also composed of Ce 4f and W 5d orbitals [29]. A difference in some impurity levels at the top of the VB edge was observed in Fig. 1c. That is due to the doping of the non-metallic N element."
10,Phase analysis,"3.2 Phase analysis The experiments and characterisation are conducted continuously based on the above-simulated calculation results. BWCeO-1, BWCeO-2, BWCeO-3 and BWCeO-4 were the names given to the as-prepared Bi2WO6:Ce3+ samples with Ce3+ concentrations of 5 mol%, 10 mol%, 15 mol% and 20 mol%. Additionally, a series of Bi2WO6: (Ce3+, yN3−) samples with 20 mol% Ce3+ and 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol% and 40 mol% N3- concentrations were named BWCeNO-1, BWCeNO-2, BWCeNO-3 and BWCeNO-4, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to determine the crystalline structures and phases of all samples. Strong XRD peaks of as-prepared samples, as shown in Figs. S1(a,b), indicated that the samples are highly crystallised. Without any impurity, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the orthorhombic structure of Bi2WO6 (JCPDS No. 79-2381). The intensity of the main diffraction peak of BWCeO-4 was weaker than that of other samples, indicating that a high level of Ce doping affects the crystallinity for the BWCeO-4 sample [30]. The marked characteristic peaks of Ce and N elements cannot be detected, indicating that the crystal structure and phase did not change in the above Ce and Ce/N doping ranges. However, an increase in the number of Ce and N species doped Bi2WO6 samples of Bi2WO6: xCe3+ (x = 25–30 mol%) and Bi2WO6: (20% Ce3+, yN3−) (y = 50 mol%, 60 mol%), which were named BWCeO-5, BWCeO-6, BWCeNO-5 and BWCeNO-6, were prepared for analysis. The diffraction peaks of BWO, BWCeNO-4 and BWCeO-4 samples can be well indexed to the orthorhombic structure of Bi2WO6 (JCPDS No. 79-2381), as shown in Fig. S1(c). As the concentration of Ce and N species increased, some impurity peaks are observed in BWCeO-5, BWCeO-6, BWCeNO-5 and BWCeNO-6 samples. After comparative analysis, the impurities were identified as Ce2O3 because W6+ and Ce3+ have cationic radii of 60 pm and 102 pm, respectively. Because of the large radius difference between these two cations, the Ce3+ doping concentration would be suppressed and limited to 20 mol%. Meanwhile, the high doping concentration of N results in the presence of impurities. Therefore, the photocatalytic performance and structural characteristics of the four samples BWCeO-5, BWCeO-6, BWCeNO-5 and BWCeNO-6 would not be discussed below."
11,Morphology characterisation,"3.3 Morphology characterisation The morphology of as-prepared samples was observed by SEM in Fig. 2. It was found that the morphology of samples has changed gradually with the increasing Ce and N concentration. The pure Bi2WO6 exhibits numerous two-dimensional irregular nanosheets with a thickness of 30–50 nm (Fig. 2a). Embedded Eds in Fig. 2a confirms that this sample is composed of Bi, W, and O elements. Remarkably, the morphology exhibits hierarchical three-dimensional flower-like microspheres with the average diameters of 1–1.2 µm (Fig. 2b–d) after doped with Ce. The morphology of particle size of hierarchical flower microspheres is more regular, uniform, and stacked together with the concentration of Ce increased, as shown in Fig. 2d. The corresponding Eds consists of Bi, W, Ce, and O elements which confirmed the Ce was successfully doped into the crystal structure of BWO. Fig. (2e,f) are the morphology structure with the Ce and N co-doping. It indicates the introduction of N has a significant influence on the morphology of the sample. Increasing of N would lead to the destroyed flower-like structures, and some aggregated clusters were found in the BWCeNO-3 sample (Fig. 2e). The multi-stage large pore and stacked structure are even more compared to the singly doping with Ce. The EDS diagram of Fig. 2f indicates that the corresponded sample contains the N element. The obtained hierarchical three-dimensional nanosheet of BWCeO and BWCeNO possess a special intimate interface and relatively large contact areas, producing plentiful high-speed charge transfer nanochannels. Thus the photogenerated charges could be firmly separated and accelerated to migrate. This structure could provides lots of active surface sites for the effective adsorption of pollution molecules, promoting photocatalytic efficiency."
12,Adsorption and pore distribution,"3.4 Adsorption and pore distribution Fig. 3 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution. According to the IUPAC classification, the isotherms of BWO, BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 show that all hysteresis loops are type IV [31]. The specific surface area of BWO is measured as 15.13 m2/g. After doping Ce/N in BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4, the BET-specific surface area is increased to 62.45 m2/g and 54.98 m2/g, respectively. With the introduction of doping ions, the change in BET-specific surface area is related to the variation in morphology, pore-volume, and pore size distribution. The BWCeO-4 has micropores (2–20 nm) and mesopores (20–50 nm), as shown in Fig. 3b. Following the doping with a suitable amount of N in the crystal lattice could result in many mesopores (30–50 nm) and macropores (50–100 nm). This result shows that the specific surface area increases as the average pore size decreases. Meanwhile, it was also suggested that the greater the number of micropores and mesoporous pores, the greater the adsorption capacity and active sites. It is beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic activity [32]."
13,Elemental compositions and chemical state,"3.5 Elemental compositions and chemical state The XPS was used to evaluate the elemental compositions and chemical states of as-prepared samples. Fig. 4a shows the complete survey spectrum of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 samples. The elements Bi, W, Ce, O, and N can be found in the as-prepared samples. This is also shown in Fig. 3. The two intense peaks (Fig. 4b) of BWCeO-4 at 158.2 eV and 163.6 eV can be assigned to the Bi 4f transition, which corresponds to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 [33], indicating that the bismuth species exists as Bi3+. The characteristics of the W6+ oxidation state in the BWCeO-4 phase are represented by two peaks (Fig. 4c) of BWCeO-4 located at 34.5 eV and 36.6 eV, which correspond to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 [34]. Four curves were fitted according to the raw intensity lines in Fig. 4d, and the binding energies were located at 881.5 eV and 884.9 eV, and 899.4 eV and 903.3 eV corresponding to Ce 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2 [35], which proved the existence of Ce3+ in cerium species. The N element in the BWCeNO-4 [36] (Fig. 4e) has one main peak located at 399.8 eV in the assigned N 1s spectrum. Compared to the BWCeO-4, the Bi 4f and W 4f of the BWCeNO-4′s peaks all show an evident shift toward high binding energy. After doping of N element, the electron cloud density was reduced due to the interaction between N and Bi, W on the surface of samples [37], so the binding ability between the nucleus and electrons was strengthened, and thus the binding energy will be increased. According to the DFT result, the XPS result is acceptable, confirming that the Ce, N has been successfully doped in BWO. The result met our expectations."
14,Valence band spectrum,"3.6 Valence band spectrum The oxidation capacity of photogenerated holes is closely related to the potential of the VB edge [38]. The XPS VB spectrum can be used to investigate the VB relative potentials of BWO, BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4, which are 2.86 eV for BWO, 2.62 eV for BWCeO-4 and 2.37 eV for BWCeNO-4 vs. Fermi energy level from Fig. S2. Thus, the VB edge potentials of BWO, BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 are 2.75 eV, 2.51 eV and 2.31 eV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively [54,55]. Based on their Eg values in Table S3, the CB potentials are calculated, which is 0.00 eV for BWO, −0.14 eV for BWCeO-4 and −0.04 eV for BWCeNO-4. The energy band potential adjustment diagram for the prepared samples is shown in Fig. 7. Under visible light irradiation, photogenerated holes with high oxidising capacity are more likely to be generated at a high potential than others [39]. The result indicates that the more positive VB potential of BWO and BWCeO-4 may result in a higher photooxidation capacity than that of BWCeNO-4. The photooxidation capacity is assumed to be in the following order: BWO>BWCeO-4>BWCeNO-4."
15,Optical properties,"3.7 Optical properties To reveal the influence of the as-prepared samples on the visible light absorption, the UV-Visible-Diffuse Reflectance absorption was characterised, as shown in Fig. 5a. It can be seen that the absorption band edge of BWO for visible light is approximately located at λ > 450 nm. However, all of the absorption curves showed apparent redshift phenomena after doping with Ce and N, indicating that absorption capacity of visible light becomes stronger after doping with Ce and N. The absorption band edge of BWCeO-4 is approximately located at λ > 560 nm. The absorption capacity is gradually enhanced with the increasing of N concentration. Mainly, the absorption band edge of BWCeNO-4 is approximately located at λ > 610 nm. Combined with the DFT simulated analysis mentioned above, it can be seen that the introduction of Ce/N doping will bring multiple impurity levels in the bandgap, the doping levels near the top of the valence band were contributed by N doping. The impurity levels make the valence band more dispersed, promoting the movement of photogenerated charge and enhancing the light absorption capacity of the samples. Moreover, the bandgap energy (Eg) of all as-prepared samples can be acquired from UV-Vis DRS results according to the following formula [40]: α h ν = Α ( h v − E g ) n / 2 Where α represents the absorption coefficient, h is Planck constant, v is the vibration frequency, A is the proportional constant, and Eg is the bandgap. n is equal to 4 and 1 for a direct and indirect optical transition type of semiconductors. Since BWO is a direct bandgap semiconductor, the value of n is 4. According to the formula, the bandgaps energy of BWO, BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 are 2.75 eV, 2.65 eV and 2.35 eV, respectively. The bandgap energy (Eg) of all as-prepared samples are listed detailed in Table S3. It also can be seen in the Eg column data in Table S3 that the bandgap energy value decreases gradually with the doping concentration of Ce/N introduced."
16,Mott-Schottky and electrochemical response,"3.8 Mott-Schottky and electrochemical response The Mott-Schottky plots were conducted electrochemically to further understand the effect of Ce and N doping on the band structure of bismuth tungstate material. As shown in Fig. 6, the Mott–Schottky plots of all samples show a positive slope in the linear region, indicating that both the as-prepared samples are n-type semiconductors [41]. Make a tangent line along the straight part of the Mott–Schottky plots. The x-intercept of the tangent line is the flat band potential EFB (vs. Hg/HgCl2) of the sample [42]. The flat band potentials of BWO, BWCeO and BWCeNO were measured using the CHI660 impedance-potential pattern. Detailed data for each sample are listed in Table S3. The flat band potential obtained using the above method is the potential relative to the calomel electrode (EFB (vs. Hg/HgCl2), which should be converted into the RHE potential using the blow formula (EFB (vs. RHE)). According to the Nernst equation and Mulliken electronegativity theory formulas [43]: E R H E = E H g / H g C l 2 + 0.241 V + 0.0592 p H the calculated value of 0.0592 is derived from RT/NF, where R is the gas constant (8.3143 J. mol−1.k−1), T is the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant, N represents the number of electrons gained and lost in the electrode reaction and pH is the pH value of the electrolyte solution. Therefore, the pH value of 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solutions is 6.5 [44]. The initial voltage of the saturated calomel electrode at 23–28 ℃ temperature is 0.241 V. EFB (vs. Hg/HgCl2) is a set of 1/C2 values obtained vs. Hg/HgCl2. Therefore, the EFB (vs. RHE) value of each group of samples is also obtained by calculating a series of raw data and then making a tangent line that intersects the X-axis; the results are detailed in Table S3. For n-type semiconductors, the flat band potential can be assumed as the bottom of the CB energy [45]. According to the formulas, E C B = E V B − E g , the VB position EVB can be obtained."
17,Band potential adjustment,"3.9 Band potential adjustment Combined with the results of UV–vis absorption spectra, XPS valence band spectra and Mott-Schottky plots, the adjustment diagram of the energy band potential can be obtained from the above analysis results, as shown in Fig.7. The analysed calculated bandgaps of BWO, BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 are 2.75 eV, 2.65 eV and 2.35 eV. The bandgap value of BWCeO and BWCeNO with doping of Ce and Ce/N were reduced compared to the BWO sample. The CB potential and VB potential of BWO were located at 0.00 eV and 2.75 eV, respectively. The CB potential of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 with Ce and Ce/N doping were moved negatively compared to BWO, which were located at −0.14 eV and −0.04 eV. The value both passes the energy levels that produce H+/H2 and O2/·O2 −(vs. NHE) [46], respectively. This adjustment makes the photogenerated electrons becomes more reductive. There are some impurity levels at the top of the valence band in the doped system because of the introduction of Ce/N ions doped. The impurity level makes the valence band more dispersed, promoting the photogenerated charge movement and enhancing the light absorption capacity. This conclusion is in good agreement with the results of the DFT simulation."
18,Photocatalytic degradation performance,"3.10 Photocatalytic degradation performance Under visible light illumination, the photocatalytic degradation performance of as-prepared samples was investigated for the decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB); the results are shown in Fig. 8(a and c). The degradation efficiency of RhB can be calculated using the following formula: degradation efficiency = C/Co × 100%, where Co is the concentration of the original RhB solution before adsorption and C is the concentration of RhB solution after every few minutes of reaction. Before photo-reaction, the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between RhB and the sample surface was achieved in the dark by stirring for 20 min. Because of the differences in morphology structure, BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 possess higher adsorption ability than the other samples. Compared with other samples, their specific surface area was large, and the pore characteristics were complex and multilevel. The RhB was stable after 90 min of visible light irradiation without using any photocatalyst. In the presence of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4, photo-degradation rates were approximately 95.5% and 85%, respectively. However, the photo-degradation rate of BWO was poor at a specific time interval and with only 38% degraded in 90 min of photo-reaction. The improved photocatalytic degradation efficiency of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 is attributed to the negative shift regulation of CB potential with Ce doping. The introduction of the N impurity level into the bandgap disperses the VB, reducing the forbidden bandwidth. It benefits not only the movement of the photoelectric charge but also the enhancement of visible light absorption. The kinetics fitting curves were further studied to understand the photo-degradation rate, as shown in Fig. 8b and d. The photocatalytic degradation follows a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, which can be depicted as follows [47]. In ( C 0 / C ) = k K t = k a p p t where C0 is the initial concentration of RhB, C is the concentration at a specific time, k is the rate constant, K is the absorption coefficient, kapp is the apparent pseudo-first-order rate constant and t is the corresponding irradiation time during the degradation process. The detailed degradation efficiency, kapp, R2, and the kinetic equation were calculated and are listed in Table S4. All the linear correlation coefficient R2 was greater than 0.90, indicating that the photocatalytic degradation of RhB follows the first-order kinetics equation [48] and that the higher the rate constant, the better the photocatalytic performance. The recycling tests of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 were conducted five cyclic times, as shown in Fig. 8(e and f). The degradation efficiency of the test sample after five cycles was achieved at 82% and 74%, respectively. The results show that the two types of structures have a high photo-stability with a slight decrease in photocatalytic activity, which could be due to the loss of material powder during centrifugal separation and the gradual weakening of the material adsorption performance in the repeated use process. The absorption of the BWCeNO-4 sample with a degradation time extension is shown in Fig. 8g. As the irradiation time increase to 90 min, the intensity of the RhB absorption peak decreased with an obvious blue shift. The results show that the degradation of RhB molecules by prepared BWCeNO-4 follows the deethylation and oxidative reaction process. In the initial stage of the photocatalytic reaction, the deethylation reaction is mainly responsible for the wave-number deviation. The XRD was used to examine the phase structure (Fig. 8h) of the BWCeO-4 before and after five photocatalytic reaction cycles, and no phase changes or structural damage occurred. Simultaneously, other techniques such as SEM and BET in Fig. S3 confirmed the stability of BWCeO-4 after photocatalysis. Fig. S3(a) shows that the morphology after five photocatalytic reactions is similar to that shown in the initial SEM image, and it is still the staggered pore flower spherical structure. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiment in Fig. S3(b) shows that the hysteresis loop of the isotherm remains type IV after photocatalysis. The difference is that after photocatalysis, the adsorption capacity decreases slightly compared to the initial data. The specific surface area of BWCeO-4 is 56.12 m2/g after five cycles. The pore size distribution from Fig. S3 (c) shows that the pore volume also slightly decreased compared with the data before the reaction, but the pore size distribution trend remained unchanged. In conclusion, the BWCeO-4 still has good stability after photocatalysis. The mineralisation rate of the dye was tested additionally. The COD removal efficiency (mineralisation rate) of the samples was calculated as described in the following equation; COD removal % = C 0 − Ct C 0 × 100 % where C0 is the initial COD in ppm and Ct is COD in ppm at the time interval t. The mineralisation rate of RhB is evaluated as shown in Fig. S5. The samples were degraded in 150 min, with the COD removal rates of BWO, BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 reaching 48.2%, 86.5% and 77.6%, respectively. The result shows that the mineralisation rates of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 are significantly higher than that of BWO, which is consistent with the photocatalytic degradation results. The mineralisation rate was slightly lower than the overall photocatalytic degradation efficiency, implying that smaller organic molecules may still exist in the treated solution."
19,Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance,"3.11 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance To further inspect the photocatalytic activity of BWCeNO-4 and BWCeO-4, photocatalytic water splitting into H2 with methanol as a sacrificial agent was monitored. Fig. 9(a,b) show the hydrogen evolution as a function of the reaction duration, in which all plots show an approximately linear relationship. The hydrogen production after a 4 h reaction is summarised in Fig. 9c. Compared with the BWO, the photocatalytic H2 evolution of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 significantly enhanced. The H2 production is up to 16.89 mmol g−1 and 14.78 mmol g−1 after 4 h reaction time, which is approximately four and three times higher than BWO (4.54 mmol g−1). The cycle stability of hydrogen production of BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 was also tested, as shown in Fig. 9d. The BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4 still maintain good hydrogen production efficiency after five cycles of experiments, indicating that the as-prepared sample has good hydrogen production stability. This result demonstrates that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was also significantly promoted by doping with Ce and N. The reason may be either of these two conclusions: first, the absorption ability for visible light was enhanced by doping cation/anion. Second, the doping of Ce regulates the CB potential to shift negatively, improving the reductive ability of photogenerated electrons. After doping of Ce, the CB potential negatively moves to the top of the hydrogen generation potential. The reaction mechanism was shown in Fig. 10. Therefore, the aforementioned reasons have significantly increased the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution capacity of samples BWCeO-4 and BWCeNO-4. Additionally, control experiments of the effect of methanol dosage on H2 production were performed in Fig. S4. In hydrogen production tests, the amount of sacrificial agent used was increased by three concentrations, 15 vol%, 20 vol% and 30 vol%, respectively. The hydrogen production performance of BWCeNO-4 and BWCeO-4 samples were tested, while the other conditions remain constant, and the results are shown in Fig. S4. The hydrogen production performance of the two samples is improved when the sacrificial agent is 25 vol%, indicating that the sacrificial agent dosage with the best hydrogen evolution performance is still the concentration of 25 vol% methanol."
20,Transient photocurrent and EIS analysis,"3.12 Transient photocurrent and EIS analysis When the photocatalyst is irradiated by visible light, electron migration occurs on the material surface, forming a transient photocurrent. The photocurrent reflects the mobility of photogenerated electrons in the catalyst [49], as shown in Fig. 9e. It is demonstrated that the photocurrent of as-prepared BWCeNO-4 is the largest, followed by BWCeO-4, and the BWO possesses the lowest transient photocurrent. This corresponds to the results of RhB photo-degradation. Because of the multiple doping levels of BWCeNO-4 samples introduced at the top of the VB; the movement of photogenerated charge was promoted to enhance the photocatalytic degradation performance. The Nyquist spectrum of AC impedance, as shown in Fig. 9f, can reflect the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs. The EIS Nyquist spectrum’s arc radius reflects the separation rate of photogenerated electron and hole separation, as well as the reaction rate on the electrode surface [50]. The smaller the circular arc radius, the better the separation efficiency and rapid interface charge transfer on the photogenerated electron-hole surface. The photoelectron-hole separation efficiency can be directly judged by observing the circular arc radius, which provides a basis for revealing the photocatalytic degradation mechanism. The arc radius of the BWCeNO-4 and BWCeO-4 samples was smaller than that of the BWO sample, indicating that the separation rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was higher in BWCeNO-4 and BWCeO-4 samples. Simultaneously, the AC impedance values were calculated by ZSimDemo and embedded into the EIS Nyquist spectrum in Fig. 9f [51-53]. When the charge transfer resistance values of the samples are compared, the Rs/Rct values of BWCeNO-4 and BWCeO-4 samples are smaller than that of BWO, indicating that charge transfer occurs better in BWCeNO-4 and BWCeO-4 than in BWO. The charge transfer occurs faster on the surface, which is also one factor that promotes photocatalytic efficiency."
21,Photocatalytic reaction mechanism,"3.13 Photocatalytic reaction mechanism The enhanced photocatalytic performance and hydrogen evolution capacity can be explained by the possible photocatalytic mechanism in Fig. 10. After doping with Ce and Ce/N ion, the bandgap values are reduced to 2.65 eV and 2.35 eV, which significantly enhances the absorption of visible light that can be proved by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra in Fig. 5. Meanwhile, the introduction of impurity energy level at the top of the valence band promotes the rapid movement of photoelectric charge, which can be confirmed by the transient photocurrent curve in Fig. 9e. The specific surface area was increased (Fig. 3) with the change of morphological characteristics, which improves the adsorption capacity reflected in the dark stirring of photocatalytic degradation. The CB potential moves negatively to the top of H+/H2 and O2/·O2 −(vs. NHE) after doping Ce3+, which dramatically enhances the reduction property of photogenerated electrons that reflects in the band potential adjustment diagram in Fig. 7. The specific reactions of water decomposition to produce H2 and degrade pollutant are as follows: BWCeO − 4 / B W C e N O − 4 + h v → h + + e − h + + O H − / H 2 O → • O H + H + 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 • OH + p o l l u tan t ( R h B ) → C O 2 + H 2 O e − + O 2 → • O 2 − • O 2 − + p o l l u tan t → C O 2 + H 2 O"
