0,Introduction,"In recent years, biomaterials have become widely used to replace and restore the function of damaged or deteriorated tissues, to support healing, to improve function and to correct abnormalities (Nair and Laurencin, 2007). Metals, alloys and ceramics have been used very successful as biomaterials; however, in certain instances some shortcomings have emerged, including corrosion, allergic tissue reactions of metal ions, fabrication difficulties and low mechanical reliability of some ceramics (Ramakrishna et al., 2001). Composite biomaterials, based on polymers, provide an alternative that may overcome certain limitations of metal and ceramic based biomaterials. Composite biomaterials are multi-phased combinations of two or several biodegradable and biologically derived components (Williams, 1999), which acquire new distinctive properties that the individual components cannot achieve by themselves. Typically, a composite biomaterial consists of a matrix having one or more ‘fillers’ which can be made up of particles, sheets or fibres. Polymers are widely used as matrices for composites in various applications as they are available in a range of compositions and forms (solids, fibres, fabrics, films, and gels). Moreover, they can be fabricated easily and rapidly into complex shapes and structures. In the present study we have examined collagen-containing particles embedded in a polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol), matrix. PVA has been shown to be suitable for various biomedical applications (Kobayashi et al., 2001; Schmedlen et al., 2002; Alexy et al., 2003; Weis et al., 2004; Yi et al., 2006; Gupta et al., 2009; Sailaja et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011; Sionkowska, 2011; Peng and Shen, 2011; Peng et al., 2012), including as a base for composite biomaterials (Sionkowska, 2011). It can be readily modified to enhance the biological properties (Schmedlen et al., 2002; Sailaja et al., 2009), and soluble PVA arising from implants is readily cleared from the body through the kidneys (Jiang et al., 2010). PVA is also well suited for making composite materials, especially with biological polymers such as collagen and chitosan (Alexy et al., 2003; Yi et al., 2006; Sionkowska, 2011; Peng and Shen, 2011; Peng et al., 2012). Collagen for biomedical applications can be prepared in a variety of formats (Ramshaw et al., 1996). In some cases, the natural fibrous composition, such as found in skin or tendon, is maintained when the tissue is comminuted into a fibrous powder. In other cases, tissue is solubilised, typically through an enzyme treatment to produce a purified collagen solution (Miller and Rhodes, 1982). This solution can be manipulated so as to reform a fibrous network, although this network lacks the strength of the collagen fibres that have not been solubilised. In the present study, we have examined whether a further, different format collagen-based material is suitable as a readily made, cost effective composite material for biomedical applications, particularly for hard tissue repair. Thus, we have examined composites made with particles of naturally cross-linked collagen, obtained through demineralisation of bovine bone particles. For comparison we have used bone particles in an un-modified, mineralised form. Bone particles are readily available and can be readily demineralised if required, derived, for example, from human, porcine and bovine bone, and are in clinical use, for example in dental applications (Ramírez-Fernández et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2013; Ivanovic et al., 2014). Bone based material also represents a cost effective source of collagen, especially when compared to soluble collagen. Three size fractions of each type of particle were prepared and used to make composite membranes with up to 60% w/w particles. These membranes were examined by a number of methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology and distributions of particles, while FTIR was used to look for interactions between components. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine the glass transition, T g, and the melting temperature, T c, while mechanical testing looked at tensile strength, Young׳s modulus and axial strain. A preliminary examination of cell compatibility was examined using L-929 mouse lung fibroblasts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Collagen-containing particles,"2.1 Collagen-containing particles Bovine bone particles were obtained from Waitaki Biosciences (New Zealand). Bone particles, for direct use (NB), were separated into 20–70µm, 70–100µm and 100–150µm fractions using a Fritsch Analysette 3PRO sieve system (Oberstein, Germany). Production of demineralized bone (DB) particles was as previously described (Glattauer et al., 2010, 2011). Briefly, unfractionated bone particles (NB) as above were suspended in 0.6M HCl and stirred intermittently for 16h at 4°C. After settling, the acid was removed by decanting and particles then further extracted each day for 6 days using the same conditions, before being washed in several changes of H2O and freeze dried. The dried collagen-based particles were then fractionated into 20–70µm, 70–100µm and 100–150µm fractions by sieving, as above. Bead size distributions were verified by microscopy and image analysis (Glattauer et al., 2010, 2011)."
3,Preparation of the composite films,"2.2 Preparation of the composite films Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), 99+% hydrolyzed, with a molecular weight, Mw=89,000–98,000, was from SigmaAldrich. The PVA samples were dried at 80°C under vacuum for about 5h to remove moisture. The PVA composite membranes, containing NB or DB particles, were prepared using a solution of 1.0g PVA per 6.34mL distilled water, stirred continuously at 90°C for 1h. The PVA solution was cooled down to 20°C and a pre-weighed amount of collagen particles was added. The mixture was stirred overnight to obtain a highly dispersed PVA/collagen suspension. The suspension was evacuated to remove any entrapped air bubbles and then a calculated amount suspension was poured into rectangular glass plates with edging (5mm deep). In all samples, water was allowed to evaporate at room temperature (~20°C). The final thickness of the membranes was measured around 200±20µm. Both types of particle, NB and DB in each of the 3 size ranges (20–70µm, 70–100µm and 100–150µm) were used for composite membrane preparation."
4,Scanning electron microscopy,2.3 Scanning electron microscopy The morphology of the composite sheets was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Jeol Neoscope at an activation voltage of 10kV. The free surfaces were coated with thin layers of gold before the observation.
5,FTIR spectroscopy,"2.4 FTIR spectroscopy The FTIR spectra of all the samples were measured on a Bruker Vertex-70 FTIR spectrometer. The KBr disk method was adopted to conduct the FTIR experiments. The sample was mixed with KBr powder, grounded well and prepared to KBr disks. The disks were dried under vacuum in an oven at 100°C before the measurements. The spectra were recorded at the average of 32 scans in the standard wavenumber range of 400–4000cm−1 at a resolution of 4cm−1."
6,Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),"2.5 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) DSC experiments were carried out using a TA-DSC model Q200 instrument. The measurement was performed using 5–10mg of the sample under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas. The samples were first heated to 100°C and held at that temperature for 5minutes to remove the thermal history. Then the samples were cooled to −50°C at a rate of 20°C/min, held for 5minutes, and subsequently heated from 0 to 200°C at 20°C/min (second scan). Glass transition temperature (T g) values were taken as the midpoint of transition in the second scan of DSC thermograms."
7,Mechanical tests,"2.6 Mechanical tests The tensile behaviour of the materials was analysed using a Lloyd LR 30K testing machine in tensile mode with a 100N capacity load cell and with a gauge length of 5mm. The specimen was a thin rectangular strip (25×6×0.2mm3). The load–displacement curves of the samples were obtained at a strain rate of 1mm/min at 75% relative humidity and 20°C. The stress and strain values were obtained using the standard equations. The stress, strain and modulus values were evaluated from the elastic region and modulus values were calculated at no more than 40 % strain to deformation."
8,Cell culture,"2.7 Cell culture Cell adhesion on composite membranes was assessed using L929 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC-CCL-1, Rockville, MD), a highly adherent cell line. Prior to examination, the composite membranes were sterilised by 15kGy gamma irradiation. Cells were grown in MEM containing GlutaMax (Life Technologies), plus 10% v/v foetal bovine serum, 1% NEAA (Gibco) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco-Invitrogen) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells at 80 % confluency were harvested using TrypLE™ Express (Life Technologies) and washed twice with media. Subsequently, cells were seeded onto membranes using weighted stainless steel cell culture ‘fences’ (Aix Scientifics®, Germany)(Fischer et al., 1990) at 25,000 cells/cm2 on various composite materials in non-adherent, 24-well culture plates (Costar, Corning, USA) and cultured in the same medium. Cell adhesion was examined after 16h using bright-field optics and after calcein-AM staining (Molecular Probes) following the supplier׳s instructions, with fluorescence optics, and photographed using a Nikon TE2000-U microscope. The calcein-AM staining detects live cells."
9,Results and discussion,"Previously, composite materials including PVA based on soluble and fibrous collagens have been described (Sarti and Scandola, 1995; Sionkowska et al., 2009), but inclusion of collagen-containing particles provides a different approach. The new materials could be particularly useful for repair of hard tissues, with the presence of residual growth factors in the demineralised bone particles (Wildemann et al., 2007) assisting in the tissue repair."
10,Microscopy,"3.1 Microscopy The composite membranes all had good flexibility, and were translucent, with the opacity increasing with the amount of NB or DB particles that were incorporated as shown in Fig. 1. The particles seem well dispersed (Fig. 1), with increasing amounts leading to increased opacity. Those with a higher opacity have the advantage of being easier to see in a surgical application. The surface morphology of PVA/collagen composite membranes was observed using SEM ( Fig. 2). This showed the collagen particles, particularly at the surface of the PVA matrix. The collagen particles were well dispersed in PVA at all concentrations of particles and with all 3 particle size fractions for both the bone particles (ND) and the collagen-based, demineralised bone particles (DB) (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). It is possible that due to the weak interaction between collagen and PVA at the interface, the collagen particles form into small aggregates or individual particles and become well dispersed in the polymer matrix."
11,FTIR spectroscopy,"3.2 FTIR spectroscopy FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding interactions in PVA/collagen composite membranes. The FTIR spectra of the composites are given in Fig. 3. The broad band in the 3000–3700cm−1 region can be assigned to a wide distribution of the stretching vibration of free, self-associated and inter-associated hydroxyl groups of PVA and collagen. The self-associated hydroxyl stretching band of PVA can be observed at 3295cm−1 (Ramakrishna et al., 2001). The characteristic absorption bands of collagen were observed in composites containing both bone and demineralised collagen particles. The specific absorption peaks include 1639cm−1 (CO stretching) for amide I; 1547cm−1 (N−H bending) for amide II; 1239cm−1 for amide III; 3302cm−1 (O−H stretching); 2951cm−1 for aliphatic groups (−CH2 and −CH3); and 1451cm−1 for –COO−. The intermolecular interactions between PVA and collagen may occur by the formation of hydrogen bonds at the interface. This may be enhanced for the DB particles as the loss of mineral leads to a more porous collagen particle. The hydroxyproline residues in collagen and collagen peptides are involved in an extensive hydration shell (Bella et al., 1994, 1995) and provide potential hydrogen bonding sites, as well as the surface CO groups that are also available for making hydrogen bonds with −OH groups in PVA. To confirm the hydrogen-bonding interactions in the composites, the carbonyl stretching region, ranging from 1580 to 1700cm-1, of the membranes was examined ( Fig. 4). The FTIR spectra of membranes containing DB20–70µm collagen particles at various compositions are given in Fig. 4. The carbonyl bands of collagen can be observed at 1637cm-1 in the composites. A new band is formed at 1618cm-1 in composites containing higher amounts of collagen (DB50 and DB60wt%). This band is due to the vibration of the hydrogen-bonded collagen carbonyl groups at the PVA–collagen interface. It can be noticed that this hydrogen bonded carbonyl band is not obvious in composites containing low quantities of collagen. This can be attributed to the limited hydrogen bonding interaction between collagen carbonyl groups and PVA hydroxyl groups at these compositions."
12,Differential scanning calorimetry,"3.3 Differential scanning calorimetry The glass transition behaviour and melting temperatures of the PVA/collagen membranes were obtained from the DSC second heating scans ( Fig. 5). PVA alone showed a glass transition temperature (T g) of 76°C. In the composite membranes, a single T g corresponding to the PVA rich phase was observed. This transition broadens and shifts very slightly towards lower temperatures as the concentration of collagen increases (Fig. 5), perhaps due to the interfacial interactions between the matrix and the filler. The size of this change was small,<2.5°C, even up to 60wt% collagen addition. There was no significant difference seen between membranes prepared using DB or NB, or with different size particle preparations. There was also a minor of melting point depression during second heating scan (Fig. 5). The melting point for regenerated PVA is around 230°C. This value dropped to 215°C when the demineralised collagen content reaches 60wt% of the whole composites. Again, no significant difference was seen between the DB and NB samples, nor with different size particle preparations. A melting temperature depression is a characteristic feature of miscible polymer materials having intermolecular interactions between the components."
13,Mechanical tests,"3.4 Mechanical tests The tensile mechanical properties of the composite membranes were investigated ( Fig. 6). Both the modulus and the tensile strength of the PVA membrane were improved with the addition of both DB and NB particles up to 10wt%. At higher loadings of particles, the modulus and the tensile strength both decreased such that by 60wt% particles the tensile properties of the materials were poor. There was no notable difference seen between DB and NB particles, although the changes were somewhat larger at higher loadings with increased particle size. The un-modified PVA membrane showed Young׳s modulus and tensile strength of values of about 1430MPa, 51.2MPa respectively. There was a maximum of 35 % improvement in modulus of PVA by the addition of 10wt% demineralised collagen particles, while the tensile strength of PVA was improved by 30wt% for the same materials. Membranes including NB particles showed similar properties. On the other hand, the elongation at break of the membranes decreased with all increases in collagen loading, with a slightly greater loss with increased particle size (Fig. 6). Again there was little difference in the materials made with either DB or NB particles. The increase in tensile strength and modulus can be attributed to the higher interfacial adhesion between PVA and collagen due to the hydrogen bonding interaction between them. Thus, the PVA membrane was noticeably strengthened by the addition of collagen-based particles. The natural surface roughness of the particles may be important in this strengthening. The mechanical data have been reported for the base materials that have not been treated further to cross-link the PVA. In some biomedical applications a rapid dispersion of the PVA may be required and no cross-linking would be required. However, in other applications a more durable material may be preferred, which can be achieved by controlled cross linking of the PVA in the composite material. PVA cross linking can be achieved by chemical methods, such as with glutaraldehyde (Mansur et al., 2008), or by chemical functionalisation of the PVA (Schmedlen et al., 2002). Alternatively, stabilisation of hydrated PVA can be achieved by a series of freeze/thaw cycles (Wan et al., 2002), or by gamma irradiation (Sharaf et al., 1999). Gamma irradiation has the additional benefit of sterilising the membranes."
14,Cell culture,"3.5 Cell culture A preliminary examination of cell binding to the new composite materials was made. For these experiments only, the cell culture samples were sterilised by gamma irradiation, which also prevented the membranes from swelling and dissolving. The L-929 fibroblasts did not bind to the PVA ( Fig. 7), consistent with the previous observation that it was necessary to modify PVA, for example, with a cell binding peptide, to enhance cell interactions (Schmedlen et al., 2002). On the other hand, NB and DB particles have previously been shown to be excellent substrates for cell adhesion and culture, particularly when used in spinner culture (Glattauer et al., 2010, 2011). In the present case, cell binding, shown by calcein-AM staining, was observed at isolated locations (Fig. 7), presumably when the collagen had penetrated the PVA surface. The extent of the cell binding varied and was moderate in some samples (eg: Fig. 7A), but was almost absent in others (eg: Fig.7B). Most particles seem well buried within the PVA and so are not available for cell attachment and only those that are at, or have broken through to the surface are available to bind cells. Examination of the composite material with ethidium homodimer-1, normally used as part of a viability assay to identify dead cells, was not readily possible as this reagent reacted readily with the collagen particles in unseeded samples giving extensive red staining (data not shown). However, visual inspection of bright field images did not show any adherent attached dead cells. The live cells, as shown by the calcein-AM, were not spreading after 16h, possibly due to limited attachment sites, and were not removed by further washing with PBS. Thus, the present collagen-based particle composite materials with PVA give a new group of materials and seem capable of being useful for certain biomedical applications. The use of bone and demineralised bone particles introduces a range of growth factors into the system (Zhang et al., 1997; Blum et al., 2004; Wildemann et al., 2007). The growth factors are more readily available from the demineralised bone material (Zhang et al., 1997), although the amounts may depend on the age of the bone material and on the demineralisations process (Peterson et al., 2004; Bae et al., 2006), such that appropriate selection of particles may be necessary to achieve the desired outcome. If additional strength or prolonged turnover are required, further modification of the matrix through different cross-linking approaches is possible. In the present study we have used bovine derived material, but human bone and demineralised bone particles are readily available as these materials have been approved for orthopaedic and dental applications. Also, other polymers such as the readily resorbable polylactic/glycolic acid co-polymers could be suitable. These new materials are easy to prepare cost effectively and provide options for use in various biomedical applications, particularly for hard tissue repairs."
