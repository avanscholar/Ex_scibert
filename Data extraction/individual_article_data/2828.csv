0,Introduction,"Fuel cell vehicles are a better alternative in comparison to internal combustion engine vehicles, in the context of energy sustainability and environmental impacts. This is due to the increase in efficiency and reduction in CO2 emissions associated with the fuel cell vehicles [1]. Furthermore, micro-reformers fueled by liquid fuels such as methanol have received increasing interest to produce hydrogen for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) vehicles. This is attributed to the increased safety and volume efficiency relative to fuel cell vehicles fueled by high-pressure hydrogen [2]. It is widely accepted that the design of the fuel processor for hydrogen production can allow for small volume, small weight, low cost, long lifetime, low byproduct (carbon monoxide), ease of manufacture, low flow resistance and short start-up time [3]. These demands can be met by enhancing the heat and mass transfer of the fuel processor. As a result, the catalyst support with microstructure has been widely utilized in the reactor for hydrogen production due to its great heat and mass transfer characteristics. There are two types of typical reactors for the intensification of heat and mass transfer: the tubular reactor with micro-tube as the catalyst support and the micro-channel reactor. The tubular reactor with micro-tube as a microstructure used for fuel process has been found to be able to enhance the heat and mass transfer [4]. However, there are still some crucial obstacles for the tubular reactor to be applied in fuel cell vehicles considering the scale up and the coating of the reforming catalyst [5]. The micro-channel reactor is a better alternative as a fuel processor due to the relative ease of scale increase; and the study of the micro-channel reactors has also demonstrated the enhancement of mass and heat transfer in comparison with the traditional reactor for hydrogen production [6,7]. For a micro-channel reactor, the catalyst support is usually a metal sheet such as the stainless steel sheet with straight micro-channels [8], or the porous sintered felts such as copper fiber sintered felts [9–11]. It has been known that the ratio of surface area to volume is large for the micro-channel reactor with multi-micro-channels, but it can be much larger when changing the structure of catalyst support from ‘straight channels’ to the ‘micro-pin-fin arrays’ as shown in Fig. 1 . Therefore, a novel micro-reactor with micro-pin-fin arrays (MPFAR) for fuel processing has been developed in our previous study, and some results have shown advantages of the MPFAR for hydrogen production [12]. Due to the importance of structural effects of the catalyst support on the reactor performance of hydrogen production, it is crucial to establish a theoretical model to study the process of hydrogen production in the micro-reactor with various geometrical structures of the catalyst support. Several theoretical models have been proposed so far. The mass and heat balance equations have been adopted by Kawamura et al. [13] to design a micro-channel reactor and successfully simulate the methanol conversion rate and species concentrations in the reformed gas. Suh et al. [14] have proposed a two-dimensional model to analyze the transport phenomena in a methanol steam reformer. The simulated results based on this model were found to agree well with the experimental results. In addition, the aforementioned authors also found that the higher methanol conversion rate can be obtained with internal heating, as well as CO molar concentration. Hsueh et al. [15] have used a three-dimensional model to study the effect of geometrical structure and thermo-fluid parameters on the methanol conversion rate and efficiency of the micro-channel reformers. Their simulated results revealed that a low aspect-ratio micro-channel can enhance the performance of the micro-reformer. However, the theoretical models proposed in these previous studies were always for the tubular reactor or the micro-channel reactor and they are not suitable for the MPFAR developed in this exercise. Apart from this, there are still no existing theoretical models that can be used for analyzing the process of hydrogen production in the MPFAR. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a theoretical model for analyzing the process of hydrogen production in the MPFAR. In our previous study, some thermodynamic parameters that may affect the methanol conversion rate have been analyzed [12]. In this study, a theoretical model of material balance is established to investigate the geometrical structural effects of micro-pin-fin arrays on the reactor performance of hydrogen production in the MPFAR. Then, a series of experiments are implemented, and the rationality of the theoretical model is discussed by comparing the calculated results with the experimental ones. Finally, a better configuration of micro-pin-fin arrays is obtained for higher methanol conversion rate."
1,Theoretical modeling of the material balance for hydrogen production in the MPFAR,"To establish the theoretical model of material balance for hydrogen production via methanol steam reforming in the MPFAR, a configuration of the MPFAR is described firstly, then the theoretical model is established neglecting heat transfer in the micro-reactor. The chemical dynamic model for the methanol steam reforming process used for the theoretical model is introduced. Moreover, effects of methanol concentration and temperature on the methanol conversion rate under different catalyst thicknesses due to mass transfer and heat transfer are discussed for analyzing the rationality of the theoretical model."
2,Description of the MPFAR,"2.1 Description of the MPFAR The catalyst supports with micro-pin-fin arrays and methanol steam reforming process are used to study the effects of structural parameters on the performance of the MPFAR for hydrogen production. The structure of the MPFAR for hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 2(a). The MPFAR is sealed by graphite and heated by heater cartridges for the endothermic methanol steam reforming process. The catalyst support coated with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is mounted in the MPFAR, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The catalyst support shown in Fig. 2(c) had uniform cylindrical micro-pin-fins with uniform heights and was fabricated by a semi-solid micro thixo-forming technology due to higher production efficiency and lower cost, proposed by Steinhoff et al. [16]. Details of the MPFAR were introduced in our previous study [12]."
3,Conservation equations,"2.2 Conservation equations To study the effect of micro-pin-fin arrays on the performance of the MPFAR, the geometrical structure of the flow manifolds and the passageway in the MPFAR are not considered for simplicity in this study. Only the reaction channel with micro-pin-fin arrays is analyzed. The configuration diagram of the analyzed reaction channel is shown in Fig. 3 , the micro-pin-fin arrays in the MPFAR are uniform with the same geometrical structure and dimensions. The catalyst coated on the surface of the catalyst support is of the same thickness and is considered as isotropic and continuously distributed. The parameters of the geometrical structure for the MPFAR are listed in Table 1 . The flow of the reagents is assumed as steady and fully developed due to the low Reynolds numbers. Hence, the conservation of mass equation for species i in the micro-reactor for methanol steam reforming can be represented as [17]: (1) u ⅆ C i ⅆ x = ρ s ( 1 − ε ) r i , i = 1 ∼ 5 , where Ci is the molar concentration of the species i (i =1∼5), ri is the volumetric chemical reaction rate of the species i, ρ s is the catalyst density and x is the Cartesian coordinate. In the conservation of mass Eq. (1), ε is the void of catalyst and related to the geometrical structure of the micro-pin-fin arrays and reaction channel. Due to the geometrical structure of the reaction channel, ε is not uniform along the flow direction of the reagents, and it can be calculated as follows: (2) ε = 1 − ( W × δ ) / ( H × W ) , j ( L 0 + d ) < x < L 0 + j ( L 0 + d ) , (3) ε = 1 − ( W × δ + 2 n h δ ) / ( H × W − 2 n T h Δ x d − Δ x 2 ) , L 0 + j ( L 0 + d ) < x < ( j + 1 ) ( L 0 + d ) , where W is the width of the catalyst support, δ is the thickness of the catalyst layer, H is the height of the reaction channel, n T is the row number of micro-pin-fin arrays in the reaction channel, h is the height of the micro-pin-fin, d is the diameter of the micro-pin-fin, L 0 is the distance between two adjacent micro-pin-fins, and j is a natural number sequence which is from 0 to n L, n L is the column number of micro-pin-fin arrays in the reaction channel. In the conservation of mass Eq. (1), u is the mean velocity of the cross-section along the flow direction of the reagents and also considered as the function of geometrical structure, which can be calculated as: (4) u = u 0 · A 0 / A × ( 1 + X m · η m ) , where u 0 and A 0 are the mean velocity and the section area of the reaction channel at the entrance, respectively; X m is the volumetric expansion coefficient produced by the catalytic methanol steam reforming reaction; η m is the methanol conversion rate for the methanol steam reforming process, and A is the section area along the flow direction, which is represented as: (5) A = A 0 , j ( L 0 + d ) < x < L 0 + j ( L 0 + d ) , (6) A = H × W − 2 n T h Δ x d − Δ x 2 , L 0 + j ( L 0 + d ) < x < ( j + 1 ) ( L 0 + d ) . For Eq. (1), the temperature difference in the reaction channel with micro-pin-fin arrays was neglected due to the great heat transfer in the MPFAR. So the constant reaction temperature is specified which is the same as the wall temperature. The mass transfer of the cross-section along the flow direction of reagents is also neglected and the species are impermeable through the wall of the reaction channel. For methanol steam reforming process, the reagents of steam and methanol are vaporized and overheated to the reaction temperature before flowing into the catalyst layer beginning with the x coordinate of zero, i.e., i =0. The molar ratio of steam and methanol is fixed and the other thermo-physical parameters are specified in this study, which are shown in Table 1."
4,Effects of the temperature on reforming process for hydrogen production,"2.3 Effects of the temperature on reforming process for hydrogen production The temperature has a critical effect on methanol conversion rate in the catalytic reactor. The temperature distribution in the micro-channel reactor coated by catalysts presented in Ref. [15] revealed that the temperature in the micro-reactor increases rapidly at the entrance of the micro-channel, and attains the wall temperature value when the x coordinate is about 10% of the total micro-channel length. This means that the temperature difference in the thin catalyst layer can be neglected within the available error range. Neglecting the effect of inner heat source due to low molar flow flux of reagents at the entrance, the surface temperature of the catalyst layer as a function of catalyst thickness can be represented as: (7) T C = ( Nu × λ g / d × T m + λ s / δ × T w ) / ( Nu × λ g / d + λ s / δ ) . The Nu of 3.66 is used to calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient between the catalyst surface and the main reagent flow. The temperature of the catalyst layer in contact with the reactor wall keeps constant at the wall temperature (T w). The relationship between them can be illustrated as Fig. 4 . When the catalyst thickness is 1000μm, the temperature is decreased to 525K, and the maximum temperature difference is about 1.54%. According to the Arrhenius rate equation of methanol steam reforming, the maximum reaction rate also decreases by about 25%; however, when the catalyst thickness is 100μm, the temperature is decreased by 1K, and the temperature difference is about 0.2%. According to the Arrhenius rate equation of methanol steam reforming, the maximum reaction rate only decreases by about 3.5%. According to the calculated results, the temperature distribution in the direction of the catalyst thickness can be neglected due to the thin catalyst layer adopted in this study."
5,Chemical dynamic equation of methanol steam reforming,"2.4 Chemical dynamic equation of methanol steam reforming To solve the conversion of mass Eq. (1), ri should be quantified. The HiFUEL R120 catalyst (CuO/ZnO/Al2O3) of Alfa Aesar is adopted in this study. The reaction schemes for methanol steam reforming are described as [18]: (8) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → K R 3 H 2 + CO 2 , (9) CH 3 OH → K D 2 H 2 + CO , (10) CO + H 2 O → H 2 + CO 2 . Methanol is primarily reformed via reaction (8). Some portion of methanol also decomposed directly to CO via reaction (9). The water-gas shift reaction (reaction (10)) can be neglected considering the accuracy of the dynamic analysis. So the chemical reaction rates can be expressed as [4]: (11) r R = k R C 1 , (12) r D = k D , where r R and r D are the reaction rates of the methanol steam reforming reaction and the methanol decomposition reaction, respectively; k R and k D are the reaction constants of the methanol reforming reaction and the methanol deformation reaction, respectively; C 1 is the molar concentration of the gaseous methanol. The reaction constants are as follows [18]: (13) k R = ( A R + B R ln SMR ) e ( − E a 1 / R T ) , (14) k D = A D e ( − E a 2 / R T ) , where SMR is the molar ratio of steam and methanol; A R, B R are the Amphlett’s constants for the methanol reforming reaction and A D is the Amphlett’s constant for the methanol decomposition reaction; E a1 and E a2 are the activation energies of the methanol reforming reaction and the methanol decomposition reaction, respectively; R is the universal gas constant, and T is the reaction temperature of the MPFAR. Thus, the generation rates of the species for the methanol steam reforming process can be expressed as: (15a) r 1 = − r R − r D , (15b) r 2 = − r R , (15c) r 3 = r R , (15d) r 4 = r D , (15e) r 5 = 3 r R + 2 r D . where the subscripts are as follows: 1=CH3OH, 2=H2O, 3=CO2, 4=CO, and 5=H2. The catalyst thickness (or mass) also affects the mean reaction rate at the cross-section perpendicular to the flow direction of reagents. A consensus exists which suggests that the reaction rate of a catalytic reaction is always influenced by three factors: the external diffusion, the internal diffusion, and the intrinsic reaction rate. In the direction of the catalyst thickness, the mass transport equation can be represented as [19]: (16) ⅆ V R = F M0 / ρ s ( 1 − ε s ) ⅆ X m / ( − r SR ) , which can be simplified as: (17) d 2 C 1 × D / K C 1 = ρ s ( 1 − ε s ) ⅆ y 2 . The first order reaction rate equation of the methanol steam reforming reaction is used to calculate the methanol concentration distribution in the catalyst layer along the direction of the catalyst thickness [20]. Consequently, C 1 as a function of y can be expressed as: (18) C 1 = C 10 e 2 a δ + 1 e a y + C 10 e 2 a δ e 2 a δ + 1 e − a y , where C 10 is the surface concentration of the catalyst layer, δ is the catalyst thickness, and the parameter a can be represented as: (19) a = K D ρ s − K D ρ s ε s D . The mean C 1 of the section area is used to analyze the effect of micro-pin-fin arrays as presented in Section 2.2. As mentioned above, Eqs. (1)–(6) are used to calculate the unknown molar concentration along the flow direction x of the two reagents (CH3OH and H2O) and the three products (H2, CO2 and CO). By using the dynamic model proposed in Section 2.4, ri in Eq. (1) related to the unknown molar concentrations can be calculated. Using Eq. (1) which can be rewritten to five equations when i changes from 1 to 5, and the inlet condition of the methanol and steam molar concentration, the unknown variables can be calculated. Based on the calculated results, the effects of structural parameters on the performance of the MPFAR for hydrogen production are obtained and the results and discussion are presented in Section 4."
6,Experimental,
7,Preparation of the catalyst supports,"3.1 Preparation of the catalyst supports For performance measurement and verification of the theoretical analysis about the catalyst support with various micro-pin-fin arrays, a series of experiments was implemented. The catalyst supports with different geometrical structures are depicted in Fig. 5 . A set of six catalyst supports, whose heights of the uniform micro-pin-fin arrays were 0.4–1.0; the longitudinal and transverse center-to-center distances were 1.8–2.4; were employed in this study to evaluate the effects of micro-pin-fin arrays on the performance of the MPFAR for hydrogen production via methanol steam reforming. A typical configuration of the MPFAR for hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 2. The catalyst support with material of semi-solid alloy A356 was fabricated by micro thixo-forming technology [12]. The six catalyst supports in this study were geometrically identical apart from the structure of micro-pin-fin arrays. The detailed parameters of the catalyst supports are shown in Table 2 ."
8,Experimental setup,"3.2 Experimental setup The HiFUEL R120 catalyst (CuO/ZnO/Al2O3) of Alfa Aesar for methanol steam reforming was used in this study to evaluate the effects of various micro-pin-fin array structures. The catalyst supports with coated catalysts were mounted in the MPFAR and the methanol steam reforming reaction was used to assess the performance for hydrogen production with various catalyst supports. The configuration of the MPFAR used to produce hydrogen for different catalyst supports is shown as Fig. 2(a) in Section 2. The reagents went in from the inlet tube and out from the outlet tube. Fig. 6 illustrates the schematic diagram of the reaction system for hydrogen production via SMR. The reaction system consisted of three subsystems including a reagent feeding unit, a micro-reactor, a reformed gas treatment and analysis unit. The reactor, inlet and outlet tubes were thermally insulated via the use of asbestos. Before hydrogen production, the catalyst was reduced in the N2/H2 gas mixture with 5 vol.% H2 under the flow rate of 30sccm at 523K and the reduction time is in the range of two or three hours decided by the catalyst mass used in the micro-reactor. N2 was used after the reduction process to eliminate the remaining reduction gases. This was carried out to avoid adverse effects on the accuracy of the analysis results. The methanol steam reforming was implemented in the MPFAR. The methanol and water mixer were vaporized and overheated by an evaporator before entering the MPFAR, where the flow rate of reagents was controlled by a syringe pump. The temperatures of the evaporator and the MPFAR were measured by thermocouples and controlled by LABVIEW software. The flow rate of the dry reformed gas was measured by a meter, and the compositions of the products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies model 7890A) which was equipped with thermal conductivity detectors and three packed columns: One column was filled with Sieve 5A 60/80, suitable to separate H2, CO, N2, and the other column was filled with Hayesep Q 80/100, to separate CO2. The gas chromatograph was calibrated by the standard gas. Activity tests for the MPFAR were performed over various catalyst supports with the inlet liquid flow rates changing from 0.025 to 0.1ml/min. The molar ratio of steam to methanol (S/C) and the reaction temperature were kept constant. For each test, the methanol conversion rate was determined by the flow rate of dry reformed gas and the results shown in the gas chromatograph. The equation to calculate the methanol conversion rate is: η M = V ˙ · Y C / V m / F M 0 , where V ˙ and Y C are the volumetric flow rate of the dry reformed gas at standard conditions and the carbon volumetric fraction in the dry reformed gas, respectively; V m is the molar volume, and F M0 is the methanol molar flow rate at the entrance of the reaction channel. The experimental results will be demonstrated and discussed in Section 4."
9,Results and discussion,"By using the theoretical model of material balance established in Section 2 and the experiments implemented in Section 3, the effects of structural parameters (micro-pin-fin height, the center distance between two adjacent micro-pin-fins) on the MPFAR performance can be obtained and the results are shown as follows."
10,Accuracy of the theoretical model,"4.1 Accuracy of the theoretical model Fig. 7 shows the calculated and experimental values of methanol conversion rate at various inlet liquid flow rates and catalyst masses under the conditions that the S/C molar ratio and reaction temperature are 1.2 and 523.15K, respectively. It can be found that methanol conversion rate increases with the decrease of the inlet liquid flow rate. From Fig. 7, it can be found that the maximum error of the methanol conversion rate between the experimental results and the calculated ones is less than 7%, and the small discrepancy shows that the calculated results about the methanol conversion rate are reasonably consistent with the experimental ones. This indicates the feasibility of the theoretical model of the material balance for hydrogen production in the MPFAR established in this study. Though the errors of these experimental and calculated results are small, it also can be found that with the increase of catalyst mass, the error between the experimental and calculated results increases. This is because with the increase of the catalyst thickness and the inlet Reynolds number, the effects of heat and mass transfer becomes more and more obvious. The further analysis of heat and mass transfer for the MPFAR will be conducted in the future. Experiments also reveal that the ratio of molar fraction between CO2 and H2 is approximately 1/3, meaning that the methanol steam reforming reaction dominates in the methanol steam reforming process [21]."
11,Effects of the micro-pin-fin height,"4.2 Effects of the micro-pin-fin height Fig. 8 shows the calculated methanol conversion rate and the CO molar fraction in dry reformed gas with different heights of micro-pin-fins. The micro-pin-fins can enhance heat transfer characteristic of the MPFAR, and more catalyst can be coated on higher micro-pin-fin arrays. Therefore, from Fig. 8, it can be seen that the methanol conversion rate and the CO molar fraction in the dry reformed gas increase with the increment of the micro-pin-fin height. Also, the methanol conversion rate and the CO molar fraction increase with the decrease of the inlet flow rate; where the methanol conversion rate reaches about 95% when h and f are 1mm and 0.0125ml/min, respectively. From Fig. 8, the methanol conversion rate increases by about 10% when the height of the micro-pin-fin increases from 0.2 to 1mm. For the coating of the catalyst, the height of the micro-pin-fin should be lower than the channel height. When the inlet liquid flow rate is 0.025ml/min, the methanol conversion rate is above 80% with the catalyst layer thickness of 75μm, so when the catalyst layer gets to 100μm, the methanol conversion rate can reach to about 90%. Under this condition, the H2 volumetric fraction at the outlet of the reaction channel was 74.1%. For a typical PEM fuel cell operating at 60% thermal efficiency and 72% H2 utilization, it is estimated to be able to generate power for a 3.5W fuel cell [22]. Fig. 9 shows the calculated and experimental values of the methanol conversion rate at various inlet flow rate and micro-pin-fin height. The experimental results show that with the increase of micro-pin-fin height, the methanol conversion rate increases, accompanied with a higher CO molar fraction in the dry reformed gas (which is not depicted). Furthermore, the experimental values are consistent with the calculated ones. It can be found from Fig. 9 that for the same catalyst mass (with the micro-pin-fin heights of 0.7mm and 1.0mm), with the increase of the micro-pin-fin height, the methanol conversion rate decreases. This can be appreciated from the fact that the increase of mean velocity in the section area reduces the contact time between the catalyst and the reagents. As discussed above, the increase of the micro-pin-fin arrays can increase the inner surface area for more catalyst to be coated on, which in turn improves the volumetric energy efficiency of the micro-reactor. Furthermore, when the thickness of the catalyst layer is lower than 100μm, the experimental results reveal that the effect of mass transfer in the catalyst layer can be neglected. However, with the further increase of catalyst mass (i.e. the increase of catalyst coating thickness) and Reynolds number, the external and internal thermal and mass diffusion should be considered. For this case, the advantage of the micro-pin-fin arrays will be more obvious, and will not solely depend on the aspect of the catalyst coating area."
12,Effects of the center distance of micro-pin-fin,"4.3 Effects of the center distance of micro-pin-fin Figs. 10 and 11 show the calculated methanol conversion rate and the CO molar fraction in dry reformed gas with the different center distances between the two adjacent micro-pin-fins, respectively. For simplification, the horizontal coordinates are the numbers of the micro-pin-fins in the transverse and the longitudinal direction, respectively. As the effect of the micro-pin-fin height, due to the decrease of the center distance continues, more catalyst is coated on the inner surface of the MPFAR, so more methanol can be reacted in the reaction channel, increasing the methanol conversion, as well as the CO molar fraction. When the transverse and longitudinal center distances between the two adjacent micro-pin-fins is about 1.8mm (i.e., n T =10, n L =10), the methanol conversion rate gets to 95% under the condition that the reaction temperature and the S/C molar raio are 523.15K and 1.2, respectively. From Figs. 10 and 11, it can be found that the changes of methanol conversion rate under the two conditions are almost similar, as well as the CO molar fraction. Through the increase of the center distance between the two adjacent micro-pin-fins, the methanol conversion rate increases by 10% when the center distance changes from 1.2 to 2.6mm, which means that the micro-pin-fin arrays can enhance the performance of the micro-reactor for hydrogen production efficiently. Also from Fig. 11, when the n L is 16, the gap between the two adjacent micro-pin-fins is shorter than the thickness of the catalyst layer as in other cases, so the methanol conversion rate and the CO molar fraction start to decrease. Fig. 12 shows the calculated and experimental results of the methanol conversion rate with various inlet liquid flow rate and n L under the condition that the S/C molar ratio and reaction temperature are 1.2 and 523.15K, respectively. From Fig. 12, it can be found that with the increase of n L, the methanol conversion rate increases, which is consistent with the calculated results based on the theoretical model. Having said that, the methanol conversion rate is lower with larger n L under the condition of the same catalyst mass. This is because with the increase of the n L, the reagents flow more rapidly through the micro-pin-fin arrays due to the decrease in section area along the flow direction, decreasing the residence time of the reagents in the micro-reactor, which in turn results in a low methanol conversion. It is known that the catalyst thickness with n L =7 should be larger than that with n L =12 for the same catalyst mass, but from Fig. 12, it is demonstrated that the influence of catalyst thickness is not obvious. This is another evidence for the feasibility of the theoretical model. Furthermore, the experiments of hydrogen production in the MPFAR show the hydrogen production with unit catalyst thickness can reach to 0.147ml/min/μm, while for a micro-channel proposed by Kim et al. [19], the hydrogen production with unit catalyst thickness is 0.138ml/min/μm. The results also validate the advantage of the MPFAR."
13,Coupling effects of the velocity and catalyst mass,"4.4 Coupling effects of the velocity and catalyst mass The varieties of the micro-pin-fin arrays heights and the center distance between the two adjacent micro-pin-fins affect the fluid velocity in the micro-reactor and the catalyst coating area directly. The changes of fluid velocity and catalyst coating area are same with structural varieties of micro-pin-fin arrays. That being said, the influence of them on methanol conversion rate of the micro-reactor is adverse. As discussed above, the fluid velocity hinders the conversion of methanol, while the catalyst coating area promotes it. According to the Eq. (1), the methanol conversion rate is affected by the ratio between the catalyst coating area and the velocity, which can be calculated as Wδ +2nhδ. Since the expression is monotonous, the methanol conversion rate is monotonous with the changes of the inlet velocity and the catalyst coating area. Therefore, for the scale studied in this study, the variety of methanol conversion rate is monotone with the geometrical structural change of micro-pin-fin arrays at the same inlet velocity and catalyst thickness. All the above results are consistent with this demonstration. According to the analysis mentioned above, a better geometrical structure of the micro-pin-fin arrays is obtained. The structural parameters of the better geometrical structure are 1.0mm for the micro-pin-fin height, and 1.2mm for the distance between the two adjacent micro-pin-fins. Under this condition, the hydrogen production yield can reach about 8.3ml/min with the methanol conversion rate above 90%."
14,Conclusions,"To enhance the energy conversion efficiency of the MPFAR for hydrogen production, the effects of geometrical structure on the performance of the MPFAR for hydrogen production via methanol steam reforming are investigated. A theoretical model of material balance for hydrogen production in the MPFAR is established considering the effects of geometrical parameters and the dynamic chemical model for methanol steam reforming process described in this study. The temperature in the catalyst layer is discussed and the results reveal the rationality of neglecting the heat transfer of the MPFAR. By solving the variables in the equations of the theoretical model, the methanol conversion rate and CO molar fraction in the dry product are obtained for various structures of micro-pin-fin arrays. The results show the crucial structural effect on the MPFAR performances for hydrogen production. With the increase of the micro-pin-fin arrays height, the methanol conversion rate increases, accompanied by the increase of the CO molar fraction in dry reformed gas. The methanol conversion rate increases by about 10% when the height of the micro-pin-fins increases from 0.2 to 1.0mm or the center distance changes from 1.2 to 2.6mm. Also, a better geometrical structure of the micro-pin-fin arrays is obtained, and the structural parameters of the better geometrical structure are 1.0mm for the micro-pin-fin height, 1.2mm for the distance between two adjacent micro-pin-fins. In this case, the hydrogen yield of the MPFAR can reach about 8.3ml/min under the condition that the methanol conversion rate is above 90%. This study would provide the theoretical basis for the continuum design, manufacture and optimization of the MPFAR for hydrogen production by steam reforming of alcohol."
