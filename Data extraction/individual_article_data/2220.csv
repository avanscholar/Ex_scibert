0,Introduction,"The growing science of climate change research is increasingly demonstrating the need to produce more environmentally sustainable energy sources. The percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has seen a dramatic increase since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is a greenhouse gas that increases the heat capacity of air and, thus, the energy reserved in the atmosphere [1]. On the other side, the main reasons for the notable increasing interest in utilizing biomass energy are includes poverty reduction in poor regions, capability of delivering energy in all forms and at all times, and minimizing CO2 emissions and global warming [2]. Consequently, biomass can be the world's best, largest and most potent choice for supplying energy demands in the future [3]. As a colorless, odorless, non-toxic, very light, carbon free and highly combustible gas, hydrogen is a clean energy carrier that yields 2.75 times more energy than hydrocarbon fuels [4]. Based on fuel-to-wheel efficiency values, the efficiency of hydrogen operated fuel cell cars is about 36%, while it is 26% for the electric vehicles, 27% for high efficiency diesel engines and 17% for the conventional gasoline engines [5]. The process of hydrogen production includes both extracting and isolating hydrogen molecules to a desired level of purity [5]. Hydrogen production techniques can be divided into two major groups: fuel processing and non-reforming techniques [6]. A recent economic analysis showed that hydrogen production from natural gas and coal is currently the most feasible; however, this is not expected to be the case in the near future with the ongoing technological progress in utilizing new alternative sources for hydrogen generation [7]. In this context, glycerol, the main by-product from transesterification processes, has gained its significance as a feedstock for hydrogen generation. At the same time, demand on free glycerol is not growing due to the saturation of the market [8]. The current market of crude glycerol is very unsteady, and the future scenarios will eventually be controlled by the supply and demand levels on this product [9]. The major technologies of hydrogen production from glycerol are the steam reforming, partial oxidation and the auto-thermal reforming (ATR) process. Other investigations have also been done on hydrogen peroxide reforming [10], dry reforming [11], dry autothermal reforming [12], and aqueous phase reforming [13]. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages based on energy efficiency, hydrogen yield and process stability. Steam reforming of glycerol has been widely studied in the literature [14]. It is a highly endothermic process that produces 7 mol of H2 per 1 mol of glycerol according to reaction (1). Catalyst deactivation and energy demand are the main drawbacks of the steam reforming process. (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 ( g ) + 3 H 2 O → 7 H 2 ( g ) + 3 CO 2 ( g ) Δ H 298.15 ° = + 123 kJ/mol On the other hand, partial oxidation is an exothermic reaction. The sufficient supply of oxygen drives the reaction to yield 4 mol of hydrogen and 3 mol of carbon dioxide according to reaction (2) [15]. However, hydrogen yield is the main drawback of oxidation reactions. (2) C 3 H 8 O 3 ( g ) + 1 . 5 O 2 ( g ) → 3 CO 2 ( g ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298.15 ° = − 597 . 7 kJ/mol The combination of the previous two techniques results in the ATR process. The main merits of the ATR process include energy efficiency, process stability, as was confirmed by previous thermodynamic studies [16,17]. However, most of the previous studies were focused on producing hydrogen from pure glycerol feed via conventional steam reforming and aqueous phase techniques. Therefore, this wok represents the first attempt to experimentally investigate the ATR of crude glycerol mixture for the production of hydrogen rich gas over nickel-based catalysts. The individual effects of the crude glycerol impurities, as well as the operating parameters were investigated to explore the main impacts and interactions among these parameters using statistical techniques. The impacts of the support promoter elements (Gd, Mg and Ca), calcination temperatures, reduction temperatures, reaction temperatures, steam-to-carbon ratios (S/C), and oxygen-to-carbon ratios (O/C) on the ATR of crude glycerol were investigated in this work. Also, a statistical model was developed and validated to quantify the effect of each operating parameter on the overall reaction performance for maximum hydrogen yield."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Three different promoter elements were tested in this study: Calcium, Gadolinium and Magnesium (Ca, Mg and Gd). The selection of the support was based on the experimental results obtained in a previous study by our group [18]. At the beginning, nitrates precursors (Ce, Zr & M) were firstly dissolved in 500 ml of deionized (DI) water. A predetermined amount of the surfactant (CTAB) solution in DI water was heated to 60 °C and mixed with the precursor solution. The measured weights of nitrate precursors and surfactant were determined according to Ce0.5Zr0.33M0.17 nominal composition and 0.5 surfactant-to-metal ratio [CTAB]/[Ce + Zr + M], respectively. Aqueous ammonium hydroxide (28–30% w/w) was then added gradually to control the pH at around 11.8. The mixture was then heated at 90 °C for 5 days and the precipitated material was collected by filtration, rinsed with DI water, dried for 12 h at 120 °C, and calcined at 650 °C for 3 h. Wet impregnation technique was used to obtain a catalyst with a composition of 5%Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.33M0.17 where M = Ca, Mg and Gd. Different pellet sizes (0.5–1.27 mm) were prepared using hydraulic press (model 3912, Carver) and standard sieves (ASTM U.S.A., E-11 standards)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted under inert gas (N2) flow and atmospheric pressure using TGA-50 (Shimadzu, Japan) instrument. The flow of nitrogen was adjusted at 50 ml/min at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. N2 physisorption analysis was carried out under pure nitrogen flow (99.99% pure N2; Praxair) using ASAP-2010 apparatus (Micromeritics Instruments Inc, USA). The samples were first degassed for about 4 h at a temperature of 180 °C before starting the analysis. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) runs were performed using TGA-50 (Shimadzu, Japan) instrument using an oxidizing gas flow rate of 50 ml/min (5% O2 balanced with N2; Praxair). The coke formed over the surface of the catalyst was quantified by the weight loss observed between 360 and 600 °C [19]. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted using ChemBET-3000 instrument (Quantachrome, USA) to obtain the optimum reduction temperature required to activate the catalyst before screening its performance. Powder XRD patterns were established using D8 diffractometer (Bruker AXS, USA) equipped with Ni-Kα radiation source at 40 mA and 40 KV to study the crystallinity of supports and catalysts and investigate the uniformity of active sites dispersion over the surface of the carrier material. A 2θ range of 10°–90° with a step size of 0.02° was applied to collect the intensity data. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was conducted to quantify the nickel amount incorporated over the support and obtain the elemental composition of the catalysts."
4,Synthetic crude glycerol preparation,"2.3 Synthetic crude glycerol preparation The synthetic crude glycerol utilized in this study was prepared in our lab by mixing the commonly found chemicals in the commercial crude glycerol generated at biodiesel plants. A batch of about 120 ml containing free glycerol (Sigma Aldrich), water, methanol (Fisher Scientific), soap (Potassium Palmitate Standard Solution from Sigma Aldrich), free fatty acids (FFA) and ashes was prepared prior to each screening run. These are the common chemicals found in crude glycerol mixtures. Assuming an excellent separation of biodiesel, therefore any significant amount of methyl esters was not considered in the glycerol stream. This assumption was based on the composition of the crude glycerol collected from Milligan biofuels, where the weight percentage of fatty acids, canola oil and methyl esters all together was less than 10 wt%. Potassium hydroxide was also exempted from the synthetic CG and just ashes of NaCl and KCl were considered [20]. Oleic acid (Alfa Aesar) was used as the source of FFA in the synthetic CG. The ashes were provided by the addition of sodium and potassium chlorides (NaCl and KCl from Alfa Aesar) [21]. The synthetic CG was then prepared by mixing the individual components to yield a mixture with an average molecular formula of C2.5H7O2 and an average molecular weight of 69.08 g/mol. Table 1 shows the physical properties and weight percentages of the below listed chemicals used in synthetic CG preparation."
5,Catalytic testing,"2.4 Catalytic testing The catalytic reactor setup used in this study is explained in detail in our previous work [22]. The catalyst was mixed with 7.6 g of α-Al2O3 particles (0.8 mm) and loaded inside the reactor to obtain a bed height of 4.5 cm. The activation of catalyst was performed by applying a constant flow of 100 ml/min of a reducing gas (5% H2; balance N2) for 2 h. After that, the desired reaction temperature was adjusted and the syringe pump was regulated at 0.15 ml/min flow rate to supply the glycerol feedstock (W/FA0 = 127.4 gcat.min/mol C). The flow of air was adjusted between 19 and 126 ml/min based on the oxygen-to-carbon ratio in the inlet feed. The product gas stream from the PBTR was cooled down in a water-cooled condenser (16 °C) and the condensate flowing out was then collected in an ice-cooled stainless steel collector. The outlet flow of gas from the liquid collector was measured by a digital flow meter, and then sent to a gas chromatograph for composition analysis. All screening experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure. After integrating the different components of the synthetic crude glycerol into an averaged molecular formula of C2.5H7O2, the different stoichiometries for synthetic CG autothermal reaction (Equation (3)) at different ratios of S/C and O/C were found as given in Table 2 . (3) C 2 . 5 H 7 O 2 + aH 2 O + bO 2 ↔ 2 CO 2 + 0 . 5 CH 4 + cH 2 + dH 2 O The catalytic performance was then evaluated based on conversion, hydrogen selectivity, hydrogen yield, turnover frequency (TOF) and rate of coke formation as shown respectively in Equations (4)–(8).

6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalysts characteristics,"3.1 Catalysts characteristics 3.1.1 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) In the case of CeZrM support shown in Fig. 1 , the first peak of weight loss was observed between 20 °C and 100 °C where the rate of weight loss reached a maximum value of 0.3 mg/min. This stage corresponds to the removal of moisture from the pores of the support and the hydrated salts. The hydrated salts associated in this case are Ce(NO3)2·6H2O, ZrO(NO3)2. xH2O and Ca(NO3)2·4H2O. The second stage of weight loss was identified by a second peak between 180 and 400 °C. This peak attributes to the removal of surfactant (CTAB) and nitrates (NO3 −) remained in the collected solid material (support) after filtration and rinsing with hot deionized water. On the other hand, the first stage of weight loss for the 5Ni/CeZrM catalyst given in Fig. 1 was again observed between 20 and 100 °C with a maximum weight loss rate of 0.15 mg/min. Along with the moisture removed from the pores of the catalyst and the hydrated salts mentioned previously, hydrated Ni(NO3)2·6H2O also contributes to the moisture peak in the catalyst profile. The second peak of weight loss appears between 150 and 500 °C. The wider peak in this case is justified by the larger amount of nitrates present and their dispersion in the internal pores of the catalyst. At the time of support preparation, most of the used nitrates would have gone with the water through filtration and rinsing, unlike the impregnation of the active material where all the nitrates present in the aqueous Nickel nitrate solution got aggregated inside the catalyst. According to these results, an optimum calcination temperature of 550 °C was recommended. 3.1.2 N2 physisorption and ICP-MS on fresh supports and catalysts The obtained set of isotherms shown in Fig. 2 (a)–(f) manifests that the structure of the catalysts can be categorized under “Type IV” group, which belongs to the mesoporous material that has a strong adsorption affinity [23]. The adsorption hysteresis of Ca belong to H2 type where the interpretation of the loop hysteresis is complex, and the overall network effects must be considered for defining the distribution of pore size and shape. On the other hand, H3 type loops corresponding to Gd and Mg indicate the presence of plate-like particles that yield split-shaped pores where the limiting adsorption tends to be null at high P/P0. In this work, the collected measurements of BET surface area, average pore volume, average pore diameter along with the actual mass fraction of nickel from ICP-MS are given in Table 3 . The ranges of specific area and pore volume of the prepared catalytic material were 115.3–187.3 m2/g and 0.23–0.45 cm3/g, respectively. The average pore size was in the range of 55.0–109.4 Å within the range of mesoporous material specifications (20–500 Å). Mesoporous materials are widely applied in the field of heterogeneous catalysis due to the large surface area they provide. The high surface area of the catalyst increases the rate of the reaction by providing a large number of active sites. 3.1.3 N2 physisorption on the spent catalysts A reduction in specific area and pore volume with reforming temperature can be observed from the results of N2 physisorption results given in Table 4 . The promoted CeriumZirconium support loaded with 5 wt% nickel (5%Ni/CZM) showed a stable performance in the autothermal reforming of CG. Usually, sintering of metallic atoms and coke depositions are the main causes of catalyst deactivation. The addition of zirconium to cerium oxide support was proved to enhance the thermal stability of the binary Ce–Zr metal oxides and thus resists sintering [24]. Cerium also suppresses sintering and reduces the selectivity of methane in the product gas for Ni–Co based catalysts [25]. In a previous study by our group, 5Ni/CeZrCa catalyst retained the mesoporous property and no sintering effects were observed even at a very high calcination temperature (∼900 °C) [26]. In the case of synthetic CG ATR reactions, the possible coke formation over the surface of Ni/CeZrCa catalyst could be related to the high conversion (C–C cleavage rate) of synthetic crude glycerol at high temperatures, the reason that would have caused the observed reduction in surface area and porosity. In order to study this possibility, TPO runs were performed on the spent catalysts to quantify carbon deposits. 3.1.4 Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) The weight loss in the range of 360–600 °C was considered to be the amount of coke formed during the ATR of synthetic CG experiments. The peaks of CO and CO2 formation that correspond to coke gasification appeared within similar temperature ranges in previous studies [27]. It is well-known that ternary oxide mixture (CeZrM) has a high capability of coke affinity reduction. Indeed, the redox nature of Ce–Zr metal oxides facilitates the gasification of superficial carbon and minimizes coke formation over the surface of Ni/CeZr catalyst [26]. A very low carbon deposition (∼8 μmol of C/mg of catalyst) was observed over Ni/CeZr catalyst utilized in the steam reforming of ethanol [28]. The rate of carbon deposition depends on several factors such as feed composition, catalyst used, reforming temperature, S/C, and O/C ratios in the inlet feed. TPO profiles obtained at different ratios of O/C are given in Fig. 3 . Coke formation over catalyst surface was expectedly found to decrease with O/C and S/C ratios and increase with the reforming temperature as given in Fig. 4 (a)–(c). Coke deposition rate decreased from 19.41 mg C/gcat h at low O/C of 0.20 to almost zero at high O/C of 0.80. Indeed, this is the one of the major advantages of having partial oxidations alongside with steam reforming reactions. The oxygen burns off the carbon and, therefore, prevents catalyst deactivation as discussed in many previous studies [29–31]. Coming to the variation of coke formation rate with S/C ratio, the highest rate of 10.38 mg C/gcat h was obtained at S/C of 1.6; it then decreased to 1.61 mg C/gcat h at S/C ratio of 3.6. Actually, the addition of steam suppresses the radical polymerization reactions that lead to coke formation [32]. However, high steam-to-carbon ratio might also slow down the kinetics of the involved reactions and reduce the thermal efficiency of the process. A favorable ratio should be adjusted to keep the process in a stable and pragmatic area. Coke deposition rate was found to increase with an increase in reforming temperature. A maximum rate of 6.37 mg C/gcat h was observed at the highest tested reforming temperature (650 °C). Indeed, high reaction temperatures favor carbonaceous intermediates deposits over the surface of the catalyst [33]. In a recent study about the catalytic steam reforming of glycerol, it was recommended not to exceed a reforming temperature of 650 °C to avoid the formation of encapsulated carbon that consequently affects the stability of the catalyst [34]. 3.1.5 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) In the case of 5Ni/CeZrCa catalyst, two consecutive peaks were observed in the temperature ranges of 420–530 °C and 550–630 °C as given in Fig. 5 (a)–(c), and a third small one in the range of 850–900 °C. The earlier peaks can be ascribed to the surface reduction of nickel and cerium oxide molecules, while the ones appearing beyond 800 °C represent the bulk reduction, in which oxygen needs first to diffuse and reach the surface where it reacts with the reducing gas [35]. As expected, no peaks were observed for pristine zirconium oxide. Indeed, it is well-known that the reduction of ZrO2 molecules takes place at high temperatures (>1000 °C). The reducibility was calculated based on 1/Tmax expression, where Tmax corresponds to the biggest peak in the pattern. In the case of magnesium promoter element, a shift to the right was observed with the major peak appears between 600 and 700 °C, again with a similar surface and bulk reduction behavior. The reducibility of gadolinium promoted catalyst was very similar to calcium one. In both cases the highest reduction peak appeared around 500 °C. 3.1.6 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The crystallinity of the developed supports and catalysts was investigated through powder XRD analyses. Fig. 6 displays the XRD patterns obtained for the prepared CeZrM supports together with the 5 wt% impregnated nickel catalysts. The green spectrum at the middle is for nickel oxide (NiO2). The reason for presenting nickel oxide spectrum in between supports and catalysts ones is to be able to pinpoint the existence or absence of a new crystalline phase, and subsequently to confirm the uniformity of active metal dispersion over the support surface. Same diffraction spectra were obtained for the modified Ce-Zr supports prepared using different promoter elements, and this confirms the fact that these elements does not really affect the orientational order of the supporting material phases. The diffraction patterns reveal a cubic fluorite structure having an exact match with pristine ceria patterns for the prepared supports and catalysts. The diffraction spectra of supports and catalysts are identical in the case of calcium promoter. No peaks for NiO were detected in the catalyst patterns, and this is a major advantage for using the surfactant-assisted method for impregnation in order to create a monolayer of the active metal over the surface of the support. The presence of NiO crystalline phase in case of magnesium promoter can be identified from Fig. 6. At the same time, it is very hard to be identified in case of calcium and gadolinium promoters. The observed difference in active metal segregation upon changing the promoter element can be attributed to the dissimilarity of interactions between NiO and the promoting atoms."
8,Catalytic activity evaluation,"3.2 Catalytic activity evaluation 3.2.1 Effects of synthetic crude glycerol components The effects of the different components of crude glycerol were investigated in a packed bed tubular reactor at steam-to-carbon ratio of 3.6 and oxygen-to-carbon ratio of 0.50 using 5Ni/CeZrGd catalyst. At this stage, the main concern was to check the capability of the prepared catalyst for handling this mixture of different chemicals without being deactivated. In general, a stable performance was observed for the Gd catalyst with different effects of each component on the overall activity. The activity of the catalyst was evaluated based on synthetic hydrogen yield and turnover frequency results. The first data point for pure glycerol reforming was adopted from a previous study by our group [18]. The effect of methanol addition on the conversion of glycerol mixture was very slight, and a steady performance can be observed from the main effects plot in Fig. 7 (a)–(d). The methanol in the feed was reformed to produce hydrogen too. Metallic nickel catalyzes the decomposition of methanol into hydrogen and carbon monoxide at the proper reaction conditions. Coming to the effect of methanol addition on hydrogen production, a decrease from 1.32 to 1.26 mol H2/mol Cin was observed in the yield. This can be attributed to the low moles of hydrogen that can be produced from methanol reforming compared to glycerol one. On the other hand, a sharp decrease in the conversion was observed upon adding soap that contains 2-propanol, to the feed. This behavior can be ascribed to the soap residues accumulation in the reaction media and coke formation over the surface of the catalyst due to 2-propanol reforming reactions. A steam reforming study of 2-propanol (Isopropyl alcohol IPA) reported a carbon deposition of 280 mg C/gcat over Rh/CeO2 catalyst during a 360 min run, and that was the minimum measured amount compared to the ones deposited over SiO2, ZrO2 and TiO2 supports; this means a high rate of coke formation of 46.67 mg C/gcat h [36]. On the side of hydrogen production, the yield of hydrogen production decreased from 1.26 to 1.17 mol H2/mol Cin. This can be attributed to the reduction in C–C cleavage rate due to the active sites blockage by carbon deposits, leading more to liquid phase products and/or un-reacted feed in the outlet stream. Scanning more the plots of the main effects in Fig. 7, one can observe the promoting effect of adding ashes (NaCl&KCl) to the feed. The conversion of synthetic CG and the hydrogen selectivity in the gas product increased respectively from 78.1 to 84.1 mol% and from 72.3 to 78.5 mol%. Potassium and sodium chlorides supplied by the ashes enhance the catalytic activity by stimulating the catalytic oxidation of carbon deposits and thus providing more tolerance for the catalyst against coke formation. In line with this observation, NaCl and KCl were revealed to possess the potential of oxidizing mercury [37]. The last addition was for the oleic acid that did not show a significant effect on the catalytic activity. The conversion was found to slightly increase from 84.1 to 84.5 mol% with a proportional increase in the hydrogen yield from 1.31 to 1.34 mol H2/mol Cin. This behavior could be attributed to the similar acidic nature of the gadolinium support (CeZrGd) used and oleic acid. 3.2.2 Effect of promoter element The activity of the prepared mixed oxide supports CeZrM (M = Ca, Mg, Gd) loaded with 5 wt% nickel catalyst was also tested for the ATR of synthetic CG in a PBTR at atmospheric pressure and 600 °C. According to Fig. 8 (a)–(d), the performance of calcium promoted catalyst was very similar to gadolinium one with a very slight distinction. The conversion obtained was 84.5 mol% with 5Ni/CeZrCa while it was 84.3% with 5Ni/CeZrGd. Same slight difference was obtained in the hydrogen selectivity results with 79.7 and 79.6 mol% for the Ca and Gd catalysts, respectively. The enhanced performance of the calcium promoted catalyst can be ascribed to the reducibility, nickel dispersion and PV/SA properties obtained from TPR, XRD and BET characterization techniques, respectively. A more observable deviation was obtained with the magnesium promoted catalyst with 78.8 and 75.3 mol% for conversion and hydrogen selectivity, respectively. The order of catalytic activity arranged based on the impact of promoter elements is as follows; Ca > Gd > Mg. The non-catalytic run was carried out at an identical set of operating conditions to differentiate between the thermal and catalytic effect on the process. The absence of active sites and the accumulation of carbon deposits inside the reactor during the non-catalytic experiment could have contributed to the observed poor and unstable performance. The thermal effect (T = 600 °C) stimulated the steam reforming reactions due to their endothermic nature. 3.2.3 Effect of reduction temperature The catalysts screened in the foregoing results were activated at a temperature of 700 °C. According to TPR profiles given in Fig. 5, a lower reduction temperature could be sufficient to activate the 5Ni/CeZrCa catalyst and avoid sintering and any possible negative impacts of high temperature on the structural properties of the catalyst. For this reason, the reduction temperature of 5Ni/CeZrCa catalyst was varied between 500 and 700 °C. The activation of the catalyst was achieved in a PBTR by flowing 100 ml/min of 5%H2/balance N2 gas for 2 h at the desired reduction temperature prior to start feeding the reactants. The reaction temperature, S/C ratio and O/C ratio were maintained at 600 °C, 3.6 and 0.50, respectively. The observed performance at different reduction temperatures are illustrated in Fig. 9(a)–(c) and 10(a)–(d) . Evidently, a reduction temperature of 500 °C was not sufficient enough to completely reduce the metallic phase (NiO and CeO2) of the catalyst. The initial conversion corresponding to the first 2 h (TOS) was around 70% for the catalyst activated at 500 °C, however this was around 85% for the catalysts activated at 600 and 700 °C. Almost the same behavior was observed with hydrogen selectivity and yield results. This can be attributed to the reduction of CeO2 into active cerium atoms that usually requires a temperature between 550 and 600 °C. The second peak (∼590 °C) of 5Ni/CeZrCa TPR profile in Fig. 5 corresponds to hydrogen consumption due to cerium oxide activation. The catalyst was then partially activated at 500 °C and tends to be fully active after 2 h (TOS), because the ATR of synthetic CG was carried out at 600 °C and hydrogen was produced inside the reformer. The catalysts reduced initially at different temperatures showed similar catalytic activities after reaching steady state with conversion and hydrogen yield results of ∼83% and 1.3 mol H2/mol Cin, respectively. Taking into account the overall conversion, selectivity, yield and TOF results presented in Fig. 10, a reduction temperature of 600 °C was then selected. 3.2.4 Effect of calcination temperature In the early stages of this work, the catalysts utilized for synthetic CG ATR were calcined at 650 °C. But the results obtained from TGA analyses shown in Fig. 1 revealed that such a high temperature is not needed, as all the adsorbed moisture, CTAB and nitrates can be removed at a lower temperature. The calcination temperature was then varied between 550 and 650 °C to investigate the impact of thermal treatment on the activity of the catalyst. The screening experiments were conducted in a PBTR at a reforming temperature of 600 °C, S/C ratio of 3.6 and O/C ratio of 0.50. According to the results shown in Fig. 11 (a)–(d), the premier catalytic performance for 5Ni/CeZrCa was obtained at a calcination temperature of 550 °C. The conversion increased from 82.8% to 87.98% as the calcination temperature decreased from 650 to 550 °C. In addition, the yield of hydrogen increased from 1.32 to 1.42 mol H2/mol Cin with the decrease in calcination temperature. These observations could be attributed to the possible deformation in the structure of the catalyst due to thermal effect. The porosity and surface area decreases and nickel particles might agglomerate at high temperatures resulting in a dramatic decrease in the number of active sites [38]. 3.2.5 Effect of steam-to-carbon ratio The effect of steam-to-carbon ratio on the ATR reactions of synthetic CG was also investigated in a PBTR using the 5Ni/CeZrCa catalyst. Reaction temperature was maintained at 600 °C. The molar ratio of steam to carbon in the inlet feed was varied between 1.6 and 3.6 at three different oxygen-to-carbon molar ratios. An excess steam is usually utilized to promote steam reforming reactions, suppress methanation ones and minimize coke formation over the catalyst. The addition of steam enhanced the production of H2 and CO2 gases as observed in the product distribution plot of Fig. 12 (a)–(d) similar to results found in literature [39]. As expected, the increase of S/C ratio also reduced methanation. This behavior can be attributed to the chemical reaction given in (Equation (9)). According to Le Chatelier's principle, at low steam concentrations inside the reaction media, hydrogen will tend to react with carbon monoxide molecules to produce methane and steam and shift the system towards equilibrium. (9) CO + 3H2 ↔ CH4 + H2O As illustrated in Fig. 13 (a) and (b), the conversion of synthetic CG decreased from 78.9 to 73.4 mol% with an increase in S/C molar ratio from 1.6 to 3.6. Nonetheless, hydrogen selectivity increased from 78.7 to 89.2 mol%. The decrease in conversion with S/C ratio can be ascribed to the formation of carbon based unsaturated liquid phase species at high steam concentrations such as ethanal, acetic acid, acetol, 1,1-ethanediol and others, thus less carbon based gaseous species and consequently lower conversion results. Note that, conversion in this study is based on the outlet carbon in the gas phase and the carbon in the inlet feed. The turnover frequency decreased significantly from 0.44 to 0.28 s−1. Indeed, steam was provided by diluting the synthetic CG mixture with a predetermined amount of water based on S/C molar ratio. For this reason, the concentration of biomass in the feed dropped with the increase in the molar ratio of S/C and eventually the potency of hydrogen production per active site decreased. This setup limitation affected the results of TOF variation with S/C, but not conversion, selectivity or yield ones. The increasing trend of selectivity with the increase in S/C ratio is due to the promoted steam reforming reactions at high steam concentrations. Similar sets of S/C ratios were also tested at O/C ratios of 0.50 and 0.80 and given in the next section. 3.2.6 Effect of oxygen-to-carbon ratio The addition of oxygen to the process of synthetic CG ATR has three principal effects: (1) improves the energy efficiency by supplying heat via oxidation reactions; (2) enhances the stability by reducing carbon deposits over the catalyst; (3) moves the process into a practical level by reducing the fixed and operating cost of the reformer. However, O/C ratio is a very critical operating parameter that needs attentive adjustment, since the presence of oxygen at high concentrations depletes the production of hydrogen. The speedy kinetics of partial oxidations suppresses the reactions of steam reforming resulting in a small unreacted fraction of the synthetic CG in the feed available to react with steam and generate hydrogen. In order to investigate the effect of oxygen-to-carbon ratio on the catalytic ATR of synthetic CG, the ratio of O/C was varied in the range of 0.20–0.80 in a PBTR under atmospheric pressure. The performance was screened at different S/C ratios with five O/C ratios tested at S/C = 2.6 as given in Fig. 14 (a)–(c). The overall results of activity variations with O/C ratio at different steam concentrations are presented in Fig. 15 (a)–(d). Taking an example of S/C at 3.6, the conversion of synthetic CG increased from 73.5 to 88.4 mol% with an increase of O/C from 0.20 to 0.80, however, hydrogen selectivity decreased from 89.2 to 54.3 mol%. This can be explained by the increased flow of CO2 in the effluent gas stream generated via partial oxidation reactions, concurrently with generating water due to hydrogen consumption by oxygen molecules. In other words, increasing the ratio of O/C in the inlet feed increased the concentration of CO2 in the outlet stream and thus the conversion; but at the same time, it reduced the molar percentage of H2 molecules in the effluent gas and consequently lessened the yield of production and the turnover frequency. 3.2.7 Effect of reaction temperature Several chemical reactions were anticipated to occur in the ATR of synthetic CG. Some of these reactions are endothermic such as steam reforming and methane dry reforming; and others are exothermic such as partial oxidation, methanation and water gas shift reactions. Hence, operating temperature is a critical parameter that can significantly affect the process and drives the production toward the planned target. According to the experimental results presented in Fig. 16 (a) and (b), the performance of ATR process of synthetic CG was enhanced by increasing reaction temperature up to a certain point (550–600 °C); beyond this temperature, a steady behavior was observed. The production of hydrogen increased with increasing the operating temperature due to the endothermic nature of steam reforming reactions that possess the ability of generating more H2 than the partial oxidation ones. Turnover frequency also increased from 0.079 to 0.17 s−1 with the same raise in temperature. The concentration of CO2 decreased with increasing the operating temperature; however H2 percentage in the product gas mixture was practically invariant beyond 550 °C. This can be attributed to the promoted reactions of dry methane reforming at high temperatures. In addition, methane formation was suppressed by increasing the operating temperature up to 550 °C; beyond this value, CH4 percentage in the outlet gas remained constant. This can be explained by the exothermic nature of methanation reactions. The endothermicity of reaction (Equation (10)) explains the negative impact of operating temperature on the rate of coke formation presented in Fig. 4.

9,Statistical analysis,"3.3 Statistical analysis In order to investigate the main effects and interactions and to quantify the significance of each factor on the overall performance, a statistical analysis was performed on the experimental data collected from the ATR of synthetic CG in a PBTR setup. Minitab software was used to develop main effects, interactions and Pareto charts. Regressions and model development were achieved with the help of NLREG software. 3.3.1 Main effects and interactions A statistical analysis was conducted to discover the effects of calcination temperature, reduction temperature, particle size, promoter element, reaction temperature, S/C and O/C ratios on the catalytic performance of 5Ni/CeZrCa for the ATR of Synthetic CG. Fig. 17 (a)–(c) shows the main effects plots of these factors based on synthetic CG conversion, hydrogen selectivity and turnover frequency criteria. The performance of the process at different levels of several operating factors was shown in one plot with the corresponding mean line. The presence of a main effect is determined by the relative position of the response trend to the overall mean line. The larger the verticality of the plotted response line, the larger the effect of this operating variable on the process performance. Accordingly, conversion of synthetic CG is mostly affected by reaction temperature and O/C ratio as shown in Fig. 17(a). Hydrogen selectivity and turnover frequency are strong functions of S/C and O/C ratios, with a considerable effect of reaction and calcination temperatures as shown in Fig. 17(b) and (c), respectively. These plots are beneficial to divide the parameters into two subcategories, namely, (1) main factors, and (2) minor factors. Therefore, reaction temperature along with O/C and S/C ratios are the most significant parameters in the ATR of synthetic CG process. The horizontal trends for reduction temperature, particle size and promoter elements indicate the minor impacts of these factors on the overall performance. The possible reasons for these individual trends are presented in the parametric study. In general, the overall performance of a chemical process is a result of complex interactions among the various operating parameters in the system. In order to assess the extent of significance of these interrelations in the process of synthetic CG ATR, interaction plots given in Fig. 18 were established. Again, the degree of intersection between the plotted lines demonstrates the strength of interaction between the two corresponding factors. The more is the vertical crossing, the stronger is the interaction. According to Fig. 18(a), conversion of synthetic CG is strongly affected by the interactions among reaction temperature, O/C and S/C ratios. This can be ascribed to the controlling role of these variables over the kinetics of ATR reactions, and thus possessing the ability of driving them into different pathways. The interactions of these main factors with reduction temperature, calcinations temperature, particle size and promoter elements are negligible. According to Fig. 18(b), the variations in hydrogen selectivity could be attributed to the high interactions between S/C and reaction temperature from one side, and between these two factors and O/C from the other side. Turnover frequency is mostly affected by the interactions between S/C and reaction temperature as shown in Fig. 18(c). In order to appropriately optimize, control and design the different units in this process, it is very critical to understand these interactions and their resulting effects on the overall performance. In an attempt to evaluate the magnitude of both main and interaction effects on the performance of synthetic CG ATR, Pareto charts were established based on conversion, hydrogen selectivity and turnover frequency results. As illustrated in Fig. 19 (a), reaction temperature is the most affecting parameter on the conversion of synthetic CG, followed by O/C, S/C and calcinations temperature. Besides that, S/C ratio was found to be the most affecting factor on the hydrogen selectivity and O/C ratio on the turnover frequency as presented in Fig. 19(b) and (c), respectively. The parameters with standardized effects less than the mean value of 1.34 are not significant contributors to the overall performance. Pareto charts confirm also the minor effects of reduction temperature, catalyst pellet size and promoter element on the overall performance. 3.3.2 Model development A regression analysis was performed to correlate the catalytic activity with the significant operating conditions. A non-linear model was developed using NLREG software. The model expression is given in (Equation (11)). (11) Synthetic CG Conversion = − 330.55 − ( 0.02 × a 1.1 ) + ( 0.39 × b 4.7 ) + ( 60.61 × c 0.3 ) − ( 0.61 × d 2 ) + ( 63.36 × e 0.3 ) where; “a” is the calcination temperature in [°C]; “b” is the reducibility in [°C −1]; “c” is the reaction temperature in [°C]; “d” is the steam-to-carbon molar ratio and “e” is oxygen-to-carbon molar ratio. The average absolute deviation (AAD) was determined based on Equation (12). An excellent agreement between the experimental and predicted conversions of synthetic CG was obtained with an AAD of 3.5%. The parity chart presented in Fig. 20 shows the plot of predicted versus experimental data.

10,Conclusions,"A set of ternary metal oxide catalysts having a nominal composition of 5Ni/CeZrM (where M = Ca, Gd, Mg) was prepared, characterized and tested for the autothermal reforming of synthetic CG. Synthetic CG was prepared to contain free glycerol, methanol, soap, FFA, water and ashes. Catalyst promoted with calcium exhibited the highest activity with a conversion of 84.5% and hydrogen selectivity of 79.7%. Based on results from the several characterization techniques, the catalytic activity is mostly influenced by the reducibility and Ni dispersion properties. The catalyst calcination temperature was varied in a range of 550–650 °C, reduction temperature in the range of 500–700 °C, reaction temperature in the range of 500–650 °C and, S/C and O/C ratios in the ranges of 1.6–3.6 and 0.20–0.8, respectively. An increase in catalytic activity was observed with a decrease in calcination temperature from 650 to 550 °C. At a constant O/C ratio of 0.20, hydrogen selectivity increased from 78.7 to 89.2 mol% with an increase in S/C from 1.6 to 3.6; however synthetic CG conversion decreased from 78.9 to 73.4 mol%. Coke formation over catalyst surface was observed to become negligible at S/C and O/C ratios greater than 2.6 and 0.50, respectively. Again, hydrogen selectivity, turnover frequency and synthetic CG conversion increased with an increase in reaction temperature from 550 to 650 °C, but this increase was completely insignificant with a considerable amount of carbon depositions at reaction temperatures beyond 550 °C. Therefore, the best reaction temperature, S/C and O/C ratios were found to be 550 °C, 2.6 and 0.50, respectively. The results obtained from the statistical analysis revealed that reaction temperature is the most influential parameter on the conversion of synthetic CG, followed by O/C, S/C and calcinations temperature. S/C and O/C ratios were the most effective in terms of hydrogen selectivity. O/C and calcination temperature were the most effective based on turnover frequency results."
