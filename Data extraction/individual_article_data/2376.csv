0,Introduction,"The possibility to produce hydrogen through photocatalytic processes from aqueous solutions containing organics (photoreforming) or from water (photosplitting) has emerged in recent years as a new field of investigation and has renewed the interests of researchers in photocatalysis [1–3]. However, the simple idea that it is sufficient to remove gaseous oxygen from the photocatalytic systems [4,5] to favor protons reduction by photogenerated electrons—after radiation absorption by TiO2 particles—appears only partially true. In fact, most of bare metal oxides used in photocatalysis (TiO2, ZnO and WO3) exhibit low efficiencies in hydrogen generation mainly due to the relevant occurrence of recombination reaction between photogenerated holes and electrons [6]. Two different approaches are generally adopted to reduce the incidence of this recombination reaction: (1) The use of metals, such as Pt, Pd, Au and Cu, as co-catalysts: once incorporated on the photo-semiconductor surface, they help promote electrons transfer to protons, which are reduced to hydrogen [7–9]. (2) The addition to the reacting solution of a sacrificial organic agent which irreversibly reacts (oxidizes) with positive holes [10,11]. It is particularly interesting to remember that the hole scavenger may be also represented by an organic aqueous pollutant: in this case, hydrogen generation may combine with water decontamination [12,13,34]. Literature shows that many organic species, such as alcohols [14,35–37] and sugars [15], have been so far proposed as hole scavengers. Moreover, a great enhancement of hydrogen generation has been observed with copper-doped TiO2 catalysts both under UV and near-UV range of radiation [16,17], or under irradiation with both visible and solar light [18,19]. The results of these investigations have indicated that copper-incorporated TiO2 photocatalysts show a hydrogen production significantly higher than that obtained with bare TiO2 [20,21]. Moreover, copper-doped TiO2 photocatalysts have been used for other photocatalytic applications too. For example, according to literature indications [33] these materials are capable of enhancing the sunlight-mediated degradation of organic compounds and indicator microorganisms in water. Some of the Authors recently reviewed the intense research activity recorded during last years in the field of copper-incorporated TiO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen production [22]. In a previous paper [11], a new photocatalytic system for hydrogen generation was proposed by some of the Authors. The system is based on the photoreforming of an organic species (formic acid) in an aqueous TiO2 suspension containing copper (in different oxidation states) and in the presence of chloride ions, under artificial UV–vis radiation. The adoption of such a system was stimulated by literature indications [23] on the tendency of zero-valent copper to undergo a photocorrosive process, at very low pH (0.0–2.0), in presence of chloride ions and under UV-solar simulated radiation. As reported by Eisel and Tausch [23], the photo-oxidation of zero-valent copper in presence of chloride ions ((r1) and (r2)) results into hydrogen generation through proton reduction (r3): (r1) C l a d s − + H a q + → h v , Cu 0 C l ads + H aq , a d s (r2) C l ads + Cu 0 → CuCl aq , ads (r3) H aq , ads + H aq , ads → H 2 ( g) In addition, in this system hydrogen can be produced also by photolysis of cuprous complexes formed in the solution ((r4) and (r5)) [24]: (r4) Cu 1 + + 2 Cl − ⇄ CuC l 2 − (r5) Cu 1 + + 3 Cl − ⇄ CuC l 3 2 − (r6) Cu Cl 2 − + H + → h v Cu 2 + + 2 Cl − + e s − (r7) Cu Cl 3 2 − + H + → h v Cu 2 + + 3 Cl − + e s − (r8) H + + e s − → 1 2 H 2 ( g ) A continuous production of hydrogen could be thus imagined coupling the last system (Fig. 1 , Subsystem 2) with another one (Fig. 1, Subsystem 1). The resulting complete system allows the photocatalytic reduction of cupric ions to zero-valent copper in presence of solid TiO2—and the oxidation of an organic species, such as formic acid, used as sacrificial agent—followed by a copper reoxidation with a simultaneous hydrogen generation. The complete system makes possible, at least in principle, the generation of hydrogen through the photoreforming of an organic species which could also be contained in wastewaters. Although in the previous work [11] the possibility to generate hydrogen through the complete system was presented as proof of concept, the data collected so far indicate that hydrogen production cannot only be attributed to a simple combination of Subsystems 1 and 2. In fact, hydrogen generation was observed for prolonged reaction times only for particular initial values of some experimental variables, such as the following: formic acid concentration, chloride ion concentration, total dissolved copper concentration, starting oxidation state of copper (zero-valent or cupric ions) and TiO2 load. For all the experimental conditions tested in which initially zero-valent copper was used starting from the complete system, no hydrogen production was recorded during the run, although its formation only due to Subsystem 2 was surely observed (for this uncertainty a dotted line is adopted to indicate this pathway in Fig. 1). On the other hand, the formation of hydrogen was observed in some runs starting from copper initially present as cupric ions and TiO2 load not higher than 100mg/L. However, in the previous work [11] no detailed investigations were carried out to clearly identify for these variables the concentration range which can guarantee the best performances of the complete system. In particular, no indications were reported on the system reactivity over a wide concentration range neither of formic acid, chloride or total cupric ions (separately or simultaneously added to the reacting system), nor of pH of the solution. The present work aims at fulfilling this lack of information in order to provide the best conditions which maximize the hydrogen generation rate, which is proportional to the maximum efficiency of hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Procedures and analytical methods,"2.1 Procedures and analytical methods Photocatalytic runs have been carried out in an annular glass batch reactor (V =300mL) covered with a layer of aluminum foil. On the top of the reactor, an inlet has allowed to feed reactants and nitrogen gas, and an outlet has been used to collect liquid and gaseous samples at different reaction times. The reactor has been endowed with a high-pressure mercury vapor lamp by Helios Italquartz (power input: 125W), principally emitting at 305, 313 and 366nm (manufacturer’s data), located inside a glass cooling jacket in the center of the reactor and surrounded by the reacting solution. The effective radiative powers of the lamp (Pλ ) at 305, 313 and 366nm are 4.69×10−5, 8.11×10−5 and 2.59×10−4 E/min, respectively. The reactor has been cooled at 25°C during each run by means of a thermostatic bath (Falc GTR 90). For each photocatalytic run, a proper amount of commercial nano-TiO2 anatase has been added directly to an unbuffered aqueous solution (V =300mL), magnetically stirred, containing formic acid as sacrificial agent. The pH of the solution has been successively regulated by means of perchloric acid and sodium hydroxide additions and monitored by means of an Orion 420Aþ pH-meter (Thermo). The resulting suspension has been fed into the batch reactor under magnetic stirring. In order to avoid the undesired reaction of dissolved oxygen with photogenerated electrons, before starting the photocatalytic runs, a nitrogen stream has been bubbled into the solution for 30min for removing atmospheric oxygen. After this period, cupric sulfate pentahydrate and sodium chloride have been quickly added to the mixture. Throughout the experiments, nitrogen has been continuously fed at a flow rate ( Q N 2 ) of 0.3L/min to prevent any entrance of air into the reactor. Indeed, as previously reported [37], some Cu–TiO2-based materials suffer from a dramatic copper leaching under oxidizing and acidic conditions. The liquid samples, collected at different reaction times, have been quickly filtered on regenerated cellulose filters (pore diameter 0.20μm, Scharlau) and the filtrate has been used to measure dissolved copper and formic acid concentrations. The gaseous samples have been recovered from the reactor outlet in Tedlar gas sampling bags and then used to evaluate hydrogen concentration. Dissolved copper concentration has been measured by means of a colorimetric method using an analytical kit (Macherey–Nagel) based on oxalic acid bis-cyclohexylidene hydrazide (cuprizone) [4]. A UV/vis spectrometer (Cary 100 UV–vis, Agilent) has been employed for the measurements at a wavelength of 585nm. The concentration of formic acid has been measured by means of HPLC analysis. For this purpose, the HPLC apparatus (Agilent 1100) has been equipped with a UV–vis detector (λ =210nm) and a Alltech OA–1000 column, using a mobile phase of sulphuric acid 2.5×10−3 mol/L, flowing at 0.8mL/min. Hydrogen concentration has been measured by a gas-chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a HP–PLOT Molesieve 5A column (Agilent) and a TCD detector using argon as carrier gas. Each photocatalytic run has been carried out in duplicate."
3,Materials,"2.2 Materials Cupric and chloride ions have been introduced in the system as cupric sulphate pentahydrate, (CuSO4·5H2O) and sodium chloride, respectively. Formic acid, copper sulphate, perchloric acid, sodium perchlorate and potassium sulfate have been purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used as received. TiO2 catalyst has been purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (pure anatase phase, average size 25–70nm)."
4,"Catalyst recovery, cleaning and characterization","2.3 Catalyst recovery, cleaning and characterization At the end of the run, the suspension has been allowed to settle overnight under inert atmosphere producing two distinct layers: aqueous solution on the top and solid particles deposited on the bottom. After removal of most part of the aqueous solution by decanting it, the remaining part has firstly been washed with degassed water and then evaporated by means of a gentle inert flow. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the solid samples have been recorded by a Bruker D2. Phaser Diffractometer employing a CuKα source (40kV, 30mA) and operating at diffraction angles ranging between 20 and 80° 2Θ with a scan rate of 0.02° 2Θs−1."
5,Results and discussion,"In Fig. 2 is shown an example of the results collected during a typical photocatalytic run starting from a suspension containing cupric ions (5.0mM), chloride ions (103 mM), formic acid (103 mM) and TiO2 (102 mg/L). The hydrogen production rate increases until a value of about 8μmol/min is reached and slightly reduces after the first hour of reaction time, whereas the total dissolved copper concentration keeps approximately constant throughout the experiment. The idea that the trend observed is due to a decrease of formic acid concentration cannot be demonstrated, since no appreciable decreasing of formic acid concentration has been detected by HPLC analysis (data not shown)."
6,Effect of formic acid concentration,"3.1 Effect of formic acid concentration As reported in Fig. 3 a, b the effect of changing the initial formic acid concentration toward the hydrogen production rate and Cu(II) consumption has been investigated between 10mM and 5.0×103 mM. It is evident that, keeping constant initial cupric ion and chloride concentrations, TiO2 load and pH, the higher the formic acid concentration, the higher the maximum hydrogen production rate observed. The values of hydrogen production rate vary from 0.7 to 8.3μmol/min, at least until formic acid concentration is equal to 103 mM. Since hydrogen production proceeds through an initial reduction of cupric ions (r9), made possible by a contemporary oxidation of formic acid (r10), a monotonic increase of hydrogen generation rate is clearly expected for higher concentrations of formic acid according to the results previously reported [11]: (r9) Cu ( II ) → e CB − Cu ( I ) → e CB − Cu ( 0 ) (r10) HCOOH → h VB + CO 2 − + 2 H + As previously reported, the concentration of the organic species influences the rate of cupric ion reduction during the sacrificial photocatalytic process [25]. It can be thus supposed that reduced copper species, i.e., cuprous ones formed through reaction (r9), in presence of chlorides and under UV irradiation immediately reoxidize ((r6) and (r7)), therefore ejecting electrons ( e s − ) in the solution and allowing a prompt reduction of protons (r8). Only a moderate reduction, if any, of total dissolved copper and low hydrogen generation rates have been recorded during the runs with the lowest initial formic acid concentration (Fig. 3, full diamonds and triangles). For a starting formic acid concentration of 103 mM, a reduction in dissolved copper of about 20% has been recorded within a reaction time of 300min (Fig. 3, full circles). It is worth considering that the formation of hydrogen proceeds through two consecutive steps: a first one (r9) in which a preventive reduction of cupric ions to cuprous ones occurs with a contemporary formic acid oxidation (r10), and a second one consisting in the photolysis of some chloride complexes of cuprous ions ((r6) and (r7)). It can be thus hypothesized that any increase in initial concentration of formic acid may result into a faster reduction of cupric ions. The results collected indicate that, for formic acid concentrations up to 103 mM, the rate determining step is represented by cupric ion reduction. It is therefore enough to accelerate the determining step to have a faster hydrogen generation for formic acid concentrations between 10mM and 103 mM. At the highest formic acid concentration tested, equal to 5.0×103 mM (Fig. 3, cross symbols), dissolved copper has been completely reduced after 180min of reaction, casting doubt on the catalytic role of copper. In other words, it seems that the complete system (Fig. 1) is characterized by a certain tendency of zero-valent copper to precipitate and be not capable of undergoing further reoxidations; therefore, zero-valent copper can be deemed completely unreactive for increasing reaction times. It could be reasonably considered that, under the adopted conditions (formic acid concentration equal to 5.0×103 mM), the photocatalytic reduction rate of cuprous ions is by far higher than the reoxidation rate of zero-valent copper ((r1) and (r2)), provided that this reoxidation occurs. Alternatively, it should be taken into account the possibility that the complete system (Fig. 1) inhibits zero-valent copper oxidation together with hydrogen formation. An attempt to throw light on this specific point has been made by investigating hydrogen generation in the system zero-valent copper/formic acid/chlorides/nano-TiO2/UV irradiation at pH 1.0. The data indicate values of hydrogen generation as lower as those recorded in the system formic acid/chlorides/nano-TiO2/solar UV radiation at pH 1.0, without any significant accumulation of dissolved copper as Cu(I) or Cu(II) ions. This result clearly indicates that a photoxidation of zero-valent copper in presence of chloride ions, formic acid and nano-TiO2 does not occur at all."
7,Effect of chloride ion concentration,"3.2 Effect of chloride ion concentration The effect of changing the initial chloride ion concentration has been investigated in the range 102–2.0×103 mM (Fig. 4 a, b). For fixed formic acid concentration, any increase in addition of chloride ions to the reacting solution results into a higher hydrogen generation rate (the maximum value recorded is 8.3μmol/min for a chloride ion concentration of 103 mM). However, it is interesting to stress that, contrary to what observed in the runs with variable formic acid concentration, for the lowest value of chloride ion tested (102 mM) a significant reduction of total dissolved copper has been recorded, along with the precipitation of a reddish-brown solid on TiO2. These results may be explained by supposing that, if chloride ion concentration is reduced, Cu(I) reoxidation through chloride complexes photolysis ((r6) and (r7)) is slowed down and becomes the rate determining step. As a consequence of this behavior, the rate of hydrogen generation decreases too. On the other hand, a reduction in hydrogen production rate has been observed for further increases in chloride ion concentration from 103 mM up to 2.0×103 mM (Fig. 4, full triangles). It is known that at rising chloride ion content both Cu(I) and Cu(II) may form different complexed species, such as CuCl2 − and CuCl3 2− (for cuprous ions) [26] or CuCl+, CuCl2 and CuCl3 − (for cupric ions) [27]. The formation of Cu(II)–chloride complexes results into the occurrence of a shielding effect which reduces the radiation absorption by Cu(I)–chloride complexes. Indeed, both cuprous and cupric complexes are capable of absorbing in the same radiation range of the lamp used (305–366nm) with comparable extinction coefficients, although those belonging to Cu(I) complexes type are slightly higher (Fig. 5 ). For higher chloride ion concentrations, an increase in concentration of all chloride complexes occurs, causing two opposite effects: (i) a rise in concentration of cuprous–chloride complexes (CuCl2 − and CuCl3 2−), which absorb and photolyze at wavelengths higher than 290nm [26]; (ii) an increase in concentration of cupric–chloride complexes (CuCl+, CuCl2 and CuCl3 −) and, consequently, of their shielding effect. It can be considered that the shielding effect prevails for chloride concentrations higher than 103 mM, with a consequent reduction in hydrogen generation rate. However, only the availability of a suitable kinetic model could help to completely throw light on this issue. So as to determine the nature of the precipitate, a sample recovered at the end of a run at pH 1 washed accordingly with the procedure reported in the experimental has been submitted to a XRD measurement (Fig 6 ). Two peaks at 2Θ equal to 43°3′ and 50°5′ which can be ascribed to zero-valent copper have been observed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the solid recovered is represented by zero-valent copper."
8,Effect of cupric ion concentration,"3.3 Effect of cupric ion concentration The influence of initial cupric ion concentration on hydrogen production rate and dissolved copper concentration is reported in Fig. 7 . Distinct behaviors have been recorded when initial cupric ion concentration changes from 2.5mM to 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0mM (Fig. 7a, b). A delayed hydrogen production and a lower decrease in dissolved copper have been observed at rising initial cupric ion concentration from 5.0 to 20mM. A complete reduction of cupric ions and a reddish solid precipitation within 300min of reaction have been recorded only for the run starting from a cupric ion concentration of 2.5mM. XRD measurements have demonstrated that the solid is represented by zero-valent copper (data not shown). To explain these observations it has to be considered that at increasing cupric ion concentration between 5.0 and 20mM, the shielding effect due to the formation of Cu(II)–chloride complexes becomes more significant and lowers the rate of hydrogen production. When cupric ion concentration is hugely reduced through the reaction between cupric ions and photoelectrons (r9) (with a significant increase in concentration of Cu(I) in the form of Cu(I)–chloride complexes), the rate of hydrogen production reaches a maximum value (Fig. 7). For initial cupric ion concentration equal to 2.5mM, the less important shielding effect promotes a faster hydrogen production, but also a rapid photocatalytic reduction of Cu(I) to zero-valent copper (r9) which does not reoxidize. Indeed, in this case the maximum value of hydrogen production rate is lower with respect to that recorded starting from a cupric ion concentration of 5.0mM. A more careful examination of these data indicates that different quantities of hydrogen are produced per moles of precipitated copper ( P H 2 / P C u ( 0 ) , Table 1 ) for reaction times of 300 and 600min respectively, depending on the initial concentration of cupric ion adopted. The best results, consisting in highest values of P H 2 / P C u ( 0 ) , have been recorded in the run with a starting cupric ion concentration of 5.0mM for both reaction times. The results collected indicate that a complete precipitation of dissolved copper happens at about 600min of reaction. This demonstrates a certain tendency of the catalytic system to deactivate, as already observed in the run starting from a cupric ion concentration of 2.5mM. In other words, it is clear that, even for different reaction times depending on the initial cupric ion concentration and still in presence of significant quantities of formic acid, the system becomes no more capable of producing hydrogen. This deactivation of the system can be considered as a consequence of the complete precipitation of zero-valent copper."
9,Effect of pH of the solution,"3.4 Effect of pH of the solution Since a dependence of hydrogen generation rate on protons concentration (and pH) may be assumed, the best results could be expected under low pH condition. Indeed, proton reduction is a fundamental reaction through which the process develops. However, in most of the researches appeared in literature on copper–based TiO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen generation, the best performances are reported for basic or strong basic condition [28–30]. The prevailing explanation seems to rely on the detrimental effect that acidic conditions exert on the catalyst stability, with a continuous copper leaching into the solution [31,32]. To assess the effect on the system reactivity of pH in the solution, two additional photocatalytic runs have been performed at pH 2.5 and 4.0 respectively, for both chloride ion and formic acid initial concentrations equal to 103 mM, cupric ion concentration at 5.0mM and TiO2 load equal to 102 mg/L. The results collected during these runs are shown in Fig. 8 a, b. It is interesting to observe that both at pH 2.5 and 4.0 hydrogen production appears to be depressed and reaches zero after about 120min of reaction. For the same reaction time total dissolved copper reduces to zero and a black solid is formed on TiO2 nano-particles. Also in this case, an attempt to characterize the nature of copper deposited on TiO2 nanoparticles has been made. The solid sample has been firstly washed as reported in the experimental and then submitted to X-ray diffraction analysis. XRD spectrum (Fig. 9 ) shows two peaks at 2Θ equal to 43°3′ and 50°5′, indicating the presence of zero-valent copper in agreement with what reported by Li et al. [38]. As discussed above, in the system studied hydrogen production proceeds through a complex pathway made up of several reaction steps, the last and faster being proton reduction by solvated electrons. When pH is increased in the range 1.0–4.0, the resulting reduction in proton concentration slows down the rate of solvated electrons capture by protons. Therefore, in such cases solvated electron capture by protons becomes the rate-controlling step, thus lowering the hydrogen generation rate. In these conditions, a higher availability of solvated electrons may be expected in solution with a consequent enhancement in Cu(I) and Cu(II) reduction. In other words, copper is continuously separated from the solution through a reduction of dissolved copper species until the system becomes completely unreactive. The behavior of the system investigated may be depicted by means of the scheme illustrated in Fig. 10 . Hydrogen formation in a system containing copper in the initial form of cupric ions is strictly connected to the reduction of cupric ions to cuprous ones (Step A, Fig. 10) and the photolysis of Cu(I)–chloride complexes (Step B, Fig. 10). In fact, during the photolytic process electrons ( e s − ) are ejected into the solution and protons promptly react with them but not with the photogenerated ones ( e C B − ) . Chloride complexes provide an important reservoir of Cu(I) in solution; therefore, in the presence of low Cl– concentrations, Cu(I) more easily reduces to Cu(0) which precipitates (Step C, Fig. 10). When pH is increased, the low proton concentration makes available a higher concentration of solvated electrons which reduce both Cu(II) and Cu(I) and lead to the deposition of a black solid, formed by zero-valent copper (Step C, Fig. 10)."
10,Conclusions,"The present investigation proposes a new competitive process for hydrogen generation through the system cupric ions/formic acid/chloride ions/nano-TiO2/UV-solar radiation. The efficiency of the process in terms of hydrogen production has been studied at varying the initial concentrations of formic acid, chloride and cupric ion and pH. Hydrogen generation has revealed similar dependences on formic acid and chloride ion concentrations. The rate of hydrogen production increases up to a formic acid concentration of 103 mM. On the other hand, a huge decrease in the maximum value of hydrogen production rate has been observed for a formic acid concentration equal to 5.0×103 mM, with a contemporary precipitation of zero-valent copper. With regard to chloride ions in solution, an increase in hydrogen generation rate has been observed up to a chloride concentration of 103 mM, with a clear decrease for higher concentrations. Hydrogen production is also strongly dependent on cupric ion concentration. Initial increases in cupric ion concentration have resulted in a reduction of hydrogen generation rate. An early loss of reactivity of the system has been recorded during the run at the lowest value of cupric ion tested (2.5mM), with a complete precipitation of cupric ions as zero-valent copper within a reaction time of 300min. A similar behavior has been observed for higher starting concentration of cupric ion, but at longer reaction times. No re-oxidation of zero-valent copper has been observed in the complete system during the present investigation. The increase in pH of the solution from 1.0–2.5 to 4.0 has shown a decrease in hydrogen generation rate and the precipitation of zero-valent copper. A consistent reaction mechanism able to predict the system behavior under different operating conditions has been proposed. This study lays the groundwork for the future development of a suitable kinetic model that will completely throw light on this issue."
