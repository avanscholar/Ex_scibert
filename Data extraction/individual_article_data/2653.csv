0,Introduction,"Bio-hydrogen production could be regarded as a reasonable way for the future hydrogen energy production scenario since it can diminish environmental pollution and save fossil resources [1–6]. Bio-hydrogen can be produced from photolysis of water, light-dependent or independent fermentative pathways. Photo-hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) are considered as a promising method to product hydrogen for the following reasons: (1) theoretically has higher conversion yields; (2) wider range of spectral response(from 400 to 900 nm); (3) lack of O2-evolving activity which causes problems of O2 inactivation of different biological systems; (4) PSB can consume organic acids in wasted water to produce hydrogen so that the process of dealing with wasted water could be combined with hydrogen production [7,8]. Although PSB has the above advantages, it is still confronted with the problem of lower hydrogen production rate compared with dark-fermentation hydrogen production resulting from the low growth rate of photosynthesis bacteria and low conversion efficiency of light energy. Generally, the light energy conversion efficiency of photobiological hydrogen production is only 1–5% [9,10]. Current research focuses on improving the photosynthetic microbial hydrogen conversion rate and the unit volumetric production rate of the photobioreactor. The former aspect can be achieved by screening efficient hydrogen-producing bacteria and optimizing operational conditions and improving bioreactor structure while the latter is primarily determined by the biomass in the photobioreactor. Immobilized cell technology is considered as one of the feasible ways to increase the biomass in the photobioreactor due to its qualities of higher microorganism concentration, operating steadily and free of draining problems during consecutive reaction process [11–15]. Experimental researches showed that compared with suspension cultures, hydrogen production by immobilized cultures were dramatically improved because of avoiding large amount draining of bacteria [16–18]. Entrapment of bacteria has been widely studied because it provides an appropriate growth environment for microorganisms. The matrix created a solid framework that provides structural, thermal and chemical stability to the encapsulated cultures. Therefore, a few studies aimed at immobilized cell technologies for photo-hydrogen production have been reported. Tian et al. [19] reported that immobilization of Rhodopseudomonas palustris in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-boric acid gel granule could remarkably facilitate hydrogen production. Chen and Chang [20] supplemented fermentation broth with clay and silica gel to investigate phototrophic hydrogen production, and found 67.2–50.9% and 37.2–32.5% increases in hydrogen production rate and yield. Zhu et al. [21] entrapped anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides in agar gels to produce hydrogen using tofu wastewater and found the yield of hydrogen was 0.24 ml/mg carbohydrates contained in the wastewater. Fiβler et al. [22] immobilized cells of R. palustris in polymeric materials and obtained a doubled hydrogen production rate relative to that from liquid cultures. Dikson et al. [23] encapsulated viable wild-type and M55 mutant cells of Synechocystis sp. PGG 6803 in silica sol-gel for Hydrogen production. Zhu et al. [24] entrapped anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria of R. sphaeroides in cationic polymer/agar gels to prevent the inhibitory effect of NH4+ and found that an improvement in the photo-hydrogen production could be achieved. The hydrogen production performance of the immobilized PSB is limited by the difficulties in the light penetration and transport of substrate and product [25]. In order to maintain a high hydrogen production rate, a high transfer rate of substrate as well as sufficient light penetration should be achieved. The transparent gel granules are a suitable solid support matrix for PSB immobilizations because many interconnected pores exist in its porous structure [19], forming microchannels for the supply of substrate and removal of products. It appears that the transport processes of the substrate and the products as well as the metabolism of the microorganisms in PVA-PSB gel granules are extremely complicated due to the complex porous microstructure and uneven distribution of cells in the granule. In a typical PVA-PSB gel granule, PSB consuming organic substrate for their growth and metabolism while producing hydrogen and other products at the same time. Photobio-hydrogen generation in the interior of the granule is a process involving the transfer of organic substrate, photon and other outcomes, creating a complicated microenvironment that liquid, gaseous and solid phases coexist. Under such a situation, the counter transport of substrate, product and proton becomes critical for the metabolic capability of PSB. However, there was limited information concerning the transfer phenomenon and mechanism in the microchannels of the PVA-PSB gel granule. This may be mainly attributed to the difficulty in directly observation of PSB growth and hydrogen production resulting from the complexity of the immobilized granule shape and reactor structure. In the present study, a transparent microchannel photobioreactor was devised to simulate the microstructure of immobilized PVA granules. The main objective of this study is to visualize the colony formation of PSB and biogas formation in the microstructure. The effect of various operation parameters such as substrate concentration and influent flow rate as well as illumination wavelength and intensity on the performance of hydrogen production and substrate degradation of the microchannel photobioreactor was also investigated. It is expected that these results would give a better understanding of the colony and biogas formation of the microorganisms in the microstructure of immobilized PVA granules and establish a theoretical basis for the industrial application of hydrogen production by the immobilized technology."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and cultivation,"2.1 Microorganism and cultivation A purple non-sulfur bacterium R. palustris CQK 01 isolated from local municipal sewage sludge was employed for hydrogen production in this study. The culture medium for hydrogen production contained (g/l): K2HPO4·3H2O, 1.0060; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2000; KH2PO4, 0.5440; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.0417; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.0010; NaCl, 0.2000; CaCl2, 0.0100; CO(NH2)2, 1.6770; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.0010; yeast extract, 1.0000; C5H8NNaO4·H2O, 0.5000, glucose, 9.9000, growth factors, 1 ml/l. Prior to inoculation, the cells were cultivated anaerobically in culture medium at 30 °C for 48 h under illumination from a light-emitting diode (LED) with illumination intensity approximately 4000 lx until the strain was harvested in their exponential growth phase. The culture medium was autoclaved (15 min, 121 °C) before use. Argon was used to create anaerobic atmosphere. The initial pH value of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 by 0.1 M NaOH before incubation."
3,Photobioreactor,"2.2 Photobioreactor The microchannel photobioreactor, as shown in Fig. 1 , was used for the study of bubble behavior and photo-hydrogen production performance of PSB in the present study. The microchannel bioreactor was made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with a cover glass slide (24 mm × 60 mm × 0.17 mm). It offered a solid carrier surface for the adsorption and growth of bacteria. PMMA and PDMS were proved to be suitable for photobiological hydrogen production due to its transparency, chemical stability and ease of mechanical incising. The photobioreactor consisted of PMMA cover, cover glass, PDMS chip and PMMA pedestal. In order to simulate the microstructures of the gel granules, 125 semi-closed microchannels were fabricated on the PDMS chip. The length, width and height of the microchannels were 3.5 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.1 mm, respectively. The idea of the configuration and size of the microchannel was come out from the information from SEM scanning images in the previous work [19] and the length was chosen as the same as the radius of a real PVA-PSB gel granule produced in our lab [14]. Based on this design, the microorganism growth and hydrogen production within the microchannels can be visualized and recorded by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The substrate was supplied by the channels between the PDMS chip and PMMA pedestal with a width of 6.25 mm and a height of 2.5 mm. The PMMA pedestal size was 78 mm × 42 mm × 12.3 mm."
4,Experimental setup and operation,"2.3 Experimental setup and operation Schematic details of the experimental setup are depicted in Fig. 2 . The experimental system consisted of a photobioreactor, a light source, a peristaltic pump, a substrate medium flask, an effluent flask, a gas collector and an imaging system. The micro-image system was composed of an optical microscope (Chongqing, China, BK-300), a CCD camera (1.3 million pixels) connecting to a personal computer. The photobioreactor was connected with the medium and the effluent flask using silicon hoses. LED lamps (Chongqing, China, Ltd. Yuanguang electronic science and technology) were used as the external light source and were mounted to the topside of the photobioreactor. Four monochromatic LED lamps, emitting at 470, 520, 590 and 630 nm were used as light sources, and the illumination intensity can be adjusted from 1000 to 9000 lx by varying the distance between the LED and the photobioreactor. The substrate medium solution was fed by peristaltic pumps (BT01-YZ1515, China); the flow rate of the medium was controlled by adjusting the rotation speed of the peristaltic pump. The temperature of the substrate medium solution in the photobioreactor was maintained at approximately 30 °C during the experiments. The experiments were conducted in two stages: Start-up stage and continuous hydrogen production stage. Before the start-up of the bioreactor, all the experiment equipments were completely sterilized by formalin vapor. During the first stage, 100 mL of precultured suspension of PSB was inoculated into the fresh medium containing glucose with a concentration of 50 mmol/l, then the solution was pumped into the photobioreactor. PSB could be contacted with the solid surface of PDMS microchannels and adsorbed on it through the diffusion effect. Meanwhile, PSB consumed the substrate and excreted a large amount of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) during its growth; the function of EPS adhesiveness could capture other suspended PSB to form bacterial colony. During this stage, the volumetric flow rate of the substrate was adjusted to 1.5 ml/h. The initial light wavelength was set to 590 nm and light intensity measured at the incident surface of the bioreactors was adjusted to 5000 lx. The optical microscope was used to observe of the formation of PSB colony inside the microchannel at a regular interval time. After stable colonys formed, the photobioreactor went into the hydrogen-producing stage. The culture medium for the PSB in the microchannel photobioreactor was provided by the peristaltic pump. The whole bioreactor and pipeline system were covered with tin foil paper except the microchannels part. During the second stage, evaluation of the performance of the photobioreactor was conducted in continuous flow mode at quasi steady-state. The quasi steady-state operation was defined as a constant H2 production rate and constant substrate consumption rate to be obtained for an operation period of over 24 h with the designated parameters. The performance of the photobioreactor with different operation parameters was assessed mainly by hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yield, substrate consumption rate, and substrate removal efficiency."
5,Estimation of hydrogen production performance,"2.4 Estimation of hydrogen production performance The average H2 production rate, H2 yield, substrate consumption rate and substrate removal efficiency were used to assess the performance of the photobioreactor in continuous hydrogen production. The average H2 production rate and H2 yield are defined by equations (1) and (2): (1) H 2 production rate = Cumulative H 2 production ( mmol ) Cell dry weight ( g ) × H 2 evolution time ( h ) (2) H 2 yield = Amount of H 2 produced ( mol ) Amount of substrate consumed ( mol ) The substrate (glucose) is assumed to be completely decomposed to produce H2 and CO2 according to the following stoichiometric equation [26]: (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 12 H 2 + 6 CO 2 Then, the substrate consumption rate and substrate removal efficiency during hydrogen evolution are defined in equations (4) and (5): (4) Substrate consumption rate = Amount of substrate consumed ( mmol ) Cell dry weight ( g ) × time ( h ) (5) Substrate removal efficiency = Inlet substrate concentration ( mmol / l ) − outlet substrate concentration ( mmol / l ) Inlet substrate concentration ( mmol / l ) × 100 %"
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The hydrogen content of the biogas produced by the bioreactor was determined with a gas chromatograph (SC-2000, Chongqing, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2 m stainless-steel column packed with porous styrene particles. Argon with flow rate 25 ml/min was used as the carrier gas. The temperatures of the GC oven and TCD were maintained at 55 and 100 °C, respectively. The electric current for the TCD was 80 mA. The concentration of glucose was determined by 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid method [27]. The medium was weighed with an analytical balance (Sartorius BP114, Germany), The illumination intensity was measured by digital luxmeter (Beijing, China, ST-85) and the light wavelength by spectrometer (America, WSB 2000). The pH value was measured using a pH meter (Singapore, Manual pH 6). The morphology and microstructure of R. palustris CQK 01 colonys formed in the microchannels and the behavior of bubbles in photobioreactor were observed by the optical microscopy. The dry weight of colony was measured by the weight difference between the PDMS chip and cover glass with and without cells."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Colony formation of PSB in the microchannels,"3.1 Colony formation of PSB in the microchannels To study the formation and hydrogen production performance of PSB colony in the microchannel photobioreactor, the PSB cells were immobilized in microchannel under a constant illumination intensity (5000 lx), illumination wavelength (590 nm), flow rate (1.5 ml/h), and influent substrate concentration (50 mmol/l). From the Fig. 3 , it can be seen that during the initial stage for the formation of PSB colony, only small amounts of PSB from mainstream channel diffused into the microchannels, being absorbed and then attached on the inner surface of the microchannel, appearing a shape of short and small columnar (24 h). After 48 h, the PSB in the microchannel accumulated significantly due to the continuous diffusion from the mainstream and cell reproduction. During this stage (24–48 h), more inner surface of the microchannel was covered by the microorganisms, while the bacteria distributed evenly (48 h) in the channel. Subsequently, the amount of PSB increased continuously by expansion and reproduction, and adapted to the microenvironment in the microchannel, presenting a long rod shape, and distributing evenly inside the microchannel (72 h). After 96 h, the PSB were heterogeneously distributed in the microchannel and formed a cluster-like colony. At this time, a mature colony of the PSB was established inside the microchannel photobioreactor. From the experimental results above, it was conclusive that the colony formation of PSB in the microchannel can be divided into four stages: bacteria absorption, bacteria reproduction, morphological transformation and colony formation. In the following section, the bubble formation in the photobioreactor and the effect of substrate flow rate, substrate concentration and illumination conditions on the performance of the microchannel photobioreactor were discussed."
9,Biogas bubble behavior in the photobioreactor,"3.2 Biogas bubble behavior in the photobioreactor After the successful formation of colony, the continuous hydrogen production experiment of the photobioreactor was carried out. At the same time, a CCD camera fixed on the optical microscope was used to record the bubble behavior in the microchannels. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the bubbles formed at the vent region of the microchannels, rather than in the interior of the microchannels. This phenomenon can be explained as follows. Substrate was continuously consumed and the biogas was produced by the PSB in the microchannels during photo fermentation. This would lead to a gradual increase in the concentration of produced biogas in the interior of the microchannels, causing supersaturation of the dissolved biogas at the same place. Because there existed fluid flow in the mainsteam chanel, whereas the fluid in the microchannels is stagnant, the hydrostatic pressure of the mainstream was less than that of the microchannels, causing a less solubility of biogases in the substrate solution of the mainstream channel. As a result, bubbles would be easier to nucleate and grow from the dissolved biogases at the boundary between the mainstream channel and the microchannels. It was also worthy of noting that the formation of biogas bubbles was not uniform at the outlets of the microchannels: at some vents, biogas bubbles was generated and grown continuously, whereas at the other vents, no bubble occurred at all. This non-uniform distribution of bubbles can be attributed to the fact that the vents of microchannels cannot be fabricated with perfect uniform surfaces. From the above result, it was reasonable for one to assume that, in a PVA-PSB gel granule, the biogas would diffuse from the PSB to bulk solution in its dissolved form before the biogas bubbles were generated at the interface between the granule and bulk solution. Fig. 4 also shows that, at 15 s, more and more small bubbles formed and grew to a size exceeding the width of the microchannels (100 μm) due to the continuous feeding of dissolved biogas from the PSB colony. The diameter of the bubbles continued to increase until aggregation between two adjacent bubbles occurred after 30 s. This led to big bubbles with a larger diameter. At 45 s, the diameter of the bubbles exceeded 150 μm. It was interesting to note that the bubbles adjacent to the microchannel wall had a greater growth rate and a longer growth time than those exhibiting no contact with the wall. The diameter of the bubbles ranged from 50 μm to 200 μm."
10,Effect of substrate concentration and flow rate,"3.3 Effect of substrate concentration and flow rate In the present study, the microchannel photobioreactor comprises a vertical zone (the microchannels) for the growth of the microorganisms and a horizontal zone (the mainstream channel) for the supply of substrate. Carbon source must diffuse from the horizontal zone to the vertical one for the bacterial growth and production of bio-hydrogen, and the diffusion flux is dominated by the concentration difference between the vertical and horizontal zone. Thus, substrate concentration is a limiting factor affecting the biological hydrogen production of the microchannel photobioreactor. A series of experiments were carried out under different inlet substrate concentrations and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . During the experiments, the illumination intensity was set at 5000 lx, the temperature at 30 °C, the flow rate at 2.8 ml/h, and the pH of the glucose solution at 7.0. Various influent substrate concentrations were selected (30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 mmol/l) to investigate the effects on the bioreactor hydrogen production as well as substrate degradation performance. As shown in Fig. 5, the hydrogen production rate and yield, substrate consumption rate and removal efficiency increased with the increase of the influent glucose concentration from 30 to 50 mmol/l, then it decreased gradually when the glucose concentration further increased to 70 mmol/l. Accordingly, the highest hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield, substrate consumption rate and removal efficiency were 1.48 mmol/g cell dry weight/h and 0.91 mol H2/mol glucose, 1.63 mmol/g cell dry weight/h and 24.36%, respectively. This trend is reasonable because at a lower substrate concentration the bacteria had sufficient metabolic capacity for the conversion of glucose to hydrogen, so that the hydrogen production performance and substrate degradation performance of the photobioreactor were dominated by the mass transfer rate of substrate. A high glucose concentration in the horizontal zone would lead to a high concentration gradient between the horizontal and vertical zone, and thus the enhancement of substrate transfer into the microchannel. Therefore, the hydrogen production rate and yield as well as substrate consumption rate and removal efficiency increased with the increase of glucose concentration, and the maximal hydrogen production performance and substrate degradation performance were achieved at 50 mmol/l. The results suggest that the glucose concentration became a limiting factor for the hydrogen production when it was below 50 mmol/l. However, further increase in the substrate concentration would lead to a higher substrate load in the vertical zone. As a result, the rates of substrate consumption and hydrogen production by PSB decreased. This trend can be attributed to the fact that more acidic intermediates were produced due to the inhibition of excessive glucose supply to growth and metabolism of the PSB in the microchannels [28]. In addition, the substrate flow rate also plays an important role in the performance of the photobioreactor, as shown in Fig. 6 . The experimental results showed that the hydrogen production rate and yield increase with the increase of rate from 1.5 to 2.8 ml/h. This result can be mainly attributed to the fact that the mass transfer rate of substrate dominated the biochemical reaction rate. Under this circumstance, most of glucose in the influent could be consumed due to the long hydraulic retention time (HRT). However, further increasing in the substrate flow rate to 4.1 ml/h resulted in an obvious drop in the hydrogen production rate and yield. This phenomenon was mainly due to the insufficient consumption of the substrate by PSB resulting from the short HRT. It is also worthy of noting that the substrate consumption rate increased from 1.02 to 1.87 mmol/g cell dry weigh, whereas the substrate removal efficiency decreased from 30.28% to 20.78% when the flow rate increased from 1.5 to 4.1 ml/h. This result is understandable because a high substrate flow rate usually leads to a high organic load rate (OLR), rendering an increased substrate consumption rate due to the improvement of the substrate mass transport from the bulk solution to colonies in the microchannels. However, the HRT of substrate in the photobioreactor became shorter with the increase of substrate flow rates, leading to the increase of the influent OLR. This would result in insufficient consumption of the substrate by PSB, and therefore the lower substrate removal efficiency."
11,Effect of illumination wavelength and intensity,"3.4 Effect of illumination wavelength and intensity PSB can produce hydrogen with organic wastewater as a carbon source and sunlight as an energy source. However, PSB preferably absorb light energy within certain wavelength ranges for photosynthesis. Thus, the illumination wavelength of the light source has a significant effect on the cell growth and hydrogen production of PSB. Fig. 7 shows that the hydrogen production rate, H2 yield, substrate consumption rate and substrate removal efficiency increased with the increase of illumination wavelength from 470 to 590 nm, and decreased with increase of wavelength from 590 to 630 nm. It was known that the absorption spectrum of R. palustris CQK 01 showed absorption maxima at 590, 806 and 863 nm due to the effect of the bacteriochlorophyll α of the purple non-sulfur bacterium, and illumination bands at about 319 and 379 nm due to the carotenoid content [12]. In this experiment, the illumination wavelength corresponding to peak performance of hydrogen production and substrate degradation coincided with the absorption maximum at 590 nm for the bacterium. Therefore, the maximal hydrogen production and substrate consumption performance of the photobioreactor at the light wavelength of 590 nm can be attributed to the fact that the light energy at this wavelength could be effectively absorbed by bacteriochlorophyll α, leading to the enhancement of the bacterial activity for ATP synthesis and hydrogen evolving. The effect of the illumination intensity on the photo-hydrogen production performance of the photobioreactor was also tested in this study. As can be seen in Fig. 8 , the hydrogen production and biodegradation of substrate increased with illumination intensity up to 5000 lx, and then decreased with a further increase in the illumination intensity. The maximal of hydrogen production rate and yield, substrate consumption rate and removal efficiency were 1.48 mmol/g cell dry weight/h, 0.91 mol H2/mol glucose, 1.63 mmol/g cell dry weight/h and 24.36%, respectively. It can be inferred that a lower illumination intensity the illumination light energy was insufficient for bacterial metabolism. Thus, the hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yield, substrate consumption rate and substrate removal efficiency increased with the increase in illumination intensity. However, when the illumination intensity exceeded 5000 lx, photo-inhibition occurred and the synthesis of photopigments was reduced, causing the reduction of the ability for photoheterotrophic growth of PSB under anaerobic conditions. Consequently, there was a decrease in the performance of hydrogen production and substrate degradation for the photobioreactor. These results were in agreement with the light saturation point of PSB hydrogen production at about 5000 lx, as indicated by Sasikala et al. [29]."
12,Conclusions,"In order to simulate the bubble behaviors within the microstructure of immobilized PVA granules, a transparent microchannel bioreactor was fabricated in this study. Visualization study showed that the formation of PSB colony in the interior of microchannels can be divided into four stages: bacteria absorption, bacteria reproduction, morphological transformation and colony formation. It was found that the microchannel vents immobilized by PSB colony was the favorable sites for the formation of hydrogen bubbles. Continuous hydrogen molecule transfer across gas–liquid interface led to the growth of hydrogen bubbles. Additionally, the effect of substrate concentration, substrate flow rate, illumination wavelength and intensity on the performance of the photobioreactor was also evaluated. It was also found that the microchannel photobioreactor obtained the maximal hydrogen production rate of 1.48 mmol/g cell dry weight/h, maximal hydrogen yield of 0.91 mol H2/mol glucose in all tests at an optimal inlet flow rate of 2.8 ml/h and substrate concentration of 50 mmol/l. In addition, the microchannel photobioreactor showed an optimal performance of hydrogen production and substrate consumption at 590 nm illumination wavelength and 5000 lx illumination intensity."
