0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde to unsaturated alcohols has attracted much more attention because it is widely used for production of pharmaceuticals, perfume and other important chemical products [1,2]. Among various α, β-unsaturated aldehydes, cinnamaldehyde (CAL) is a presentative probe molecule used for revealing the competition mechanism of hydrogenating conjugated C=C and C=O bond. Theoretically, hydrogenating the conjugated C=C bond is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored than the C=O bond [3]. Therefore, the selective hydrogenation of C=O bond without attacking C=C bond is a knotty problem. Supported metal-oxide catalysts are well-known as the most active materials for α, β-unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation. However, even over the most selective metals Ir, Ru or Pt, there is a lack of selectivity to C=O bonds [4,5]. Therefore, the importance of oxides support has been drawing more attention, as the oxides not just help the dispersion of metal nanoparticles, but rather interact with metal nanoparticles and affect the catalysis. Specially, the critical role of oxides support can become very prominent when oxides cover metal surfaces forming the oxide/metal interface structure [6]. Extensive reports demonstrated oxide/metal interface structure significantly alters the electronic structure through charge transfer and decorates geometric structure to enable the steric effect, which contributes to the improvement of selectivity in hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde [7,8]. For example, Qin fabricated a catalyst with FeOx@Pt interface structure, which enhanced the C=O selectivity from 47 to 84% in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation compared with Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, resulted from the electron transfer from Fe to Pt and obvious steric hindrance effect by FeOx [9]. Similarly, Zaera found SiO2-Pt interface significantly facilitated the selectivity of C=O bonds from 20% to 85%, respect to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, while the TOF declined from 200 h−1 to 25 h−1 due to the decrease of Pt exposure degree by 33% [10]. In this regard, although the construction of traditional metal-oxide interface structure plays an important role in improving selectivity towards C=O bond, it is still a great challenge to maintain or enhance the catalytic activity due to the coverage of active metals by the oxide layers. Following progressive reports in some other heterogeneous catalysis, the nature of interface structure also attracts more attention due to the remarkable influence on the catalytic performance. Li’s group demonstrated the formation of Ni-WC interface obviously strengthened the electronic transfer in the supported Ni catalyst, in which charge-riched Ni sites activated unsaturated bonds more efficiently and therefore resulted in lower reaction energy of O=N-O to H-N-H group in nitroarene reduction [11]. Moreover, during the CO2-reduction process, Christopher et al. found the reaction intermediate HCOx decorated the TiOx@Rh interface to form an encapsulated HCOx-TiOx@Rh structure [12]. The modification of Rh by the amorphous and porous HCOx-TiOx layer greatly improved the selectivity towards CO from 2% to 89%. Inspired by the advantages of carbon-containing layers, we intend to directly fabricate permeable C@metal interface structure which possess more beneficial electronic effect and superior steric hindrance to realize simultaneous improvement of selectivity and activity by introducing CO2 into the thermal treatment process of the catalyst. Layered Doubled Hydroxides (LDHs) is a class of two-dimensional materials with the formula of [ M 1 - x 2 + M x 3 + O H 2 ] x + ( A n - ) x / n ∙ m H 2 O , which are widely applied in the field of catalysis [13–15]. The M2+ and M3+ cations are homogeneously dispersed within the layers and some of the divalent cations have been replaced by trivalent ions giving positively charged sheets [16]. By taking advantage of these characteristics, introducing catalytically active metals into the layers of LDHs can generate highly dispersed metal catalysts supported on mixed metal oxides (MMO) after calcination and reduction. Recently, we further revealed the superior of LDHs precursor method in the synthesis of uniform alloy catalysts [17–19]. Considering alloy structure also exhibits excellent catalytic performance compare to monometallic catalyst in selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde reaction, in this work, we propose to fabricate an alloy catalyst with C@alloy interface structure to simultaneously optimize activity and selectivity in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation reaction by utilizing the dual synergic effect of alloy and non-oxide layer. To be specific, we prepared PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDH as catalyst precursor which was then pretreated under H2/CO2 atmosphere to synthesize C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst. As expected, the Cs-corrected STEM images, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), Raman spectra and CO chemisorption clearly confirmed the PtGa alloy particles were well covered by amorphous carbon thin layer with the characteristics of porous and permeable. It should be noted that we also synthesized Ga2O3@PtGa interface catalyst as contrast under cycling H2-O2 atmosphere. In this case, the C@PtGa interface catalyst showed a conversion of 90.7% with C=O selectivity of 93.6%, which is higher than bare PtGa alloy catalyst (58.7%, 71.7%) and Ga2O3@PtGa interface catalyst (46.6%, 87.5%). A combined characterization revealed the superior selectivity of C=O bonds over C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst was ascribed to the C@PtGa interface structure optimizing the CAL adsorption mode (di-σco to on-top) by the geometric decoration of carbon layer and formation of electron-rich Pt sites. The higher conversion could be attributed to the permeable characteristic of carbon layer which maintained the accessibility of reactants to the Pt sites and the promotional C=O activation ability. Moreover, after 5 times cycles, C@PtGa catalyst exhibited a satisfying reusability. The main strategies of our work can be summarized to the following points: (1) intelligently fabricating C@alloy interface layer by combining H2/CO2 atmosphere pretreatment and LDHs precursor method; (2) in contrast to traditional oxide interface layer, the influence of interface nature on catalytic performance was clarified; (3) the construction of this permeable non-oxides@metal interface structure provides a new idea to realize the boost of activity and selectivity in hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde reaction which could also draw some reference to other selective hydrogenation reactions."
1,Experimental details,
2,Synthesis of PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs precursor,"2.1 Synthesis of PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs precursor The MgAlGa-LDHs was obtained via a coprecipitation method. Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O and Ga(NO3)3·9H2O with Mg2+/Al3+/Ga3+ molar ratio of 4:1:1 were dissolved in 60.0 mL deionized water as salt solution, and the total metal cation concentration is 0.70 M. Then, NaOH and Na2CO3 were dissolved in 60.0 mL deionized water as alkali solution (concentration of NaOH and Na2CO3 is 1.12 M and 0.70 M respectively). The salt solution and alkali solution were added simultaneously dropwise into flask at the same dripping speed of 300 mL/h under vigorous stirring. Subsequently, the mixture solution was aged in a flask at 65 °C for 8 h. The precipitate was separated and washed under centrifugation until the pH reached 7. Vacuum freeze dryer was used to dry MgAlGa-LDHs until it is completely dried into powder. After dispersing 0.50 g MgAlGa-LDHs powder in 5.0 mL deionized water at 30 °C under magnetic stirring, 613 μL H2PtCl6 solution (29.6 mmol/L) was added into suspension at 90 °C and keep the temperature until water completely evaporating. The obtained solid product is the target PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs after drying and grinding. Similarly, PtCl6 2−/MgAl-LDHs was obtained by using the same coprecipitation and impregnation process with Mg2+/Al3+ molar ratio of 2:1."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts The C@PtGa catalyst (Pt loading = 1 wt%) was obtained by H2/CO2 (ratio = 1:9) atmosphere pretreatment. First, the PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs precursors were loaded into a fussed silica reaction tube and then turn on the H2/CO2 atmosphere flow (50 mL/min). Next, after H2/CO2 flowing for 15 mins to remove air, the reaction tube was heated to the certain temperature with the heating rate of 5 °C/min and kept the temperature for 4 h under H2/CO2 atmosphere. Finally, the sample was cooled under H2/CO2 atmosphere protection, and taken out at room temperature while turning off the H2/CO2 atmosphere flow. The obtained catalysts were named as C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-X (X represents the heating temperature 500, 600 or 700 °C). The monometallic C@Pt/MgAlOx derived from PtCl6 2−/MgAl-LDHs precursor was synthesized under the same condition. In addition, the contrast PtGa alloy and Pt catalyst without carbon layer was synthesized under H2/N2 (ratio = 1:9) atmosphere, in which the other experiment details including heating rate and atmosphere flow rate are the same as that of C@PtGa catalyst. The obtained catalyst was named as PtGa/MgAlGaOx-X and Pt/MgAlOx. Furthermore, to study on the difference between non-oxide@metal and oxide@metal interface structure, we synthesized Ga2O3@PtGa catalysts by pretreated PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs under cycling between H2/N2 (ratio = 1:9) and O2/N2 (ratio = 2:8) atmosphere at 600 °C. To be specific, PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs precursors were heated to 600 °C (5 °C/min) under H2/N2 atmosphere (50 mL/min) in reaction tube as the same process as above. Importantly, after 30mins reduction at 600 °C under H2/N2, the atmosphere was switched to O2/N2 with 5 min of N2 purging in between and then pretreated another 30 mins (regard as 1 cycle). After following atmosphere cycle for 3 times, the catalyst was cooled under N2 atmosphere protection and pulled out at room temperature while turning off the atmosphere flow. The obtained catalyst was named as Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods X-Ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was performed by a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source of λ = 0.154 nm, in which the scanning range was controlled from 5 to 70° with a step of 10°/min. The Raman spectra of the samples were recorded by using a Renishaw in Via-Reflex with 633 nm and 325 nm excitation at room temperature. Cs-corrected STEM images, High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images and Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were obtained by JEOL ARM200F microscope equipped with a CEOS Gmbh spherical aberration corrector operating at 200 kV. The HRTEM images were obtained by JEOL JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Shimadzu ICP-75000 inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) was used to measure metal content. Micromeritics Chemisorb 2750 chemisorption instrument with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used on samples for performing CO pulse chemisorption and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The sample (0.1000 g) was pretreated at 120 °C in pure He flow for 1 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. The CO pulse were injected from a calibrated on-line sampling value. A CO/Pt stoichiometry of 1 was used for calculations. The Pt L3-edge X-ray adsorption spectra (XAS) were performed at 1W1A beamline at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with an Al Kα anode was used to collect the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of samples. For all catalysts, all fitting parameters including doublet separation and FWHM were already fixed, and the calibration peak was the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Bruker Tensor 27 with MCT detector and diffuse IR heating chamber (PIKE DiffusIR) equipped with KBr windows was used to collect Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRFIT) spectra of adsorbed CO and cinnamaldehyde. The samples were pretreated with He flow at 120 °C for 30 min, followed by the recording of background at 4 cm−1 resolution. Scanning for chemisorption over samples was conducted at 30 °C (CO-DRIFTs) or 70 °C (cinnamaldehyde-DRIFTs). Then the sample was exposed to CO or cinnamaldehyde flow for 30 min and 15 min, respectively. The spectra of the hydrogenation reaction were collected at every 60 s after purging hydrogen (flow rate: 20 mL/min)."
5,Cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation tests,"2.4 Cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation tests The cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation tests were performed in a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer. For a typical procedure, the autoclave was fed with 150 mg catalyst, 3.0 mmol cinnamaldehyde and 15 mL ethanol, then purged by high purity H2 for several times. Afterwards, the reactor was filled with H2 and heated to the reaction temperature (70 °C), then the H2 was adjusted to desired pressure (3 MPa) and keep the stirring speed at 800 rpm. After reaction, the reactor was cooled in water, and then the liquid products with biphenyl as internal standard were analyzed by Agilent gas chromatograph (7890B) equipped with a FID detector and a HP-5 capillary column. The response factors of each component were determined with standard samples and were used to calculate the conversion and selectivity. In all cases, the carbon balances were 100 ± 3%. Turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated by the rate of cinnamaldehyde consumption per number of exposed Pt sites on the catalyst."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure and morphological characterization,"3.1 Structure and morphological characterization Fig. 1 A depicts the XRD patterns of PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs precursor and the catalysts synthesized under different pretreatment atmosphere at 600 °C (other XRD patterns are shown in Figure S1). Obviously, in case of PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs, the pattern shows the characteristic reflections of LDH materials (JCPDS Card 89–5434) including (0 0 3), (0 0 6), (0 0 9), (1 1 0) and (1 1 3) facet, which suggests we obtained well-structured ternary MgAlGa-LDHs materials. After pretreated at 600 °C, the characteristic reflections of LDHs disappears, and the patterns of catalysts synthesized under different atmosphere shows the same characteristics of MgAlGa-MMO. As expected, the peaks of PtGa alloy or Pt were not observed because of the low metal loading (1 wt%) or small particle size [20]. It is worth noting that the pattern of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst exhibits an additional broad and weak diffraction peak at around 20 ~ 25°, which is assigned to the graphitic (0 0 2) planes. Such diffraction pattern is typical of amorphous carbon consisting of disordered polycyclic aromatic carbon layer, which illustrates the formation of amorphous carbon layer on the catalysts pretreated by H2/CO2 atmosphere [21,22]. In comparison, the PtGa/MgAlGaOx and Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalysts did not show any signal of carbon species or other crystalline phase. To identify the carbon species in the H2/CO2 pretreated-catalyst, the Raman analysis is employed as shown in Fig. 1B. The spectra of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 have two distinct signals of carbon species assignable to the D peak and G peak, which are located around ~ 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 [23]. Notably, the D peak corresponds to the defect in graphite and only becomes responsive in the presence of disorder. In this paper, we refer to ID/IG as the ratio of peak height, which could describe the disorder degree of carbon layer. As a result, the ID/IG ratio of 0.98 suggests the amorphous carbon layer on C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst possesses medium degree of disorder and accompanies by a certain extent of carbon defects [24,25]. Furthermore, we detected the T peak around 1030 cm−1 on C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst by UV excitation, as shown in Figure S2, which manifests the carbon layer comprises a certain proportion of sp3-bonded carbon atoms [26]. Therefore, in accordance with three-stage model of amorphous trajectory, we identify the carbon layer of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst is at stage 2 (from nanocrystalline graphite to amorphous-carbon), due to the ratio of ID/IG (in range of 0.25 ~ 2) and existence of sp3-bonded carbon [27]. Considering the pretreatment temperature could cause the difference on the carbon structure and therefore influencing the catalytic performance, another two catalysts pretreated at 500 °C and 700 °C under H2/CO2 atmosphere were also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1B, the spectra of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-500 and C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-700 catalysts also displayed the characteristic of amorphous carbon. However, with the increasing temperature, the ID/IG ratio obviously decreased from 1.09 to 0.63, suggesting the enhanced graphitization degree of carbon layer which contained less carbon defects. According to the above results, it can be inferred that we successfully constructed an interface catalyst with amorphous carbon layer encapsulating the PtGa alloy particles, and tuned the graphitization degree of carbon layer by increasing pretreatment temperature. However, the interface structure still needs to be further confirmed by the following characterizations. To make the structure unambiguous at the nanometer-sized level, Cs-corrected TEM was used to confirm the formation of PtGa alloy and analyze the structure surrounded PtGa nanoparticles. In the case of C@PtGa catalyst (Fig. 2 A), the metallic nanoparticles exposed (1 1 1) facet with the lattice fringe of 0.211 nm, which is obviously lower than that of pristine Pt (1 1 1) facet (0.226 nm), indicating the presence of Pt-Ga alloys [28]. Similarly, the formations of Pt-Ga alloys were also observed in the other two contrast catalysts, as shown in Fig. 2B and C. It needs to be emphasized that, contrast to the catalyst pretreated under H2/N2, a clear amorphous coating layer has been observed in the catalyst pretreated under H2/CO2 atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 2A. This visible coating layer was surrounding PtGa nanoparticles as indicated by the arrow. The amorphous carbon layer is extremely thin so that it is difficult to recognize its lattice fringe on the PtGa NPs. For the cycling H2-O2 atmosphere treated catalyst, we observed lattice fringe (0.247 nm) corresponding to Ga2O3 (1 1 0) plane extended from support over PtGa nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 2F, which might suggest the coating of PtGa alloys by Ga2O3 layer [29]. To further identify the species in the amorphous zone, electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) was employed to scan PtGa nanoparticles and the surrounding area. As shown in Fig. 2D, the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst exhibits an obvious peak of C 1 s-π*at 284.9 eV, and a broad peak of C 1 s-σ* at 291.5 eV which are normally considered as a symbol of low level of ordering or clustering of carbon [30,31]. Contrastively, there are no signals of carbon species detected over PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst (Fig. 2E). In addition, more EELS line scanning results of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst are shown in Figure S4, to reveal the universal existence of carbon species which possess characteristic of amorphous. The above results strongly manifest the amorphous carbon layer encapsulated PtGa nanoparticles to form C@PtGa interface structure in the catalyst pretreated under H2/CO2 atmosphere. To further study on the distribution and average size of nanoparticles, HRTEM was examined over 250 nanoparticles. As a result of statistics, PtGa nanoparticles are well dispersed in all catalysts with similar average size of nanoparticles around ~ 2.5 nm (Figure S3). According to the average sizes, the dispersion of Pt (DHRTEM) is calculated as shown in Table 1 [32]. Apparently, the DHRTEM are well consistent over the three catalysts, implying the construction of both carbon and oxide layer did not cause the difference on the size of PtGa NPs. In addition, the Pt loading were detected by the ICP analysis over different catalysts and further used in calculation of Pt dispersion based on CO chemisorption. However, when comparing the values characterized by CO chemisorption, a dissimilar trend was observed over the three catalysts. To be more specific, the C@PtGa catalyst still possessed very close CO uptake and Dchemisorption (30.28%) to the bare PtGa catalyst (31.51%), which strongly proved the characteristic in porous and permeable of amorphous carbon layer [33]. This unique feature which could well maintain the accessibility of reactants to the metallic sites in beneath is an essential condition for inheriting high conversion of the bare metallic catalyst. However, the Ga2O3@PtGa catalyst exhibits a much lower Dchemisorption (21.62%), which is generally considered as an evidence for the construction of encapsulated structure with impermeable feature. It is worth mentioning that the CO uptake of Ga2O3@PtGa catalysts is not close to zero. It suggested that the impermeable Ga2O3 layer not completely covered the active metal. This kind of impermeable oxide layer inevitably caused obvious loss of active sites and therefore led to the decrease of cinnamaldehyde conversion. To confirm the impact of different interface structure on altering the catalyst geometry, CO-DRIFTs is applied on series PtGa alloy catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3 , the spectra of catalysts are tremendously diverse. The linear/bridge ratio of the adsorbed CO (RL/RB) is calculated based on the peak areas to reflect the holistic variation of geometry structure. In general, different coverage degree of interface layer on metal surface are corresponding to the different coverage modality, the significant change of ratio is one of the potent evidences for construction of coating structure [34,35]. Apparently, comparing with bare PtGa alloy catalyst, the RL/RB ratio of C@PtGa catalyst tremendously increased while that of Ga2O3@PtGa catalyst obvious decreased. This variation of ratio could well prove the successful construction of carbon or Ga2O3 oxide encapsulated interface structure which was concluded from HRTEM images. More importantly, the opposite trend of linearly/bridge ratio between C@PtGa and Ga2O3@PtGa catalysts indicates the encapsulated mechanism of carbon layer and Ga2O3 layer is disparate. To be specific on the diverse adsorption peaks, the observed stretching mode at 2028 cm−1, 2063 cm−1 and 2081 cm−1 are respectively assigned to the vibration of linearly CO adsorbed on low-coordination, intermediate-coordination and well-coordinated Pt sites in the bare PtGa alloy catalyst [36–37]. Furthermore, a peak at 1827 cm−1 was also observed, which is assigned to adsorption of bridged CO on successive Pt sites [38,39]. Interestingly, in the case of C@PtGa catalyst, the spectra only exhibit a sharp peak of linearly CO adsorbed on well-coordination Pt sites. The absence of other characteristic peaks suggests the carbon atoms prefered to occupy the unsaturated Pt sites, thus participated in the coordination of Pt sites and meanwhile interrupted the successive Pt sites. This decoration effect of carbon layer obvious altered geometry structure of catalyst surface, which could optimize the adsorption mode of reactant by the steric hindrance, and thus leading to an enhanced C=O selectivity in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. As for Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst, the spectra display peaks at 2008 and 1845 cm−1 corresponds to CO linearly absorbed on low-coordinated Pt sites and CO bridge absorbed on successive Pt sites, respectively. The absence of other two peaks indicates the construction of Ga2O3 coating layer blocked intermediate-coordinated and well-coordinated Pt sites, which is disparate from the encapsulated mechanism of carbon layer. Meanwhile, compared with the spectra of PtGa/MgAlGaOx, an obvious red shift of CO-bridge peak in wavenumber was observed, which is mainly caused by the electron transfer between Ga2O3 interface layer and the Pt atoms [40]. To unravel the local arrangements of Pt atoms encapsulated by amorphous carbon, X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed on samples. Because of the high Ga/Pt ratio (22.7) in C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx and PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalysts, it is difficult to distinguish the signals of Pt and Ga in EXAFS spectra. The C@Pt/MgAlOx and Pt/MgAlOx catalysts was thus used as a probe to study the Pt local arrangements. As shown by the FT-EXAFS curve in Fig. 4 , the spectra of Pt/MgAlOx and PtO2 display a main peak at same peak position, which is attributed to Pt-O scattering path [41]. Notably, C@Pt/MgAlOx catalysts exhibits a shorter bond length in this region, which corresponds to Pt-C/O scattering path rather than the Pt-O individual scattering path [42,43]. To validate the shorter trend of bond length, the fitting analysis results are provided in supporting information. As shown in Table S1, the fitting results confirmed the bond length of Pt-C/O (2.00 Å) is shorter than that of Pt-O (2.04 Å). The decreased trend of bond length is ascribed to coordination structure changes due to the chemical interaction of platinum and carbon layer or oxides [33,44,45]. According to the results in above, the preparation process of the catalysts as well as the corresponding structure are shown in Scheme 1 . In summary, under H2/N2 atmosphere, the bare PtGa nanoparticles were obtained and highly dispersed on the support of MgAlGaOx. As for C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst induced by H2/CO2 atmosphere, the PtGa alloy nanoparticles are also well dispersed on the MgAlGaOx support but encapsulated by the permeable and defective amorphous carbon layer. More importantly, the permeable interfacial carbon layer interrupted the successive Pt sites, which distinctly altered the catalyst geometry. In addition, the graphitization degree of carbon layer can be regulated by controlling the pretreatment temperature. While, in the case of Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst obtained under cycling H2-O2 atmosphere, the PtGa nanoparticles are partially encapsulated by some impermeable Ga2O3 layer which caused a decrease in the exposure degree of Pt sites in an obvious extent."
8,Catalytic performance of cinnamaldehyde,"3.2 Catalytic performance of cinnamaldehyde The as-synthesized catalysts are evaluated in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation reaction at a relative mild condition of 70 °C and 3 MPa H2, and the reaction pathways for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde is shown in Scheme 2 . It should be noted the influence of active metal content on the catalytic performance has been excluded by the consistent Pt loading of catalysts (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 5 A, PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst exhibits 58.7% conversion and 71.7% selectivity for the desired product cinnamyl alcohol (COL) after 2 h reaction. In case of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst (Fig. 5B), an improved performance was achieved at the same reaction time. Specifically, the conversion reached 90.7% and the COL selectivity increased to 93.4%, thus leading to approximately twofold COL yield (90.7%) compared to the PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 (46.6%). Considering the similar Pt dispersion in the C@PtGa and the contrast PtGa catalyst, the obvious improvement on activity and selectivity could be attributed to the special interfacial effect of C@PtGa structure. To further clarify the promotional effect of the interfacial carbon layer, monometallic Pt and C@Pt were also tested and the results were listed in Figure S8. Quite similar with the alloy catalyst, the C@Pt/MgAlOx-600 catalyst also exhibits both higher conversion (53.1%) and selectivity (61.9%) than the bare Pt catalyst (42.6% and 36.7%, respectively). Furthermore, the similar trend over PtGa and Pt catalysts illustrated we chose the monometallic Pt catalyst as a proper alternative probe for EXAFS study is reasonable. While for the Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst (Fig. 5C), it exhibits a similar COL selectivity (87.5%) but much lower conversion (46.6%) in contrast to the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst. The above results illustrate that the encapsulated layers no matter amorphous carbon or crystallized oxide on the PtGa alloys could strongly improve the C=O selectivity in CAL hydrogenation reaction through steric hindrance effect. However, the impermeable characteristic of the coated Ga2O3 layer gave rise to high coverage of Pt atoms and therefore leading to the lower conversion. Turnover frequency (TOF) is an important parameter to evaluate intrinsic activity. In this study, TOF is expressed as the rate of CAL consumption per number of exposed Pt sites which is calculate based on CO chemisorption. The TOF test over catalysts was performed at the condition of 5 ~ 10 min, 70 °C, 3 MPa H2 to ensure the conversion below 15%, where kinetically controlled regime is obtained. In addition, we studied the effect of stirring speed (600–1000 rpm) on selective cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation over the series of PtGa catalysts. The result showed that the conversion is almost constant when changing the stirring speed (Figure S7), which indicates that 800 rpm is appropriate for intrinsic rate measurement. Furthermore, Mears (CM) and Weisz-Prater (CWP) criterion was also employed as shown in Table S3. The calculated CM < 0.15 and CWP < 1, which implying that both internal and external mass transfer effects can be neglected [46]. As expected, the TOF value of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 (1546 h−1) is 1.74 times larger than that of PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst (891 h−1), which further reveals the contribution of the C@PtGa interface structure to the catalytic activity. In the case of Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst, the similar TOF (866 h−1) to PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 suggests that the formation of Ga2O3@PtGa interface have no unfavorable influence on intrinsic activity of PtGa alloy. To further demonstrate the role of gallium, the catalysts with different Ga/Pt ratios were synthesized and evaluated in selective cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. As shown in Figure S9A, both the conversion and selectivity of PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalysts showed a trend in volcanic curve with Ga/Pt ratio increasing, reaching the maximum (58.7%, 71.7%) when Ga/Pt ratio is 22.7. It should be noted that low gallium content (Ga/Pt < 22.7) leads to the favorable selectivity of C=C bonds, while excess gallium content (Ga/Pt > 22.7) causes the generation of overhydrogenation products (HCOL). Thus, controlling the Ga content in an appropriate range would contribute to the improvement of the catalytic performance over a series of bare PtGa catalysts. In case of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalysts, as shown in Figure S9B, the conversion also displays a trend in volcanic curve, which also indicates the role of Ga in activity control. However, the impact of Ga/Pt ratio on the catalytic activity is not as obvious as that of PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalysts. More importantly, the Ga/Pt ratio has little influence on selectivity, which implies that the carbon layer is a more influential contributor on promoting catalytic performance compared with Ga over the carbon layer modified catalysts. We further studied the influence of carbon amount on catalytic performance. By controlling the pretreatment time under H2/CO2 atmosphere, C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600/xh catalysts (x = 2, 8) were synthesized as contrast samples of previous synthesized C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600/4h catalyst. As shown in Table S5, the carbon content in catalysts increased from 1.4 wt% to 4.7 wt% with the extension pretreatment time. As shown in Figure S10, the catalytic performance shows an upward trend with the increase of carbon content in order of: PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 < C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600/2h < C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600/4h. More interestingly, the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600/8h catalyst exhibited lower activity but similar selectivity in comparison to C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600/4h catalyst, which is still higher than that of 2 h catalyst. It reveals that excessive carbon content could lead to barricade of Pt and decrease of catalyst activity. Meanwhile, thicker carbon layer had no significant impact on further enhancing the geometry decoration effect, resulting in the changeless of selectivity. Therefore, controlling the carbon amount in an appropriate range is beneficial for catalytic performance. Moreover, to clarify the influence of catalyst pretreatment temperature on catalytic performance, the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-X catalysts were evaluated and the results are listed in Table 2 and Table S3. With increasing pretreatment temperature from 500 to 700 °C, the COL selectivity is improved from 55.7% to 93.8% under similar conversion, which suggests the appropriate graphitization degree (~1.0) could have efficient steric hindrance effect on the selectivity control. However, as shown in Table S3, the CAL conversion in 2 h showed a trend in volcanic curve with increasing pretreatment temperature. When the pretreatment temperature reached 600 °C, the C@PtGa catalyst exhibited the highest conversion, which indicating the amorphous carbon layer with moderate graphitization degree is the most desirable for the high yield of COL. The reusability and stability of catalyst during hydrogenation reaction are problems of great concern. The used C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst was collected through centrifugation and reused without reactivation. As shown in Figure S11, after 5 cycles, the conversion (88.3%) and selectivity (91.9%) of catalyst almost have no decline comparing with the fresh catalyst, which can be ascribed to its structural stability. To investigate the stability of PtGa NPs and carbon layer, the used C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalysts was characterized by HRTEM and Raman spectra. As shown in Figure S12A, PtGa NPs size in the used catalyst was essentially identical to the fresh catalysts, indicating no obvious agglomeration of PtGa nanoparticles during hydrogenation reaction. Simultaneously, the Raman spectra (Figure S12B) was collected by 325 nm and 633 nm excitation. Similar ID/IG ratio with fresh catalyst and detected T peak illustrated the carbon species have no obvious transformation, which still exhibited characteristic of amorphous. Thus, it can be concluded that the catalyst structure modified by amorphous carbon layer is stable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions (70 °C, 3 MPa H2, 800 rpm). In addition, a comparison of the catalytic performance with some representative reported catalysts for the CAL hydrogenation is listed in Table 3 . Herein, the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst showed significant advantages in both TOF and COL selectivity than most of the reported catalysts. To give a deep insight into the catalytic performance, the interface structure and role of catalytic sites should be identified (see Table 4 )."
9,The electronic structure of catalysts,"3.3 The electronic structure of catalysts To investigate the electronic effect of interface structure, X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was performed over catalysts. Fig. 6 A and 6B shows the Pt 4f spectrum and Ga 2p spectrum, with deconvolution of Gaussian peak fitting method of the samples. As shown in Fig. 6A, it can be observed that there is an overlap between Pt 4f and Al 2p peak at about 70.0–78.0 eV, however, the peaks can be easily deconvoluted to Al 2p and Pt 4f regions. The contents of Pt0 and Ga0 over C@PtGa catalyst (71.97, 32.73%) are quite similar with that of the bare PtGa catalyst (72.72, 31.64%), indicating the construction of interfacial carbon layer have no obvious influence on the amount of PtGa alloy. As shown in Table 3, it should be noted that shifts of Pt species towards low binding energy in C@PtGa catalyst are observed with respect to PtGa catalyst, which indicates the increased electron cloud density of Pt and thus formed the electron-rich Pt sites. In the meantime, the shifts of Ga species towards high binding energy in C@PtGa catalyst are observed, indicating the decreased electron cloud density of Ga. Such electronic environment changes can be attributed to the strong electronic mobility of carbon layer, which could act as a matchmaker to enhance the electron transfer from electron-donation Ga to Pt sites [52]. It is reported the electron-rich Pt sites are favorable for the enhanced hydrogenation selectivity of C=O [53–55]. Therefore, the enhanced electronic effect brought by the amorphous carbon interface layer could be one of the main reasons for the improved catalytic performance of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst. To further confirm the influence of amorphous interface layer to encapsulated Pt NPs on electronic structure, Pt/MgAlOx and C@Pt/MgAlOx are used as probes to characterize the electronic structure by XANES. As shown in Fig. 7 , the two samples possess higher white line intensity than Pt foil indicates the average valence state of Pt is greater than 0. Meanwhile, the C@Pt/MgAlOx exhibits a lower white line intensity of Pt L3-edge, compared with Pt/MgAlOx, which means the Pt has a higher electron density. It has been reported that the white line intensity is affected by the electron density and Pt particle size [56]. However, since the particle size of Pt is similar, the changes in XANES are mainly due to the change of electronic structure brought by the amorphous carbon interface layer, which is well consistent with the XPS results."
10,H2 dissociation/activation and C=O activation of catalysts,"3.4 H2 dissociation/activation and C=O activation of catalysts To reveal the difference of H2 activation and dissociation ability over the bare PtGa and the encapsulated catalysts with two different interface structure, H2-TPD was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . The TPD curves of all samples exhibit one broad desorption peak at about 360 ~ 420 °C, this peak can be attributed to the chemically adsorbed hydrogen which is strongly bonded to the surface [57]. Moreover, a peak at the high-temperature area of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst could be ascribed to the decomposition of catalyst precursor residual [58]. Notably, the center of hydrogen desorption peaks of C@PtGa and Ga2O3@PtGa samples are higher than that of PtGa due to the strong interaction between C@PtGa (or Ga2O3@Pt) interface sites and adsorbed H species. From the above results it can be concluded that the construction of C@PtGa interface structure has no superiority in improving the ability of H2 dissociation/activation. Thus, the difference in activity between bare PtGa catalyst and C@PtGa (or Ga2O3@PtGa) catalyst could be ascribed to the promotional ability of C=O bond activation. Considering the C=O and C=C groups in cinnamaldehyde are both possible hydrogenation targets, to further clarify the effect of interface structure on the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, in situ DRIFT spectra of cinnamaldehyde molecules adsorption and hydrogenation was performed. Specifically, pure CAL was flowed into the reaction cell at the reaction temperature (70 °C) for 15 min, followed by purging He flow to remove the gaseous and physically adsorbed CAL for measurement of the chemical adsorption. Subsequently, H2 was flowed into the reaction cell for detection of the hydrogenation process. According to the literatures, there are two possible chemisorption modes of the C=O bonds in α, β-unsaturated aldehydes: a monodentate adsorption by C=O oxygen atom named on-top (1680 cm−1 in this case), and a bi-coordination adsorption through both carbon and oxygen atoms named di-σCO (1660 cm−1 in this case) [59–61]. For PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst (Fig. 9 A), the peaks at 1666 cm−1 is assigned to ν (C=O), and another two peaks at 1620 cm−1 and 1602 cm−1 are assigned to the ν (C=C) adjacent to C=O bonds in CAL [2]. From the striking contrast of the peak intensity, it can be concluded that the di-σCO adsorption mode is dominant over PtGa/MgAlGaOx, which is the reason for explaining why the cinnamyl alcohol is the main product over PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst. However, it should be stressed the presence of chemisorbed C=C bonds inevitably opens the side reaction to produce hydrocinnamaldehyed and cinnamyl alcohol with total selectivity of 28.3%. As for C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst (Fig. 9B), an obvious adsorption peak at 1673 cm−1 corresponding to the C=O bond in on-top adsorption mode is observed, accompanied by an extremely low intensity C=C adsorption peak (~1624 cm−1). The different adsorption mode of CAL over C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx from PtGa/MgAlGaOx is due to the steric-hindrance effect of interfacial structure, and electronic repulsion between electron-rich Pt species and C=C bond. To be specific, under the effect of hindrance, the C=C bond in the middle of a long molecule cinnamaldehyde cannot be easily adsorbed onto the surface of Pt encapsulated by the carbon layer [62]. Meanwhile, the electron-rich Pt sites reject C=C bonds thus further decrease the probability for the C=C adsorption. This dual effect effectively suppressed the C=C hydrogenation with only 6.6% selectivity towards by-products. In the meantime, the C=O group at the end of the CAL molecule can be easily linear-absorbed on the defect sites of the carbon layer, which thus facilitated the activation of C=O. With the flowing H2 atmosphere, the signal of C=O bonds in on-top adsorption at 1777 cm−1 gradually diminishes, which further confirmed the transformation of CAL molecular. In the case of Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst (Fig. 9C), specially, the spectra simultaneously exhibited on-top and di-σCO adsorption mode of C=O. It should be noted, comparing with PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst, the peak of di-σCO mode located at 1641 cm−1 rather than 1666 cm−1, which can be attributed the formation of Ga2O3@PtGa interface structure. Meanwhile, the adsorption peaks of adjacent C=C bond were also observed. From the intensity of adsorption peaks, it is apparently found the adsorption of C=C bond was suppressed in some extent comparing to PtGa/MgAlGaOx, illustrating that the oxide interfacial layer could also alter the adsorption mode of cinnamaldehyde and thus leading to higher COL selectivity. However, due to the insufficient ability of encapsulated Ga2O3 layer for optimizing the C=O adsorption mode, the on-top configuration is not the sole mode. More importantly, during 240 s reaction time, the adsorption peak of on-top configuration sharply diminished with a larger degree than that of di-σCO, suggesting the on-top adsorption mode possesses a much higher hydrogenation rate. Based on the above results, we can draw a conclusion that the improvement of catalytic selectivity can be ascribe to the construction of interface structure optimizing the CAL adsorption behavior, which declined the C=C adsorption while changed the C=O adsorption mode mainly into on-top rather than di-σCO. Furthermore, the on-top mode, displaying a much higher hydrogenation rate than di-σCO, is considered as a more desirable adsorption configuration of CAL. Thus, the C@PtGa interface structure with the optimized CAL adsorption mode which mainly exhibited monodentate adsorption by C=O oxygen atoms contributed to the superior catalytic performance of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx in CAL hydrogenation reaction."
11,Possible mechanism over the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst,"3.5 Possible mechanism over the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst Based on the above results, the improved hydrogenation performance of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst is ascribed to the generation of amorphous carbon layer interface sites. Firstly, the amorphous carbon encapsulated layer with the porous and permeable character well maintained the accessibility of reactant to adsorb on metallic sites. Secondly, the construction of electron-rich Pt sites and the appearance of the carbon layer with defects changes the adsorption mode of cinnamaldehyde, which is beneficial to the selective activation of C=O bonds and thereby increasing the selectivity. On basis of the above evidence and previous data in the literature, a possible mechanism upon C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx catalyst can be drawn as shown in Scheme 3 . In simply terms, influencing by the steric effect of C@PtGa interface structure, only oxygen atoms of C=O bonds in cinnamaldehyde adsorb on the surface of PtGa alloy and interact with electron-rich Pt sites to form a C=O-Pt linkage. Simultaneously, hydrogen molecules adsorb and activate on the PtGa alloy surface thus form active H species. Subsequently, the C=O-Pt linkage is attacked by active H species to form C-O-Pt and undergoes Pt-O bond cleavage, finally yielding cinnamyl alcohol."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, amorphous carbon layer encapsulated PtGa alloy catalyst was synthesized under H2/CO2 pretreatment atmosphere by using PtCl6 2−/MgAlGa-LDHs as precursor. Cs-corrected STEM and EELS clearly confirmed the construction of C@PtGa interface structure, and CO-chemisorption indicated the thin amorphous carbon layer has the characteristics of porous and permeable. In selective cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation reaction, under similar conversion, the selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol of C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 is higher than that of PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600. XPS, XANES and cinnamaldehyde-DRIFT revealed the improved selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol was attributed to the geometric decoration of carbon layer as well as the formation of electron-rich Pt sites at C@PtGa interface, which optimized adsorption mode of cinnamaldehyde. It should be noted that we also synthesized as a contrast catalyst Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 by using cycling H2-O2 atmosphere to illustrate the importance of the interfacial nature on this reaction. The Ga2O3@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 catalyst also exhibited a promoted COL selectivity compared to PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600, which illustrated that the encapsulated layers no matter amorphous carbon or crystallized oxide on the PtGa alloys strongly improved the C=O selectivity in CAL hydrogenation reaction through steric hindrance effect. However, the impermeable characteristic of the coated Ga2O3 layer gave rise to high coverage of Pt atoms and therefore leading to the loss of conversion. The significant difference on the cinnamyl alcohol yield of the C@PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 (84.9%) and PtGa/MgAlGaOx-600 (40.8%) further illustrated the superiority of C@PtGa interfacial structure. Based on various characterizations, a possible mechanism considering the C@PtGa interface structure effect for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation was proposed. In summary, this work provides a new idea to realize the boost of activity and selectivity in hydrogenation of C=O bonds by fabricating non-oxide@metal interface structure, which could also draw some reference to other selective hydrogenation reactions."
