0,Introduction,"Catalytic conversion of biomass is regarded as one of the most promising approaches to solve existing issues on energy shortage and environment pollution (Jin et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2018). In this context, levulinic acid (LA) is an important co-product generated from valorization of C6 sugars (Xu et al., 2018). It exhibits great potential as an excellent building block for various downstream chemicals for chemical industry, including γ-valerolactone (GVL), 1,4-pentanediol (PDO), valeric acid (VA) or valerate ester, 2-butanol (BuOH), pentanol (PeOH), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), adipic acid, etc. (Obregon et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2017; Kuwahara et al., 2017; Bohre et al., 2015). These valuable intermediates are widely used as fuel additives, plasticizers, as well as precursors in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industry (Yan et al., 2017). Among them, GVL is regarded as one of the most outstanding biomass-derived chemicals on account of its benign physical and chemical properties and versatile functionalities (Besson et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2015; Fabos et al., 2015). Obviously, production of above-mentioned products involves hydrogenation of LA to GVL as the key conversion step (Luo et al., 2015). It has been widely known that, existing industrial hydrogenation processes are still conducted over metallic catalysts under elevated H2 pressure (>3 MPa) at relatively high temperature. Such operating conditions usually unfavorably cause facilitated catalyst deactivation and formation of large quantities of less-valued greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane. Considering the fact that H2 is still industrially obtained from fossil fuels, the use of energy-intensive H2 makes biomass conversion costly and unsustainable (black route in Scheme 1 ) (Zhang et al., 2016). Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) using renewable H2 generated from bio-substrates and water displays both technological and economic advantages, including (a) intrinsically high concentration of H2 generated from inexpensive liquid donors (alcohols, acids and hydrazine), (b) excellent atom economics and (c) cost-effective capital investment with reduced safety-risk (Grilc and Likozar, 2017; Osatiashtiani et al., 2017; Gilkey and Xu, 2016). To our best knowledge, the initial research attempts on CTH of LA have been primarily focused on using alcoholic compounds as H-donors (Amarasekara and Hasan, 2015; Yang et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2013). It is important to mention that, FA (C1) is formed as a major co-product with LA (C5) from C6 sugars and derivatives (green route in Scheme 1). Therefore, transfer hydrogenation of LA using FA as H-donor can make LA conversion processes more atomic and energy economical, since removal of FA from crude LA is not necessary (Deng et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2013; Du et al., 2018; Hussain et al., 2018; Lomate et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2010; Upare et al., 2015). Noble metal catalysts display remarkable performances in such system (Gilkey and Xu, 2016; Valentini et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2014), high price and rare existence however, hinder further implementation of CTH of LA in next-generation bio-refineries. Up to date, experimental results on non-noble metals are primarily focused on Cu- (Yuan et al., 2013; Lomate et al., 2018; Upare et al., 2015; Lomate et al., 2017; Ashokraju et al., 2018), Ni- (Upare et al., 2015; Varkolu et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2019; Gundekari and Srinivasan, 2019; Varkolu et al., 2017), Fe- (Ashokraju et al., 2018; Metzker and Burtoloso, 2015; Gowda and Chen, 2016; Yepez et al., 2015) and Zr-based (Yuan et al., 2013; Hussain et al., 2018; Yepez et al., 2015) catalysts, many of which demand a high reaction temperature (>250 °C) under vapor phase condition as well as the addition of base promoters. Therefore, emerging efforts should be put in developing more energy efficient processes for conversion of LA (Gowda and Chen, 2016). In this work, we proposed uniquely structured MnCo oxide catalysts for conversion of LA using FA as H-donor in aqueous medium. As far as we know, the structural property and bifunctional nature of Mn and Co based materials have yet to be documented for transfer hydrogenation of LA using FA as H-donor (Dutta et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2015; Cen et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2017; Audemar et al., 2015; Kasar et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2014; Kondeboina et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2014). The key finding in this work is that, strong Mn-Co interaction induced structural reconstruction, leading to a four-fold activity enhancement and improved selectivity towards GVL during LA conversion. Catalyst characterization by XRD, XPS, BET and TEM techniques revealed the electronic coupling nature of MnCoO3 phase at MnOx-CoOx interface, which is the intrinsically active site for synergistic transfer hydrogenation of LA in aqueous FA medium. Kinetic analysis for LA and FA conversion further revealed that decomposition of FA leads to induction period of LA conversion on catalyst surface, after which active H species accumulated on MnCo catalyst surface facilitate LA conversion to GVL as subsequent reactions. The results obtained from this work offer new insightful information for rational design of cost-effective catalytic materials for hydrogenation of carboxylic acids and their derivatives."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All the chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. Commercially available Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Mn(NO3)2 (50% aqueous solution), (NH4)2SO4, (NH4HCO3) and formic acid (98%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Levulinic acid was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Nitrogen (N2) cylinder was supplied by Yantai Deli Co., Ltd."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods The compositional and structural characteristics for Mn oxide, Co oxide and hybridized MnCo oxide materials were controlled by a facile wet chemical synthetic method, which was modified compared with previously reported on other metal oxide systems (Mishra et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2017; Menezes et al., 2015). In a typical synthesis, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.01 mol) and 50% aqueous solution of Mn(NO3)2 (0.02 mol) (Mn:Co = 2:1) were dissolved in water (100 mL) and allowed to homogenize by vigorous stirring for 30 min. Separately, ammonium sulfate (0.1 mol) was dissolved in water (100 mL) and added slowly to above solution. Then the mixed solution was stirred for 4 h. An aqueous solution of ammonium bicarbonate (0.1 mol) was dissolved in water (100 mL) and added dropwise to above mixture and stirred for 6 h. The light pink precipitate obtained was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and dried at 70 °C overnight. The obtained carbonate precursor Mn2CoCO3 was calcined in a furnace at 400 °C (2 °C min−1) in air for 8 h, followed by cooling naturally to room temperature. The black Mn2CoOx was obtained (shown in Fig. S1). The as-prepared samples display a typical crystal structure with MnCoO3 species as dominant phase in MnCo oxide materials (schematically shown in Fig. 1 )."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms measurement was conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The samples were outgassed at 300 °C and 1 mTorr for 4 h prior to measurements. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were evaluated from the adsorption isotherm within the pressure range 0.05 < P/P0 < 0.3. Pore size distribution was obtained from the adsorption isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of catalysts were collected on Empyrean Malvern PANalytical X’pert PRO MPD diffractometer instrument using Cu-Kα radiation with a scanning angle (2θ) of 10–80°, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. TEM and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F. The samples were placed onto a Cu mesh grid and dried in air for several minutes prior to being examined. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo Fisher K-alpha 250Xi system equipped with an Al anode (Al Kα = 1846.6 eV), operated at 15 kV and 10.8 mA. The background pressure in the analysis chamber was lower than 1 × 10−5 Pa. The survey and spectra were acquired at a pass energy of 20 eV. The binding energy of the C1s peak, i.e., 284.8 eV, was used as the standard for calibration."
5,Activity test,"2.4 Activity test The hydrogenation of LA to GVL was performed in 25 mL of high-pressurized stainless steel reactor equipped with a quartz lining, a magnetic stirrer and an electrical heater. In a typical reaction procedure, known amounts of LA and FA was dissolved in 15 mL deionized water. This solution was charged to the reactor along with a known amount of catalyst and purged five times with N2. The reactor was then pressurized again up to 1.0 MPa (N2) and heated up to desired temperature with tuning the stirring rate 200 rpm to 1000 rpm. When the reaction was over, let the reactor cool down to room temperature and collect the gas and liquid samples. The gas phase products were collected for quantitative analysis of gas-phase composition by a GC (Scion GC-456). The liquid phase samples were analyzed by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) instrument (Shimadzu HPLC LC-20AT equipped with both refractive index (RID-10A) and UV (SPD-20A) detectors). An ion-exclusion column (Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H) was operated at 60 °C with 5 mmol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution. The result is as shown in supporting information (Fig. S2). The conversion (X), selectivity (S) and turnover frequency (TOF) were calculated using the following equations: X % = 1 - C moles , L A final C moles , L A initial × 100 % S % = C moles , p r o d u c t s final C moles , L A initial - C moles , L A final × 100 % T O F h - 1 = N LA , c o n v e r t e d N Co + M n × T i m e ( B a s e d o n e x p e r i m e n t a l d a t a a t c o n v e r s i o n < 30 % )"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Surface area and pore size analysis were carried out for MnCo catalyst samples (Table 1 ). The total surface area of single metal oxide of Mn and Co is low, in the range 62–65 m2/g. Nevertheless, the surface area was promoted when hybridizing Mn and Co species, leading to more than two-fold surface area enhancement. The doping of Co species could improve the surface area of Mn oxide (Stangeland et al., 2019). And it is found that decreasing Co content could further increase surface area from 133 m2/g to 142 m2/g, which could possibly contribute to enhanced activity, as more active sites could be exposed on the larger surface (Klissurski and Uzunova, 2003). This result is consistent with the work reported before (Mishra et al., 2017; Mitran et al., 2020), which indicated that hybrid Mn and Co oxides process rich porous spherical structure resulting in an increasing surface area compared with single Mn or Co oxides. There is no significant difference in the overall pore volume of these materials. But pore diameter of hybridized MnCo oxide catalysts is obviously smaller compared with single Mn and Co oxide. The preliminary characterization suggests that mixing Co and Mn precursors could actually expose more outer surface sites which are accessible for catalytic reactions. Fig. 2 (a) shows a typical TEM image for oblate-like Mn2CoOx materials. Based on measurement of more than 100 nanoparticles (Fig. S3), the mean Mn2CoOx particle size is about 6.5 nm. HRTEM images in Fig. 2(b, c) show lattice spacing of 2.5 Å, 2.2 Å and 1.7 Å for this sample, which are ascribed to typical MnCoO3 (1 1 0), (1 1 3) and (1 1 6) planes, respectively (Ji et al., 2017). XRD patterns indicate that the formation of MnCoO3 phase might be the key for enhanced catalytic performances of MnCo oxide catalysts for conversion of LA (Fig. 3 ). We found that the co-existence of Mn and Co species in oxide samples induces the generation of spinel-like MnCoO3 crystallinity. It is surprising to observe that the lattice planes of (1 1 0), (1 1 3) and (1 1 6) for MnCoO3 undergo structural distortion (blue shift in XRD patterns) with increasing Mn/Co molar ratio (from 2/1 to 2/0.1). Specifically, MnCoO3 (1 1 0), (1 1 3) and (1 1 6) facets show lattice compression due to strong interaction at MnCoO3 and MnOx interface (Fig. 3 inset). XPS spectra data elucidates the impact of lattice compression on electronic transfer effect. As shown in Fig. 4 , characteristic peaks for Co3O4 (Co2p1/2 = 795.9 eV, Co2p3/2 = 780.5 eV) and MnO2 (Mn2p1/2 = 653.8 eV, Mn2p3/2 = 642.0 eV) were found in all MnCo oxide catalysts with different Mn/Co ratio. In addition, characteristic peaks of Co2+ (Co2p1/2 = 804.7 eV, Co2p3/2 = 790.0 eV) were also observed in CoOx catalyst. Binding energy for Co2+ species (Co2p1/2 = 802.8 eV, Co2p3/2 = 786.5 eV) seems to shift to a lower level in MnCoO3 phase, suggesting a lattice compression induced electronic coupling is strong in mixed MnCo oxide catalysts."
8,Benchmark,"3.2 Benchmark The synergism of MnCo oxide catalysts were confirmed experimentally by carrying out reactions at 230 °C in the absence of externally added H2. The calculation showed that liquid–solid mass transfer limitation can be neglected (see supporting information for details), thus the data collected from batch experiments reflect the intrinsic reaction rates of LA on MnCo oxide catalysts (see Fig. S8). While CoOx and MnOx catalysts display 37% and 77% conversion of LA during batch studies (Entries#1, #2 in Table 2 ), we found that MnCo oxide catalysts (Entries#3 - #6 in Table 2) outperformed monometallic Mn and Co oxides in terms of conversion. Conversion rate of LA over synergistic Mn2Co0.1Ox catalyst is the highest among all candidates (0.60 – 0.63 mmol/g-metal/h), despite of slightly lower GVL selectivity (70%, Entry#6 in Table 2) compared with CoOx sample. For other co-products, it was found that VA was formed with selectivity ranging from 7% to 14%. Clearly, the co-existence of Mn and Co species in mixed metal oxides show enhanced performances in LA conversion to GVL as major product, which has yet to be reported in previous literature (see comparison with previously reported non-noble metals in Table 3 ). Structural and surface analysis for such unique materials was thus further conducted to elucidate the nature of synergism between Mn and Co species during LA conversion."
9,Structure-performance correlation,"3.3 Structure-performance correlation The structural uniqueness of hybridized MnCo oxide catalysts leads to synergism in catalytic conversion of LA to GVL (red curve in Fig. 5 ). Particularly, TOF value measured on Mn2Co0.1Ox catalyst is approximately 0.23 h−1 at 230 °C. Therefore, it can be demonstrated that the unique interfacial catalysis due to the strong coupling effect between MnCoO3 and MnOx phases is critical for transfer hydrogenation of LA in the absence of externally added H2. Taking into account XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3, it is highly possible that, lattice distortion of MnCoO3 phase lowers the energy barrier by promoting HH bond formation on two adjacently adsorbed H atoms on catalyst surface (also see Fig. S4), favoring H2 desorption for transfer hydrogenation reactions (Kim et al., 2014; Jiao et al., 2019; Pang et al., 2013). More importantly, the weakened electronic binding energy at Co sites (confirmed in Fig. 4) selectively promote ππ interaction with ketone group in LA (Liu et al., 2016). Therefore, the addition of Mn species can facilitate CH bond split rate for H2 generation more efficiently in the presence of MnCoO3 phase (Liu et al., 2017; Mohan et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2013). We also studied the effect reaction temperature on catalyst activity and product distribution. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), conversion of LA and selectivity of GVL increases with elevated temperature, especially when the temperature is higher than 200 °C. However, the selectivity of GVL began to decrease when the temperature reach to 230 °C. It is possible because the generation of side reactions which could not be ignored. The effect of catalyst charge was also studied. We found that more catalyst could improve the LA conversion but reduced the GVL selectivity (Fig. 6(b)), suggesting that more side reactions occurred when more catalysts were added. As H-donor, FA is not found to catalyze any side reaction in our experiments (Table S1). According to HPLC results (see a representative example in Fig. S2), we observed the main product being GVL, with VA and other products including ethanol, isopropanol, and acetone as co-products. But the selectivity of these other products was <5%. With regard to gas products, only a small amount of CO2, H2 and trace methane were observed in GC analysis (see Table S1). Therefore, it is clear that the side reaction is negligible in this work. Considering the fact that hydrogenation of LA to GVL occurs even in the absence of externally added H2, we conducted additional experiments to understand the nature of externally added and internally generated H2 (from FA decomposition) in aqueous medium. (i) The first set of control experiments was conducted in the absence of FA at 230 °C (see Fig. 7 (a)). To our surprise, conversion of LA is very low (7% − 26%) when FA is not present in reaction medium. The selectivity towards GVL is also poor (<26%) compared to the case with FA (~80%, see Fig. 7). These experiments suggest the critical role of FA during LA conversion, even in the presence of external H2. (ii) To further understand the role of FA during LA conversion, we compared the conversion and product distribution for the cases with and without external H2. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the conversion of LA in the presence of N2 (32%) is even higher than that with 1 MPa H2 (29%) over Mn2CoOx catalyst. The unusual results observed from Fig. 7 clearly indicates that, the presence of FA is necessary for facile conversion of LA to GVL, while external H2 is not necessarily important. It is highly possible that FA interact strongly with catalysts to activate ketone group in LA molecule. Thus conversion rate of LA is more than four-fold higher when FA is present in aqueous medium. The above-mentioned unusual results motivated us to further investigate possible reaction behaviors for both FA and LA during batch studies, with the aim to reveal plausible surface reaction mechanism over Mn2CoOx catalysts. We carried out batch experiments with varied reaction time at 230 °C. Fig. 8 (a), the conversion profiles of FA show that, rate of LA decomposition is fast initially, reaching 70+% during the first 4 h of batch time. However, the conversion profiles for LA are completely different. As seen in Fig. 8(b), we observed an induction period ranging from 1 to 4 h during LA conversion, which has not been fully discussed in existing literature (Lomate et al., 2017; Ashokraju et al., 2018; Metzker and Burtoloso, 2015; Yuan et al., 2013; Du et al., 2018; Hussain et al., 2018; Lomate et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2010; Upare et al., 2015; Wojciechowska et al., 2019; Ruppert et al., 2016; Nagaiah et al., 2019; Soszka et al., 2018; Kopetzki and Antonietti, 2010). To our best knowledge, the mechanism of transfer hydrogenation with alcohols as H-donor is generally considered to follow Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) pathways (Cha, 2006; Song et al., 2015; Chia and Dumesic, 2011; Wang et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2018; Lima et al., 2016), that for FA as H-donor is however, yet to be fully understood in current literature. Due to the fact that, only a few attempts are available in literature for LA conversion in the presence of FA (Shen et al., 2010; Lomate et al., 2017; Ashokraju et al., 2018; Kopetzki and Antonietti, 2010; Upare et al., 2015; Du et al., 2011; Hengne et al., 2014), we proposed two plausible surface reaction mechanisms in the following, according to the observation in Fig. 8(a, b): (I) In the first proposed mechanism (Fig. 8(c)), FA possibly decomposes and releases H2 in the early stage of the reaction (e.g., before 4 h). The in-situ generated H2 species accumulate on the surface of catalyst, when possible catalyst activation is also occurring at this stage. As reaction proceeds, the H2 species generated in-situ activate ketone group in LA molecules. Thus conversion of LA to GVL can be facilitated after 4 h. (II) As an alternative pathway, FA competitively adsorb on catalyst surface with LA, after which decomposition and generation of H2 occur. LA have access to active sites only when decomposition of FA is completed. Therefore, induction period is observed for LA conversion (Fig. 8(b)). According to previously proposed mechanism for FA decomposition in high-temperature water (HTW) (Shen et al., 2010; Kopetzki and Antonietti, 2010), FA and LA tend to formulate an intermediate complex with water molecule. Shen et al. reported that, water molecule at high temperature may directly form an H-bond ring with FA and LA as a linker. The presence of catalyst materials, clearly facilitate such reaction. Therefore, we strongly believe that the surface reaction possibly follows (ii) mechanism, although further detailed studies should be carried out in the future."
10,Stability,"3.4 Stability We also confirmed the remarkable stability of proposed MnCo oxide catalysts. As shown in Fig. 9 , recycle studies of the Mn2CoOx catalyst for CTH of LA to GVL using FA as H-donor show excellent recyclability. There are negligible changes in both conversion and selectivity. After five cycles, Mn2CoOx catalyst can still show very durable performances for conversion of LA to GVL."
11,Conclusion,"In conclusion, for the first time in literature, we proposed MnCo oxide catalysts for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of LA to GVL using FA as H-donor, which show enhanced stability and activity owing to structural uniqueness induced by strong Mn-Co interaction in MnCoO3 phase. It is observed that the electronic coupling nature of MnCoO3 phase at MnOx-CoOx interface is intrinsically active site for synergistic transfer hydrogenation of LA in aqueous FA medium. Kinetic analysis for LA and FA conversion suggested that, there exists an induction period of LA conversion due to competitive reactions of LA activation and FA decomposition on catalyst surface. Active H species accumulated on MnCo catalyst surface eventually accelerate hydrogenation of LA, thus formation of GVL occur in the absence of external H2 in aqueous medium."
