0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic decomposition of aqueous solutions of organic substances is known to be an attractive way for solving ecological problems [1]. This method makes it possible to purify waste water containing organic impurities and to produce available chemical sources such as hydrogen. Nowadays it has been shown that many types of organic compounds may act as the sacrificial agents, e.g., primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols [2–4], aldehydes and ketones [4], carboxylic acids [4–6], organophosphorus compounds [5,7], azo-dyes [5,8] etc. A particular interest in this sphere is sparkled by organic alcohols which are the products of the biomass conversion. H. Bahruji et al. demonstrated that the rate of hydrogen photoproduction normalized to alcohol quantity is approximately constant for the most of organic alcohols [4], so one can study the features of its photocatalytic decomposition using the simplest model compounds. Earlier it was shown that the photocatalysts based on the solid solutions of CdS and ZnS and co-catalysts (e.g., ε-Zn(OH)2) demonstrated relatively high photocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution under visible light [9–11]. Moreover, it is well known that nickel hydroxide is an effective co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production [12]. The photocatalytic activity of titania modified by nickel hydroxide in aqueous methanol solutions was significantly higher than for pristine titanium dioxide [13]. The deposition of 0.5 wt % of nickel hydroxide on the g-C3N4 surface led to the increase in the photocatalytic activity; the hydrogen production rate was approximately equal to the rate over platinized photocatalyst [14]. Although extensive research was performed regarding the use of photocatalysts modified by nickel hydroxide in hydrogen evolution from organic compounds, ethanol was practically not used as a hydrogen source and sacrificial agent. Also, issues of stability of the co-catalyst based on nickel hydroxide remain unexplored. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to study the changes in the photocatalytic activity and photostability caused by the Ni(OH)2 deposition on the surface of Cd0.3Zn0.7S and to propose a kinetic model which displays the dependence of reaction rate on the concentrations of reagents (ethanol and sodium hydroxide). In the present work the photocatalysts Cd0.3Zn0.7S modified by nickel hydroxide were prepared and characterized by a wide range of the experimental techniques. These photocatalysts demonstrated higher activities than those earlier reported for Cd1-xZnxS-based samples [9,11]."
1,Experimental,
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation The Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalyst was synthesized by the method described in detail elsewhere [11]. The nickel-modified photocatalysts (y-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S, where y is a weight content of Ni(OH)2) were prepared as follows. 0.4 g of Cd0.3Zn0.7S was suspended in 10 ml of distilled water, a certain volume of 0.1 M NiNO3 was added under vigorous stirring, and after 5 min the stoichiometric amount of 0.1 M NaOH was added. The mixture was stirred for 30 min, after that the sample was collected, washed with water several times and dried at 80 °C for 4 h. The photocatalysts modified by zinc hydroxide (y-Zn(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S, where y is a weight content of Zn(OH)2) were prepared by the technique suggested in our previous work [11]. Before measuring the photocatalytic activity, all prepared samples were modified by platinum. The technique is based on the impregnation of the photocatalyst by chloroplatinic acid with the following reduction by NaBH4 (2.5-fold excess). The amount of the deposited platinum is 1 wt. % [9,11] (see Table 1 )."
3,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.2 Photocatalyst characterization The elemental analysis was carried out on an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer ARL ADVANT'X equipped with an X-ray tube with a rhodium anode operated at 50 kV. The data were processed using the QuantAS software (see Table 1). Phase composition of the catalysts was analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The XRD patterns were recorded on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation. Scanning was performed in the 2Θ range from 15° to 65° with a step of 0.05° and the acquisition time of 10 s at each point. The specific surface area SBET was calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at the liquid-nitrogen temperature with an automatic ASAP 2400 Sorptometer (Micromeritics, USA). The HRTEM images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope operated at the accelerating voltage of 200 kV that provided a lattice resolution of 0.14 nm. The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Cary 100 (Varian) UV/VIS spectrometer with an integrating sphere Labsphere DRA-CA-30I with a standard reference USRS-99-010 in a wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm. The XPS measurements were performed using a photoelectron spectrometer (SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH, Germany) equipped with PHOIBOS-150-MCD-9 hemispherical energy analyser and X-ray source XR50 with double Al/Mg anode. The samples were supported onto the double-sided conducting copper scotch tape. Binding energy (BE) scale was preliminarily calibrated by the positions of the peaks of Au4f7/2 (BE = 84.0 eV) and Cu2p3/2 (BE = 932.67 eV) core levels. The valence band and core-level spectra were obtained using AlKα irradiation (hν = 1486.6 eV; 200 W). The binding energy of peaks was calibrated by the position of the C1s peak at 284.8 eV corresponding to the hydrocarbons presented on the samples surface. Spectra analysis and peak fitting were performed with XPS Peak 4.1 software [15]. For the quantitative analysis the integral intensities of the spectra were corrected by their respective atomic sensitivity factors [16]."
4,Measurements of the photocatalytic activity,"2.3 Measurements of the photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen from the aqueous solution of ethanol was studied by the method described earlier [11]. The water suspension of the photocatalyst suspension in water-ethanol-NaOH solution was placed into a sealed reactor and illuminated with a 450-nm LED. Before the reaction, the suspension was bubbled with argon for 30 min to remove oxygen. The ethanol content varied from 0 to 70 vol. %, the concentration of NaOH varied from 0 to 1 M (the maximum concentration of sodium hydroxide is limited by its solubility in aqueous ethanol solutions); the catalyst concentration was 0.5 g L−1; the temperature was 20 °C. The concentration of hydrogen was measured with a gas chromatograph ‘Chromos GCh-1000′ equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, a zeolite column and argon as the carrier gas. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated by the following formula: (1) A Q E = 2 ⋅ W 0 N p h ⋅ 100 % , where W0 is the rate of produced hydrogen in μmol/min, and Nph is the incident photon flux. In our experimental conditions the photon flux was measured by a portable spectroradiometer (ILT950, ILT) and was equal to 49 μE/min (λmax = 450 nm)."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Characterization of the Ni(OH)2-modified photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the Ni(OH)2-modified photocatalysts The phase composition of the prepared photocatalysts was investigated by the XRD technique. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the NiOH-y samples. The XRD patterns of the pristine Cd0.3Zn0.7S and 10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalysts are the same and exhibit only three broad peaks at 2ϴ = 28°, 44°, 53° that are typical of the solid solutions of cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide with disordered structure [17]. The average crystallite size was determined using a calibration graph showing the dependence of FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the first diffraction peak on crystallite size (see Fig. S1). The graph was plotted on the base of XRD patterns simulated for sulfide crystallites with disordered structure using the software developed earlier [18]. These calculations were performed on the base of the model of 1D-disordered crystal. Such a model can describe stacking faults and other planar defects and also finite size of coherently scattering domains [18]. The average crystallite sizes of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S phase are 2.1 nm for Cd0.3Zn0.7S and 2.0–2.3 nm for the y-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalysts as shown in Fig. S1. When the content of nickel hydroxide reaches 20%, the peaks of β-Ni(OH)2 could be identified (Fig. 1). For nickel hydroxide there are both sharp and broad peaks in XRD pattern; it is might be due to the structural disorder in the sample. It has been shown that the broadening of the (001) reflection occurs because of the insertion of water molecules between the layers; turbostatic disorder arising from the random orientation of the layers about the c-axis leads to the broadening of (101) and (102) reflections [19]. Due to the structural disorder the average crystallite size should be calculated along the c-axis and in the orthogonal direction [19]. The average crystallite sizes calculated from the diffraction peaks (001) and (101) are 2.3 nm and 9.8 nm for 30-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S, 2.8 nm and 10.3 nm for 60-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S, respectively. The textural properties of the synthesized photocatalysts are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 shows that the specific surface area of the pristine Cd0.3Zn0.7S is 126 m2/g, for the Ni(OH)2-modified samples these values are in the range of 97-164 m2/g. The nickel hydroxide formation on the Cd0.3Zn0.7S surface leads to the increase of the surface area; however, when the Ni(OH)2 content was higher than 30 wt. % this value falls due to the decrease of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S nanoparticle amount and the growth of the Ni(OH)2 particles with the bigger average particle sizes. The pore volumes of all the photocatalysts are 0.21 – 0.25 cm3/g as shown in Table 1. The high surface area and pore volume are beneficial to the effective photocatalytic hydrogen production. The optical properties of the prepared samples were studied by the DRS technique. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of pristine Cd0.3Zn0.7S, y-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S, and Ni(OH)2 samples. The spectrum of Cd0.3Zn0.7S is typical of the solid solution of CdS and ZnS [20] and demonstrates the presence of only one phase in the sample. Additionally, the absorption at the 500–800 nm regions is observed in the spectra of all Ni-contained photocatalysts. These features can be assigned to Ni(II) d – d transitions in nickel hydroxide [13]. Besides, the deposition of nickel hydroxide on the Cd0.3Zn0.7S surface redshifts the absorption edge from 450 nm (for bare Cd0.3Zn0.7S) to 480 nm for 40-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S due to the interfacial charge transfer from the conduction band of the sulfide photocatalyst to the Ni(OH)2 phase. The 1% Pt/10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalyst was also investigated by TEM, HRTEM, and XPS techniques. Fig. 3 a demonstrates that nickel hydroxide forms the elongated plates (their length estimated by 300–400 nm) that overlap one another. The lattice spacing of 0.27 nm observed in Fig. 3b is corresponding to the (100) plane of the β-Ni(OH)2 phase. Fig. 3c shows the presence of the other phase with the lattice spacing of 0.31-0.33 nm corresponding to the (100) plane of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalyst. The obtained data confirm the phase composition identified by the XRD and DRS methods. Fig. S2 shows the distribution of Pt nanoparticle sizes in the 1% Pt/y-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S (y = 10–40 wt%) photocatalyst. One can see that the average metal particle size is 1.5–1.9 nm for all samples (Table 1). Note that for the photocatalyst 1% Pt/10%Zn(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S platinum particle size is equal to 1.6 ± 0.3 nm [11]. To analyze chemical composition of the samples and to investigate the oxidation state of nickel on the photocatalyst surface the XPS measurements of 1%Pt/10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S were carried out. Analysis of the survey photoelectron spectra (see Fig. S3) shows presence of Cd, Zn, Ni, Pt, S, O, and C on the surface. It should be mentioned that other elements were not detected in the survey spectra as shown in Figs. S3–S4. The Cd3d5/2 , Zn2p3/2 , and S2p3/2 binding energies are equal to 405.3, 1022.3, and 161.7 eV, respectively, which is typical of cadmium and zinc sulfides [21]. The atomic ratio of Cd to Zn is close to 3:7, which is in good agreement with the chemical composition of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalyst (Table 2 ). The peak observed at 72.2 eV corresponds to metallic platinum with high dispersity as was demonstrated in the previous work [10]. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of Ni2p of the 1%Pt/10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S sample. The peaks centered at 856.1 and 853.0 eV correspond to Ni2+ in Ni(OH)2 [22,23] and metallic nickel [24], respectively. Note that the [Ni°]/[Ni2+] ratio is very low. The presence of metallic nickel in the sample can be attributed to partial reduction of nickel hydroxide when the excess of NaBH4 was added at the stage of the platinum deposition. Thus, the XPS data are consistent with the data obtained by the XRD, DRS, and TEM techniques."
7,Photocatalytic performance over the 1%Pt/y-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S samples,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance over the 1%Pt/y-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S samples The photocatalysts modified by nickel hydroxide were tested in the photocatalytic hydrogen production from ethanol aqueous solutions. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the reaction rate on the Ni(OH)2 content. Kinetic data for 1%Pt/y-Zn(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S samples were added for comparison because these samples were tested previously at the same conditions and demonstrated very good results [11]. The reaction rate grows with the increase of the co-catalyst content, reaches a maximum, and after that declines for both hydroxides. This volcano-type trend is typical of the deposited photocatalysts [25]. The growth of the photocatalytic activity is caused by the increase in the interactions at the interfaces of Cd0.3Zn0.7S and metal hydroxides. According to the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers is observed for the 1%Pt/y-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S samples; its role in the reaction mechanism is discussed below. For the 1%Pt/y-Zn(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalysts the grow of the zinc hydroxide content leads to the increase in interphases between Cd0.3Zn0.7S and Zn(OH)2 and the amounts of the realized heterojunctions [11]. The optimal amount of metal hydroxides is 10 wt. % for both co-catalysts. The fall of the hydrogen production rate with the further grow of the co-catalyst content is assigned to its excessive amount. The redundant quantity of the co-catalyst can enhance the light scattering and hinder light absorption, therefore, the photocatalytic activity declines. Moreover, excessive co-catalyst nanoparticles may act as recombination centers for photogenerated electrons and holes therefore decreasing the photocatalytic activity. Note that the nickel-modified photocatalysts are more active than the zinc-containing samples, thus the further experiments were carried out with the use of only Ni(OH)2 co-catalyst. It is important to define how the reaction rate and the specific photocatalytic activity per surface area depend on the Ni(OH)2 content. Table 1 shows that these values have a volcano-type dependence, but for the catalytic activity the maximum is observed at y = 10, while for the specific photocatalytic activity the highest value is achieved at y = 30. The specific surface area plays an important role in the photocatalysis. However, for the studied samples the increase in the specific surface area is not always accompanied by the improvement in the photocatalytic activity. Table 3 shows that this trend is observed for different earlier described nickel-modified photocatalysts [27,29–39]. Probably, this fact is caused by the complex nature of the realizing photocatalytic reaction. Along with the reagent adsorption the transfer of the photoinduced electrons is a crucial factor for the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. This parameter may be determined by the area of the interface contacts in multiphase photocatalysts, the nature of the photocatalyst and co-catalysts, the surface structure, and the nature of sacrificial reagents [2,5]. The mechanism of the improvement in the photocatalytic activity of the Ni(OH)2-modified photocatalysts is studied in detail. For this purpose, the phase composition of fresh 1%Pt/10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S and 1%Pt/10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S after six and four runs of irradiation was analyzed by the HRTEM and XPS techniques. Fig. 3d shows the formation of high dispersed nickel oxide particles (their length is approximately 5–10 nm) with lattice spacing of 0.22 and 0.24 nm corresponding to (012) and (101) crystal planes. Fig. 4 demonstrates that after photocatalytic reaction nickel on the surface exists in two forms: the metallic one and nickel hydroxide. Simultaneously the nickel content on the surface or atomic ratio [Ni]/([Cd]+[Zn]) increases from 0.14 to 0.25 as shown in Table 2. Probably, these observations may be explained by reduction of nickel hydroxide to metallic nickel with the simultaneous decrease in the particle size as depicted in Graphical Abstract. The potential (−0.23 V vs. NHE) of Ni2+/Ni° is less negative than the conduction band level of Cd0.3Zn0.7S (−0.62 V [26]), thus the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band can transfer to Ni(OH)2 and then effectively reduce it to Ni° [27]. Highly dispersive metallic nickel is known to have a high reactivity and oxidize in air at the stages of the photocatalyst washing and drying to nickel hydroxide [22] identified by the XPS method. The nanoparticles of nickel hydroxide under conditions of the TEM experiments are likely to transform into the oxide identified by the TEM method. It is interesting to define the influence of the metallic nickel formation on the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Fig. 6 demonstrates the time course of hydrogen evolution during six 1.5-h photocatalytic runs. Fig. 6 shows the increase in the reaction rate on 1%Pt/10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S during the first five runs. Simultaneously, nickel hydroxide transforms to the metallic nickel, therefore, the Ni formation on the photocatalyst surface leads to the growth of the hydrogen evolution rate. In opposite, the photocatalytic activity of 1%Pt/Cd0.3Zn0.7S decreases gradually as demonstrated in Fig. 6. This effect is likely caused by the photocorrosion of Cd1-xZnxS, zinc leaching from the structure, and the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles [10]. Thus, the Ni(OH)2 deposition improves the photostability and the photocatalytic activity of pristine solid solution of cadmium and zinc sulfide."
8,Kinetic model for the hydrogen photoproduction,"Along with the co-catalyst deposition, the optimization of the experimental conditions allows reaching high efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen production. In the present work we measured the reaction rate of hydrogen photoproduction varying the ethanol content (0–70 vol. %) and the NaOH concentration (0–1 M). Fig. 7 demonstrates the influence of the ethanol content on the hydrogen production rate, where the solid line corresponds to the approximation of the experimental data by semi-empirical kinetic model described in detail below. It could be seen that the rate of the photocatalytic hydrogen production grows with the increase in the ethanol concentration and reaches a maximum at 50 vol. % of ethanol solution. The highest values of the photocatalytic activity and the apparent quantum efficiency are 9.6 mmol g−1 h−1 and 32.6%, respectively, and exceeds similar values which were recently reported [10,12,28–39] as shown in Table 3. Further increase in the ethanol concentration leads to the decrease in the catalytic activity due to the almost complete occupancy of the adsorption sites by the organic molecule as was observed for the glycerol [40]. Earlier it was shown that the influence of the organic alcohol content on the hydrogen photoproduction could be described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for the monomolecular processes (Eq. (2)) [40]: (2) W = k × K E t O H × C E t O H 0 1 + K E t O H × C E t O H 0 where W is the initial H2 production rate (μmol/min), k is the apparent rate constant (μmol/min), KEtOH is the adsorption constant of ethanol (M−1), and C°EtOH is the initial concentration of ethanol (M). The main feature of Langmuir-Hinshelwood model is that it corresponds to kinetic curve with saturation-like character, i.e. the reaction rate reaches a maximum at high reagents concentration levels. However, the experimental data do not satisfy this rule. The dependence of the reaction rate on the substrate concentration has a maximum at 50 vol. %, and then begins to fall. This phenomenon was observed earlier by N. Strataki et al. for ethanol [41] and T. P. Lyubina with co-authors for glycerol [40]. We suppose that such behavior could be explained by the assumption that the first stage of the ethanol decomposition is a second-order reaction: (I) Z-CH3CH2OH + Z → Z-CH3CH2O + Z-H, where Z denotes the free surface site while Z−CH3CH2OH, Z−CH3CH2O∙, Z-H∙ denotes adsorbed CH3CH2OH, CH3CH2O∙, and H∙ species. For this assumption to be fulfilled, it is necessary to have the adsorbed ethanol molecule and free surface site which are close to each other for the reaction (I) to be realized. Let us assume that the reaction (I) is a rate-limiting stage; then the dependence of the hydrogen photoproduction on the ethanol concentration could be approximated with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for the bimolecular processes (Eq. (3)): (3) W = k × K E t O H × C E t O H 0 1 + K E t O H × C E t O H 0 2 , Dashed and solid lines in Fig. 7 correspond to the approximation of the experimental data by Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. The approximation parameters are given in Table 4 . As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4, the kinetic data can be described by both models with a good convergence but the approximation parameters have smaller calculation errors when Eq. (3) is used for the fitting. Moreover, the correlation coefficient obtained by the fitting with the use of Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for bimolecular processes have higher values than when the monomolecular approximation is used. These facts confirm that the bimolecular approximation should be used for the mathematical description of the kinetic data. Fig. 8 demonstrates the influence of the NaOH concentration on the hydrogen photoproduction rate. The solid line corresponds to the theoretical approximation of the experimental data with linear dependence. The first point showing the reaction rate in the absence of NaOH, which is not taken into account in the approximation due to the state of the surface. The isoelectric points for ZnS and CdS are in the region of 3.0–8.5 [42]. For all points which are approximated by Eq. 4 pH > 12.6. Thus, the surface of the photocatalysts exists mainly in ≡Zn−OH or ≡Zn-O− and ≡Cd−OH or ≡Cd-O− forms [43], whereas for the first point (pH ∼ 7) the surface consists of S2− groups. As shown in Fig. 8, the dependence of the hydrogen photoproduction rate on the NaOH concentration could be approximated by the linear fitting with a high accuracy. One can see that the H2 production rate increases with the increase of NaOH concentration. The amount of hydroxyl radicals formed in the reaction between hydroxide anions and photoinduced holes grows with the NaOH concentration. With the growth of the hydroxide radical concentration its oxidizing ability grows as well as the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production [45]. In this way the empirical equation could be proposed for the dependence of the hydrogen photocatalytic evolution rate on sodium hydroxide concentration: (4) W = A + B × [ O H − ] where A and B are the apparent rate constants. Fig. 9 shows that the proposed dependence allows one to describe the kinetic dependences with high accuracy for organic alcohols such as methanol [44] and ethanol [45]. The dependence of the hydrogen production rate on the concentrations of sodium hydroxide and ethanol can be described by the combined form of Eqs. (2) and (3): (5) W = α + β × [ O H − ] × C E t O H 0 1 + K E t O H × C E t O H 0 2 where α and β are the apparent rate constants, KEtOH is the adsorption constant of ethanol. It should be noted that semi-empirical Eq. (5) includes such features of the hydrogen production as (a) the bimolecular reactions occurring on the surface of the photocatalyst with the participation of adsorbed ethanol and (b) the linear dependence of the reaction rate on the sodium hydroxide content. The obtained equation allows one to predict the catalytic activity values under different conditions such as ethanol or NaOH concentration. This knowledge is a crucial for the further mathematical description of the photocatalytic processes and the design of the reactors for the photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous solutions of alcohols. Besides, the obtained kinetic model may be useful for the studying of the kinetic features of the photocatalytic hydrogen production from other organic compounds. Our experiments have shown that at C0(NaOH) = 1 M and C0 (ethanol) = 50 vol. % the activity of the 1%Pt/10-Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalyst is equal to 27 mmol g−1 h−1 and the apparent quantum efficiency is equal to 91%. These parameters exceed the recently reported data as shown in Table 3. Thereby, extremely high photocatalytic activity can be achieved by both the directed modification of Cd1-xZnxS structure and the optimization of experimental conditions."
9,Conclusions,"The Cd0.3Zn0.7S photocatalysts modified by nickel hydroxide demonstrated high values of the photocatalytic activity in the reaction of hydrogen production from aqueous ethanol solutions under visible light irradiation (λ = 450 nm). It was shown that the nickel-modified photocatalysts were more active than the zinc-modified ones. During the irradiation nickel hydroxide is likely to be reduced by photoinduced electrons to the metallic form that can improve the charge separation and the photocatalytic activity. The dependences of hydrogen production rate on the ethanol and NaOH concentrations over 1%Pt/10% Ni(OH)2/Cd0.3Zn0.7S were obtained; the highest value of the photocatalytic activity was equal to 27 mmol h−1 g−1 for (50% vol. ethanol, 1 M NaOH). A semi-empirical equation which describes the experimental data with high accuracy was proposed based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
