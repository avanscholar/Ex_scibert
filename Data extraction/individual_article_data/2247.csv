0,Introduction,"Biodiesel, one of the most attractive alternative fuels, has gained more and more popularity in many countries around the world and its production has been increasing steadily [1]. In the biodiesel production process, there is 1 volume of glycerol or glycerin generated for 10 volume of biodiesel produced [2]. Hence, an increase in biodiesel production results in a surplus amount of crude glycerin, leading to a decrease in the price of crude glycerin [3]. To overcome this problem, one of the interesting approaches is to convert glycerin to hydrogen and/or methane [4,5]. Hydrogen and methane are very promising as an attractive alternative energy [6] because they are clean and environmentally friendly. Moreover, they can also reduce the greenhouse gases which cause global warming [6]. There are many available commercial processes to produce hydrogen and methane, including steam reforming of natural gas [7], partial oxidation of natural gas [8], autothermal reforming of natural gas [9], dry reforming of natural gas [10], and supercritical water gasification of biomass [11]. All of these processes require a lot of energy and there is a risk of explosion [12]. A better way commonly used to produce hydrogen and methane is a biological process. Chookaew et al. [13] studied the production of hydrogen from crude glycerin by using a two-stage biological process combining dark fermentation with a microbial fuel cell (MFC) or microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). The maximum hydrogen yield of 0.55 mol H2/mol of glycerin was obtained under a COD loading rate of 0.55 kg/m3dat pH7.0 and 35 °C. Selembo et al. [14] also investigated hydrogen production from biodiesel wastewater which contained 70%glycerin using a single biological process serum glass bottle under a batch mode of operation with an initial feed COD of 1300 mg/l. The maximum hydrogen yield was as high as 0.31 mol-H2/mol glycerin. Seifert et al. (2009) [15] studied hydrogen production from pure glycerin with a mixed medium of a single biological process glass reactor (60 ml) under a batch mode of operation at 37 °C and pH6 and they reported the highest hydrogen yield of 0.41 mol H2/mol glycerin at the lowest concentration of applied inoculums of1.2 g VSS/l. Vlassis et al. [16] studied hydrogen and methane production from pure glycerin using both batch and continuous CSTRs under mesophilic temperature (35 °C). The highest hydrogen and methane yields were 22.14 ml H2/g COD removed and 300 ml CH4/g COD removed, respectively at an initial pH of 6.5 and an initial glycerin concentration of 8300 mg COD/l. Hydrogen and methane are produced via a biological process, which can be operated in both a single anaerobic process [17–21] and a two stage anaerobic process [22–24]. A two-stage anaerobic process is superior to a single anaerobic process because it not only provides additional methane, apart from hydrogen production, but also produces effluents having much lower COD values, leading to lower post treatment costs. Anaerobic digestion consists of four main sequential steps of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. For hydrolysis, complex organic molecules are enzymatically broken down into water-soluble smaller molecules of simple sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids. The soluble smaller molecules are further converted to organic acids, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and some alcohols in the acidogenic step by acidogenic bacteria. In the acetogenic step, the higher organic acids produced are further converted to acetic acid, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen by acetogenic bacteria. Finally, the hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide to form methane and water while the acetic acid is converted into methane and carbon dioxide by methanogenic bacteria [25,26]. Using a two-stage anaerobic process can successfully separately produce hydrogen and methane [22,27] whereas all single stage anaerobic processes can produce methane with carbon dioxide without hydrogen. In this research work, hydrogen and methane were produced separately and spontaneously from biodiesel wastewater with added glycerin at a very high concentration under mesophilic temperature by using a two-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) system. The first hydrogen ASBR unit was controlled at pH 5.5 while the pH of methane ASBR unit was not controlled [22]. The two-stage ASBR system was operated at different COD loading rates at a constant temperature of 37 °C. The recycle ratio of the effluent from the methane ASBR unit to feed flow rate was fixed at 1:1 in order to minimize the use of NaOH for pH adjustment in the hydrogen ASBR unit. The uptakes of glycerin, nitrogen and phosphorus were also evaluated to demonstrate a potential use of glycerin for separate production of hydrogen and methane. Moreover, one of the aims of this work was to find out whether the process performance was governed by the concentration of added glycerin or of the produced organic acids in the system."
1,Methods,
2,Seed sludge preparation,"2.1 Seed sludge preparation The activated sludge, taken from the biodiesel plant of the Bangchak Biofuel factory at Ayutthaya, was mixed with the anaerobic sludge from a covered lagoon to treat palm oil wastewater from the Suksomboon factory at Chonburi, Thailand. The mixed seed sludge was sieved and screened in order to remove debris and large solid particles before being added to both hydrogen and methane ASBR units to have an initial microbial concentration in terms of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) of approximately 12,000 mg/l. Only the seed sludge for the hydrogen ASBR unit was boiled for 15 min in order to eliminate methane-producing bacteria (hydrogen-consuming bacteria) and enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria [17–20]."
3,Feed preparation,"2.2 Feed preparation Biodiesel wastewater and crude glycerin were obtained from the Bangchak Biofuel factory at Ayutthaya. It was sieved and screened in order to remove debris and large solid particles and kept at 4 °C before use. The biodiesel wastewater used in this experiment had a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 2330 mg/l. An appropriate quantity of the crude glycerin sample (3.5%w/v) was added into the biodiesel wastewater to obtain a constant COD value of45000 mg/l of the mixed wastewater. The ratio of COD: nitrogen: phosphorous (COD:N:P) was 100:0.44:0.044, indicating that this mixed wastewater had insufficient nutrients for anaerobic digestion (the theoretical ratio of COD:N:P = 100:1:0.2 for anaerobic decomposition) [19]. Ammonium hydrogen carbonate (NH4HCO3) and di-potassium hydrogen orthophosphate (K2HPO4) were added to meet the theoretical ratio of COD:N:P [20]."
4,ASBR operation,"2.3 ASBR operation Both ASBR units used in this study were constructed from opaque PVC pipes and sheets in order to inhibit the activity of photosynthetic bacteria [28]. It had a working volume of 4 and 24 l for the hydrogen and methane ASBR units, respectively. Each ASBR unit was equipped with a magnetic stirrer (450 rpm) to suspend microbial cells during the reaction step. A temperature controller quipped with a heater and a thermocouple and a pH-controller with a dosing pump for a 1 M NaOH solution were used to maintain a constant temperature of 37 °C and a constant pH of 5.5 in the hydrogen ASBR unit, respectively, while the methane ASBR unit had only a temperature controller unit. The two-stage ASBR system was operated at 6 cycles per d and each cycle consisted of a feed step of 15 min, a reaction step of 90 min, a sedimentation step of 120 min and a decant step of 15 min, as reported in our previous work [19]. The two-stage ASBR system was operated at different COD loading rates (33.75, 50.63, 67.50, 84.38 kg/m3d based on feed COD load and hydrogen ASBR volume or 5.63, 8.44, 11.25, 14.06 kg/m3d based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume). The recycle ratio of the effluent of methane ASBR unit to a feed flow rate was fixed at 1:1 in order to minimize the use of NaOH for pH adjustment in the hydrogen ASBR unit [17,22,23]. The schematic of the two-stage ASBR system is shown in Fig. 1 . At any given COD loading rate, the two-stage ASBR system was operated for about 4 weeks to reach a steady state before effluent and produced gas samples of both ASBR units were taken for analysis and measurement. Steady state conditions were attained when effluent COD values and gas production rates of both hydrogen and methane ASBR reactors were invariant with time [22,23]."
5,Measurements and analytical methods,"2.4 Measurements and analytical methods The volume of produced gas was measured by a wet gas meter (Ritter, TG05/5) at room temperature (25–30 °C). A gas chromatograph (GC, Perkin-Elmer, AutoSystem) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless-steel 10′ × 1/8′ × 0.085′HayeSep D 100/120 mesh (Alltech) packed column was used to analyze the composition of produced gas samples [19]. The temperatures of column, injector, and detector were kept at 35, 60, and 150 °C, respectively and argon was used as a carrier gas. A high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Shimadzu, LC-10AD) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column(Bio-Rad Laboratories) and a refractive index (RI) detector at a wavelength of 210 nm with a 4 mM H2SO4 mobile phase was used to measure the amount of glycerin, total volatile fatty acids(VFA), and VFA composition [14]. The influent and effluent COD values were analyzed by the dichromate digestion and absorbance measurement by a spectrophotometer (HACH, DR 2700). Nitrogen analysis, in terms of organic nitrogen, was measured by the diazotization and cadmium reduction method and inorganic nitrogens (nitrate-nitrogen, ammonium-nitrogen and nitrite-nitrogen) were analyzed by the salicylate method with TNT persulfate digestion. Total phosphorous content was measured by the molybdovanadate method with acid persulfate digestion (HachCompany). The mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) to represent the microbial concentration in both ASBR units taken during the reaction step and volatile suspended solids (VSS) to represent the microbial washout from each ASBR unit taken during the decanting step were analyzed by the standard methods [29]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen ASBR performances,"3.1 Hydrogen ASBR performances Fig. 2 shows the process performances of the hydrogen ASBR unit as a function of COD loading rate at 37 °C and pH 5.5with a recycle ratio of 1:1. The actual COD loading rate calculated from the COD values of both feed and recycle effluent was also presented for comparison. The COD removal increased significantly from 20.6 to 36.8% with increasing COD loading rate from 33.8 to 67.5 kg/m3d and then dropped to 35.3% with a further increasing COD loading rate to 84.3 kg/m3d. The gas production rate had a similar trend to the COD removal. The results can be explained by the fact that an increase in COD loading rate simply increased the organic amount available for the microbes to utilize and to convert to hydrogen with a higher gas production rate. However, the COD loading rate increased from 70 to 85 kg/m3d, causing a decrease in both COD removal and gas production rate as a result from the increasing toxicity of VFA accumulation. This will be further discussed later. Fig. 2b shows the effect of COD loading rate on the composition of produced gas and hydrogen production rate of the hydrogen ASBR unit. The gas produced contained mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide with a very small amount of methane (less than 0.5%) in the studied range of COD loading rate. Both hydrogen content and hydrogen production rate increased with increasing COD loading rate from 33.8 to 67.5 kg/m3d and then decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 67.5 to 84.4 kg/m3d. The maximum values of both hydrogen content and hydrogen production rate (33.4% and 1.33 l/d, respectively) were also found at the same COD loading rate of 67.5 kg/m3d. The hydrogen production rate increased with increasing COD loading rate, resulting from a higher organic amount available for the microbes to produce more gaseous products. Beyond the COD loading rate of 67.5 kg/m3d, both hydrogen content and hydrogen production rate decreased with the increase in CO2 content due to the increasing concentration of total VFA in the bioreactor to exceed the toxic level to the microbes [30]. This will be shown later. A specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) is a process parameter to indicate the ability of microbes to produce hydrogen from organic compounds per unit volume of bioreactor or per unit dried weight of microbes [20,31]. Both SHPRs increased with increasing COD loading rate from 33.8 to 67.5 kg/m3d and then decreased with further increasing COD loading from 67.5 to 84.4 kg/m3d (Fig. 2c). The maximum SHPRs of 89 ml H2/g MLVSS d and 333 ml H2/l d were found at the same COD loading rate of 67.5 kg/m3d for all of the maximum hydrogen production rate, hydrogen content, and COD removal. Hydrogen yields are another process parameter to indicate the conversion efficiency of organic compounds to hydrogen by microbes expressed in ml H2/g COD applied and ml H2/g COD removed [20,31]. As shown in Fig. 2d, both hydrogen yields show a similar trend to the SHPRs, hydrogen production rate and COD removal. The maximum hydrogen yields of 7.8 ml H2/g COD removed and 4.93 ml H2/g COD applied were found at the same COD loading rate of 67.5 kg/m3d to provide the highest SHPRs and COD removal. The hydrogen yield from the biodiesel wastewater with added glycerin found in this study is about 68.4% lower than that under the two-stage mesophilic UASB process using cassava wastewater as a substrate [23] because the crude glycerin also contained some other compounds including soap, free fatty acids, methanol, unreacted triglyceride, diglyceride, and monoglycerides [32], which have lower biodegradability to cause the depletion of the hydrogen production performance [30]. Vlassis et al. [27] reported that pH and the amount of added glycerin in biodiesel wastewater directly affected hydrogen production performance. The suitable pH for hydrogen-producing bacteria to digest biodiesel wastewater containing glycerin was reportedly around 6.5 which was higher than the controlled pH of 5.5 used in this work. Moreover, they also suggested that the COD of glycerin in biodiesel wastewater should not exceed 8300 mg/l which was much lower than that used in the present work. Another reason causing the low hydrogen production activity was more likely from the size of the hydrogen ASBR unit being too small. This will be discussed in more detail latter. Fig. 2e shows the alkalinity and pH of the hydrogen ASBR unit at different COD loading rates. The alkalinity had a similar trend to the SHPRs, COD removal, gas production rate and hydrogen yields. The maximum alkalinity was also found at the same optimum COD loading rate of 67.5 kg/m3d. The low alkalinity in the hydrogen ASBR unit resulted from the low pH solution of 5.5. The constant pH of 5.5 in the hydrogen ASBR unit could be maintained, resulting from the use of a pH controller and the effluent recycle. The effects of COD loading rate on total VFA concentration and VFA composition in the hydrogen ASBR unit are shown in Fig. 3 a. The total VFA concentration increased steadily with increasing COD loading rate and reached a maximum value of 16,300 mg/l as acetic acid at the highest COD loading rate of 84.4 kg/m3d. The increase rate in total VFA concentration with increasing COD loading rate was relatively high when the COD loading rate was lower than the optimum COD loading rate of 67.50 kg/m3d, as compared with that at a COD loading rate beyond the optimum COD loading rate. This corresponded well to the reduction of the process performance in terms of hydrogen yields and hydrogen production rate, SHPRs and COD removal with increasing COD loading rate beyond the COD loading rate. The results suggest that the inhibitory level of total VFA to the hydrogen-producing microbes was around 13,000 mg/l as acetic acid which is in good agreement with our previous work [31,33]. As shown in Fig. 3a, the main organic acids produced were in the following concentration order: butyric acid (HBu), valeric acids (Hva), acetic acid (HAc) and propionic acid (HPr). The concentrations of all produced organic acids increased with increasing COD loading rate whereas the concentrations of 1,3 propanediol and ethanol were relatively low and remained almost unchanged. Glycerin (C3H8O3), the main organic compound in the feed (94.5% in COD), can be utilized by acidogens as well as acetogenes to produce hydrogen, organic acids, ethanol, butanol and 1,3 propanediol (1,3-PD), as shown in the following equations [32,34]. (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + H 2 O → CH 3 COOH ( acetic acid ) + CO 2 + 3 H 2 (2) C 3 H 8 O 3 → 2 C 3 H 8 O 3 C 4 H 8 O 2 ( butyric acid ) + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (3) 2 C 3 H 8 O 3 → C 4 H 10 O ( butanol ) + 2 CO 2 + H 2 O + 2 H 2 (4) C 3 H 8 O 3 + H 2 → C 3 H 8 O 2 ( 1 , 3 propanediol ) + H 2 O (5) C 3 H 8 O 3 → CH 3 CH 2 OH ( ethanol ) + CO 2 + H 2 (6) C 3 H 8 O 3 → CH 3 CH 2 COOH ( propionic acid ) + H 2 O From the COD mass balance (not shown here), glycerin was mostly converted to organic acids, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, as confirmed experimentally, by the glycerin analysis results, which will be discussed later."
8,Methane ASBR performances,"3.2 Methane ASBR performances The effluent from the hydrogen ASBR unit was directly fed to the methane ASBR unit for further methane production and the methane ASBR unit was also operated under mesophilic temperature (37 °C) without pH control. Fig. 4 a shows the effects of COD loading rate (based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume or the actual incoming COD load and methane ASBR volume). The COD removal increased with increasing COD loading rate from 5.6 to 11.3 kg/m3d and it attained a maximum value of 63.2% at a COD loading rate of 11.3kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume). Beyond the COD loading rate of 11.3 kg/m3d, the COD removal dramatically decreased with further increasing COD loading rate. The gas production rate showed a similar trend to the COD removal. The increase in COD loading rate simply increased the amount of organic compounds, especially organic acids and glycerin available for the microbes, resulting in both increases in COD removal and gas production rate. Interestingly, the gas production rate of the methane ASBR unit was about four times higher than that of the hydrogen ASBR unit, close to the volumetric ratio of these two bioreactors. The composition of produced gas from the methane ASBR unit mainly consisted of methane and carbon dioxide with a small amount of hydrogen (less than 1.9%) (Fig. 4b). Both methane content and methane production rate had a similar trend to the COD removal. This increased with increasing COD loading rate from 5.6 to 11.3 kg/m3d and then decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 11.3 to 14.1 kg/m3d.In contrast, the carbon dioxide content in the produced gas had an opposite trend to the methane content. The maximum of both methane content and methane production rates were found at a COD loading rate of 11.3 kg/m3d. Fig. 4c and d shows the specific methane production rates (SMPR) and methane yields as a function of the COD loading rate. Both SMPRs and methane yields increased with increasing COD loading rate from 5.6 to 11.3 kg/m3d and then decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 11.3 to 14.1 kg/m3d. Both maximum SMPR (232.50 ml CH4/g MLVSS d or 672.84 ml CH4/l d and maximum methane yield (128.4 ml CH4/g COD removed or 47.3 ml CH4/g COD applied) were found at a COD loading rate of 11.3 kg/m3d. Therefore, the COD loading rate of 11.3 kg/m3d based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume was considered to be an optimum organic loading rate for production of both hydrogen and methane by the two-stage mesophilic ASBR system. The maximum methane yield of 47.3 ml CH4/g COD applied found in this study was about 39% higher than that from cassava wastewater using a two-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket system at ambient temperature [28], suggesting that glycerin is a good substrate for anaerobic digestion to produce methane [30]. Fig. 4e shows the effects of COD loading rate on pH and alkalinity of the methane ASBR unit. They are basically used to indicate the process stability of the methanogenic step. The higher the alkalinity (normally greater than 1000 mg/l as CaCO3), the higher the process stability, and the solution pH in the methane ASBR unit should be in the range of 7–8 but not lower than 6.5 to indicate good process stability. Beyond the optimum COD loading rate, the solution pH drastically dropped lower than 6.5, indicating poor process stability, resulting from the increasing toxicity of VFA accumulation. The effects of COD loading rate on total VFA concentration and VFA composition of the methane ASBR unit are shown in Fig. 3b. The total VFA concentration steadily increased with increasing COD loading rate and attained a highest value of 980 mg/l as acetic acid at a very high COD loading rate of 14.1 kg/m3d. At this highest COD loading rate of 14.1 kg/m3d, the methane production performances decreased, corresponding to the decrease in COD removal. From the results of total VFA concentration, the toxicity level of VFA to methane-producing bacteria was around 800 mg/l as acetic acid which is in good agreement with our previous studies [22,23]. The composition of VFA in the methane ASBR unit was found to be much different compared to that in the hydrogen ASBR unit. The acetic acid was the highest and followed by HPr, HBu and HVa. The concentration of acetic acid increased significantly with increasing COD loading rate whereas all other organic acids including ethanol and 1,3 PD were relatively low and remained almost unchanged. The highest concentration of HAc resulted from the sub-sequential degradation of both HPr and HBu, known as acetogenesis, according to Equations (7)–(8) [35]. The formation of methane mainly results from two basic bioconversion reactions, which are the acetotrophic pathway, according to Equation (9) [22,35]and the hydrogenotrophic pathway, according to Equation (10) [35,36]. Furthermore, methane production can directly come from the degradation of the remaining glycerin in the liquid effluent from the hydrogen ASBR unit, described by Equation (11) [30]. The co-digestion of glycerin with biodiesel wastewater was also reported to enhance methane production performance [5]. (7) CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 (8) CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 → CH 3 COOH + CO 2 + 3 H 2 (9) CH 3 COOH → CH 4 + CO 2 (10) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O (11) C 3 H 8 O 3 → 1 . 75 CH 4 + 1 . 25 CO 2 + 0 . 5 H 2 O Both SMPRs and methane yields had similar trends to the COD removal. The optimum COD loading rate of 11.3 kg/m3d provided the highest values of SMPRs and methane yields which well corresponded to the maximum values of both alkalinity and system pH. Beyond the optimum COD loading rate of 11.3 kg/m3d, the process performances of the methane ASBR unit in terms methane yields decreased, resulting from the toxicity of VFA accumulation, as described before."
9,Microbial concentrations and microbial washout results,"3.3 Microbial concentrations and microbial washout results Fig. 5 shows the microbial concentrations in terms of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids(MLVSS) in both ASBR units and the microbial washout in terms of effluent volatile suspended solids(VSS) from both ASBR units at different COD loading rates. For both ASBR units, the MLVSS decreased while the effluent VSS increased with increasing COD loading rate. Under the COD loading rate ranging from 5.6 to 11.3 kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume), the increase in hydrogen and methane production performances corresponded to the decreases in the MLVSS. It can be explained by the fact that the increase in COD loading rate directly increased the amount of organic compounds, mainly glycerin available for the microbes to digest, leading to both increases in hydrogen and methane production rates. The results of the decreases in MLVSS with the increases in process performances of both ASBR units and microbial washout indicate that the washout rate of the inactive microbes was lower than the growth rate of active microbes [19]. Beyond the optimum COD loading rate of 67.5 kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and hydrogen ASBR volume) or 11.3 kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume), the process performances of both hydrogen and methane ASBR units decreased with further increasing COD loading rate in which both MLVSS and microbial washout remained almost unchanged. The results suggest that the VFA concentrations in both ASBR units already exceeded the toxicity levels of the organic acid concentrations of 13,000 and 800 mg/l as acetic acid to the hydrogen-producing bacteria and methane-producing bacteria, respectively. The inhibition results of the total VFA obtained from the present work are in good agreement with our previous works [17–23]. Sodium is also found insignificant amounts in biodiesel wastewater and it is also one of the necessary elements for the bacterial enzyme cofactors, transport processes and dehydrogenase [21,37–39]. NaOH was also used to control the pH in the hydrogen ASBR unit in this study. Hence, it was necessary to know whether or not the sodium concentration exceeded the inhibitory level of 3500–8000 mg/l [40–42]. The final effluent of the methane ASBR unit was found to have 1600 mg/l of sodium while the sodium concentration in the biodiesel wastewater after 3.5 %w/v glycerin had been added was more or less the same. The sodium concentration in the ASBR system was much lower than the inhibitory level. The result of a very small quantity of NaOH used for the pH control in the hydrogen ASBR unit suggests that recycling the final effluent from the methane ASBR unit was able to raise the pH to around 5.5 in the hydrogen ASBR unit."
10,"Nitrogen, phosphorous, and glycerin uptake results","3.4 Nitrogen, phosphorous, and glycerin uptake results Fig. 6 shows nitrogen, phosphorous, and glycerin uptakes and nitrogen transformation by both hydrogen-producing bacteria and methane-producing bacteria in the hydrogen ASBR unit and methane ASBR unit. The nitrogen, phosphorous, and glycerin uptakes increased with increasing COD loading rate. Under any given COD loading rate, nitrogen, phosphorous, and glycerin uptakes in the hydrogen ASBR unit were higher than those in the methane ASBR unit, which are in good agreement with previous studies [19,22]. The utilization of nitrogen by microbes can come from ammonia-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, and organic-nitrogen [43]. The concentrations of ammonium-nitrogen,nitrite-nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen in both ASBR units slightly decreased with increasing COD loading rate whereas the organic-nitrogen concentration significantly decreased, suggesting that the nitrogen uptakes by both hydrogen-producing bacteria and methane-producing bacteria mostly came from organic-nitrogen [44]. The glycerin uptakes in both ASBR units were high with the overall glycerin removal of 90%, suggesting that glycerin is a good substrate to produce both hydrogen and methane. The results of high glycerine uptakes in both ASBR units also suggest that under the studied conditions, the process performance was affected by the inhibition effect of the VFA accumulation without the toxicity from added glycerin."
11,Overall performance,"3.5 Overall performance Fig. 7 shows the overall process performance of the two-stage ASBR system as a function of COD loading rate. This two-stage ASBR system operated at the optimum overall COD loading rate of 9.64 kg/m3d (based on total volume of both ASBR units and feed COD load) provided the highest overall hydrogen yield of26.75 ml H2/g COD removed or 6.23 ml H2/g COD applied(15.20 ml H2/g glycerin removed or 11.71 ml H2/g glycerin applied), which is lower than that obtained from previous studies [13,17,18]. This is because several toxic compounds are present in the crude glycerin [32]. The process performances in terms of methane yields and SMPRs were found to be comparable to those from other works [45]. The high COD removal of 76.7% and the high glycerin uptake of 90.1% at the optimum COD loading rate suggest that glycerin is a good substrate for production of hydrogen and methane. Under the optimum overall COD loading rate, the two-stage ASBR system gave a relatively low ratio of H2-to-CH4 (1:9.3), as compared with those reported in previous investigations [22,44,46]. The result of the low ratio of H2-to-CH4 suggests that the two steps of hydrogen production by acidogenesis and acidogenesis did not take place completely in the hydrogen ASBR unit and they further continued in the methane ASBR unit. The hydrogen produced in the methane ASBR unit was immediately consumed by the methanogens to yield methane, causing an increase in methane production efficiency with the reduction of hydrogen production efficiency. An attempt to increase the hydrogen production efficiency with the expense of methane production efficiency will be carried out in our future work by increasing the ratio of hydrogen ASBR volume-to-methane ASBR volume. The mixed gases produced from the two-stage ASBR process which contained 6.5%H2, 63.5%CH4 and 30%CO2 at the optimum COD loading rate can provide a higher heating value, as compared with those of single anaerobic processes [18]."
12,Conclusions,"Under the optimum COD loading rate of 11.25 kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume) or 9.64kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and total volume of both ASBR units), the two-stage ASBR system provided the highest process performances of both hydrogen and methane production. The use of final effluent recycle could maintain the pH 5.5 in the hydrogen ASBR unit without NaOH requirement. The results suggest that a use of glycerin as a substrate is feasible technically for separate production of hydrogen and methane by using a two-stage ASBR system. The low volumetric ratio of hydrogen ASBR unit-to-methane ASBR unit (1:6) of the studied two-stage ASBR system favored methane production more than hydrogen production. An increase in the volumetric ratio is hypothesized to increase the hydrogen production efficiency with a reduction of methane production efficiency. The use of mixed gas produced from a two-stage anaerobic system can provide a higher heating value than the biogas generated from any single anaerobic unit. The toxic levels of produced VFA were found to be 13,000 and 800 mg/l as acetic acid to hydrogen-producing bacteria and methane-producing bacteria, respectively."
