0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation of esters to the corresponding alcohols is an essential component of chemical transformations [1] for the synthesis of organic building blocks and natural products. This procedure is widely applied in industry to produce pharmaceuticals, flavors, agrochemicals and fragrances [2,3]. Traditional hydrogenation methods of esters involve the use of stoichiometric amounts of metal hydride reagents (e.g. LiAlH4) [4] and suffer from some intractable problems, such as low atom economy, poor tolerance of functional groups, and large amounts of wastes [5]. In contrast, the transition-metal catalyzed hydrogenation of esters to alcohols is more intriguing environmentally and economically due to its most obvious advantage, generating no waste. Over the past years, the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenations of some fatty esters by transition-metal catalysts have been widely utilized in industry production. However, these reactions in general proceed with poor chemoselectivity and operate under harsh conditions (high temperatures at 200–300°C and high hydrogen pressures at 200–300atm) [6–9]. Thus, developing homogeneous hydrogenation strategy by using defined organometallic catalysts under milder conditions with higher functional group tolerance is highly desired. In the past few decades, following the seminal work by Grey and Pez [10,11], the homogeneous hydrogenation approach has been put into use successfully to transform esters to alcohols [12–17]. Nevertheless, the majority of these systems are confined to the hydrogenation of activated esters, such as dimethyl oxalate [18] and fluorinated esters [11], and the homogenous hydrogenation of non-activated esters still needs to be carried out at high temperature and relative high H2 pressure [15]. In addition, it is generally necessary to add large amounts of additives, such as organic base, inorganic acids [12], salts [14], zinc [15], and fluorinated alcoholic solvents [12], in a homogeneous hydrogenation system to gain a high conversion rate. Recently, Milstein and co-workers [19] reported an efficient procedure for the hydrogenation of non-activated esters to alcohols under relatively mild, neutral conditions with no additives being required and 100% atom economy. Moreover, all reagents used in their reactions are nontoxic, thereby effectively preventing environmental pollution. Eq. (1) shows a representative example of their hydrogenation reactions: where the ethyl benzoate (PhCOOC2H5) is hydrogenated using a ruthenium hydride complex based on the pincer ligand PNN (RuIIPNN), which contains both sp2C and ruthenium center active sites, as a bifunctional catalyst in 1,4-dioxane at 115°C, giving benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) in 96% and 99% yields, respectively [19].  As shown in Scheme 1 , Milstein et al. [19] have postulated a possible catalytic cycle for this transformation, which involves three stages: (i) hydrogenation of RCOOR′ to hemiacetal intermediate (RCH(OH)OR′); (ii) reversible decomposition of RCH(OH)OR′ to R′OH and RCHO; (iii) further hydrogenation of RCHO to RCH2OH. In this catalytic cycle, the catalyst plays a substantial role only in stages (i) and (iii), where the transformations are realized via a similar carbonyl insertion mechanism, while in stage (ii) RCH(OH)OR′ is hypothesized to transform to R′OH and RCHO by undergoing a direct decomposition mechanism without the assistance of catalyst, and this mechanism was also proposed by Beller et al. in a hydrogenation reaction of alkyne formate with a similar catalyst [20]. The novelty of hydrogenation of esters has triggered many computational studies [21–28] to understand the detailed mechanisms. It is found that hydrogenations of different esters follow different mechanisms. However, a general conclusion of the hydrogenation mechanism of esters is still not clear. In particular, there is no published computational study that has elucidated the influence of solvents and the electronic effects of different substituent groups on esters on the hydrogenation mechanism. To better understand the hydrogenation mechanism of non-activated esters, we here carried out a detailed computational study on the reaction shown in Eq. (1) by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our attention focuses on the following three aspects. First, we inspect the mechanistic details of the reaction and evaluate the feasibility of the mechanism proposed by Milstein et al. [19]. Then, we evaluate the influence of the solvents on the hydrogenation mechanism. And finally, to assist the experimental design, we study the effect of different substituent groups on esters on the reactivity. We expect that the theoretical results would provide a clear picture of the hydrogenation mechanism of non-activated esters."
1,Computational details,"All structures were optimized by using the B3LYP [29–31] functional and a mixed basis set BSI, i.e., the LANL2DZ [32] ECP basis set augmented with polarization functions [33] for Ru (ζf =1.235) and P (ζd =0.387) atoms and the 6–31G(d,p) [34] for all other atoms. The orbital exponents used in calculations are C (ζd =0.8), O (ζd =0.8), N (ζd =0.8), H (ζp =0.11) [35], P (ζd =0.387) and Ru (ζf =1.235) [36]. Frequency analysis calculations were performed at the same level of theory to identify all the stationary points as minima (zero negative frequencies) or transition states (single negative frequency) and to provide Gibbs energies at 298.15K and 1atm [37,38]. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) [39] analyses were carried out to examine the connection of each transition state with its backward and forward minima. Solvation effects were considered by performing single point calculations using SMD [40] solvent model with a larger combined basis set BSII, i.e., the 6–311++G(d,p) [41] basis set for all atoms except Ru and P atoms which are described by the same basis set in BSI. 1,4-dioxane, the experimentally used solvent, was chosen as the continuum medium. To further refine the relative energies, we computed the dispersion correction using the DFT-D3 method developed by Grimme and coworkers [42,43], as implemented in the DFTD3 program [44]. This method has been proved to be sufficient for providing reasonable results for noncovalent interactions [45–47]. To examine the reliability of the method for the present system, single-point solvation free energy calculations were also carried out for several key transition states using the M06 [48] and ωB97XD [49] functionals, which have been confirmed in previous works [50–58] to show good performance in describing transition-metal-ligand bond and weak interactions. In addition, we also computed the thermal contributions to enthalpy and entropy at the experimental temperature (115°C) for some key structures (Table S1 in Supporting information). All the DFT calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 package [59]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Mechanistic details,"3.1 Mechanistic details In this work, we studied three potential mechanisms for the hydrogenation of PhCOOC2H5 to C2H5OH and PhCH2OH catalyzed by RuIIPNN: the carbonyl insertion mechanism, stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism, and direct reduction mechanism. 3.1.1 H2 activation Consistent with many catalytic hydrogenations [60–67], the reaction starts from activation of H2. For the present system, dihydrogen activation is the common starting point of the reaction in all three potential mechanisms. Fig. 1 shows the calculated Gibbs energy profiles of dihydrogen activation. Initially, H2 coordinates to the ruthenium center, giving intermediate 1, lying above the entrance by 11.7kcal/mol. Subsequently, H2 is activated by the nucleophilic attack from the unsaturated sp2C of the CHPtBu2 arm to the proton with the electrophilic attack from the Ru center to the hydride via TS1, a formal [2+2+2] addition transition state (two σ electrons of HH σ bond, two lone-pair electrons of the nitrogen atom, and two π electrons of the CC double bond). The calculated structural parameters of TS1 (Fig. 2 ) suggest that dihydrogen activation is accompanied by the aromatization of the six-membered ring ligand to an aromatic pyridine ring. This process, resulting in the trans-dihydride complex 2 (i.e., structure A in Scheme 1), overcomes a barrier of 30.1kcal/mol and is endergonic by 3.9kcal/mol, indicating that the dihydrogen activation intrinsically is a reversible process. According to previous reports [68–76], a hydrogen transfer shuttle could lower H-transfer barrier greatly. Here, we consider an alcohol-assisted dihydrogen activation mechanism, where C2H5OH or PhCH2OH (the final products of the present transformation) serves as a H-shuttle, and the results are presented in Fig. 1b. The calculated barriers are 26.8 (TS1', the C2H5OH-involved process) and 23.3kcal/mol (TS1"", the PhCH2OH-involved process), respectively, which are 3.3 and 6.8kcal/mol lower than that without the assistance of an alcohol molecule (TS1). This is attributed to the stronger Lewis alkalinity of the oxygen atom in alcohol than sp2C of the CHPtBu2. From these results, it is believed that the newly formed alcohols (PhCH2OH and C2H5OH), serving as a hydrogen transfer shuttle, can facilitate the dihydrogen activation. In other words, the reaction may become easier once the products PhCH2OH and C2H5OH are formed. 3.1.2 Carbonyl insertion mechanism proposed by Milstein et al. As shown in Scheme 1, Milstein et al. proposed that the hydrogenation of non-activated esters substantially involves a carbonyl insertion mechanism. Fig. 3 describes the calculated Gibbs energy profiles for the hydrogenation of PhCOOC2H5 to PhCHO and subsequent hydrogenation of PhCHO to PhCH2OH in terms of the mechanism proposed by Milstein et al. [19]. After the dihydrogen activation, the generated trans-dihydride complex 2 opens the CH2NEt2 arm by crossing a barrier of 25.7kcal/mol (TS2, not sketched in Fig. 3a), giving intermediate 3, in which a vacant site is available for coordination of PhCOOC2H. As a result of the disappearance of the coordination interaction, this process is endergonic by 17.9kcal/mol. Coordination of PhCOOC2H5 to the Ru center affords intermediate 4, which is less stable by 17.4kcal/mol than 2. This is reasonable because of the weaker coordinating capability of the carbonyl group of PhCOOC2H5 than the nitrogen atom of CH2NEt2 arm as well as larger steric hindrance in 4. And the origination of the endergonic nature of PhCOOC2H5 addition to the Ru-complex is also attributed to loss of gas-phase entropy. Subsequently, the carbonyl insertion into RuH bond occurs via TS3, leading to the formation of intermediate 5, which then rearranges to alkoxide complex 6 by closing its CH2NEt2 arm. Subsequently, 6 transforms to a dimolecular complex 7 via a 5-membered ring H-abstraction transition state (TS4), followed by the liberation of the hemiacetal PhCH(OH)OC2H5 and the regeneration of catalyst RuIIPNN. For the decomposition of the hemiacetal PhCH(OH)OC2H5 into PhCHO and C2H5OH, two different scenarios are considered: one is the direct dissociation via TS5, and the other relates to an intermolecular hydrogen transfer via TS6 assisted by a second hemiacetal molecule, which acts as a proton-transfer-bridge. Note that in both two scenarios, the formation of PhCHO from PhCH(OH)OC2H5 is calculated from the gas phase reaction and does not involve the presence of the catalyst. The Gibbs energies of the transition states involved in these two scenarios are calculated to be 44.2 and 45.4kcal/mol, respectively. The subsequent hydrogenation of PhCHO to PhCH2OH, according to Scheme 1, follows the similar carbonyl insertion mechanism discussed above. The calculated results are detailed in Fig. 3b. It is found that the carbonyl insertion transition state TS7 (25.4kcal/mol) is significantly more stable than the corresponding one (31.7kcal/mol, TS3 in Fig. 3a) involved in the hydrogenation of PhCOOC2H5 to PhCHO. This result can be understood as follows. Carbonyl insertion into RuH σ bond involves an orbital interaction of an unoccupied π* orbital of the carbonyl group with the occupied RuH σ bonding orbital. This process is generally regarded as a nucleophilic attack of the RuH bond at the carbon atom of the carbonyl group. Owing to the existence of the electron donating group (OC2H5) in PhCOOC2H5, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group in PhCHO is expected to be more electropositive, favoring the carbonyl inserting into the RhH bond. In addition, the smaller steric hindrance in TS7 than in TS3 also plays a role for its relative higher stability. From the results shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that the decomposition of the hemiacetal intermediate is the rate-determining step and the calculated overall barrier is up to 44.2kcal/mol, which is too high to overcome under the mild experimental temperature (115°C) [19]. 3.1.3 Improved carbonyl insertion mechanism This mechanism is the same with that discussed above until the formation of alkoxide complex 6. Our calculations indicate that the alkoxide complex 6 can transform into PhCHO directly via a seven-membered ring H-abstraction transition state TS9 (Fig. 4 ), in which the proton of CH2PtBu2 is abstracted by the ethoxy group. The barrier of this process is 9.3kcal/mol, which is much lower than that involved in the experimentally proposed mechanism (TS5, Fig. 3a). It is interesting to note that this pathway does not include the hemiacetal intermediate PhCH(OH)OC2H5 proposed by Milstein et al. [19]. In the improved carbonyl insertion mechanism, the carbonyl insertion is identified as the rate-determining step, and the overall barrier of the reaction is reduced to 31.7kcal/mol from 44.2kcal/mol. 3.1.4 Stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism As an alternative to the carbonyl insertion mechanism, a stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism is also investigated. The calculated results are given in Fig. 5 . Firstly, the hydride transfers from Ru center to the carbon atom of the carbonyl group in PhCOOC2H5 by passing TS10 with a barrier of 23.3kcal/mol, forming intermediate 12. The high energy of intermediate 12 (22.4kcal/mol) is not surprising due to its zwitterionic nature, which is consistent with the Mulliken charge analysis (blue values in Fig. 5), i.e., much more positive charges on Ru and much more negative charges on O atom than those in structures 2 and TS10. After that the hemiacetal intermediate PhCH(OH)OC2H5 is afforded with release of catalyst RuIIPNN through the proton migration from CH2PtBu2 arm to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group in PhCOOC2H5. This step occurs via TS11 and needs to overcome a barrier of 3.0kcal/mol. Subsequently, PhCH(OH)OC2H5 re-coordinates to the regenerated catalyst, giving 13. Then he hydroxyl hydrogen in PhCH(OH)OC2H5 is abstracted by the unsaturated carbon atom of the CHPtBu2 arm via TS12, with a barrier of 3.1kcal/mol, reaching 14. This step is a reverse process of a β-hydrogen-elimination reaction. Lastly, PhCHO and C2H5OH are obtained by passing a seven-membered ring H-abstraction transition state (TS13) with a barrier of 10.2kcal/mol. The subsequent hydrogenation of PhCHO to PhCH2OH along the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism is also calculated (Fig. 5b, 2 → TS14 → 15 → TS15 → 16 →PhCH2OH). According to the above discussion, the barriers of the hydrogenation of PhCOOC2H5 to PhCHO and PhCHO to PhCH2OH via the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism are 27.2 and 15.7kcal/mol, which are 4.5 and 10.0kcal/mol lower than that along the carbonyl insertion mechanism, respectively. These results indicate that the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism is much more favorable than the experimental proposed carbonyl insertion mechanism. Catalyst mediated PhCH(OH)OC2H5 to PhCHO+EtOH transformation has a much smaller barrier (TS12, 25.7kcal/mol) than the transformation without the assistance of catalyst (TS5, 44.2kcal/mol). 3.1.5 Direct reduction mechanism In a recent report by Yang [77], a direct reduction mechanism is proposed for the hydrogenation of ketones catalyzed by an iron PNP pincer complex in ethanol (ε=24.9). This mechanism features the direct reduction of a zwitterionic complex into separated ions (an alkoxide anion and a cation). In this work, we also examined the present reaction according to the direct reduction mechanism. As depicted by the red pathway in Fig. 5 a, the zwitterionic structure 12 directly decomposes into PhCH(OC2H5)O− and monocation 17, which then evolve into 14 through direct reassociation. The barrier of this mechanism is up to 56.6kcal/mol, implying that this direct reduction mechanism in not suitable for the present system. We speculate that the difference may be perceived from the solvent effect, of which the details will be discussed in the last of this work. In addition, for the conversion of 14 to PhCHO and C2H5OH, a slippage cleavage pathway is also taken into account (Fig. S1 in Supporting information), and is calculated to be less favorable. Note that in the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism, the CH2NEt2 arm of the catalyst keeps closed, making the ruthenium center in all structures involve a 18-electron configuration. Alternatively, we designed another channel that features a 16-electron configuration with the CH2NEt2 arm opened (Fig. S2 in Supporting information), which is proved to be unfeasible. This result indicates that the ruthenium center prefers a 18-electron rather than 16-electron configuration and is agreement with the earlier report by Wang et al. [78]. Furthermore, for hydrogenation of PhCHO to PhCH2OH, a concerted hydrogenation pathway is also studied (Fig. S3 in Supporting information) and is calculated to be less favorable. To verify the validity of the results above based on the B3LYP-D3 calculations, we also calculated the energies of several key transition states (TS3, TS10, TS11 and TS12) with M06 and ωB97XD functionals. These results are in good agreement with those obtained from dispersion corrected B3LYP calculations (Supporting information, Table S1). According to the above discussion, the hydrogenation of the non-activated esters takes place via the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism rather than the carbonyl insertion mechanism. In addition, different from the experimentally proposed mechanism that PhCHO can be obtained via the decomposition of PhCH(OH)OC2H5 without the assistance of catalyst, the catalyst participates in the whole catalytic cycle persistently."
4,Effects of different substituent groups on esters on hydrogenation mechanism,"3.2 Effects of different substituent groups on esters on hydrogenation mechanism In previous experimental reports [19,79,80], the esters with different substituent groups were proposed to follow different hydrogenation mechanisms. The hydrogenation of ester with electron withdrawing group [79] is suggested to proceed via a double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism, while for that of an ester with electron donating group, the carbonyl insertion mechanism is recommended [19]. To examine the reliability of these conjectures, we studied the effect of different substituent groups on esters on hydrogenation mechanism. Ethyl trifluoroacetate (CF3COOC2H5) and ethyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5) are chosen as models of esters with electron withdrawing group and electron donating group, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the Gibbs energy profiles of the hydrogenation of CF3COOC2H5 to trifluoroacetaldehyde (CF3CHO) through carbonyl insertion mechanism and stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism, as depicted by pathways I CF 3 and II CF 3 , respectively, where subscript CF3 means CF3COOC2H5. The barrier of the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism is calculated to be 21.6kcal/mol (TS13′, relative to 14′), which is 8.2kcal/mol than that of carbonyl insertion mechanism (29.8kcal/mol, TS3′). Similarly, the hydrogenation of CF3CHO to trifluoroethanol (CF3CH2OH) (Fig. 8 ) also follows the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism (the black pathway), which involves a much lower barrier (4.9kcal/mol) than the carbonyl insertion mechanism (25.7kcal/mol). These results indicate that the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism is energetically more favorable than the carbonyl insertion mechanism for the hydrogenation of CF3COOC2H5 to CF3CH2OH and CH3CH2OH. The Gibbs energy profiles of hydrogenation of CH3COOC2H5 to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and further hydrogenation of CH3CHO to C2H5OH via the above two mechanisms are presented in Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. The barriers of these two hydrogenation processes along the carbonyl insertion mechanism are 3.1 (TS3""relative to TS12"") and 9.6kcal/mol (TS7""relative to TS15"") higher than those via the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism, respectively, suggesting that both hydrogenation of CH3COOC2H5 and further hydrogenation of CH3CHO also prefer the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism. From these results, we propose the ester hydrogenation mechanism does not depend on the substitute group on it. In other words, whether the substituent group on an ester is an electron withdrawing group or an electron donating group, the hydrogenation of the ester prefers the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism to the carbonyl insertion mechanism. On the other hand, the overall barriers of the hydrogenation of CF3COOC2H5, PhCOOC2H5 and CH3COOC2H5 are 21.6, 27.2 and 30.7kcal/mol, respectively, implying that the electronic effect of the substituent has great influence on the reactivity, i.e., the electron withdrawing group on an ester makes the hydrogenation more facile while the electron donating group is disadvantageous to the hydrogenation. This result can be understood by considering the fact that the hydride transfer process (TS10, TS10', TS10"") in the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack from hydride to the carbon atom of the carbonyl group, and the electron withdrawing group makes the carbon atom of the carbonyl group more electropositive, facilitating the ester hydrogenation. Although there is no available experimental evidence on how does the substituent affects the reactivity, the present theoretical results are expected to provide guidance for the future experimental study."
5,Influence of different solvents on hydrogenation mechanism,"3.3 Influence of different solvents on hydrogenation mechanism From the discussion above, the hydrogenation of PhCOOC2H5 and PhCHO prefers a stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism. This situation is very different from the hydrogenation of ketones catalyzed by an iron PNP pincer complex in ethanol (ε =24.9), which was found by Yang et al. [77] to follow a direct reduction mechanism. As aforementioned, for the present system, the direct reduction mechanism is unfavorable due to the very high barrier involved (56.6kcal/mol, the red pathway in Fig. 5a). We speculate that the solvent effect may make great contribution to the difference, as the present reaction was carried out in 1,4-dioxane (ε=2.2) while the iron PNP pincer complex catalyzed ketone hydrogenation was performed in ethanol (ε=24.9). Therefore, we studied the effect of different solvents on the hydrogenation mechanism and the results are shown in Table 1 . Ethanol (ε=24.9), water (ε=78.4) and dimethylsulfoxide (ε=46.9) are chosen as models of more polar solvents while benzene (ε=2.3) and 1,4-dioxane (ε=2.2) are representatives of less polar solvents. From the data in Table 1, we can easily draw the following conclusions. First, in both more polar solvent and less polar solvent, the carbonyl insertion mechanism should be excluded. Second, the solvent has decisive influence on the hydrogenation mechanism: the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism is more favorable in a less polar solvent, while the hydrogenation prefers a direct reduction mechanism in a more polar solvent. It should be emphasized that the direct reduction mechanism does also not involve the presence of hemiacetal PhCH(OH)OC2H5, the intermediate involved in Scheme 1. Third, the polarity of solvents greatly affects the stabilization of cationic intermediate 17 and anionic intermediate PhCH(OEt)O−, which determines the ester hydrogenation mechanism. To give more insight to the effect of solvent on the reactivity, the Mulliken population analysis on atomic charges are performed for intermediates 17 and PhCH(OEt)O− (Table 2 ). Clearly, the Ru atom carries more positive charges and the O atom carries more negative charges in more polar solvents than in less polar solvents. These results may originate from the fact that the more polar solvent makes greater contribution to the stabilization of the separated ions (the alkoxide anion PhCH(OC2H5)O− and monocation 17) in comparison with the less polar solvent. Based on the results above, we schematically present the calculated catalytic cycle in Scheme 2 . Clearly, the hydrogenation of PhCOOC2H5 in more polar and less polar solvent prefers a different mechanism. In a less polar solvent, the hydrogenation occurs via a stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism, while in a more polar solvent, the hydrogenation is realized by undergoing a direct reduction mechanism, involving the separated ions (PhCH(OC2H5)O− and 17)."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, we have performed a detailed computational investigation of the hydrogenation mechanism of ethyl benzoate to benzyl alcohol and ethanol catalyzed by RuIIPNN. As elucidated by computational results, the whole catalytic cycle can be divided into two stages: hydrogenation of PhCOOC2H5 to C2H5OH and intermediate product PhCHO, and further hydrogenation to PhCH2OH. The experimentally proposed carbonyl insertion mechanism is demonstrated to be less favorable. Instead, both two stages prefer a similar stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer hydrogenation mechanism, which is characterized by the following steps: dihydrogen activation, stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer for the formation of hemiacetal PhCH(OH)OC2H5 or PhCH2OH, a hydrogen abstraction process for formation of C2H5OH. Different from the experimental proposed mechanism, the catalyst plays a crucial role consistently in the whole catalytic cycle. In addition, the final products, PhCH2OH and C2H5OH, can facilitate hydrogen activation, and then promote the whole transformation. Moreover, the effect of different substituent groups on esters on hydrogenation mechanism and reactivity is studied. The results indicate that the ester hydrogenation mechanism does not depend on the substitute group on it, i.e., whether the substituent group on an ester is an electron withdrawing group or an electron donating group, the hydrogenation of the ester prefers a stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism. On the other hand, the electron withdrawing group on an ester makes the hydrogenation more facile while the electron donating group is disadvantageous to the hydrogenation. Furthermore, the influence of the solvents effect on the hydrogenation mechanism is also evaluated and the results demonstrate that the hydrogenation of an ester prefers the stepwise double-hydrogen-transfer mechanism in a less polar solvent while the hydrogenation occurs via a direct reduction mechanism in a more polar solvent. Note that in more polar solvent, along the direct reduction mechanism, the separated ions (PhCH(OC2H5)O− and monocation 17) are afforded, instead of the hemiacetal PhCH(OH)OC2H5, which is involved in the mechanism proposed by Milstein et al. [19]."
