0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic reforming of organic substances for hydrogen production is carried out in the presence of a photocatalyst, typically nanocrystalline titania, modified with deposited noble metal nanoparticles. The Fermi level of noble metals is much lower in energy than the conduction band (CB) of titania (and other transition metal oxide semiconductors). When the semiconductor is excited by absorption of photons, electron–hole pairs are generated. Electrons excited to the CB fall into the deep trap of attached metal nanoparticle and thus electron–hole separation is achieved. Furthermore, holes can be consumed by oxidation of the sacrificial agents, while trapped electrons interact with hydrogen ions producing molecular hydrogen. This model of photocatalytic hydrogen production is applicable to many different semiconductors, including transition metal oxides and sulfides. However, to this day, no better match has been found than the combination of nanocrystalline titania with nanoparticulate platinum. Photocatalytic reforming remains a popular subject of research, even though, it goes on for several decades [1–15]. Recent works are geared by the search for new photocatalysts and combinations of photocatalysts as well as the search for sensitizers of large band gap semiconductors to improve their solar responsive capacity [16–19]. However, concerning titania itself, there are still questions to answer. Commercial nanocrystalline titania has a limited specific surface area, for example, P25 is around 50m2 g−1. Titania synthesized by soft chemistry techniques like sol–gel in the presence of surfactant templates reaches higher specific surface and thus presents high active interface with the reaction medium. Active interface is important for a photocatalyst since it defines its reaction front with its liquid or gaseous environment, determines the efficiency of the encounter with the reaction medium and affects the dispersion of the noble metal co-catalyst. This in turn helps avoiding aggregation of the noble metal nanoparticles and allows for higher light absorption cross-section. The deposited metal nanoparticles, their electrochemical potential, their size and distribution as well as the kinetics of charge transfer have been and are being studied with a lot of interest in order to elucidate the implied processes and optimize photocatalytic hydrogen production [12,15,20,21]. With this in mind, in the present work, we have studied a combination between titania aerogels with platinum co-catalyst. TiO2 aerogels are a special class of materials, which are obtained by supercritical drying of highly cross-linked inorganic gels, whose networks are built up from fundamental building blocks interconnected to form a well-defined porous structure [22–24]. In the present study, the involvement of this type of porous materials, which have been previously successfully used for pollutant photodegradation [25–27], ensured a relatively high specific surface (162m2 g−1), even when the samples were heat treated at a relatively elevated temperature (500°C). The obtained aerogel-based composites have been characterized by several techniques to ensure their semiconductive and nanocrystalline properties, while their photocatalytic capacity has been tested for hydrogen production applications. We have used ethanol as model “fuel” to be consumed by photodegradation. Ethanol is one of the model substances obtained from biomass, therefore, renewable. The present results may then add to the effort of using renewable resources for hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were obtained from Aldrich and were used as received. Millipore water was used in all experiments."
3,Preparation of Pt/TiO2 aerogels,"2.2 Preparation of Pt/TiO2 aerogels 2.2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 gels TiO2 gels were prepared by one-step acid-catalyzed sol–gel procedure, using Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, HNO3, C2H5OH (EtOH), and H2O at molar ratios of 1:0.08:21:3.67. The obtained gels were kept for aging in a properly closed polyethylene box at room temperature (21days minimum) and then immersed in Pt colloidal solutions containing various amounts of platinum that were prepared as described in the following paragraph. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Pt colloidal solutions with added TiO2 Pt colloidal solutions were prepared by adapting an already reported protocol used for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles [28,29]. Thus, 5.75, 6.0 and 6.5nm Pt colloidal suspensions (their sizes determined by analyzing TEM data, see below) were obtained by adding 3.32, 1.66 and 0.83mL of 25×10−3 molL−1 trisodium citrate solution, respectively, to 332mL of water. Then 25g of TiO2 gel was introduced. After 30min stirring, 3.35, 2.34 and 1mL of 25×10−3 molL−1 hexachloroplatinic acid solution, respectively, was added to obtain 1.0%, 0.7% and 0.3% Pt nanoparticles concentration. After 30min stirring, 3.35mL of 0.3molL−1 NaBH4 (kept at 4°C) was added to each solution and then stirred for 1h. The amount of platinum was thus controlled by the added quantity of hexachloroplatinic acid solution but the size of the formed platinum nanoparticles was controlled by the quantity of trisodium citrate [28,29]. 2.2.3 Preparation of Pt/TiO2 aerogels The obtained modified TiO2 gels were washed 3–4 times with EtOH, then kept overnight in EtOH and finally were supercritically dried using liquid CO2 (313K at 95.23atm) in a homemade supercritical drying device. The dried Pt/TiO2 aerogels were thermally treated with a rate of 1°C/min until reaching 140°C, and then at 4°C/min, until reaching the plateau of 500°C, where they were held for 30min. The samples were coded as follows: percent (Pt concentration)–nm (Pt nanoparticles average size), e.g., 1.0%–6.5nm means 1wt.% of Pt concentration and Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 6.5nm."
4,Photocatalytic installation for hydrogen production and detection,"2.3 Photocatalytic installation for hydrogen production and detection The reactor was of cylindrical shape, made of Pyrex glass and carrying fittings allowing gas inlet–outlet. It was placed in front of a UV-enhanced light source (Osram Ultramed 400W) without filters. Light was concentrated on the reactor by means of a cylindrical lens. The intensity of radiation at the center of the reactor, as measured with a radiometer, was approximately 80mWcm−2. 100mg of the TiO2–Pt photocatalyst were dispersed in 100mL of water containing 1% vol. of ethanol. The slurry was continuously stirred during the measurements. The solution was first degased by an Ar flow and then the light was turned on. During measurements, the Ar flow was maintained at 20cm3 min−1. Hydrogen was detected on line by using a SRI 8610C gas chromatograph. Calibration of the chromatograph signal was accomplished by comparison with a standard of 0.25% H2 in Ar."
5,Characterization methods,"2.4 Characterization methods The band gap energy (E g) of the investigated samples was calculated from their diffuse reflectance spectra, recorded by employing a Perkin Elmer Lambda 45 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800nm. Reflectance data were converted according to the Kubelka–Munk theory to F(R), and the band gap energies corresponding to both direct and indirect transitions were calculated from the individual plots of [F(R)⋅E]2 and [F(R)⋅E]1/2 versus energy of the exciting light (E), respectively. A Tecnai F20 field emission, high resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200kV and equipped with Eagle 4k CCD camera was employed to obtain the TEM images. The samples were suspended in distillated water and then deposited on Cu grids with carbon film evaporated on freshly cleaved mica. The sizes of the Pt nanoparticles were determined by using software TIA that is dedicated to the TEM Imaging and Analysis processing. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) images were recorded with a ZEISS SUPRA 35VP device. XRD patterns were recorded with a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å), with Ni-filter. The crystallites mean size for each sample was calculated according to the Scherrer’s equation. Specific surface area, pore size distribution, and pore volume determinations were obtained by performing N2 sorption/desorption measurements with a Sorptomatic 1990 apparatus and using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) and Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) calculation methods. The samples were pretreated at 120°C for a few hours to remove moisture and contaminants and the mass of powder was accurately measured before and after pretreatment."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Photocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Photocatalysts characterization TiO2–Pt aerogel composite photocatalysts were characterized by several different techniques. The results revealed that Pt distribution follows a good dispersability, while the presence of Pt had a small but detectable and reproducible effect on the nanocrystallites size and energy gap. 3.1.1 UV–Vis spectrophotometry DRS spectra recorded on the TiO2–Pt aerogel composites are presented in Fig. 1 and the calculated direct and indirect E g values are listed in Table 1 . Direct E g values were all the same within experimental error. However, indirect E g values did vary from one sample to the other indicating that the presence of Pt had a certain influence on the combined photocatalyst behavior. Such an influence was also previously observed for quantities of Pt lower than 1wt.% [30,31]. As it will be seen below, the differentiation between the titania nanoparticles, expressed by the different indirect E g values, reflects also on the photocatalytic properties. Therefore, it is concluded that indirect transitions is expected to play a role in the present case. 3.1.2 XRD patterns Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns obtained with all nine different TiO2–Pt combinations. All samples crystallized in the anatase phase. Analysis of the main peak by the Scherrer’s equation yielded the TiO2 crystallite mean sizes listed in Table 1. Their values ranged between 8 and 11nm. It is seen that larger Pt nanoparticles induced a decrease in TiO2 size. Thus the smallest TiO2 sizes were observed with 6.5nm Pt. Similar influence was previously evidenced [32,33], when various noble metal nanoparticles were loaded on different oxides. The concentration of Pt did not affect titania nanoparticle size within experimental error. 3.1.3 SEM and TEM images SEM and TEM images are presented in Fig. 3 for a few characteristic TiO2–Pt composites. SEM image (Fig. 3A) revealed a porous nanostructure built up of small nanoparticles of size ⩽10nm. Even though, accurate determination of crystallite size cannot be made by SEM, the obtained values were very close to those calculated by Scherrer’s equation. This was subsequently verified by recording TEM images. Indeed the latter clearly show the presence of dark-colored Pt nanoparticles that have a relatively spherical shape (see Fig. 3B) and are well distributed over the titania phase (Fig. 3C). The sizes of the Pt nanoparticles were determined from the TEM images by using the dedicated to the instrument software and are shown in Table 1. Even though, the error in calculating Pt sizes is very large, the average size is well distinguished in each case. Thus for the three different Pt concentrations the corresponding average Pt sizes were 5.75, 6.0 and 6.5nm. 3.1.4 BET measurements Adsorption and desorption isotherms of N2 are presented in Fig. 4 . According to IUPAC classification (1985), the physisorption isotherms of TiO2–Pt (6.5nm) aerogels correspond to type IV with the H2 hysteresis loop. In this case, the pore structures are complex and tend to be made up of interconnected networks of pores of different size and shape [34]. The corresponding values are listed in Table 2 . All samples were porous and developed a high specific area, which in the case of 0.7%–6.5nm reached 162m2 g−1. One should mention that the as-prepared titania aerogel sample exhibits a specific surface of 550–600m2 g−1 [27], which after thermal treatment at 500°C for 2h drastically diminishes reaching about 120–160m2 g−1 [30]. The decrease then of the specific surface is expected for calcinated aerogels. The merits of the present aerogel approach relate with the fact that even with calcination at 500°C the materials manage to preserve a substantial specific surface. The size of the pores was comparable with the titania nanoparticle size. As a general remark, one observes that both the Pt nanoparticles size and their concentration affect the specific surface and pore volume, but it is worth mentioning that the highest values of the two morphological parameters were obtained for the biggest Pt nanoparticles. In conclusion, the characterization of the TiO2–Pt composites with various techniques revealed a porous structure with rather uniform Pt distribution. We believe that this uniform distribution is the result of mixing metal and titania nanoparticles in the colloidal phase and the subsequent supercritical drying. Titania nanocrystal sizes ranged between 8 and 11nm, the smallest sizes observed when Pt nanoparticles were the largest. The highest values of the two morphological parameters were obtained for the biggest Pt nanoparticles (6.5nm), while the highest specific surface was reached for the 0.7%–6.5nm composite (162m2 g−1). This successful mixing of titania with Pt nanoparticles is expected to have beneficial consequences to the photocatalytic functioning of the composite photocatalysts. This is discussed in the next section."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production by ethanol reforming,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production by ethanol reforming Photocatalytic degradation of aqueous ethanol under anaerobic conditions follows an alcohol reforming model frequently discussed in the past [3–7,11–13,17]. The overall mineralization scheme obeys the following equation [6,13]: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 Δ H = 173.1 kJ mol - 1 This endergonic reaction receives all necessary energy through photons absorbed by the photocatalyst. Photogenerated holes interact with and oxidize the organic content while photogenerated electrons reduce hydrogen ions and produce molecular hydrogen. Pure photocatalysts are not capable of carrying out these reactions because of extensive electron–hole recombination. Combined photocatalysts do enjoy electron–hole separation as already discussed. The present combined TiO2–Pt aerogel photocatalysts were proven especially successful in this functionality. The temporal evolution of hydrogen in the presence of TiO2–Pt aerogel photocatalysts are presented in Figs. 5 and 6 . All curves could be divided into three major parts: the rising part, corresponding to the time needed for hydrogen build up within the reaction solution and the tubing to the detection compartment; the peak rate, which gives an indication of the maximum possible hydrogen production rate under the present conditions; and the declining part, which corresponds to “fuel” consumption. If the quantity of ethanol were substantially larger, the production rate decline would have been slower or the curve would have formed a plateau [13–15]. The existence or not of a plateau depends on the relative quantity of catalyst and fuel and the intensity of incident radiation or, in simple words, on how fast the photocatalyst can degrade fuel. In all studied cases, smaller Pt nanoparticles gave more hydrogen. Thus, in Fig. 5, showing results obtained with the same (1%) Pt concentration, the highest rate was obtained with 5.75nm Pt nanoparticles. This result may be readily explained by the following reasoning: smaller Pt nanoparticles means a broader Pt distribution thus creating more combined photocatalyst-co-catalyst sites, therefore, more reaction sites. When the size of the Pt nanoparticles was kept constant but their concentration increased, a similar trend was observed. That is, the more numerous Pt nanoparticles, for the same quantity of titania, were more effective. On the contrary, at the lowest Pt concentration, a marked drop of efficiency was demonstrated (Fig. 6). It is obvious that in the present range of concentrations and sizes, smaller and more numerous nanoparticles gave the highest hydrogen production rate, i.e. 12μmolmin−1. In a recent review paper [35], the role of Pt nanoparticle size is nicely explained as follows. When the size of Pt nanoparticles becomes smaller than about 1nm, quantum confinement effects raise the Pt work function very high (−2.13eV w.r.t. vacuum) while for the bulk platinum or for large nanoparticles the work function is −5.65eV. The corresponding CB level for nanocrystalline titania is −4.4eV while the valence band (VB) lies at −7.6eV. When the Pt particles become too small, no injection of electrons can take place since the metal then lies too high. When the particles are too large, then in addition to injection of electrons, holes can also be injected from the VB of titania onto the close-lying energy state of the metal. This, however, corresponds to facilitating electron–hole recombination. For this reason, metal particles should not be either too large or too small but be moderately small. Interestingly, the presently synthesized Pt nanoparticles, especially, the smaller ones seem to lie in the proper size range. Indeed, since the quantity of photocatalyst was 100mg, the rate of 12μmolmin−1 corresponds to 7.2mmolH2 h−1 g−1. This is a high rate for photocatalytic hydrogen production, much higher than it has been recorded in some cases [10,13–15,36,37] and comparable with some optimized other cases [12]. Some control experiments were also conducted using commercial titania Degussa P25 modified with Pt for further appreciation of the importance of the present results. Indeed, maximum rate of hydrogen production was then 4.8mmolH2 h−1 g−1, lower than the lowest quantity of hydrogen produced with aerogel samples. It is then obvious that the aerogels route produces more efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production."
9,Conclusions,Room temperature photocatalytic reforming of ethanol can be successfully realized using TiO2–Pt aerogel composites. These composites were obtained by mixing sol–gel synthesized titania with Pt colloidal suspension followed by supercritical drying and annealing at 500°C. The employed method of preparation of the composites allowed a relatively high catalyst specific surface and control of size and concentration of metal nanoparticles. Thus Pt nanoparticle size was controlled by the quantity of added trisodium citrate. Highest hydrogen production rate was reached in the case of the smallest size and the most concentrated Pt nanoparticles.
