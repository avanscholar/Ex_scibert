0,Introduction,"In 1973, Manassen [1] introduced the idea of biphasic catalysis by suggesting the use of two immiscible liquid phases, one holding the catalyst and the other the substrate. At the same time, Joó worked on homogeneous aqueous solutions at Debrecen, Hungary, contributing significantly on the development of aqueous biphasic catalysis [2]. Then, the initial idea of biphasic catalysis was appreciably stimulated by Kuntz's applied chemistry at Rhône-Poulenc [3,4]. Following Kuntz's experimental work and Joó’s continuing research work [5,6], Cornils’ group at Ruhrchemie AG managed to develop a commercial process for the oxo-synthesis of propylene to butyraldehyde in a two phase medium [7–9]. In 1984, the so-called Ruhrchemie/Rhône-Poulenc (RCH/RP) process was the first successful industrial scale-up of aqueous biphasic catalysis applied in a hydroformylation reaction, with a production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per annum in the plant of Oberhausen, Germany. The success of RCH/RP process lies at the use of RhH(CO)(TPPTS)3 water-soluble catalyst, which is eventually recovered with an easy, efficient and environmentally friendly way. It was shown that the same catalytic system applied in RCH/RP process could also hydroformylate mixtures of olefins. Rh/TPPTS complexes have been reported as effective catalytic systems for the hydroformylation of C4-alkene mixtures to C5-aldehydes [10,11]. Furthermore, Baricelli and coworkers achieved hydroformylation of C6-alkenes in aqueous biphasic media [12] and after few years, they mentioned the catalytic activity of RhH(CO)(TPPTS)3 complex in the biphasic hydroformylation reaction of C5–C7 olefins from a naphtha cut to the corresponding aldehydes achieving up to 86% conversion of the olefins during 200h of reaction time [13]. We have recently examined aqueous biphasic Rh/TPPTS-catalysed hydroformylation reaction of olefins present in the refinery light–light cracked naphtha (LLCN) from the Aspropyrgos refinery (Hellenic Petroleum S.A.) in Greece [14,15]. The highest conversion of 95.4% of the olefins present in the real LLCN was observed at 70°C, 100bar, at a short reaction time (6h). This was the first part of the two-step conversion process of LLCN olefins to strong anti-knocking alcohol mixtures (Scheme 1 ). The second part of the LLCN upgrade process is the in situ hydrogenation of the produced aldehydes of the hydroformylated LLCN to the corresponding alcohols catalysed by Ru/TPPTS complex in aqueous media (Scheme 1). Ru/TPPTS complexes have been reported as effective catalytic systems for the hydrogenation of aldehydes. Fache et al. [16] examined Ru/TPPTS-catalysed hydrogenation reaction of propionaldehyde in aqueous media. Then, Grosselin et al. [17] first reported the catalytic system RuCl3·xH2O/TPPTS for the hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal in aqueous two-phase system (water–toluene). Moreover, the hydrogenations of 3-phenyl-2-propenal [18–21], 2-butenal [18,19] and fructose [22] catalysed by Ru/TPPTS complexes have been reported successfully. Also, Tilloy et al. [23] investigated the Ru/TPPTS-catalysed hydrogenation of various aldehydes in the presence of cosolvents or cyclodextrins. Our research group studied for the first time the aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated naphtha model (mixture of 2-methylvaleraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, hexanal, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde) catalysed by Ru/TPPTS complex, which was generated in situ by direct addition of RuCl3·xH2O catalyst precursor to TPPTS (TPPTS=P[m-C6H4SO3Na]3, trisodium salt of m-trisulfonated triphenyl phosphine) [24,25]. The upgraded LLCN could potentially replace the harmful gasoline ether oxygenates (MTBE, ETBE, TAME) from the refinery blended gasoline pool [14,15,24,25]. In the current research work, a comprehensive overview of the two-step conversion of LLCN olefins to strong anti-knocking alcohol mixtures catalysed by Rh, Ru/TPPTS complexes in aqueous media take place. In addition, the salt effect in aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated naphtha model is examined along with the influence of the reaction time in biphasic hydrogenation of aldehydes present in a real refinery hydroformylated naphtha cut."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials and instrumentation,"2.1 Materials and instrumentation LLCN was granted by Aspropyrgos refinery (Hellenic Petroleum S.A.). RhCl3·3H2O and TPPTS were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as catalyst precursor and ligand for hydroformylation reactions, respectively. 2-Ethylbutyraldehyde, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde were obtained from Aldrich. Hexanal was obtained from Merck and 2-methylvaleraldehyde was purchased from Alfa Aesar. RuCl3·xH2O was purchased from Aldrich and used as catalyst precursor for hydrogenation reactions. Toluene extra pure and NaCl were obtained from Merck. Syn-gas (CO/H2 =1/1), H2, N2, Ar, Zero Air, and He 5.0N were purchased from Aeroscopio Hellas and Axarlis. CO/H2 (1/1) and hydrogen 5.0N were used in the hydroformylation and hydrogenation reactions, respectively, without further purification. Na2SO4 was used for drying and was obtained from Panreac. All the reactions were performed in 100mL Autoclave Engineers batch reactor which was equipped with a low carbon stainless steel vessel (316 LSS), an electromagnetic agitation system, a cooling–heating system, a central control unit (URC) and a sampling valve. The substrate and the products were analysed using a Perkin Elmer 8700 gas chromatograph (GC) with a flame ionisation detector (FID) and an Agilent 6890N/5973N GC/MS system both of them employing a Petrocol DH 150 capillary column (150m length, 0.25mm diameter, 1.0μm film). Column temperature was kept initially constant at 40°C for 5min. Then it was raised at 200°C at a rate of 2°Cmin−1 and remained there for 45min. Helium (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate 20cm/s at 175°C and 65psig. In order to clean the column from various remaining redundant compounds the oven temperature was kept at 230°C for 180min (the temperature of both the injector and detector was 280°C) prior to the analysis."
3,Analytical method,"2.2 Analytical method The methods of gas chromatography with FID and mass spectroscopy were used for qualitative analysis of the LLCN, of the hydroformylated and of the hydrogenated products. In the quantitative analysis of the substrates and of the products, it was important to correct the areas of the reported peaks of the GC, due to the existence of organic compounds in various homologous series. Owing to the complexity of the substrate and the lack of literature as far as it concerns the characterisation of complicated organic mixtures, the response factors (f i ) have been calculated by applying Ongkiehong's equations [26,27] and taking into consideration the theoretical approaches of the response in a FID [28–30] for both the reactants and the products of the reactions (Scheme 2 )."
4,Two-step conversion of LLCN olefins to alcohol mixtures,"2.3 Two-step conversion of LLCN olefins to alcohol mixtures The hydroformylation and hydrogenation reactions as well as the analysis of the products were carried out at the Petroleum & Natural Gas Chemistry & Technology and the Chemical Process Simulations Laboratories of the Department of Petroleum & Mechanical Engineering, of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology. All manipulations and reactions were performed under argon or nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques [31]. In the beginning of the experimental procedure for both catalytic reactions (hydroformylation, hydrogenation), deoxygenation of distilled demineralised water was carried out via an ultrasonic cleaning bath under high vacuum for 3h prior to use. Zero time of the reaction was taken when the temperature inside the autoclave reached the preferred value. At the end of every run the autoclave vessel was rapidly cooled in ice and salt, the stirring was stopped and the reactor was vented before opening it. A separation funnel was used to divide the withdrawn reaction mixture into two phases. Immediately then, the organic layer was analysed by gas chromatography. In the hydroformylations experimental procedure, the Rh/TPPTS catalyst used was prepared in situ by direct addition of RhCl3 to TPPTS in aqueous solutions. The redox reaction between RhCl3 and TPPTS in water–toluene biphasic system [32] and the syn-gas generate in situ the water-soluble catalytic complex RhH(CO)(TPPTS)3, which is one of the most efficient catalysts of homogeneous hydroformylation of olefins [33]. Thus, in a typical experiment, an aqueous solution of the RhCl3·3H2O catalyst precursor (22.6mg; 0.09mmol) and TPPTS ligand (248mg; 0.34mmol) in water (15mL) together with LLCN (7.5mL; 42.90mmol olefins) in toluene (7.5mL) were fed in the stainless steel autoclave reactor. The reactor was then purged with syn-gas at room temperature. Later, syn-gas (CO/H2 =1/1) pressurisation and heating were taken place according to the desired reaction pressure and temperature. In the hydrogenations experimental procedure, a pot with the substrate (2-methylvaleraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, hexanal, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 molar ratio) was stirred gently in ambient temperature in order to achieve better homogenisation of the aldehydes mixture. The Ru-TPPTS catalyst used was prepared in situ by direct addition of RuCl3 to TPPTS in aqueous solutions. Thus, in a typical experiment, an aqueous solution of the RuCl3·xH2O catalyst precursor (11.7mg; 0.04mmol) and TPPTS ligand (110mg; 0.18mmol) in water (15mL) together with a 1:1:1:1:1:1 mixture of the six aldehydes (6mL; 44.21mmol) in toluene (9mL) were fed in the stainless steel autoclave reactor. The reactor was then purged with hydrogen at room temperature. Afterwards, hydrogen pressurisation and heating were carried out according to the desired reaction pressure and temperature."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Light–light cracked naphtha characterisation,"3.1 Light–light cracked naphtha characterisation A light–light cracked naphtha characterisation was performed by using a Perkin Elmer 8700 GC/FID and an Agilent 6890N/5973N GC/MS (MS library NIST 05). The LLCN (Table 1 ), which was obtained from Aspropyrgos refinery in Greece, was constituted by parafins (6%), isoparafins (31%), olefins (62%), and naphthens (1%). The LLCN contained un-substituted linear olefins (25.46%), mono-substituted branched olefins (33.81%) and cyclic olefins (2.26%). There were few more peaks in the GC report (indentified as C1–C3 alkanes and C5 dienes) that were rejected, due to their total negligible amount being less than 0.05mol%."
7,First step: aqueous biphasic catalytic hydroformylation of olefins from a refinery LLCN,"3.2 First step: aqueous biphasic catalytic hydroformylation of olefins from a refinery LLCN A series of experiments was carried out with temperatures in the range of 30–130°C, pressures between 25bar and 100bar, reaction times between 3h and 36h, TPPTS/Rh molar ratio in the range of 2–6equiv. TPPTS per atom of rhodium and olefins/Rh molar ratio between 125 and 1500 per atom of rhodium. At the end of all the hydroformylation reactions, the reaction mixture was strictly biphasic. The upper organic layer was colourless and it contained the produced aldehydes, while the catalyst remained in the yellowish lower aqueous layer [34]. 3.2.1 Influence of reaction pressure, temperature and time Table 2 presents the activity of the catalyst in the aqueous biphasic catalytic hydroformylation of olefins from a refinery LLCN as a function of syn-gas pressure, temperature and time. The rise of syn-gas pressure in the solution increases CO/H2 dissolution in the liquid phase and thus, CO/H2 concentration at the water–organic interface favouring so the formation and further stabilisation of RhH(CO)(TPPTS)3 catalytic complex [33,35,36]. Subsequently, a higher conversion was observed by increasing CO/H2 (1:1) pressure. The highest conversion of 95.4% of the olefins was observed at 100bar and 70°C during 6h of reaction. Furthermore, Table 2 shows that the yield of the hydroformylation reaction was increasing by raising the reaction temperature up to 70°C. For temperatures higher than 70°C, it was observed a decrease in the activity of the catalytic system in the presence of CO/H2. Under the last conditions with TPPTS/Rh molar ratio of 3.8equiv. of TPPTS per Rh atom the catalytic system appeared to be unstable above 70°C and for temperature higher than 130°C it seems to be totally deactivated [37]. The low conversion of 14.3% under 30°C revealed the mass transfer difficulties normally encountered in most biphasic systems without the use of any surfactants. Regarding the parameter of reaction time, it is worthy of remark that 40% of the olefins were hydroformylated within the first 3h of the experiments. For reaction times more than 3h, both conversion and yield continued to increase with small and steady steps. After 3h the reaction rate became much slower. This can be more likely explained by the fact that the remaining branched olefins are less reactive than the linear ones, which almost all of them have been already consumed within the initial 3h of reaction time. 3.2.2 Effect of TPPTS/Rh and olefins/Rh molar ratios The water-soluble ligand used in our catalytic system was trisulfonated triphenyl phosphine (TPPTS). All the experiments regarding the influence of TPPTS/Rh molar ratio were carried out at a temperature of 70°C and at a pressure of 75bar. According to Table 3 , the best results were obtained at a TPPTS/Rh molar ratio of 2–3equiv. of TPPTS per Rh atom. However, it must be noted that for TPPTS/Rh molar ratios higher than 4, the conversion of the olefins of the LLCN sharply decreased. This could spring from the fundamental issue of the generation of a vacant coordination site in the coordination sphere of the catalytic metal centre, allowing the coordination of the olefin and so the initiation of the catalytic hydroformylation of olefins in the water. On the other hand, an excess of TPPTS ligand in aqueous media shifts the equilibrium towards coordinatively saturated complexes, RhH(CO)(TPPTS)3 or RhH(CO)2(TPPTS)2, that are less reactive. In addition, the effect of the molar ratio of olefins/Rh in the aqueous biphasic hydroformylation of olefins present in naphtha was thoroughly examined. For this reason, seven olefins/Rh molar ratios, between 125 and 3000, were examined in order to find the highest possible catalytic activity at the specific reaction conditions, as shown in Table 3. It was observed that as the ratio of olefins/Rh was increased up to 1500 so higher was the TOF. The increase in TOF was indeed profound from 250 (TOF 35h−1) up to 1500 (TOF 436h−1) molar ratio of olefins/Rh. For molar ratio of olefins/Rh higher than 1500 it was noticed a decrease in the activity of the catalytic system in the presence of CO/H2. Probably, the active metal centres of the catalyst reached the zenith of their catalytic activity, as it is shown in the TOF column of Table 3. 3.2.3 Second step: aqueous biphasic catalytic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated naphtha model In the whole range of experiments, the model of hydroformylated naphtha consists of 2-methylvaleraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, hexanal, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 molar ratio. The above mixture of aldehydes (6mL) composes the substrate of the hydrogenation reactions. The 1:1:1:1:1:1 molar ratio was chosen for the sake of simplicity; due to the fact that the molar ratio of naphtha components varies from region to region. Toluene (9mL) was used as the organic solvent and together with the substrate composes the organic phase of the biphasic catalytic system. A series of experiments was carried out with pressures between 10bar and 70bar, temperatures in the range of 22–110°C, reaction times between 10min and 300min, TPPTS/Ru molar ratio in the range of 3–6equiv. TPPTS per atom of ruthenium and substrate/Ru molar ratio between 500 and 2000 per atom of ruthenium. At the end of the hydrogenation reaction, the upper organic layer was colourless and it contained the produced alcohols (2-ethyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, 2-phenyl-1-propanol and 3-phenyl-1-propanol), while the catalyst remained in the yellowish lower aqueous layer. 3.2.3.1 Influence of reaction pressure, temperature and time Table 4 presents the activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of the mixture of aldehydes as a function of hydrogen pressure, temperature and time. According to Table 4, a higher conversion was observed by increasing H2 pressure. The positive correlation of pressure and conversion could be possible explained by the increase of H2 dissolution in the liquid phase, during H2 pressure rise. Moreover, the increase of hydrogen concentration in the solution favours the formation and further stabilisation of RuHCl(TPPTS)3 catalytic complex [18,19,38]. Furthermore, a higher yield was observed by increasing the reaction temperature up to 100°C. For temperatures higher than 100°C it was observed a decrease in the activity of the catalytic system. This observation according to Fache et al. [16] and Heinen et al. [22] is due to deactivation and instability of the catalyst system since under these conditions it is favoured the creation of arenes’ complexes of the type [Ru(H)(n6-C6H5CH3)(TPPTS)2]Cl, that they reduce (oppose to) the activity of the catalytic system [18,19]. Therefore, it is revealed that the catalyst is not stable in the presence of hydrogen at temperatures above 100°C. The zero time of the reaction (start-up time) was regarded as the time moment where the system reaches the preset temperature (set point) and as the end of the reaction, the moment that the heating was stopped. Table 4 shows that the 18.9% of the substrate was hydrogenated within the first 10min of the experiments and a very steep increase of both conversion and yield rates was observed within the first 1h of the reaction. For reaction times more than 2h, both conversion and yield seem to be stabilised. The initially high increase and further stabilisation of conversion in connection with reaction time is a typical characteristic of most hydrogenation reactions [16,17,21,22,39]. Consequently, it appears that the optimal values of hydrogen pressure, temperature and reaction time in respect not only to high conversion and yield of the reaction, but also to the mildest conditions for hydrogenation, were 20bar, 80°C and 2h, correspondingly. 3.2.3.2 Effect of TPPTS/Ru and aldehydes/Ru molar ratios Previous research works on the hydrogenation of individual aldehydes using the RuCl3/TPPTS catalyst have revealed that the conversion is a strong function of the ligand to metal ratio [17–19,38]. TPPTS becomes highly soluble to the water phase due to the sulfonate groups. Subsequently, it is sensible to examine the effect of molecular ratio of L/Me to the catalytic activity of the active complex. All the experiments regarding the influence of TPPTS/Ru molar ratio were carried out at the temperature and pressure of 80°C and 20bar, respectively. Based on our experiments that are reported in Table 5 , it was clear that the best TPPTS/Ru molar ratio was 4–5equiv. of TPPTS per Ru atom. According to Grosselin et al. [17] and Nuithitikul and Winterbottom [38], the lack of TPPTS surplus leads to a reduction in the activity of the catalytic system. However, it must be noted that for TPPTS/Ru molar ratios higher than 5, the conversion of the mixture of aldehydes sharply decreased; possibly, large amount of TPPTS shifts the equilibrium towards coordinatively saturated species which are less reactive. In addition, four substrate/Ru molar ratios were tested, between 500 and 2000, in order to find the highest possible conversion at the optimal reaction conditions, as shown in Table 5. It was observed that as the ratio of aldehydes/Ru was decreased so higher was the conversion. The optimal substrate/Ru molar ratio for our series of experiments can be regarded to be the lower one, the ratio being 500. 3.2.3.3 Salt effect Table 6 compares the activity of the Ru/TPPTS catalyst in the hydrogenation of the mixture of aldehydes with and without addition of salt. In the presence of salt, it is worthy of remark that 66% of the aldehydes were hydrogenated to alcohols within the first 15min of the reaction (TOF=2607h−1); in contrast with the 20% yield of the corresponding experiment without salt (TOF=803h−1). According to Fache et al. [16,39], the presense of salt is a significant parameter in the aqueous biphasic catalysis. When the salt was added in the aqueous phase, the convertion of the mixture of aldehydes increased; since the cation favoured the coordination of the aldehyde to the catalyst. For a given cation (e.g. Na+) in the Ru/TPPTS-catalysed hydrogenation of propionaldehyde, the reaction rate increased according to the nature of the anion, with I− achieving the best results [16,39]. In fact, the key parameter of the enhanced activity in water depends on the nature of the salt rather than the precursor used. 3.2.4 Aqueous biphasic catalytic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated real LLCN The influence of the reaction time in biphasic hydrogenation of aldehydes present in a real refinery hydroformylated naphtha cut was also investigated. The substrate of this series of experiments was the products of the aqueous biphasic catalytic hydroformylation of olefins from a Greek refinery LLCN (step 1). The start-up time of the reaction was regarded as the time moment where the system reaches the temperature set point and as the end of the reaction, the moment that the heating was stopped. Table 7 reveals a positive correlation between the reaction time and the conversion of the including aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols. Particularly, there was a significant increase in the conversion of the reaction from 2h (22.5mol%) to 4h (70.9mol%), despite the complexity of the mixture."
8,Conclusion,"RhCl3/TPPTS and RuCl3/TPPTS catalysts were revealed as effective catalytic systems for the first and the second part, respectively, of the currently proposed two-step LLCN upgrade process in aqueous media. In the first step (hydroformylation reaction) the highest conversion of 95.4% of the olefins present in a real LLCN was observed at 70°C, 100bar, at a short reaction time (6h). The second step (hydrogenation reaction) was significantly boosted in the presence of salt and 66% of the aldehydes were hydrogenated to strong anti-knocking alcohols within the first 15min of the reaction (TOF=2607h−1). The ultimate upgraded LLCN could potentially replace the harmful gasoline ether oxygenates (MTBE, ETBE, TAME) from the refinery blended gasoline pools with an in situ and an environmentally friendly catalytic process. Further research, with encouraging preliminary results, is in progress not only on the field of properties optimisation of the ultimate fuel, but also on one-pot synthesis of strong anti-knocking alcohol mixtures from olefins through Rh/Ru tandem catalysis [40]."
