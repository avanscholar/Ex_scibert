0,Introduction,"There is a growing need for “green” technologies in the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals intermediates. In this context, an important target is to achieve the highest possible selectivity and thus minimize the additional costs of separation of by-products and waste removal that may be a critical factor in a small scale synthesis [1]. Oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, in particular benzyl alcohol (BzOH) to benzaldehyde (BzH), is an important organic transformation. BzH is a very valuable chemical which has widespread applications in perfumery, dyestuff and agro chemical industries [2–4]. Conventional methods for performing such transformations generally involve the use of stoichiometric or more than stoichiometric quantities of inorganic oxidants, such as chromium (VI) reagents, dimethyl sulfoxide, permanganates, periodates or N-chlorosuccinimmide (NCS) [4]. The increasing demand for environment-conscious chemical processes has impelled many researchers to explore truly efficient oxidation methods using aqueous H2O2, an ideal oxidant in this context: hydrogen peroxide is by far the least environmentally demanding among the peroxides; in fact, water is the only by-product of these reactions. However, hydrogen peroxide is a rather weak oxidant. Thus in order to become synthetically significant, the oxidations by hydrogen peroxide need to be catalyzed [5]. Among the oldest, but very efficient, catalysts which have been well studied [6–9], the derivatives of some transition metal ions, i.e. V, Mo and W, in their highest oxidation states, are still under active investigation. The metal precursor adds hydrogen peroxide in an equilibrium process largely shifted to the right [10]. The intermediate 1 is thus formed in which n is usually 1 or 2 (Scheme 1 ). The peroxometal complex 1 is the real oxidant in solution. Species such as 1 can be, in several instances, isolated and stored: they may be used as stoichiometric oxidants with synthetic relevance [11,12]. Anionic peroxomolybdenium complexes, for example, rendered soluble in chlorinated solvents by the presence of a lipophilic counter cation, allowed to obtain in a monophasic system quantitative yields of aldehydes from primary alcohols [11]. An alternative procedure consisted in a two-phase method oxidation with hydrogen peroxide under phase transfer conditions: a neutral lipophilic ligand acts as extracting agent. For example, the commercial ammonium molybdate, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in combination with a phase transfer catalyst, (n-C4H9)4NCl, and a base (K2CO3), catalyzed the selective oxidation of secondary alcohols with H2O2 in THF solvent with a molar ratio alcohol:H2O2:catalyst of 10:40:1. The more hindered alcohol moiety was selectively oxidized in the presence of a less hindered one with a conversion of 90% in 6 days [13]. Na2WO4·2H2O and Na2MoO4·2H2O were used as catalysts and a lipophilic tetraalkylammonium compound as extracting agent in the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols in 1,2-dichloroethane by Bortolini et al. [14]. The molar ratio alcohol:H2O2:catalyst was of 10:20.2:1. For all the peroxo complexes generated in situ by using commercial Mo(IV), W(IV), an excess of H2O2 was used. In fact, a problem of aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant rises from its poor stability because it is liable to decompose while heated or in the presence of many metal ions. Therefore, there is a competition between the decomposition reaction and oxidation reaction. To overcome this problem, the peroxo anions of Mo(VI), W(VI) metals carrying active oxygen atoms should easily enter the organic phase. From this point of view, phase transfer agent must be able to extract the peroxo anions into organic phase. Shi and Wei [15] synthesized bis-quaternary phosphonium salts of peroxotungstate and peroxomolybdate in which the cation and counteranion are all bivalent: owing to the effective association between the two opposite charge, the peroxo anion carrying active oxygen atoms enters organic phase effectively. In this work, we report a novel method for selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH. Neither solvent nor promoters are needed: a polymeric microporous membrane acts as a barrier to “keep in contact” the organic phase containing the BzOH and the BzH and the aqueous phase with hydrogen peroxide. The species are transferred from one phase to the other only by diffusion: the membrane's role in the system studied in this work was to improve the contact between the two different reactive phases, the catalyst being physically separated from the membrane, realizing an inert membrane reactor [16,17]. The reaction between the reactants, controlled by diffusion across membrane, overcomes the limit of side reactions as over oxidation of the BzH to benzoic acid (BzA). The chemical and engineering community is already paying significant attention to the request for technologies that would lead the goal of technological sustainability [18,19]. A promising example with a lot of interest by process engineers is the strategy of process intensification. It consists of innovative equipment, design and process development methods that are expected to bring substantial improvements in chemical and any other manufacturing and processing such as decreasing production costs, equipment size, energy consumption, waste generation. Membrane operations, with their intrinsic characteristics of efficiency and operational simplicity, high selectivity and permeability for the transport of specific components, low energetic requirement, good stability under operating conditions and environment compatibility, easy control and scale-up, represent an interesting answer for the rationalization of chemical production. Among new unit operations involving membranes, membrane contactors are expected to play a decisive role in this scenario. The key concept is to use a solid, porous, hydrophobic (or hydrophilic) polymer matrix in order to create an interface for mass transfer and/or reaction between two phases. Whereas the design of the conventional devices is restricted by limitations in the relative flows of the fluid streams, membrane contactors give an active area, which is independent of the liquid fluid dynamics [20]. In the oxidation of BzOH to BzH using a membrane contactor unit, described in this work, various reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, type of membrane, type of catalyst, the addition mode of hydrogen peroxide were investigated. Being a pioneering study, a reaction time of 4h without analyzing the system lifetime in long time runs was investigated. Three different membranes based on hydrophobic polyvinilidene fluoride (PVDF) were prepared by phase inversion technique induced by nonsolvent [21] and used as membrane contactor. The membranes are characterized by different thicknesses (30μm, 50μm and 70μm), porosity, tortuosity and microstructures (finger or nodular like). The catalysts used were commercial sodium tungstate, Na2WO4 and ammonium molybdate, (NH4)6Mo7O24. From both an economic and environmental viewpoints, the selective system proposed in this study working in absence of organic solvents has as consequence the reduction of toxic waste and by-products making the process ecologically more acceptable. In fact, one of the major problems encountered in various processes for producing organic fine chemicals, is the use of organic solvents. Hence, it is appropriate that organic transformations under solvent-free conditions are attracting increasing attention [22]."
1,Theory,
2,Mass transport model,"2.1 Mass transport model Due to the “compartimentalization” of the two reagents reactions, the mass-transfer processes involved in bringing the reactants together and product oxygenates diffusing out off the membrane may have a strong influence over the complete catalytic performance (Scheme 2 ). For an optimal performance, resistances to mass transport should be minimized and reaction should be carried out in a reaction-limited regime. All the membranes used in this work are asymmetric porous (see Section 3, Table 1 ). Therefore, the diffusivity through them (D eff) differs from diffusivity on the bulk (D 0). The value of D eff is in general determined by porosity (ɛ), tortuosity (τ) of the porous structure and from steric hindrance: (1) D eff = D 0 ε τ Θ with (2) Θ = [ 1 − r s / r p ] 4 where r s is the Stokes radius of the reagent and r p the mean radius of the pore [23]."
3,Experimental,
4,Chemicals,"3.1 Chemicals BzOH (MW=108.14g/mol, purity 99.99%) from Sigma-Aldrich was used both as reagent and as solvent. BzH (MW=106.12g/mol, purity 99.99%) and BzA (MW=122.12g/mol, purity 99.99%) from Sigma-Aldrich were used for analytical calibrations. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (MW=1235.86g/mol, purity 99.98%), sodium tungstate dihydrate, Na2WO4·2H2O (MW=329.85g/mol, purity 99.99%) from Sigma-Aldrich were employed as catalysts. Hydrogen peroxide H2O2 (30wt% solution in water) from Sigma-Aldrich was the oxidant. For the preparation of polymeric membranes, PVDF Solef 6020 was supplied from Solvay Inc.; N,N-dimethylacetammide (DMA, reagent grade), acetone used as solvents, were purchased from Fluka; water, used for the coagulation bath, was double distilled."
5,Apparatus,"3.2 Apparatus Experimental tests were carried out in a simple reactor made with a two compartment cell to separate the organic and the aqueous phases (Fig. 1 ). The system was in a flat sheet configuration with a membrane surface area of 4.91×10−4 m2. The phases were stirred by magnetic stirrers and thermostated by a water bath at the different reaction temperatures tested (333K, 343K, 353K). Three different PVDF membranes, M1–M3, prepared by phase inversion induced by nonsolvent were used in the experiments according to different procedures reported in Ref. [21]. The polymer was dissolved at 25°C (M1) and at 60°C (M2) in the solvent DMA at 10wt% and 12wt%, respectively. The solutions were magnetically stirred for at least 1 day to guarantee complete dissolution of the polymer. The solutions were cast uniformly onto a glass substrate by means of a hand-casting knife (BRAIVE Instruments) with a knife gap set at 250μm and then immediately immersed in a coagulation bath of water. A different procedure was used for the preparation of M3. The polymer (10wt%) was dissolved at 25°C in DMA (24wt%) and acetone (64wt%). The solution was magnetically stirred for 1 day to guarantee complete dissolution of the polymer. The solution was casted onto a glass substrate by means of a hand-casting knife (BRAIVE Instruments) with a knife gap set at 250μm and exposed to air for 3h. Then, the cast film was immersed in a coagulation bath of water. After complete coagulation, the membranes (M1–M3) were transferred into a pure water bath, which was refreshed frequently, for at least 24h to remove the traces of solvent. The membranes were stored in a deionised water bath until tested for water permeability. For SEM, permporometry, contact angle, thickness measurements, the membrane samples were dried at 60°C under vacuum. In Table 1, some important characteristics as thickness (δ), pore radius (r p), overall porosity (ɛ), tortuosity (τ) of these membranes have been reported. The membrane thickness was determined by a digital micrometer (Carl Mahr D 7300 Esslingen a.N.) and by SEM observation of the freeze-fractured cross-sections. The overall porosity, ɛ, of the membranes was calculated according to Eq. (3): (3) ε = 100 % × ( 1 − densit y membrane / densit y PVDF ) in which the density of the membrane was determined gravimetrically by weighing a sample of known area and thickness, known densityPVDF =1.78. Membrane pore dimensions (r p) were determined by means of a capillary flow porometer CFP 1500 AEXL (Porous materials Inc. PMI, Ithaca, New York, USA). The membrane tortuosity (τ) was calculated using Eq. (4): (4) R m = Δ P tm J w η w = 32 τ δ ε r p 2 where ΔP tm is the transmembrane pressure, R m the hydraulic membrane resistance, η w the water viscosity, J w the water flux through the membrane [24]. The water flux measurements were carried out using an ultrafiltration setup, Separem Type UFSCP, consisting of five parallel filtration cells, each one offering an effective filtration area of 19.2cm2. ΔP tm was varied from 1bar to 4bar and the temperature was fixed at 25°C. The morphology of the dried membranes (at 60°C overnight) was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Cambridge, Stereoscan 360, at 20kV. For cross-section analysis the membrane samples were freeze fractured in liquid nitrogen. All samples were sputter-coated with gold before analysis. Contact angles of water droplets on the membrane surfaces were measured by sessile drop method using CAM 200 contact angle meter (KSV Instruments Ltd., Helsinki, Finland)."
6,Oxidation reaction,"3.3 Oxidation reaction In a typical experiment, the membrane was located between the cell compartments with the top surface from aqueous phase side. Two hundred millimolar of BzOH in one of the two cell compartment and in the other one, 15mL of water, 4mmol of catalyst and 199mmol of H2O2 were loaded. Obtained results are reported as selectivity to BzH, BzOH conversion to BzH, H2O2 conversion to BzH at a reaction time of 4h."
7,Analysis,3.4 Analysis The analysis of the organic phase was carried by GLC using a 6890 network GC system of Agilent on a HP-5 (30m×0.320mm×0.25μm) column. The aqueous phase was analyzed for H2O2 by iodimetric titration using potassium iodide and sodium thiosulphate.
8,Results and discussion,"The BzOH oxidation to BzH happens by the following reaction: C 6 H 5 C H 2 OH + H 2 O 2 ⟶ cat C 6 H 5 CHO + 2 H 2 O The reaction progress was investigated for different reaction temperatures, mode of addition of hydrogen peroxide, catalysts and types of membranes."
9,Effect of temperature on the progress of the reaction,"4.1 Effect of temperature on the progress of the reaction Effect of reaction temperature on the progress of oxidation of BzOH was studied in the temperature range (333–353K). The experimental results are reported in Figs. 2 and 3 . It is observed in these experiments that BzOH conversion to BzH increased as temperature was raised, without a substantial loss of reaction selectivity (>97%). In fact, conversion of BzOH to BzH from 17.4% at 333K increased up to 74.3% operating at 353K. The same trend was observed for hydrogen peroxide conversion: from 17.5% to 74.4%. Specifically, the strong effect on the production of BzH operating at different temperatures was clearly visible from the start of the reaction (Fig. 3). The production of BzH proceeded for 120min with a similar trend operating at 343K and 333K (≈70g/L of BzH) whilst at 353K a higher concentration of product was achieved (258g/L). The different production of BzH at 343K and 333K became evident from 130min to 240min. Chaudhary and Sawant [25] observed the same strong influence of the temperature on the progress of the BzOH oxidation made in a conventional reactor with the catalyst in the H2O2 aqueous phase. They classified this reaction as very slow reaction, kinetically controlled for which reaction temperature influences the progress of the reaction significantly."
10,Effect of hydrogen peroxide addition mode,"4.2 Effect of hydrogen peroxide addition mode The addition of hydrogen peroxide mode was another important parameter investigated. In particular a constant amount of hydrogen peroxide of 199mol was added, testing two different ways: (i) one-step mode, with all H2O2 added at the start of the experimental run; (ii) pump mode, by adding the H2O2 slowly with a flow rate of 22.5mL/h. The experimental results are reported in Figs. 4 and 5 . The reaction with hydrogen peroxide added in one step proceeded for 90min with a similar trend compared to the addition mode of the oxidant by pump (Fig. 4). Then, an evident difference of BzH conversion during the time was observed operating in the two ways: at 120min, the BzH concentration was 25.8g/L after 2h in the first mode whilst 38g/L for the second one; at 210min the difference of BzH concentration in organic phase between the two addition modes is more of two times. The selectivity to BzH observed in the two cases is different, also is high: 96.0% for the first mode (one step), 99.2% for the second one (Fig. 5). H2O2 in the reaction mixture is consumed for oxidation of BzOH to BzH, which may be over oxidized to BzA; lost due to decomposition and unreacted in the reaction mixture. H2O2 consumed for the formation of product BzH and of by-product (BzA) was calculated; unreacted H2O2 was determined iodometrically and then H2O2 decomposed was calculated by difference. In Fig. 6 , the ratio of H2O2 consumed for oxidation of BzOH to H2O2 self decomposed as a function of reaction time is reported. The plots of Fig. 6 indicated that H2O2 is more effectively consumed for the oxidation of BzOH when added in 1h by means of the pump compared to the addition in one step."
11,Effect of the membrane characteristics,"4.3 Effect of the membrane characteristics It is well known that the membrane porosity and pore sizes are two of the most important characteristics of all types of membranes. In a catalytic process, the membrane porosity and pore dimensions affect not only the permeation flux associated with the conversion and process capacity, but also the membrane catalytic efficiency and selectivity. In this study, in order to understand the effects of these membrane characteristics on the catalytic performance, three different asymmetric membranes (M1–M3) with different thicknesses, pore size and porosity (Table 1), but all based on PVDF were utilized. In Fig. 7 , the SEM analysis of the membrane cross-sections and of the two surfaces (top and bottom) for the three membranes M1–M3 is shown. M1 and M2 have a similar morphology characterized by the presence of macrovoids across the membrane cross-section on a thin skin layer. The structure of these two membranes is porous sponge in the bottom part, opposite to thin skin layer side. M3 is symmetric with a porous nodular structure. All the membranes surfaces are characterized by the presence of pores: the difference concerns their sizes as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1. Analyzing the selective side of the three membranes (top layer, Fig. 7(2)), M1 has pores of size of 0.2μm, M2 has the smallest pores (0.07μm). Due to the different preparation conditions which includes the presence of a volatile solvent added to that hydroscopic [21], membrane M3 has the biggest pores of 0.9μm. In Table 2 , the contact angle to water for the two membrane sides of M1–M3 have been reported. M3 has almost the same hydrophobic character for the two sides (top and bottom), with α value of ≈120°. However, the top and bottom layers of M1 and M2 membranes have different properties: for both the membranes, the top surface is more hydrophilic (92° and 80° for M1 and M2, respectively) than the bottom layer (>110°, for both). These different characteristics of hydrophobicity depended on the preparation conditions that are diverse for membranes M1, M2 compared to M3 as reported in literature [27]. During the reaction tests, the membranes were located in the membrane reactor with the top surface from the aqueous phase side. The results obtained are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . The results reported in Fig. 8 show that the type of membrane used at the interface between the two reaction phases effected the formation of BzH. In particular, very good system performance was observed by using membrane M3. The membrane M2 showed the worst results: the formation of BzH reached a plateau after 150min. At 240min a concentration of 60.6g/L was observed, very low value compared to the other ones obtained with M3 and M1, respectively of 484g/L and 333g/L. It is noteworthy that no loss of selectivity using all the three membranes was observed (Fig. 9). The reaction proceeded in three steps: (1) BzOH permeation across the membrane from the bottom surface. The selective layer (top layer) was at the interface membrane-aqueous phase, being the bottom part of the membrane completely porous. (2) Interfacial (membrane-aqueous phase) oxidation reaction. (3) BzH (insoluble in the aqueous phase) permeation across the membrane to the organic phase. The step 1 plays a crucial role to effect the performance of the conversion and for this reason we observed a difference using different membrane as contactors. On the basis of Eqs. (1) and (2), the diffusivity through a porous medium (D eff) is in general effected by pore size of the porous structure (r p), porosity (ɛ), tortuosity of the pore structure (τ). In particular, D eff increases with the value of Θ (Eq. (2)) and it is inversely proportional to τ. In Table 3 , the ratio ɛ/τ and the factor Θ for the three membranes have been reported. For the calculation of Θ, the r s of the molecules involved in the reaction is of ≈1nm [26]. The factor Θ is almost the same for the three membranes, whilst a difference is observed for the values of ɛ/τ ratio. For membrane M3 the ratio ɛ/τ is the lowest, and on the basis of Eq. (1) the diffusivity across this membrane is lower compared to the ones of M1 and M2. However, the correlation low diffusivity and then low transport with the high conversion of BzOH observed using M3 is not direct. In fact, if the porosity (ɛ), tortuosity (τ), pore size (r p) of the membranes are the only characteristics to explain the different reactivity observed with M1–M3, it is difficult to understand the difference of performance between M1 and M2. Another important factor must be taken in account to rationalize the different reactivity observed changing the membrane, i.e. the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the membranes. Decreasing the water contact angle (α) of membrane top layer in the order M3>M1>M2, water wettability increased: water filled membrane pores and hindered the transport from organic to aqueous phase, increasing the membrane resistance (R m) to mass transport from organic phase to aqueous phase. In fact, M3 with a top layer of 120° has lower water wettability and in this case low R m; however, at the opposite, using M2 characterized by a water contact angle of 80°, aqueous phase wets the membrane and higher R m to organic transport from organic to aqueous interface occurred. Therefore, the observed trend for the performance in terms of conversion (Fig. 9) i.e. M3>M1>M2, reflected the different hydrophobicity properties of the membrane top layers in contact with the aqueous phase (Table 2)."
12,Effect of different catalysts,"4.4 Effect of different catalysts Another factor studied in this work was the type of catalyst. Oxodiperoxo and peroxo complexes of Mo(VI) and W(VI) with H2O2 are well known oxidants used for oxidation of organic compounds [28]. Hence, the effect of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O on the conversion of BzOH was compared with that of Na2WO4·2H2O using membrane M1 and operating at 343K adding (by pump) of hydrogen peroxide. In Figs. 10 and 11 the results of catalytic tests have been reported. Ammonium molybdate gave higher formation of BzH during the time (333g/L, at 240min) compared to that with sodium tungstate (60.6g/L). Bortolini et al. [14] observed that the oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by Na2WO4·2H2O in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst gave high conversions when excesses ranging from 2-fold to 6-fold of hydrogen peroxide are used. In particular, with BzOH larger excesses of H2O2 over the substrate lead the formation of BzA [14]. In this work, no over oxidation to BzA occurs with both the catalysts as the selectivity observed indicated (Fig. 11). Influence of the pH of catalyst solution is under investigation and further research with other secondary alcohols is in progress."
13,Conclusions,"In this work, it was possible to demonstrate that the principle of using a catalytic membrane as interphase contactor in a biphase reaction in neat conditions is feasible. BzOH can be oxidized selectively to benzaldehyde with hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing agent and ammonium molybdate and sodium tungstate as catalysts. Between these two catalysts used, ammonium molybdate was found to be the best catalyst for oxidation of BzOH. Using this catalyst, the reported results show that hydrogen peroxide pumped for 1h in the aqueous phase, M3 as membrane contactor, a reaction temperature of 353K gave the best system performance in terms of selectivity to BzH (98%) and BzOH conversion (74%). It has been found that this system with a membrane contactor across the two reaction phases does not only work to produce BzH, but also essentially separates the product from the aqueous phase. Compared with the conventional reactor, the membrane plays a role similar to a phase transfer catalyst without need of organic solvents."
