0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important chemical in many industries such as the chemical industry (production of ammonia, hydrogenation, etc.), petrochemical industry, food processing, semiconductor industry, and in the metallurgical industry. The growth in hydrogen demand is already increasing significantly, and since hydrogen fuel cells is now near commercialization, hydrogen is expected to become one of the major fuels for energy generation in the future. Unfortunately, hydrogen does not exist in nature in its elemental form and, therefore, has to be produced from coal, petroleum, water or any other hydrogen-containing compounds, such as alcohols and hydrocarbons. Although electrical, thermal, biochemical and photonic energy or combinations of these are identified as the key commodities to drive hydrogen production process, there are currently four routes for hydrogen production: steam reforming, cracking, water electrolysis and gasification [1]. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) has recently received much attention as a potential alternative to energy conversion methods applied to aqueous/non-aqueous biomass sources [2–4] or fossil fuels such as coal [5], due to the unique physical properties of water above its critical point (i.e. 374°C and 22.1MPa). In addition, water behaves as an acidic and alkaline precursor for acidic or basic reactions, since the formation of both H3O+ and OH− ions takes place due to its self-dissociation at temperatures of near-critical and above critical point. Therefore, supercritical water is considered either as a solvent or as a reactant in the gasification processes of aqueous organic solutions [6]. In order to either manipulate the selectivity to produce the desired products in the gas effluent or to reduce the activation energy of the reactions, the use of catalysts is common in the gasification reactions at supercritical conditions of water. Moreover, reducing the activation energy of the reactions provides to obtain a hydrogen-rich gas at even low temperatures [7]. Increasing the gas product yields by the degradation of the organics and the intermediates, in this sense, along with the reduction to the lowest levels of tar and smut formations are also other advantages that the catalytic gasification processes have. Many researchers have tested the effects of different catalysts like Pt, Ni, Ru, Rh and Pd supported with some metal oxides, for hydrogen production from different feedstock such as glucose, cellulose, lignin and some real biomass compounds [7]. However, these catalysts exhibit different catalytic activities or gas compositions, depending on the feedstock used. Kruse et al. [8] have investigated the effects of Raney nickel as a catalyst during the gasification of pyrocatechol solutions in supercritical water. They have reported that Raney nickel increased the formations of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, decreased the formation of carbon monoxide and did not affect the formation of methane. In another study regarding the gasification of glucose by using Raney nickel, hydrogen formations in greater amounts were observed [9]. Osada et al. [10] have used Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst during the gasification of lignin, glucose and formaldehyde. According to their results, Ni/Al2O3 increased hydrogen formation for each biomass; however, it was observed that methane formation did not change significantly. In another study of the same authors, the use of Ni/Al2O3 increased hydrogen formation during the gasification of lignin [11]. At the same time, the formation of carbon dioxide and C2 C4 hydrocarbons increased, whereas methane and carbon monoxide decreased. As a result of the experiments made for the gasification of glucose at the conditions of 400°C and 24.5MPa by Lu et al. [12], it was mentioned that hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide formations increased. Similar conclusions were also obtained by Therdthianwong et al. [13]. Ruthenium catalysts are especially preferred for the catalytic gasification processes carried out at low temperatures. A remarkable increase in methane formation has been observed during the gasification lignin, cellulose and formaldehyde by using Ru/TiO2 at 400°C [10]. However, it was mentioned that the selectivity of this catalyst toward hydrogen production was not adequate. During the gasification of glucose using Ru/TiO2, the carbon conversion increased significantly [14]. The formations of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide increased; contrarily, the formation of carbon monoxide decreased. At the same time, Osada et al. [15] have reported that the formations of methane and carbon dioxide increased, and the formations of hydrogen and C2 C4 hydrocarbons decreased during the gasification of lignin by using Ru/TiO2 at 400°C. In another study, which involved the gasification of cellulose and sawdust by using Ru/C, it has been observed that both the gasification, hydrogen and methane yields increased [16]. Byrd et al. [17] have mentioned that Ru/Al2O3 increased the formation of hydrogen during the gasification of glucose at 700°C and 24.8MPa, and decreased the formations of methane, carbon dioxide and monoxide. In another study carried with ethanol, the same catalyst caused a change in the gas product composition [18]. According to authors’ comments, the reason of the decrease in methane content was its transformation into hydrogen via the reforming reaction. Onwudili and Williams [19] have reported that Ru/Al2O3 increased the formation of both hydrogen and methane. However, they have observed that the formations of carbon dioxide and C2 C4 hydrocarbons decreased. Osada et al. [20] have investigated the effects of Rh/C, Pt/C, Pt/Al2O3, Pd/C and Pd/Al2O3 as catalysts on the gasification reactions taking place at 400°C and 37.1MPa. The authors stated that the greatest methane selectivity was obtained when Rh/C was used as a catalyst, and the lowest selectivity for methane was obtained for the cases of Pd/C and Pd/Al2O3. On the contrary, the hydrogen selectivity of Pd catalyst was mentioned to be much more when compared with other catalysts. During the gasification of lignin with Rh/C, Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, similar hydrogen and methane selectivities were obtained [21]. Karakuş et al. [22] have reported that although Ru/Al2O3 exhibited much more catalytic activity for the gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water, its selectivity toward hydrogen production was not high enough when compared to Pt/Al2O3 in the experimental conditions. On the other hand, Pt/Al2O3 exhibited a very high selectivity toward hydrogen production at low temperatures and fast reaction times. In this work, hydrogen production from 2-propanol over Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr catalysts was studied in supercritical conditions of water. Ni/Al2O3 was chosen because it is a frequently encountered catalyst in SCWG studies published in literature; and Fe–Cr was chosen due to its rare use in this field of research and Fe being a common catalyst in processes like syngas production by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. The gasification yields, hydrogen yields and selectivities were investigated in the temperature range of 400–600°C and in the reaction time range of 10–30s. Since the experimental results obtained in our previous study [22] revealed that both the gasification and hydrogen yields decreased with decreasing pressure, all of the experiments were performed at a constant pressure of 25MPa. The hydrogen yields and selectivities of Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr used in this study, and those of Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 used in our previous work [22] were compared."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr were supplied commercially (Alfa Aesar) and used without further processing. SEM photos and the content analyses of the catalysts are showed in Fig. 1 . SEM images were obtained from scanning electron microscope (JEOL-5410LV) by using a Bath Scatter Electron Detector and a Secondary Electron Detector. XRF spectrums were obtained by using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and the elemental compositions of the catalysts are given in Table 1 . 2-Propanol (Merck) was used in the experiments after it was diluted with deionized water to the desired concentrations.
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Catalytic gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water was performed in a packed bed reactor system as described in previous work [22]. The experimental apparatus consisted of a packed bed reactor (10cm length×2cm i.d.) and a pre-heating line (50cm×4.35mm i.d.), which were placed into a PID controlled split furnace (Protherm). The weights of Ni/Al2O3 (d cat =2.17g/cm3) and Fe–Cr (d cat =2.0g/cm3) used in the reactor were 13.83g and 27.53g, and their shapes were in ring ribbed with hole form and in cylindrical form, respectively. From the feed pump to the gas–liquid separator, all of the wetted parts of the system were made of 316 SS. 2-Propanol solution in desired concentration was pumped into the pre-heating zone and the reactor placed in the furnace by using a high pressure pump (Autoclave Engineers). The feed flow rates were determined according to the reaction conditions for chosen reaction times (Eq. (1)). The temperature of the 2-propanol solution was provided to reach the desired value by passing through the preheating zone, before coming upon the catalyst in the reactor. At the exit of the furnace, the effluent was cooled rapidly by a heat exchanger and the possible reactions immediately stopped. The system pressure was maintained at the desired value in a precision of ±0.1MPa by a back pressure regulator (GO Regulator Inc.). The products leaving the back pressure regulator were separated by a gas–liquid separator. The gaseous effluent taken from the top of the separator was transported for quantitative analysis to a gas chromatograph capable of online sampling. After gas sampling, the flow rate of the gaseous effluent produced was measured at each experiment by a digital volumetric gas flow meter (Agilent, ADM2000), the ratio of which to the feed flow rate was used to determine the gasification yield. On the other hand, the samples taken from the liquid effluent were subjected to total organic carbon (TOC) analyses. The difference between the TOC value of the 2-propanol feedstock and that of the liquid sample obtained after an experiment was used to calculate the TOC conversion for a specific reaction condition, which informs about the carbon conversion taking place during gasification, according to Eq. (11)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The gas samples were analyzed according to ASTM D1945, ASTM D1946, ASTM D2597 and DIN 51872-4 methods, through a Perkin Elmer, Clarus 500 RGA-1115 model GC coupled with two TCD and one FID detectors. The concentrations of the 2-propanol solutions and liquid phase reactor effluents were characterized in terms of their TOC concentrations. TOC analyses were performed by using a total organic carbon-total nitrogen analyzer (Hagh-Lange), which was based on the combustion catalytic oxidation method and a highly sensitive multi-channel non-dispersive infrared detector was used."
5,Results and discussion,"Hydrogen production from 2-propanol was investigated by using two different catalysts, namely Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr, in a packed bed reactor at the supercritical conditions of water. During the gasification experiments, 0.5M dilute solutions of 2-propanol were used, with an initial TOC content of 18,000mg/L. The reaction time at supercritical conditions was calculated according to the equation written as below: (1) τ = V Reactor F ρ SC ( P , T ) ρ L where V Reactor is void volume of the packed bed reactor, ρ SC(P,T) and ρ L are the fluid densities in g/mL under reaction conditions and at feed pump conditions, respectively. F is the feed flow rate of 2-propanol solution in mL/s. Since the reaction media consisted of dilute mixtures of 2-propanol in water and no data was available for the density of 2-propanol–water mixtures at supercritical conditions, the fluid densities in the reactor at different reaction conditions were assumed to be those of pure water and the values were taken from the steam tables [23]. Although the main purpose of the study was hydrogen production, gases such as propane, propylene, methane and carbon dioxide were also produced during the catalytic gasification of 2-propanol. Besides these components, scarce amounts of ethane, n-butane, i-butane, 1-butene, i-butene, t-2-butene and 1,3-butadiene were obtained at some experimental conditions, but they were not taken into consideration for the general reaction pathway. In fact, as referred to some studies in literature, the mechanisms for the reactions taking place in supercritical conditions of water are not adequately enlightened so far. One of the reasons for this is their correlation with the ionic product of water, which is strongly dependent on temperature and density [24]. The ionic product of water below its critical temperature and at high pressures is three orders of magnitude higher than that of ambient water, making water an acidic/basic catalyst precursor and enhancing ionic reactions. However its ionic product attains a much lower value at high temperatures where the water density is low, supporting free radical reactions [25,26]. In the literature, emerging from this fact that water being an adjustable solvent regarding its varying ionic product, some reaction mechanisms were proposed for the gasification of glycerol [26], coal [27] and ethanol [28]. However, as also mentioned by Kruse and Dinjus [26] and Akizuki et al. [29], though the effects of water on the reaction kinetics have been partly explained, the details have not been completely understood. The knowledge on microscopic structuring is still poor and there is still much work to be done in order to understand the chemical reactions taking place in supercritical water. And regarding our work on the catalytic SCWG of 2-propanol, according to the components measured in gas analysis results, a possible mechanism for the reactions taking place may be presented through the equations given below: The decomposition of the organics: (2) C3H7OH+2H2O⇌3CO+6H2,ΔH 298 K =424.73kJ/mol (3) C3H7OH⇌C3H6 +H2O,ΔH 298 K =50.59kJ/mol (4) C3H7OH+H2 ⇌C3H8 +H2O,ΔH 298 K =−73.79kJ/mol Water gas shift reaction: (5) CO+H2O⇌CO2 +H2,ΔH 298 K =−41.1kJ/mol Methanation of CO: (6) CO+3H2 ⇌CH4 +H2O,ΔH 298 K =−206.2kJ/mol Methanation of CO2: (7) CO2 +4H2 ⇌CH4 +2H2O,ΔH 298 K =−165.0kJ/mol Methanation of C: (8) C+2H2 ⇌CH4,ΔH 298 K =−75.0kJ/mol In addition, side reactions responsible for carbon formation can take place. Boudouard coking (CO disproportionation): (9) 2CO⇌C+CO2,ΔH 298 K =−172.4kJ/mol Coke gasification: (10) CO+H2 ⇌C+H2O,ΔH 298 K =−131.3kJ/mol"
6,The effects of reaction temperature and time,"3.1 The effects of reaction temperature and time Fig. 2 shows the gasification yield, which stands for the amount of gaseous product obtained per the amount of 2-propanol solution fed to the reactor. The solid and dashed lines describe Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr, respectively. Accordingly, the gasification yields increased with reaction temperature and time for both catalysts as expected. But this increase was higher for Fe–Cr than for Ni/Al2O3. The maximum gasification yield was obtained as 14.66 L/L feed, with the use of Fe–Cr catalyst at 600°C and 30s. The gasification yield with Ni/Al2O3 remained about 9.5 L/L feed. Contrarily, the hydrogen content in the gas product decreased with increasing reaction temperature and time for both catalysts (Fig. 3 ). Since Ni/Al2O3 did not produce a remarkable gas product, the hydrogen content could not be measured at 400°C. But the selectivity toward hydrogen for both catalysts was much higher at low temperatures and reaction times. The highest hydrogen selectivity was measured as 70% for Fe–Cr at 400°C and 62% for Ni/Al2O3 at 450°C, for a reaction time of 10s. In order to see the catalyst effect on hydrogen production, a blank experiment was carried out without using any catalysts at 450°C. The regarding gasification yield and the hydrogen content of the gas product were measured as about 0.15 L/L feed and 2.5%, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). The results demonstrate that catalyst use enhanced hydrogen production, even though the amount of gaseous product was low at lower temperatures and reaction times. Lu et al. [12] have also mentioned that hydrogen yields and selectivities during glucose gasification increased sharply with the addition of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts. Similar trends have also been observed during the gasification of 2-propanol by using Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, in our previous work [22]. But the catalytic activity of Pt/Al2O3 on hydrogen production was much higher when compared with those of Fe–Cr and Ni/Al2O3 used in this study. Similar results have been also obtained by Fang et al. [30], regarding their study on the gasification of glucose by using Pt, Ni and Ru catalysts. They have observed that Pt was the most selective catalyst for hydrogen production when compared with Ni and Ru catalysts. The authors obtained a hydrogen rich gas (44mol% H2) with a 67-wt.% gasification rate. Dileo and Savage [31] have also reported that hydrogen was always the most abundant component and it represented about 70% of the total dry gas yield at 500°C, in their study on the gasification of methanol by using Ni wires as a catalyst in a batch reactor. Both the hydrogen content obtained and the raw material used by the authors is almost similar to this study. Fig. 4 presents the hydrogen yield, which is the produced hydrogen per reacted 2-propanol. The amount of hydrogen produced was calculated with the hydrogen content and the flow rate of the gaseous product based on ideal gas assumptions, and the reacted 2-propanol was identified according to the carbon conversion ratio (Eq. (11)) for each experimental run. The catalyst Fe–Cr was more effective in terms of hydrogen yield than Ni/Al2O3. The hydrogen yields for both catalysts increased with increasing reaction temperature and time. But these increments were due to the increase of the flow rate of the gaseous product with increasing reaction temperature and time, even though it came to ear nice. Considering Fig. 3, the hydrogen content of the gaseous product for both catalysts decreased with increasing reaction temperature and time. This is because of hydrogen giving place to other gases such as propylene, propane, methane and carbon dioxide, respectively, with increasing temperature and time. Youssef et al. [4] have also mentioned that the hydrogen gas yield increased with an increase in temperature; and the highest hydrogen yield of 1.5mol/mol glucose was obtained with commercial Ni/silica–alumina in the range of 400–500°C in their study on the gasification of glucose. Unfortunately, there is no study in literature for the comparison of Fe–Cr as a catalyst in supercritical water gasification. However, Tapah et al. [32] have used Fe2O3 +Cr2O3 as a catalyst for the gasification of glycerol. They have reported that high temperatures and low feed concentrations tended to increase the gas yield and selectivity toward hydrogen production with some char. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the highest hydrogen yields obtained according to the catalysts Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr used in this study and the catalysts Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 used in our previous study. While the highest hydrogen yields were obtained between 100 and 150mmol per mol reacted 2-propanol at 600°C for the catalysts Ni/Al2O3, Fe–Cr and Ru/Al2O3; it was about 1050mmol per mol reacted 2-propanol at 400°C for Pt/Al2O3. Moreover, the hydrogen content of the gaseous product was 95mol% [22]. Therefore, it can be said that Pt/Al2O3 was a catalyst to be much more selective and have activity for hydrogen production from 2-propanol at supercritical conditions of water. Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was seen to show a higher gasification activity toward methane in our previous work [22]. The aforesaid catalyst favored methane formation according to the water gas shift reaction and methanation of CO reaction given with Eqs. (5–6), which consumed a part of the hydrogen produced and eventually decreased the hydrogen yield. It has been presumed that oxygenated compounds containing hydroxyl groups adsorb to the catalytic Ru surface predominantly through one or more oxygen atoms [7]. First the reactant undergoes dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface, followed by subsequent cleavage of C–C or C–O bonds. Cleavage of C–C bonds leads to synthesis gas which is subjected to the water–gas shift reaction and possible methanation reaction, while cleavage of C–O bonds gives organic acids and alcohols [7]. Youssef et al. [33] have also reported that Ru/Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest gasification activity toward methane in their study on the catalytic gasification of oleic acid over various catalysts in supercritical water. At the same time, they have mentioned that Ru/Al2O3 and powder Ni/silica–alumina surpassed other catalysts in terms of hydrogen yield, which was four times higher than that without a catalyst. Therefore, since catalysts exhibit different activity or gas composition according to the feedstock used, additional studies regarding hydrogen production by using different catalysts for different feedstock should be made [34]. During the gasification of 2-propanol over Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr catalysts, a serial reaction pathway occurred. This serial reaction is carried out as a function of reaction temperature and time. Fig. 6 shows the component change in the gaseous product with increasing reaction temperature. Fig. 6a and b present the change for Fe–Cr catalyst; c and d present those for Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, at the reaction times of 10 and 20s, respectively. At low temperatures and times, the hydrogen was formed by the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol. Then, propane and propylene formations increased with increasing reaction temperature and time. But at higher temperatures and times, these gases decreased and gave place to methane and carbon dioxide formations. In the reaction over Ni/Al2O3, propane formation was not observed and the serial reaction went forward via propylene. The results show that, in order to obtain a hydrogen rich product, the reaction should be carried out over Fe–Cr and Ni/Al2O3 at low temperatures and low reaction times during the gasification of 2-propanol at supercritical condition of water."
7,Kinetic evaluation of the catalytic gasification,"3.2 Kinetic evaluation of the catalytic gasification Fig. 7 shows the change of TOC conversion of the liquid effluent with temperature and time. The carbon conversion can be calculated with respect to the equation given below: (11) Carbon conversion ( % ) = 1 − TOC in liquid phase ( mg/L ) TOC in feedstock ( mg/L ) × 100 A blank experiment that involved the direct gasification of 2-propanol without any catalysts was also carried out to observe the effect of catalyst use on gasification at 450°C. Accordingly, it can be seen that TOC conversion significantly increased when a catalyst was used and Ni/Al2O3 was much more effective on the gasification rate than that of Fe–Cr. For both catalysts, the gasification rate increased with temperature and reaction time. Fig. 7 also demonstrates that temperature had a more prominent effect on the gasification rate than that of reaction time. As seen from Fig. 1, the catalysts used have a nonporous structure, and the reaction occurs at the outer surface of catalyst. Because of no intra-diffusional effects, the catalytic decomposition taking place in supercritical water can be described as follows: (12) − d [ C n ] d t = k 0 exp ( − E a / R T ) [ C n ] a [ H 2 O ] b where [H2O] and [C n] and are the concentrations of water and the reactant in mmol/L, respectively. a and b represent the reaction orders, E a is the activation energy and k 0 is the pre-exponential factor that are received from Arrhenius equation. The experimental data show that water had a role either as a reactant or a reaction media in supercritical conditions. However, since the water amount in the reaction medium was generally greater than 98%, the reaction order term b in Eq. (12) becomes 0 and the effect of H2O concentration changes is neglected. In terms of TOC, the expression for the reaction rate becomes as follows: (13) − d [ TOC ] d t = k 0 exp ( − E a / R T ) [ TOC ] The TOC conversion term is defined with Eq. (11). After Eq. (13) is rearranged with respect to TOC conversion term, the reaction rate can be expressed as (14) d X d τ = k 0 exp ( − E a / R T ) TOC 0 a − 1 ( 1 − X ) a Under supercritical conditions, the initial TOC concentrations at the entrance of the reactor were calculated from measured feed stock concentrations: (15) [ TOC ] 0 C TOC 12 ⋅ ρ SC ( T , T ) ρ L where C TOC and [TOC]0 are the feedstock and initial reactant concentrations in mg/L and mmol/L, respectively. if Eq. (14) is rearranged with respect to the TOC conversion term X, using the initial condition X =0 at reaction time t =0, it can be solved analytically to provide Eq. (16): (16) X = 1 − 1 + a − 1 k 0 exp − E a / R T TOC 0 a − 1 τ 1 / 1 − a for a ≠ 1 The regression analysis of Eq. (13) for the catalytic hydrothermal decomposition data gives a first-order reaction rate expression for Fe–Cr catalyst. However, the regression analysis of Eq. (13) for Ni/Al2O3 data gave a large deviation for the first order reaction rate. Therefore, nonlinear regression analysis was applied according to Eq. (16). It was found that the catalytic hydrothermal decomposition of 2-propanol over Fe–Cr proceed according to the reaction rate order of 0.8. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor values predicted are summarized in Table 2 for Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr, respectively. A comparison between the predicted and experimental TOC conversions is also shown in Fig. 8 . As it can be seen from the figure, the dashed lines that indicate a deviation of ±5% conversion from the 45° line contain most of the data points. Hence, it can be said that the proposed model fits satisfactorily with our experimental data."
8,Conclusion,"Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were tested for hydrogen production by the gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water. The experiments showed that catalyst use improved the gasification yield, and at low temperatures and reaction times Fe–Cr was much more selective for hydrogen production when compared with Ni/Al2O3. A gaseous product consisting of 70.6mol% hydrogen was obtained from the gasification of 0.5M 2-propanol solution, when Fe–Cr catalyst was used. However, the hydrogen yield was very low at these conditions. The hydrogen yield increased with increasing temperature and reaction time but its selectivity decreased. This situation can bring separation problems after the gasification process. When the catalysts Ni/Al2O3 and Fe–Cr used in this study are compared with the catalysts Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 used in our previous study, Pt/Al2O3 was seen to be a much more selective catalyst and have activity for hydrogen production from 2-propanol at supercritical conditions of water."
