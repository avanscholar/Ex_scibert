0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is foreseen as a clean energy carrier in relation with the rapid development of fuel cell technologies. Indeed, its use in a fuel cell produces electricity and heat with only water as a by-product. However, hydrogen is presently produced essentially from fossil hydrocarbons, and only marginally by water electrolysis or from renewable resources. The use of biomass as a hydrogen source has recently drawn attention as it is abundant worldwide and renewable, whereas its utilisation has a near-zero CO2 impact on the carbon life cycle. Although hydrogen can be produced by direct gasification of solid biomass [1,2], the catalysts poisoning by liquid tars and solid chars formed during the process remains a major issue. The wide variety of biomass sources (energy crops, agricultural and forest residues, industrial and municipal waste, etc.) can differ considerably in composition (poisoning compounds, ashes) and moisture content, which implies adapting the process and the catalyst to the feed. Another important drawback to the direct utilisation of solid biomass is its low energetic density, leading to high transportation costs. Such issues can be overcome by first liquefying the biomass through a fast pyrolysis process [3–5]. The product, called pyrolysis oil or bio-oil, actually consists in a complex mixture of oxygenated organic molecules and water. As a liquid, pyrolysis oils are easier to transport and store, and possess an energetic density nearly five times higher than solid biomass. However, bio-oils are thermally unstable and decompose upon heating. Recent studies proved that hydrogen could be produced from crude bio-oils by either steam reforming (SR) [6] or sequential cracking catalytic reactions (CC) [7,8]. Although the hydrogen yield is higher with the SR process, the reaction is energetically demanding and some carbon cannot be eliminated by the simple addition of steam, which poses the problem of stability and long-term operation. By alternating cracking steps, where the pyrolytic oil is decomposed into H2, CO x and coke, and regeneration steps, where the coke is burned by O2 addition, the CC process provides an interesting means of controlling the coke formed during the pyrolysis oil cracking. Moreover, the process may run autothermally. The complexity of bio-oils makes unlikely any direct insight into the mechanism and the kinetics of the reactions. Therefore, many studies were restricted to model compounds of bio-oils such as acetic acid, alcohols, phenol, aldehydes and sugars. Acetic acid is one of the major constituents of bio-oils, and is fairly representative of its light components and water-soluble fraction. Since the pioneer work of Wang et al. [9,10], the steam reforming of acetic acid has been studied by several authors [6,11–17], from the viewpoint of reaction mechanism, catalysts deactivation and resistance to coking. The objective of the present study, in relation with our previous work on sequential cracking of crude bio-oils [7,8], was to gain a better insight in the catalytic sequential cracking process, by the use of acetic acid as model compound. This paper reports as Part I of the study an investigation of the cracking/regeneration process. After a rapid screening of noble metals and Ni-based catalysts, expected to exhibit a different reactivity towards carbon storage and removal, the reaction conditions were investigated, with the objective of optimising hydrogen production and catalysts regeneration. The continuous production of a hydrogen-rich gas by sequential reactions in two reactors working alternately is demonstrated. In the Part II, the structural and redox modifications of Ni-based catalysts, induced by the cracking/regeneration sequences, will be reported in details."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts,"2.1 Catalysts 2.1.1 Ni-based catalysts A 10wt.% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation of γ-Al2O3 (SPH 501A, Rhodia) with an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate. After drying at 100°C for 12h, the powder was calcined at 800°C for 4h in air (heating rate 1°C/min), yielding the catalyst with a light blue colour. The powder was then pressed, crushed and sieved to a particle size range of 200–300μm. A 3.1wt.% Ni–2wt.% K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst was provided by Johnson Matthey. This catalyst was calcined at 500°C. The particle size was in the 50–100μm diameter range. 2.1.2 Noble metal-based catalysts One weight percent NM/Al2O3 catalysts (NM=Pt, Rh, Ru, Pd) were prepared by wet impregnation of γ-Al2O3 (Alpha-Aesar 3μm) with platinum hydroxide tetrammine, rhodium nitrate, ruthenium acetylacetonate and palladium nitrate, respectively. After drying at 100°C, the powders were calcined at 550°C for 4h in air (heating rate 1°C/min)."
3,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.2 Catalytic activity measurements The experiments were conducted in a fully automated test rig. A U-shaped quartz reactor was loaded with 200mg catalyst. The reactant, acetic acid, was sent as liquid by a syringe pump to a nozzle heated at 120°C. The vaporized droplets were mixed to flowing argon to achieve a total flow rate of 100mL/min. The stability of the acetic acid partial pressure in the flow was controlled by a mass spectrometer. All gases were sent through a set of automated valves, enclosed in a heated box (120°C), which allow programming and controlling the sequences via a remote desktop. Prior to catalytic activity measurements, the Ni-based catalysts were reduced at 650°C under 30% H2 in Ar (total flow 100mL/min) for 1h, whereas the NM/Al2O3 catalysts were reduced only at 350°C under similar gas flow conditions. The activity measurements were conducted by alternating cracking and regeneration sequences. These sequences were separated by a purge under 100mL/min Ar, in order to clearly evidence the gases produced during each step and avoid mixing the H2 produced during the cracking step and O2 sent during regeneration. During the cracking steps, the acetic acid/Ar mixture was sent in the reactor, and during regeneration the reactant flow was switched to a 100mL/min 20%O2/Ar flow, unless stated otherwise. The product gases were sent to the analysis system, which was composed by a mass spectrometer (MS, VG Prolab300) and two gas chromatographs (GC, Agilent HP 6890). One GC was equipped with a TCD detector and two capillary columns (PoraplotQ and 5Å Molesieve) in series, allowing analysis of H2, O2, CO, CO2 and CH4. An automated valve placed between the two columns was used to prevent sending poisoning molecules (CO2, H2O, acetic acid) to the Molesieve column. The second GC was equipped with a FID detector and an Innowax capillary column for oxygenated compounds (acetic acid and all C1–C10 oxygenated compounds) analysis. The mass spectrometer was used for continuous monitoring and quantitative analysis of the gaseous products stream, which was checked in addition by periodic injections in the gas chromatographs (i.e. at the end of each cracking step). Both analytic systems were in good agreement. Catalytic experiments coupled with in situ thermo-gravimetric measurements were performed on a fully automated bench equipped with a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM 1550 series, Rupprecht & Patashnick) and with an on-line micro-gas chromatograph (Agilent, for H2, CO, CO2, CH4, O2 analyses) and a mass spectrometer (Inficon) for products analysis. The catalyst mass introduced in the reactor was 90mg. The mass variations of the catalyst bed could be measured with an accuracy of ≈10μg. 2.2.1 Mass balance calculations The carbon balance was calculated from the following equation: Balance C = n CO + n C O 2 + n C H 4 + n coke 2 n C H 3 C O 2 H × 100 with n coke = n C O 2 regen + n CO regen (n =number of moles) The hydrogen balance was calculated by Balance H = 2 n H 2 + 2 n H 2 O + 4 n C H 4 4 n C H 3 C O 2 H × 100 with n H 2 O = 2 n C H 3 C O 2 H − n CO − 2 n C O 2 ."

6,Study of the cracking step,"3.1 Study of the cracking step 3.1.1 Thermodynamic analysis and mechanistic considerations Fig. 1 shows the calculated yields in products obtained by decomposition of acetic acid between 300 and 800°C, at the thermodynamic equilibrium. Acetic acid is totally converted above 300°C. At low temperature (<500°C), carbon is predicted to be the main reaction product. The formation of gaseous products (mainly H2, CO and CO2) becomes predominant above 500°C. At 800°C, H2 and CO are the only products. The formation of by-products like acetone or ethylene remains limited to traces in the whole temperature range. Methane is formed in relatively high amounts at low temperatures (300–500°C), but its formation decreases regularly with temperature and remains marginal above 700°C. From a mechanistic viewpoint, the overall reactions system involved in AA cracking is very complex. Gas phase as well as catalytic reactions can take place, according to the following reactions (1)–(12): • Decomposition: (1) CH3COOH→2CO+2H2 (2) CH3COOH→CO2 +CH4 (3) CH3COOH→C2H4,C2H6,coke,… • Ketonization: (4) 2CH3COOH→CH3COCH3 +CO2 +H2O Secondary reactions: • Water–gas shift: (5) CO+H2O⇆CO2 +H2 • Methane steam-reforming (also applies for higher hydrocarbons): (6) CH4 +H2O→CO+3H2 • Methane dry reforming: (7) CH4 +CO2 ⇆2CO+2H2 • Methanation: (8) CO+3H2 ⇆CH4 +H2O (9) CO2 +4H2 ⇆CH4 +H2O • Coke gasification: (10) C+CO2 ⇆2CO(Boudouardreaction) (11) C+H2O⇆CO+H2 (12) C+2H2 ⇆CH4 Addressing the respective role of each reaction in the overall cracking process would require detailed mechanistic and kinetic investigations, far beyond the scope of this study. Some mechanistic features based on 18O2 labelling experiments will be presented in Part II. The objective of the present work was to set experimental conditions leading to an optimum hydrogen production during cracking and to the complete removal of coke during regeneration. 3.1.2 Screening of catalysts for acetic acid cracking Several catalysts based on noble metals (NM) or Ni-supported on γ-Al2O3 were tested for acid acetic cracking in the 600–800°C temperature range. Fig. 2 shows the conversion of acetic acid and the selectivity to H2 obtained during cracking steps of AA at different temperatures, performed for 5min under isothermal conditions. Each cracking step is followed by a regeneration step under oxygen, which removes the carbon deposited during cracking (not shown on the figure). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the two Ni-based catalysts, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 show the highest activity: from 600°C, the conversion of AA is total, whereas the hydrogen selectivity is the highest and close to the equilibrium value. Noble metals-based catalysts are much less active between 600 and 700°C: at 700°C the conversion of AA is not total over Rh and Ru. It should be mentioned that AA cracking over pure alumina (data not shown) also gives high AA conversions (90–98%) at temperatures above 650°C, probably catalyzed by acidic sites of alumina, but mainly into carbon and water, and with a H2 selectivity lower than 5%. This suggests that the initial decomposition of AA (reactions (1)–(3)) is essentially non-catalytic, whereas secondary reactions involving the decomposition products (steam and dry reforming of methane, WGS) are mostly catalytic (reactions (5)–(7), (10)–(12)). Pt and Rh give a significantly higher selectivity to H2 than Pd and Ru, but nevertheless lower than that of Ni. Although the two Ni catalysts are more loaded in metal than the NM catalysts (10wt.% for Ni/Al2O3, 4wt.% for Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3, vs. 1wt.% for all NM), they clearly perform better than NM catalysts in the whole temperature range studied. These two catalysts were therefore selected and compared for further studies and optimisation of the sequential cracking process. 3.1.3 Sequential cracking of acetic acid cracking with Ni-based catalysts: study of the cracking step The duration of the cracking step is important regarding the possibility of a viable sequential process. Several factors can lead to shorten the cracking step: a fast build up of coke in the catalyst bed can cause a plugging of the reactor, thus preventing any further operation. The catalyst can also deactivate rapidly due to coke poisoning, leading to a decrease in acetic acid conversion and in hydrogen selectivity, or to the appearance of undesired by-products. Fig. 3 depict the evolution of the gaseous products stream (H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and acetone) analysed by MS during a single cracking/regeneration sequence, i.e. 20min cracking of AA followed by an inert purge and a catalyst regeneration under oxygen. During the whole run, the m/e signal corresponding to acetic acid is equal to zero, which indicates that acetic acid is completely converted. Rapidly, the targeted partial oxidation products, H2 and CO, appear together with CO2 and CH4. H2O is also formed (not shown for the sake of clarity), its formation corresponding to the establishment of the reverse WGS equilibrium (at this temperature, the WGS equilibrium is shifted towards CO+H2O formation, or RWGS). After 18min cracking, an increase of the CH4 production together with the appearance of a signal corresponding to acetone is observed. The latter products might indicate the deactivation of Ni by carbon. Methane is formed by primary decomposition of AA (reaction (2)), and an increased methane formation suggests that coked Ni cannot anymore ensure its steam reforming. In line with this observation, the formation of acetone reveals a reaction taking place on the alumina support: acetone is formed by ketonization of AA on pure oxide supports, according to reaction (4), and particularly on γ-Al2O3 as shown by Pestman et al. [18]. In the case of AA steam reforming over Pt/ZrO2, Takanabe et al. [14] also showed that acetone starts to appear in the products stream when the catalyst deactivates due to coke deposition. Therefore, in order to achieve the highest selectivity in hydrogen, the cracking steps should be limited to a maximum duration of 15min under the applied reaction conditions. Fig. 3 also reports the catalyst mass variation measured during the catalytic activity experiments performed in an oscillating microbalance under similar conditions. A continuous increase of the catalyst mass is observed during the whole cracking step, as expected from the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst bed. After 20min under reactants, the catalyst mass increase is ≈8mg, which corresponds to a relative mass increase of ≈9% and represents ≈8% of the total carbon introduced as acetic acid during the run. 3.1.4 Influence of temperature on the catalytic activity The influence of temperature on the catalytic activity was studied by conducting the cracking/regeneration sequences at different temperature thresholds. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the product selectivity during cracking sequences performed under various isothermal conditions, between 650 and 800°C, on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Since the sequential cracking is a non steady-state process, the direct comparison with the thermodynamic equilibrium might be irrelevant. However, in the temperature range studied, the selectivity in hydrogen varies between 78 and 86%, which is not far from the predicted thermodynamic composition (Fig. 1). The effect of temperature is more marked on the carbon deposition, which strongly decreases as the temperature increases, as predicted by the thermodynamics: at 650 and 700°C, ≈25% of the carbon introduced as acetic acid is deposited as coke on the catalyst during each cracking step. This amount decreases to ≈11% at 750°C, and falls below 9% at 800°C. The carbon gasified at high temperature appears mainly transformed into CO, as shown by the high CO selectivity (75–80%) at 750 and 800°C. However, the WGS equilibrium also shifts towards CO formation at high temperature, and this reaction also contributes to an increase of the CO/CO2 ratio with temperature. A satisfactory carbon balance, close to 100%, can be calculated for each cracking step, whatever the temperature (Fig. 4B). The hydrogen balance (Fig. 4A) is always showing a slight deficit (93±5%), probably because it is less accurately calculated than the carbon balance, since the water content is not analysed but deduced from mass balances. 3.1.5 Stability of catalysts during repeated cracking/regeneration sequences As shown in Fig. 4, the gaseous products composition remains quite reproducible within repeated cracking/regeneration sequences, which suggests that the catalysts performances are not affected by the redox cycling. The stability of the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst will be demonstrated below (Section 3.3), by testing the catalyst in sequences of AA cracking (15min)/regeneration (10min) for 48h at 700°C without any apparent catalyst deactivation. 3.1.6 Comparison of performances of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 in AA cracking Table 1 compares the gaseous products and coke selectivities obtained during cracking sequences at 700°C over Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 is significantly more selective towards H2 than Ni/Al2O3. It also withstands better to coke deposition. A little more methane, however, is formed with the promoted catalyst."
7,Study of the regeneration step,"3.2 Study of the regeneration step As shown previously, during each cracking step a part of the carbon from acetic acid remains stored on the catalyst and deactivates it. The objective of periodic catalyst regeneration under oxygen is to remove this carbon, in order to restore the activity of the catalyst and its carbon storage properties. Therefore, the effect of oxygen partial pressure and of regeneration temperature were investigated, with the aims of obtaining a complete removal of carbon in a time compatible with the duration of the cracking steps, and of avoiding a too high temperature rise of the catalyst, which could be detrimental to its activity. 3.2.1 Influence of the oxygen partial pressure The Ni–K catalyst, after being submitted to the cracking of acetic acid for 15min at 700°C, was regenerated at the same temperature. The oxygen partial pressure was varied in the range 50–200mbar (5–20vol.% O2). Fig. 5A and B depicts the evolution of the coke combustion products, CO2 and CO, during catalyst regeneration. The temperature rise due to the strong exothermicity of the reaction (ΔH r =−406.4kJ/mol for carbon combustion) was also monitored by a thermocouple placed in the middle of the catalytic bed (Fig. 5C). In both figures, the time scale is taken as t =0 when O2 is sent to the reactor. In all cases the regeneration is very rapid, and the gas profiles return to the baseline in less than 90s, which indicates that the regeneration is complete. This assessment is confirmed by thermo-gravimetric measurements, showing that the mass gain observed during AA cracking is totally cancelled out during the regeneration (Fig. 3). CO and CO2 are formed together, but CO in quantities 50–100 times lower than CO2. When the oxygen partial pressure is increased, the reaction is quicker and more intense. Moreover, increasing the O2 content increases the CO2/CO ratio. With 20% O2 in the gas phase, the catalyst regeneration is completed in less than 1min. The combustion of the coke accumulated during 15min of AA cracking leads to an increase of the catalyst temperature (Fig. 5C): the higher the O2 content, the more intense the temperature rise. During the regeneration under 20% O2, a temperature increase of 62°C was monitored. However, this temperature is only indicative and does not represent the actual temperature variation of the catalyst particles. The temperature rise depends on the amount of carbon burnt. Therefore, shortening the cracking steps, and consequently limiting the carbon deposition, minimises the exothermicity of the regeneration. At low oxygen content (5%), a broad signal is observed both in the CO x production profiles and the temperature variations. These signals appear as a combination of two peaks, suggesting that two distinct carbon forms, with different reactivities towards O2, are burnt successively when the oxidizing conditions are mild enough. 3.2.2 Influence of reaction temperature on catalyst regeneration The reaction temperature of the cracking step has a strong impact on gaseous products distribution and on the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst (see Fig. 4). As expected from the thermodynamics, the higher the cracking temperature, the lower the amount of carbon stored on the catalyst. The temperature of the regeneration step also influences the catalyst activity during the periodic regenerations. The rate of CO x produced during catalyst regeneration under 20% O2 at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 6 . CO2 is always formed predominantly compared to CO. It should be mentioned that the cracking of AA was previously performed for 5min at the same temperature as the regeneration. The initial rate of CO2 production is apparently independent of the reaction temperature, and the maximum intensity of the CO2 peaks decreases when temperature increases. However, since the oxygen consumption is always total at the beginning of the regeneration steps, the rate of carbon combustion is limited by the mass transfer of oxygen. Fig. 7 shows the evolution of carbon removal with time, over the two Ni-based catalysts, at different regeneration temperatures, after performing AA cracking steps of 5min at the same temperature. As a general trend, the fraction of carbon removed at the beginning of the reaction increases exponentially with time up to ≈50% or slightly more, then the reaction slows down due to carbon depletion and catalyst temperature decrease. When the cracking of AA is limited to 5min, the maximum temperature rise during the regenerations, measured by a thermocouple placed inside the catalyst bed, is +20°C. The initial reaction rate increases with temperature, with the exception of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 650 and 700°C for which the slopes are virtually identical at the beginning of the regeneration. At the same temperature, the reaction is always faster on Ni/Al2O3 than on Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3: the time required to remove 50% of the deposited carbon is always slightly longer with Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3, whatever the temperature (Table 2 ). This is probably related to the lower Ni content in Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3. The two catalysts present significant differences as regards the amount of carbon removed during the regeneration and the CO/CO2 ratio, as shown in Fig. 8 . At 650°C, ≈7mg of carbon are removed as CO2 and CO at each catalyst regeneration. However, at higher temperatures, the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst clearly bears less carbon after AA cracking than Ni/Al2O3. Moreover, only very few CO is formed during the regeneration of the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst (<2.5% of total CO x ), whereas CO represents 3.5% of the total CO x formed during the regeneration of Ni/Al2O3 at 700°C, and up to 40% at 800°C. Transient CO formation at the beginning of the regeneration can result from partial coke oxidation (Eq. (13)) related to oxygen transfer limitations (oxygen is completely consumed, as can be seen in Fig. 3), or from the reverse Boudouard reaction (Eq. (10)), which is favoured at high temperature. (13) 2C+O2 →2CO There is always more CO formed over Ni/Al2O3 than over Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 during the regeneration, even at 650°C, temperature at which the amount of deposited carbon is roughly the same on the two catalysts. Since the Ni content is ≈3 times higher in Ni/Al2O3 than in Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3, the rate of coke combustion is probably faster on Ni/Al2O3, which could indirectly favour the partial oxidation (13) because of more severe oxygen transfer limitations. The higher Ni content in Ni/Al2O3 could also promote the reverse Boudouard reaction (10)."
8,Continuous hydrogen production by use of two parallel fixed bed reactors working alternately,"3.3 Continuous hydrogen production by use of two parallel fixed bed reactors working alternately In order to feed a molten carbonate fuel cell with an H2-rich gas, a continuous production is required. Since the cracking/regeneration process is a transient process, two parallel reactors working alternately are necessary. This has been realised on a fully automated test bench according to the scheme shown in Fig. 9 . The cracking/purge/regeneration/purge sequences were adjusted to 15/2/10/3min, respectively. A continuous H2-rich gas production has been achieved for 48h under the applied conditions (Fig. 10A). The conversion of acetic acid is total during all the experiment, and H2, CO, CO2 CH4 and H2O are the only gaseous products detected. The hydrogen selectivity remains stable between 85 and 95%, and tends to increase slowly with time on stream, as does the CO selectivity. The CH4 and CO2 selectivities decrease simultaneously. This suggests a slow catalyst activation with time on stream, which can be related to a structural evolution, as will be discussed in the Part II paper of this study. An enlargement of the catalytic activity measurements (Fig. 10B) reveals slight differences in gaseous products selectivities between the two reactors. The hydrogen selectivity is always higher in reactor 2, whereas the reverse is true as concerns CH4 selectivity. This can be attributed to a slight temperature (and/or pressure) difference between the reactors. Some fluctuations in the gaseous products stream also appear at each reactor switching. In a similar process using two parallel reactors operated cyclically to produce hydrogen by stepwise methane steam reforming, in which methane is decomposed into H2 and C deposited on the catalyst in one reactor whereas in the second reactor the deposited carbon is gasified by steam, Choudhary et al. [19] also evidenced a slight difference in the products stream composition between the two reactors. Nevertheless, in each reactor the cracking sequences are highly reproducible, as shown in Fig. 10B."
9,Discussion,
10,Comparison of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts in the sequential cracking of AA,"4.1 Comparison of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts in the sequential cracking of AA Pure γ-alumina showed very low activity to crack AA into hydrogen (H2 selectivity ≈5%). The presence of metallic catalytic sites is clearly necessary to efficiently reform AA into H2, CO and CO2. In this sense, nickel appears more active than noble metals-based catalyst, as the result of Ni high activity for hydrocarbons cracking and steam reforming reactions. By TPD of acetic acid adsorbed on a Ni/La2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, Basagiannis et al. [16] also observed an important production of H2, CH4, CO and CO2 above 200°C. In the temperature range studied (650–800°C), the cracking temperature has only a moderate effect on the hydrogen selectivity, which varies between ≈78 and ≈86% with the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4). However, increasing the cracking temperature significantly reduces the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts and modifies the CO/CO2 ratio during the cracking step, as the result of the WGS equilibrium shift. Although both Ni-based catalysts show high activity in AA cracking, the selectivity in H2 is clearly higher with Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 than with Ni/Al2O3. There is also less carbon deposition on Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 during cracking, and less CO formed during regeneration under O2. It is well known that basic promoters have a strong effect on the resistance to coking: K-doping promotes H2O dissociation on oxide supports and carbon gasification with steam. Lanthanum oxide can be involved in the carbon cycle: lanthanum oxycarbonate layers have been found to decorate Ni particles under CH4/CO2 reforming conditions [20], participating with Ni in a bi-functional reaction mechanism and hindering the formation of coke. Therefore, the Ni–K catalyst shows better performances, both in terms of hydrogen selectivity and of carbon utilisation, than Ni/Al2O3. A little more methane, however, is formed on Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 than on Ni/Al2O3 during AA cracking. This could be related to the lower amount of Ni in Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 (3wt.%) than in Ni/Al2O3 (10wt.%), less Ni sites being therefore available for methane steam reforming. The regeneration of catalysts by coke combustion under oxygen is very rapid (≈1min) provided that enough oxygen is supplied (10–20vol.%, Fig. 5). It is also faster when the oxygen concentration increases, with less CO formed. The coke deposited during AA cracking is completely removed during the regeneration, in the temperature range studied (650–800°C). The reaction is very exothermic, the exothermicity depending on the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst, which is controlled itself by the cracking step duration and temperature: after 15min AA cracking, a temperature spike >60°C was observed during the regeneration of Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst at 700°C in the presence of 20% O2. Although severe, this regeneration is apparently not detrimental to the catalysts activity, and suggests that air could be used directly to regenerate the catalysts."
11,Comparison of products yields by cracking and steam reforming reactions,"4.2 Comparison of products yields by cracking and steam reforming reactions With the Ni–K/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst, each cracking sequence rapidly stabilises to a flow rate of 8–9.5mL/min H2 at 700 and 750°C, respectively, with an inlet composition of 5mL/min gaseous AA. This represents a H2 yield of 80% or 95%, calculated according to reaction (1) in which 1mole AA gives 2mole H2. The gaseous products stream also contains important amounts of CO (6.5–8mL/min), which in the case of feeding a MCFC can be directly utilized in the fuel cell. Rioche et al. [6] investigated the SR of various model compounds of bio-oils in a fixed bed reactor. In the case of acetic acid steam reforming at a H2O/C ratio of 2, the best H2 yield, obtained with a Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalyst at 712°C or 760°C, was 66% (calculated on the basis of reaction (14) i.e. 1mole AA gives 4mole H2). (14) CH3COOH+2H2O→2CO2 +4H2 Similarly, Marquevich et al. [11] obtained H2 yields in the 73–78% range by SR of AA at H2O/C=6 and temperatures between 650 and 740°C. Steam reforming of acetic acid conducted at lower temperature (350°C) showed that the poisoning of a Pt/ZrO2 catalysts by carbon is rapid [15], but Hu et al. obtained a good stability with unsupported bimetallic Ni–Co catalysts at 400°C during 70h time on stream, at H2O/C=7.5. By the use of different Ni-based catalysts in a fluidized bed reactor, Galdamez et al. [13] produced hydrogen with yields in the 45–100% range at 650°C (calculated on the basis of the SR reaction (14)). The catalyst composition had a strong impact on the of the gaseous products stream composition. In a fixed bed reactor, it appears difficult to obtain quantitative H2 yields by steam reforming of AA. In comparison, the H2 yields obtained by catalytic cracking are significantly higher, but the reaction stoichiometry (reaction (1)) obviously works against the cracking (cracking could theoretically give 2mole H2 per mole AA, whereas the SR gives 4mole H2 per mole AA). Water vaporisation, however, is very costly in terms of energy input."
12,Interest of the sequential catalytic cracking process,"4.3 Interest of the sequential catalytic cracking process Sie proposed in [21] a classification of reactors technologies and process operation in relation with the rate of catalyst deactivation. Fixed bed swing reactors are particularly suitable when the catalyst deactivation is irreversible and the catalyst has to be regenerated periodically (i.e. due to carbon poisoning), with catalyst lifetimes in the 100–2000h range. The Catofin process for dehydrogenation of isobutene [22], however, operates with swing bed reactors and a typical cycling time of 20min. Non-stationary processes has been previously applied to the production of CO-free hydrogen from methane [19,23,24], in view of PEM fuel cells applications. For the same reason, circulating fluidized bed reactors are used in FCC [22,25]. In the present work, the objective was to produce hydrogen to feed a MCFC: this type of fuel cell can actually stand high CO amounts, since it is oxidised internally as a fuel by the fuel cell. We have shown in Fig. 10 that the sequential cracking process, although a non-stationary process, can generate a continuous H2-rich molten carbonate fuel cell feed, by the use of two fixed bed reactors working alternately. Although not really optimised, the reaction conditions chosen there (15min AA cracking at 700°C, 10min regeneration under 20% O2 separated by short Ar purges) appear suitable to efficiently manage the cracking/purge/regeneration sequences. The cracking reaction indeed produces less hydrogen than the steam reforming, but the main interest of sequential cracking resides in its much lower energy input: in the case of crude bio-oils, we have calculated that the heat supplied by the combustion of coke during the regeneration is superior to the heat required in the cracking steps, which means that the process could run autothermally [7]. The second interest of sequential cracking is that it prevents, by frequent catalyst regeneration, any catalytic activity loss due to coking. Recently, the use of a cycling process to produce hydrogen has shown another valuable advantage: by combining a Ni-based methane steam reforming catalyst with a CO2-sorbant in two reactors working alternately, Li et al. [26] showed that CO2 can be efficiently separated, leading to high-purity hydrogen coupled to CO2 sequestration."
13,Conclusions,"A sequential process, which alternates cracking and regeneration steps, has been used to produce hydrogen by cracking of acetic acid. The conditions leading to an optimum hydrogen production during AA cracking and to the complete removal of carbon during catalyst regeneration have been studied. From the results presented in the present study, the following conclusions can be drawn: • The typical order of activity of various catalysts tested in AA cracking was: Ni-based catalysts≫Pt>Rh>Pd≈Ru. • AA cracking produces a H2 +CO-rich gas suitable to feed a MCFC. The reaction temperature has a strong impact on the composition of the gaseous products stream, and on the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst during each sequence. The carbon deposition is reduced when the reaction temperature increases. • The catalyst regeneration under O2 is very rapid. The combustion of coke forms mainly CO2. The rate of regeneration depends on the O2 partial pressure and on the regeneration temperature. The reaction is highly exothermic, but the exothermicity can be minimized by adjusting the cracking step duration. • The K and La-promoted Ni catalyst is more selective in H2 than Ni/Al2O3, and nearly no CO is formed during its regeneration. • The sequential process was successfully operated in two parallel fixed bed reactors operated cyclically: the continuous production of an H2-rich gas was achieved for 48h."
