0,Introduction,"The paradox of the burgeoning energy demand and gradually diminishing fossil fuels motivates humans to seek and develop renewable and environmentally benign energy sources [1–3]. H2 fuel is considered as a kind of ideal sustainable energy succedaneums due to its multiple benefits such as high energy density and non-polluting combustion products [4,5]. During the past decades, electrocatalytic water splitting as a very promising method used to produce H2 with high purity has drawn extensive attention. Nevertheless, being the paramount semi-reaction in water electrolysis, the anodic OER has long been a bottleneck because of its tardy sophisticated four-electron reaction kinetics that requires comparatively high redox potential, which immensely hinders the whole course of water decomposition to generate H2 [6–8]. Additionally, the oxygen (O2) generated through the anodic reaction is of limited value, the mixing of potential gas (H2 and O2) may result in explosions, posing safety hazards [9,10]. To settle the above conundrums, one viable route has been proposed to electrolytic H2 generation via superseding the sluggish anodic OER with thermodynamically more auspicious organic molecules oxidation reactions. Compared with the OER, these anodic reactions do not only harvest upgraded oxidation products, but also efficaciously reduce the voltage entailed for the entire electrolysis system, resulting in the energy-saving production of H2. Currently, numerous progress has been obtained, such as the electrolysis of alcohols [11–14], glucose [15–18] and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [19–23] in alkaline aqueous medium. Ethanol, one of the most widely used organic compounds, obtained from the fermentation of plants is exceedingly attractive because it is cheap, its preparation process is simple and it has low toxicity. Previous reports on EOR mainly centered on the precious metal Au, Pd-based catalysts [24–26]. However, their scarcity and high price severely impede their widespread applications. Hence, designing and developing economical and highly active electrocatalysts for both EOR and HER is imperative. Owing to the impressive optical and electrical properties, natural-abundant transition metal chalcogenides, such as CuS, Ni3S2, CoS2 and Co3S4, have received great research attention [27]. Compared to monometallic sulfides, bimetallic sulfides possess multiple valence states and constituents resulting in more exceptional electrochemical reaction activities [28]. It has been verified that thiospinel structure compounds with the ideal formula AB2S4 possess superior catalytic properties because of the synergistic effect of the different metal cations [28–30]. For example, Liu and co-workers designed a self-assembled copper cobalt sulfide (CuCo2S4) electrocatalyst, which displayed a much lower overpotential than that of Co3S4 at 10 mA cm−2 for OER [31]. In another study, Deka et al. synthesized a two-dimension CuCo2S4 nanosheets electrode using ethylenediamine as the surfactant, which also exhibited more preferable activity compared to IrO2 and Co3S4 toward OER [32]. Notwithstanding these advances, to the best of the researcher’s knowledge, there are few in-depth researches on CuCo2S4 in both EOR and HER till date. Recent works have also certified that the electrocatalytic behaviors of catalysts could be strongly enhanced via optimizing their morphology and surface architecture [33–36]. Hence, in this work, we designed and constructed a kind of hollow needle-like CuCo2S4 on carbon cloth as bifunctional electrocatalyst (CuCo2S4/CC) for both EOR and HER. This elaborated self-supported CuCo2S4/CC supplies robust electrical linkage between the current collectors and active species. Also, the unique hollow needle-like architecture not only supplies sufficient exposure to active sites but also facilitates diffusion of electrolytes and rapid escape of H2 bubbles. Benefitting from the synergy effect of copper and cobalt, the as-fabricated self-supported CuCo2S4/CC electrode shows admirable catalytic activities for EOR, needing a potential of only 1.38 V to supply 10 mA cm−2. It also displays acceptable electrocatalytic performance in HER with a potential of −0.16 V (@-10 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the homemade ethanol–water electrolysis cell employing CuCo2S4/CC as two symmetric electrodes only demands a comparatively low voltage of ~ 1.59 V to actuate 10 mA cm−2, surpassing the ordinary water electrolysis (1.74 V) and also some state-of-the-art alkaline water electrolysers."

2,Fabrication of copper cobalt hydroxide (CuCo-OH) precursor on carbon cloth,"2.1 Fabrication of copper cobalt hydroxide (CuCo-OH) precursor on carbon cloth The details of the materials and chemical reagents are presented in the Supporting information. Typically, the pretreated carbon cloth (CC, 2.5*3 cm) was vertically immersed into 35 mL of aqueous solution, which contains 1.0 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 2.0 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 15.0 mmol of CO(NH2)2 and 3.8 mmol of NH4F. The hydrothermal reaction was executed at 120 °C for 6 h to obtain self-supported CuCo-OH/CC. After the reaction, the sample was rinsed with water and ethanol thoroughly and then dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for further use."
3,Fabrication of hollow needle-like CuCo2S4 array on carbon cloth,"2.2 Fabrication of hollow needle-like CuCo2S4 array on carbon cloth In a facile sulfidation process, 3.0 mmol of Na2S·9H2O was dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water under magnetic agitation for 20 min and then decanted into a 50 mL reaction kettle. Afterwards, the as-prepared CuCo-OH/CC was vertically immersed into the above solution and reacted at 160 °C for 8 h. Finally, the sample was rinsed with water absolutely and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The obtained sample was labelled as CuCo2S4/CC."
4,Fabrication of CuS and Co3S4 on carbon cloth,"2.3 Fabrication of CuS and Co3S4 on carbon cloth The synthetic routes of CuS/CC and Co3S4/CC are similar to that of CuCo2S4/CC. The main difference is that Co(NO3)2·6H2O was not added in the first step of hydrothermal reaction when CuS/CC was synthesized, while Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was not added when Co3S4/CC was synthesized."
5,Electrochemical methods,"2.4 Electrochemical methods The performance of the as-constructed electrocatalysts in EOR and HER was assessed via a normal three-electrode configuration, where carbon rod, Ag/AgCl and self-supported electrocatalysts (1 cm*1 cm) served as counter, reference and working electrodes, respectively. The ethanol–water electrolysis test was executed in a symmetrical two-electrode device. The details of the physical characterization methods are described in the supporting information."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Formation mechanism, crystalline structure and morphologies of the catalysts","3.1 Formation mechanism, crystalline structure and morphologies of the catalysts The self-supported CuCo2S4/CC electrocatalyst was fabricated via a two-step procedure as depicted in Fig. 1 . Initially, the hydrolyzed OH−, CO3 2− as well as NH4 + from urea and ammonium fluoride reacted with Cu2+ and Co2+ cations to form needle-like copper cobalt hydroxide (CuCo-OH) precursor array on the conductive substrate CC via a scalable hydrothermal process. Afterwards, the OH− and CO3 2− anions of the CuCo-OH precursor were substituted by S2− derived from sodium sulfide solution, resulting in the formation of hollow needle-like CuCo2S4 array grown on the carbon cloth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to analyze the phase structure and composition of the as-fabricated electrocatalysts, as displayed in Fig. S1 and Fig. 2 a. Fig. S1a presents the XRD pattern of CuCo-OH/CC. Except for the two intensive diffraction peaks that are attributed to the carbon cloth, the others can be indexed to Cu3(OH)2(CO3)2 (JCPDS No. 11–0682) and Co(CO3)1/2(OH)·0.11H2O (JCPDS No. 48-0083), indicating the formation of copper cobalt hydroxide precursor on the carbon cloth. Fig. S1b and c show the XRD patterns of CuS/CC and Co3S4/CC. Besides the diffraction peaks of the carbon cloth, the others can be well assigned to the covellite CuS (JCPDS No. 06–0464) and linnaeite Co3S4 (JCPDS No. 42–1448), respectively. Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the CuCo2S4/CC. Apart from the diffraction peaks of the carbon cloth, the other peaks located at 2θ = 16.1°, 26.6°, 31.3°, 38.0°, 47.0°, 50.0°, 54.8° and 77.3° can be well indexed to the (1 1 1), (0 2 2), (1 1 3), (0 0 4), (2 2 4), (1 1 5), (0 4 4), (1 3 7) planes of carrollite CuCo2S4 (JCPDS No. 42–1450) [37,38], demonstrating the successful transformation from CuCo-OH precursor to CuCo2S4. Fig. 2b presents the thiospinel structure of CuCo2S4, in which Cu2+ ions occupy the tetrahedral sites and Co3+ ions occupy the octahedral sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and experiment by Sun and Deka’s groups have demonstrated that CuCo2S4 with this lattice structure and composition possesses more favorable electrochemical performances than congeners, such as CuCo2O4 and Co3S4 [32,37]. Hence, CuCo2S4/CC will be very promising in EOR and HER catalysis. The microstructures and morphologies of the as-constructed catalysts were observed through the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as exhibited in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2. Fig. S2a and b show the SEM images of the bare CC and CuCo–OH/CC samples. It can be observed that the needle-like CuCo–OH precursor fully covers the carbon fibers. It is worth noting that after further sulphuration treatment, the CuCo–OH precursor was converted to CuCo2S4 and the needle-like structure was still well maintained (Fig. 3a–c). The needle-like CuCo2S4 was homogeneously and robustly decorated on the carbon fibers. Such unique architecture can provide sufficient electrical connection and maximize the exposure of the surface active sites, which may enhance the catalytic activities of the electrocatalysts. Fig. 3d-f display the SEM images of the Co3S4/CC. The morphology of the Co3S4 is like the sea urchin. Unfortunately, the sea urchin-like Co3S4 did not adequately cover the surface of the carbon fibers. As for CuS/CC (Fig. 3g-i), the regular tubular CuS stacks were disorganized and did not fully cover on the carbon fibers. To know fully the microstructure of CuCo2S4/CC, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used, as presented in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4a and b, it can be clearly seen that the inside of the needle-like CuCo2S4 is hollow. The average thickness of the wall is approximately 22 nm. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern exhibits a set of well-defined concentric rings with some scattered dots (Fig. 4c), indicating the polycrystallinity of the hollow needle-like CuCo2S4. These concentric rings can be well indexed to the (0 2 2), (1 1 3) and (0 4 4) crystal facets of the carrollite CuCo2S4, which matches well with the related XRD data. Fig. 4d exhibits the TEM image of CuCo2S4/CC, and Fig. 4e and f show the enlarged views of the two regions selected in Fig. 4d. The obvious lattice fringes with interplanar space of 0.549 and 0.286 nm are in accordance with the (1 1 1) and (1 1 3) crystal planes of the carrollite CuCo2S4. Previous studies have proved that the (1 1 1) octahedral plane in spinel nanostructure is more reactive than other crystal facets [32]. Hence, the hollow needle-like CuCo2S4 electrocatalyst with exposed (1 1 1) crystal facets is highly promising in both EOR and HER catalysis. Fig. 4g shows the STEM and corresponding Cu, Co and S elemental mapping images of the hollow needle-like CuCo2S4. It can be observed that Cu, Co and S are homogeneously distributed throughout the whole nanoneedle."
8,Electrocatalytic properties for EOR,"3.2 Electrocatalytic properties for EOR The electrocatalytic performance of each catalyst in EOR was initially investigated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a conventional three-electrode setup in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 1.0 M ethanol. The LSV polarization curves collected in Fig. 5 a are used for the comparison of the catalytic activities of the different catalysts in EOR. As expected, CuCo2S4/CC displays a more negative potential of ~ 1.38 V vs. RHE (@ 10 mA cm−2) compared to CuCo-OH/CC (1.42 V), Co3S4/CC (1.41 V) and CuS/CC (1.50 V). Such low potential is also compared to novel Cu, Co-based EOR and OER catalysts reported previously (Table S1). The kinetics of each electrocatalyst in EOR was studied via the correlated Tafel plot (Fig. 5b). The Tafel slope of CuCo2S4/CC is 69 mV dec-1, much lower than that of CuCo-OH/CC (77 mV dec-1), Co3S4/CC (112 mV dec-1) and CuS/CC (115 mV dec-1). The most negative potential and smallest Tafel slope of CuCo2S4/CC (Fig. 5c) has the highest catalytic activities and fastest kinetics in EOR. This extraordinary performance could be due to the intergrading advantages of the structure and composition (synergistic effect between the Cu and Co) of the catalyst. Its unique hollow needle-like architecture has large specific surface area, which can supply sufficient active reaction sites. Note that, the exposed (1 1 1) crystal facets may produce a positive effect on EOR. The performance of each catalyst in OER was also investigated as shown in Figure S3. Consistent with the trend of EOR, CuCo2S4/CC shows a more negative potential and smaller Tafel slope for OER than those of CuCo-OH/CC, CuS/CC and Co3S4/CC at the same current density. The aim of this work is to construct an efficient electrocatalyst for the energy-saving generation of H2 by substituting OER with EOR. As expected, CuCo2S4/CC only needs 1.485 V to realize 100 mA cm−2 for EOR, 0.17 V less than that needed for the catalysis of OER (Fig. 5a and Figure S3a). This indicates that CuCo2S4/CC has more propitious kinetics and thermodynamics for EOR than OER. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was adopted to further assess the kinetics of each catalyst for EOR, as displayed in Figure S4. Among all measured samples, CuCo2S4/CC has the smallest charge transfer resistance (R ct) value of 0.61 Ω, which may be responsible for its enhanced performance in EOR. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is another criterion used for assessing catalytic activities of the electrocatalyst in EOR, while the double-layer capacitances (C dl) value directly reflects the ECSA [39–41]. Here, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out at scan rate of 20 ~ 100 mV s−1 in a narrow non-Faraday reaction part to calculate C dl (Figure S5). The calculated C dl of CuCo2S4/CC is 25.1 mF cm−2 (Fig. 5d), comparatively higher than its counterparts. This shows it possesses more revelational active sites, which contributes remarkably to the boosted EOR activity. It is also important for a catalyst to have long-term durability. The stability of CuCo2S4/CC in EOR was examined through a chronopotentiometry (CP) recording at j = 20 mA cm−2, as presented in Fig. 5e. There was no distinct degradation after 30 h continuous EOR operation, demonstrating it possesses ultra-long durability. SEM images (Figure S6) showed no obviously change in its microstructure after the long-time CP test, further confirming its impressive stability."
9,Electrocatalytic properties for HER,"3.3 Electrocatalytic properties for HER The reactivity of CuCo2S4/CC for HER was also explored in 1.0 M KOH with and without 1.0 M ethanol to assess whether EOR can be integrated with HER in a membrane-free electrolyser. The LSV comparison curves given in Figure S7 show only a loss of about 0.007 V at 50 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M ethanol electrolyte. This shows that ethanol has an inconsiderable influence on the performance of CuCo2S4/CC in HER. Furthermore, compared with the other catalysts, CuCo2S4/CC displays palpably enhanced catalytic activity in HER, as exhibited in Fig. 6 a. To drive the benchmark current density of −10 mA cm−2, CuCo2S4/CC only requires a potential of −0.166 V vs. RHE, comparatively smaller than those of CuCo–OH/CC (−0.330 V), CuS/CC (−0.427 V), Co3S4/CC (−0.222 V) and other erstwhile reported Cu, Co-based HER electrocatalysts (Table S2). The kinetics mechanism of the as-constructed electrocatalysts for HER was evaluated via the correlative Tafel plots. Actually, the mechanism of the HER in alkaline conditions could be reckoned as a combination of the following steps [42–44]: (i) Volmer: H2O + e–→ Hads + OH– (120 mV dec–1), stands for the electroreduction of water molecules. (ii) Heyrovsky: Hads + H2O + e– → H2 + OH– (40 mV dec–1), represents the electrochemical hydrogen desorption. (iii) Tafel: 2Hads → H2 (30 mV dec–1) corresponds to the chemical desorption. Hads in the formula signifies a H atom absorbed on an active site of the catalyst. Fig. 6b shows the Tafel plots of the as-constructed catalysts, the Tafel slope of CuCo2S4/CC is 101 mV dec–1, revealing that Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism predominated for HER [45]. The lowest potential and smallest Tafel slope presented in Fig. 6c demonstrate that CuCo2S4/CC possesses more desirable catalytic activity and kinetics. Fig. S8 shows the Nyquist plots of each electrocatalyst for HER. Amongst them, CuCo2S4/CC exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance R ct (3.5 Ω), further confirming that it possesses fastest charge-transfer kinetics. Also, C dl was investigated through the CV measurement to estimate the ECSAs of each catalyst for HER, as exhibited in Fig. 6d and Fig. S9. The C dl value of CuCo2S4/CC is 38.9 mF cm−2, higher than those of CuCo-OH/CC (9.7 mF cm−2), CuS/CC (7.9 mF cm−2) and Co3S4/CC (34.1 mF cm−2). This suggests that hollow needle-like structure possesses more active sites, which is more favorable for HER. We also evaluated the stability via the CP operation at a constant current density of −10 mA cm−2. After continuous electrolysis for 30 h, only a slight decrease can be observed, implying the impressive durability of CuCo2S4/CC in HER. Furthermore, the SEM images (Fig. S10) exhibited no significantly change in its morphology after long durability test."
10,Integrating HER and EOR to fabricate an energy-saving electrolyser,"3.4 Integrating HER and EOR to fabricate an energy-saving electrolyser Encouraged by the splendid electrocatalytic activities and durability of CuCo2S4/CC in both EOR and HER, and from the energy-saving design concept, a symmetric two-electrode electrolyser was fabricated using CuCo2S4/CC as a bifunctional catalyst in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 1.0 M ethanol (Fig. 7 a). The comparison LSV curves provided in Fig. 7b show that combining EOR with HER consumes less energy than that of sole water splitting. To deliver j = 10 mA cm –2, the ethanol–water electrolyser only needs a voltage of 1.59 V, much lower than that of electrolyser without ethanol (1.74 V) and also surpassing those applied in commercial water splitting devices (1.8 ~ 2.0 V) [5]. For comparison, the symmetric two-electrode electrolysers based on CuCo-OH/CC//CuCo-OH/CC, CuCo2S4/CC//CuCo2S4/CC, Co3S4/CC//Co3S4/CC and CuS/CC//CuS/CC were also assembled for ethanol–water and sole water electrolysis, as shown in Fig. 7c and Fig. S11. Whether in ethanol–water or sole water electrolysis system, CuCo2S4/CC//CuCo2S4/CC exhibits the largest current density at the same voltage. This enhanced performance of the CuCo2S4/CC//CuCo2S4/CC could be derived from its composition (the synergistic effect between Cu and Co) and unique structure. The hollow needle-like CuCo2S4 was uniformly and robustly grown on CC, which supplies a sufficient conductive connection. More importantly, such unique needle-like array architecture possesses a relatively larger specific surface area, which not merely facilitates the electrolyte immersion and mass transfer process, but also expedites the rapid escape of H2 bubbles. Furthermore, the durability of CuCo2S4/CC//CuCo2S4/CC was assessed through a CP measurement in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with 1.0 M ethanol, as displayed in Fig. 7e. There was no significantly decay after 30 h continuous electrolysis, demonstrating its unexceptionable stability. Interestingly, during CP test, vigorous bubbles are observed at cathode, while no bubble can be observed at anode, indicating the gas product is H2 with high-purity. In addition, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was carried out to identify the electrolysis product. Fig. 7d shows the 1H NMR spectrums of the electrolyte before and after CP test. Besides two specific peaks at 0.96 and 3.43 ppm that corresponded to the protons in ethanol, a new peak at 1.70 ppm emerged, which can be indexed to the protons of the methyl group in acetate [12,46]. At the same time, 13C NMR spectrums were also collected, as presented in Fig. S12. Two extra peaks at 23.5 and 181.0 ppm were detected after CP test compared to that of the electrolyte before electrolysis, which can be ascribed to the characteristic peaks of acetate [12,46], implying that ethanol was converted to value-added acetic acid. These results suggest that CuCo2S4/CC possesses unexceptionable catalytic activity, durability and selectivity for simultaneous energy-saving H2 production and ethanol upgrading from ethanol-water system."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, an energy-efficiency and cost-competitive electrolyser for H2 production has been reported and assembled for HER and simultaneous EOR in a membrane-free cell utilizing CuCo2S4/CC as bifunctional electrocatalysts. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of Cu and Co as well as the unique hollow needle-like structure, the CuCo2S4/CC displays superior catalytic performance in both HER and EOR. On the other hand, owing to the more preferable thermodynamics and kinetics for EOR than OER catalyzed by CuCo2S4/CC, the symmetrical two-electrode ethanol–water electrolyser only demands 1.59 V to reach 10 mA cm−2, about 150 mV less than that of ordinary water splitting. Particularly, CuCo2S4/CC illustrates the excellent selectivity for EOR, which can convert ethanol into value-added acid at the anode. In brief, this integrating strategy of H2 production and simultaneous ethanol upgrading by using bifunctional CuCo2S4/CC may open new ways to design other electrocatalysts for efficient biomass oxidation reaction and relevant energy-saving H2 production applications."
