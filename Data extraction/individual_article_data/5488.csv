0,Introduction,"Epichlorohydrin (ECH) is a key industrial chemical used in the production of epoxy resin and glycerin and comprises organochlorine moieties in its formula [1]. In the manufacturing process of epoxy resin, initially, the bisphenol–A, an isopropanol (IPA) used as a solvent in excess of epichlorohydrin, in comparison to bisphenol (1:4), is charged as a precursor. [2] During the conversion of bisphenol-A to the epoxy resin polymer, water and a series of ECH impurities are formed along with the final epoxy resin product. Generally, during the recovery of ECH and IPA from the final product, ECH-rich impurities can be readily removed by the distillation process; however, the ECH, IPA, and water form an azeotropic mixture of composition 50/30/20 ECH/IPA/water (w/w,%) with a high reflux ratio. ECH and IPA can be re-used in the reaction but they should be moisture-free. Therefore, azeotropic distillation has been generally carried out; however, it leads to higher energy consumption and higher manufacturing cost for the product. Additionally, because ECH is a carcinogenic compound and because of the environmental hazards thereof, it cannot be treated as an effluent [3–5]. Thus, a novel hybrid approach is necessary to remove the moisture through the hydrophilic membrane via pervaporation and develop a moisture-free ECH/IPA mixture that can be easily separated using distillation to increase product competitiveness by reducing the energy requirement. Fig. 1 shows the estimated energy consumption comparison between the traditional distillation and hybrid processes of pervaporation and distillation for separation of the ECH/IPA/water mixture at their azeotropic point (50/30/20 w/w,%) based on theoretical simulation study done by Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that, in the hybrid process, by replacing one column with pervaporation, the energy consumption is reduced by 23% compared with that for the conventional distillation process. Nevertheless, it is well-known that ECH is a highly reactive compound [6]; hence, choosing a membrane material for pervaporation separation of ECH containing feed is challenging. Given these, the membrane material must have superior ECH resistance along with good mechanical properties. Because of its excellent film-forming properties, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been regarded as a very promising hydrophilic membrane material for membrane-based separation applications. The PVA based membranes have excellent hydrophilicity due to number of hydroxyl moieties, robust nature, remarkable chemical resistance along with good thermal stability (Glass transition temperature above the room temperature) [7–9]. Considering that the PVA molecule has an abundance of hydroxyl moieties in its backbone, a membrane made from PVA only undergoes excessive swelling in a water-containing feed system [10,11]. However, the presence of hydroxyl groups can be easily modified using chemical crosslinking agents, such as glutaraldehyde, malic acid, and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), which have been frequently utilized for PVA modification. Moreover, it has been frequently reported that crosslinking adversely affects membrane performance by reducing its permeation rate. In our previous study, ECH was found to be very stable in relation to the PVA-TEOS membrane system [12,13]. In the presence of an acid catalyst, the hydrolysis and condensation of PVA and TEOS occur at a mild temperature conditions [13,14]. Moreover, The PVA-TEOS provides a very stable hybrid membrane consisting of an organic–inorganic network. Therefore, even though ECH is susceptible to the nucleophile (OH) present in the PVA membrane system, the existence of an organic–inorganic network and dense membrane, resulting from the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the PVA chains, deter ECH reaction with the membrane. According to the solution diffusion model and the law of diffusion, pervaporation transport rate across the membrane is inversely proportional to the membrane thickness [15]; however, the selectivity of the membrane insignificantly varies with membrane thickness [17]. Therefore, it will be more favorable to fabricate a thinner membrane to obtain higher performance, but this could lead to poor mechanical strength of the membrane. In order to attain higher mechanical strength for the thin membrane, composite membranes comprising thin active membrane layers on the surface of nonporous substrates, such as polysulfone (PSU), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polyacrylonitirle (PAN), or inorganic materials, e.g., alumina and ceramic materials, have been used [17–20]. The composite membrane resulting from this method is industrially beneficial, considering that making a membrane module comprising several alumina hollow fibers (AHFs) can provide large surface area for membrane separation and requires only a small installation area, which affords superior pervaporation outputs. PVDF, PAN, and PSU substrates are hydrophobic in nature; therefore, to attain efficient adhesion between the thin hydrophilic active membrane layers and their surfaces, the PSU or PVDF support surfaces generally have to be modified with hydrophilic functionality or surfactants have to be added to the active membrane layer. On the other hand, alumina is inherently hydrophilic in nature and has higher chemical and mechanical resistances compared with PVDF. Therefore, a thin coating of the active layer of PVA on the AHF is easier to achieve than on PVDF, PSU, or PAN polymeric porous substrates. Additionally, alumina substrate is a ceramic material that possesses excellent chemical, mechanical, and thermal stabilities against various organic substances [21]. Therefore, we chose the porous AHF as a support since it was determined to be very stable in ECH-containing feed mixtures compared to the PVDF, PAN, or PSU supports. As explained above, the slight decrease in the separation factor and increase in permeation flux in the PVA-based membrane with reduced membrane thickness is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, from observations of the industrial application of pervaporation, it will be more practical and efficient to prepare a membrane with higher pervaporation flux and separation factor. Graphene oxide (GO) is a derivative of graphite, which is produced through the oxidation of graphite via Hummers’ method [22,23]. GO consists of several oxygen-containing functional moieties, such as hydroxyl, carboxylic acid at the edge, and the epoxide groups in their basal planes, which possesses highly hydrophilic profiles [24]. GO with these functionalities can be easily dispersed into the PVA chain by forming a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group in the PVA. Cheng et al. prepared GO/PVA/Polyacrylonitirle composite membrane using solution casting method. In their study, 2.0 wt% of GO addition membrane showed highest separation factor 3095 which was 16 times higher than PVA membrane with flux 0.145 kg/m2h for ethanol (90 wt%) dehydration was reported [18]. Khazaei et al. prepared PVA/GO free standing membrane aimed to separate isooctane (aliphatic) and toluene (aromatic) mixtures, 0.5 wt% GO addition in PVA has increased the affinity of the membrane to toluene by S and pi bonds and increased in selectivity by 4 times was reported [25]. For the recovery of acetic acid from vinegar wastewater in pervaporation unit, Dave et al. have developed a PVA-GO composite membrane [26]. The high pervaporation output in comparison to pristine PVA membrane with flux, 0.22 kg/m2h at 2.5% acetic acid in feed and maximum separation factor 62.2 at 20% acetic acid concentration in feed was reported. Qian et al. fabricated a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) using chitosan and GO incorporation for desalination by pervaporation. Their flux enhanced for 1.0 wt% GO content membrane (30.0 kg/m2h) in desalinating 5 wt% aqueous sodium chloride at 81 °C and 99.99% salt rejection was observed [27]. Furthermore, Munoz et al. have also developed MMM using PVA and GO for pervaporation dehydration of ethanol at 90% feed concentration. The highest performance with 75% increment in original flux compare to pristine PVA with 1.0 wt% GO in PVA membrane giving 0.137 kg/m2h with 263 separation factor was obtained [28]. It has been reported in existing literature that the mixed matrix membrane produced by embedding GO in the polymer matrix has shown remarkable improvement in the pervaporation performances at lower content of GO in the in membranes. These reports have prompted us to fabricate GO embedded membrane to further explored the potential GO in dehydration ECH/IPA/water ternary mixture feed. Therefore, in this study, we prepared PVA-TEOS membranes and aimed to increase their efficiencies using different amounts of GO incorporated in the PVA-TEOS solution and successfully coated on the outer surfaces of the non-porous AHF supports. All the membranes used for the pervaporation dehydration of the ECH/IPA/water ternary feed mixtures were utilized at the azeotropic composition range. Based on our review of related literature, there were no reports available for PVA-TEOS-GO coated on porous alumina substrates for the dehydration of ECH-containing feed mixture. Hence, we believe that the present study is a novel contribution towards achieving dehydration of ECH-containing feed mixtures."

3,Preparation of the GO and PVA-TEOS-GO alumina hollow fiber membrane,"2.2 Preparation of the GO and PVA-TEOS-GO alumina hollow fiber membrane Initially, graphite powder was oxidized using the modified Hummers’ method [23] to produce the GO powder. Briefly, 10 g of graphite powder and 5 g of sodium nitrate were added to the concentrated 230 mL sulfuric acid (98%) in an ice bath. Thereafter, potassium permanganate (30 g) was added in different batches by maintaining the temperature below 20 °C and stirring the reaction mixture for 2 h. Afterwards, the reaction mixture temperature was raised to 35 °C and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, 460 mL of water was poured slowly by maintaining the temperature below 98 °C. Thereafter, the brown colored reaction mixture was maintained for 1 h to enhance the oxidation degree. Next, 40 mL of hydrogen peroxide was added, and the resultant bright yellow suspension was diluted by adding water. The reaction product was cleaned via centrifugation and washing. Finally, the concentrate was dispersed into the beaker, which contained water, and sonicated for 1.5 h. The GO dispersion was yellowish-brown in color. The dry form of the GO product was obtained via centrifugation of the GO dispersion at 10,000 rpm and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C. For the preparation of the membranes, PVA (5 wt%) solution was prepared by dissolving 5 g of PVA powder in 95 g of water at 80 °C with continuous stirring for about 5 h in beaker. The resultant clear solution was obtained. After having been cooled to room temperature, 1.2 g of hydrochloric acid was added to the solution and mixed for 30 min. Subsequently, 7.5 g of TEOS solution was added to it. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h to allow the reaction of the PVA and TEOS. After 24 h, the solution was sonicated and left as is to remove the air bubbles. One side of alumina hollow was sealed and dipped into the abovementioned PVA-TEOS (1:1.5) solution to apply the coating on the outer surface of the alumina hollow fiber. In order to obtain the defect free uniform surface coating, coating of the solution was performed four times. After having been dried at room temperature, the coated membrane was thoroughly rinsed with water to remove the hydrochloric acid and dried in the oven at 65 °C for 12 h to remove any traces of trapped water. For comparison of membrane thickness effect on pervaporation separation output, the thicker membrane (60 µm) was also prepared by increasing number of PVA-TEOS (1:1.5) coating layer. In preparing the PVA/TEOS-GO-coated on the alumina hollow fiber membranes, the GO-dispersed solution was prepared by taking 0.025 g (0.5 wt% w.r.t. PVA), 0.05 g (1.0 wt% w.r.t. PVA), and 0.075 g (1.5 wt% w.r.t. PVA) of GO in 20 ml of water, and sonicating the same for about 1 h at high intensity. Subsequently, it was added in a dropwise manner similar to the foregoing 100 g PVA-TEOS solution (1:1.5). and stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for the purpose of having the solution mixed well. Thereafter, it was sonicated intermittently. The resultant solutions were coated in manner similar to the foregoing on the outer side of the AHF surface. Based on concentration of GO in PVA-TEOS solution, the membranes were designated as a 0.5 wt% GO, 1.0 wt% GO and 1.5 wt% GO respectively. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of membrane preparation process. The PVA, PVA-TEOS, and PVA-TEOS-GO films were also prepared for the characterization of their active layers. The coating solutions prepared above for each of the foregoing were cast into the petri dish, allowed to dry in an oven at 35 °C for 24 h and, subsequently, the films were removed from the petri dish and used for the FTIR and XPS analysis."
4,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 Field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy The surface morphology of the porous alumina hollow fiber, GO, and cross-sectional morphologies of all the hollow fiber membranes were examined via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis. The elemental composition of the porous alumina hollow fiber was confirmed using the tool for the FE-SEM analysis equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) system. The focus of the beam of electrons produced images of all the sample in the FE-SEM analysis (Teskan, Czech, Vega II, and LSU). In order to realize conductive surfaces for all the samples, gold coatings were applied on the samples. 2.2.2 Fourier infrared spectroscopy (attenuated total reflection mode) The GO powder and PVA, PVA-TEOS, and PVA-TEOS films were analyzed via the attenuated total reflection mode of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (ATR mode of FTIR, Nicolet iS10, USA). The samples were scanned in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1 by aggregating 32 scans at a resolution of two wavenumber spectra. 2.2.3 X-ray diffraction study The X-ray diffractogram patterns of the GO and graphite were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Japan, D/Max 2500, λ = 1.5406, Cu Kα radiation at 45 kV and 15 mA). Exfoliation of GO powder was examined within the range of 2 θ = 5–60° at a rate of 5°/min. 2.2.4 Elemental analysis (EA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Elemental analysis (EA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted to observe the elemental composition of the GO sheet. XPS (Thermo VG Scientific (UK) Multilab 2000, Kratos- HP) was likewise used to analyze the degree of oxidation and carbon/oxygen ratio in the GO powder. In this study, 200 W Al K∝ monochromatic X- ray source was used to provide X-ray spots on the GO powder for analysis. The surface of PVA-TEOS membrane was also analyzed by XPS instrument. The conditions were, 250 W Al K∝ monochromatic X- ray source, 3 × 10−10 mbar pressure in analysis chamber, area of X-ray spot at the membrane surface 500 µm. 2.2.5 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermal stabilities of the GO and graphite powder were examined via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Perkin Elmer, USA, TGA 7). The specimens were heated from 25 to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to observe the thermal degradation patterns of the GO and graphite. 2.2.6 Pervaporation experimental setup The pervaporation experimental set up as shown in Fig. 3 , that was assembled for our previous study [29] was used for the PV dehydration experiments of the ECH/IPA/water feed mixtures. Hollow fiber membranes with an external diameter of 0.2895 cm micrometers and length of 5.1 cm were fitted into the stainless-steel membrane module. The feed mixtures were continuously circulated on the outer side of the membrane at a speed of 70 g/min−1 using a circulation pump (Cole Palmer, USA) by connecting the upstream side of the module to the feed tank. Both ends of the membrane were tightly screwed by inserting an O-ring between the downstream side (permeate side) and the membrane tube to avoid the leaking of the feed mixtures. Pressure (less than 2 Torr) was applied on the inner side of the membranes using a vacuum pump (Edwards, RV8). Fig. 2 shows an image of the membrane module. Based on the design, the effective area of the membrane module of each tested hollow membrane was 0.0046398 m2. Depending on the experimental condition, the feed solution was maintained within a desired temperature range (30–40 °C) using the feed solution tank covered with an outside water circulation jacket to permeate the solution obtained from the downstream side, which was condensed in the liquefied nitrogen trap. The permeation rate (flux) for each test was calculated by weighing the permeate solution obtained in the trap. The electronic balance (Sartorius BA210S) was used to measure the weights of the trap. The experimental run time for every pervaporation experiment for each membrane sample was 5 h. Moreover, the feed consisting of ECH/IPA/water (50/40/10, w/w,%) was prolonged up to 10 h, whereas the obtained permeate solution from the PV test was very low. The pervaporation separation of the ECH/IPA/water ternary feed mixtures was conducted in the range of their azeotropic compositions (50:40:10 (wt.%) to 50:30:20 (wt.%), respectively). A gas chromatograph (DS Sci. DS7200) equipped with a flame ionization detector was used to determine the exact composition of ECH, IPA, and water in the permeates. The evaluation of membrane performance was done by calculating the flux, separation factor, and flux of individual components using Eqs. (1)–(3). Arrhenius equation was used to evaluate the temperature dependence of flux by using Eq. (4). Three successive pervaporation tests were performed for each of the membranes and an average value having less than relative standard deviation less than 5% was reported. (1) Flux ( J ) = M A × t where J is the permeation flux (kg m−2 h−1) and M pertains to the mass of the permeated solution collected in the cold trap (kg) with respect to the effective area A (m2) over time t (h). In this study, water was a target component for removal from the ECH/IPA/water feed (i.e., the dehydration of organics). Therefore, the separation factor (α) that was calculated corresponds to the water. (2) Separation Factor ( α ) = P Water / P ( IPA + ECH ) F Water / F ( IPA + ECH ) where the symbols P water, P (IPA+ECH), F water, and F (IPA+ECH) are abbreviations for the weight fractions of water, ECH + IPA organic solution in feed solutions, and permeate solution, respectively. (3) Flux of Individual component ( ji ) = ( J ) × Pi 100 where j i is the flux of component i (kg m−2 h−1) and J (kg m−2 h−1) is total flux, P i pertains to the weight fraction of component i (ECH, IPA or water) in the permeate solution (wt.%). (4) Flux ( J i ) = A p . e − Ep / RT where Ji (kg m−2 h−1) is the flux of component i, which corresponds to ECH, IPA, or water; T (K) denotes absolute temperature in kelvin; R (J mol−1 K−1) represents the universal gas constant; and A p (kg m−2 h−1) and E p (kJ mol−1) pertain to the pre-exponential factor and the apparent activation energy for permeation, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Characterization of AHF, GO, and PVA-TEOS-GO-coated AHF membrane","3.1 Characterization of AHF, GO, and PVA-TEOS-GO-coated AHF membrane The AHF support was prepared via phase inversion and sintering methods. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the AHF is shown in Fig. 4 . From the cross-sectional image (Fig. 4a) of the AHF fiber, it can be seen that round alumina grains are arranged quite loosely, thereby indicating that sponge-like structures reflect the porosity of the hollow fiber. [30] The outer diameter of AHF was 0.2894 cm while its inner diameter was 0.2224 cm. The pores were preferentially spherical in shape, having a size of approximately 500 nm, was observed on the surface of the AHF, as shown in Fig. 4b. Additionally, at a higher magnification, FE-SEM energy dispersive spectroscopy (FE-EDS) analysis was conducted to determine the elemental composition of the AHF (Fig. 4c). The presence of a strong signal due to the back scattered electron from the Al and O elements in the EDS spectra confirmed the successful coordination of the Al2O3 particle. FE-SEM analysis was performed to measure the thickness of the active coating layer on the AHF surface. Fig. 5 shows the cross-sectional FE-SEM micrographs of the PVA/TEOS (60 µm and 10 µm) and 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt%, and 1.5 wt% GO-incorporated PVA/TEOS-coated AHF membranes. Based on the SEM analysis, it was confirmed that dense, uniform, and defect-free active separation layers were formed on the outer side of the AHF. The thickness of the active layers was within the range of 10 to 15 micrometers. Additionally, it was observed that the polymer layer and support (AHF) were well-integrated with each other, thereby suggesting good adhesion between the AHF and PVA-TEOS or PVA-TEOS-GO active layer. The foregoing might have possibly happened because of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the hydroxyl group present on the AHF and that present on the PVA-TEOs active layer. Based on the FE-SEM images in Fig. 6 a, with regard to the GO nanopowder, exfoliated GO thin sheets with wavy wrinkled can be observed, thereby suggesting that the GO has well oxidized. [24] Fig. 6b shows the FTIR spectra of the GO powder. The peaks ranging from 3000 to 3300 cm−1 correspond to the OH stretching vibration in GO. The peak at 1711 cm−1 was attributed to the C=O stretching vibration in the carboxylic groups. The in-plane stretching vibration at 1622 cm−1 corresponded to the sp2 hybridized C=C. The stretching vibrational band at 1260 cm−1 corresponded to the COH groups. The stretching vibrational band at 1061 cm−1 was assigned to the epoxy groups in the GO [24,31,32]. Therefore, the successful oxidation of graphite was confirmed. PVA and TEOS crosslinking has been confirmed by the FTIR analysis. Based on the FTIR spectra, as shown in Fig. 7 , increased intensity in the FTIR vibrational frequency at 1000 to 1100 cm−1 corresponded to the Si-O of the PVA/TEOS membrane, thereby confirming the formation of the CO-Si bond, while the decrease in the FTIR vibrational frequency of 3300 corresponded to OH stretching vibration [13,14]. Thus, it was confirmed that the crosslinking reaction of PVA and TEOS took place. Additionally, in the PVA/TEOS/GO membrane, albeit not obvious, small peaks at 1710 cm−1 and 1594 cm−1 corresponded to the C=O and skeletal vibration, respectively, in the GO. Given that the GO content was considerably less, other peaks might have merged with that of the functional group in the GO PVA/TEOS polymer matrix. To ensure the formation COSi bond in PVA-TEOS membrane complementary XPS and Fe-SEM analyses were performed. The Fig. 8 shows high resolution Si 2P spectra of PVA-TEOS membrane. There are two peaks at binding energy 101.98 ev and 103.71 ev indicated the formation of COSi [33] and SiOSi [34] bond respectively. Additionally, from the FE-SEM surface micrograph of PVA-TEOS membrane (inset of Fig 0.7), it is seen that, there was no formation of visible SiO2 particle observed. The FE-SEM and XPS study have well supported the explanation given in the FTIR study. GO and graphite were subjected to TGA for their thermal stability evaluation. Fig. 9 a shows the TGA curves consisting of the plot of weight loss (%) against the temperature of the graphite powder and GO, respectively. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 9a that GO undergoes decomposition in three weight drops, i.e., 1st at 100 °C due to the loss of adsorbed water, and the 2nd and 3rd major weight drops from 215 to 550 °C owing to the elimination of CO and CO2 from the GO, followed by the combustion of the carbon skeleton of GO at high temperature [24,35]. On the other hand, the pristine graphite showed only one degradation weight loss at high temperature, corresponding to the combustion of the carbon skeleton. TGA analysis support the explanation rendered in the FTIR study. In order to measure the oxidation degree of GO, EA was performed via the combustion of GO. Table 1 demonstrates the elemental compositions of GO and graphite. C/O ratio in the GO sample was 1.69, while that in the pristine graphite sample was unlimited due to the negligible oxygen content in the graphite. According to the Scholz and Boehm theory, C/O ratio measurement in GO is an appropriate method for the determination of oxidation degree. Generally, the C/O falls in the range of 0.89–3.81 in GO [36]. XPS analysis of GO was performed using an X-ray focused on the GO sample to measure the kinetic energy of the photo-emitted electrons, which give the exact elemental composition on the surface, as shown in Fig. 9b. It can be seen from the XPS spectra given in Fig. 9b that the GO sample exhibited two characteristic peak signals at binding energy levels of 284 and 531 eV that were assigned to the C 1s and O 1s (OH), respectively [32]. Additionally, it was observed that the C1s peaks were deconvoluted (Fig. 9c) and the peaks at the binding energies of 285.7, 286.6, and 288.5 eV, which corresponded to the C=C, CO, and COO groups, respectively, in the GO, revealed the successful oxidation of GO [24,32,37]. Fig. 9d presents the XRD patterns of graphite and the GO powder. The pristine graphite demonstrated a strong x-ray diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.5° (002), corresponding to the interlayer d spacing (0.33 nm) evaluated using the Braggs equation. While in the XRD pattern of GO, the same peak disappeared and a new broad peak at 2θ = 10.5° (001) manifested with a d spacing of 0.83 nm. The increment of d spacing ascribed to the oxygen-containing function moieties were attached to the basal planes of GO [24,32,37]."
7,Pervaporation output,"3.2 Pervaporation output 3.2.1 Effect of GO content flux and separation factor The pervaporation dehydration of the feed mixture containing 50/30/20 ECH/IPA/Water (w/w) at 30 °C was carried out using the all the membranes, as shown in Fig. 10 . It can be seen from Fig. 10 that, the flux value for the PVA-TEOS-coated AHF membrane experienced a twofold increase (10 µm, 0.17 kg/m2h), as compared with thicker membrane (60 µm, 0.078 kg/m2h); however, separation factor declined from 3785 to 706 with the decrease in the membrane thickness. As explained in Introduction section, according to the solution diffusion model, a thicker membrane provides a higher diffusion barrier for the transportation of components (water, ECH, or IPA) across the membrane, therefore, flux of membrane decreased [15,16]. The decrease in the separation factor, which was attributed to the defects induced in thin membrane by the sorption of water, ECH or IPA. This is due to the reduce the value of polymer critical strain with decreased in thickness and, additionally, with regard to the pervaporation, transportation took place throughout the concentration gradient process which also decreased the stresses between the polymer chain [38]. Therefore, GO was introduced into the PVA-TEOS polymer matrix to compensate the downfall of separation factor for PV dehydration of the ECH/IPA/water feed mixtures. Fig. 10 also shows that, the decrease in the separation factor was well-compensated by the addition of GO in the membrane. Since, with the addition of GO in the membrane (0.5 wt% to 1.5 wt%) flux decreased from the 0.17 to 0.09 (kg/m2h) and while separation factor increased sharply from 1450 to 4844 was obtained. GO consists of several hydrophilic moieties (OH, COOH, etc.) and it promotes a good dispersion of the same into the PVA-TEOS polymer matrix owing to the hydrogen bonding interaction of these groups with the hydroxyl groups in the PVA, thereby resulting in the aligned brick and mortar type of structure in the PVA-TEOS-GO membrane network [31,32]. Additionally, these hydrophilic groups (OH, COOH, etc.) increases the water affinity at the membrane surface with polar-polar interaction or hydrogen bonding interaction with water molecule. It has been reported that, based on fixed carrier theory, the transportation of water molecules in pervaporation hydrophilic membranes taken place from one hydrophilic site to other [39]. However, the formation aligned brick and mortar type of structure is more profound when GO content. Additionally, the more GO content in polymer matrix, the higher the interlayers of GO and the more tortuous type of water channel. Therefore, it is also responsible for the increase in the packing density and also reduced polymer chain mobility of the membrane by forming a denser network [27]. Therefore, permeation flux was decreased with increase of GO content in the membranes. But, at the high content of GO the diffusion of water molecule is comparatively easier due to hydrophilic moieties in membrane to larger size molecules of ECH and IPA molecules through dense membrane network. Therefore, the separation corresponding to the water of the hybrid PVA-TEOS-GO membranes was increased. There are some reports that have also studied the effect of GO content on the pervaporation separation of the organic water system and they have also reported on similar types of transportation phenomena through the GO-polymer hybrid membranes [18]. Among all the GO-PVA-TEOS hybrid membranes, 1.0 wt% GO-incorporated membrane showed remarkable pervaporation performance; therefore, studies on the effects of feed composition and temperature were carried out using the 1.0 wt% GO-incorporated membrane. 3.2.2 Effect of feed composition The effects of different feed compositions on the performances of the 0 wt% GO (PVA-TEOS (1:1.5 w/w) and 1.0 wt% GO membranes were examined by varying the water content in the ECH/IPA/water feed composition at 35 °C. Fig. 11 shows the effects of water content in the feed composition on the flux and separation efficiency of PVA-TEOS (1:1.5) and (1.0 wt.%) membranes at 35 °C. It was observed from Fig. 11 that as water content in the feed decreased, pervaporation flux likewise decreased with an increase in the water content in the permeate for both of the membranes. Fig. 11 also shows that the decrease in the water content in the permeate solution with an increase of water in the feed was not significant for the GO-PVA-TEOS hybrid membrane, as compared with that of the PVA-TEOS membrane, considering that, in the case of 1.0 wt% GO, the permeate water content was reduced from 100% to 99.44%, while in the case of the PVA-TEOS membrane it was reduced from 99.9% to 99.2%, with an increase of water in the feed solution from 10% (ECH/IPA/water, 50/40/10, w/w,%) to 20% (ECH/IPA/water, 50/30/20, w/w,%). As such, it means that the PVA-TEOS-GO hybrid membrane exhibited a noteworthy PV output. This can be further attributed to the presence of GO, which produces a more compact and denser hydrophilic network through which the passage of water is much easier than in the ECH and IPA. Nevertheless, with regard to both of the membranes, a reduction in separation efficiency with an increase of water in the feed was observed. The foregoing can be ascribed to the driving force raised by the addition of water in the feed which plasticizes the PVA polymer. This resulted in higher membrane swelling, thereby resulting in a membrane with a looser polymer network and one that allows the transfer of ECH and IPA or the water/ECH/IPA cluster along with water through the membrane. This is a common phenomenon that occurs in the pervaporation separation through polymer-based membranes [13,14,16,18]. Despite the foregoing, the GO-PVA-TEOS hybrid membrane produced remarkable separation with an infinite separation factor (100% of permeate water content) at the feed containing the ECH/IPA/water, 50/40/10, w/w,% solution. 3.2.3 Effect of temperature The effect of the operating temperature on the membranes (PVA-TEOS (1:1.5) and the 1.0 wt% (GO)) performance was analyzed by varying the feed temperature from 30 to 40 °C. Fig. 12 shows the effects of the feed temperature on the flux and separation factor with the membrane PVA-TEOS (1:1.5) and 1.0 wt% (GO) at feed composition 50/30/20 ECH/IPA/water (w/w,%). As shown in Fig. 12, it can be observed that as the feed temperature increased from the 30 to 40 °C, the flux increased from 0.17 to 0.22 kg/m2h and the separation factor decreased from 706 to 426. With the incorporation of GO in the membrane, flux increased from 0.13 to 0.33 kg/m2h and separation decreased from 4670 to 596. It was observed from the result that GO incorporation improved the PV output of the PVA/TEOS membrane. Elevation of feed temperature increases the vapor pressure of feed components on either side of the membrane, however, vapor pressure on the downstream side (permeate) remains steady, thereby creating higher vapor pressure difference across the membrane [13,14] Moreover, in polymer-based membranes, generally, as temperature of feed increases, the free volume of membrane, which comes from the thermal motion of polymer chain, increases [18]. Therefore, permeation flux increased but separation factor decreased for both PVA-TEOS (1:1.5) and (B) 1.0 wt% GO membranes. However, in the case of 1.0 wt% GO membrane, the flux increases almost linearly from the 30 to 40 °C while separation factor sharply decreased after temperature was increased from 30 to 35 °C and then only slight decrease is found for the further increase in the temperature. This might have been due to, 1.0 wt% GO containing several hydrophilic moieties (OH, COOH) along with epoxide functionality. At increase of temperature to 35 °C, increases the free volume and with these functionalities also increases the membrane swelling. Due to high adsorption of water, which promote loosening of membrane network. Also, at high temperature viscosity of liquid feed diminishes, which favor the permeation of components through the membrane [27]. Furthermore, ECH containing epoxide group may have interaction with epoxide functionality on the GO. This can be well justifying from flux result, as increment in flux for PVA-TEOS membrane is not so profound as compare to the that of 1.0 wt% GO membrane. Therefore, adsorption of ECH and IPA could have occurred at high temperature along with water and this turn in to the sharp decreased in the separation factor. In general, the increase in permeation flux with temperature can be expressed using the following Arrhenius equation (Eq. (4)) [31,40]. The individual fluxes of water, IPA, ECH, and water were calculated using Eq. (3) at the feed composition of ECH/IPA/water, (50/30/20, w/w%) with varying temperature ranging from 30 to 40 °C for both 0 wt% GO and (B) 1.0 wt% GO membranes. Fig. 13 shows the Arrhenius plots of the temperature vis-à-vis the logs of individual fluxes of IPA, ECH, and water for both of the membranes. From these plots, it can be observed that the flux of each component varies for both membranes according to temperature. The apparent energies of the activation for permeation were calculated for every component from the slope of the linear plot. They were found to be all positive and they indicated that the fluxes for all components increased with the temperature. [41] With regard to the 0 wt% GO membrane, apparent energies of activation permeation of water (44.4 kJ/mol), IPA (84.8 kJ/mol), and ECH (80.5 kJ/mol) were observed. With regard to the 1.0 wt% GO membrane, apparent energies of water (73.1 kJ/mol), IPA (96.04 kJ/mol), and ECH (216.2 kJ/mol) were observed. The lower value of Ep of water than that for IPA and ECH of both membranes suggest that the permeation of ECH and IPA through both the 0 wt% GO and (B) 1.0 wt% GO membranes was more sensitive than that of water. After increasing feed temperature, the increment of permeation fluxes of ECH and IPA were more than that of water, and subsequently, resulted in the decrease of the separation factor. 3.2.4 Long-term pervaporation operation stability study In order to examine the long-term stability of the GO-PVA-TEOS hybrid membranes, the feed mixture (ECH/IPA/water, 50/30/20, w/w%) was continuously circulated on outer side of the membranes (PVA-TEOS and 1.0 wt% GO) at 30 °C. At a certain point of time, the pervaporation test was conducted to evaluate the pervaporation flux and water in the permeate solution. Thus, the membrane operation stability test was prolonged to 10 days. Fig. 14 shows the long-term pervaporation output of the PVA-TEOS and 1.0 wt% GO membranes, which lasted up to 240 h. The flux value was stable until 24 h, thereafter, it increased sharply and thereafter slowly increased with time passed in both the membranes. The reason is that the membrane obtained equilibrium swelling at 24 h and relaxation of polymer chain was experienced. However, the water content in the permeated solution from PVA-TEOS membrane decreased linearly with time being passed, but on other hand that of in the permeated solution from 1.0 wt% GO membrane had a marginal effect in long-term stability test was observed. Therefore, it was observed that the presence of hydrophilic GO in the membrane plays an important role in long-term operation stability by giving higher separation efficiency."
8,Conclusion,"PVA/TEOS and 0.5–wt%1.5 wt% GO blended in the PVA/TEOS solution were coated on the porous AHF membrane. Characterization of the membrane was done via FTIR, FE-SEM, XPS analyses. The pervaporation tests were performed using all the membranes, with regard to the pervaporation output, the pervaporation flux decreased from 0.17 to 0.09 kg/m2h and separation increased from 706 to 4844 with an increase in GO content in the membrane with the feed containing 50/30/20, ECH/IPA/water (w/w,%) at 30 °C. In addition, an increase in the flux (0.078–0.17) and a decrease in the separation factor (3785 to 706) were observed with a decrease in thickness of the PVA/TEOS membrane from 60 to 10 µm. The effect of the operating condition on the membranes, with and without GO content, was determined. In that context, feed composition changed from the solution (ECH/IPA/water, 50/30/20 to 50/40/10, w/w,%) and feed temperature varied from 30 to 40 °C. The flux increased and the separation factor decreased with an increase in the water in the feed (ECH/IPA/water), which was observed for both PVA/TEOS (1:1.5) and 1.0 wt% GO membranes. With regard to the variance in the feed temperature from 30 to 40 °C, the flux increased and separation factor decreased for both membranes. As varying the operating parameter, however superior pervaporation performance was obtained by the GO-incorporated membrane, as compared with the PVA/TEOS membrane. In 240 h long stability test, flux value was stable until 24 h, thereafter, it increased sharply and thereafter slowly increased with time being passed in both the membranes. While, PVA-TEOS membrane exhibited continuous decrease water in permeate (wt%) solution compared to that of marginally in the 1.0 wt% GO membrane was observed. In conclusion, it was confirmed that the presence of GO in the PVA-TEOS membrane improves the separation efficiency in ECH/IPA/water pervaporation dehydration."
