0,Introduction,"Gaseous biofuels primarily biohydrogen (bio-H2) is becoming an important renewable energy source and its use as a transport fuel is believed to increase in the future years [1]. In order to meet the sustainability criteria, biological production of H2 through the use of low embodied carbon from renewable sources is considered a promising route [2,3]. Bio-H2 produced through acidogenic dark fermentation is generally composed of 40–50% H2 and 50–60% CO2 [4]. The CO2 generated limits the use of bio-H2 as a fuel and even more challenging is the storage of bio-H2 [5]. Many studies have been carried out to remove the CO2 (upgrading) from these gaseous mixture that include, sparging other gases such as N2, chemical and physical adsorption, membrane or vacuum separation, electrochemical processes integrated with amine scrubbing or vacuum swing adsorption etc. [6–10]. Although these processes aid in upgrading bio-H2, there exist a few limitations to these processes. Use of vacuum is energy intensive and sparging N2 gas makes the recovery of gases challenging [9]. Moreover, the CO2 captured is released back into the atmosphere accounting for global warming. Instead, since our need for reducing CO2 emissions have become keener than ever and also the fact that the present CO2 storage and capturing technologies are expensive, developing processes that can sequester this CO2 for the generation of value added products, chemicals and fuels are of immense practical interests [11]. One such process is the production of bio-based succinic acid (SA), where CO2 is sequestered by bacteria that are capable of producing SA as a major end product [12]. SA is a four-carbon platform chemical, which holds applications in pharmaceutical, food and plastic industries [13]. As opposed to the petrochemical-based SA production that contributes for climate change, bio-based SA production utilizes 1 mol of CO2 per mole of SA produced, reducing CO2 emissions [14]. Although it is estimated that 4.5–5 tons of CO2 emission savings occurs per ton of bio-based SA produced [15], it is still grappling for its place in the market due to various challenges. Some of the challenges include, utilization of pure CO2 and H2 gases that makes the process cost intensive, formation of by-products and expensive extraction/purification methods [16]. Therefore, in order to overcome these challenges, integrating SA production with bio-H2 production can be a sustainable option. Studies have been carried out to integrate SA production with acetone-ethanol-butanol fermentations and biogas generation [17–20]. Apart from these, bio-H2 and SA production can be considered as a perfect combination for integration, since SA production enhances in response to high availability of both CO2 and H2 gases. This approach of supplying gases that are rich in CO2 and H2 from bio-H2 reactor to the SA producing fermenter allows the effective utilization of CO2 by phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to form oxaloacetic acid (OAA), which enters the reductive C4 pathway that produces SA [21]. The bio-H2 acts as an electron donor and maintains redox conditions in the reactor, which also favor SA production [16]. In the acidogenic fermentation, upgrading bio-H2 through sequestration of CO2 for SA production is only one prong of the overarching sustainable treatment solution. The other prong is to concurrently make effective use of the streams of acidogenic fermentation containing volatile fatty acids (VFA) such as acetic, butyric and propionic acids along with the residual carbon [22,23]. Usually, these VFAs have to be removed/separated from the effluent prior to its disposal in order to meet the permissible discharge limits. However, these VFAs, which are short chain linear carboxylic acids (C2–C6) can either be extracted, since they hold direct applications [24] or can be used as precursors for value added biofuels, alcohols, aldehydes, biofertilizers and biopolymers synthesis in a closed loop approach [25]. Considering the latter as a more feasible option, studies have been carried out in using these VFAs for the production of other value added products, specifically biopolymers [26]. Biopolymers in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are aliphatic polyesters, synthesized by many organisms under stress conditions using VFAs as precursors [27]. Although PHA production using pure carbon sources and single cultures results in better yields, this approach hardly favors an economically competitive polymer production in comparison to the petroleum derived polymers [28]. Alternatively, employing mixed microbial consortia (MMC), which utilize these acid rich effluents for PHA production emerges as a viable strategy [29,30]. The typical production process of PHA using these MMC systems have been studied by including three process elements (a) acidogenic fermentation to produce VFAs (b) enrichment of PHA producing biomass and (c) PHA production using enriched biomass and easily degradable VFAs [31]. Since the CO2 regulations tighten and as the bio-H2 industry grows, the issue of CO2 generation along with H2 needs to be considered. Additionally, it is expected that biofuels productionshould be complemented by biobased chemicals production and their use [32]. In light of this, the purpose of the present study is to produce an integrated suite of bio-based products, stemming from central acidogenic fermentation. A bio-H2 upgrading strategy is depicted where the CO2 produced along with the bio-H2 is utilized for bio-based SA production, while the acid rich effluent is used for PHA production by MMC. Pretreated, anaerobic culture was used for bio-H2 production and the mixture of CO2 and bio-H2 gas obtained was sent to another reactor where C. amalonaticus was used for SA production. The total gas produced during AF, the CO2 fixation rate and SA yield were evaluated. The VFAs generated during AF were used for PHA production and the obtained biopolymer was thoroughly characterized. To the very best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to develop an integrated scheme for the production of bio-based SA, bio-H2 and PHA. The final aim of the study is to enhance carbon conversion both from liquid and gaseous wastes, improve the economics of the overall process, while simultaneously obtaining value added products."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biocatalysts,"2.1 Biocatalysts 2.1.1 Biohydrogen (bio-H2) producing mixed consortium and medium Anaerobic mixed consortium used in the study was obtained from final sedimentation tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Hyderabad, India. The consortium was sieved to eliminate stones, sand and other coarse material and the resulting sludge was used as seed inoculum. The seed inoculum was stored in anaerobic conditions for several days before being used. To selectively enrich bio-H2 producing bacteria, the seed sludge was pretreated by employing heat pretreatment (100 °C; 2 h) method, which suppresses non-spore forming bacteria like the methanogenic bacteria (MB), while the spore-forming bacteria such as the acidogenic bacteria (AB) survive these extreme conditions by forming protective spores. The pre-treated consortium was further used for bio-H2 production. Prior to inoculation in the fermentation medium, the parent culture was washed in phosphate saline buffer (5000 rpm, 20 °C). Designed synthetic wastewater (DSW) consisting of glucose – 30 g L-1, NH4Cl – 0.5 g L-1, KH2PO4 – 0.25 g L-1, KH2PO4 – 0.25 g L-1, MgCl2 – 0.3 g L-1, CoCl2 – 25 mg L-1, ZnCl2 – 11.5 mg L-1, CuCl2 – 10.5 mg L-1, CaCl2 – 5 mg L-1, MnCl2 – 15 mg L-1, FeCl3 – 25 mg L-1, NiSO4 – 16 mg L-1 was used as the fermentation medium. 2.1.2 Succinic acid producing strain and medium SA production was carried out using Citrobacter amalonaticus strain (IICTSVMSA-1) isolated in our laboratory by direct plating and enrichment techniques. The strain was deposited in the culture collection centre with deposition number NCIM-5782. In the earlier studies, SA production using IICTSVMSA-1 was optimized by studying the effect of different physiological and nutritional parameters [16]. The best condition yielding highest SA production from the previous study was employed in the current study. The fermentation medium used for SA production consisted of 30 g L-1 sucrose, 5 g L-1 peptone, 10 g L-1 yeast extract, 3 g L-1 K2HPO4, 1 g L-1 NaCl, 1 g L-1 (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g L-1 CaCl2·2H2O, 0.2 g L-1 MgCl2·6H2O and 1 g L-1 Na2CO3 (pH 7) and was autoclaved prior to use. 1 mL of the glycerol stock culture (stored at −70 °C) was inoculated to the growth medium and the culture was incubated overnight in anaerobic chamber filled with 5% H2, 10% CO2 and 85% N2 (Coy Laboratories, USA) at 37 °C. Cultures in stationary phase were harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation (8000g for 5 min), for preparing resting cell suspension. The cells were washed twice with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) prior to use. 2.1.3 PHA producing mixed consortium and medium PHA production was carried out in a two-stage process consisting of culture enrichment (Stage I) and PHA production (Stage II) designed and operated as described in the previous study [31]. Enriched MMC was obtained from Stage 1 reactor, which was being operated in the laboratory for the growth and enrichment of PHA producing MMC. This enriched MMC from stage I was utilized for PHA production using the VFA rich effluents obtained from the acidogenic fermentation process in the present study."
3,Experimental reactors and operation,"2.2 Experimental reactors and operation 2.2.1 Bio-H2 reactors Bio-H2 production was carried out in two continuous stirred bioreactors R1, which served as a control and test reactor R2, each with a working volume of 450 mL (59 × 34 × 28 cm) and gas holding capacity of 50 mL (head space). The bioreactors were operated in batch mode in a temperature-controlled water bath (37 °C) and unidirectional agitation was adjusted at 60 rpm for 60 s followed by pause for 120 s. Initially during the startup phase, the reactors were fed with 50 mL of inoculum along with 400 mL of DSW. Prior to operation, the pH of the reactor contents was adjusted to 6.0 using 0.1 N NaOH/HCl and the pH was left uncontrolled throughout the operation. Nitrogen gas was sparged for 4 min after every feeding and sampling event. The gas outlet of R1 was connected to a volumetric gas flow meter (µFlow, Bioprocess Control AB, Sweden), having detection range from 20 to 4000 NmL/h, through silicon pipes for continuous online measurements of biogas produced while the outlet of R2 was connected to SA producing bioreactor (R3). The gas stream from R2 was filter-sterilized with a 0.2-μ gas filter prior to entering R3. 2.2.2 Succinic acid reactor SA production was carried out in a 500 mL glass bottle (R3) sealed with butyl rubber stoppers with 450 mL of growth medium with the aforementioned composition (sterilized for 15 min at 121 °C, 15 psi). 2 ml of enriched culture was inoculated into the growth medium. The dry cell weight (DCW) of C. amalonaticus was calculated from a curve relating optical density at 600 nm (OD600) to dry weight. An OD600 of 2 of initial inoculum corresponded to 435 mg L-1 of biomass and the pH of the system was adjusted to 7 using 0.1 N NaOH/HCl. The gaseous outlet from R2 comprising of CO2 and H2 gases was connected to R3. The outlet from R3 was connected to the biogas flow meter in order to assess the consumption of CO2 and H2 during SA production. 2.2.3 PHA producing reactors PHA production was carried out in two stages, wherein in the first stage MMC were enriched thorough feast and famine strategy as reported elsewhere [31]. Suspended growth batch mode reactor, which functions with dynamic feeding strategy under aerobic microenvironment designed with a total/working volume of 13/10 L and being operated in the laboratory for PHA production was used for culture enrichment. The enriched MMC from this reactor was used as inoculum for PHA production in the reactor termed as R4 with a total/working volume of 500/400 mL. Aeration was provided by an air pump with a flow rate of 0.25–0.3 m3/h. The effluents rich in VFA (total VFA 4200 mg L-1, pH-4.5) obtained in R2 were used as the substrate for PHA production in this reactor. The pH of the feed was adjusted to 8 ± 0.05 prior to feeding and was left uncontrolled throughout the operation. After completion of the cycle (36 h), the entire culture of the reactor was decanted and subjected to PHA extraction. A schematic representation of bio-H2 utilization, CO2 sequestration and carbon capture from acidogenic fermentation for SA production by C. amalonaticus and PHB production is depicted in Fig. 1 ."
4,Analytical assays,"2.3 Analytical assays The concentration of soluble components (SA, VFA, sugars) was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu LC10A). HPLC analysis was performed by injecting 20 μL of filtered supernatant onto Shimadzu LC10A system with C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm dia; 5 μm particle size, flow rate, 0.6 mL min−1) using filtered milliQ water as mobile phase and a refractive index detector. The performance of R1 and R2 was evaluated by monitoring chemical oxygen demand ((COD)-closed refluxing-dichromate method), according to the procedures outlined in the standard methods [33]. The total gas production, consumption and composition was monitored using gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies: 7890) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) having a Heysep Q (GC Packed Column 2 M × 1/8″ x 2.0 mm ID, Heysep Q 80/100 Agilent) column. Argon was used as carrier gas. Both the injector and detector were maintained at 80 °C and the oven was operated at 100 °C. pH of the systems was monitored at 6 h intervals. The biomass concentration in R3 was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm using UV/Vis spectrophotometer. PHA extraction was performed based on the procedure reported elsewhere [34]. All the instruments and analytical equipments used at the time of experimentation were calibrated and maintained as per standard protocols. Results presented and discussed are average of two duplicate experimental outputs."
5,Biopolymer characterization,"2.4 Biopolymer characterization The PHA obtained was characterized using various techniques and was observed to be a homopolymer of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the samples were assayed using Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrophotometer in transmittance band mode in the range 4000–400 cm−1 using potassium bromide (KBr). The melting temperature and glass transition temperature of the biopolymer was analyzed using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). All the three thermal analyses were carried out simultaneously using TA-SDT Q600 thermo gravimetric analyzer. The runs were carried out at heating rate of 10 °C per min from ambient temperature to 600 °C at nitrogen atmosphere conditions."
6,CO2 fixation rates and SA yields,2.5 CO2 fixation rates and SA yields Fixation rate of CO2 (expressed as g L−1 h−1 in equation (1) and converted and represented as mMh−1) and SA yield (%) was calculated based on the equations 1 and 2 provided by Xi and Coworkers [35]. (1) C O 2 f i x a t i o n r a t e g L - 1 h - 1 = S A m a s s c o n c e n t r a t i o n g L - 1 F e r m e n t a t i o n t i me h × 0.373 0.373 for the synthesis of succinic acid reactive CO2 conversion factor SA yield (%) was calculated as (2) SA yield ( % ) = S A m a s s c o n c e n t r a t i o n g L - 1 C o n s u m p t i o n o f c a r b o n ( g L - 1 )
7,Results and discussion,
8,Acidogenic fermentation,"3.1 Acidogenic fermentation 3.1.1 Bio-H2 and CO2 production Two identical continuous stirred bioreactors R1 and R2 that served as control and test reactors, respectively were used. The gas outlet from R1 was connected to the biogas monitoring gas flow meter and the outlet of R2 was connected to the SA production reactor (R3). In both R1 and R2, same microbial inoculum and experimental conditions were maintained with an assumption that similar type of product profile would be obtained. Since same conditions were maintained in both the reactors, insignificant changes in the gas profile were observed. Total biogas production during acidogenic fermentation in both the reactors is plotted in Fig. 2 a and 2b. The results plotted in the figure depict that biogas production was observed from the beginning of the cycle and increased with time. An increase in biogas production was observed from 4 h of operation till 60 h. After 60 h, no further increment was observed and biogas production became stable. By the end of cycle (72 h), maximum biogas production of 689 NmL and 727 NmL was observed in R1 and R2, respectively. The composition of the total biogas was analyzed and it was noticed that the major fraction of biogas consisted of CO2 and bio-H2 with minute amounts of CH4. The concentration of bio-H2 increased till the 36 h and showed a decrement thereafter in both the reactors. Maximum bio-H2 production of 281 and 290 mL was observed at the 36 h in R1 and R2, respectively. CO2 is one of the major gases produced during fermentation and its fraction was slightly higher than bio-H2 in both the reactors. Although the concentration of bio-H2 was higher than CO2 until 36 h, but unlike bio-H2, the concentration of CO2 did not decrease as the cycle progressed. By the end of the cycle maximum CO2 concentration of 468 and 480 mL was observed at 72 h in R1 and R2, respectively. Since heat-treated inoculum was used in the present study, methanogenic bacteria were inhibited, resulting in the generation of low quantities of CH4. Similar to CO2, CH4 production also increased with time till the end of cycle and maximum production of 3.4 (R1) and 3.5 mL (R2) was observed at 72 h. 3.1.2 Volatile fatty acids (VFA) production The fermentation effluent from both R1 and R2 mainly consisted of VFA and residual COD at the end of cycle. During fermentation, the complex organic carbon sources are broken down to simpler monomers, which are then fermented to VFAs by the acidogenic bacteria. In both the reactors, a gradual increment in VFA concentration was observed with time and by the end of operation, total VFA of 4111 mg L-1 and 4200 mg L-1 was detected in R1 and R2, respectively. The composition of the total VFA was also monitored and it was composed of major fractions of acetic acid (AA) followed by butyric acid (BA), propionic acid (PA), valeric acid (VA) and ethanol. In both the reactors, the concentration of AA was the highest (R1-3432 mg L-1; R2-3600 mg L-1) accounting to 75–85% of the total VFAs, followed by BA (R1-515 mg L-1; R2-500 mg L-1), PA (R1-182 mg L-1; R2-180 mg L-1), VA (R1-92 mg L-1; R2-118 mg L-1) and ethanol (R1-28 mg L-1; R2-31 mg L-1) (Fig. 2c and 2d). These VFAs produced via acidogenic fermentation were subsequently used as substrates to produce PHAs. Since acids were generated, a drop in the pH of both the systems was observed. Initially, pH of the system was adjusted to 6, which showed a decrement upto 4.39 (R1) and 4.37 (R2) by the end of cycle. Efficient COD removal was also observed, which increased with time and maximum removal efficiency of 72 and 74% was achieved in R1 and R2, respectively by the end of cycle (Fig. 2e)."
9,Succinic acid production,"3.2 Succinic acid production SA production was performed in another reactor (R3) containing growth medium with the composition mentioned above and C. amalonaticus as the biocatalyst. After biogas was built up in R2 (24 h) the outlet was connected to R3. SA production was observed from 6 h of operation. Minute quantities of SA was observed during 6 h and increased to 2.61 g L-1 in the 12 h. During 24 h of operation, 6.5 g L-1 of SA was produced, which increased to 10.5 g L-1 during the 36 h and finally reached a concentration of 14.7 g L-1 by the end of cycle (48 h). Although the principal product of fermentation was SA, other acid by-products such as AA, lactic acid (LA), formic acid (FA), PA and ethanol were also formed (Fig. 3 ). Among all the by-products, the concentration of LA was the highest (6 g L-1) followed by AA (4.4 g L-1), FA (1.24 g L-1) and PA (0.96 g L-1). The concentration of all the acids increased with time except for FA whose concentration increased upto 24 h and later showed a decrement. This decrease in the FA concentration after a certain point of time might be due to its utilization during SA formation. In previous studies it was reported that FA compensates the energy requirement of a cell by providing energy-rich NADH molecule during conversion of OAA to succinate [36]. Based on the results obtained in previous studies, sucrose was used as a substrate, since it has a higher reducing nature in comparison to other sugars such as glucose or fructose [16,37]. Sucrose removal was observed to increase in accordance with SA formation and maximum removal of 86% was achieved by the end of cycle. % SA yield was calculated based on SA mass concentration and sucrose consumption. From the results it was observed that SA yield increased with time. At 12 h, 28% SA yield was observed and by the end of cycle, maximum yield of 56% was achieved, which is comparable to the values reported in the literature [38]. A reducing environment such as the NADH/NAD+ ratio that plays a crucial role in enhancing SA yield is influenced by the oxidation state of the substrate. Therefore, when sugars that are similar to glucose but with a different oxidation state help the cell in re-distributing the fermentation pattern for the formation of a reduced end product and also to maintain the redox balance [37,39]. This indicates that sucrose was a favorable substrate for enhancing the production of SA in the current study. 3.2.1 Bio-H2 and CO2 fixation Utilization of bio-H2 and fixation of CO2 during SA production was also evaluated. Initially, when the outlet of R2 was connected to R3, the influent CO2 volume was 234 mL while the outlet volume was 216 mL with CO2 fixation rate of 1.84 mM h−1 indicating that CO2 was used for SA production during the initial hours of the cycle. CO2 fixation rate steadily increased with time and was 2.74 mM h−1, 2.82 mM h−1 and 2.96 mM h−1 at 24, 36 and 48 h, respectively. As the cycle progressed, SA production also increased in correlation with the CO2 fixation rate (Fig. 4 ). The CO2 removal efficiency also correlated well with the SA concentration and CO2 fixation rate, wherein removal efficiency of 74% was observed by the end of cycle. CO2 supply is one of the important variables in SA fermentation and the amount of SA formed is directly proportional to the availability of CO2. In order to maximize the yield of SA from the substrate supplied, it is preferred that the flux of SA is through the reductive arm of the TCA cycle, which incorporates a CO2 fixation step [40]. The CO2, which is fixed needs to be produced in other metabolic processes like formation of biomass or substrate catabolism or should be externally supplied to the fermentation reactor. Theoretically, through fermentation, SA can be formed form sugars with the following stoichiometry Eq. (3): (3) Sugars + 2 C O 2 + 4 H 2 → 2 s u c c i n i c a c i d + 2 H 2 O One mole of SA is produced with the fixation of one mole of CO2 via the reductive arm of the TCA cycle. In other words, the higher availability of CO2 is one of the primary factors that influences SA production. Enhanced or continuous availability of CO2 could enhance the activity of PEP carboxykinase enzyme, resulting in higher SA production. In the previous studies where CO2 was supplemented at the beginning of the cycle, SA production of 12.07 g L-1 was observed as opposed to the current study where SA production increased by 2.6 g L-1 [16]. Similar to CO2, bio-H2 supplied from R2 was also consumed efficiently towards SA production. In comparison to CO2, the removal efficiency was higher and 84% removal was observed by the end of cycle. 3.2.2 Variations in pH and biomass The pH of the system is also another important factor that not only affects the product formation but also plays a key role in growth of the organism. Since CO2 is fixed during SA production, its solubility, which in turn depends on the pH of the system is a crucial parameter. From the experimental results it can be observed that the pH of the system showed a decrement from 6.8 to 4.79 by the end of cycle due to the accumulation of the acid end products (Fig. 5 ). A drastic increase in the biomass was observed from 0 h to 12 h after which only a gradual increment was observed."
10,Biopolymer production,"3.3 Biopolymer production VFA rich effluent from R2 was used as the substrate for biopolymer production in R4 using enriched MMC [31]. Prior to use, the effluent was allowed to settle to separate the pre-treated sludge. PHB production increased with time and by the end of cycle highest production of 0.23 gPHB/gDCW was achieved. The VFA was consumed as a substrate with a removal of 73% by the end of cycle (Fig. 6 ). 3.3.1 VFA utilization/removal The concentration of VFA obtained from R2 after AF was 4200 mg L-1 that depicted a decrement by the end of cycle. The total VFA concentration decreased to 2532 mg L-1 in 12 h and 1765 mg L-1 in the 24 h and by the end of cycle the concentration decreased to a maximum of 1116 mg L-1. The pH of the system increased from 7 to 7.42 by the end of cycle. The increment in pH might be due to the consumption of the VFAs present in the medium. The composition of the VFA rich effluent was dominated by AA followed by BA, PA and VA. The consumption of AA was higher in comparison to other acids. The concentration of AA decreased from 3600 mg L-1 to 1248 mg L-1 by the end of cycle. Although the removal % of BA surpassed AA in the initial hours, it fell behind during the remaining hours of operation (8 and 12 h). The concentration of BA decreased from 500 mg L-1 to 172 mg L-1 by the end of cycle. Since VA and ethanol were detected in only minute concentrations, their consumption towards PHB production was also quite low. By the end of cycle the concentration of VA (118 mg L-1) and ethanol (31 mg L-1) decreased to 82 mg L-1 and 25.6 mg L-1, respectively. In the case of PA the concentration decreased from 180 mg L-1 to only 92 mg L-1, indicating that PA was not favored as a substrate for PHA production. This is also evident in the polymer composition, which was a homopolymer of PHB. One of the major factors affecting MMC PHA production is the composition of VFAs in the feedstock, i.e., the relative proportions of AA, BA and PA. They not only influence the yield and productivity but also the monomer composition of the PHA (Fig. 7 ). Since AA and BA were the major acids consumed the polymer formed was solely made up of PHB units. The results obtained also confirm that VFAs are the preferred carbon sources for PHB production by MMC. The work also address the biorefinery concept [23,41–43]. 3.3.2 Characterization of PHB 3.3.2.1 FTIR analysis FTIR analysis of the extracted biopolymer was assayed to examine the functional groups and it was observed that the polymer was a homopolymer of PHB. The presence of various functional groups was identified and the structural confirmation of PHB is illustrated in Fig. 8 . The peak absorbance at 1722 corresponds to carbonyl stretching (C=O), which represents PHB. The band at 1459 cm−1 relates to C–H blending of CH2 groups, which includes the CH3 groups at 1380 cm−1. The bands in the range of 1176 and 1257 cm−1 correspond to C-O stretch of ester groups. All the FTIR absorbance peaks are in correlation with the PHB structure and previously reported studies [34,44]. 3.3.2.2 Thermal analysis The thermal properties of extracted PHB were examined using TGA, DSC and DTA analysis. TGA curves represent the changes in weight of the samples with the course of temperature. DSC analysis measures the amount of energy absorbed (endothermic) or released (endothermic) by the samples when they are heated or cooled, while the DTA curves illustrate the difference in temperature as exothermic or endothermic reactions in samples. The results obtained in TGA depict that the weight loss of PHB sample was noticed at 280 °C (Fig. 9 ). Thereafter, complete degradation of PHB was observed at 304 °C. DSC and DTA analysis of extracted PHB was assayed to examine the melting temperature (Tm). The peaks obtained in DSC and DTA analysis were endothermic and were observed at Tm of 280 °C."
11,Process efficiency of the integrated system,"3.4 Process efficiency of the integrated system Form the results obtained, the integrated process depicted good performance in terms of bio-H2 and CO2 fixation for SA production, VFA generation for PHA synthesis and wastewater treatment. A few important observations could be made from the results obtained. It could be observed that the gaseous effluent from acidogenic fermentation could be directly used without any upgradation or pretreatment and SA production can be enhanced by the continuous supply of CO2. In the current experimental setup, the gases were supplied to the SA reactor only for a certain amount of time due to batch operation. However at the pilot scale since the operation will be in a continuous mode, the gases would be available through the entire course of operation that might lead to improved SA production. In addition to CO2, the cellular metabolism can be affected by electron donors such as hydrogen. SA being an extremely reduced end product requires four electrons for its formation that can be supplied through an external electron donor. It is assumed that supply of H2 can decrease the cellular redox potential and helps promote NADP(H) recycle. Therefore, the continuous supply of bio-H2 might have also helped in creating a reducing environment, making it conducive for SA formation. Furthermore, various biological CO2 revalorisation strategies such as utilization of CO2 from biogas plants, terrestrial plants as CO2 sink and microalgal-based CO2 conversion are being utilized to counteract the increasing CO2 emissions [41]. Carbon sequestration by terrestrial plants can reduce atmospheric carbon, but only in very low levels, while the main challenge in microalgal-based CO2 conversion is the high cost, energy input and arable land required for commercial scale microalgal cultivation, harvesting and product conversion processes (transesterification) [41]. Bioconversion of CO2 to CH4 in anaerobic processes is an economically feasible options for on-site carbon management, however CH4 has a low added-value in comparison to bio-H2 which is being considered as a wide energy carrier for transportation and energy storage in the near future [42]. Therefore, the present work might also be used as an alternative process to bring down the bio-H2 purification cost, and potentially expand the use of both H2 and CO2. Previously it was reported that integrating bio-H2 production with other processes can enhance the economic value of the process. For example, theoretically, the market price of bio-H2 usually ranges from 1.5 and 5.0 €/kg and if the COD removal is 72.5%, the economic value of integrated process could show increment from 23 to 65% (23.9–45.0 €/tCODfed) in comparison to the total value of a single process (14.5–36.5 €/tCODfed) [42,43]. The combination of all the aforementioned aspects provides a strong context for the development of this process at large scale and defines the overall environmental gain achievable in comparison to single and simpler waste valorization strategies. However, effective, inexpensive and benign ways of product extraction require development to produce bioproducts at feasible costs."
12,Conclusion,"The present study demonstrates a biorefinery concept of integrating bio-H2 production with SA and PHA production. The results depict that a continuous supply of CO2 had a positive influence in enhancing SA production (14.7 g L-1). The bio-H2 acted as an effective electron donor and aided in the formation of the reduced SA end product. Apart from the gases, the effluents after acidogenic fermentation comprising of VFAs were effectively utilized for PHA production and 23 gPHB/gDCW was achieved. Among the acids acetic acid was consumed in major proportion followed by butyric and valeric acids that had a significant influence on the composition of the polymer. The advantage of supplying CO2, H2 and VFAs from acidogenic fermentation reactor for enhancing the yield of SA and PHA, demonstrated the feasibility of integrating these three processes in a biorefinery for production of bio-based plastics, and chemicals. It can also be expanded further to include more products to enhance resource efficiency, minimize waste generation and generate revenues."
