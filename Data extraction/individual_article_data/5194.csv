0,Introduction,"Cotton pulp black liquor (CPBL) is a byproduct generated in the production of cotton pulp dreg, which is the main raw material of viscose fiber manufacture. The cooking process to remove the non-cellulosic impurities in cotton linters, such as lignin and hemicellulose, produces large quantities of CPBL (Zhao et al., 2008; Al-Kaabi et al., 2019). The presence of a higher amount of organic matter, inorganic salts, and sodium hydroxide gives the CPBL a deep color and a high chemical oxygen demand (COD). Acidification combined with biochemical treatment has been used widely in CPBL treatment. However, biological treatment is slow and CPBL often needs to be diluted (Zhao et al., 2008). Besides, it cannot recover the alkali in CPBL and consumes a large amount of acid (Razali et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2018, 2020). Recently, the recovery and reuse of the residual alkali in CPBL and water for the cotton linters pulping process have received much attention. However, the low calorific value of CPBL makes alkali recovery by combustion inappropriate due to the too much additional auxiliary fuel requirement (Liu et al., 2016). As cotton pulp dreg production consumes a large amount of water, recycling of CPBL is of significant importance. It is well known that black liquor can be recycled in the production process if CPBL is decolorized not to affect the whiteness of the pulp dreg. The development of a cost-effective and efficient decolorization technique is in urgent need. Alkaline precipitation may be a promising alternative for black liquor treatment due to the interaction between high valence metal cations and organic pollutants with various functional groups in black liquor (Zheng and Chai, 2016). The cost of calcium salts is low, and the effluent keeps its strong alkaline condition after precipitation, which is beneficial to the recovery of alkali in CPBL. Decolorization of CPBL could be further enhanced by integrating alkaline precipitation with other processes such as advanced chemical oxidation. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been extensively studied for wastewater decolorization. Among them, Fenton oxidation has been applied to treat a variety of industrial wastewater because of its fast reaction rate, simple operation and high removal efficiency (Abedinzadeh et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2019). However, Fenton reaction usually proceeds in strong acidic conditions, and a large amount of iron sludge is produced during the reaction. Heterogeneous catalysts have been used to overcome these disadvantages, but heterogeneous catalyst synthesis process is complex and costly (Zhang et al., 2019). Using light or electricity to activate H2O2 consumes a lot of energy, which is not conducive to its industrial application (El Kateb et al., 2019). Recently, alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation has been introduced to degrade pollutants in wastewater. It has been confirmed that bicarbonate (HCO3 −) (Xu et al., 2011; Bokare and Choi, 2016; Kan et al., 2020), carbonate (CO3 2−) (Li et al., 2018), phosphate ion (Yang et al., 2016) and hydroxyl ion (OH−) (Wang et al., 2019) can be used to activate H2O2 to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical (.OH), singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2 −·) to degrade organic pollutants. Because of its low cost, green and simple, alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation is easier to apply in industry, especially for the treatment of alkaline wastewater. The main objective of this study was to develop an integrated process of alkaline precipitation and alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation for CPBL treatment. It is expected to reuse the treated wastewater with the residual alkali at cotton linters cooking in cotton pulp dreg production. To our best of knowledge, few studies in the treatment of CPBL with calcium salts combined with H2O2 oxidation activated by alkali has been conducted. The focuses of this study were (1) to compare the performances of acid precipitation and alkaline precipitation for CPBL treatment and characterize the sludge formed; (2) to study the effects of main operating parameters on treatment efficiencies; (3) to evaluate the variations of total alkalinity and OH− concentration in treatment processes; (4) to identify ROS that existed in the alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation process; (5) to reveal the main pollutant removal behavior in processes of alkaline precipitation and alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation; and (6) to preliminary evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the integrated process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The cotton pulp black liquor was taken from a chemical fiber plant in Shandong Province, China. Characteristics of cotton pulp black liquor are presented in Table 1 . All reagents used were analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Precipitation experiments,"2.2 Precipitation experiments A certain amount of CaCl2 or H2SO4 were added to 100 mL of cotton pulp black liquor, which was stirred by magnetic force for 5 min at room temperature (20 °C) and the supernatant was taken for analysis after settlement."
4,Advance oxidation experiments,"2.3 Advance oxidation experiments The supernatant of 100 mL resulted from the precipitation and centrifugation of CPBL was introduced to a conical flask, then 30% H2O2 was added and shaken at 150 rpm immediately in water bath to control temperature. The schematic diagram of alkaline precipitation, alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation and recycling processes is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Ascorbic acid (25 mM), p-benzoquinone (2 mM), furfuryl alcohol (50 mM), t-butanol (0.1 M) were used for radical scavengers before introducing H2O2 in radical test experiments."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The color, UV254 and lignin removals were expressed as the decay of absorbance at 465 nm, 254 nm, and 280 nm, respectively (Zhao et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2013; Shengpeng et al., 2020). The absorbance and UV–Vis spectra were measured by UV–Vis spectrophotometer. COD was determined by the potassium dichromate oxidation method. The total alkalinity of CPBL was detected by 0.1 mol L−1 HCl titration to pH 4.4. After samples were precipitated with 100 g L−1 BaCl2, the concentration of OH− was determined by 0.1 mol L−1 of HCl titration to pH 8.3. The concentration of total alkalinity and OH− of CPBL was calculated using the following equation: (1) C (mol/L) = C HCl ∗V 1 /V 2 where C represents the content of total alkalinity or OH− of CPBL, C HCl is HCl concentration, V 1 is added volume of HCl, and V 2 is the volume of wastewater before dilution. FTIR spectrum of the sludge was recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer. The samples were mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) to prepare the pellets for FTIR. Thermal analyses were determined by TGA and DSC analyzers of Mettler Toledo. The samples were tested by a TGA analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere (20 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 900 °C. DSC analyzer was applied from 30 °C to 500 °C. DTG curves were obtained by the first derivative calculation of TGA curves. GC-MS measurements were conducted as follows: 100 mL CPBL was extracted three times with a certain amount of dichloromethane under acidic conditions. Using anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove water from the combined extraction liquids and further concentrated it to 2 mL. After silylation derivatization, the extraction liquid was stored to prepare for analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (7890A-5975C, Agilent). The chromatography column was an HP-5 capillary column. Temperature program: 40 °C (held for 3 min) → 80 °C (2 °C min−1, held for 20 min) → 150 °C (2 °C min−1, held for 5 min) → 200 °C (5 °C min−1, held for 10 min) → 250 °C (10 °C min−1, held for 10 min) → 280 °C (20 °C min−1, held for 15 min). The sample of 1 μm was injected with 1 mL min−1 helium. The mass was matched by the NIST11. L mass spectrum library."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Precipitation treatment,"3.1 Precipitation treatment 3.1.1 Effects of pH Fig. 2 shows the effect of pH on UV254, color and COD removals. The significant removals were attained when the pH was less than 4. The highest removals of 17.98%, 56.4% and 22.37% of UV254, color and COD were attained at pH 2. The increase in CPBL treatment efficiency in a strongly acidic environment (H2SO4) was mainly attributed to the replacement of Na+ in soda lignin by H+, leading to the precipitation of lignin (Kumar et al., 2016). However, the addition of a large amount of strong acid like sulfuric acid would lead to the corrosion of the equipment and the waste of residual alkali in CPBL (Wang et al., 2020). As the pH of CPBL was 13, it is worth mentioning that no precipitate formed with the addition of lime, which was not dissolved at pH > 12.4. 3.1.2 CaCl2 precipitation As shown in Fig. 3 , removals of COD, UV254 and color increased with CaCl2 dosage increase from 3 to 13 g L−1. About 30.83%, 40.69% and 65.21% removals of COD, UV254 and color were achieved when 13 g L−1 CaCl2 was added. Note that the removals remained stable when the concentration of CaCl2 exceeded 13 g L−1. Ca2+ could form complex with organic pollutants containing various functional groups, such as –OH and –COOH in lignin and hemicellulose. The strong alkalinity of effluent can be maintained in the CaCl2 precipitation process, which was ascribed to the difficulty in the hydrolysis of CaCl2 and only small amount of OH− was consumed. Note that the pH of CPBL varied from 13 to around 12.7 in the precipitation process. The relative content of aromatic substances in wastewater is usually determined by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm (UV254), which is caused by electron-rich aromatic functional groups (Rodriguez et al., 2016). Under their respective optimal dosage, 22.71% higher UV254 removal in CaCl2 precipitation was found compared to H2SO4 precipitation, indicating that more aromatic compounds were removed. Alkaline precipitation with CaCl2 was superior to acid precipitation with respect to UV254, color and COD removals, cost reduction and recyclability of the alkali."
8,Precipitate characterization,"3.2 Precipitate characterization 3.2.1 FTIR spectra of precipitate Fig. 4 shows the results of FTIR spectra of the sludge formed in the precipitation with H2SO4 (H-sludge) or CaCl2 (Ca-sludge). All spectra exhibited a broad absorption peak at 3396 cm−1 due to H-bonded, O–H stretching vibrations of phenol, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (Liakos and Lazaridis, 2014). The peaks of 2854 cm−1 and 2924 cm−1 were for stretching vibrations of methylene/methyl groups of aliphatic chains (Liakos and Lazaridis, 2014). Compared to the relative intensity of Ca-sludge at 2854 cm−1 and 2924 cm−1, H-sludge had a higher ratio of methylene/methyl groups, suggesting the presence of longer and/or less branched chains in H-sludge (Santos and Duarte, 1998). The spectra indicated the main differences between Ca-sludge and H-sludge were in the 1710–620 cm−1 region. The peaks at 1602 cm−1 and 1631 cm−1 were attributed to the CC stretching of aromatic rings specifically syringyl and guaiacyl units, which are constituents of lignin (Carvalho et al., 2008). In the spectra of H-sludge, the peak at 1710 cm−1 was mainly attributed to the stretching vibrations of carbonyl groups (Shi et al., 2019). The absorption at 1516 cm−1 may correspond to stretching vibrations of aromatic rings of siringyl and guaiacyl units (Santos et al., 2000). The peak at 1465 cm−1 was due to the C–H stretching of methylene/methyl groups of aliphatic chains (Yao et al., 2019). The band at 1400 cm−1 may be ascribed to O–H deformation and stretching vibrations of phenolic hydroxyl, or C–H deformation of methylene/methyl groups (F.J. and K.M., 1971). A distinct strong band at 1128 cm−1 was caused by C–O stretching may correspond to phenols and ether bonds between aromatic monomers in lignins, which is quite typical in the spectra of lignins (Santos et al., 2000). The peak at 995 cm−1 was for the aromatic out-of-plane C–H bending. Absorption near 620 cm−1 was probably due to the S–O stretching of sulfonic groups (Yao et al., 2019), caused by addition of sulfuric acid to form sulfur-containing functional groups. In the spectra of Ca-sludge, peaks at 1420 cm−1, 1487 cm−1 and 1080 cm−1 were related to antisymmetric stretching of carboxyl groups in phenols, the stretching vibrations of CC in the benzene ring and C–O vibrations in secondary alcohols and aliphatic ethers (Dai et al., 2006; Carvalho et al., 2008). The bands at 870 cm−1 and 780 cm−1 were attributed to C–H out-of-plane deformations of guaiacyl and syringyl units (Sipponen et al., 2017). All spectra showed typical bands of lignin, indicating that both H2SO4 and CaCl2 could effectively remove lignin from CPBL, and the main structure of lignin were based on siringyl and guaiacyl units. CaCl2 could remove more unsaturated compounds than H2SO4 based on stronger aromatic absorption peaks of Ca-sludge. Spectra corresponding to Ca-sludge showed intense bands of carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups, which were potential binding sites with Ca2+. 3.2.2 Thermal analyses of precipitate The pyrolysis characteristics of H-sludge and Ca-sludge were investigated. TGA, DTG and DSC curves are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that there were three stages in the thermal mass loss of H-sludge. The range at lower temperatures (<150 °C) can be attributed to the evaporation of molecular water (Kauldhar and Yadav, 2018). The moisture content of sludge was related to the existence of hydrophilic groups in its structure, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (Fuentes da Silva et al., 2020). The mass loss at 150–550 °C was due to the degradation of organics, including the removal of the aliphatic side from the aromatics, carbon-carbon cleavage and the fragmentation of aromatic monomers inter linkage (ether bond) (Peng et al., 2014; Fuentes da Silva et al., 2020). The big mass loss above 700 °C could be explained with the condensation of char (Peng et al., 2014). The curves of Ca-sludge revealed different thermal behavior compared with H-sludge, which confirmed the difference between the two precipitation methods on the removed compounds. A much more intense mass loss of Ca-sludge occurred before 150 °C, suggesting more hydrophilic groups contained in Ca-sludge. In comparison, the curves for Ca-sludge were more complex than that of H-sludge in the stage of organics degradation. The DTG peak of Ca-sludge at about 180 °C was significantly more intense, which could be assigned to more small-molecular compounds contained in Ca-sludge, such as hemicellulose (Peng et al., 2014). TGA curves of the two samples showed a considerable mass loss above 700 °C. The mass loss appeared at 780 °C corresponds to the decomposition of inorganic salts such as calcium carbonate (Peng et al., 2014). The comparative study of pyrolysis characteristics of two samples revealed that lignin purity in H-sludge may be higher compared to Ca-sludge, while more small-molecular carbohydrates and inorganic impurities contained in Ca-sludge than H-sludge. The existence of impurities may impair the utilization of the sludge."
9,Alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation,"3.3 Alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation Alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation was conducted as a subsequent process of alkaline precipitation with 13 g L−1 CaCl2 to remove pollutants further without pH adjusting (pH 12.7). The influencing factors of H2O2 dosage, process time and reaction temperature were investigated. The effect of H2O2 dosage on the treatment efficiencies was investigated at 20 °C under 2 h of agitation. As shown in Fig. 6 a, an increase in the H2O2 dosage from 10 mmol L−1 to 30 mmol L−1 enhanced removals of UV254 and color. With the addition of 30 mmol L−1 H2O2, the removal efficiencies of UV254 and color were 10.88% and 60.45% at 2 h of reaction, but the removals of UV254 and color increased to 23.02% and 84.27% after settlement for 48 h, which was mainly attributed to the oxidation of residual H2O2. H2O2 was the only source of ROS for the decolorization of CPBL in this process (Li et al., 2018). It was found that the removals of UV254 and color were only slightly increased when H2O2 dosage exceeded 30 mmol L−1. The effect of agitation time and settlement time on removals was investigated in 30 mmol L−1 of H2O2 at 20 °C. The agitation time was in the range of 0–2 h, followed by 48 h settlement. Fig. 6b shows that the removals were greatly improved after settlement, and tended to be stable after 36 h. Two hours agitation time and 36 h settlement time were chosen as oxidation time. The effect of reaction temperature on treatment efficiencies was studied in 30 mmol L−1 H2O2 in 2 h agitation time and 36 h settlement time. It can be seen from Fig. 6c, removals of UV254 and color increased with the temperature. When the temperature increased to 60 °C, removal efficiencies of UV254 and color were 30.22% and 80.78%, and there was no change by further increasing the temperature. The higher performance of H2O2 oxidation as increasing reaction temperature may be due to the fact that thermal energy accelerated the activation of H2O2 and resulted in more free oxidative radicals formed in the process (Wang et al., 2019). When the reaction temperature was raised to 60 °C, the removals of UV254 and color at 2 h were the same as those after settlement for 36 h. The reaction rate of H2O2 oxidation was accelerated as the temperature increased, shortening the reaction time required. In this way, the optimum reaction temperature of 60 °C was chosen in subsequent experiments and the process time reduced to 2 h agitation time without a settlement. In practice, CPBL discharged from the cooking ball exceeded 95 °C, which indicated the possibility of thermal energy utilization of CPBL in the treatment process."
10,Identification of reactive oxygen species,"3.4 Identification of reactive oxygen species In recent years, many studies have confirmed that H2O2 exists in alkaline condition predominantly in its deprotonated hydroperoxyl anion (HO2 −) form and could be decomposed to ROS such as .OH, 1O2 and O2 −·, which are highly efficient in the degradation of organic compounds (Wang et al., 2019). In the reaction system, various ROS could be formed as follows: (2) H 2 O 2 ↔ H O 2 − + H + (3) H 2 O 2 + H O 2 − → H O 2 · + · O H + O H − (4) H O 2 · + H 2 O 2 → H 2 O + · O H + O 2 (5) H O 2 · + H O 2 · → H 2 O 2 + O 2 1 (6) H O 2 · ↔ O 2 − · + H + (7) · O H + O 2 − · → O H − + O 2 1 (8) · O H + H O 2 − → O 2 − · + H 2 O Ascorbic acid is commonly used as a free radicals trapping agent (Li et al., 2018), since ascorbic acid can be converted into dehydroascorbic acid by dehydrogenation, and reduce ROS such as .OH, 1O2 and O2 −· to water. As a typical radical scavenger, t-butanol can react with .OH by dehydrogenation at a reaction rate of 3.8–7.6 × 108 M−1 s−1, and reduce .OH to water (Shengpeng et al., 2020). Furfuryl alcohol has been reported as an effective scavenger for 1O2, and the reaction rate of additive reaction between furfuryl alcohol and 1O2 is 1.2 × 108 M−1 s−1 (Wang et al., 2019). It is generally believed that p-benzoquinone is an effective quencher for O2 −· that can get electron from O2 −· at a reaction rate of 9.6 × 108 M−1 s−1 (Kan et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). In order to distinguish ROS contributions in H2O2 oxidation system after CaCl2 precipitation, 0.1 M t-butanol (TBA), 50 mM furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2 mM p-benzoquinone (BQN) and 25 mM ascorbic acid (ASC) were used as free radical scavengers, and their inhibitory effects on removal efficiencies of color, UV254 and lignin were compared. The inhibitory effect of radical scavengers on decolorization of H2O2 oxidation is shown in Fig. 7 a. It can be seen that the removal efficiency of color was reduced from 82.55% to 38.46% with the addition of ASC, which demonstrated that ROS played a significant role in the decolorization of CPBL. The color removals in the presence of TBA, FA or BQN were 80.77%, 73.08% and 62.18%, respectively. It can be concluded that the contribution of ROS for color remove was in the sequence: O2 −· > 1O2 ≫ .OH. In other words, quantity of .OH may be very limited in the alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation system and O2 −· was one of the key ROS in decolorization of CPBL. In addition to H2O2 and O2 −· oxidation, 1O2 also played an insignificant role in the color removal. Fig. 7b shows the UV–Vis spectra of CPBL after 125 folds dilution before and after treatment with radical scavengers. The reduction of UV254 and lignin were also used to evaluate the inhibition effect of radical scavengers. When no ASC was added, the UV254 and lignin removal efficiencies were 28.23% and 35.11%. They decreased to 7.18% and 17.55% with the addition of ASC. The reductions of UV254 and lignin removal efficiencies were significant with the addition of ASC, which indicated that free racial attack was responsible for the oxidation. The absorbance in the range from 250 to 300 nm was related to the absorption of double bonds of aromatic or unsaturated compounds (Wang et al., 2013). As shown in Fig. 7b, the UV–Vis spectra of CPBL exhibited strong absorbance in that region, indicating that there was a large number of refractory aromatics in CPBL. A characteristic absorption peak of 263 nm was observed in the UV region of CPBL, which reflected the contribution of aromatic rings in organic matter structure (Sun et al., 2008). The intensity of the absorption peak at 263 nm was decreased in the oxidation process, indicating that there was a certain degree of structural damage of aromatic rings. The inhibitory effect of radical scavengers for UV263 was consistent with UV254. The overall efficacy of H2O2 oxidation followed the order of scavenger free ≈ TBA > FA > BQN > ASC. The UV–Vis spectra with the addition of TBA overlapped completely with scavenger free, indicating that .OH attack was negligible. The reaction schematic diagram between the radical scavengers and the ROS are shown in Fig. 7c. It should be noted that hydroperoxyl anion (HO2 −) also played an important role in the removal of color and lignin. In the presence of ASC, lignin removal was 17.55% compared with lignin removal of 35.11% without ASC. It is speculated that some of H2O2 dehydrogenated to form HO2 − under strong alkaline condition, which had strong nucleophilic property and resulted in the breakdown of the conjugated side chains of lignin and other colored substances. HO2 − could attack chromogenic groups of lignin, while it was hard to destroy lignin skeleton. However, O2 −· played the key role in the destruction of lignin skeleton structure."
11,The alkalinity and pH evolutions,"3.5 The alkalinity and pH evolutions The total alkalinity, OH− concentration and pH are important to the reuse of treated CPBL. From Fig. 8 , it can be seen that total alkalinity, COH − and pH of CPBL were 206 mM, 62 mM and 13, which presented a characteristic for high alkalinity. All treatment processes showed a downward trend in total alkalinity with the increase of processing steps and obvious differences in total alkalinity and COH- under different conditions. In the single H2O2 oxidation process, the total alkalinity decreased slightly, while single CaCl2 precipitation exhibited a comparably higher reduction in total alkalinity owing to the precipitation of some basic anions such as CO3 2− in CPBL with Ca2+. Moreover, there was almost no change of COH- in both processes. The two-stage treatment processes achieved a higher reduction in total alkalinity and COH-. As shown in Fig. 8, the total alkalinities were 206 mM (CPBL), 94 mM (CaCl2 precipitation) and 58 mM (CaCl2 precipitation-H2O2 oxidation) and OH− concentrations (COH −) were 62 mM (CPBL), 55 mM (CaCl2 precipitation) and 20 mM (CaCl2 precipitation-H2O2 oxidation). The sequence of CaCl2 and H2O2 addition had almost no effect on total alkalinity, COH − and pH. The effluent of alkaline precipitation with CaCl2 and alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation can be reused in the cooking process of cotton pulp dreg production."
12,Integrated process of precipitation and oxidation,"3.6 Integrated process of precipitation and oxidation The removal efficiencies under various conditions were assessed to prove the necessity of two-step treatment and the impact of the reaction sequence on removals in Fig. 9 . Decolorization of CPBL in the alkaline-H2O2 system without CaCl2 pretreatment was evaluated on account of strong oxidation of H2O2 under alkaline condition (Katafias et al., 2010). From Fig. 9a, removal efficiencies of UV254, lignin and color were 15.98%, 20.98% and 51.64% by standalone H2O2 oxidation. Although 13 g L−1 CaCl2 precipitation exhibited to be more effective in removal of colorants than standalone H2O2 oxidation, the following oxidation was also needed, which can further remove pollutants. As shown in Fig. 9a, there was a certain difference in removal efficiency for the sequence of H2O2 and CaCl2 addition. The removal efficiencies of UV254, lignin and color were 61.4%, 67.8% and 92.79% for CaCl2 precipitation followed by the alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation process, which was more effective, compared to alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation followed by CaCl2 precipitation. In alkaline condition, H2O2 oxidation can cleave the side chain of lignin, open benzene ring, produce new compounds with carboxylate or chromophore groups, and may further react to form oxalic acid, formic acid and other low molecular products (He et al., 2017). Although pre-oxidation produced more carboxylic acid groups, which can provide more binding sites for Ca2+, the decrease of the molecular weight of organic matter may have a negative effect on alkali precipitation, because the complexation of metal ions with organics could be more suitable for the removal of macromolecular organic matter (Yang et al., 2019). As shown in Fig. 9b, CaCl2 precipitation followed by the alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation process was more effective for the aromatic ring organics remove in CPBL. As expected, the aromatics and chromogenic groups can be removed to some extent by direct H2O2 oxidation. The characteristics of CPBL after alkaline precipitation followed by alkali activated H2O2 at the optimal conditions are shown in Table 2 . The integrated treatment can reduce most of lignin and other aromatic compounds in CPBL. COD was reduced by 33.8%, and 92.79% of the color was removed. The photograph of CPBL before and after treatment are shown in Fig. 9c. After CaCl2 precipitation combined H2O2 oxidation, the color of CPBL was reduced to light yellow."
13,Pollutant migration and transformation behavior,"3.7 Pollutant migration and transformation behavior Fig. 10 illustrates variations of structure information of substances in CPBL before and after treatment by FTIR spectra. After CaCl2 precipitation-H2O2 oxidation treatment, the disappearance of bands at 780 and 870 cm−1 indicates the removal of methylene/methyl groups in phenols. The GC-MS chromatogram of CPBL and corresponding analysis results are shown in Fig. S1, and Table S1. There are 56 peaks that could be identified with high reliability. Lignin is a complex three-dimensional aromatic polymer based on the linking of three phenylpropanoid units (p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl and syringyl), which is the main component of black liquor. During the pulping process, OH− in the cooking liquor reacts with the lignin nucleophilically to cause bond breaks between lignin units, forming lignin fragments dissolved in the black liquor (Torres et al., 2020). It can be seen from Table S1, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-benzoic acid/benzaldehyde/cinnamate and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy benzoic acid/benzaldehyde/cinnamic acid were identified in CPBL, corresponding to the characteristic lignin structural units, namely guaiacyl and syringyl. This was consistent with the analysis results of FTIR spectra. Another typical feature of CPBL was abundant in organic acids, produced by the degradation of carbohydrate, including aliphatic acids such as propionic acid, hexanoic acid, azelaic acid, hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid, as well as aromatic acids composed of benzoic acid and its derivatives. Moreover, it was also confirmed that acid precipitation could not remove carboxylic acids in CPBL. These compounds were deprototic in CPBL and existed in the form of corresponding sodium salts. Fig. 11 shows variations of intensity of peaks of compounds in CPBL after treatment. In CaCl2 precipitation process, propionic acid, butenoic acid, benzoic acid and other organic acids were largely removed, and some long-chain organic acids such as tetradecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid were almost completely removed, indicating that Ca2+ could be used for carboxylic acids removed. In addition, the structural units of lignin such as 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamate were effectively removed. In the H2O2 oxidation process, the removed compounds were mainly aromatic acids with multiple branches, which may be attributed to the attack of oxidants on the branches. Benzaldehyde and short-chain fatty acids, such as pentanoic acid, were also effectively removed. The results obtained from GC-MS indicated that all compounds removed by Ca2+ precipitation contain carboxyl groups or hydroxyl groups. It has also been reported that Ca2+ mainly combines with phenolic or carboxylic –OH to form calcium chelate (Sipponen et al., 2017). Under alkaline conditions (pH 13), the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of the compounds were deprotonated to form -COO- and -O- and complexed with Ca2+ to form precipitate. The generation of O2 −· is mainly based on reactions (Eq. (6) and (8)) in alkali-activated H2O2 process (Wang et al., 2019). Based on the above analyses of ROS in the H2O2 oxidation process, it can be reasoned that O2 −· was the dominant ROS, and HO2 − also played an important role in the removal of lignin and other color substances. The initial reaction was supposed to be dehydrogenated of H2O2 to form HO2 −, which subsequently reacted with H2O2 to form .OH and HO2 .. O2 −· can be produced by the further reaction between HO2 − and .OH, or by the self-decomposition of HO2 .. As well known, –NH2 groups were easy to be attacked by radicals, –CHO groups of aromatic rings could be oxidized to –COOH groups, and the oxidation process may be accompanied by the removal of methoxy and hydroxyl groups of aromatic rings, resulting in an increase of benzoic acid content. Based on above analyses of UV–Vis spectra, it was deduced that some benzene rings still existed. It is difficult to further mineralize oxidation products to CO2 and H2O. The scheme of transformation pathway of organic pollutants in CPBL by alkaline precipitation and alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation was proposed in Fig. 12 ."
14,Preliminary cost analyses for CPBL treatment,"3.8 Preliminary cost analyses for CPBL treatment The cost of wastewater treatment mainly includes capital and operation cost. In contrast, CaCl2 precipitation-H2O2 oxidation treatment has lower space requirement and installation cost than biological treatment. Operating cost include energy consumption, labor and chemicals consumption. The process is easy to be automated and mechanical energy is needed in precipitation and H2O2 oxidation process for agitation and sludge dewatering. According to the recent data obtained from the online trade platform, the current price of industrial grade CaCl2 (74%) and H2O2 (27.5%) are about RMB¥800 t−1 and RMB¥1000 t−1, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, approximately 17 kg 74% CaCl2 and 1.11 kg 27.5% H2O2 would be consumed for treatment of CPBL per ton (m3). Therefore, the estimated chemical consumption cost of the whole process could be about RMB¥14.71 m-3 (see Table 3 ). The values of water and residual NaOH are RMB¥3.5 m-3 and RMB¥3.2 m-3 (NaOH 20 mM, RMB¥4000 t−1). This process avoids the acid and biological treatment cost of about RMB¥8.5 m-3. The estimated reuse value of treated CPBL could be RMB¥15.2 m-3. The specific cost-benefit of the reuse of water and alkali cannot be determined as this assessment requires a pilot scale study. It is worth noting that the sludge produced in the treatment process contains a lot of lignin, and the sludge resource can be valorized further and improves the cost-effectiveness of the treatment process."
15,Conclusions,"This study aimed to develop an integrated process consisting of alkaline precipitation and alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation to treat CPBL. The obtained light yellow water with a certain alkali can be reused in cotton linters cooking for cotton pulp dreg production. The removal efficiencies of UV254, lignin and color in the integrated process were 61.4%, 67.8% and 92.79%, respectively. The pollutant removal behavior in CPBL was investigated, and the reduction of compounds after alkaline precipitation and alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation was examined. Radical quenching experiments confirmed that O2 −· was the dominant ROS in the alkali-activated H2O2 process. HO2 − also played an important role in the removals of lignin and color. After treatment, CPBL turned to light yellow with a pH of about 12.2 and 20 mM of NaOH. The chemical cost was estimated to be RMB¥14.71 m-3. The reuse value of treated CPBL was estimated to be RMB¥15.2 m-3. The alkaline precipitation using CaCl2 as a precipitant at pH 13 followed by alkali-activated H2O2 oxidation may have a great potential for the industrial application."
