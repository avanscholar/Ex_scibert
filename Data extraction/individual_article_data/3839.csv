0,Introduction,"The exploitation of clean and renewable energy sources has been an extremely urgent challenge [1–5]. Hydrogen, as one of the most ideal energy carriers, has been extensively studied [6–10]. Among numerous means of hydrogen production [11,12], water electrolysis is undoubtedly considered to be the most efficient way [13]. However, the water splitting under alkaline condition involves an additional water dissociation step so that the reaction rate is affected due to the increasing of energy barrier [14–16]. So it is crucial to fabricate high-performance HER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. Although Pt-based catalysts possess high HER activity, the inferior stability and resource scarcity restricted their broad application. Nowadays, plenty of transition metal based catalysts have been reported as ideal substitutes for precious metal catalysts, including metallic borides [17], carbides [15], nitrides [16], dichalcogenides [17] and phosphides [6,21,22]. Among them, phosphides have earned much attention due to the outstanding catalytic performance for HER. There have been numerous ways to obtain metal phosphides via different phosphorus sources, such as white (red) phosphorus, or ganophosphorus, hypophosphite and phosphate [23]. The reactions based on organophosphorus should be strictly controlled in water-free and oxygen-free conditions and the obtained materials require additional binder to adhere to collectors [24]. Another approach involves the reduction of metal phosphates [25], which demands high temperatures to break strong P–O bond. The two previous methods both require rigorous reaction conditions. At present, most of phosphides are acquired by low-temperature phosphating using white (red) phosphorus or hypophosphite as phosphorus source [26]. Actually, low-cost AlP is a potential phosphorus source and can react with solvents containing protons to produce phosphine. Based on the characteristic, it is possible to design all sorts of phosphides through AlP. Herein, the binderless NiCoP catalysts with diversified morphology were prepared and display exceptional HER activity in alkaline electrolyte. Different from the low-temperature phosphating in tube furnace, a solvent vapour thermal reaction (SVTR) was utilized to realize in-situ phosphorization at lower temperature using AlP as phosphorus source and applied to hydrogen production. We have prepared a unique electrode material applied in supercapacitor based on this synthetic strategy [27]. Besides, we modulate the degree of phosphorization by selecting different reaction solvents. It is found that solvents can influence morphology and catalytic activity of the materials. The unique SVTR can enrich the preparation approaches of phosphides and enlighten researchers to develop more catalysts."
1,Results and discussion,"In order to modulate the microstructure of phosphides to acquire optimal catalytic performance, a novel phosphating approach is proposed. This method based on SVTR can realize low-cost production under low temperature. Fig. 1 A shows the two-step synthetic strategy of four kinds of NiCoP materials with different morphology on Ni foam (NF). Firstly, conventional hydrothermal reaction is conducted to form NiCo–OH precursor (Step 1). Subsequently, the well-designed SVTR (Step 2) is carried out to accomplish phosphating process. Concretely speaking, while temperature rises, the solvent would vaporize and react with AlP to release phosphine. Meanwhile, generated phosphine and solvent vapours disperse around the precursor and interact with it. Since boiling points and proton numbers of each solvent are distinct, there may appear significant differences on reaction degree between AlP and solvents (Scheme S1), thereby impacting the morphology and HER performance of NiCoP. The crystallographic structure was determined by XRD test. According to Fig. 1B, the characteristic peaks of NiCoP appear after the phosphating process, confirming it is feasible to realize phosphorization based on SVTR. The diffraction peaks of EG-NiCoP and EA-NiCoP can be both assigned to NiCoP (JCPDS No. 71-2336). However, the stronger peak intensity of EG-NiCoP suggests a higher degree of crystallinity compared to EA-NiCoP, which benefits from more protons in ethylene glycol. In regard of W–NiCoP, Ni12P5 (JCPDS No. 74-1381) can also be observed from Fig. 1B except for NiCoP and the peaks of Ni substrate almost disappear, manifesting the phosphating reaction with the participation of water is so violent that the substrate has been corroded. Whereas, distinguished from the above materials, G-NiCoP shows unapparent peaks of NiCoP (Fig. 1B). It is likely because glycerol with high boiling point is difficult to react with AlP to release effective phosphine. So boiling points and proton numbers of solvents play significant roles in the generation of phosphine and the subsequent phosphating reaction. Based on the XRD results, we make it possible to modulate the degree of crystallinity through altering different solvents. Different solvents can not only affect the extent of crystallinity, but also bring about different micro-morphology. The SEM image of precursor in Fig. 2 A presents vertically-aligned nanowire arrays completely covered at the surface of NF. Undergoing the phosphating process, the NiCoP materials with multifarious shapes were acquired. As seen from Fig. 2B, EG-NiCoP shows conglobate configuration consisting of numerous nanowires, indicating the successful fabrication of hierarchical structure. The size of nanowires can be ascertained from the TEM image (Fig. 2E) with a diameter of 15–20 nm. Additionally, the lattice fringes appear in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2F) and the lattice spacing is about 0.220 nm, which can be assigned to NiCoP ((111) plane). With regard to EA-NiCoP (Fig. 2C), wirelike morphology is basically maintained except that the cusps are corroded. Comparing with the EDS data in Fig. S5A–B, more P has been incorporated in EG-NiCoP ((Ni + Co)/P = 2.9) relative to EA-NiCoP((Ni + Co)/P = 3.0). As for G-NiCoP, it seems that the precursor is covered by glycerol from Fig. S4A and P is not detected based on the EDS in Fig. S5C, further confirming the material is hardly phosphatized. When AlP encounters water, it is easy to generate phosphine even in atmospheric temperature. According to the EDS result of W–NiCoP (Fig. S5D), the vast majority of cobalt fells from NF so that there is little cobalt left and then the substrate is phosphatized. That is why Ni12P5 can be observed from Fig. 1B. Surprisingly, the morphology of W–NiCoP is similar to organic cauliflowers (Fig. 2D and Fig. S4D). Therefore, the phosphating degree and morphology of these electrodes are regulated successfully based on the difference in reaction extent between AlP and selected solvents. During the preparation, the solvent will vaporize and react with AlP to release phosphine. Meanwhile, solvent vapours and generated phosphine disperse around the precursor and then interact with it in the reactor. If the boiling point is higher, there will be less solvent vapour and phosphine in the reflector. The proton numbers of solvent has similar effect. So boiling point and proton number of solvent will directly affect the subsequent phosphating reaction. The ethylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, distilled water and glycerol have different boiling point and proton number. As shown in Scheme S1, although ethyl alcohol possesses a low boiling point (78.4 °C), its low proton number (one) is not conducive to the production of a large quantities of phosphine. Therefore, there is more ethanol steam and less phosphine in the reactor. On the contrary, glycerol possesses high boiling point (290.0 °C), so there is less glycerol steam and less phosphine in the reactor. These will result in low degree of phosphatization. Water produces steam easily (100.0 °C) and has abundant protons (two), which benefits for the production of phosphine, but a large amount of phosphine will result in the destruction of microstructure and the formation of by-products on electrode. However, ethylene glycol possesses optimal boiling point (197.3 °C) and proton number (two), and then there are optimal quantity for steam and phosphine in the reactor. Therefore EG-NiCoP obtains high the degree of phosphatization (Fig. S5) and hierarchical structure (Fig. 2) with high electrochemically active surface area (Fig. S12). To further investigate NiCoP, Gibbs free energy (ΔGH∗) and water adsorption energy of (111), (001), (100) and (010) facets towards HER were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). As demonstrated in Table S1, the clean surface energies in vacuum have a trend of (111) < (001) < (100) = (010), indicating that the (111) plane has the highest stability. Since the HER catalytic activity depends on the intensity of the adsorption and desorption for H. The closer | Δ G H ∗ | gets to thermo-neutral ( | Δ G H ∗ | = 0 ) , the better the catalytic activity [28,29]. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the calculated ΔGH∗ value of NiCoP (111) plane is −0.19 eV, while the values of (001), (100) and (010) planes are −0.52, −0.45 and −0.45 eV, respectively. The smallest | Δ G H ∗ | value reveals that the (111) plane owns the highest electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the HER requires an extra step for water dissociation in alkaline electrolyte [30]. Thus, the adsorption energies of H2O on different facets were further calculated (Fig. 3B). With regard to HER in alkaline media, it is known the adsorption energy of H2O in the first step has more important influence on the HER catalytic performance compared with the ΔGH∗ and the high adsorption energy of H2O benefit for the improvement of activity [29]. The NiCoP (111) plane shows high adsorption energy of water. Although it is slightly lower than that of (100) and (010) planes, the value of | Δ G H ∗ | for NiCoP (111) plane is much less than that of (100) and (010) planes. Therefore, DFT results manifest that (111) plane of NiCoP possesses the highest catalytic activity. The states of elements were detected by XPS. In Ni 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 spectrum (Fig. 4 A) of EG-NiCoP, the peaks at about 853.3 and 870.5 eV are assigned to Ni–P, while the peaks around 857.4 and 874.3 eV are related to Ni oxidation state due to the inevitably oxidation in the oxygen environment [31,32]. Note that the characteristic peak of metallic Ni at 852.6 eV [15] is lower than that of 853.3 eV in Ni–P, indicating the presence of positively charged Ni component (δ+) in NiCoP. As for Co 2p3/2 spectrum in Fig. 4B, the peak of Co–P is situated at 778.3 eV [33], of which the binding energy is slightly higher than metallic Co (777.9 eV) [31]. This phenomenon is similar to Ni, manifesting Co carries a fraction of positive charge (δ+) as well. Besides, two peaks at 781.7 eV and 797.6 eV belong to Co (II) species [34]. In Fig. 4C, P 2p is deconvoluted into three peaks, containing the first peak at 129.6 eV from metal phosphides, the second one at 130.4 eV from elemental P and the last one at 133.4 eV from the high oxidation state of P [35]. The lower binding energy of metal phosphides compared to elemental P reveals that P obtains a partially negative charge (δ−). The appearance of positive and negative charges demonstrates a part of electron transfer from Ni and Co to P [31]. Furthermore, in contrast to Ni2P, the P 2p XPS peaks of EG-NiCoP (Fig. 4D) show 0.5 eV shifting to lower binding energy, indicating P carries more negative charges with the existence of Co. Therefore, the abundant electron cloud density is beneficial to the adsorption of hydrogen, thereby promoting the HER activity of EG-NiCoP. Fig. 5A and Fig. S9A display the polarization curves of Pt/C, EG-NiCoP, EA-NiCoP, G-NiCoP, W–NiCoP, NiCo–OH, Ni2P and NF, respectively. Among these catalysts, the HER activity of EG-NiCoP is comparable with Pt/C and outperforms the remaining electrodes and some reported catalysts in Table S2. Although the polarization current of EG-NiCoP lags behind that of Pt/C at low overpotential, it has overtaken commercial Pt/C at a larger overpotential of about 150 mV. The superior activity is also evidenced by the galvanostatic test, which is an accurate and valid method to confirm the overpotential at a given current density. As a result, EG-NiCoP shows low overpotentials of 57 mV (10 mA/cm2) and 116 mV (100 mA/cm2). Its near platinum's behavior may be ascribed to the appropriate degree of phosphorization, hiberarchy and large specific surface area. Comparing the polarization curves of other NiCoP materials, the catalytic property of EA-NiCoP and G-NiCoP is inferior to that of EG-NiCoP, which is most likely due to the low extent of phosphorization. Moreover, the excessive phosphorization makes W–NiCoP perform worst as well. The discrepant catalytic activity of EG-NiCoP, EA-NiCoP, G-NiCoP and W–NiCoP is ascribed to different reaction degree between AlP and the corresponding solvents, confirming the HER activity of NiCoP can be controlled by solvents during the phosphating process. According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 1B), the SEM images (Fig. 2) and the EDS data in Fig. S5A–B, these NiCoP materials possess different degree of phosphorization and microstructure. Among them, EG-NiCoP possesses high degree of phosphorization, which benefits for the exposure of (111) facet of NiCoP with high catalytic activity for HER (Fig. 3). Besides, EG-NiCoP obtains hierarchical nanostructure (Fig. 2B), improving the electrolyte infiltration and increasing the electrochemically active surface area (Fig. S12) and the number of active sites. Therefore, EG-NiCoP shows high HER catalytic activity. As a control, The HER catalytic performance of Ni2P is lower than that of the NiCoP samples, implying cobalt plays a significant role towards the enhanced catalytic activity. Moreover, HER activity of all the phosphides exceeds that of NiCo–OH, which illuminates the momentous effect of phosphorus. As mentioned in XPS, P gathers abundant negative charges from metals and becomes crucial active sites enabling metal phosphides to present outstanding HER performance. Besides, phosphides possessing the favourable electrical conductivity are more propitious to electron transport than the precursor. Therefore, the synergistic effect of Ni, Co and P in NiCoP promotes the improvement of electron cloud density and electrical conductivity and then EG-NiCoP with high phosphating degree and hierarchical nanostructure shows outstanding HER catalytic performance. Tafel plots can be used to probe the reaction kinetics and reveal the reaction mechanism for HER. In Fig. 5 B, the Tafel slope of EG-NiCoP is as low as 58 mV/dec, indicating EG-NiCoP is dominated by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Nevertheless, the Volmer-Tafel mechanism is responsible for Pt/C with a lower value of 33 mV/dec. As a comparison, higher Tafel slopes (84, 99, 114, 101 and 110 mV/dec) can be observed for EA-NiCoP, G-NiCoP, W–NiCoP, Ni2P and NiCo–OH in Fig. 4B and Fig. S9B, respectively. The intuitional comparison between the NiCoP materials in this study is shown in Fig. 5C–E by means of bar charts. Exchange current density (J0) as the inherent attribute of each material can be acquired by extrapolating the Tafel plots to the x-axis [36] in Fig. S10. As seen in Table S3, the value of EG-NiCoP (2.4 mA/cm2) is quite close to Pt/C (2.9 mA/cm2), verifying its near platinum's behavior adequately. Consequently, the low Tafel slope and the large J0 both manifest EG-NiCoP owns fast electron transfer efficiency and favourable HER kinetics. The electroconductivity of electrodes and HER kinetics can be reflected from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots. Benefiting from the three-dimensional NF substrate, all of the NiCoP samples present small charge transfer resistance (Rct) under the overpotential of 200 mV (Fig. S11). It could be that in-situ resultant NiCoP ensures high-efficiency charge transfer between catalysts and substrates, and then improves the electrical conductivity. Obviously, EG-NiCoP owns the minimum Rct among the as-prepared NiCoP catalysts, reflecting its ultrahigh electrical conductivity and fast HER kinetics. To study the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), we further tested the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl). It is observed that the capacitances are determined to be 196.4 mF/cm2 for EG-NiCoP, 124.6 mF/cm2 for EA-NiCoP, 108.8 mF/cm2 for G-NiCoP and 5.7 mF/cm2 for W–NiCoP in Fig. S12. The larger Cdl value is, the bigger ECSA will be, which indicates the existence of more active sites. That is one of crucial reasons why EG-NiCoP possesses such exceptional electrocatalytic activity for HER. Stability is another crucial parameter to appraise catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table S4, no matter which current density is employed, EG-NiCoP is robust enough to withstand a long-playing test for 12 h compared to other catalysts, especially Pt/C. Besides, the polarization curve after 1,000 cycles gives more insight into durability of EG-NiCoP in alkaline electrolyte (Fig. S13). The superior stability indicates the EG-NiCoP electrode is promising substitute for precious metal catalysts. The faraday efficiency (the ratio of the output of experimentally quantified H2 and theoretically yield of H2) almost reaches 100% (Fig. S14), which signifies the cathodic current is indeed created by hydrogen evolution."
2,Conclusion,"In summary, several noble-metal-free and binder-free NiCoP materials have been synthesized via a new-style SVTR as highly efficient catalysts for HER. Owing to the different reaction degree between AlP and diverse solvents with different boiling points and the number of protons, the as-prepared catalysts possess different phosphating degree, various micro-topography and discrepant HER catalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte. Among these catalysts, EG-NiCoP exhibits the most superior catalytic activity, of which the overpotential is as low as 57 mV (10 mA/cm2) and 116 mV (100 mA/cm2). The small Tafel slope (58 mV/dec) and low resistance both indicate fast HER kinetics. Besides, the stability of EG-NiCoP is satisfying even at high current density (100 mA/cm2). On the one hand, the exceptional performance of EG-NiCoP benefits from its appropriate degree of phosphorization and the hierarchical structure. On the other hand, large electrochemically active surface area and favourable conductivity all make contributions to the outstanding catalytic activity. More importantly, the novel phosphating method can pave the way for designing more metal phosphides to be applied to other fields, such as water splitting, batteries and supercapacitors."
