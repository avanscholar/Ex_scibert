0,Introduction,"Fuel cell development has seen remarkable progress in the past decades because of an increasing need for enhanced energy conversion efficiency and because of serious concerns about the environmental consequences of using fossil fuels for electricity production. A fuel cell directly transforms chemical energy in the form of hydrogen into electrical energy without limitations of the Carnot efficiency. Fuel cell systems operating on pure hydrogen produce only water, thus eliminating all emissions locally. The demands for the purity grade of the used hydrogen fuel are dependent on the type of fuel cell being considered [1,2]. High-temperature fuel cells tolerate high concentrations of CO x (CO, CO2) in the hydrogen feed, while this ability is weak for low-temperature fuel cells because CO adsorbs irreversibly on the surface of the electrode catalysts, such as Pt, and blocks the reaction sites for hydrogen. Thus, for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is a candidate for the propulsion of vehicles and for dispersed power plants, CO is a strong poison even at low concentrations. The current state of PEMFC development requires a hydrogen gas quality of about y CO < 20 ppm . Conventional hydrogen production technologies such as steam reforming, auto-thermal reforming and partial oxidation of methane yield large amounts of CO as by-product. Reduction of the CO content down to the ppm-range using these processes mostly leads to complex multi-step reaction/purification trains of bulky apparatuses [2–4]. These drawbacks remain a serious technological obstacle in the practical utilization of these processes for PEMFC hydrogen supply. As a novel alternative to the just mentioned conventional technologies, methane steam reforming based on the iron redox cycle, which was designed to convert hydrocarbons to hydrogen with a quality that exceeds the requirements of all types of fuel cells, has obtained significant attention [5–14]. This two-step process is performed in a single reactor unit without any additional post-processing of the product gas, i.e. no additional water gas shift reactors and/or preferential oxidation reactors are needed. The technology is based on the periodic reduction/re-oxidation of iron oxides. During the first step of the cycle (iron oxide reduction), methane (or gasified biomass) reduces the iron oxide to iron, Eq. (1). During the second step (iron re-oxidation), steam is used as oxidizing agent for iron, simultaneously producing hydrogen according to Eq. (2). The produced gas consists of steam and pure hydrogen that can be supplied directly to a PEMFC: (1) CH 4 + Fe 3 O 4 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O + 3 Fe , (2) 4 H 2 O + 3 Fe → 4 H 2 + Fe 3 O 4 . However, the overall hydrogen production depends on the slower process step, which is the reduction of iron oxide to iron, Eq. (1). Furthermore, the iron oxides which are carrying the redox reaction can be deactivated by sintering phenomena. Otsuka et al. [13] and Takenaka et al. [14] have found that the addition of Cr cations to iron oxides mitigated the sintering of iron metal and/or iron oxides during the redox process at temperature above 1023K. Addition of Ni to iron oxide enhanced the reduction with methane and the subsequent oxidation with water vapor. The iron oxide containing both Ni and Cr species was able to produce pure hydrogen at a temperature of 923K [13,14]. The reaction rate of reduction can be enhanced and the deactivation of iron oxides can be reduced by applying the concept of a periodically operated two-layer catalytic reactor, as suggested in a previous work [15]. In that reactor, two fixed beds of different catalytically active oxide materials are working at the same temperature. The use of Pt–Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 in the first catalyst layer leads to a significant enhancement of the methane oxidation rate compared to iron oxides, and thus allows decreasing of the operating temperature resulting in an improved overall process performance. Furthermore, the addition of ceria oxide to iron in the second layer protects the iron metal and/or iron oxides against sintering during the redox cycle and increases significantly the reduction rate by H2 and the re-oxidation rate by H2O. The major disadvantage of the proposed two-layer reactor is the fact that the first layer is operated periodically for syngas production although it could be operated under steady-state conditions with a much higher productivity. This leads to an improved process concept being based on the combination of a steady-state reformer followed by a cyclic water gas shift (CWGS) reactor (see Fig. 1 ). The advantages of this modification are a better flexibility and an improved performance of the overall process. The objective of the present study is to analyze the behavior of the CWGS reactor using syngas as feed. In the following, thermodynamic data as well as kinetic experiments (at Fe2O3–CeO2–ZrO2 as oxygen storing material) are presented which are an important prerequisite for the appropriate design of a technical-scale H2-processor for PEMFC."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of oxide materials,"2.1 Preparation of oxide materials In this study, 30wt%-Fe2O3–CeO2–ZrO2 was investigated as catalytically active oxygen storage material for the proposed cyclic redox process. This material was prepared via urea hydrolysis [15–17]. Fe–Ce–Zr mixed oxide samples were synthesized from Fe ( NO 3 ) 3 · 9 H 2 O (99.0%, Fluka), Ce ( NO 3 ) 3 · 6 H 2 O (99.0%, Fluka) and ZrO ( NO 3 ) 3 · 6 H 2 O (99.0%, Fluka). The starting metal salts were dissolved in distilled water to the desired concentration (0.1M). The ratio between the metal salts can be altered depending on the desired concentration. Here we used Fe0.3(Ce0.5Zr0.5O2)0.7. The mixed metal salt solution was added to a 0.4M solution of urea (99.0%, Fluka) with a salt to urea solution ratio of 2:1 (v/v). This mixture was kept at 100 ∘ C for 24h. After this step, the sample was allowed to cool to room temperature prior to being centrifuged in order to separate a gel product from the solution. The gel was washed with ethanol, dried overnight in an oven at 110 ∘ C , grinded to a size of about 1 μ m and then calcinated at 850 ∘ C for 4h. Finally, the material was pressed, grinded and sieved. The resulting mean particle size was 0.25mm. A more detailed characterization of the fresh and used oxygen storage material (30wt%-Fe2O3–CeO2–ZrO2) can be found in our previous works [18,19]."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure Redox cycle experiments of 30wt%-Fe2O3–CeO2–ZrO2 were carried out in a differential quartz tube reactor (i.d. 10mm). Typically, a mass of 10g of material was packed between layers of quartz wool. The reactor was placed in an electric furnace. The temperatures in the center of the packed bed and at the reactor wall were measured by K-type thermocouples. The reduction step (phase I of the process cycle) was performed by gas mixtures containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen in helium as carrier gas. The total flow rate of the feed gas into the reactor was kept constant at 120ml/min by Brooks mass flow controller. The reactor was operated in the temperature range from 700 to 825 ∘ C . Before re-oxidation, the mixture of rest hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the lines was removed by helium purging for 10min. Subsequently, the re-oxidation of the reduced material with steam (phase II of the process cycle) was performed at a flow rate of 120ml/min immediately after the reduction of the 30wt%-Fe2O3–CeZrO2 material. The concentration of the reagents and products was monitored using an MS Agilent 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector. The conversion degree of oxygen of the reduced material, X O 2 , was calculated on the basis of the amount of oxygen which theoretically could be removed from the material and the amount of oxygen which was released as gaseous products (H2O, CO2): (3) X O 2 = N H 2 O + 2 N CO 2 4 N Fe 3 O 4 + 0.5 N CeO 2 × 100 % . The PEMFC stack which was connected to the CWGS reactor in this study had five cells with a self-breathing cathode and an cell area of 26cm2. The anode gas flow rate was 120ml/min and the gas inlet temperature was ambient. The membrane electrode assembly consisted of a NAFION TM N-105 membrane (DuPont, USA) onto which catalyst layers were applied. The catalyst used was pure unsupported platinum black of type HiSPEC1000 TM (AlfaAesar-Johnson Matthey GmbH, Germany). The catalyst loading was 1 mg Pt cm - 2 . In the catalyst layers also a 10wt% content (relative to the platinum weight) of the NAFION TM polymer was present. The stack was designed, manufactured and assembled in-house, i.e. by the workshop of the authors’ institute."

5,Selection of operating temperature,"3.1 Selection of operating temperature The optimal reaction temperature for the CWGS process range can be identified from a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic data of the reactions being involved. Plots of the Gibbs free energy change for iron oxides reduction by CO and by H2 versus temperature are depicted in Fig. 2 , respectively. The data show that the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and of Fe3O4 to FeO are favored at higher temperatures. This is valid for H2 as well as for CO. Furthermore, one can see that—at standard conditions—the formation of carbon by the Bouduard reaction is thermodynamically not favored at temperatures above 700 ∘ C . Coke being produced on the solid material surface during the reduction cycle phase by the Bouduard reaction, Eq. (4), leads to a CO production during the re-oxidation step according to Eq. (5): (4) 2 CO ↔ C + CO 2 , (5) C + H 2 O ↔ CO + H 2 . In order to design a stable hydrogen production process, it is important to identify operation conditions at which carbon deposition can be avoided. Such conditions can be predicted by a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of coupled gas and solid phases (oxides and carbon) as shown e.g. by Koh et al. [20]. Applying the methodology of these authors, in the present study thermodynamic calculations were done for a gas composition containing initially 20vol% CO in helium. As possible gas phase species CO and CO2 were considered and as relevant solid species Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, Fe and carbon. The thermodynamic data were obtained from [21], and for carbon (here assumed: graphite) from [22]. By minimizing the total Gibbs energy of the entire system (assuming ideal gas behavior and treating the solid species as pure condensed phases), the equilibrium composition of the gas phase and the solid phase as well as the amount of deposited carbon at equilibrium was determined at various temperatures and at different initial oxygen loading of the oxide material. Fig. 3 shows the calculated degree of oxygen conversion at which carbon deposition is thermodynamically favored at given temperature. The analysis reveals that in the temperature range from 600 to 900 ∘ C at oxygen conversions lower than X O 2 = 25 % elementary carbon is not a stable component in this system. Coke formation is likely at temperatures below 716 ∘ C if the oxygen conversion degree is higher than X O 2 = 30 % , and over the whole temperature range if the oxygen conversion degree is close to 100%. Hence, thermodynamic analysis shows that the temperature range between 720 and 850 ∘ C is most suitable for hydrogen production by the proposed redox cycle of the Fe2O3–CeZrO2 material."
6,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production Fig. 4 shows the changes of CO, CO2, H2 and H2O concentrations as a function of time during the reduction phase using syngas with 40% hydrogen and 15% CO with helium as carrier gas. The solid material initially was pre-conditioned by several cycles such that is was fully converted into 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 [15]. In the beginning, only CO2 and H2O were detected in the product stream. After a reaction time of about 120s, hydrogen and carbon monoxide were also found in the outlet gas mixture. Their concentrations increased steadily and the concentration of CO2 and H2O decreased already before the oxide material was reduced completely. Additional reduction experiments with the 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 material were carried out with a CO/H2 mixture containing a small amount of methane ( < 1 vol% ) . This is relevant for the combined operation of a reforming reactor and the CWGS reactor where the reformer effluent might contain traces of non-converted methane. With this feed composition, we observed a methane conversion degree of 20–25% in the initial period of the reaction. The conversion decreased with the time and achieved 5–7%, but it increased after the degree of oxygen conversion was higher than 80%. This observation indicates that methane decomposition ( CH 4 → 2 H 2 + C ) was catalyzed by reduced iron species. Low catalytic activity for methane oxidation by iron oxides was also observed in our previous work [15]. During the addition of steam into the CWGS reactor pure hydrogen is produced and iron oxides and ceria oxides are re-oxidized for the next reduction phase of the redox cycle. Fig. 5 shows the observed evolution of the hydrogen formation rate as a function of time during the re-oxidation of the reduced material with steam at 800 ∘ C . As can be seen in Fig. 5, the formation rate of hydrogen during the first 9min was nearly constant. Finally, it was possible to repeat the here reported hydrogen production behavior during 15 redox cycles. During those cycles the oxygen storage material (30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2) lost 17% of its initial activity. The BET surface area of Fe2O3–CeO2–ZrO2 was found to decrease from 11m2/g for the fresh sample to 6m2/g for the used sample. The mean particle diameters for the fresh and used samples were 50 and 140nm, respectively. Thus, deactivation of the oxygen storage material during redox cycles happened due to sintering. For evaluating the process performance, the following fuel efficiency η is defined: (6) η = N H 2 , out N H 2 , in + N CO , in = N H 2 O , out + N CO 2 , out N H 2 , in + N CO , in . Fig. 6 shows the calculated efficiencies in dependence on the oxygen conversion degree at an operating temperature of T = 800 ∘ C . These results clearly indicate that the efficiency decreases during the reduction of the 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 material and it approaches an approximate value of 30% at the highest obtained oxygen conversion. At 750 and 825 ∘ C the efficiency was 25% and 37.5%, respectively. Thus, higher working temperatures favored higher efficiencies. A temperature increase results in a better redox ability of the oxygen storage material. On the other hand, it would be desirable to operate at as low process temperatures as possible in order to minimize the rate of iron oxide sintering. Most important, the process efficiency increases by decreasing the oxygen conversion level, by increasing the oxygen storage capacity of the solid phase and by increasing the rate of oxygen release from the solid Fe3O4–CeZrO2 particles during the reduction phase. In our previous work [18] it was found that the reduction of 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 is a complex transformation process which includes the simultaneous reduction of the compounds Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and CeZrO2 which are dominated by different physico-chemical sub-processes. At oxygen conversion below 50% the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and of CeO2 to Ce2O3 are fast steps being controlled by phase-boundary-controlled and nucleation-controlled reactions. At higher oxygen conversion, the reduction of Fe3O4 and CeO2 is controlled by solid phase diffusion [18]. The obtained results indicate that hydrogen can be generated with high reproducibility using 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 as oxygen storage material by reduction with syngas followed by subsequent oxidation with water vapor. The purity of the produced hydrogen gas during the iron redox process is a crucial parameter for its applicability as feed for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the CO concentration in the hydrogen product gas during the re-oxidation step by water vapor at different oxygen conversion degree. The data indicate that the amount of undesired carbon monoxide being formed according to the reactions in Eqs. (4) and (5) depends on the oxygen conversion degree of the solid material. The conversion should be below 60% in order to restrict carbon deposition on the surface to an acceptable level and thereby to guarantee a CO content below 20ppm in the produced hydrogen gas. Furthermore, after the reduction investigations, the reactor was purged for 5min with He at a flow rate of 240cm3/min to clean the gas lines from traces of CO and H2. Subsequently, He was introduced at a flow rate of 60cm3/min to burn the carbon being deposited on the solid surface by using the oxygen being stored in the Fe3O4–CeZrO2 material according to the following equation: (7) C + O * → CO , where O * stands for oxygen species from the 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 material. Traces of CO and CO2 were quantified by MS. At complete conversion of oxygen no CO and CO2 traces were detected, because no free oxygen was available for carbon oxidation. But as long as the oxygen conversion was restricted to values lower than 60%, the experiments proved that carbon being formed on the solid surface can be removed with the help of oxygen being stored in the Fe3O4–CeZrO2 material. Thus, there are two ways to suppress carbon formation: (1) by changing the process conditions such that a lower degree of oxygen conversion is attained, and/or (2) by developing carbon-resistant materials. The overall efficiency of the CWGS process can be defined in terms of reaction rate (activity) and lifetime (stability) of the oxygen storage material. For the possible commercialization of this process, the material deactivation will be the most important aspect. A systematic investigation of the factors influencing the material lifetime can be found in a companion publication [23]. In general, iron oxides deactivate fast due to the material sintering during repeated reduction and re-oxidation cycles. The addition of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 as promoter leads to a significantly higher initial activity as well as to a higher stability [15,19,23]. However, further improvements of the stability of the oxygen storage material have to be achieved in the future in order to operate the CWGS process on a technical scale. Finally, in the present study the CWGS reactor was combined with a fuel cell stack. Fig. 8 shows the recorded steady-state current–voltage curve for a 5-cell PEMFC stack operated at ambient temperature and pressure. The anode compartment was fed with hydrogen being produced during the re-oxidation step of the 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 material at 800 ∘ C . The cathode compartment was fed with air. The degree of oxygen conversion of 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2 by syngas (40vol% H2, 15vol% CO) was kept below X O 2 < 60 % . Concentrations of H2O and He in the produced H2 anodic feed stream were 2.2 and 10vol%, respectively. The open circuit cell voltage of the investigated systems was around U 0 = 4.5 V . A maximal current density of 54mA/cm2 in the fuel cell stack was achieved at U = 3.2 V . During the operation an electric DC power of 4.5W was generated. The fuel cell stack was operated over 10 redox cycles (overall 60min for re-oxidation steps). After the experiments with the CWGS reactor, the fuel cell stack was tested at reference conditions with pure humidified hydrogen feed. No degradation of the power generation ability of the stack were observed."
7,Conclusions,"Fuel processing represents a very important aspect of fuel cell technology. The widespread utilization of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) will be possible if CO-free hydrogen producing technologies are available. The experiments presented in this work confirm the feasibility of the here proposed cyclic water gas shift (CWGS) reactor being based on iron redox cycling. This reactor offers a high flexibility in terms of syngas mixtures which can be converted into highly pure hydrogen. The CWGS reactor can be combined with any reformer which yields syngas of a certain H2/CO-ratio which depends on the type of feedstock being used in reforming (hydrocarbons, alcohols and biomass). The CWGS was successfully coupled with a lab-scale 5-cell PEMFC stack. For the operation of a 1kW PEMFC stack, we will now work toward the realization of a pilot-scale CWGS process. There, further technical tasks will be an efficient heat management for balancing the endothermic reduction step against the exothermic re-oxidation of 30wt%-Fe3O4–CeZrO2, a further improvement of the stability of the oxygen storage material by doping of certain components, and the further increase of the volume-specific oxygen storage capacity in order to keep the reactor size as small as possible."
