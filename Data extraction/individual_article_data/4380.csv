0,Introduction,"Epoxy resins have been extensively used to bond parts in electronic devices and machinery [1,2]. Recently, owing to the miniaturization, integration, and weight-reduction of products, the resin has been required to dissipate the generated heat in such structures to ensure good performance, lifetime, and reliability [3–6]. However, the low thermal conductivity (∼0.2 W/m·K) of the polymer cannot meet the performance criteria [7]. Therefore, it is required to develop thermally conductive polymer-based composites containing high-performance thermal conductors such as alumina, silica, silicon carbide, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, and boron nitride (BN) [8–13]. Among them, the hexagonal BN used as a filler has superior properties including a high thermal conductivity (150–225 W/m·K at 300 K) and thermal and chemical stabilities, owing to its unique crystal structure (layered structure similar to that of graphite, but with a reduced electron delocalization) [14–17]. However, the hydrophobicity of BN hinders its dispersion in a polymer matrix and limits the loading amount in the hydrophilic epoxy matrix, which restricts the heat dissipation [18]. Therefore, it is very important to improve the interaction of BN with a polar substance. The most popular process for this purpose utilizes the covalent bonding to modify the BN surface. Kim et al. reported a BN–TiO2 structure with a thermal conductivity (κ) of 1.54 W/m·K at a filler loading of 20 vol%, which could be vertically oriented by an external electric field [19]. Two surface curing agents, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, were doped onto the surfaces of a hydroxyl-functionalized BN using a simple sol–gel process, acting as fillers in the thermally conducting composite with a thermal conductivity of 4.11 W/m·K at 70 wt% [20]. Hou et al. reported that grafting of silane molecules onto the surfaces of BN particles improved the wettability and homogeneous dispersion of BN in the epoxy matrix with a strong interface interaction [21]. Additionally, Yu et al. presented a method to synthesize a cellulosic fiber introduced onto the BN surface modified by sodium hydroxide and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) providing a thermal conductivity of 0.682 W/m·K [22]. Muratov et al. reported that a surface treatment with a silane coupling agent of ceramic fillers was effective for a thermal conductivity enhancement in BN/polypropylene composites [23]. In the above studies, the fillers commonly required hydroxyl groups covalently bonded to the BN surface, acting as a linker for desirable chemicals. However, although the hydroxyl-functionalized BN has been extensively utilized for polymer composites, several critical problems were reported. For example, the B–N bonds may be weakened by the covalent bonding in the surface modification; in addition, byproducts such as sodium salt are difficult to completely remove [24,25]. These problems might deteriorate the intrinsic phonon transfer in BN. In addition, for the introduction of functional groups, the modification process has proceeded with a NaOH solution, plasma, and oxidation process, which were not environment-friendly and cost-effective for mass production [26–28]. Therefore, it is still challenging to develop a large-scale, cost-effective, and environment-friendly method for the surface modification of BN nanoplates. We present a simple large-scale synthesis method for preparation of a noncovalently functionalized BN using benzyl alcohol (B-BN), which is further utilized to prepare solution-processable epoxy-based adhesives with high thermal conductivities for an efficient heat dissipation. Their thermal conductivities were compared with those of other epoxy-based composites with bare BN and chemically modified BN (S-BN). Bare BN can be mixed with epoxy resin by a simple mechanical mixing; however, the maximum loading for further processing was 40 wt%, above which the mixture became too viscous to be utilized as an adhesive. At the filler concentration of 40 wt%, the thermal conductivities of the composites with bare BN and B-BN were comparable to and significantly higher than that of the S-BN composite, respectively. However, we could not further increase the concentration of bulk BN in the composite as the viscosity abruptly increased so that it was impossible to utilize it as an adhesive for heat dissipation. In addition, among the considered structures, the B-BN-based epoxy composite exhibited superior characteristics including better coefficient of linear thermal expansion and effective modulus. In the case of B-BN, we further increased its concentration in the epoxy resin up to 46 wt%, yielding a thermal conductivity of 2.11 W/m·K."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials BN (purity > 98.5%, 3M™), benzyl alcohol (99.0%, Aldrich), ethanol (99.0%, Aldrich), sodium hydroxide (99.9%, Aldrich), and epoxy resin (Stycast 1266 A/B, Loctite) were used without further purification."
3,Surface modification of BN by benzyl alcohol (B-BN),"2.2 Surface modification of BN by benzyl alcohol (B-BN) For the introduction of benzyl alcohol on the BN surface, 100 g of BN powders were dispersed into 500 mL of benzyl alcohol in a glass bottle. The solution was irradiated by a 60-Hz ultrasound (Power Sonic 405, Hwashin Tech) for 10 min. Then, it was washed three times with ethanol by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm. Finally, the benzyl-alcohol-modified BN particles were dried at 80 °C in an oven for 24 h."
4,Surface modification of BN by sodium hydroxide (S-BN),"2.3 Surface modification of BN by sodium hydroxide (S-BN) We slightly modified the synthesis process that was used in the previous study [26]; 500 mL of a 5-M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and BN powders (50 g) were added in a glass bottle. The reaction mixture was flash-heated to 120°. After the solution was stirred at 120 °C for 48 h, the product was washed 5 times with deionized water by centrifugation at 1000 rpm. Finally, the hydroxyl-group-modified BN particles were dried at 80 °C in an oven for 24 h."
5,"Fabrication of epoxy/BN, S-BN, and B-BN composites","2.4 Fabrication of epoxy/BN, S-BN, and B-BN composites First, 3.67 g of free epoxy was mixed with 1.02 g of hardener for 5 min. BN, S-BN, and B-BN powders were added to the epoxy–hardener mixture to produce composites with weights of 1.17, 2.01, and 3.13 g corresponding to the concentrations of 20, 30, and 40 wt%, respectively. After the powder addition, the mixtures were stirred with a plastic stick for 5 min. 4.5 g or 0.026 g of composite samples were put into the 10 mm × 10 mm × 30 mm polystyrene cuvette or Ø 0.4 mm aluminum dish, respectively. Curing process of all samples was done in the oven at 25 °C for 24 h. The samples in the dishes were used as they are for measuring their specific heats, while the cuvettes were removed, and the hardened samples were cut into specific sizes; 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm for measuring thermal diffusivity and density and Ø 6 mm × 25 mm for measuring coefficient of linear thermal expansion."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The functional groups in the composites were analyzed with a Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Alpha-P, Burker) at 25 °C. An ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer (S-3100, Sinco) was employed to analyze the UV–Vis absorbance in the range of 200 to 400 nm. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; S-4800, Hitachi) was employed to confirm the morphologies of the filler particles and their composites. Particle size distribution graphs were obtained using a Nanophox photon cross-correlation spectroscope, at a He–Ne laser power of 10 mW. The contact angle of a water droplet was measured using a drop shape analyzer (DSA100, Kruss). The viscosities of the composites were recorded at different shear rates in the range of 1–10 s−1 using a rheometer (MCR702, Anton Paar). The specific heats were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-214 Polyma, Netzsch) that was operated from −120 to 25 °C with a 5 °C/min heating rate. Laser flash analyzer (LFA-467 HyperFlash®, Netzsch) was used to measure the thermal diffusivities at −90, −50, −25, 0, and 25 °C. Coefficients of linear thermal expansion were obtained using a thermomechanical analyzer (TMA402 F1 Hyperion®, Netzsch) operating from −120 to 25 °C with a 5 °C/min heating rate. Analytical balance was used in conjunction with a density determination kit (MSA224S100DU Cubis®, Sartorius) for the evaluation of the density at room temperature. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using Auto tune probe-equipped Fourier-transform NMR (JNM-AL400, JEOL) at 400 MHz. DS-Ri1 camera equipped upright optical microscope (ECLIPSE 80i, Nikon) was used for the measurement of BN orientation in the epoxy matrix. Effective moduli of composites were calculated using the Oliver-Pharr analysis of load-displacement curve measured by means of Berkovich nano-indentation test (iNano Nanoindenter, nanomechanics) in continuous stiffness measurement mode [29]."
7,Results,"In order to achieve a considerable processing scale, benzyl alcohol was chosen for the surface modification of BN plates, as it could be attached by a noncovalent bonding in a simple mixing process; in addition, its toxicity and cost are relatively low [30]. As shown in Fig. 1 , its structural and chemical characteristics are favorable to provide π-stacking on the BN surface owing to the hexagonal planar ring with π-electrons [31]. Further, the sp3-hybridized carbon of the methylene group can keep the hydroxyl group toward the outside of the ring, making BN hydrophilic. In order to verify the surface modification of the BN particles, we analyzed functional groups in BN, S-BN, and B-BN using FT-IR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2 , all of the materials exhibited two characteristic peaks attributed to the in-plane B–N ring stretching (at 1350 cm−1) and out-of-plane B–N–B bending (at 762 cm−1) [32]. Differences in the spectra were observed in the magnified view in the range of 3000 to 4000 cm−1, shown in the inset, which indicate the presence of hydroxyl groups [33]. The materials can be ordered according to the increase in their transmittance intensities (inset in Fig. 2) in the following sequence: pristine BN, S-BN, B-BN. This implies that B-BN contains more introduced hydroxyl groups than the pristine BN and S-BN. When the hydroxyl group is introduced on the BN surface, a more hydrophilic character is obtained, which can be verified by comparing the contact angles reflecting the wettability with a hydrophilic liquid. Each powder was compressed into a pellet form. 10 µL of water was then dropped on the surface of each pellet to measure the contact angle of the droplet. The photograph in Fig. 3 shows the representative images of contact angles of 44.4, 38.3, and 29.8° for BN, S-BN, and B-BN, respectively. The lowest contact angle of B-BN indicates its highest wettability with water owing to the large number of deposited hydroxyl groups, which well agrees with the result obtained from the FT-IR spectra. Moreover, average contact angles of water droplets are measured to be 45.2 ± 1.2, 38.7 ± 1.4, and 30 ± 0.8°, respectively. As the sizes and shapes of the BN, S-BN, and B-BN plates in the SEM images in Fig. 4 are unstructured, it is difficult to identify the morphology changes of the particles after the modification process. Therefore, a particle size analyzer was used to accurately measure the sizes of the plates. The average sizes of the BN and S-BN particles are 8.71 and 8.69 μm, respectively, estimated from the values of d 50 in Fig. 5 . However, in the case of B-BN, the average particle size increased to 9.83 μm, and the distribution ratio of small particles with sizes between 1 and 5 μm tended to decrease. The increase in the sizes of the B-BN particles is attributed to the introduced benzyl alcohol on the BN surface, holding the particles together; therefore, the proportion of particles with large sizes increased [34]. The particle size can also be determined by the Scherrer equation using the full width at half maximum in the XRD pattern [35]. The sizes in the (0 0 2) crystal direction for BN, S-BN, and B-BN are 353, 358, and 431 Å, respectively, showing that only the B-BN size increased owing to the π-stacking deposition of benzyl alcohol, as mentioned above. The surface modification procedures did not affect the hexagonal crystal phase of the BN plates; the XRD patterns of all the plates are well matched with reference data (JCPDS card No. 34-0421). Fig. 6 shows UV–Vis spectra of benzyl alcohol, BN, and B-BN. Benzyl alcohol has specific UV absorption wavelengths, 216 nm and 257 nm, assigned to phenyl and hydroxyl groups, respectively [36]. BN with a band gap of 6.03 eV absorbs light in the entire measurement range [37]. Two peaks at 212 and 243 nm were observed for B-BN. The blue-shift of these peaks confirms that the binding type between BN and benzyl alcohol is the π-stacking, driven by the strong electron transfer between BN and benzyl alcohol [38]. Therefore, the size and functional group-sensitive measurements demonstrate that benzyl alcohol was effectively introduced onto the BN surface through π-stacking and retained more hydroxyl groups. The particle surface state is an important factor which determines the mixture quality with the epoxy and can provide a better flowability of the epoxy-based composite, which can be confirmed by the change in viscosity. We mixed the epoxy resin (Stycast 1266 A/B) with each plate filler (40 wt%), and then measured the viscosities at shear rates in the range of 1–10 s−1. In Fig. 7 , the composite fluids exhibit the typical non-Newtonian behavior attributed to the high viscosities [39]. The viscosity of the free epoxy resin is 678 cP at a shear rate of 1 s−1, whereas the composites exhibit higher viscosities (owing to the inorganic fillers) of 371,300 (BN), 323,250 (S-BN), and 267,710 cP (B-BN). B-BN has the lowest viscosity at all of the shear rates. As expected, a higher hydrophilicity leads to a lower viscosity. However, the composite with S-BN has a higher viscosity than that of the composite with B-BN. The microstructures of the cured epoxy and composites including 40 wt% fillers are observed in the SEM images of the corresponding cross sections (Fig. 8 ). The epoxy surface is smooth; no cracks are observed in the pure epoxy. The composites contained several pores generated owing to the low miscibility and affinity between the epoxy resin and the filler. According to the increase in their pore volumes, the materials can be ordered in the following sequence: B-BN, BN, S-BN. Despite the introduction of hydroxyl groups, the composite with S-BN had the largest number of cracks. An epoxy resin is composed of an epoxy group for cross-linking and hydrophobic group enhancing the heat resistance and rigidity [40]. Therefore, the hydrophilicity improvement of the filler is not the only factor providing a good mixture with the epoxy resin. In other words, a part of the filler needs to interact with the hydrophobic group for a good dispersion in the epoxy resin. Considering the presence of bisphenol A in Stycast 1266, B-BN, modified by the π-stacking of benzyl alcohol, has a better ability for blending with the epoxy resin than those of BN with only hydrophobicity and S-BN with fewer π-electrons. Additionally, the orientation of fillers in the epoxy matrix was observed by optical microscope (OM) using different reflectance of organic epoxy and inorganic fillers. As the OM images show in Fig. 8e–h, the fillers with red arrows are randomly oriented in the epoxy matrix. Fig. 9 and Table 1 show the heat capacities (C p), thermal diffusivities (α), densities (ρ), and through-plane thermal conductivities (κ) of the free epoxy resin and its composites with the inorganic fillers. C p was slightly affected by the filler type over the full content range. However, α was noticeably affected. When the filler ratios of the BN and B-BN composites were increased from 20 to 40 wt%, their α values increased 2.2 and 2.4 times, respectively, while that of the S-BN composite increased only 2.0 times. The values of κ for the free epoxy resin and the composites were calculated from Eq. (1) using the measurement results of C p, α, and ρ [41]: (1) κ = C p × α × ρ Fig. 9c shows that κ of the pure epoxy resin is 0.22 W/m∙K at 25 °C, while that of the BN, S-BN, and B-BN composites increased to 0.62, 0.58, and 0.62 W/m∙K, respectively, when the content of the filler increased to 20 wt%. The value of κ of the B-BN composite is similar to that of the BN composite, while that of the S-BN composite is relatively low. This tendency is explicitly shown by increasing the content of the filler to 40 wt%. At the content of 40 wt%, the κ values of the BN, S-BN, and B-BN composites are 1.56, 1.20, and 1.51 W/m∙K, respectively. Despite the loading of BN plates that generally have a high thermal conductivity, the composites exhibited such small κ due to thermal resistance at the epoxy/filler interface that is caused by phonon scattering at the interface between two phases with different vibrational frequencies [42]. The thermal properties of the free epoxy resin and its composites with 40 wt% fillers are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 2 as a function of the temperature in the range of −90 to 25 °C, as the employed epoxy resin, Stycast 1266, is normally used for low-temperature applications. The measured data in Fig. 10 shows that the C p values of the composites decrease with the decrease in the temperature; the values for each composite are similar in the entire measured temperature range. According to Debye’s quantized description that well explains the behavior of C p, with increasing temperature, a material needs extra energy to raise its temperature by 1 °C due to the conversion of additional heat into kinetic energy of the molecules in the material [43]. This tendency appears in as-synthesized samples. The value of α decreases with the increase in the temperature; the composites exhibit different temperature dependences. Theoretically, below Debye temperature, phonons related with α are transferred by harmonic oscillation with a molecular vibration in the material [44]. As the temperature of a material increases, the degree of mismatch between phonon frequency and the vibrational frequency of the molecule increases. Hence, the damped harmonic oscillation leads to a decreased α. The increase in κ with increasing temperature is because degree of increase in C p is greater than decrease in α, both of which affect κ (Eq. (1)). Compared with the calculated κ of the free epoxy, when the temperature decreased from 25 to −90 °C, the calculated κ values of the BN, S-BN, and B-BN composites decreased by 12, 13, and 11%, respectively. The relatively low κ of S-BN is attributed to the pores within the composite and weakened B–N bonding owing to the double-bond breaking due to the covalent OH-group bonding [45]. On the other hand, the application of benzyl alcohol for the BN surface modification led to a smaller reduction in the B–N bonding strength owing to the noncovalent bonding and smaller pore volume within the polymer composite, as shown in Fig. 8d. These factors led to similar thermal conductivities of the B-BN and BN composites. A factor that needs to be further considered is the viscosity. At the same content of 40 wt%, the viscosity of the B-BN composite is lower than that of the BN composite before the complete hardening. Therefore, we could add slightly more B-BN in the composite. A 46 wt% B-BN composite had a viscosity of 376,790 cP, similar to that of the 40 wt% BN composite. It is worth noting that the thermal conductivity of the 46 wt% B-BN composite significantly increased to 2.11 W/m·K, which is an increase of 40% compared to the value of the 40 wt% composite. This increase indicates that the B-BN filler can more likely form thermally conductive pathways within the epoxy with an analogous processability owing to the thermal percolation behavior at a specific filler content [46]. The mechanical stabilities of the epoxy resin and its composites with 40 wt% fillers in a variable environment (temperature and stress) were investigated by measuring the coefficients of linear thermal expansion (CTE, δ) and effective moduli (Fig. 11 ). The changes in length with temperature for the composites can be expressed by [47]: (2) Δ l l = δ Δ T ; δ = 1 / l ( d l / d T ) where l, dl, and dT represent the original length, change in length depending on the temperature, and change in temperature. Fig. 11a shows that the calculated δ values of the epoxy resin and 40 wt% BN, S-BN, and B-BN composites were 44.3 × 10-3, 27.4 × 10-3, 30.2 × 10-3, and 26.8 × 10-3 K−1 below −60 °C and 67.0 × 10-3, 39.8 × 10-3, 44.6 × 10-3, and 37.6 × 10-3 K−1 above −60 °C, respectively, revealing the lowest δ of the B-BN composite. The δ changes around −60 °C originated from the phase change of the polymer resin. The analyzed effective moduli in Fig. 11b indicate that the B-BN composite had the highest stiffness. The lowest strain in the B-BN composite could be attributed to the strong affinity between the polymer and benzyl alcohol (i.e., hydrogen bonding by the hydroxyl group and van der Waals attraction by π-electrons), yielding the enhanced firmness of the composite. For mass production in a related industry field, it is very important to reduce the manufacturing costs of the targeted materials. Considering the surface modification process using benzyl alcohol, we cannot chemically change the solvent. Therefore, we carried out solvent recycling to modify the BN surface. The 1H NMR spectra in Fig. 12 show the same proton signals with no impurity for the unused and 10-times used benzyl alcohol, positioned at 2.33, 4.61, and 7.36 ppm, assigned to hydroxy, methylene, and phenyl groups, respectively. The B-BN powder obtained at each recycling cycle was mixed with the epoxy resin at a filling concentration of 40 wt%, and then its κ was measured at 25 °C. As shown in Fig. 12c, the average κ of the composites is approximately 1.54 ± 0.01 W/m∙K, which shows that the solvent recycling does not deteriorate the κ values of the composites, which could reduce the manufacturing cost."
8,Conclusions,"We demonstrated a sonochemically driven synthesis of noncovalently modified BN. Benzyl alcohol was deposited on the BN surface through π-electron sharing. The large numbers of hydroxyl groups as well as π-electrons of B-BN could provide the functional sites for hydrogen bonding and van der Waals attraction with the epoxy resin, leading to the higher affinity between the polymer and filler. Consequently, owing to the smaller deterioration in the intrinsic phonon transfer of the free BN, the polymer composite including 40 wt% B-BN exhibited κ of 1.51 W/m∙K at 25 °C, which was 1.26 times higher than that of the S-BN composite obtained by the conventional method and comparable to that of BN. At a processability similar to that of the BN composite, a larger amount of B-BN could be added (up to 46 wt%) in the epoxy resin, leading to the significant increase in κ to 2.11 W/m·K. The strong affinity in the B-BN composite led to the lowest CTE and highest effective modulus among those of the considered materials. Furthermore, during the solvent recycling (10 times), the B-BN composite maintained the initial κ value. Therefore, we expect that this filler material can not only be used as the alternative filler for the conventional NaOH modified-BN but can also be used individually for the heat dissipation in a polymer composite."
