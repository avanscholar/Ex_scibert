0,Introduction,"At the beginning of the 21st century, mankind faces the inevitable depletion in global strategic petroleum reserves on earth, as fossil fuels are not renewable. The increase in prices of petroleum based fuels and environmental pollution issues have encouraged research into the development of biofuel technology to produce energy from sustainable resources [1]. Thus, it is urgent to look for alternative energy sources and fuels that are sustainable and environmentally safe [2–6]. Biodiesel, hydrogen and methane are considered to be the energy of the longer term since they are alternative energy sources with high energy content. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that has received a substantial attention in recent years as a result of its degradable, non-toxic and low CO2 emission [7]. The first generation of biodiesel production was depends up on vegetables oil. By 2050 the world population should reached more than 9 billions of persons which resulted in increase energy demand from 60 to 160%. This demand of biodiesel production will compete with edible oil which causes increasing in food price. Therefore, fungal lipids can represent a valuable alternative feedstock for biodiesel production, and a potential solution for a bio-based economy [8]. Fungi that produce more than 20% (g g−1) biomass lipid are referred to as oleaginous microbes [9]. Filamentous fungi hold promise as oil sources for biodiesel production as a result of they can fairly rapidly (within 96–130 h) accumulate biomass and substantial amounts of lipids, dominated by triglycerides. Fungi of the order Mucorales fulfill all requirements for being employed as core catalysts in biorefineries, and are considered as potential producers of single cell oils [10], Cunninghamella echinulata belongs to the order Mucorales within class Zygomycetes. Mucoralean fungi are best known as saprophytes which favor simple sugars as opposed to more complex molecules. Organisms belonging to Mucorales have a growth strategy characterized by short generation times, rapid absorption of sugars, and type of fatty acid profile obtained. Hydrogen production through dark or photofermentative conversion of organic substrates is of great interest due to its dual function of the major portion of municipal refuse reduction and clean energy generation, thereby acting as a promising option for biohydrogen production [11–13]. Anaerobic bacteria capable of hydrogen production can use various sources of renewable biomass and numerous agriculture, municipal and food processing waste and wastewater sources [14–16]. Biogas as a sort of biofuel, comprises primarily methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), moisture and siloxanes. It may be used as a fuel in any country for any heating purpose. Biogas could also be compressed, very similar to natural gas. Biogas holds a good vary of applications, it may be used as a replacement of fossil fuels in generation of power and heat, and it also can be upgraded to vaporous vehicle fuel [17]. Biogas is formed by different groups of facultative and obligatory anaerobic microorganisms. The main steps of the biogas production are hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis [18–20]. The biosynthesis of lipid by oleaginous fungi was associated with the formation of volatile fatty acids as metabolic products [21]. These acids resulted in a sharp decrease in culture pH and therefore inhibited the fungal growth [22]. But, it is somewhat difficult to achieve the full utilization of molasses sugar to lipid by fungal fermentation. This appears to be one amongst the most important obstacles in the molasses fermentation process for lipid biosynthesis. To avoid this drawback, the system outlined in the present paper takes into consideration the non-utilizable sugar and volatile fatty acids produced therein (spent medium). Combining fermentative C. echinulata with strictly anaerobic bacteria for hydrogen (Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824) and methane (methanogenic bacteria) production could provide an integrated system for maximizing the biofuel yield from sugarcane molasses. In such a system, the fermentation of spent medium containing residual sugar and organic acids generated by fungi, which are then converted into hydrogen by Clostridium in the second stage. This stage mainly involves fermentative production of hydrogen from residual sugars and formation of volatile fatty acids and ethyl alcohol during acidogenesis and is actually the precursor to methanogenic bacteria for methane production in a complementary third stage. The current study aimed to maximize the production of cost-competitive biofuel from sugarcane molasses by medium recycling through sequential three-stage fermentation. This system adopted C echinulata as a potent lipid producer for generation of biodiesel from sugarcane molasses and to investigate the influence of some nutritional and environmental factors on total lipid yield. The objective was extended to reuse the spent medium of C. echinulata fermentation containing residual sugars and some organic acids for hydrogen production by the strictly anaerobic C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The spent medium of hydrogen fermentation containing volatile fatty acids and ethyl alcohol was also reused by methanogenic bacteria during third stage for methane production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Fungal isolates and inoculums preparation,"2.1 Fungal isolates and inoculums preparation Six fungal isolates belonging to the order Mucorales isolated from various sources in Upper Egypt and maintained in PDA (potato dextrose agar) at 4 °C were used in this study. A spore suspension was used for inoculation of the flask cultures. To obtain spores, PDA agar plates were plated out with fungal spores and incubated for 6 days at 25 °C ± 1 °C. After growth, fungal hyphae were collected by scraping from the surface of the PDA plates and blended in sterilized distilled water. One ml of the homogenous solution of spore suspension was used for inoculation. Identification of fungal isolates was carried out based on the morphological features using the keys of Domsch et al. [23] and Zycha [24]."
3,Culture medium and cultivation method,"2.2 Culture medium and cultivation method The flask culture medium contained (g l−1) sugarcane molasses, 56.7; and peptone bacteriological (Oxoid), 10; and chloramphenicol 0.25. Sugar cane molasses was obtained from Sugar Institute Technology, Assiut University, Assiut and kept in refrigerator until used. Some physical and chemical characters of sugarcane molasses were described previously [8]. The initial pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 6.8. After sterilization the medium was inoculated with the spore suspension at a final concentration of 1 × 106 spores ml−1. Flask cultures of fungal isolates were carried out in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 25 ml of sterilized medium on a rotary shaker (Environ 3597-1, Labline Instruments, USA) at 120 rpm at 30 °C for 10 days. Each experiment was conducted with three replicates."
4,Screening for oleaginous fungi,"2.3 Screening for oleaginous fungi Six fungal isolates were grown in submerged culture as described above, after 10 days mycelial mats were collected and filtered by filter paper (Whatman No. 1) and dried at 50 °C up to constant weight. Lipids were extracted and determined colorimetrically (Unico S2100-UV spectrophotometer, USA) using kits of DIAMOND Diagnostics, Egypt."
5,Effect of some nutritional and environmental factors on total lipid yield by C. echinulata,"2.4 Effect of some nutritional and environmental factors on total lipid yield by C. echinulata C. echinulata was recorded as a high lipid producer oleaginous fungal isolate and was selected for further studies. 2.4.1 Culture conditions C. echinulata was grown in submerged culture medium contained (g l−1) sugarcane molasses, 56.7; and peptone bacteriological (Oxoid), 10; and chloramphenicol 0.25. The initial pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 6.8. After sterilization the medium was inoculated with the spore suspension at a final concentration of 1 × 106 spores ml−1. Flask cultures of fungal isolates were carried out in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 25 ml of sterilized medium on a rotary shaker (Environ 3597-1, Labline Instruments, USA) at 120 rpm for 10 days. Each treatment was conducted with three replicates. 2.4.2 Effect of incubation temperature C. echinulata was grown in submerged culture medium as described above at different incubation temperatures (10, 20, 25 30, 35, 40 and 45 °C) for the production of lipids by the tested isolate. 2.4.3 Effect of different hydrogen ion concentrations The tested fungus was grown in submerged culture medium as described above at different pH values (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) for lipid accumulation at the optimum temperature (30 °C). 2.4.4 Effect of different carbon sources Five different carbon sources namely, glucose, sucrose, fructose, molasses and starch were tested for their abilities to influence the production of lipids by the tested isolate grown in submerged culture medium as described above at optimum temperature (30 °C) and pH value (7). Each carbon source was added individually as the sole carbon source equivalent to 50 g l−1 glucose. 2.4.5 Effect of different nitrogen sources Five different nitrogen sources (NH4NO3, (NH4)2SO4, NaNO3, Peptone and Yeast extract) were tested for their suitability for lipid production. The different nitrogen sources were added by weight equivalent to 4 g l−1 NaNO3. The tested fungus was grown in submerged culture medium as described above at optimum temperature (30 °C), pH value (7) and carbon source (molasses 79 g l−1)."
6,Microscopic examinations,"2.5 Microscopic examinations Morphological characteristics of C. echinulata were studied using light and electron microscope techniques. Free-hand sections of fresh fungal mycelia and the lipid droplets in the hyphae were examined using an Olympus CX 41 microscope equipped with a digital camera (S30 Olympus Digital Camera, Japan). 2.5.1 Scanning and transmission electron microscope electron microscopy The fungal morphology and lipid accumulation were visualized by scanning and transmission electron microscope. The sample preparation and fixation were performed as described by Abd-Alla et al. [25,26]."
7,First stage: biodiesel production from Cunninghamella biomass,"2.6 First stage: biodiesel production from Cunninghamella biomass C. echinulata was selected as the organism for biodiesel production and was grown in sterilized liquid medium under optimized conditions. After 15 days mycelial mats were collected and filtered using filter paper (Whatman No. 1). Biodiesel was produced by direct acid esterification of the dry biomass as described by Vicente et al. [27], with slight modification. Fugal biomass was air dried at 50 °C. The dry fungal biomass (0.5 g) was suspended in 20 ml of mixture A (methanol 2: Chloroform 1: conc HCl 1) and left overnight at 40 °C with shaking at 120 rpm. The produced fatty acids methyl esters (Biodiesel) were extracted by n-hexane and analyzed using GC/MS in the Analytical Chemistry Unit, Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Assiut University. 2.6.1 Evaluation of biodiesel properties of C. echinulata fatty acid methyl esters Some physicochemical fuel properties e.g. density, kinematic viscosity, SN (saponification number), IV (iodine value), HHV (higher heating value), CN (Cetane Number), TAN (total acid number) and FFA (free fatty acid) were determined for the transesterified lipids of C. echinulata. Density values were calculated by mathematical model using Equation (1) based on Kay's mixing rule [28]. The density of liquid is defined as its mass per unit volume. The density database of individual pure fatty acid methyl ester compounds [29] was used for calculations. (1) ρ = Σ ( c i ρ i ) where c i is the concentration (mass fraction) and ρi is the density of component (individual fatty acid methyl ester) present in biodiesel. Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a fluid which is being deformed by either shear or tensile stress. For the case of liquid fuels, the less viscous the fluid is, the greater its ease of movement (fluidity). Kinematic viscosity values (40 °C; mm2 s−1) were calculated using Equation (2), a modified Grunberg–Nissan equation for biodiesel [30] (2) ν mix = Σ A c × ν c where ν mix = the kinematic viscosity of the biodiesel sample (mixture of fatty acid alkyl esters), Ac = the relative amount (%/100) of the individual neat ester in the mixture (as determined by, GC/Ms) and νc = obtained from the kinematic viscosity database of individual FAME (Fatty acid methyl ester) present in biodiesel [30]. IV (Iodine value), SN (saponification number) and HHV (higher heating value) are three important chemical properties of biodiesel attributed to the fatty acid profile. The IV (iodine value) is a parameter used to determine the degree of unsaturation in biodiesel and is often used in connection with its oxidative stability. The SN indicates the amount of TAG (triacyl glycerides) present in total lipid and HHV is calculated from both IV and SN. SN and IV were calculated mathematically from fatty acid methyl ester composition obtained from GC/MS analysis. SN and IV were calculated empirically from FAME composition, with the help of Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively: (3) SN = Σ ( 560 × A i ) /MW i (4) IV = Σ ( 254 × D × A i ) /MW i where, Ai is the percentage, D is the number of double bonds and MW i is the molecular mass of each fatty acid methyl ester [31,32]. The HHV (higher heating value) also known as gross heat of combustion or heat content of an oil or biodiesel depends on the SN and IV of that fuel and therefore, for calculation of HHV (expressed as MJ kg−1), Eq. (5) has been used [33]. (5) HHV = 49 . 43 − [ 0 . 041 ( SN ) + 0 . 015 ( IV ) ] CN (Cetane number) representing the ignitability of the fuel, was calculated using the multiple linear regression equation Eq. (6) [34]: (6) CN = 1 . 068 Σ ( CN i W i ) − 6 . 747 where CN i represent reported CN of pure fatty acid methyl esters available in database [34] and Wi is the mass fraction of individual fatty ester component detected and quantified by GC/MS."
8,Second stage: hydrogen production from spent medium by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824,"2.7 Second stage: hydrogen production from spent medium by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 Subsequent to fungal cultivation on molasses the cultures were filtered by filter paper (Whatman No. 1) and the fungal biomass was used for biodiesel production while spent medium was used for hydrogen production by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. 2.7.1 Preparation of C. acetobutylicum seed inoculums C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was a generous gift from Prof Dr. George Bennett, Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. Cells were grown anaerobically on glucose (1 g l−1) in a defined medium (pH, 6.2) containing (g l−1): NH4Cl, 0.2; KH2PO4, 1.8; K2HPO4, 2.40; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1; FeCl3, 0.02; CaCl2, 0.01; Na2BO7.H2O, 0.011; ZnCl2, 0.015; CoCl2.6H2O, 0.01; CuCl2.2H2O, 0.015; MnCl2.4H2O, 0.01 [35]. Cells used to inoculate the fermentor were harvested during late-log growth based on optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ca. 0.2. 2.7.2 Assay of antibacterial activity of C. echinulata spent medium The agar well diffusion method as described by Mehamood et al. [36] was used. Wells of 5 mm diameter were punched into the agar medium of C. acetobutylicum and filled with 50, 100 μl of C. echinulata spent medium. Sterilized water was taken as negative control. The plates were incubated for 5–6 days at 35 ± 2 °C in anaerobic jar. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the growth of inhibition zone against C. acetobutylicum. 2.7.3 Hydrogen production from spent medium Batch experiments for H2 production by dark fermentation stages were conducted using the spent medium as the carbon and nutrient source. The pH of the spent medium was adjusted to 6.5. The fermentative H2 production experiments were conducted in 2 L MultiGen fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co. Inc, Edison, N.J., USA) containing 1950 ml of fungal spent medium. Fifty ml of pre-cultured broth (106 cell ml−1) of obligate anaerobic C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was injected into the fermentor. Fermentation temperature was controlled at 30 °C with stirring at 100 rpm. The fermentor was set in the dark and the evolved H2 was collected and measured by displacement of 2 M NaOH which was used to absorb CO2 [37]. The cumulative hydrogen (ml l−1 spent medium) was calculated at different intervals using a measuring cylinder at outlet of the aspirator bottles collected displaced water at atmospheric temperatures and pressure. The hydrogen production rate (ml l−1 hr−1) was calculated as the maximum cumulative hydrogen (ml l−1) divided by the fermentation time (hr). 2.7.4 Measurement of hydrogen gas All gas volumes are reported at 1 atm and 25 °C. The evolved H2 gas was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Thermo Scientific TRACE GC Ultra) equipped with a TCD (Thermal Conductivity Detector) and a Stainless steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A (80/100 mesh) 2 m × 1/8 inch × 2.1 mm and HayeSepQ (80/100 mesh) 4 m × 1/8 inch × 2.1 mm. The temperature at the column was initially 50 °C and was increased to 200 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min."
9,Third stage: methane production by bacterial sludge,"2.8 Third stage: methane production by bacterial sludge Subsequent to C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 cultivation on the spent medium for hydrogen production, methanogenic bacteria was used for methane production. After 50 h of anaerobic fermentation hydrogen production ceases, and the spent medium containing volatile fatty acids and ethyl alcohol was inoculated with methanogenic bacteria. 2.8.1 Preparation of methanogenic bacterial seed inoculums For preparation of methanogenic bacterial seed inoculums, about 1 g of camel dung sample was inoculated in a 100 ml bottle containing 90 ml of autoclaved basal medium. The basal medium contained (mg l−1): FeSO4. H2O, 0.5; MgSO4.7H2O, 800; KH2PO4, 500; K2HPO4, 500; KCl, 50; CaCl2. 7H2O, 50; NaCl, 900; NH4Cl, 1000; MnSO4. 7H2O, 0.6; ZnSO4. 7H2O, 0.1; CuSO4. 5H2O, 0.02; KAl(SO4)2. 12H2O, 0.0002; H3BO3, 0.007; CoSO4. 7H2O, 0.004; Na2MoO4. 2H2O, 0.5; Na2SeO3. 5H2O, 0.003; Na2WO4 × 2H2O, 0.004; Nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.15; sodium acetate, 1000; trypticase, 2000; yeast extract, 2000; l-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, 500. Bottles were flushed with a gas mixture comprising 80% N2 and 20% CO2, to secure anaerobic conditions. The following compounds were prepared and autoclaved anaerobically under N2 and aseptically added to the medium to a final concentration of 2% (v v−1): NaHCO3, 10%; Na2S, 2%; methanol, 4 M; sodium formate, 8 M; and vitamin solution sterilized by filter (Sartorius Stedim, Ministar® 16,555, pore size 0.45 μm) [38]. All of the solutions were prepared in anaerobic water, with N2/CO2 flushing to replace the oxygen [39]. pH was adjusted to 7.8 with 10 M KOH. The culture was incubated at 37 °C using a gas mixture of 80% H2 + 20% CO2 required for the growth of methanogenic archaea [40]. 2.8.2 Methane production from spent medium Methanogenic bacterium was inoculated in 2 L MultiGen fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co. Inc, Edison, N.J., USA) containing 1950 ml of clostridial spent medium and 50 ml methanogenic bacteria was injected into the fermentor and the intial pH of fermentation medium was adjusted to 7.8. The reactors were flushed with a gas mixture comprising 80% N2 and 20% CO2, to secure anaerobic conditions, and incubated at 37 °C. The fermentor was set in the dark and the evolved CH4 was collected and measured by water displacement aspirator bottles filled with 5% NaOH to scrub CO2 [41]. The cumulative methane (ml l−1 spent medium) was calculated at different intervals using a measuring cylinder at outlet of the aspirator bottles collected displaced water at atmospheric temperatures and pressure. The methane production rate (ml l−1 hr−1) was calculated as the maximum cumulative methane (ml l−1) divided by the fermentation time (hr)."
10,Calculation of total energy content,"2.9 Calculation of total energy content Total energy content of biodiesel was calculated based on most common fatty acid (palmitate) as average value. Combustion energetics can be estimated from the bond energies for palmitate methyl ester, hydrogen and methane as following Equations (7)–(9). (7) C 17 H 34 O 2 + 24 1 / 2 O 2 → 17 H 2 O + 17 CO 2 + ( 9520 KJ mol − 1 ) ΔH = ΣBE (bonds broken) − ΣBE (bonds formed) where, BE is the bond energies ΔH = ΣBE (bonds broken) − ΣBE (bonds formed) where, BE is the bond energies ΔH = (21,183 + 12,103) − (27,166 + 15,640) ΔH = (33,286 − 42,806) ΔH = −9520 KJ (8) 2 H 2 ( g ) + O 2 ( g ) → 2 H 2 O ( l ) + ( 241 KJ mol − 1 ) ΔH = (864 + 494) − (1840) ΔH = (1358 − 1840) ΔH = −482 KJ = −241 kJ mol−1 (9) CH 4 + 2 O 2 → 2 H 2 O + CO 2 ( 810 KJ mol − 1 ) ΔH = (1640 + 988) − (1598 + 1840) ΔH = −810 KJ where, ΔH is the enthalpy of reaction that defined as the difference of all the energy absorbed in bond-breaking and all the energy released in bond-making. The negative value of the enthalpy of reaction indicates that the reaction is a heat producing or exothermic."
11,Analytical assessment,"2.10 Analytical assessment Total lipids were extracted as described by Folch et al. [42] and determined colorimetrically using kits of DIAMOND Diagnostics, Egypt. Protein concentration of molasses was determined by CBB G-250 dye binding method as described by Bradford using BSA (bovine serum albumin) as a standard protein [43]. Total sugars were determined by anthrone-sulfuric method [44]. Sodium and potassium were determined by flame photometer method [45]. Calcium and magnesium were assayed by the versene titration method [46]. Phosphorus was determined colorimetrically by ELITech phosphorus kit (305 Allées de Craponne 13300 Salon-de-Provence France). The produced fatty acid methyl esters (Biodiesel) were extracted by n-hexane and analyzed using GC/MS, Agilent Model 6890N/5975B [Column DB 5 ms, Agilent form (30, 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm)] in the Analytical Chemistry Unit, Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Assiut University. Total organic acid content of spent media was determined by GS/MS. The evolved H2 gas was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Thermo Scientific TRACE GC Ultra) as described by Abd-Alla et al. [3]. Methane was measured by gas chromatograph (Thermo Scientific TRACE GC Ultra, (Rodano, Milan, Italy)) equipped with flame ionization detector and Capillary column CP-PoraBOND U fused silica plot (25 m × 0.32 mm, df = 7 μm). High purity of N2 was used as the carrier gas at flow rate 1 ml min−1 at 250 °C. The detector, injector and column temperatures were 250, 150 and 37 °C, respectively."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Lipid accumulation by oleaginous fungi,"3.1 Lipid accumulation by oleaginous fungi Exploration of inexpensive culture media and low-cost fermentation system could lower the cost of microbial lipids production [47]. Sugarcane molasses is residual of sugary industry often used in microbial fermentation due to the presence of high fermentative sugar content. Out of six fungal isolates, 3 isolates were found to be oleaginous (containing more than 20% lipids per dry mass) as shown in Table 1 . C. echinulata was the highest lipid containing fungal isolate (56.21% lipids per dry mass) followed by Mucor circinellioides (28.3% lipids per dry mass) and Rhizopus stolonifer (23.72% lipids per dry mass). Oleaginous microorganisms in general can play a significant role in lowering the cost of oils because they can accumulate remarkable amounts of lipids within a short period of time and grow very well on a variety of inexpensive materials and wastes, such as nutritional residues from agro-industrial wastes [48]. The results presented herein, indicate that C. echinulata was a highly promising isolate for biodiesel production from sugarcane molasses, recording the highest yield for biodiesel production (7.2 g l−1). Several scientists reported growth of Mucoralean fungi in different cheap carbon sources including agro-industrial residues for lipid production. It was reported that, C. echinulata grown in a mineral medium containing glucose as carbon and energy source have ability to accumulate up to 46.6% cellular lipid with a GLA (γ-linolenic acid) content of 14.1% [49]. C. echinulata was photographed using scanning electron microscope technique showing coenocytic sporangiophore terminating in fertile vesicle bearing pedicellate, unispored sporangiola that covered with calcium oxalate spines as shown in Fig. 1 . The maximum lipid production from sugarcane molasses by C. echinulata in this study is quite good when compared with values using other substrates reported in literature (Table 2 ). C. echinulata was recorded as a high lipid producer oleaginous fungal isolate and was selected for further studies."
14,Effect of some nutritional and environmental factors on lipid production by C. echinulata,"3.2 Effect of some nutritional and environmental factors on lipid production by C. echinulata The effect of culture temperature on lipid production by C. echinulata was investigated at varying temperature (10–50 °C). The results demonstrated that lipid content accumulation increased dramatically with an increase in culture temperature over the range of 10–30 °C. However, above 30 °C, there was significant decline in the lipid synthesis. Therefore, the optimum culture temperature for lipid accumulation was at 30 °C (Fig. 2 ). C. echinulata was incubated at varying initial pH (2–9). The results plotted in Fig. 3 indicated that the lipid yield increased as the initial pH value changed from 3 to 7 and when the initial pH was over 7, the lipid yield dropped to the minimal level at 9. These results suggest that initial pH had a promotive effect on lipid accumulation and the optimal initial pH value was 7. The effect of nitrogen sources on lipid accumulation was investigated by supplementing the culture medium with organic nitrogen sources (peptone and yeast extract), or inorganic sources (NaNO3, NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4). The results of the current study indicated that C. echinulata can exploit all the nitrogen sources but the biomass concentrations and total lipid content showed great differences. Among tested nitrogen sources, peptone was the best substrate with the maximum biomass concentration (4.46 g l−1) and highest total lipid content (48.99%). ammonium nitrate followed by yeast extract were also acceptable nitrogen sources which exhibited lower biomass concentration (3.4 g l−1/3.97 g l−1) and total lipid content (41.55%/40.82%), respectively. Further, ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrate resulted in poor total lipid content (33.89%/28.73%) and biomass concentration (3.57 g l−1/3.43 g l−1), respectively (Fig. 4 ). This could be attributed to poor utilization of peptone which results in N-starvation of fungal cells which induced a higher total lipid content of hyphae. It was found that in organic peptone the cells grew more quickly and reached a higher lipid yield. It is reasonable that peptone was chosen as nitrogen source in following experiments (Fig. 4). The effect of peptone concentration on fungal biomass and total lipid content was studied (Fig. 5 ). When the peptone concentration increased from 0 to 4 g l−1, the lipid accumulation sharply increased from 50% to 75 %, while further increase of peptone to 9 g l−1 led to a significant decline in lipid accumulation (50%). Huang et al. [55] reported that inorganic nitrogen sources were good for cell growth but not suitable for lipid accumulation, while organic nitrogen sources were good for oil production but not suitable for cell growth. For cellular growth and lipid accumulation, microorganisms must find in its environment all the required nutrients. Factors such as carbon source, nitrogen source, carbon concentration and nitrogen concentration have significant influence on cell growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous microorganisms [56]. The effect of carbon sources on lipid accumulation was studied. The maximum total lipid content of 52.2% occurred when molasses was utilized as the carbon source, but the dry weight biomass was 5.6 g l−1 sucrose followed by glucose were also suitable carbon sources which generated lower biomass (3.6 g l−1/3.3 g l−1) and total lipid content (40.78%/38.74%), respectively. It was noted that starch and fructose were less utilizable carbon sources. Therefore, molasses was chosen as carbon source in following experiments (Fig. 6 ). Also, the effect of initial molasses concentrations on lipid accumulation was investigated. The results revealed that lipid content increased with an increase in initial molasses concentration up to a certain concentration, as higher levels of molasses could not increase the lipid production (Fig. 7 ). When the molasses concentration increased from 11.5 to 79 g l−1, the biomass sharply increased from 4.1 to 8 g l−1, while further increase of glucose to 100 g l−l led to the decrease of cell concentration. This indicated that excessively high or low glucose in the medium had inhibitory effect on the fungal growth and lipid content. The morphology of C. echinulata was affected by the carbon nitrogen ratio and changed from narrow filamentous hyphae (low C/N 2.26) to enlarged and swollen hyphae (high C/N 12.82). The swollen mycelia form torulose hyphae (swollen and constricted at intervals) were accompanied by increasing the oil droplets either in numbers or size within hyphae (Fig. 8 ). Lipid droplets can be easily observed in mycelium of C. echinulata and highlighted by light and transmission electron microscopy. Abundant lipid droplets were detected in hyphae of C. echinulata grown in high concentrations of molasses as compared to low concentrations (Fig. 8 and Table 3 )."
15,Biodiesel production from C. echinulata biomass,"3.3 Biodiesel production from C. echinulata biomass The fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) generated from the direct esterification of C. echinulata dry mass were analyzed by GC/MS (Table 4 ) in order to ascertain and compare their potential as biodiesel feedstock. Mass spectra revealed that methyl esters of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), 7-octadecenoic (C18:1), 6,9,12-octadecatrinoic (γ-linolenic “C18:3γ, GLA”) and 8,11-Octadecadienoic (C18:2) were the major components representing 19.7%, 5.90%, 32.6%, 8.60% and 30.1% of total FAME, respectivly while oleic, pentadecanoic (C15:0), myristic (C14:0), arachidic (C20:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1) represented a minor component of biodiesel produced from C. echinulata (Table 4). These results indicate a similarity in composition and properties of biodiesel produced by all oleaginous fungi and the majority of the total lipids extracted from C. echinulata were saponifiable lipids and free fatty acids (90% of total FAMEs). These lipids are suitable for biodiesel production and C. echinulata-derived biodiesel satisfy the specifications of the current existing standards very well. It is well known that, not all lipids produced from microbial biomass are suitable for making biodiesel however, only lipids with fatty acid ester linkage (saponifiable lipids) and free fatty acids can be produced fatty acid methyl esters, which can be used as biodiesel [27,57]. Microbial oils are now believed to be promising potential feedstocks for biodiesel production due to their similar composition of fatty acids to that of vegetable oils [58]. A GC/MS analysis of the spent medium of C. echinulata showed the presence of organic acids which resulted in a sharp drop in culture pH (Table 5 ) during fungal fermentation for lipid production. It was noted that some free fatty acids were detected in the spent medium, e.g. octadecanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid (Table 5), it is difficult to convert these free fatty acids into biodiesel due to soap formation that renders biodiesel separation and purification. It was monitored that, the residual sugar at the end of lipid fermentation period was 13.38 g l−1. This indicated that sugar utilization efficiency was 51% when the culture amended with 56.4 g l−1 molasses (26.2 g l−1). The conversion ratio of molasses to lipid (lipid yield/consumed sugars) was 0.6 g g−1 which represents an important factor in the fungal biodiesel production. Based on these observations, it is somewhat difficult to achieve the complete utilization of molasses sugar to lipid through fungal fermentation. This appears to be one of the major bottlenecks in the molasses fermentation process for lipid production. The current study was extended to complete consumption of the residual sugars and organic acids in the spent medium for fermentative hydrogen production by C. acetobutylicum."
16,Biodiesel properties of the transesterified SCOs of C. echinulata,"3.4 Biodiesel properties of the transesterified SCOs of C. echinulata Physico-chemical characteristics of biodiesel were determined for C. echinulata FAMEs obtained from GC/MS spectra (Tables 4 and 6 ). Among physical characteristics of biodiesel, the density values as determined from mathematical equations were found to be 0.85 g cm−3 which is equivalent to the biodiesel standard specifications. The results of FAME density value computation revealed that, C. echinulata can be considered suitable for biodiesel production. The calculated kinematic viscosity value of 4.16 mm2 s−1 at 40 °C is in the range of the biodiesel standard specifications. The calculated IV was 101.45 and this value is below the EN 14214 standard value (120 max) and suggests good oxidative stability of C. echinulata fatty acid methyl esters. The higher heating values are measures of a fuel's heat of combustion, the calculated HHVs was 39.88 MJ kg−1. One of the most effective characteristics of the diesel fuel is the dimensionless CN (cetane number), which represents the ignitability of the fuel, particularly critical during cold starting conditions. Low cetane numbers lead to long ignition delay. For biodiesel, CN has been found to increase with an increasing weight percentage of saturated and long chain fatty ester. From GC/MS spectra methyl esters of long chain saturated fatty acids namely palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), 7-octadecenoic (C18:1), 6,9,12-octadecatrinoic (γ-linolenic “C18:3γ, GLA”) and 8,11-Octadecadienoic (C18:2) were found to be the major components. The calculated CN for C. echinulata methyl esters was found to be 55.07 (Table 6), this value is in the acceptable range of international biodiesel standard suggesting their possible suitability as a fuel. The TAN (total acid number) as determined according to EN 14214 was estimated to be 0.44 mg KOH g−1. This TAN value was much lower as compared to biodiesel from vegetable oils which lie between 0.08 and 0.62 mg KOH g−1 [59] and algal oils, (0.37 – 0.71 mg KOH g−1) [60]. FFA (Free fatty acid) content determined as per EN 14214 was found to be 1.3% of total FAME. The concentration of linolenic acid (C18:3) and mass fraction % of FAMEs having ≥ 4 double bonds also were determined. From GC/Ms spectra, the concentration of C18:3 was 8.639 of total FAME, and this value is below the specified limit of 12 max. Also, fatty esters with ≥4 double bonds were not detected in fatty acid methyl ester spectra (Tables 4 and 6)."
17,Hydrogen production from spent media by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824,"3.5 Hydrogen production from spent media by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 The fermentation of spent medium containing residual sugar and organic acids generated by C. echinulata, which are then converted into hydrogen by Clostridium in the second step in a bioreactor. It is very interesting to mention that, C. echinulata metabolites of the spent medium didn't have antibacterial activity against C. acetobutylicum and methanogenic bacterial growth. The maximum cumulative 1450 ml H2 l−1 was obtained from spent medium of C. echinulata (Fig. 9 ). The results revealed that, the hydrogen production efficiency was 0.94 mol H2 per mole glucose and the hydrogen production rate was 30.8 ml H2 l−1 h−1. This observation can be attributed to high concentration of residual sugars, hexadeconic and octadecanoic acid in spent medium that support the growth and membrane stability of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 for fermentative hydrogen production (Table 5). C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was chosen as standard isolate used in industrial production. Stoichiometrically, if butyric acid is the only byproduct of fermentative hydrogen production, maximum 2 mol of H2 can be produced from 1 mol of glucose. However, if acetic acid is the only byproduct, maximum 4 mol of H2 can be produced from 1 mol of glucose. Therefore, acetic acid producers are the preferred organisms for H2 production. C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 produce different products (butyric and acetic) heterofermentation and the amount of hydrogen generated is determined by the acetate/butyrate ratio [61]. 1 Glucose → 0 . 6 Acetate + 0 . 7 butyrate + 2 CO 2 + 2 . 7 H 2 The maximum hydrogen yield was 0.94 mol hydrogen per mole glucose that are even lower than the theoretically yield (2.7 mol of hydrogen per mole glucose). Hydrogen yield is even lower when other reduced organic compounds, such as lactic acid, propionic acid, and alcohols (Acetone, butanol and ethanol), are produced as fermentation products, because these represent end products of metabolic pathways that bypass the major hydrogen-producing reaction in carbohydrate fermentations (Table 5). It is believed that these products are produced via non-H2 generation metabolic pathways [62]. In this stage, C. acetobutylicum convert the residual sugars and organic acids of the spent medium of fungal fermentation (first stage) to volatile fatty acids, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The principal acids produced are acetic acid (CH3COOH), propionic acid (CH3CH2COOH), butyric acid (CH3CH2CH2COOH), and ethanol (C2H5OH). These acids are suitable feedstock for methane production by methanogenic bacteria."
18,Methane production from the spent medium of Clostridium fermentation by bacterial sludge,"3.6 Methane production from the spent medium of Clostridium fermentation by bacterial sludge Subsequent to biohydrogen fermentation of the spent medium, methanogenic bacteria was used for bio-methane production from the metabolite products of hydrogen fermentation such as volatile fatty acids and ethyl alcohol [63]. The highest cumulative methane yield was 1690 ml l−1 spent medium obtained after 48 h fermentation as shown in Fig. 10 and the methane production rate was 33.84 ml CH4 l−1 hr−1. In this stage the methane is produced by bacteria called methane formers (methanogens) in two ways: either by means of conversion of acetic acid molecules to generate carbon dioxide and methane, or by reduction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen. Methane production is higher from reduction of carbon dioxide but limited hydrogen concentration in the digesters results in acetate reaction as the primary producer of methane [64]. Cheng et al. [65] reported that the SMB (soluble metabolite byproducts) from the hydrogen-producing stage were reutilized by methanogens to produce methane in the second stage. Over 98 wt % of acetate and butyrate in the SMB are reutilized to give a methane yield of 216.5 ml CH4 g−1 xylose. The gross energy content (biodiesel, hydrogen and methane) of 84 g fresh molasses through three successive stages fermentation was 3928.48 kJ mol−1, and biodiesel represented 73.6% of the total energy obtained. The methane energy accounting for 20.62% of the total energy produced, and the hydrogen energy was only 5.77% of the total energy obtained (Table 7 ). Interlinking such as biodiesel production technology by C. echinulata with hydrogen and methane producing bacteria to complete utilization of the residual sugars and organic acids as well as alcohols in the spent media would increase its economic feasibility and allow it to be considered a pivotal feedstock in industrial production of bioenergy. The maximum theoretical ethanol yield (0.51 g of ethanol g−1 glucose) from sugars was calculated according to the stoichiometric relation [66] represented by following equation: C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 CO 2 Thus, the total sugars of 84 g fresh molasses were 39 g L−1 and theoretically produced 20 g ethanol. The theoretically computed energetic content of ethanol was 3025.4 kJ mol−1. It is obviously clear that the three-stage process of the current study (biodiesel, hydrogen and methane) showed higher gross energetic potential when compared with ethanol production from molasses by yeast [67]."
19,Conclusion,"The increasing global demand of clean and sustainable biofuels energy create the opportunity to investigate the full utilization of sugarcane molasses as alternative to glucose-based medium. Biofuels derived from feedstock cannot meet realistic requirement and can be only used for little fraction of demand for transport fuels. The current study aimed to maximize the production of low-cost biofuels from sugarcane molasses by medium recycling through sequential three-stage fermentation. Therefore, diversity group of microorganisms-based options have the potential to produce biofuels from sugarcane molasses and can convert almost all of sugars to biodiesel, hydrogen and methane. C. echinulata is a potent lipid producer oleaginous fungus grown on sugarcane molasses and a promising candidate for biodiesel production. Enhanced lipid content of C. echinulata have been achieved by optimization the cultivation conditions and medium components. The presence of high amounts of low degree unsaturated long chain and saturated long chain fatty acids revealed that lipid accumulation by C. echinulata is applicable for biodiesel production. Also, physico-chemical characteristics of C. echinulata-derived biodiesel met the specifications of the current existing standards very well. The spent medium from first stage of sugarcane molasses fermentation by C. echinulata was found to have the capacity for the dark-production of hydrogen by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in a combined process, the effluent of hydrogen fermentation was used as an influent for the third-stage methane production. It is obviously clear that the gross energy content of biodiesel, H2 and methane generated through three subsequent stages fermentation from 84 g molasses was 3928 kJ mol−1 that showed higher gross energetic potential when compared with theoretically computed energetic content of ethanol (3025.4 kJ mol−1) from 84 g molasses by yeast. Consequently, interlinking the biodiesel production technology by C. echinulata with fermentative hydrogen producing C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and methanogenic bacteria to complete the utilization of the residual sugars and organic acids in the spent medium would increase the economic feasibility of biofuel technology. The interesting findings of the current study have been proven to be practically important in enhancing low-cost biofuels production from molasses."
