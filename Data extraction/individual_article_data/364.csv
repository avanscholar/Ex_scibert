0,Introduction,"A great deal of research has been and is being carried out on the biological production of hydrogen as a future energy carrier. In this review, research techniques used for measuring the various relevant parameters as well as the required calculational methods along with critical values will be presented. This is the first time that these have been collected in one place. In order to provide the appropriate background and context, especially for the casual reader, a basic description of the various processes as well as some specific instructive examples are also given. Biohydrogen, a renewable, eco-friendly energy carrier, has the potential to replace fossil fuels due its high specific energy content. However, its economic feasibility is limited by low conversion efficiencies, requiring further development and optimization [1–4]. Dark fermentation has been the most studied method due to its rapid rate of hydrogen production, simple operation, lower cost, and ability to utilize a wide range of complex substrates, including lignocellulosic matter and wastewater [5,6]. On the other hand, the accumulation of volatile fatty acids causes a significant decrease in pH, which inhibits bacterial growth as well as hydrogen production and yield. An additional significant problem with dark fermentation is its incomplete substrate oxidation [7]. Ongoing research to address these challenges includes; applying sequential and combined fermentation techniques, implementing conventional and advanced process control strategies for controlling the desired output, as well as changing the operating mode of reactors from batch to continuous [8,9]. In the photofermentation method photosynthetic bacteria use light energy and nitrogenase to produce hydrogen from different organic acids, sugars, and a wide variety of industrial wastewaters [10], with the highest reported yield to date of 9 mol H2/mol glucose [11]. Light has both positive and negative aspects, allowing the utilization of otherwise unusable substrates, at however low light conversion efficiencies. The energy requirement of nitrogenase makes hydrogen production irreversible but also reduces production efficiency [12,13]. Photofermentation can be used after dark fermentation to convert the volatile fatty acid by-products to hydrogen, but effluent pre-treatment is usually required, increasing production costs [14]. Possible means to increase efficiencies include; the development of light-harvesting bacterial mutants, optimization of bioreactor configurations, and the direct utilization of sugars rather than pretreated organic acids [12]. Another alternative way to produce hydrogen renewably is by using a Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC) which differs markedly from dark and photofermentation by its requirement for electrical energy input. With MECs, unlike dark fermentation, 12 mol H2/mol glucose can theoretically be produced. In addition, MECs offer the possibility of sustainable and clean hydrogen production with the use of biomass or wastewater treatment, high hydrogen production rates, and a potential 100% conversion efficiency [13,15]. However, to date, the maximum yields reported range between 2.5 and 3.8 mol H2/mol of substrate due to the cathodic overpotentials, ohmic loses, concentration and conductivity losses, low energy efficiencies, and competing reactions [16]. Biohydrogen is being extensively investigated, with close to 5000 publications listed under this topic on the Web of Knowledge®. Various methods have been used in quantifying the different relevant parameters, and diverse metrics have been used to describe the results, making comparison between studies, or even their interpretation, difficult. While some studies have attempted to compare results between studies by converting the reported units, this is far from being universally recognized and applied. A comprehensive overview and guide where the necessary information is assembled in one place and discussed has not been available. Here, we discuss different methods of analysis, quantification, and measurement specific to biohydrogen production, include the definition of many common abbreviations used in the field, define many commonly used equations, and provide some useful conversions and reference values. We propose, wherever possible, the use of common comparable outputs having the same units as well as present possible conversions for the analysis and reporting of experimental data, allowing one set of results to be converted into the units of the other."
1,Analysis of substrate consumption and product formation,
2,Substrate consumption analysis,"2.1 Substrate consumption analysis Substrate consumption analyses in biohydrogen production have been carried out using colorimetric methods, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total organic carbon (TOC). This determination is critical of course in being able to calculate the hydrogen yield. 2.1.1 Colorimetric methods A wide variety of carbohydrates comprising mono- (glucose, fructose, galactose, etc.), disaccharides (combinations of two monosaccharides; sucrose, maltose, lactose) and polysaccharides (starch and cellulose) have been used as carbon sources whose catabolism releases protons and high energy electrons for biohydrogen production. The absence or existence (and their number) of aldehyde/carbonyl groups causes alterations in the carbohydrate's chemical properties [17]. These changes are fundamental to the formation of optically active compounds which permit the quantitative determination of the carbohydrate present. There are a number of colorimetric methods widely used for analyzing substrate concentrations; Dinitro salicylic Acid (DNS), Anthrone, Oxidase, Nelson-Somogyi, Phenol Sulfuric Acid, all of which react with reducing sugars, which in this case, as they have free aldehyde or ketone groups, function as a reducing agent. Some reducing sugars are glucose, galactose, lactose and maltose. Colorimetric methods are simple, sensitive, adjustable, and economical. In addition, a large number of samples can be dealt with at the same time. Common methods for measuring carbon content in fermentative hydrogen production are given in Table 1 . DNS reagent, consisting of 1.6% NaOH, 0.9% 3,5 dinitro salicylic acid, 28.22% potassium sodium tartrate, is used to determine reducing sugars in the medium. Analysis can be performed using either a Microplate Reader or a UV-VIS Spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 510–520 nm. The DNS procedure for a microplate reader is as follows; - 50 μL sample, 50 μL water, and 100 μL DNS reagent are placed in wells in a microplate. - Plates are heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min. - Suddenly cooled down (3 min) on ice. - Absorbance is measured at 515 nm with a microplate reader. Run a series of standards using glucose or other reducing sugar (0–1 g/L) to generate a calibration curve. 2.1.2 High pressure liquid chromatography High-pressure liquid chromatography is one of the alternative ways of analyzing substrate consumption and provides the possibility of analyzing liquid fermentation products at the same time depending on column properties. A very commonly used column for measuring organic acids and solubilized sugars is the Biorad Aminex HPX-87H column operated between 40 and 65 °C with 1–5 mM H2SO4 as a mobile base at a flow rate of 0.4–0.6 mL/min. The HPLC method is fast, accurate, reliable and simple. 2.1.3 Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) Different types of organic substrates, such as food wastes, starch, cellulose, molasses and alcohol distillery by-products, are potential sources for biohydrogen production and consumption of these organic compounds during the fermentation process has to be determined to have an idea about yield in terms of production of H2 per grams of glucose, COD, TOC or BOD. In addition, this measurement an be used to determine the consumption efficiency of the substrate. In general, the yield of H2 when using waste as a substrate is given in units of mol H2/COD or mol H2/BOD. Although in general the different measures used for determining the organic loading of wastewaters (COD, TOC, BOD) can not be exactly converted from one to the other, since they depend upon different reactions, the substrates used for biohydrogen production are rich in carbohydrates, allowing some approximate conversions to be made. For comparison purposes, COD can be compared to results obtained with pure substrates, such as glucose, by converting the pure substrate values to COD equivalents (for example, 1.067 g COD/g glucose). As well, assuming that the organic carbon has an elemental composition of CH2O, COD and TOC can be interconverted using 2.67 g COD/g TOC. In addition, BOD and COD for these types of substrates have been found to be related by BOD/COD = ~0.7–0.8. Ozyurt et al. studied hydrogen production with a dark fermentative process using starch, potato, and enriched potato as substrates. Initial COD values were measured and hydrogen yields were calculated as mL H2/g COD [29]. Lazaro et al. investigated chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in sequential two-stage biohydrogen production under non-sterile conditions using sugarcane vinasse as a substrate [30]. Zong et al. studied a two-step process of sequential anaerobic (dark) and photo-heterotrophic fermentation using cassava and food waste for biohydrogen production and COD removal [31]. A sequential process of hydrogen production was studied by Chen et al. using pure species of Clostridium pasteurianum and Rhodobacter palustris and COD removal was investigated [32]. COD measurement requires the preanalysis preparation of three reagents. First, 0.01667 M potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) digestion solution is prepared by adding to 500 mL distilled water to 4.903 g K2Cr2O7 previously dried at 150 °C for 2 h, 167 mL concentrated H2SO4, 33.3 g HgSO4, and adjusting the final volume to 1 L after dissolving and cooling to room temperature. The second reagent, sulfuric acid reagent, is prepared by the addition of Ag2SO4 to concentrated H2SO4, 10.12 g Ag2SO4 to 1L H2SO4, and waiting one or two days for the solid to completely dissolve, followed by final mixing. Third, a potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) standard is prepared for the generation of a calibration curve. Dissolve 425 mg KHP (dried to constant weight at 110 °C oven) in distilled water and dilute to 1L. The KHP solution needs to be prepared and used under sterile conditions and kept at +4 °C. KHP has a theoretical COD of 1.176 mg O2/mg and a prepared solution has a theoretical COD of 500 μg O2/mL [33]. For COD measurement, tubes and caps are first washed with 20% H2SO4 before use to eliminate any possible contamination. 2.5 mL sample and 1.5 mL K2Cr2O7 digestion solution are added to the tube followed by 3.5 mL of the sulfuric acid reagent. The tubes are tightly capped, sealed, mixed and placed in 150 °C preheated oven for 2 h. The tube is cooled to room temperature and then measured with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm [33]."
3,Product formation analysis,"2.2 Product formation analysis Many bacteria can carry out dark fermentation, fermenting carbon-based substrates under anaerobic conditions to produce products such as H2, CO2, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs); acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid and ethanol. In photo-fermentation photosynthetic non-sulphur bacteria (PNSB) have the ability to convert VFAs to H2 and CO2 under anaerobic conditions in the presence of light. Gas chromatography (GC) is used for measuring the gaseous products of CO2 and H2 in fermentative hydrogen production using a TCD (thermal conductivity detector) and columns and chromatography conditions specific for each gas. While all measurements of this depend on the same principle, published reports give various operating conditions (Table 2 ). Alternatively, as shown in investigations on biohydrogen production from rice mill wastewater, hydrogen gas production can be measured using an online monitor, H2 Scan (HY-ALERTA, USA) [36]. Another study optimized process parameters for biohydrogen production using glucose by measuring hydrogen gas using a microprocessor-based pre-calibrated electrochemical H2 sensor (ExTox Gas Detector 4–20 mA version, GmBH Inc., Germany) [37]. In fermentative hydrogen production liquid phase products such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs); acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid and ethanol are determined using Gas Chromatography (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector or High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). When analyzing volatile fatty acids in the culture broth supernatant with either GC chromatography or HPLC, the samples are centrifuged between 4000 and 15000 rpm for 2–20 min to obtain a cell-free supernatant. For analysis with GC after centrifugation, the supernatants are acidified with HCl or oxalic acid to pH 1–2. The acidification step isn't needed while analyzing liquid phase products with HPLC since 5 mM H2SO4 or 0.1% H3PO4 is the mobile-phase (0.4–1.0 mL/min flow rate). In the last step before analysis, the samples are filtered through 0.2–0.45 membranes. For HPLC analysis, a widely used column is Aminex HPX-87H (BioRad) operated at 40–66 °C with a refraction index detector. Detailed properties related to HPLC analysis can be found in Table 3 ."
4,Analysis of carbon flow and measurements in hydrogen production,
5,Calculation of electron and carbon balances,"3.1 Calculation of electron and carbon balances During anaerobic fermentative hydrogen production organic substrates are broken down to metabolites in a series of oxidation-reduction reactions with excess electrons released into the fermentation medium as fermentation by-products. Fermentation of a substrate can only proceed if the proper electron balance is maintained, therefore the production of oxidized by-products is unavoidable. Electrons are made available during this catabolic process through the reduction of electron carriers, NAD+ or ferredoxin. Hydrogen production is optimized by maximizing electron flow to hydrogen and minimizing electron allocation to cell growth or soluble end products (SEP). Therefore, the analysis of electron distribution by determination of the electron equivalent (e− eq) balance in the fermentation process can give very useful information as to the amount of electrons used in by-product formation as well as allowing the calculation of conversion efficiencies and total electron allocation, which allows one to know if all the by-products have been accounted for [43,44]. In order to calculate the electrons released for each compound, it is necessary to know the degree of reduction, defined as the number of available electron equivalents per gram atom C. The degrees of reduction for some key elements are C = 4, H = l, N = −3, 0 = −2, P = 5, and S = 6, which are equal to the valence of the elements [45,46]. For example, when 1 mol of glucose is utilized to produce1 mol of acetate, 8 electron equivalents are released. Similarly, 20 electron equivalents are used from 1 mol of glucose to produce 1 mol of butyrate. Of course, some of the released electrons are immediately used by microorganisms for new cell growth (degree of reduction 4.17), but the vast majority of the electrons are used to form soluble end products (butyrate, lactate, propionate, etc.). The relative amounts of end products depend on the inoculum and environmental conditions, initial pH, temperature, initial substrate concentration, fermentation time, and substrate/biomass ratio [43,44,46,47]. Evaluating the full stoichiometry of biohydrogen production with electron balances and their relationships provides a better understanding of the nature of the biochemical reactions of cell growth, soluble end product (SEP) formation, and ATP yield. The process for determining electron and carbon balances is as follows [48]: - Stoichiometric oxidation-reduction equations including cell growth and metabolites (byproducts) are used to balance redox reactions with a half-reaction approach (also called ion-electron) developed by Rittman and McCarty (2001) [48]. The redox equation is divided into two half-equations - one for oxidation and one for reduction. Each half-reaction is balanced separately and then combined to give the balanced redox equation. The half-reaction approach is given in Equation (1), where Ra, Rc, and Rd are the half-reactions for reduction, cell growth and oxidation, respectively, fe is the fraction of electron donor transferred to the electron acceptor, and fs is the portion of donor electrons used for cell growth. Ra is calculated from Equation (2), where eai is the electron fraction for the ith product for SEP and hydrogen in biohydrogen production, Rai is the half reaction of product i and eeq,i is the electron equivalent of product i, (1) R o v e r a l l = f e R a + f s R c − R d a n d f s + f e = 1 (2) R a = ∑ i = 1 n e a i R a i ( e a i = e e q , i − ∑ i = 1 n e e q , i − a n d ∑ i = 1 n e a , i − = 1 ) - The electron equivalent (e− eq) balances for initial and final substrate (electron donor), soluble end products (SEP), biomass and hydrogen need to be calculated according to the half-reactions in order to use them in Eq (1). For example, in dark fermentation under anaerobic conditions with Clostridium butyricum where C6H12O6 is the electron donor (24 e− eq), CH₃COO⁻, C4H7O2 − and H2 are the main electron acceptors containing 8, 20, 2 e− eq, respectively [49]. The biomass of Clostridium butyricum with the elemental composition of C4H7O2N has the e− eq of 16. In what follows, one of the electron equivalent half reactions, the oxidation of glucose is given step by step as an example: Step 1. Balance the main atoms of C6H12O6 with the known end product, CO2 C 6 H 12 O 6 → 6 C O 2 Step 2. Balance the O atoms with H2O C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 6 C O 2 Step 3. Balance the H atoms with H+ C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 6 C O 2 + 24 H + Step 4. Balance the charge with electrons C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 6 C O 2 + 24 H + + 24 e − Step 5. Divide the balanced equation with the coefficient of e- ( 1 / 24 ) C 6 H 12 O 6 + ( 1 / 4 ) H 2 O → ( 1 / 4 ) C O 2 + H + + e − The initial glucose e− eq is equal to the sum of the e− eq of residual glucose, soluble end products, hydrogen and biomass at the end of the fermentation process and can be calculated using Equation (3). Generally, electron balance is quantified using chemical oxygen demand (COD) [43,44,47]. An electron equivalent of cumulative hydrogen gas is calculated and given as an example in Equation (4) [49]. (3) e g l u c o s e , i n i t i a l − = e g l u c o s e , f i n a l − + e S E P − + e H 2 − + e b i o m a s s − (4) e H 2 − = produced H 2 ( mL ) 22.4 mL / mmol x T 0 T R x 2 mequiv of e − All electron equivalent (e− eq) and carbon balances are specific to each microorganism and its metabolic pathway while degrading different types of substrates. The metabolic pathways of microorganisms are fundamentally important for microbial growth and survival and can vary depending on the type of microorganism, substrate, and the presence/absence of oxygen. In anaerobic fermentative hydrogen production with glucose as a substrate, there are three main pathways: the pyruvate formate lyase pathway (PFL, in facultative anaerobic microorganisms), pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase pathway (PFOR, in strict anaerobic bacteria), and the excess NADH pathway at low H2 partial pressure [50–54]. A simplified glucose degradation metabolism with a mixed culture of fermentative bacteria to produce biohydrogen is given in Fig. 1 ."
6,Measurement of light intensity and efficiencies of light conversion,"3.2 Measurement of light intensity and efficiencies of light conversion Quantifying light can be confusing due to the various terms and units used, which may differ according to the purpose of the measurement. Different types of light sources with various light intensities and measurement methods have been reported in the literature [55–59]. Two basic systems are generally used to measure light intensity, photometric or radiometric. The photometric measurement (luminous intensity or illuminance) depends on the measurement of visible light (380–770 nm) as it is sensed by the human eye. The luminous intensity has the SI unit of candela (cd) or lumens/steradian (lm/sr) where the lumen is the unit of light flux (luminous power or luminous flux) and steradian is the solid angle. The illuminance (the photometric flux), the amount of light falling on a surface, has the SI unit of lux (lumen/m2). The units of candela and lux can be used to measure luminous intensity, but lux is preferable rather than candela since candela is variable as it depends upon the specific surface material, whereas lux remains constant as long as the source remains constant. Radiometric techniques measure the radiant intensity or irradiance of electromagnetic radiation over the infrared, visible and UV light spectrum. The irradiance (the radiant flux) is the radiant power per unit area of a surface, expressed as Watts•m−2. The relationship between photometric and radiometric measures are given by the CIE Standard Luminosity Function, where the photometric measure (luminous intensity), is related to the photometric measure (spectral radiant intensity) using a luminous efficiency function which incorporates the spectral sensitivity of human vision. Hopefully this exposition on definitions has clarified the measurement of light, ensuring the correct usage of terms. Table 4 gives the measurement types and quantities of light that have been used in experiments conducted on photofermentative hydrogen production. Light conversion efficiency is another useful but hard to determine parameter for evaluating the effectiveness of photofermentative hydrogen production. Basically, it can be expressed as the percentage energy output over energy input. Various parameters can affect light conversion efficiency measurements and calculations: use of incident light versus absorbed light, oversaturation of photosynthesis at high light intensities, etc. [55]. Equation (5) can be used to calculate the light conversion efficiency. Of course, incident light will give lower efficiencies since more losses are involved, but it can be argued that for practical applications this is the most relevant parameter. This is because it measures how effectively the radiation (solar energy) is used. For determination of the actual efficiencies of photosynthesis, it would be more appropriate to measure absorbed light. In one example [55], irradiance was measured using a Li 189 (Li-Car) Quantum/Radiometer/Photometer light meter, which gave units of μmol • m−2s−1 which were converted to (W •m−2). The light conversion efficiencies for the incident and absorbed light were found to be 3.2% and 16% respectively. In another study with Rhodobacter sphaeroides O.U.001 the light conversion efficiency was found to be 10% using absorbed light energy [64]. (5) E f f i c i e n c y ( E , % ) = H 2 p r o d u c t i o n r a t e ( m o l m 2 s ) x H 2 e n e r g y c o n t e n t ( J m o l ) I n c i d e n t l i g h t e n e r g y ( J m 2 s ) x 100 In another study, a very low light conversion efficiency of 0.31% was calculated for Rhodopseudomonas palustris 42OL using Equation (6), where 33.61 is the energy density of hydrogen gas (Wh/kg), ρH2 is the H2 gas density, VH2 is the volume of produced H2, I is the irradiance, A is the irradiated area of the photobioreactor and tH2 is the H2 production time. This low efficiency was due to the high light intensity (480 W • m-2) used. Light energy conversion efficiencies using Rhodobacter sphaeroides were found to be higher at low and mid-light intensities; 4.75, 6.35, and 5.77% at 3, 5, and 10 W•m−2, respectively [65]. (6) E f f i c i e n c y ( E , % ) = 33.3 ( W h k g ) ρ H 2 ( k g L ) x V H 2 ( L ) I ( W m 2 ) A ( m 2 ) t H 2 ( h ) x 100 In an alternate calculation (Equations (7) and (7)’), light conversion efficiency (LCE,%), is defined as the ratio of the total combustion enthalpy from hydrogen produced by the photobioreactor per unit time to the input light energy, where Δ H H 0 is the standard combustion enthalpy of hydrogen, −286.0 J/mmol [66]. The highest light conversion efficiency 82.5% was achieved at 590 nm wavelength at 6000 lux light intensity using LED lamps. Of course, this is hardly relevant to practical biohydrogen production since a single optimal wavelength of light was used. In a practical system receiving solar radiation the calculated LCE would be much lower. In fact, the total energy efficiency (TEE) of these systems is actually much lower since this is a photoheterotropic process and for a true total energy efficiency the energy contained in the carbon substrate, sugar or volatile fatty acid that is used for hydrogen production, should also be considered. In the study noted above this gave a TEE of 4.8%, again at the single optimal wavelength (7) L C E , % = H 2 c o m b u s t i o n e n t h a l p y ( J m m o l ) x H 2 p r o d c u t i o n r a t e ( m m o l h L ) x b i o r e a c t o r v o l u m e ( L ) I n p u t l i g h t e n e r g y o f t h e p h o t o b i o r e a c t o r p e r u n i t t i m e ( J h ) x 100 (8) L C E , % = Δ H H 0 ( J m m o l ) x H P R ( m m o l h L ) x V ( L ) I x A x t ( J h ) x 100 Due to the usage of multiple light conversion efficiency equations with different parameters with no obvious interconversion between them, it is hard to compare different studies. For example, LCEs calculated using absorbed energy cannot be compared to LCEs derived from incident light measurements since they may differ in both the specific physical characteristics of the set-up and the unique properties of the biological system. On the other hand, LCEs calculated using photometric measurements can be compared to ones made using radiometric measurements using the CIE phototropic luminosity function, although this has hardly been used in practice. The light conversion efficiency defined by Equation (5) is the most commonly used one and the one that we put forward here as best for describing processes being developed for practical hydrogen production."
7,Measurement of biomass and specific hydrogen production,"3.3 Measurement of biomass and specific hydrogen production Cell growth is the primary use for substrates and nutrients, with product formation a consequence. Typically, to achieve the maximum production of a desired compound such as hydrogen, it is important to understand the growth of microorganisms and the factors that affect it. The quantification of cell growth and viability helps to identify living or dead cell numbers that are essential in process characterization, growth kinetics, optimization, and specific hydrogen production. Typically, growth and viability measurement methods can be classified into two categories, offline and online [67]. Although offline cell quantification methods are time-consuming, they are well known, and are the most commonly used ones in biotechnological processes due to their low cost and ease of application compared to online methods. On the other hand, online measurement approaches provide more reliable results without any time delay or contamination as well as allowing direct measurement and data analysis. Direct cell counting, biomass, or light scattering methods are can be used to quantify the growth of bacteria. Cell viability can be measured using staining or molecular and physiochemical parameters. Direct cell counting methods are based on the detection of the number of cells in the liquid medium and can consist of offline methods, such as microscopic/electronic enumeration (counting cells), or online methods such as Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Although the direct cell counting method (electronic enumeration) is useful for yeast, it is hard to use on bacterial cells due to their small size and shape [67,68]. In a study to enhance hydrogen production, an engineered R. capsulatus strain was used to generate a fluorescent signal while producing hydrogen from nitrogenase. NifH mutagenesis and FACS were used to select hydrogen overproducing nitrogenase mutants [69]. Procedures for common cell counting methods are given in Table 5 . Different types and procedures of offline colony counting methods have been performed in biotechnological processes using serial dilutions: i) spread plates, where the diluted sample is pipetted onto the surface of solid agar, and spread with the help of a glass spreader, ii) pour plates, where 1 mL of diluted sample is pipetted onto sterile Petri dishes followed by formation of a top layer by pouring approximately 15 mL, 45 °C molten agar into the Petri dishes containing the sample in the center and mixing well by swirling, iii) thin layer plates where the diluted sample is pipetted into a 2.5–3.5 mL sterile tube containing soft cooled molten agar, pouring on to the solidified agar plate with an appropriate medium as a thin layer, iv) layered plates where the thin-layer plate method iii) is used but another agar layer is added on top to allow for the growth of subsurface colonies. Finally, all these methods require growth of the single cells on the surface (plates are incubated with the agar surface facing down) at 37 °C, counting single colonies and calculating cfu/mL (colony forming units) by multiplying the counted cell numbers by the dilution factor and dividing it by the volume of the original sample. Cell enumeration is valid in the range of between 30 and 300 colonies [67,68]. Although the most probable number (MPN) method can be used [71,72], it is not preferred due to the long doubling times [73]. In some cases, direct or indirect cell mass evaluation might be preferred instead of the cell numbers. Both wet and dry cell weight approaches can be used to measure biomass. For the determination of wet cell weight, WCW (g wet cell weight/L), culture samples are taken, diluted as necessary, and the cells concentrated by centrifugation or filtration with filter paper and then directly weighed. For the determination of dry cell weight, DCW (g dry cell weight/L), cells are basically collected as above and the wet cell mass is dried in a 105 °C vacuum oven for 24 h, cooled in a desiccator and measured. However, in this case, multiple steps are susceptible to the humidity of the surrounding environment, which can lead to unreliable results. Attention must be paid to this possibility with quick measurements being helpful in avoiding the absorption of ambient humidity. Useful experimental correlations can be derived between cell weight and spectrophotometric measurements so light scattering measurements are very commonly used for the quantification of biomass [67,68]. Procedures for the measurement of viability and their advantages and disadvantages are explained in detail elsewhere [67,68,74]. Another useful measure, specific hydrogen production rate (SHP), whose maximum is related to the kinetics of biomass, substrate and product formation, is defined as hydrogen gas produced per gram of biomass per h. The units can be given as mL H2•g−1 biomass•h−1 or mL H2•g−1 VSS•d−1 where VSS is volatile suspended solids. As can be seen from the units, the hydrogen production rate is directly proportional to the quantity of biomass [73,75–77]. Bacterial growth, substrate consumption, and product (hydrogen) formation in a batch reactor with a constant volume of V can be described according the Monod equation (details given in Table 6 ). Kinetic models developed using material balances in biomass growth, substrate utilization and product formation are in great use in biological hydrogen production [78,79]. Comprehensive kinetic models have become a useful tool in the identification of rate-determining factors in fermentative hydrogen production [80]. The basic biochemical empirical mathematical model that gives the relationship between microbial growth rates and limiting substrate concentrations is the Monod Equation, which gives the specific growth rate, a parameter that depends upon variable factors which affect microbial growth. In some cases, this requires the use of additional kinetic models, derived from the Monod Equation. The logistic equation where the inhibitory effect of accumulation of biomass on growth of the microorganism is taken into account and the Andrew equation, where substrate inhibition is included, are also derived from Monod Equation. Kinetic models in fermentative hydrogen production are shown in detail in Table 7 . The inhibitory effect of light intensity, pH and temperature can be seen in the Multiparametric Monod equation, and substrate and light inhibition effects on biomass are considered in the Modified Multiparametric Monod. For substrate utilization, the Ludeking-Piret and its modified version, as well as Monod equation itself, are in use. On the other hand, product formation considers Luedeking-Piret, its modified version, and the widely used Gompertz Equation."
8,Specific parameters for hydrogen production,
9,Parameters specific to fermentative hydrogen production,"4.1 Parameters specific to fermentative hydrogen production Dark fermentation is the most preferred method of biohydrogen production due to its high hydrogen production rate, light independence, low cost, simple reactor design, and the wide range of substrate utilization capability of different types of facultative or anaerobic bacteria under a wide range of temperatures. Hydrogenase catalyzes hydrogen production from protons, so an understanding of the hydrogen production mechanism and how it is connected to cellular metabolism can aid in attempts to increase hydrogen production [88]. Hydrogenases can be divided into three classes according to their metal content: nickel-iron NiFe-hydrogenases, which tend to participate in hydrogen consumption rather than production, diiron FeFe-hydrogenases, which are involved in hydrogen production, and monoiron Fe-hydrogenase, which is unique in that it has a different active site, and carries out a different type of redox reaction, acting as a Lewis acid to carry out the cleavage of the H-H bond with hydride transfer to H4MPT+ [88,89]. All hydrogenases are variably sensitive to oxygen; FeFe-hydrogenases are rapidly and irreversibly destroyed by oxygen, whereas Ni-Fe hydrogenases reversibly react with oxygen and can be reactivated by reduction. Therefore oxygen tolerance is an important parameter for biohydrogen production [90]. Fe-Fe hydrogenases, which have 10–100 times higher activity than the other types, are mainly used in hydrogen production from dark fermentation [91]. There are various subtypes of Fe-Fe hydrogenases, with the that of the common dark fermentative biohydrogen producer Clostridia called clostridial hydrogenase [92]. Fe-Fe hydrogenase activity is affected by different operating parameters of dark fermentation such as pH, with low pH inhibiting hydrogen production due to volatile fatty acid production, as well as inhibition by high pH2 (hydrogen partial pressure) [91]. Another parameter affecting dark hydrogen production is temperature which affects both the types of bacterial strains involved and their growth. A wide range of bacteria are used in dark fermentation for biohydrogen production at mesophilic (25–40 °C), thermophilic (40–65 °C), extreme thermophilic (65–80 °C) and hyperthermophilic (>80 °C) conditions, with maximum hydrogen production yields being achieved with Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus DSM 8903 and Thermotoga neapolitana DSM 4349 at 70 °C, with 3.8 mol hydrogen/mol glucose from T. neapolitana DSM 4349 [93–95]. The type and concentration of volatile fatty acids produced, and the yield of dark fermentation are affected by temperature and pH [91,96,97]. For example, a study found that higher temperatures increased VFA production [96]. Widely used dark fermentative bacteria with high hydrogen production activities under different temperature conditions are given in Table 8 . The ability to use inexpensive complex substrates is also important since the cost of purified carbon sources is 3-fold higher than the value of the hydrogen produced, which, including operational costs, would make the difference even greater. Thermophilic bacteria can convert a wide variety of complex substrates; lignocellulosic biomass containing cellulose, vegetable kitchen waste, carrot pulp, wheat straw, maize leaves, sweet sorghum, paper waste, and sugarcane bagasse to hydrogen with or without pre-treatment depending on the type of bacteria [103]. Hydrogen partial pressure has a great influence on dark fermentation, when it is lowered the hydrogen volumetric production, production rate, and yield are increased [101,104]. This basically follows from Le Chatelier's principle, where the equilibrium constant is dependent on the concentrations of products and reactants, temperature, and pressure. C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 C H 3 C O O H + 2 C O 2 + 4 H 2 A 2B 2C 2D 4E The equilibrium constant for acetate fermentation is shown below (Equation (8)), (8) K c = [ C ] 2 [ D ] 2 [ E ] 4 [ A ] [ B ] 2 When the partial pressure of hydrogen (E) or carbon dioxide (D) or both are lowered, the equilibrium of the reaction will shift to the right, which therefore increases hydrogen production. This approach was proven using Enterobacter cloacae by lowering the partial pressure of a reactor from 760 mmHg to 380 mmHg, and more than a 2-fold increase in hydrogen yield was achieved. At the same time, volumetric hydrogen production doubled from 552 to 1074 mL, the hydrogen production rate was increased from 6 to 17 μmol•h−1 L−1, and cell mass concentration increased from 1.48 to 2.28 g•L−1, while the overall lag phase period decreased from 90 to 15 min [101]. Another process parameter, hydraulic retention time (HRT), can be used to favor hydrogen production by selectively favoring the growth of hydrogen producers over that of hydrogen consumers or methanogens [94,104]. Therefore, low HRTs have been used in continuous dark fermentation in attempts to increase in hydrogen production [105], but suppressing methanogenesis might also require the use of low pH [103,104,106]. In one study, maximum biohydrogen production was achieved at pH 5.5 with an HRT of 3 days under hyper thermophilic conditions (70 °C) using household wastes [106]."
10,Parameters specific to light dependent hydrogen production,"4.2 Parameters specific to light dependent hydrogen production Light is a major parameter in photofermentative hydrogen production due to its strong effect on nitrogenase synthesis, the enzyme carrying out hydrogen production in the absence of nitrogen in purple non-sulphur bacteria (PNSB). PNSB have been used as model organisms in order to better understand a simpler version of photosynthesis which operates to carryout cyclic photophosphorylation under anaerobic conditions in the light (Fig. 2 ). Photons are captured by light-harvesting complexes (LHs) ringing the reaction centers. The light-harvesting complexes (LH) consist of two types; LH1 and LH2, where LH2 transfers absorbed energy to LH1, and provides effective light absorbance with different light sources and intensities. PNSB growth conditions and light intensity variations can affect the amount of LH2 and even its properties, whereas in face of these different conditions, the amount of LH1 remains relatively constant [109,112,113]. When the light intensity is low, the number of light-harvesting complexes is increased, allowing the more efficient capture of the limited number of available photons. On the other hand, at high light intensities, the number of light-harvesting complexes declines, which helps to prevent cellular damage caused by absorption of excess energy [114]. During the initial stages of photosynthesis, the absorbed photon excites an electron in the light-harvesting complex (LH1 and LH2), which is passed as an exciton along an electron transport chain until it reaches the special pair of chlorophyll molecule (P870) in the reaction center (RC). There an electron is excited to a higher energy state creating a charge separation. The chemical energy obtained is captured in steps by a series of membrane carriers, pumping protons across the membrane, and used for the synthesis of ATP. Different sources of natural (solar) and artificial (tungsten, infrared (IR), halogen, fluorescent, light-emitting diode) lights with a wide range of wavelengths have been under investigation in photofermentative hydrogen production. Incandescent light is more effective than fluorescent light in terms of hydrogen production and yield, which reflects the absorption characteristics of bacteriochlorophyll [59]. Also, it was found that the growth lag phase of R. palustris (red), R. rubrum (purple-red), R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides (yellow-brown) was longer in fluorescent light (10 days) than with incandescent light (4 days) [59]. While PNSB can absorb light over a wide range of wavelengths, the most effective absorption is between 750 and 950 nm [115]. Thus, illumination of R. palustris with NIR (Near Infrared) resulted in 3 fold greater hydrogen production and 1.5 fold greater final cell concentrations compared to a broadband light source (tungsten light or incandescent) at the same light intensity (130 W m−2) [116]. However, another study using different light sources with different spectral characteristics and constant light irradiance (light intensity), showed that visible + NIR incandescent light gave better hydrogen production by Rhodobacter capsulatus compared to NIR illumination alone. However, comparison between NIR alone and incandescent light, gave results contrary to the other studies where incandescent light gave higher results [117]. In another study with Rhodobacter sphaeroides, tungsten lights over 760 nm and below 630 nm were compared in terms of hydrogen production, with 43% and 7% decreases being observed respectively [118]. Another set of experiments were performed to see the effect of the different wavelengths (470, 520, 590 and 630 nm) and two light intensities (4000 and 5000 lux) on hydrogen production using LED lights. The hydrogen production rate increased with increasing wavelength and light intensity until light saturation at 590 nm [66]. It seems that light source as well as wavelength are important parameters in photofermentative hydrogen production and further investigation is needed to understand the contradictory published results. The composition as well as amounts of carotenoids (Car) and bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchla) in the light-harvesting (LH) complexes of PNSB depends on light intensity. When the light intensity is low, LH contains more Car and Bchlas, permitting additional light capture and thus more efficient use of light energy to produce hydrogen [109]. Under high light intensities, additional cell growth can be achieved, which, however, doesn't necessarily lead to additional hydrogen production due to self-shading by the excess cells with low light penetration and distribution [119,120]. The Beer-Lambert law (Equation (9)) expresses the relation between the absorbance of the cell culture and entrance/exit intensities of the light from the cell culture to find the effective light intensity. (9) A = l o g 10 I 0 I For example, the Beer-Lambert law can be used to calculate the expected light attenuation at different depths to guide bioreactor design. One study calculated that the maximum thickness of the bioreactor under examination should be 2 cm of cell culture since at that thickness the light intensity had decreased from 1500 W m−2 to 0.023 W m−2 [119]. Shading due to culture density, affecting light penetration and distribution, needs even more attention when using co-cultures or mixed cultures in integrated dark and photo fermentation because of the high cell densities [1]."
11,Parameters specific to Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs),"4.3 Parameters specific to Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs) Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), also called electrohydrogenesis cells, bioelectrochemical assisted microbial reactors (BEAMRs), or biocatalyzed electrolysis cells (BECs), use electrically driven hydrogen production in a method with many differences with dark and photofermentation. MECs consist of two basic components; an anode, which accepts electrons from electrogenic bacteria, enabling anaerobic respiration of organic substrates, and a cathode where hydrogen evolution takes place under anaerobic conditions. Typically, the anode and cathode chambers are separated by a proton permeable membrane. Basically, microorganisms grow on the anode, degrade substrates, transfer electrons to the anode either through direct contact or indirectly mediated by carriers, releasing protons to the medium which upon transfer to the cathodic chamber are reduced to hydrogen using exogenously supplied electricity. Various wastes, wastewater, organic and agricultural wastes, have been used as substrates for MECs. There are four main elements that are specific to MECs; process architectures/material selection for the anode/cathode, thermodynamics/operating parameters, reactor design, and applied potential/sources [121]. Material selection for electrodes, especially for cathodes, can have the greatest impact on hydrogen production since hydrogen evolution of hydrogen takes place at the cathode, usually made of carbon without any catalyst, or carbon doped with catalyst [15]. Different cathode materials and catalysts used in MECs have been reviewed in detail [16,122]. Hydrogen evolution occurs in a series of reactions, starting with the electrochemical Volmer (discharge) reaction where protons are reduced to H* on the cathode surface. Depending on the type and surface structure of the material, catalyst and operating parameters, the second step can either be chemical or electrochemical, called Tefal and Heyrovsky reactions, respectively. For selecting anode material, the physical properties of conductivity, corrosion resistance, and porosity are important parameters. As well, the selected material should be economical, practical, and environmentally friendly. The most common anode used is graphite, which has the desired properties described above [15]. An interconnecting proton permeable membrane is not absolutely required since cells with or without this membrane can both produce high-purity hydrogen with high efficiency. One of the disadvantages of using a membrane to separate the anode and cathode is its addition of internal resistance. On the other hand, if the production period is prolonged over a long period, MECs without membranes can show the undesirable by-product formation of methane, which reduces the efficiency of hydrogen production. Therefore, if a membrane is to be used than it is better to select one with low resistance, or if a MEC is used without a membrane than the reaction period should be kept short. A chemical reaction will occur spontaneously if the Gibbs Free energy (ΔGR) of the reaction is negative, otherwise external energy must be supplied to overcome the thermodynamic limitation. The applied voltage in MECs has to be larger than the equilibrium voltage (Eeq), which can be calculated from theoretical anode (Ean) and cathode potentials (Ecat). The required equations can be obtained using Nernst equations as follows (Table 9 ); where the reaction occurs under standard biological conditions (T = 25 °C, P = 1 atm, pH = 7), F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C/mol e−), n is the number of electrons in the reaction (e−), R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), PH2 is the partial pressure of hydrogen gas, and the overpotentials of anode, cathode and ohmic losses of the system are ϕa, ϕc, IRΩ respectively [15,16,121]. If the estimated equilibrium potential is calculated as negative (or ΔGR is positive) it means that the reaction cannot occur spontaneously, so additional potential is needed to make the reaction thermodynamically favorable. This is in the range of 0.2–0.8 V for optimal hydrogen production by MECs [123]. The effect of applied potential on hydrogen production is still under active investigation. Various types of reactor designs have been investigated using different distances between anode and cathode, various membranes, and considerations of mass transfer effects. Different reactor designs are available including, for single chamber (no membrane); simple single chamber, single chamber multi-anode, tubular, reactor wall as a cathode, single chamber cylindrical configuration, and for two chambers (separated by a proton exchange membrane); simple two chamber, two chamber with gaseous cathode, tubular single chamber, etc. [16]. The hydrogen produced can be measured by the commonly used water displacement method or the intermittent Owen method. The performance of MECs can be measured in different ways. Hydrogen yield can be calculated as the amount of hydrogen produced per mole of substrate consumed. Overall hydrogen recovery (RH2) is determined by multiplying the Columbic efficiency (CE) by hydrogen recovery (Rcat) (Equation (9)). Columbic efficiency (CE) is given by Equation (10), where nCE is total current (I) integrated over time, nth is the theoretical hydrogen produced in moles, and F is the Faraday constant [16]. Hydrogen recovery (Rcat) is calculated as shown in equation (11), where nH2 is the total number of moles of hydrogen produced. (9) R H 2 = C E R c a t (10) C E = n C E n t h = C p 2 F n t h = ∫ 0 t I d t 2 F n t h (11) R c a t = n H 2 n C E = n H 2 ∫ 0 t I d t"
12,Statistical analysis,"Many studies have used a statistical approach called design of experiments (DOE) to improve hydrogen production by optimizing productivity and yield. The design of experiment (DOE) process involves five basic steps; (1) screening to identify factors and ranges, (2) selecting a suitable method, (3) performing experiments and collecting data, (4) analyzing/evaluating data to obtain model graphs, and (5) optimization to validate the model. Fig. 3 demonstrates the flow chart of the design of experiments in biohydrogen production with common input/output parameters and suitable methods, and Table 10 shows such statistical analyses applied to biohydrogen production over the last decade. Researchers have concluded that using the statistical analysis approach provides a great avenue for increasing biohydrogen production efficiency. Central Composite Design (CCD) and Box Behnken design (BBD) are commonly used statistical approaches, especially in biotechnological processes. A recent article compared two response surface methods, CCD and BBD, in their optimization of organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention times (HRT) and pH. It was found that BBD and CCD predicted almost the same optimal conditions for both HRT and pH, while they just differed for ORL. Over 90% of treatment performances of UASB were found appropriate in predictions from both methods, judged to be sufficient, predictive and significant. It was concluded that response surface methodology promises an effective and economical way to optimize different wastewater processes [138]. A comparison of widely used classical experimental methods with three variables is given in detail in Table 11 [139]."
13,Application to future research areas,
14,New substrates,"6.1 New substrates Depending on the metabolism of the bacterial strain, agricultural liquid and solid wastes, palm oil mill effluent, complex alcoholic distillery wastewaters, beverage and brewery industry wastewaters, textile, and coffee drink manufacturing wastes have been under investigation for use in clean biofuel production, an energy generating process that would also carry out waste treatment [74]. Plant dry matter, lignocellulosic biomass, composed of 40–45% cellulose, 30% hemicellulose, and 15–25% lignin polymers has attracted great attention as a new substrate for biohydrogen production due to the potentially abundant supply of this renewable raw material which includes leaves, crop residues, hard/softwoods, and forestry wastes [6,140,141]. Cellulose and hemicellulose are composed of the common fermentable monosaccharides glucose, xylose, mannose and arabinose, whereas the presence of lignin potentially could result in a lower hydrogen production and yield. On the other hand, when dark fermentation by the newly isolated strictly anaerobic mesophilic bacterium Clostridium lentocellum strain Cel10 was tested with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and raw (no pre-treatment) lignocellulosic material, the maximum degradation of cellulose was 51.42% for CMC and 45.43% for raw lignocellulosic material 45.43%, where a maximum hydrogen yield of 4.08 mmol H2 •g−1 was noted [6]. Obviously, it could be fruitful to search for microorganisms that are capable of directly producing hydrogen from lignocellulosic matter without the need for any pre-treatment."
15,New strains,"6.2 New strains Although many pure strains have been isolated, characterized and operated in both dark and photofermentation with different operating conditions and modes, investigators are still searching for more efficient strains in terms of hydrogen production. In addition to new strain isolation, researchers have been using metabolic engineering, protein engineering and gene expression approaches in efforts to improve hydrogen production [142]. Genetically engineered species with modified metabolism are one approach to improving biohydrogen production. Achieving effective biohydrogen yields requires a good understanding of fermentative biohydrogen metabolism in both dark and photo fermentations. Attempts to improve photo fermentation have included the overexpression of certain genes, knocking-out of the uptake hydrogenases, as well as elimination of the Calvin-Benson cycle pathway. Different modifications, including the elimination of the hydrogen uptake gene, homologous or heterologous gene modification, synthetic metabolic pathway construction, combination of strains, and the isolation of new strains have been already applied to dark fermentation [143](Table 12 ). Under normal dark fermentation conditions the maximal obtainable yield is thought to be 4 mol H2 • mol−1, however, due to a number of factors, practical production results are usually much less than this [54,137]. Illustrating the potential power of new strain selection, a very good hydrogen yield of 3.35 mol H2 • mol−1glucose was reported using dark fermentation at 37 °C and pH 5 by the newly isolated strain Clostridium sp DMHC-10 [159]. One recent study using the newly isolated Clostridium perfirngens JJC reported an astonishing yield of 4.68 mol H2 • mol−1 glucose under optimal conditions, apparently exceeding the previously reported and even theoretical maximum hydrogen yields [160]. However, this was calculated in the report using the modified Gompertz equation, a dubious application of a kinetic equation to yields. The newly isolated Clostridium lentocellum strain Cel10 is an interesting strain in that it can directly produce hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass [140]. Optimal hydrogen production was obtained using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) at pH 7, 37 °C with 5 g/L CMC. This gave a yield of 5.4 mmol H2/g CMC, the highest yet reported for mesophilic bacteria using cellulose as substrate as a cellulose. Some of the newly isolated mesophilic bacteria along with operational conditions used during hydrogen production and achieved hydrogen yields were given in Table 13 . Besides pure and newly isolated cultures, mixed culture studies have been widely investigated. Mixed-culture systems have been seen as a more appealing option than pure and co-culture systems for the biohydrogen production from organic wastes due to greater microbial diversity, low operating cost, minimal media supplementation, and minimum inoculum steps [167]. There are several possible pre-treatments previously described in the literature; heat, chemical, combined, microwave and other. The seed inoculum pretreatment methods with advantages and disadvantages for mixed cultures were given in detail in Table 14 [168]."
16,New reactors,"6.3 New reactors Fermentative hydrogen production studies, especially with complex wastewaters or solid wastes, have been conducted using different types and configurations of bioreactors [169,170]. One advantage of batch reactor operations is being able to test various parameters at the same time with small volume reactors. However batch operations can also give very low hydrogen production rates, 0.003 L H2 • L−1 • h−1 [171]. Continuous operations would be required for practical large-scale biohydrogen production. For this, a CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor), is the most preferred reactor due to its simple design and construction, improvement of mass transfer efficiency with agitation, and ease of operation and control. However, its lower biomass retention results in many disadvantages such as a relatively low biomass concentration at short HRTs (hydraulic retention time), the potential for washout at very short HRT, substrate utilization limitations, lower performance with lower hydrogen production rates; 0.2 L H2 • L−1 • h−1 [172,173]. Therefore optimization HRT and/or bioreactor configuration is essential [173–176]. The low volumetric rates of hydrogen production with either batch or continuous reactors have lead researchers to design different reactors; anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) [176], anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) [177], fluidized bed reactor (FBR) [178], packed bed reactor (PBR) [178], photo-fermentative sequencing batch reactor (PFSBR) [179], up flow anaerobic packed-bed reactor (APBR) [180], and dry fermentation reactor [169]. The highest hydrogen production rate of 9.3 L H2 • L−1 • h−1 was achieved using a carrier-induced granular sludge bed (CIGSB) reactor with high biomass concentration and a short HRT of 0.5 h [181]. Dry fermentation, which has at least 20% or more solid waste content compared to a wet digestion system where this is lower than 10%, is a recent method under investigation for biohydrogen production. An anaerobic wet digestion system for solid waste treatment requires large volumes of digesters because of the need for substrate and inoculum dilutions. Contrary to an anaerobic digestion system, dry fermenters don't need large volume reactors, reducing the need for water. The operational cost is also lower since there is no need for agitation in the dry fermenter and a wide variety of substrates can be utilized with high hydrogen production rates [169,182]. Although dry fermentation is a newly developed method in biohydrogen production, a hydrogen production rate of 7.2 L H2 • L−1 d−1 has already been achieved [183]."
17,Conclusion,"A large number of studies in an area can create a plethora of different data sets, often using different units, definitions, and different points of view. Due to this it is often difficult to compare different studies. Here we have drawn attention to the different ways of reporting data resulting from experiments on biohydrogen fermentation. Various means of applying measurements, quantification, and analysis were given for different types of biohydrogen fermentation with reference to the relevant literature. In addition, some useful definitions, information, conversions, equations and calculations for hydrogen fermentations are compiled and discussed for the first time."
