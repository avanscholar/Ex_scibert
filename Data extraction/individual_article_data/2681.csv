0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean renewable energy carrier with zero pollutant emissions [1,2]. Microbial hydrogen production from waste using fermentative bacteria is more environmentally favorable compared to conventional thermo-chemical and electro-chemical processes because it does not require energy input and can simultaneously achieve energy recovery and environmental cleanup [3,4]. The biological generation of hydrogen from anaerobic fermentation of organic substrates promises to be an economical and sustainable technology if conversion efficiencies can be increased [5,6]. Anaerobic fermentation has been previously used for the production of methane and solvents such as butanol, ethanol and acetone, but only recently has fermentation been studied for hydrogen production. The utilization of waste materials containing high concentrations of organics, such as municipal solid waste, industrial wastewater, and agricultural waste, to produce hydrogen may warrant significant economic and environmental benefits. Sulfate is a common constituent of many industrial wastewaters [7]. For example, acid waste stream of a synthetic drug plant and yellow ginger processing wastewater contain high sulfate concentration (>20,000 mg/L) [8,9]. However, only limited information is available for the effect of high sulfate concentrations on microbial hydrogen production. For example, Lin and Chen [10] found that high hydrogen production could be obtained from sucrose oxidation using enriched mixed microflora at sulfate concentrations as high as 3000 mg/L. The solution pH is also reported to be an important factor in biological hydrogen production [11]. Bio-hydrogen production is usually efficient at pH 5.0–6.5 under low to moderate sulfate concentrations (up to 300 mg/L) [12–14]. However, hydrogen production is significantly lowered at pH > 6.0 under relatively high sulfate concentrations (500–3000 mg/L) [10], and this was attributed to the production of H2S by SRB that inhibited activity of hydrogen producing microorganisms [11,15–17]. Although it has been recognized that the efficiency of bio-hydrogen production is greatly influenced by solution pH and sulfate concentrations, the effect of solution pH variation under very high sulfate concentrations (5000–20,000 mg/L) has not been reported. This study examined the effect of sulfate concentrations and pH on hydrogen production using glucose as a substrate during long-term operation (234 days) at HRT of 24 h. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to identify and monitor the changes in fermentative microbial population in the bioreactor."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and substrate,"2.1 Seed sludge and substrate Seed sludge used in this study was collected from anaerobic digesters of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Wonju Water Supply and Drainage Center, South Korea). The pH, carbohydrate and volatile suspended solids (VSSs) were 6.8, 1.1 g/L and 4.8 g/L, respectively, in the seed sludge. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alkalinity of the sludge were 410 and 2180 mg/L, respectively. Glucose (15 g COD/L) was used as a substrate. Iron sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) solution was used as sulfate source with concentrations ranging from 0 to 20,000 mg SO4 2−/L. The substrate was prepared daily and stored in a substrate reservoir maintained at 4 ± 1 °C. The anaerobic digester for seed culturing was operated at 35 °C and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days by feeding a mixture of primary sludge and synthetic medium. The medium contained the following nutrients (in mg/L) along with glucose and iron sulfate: NH4HCO3, 4700; K2HPO4, 125; MgCl2·6H2O, 100; MnSO4·6H2O, 15; FeSO4·7H2O, 25; CuSO4·5H2O, 5; CoCl2·5H2O, 0.1 and NaHCO3, 2000. The reactor was monitored for pH, gas production and composition, glucose and sulfate concentration, ethanol and VFAs distribution under the operational conditions."
3,Operation of chemostat reactor systems,"2.2 Operation of chemostat reactor systems Three anaerobic chemostat reactors (2.0 L total volume) filled with 1.0 L mixed liquor were continuously stirred by biogas re-circulated with a vacuum pump at a flow rate of 5 L/min. The reactors were installed in a temperature controlled chamber at 35 ± 1 °C. The solution pH (5.5–6.2) in the reactors was adjusted using 3N KOH. Substrate was continuously added into the reactor with a micro-tube pump (EYELA, MP-3). The reactor was connected to a biogas collection cylinder placed in an acidic (2% H2SO4) and NaCl saturated solution to measure the volume of biogas produced. The chemostat reactor systems were maintained at a constant HRT of 24 h."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis The pH was measured by a pH meter (Thermo Orion 290A, Orion Corporation). Sulfate concentration was analyzed by ion chromatography (DX-120, Dionex Corporation, USA) equipped with an analytical column (Dionex Ionpac AS14–4 mm) and a guard column (Dionex Ionpac AG14–4 mm) after the pretreatment with 0.45 μm GF/C (Glass fiber filter, Type C). Total sulfide (TS) and dissolved sulfide (DS) were determined by iodometric methods [18]. Carbohydrate concentration was analyzed by standard method using anthrone-H2SO4 [19]. Mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (VSS) was analyzed by standard method [18]. The H2 gas was analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan) using a stainless steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A and Ar as carrier gas. The operational temperatures of injector, detector and column were 80, 110 and 60 °C, respectively. CO2, CH4 and H2S were measured by the same detector (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan) with a 2.5 m stainless column packed with Hayesep Q (80/100) and helium (He) as carrier gas. Ethanol and VFAs were analyzed by a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a glass column packed with 10% REOPLEX 400. The temperatures of injector port, detector and column were 240, 240 and 140 °C, respectively."
5,FISH analysis,"2.4 FISH analysis The FISH technique with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was employed to monitor the change in the microbial community in the chemostat reactor systems. In situ hybridization of activated sludge cells was performed according to the protocol proposed by [20]. The oligonucleotide probes used in this study are specific for phylogenetic groups of HPB and SRB [21]. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and fluorescently labeled with a hydrophilic sulfoindocyanine dye (Cy-3) and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and/or 6-carboxy-fluorescein (6-FAM) at the 5′ end (Bionics, Seoul, South Korea). Anaerobic biomass samples were recovered from the reactor on 28, 55, 86, 115, 144, 174, 206 and 234 days and fixed in 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to rinse the bio-film samples. Each fixed bio-film sample was placed in a small aluminum cup overnight at room temperature to allow the Jung OCT compound (Leica Int.) to penetrate the bio-film samples. Bio-film samples were frozen at −20 °C and cut into 20 μm thick vertical slices with a cryostat (Reichart-Jung cryocut 1800, Leica Int.). Each slice was placed on a slide coated with 0.1% gelatin in the presence of 0.01% chromium potassium sulfate and dried overnight at room temperature (25 °C). The specimen were dehydrated by successive 50, 80 and 98% ethanol washes (3 min each) followed by air drying, and stored at room temperature until further use. In situ hybridizations were performed in a hybridization incubator using formamide at 46 °C for 2 h. Hybridization was followed twice by a stringent washing step at 48 °C for 10 min with 50 mL of pre-warmed washing buffer (20 mM Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.2] and 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The washing buffer was removed by rinsing the slides with distilled water and the slides were air dried. The slides were mounted to avoid bleaching and examined with an Axioplan epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) and MRC-1024 (Biorad, U.K.) CLSM."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of sulfate and pH on biogas and hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of sulfate and pH on biogas and hydrogen production The daily variations in biogas and hydrogen production during hydrogen fermentation with different sulfate concentrations and pH values 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2 are shown in Fig. 1 . The biogas was composed mainly of H2 and CO2 throughout all experiments. Average biogas production was increased from 4.7 (±0.2) to 5.3 (±0.1), 4.6 (±0.1) to 5.2 (±0.2) and 4.7 (±0.2) to 5.0 (±0.2) L/day at varied sulfate concentrations from 0 to 5000 mg/L at pH 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2, respectively. The maximum biogas production (5.4 L/day) was observed at pH 5.5 and sulfate concentration: 3000 mg/L, while the minimum biogas production (4.5 L/day) was obtained at pH 6.2, and sulfate concentration: 20,000 mg/L. Hydrogen production increased from 2.4 to 2.8 L/day at pH 5.5 when sulfate concentration was changed from 1000 to 3000 mg/L. A slight decrease in hydrogen from 2.4, 2.1 to 1.8 L/day was observed at pH 5.5, 5.6–6.2, respectively with sulfate concentration 20,000 mg/L. This might be attributed to the increased SRB activity at high sulfate concentration and higher pH which resulted in lower hydrogen production. The marked increase in hydrogen production at high sulfate concentrations (1000–5000 mg/L) and pH 5.5 (Fig. 1) might be also due to the simultaneous increase of iron concentration (580–2900 mg/L). Zhang et al. [22] reported that iron was especially beneficial for bacterial growth, but an excess amount of iron (ca. 3000 mg FeSO4/L) could be harmful for microbial activity, leading to reduced hydrogen production. The biogas production varied with sulfate concentrations and pH value. Higher sulfate and iron concentrations inhibited biogas production. A previous study reported that the most biogas reduction occurred at a sulfate concentration of 1500 mg/L at which biogas production decreased by 16% at pH of 6.7 [10]. Such a reduction in biogas production was attributed to the gradual acclimation of microflora to sulfate reducing environment in response to increasing sulfate level. It was also observed that the increase in pH at varying sulfate concentrations influenced hydrogen yield (HY) and hydrogen content in the biogas. The daily variations in HY and gas composition at pH 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2 and different sulfate concentrations under steady-state conditions are shown in Table 1 . The average HY was ca. 1.8, 1.7 and 1.6 mol H2/mol glucose at pH 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2, respectively. The maximum yield of hydrogen production reported in this study was 1.9 (±0.1) mol H2/mol glucose when sulfate concentration varied between 1000 and 3000 mg/L at pH 5.5. Minimum HY (1.5 mol H2/mol glucose) was observed at sulfate concentration of 20,000 mg/L and pH 6.2. The average hydrogen content was 51, 48 and 45% at pH 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2, respectively. The hydrogen content reached a maximum of 53 and 52% when sulfate concentration varied between 100 and 3000 mg/L at pH 5.5. A lower hydrogen content of 38% was obtained at pH 6.2 and sulfate concentration 20,000 mg/L. Lin and Chen [10] reported that high sulfate concentration markedly reduced the hydrogen content to 27% at pH 6.7, but lowering pH to 5.5 recovered the hydrogen content to 50%. Another major gas present in the reactor was carbon dioxide (Table 1). In the biogas, H2S was also observed at pH 5.8 in sulfate concentration range of 3000–20,000 mg/L, while at pH 6.2 the H2S was present in a wider sulfate concentration range (300 - 20,000 mg/L), with the maximum of 3.4% at sulfate concentration of 10,000 mg/L. A previous study also reported H2S concentrations lower than 100 mg/L in the biogas at 3500 mg SO4 2−/L and pH 6.7, but it was less than 0.1 mg/L when pH was 5.5 at the same sulfate concentration [10]. The average of glucose degradation was 88, 85 and 79% at pH 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2, respectively. During fermentation, glucose was converted into biomass, hydrogen gas and soluble metabolites. The average VSS concentrations were in the range of 4131–4065 mg/L (Table 1). Under steady-state condition, Lin and Chen [10] found that sucrose degradation was >97.6% and average VSS concentrations ranged between 4000 and 4700 mg/L."
8,Sulfate conversion during hydrogen fermentation,"3.2 Sulfate conversion during hydrogen fermentation Production of sulfur compounds from sulfate under steady-state condition is shown in Fig. 2 . Under anaerobic environment, sulfate is reduced to sulfite and then to sulfide by SRB [23]. Presence of different sulfur compounds is pH-dependent. In this study, the residual sulfate fraction decreased from 95.9 to 80.0% in the effluent which was observed while sulfate concentration increased from 0 to 20,000 mg/L at pH 6.2. However, at pH 5.5, the residual sulfate fraction was maintained relatively high (97.3–96.4%) at sulfate concentrations from 0 to 20,000 mg/L indicating that acidic environment is not favorable for SRB [24]. This resulted in the decreased hydrogen production from 48.3 to 38.2% when sulfate reduction was increased from 4.1 to 20.0% with 15 g COD/L (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). Small decrease in sulfate reduction was even observed at pH 5.8 with initial sulfate concentration of 20,000 mg/L indicated by the residual sulfate fraction of 85.2%. Under anaerobic environment, sulfate is reduced to sulfite and then to sulfide by SRB. SRB can compete with hydrogen-producing acetogens (HPAs) for the same electron donors such as acetate and hydrogen which causes the hydrogen transversals among the anaerobic microbial species [25]. Total sulfide (TS) consisted of dissolved sulfide (DS) and insoluble sulfide such as ferrous sulfide (FeS). DS is composed of ionized sulfide (HS−, S2−) and free hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In this study, the concentration of TS and DS increased with an increase in sulfate concentration at pH 5.8 and 6.2. When sulfate concentration varied from 0 to 20,000 mg/L, TS and DS concentrations increased from 0 to 123, 0–183 mg/L at pH 5.8 and 0 to 81, 0–98 mg/L at pH 6.2, respectively. DS concentration dropped to < 1 mg/L when pH was reduced to 5.5 (Fig. 2). Sulfate reduction is primarily driven by two major groups of SRB including incomplete oxidizers, which reduce compounds such as lactate to acetate and CO2, and complete oxidizers, which completely convert acetate to CO2 and HCO3 −. Two stages of inhibition can be induced by sulfate reduction. Primary inhibition is due to competition for common organic and inorganic substrates by SRB, which suppresses methane production [26]. Secondary inhibition results from the toxicity of sulfide to various bacteria groups [17,27]. The decrease in hydrogen production might be related to hydrogen sulfide toxicity and hydrogen consumption by SRB. Bitton [28] reported the conversion of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide by SRB, the presence of sulfide results in toxicity to other anaerobes under anaerobic conditions. Mizuno et al. [24] reported that SRB could not survive under pH 6, but our results indicate sulfide production at pH 5.8, although it disappeared at pH 5.5."
9,Production of major metabolites,"3.3 Production of major metabolites Anaerobic systems often involve the degradation of organic matter into H2, CH4 and CO2 accompanied by the production of VFAs and sometimes alcohols, by several microbial groups. The major byproducts in the study were HBu, HAc, HPr, and among them HBu was dominant in all test run. In the acidogenic sulfate-reducing reactor, VFAs, ethanol and lactic acid could be further converted to acetic acid quickly by fatty acid-utilizing sulfate reducing bacteria (FSRB) and hydrogen producing acetogens (HPA), producing more acetic acid as the terminal product [29]. The VFAs and ethanol fractions in the effluents are shown in Fig. 3 . The average concentration of HBu was 53.8% (5732 mg/L), 43.2% (4477 mg/L) and 34.1% (3532 mg/L) at pH 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2, respectively, and with varying sulfate concentrations from 0 to 20,000 mg/L. HBu production decreased with increasing pH and sulfate concentrations. The VFAs and ethanol fractions in the effluent were generally in the order of HBu > HAc > ethanol > HPr as shown in Fig. 3. An increase in sulfate concentration from 0 to 20,000 mg/L resulted in the decrease of HBu fractions from 43.2 to 34.1% and an increase of ethanol fractions from 22.0% (2270 mg/L) to 29.3% (2990 mg/L) at pH 5.8 and 6.2, respectively. Based on the marked differences in hydrogen production and metabolite distribution at pH 6.2 and 5.5 (Figs. 1 and 3), it appears a shift in metabolic pathway occurred with pH change [30]. The shift was from hydrogen-producing HBu fermentation into energy consuming ethanol fermentation that had unfavorable impact on hydrogen production. The acetate fractions were decreased from 26 to 23%, 29 to 26% and 28 to 23%, respectively, as sulfate concentration were increased from 5000 to 20,000 mg/L pH from 5.5 to 6.2. These results suggest that acetate is partially oxidized by SRB. It is important to elucidate whether or to what extent SRB may consume acetate and hydrogen in the hydrogenesis process. SRB may compete with methanogens for the same electron donors such as acetate and hydrogen [28]. When supplied with acetate, as electron donor, very small amount of sulfates was reduced while very small amount of fed substrate was converted into other kinds of VFAs (see Fig. 3), but they could be consumed by SRB population directly [31,32]. This result is consistent with a previous study that reported increased production of propionic acid, lactic acid and ethanol with decreasing hydrogen production during anaerobic fermentation [33]. Glucose was converted into highly soluble volatile solids (SVS) (i.e. lower degradation of carbohydrate) at pH 6.2, which resulted in lower hydrogen production. However, at lower pH (5.5), glucose was mainly converted into VFAs as shown in Table 2 , which were further converted into hydrogen resulting in higher hydrogen production. Less than 8.0% of total COD was converted to H2 at high pH (6.2) and high sulfate concentration (above 1000 mg/L). A previous study showed decrease in the ethanol concentration and increase in VFAs (i.e. HBu, HAc) at pH 5.5, which implied a shift in the metabolic pathway which resulting in higher hydrogen production [10]. The amount of metabolites varied with the sulfate concentration. The distribution of metabolites formed during hydrogen fermentation often serves as an important parameter for assessing the efficiency of hydrogen producing cultures [5,34]. Our results show that the acid forming pathway dominated the metabolic flow, and therefore HBu was the major metabolite in the hydrogen-producing bacterial microorganisms. The metabolic pathway from glucose degradation during hydrogen fermentation has been accessed using the HBu/HAc (B/A) ratio [35] and has frequently been used as the indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of hydrogen production [36]. The optimal B/A ratio for H2 production varies with the composition of the anaerobic cultures and the substrate used. For instance, using glucose as a substrate, the optimal B/A ratio for Clostridium butyricum [37] and Bacillus methylotrophicum [36] was 2 and 0.75, respectively. In our study the average B/A ratio were 2.0 and 1.1 at pH 5.5 and 6.2, respectively (Fig. 4 ). The relatively lower B/A ratio at higher pH (6.2) compared to lower pH (5.5) might be due to more acetate oxidation by SRB if the butyrate concentration remained constant. The maximum value of B/A ratio (2.2) was obtained at sulfate concentration of 3000 mg/L at pH 5.5, while the lower B/A ratio (0.9) was observed at higher sulfate concentrations varying from 10,000 to 20,000 mg/L at both pH 5.8 and 6.2."
10,Analysis of the microbial community structure by FISH,"3.4 Analysis of the microbial community structure by FISH The FISH images (Fig. 5 ) illustrate that the relative abundance of Clostridium-like species were composed of similar population of identical predominant species. The samples were double hybridized with Casc67 (Cy3) + Eubmix (FITC). In this study, specific-probe hybridized cell populations analyzed by the FISH technique and used for the qualitative analysis of the various HPB cells targeted by Casc67, Robo730 and ENT183. These cells appeared to be relatively small and formed spherical and tightly packed clusters. The images obtained using Robo730 and ENT183 had low visibility, thus the respective images are not shown. FISH analysis indicates the presence of HPB (Clostridium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) under all experimental conditions. Most of the SRB phylogenetically belong to Desulfovibrio spp., Desulfobulbus spp., Desulfobacterium spp. and Desulfobacter spp. However, it appears that Desulfobulbus like species was predominant in the reactor at pH 5.8 and 6.2. The distribution and relative abundance of members of the family Desulfobulbus spp. within the bacterial population was determined by in situ probing with the 6-FAM-labeled SRB 660 probe (green) and the Cy-3-labeled EUB 338 (red) (Fig. 5). It could grow rapidly using sulfate as substrate, as observed in this study. However, SRB cells were not detected by FISH analysis at pH 5.5. Lin and Chen [10] reported the presence of SRB only when the solution pH was 6.7 at which it significantly influenced hydrogen production."
11,Conclusions,"In an acidogenic hydrogen production reactor, sulfate concentration and pH variation showed significant influence on hydrogen production. The decreased hydrogen production at pH 5.8 and 6.2 compared with at pH 5.5 was presumably due to increase of SRB activity which reduced activity of HPB. FISH analysis confirmed the abundance of SRB population at both pH 5.8 and 6.2. At pH 6.2, hydrogen production was proportionally decreased with the increase in sulfate concentrations. As a result, for maximum hydrogen production, it is important to keep the operational pH at 5.5 or to maintain low sulfate concentration at neutral pH ranges."
