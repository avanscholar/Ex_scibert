0,Introduction,"With increasing concern about the shortage of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases, the quest for sustainable production of biofuels from renewable resources has been on the rise [1]. As one of the most promising biomass-derived platform molecules, furfural (FAL) could be obtained in industrial grade by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of agricultural waste resources such as corn cobs and converted widely to massive serviceable and high value-added chemical molecules [2,3]. In this context, catalytic hydrogenation of FAL to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is considered to be the preferred key process in biomass conversion industry due to the wide application of FOL in fine chemical and polymer industries [4,5]. In the traditional method, this reaction required pressurized fossil-derived hydrogen, which can bring about safety trouble. Last several years, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction which using alcohol as hydrogen donor has emerged as an alternative strategy for the traditional straight-forward hydrogenation method. And many types of catalyst including metal oxides [6], molecular sieves [7,8] and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [9] have been applied in this reaction. Among them, MOF material is a new type of porous composite material formed by self-assembly of inorganic metal ion and organic ligand, which has been widely used in the field of adsorption and catalysis due to its porosity, high specific surface area and regular controllable crystal structure [9–11]. It is known that metal ion and organic ligand are two keys to determine the structure and function of MOF material [12]. Precious metals played an important role in the early catalyst synthesis due to their excellent catalytic activity [13,14]. In consideration of the cost, their application is limited, therefore, cheap metals (e.g., Cu, Mn, Fe) and transition metals (e.g., Al, Zr, Sn, Hf) were widely used as perfect substitutes. In particular, several Zr- and Hf-based MOF materials, such as UIO-66 [15], MOF-808 [16], DUT-67 [17] and DUT-69 [18] displayed pronounced catalytic performances in CTH reduction. However, the organic ligands used in these materials are all derived from petroleum-based chemicals. Driven by green/sustainable development, some natural materials, such as phytic acid [19], polyphenol [20] and porphyrin [21] have been successfully used as organic ligands to prepare functional mesoporous materials with similar connection structure like MOFs and enhanced activity. Recently, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), one of the top-12 valuable molecules from biomass, has been used as renewable organic ligand for the preparation mesoporous acid-base bifunctional hybrid due to the presence of two –COOH groups at the 2,5-positions of the furan ring [22]. For example, Li et al. [24] reported the simple assembly of FDCA with different metal ions to prepare a range of metal-FDCA hybrids under hydrothermal condition. The prepared hybrids displayed microspheric structure, high thermostability, average pore diameters of approximately 4.7 nm, large density, moderate strength of Lewis acid-base centers and small number of Brønsted acid sites, which showed highly efficient for the catalytic hydrogenation of biofuranic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols without breaking the C=C bond of the furan ring at 140 °C in 4 h. In addition to metal ion and organic ligand, monocarboxylic acid is another key to determine the structure and function of metal-organic hybrids, which can be used as the modulator to regulate the crystal growth in the formation of metal-organic connection structures. The smaller pKa value of monocarboxylic acid can get better coordination effect, the longer alkyl chain of monocarboxylic acid results in the greater defect of MOF structure [24–26]. Formic acid has been used as modulator to regulate the crystal growth in the formation of FDCA-based hybrid, excellent activity and selectivity were observed in CTH of diverse carbonyl compounds [27]. Inspired by these findings, we aimed to design a mesoporous acid-base bifunctional hybrid (Zr-FDCA) with high Lewis acidity and basicity from zirconium and FDCA by using acetic acid as the modulator, the proposed concept was based on: (1) acetic acid is a biomass derived organic acid, which has a slightly larger pKa (4.74) than that of formic acid (3.74), thus, results in less corrosion of the equipment. (2) acetic acid has a longer alkyl chain than that of formic acid, which can theoretically produce a larger gap space in formation process of porous structure, therefore, more metal sites can be exposed to get high Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity, thus improving the CTH activity. And their physiochemical characteristics were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunnauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis. The catalytic performance was tested by CTH of FAL to FOL in the presence of isopropanol. A kinetic model for CTH of FAL to FOL was established, which can predict the FOL formation as a function of process condition and provide an effective tool to monitor and tailor the process conditions to obtain the desired product. Finally, the recyclability and reusability were also investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials FAL (99%), FOL (99%) and N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai, China). Zr(NO3)4·5H2O and FDCA (98%) were obtained from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Ethanol (AR grade) was bought from Tianjin ZhiYuan Reagent Co., Ltd. Acetic acid (AR grade) was bought from Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd. (Shichuan, China). Isopropanol and other reagents were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Ltd. (Shanghai, China)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Zr-FDCA hybrid was synthesized as reported in the literature with slight modification [28]. Initially, 1.29 g Zr(NO3)4·5H2O was first dissolved in 150 mL DMF by sonication for 20 min. Then, 0.49 g FDCA was added to the above mixture and sonicated for another 10 min. Thereafter, 9 mL acetic acid was added and further sonicated for 20 min. After that, the Teflon-lined pressure reactor was putted into oven at 120 °C for 12 h. Finally, the precipitate was filtered, washed once with DMF and twice with ethanol, and dried in vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA over a 2θ range of 0°–80° at a scanning speed of 10°/min. FTIR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer 1710 spectrometer (KBr disk) in wavenumber range of 500–4000 cm−1. SEM analysis and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) were performed on a QUANTA250 field emission scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. TEM images were collected using a Tecnai G2 20 with elemental mapping of catalysts. Surface area was determined from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms in liquid nitrogen on a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 instrument, using the BET method. The basic/acidic properties were determined through temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 (NH3/CO2-TPD) by a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 equipment. The zirconium content was determined by an Agilent 725 ICP-OES. XPS analysis was conducted by using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer with a base pressure of 2 × 10−9 mbar and an X-ray source (15 kV, 10 mA). A monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.8 eV) was employed. TG analysis was performed on a TA Q500 instrument."
5,Catalytic activity tests,"2.4 Catalytic activity tests The reactions were carried out in a 50 mL cylindrical stainless-steel reactor (Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd., China) with the external temperature and stirring controller. In a typical procedure, a mixture of FAL (0.3 g), catalyst (0.1 g) and isopropanol (20 mL) were loaded into the reactor. The reactor was sealed and heated to the desired temperature for a prescript duration with stirring at 300 rpm. After reaction, the reactor was taken out and cooled to room temperature in a water bath. The spent catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, washed thoroughly with DMF and ethanol, dried at 105 °C prior to the next cycle. The filtrate collected after the reaction was qualitatively determined by using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Thermofisher Trace 1300 and ISQ LT) fitted with a TR-5 MS column (15 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The quantitative analysis of liquid product was conducted on an Agilent GC-7820 series with a HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The concentrations of FAL and FOL were calculated by using a standard curve based on known concentration of these compounds. FAL conversion (C FAL , %), FOL yield (Y FOL , %) and the moderate formation rate of FOL (Y rate , μmol/g.h) were calculated according to the following equations (1)–(3): (1) C F A L ( mol % ) = ( 1 − m o l o f F A L i n p r o d u c t s m o l o f F A l i n s u b s t r a t e ) × 100 (2) Y F O L ( mol % ) = m o l o f F O L i n p r o d u c t s m o l o f F A L i n s u b s t r a t e × 100 (3) Y r a t e = m o l o f f o r m e d F O L c a t a l y s t a m o u n t × t i m e × 100"
6,Recycling and leaching tests,"2.5 Recycling and leaching tests For recycling test, the solid catalyst (Zr-FDCA hybrid) dispersed in the reaction mixture was separated by filtration after reaction, and successively washed with DMF and ethanol. After dried at 105 °C for 12 h and directly used for the next cycle. In the leaching experiment, the catalyst was filtered out from the reaction system after reacting for 45 min at 120 °C, and the reaction was continued to 180 min in the absence of catalyst under the identical reaction conditions. The content of zirconium leached into the reaction mixture was analyzed by ICP-OSE."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization To clarify the structure of the prepared catalyst and gain insight into the properties of Zr-FDCA hybrid, and verify whether it can be a good catalyst for CTH of FAL to FOL, Zr-FDCA hybrid was analyzed by means of different characterization methods. It can be clearly observed from XRD patterns (Fig. 1 ) that Zr-FDCA hybrid was amorphous owing to a few broad diffraction peaks, this is distinctly different from FDCA, which had high crystallinity and clear crystal lattice. It was worth noting that Zr-FDCA hybrid showed clear and intense peak at 2θ ≈ 8.0°, indicating that the original FDCA crystal structure was destroyed and new connections between zirconium and FDCA were formed, which displayed a structure similar to the typical (111) reflection of UiO-66(Zr) [29]. Furthermore, the functional group variations of FDCA and Zr-FDCA hybrid at 500-4000 cm−1 were confirmed by FTIR. As shown in Fig. 2 , FDCA displayed typical peaks of furan ring: 1) the peaks at 763, 852 and 962 cm−1 were ascribed to the out-of-plane bending vibration of = C–H; 2) the in-plane bending vibration of = C–H appeared at 1188 and 1039 cm−1; 3) the peaks at 1574 and 1523 cm−1 were identified as the stretching vibration of C=C; 4) the asymmetric stretching vibration of C–O occurred at 1230 and 1165 cm−1. In addition, the typical peaks of carboxyl group were the stretching vibration of the C=O, the stretching vibration of C–O and the in-plane bending of the O–H, which appeared at 1700, 1419, and 1250 cm−1, respectively [30]. For fresh Zr-FDCA hybrid, the typical peaks of furan ring (e.g., the out-of-plane bending vibration of = C–H at 780, 852 and 970 cm−1; the in-plane bending vibration of = C–H at 1169 and 1020 cm−1; the asymmetric stretching vibration of C–O at 1230 and 1165 cm−1) still existed, the shifts of these typical peaks of furan ring were caused by the introduction of zirconium. The in-plane bending of O–H at 1250 cm−1 disappeared, and a new absorption peak at 650 cm−1 was observed, revealing the new linkage of Zr–O in Zr-FDCA hybrid. In addition, Zr-FDCA hybrid displayed the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the –CO2- group at 1377 and 1581 cm−1, respectively [23]. And a splitting of approximately 204 cm−1 between these two peaks proved that the bridging coordination mode of zirconium to FDCA rather than mon dentate and bidentate modes, which displayed a typical structure of UiO-66 (Zr) [29]. The morphology and microstructure of Zr-FDCA hybrid were further confirmed by SEM and TEM. The typical SEM images (Fig. 3 A and B) showed that Zr-FDCA hybrid had a rough, porous and irregular granular structure, which composed of relatively uniform nanoparticles with a wide dispersion of particle sizes between 10 nm and 50 nm. Except several worm-like stripes owing to the disordered interlayers of Zr-FDCA hybrid, no clear and regular lattice planes were observed in TEM image (Fig. 3C), indicating that the growth of nanoparticles was not highly crystalline, which is consistent with the XRD results. Additionally, the corresponding elemental mappings from HAADF (Fig. 3D) clearly confirmed that the elements of Zr, O and C evenly distributed throughout the Zr-FDCA hybrid, indicating that the spatial arrangement of Zr, O and C in the whole coordination complex was uniform. The pore structure properties of FDCA and Zr-FDCA hybrid were determined through typical nitrogen physical adsorption and desorption experiments, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be observed that FDCA did not show an evident saturated adsorption platform, however, Zr-FDCA hybrid displayed the typical IV-type isotherm with obvious adsorption-desorption hysteresis loop, indicating that the obtained Zr-FDCA hybrid was Micro mesoporous structure. Furthermore, according to N2 adsorption/desorption calculation (shown in Table 1 ), the pristine FDCA had low surface area (14.6 m2/g), pore volume (0.06 cm3/g) and average pore diameter (4.9 nm). When Zr4+ was introduced and coordinated with FDCA, the prepared Zr-FDCA displayed good pore structure properties with high surface area (187.6 m2/g), pore volume (0.21 cm3/g) and average pore diameter (5.4 nm). Although the surface properties of Zr-FDCA are much lower than those of the typical MOF (entry 3, Table 1), it has similar surface properties of among MOF-like hybrids (entries 4–7, Table 1). To get more insights toward understanding the positive effect of acetic acid on the improvement of acidity and basicity for the prepared material, Zr-FDCA hybrid was determined by temperature programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2. As shown in Fig. 5 , Zr-FDCA hybrid showed coexistence of weak and moderate acid-base sites, the desorption peak at 235 °C (Fig. 5a) was related to weak basic center, two main desorption peaks at 120 and 250 °C (Fig. 5b) were attributed to the coexistence of weak acidic sites and medium strength acidic sites. According to the calculation results of Fig. 5, the acidity and basicity of Zr-FDCA hybrid was summarized in Table 1. It is gratifying that the prepared Zr-FDCA hybrid displayed extremely high Lewis acidity (5.83 mmol/g) and basicity (3.79 mmol/g). To our delight, the acidity and basicity of fresh Zr-FDCA hybrid were significantly higher than those of typical reported MOF materials and metal-organic hybrids (Table 1), which are favorable for the CTH reduction. Moreover, the bonding configurations and chemical coordination states of Zr-FDCA hybrid were uncovered by XPS, taking into accounts that the local environment of metal ion and oxygen anion are generally associated with Lewis acidity and basicity. The survey spectra shown in Fig. 6 a attested the successful incorporation of zirconium ions in Zr-FDCA hybrid. Fig. 6b showed that the spectrum of C1s can be fitted into three peaks, which were assigned to C–C (284.6 eV), C–O (286.3 eV) and C=O (287.5 eV), respectively [33]. Fig. 6c uncovered that Zr 3d spectrum of Zr-FDCA exhibited an intense doublet centered at 182.8 and 185.1 eV, which were assigned to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2, respectively. And a splitting of 2.3 eV between the two peaks of normalized Zr 3d band symbolized the characteristic peak of the tetravalent zirconium [34]. Zr-FDCA hybrid had higher binding energies of Zr 3d than those of ZrO2 (182.1 and 184.4 eV), therefore, Zr-FDCA had relative higher positive charge and thus resulting in higher acidity [35]. The O 1s spectrum showed a main peak with a maximum binding energy of 532.3 eV, which was related to the single bonded oxygen of C–O–C, it was higher than that of ZrO2 (531.4 eV), indicating a relative higher basicity (Fig. 6d). All these results indicated that Zr and O exhibited higher charges contributing to higher Lewis acid and base strengths, which was beneficial to activate the carbonyl group and decompose the hydroxyl group of isopropanol, so that Zr-FDCA hybrid showed high catalytic activity in CTH of FAL to FOL [25]. Based on the above results and some previous reports, we propose that the reason for the better pore structure properties of Zr-FDCA hybrid is due to the addition of acetic acid, which can create larger pore size and defect and thus expose more active sites [36]. The possible mechanism of defect generation by acetic acid as a modulator is shown in Scheme 1 , acetic acid and FDCA mainly coordinate with zirconium in a competitive form. Deprotonated acetic acids form clusters with zirconium firstly, and then compete with carboxyl groups after the addition of FDCA. As FDCA has two carboxyl groups and lower pKa value, FDCA can form a more stable connection with zirconium, therefore, the weakly bonded clusters between deprotonated acetic acids and zirconium metals are dissociated and acetic acids are released from the system. The migration of acetic acids makes the prepared material form a defective structure, which can expose more zirconium and thus get a functional material with high Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity. Finally, TG was used to investigate weight loss behavior of FDCA and Zr-FDCA hybrid at 50–600 °C. As shown in Fig. 7 , TG curve of FDCA displayed extremely low stability, it can be observed that FDCA had a cliff-like weight loss at about 250 °C, which may be due to the decomposition, and only 8.2% of weight was remained at 600 °C. However, for Zr-FDCA hybrid, a small weight loss of 14% was observed before 210 °C which was attributed to the decomposition of adsorbed and bound water, significant weight loss to 40% at 430 °C was mainly related to the combustion of organic residues (such as DMF) in the pores [37]. After temperature reached to 430 °C, the catalyst gradually stabilized without being accompanied by more significant deactivation behavior, indicating that the self-assembled metal-organic system had relatively higher stability compared to a single organic molecule."
9,Catalytic activity tests,"3.2 Catalytic activity tests It can be inferred from the characterization that Zr-FDCA hybrid had considerable Lewis acidity and basicity which were key factors for CTH reduction, therefore, Zr-FDCA hybrid was applied to transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL by using isopropanol as solvent and hydrogen donor, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . No significant conversion of FAL was observed in the absence of catalyst (entry 1, Table 2). When FDCA was used as catalyst, only 10% of FAL conversion was obtained without any FOL yield (entry 2, Table 2), indicating that FDCA does not have the catalytic hydrogenation activity. While Zr(NO3)4·5H2O was added as catalyst, a sharp increase of FAL conversion (100%) and FOL yield (99.0%) was observed, demonstrating that the zirconium species have a catalytic effect to promote transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL (entry 3, Table 2). To test the effect of water on this reaction, we did a comparison test by adding an extra amount of water (5 μL) into the reaction system based on reaction 3 in Table 2 and found that FAL conversion and FOL yield remained almost unchanged, therefore, we believed that changes produced by trace amounts of water did not significantly affect the reaction. Whereas, the low recoverability limits its direct application, thus, loading zirconium ions to natural organic molecule to synthesis a more stable catalyst is always needed. Therefore, a mesoporous acid-base bifunctional nanohybrid from zirconium and FDCA by using acetic acid as the modulator was prepared in the present work. As can be observed that Zr-FDCA hybrid was endowed with high catalytic activity, 100% conversion of FAL and 99.0% yield of FOL with 3500 μmol/g‧h of Y rate were obtained (entry 4, Table 2). In addition, it can be found that acetone was generated during the CTH of FAL to FOL (Table 2 and Fig. S2), indicating that the conversion of FAL to FOL was accompanied by the dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone, this result is consistent with the reported literature [38]. To optimize the reaction conditions and then obtain a better understanding about the reaction kinetics and mechanism on the catalytic reduction of FAL to FOL, a series of FAL hydrogenations were carried out at different reaction temperatures and times, and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . Based on the product analysis of preliminary experiments by using GC-MS (Fig. S1), it can be found that the main product was FOL due to the high selectivity of Zr-FDCA. The FAL conversion was only 6.3% at 120 °C in 0 min (all the reactions begin to time when a specific temperature was reached), the highest FAL conversion of 100% was obtained at 150 °C in 2 h. Accordingly, a 10.9% yield of FOL was obtained at 120 °C in 0 min, and the highest FOL yield reached 100% at 150 °C in 3 h. Take an intermediate value (at 120 and 150 °C for 30 min) to observe the variation of trend, the FAL conversion and FOL yield increased from 32.2% and 37.4% to 88.8% and 83.4% respectively in 30 min with the temperature increasing from 120 to 150 °C, the time to reach equilibrium decreased from 240 to 90 min. Both FAL conversion and FOL yield presented a gradual increase trend until equilibrium, the FAL conversion and FOL yield were increased by increasing of reaction temperature or extension of time, the time to reach balance reduced with elevated reaction temperature. Thereby, FOL yield can be improved by manipulating the appropriate reaction conditions. Based on the above reaction calculation results, the catalytic conversion of FAL to FOL over Zr-FDCA in the presence of isopropanol can be regarded as a simple first order reaction because of the high selectivity of the catalyst, as, (4) d C F A L d t = − k 1 C F A L (5) d C F O L d t = k 1 C F A L The experimental results were then fitted to these equations, the apparent activation energy of E 1 was 63.400 kJ/mol (Fig. S3). In addition, the correlation between the predicted and measure data is presented in Fig. S4, a good correlation can be obtained with R2 > 0.90, indicating that the established kinetic model can effectively monitor the hydrogenation of FAL to FOL over Zr-FDCA and selectively obtain the target product by tailoring the process conditions."
10,Heterogeneity and recycling experiments,"3.3 Heterogeneity and recycling experiments The stability and recyclability of catalyst are essential indexes to evaluate the stability of catalysts, which is of great significance to the industrial production of catalyst. To demonstrate the heterogeneity of the catalyst, two parallel experiments with or without Zr-FDCA were carried out at 120 °C, the FOL yield remained at the same level after removing Zr-FDCA at 45 min, indicating that no active ingredient catalyzed the reaction (Fig. 9 A). The leaching concentration of zirconium analyzed by ICP analysis was less than 1.0 ppm, suggesting no dissolution of active species and Zr-FDCA was heterogeneous. The recyclability of Zr-FDCA was examined under specified reaction conditions to observe the changes of FAL conversion and FOL yield (Fig. 9B). A satisfactory catalytic activity was maintained after five consecutive cycles with 94.3% of FAL conversion and 93.4% of FOL yield, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the recycled Zr-FDCA hybrid were further analyzed by means of different characterization methods. Though the acidic/basic properties (Fig. S5) and pore structure (Fig. S6a) varied slightly due to the occupation of the pore channels or agglomeration among Zr-FDCA hybrids. And a slight loss of zirconium also resulted in a slight decrease in acidity of the recycled Zr-FDCA hybrid (Table S1), the increase of basicity in the recycled hybrid was attributed to the adsorbed basic organic matter during TPD analysis (Table S2). Satisfactorily, the almost identical structure, connections and thermal stability of the recycled Zr-FDCA hybrid than those of fresh one was observed from the XRD patterns, FTIR spectra and TG curves (Figs. S6b–d). The XPS results also revealed that C 1s, Zr 3d and O 1s had the same binding energies in fresh and recycled Zr-FDCA (Fig. S7), indicating that the chemical environment was not changed. As a result, the perfect recyclability of the prepared Zr-FDCA hybrid was observed, which was mainly due to its high thermal and chemical stability."
11,Proposed mechanism for CTH of FAL to FOL over Zr-FDCA,"3.4 Proposed mechanism for CTH of FAL to FOL over Zr-FDCA As described above, Lewis acid sites (Zr4+) and Lewis base sites (O2−) generated in the coordination of zirconium with active functional groups in FDCA played an essential role in the transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL [7]. On the basis of experimental results (Table 2 and Fig. 8) and GC-MS results (Fig. S1), the possible reaction mechanism for CTH of FAL to FOL through Lewis acid and base sites was proposed. As shown in Scheme 2 , isopropanol was firstly adsorbed by the active center Zr4+−O2− in Zr-FDCA and connected with active center to form an intermediate bound with zirconium (step 1). Subsequently, Zr-bound intermediate was connected with FAL, activating carbonyl group by Zr4+ for transfer hydrogenation. The electron rich oxygen on the carbonyl group of FAL coordinated with the electron-deficient Zr4+ site on the other active center, forming a hydride with six chain structure intermediate (step 2). The active center Zr4+−O2− acted as a bridge between FAL and isopropanol, enabling the transfer of hydrogen protons. Then, acetone was released as a byproduct to form an intermediate. The generated intermediate was attacked continuously by isopropanol to obtain FOL (step 4) and the active center of Zr-FDCA was released and entered the next reaction cycle (step 5)."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, a mesoporous hybrid of Zr-FDCA was synthesized though self-assembly of Zr(NO3)4·5H2O and FDCA by using acetic acid as the modulator. The addition of acetic acid did significantly increase the Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity, which contributed to a great application prospect in CTH of FAL to FOL, excellent activity (100% yield of FOL) and selectivity (100%) were obtained at 150 °C in 3 h. The as-synthesized hybrid could be reused at least five times without substantial change in catalytic activity due to its high thermal and chemical stability. A kinetic model to describe CTH of FAL to FOL was established with a good correlation (R2 > 0.90) between the measured and predicted data, which can effectively monitor the CTH reduction and selectively obtain the target product by tailoring the process conditions. This prepared hybrid displayed some advantages over those reported catalysts, such as the mesoporous structure, high Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity, excellent catalytic activity, fine catalyst recyclability, and the implementation of a green and sustainable route."
