0,Introduction,"The worldwide development and growth in population provoke a rapid increase in energy consumption. The depletion of non-renewable fossil energy results in detrimental environmental issues and global warming. Therefore, there is a pressing requirement to explore sustainable and carbon-neutral clean energy [1–3]. Hydrogen (H2), regarded as a promising renewable green energy due to its high energy capacity and environmental friendliness without carbon emission, plays an important role in solving global energy and environment crisis [4–6]. At present, the industrial production of H2 mainly originates from steam reforming of fossil fuels (methane or coal). As one of the most effective techniques, steam reforming not only requires high pressure and high temperature to achieve a relatively good catalytic performance, but also gives rise to the follow-up complex purification of H2 [7–9]. Therefore, developing clean and efficient technology for H2 generation is extremely important to meet the future global energy demands [10]. Electrocatalytic water splitting, an ideal way to produce high-purity H2 with non-pollution from clean and recyclable energy sources [11,12]. Conventional electrocatalytic water splitting involves two half-cell reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [13]. Unfortunately, a considerable overpotential is commonly required to produce H2 due to the sluggish kinetics of anodic OER. Although many marvelous electrocatalysts have been developed to achieve intriguing OER activities, OER still demands a much higher overpotential to match up with the rate of HER, leading to low overall energy conversion efficiency [12,14]. Moreover, the less valuable product of OER, O2 is generally responsible for the major energy loss of water electrolysis. In addition, the simultaneous production of H2 and O2 are likely to be explosive [15,16]. To avoid the high and unnecessary overpotential of OER, more readily oxidized molecules such as alcohols [17–27], hydrazine [28–30], urea [31–33], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [34–36], and furfural [37] are employed for electrochemical oxidation reaction to replace OER to achieve energy-saving H2 production. Among these readily oxidized molecules, methanol (MeOH) as the simplest alcohol has low cost and huge production capacity [38,39]. Electrocatalysts play key roles in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Pt-based materials are the most used electrocatalysts for MOR with high activity [26,27,40,41]. To reduce the cost of electrocatalysts, lots of efforts are also dedicated to develop non-noble metal electrodes such as nickel-based materials [20,42–44]. Over the electrocatalysts, MeOH is usually oxidized to valueless CO2 greenhouse gas in fuel cells to generate power or in electrochemical reformer to produce H2 [42,45–47]. On the other hand, MeOH is also an important C1 raw materials to produce chemicals, for example formic acid (HCOOH) or formate [48]. The price of HCOOH (about 539 € per ton) is much higher than that of MeOH (about 350 € per ton) [49–51]. Currently, HCOOH is industrially produced from MeOH under complex operation and harsh terms even using CO poisonous gas. Thus, it is significant to obtain valuable HCOOH or formate by selective electrochemical oxidation of MeOH. Furthermore, combination of this selective reaction with water electrolysis could not only reduce the voltage of water splitting and improve the efficiency of H2 evolution at the cathode, but also generate high value-added product at the anode to replace CO2. To realize the unique combined reactions, it is important to develop efficient electrocatalysts for selective MOR and HER [20–22]. The electrocatalysts are also expected with low cost and simple preparation method. Herein, Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays are in situ grown on Ni foam (NF) via very simple HCl acid solution ultrasonic immersing and drying treatment. The as-prepared materials are used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for simultaneous HER and selective oxidation of MeOH to co-generate value-added H2 and formate in MeOH-water solution. A low cell voltage of only 1.52 V is required to realize a current density of 10 mA cm−2 over nickel-based nanosheet arrays bifunctional catalysts."
1,Experimental section,
2,Material synthesis,"2.1 Material synthesis 2.1.1 Chemicals and materials All chemicals used in this study were in analytical reagent (AR) grade without any further purification. Deionized (DI) water with specific resistance of 18.2 MΩ⋅cm was used in all experiments. Chemicals of methanol and HCl were purchased from Xilong Company (China). Potassium hydroxide (KOH) was purchased from Macklin Company (China). Macroporous Ni foam substrate (80 ppi; mass density of 320 g⋅ m−2) was purchased from Liyuan New Materials Company (China). 2.1.2 Preparation of Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays A facile method has been developed to prepare Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam (NF) via an ultrasonic treatment in 5 wt% HCl solution for 30 min. The product material was rinsed with distilled water and dried in vacuum oven (40 °C) for overnight. The ultimate product is named as Ni(OH)2/NF. Control experiments were also conducted for comparison, the products were denoted as a-b-c-d (a means HCl concentration; b means rinse with water or ethanol; c means dried in vacuum or air; d means dried temperature). For example, 5% -H2O-vacuum-40 means that the material was obtained by ultrasonic treatment in 5 wt% HCl, rinsed with distilled water and dried in 40 °C vacuum oven."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The morphology was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi SU-70 system) with accelerating voltages of 5−15 kV equipped with an energy disperse spectrum (EDS). The microstructure observation was performed by field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using Bruker D8 Advance (Cu Kα, 50 kV and 360 mA) in the range of 2θ from 20° to 80° with step size of 0.01° using a scanning rate of 5° min−1 at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on PHI5000 VersaProbe and all the peaks were calibrated with C 1s spectrum at binding energy of 284.8 eV."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical HER, OER and MOR activity tests were conducted on CHI 760E electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode configuration. Ni(OH)2/NF or NF (0.5 cm × 2 cm) was used as working electrode and Hg/HgO electrode was used as reference electrode. For the choice of counter electrode, a Pt sheet (1 cm × 1 cm) was used as counter electrode in OER and MOR while a graphite rod was used in the case of HER to avoid potential contamination. The electrolyte was 1 M KOH (pH 13.8) with different concentrations of MeOH. The linear scans were collected with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The ohmic drop was determined from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and was compensated manually. EIS was performed with the working electrode at 0.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO) while the frequency was swept from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with a sinusoidal voltage amplitude of 5 mV. Electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) could be calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the potential range from 0 to 0.1 V (vs. Hg/HgO), with different scan rates of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 mV s−1. Current density differences (Δj= j a- j c) at 0.05 V (vs. Hg/HgO) were plotted against scan rates, the linear slope was used to represent ECSAs, which is twice of the double layer capacitance (Cdl). For two-electrode system, Ni(OH)2/NF nanosheet arrays or NF were employed as cathode and anode. For the stability test of two-electrode electrolysis, the potential to reach a current density of 20 mA cm−2 was monitored for 15 h in 40 mL 1.0 M KOH with 500 mM MeOH. All the potentials were corrected to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following equation: (1) E (RHE) = E (Hg/HgO) + 0.059 pH + 0.098 The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was calculated based on the following equation: (2) FE % = mole of product produced × n × F total charge passed × 100 % Where n is the number of electrons transferred for formate formation (n = 4) and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1)."
5,Products analysis,"2.4 Products analysis The gaseous products were analyzed on-line by a gas chromatograph (9790Plus, Fuli), which is equipped with the thermal conductivity detector and a 5 A molecular sieve column using argon as the carrier gas. The identification and quantification of formate were performed by ion chromatography (IC) on Qingdao Shenghan Chromatograph (CIC-D120) at room temperature. After certain number of charges were passed, 100 μL of the electrolyte solution was withdrawn and diluted with 7900 μL DI Water. The IC was equipped with a SH-AC-3 column. Eluent was 2.4 mM Na2CO3 and 6 mM NaHCO3 aqueous solution. An injection volume of 1 mL was applied and the identification/concentration of formate were determined from calibration curves of known concentrations of commercially purchased compounds. Meanwhile, the composition of the anodic product was verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz). For this, 100 μL of the electrolyte solution was directly transferred into 5-mm NMR tubes and the volume was completed to 500 μL with D2O containing 2 wt% DMSO."
6,Density functional theory calculations,2.5 Density functional theory calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to uncover the mechanism of selective oxidation of MeOH. Spin-polarized DFT based calculations have been carried out using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The electronic exchange and correlation effects were taken into account using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The computational details are given in the Supporting Information.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphology of Ni(OH)2/NF nanosheet arrays,"3.1 Morphology of Ni(OH)2/NF nanosheet arrays Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of untreated Ni foam (NF) in different magnifications (Fig. 1 a and b) demonstrate that the surface of pristine NF is smooth without impurity or attachment. Compared with the pristine NF, a well-covered layer is observed on the surface of NF in the as-prepared material (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d displays a nanostructure assembled by well-interconnected nanosheet arrays. These nanosheet arrays are stacked on top of each other with different voids, which is advantageous for the interaction with reactants. The ultrathin nanosheet is about 10 nm in thickness. The EDS analysis of the nanosheet arrays demonstrates the uniform dispersion of Ni and O without impurity (Fig. 1e). The TEM image of the material scraped from NF surface (Fig. 1f) confirms the nanosheet arrays morphology, which is in good agreement with the FESEM images. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows a set of diffraction dots, corresponding to the (210) and (110) planes of Ni(OH)2, respectively, which implies that the surface species is Ni(OH)2. The FESEM image of the side shot of the as-prepared material in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information) shows that the thickness of the hydroxide film layer (the vertical nanosheet height) on the NF is about 100 nm. The acid concentrations and oxidation process have critical effects on the morphological evolution of the as-prepared material. As shown in Fig. 2 a and 2b, neither of NF etched by 1 wt% HCl and 10 wt% HCl solution is able to form the nanosheet arrays structure. Only uneven bumps are produced by 1 wt% HCl solution. The bumps are smaller and denser in the case of NF etched by 10 wt% HCl solution. Only small islands on the surface are found after acidic treatment and rinsed with ethanol (Fig. 2c), whereas large nanosheet wrinkles are observed with drying in air (Fig. 2d). The nanosheets are in different scales with drying temperatures of 70 and 100 °C, respectively (Fig. 2e and f). The schematic illustration for the formation of the porous nanosheet arrays is proposed in Fig. S2 based on aforementioned. With the assistance of ultrasonic, NF undergoes “molting” in an acid solution and obtains a high energy surface with the assistance of ultrasonic to remove any oxidized species on the surface. NF reacts with the residual water on its surface to form nanosheet arrays slowly and spontaneously at low temperature. The surface chemical state of the as-prepared material and NF are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3 a displays high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p for the as-prepared material and NF samples. For NF, the peaks at 854.0 eV and 856.0 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2 of NiO multiplet-split peaks while the peak at 852.5 eV is assigned to metallic Ni. As shown in Fig. 3b, the O 1s XPS spectra can be divided into three peaks, in which the first peak at 529.3 eV is associated with the lattice oxygen (Ni-O), the second peak at 531.2 eV is assigned to the Ni-OH, and the third peak at 532.7 eV is attributed to the absorbed water, consistent with reports on Ni(OH)2 [52,53]. In contrast, for the as-prepared material by the treatment of NF, the peak intensity in Fig. 3a related to the metallic Ni is reduced due to the surface layers covered on the Ni skeleton. Moreover, no characteristic peak corresponding to NiO can be seen for the as-prepared material. The spectral profile at higher binding energy is highly similar to the obtained Ni(OH)2 sample, confirming the existence of Ni(OH)2 at the surface. In Fig. 3b, the absence of Ni-O in XPS spectra of O 1s also implies that there is no existence of NiO. Furthermore, argon ion beam etching is carried out to obtain a depth profile of this material. As shown in Fig. S3a, with the increase of etching depth, the signal for Ni(OH)2 in the Ni 2p XPS spectra decreases successively, whereas the content of metallic Ni increases gradually. Moreover, for the O 1s XPS spectra in Fig. S3b, the ratio of Ni-OH to the total oxygen is 96%, whereas the ratio of Ni-O to the total oxygen was just 4%. The predominant surface coverage of Ni−OH gives a solid evidence that Ni(OH)2 is constructed on the metallic Ni substrate. After etching, the ratio of Ni−OH decreases to 77% and the ratio of Ni-O increases to 23%, because Ni(OH)2 is gradually etched away, thus exposing the NF substrate. From TEM and XPS, we can definitely confirm the as-prepared material by the treatment of NF is Ni(OH)2/NF. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is carried out for phase analysis. However, only three strong diffraction peaks of the Ni without the observation of any diffraction peaks of Ni(OH)2 are found from the XRD patterns of Ni(OH)2/NF and NF (Fig. S4). This is because the surface Ni(OH)2 species is too little, and the signal of which is overlapped by the NF substrate [54–56]. The unobserved Ni(OH)2 XRD curve further indicates that the Ni(OH)2 film is very thin on NF. The Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays which are formed on NF in a facile method spontaneously for the first time. Compared with the drop-coated catalysts, the in situ formed catalyst is more stable without samples falling off. The porous nanosheet arrays with large surface area are favorable for mass diffusion and transportation, which makes a significant contribution to catalytic activity."
9,Electrocatalytic performance in water solution,"3.2 Electrocatalytic performance in water solution Initially, the electrocatalytic performance for HER, OER and MOR is primarily evaluated using three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 4 a, Ni(OH)2/NF demonstrates a catalytic activity for HER with an overpotential of 185 mV to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much less than that of NF (228 mV). The corresponding Tafel slopes are calculated to evaluate the reaction kinetics in the electrochemical process (Fig. 4b). The Tafel slope of Ni(OH)2/NF is 75.3 mV dec−1, which is much lower than that of NF (112.4 mV dec−1) indicative of the more favorable HER on Ni(OH)2/NF. The OER catalytic performance of Ni(OH)2/NF is illustrated in Fig. 4c. It only requires 1.52 V to drive the current density of 100 mA cm−2 for Ni(OH)2/NF whereas 1.61 V is needed for NF at the same current density, suggesting a superior OER catalytic performance of Ni(OH)2/NF relative to the NF substrate. Notably, an oxidation peak of Ni(II) to Ni(III) in Ni(OH)2/NF is observed, which agrees with the previous report [57]. To obtain insights into the intrinsic activity of catalysts, the double-layer capacitances (Cdl) are measured to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of catalysts (Fig. 4d and 4f). The Ni(OH)2/NF possesses a Cdl value of 2.32 m F cm−2, which is larger than that of NF (1.42 m F cm−2), owing to the more active sites and porous structure of the Ni(OH)2/NF. Thus, the Ni(OH)2/NF with nanosheet arrays could not only bring abundant active centers but also favor the penetration of the electrolyte into the interior structure, which is advantageous for electrolysis."
10,Electrocatalytic performance in MeOH-water solution,"3.3 Electrocatalytic performance in MeOH-water solution Although overpotential of OER on Ni(OH)2/NF decreases compared with that of NF, the higher driving potential still results in high energy consumption. More importantly, the O2 products from anodic OER is valueless. Thus, MOR is further used to replace the anodic OER. As seen from Fig. 5 a, when MeOH is added into the electrolyte, the oxidation potential on Ni(OH)2/NF is significantly reduced. By increasing MeOH concentration, the anodic oxidation potential to achieve 100 mA cm−2 current density is gradually decreasing. The oxidation potential reaches only 1.36 V to obtain the current density of 100 mA cm−2 with addition of 500 mM MeOH in the aqueous electrolyte solution. Nonetheless, imperceptible negative shift of the oxidation potential is found with further increasing concentration of MeOH. This might be because the adsorption of the oxidation products at the electrode surface hinders further oxidation reactions. Thus, the concentration of MeOH is optimized of 500 mM in this work. As shown in Fig. 5b, by comparison of the anodic oxidation potential to achieve certain current densities (10 mA cm−2, 20 mA cm−2, 50 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2) on Ni(OH)2/NF and NF in 1.0 M KOH with and without 500 mM MeOH, a conclusion is drawn as per the below. Although the anodic oxidation potential of NF decreases after MeOH is added as well, it is still not as good as Ni(OH)2/NF. No matter for OER or MOR, Ni(OH)2/NF is better than NF. In comparison with the high oxidation potential without MeOH (1.52 V), the Ni(OH)2/NF exhibits excellent performance in MOR. The catalytic activity of Ni(OH)2/NF and NF for MOR were tested after performing 2000 cycles of CV scans from 1.1 V to 1.7 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH with 500 mM MeOH. As displayed in Fig. S5, CV curves change only 6 mV after 2000 cycles, which is likely due to the consumption of MeOH and the change of pH in the electrolyte after the long-term reaction. Even though the pristine NF also generates electroactive hydroxide layers in the alkaline media, the performance of MOR is still unsatisfactory. The difference in oxidation potential between Ni(OH)2/NF and NF at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 is about 72 mV. Moreover, the FESEM images of NF after 2000 cycles of CV in Fig. S6 show that no porous structure was formed on the surface of NF. The result strongly confirms that the obvious enhancement of MOR activity of Ni(OH)2/NF is attributed to its unique porous structure. To unveil the MOR kinetics over Ni(OH)2/NF, the Tafel slope for MOR is also shown in Fig. 5c. The derived Tafel slope of Ni(OH)2/NF in 500 mM MeOH aqueous solution is 17.6 mV dec−1, which is much lower than that in MeOH-free electrolyte (50.5 mV dec−1). In contrast, the derived Tafel slope of NF with and without 500 mM MeOH are 51.7 mV dec−1 and 30.4 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. S7). The smaller Tafel slope of Ni(OH)2/NF in two situations suggests faster catalytic kinetic of Ni(OH)2/NF than pristine NF. Moreover, with the addition of 500 mM MeOH, the Cdl value is raised from 2.32 m F cm−2 to 3.66 m F cm−2, indicating that Ni(OH)2/NF has more active sites to react with MeOH (Fig. 5d and 5e). In addition, Nyquist plots based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is also carried out. The smaller semicircle radius gives a smaller vale of charge transfer resistance (Rct), which means a faster charge-transfer process. As displayed in Fig. S8, the Rct for Ni(OH)2/NF is 7.9 Ω cm−2, which is much smaller than that of pure NF (37.9 Ω cm−2) in OER. The smaller Rct for Ni(OH)2/NF implies that the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays are beneficial for the faradaic process and thus improves the catalytic reaction kinetics. Surprisingly, since MOR is used as the replacement for OER, the Rct for Ni(OH)2/NF is 0.78 Ω cm−2 (Fig. 5f), which is ten-fold smaller than that without MeOH (7.9 Ω cm−2). The extremely low resistance means a faster charge-transfer process of Ni(OH)2/NF for MOR than for OER. Therefore, the Ni(OH)2/NF could be utilized as efficient electrocatalyst for MOR."
11,Co-electrolysis in MeOH-water solution,"3.4 Co-electrolysis in MeOH-water solution Based on the remarkable catalytic performance for HER and MOR, Ni(OH)2/NF is used as bifunctional electrocatalytic electrode to construct a MeOH-water solution electrolyser in the two-electrode system. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. S9. From the LSV polarization curves in Fig. S10, no negative impact on the HER activity can be found for Ni(OH)2/NF after the addition of 500 mM MeOH in the electrolyte. Therefore, coupling HER and MOR over the Ni(OH)2/NF electrode, a hybrid water electrolysis device is proposed in 1.0 M KOH with MeOH. As shown in Fig. S11, the concentration of MeOH greatly affects the MOR||HER behavior of Ni(OH)2/NF electrode in the combined two-electrode system. The optimal decomposition voltage is attained by the addition of 500 mM MeOH, which is consistent with the aforementioned results in the three-electrode system. To reach current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, the electrolysis in MeOH-water solution requires cell voltages of 1.52 V and 1.62 V, respectively, whereas much higher cell voltages (1.70 and 1.79 V) are desired in the electrolyte without MeOH (Fig. 6 a), indicative of the superior cell efficiency of the MeOH-water solution electrolysis. By contrast, 1.68 V and 1.80 V are needed to reach the current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2 by NF for the electrolysis in MeOH-water solution (Fig. S12). This significant difference reveals that Ni(OH)2/NF offers significant kinetic advantage in MeOH-water solution electrolyte. As illustrated in Fig. 6b, only slight decrease of the current density is found using Ni(OH)2/NF for 15 h long-term test in the two-electrode system, which demonstrats that Ni(OH)2/NF is a bifunctional electrocatalyst with acceptable durability. Noticeably, H2 bubbles can be clearly seen on the surface of Ni(OH)2/NF cathode, while there is no bubble observed on the Ni(OH)2/NF anode during the chronoamperometry test at the applied potential of 1.56 V (the inset in Fig. 6b). With the applied voltage increases, the cathode produces more bubbles. Moreover, no bubble is observed at the anode, even with the current density reached 100 mA cm−2 (See Video in Supplementary Information). This indicates that MOR is more preferable than OER on the anode in the two-electrode system. To identify the oxidation products and to calculate the corresponding Faradaic efficiency (FE), the electrolysis in MeOH-water solution catalyzed by Ni(OH)2/NF is performed at current densities of 10, 20, 40, 100 mA cm−2, respectively. The liquid samples are collected after passing each certain charges of 25, 50 and 100 C, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum confirms the generation of formate in the electrolysis products (Fig. S13). Ion chromatography (IC) is used for further verification and quantification of formate (Fig. S14). The FE of formate is calculated based on the total charges at current density of 20 mA cm−2, as Fig. 6c shown. The FEs remain at almost 100% from initial 25 C to final 300 C. In addition, FEs at 10 mA cm−2, 40 mA cm−2 and even 100 mA cm−2 are all above 95% (Fig. S15a-c). In order to preclude the influence of the unstable current in the initial time during electrolysis, the electrolysis is prolonged to least 2 h. The FE is calculated according to the changes of charges. As shown in Fig. S15d, the FEs under different current densities remain at about 100%, indicating that formate is the only anodic product. In fact, no CO2 is detected by gas chromatography (GC) during electrolysis. As for the cathodic HER, only H2 is detected. The FE of produced H2 is calculated over 92% at current density of 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6d). The FEs of H2 also remain above 94% at current densities of 10, 50, 200 and even 300 mA cm−2 (Fig. S16). Furthermore, the morphologies of the Ni(OH)2/NF nanosheet arrays at both cathode and anode remain intact after 24 h electrolysis (Fig. S17), which suggests its good structural stability. A very low voltage electrolysis is applied for the two-electrode system using Ni(OH)2/NF as anode and cathode. In particular, only valuable liquid formate and gaseous H2 are generated in the electrolysis, which lowers the difficulty of products separating."
12,Mechanism of selective oxidation of MeOH,"3.5 Mechanism of selective oxidation of MeOH To investigate the mechanism of MeOH-to-formate on Ni(OH)2/NF, the catalytic behavior is also explored in KOH with the addition of formate. As shown in Fig. S18, the polarization potential is greatly reduced when 500 mM MeOH is added. Nonetheless, as the concentration of formate increasing even to 500 mM, no obvious change for the polarization potential is detected, indicating that the Ni(OH)2/NF has no further catalytic effect on formate. Based on the above results, the mechanism of selective oxidation of MeOH on Ni(OH)2/NF is proposed. During electrolysis process, Ni(OH)2 is oxidized to nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) and then NiOOH oxidizes MeOH to formate [21,22,58]. As the NiOOH is difficult to further oxidize formate to CO2, only valuable formate is generated over the Ni(OH)2/NF electrocatalysts. The reactions that might occur at the anode over the Ni(OH)2/NF are shown below [59,60]: (3) Anodic reaction: Ni(OH)2 + OH− → NiOOH + H2O + e− (4) 4NiOOH + CH3OH + OH− → 4Ni(OH)2 + HCOO− (5) Anodic overall reaction: CH3OH + 5OH− → HCOO− + 4e− + 4H2O DFT calculations are also further performed to better understand the origins of the high selectivity of MeOH conversion to value-added formate instead of CO2 on the as-prepared Ni(OH)2/NF catalysts. The DFT optimized structures of the most favorable adsorbed intermediates for the oxidation of MeOH to CO2 are listed in Fig. 7 a. The Gibbs free energy diagrams (ΔG) for the MeOH conversion process on the Ni(OH)2 (001) surface with NiOOH active site is shown in Fig. 7b. The details of the calculations are in the Supporting Information. As shown in the circled part, M/HCOOH has the lowest adsorption Gibbs free energy among the series of reaction intermediates, indicating HCOOH is the thermodynamically favorable product on the exposed (001) facets of Ni(OH)2. For the formation path of M/HCOOH, an uphill energy barrier of 0.65 eV is needed to overcome for the conversion of M/OCH2 to M/OCH. However, when M/HCOOH loses proton and gets further oxidized to M/COOH, the intermediate to produce CO2, a higher energy barrier (0.88 eV) needs to overcome, preventing it from further oxidizing to CO2. Moreover, HCOOH easily reacts with OH− to form formate in the alkaline electrolyte to protect its further oxidation, resulting in the high selectivity of MeOH conversion to formate."
13,Conclusions,"Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays are in situ formed on nickel foam by a very straightforward and economical method, which are applied as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for simultaneous HER and selective oxidation of MeOH. High current density can be generated in MeOH-water electrolyte by co-electrolysis with low voltage input. It requires only 1.52 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which increases the energy conversion efficiency. The FE of H2 at the cathode is more than 92% even without a membrane. More importantly, valuable formate is the only anodic product instead of useless CO2. Cathodic HER integrated with anodic MOR over the Ni(OH)2/NF leads to accomplish H2 production with energy saving and value-added formate co-generation."
