0,Introduction,"Environment pollution and energy shortage are current and near-future problems for humanity [1]. In this context, the production of renewable energy and biofuels from waste biomass has increased, e.g., biogas, a popular biofuel, is produced in the anaerobic digestion of organic matter by complex microbial consortia in a total absence of an external electron acceptor (oxygen). Anaerobic digestion can be conceptualized as a cascade of reactions and syntrophic interactions classified in four stages: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis [2]. Microbial groups involved in this metabolic network are identified as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria, syntrophic acetogens, homoacetogens, hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenic archaea [3] (see e-Supplementary material for a graphical schematization). Even though a seventh order of methanogens was lastly discovered, the methylotrophic methanogens that consume methylated compounds such as methanol or methylamines are usually not considered in the main degradative pathways due to their minor role in anaerobic digestion of cow manure [4,5]. When sulfate is present in strictly anaerobic digestion substrates, such as cow manure (containing sulfates from the cattle diet), some microbial subgroups, especially the methanogens, could be able to couple the oxidation of organic matter and hydrogen with sulfate reduction [6]. The primary production (and consumption) of hydrogen sulfide ( H 2 S ) takes place by syntrophy of Sulfide Oxidizing Bacteria and Archea (SOB) and Sulfate Reducing Bacteria and Archea (SRB) with microbial groups 4 and 5 (this bio-cycle, established within the biodigester, is graphically depicted in e-supplementary material). Madden et al. [7] suggested that sulfate reduction activity is a spatial function differentiation in clumps formed by microbial attachment inside biodigesters. They demonstrated that even methanogenic biofilm groups contain sulfidogenic genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), qPCR, and microsensor analysis. Thus, SRB can completely or incompletely degrade Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA), alcohols, and other compounds [6]. Other works centered in co-digestion processes have addressed that the formation of H 2 S is mainly attributed to the degradation of proteinic residues [8]. In this context, cow manure is not precisely considered a protein-rich substrate, but the degradation routes described by Kovács et al. [9] should still be considered due to the presence of sulfur amino acids [10]. These sulfidogenesis pathways have been well-described, in such molecular detail that it has motivated some enzyme evolution theories, e.g., Olson et al. [11] have proposed that ubiquitous enzyme superoxide dismutase evolved to detoxify primitive cells from H 2 S . Even, it has been reported that endogenous H 2 S is a regulator of mitochondrial energy production under stress conditions in mammals [12]. However, H 2 S syntrophic production remains studied only for a few number of microorganisms. Jameson et al. [13] studied facultatively anaerobic bacteria and enriched cultures containing acidophilic SRB. They found that hydrogen sulfide was produced in strictly anaerobic cultures by sulfur respiration, using hydrogen as an electron donor and oxygen or sulfate, depending on the conditions, as final acceptors. Abundant reports in the scientific literature are devoted to eliminate, reduce, or avoid the production of H 2 S [15], above all, because high concentrations of this compound corrode concrete and steel from biogas management equipment besides of the bad odor emissions during biogas combustion [16]. Moreover, in the liquid phase, H 2 S inhibits methanogens and a part of the anaerobic process [17]. Control strategies of H 2 S comprise physicochemical processes, which can remove high concentrations of this species but require energetically and economically demanding conditions using additional chemical species [18,19]. Alternatively, biological strategies present lower operational costs and lower additional substances usage [15]. One of the most recently evaluated biological treatments for H 2 S is microaeration, which consists of supplying small amounts of pure oxygen or air within the biodigester. At adequate low doses, oxygen can avoid sulfate usage as a final electron acceptor without considerably impairing methanogenesis [20]. However, if the oxygen amount infused in the bioreactor is barely superior to the optimum, the entire syntrophic metabolism could be deviated to aerobic digestion, obtaining solely the complete degradation product, carbon dioxide (CO2), instead of the desired biofuel, methane (CH4), as demonstrated in sludge treatment systems [21–23]. Numerous sets of mathematical models for anaerobic digestion processes are available in the literature; a useful review and classification can be found in the work of Batstone et al. [24]. In the context of sulfide species syntrophy in biodigestion processes, Pokorna-Krayzelova et al. [20] proposed a sulfate-oxygen (S/O) extension for the classical Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1), initially published by the International Water Association (IWA) [25]. The authors of the called ADM1-S/O optimize the oxygen intake and the microaeration initiation to reduce the H 2 S production in wastewater treatment. They present a robust analysis and experimental validation of their results, but they did not mention their mathematical optimization strategy or experimental design. In this context, by considering the mathematical nature of AMD1 like models, a rigorous and robust numerical optimization method is needed. Furthermore, the preferred approach for microaeration in the scientific literature on cattle or other animal manure has been mainly experimental [26–28], which is contrasting with the abundant metagenomic data reports [14]. Thus, because few reports in the area focus on rigorous mathematical optimization techniques, this work aims to apply the swarm Luus-Jaakola optimization method to the mathematical model ADM1-S/O proposed by Pokorna-Krayzelova et al. [20] to optimize the oxygen concentration in the bulk reactor medium and microaeration initiation time ( t a i r ) for a bench-scale batch biodigester treating cow manure. Additionally, in order to exploit the widely validated complex relations in the system of differential equations of the cited model, microbial populations are numerically studied to propose a deeper explanation to the little addressed quantitative relations among the microbial dynamics and H 2 S decrease in microaerated biodigesters treating VFA-rich substrates. Experimental validations were statistically proven."
1,Materials and methods,"This work is structured to research the optimal t a i r and S O 2 through in silico exploration of ADM1-S/O by the Luus-Jaakola method (Luus-Jaakola-ADM1-S/O), which ultimately becomes an experimental design based on a complex mechanistic mathematical model rather than a statistical black box one. Thus, the next sections present the work’s details in this logical order; first, in section 2.1, ADM1-S/O from Pokorna-Krayzelova et al. [20] is described. In section 2.2, Luus-Jaakola method is explained. In section 2.3 some comments and data about the validation of computer codes are presented. In section 2.4, the statistical methods to validate the experimental and modeling data fitting are described. Finally, in section 2.5, the experimental set-up, reagents preparation and the sulfur determination technique are stated."
2,ADM1-S/O model,"2.1 ADM1-S/O model The ADM1-S/O model as proposed by Pokorna-Krayzelova et al. [20] was employed. Initially, the ADM1 model predicts the dynamics of 26 species (state variables), 19 for initial and intermediate metabolites, and 7 microbial populations performing the anaerobic digestion (complete model and nomenclature sections can be consulted in e-supplementary section) through 19 biochemical conversion processes [25]. The S/O extension for ADM1 [20] added six state variables S O 4 , H S - , H 2 S , O 2 , S , H C O 3 - and five microbial populations (sulfide oxidizers and sulfate-reducing consumers of butyrate, propionate, acetate, and hydrogen). Assumptions of the extended model are consistent with SRB experimental observations, inhibited by oxygen presence and competing with other anaerobic populations [20]. In order to construct the general dynamical mass balance for every species (biochemical and biological), Eqs. (1) and (2) are used for the batch case by setting the inlet ( q i n ) and outlet ( q o u t ) flows at zero. Eq. (1) shows a general expression for every chemical species concentration in the biodigester. (1) d S l i q , i d t = q i n S i n , i V l i q - q o u t S l i q , i V l i q + ∑ j = 1 19 ρ j v i , j Assuming a perfect mixing, S l i q , i represents the concentration of the i-th species in the liquid phase, q i n is the inlet flow, q o u t is the outlet flow, ρ j is the volumetric rate of production or consumption, as appropriate, for the j-th process, and v i , j is the corresponding Petersen matrix element (see e-supplementary section for more details of the used values). The product ρ j v i , j is a volumetric rate of production, consumption, or interphase transport, as corresponds. Eq. 2 shows a general expression for every biological species (7) concentration and particulate fraction (5) in the biodigester. (2) d X l i q , i d t = q i n X i n , i V l i q - q o u t X l i q , i V l i q + ∑ j = 1 12 ρ j v i , j Where X l i q , i represents the biomass density of the i-th species in the liquid phase, q i n is the inlet flow, q o u t is the outlet flow, ρ j is the volumetric growth rate or decay, as appropriate, for the j-th process, and v i , j is the corresponding Petersen matrix element (see e-supplementary section for more details of the used values)."
3,Optimization algorithms,"2.2 Optimization algorithms The ordinary differential equations system of ADM1-S/O model was solved by discretizing the temporal derivative by finite forward difference to overcome the system stiffness [29]. Optimal searching is performed by a classical Luus-Jaakola algorithm, which is depicted in the flow-chart diagram of Fig. 1 . For a deeper description and revision of the Luus-Jaakola algorithm, please refer to Liao and Luus [29] and Fernándes et al. [31] The optimization method (Fig. 1) is first supplied with all initial conditions for the 26 species; physicochemical parameters (liquid-gas exchange); biochemical and biological kinetics (maximum growth rates, saturation, and inhibition constants and biomass/substrate yields); the initial guess for the objective parameters, t a i r and oxygen concentration in microaeration in the biodigester ( S O 2 ); and the lower ( t a i r l o w = 0 d a y s , S O 2 l o w = 0 p p m ) and upper ( t a i r u p = 100 d a y s , S O 2 u p = 10 p p m ) limits for the optimization parameters for the optimum search, which were taken from typical values employed in the microaeration literature [13,17,20,32,33]. Then, a forward finite difference subroutine solves the ADM1-S/O model. For every Luus-Jaakola iteration, results of the mathematical model are employed to compute the total produced H 2 S ( ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ) by simply trapezoidal integration method. For the second and further executions, this quantity is compared with the corresponding previous minimum for total H 2 S ( ∫ 0 t f q o u t a n t S H 2 S a n t d t ). After these comparisons have made “Itermax” times (1000 in this case), per searching range adjustment, the computer program reports the parameter combination ( p → ) that produces the minimum total amount of H 2 S (current ∫ 0 t f q o u t a n t S H 2 S a n t d t ). The reduction of the searching range ( R j ) in every iteration is computed with Eq. 3. In the end, 10,000 searching range adjustments (searches) were performed, which implies 10,000,000 combinations of the adjusting parameters. (3) R j + 1 = γ R j Where R j + 1 = t a i r u p - t a i r l o w , ( S O 2 u p - S O 2 l o w ) t is a vector with the searching range, for the two parameters, in the present random generation; R j is the searching range (vector) at the previous random generation, and γ is a contraction factor set at 0.95 [30]. Note that no kinetic, biological, or physicochemical parameter is included in the optimization objective function. There are only two optimization variables ( t a i r and S O 2 ), while two experimental variables are measured ( C H 4 and H 2 S ), thus, from zero degrees of freedom, no convergence problems or multiplicity of solutions are expected in the bounded searching domain. Random(seed) function from Fortran 77/90 compiler is supplied with system clock time (seed) to intend the most random possible seed. Computations were performed on a Personal Computer Hp Pavilion 15cw-0xxx with AMD Ryzen 3 2300 U processor, Windows 10 Home OS, and Intel FORTRAN Composer 2012 T M compiler."
4,Validation of computer codes,"2.3 Validation of computer codes The benchmark validation of differential equation systems solver (applied on ADM1-S/O from this study) was first contrasted with the ADM1 report [34], which was reproduced. Compared with the author’s report, the average error for the 46 values (at 20 days of simulations) was less than 0.65 %. Even the higher percentage errors, e.g., for q g a s (5.19 %), p g a s , c o 2 (2.09 %), S g a s , c o 2 (2.09), S c o 2 (2.09), S H + (2.27), X a c (1.86), and S I (1.73), did not exceed 2.5 % of error. Differences can be attributed to the precision for parameters and initial values employed (complete comparative table can be seen in e-supplementary material)."
5,Statistic validation,"2.4 Statistic validation The statistical validation of curve fitting for methane and hydrogen sulfide, for the two numerically optimized parameters, as described below, was developed by computing the expectation matrix as a measure of statistical significance of the optimal parameters for curve fitting [35]; and by the Coefficient of Variance of Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE) as a measure of mean differences between the model (ADM1-S/O) and experimental data [36]. 2.4.1 Expectation matrix computations Eq. 4 shows a vector equation to investigate the confidence intervals ((1 − α)×100 %) for the two optimized parameters. With non-linear solving of these equations, the expectation matrix ( Θ ), containing the confidence intervals, is computed [35]. (4) Θ - θ t D t D Θ - θ ≤ k σ 2 F 1 - α k , 2 N - k Where θ = t a i r , S O 2 t , and D and σ are differently expressed for the two optimization parameters. For total produced methane: D = ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ] 1 ∂ t a i r ¯ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ] 1 ∂ S O 2 ¯ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ] 2 ∂ t a i r ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ] 2 ¯ ∂ S O 2 ⋮ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ] N ∂ t a i r ⋮ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ] N ¯ ∂ S O 2 σ 2 = ∑ i = 1 N ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ¯ ] i e x p - ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t ¯ ] i m o d e l 2 N - k And for total produced hydrogen sulfide: D = ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ] 1 ∂ t a i r ¯ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ] 1 ∂ S O 2 ¯ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ] 2 ∂ t a i r ¯ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ] 2 ¯ ∂ S O 2 ⋮ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ] N ∂ t a i r ¯ ⋮ ∂ [ ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ] N ¯ ∂ S O 2 σ 2 = ∑ i = 1 N ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ¯ ] i e x p - ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t ¯ ] i m o d e l 2 N - k N is the total experimental observations contrasted with the model prediction, k is the number of estimated parameters (two in this case), and superscript exp denotes experimental measures, while the model denotes de predicted values (ADM1−S/O). 2.4.2 Coefficient of variance of root square mean error (CV-RMSE) Eq. 5 is used for CV-RMSE computation [36]. (5) C V - R M S E = ∑ i = 1 N y i e x p - y i m o d 2 N - 1 y ¯ e x p ∙ 100 Where y i e x p and y i m o d are the i-th value of variable y , for experimental and modeling data, respectively. Variable y is substituted by S H 2 S and q o u t S C H 4 as corresponds."
6,Experimental set-up,"2.5 Experimental set-up Bench-scale biodigesters were constructed from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers (20 l ) and hoses (3 mm diameter). In this system, the perfect mixing assumption suggested by ADM1 like models is difficult to accomplish; however, the entire experimental system holds similitude with the variable size stagnant zones of full-scale continuous biodigesters [37]. According to some recent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) works, in 7 m 3 (or bigger) biodigesters, the volume of its several stagnant zones are up to 20 % of its total volume [38]. For practical full-scale applications, relatively isolated portions of at least 20 l are expected. Thence, the batch situation was intentionally selected to investigate the fitting between ADM1-S/O predictions and approach more realistic experimental observations. Besides, due to the nature of the selected experimental procedures (i.e., iodometric titration of hydrogen sulfide), five bench-scale bioreactors were simultaneously set up to achieve detectably H 2 S concentrations. Hot melt ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was used to seal all the junctions. House recreative air pump (maximum capacity of 10 l / m i n ) with PET valves (pressure regulators) and airflow meter (Tube No. 032-41-N, glass float, 0-1 m l / h , Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Il, USA) were used to ensure the optimal oxygen concentration found in silico according to ADM1-S/O computations (1.936 × 10−4 p p m ). Fig. 2 shows the described system. Biogas from each biodigester is bubbled through a brine system composed by two consecutive PET containers (1 l ) filled with distilled water and sodium carbonate ( N a 2 C O 3 ) at 1 % (w/v) to retain 95 % of the generated C O 2 and H 2 S . Under these conditions, H 2 S is highly soluble and reacts with H2O to form sodium hydrosulfide ( N a H S ), and N a H C O 3 [39]. Thus, the output air (after the two-purification bubbling) contains only 0.25 % of the original C O 2 . The stoichiometry of these reactions is shown in Eqs. (6) and (7). (6) C O 2 + N a 2 C O 3 + H 2 O → 2 N a H C O 3 (7) H 2 S + N a 2 C O 3 → N a H S + N a H C O 3 After the brine system, purified biogas (henceforth assumed to be biomethane) is bubbled through the end of the PET hose, fixed at the bottom of an inverted graduated cylinder (5 l ) filled with distilled water by vacuum. Biomethane is measured by the displaced water volume in this container. Readings of biomethane were taken three times per day, and then the water content of the graduated cylinder was reset. Cow manure used as substrate was collected from feedlot piles (<6 months old) from a local dairy farm of La Laguna, located in northern México (25°33′00′′ N, 103°26′ ′00″ W). Total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) were performed as follows. First, 100 g of fresh manure at 105 °C until its water content is zero; the result is divided by the FW (100 g ), resulting in 32 ± 2 g of TS/100 g of FW. The already dried substrate is burned in a muffle furnace at 600 °C. The residue after incineration is the inorganic fraction or ashes content. The dried substrate weight minus the inorganic fraction weight is then divided by the dried substrate weight to get the VS concentration, obtaining 15 ± 1.2 g of VS/100 g of FW. These measures are consistent with the average TS, which are usually around 30 g /100 g of FW and VS around 16 g of VS/100 g of FW [40–42]. The rest of physicochemical characteristics (used for ADM1-S/O performance); sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and other chemical species have been extensively reported as mostly invariant among different cow races, as long as the fed, climate, and feedlot surface is the same [43–45]. For the biodigester set-up, 1 part of fresh manure was diluted with 1.5 parts of distilled water to provide 12.8 % TS [46]. Biodigesters were filled with this mixture at 60 % of its capacity; thus, the working volume was 12 l and headspace was 8 l . The organic loading in every digester is 720 g VS, equivalent to 60 g VS/ l of reactor. All the experiments were performed by three replicates at a non-controlled average room temperature of 30 ± 2 ° C . Samples of 15 m l were withdrawn from the first bottle of the brine trap system on days 2, 6, 12, 15, 19, 29, 36, and 40. After each sampling, the N a 2 C O 3 solution was replaced anew. 2.5.1 Reagents Iodine ( I 2 ) and sulfuric acid ( H 2 S O 4 ) were provided by JTBaker (Catalog number BAKR1118.1000 and BAKR0331-18, respectively). Sodium sulfite ( N a 2 S O 3 ) and sodium thiosulfate ( N a 2 S 2 O 3 ) were provided by ANALYTYKA de México S.A. de C.V. (product code S0295). Sodium carbonate ( N a 2 C O 3 ) and distilled water were provided by Sigma-Aldrich (Catalog number S2127 and 38796, respectively). Soluble starch was provided by Sigma-Aldrich (Catalog number 9005-84-9). The following solutions were prepared: iodine solution 0.0025 M was prepared by dissolving 0.158 g of iodine in some distilled water and gauging to 250 m l . Sulfuric acid 5 M was prepared by mixing 67 m l of concentrated sulfuric acid in distilled water, gauging to 250 m l . Thiosulfate 0.01 M was prepared by dissolving 0.395 g of reactant in distilled water gauging to 250 m l . Starch solution 4% (w/v) was prepared by dissolving 10 g of reactant in distilled water gauging to 250 m l . 2.5.2 Hydrogen sulfide determinations Iodometric titration is employed to quantify all the present sulfur compounds. The iodometric technique presents a ± 3 % error for concentrations equally or upper to 10 μ M of H 2 S [47]. According to literature reports, H 2 S concentration in biogas produced by cow manure strictly-anaerobic biodigestion oscillates between 0.029 and 0.29 M [48]. As described by Giggenbach [49] and Pawlak and Pawlak [50], iodine titration of hydrogen sulfide is performed in a flask by adding an aliquot of 5 mL of 0.0025 M iodine solution ( I 2 ), 5 m l from 5 M H 2 S O 4 aqueous solution, 5 mL of sample (water from the solution traps of biodigester system), and gently mixing. The addition of strong acid assures iodine reduction (and sulfur oxidation) according to Eq. 8. (8) H 2 S O 4 + 2 N a H S + 2 I 2 → 4 H I + 2 S 0 + N a 2 S O 4 The resulting mixture contains residual unreacted iodine, which is then titrated with the standardized 0.01 M N a 2 S 2 O 3 solution until a pale-yellow color is achieved. It is assumed that de iodine excess reacts with sodium thiosulfate according to Eq. 9. (9) I 2 + 2 N a 2 S 2 O 3 → N a 2 S 4 O 6 + 2 N a I Thence, 5 drops of 4% starch aqueous solution are added to produce a blue-colored solution. Titration with the standardized solution is then continued until the blue color has completely vanished. Besides the three repetitions for every sample, a blank without sulfide compounds must be titrated. H 2 S concentration ( C H 2 S ) is calculated through Eq. 10. (10) C H 2 S m g m L = 17040.44 * C n v V b - V V m Where C n v is the concentration of the standard solution N a 2 S 2 O 3 . V b is the volume ( m l ) of the standardized N a 2 S 2 O 3 solution, added to titrate the blank. V is the volume ( m l ) of the standardized N a 2 S 2 O 3 solution, added to titrate the sample. V m is the volume of the sample ( m l )."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Parameters optimization,"3.1 Parameters optimization ADM1-S/O model and Luus-Jaakola method vary the optimization parameters and simulate the system behavior. Then, the best combination of parameters is found by comparing the total generated hydrogen sulfide ( ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t m l ) at every parameter pair test with the others. Fig. 3 a shows 3-D a graphic of this numerical response variable as a function of the optimized parameters; t a i r and S O 2 . As expected, the more significant effect can be attributed to the oxygen concentration. However, it slightly falls if the microaeration process initiates as soon as possible. Besides, soft contour lines are present on both surfaces, suggesting local minima and convexity problems for multi-objective minimization algorithms. In this context, the Luus-Jaakola method is widely justified because swarm algorithms have gained popularity to selectively explore local minima (within parameter-bounded domains) [31]. From the syntrophic metabolic understanding, the oxygen concentration’s contrary effect is expected for the total methane production. Thence, an important research question emerges from analyzing Fig. 3a: Is there a single or combined effect for optimized parameters for the case of methane? Fig. 3b depicts the total generated methane ( ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t l ) as a function of the optimized parameters: t a i r and S O 2 . Two dramatic effects of S O 2 are reflected in the total methane production, whereas no slopes were evident along the surface for t a i r . These results were constructed exclusively with in silico simulations to illustrate the robustness of the approach, even if optimization convergence problems are present. For these simulations, methane yield, considering the total VS from the five digesters (10.2 k g ), and Normal Conditions of Pressure and Temperature (NCTP), was approximate 0.47−0.48 g / l of VS, which is consistent with reports for digestion of similar substrates [51,52]. This result, based on the digestion of a VFA-rich substrate, represents a competitive yield considering the anaerobic digestion of protein-rich systems [9]. For the first case, reported Carbon/Nitrogen ratios are frequently around 8:1 [53]. This relation certainly seems to be suboptimal compared with wastewater treatment and protein-rich substrates whose known value is 100:3 [8,54]. However, C/N ratio was not modified in this work, on the one hand, because for cattle farming digesters, at least in Latin American countries, a carbon source to perform a co-digestion is rarely available [51]. On the other hand, the high VFA content in cow manure ensures a good methane yield via acetate and syntrophic acetate consumers [51,55,56], instead of protein pathways observed in other anaerobic systems [9]."
9,Effect of oxygen concentration,"3.2 Effect of oxygen concentration Fig. 4 shows the effect (predicted by ADM1-S/O) of oxygen concentration O 2 in the inlet microaeration stream over the hydrogen sulfide concentration H 2 S and methane concentration C H 4 . The same trend of 3D (deterministic) surface response is appreciated in Fig. 3a, while staggered effects are observed on methane (Fig. 3b). It is necessary to point out that the oxygen concentration in the inlet stream is different from the oxygen concentration in the biodigester ( S O 2 ). However, both are related to the non-linear dynamics of this species described by ADM1-S/O. After 10,000,000 iteration cycles (the product of Itermax and the number of searching range reductions) in the Luus-Jaakola optimizer, reactor oxygen concentration S O 2 = 0.0002819 m g / l p p m and microaeration initiation time at t a i r = 11 d a y s were computed. Total oxygen supply, considering the airflow necessary to maintain the optimum concentration (0.78 μ l / h ), and the average oxygen concentration in the room air used (at 1120- m altitude ∼ 20 % ), results in 1.214 m o l (for 40 d a y s of effective operation). This result is consistent with the report of Pokorna-Krayzelova et al. [20] (molar ratio of O 2 : S O 4 of 0.5), since the total sulfate contained in the 14 l of substrate (5.96 k g of manure) is about 0.62 m o l [10]. Other microaeration studies used approximately similar oxygen amounts. E.g. Giordano et al. [57] proposed an oxygen supply of around 0.88 g of O 2 / k g of VS for co-digesting of high-solid sewage sludge. In these terms, the airflow for 40 days employed in this work at NCTP is equivalent to a total supply of 1.07 g of O 2 for every digester (2.04 kg of VS), resulting in 0.52 g of O 2 / k g of VS. Other reports of oxygen requirements for digesters treating cow manure as a single substrate are focused on economic comparisons of this technology against other technologies instead of optimizing process parameters. In the case of the optimization parameter t a i r , Luus-Jaakola-ADM1-S/O computes an initiation time 63 days sooner than that reported by Pokorna-Krayzelova et al. [20], who initiated the microaeration at 74th day after anaerobic digestion set-up. According to the present numerical results, an earlier microaeration time had no significant effect on total produced methane, albeit it decreased hydrogen sulfide total production. The used substrate’s nature explains this last difference between this work and the previous report for both cases. While Pokorna-Krayzelova et al. (2017) experiments are devoted to wastewater treatment, Luus-Jaakola-ADM1-S/O was applied to a manure-water mixture with different rheological and physicochemical properties. In this context, a direct relation between biomass clumps formation, shear stress, and nutrient spatial distribution have been well-established for biofilm systems within Newtonian fluids, such as mixed wastewater reactors [58] or even air biofiltration systems [59]. For dense anaerobic systems, nutrient gradients and negligible detachment drive to spatially specialized metabolic functions within these formed clumps [60], which explains the superior resistance to oxygen at earlier operation times in cow manure aqueous systems. The existence of clumps and spatially distributed syntrophic functions imply an adequate microbial population balance, and as a consequence good biomethane yields [61–65]. Luus-Jaakola-ADM1-S/O predictions of this work suggest that for non-perfectly mixed batch biodigesters fed with fresh cow manure, 11 d a y s are sufficient to establish anaerobic dominant proportion in syntrophic microbial community, and if the oxygen concentration is maintained under 1.936 × 10−4 p p m ( m g / l ), no dramatic changes in syntrophic metabolic pathways are observed. In other more realistic systems (like the full-scale biodigesters), a zero-day is challenging to establish. For batch operation, with the appropriate combination of Luus-Jaakola-ADM1-S/O, CFD equations, and some spatially simulating bio-clumps methodology like cellular automata models [59], adequate initiation time can be reasonably established and related with physicochemical measures. The metabolic segregation from ADM1-S/O model allows to analize the augmentation of microbial groups for microaerated conditions (Fig. 5 a) and the microbial biomass decrease for the strictly anaerobic case (Fig. 5b). Regarding the latter phenomenon, Nguyen et al. [66] noted that microbial communities in a well-established anaerobic environment have antioxidative intracellular and syntrophic mechanisms to resist the low concentrations of oxygen presence. Thus, dramatic changes in their proportions are avoided. Furthermore, according to St-Pierre and Wright [67], when syntrophic population balance is unaltered, no alterations in total methane production are expected. This explains why microaeration did not considerably affect the methane production in the experimental and in silico results. Another observation was that the oxygen supply increases the total biomass ( k g C O D / m 3 ) and promotes more diverse and complex consortia, even if the carbon source is exhausted compared to strict anaerobiosis (see Fig. 5, and for more details the e-supplementary material). Microbial adaptation to micro-dosed oxygen, such as other toxic species and unfavorable physicochemical conditions, has been described as functional resilience by Bonk et al. [68] in their metagenomic studies of thermophilic methanogens diversity of full-scale biodigesters. In this context, other works also metagenomically study and highlight the microbial diversity importance, e.g., Nassir et al. [69] verified the coexistence and syntrophy among a wide variety of acidogenic bacteria and archaea in anaerobic digestion of organic matter as pH adaptation mechanism. Pampillón-González et al. [70] observed several methanogens and hydrogenotrophs in pig farms feedlot piles treated in optimal batch conditions. Such metagenomic works improve the researchers understanding of microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion; however, they commonly focus on single functional genes ignoring their quantitative relation with physicochemically measurable state variables (like pH, or metabolite concentrations). Thus, as Rico et al. [14] stated, critical and mathematical ecological indices must be constructed to “meta-analyze these meta-analyses” presenting a research niche for the possible application of Luus-Jaakola-ADM1 and its extensions. It is noteworthy that the numerical results for simulations of microbial communities, computed by Luus-Jaakola-ADM1-S/O, were useful to explain the microbial diversity and functional resilience to oxygen in this work, while measurable physicochemical variables were experimentally observed ( H 2 S and C H 4 ). The increasing abundance of hydrolytic microorganisms in the strictly anaerobic system evolution (as can be seen in Fig. 5b) is consistent with the observations of Campanaro et al. [71]. They functionally classify more than 1600 microbial species from multiple biodigesters, concluding that the associated genes of macromolecule consumers are overexpressed on later stages of biodigesters."
10,Experimental validation,"3.3 Experimental validation The ADM1-S/O was solved by implicit finite differences, and the values of physicochemical and biological parameters were reasonably numerical precise for the selected combinations of oxygen concentration and microaeration initiation time. In Fig. 6 it is observed the hydrogen sulfide (6a) and methane (6b) experimental concentrations (with their respective error bars) fitting to the ADM1-S/O predicted curve for 40 days of operation. Since none of the microaeration parameters had a significant effect on the methane production, as demonstrated by in silico explorations (Fig. 4a), the graphical results are shown only for H 2 S . The two non-linear equations resulting from the mathematical manipulation of Eq. 4 were solved by the Newton method. In both analyzed dependent variables ∫ 0 t f q o u t S H 2 S d t and ∫ 0 t f q o u t S C H 4 d t , for 95 % confidence, Θ values and their inequations obtained were 0.051 , 0.0063 t ≤ 0.0822 , 0.252,0.402 t ≤ 0.4112 , which confirms a model adjustment (ADM1-S/O) statistically significant for the optimal parameters. CV-RMSE computed for hydrogen sulfide was 4.23 % for microaerated case and 8.52 % for the control case. For methane, CV-RMSE, from Eq. 5, was 12.56 %. These error coefficients are within reasonable range values, particularly considering the uncontrolled (temperature, mixing, and pH) and biological nature of operational parameters; these realistic conditions support even the validity of the results. The summation of all the measures from the graduated cylinder besides the theoretical adjustment for remnant C O 2 (0.25 % v/v) corresponds to of 4605.82 ± 25.6 l of C H 4 confirming a yield of 0.45 ± 0.02 l of C H 4 / g of VS similar to the obtained by the in silico explorations and addressed in abundant literature reports [51,72–74]. Note that the scales of C H 4 concentrations in Fig. 6 were modified to appreciate the two graphics for both the triplicate microaerated assay and the non-microaerated (control) assay, which differences are not statically significant."
11,Scope and limitations of microaeration (Biogas quality for different flow rates),"3.4 Scope and limitations of microaeration (Biogas quality for different flow rates) Microaeration reports have been consistently addressed as cost-effective strategies to mitigate hydrogen sulfide generation on a laboratory and pilot scale. However, as Leng et al. [75] discussed, perfect mixing supposition cannot be guaranteed in full and pilot scale biodigesters, where in contrast, the presence of several stagnant zones drives to clusters formation with specialized spatial syntrophic functions during the digestion process. Thence, the results presented here are only for biodigesters whose mixing system ensures stagnant zones no longer than 12 l . The present study was performed assuming that the reactors work adequately since its start-up, a condition that was verified by total gas production and not showing dramatic pH changes. In Fig. 6, the first experimental average methane concentration is even higher than the model predictions, which is a good physicochemical witness of this ideal behavior [76], if the biodigestion system has a more extended start-up period, microaeration could inhibit the establishment of a well-balanced microbial population. Thus, some mathematical control strategies with expected perturbations (and their corresponding experimental validation) need to be coupled with the present computational code as future work. Also, an up-scaling mass transport study is needed to determine critical ranges for geometrical and operation variables, outside which, perfect mixing assumption is not sufficiently precise. Also, it was identified the opportunity area to extend and validate mechanistic syntrophic relations of ADM1 and its extensions; a critical meta-review based on a mathematical work not much different from the swarm optimizations performed in this work but applied over kinetic parameters of new proposed microbial groups (from metagenomic studies). Regarding the autothermal performance of the experimental set-up, it is necessary to state that full-scale biodigesters are operated either at ambient (15−28 °C), mesophilic (30−35 °C), and thermophilic (50-55 ° C ) conditions [73,77–80], which is not an impediment to ADM1-S/O modeling since Arrhenius dependency of kinetics constants could be included as addressed by Donoso-Bravo et al. [81] to simulate different temperature conditions."
12,Conclusions,"In this work, the Luus-Jaakola method was applied on a validated solver for ADM1-S/O model. Critical oxygen microaeration concentration was found at 1.936 × 10−4 p p m (which means the molar ratio of O 2 : S of 0.5 or 0.52 g of O 2 / k g of VS). Any oxygen (or air) intake that raises the S O 2 within the biodigester above this limit decreases the hydrogen sulfide until practically zero but also decreases methane yields. Methane yield numerical results suggest that a different microbial community formation with diminished methane producers is achieved because of the critical oxygen concentration. The day of microaeration initiation was statistically significant, identifying the 11th day as the more appropriate to start the air infusion. However, its effect on total methane production is negligible compared to that of oxygen concentration. The optimized microaeration conditions allowed a competitive methane yield (0.45 ± 0.02 l of CH4/100 g VS). As an advantage in upscaling terms, the present study employs a batch configuration with a non-perfectly mixed system, bigger than traditionally laboratory-scale biodigesters. The employed volume biodigesters (20 l ) can be easily scaled to be compared with stagnant zones of full-scale biodigesters, which suggest the applicability of the present approach for combined CFD-Luus-Jaakola-ADM1-S/O modeling to study microbial populations development and chemical species dynamics in these practical interest systems."
