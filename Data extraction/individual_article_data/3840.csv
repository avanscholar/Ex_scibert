0,Introduction,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are ecologically friendly devices that can produce electricity by direct conversion of the energy produced in a chemical reaction [1,2]. To date, the issues of major concern are related to the direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuel, i.e., natural gas. A conventional SOFC consists of an ion-conducting solid electrolyte and two electrodes – a cathode and an anode. For anode production, Ni–ceramic composites are commonly used [3,4], which exhibit high electrochemical activity towards the hydrogen oxidation reaction. However, Ni–ceramic anodes have disadvantages, such as their fast performance degradation in a gas mixture with high vapor content due to nickel evaporation [5,6], the blockage of anode active sites by adsorbed forms of water [7,8], and the formation of carbon on the anode surface during operation with the hydrocarbon fuel [9,10]. Therefore, alternative anode materials are of great interest. Recently, oxides with a perovskite structure based on strontium ferrite, in particular, Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ, were suggested as alternative anode materials for application in SOFCs [11,12]. These oxides were found to be stable in both oxidative and reductive gas mixtures, making recovery of the anode by carbon oxidation possible [13,14]. The electrical conductivity of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ in both atmospheres at 800 °C is typically about 10–30 S cm–1, and the electrochemical performance of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ electrodes is also quite high. In addition, the polarization resistance (Rη) of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ electrode usually does not exceed 0.5 Ω cm2 at 800°С [15,16], which may decrease significantly with electrode modification with nanoparticles of electroactive metals and/or oxides [12,17–19]. Another promising technique to increase the electrochemical activity of electrodes is in situ exsolution. In this method, metal cations are initially incorporated into the oxide structure and metallic nanoparticles release on the electrode surface during treatment in the reductive atmosphere [20]. Recently, it was shown that the introduction of Ni into the Fe-sublattice of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ and subsequent treatment under reductive conditions leads to the appearance of Ni–Fe nanoparticles on the electrode surface and a reduction in the electrode polarization resistance [21,22]. Feng et al. investigated Sr2Fe1.5–xNixMo0.5O6–δ (x = 0–0.3) and found that within the studied row the Sr2Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ oxide exhibited the best electrical and electrochemical performance in a hydrogen atmosphere [23]. Later, the effect of strontium deficiency in Sr2–yFe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ (y = 0–0.1) was studied, and it was found that the oxide Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6-δ had the best activity towards the hydrogen oxidation reaction due to the more favorable ratio of redox pairs (Fe2+/Fe3+/ Mo5+/Mo6+) [24]. However, little information is available concerning the electrode kinetics and rate-determining stages of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) for such electrodes, both in oxidative and reductive conditions. It can also be expected that the exsolved nickel particles will affect the mechanism of the electrode reaction of hydrogen oxidation, which is not indicated in the literature. In the current study, we focused on the investigation of the electrical and electrochemical performance of Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ, where both Sr deficiency and B-site doping with Ni were realized. The main purpose of the work was to study the mechanisms of electrode reactions by analyzing electrochemical impedance spectra by the distribution of relaxation times method, which made it possible to establish for the first time the effect of nickel exsolution on the electrode surface on the changes in the mechanism of hydrogen oxidation. Additionally, the results of the SOFC tests for a symmetrical cell with Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ electrodes and supporting LaGaO3-based electrolyte having a thickness of 300 μm are presented."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation Electrode powders Sr1.95Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ (SFM) and Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ (SFNM) were obtained via solid state synthesis from Sr(NO3)2, Fe2O3, Ni(NO3)2, and MoO3. Initial powders were mixed in the necessary ratio in alcohol media in a planetary ball mill (Retsch PM 100). The first step in the heat treatment was carried out at 750 °C for 2 h and the final sintering was performed at 1100 °C for 10 h in air. For electrical conductivity studies with the conventional 4-probe DC method, the SFNM samples in the form of bars, with a size of about 20 × 5 × 3 mm, were prepared using uniaxial pressing (250 MPa) with subsequent sintering at 1250 °C for 20 h in air. After sintering, four platinum wires were placed on the sample and then covered with Pt paste and sintered for 1 h at 950°С in air. For electrochemical measurements, the symmetrical cells with SFNM (SFM) electrodes and the La0.85Sr0.15Ga0.85Mg0.15O3 (LSGM) supporting electrolyte were prepared. The investigation of ORR and HOR mechanisms was performed with the electrochemical cell with the LSGM electrolyte having a thickness of 750 μm. For the SOFC tests, the supporting LSGM electrolyte with a thickness of 300 μm was used. The details of the LSGM electrolyte preparation and certification are presented in [25]. To prepare the electrode slurry, the SFNM (SFM) powder was mixed with isopropyl alcohol and polyvinyl butyral. The electrode slurry was applied to the electrolyte by painting it onto both sides, then drying it at 100°С and sintering in air at 1050°С for 2 h, with heating and cooling rates of 100° h–1. After sintering, the thickness and area of the electrodes were about 30 μm and 0.3 cm2, respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The phase composition of the as-prepared powders and the samples after treatment in different atmospheres was investigated by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) method on a Rigaku D/MAX-2200 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å) at room temperature in ambient air. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 10–80° with a step of 0.02° at an angular scanning rate of 4° min−1. To obtain microphotographs, the sample pores were filled with epoxy in a vacuum, and then the samples were polished with the Struers Labopol device. Also the SEM images were obtained on the samples broken in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the supporting electrolyte without any processing. The images and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were performed using a MIRA 3LMU electron microscope with an energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis system (EDX) (Oxford Instruments INCA Energy 350) with an X-max 80 non-gas detector and electron backscatter diffraction system (EBSD) (INCA Synergy Premium diffraction system) with a Nordlys II F+detector. The analysis of the SEM images was performed using ImageJ software."
4,Electrical and electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrical and electrochemical measurements The electrical conductivity was studied in the temperature range of 600–800 °C in air, at pO2 = 10–20 atm and in wet (3 vol.% H2O) hydrogen. Dependencies of electrical conductivity on the oxygen partial pressure (10–20 to 0.21 atm) were obtained at 600, 700, and 800°С. The conductivity measurements were performed with the 4-probe DC method using a Keithley 2700 multimeter. The polarization resistance (Rη) measurements were performed with impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz (at 30 mV with 30 ppd) in air and wet hydrogen using a PARSTAT 3000A. The sketch of the experimental setup is presented in [26]. For the investigation of the performance of the SOFC, the sample was sealed on one side of the alumina tube. Current–voltage decencies were obtained under air/wet hydrogen (CH4+H2O) conditions with an EI-1287 electrochemical interface (Solartron). For impedance data analysis, the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) method was applied. For the DRT analysis, the program code, developed by the authors of [27] based on the Tikhonov's regularization, was used. During calculation of the DRT functions, the choice of the optimal regularization parameter was performed based on the algorithm described in [28]. Experiments were carried out in 5 vol.% H2 + Ar, wet (3 vol.% H2O) hydrogen, 30 vol.% H2O + 70 vol.% CH4, air, and air with oxygen pumped out. For preparation of the gas mixture, Ar, CH4 and H2 (purity not less than 99.99 vol.%) were used. The gasses partial pressures were set by the highly accurate flow-measuring devices produced by the Bronkhorst company. For hydrogen (CH4) humidification, the gas was passed through a bubbler with distilled water at the necessary temperature. To pump oxygen from the air, electrochemical pumps based on stabilized zirconium oxide were used. The oxygen activity in the gas phase was measured with a solid oxide oxygen sensor, which was placed near the studied samples. The internal volume of the sensor was blown off with air. All measurements were carried out at atmospheric pressure."
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD powder certification,"3.1 XRD powder certification Before the electrical and electrochemical measurements, the phase stability of Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ (SFNM) in different gas media was studied. For this, three portions of the sintered in air the single phase SFNM powder (Fig. 1 ), with a mass of about one gram each, were heat treated at 800 °C (the highest temperature for electrochemical measurements) in different gas media for 10 h. After this, XRD analysis was performed. Fig. 1 shows the obtained XRD patterns. After treatment in an atmosphere with an oxygen partial pressure of 10–20 atm, no additional phases were found. After heat treatment of SFNM in an atmosphere of 5% vol. H2 + Ar, peaks corresponding to iron (#89–4186) were observed in the XRD pattern. Iron formation in the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ based oxide was observed previously [17,29]. Contrarily, Feng et al. [24] observed the formation of nickel in Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ after heat treatment for 12 h in a 5% vol. H2 + Ar atmosphere. It should be noted that the oxygen partial pressure in the 5% vol. H2 + Ar atmosphere calculated from the values of the electrochemical sensor was about 2 × 10–20 atm. However, when we obtained such a pO2 value by pumping oxygen from the air we did not observe iron formation. Most likely, it was not the low oxygen pressure but the presence of hydrogen in the gas medium that was the key factor for iron formation. After heat treatment in more reductive conditions (wet hydrogen), additional peaks corresponding to nickel (#70–1849) were observed. Since the peaks for iron and nickel are close to those for the Fe–Ni alloy (#47–1417), that is usually mentioned as the phase formed during treatment of SFNM in hydrogen [21,22]. One more additional phase was observed after treatment in wet hydrogen, which was identified as Sr3FeMoO6.5 (#52–1715) [30,31]. Taking into account that the Sr3FeMoO6.5 phase is a derivative of the Sr2FeMoO6–δ oxide, which has high electronic conductivity under reducing conditions [32,33], it can be assumed that the presence of Sr3FeMoO6.5 would not deteriorate the electrode performance of SFNM in a wet hydrogen atmosphere. Feng et al. [23] also observed the formation of Sr3FeMoO6.5 in SFNM after treatment in hydrogen at 750 °C for 24 h, but only in the oxides with a nickel content of 0.4. Xiao et al. [22] also reported the formation of a strontium-rich phase after treatment of Sr2–xFe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ in wet hydrogen at 800 °C for 10 h. Based on the XRD pattern presented in [22], this phase can be identified as Sr3FeMoO6.5."
7,Electrical conductivity,"3.2 Electrical conductivity The electrical conductivity of SFNM was investigated using one virgin sample in three different atmospheres in the temperature range of 600–800°С (Fig. 2 ). First, the temperature dependency in the air was measured, then at 800°С the oxygen was pumped out of the air to a pO2 value of 10–20 atm, and after exposure the temperature dependency was measured again. After this, the furnace with the sample was blown with air and then cooled slowly to room temperature. Then, the blowing of the furnace with wet hydrogen was initiated with subsequent heating to 800°С and exposure at this temperature for 10 h. Then, the temperature dependency was measured again. In all conditions at each temperature, the sample was held until reaching a constant resistance value. The duration of exposure was from 0.5 to 2 h, depending on the temperature and atmosphere. From the obtained results (Fig. 2), one can see that in the temperature range of 600–800 °C in air the conductivity dependency is non-linear. The electrical conductivity values decrease as the temperature increases. Such behavior for Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ based oxides is well known and is associated with oxygen release from the crystal lattice with increasing temperature [34]. The electrical conductivity values ranged from 9 to 14 S cm–1, which is in good agreement with the results obtained in [22]. In reductive conditions (pO2 = 10–20 atm and wet hydrogen), the electrical conductivity has typical semi-conducting behavior, with activation energy values of about 23 kJ mol–1. The electrical conductivity values obtained at pO2 = 10–20 atm ranged from 9 to 17 S cm–1. In wet hydrogen, the electrical conductivity was found to be significantly higher, about 75 S cm–1 at 800°С, which is higher than the values available in the literature. For example, in [24] for the similar oxide, the electrical conductivity was about 26 S cm–1 at 800°С in a 5% H2 + Ar atmosphere. In [23] for the Sr2Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ oxide, the authors reported values of about 21 S cm–1 at 800°С in wet hydrogen. In [22], a value of about 30 S cm–1 in hydrogen was obtained for the Sr1.9Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ oxide. The increase in the electrical conductivity of SFNM in wet hydrogen can be explained by several reasons. First is the formation of metallic particles of iron and nickel (or, as mentioned in the literature, the Fe–Ni alloy), which were observed on SEM images of the sample after measurements (Fig. 3 ). As can be seen from the images, there are accumulations of small particles in the pores of the sample, as well as between the SFNM grains. Since the Ni and Fe particles appear in the grain boundary region, the local defect structure of the grain boundaries would change in order to compensate the exsolution of the Ni and Fe particles and, therefore, lead to an increase in the electrical conductivity. Second reason is the reduction of the molybdenum ions in wet hydrogen according to 2 M o M o × + O O × ↔ 2 M o M o ′ + 1 2 O 2 + V O · · where M o M o × and M o M o ′ denote Mo6+ and Mo5+ ions respectively, which leads to the increase in the Mo5+ concentration and therefore increase in the concentration of the electrons [35]. Another possible reason is the formation of the Sr3FeMoO6.5 phase in wet hydrogen, as was observed by XRD method (see Fig. 1). According to literature data in Sr3FeMoO6.5 molybdenum exists in mixed (4+/5+) oxidation state [36], and the oxide exhibits high level of electronic conductivity. Similar results were obtained in [37], where after the reduction of Sr2FeMo2/3Co1/3O6-δ oxide and the formation of Sr3FeMoO6.5 and Co-Fe nanoparticles the conductivity increased from about 8 to 17 S cm−1 to 49–63 S cm−1. Measurements of electrical conductivity as a function of oxygen pressure were carried out in the pO2 range of 10–20 to 0.21 atm using a virgin SFNM sample. At each pO2 value, the equilibration with the gas phase was achieved and the resistance of the sample stopped changing. An example of the time dependence of the resistance with changing pO2 values at 700 °C is presented in Fig. 4 A. One can see that the equilibration was achieved within a short period of time at each pO2 value, in contrast to the undoped, non-deficit Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ, which was studied by the electrical conductivity relaxation method in [38]. This behavior indicates that Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ exhibits a higher rate of oxygen interfacial exchange than Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ, which is probably due to the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies due to the doping with nickel and the strontium deficiency. Increased activity towards the oxygen exchange reaction can have a positive effect on the electrochemical performance of SFNM electrodes, as will be shown in the next section. Isotherms of electrical conductivity for Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ as a function of oxygen pressure are presented in Fig. 4B. The electrical conductivity decreases with oxygen pressure in the oxidative atmosphere (pO2 >10–5 atm) and increases while the oxygen pressure decreases in reductive conditions (pO2 <10–15 atm), which is typical for Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ based oxides [34]. Hole carriers (Fe4+) provide the main contribution to charge transfer under oxidative conditions (pO2 > 10−5 atm), and their concentration decreases with decreasing oxygen partial pressure. Under reducing conditions, electron carriers (Fe2+ and Mo5+) dominate the conduction process, and their concentration increases with decreasing pO2. The slopes of the dependencies are 0.16–0.22 and –0.18 in oxidative and reductive conditions, respectively, which is close to ¼ and –¼. Some deviations in the slopes may be caused by the influence of the introduction of Ni and a strontium deficiency on the concentration and mobility of electron hole carriers. Doping with nickel, as well as the strontium deficiency, should also lead to the appearance of oxygen vacancies for charge compensation and, therefore, increase the oxygen-ionic conductivity. However, the contribution of oxygen-ionic conductivity to the total conductivity is known to be minor, and, therefore, this effect cannot be detected by conventional 4 probe DC measurements."
8,Electrode performance,"3.3 Electrode performance The electrode performance was studied on the symmetrical electrochemical cells with the LSGM supporting electrolyte. Additionally, two samples with SFM electrodes were prepared and investigated. Four samples (two SFNM and two SFM) were simultaneously placed in a measuring rig [39]. The electrochemical measurements were first carried out in air. Then, without cooling, the air in the furnace was substituted with argon, then with the 5 vol.% H2 + Ar mixture, and, after an hour, with wet hydrogen, with subsequent exposure of the samples in wet hydrogen during two hours before measurements. Fig. 5 shows the obtained temperature dependencies of electrode polarization resistances (Rη). The dependencies of Rη in air for both SFNM and SFM electrodes had linear-type behavior, with close activation energy values of about 125 kJ mol–1. After substitution of air with wet hydrogen, the polarization resistance for the SFM electrode decreased approximately twice at a temperature of 800°С, with a decrease in activation energy from 121 to 82 kJ mol–1, while the dependency was still linear. A similar behavior for the SFM electrode was observed by Bernadet et al. [40]. For the SFNM electrode, only a slight decrease in polarization resistance from 0.1 to 0.08 Ohm cm2 at 800°С was observed when air was substituted with wet hydrogen (Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). On the other hand, at 600°С in wet hydrogen, the polarization resistance of SFNM decreased by more than seven times compared to air. In [23], the polarization resistance for the Sr2Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ electrode in wet hydrogen at 800°С was reported to be 0.65 Ohm cm2, which is seven times higher than that obtained in our study. These differences can be caused by many factors, e.g., differences in electrode microstructure. It should be noted that the temperature dependency of the polarization resistance in wet H2 for the SFNM electrode is non-linear, with activation energy values of about 38 and 79 kJ mol–1 in the temperature regions of 750–800°С and 600–650°С, respectively. Such behavior can be observed when the gas-phase diffusion of the potential-determining components (water and hydrogen here) in the anode pores makes a significant contribution to the electrode polarization resistance, which was discussed in detail in [39,41,42]. Then, the question of why we did not observe such behavior in the case of the SFM electrode arises. To understand this, we performed DRT analysis of the impedance data for SFM and SFNM electrodes. Impedance spectra for the SFNM electrode in air and wet hydrogen at 800°С are presented in Fig. 6 A. For the oxidative condition, there is one semicircle on the spectrum without clear separation of half-arcs. In wet hydrogen, the form of the spectrum changed significantly. Two visible semicircles are observed, which is similar to the data presented in [23]. The DRT analysis of the impedance data has shown that the rate of the ORR on SFM and SFNM electrodes is mostly determined by one process with a relaxation frequency of 1–10 Hz (Fig. 6B), which is attributed to the low rate of oxygen exchange between the electrode and the gas phase [19,43]. In the case of the SFNM electrode, the contribution of this process was smaller, indicating an increase in the rate of exchange due to the appearance of additional oxygen vacancies due to the strontium deficiency and doping with nickel. Fig. 6B also presents the DRT function for the SFNM electrode in wet hydrogen. It can be seen that the mechanism of HOR is completely different from those for the ORR. Similar results for the ORR and HOR on the SFM electrode while changing the gas environment from oxidative to reductive conditions were published earlier [15], and it was shown that the rate of the HOR was almost limited by the rate of adsorbed hydrogen dissociation on the SFM surface. In the current study, the DRT analysis for the SFNM electrode has shown that the resistance of the low-frequency stage (the area under the low-frequency peak on the DRT function) does not depend on temperature (Fig. 6C), which unambiguously indicates the gas diffusion nature of the low-frequency stage of hydrogen oxidation [39,41,42] on the SFNM electrode. This assumption was confirmed by the results of the impedance studies of SFNM electrodes performed with different organization of the current leads to the investigated sample. Such an approach has previously been reported [39]. Connection of the current leads through a stack of three samples when the sample being studied is in the center minimizes gas-phase difficulties, and the low-frequency part of the impedance spectrum is no longer recorded (Fig. 6D). The last question that should be discussed is why the nature of the rate-determining stage of hydrogen oxidation changes from hydrogen dissociation on SFM [16] to gas diffusion on SFNM. When iron is partially substituted with nickel and the sample is treated in wet hydrogen, metallic iron and nickel (Ni–Fe alloy) particles exsolve on the oxide surface. It is well known that nickel exhibits high catalytic activity towards hydrogen oxidation [44,45], and it has a high hydrogen surface diffusion coefficient [46,47], which is several orders of magnitude higher than the oxygen surface diffusion coefficient [48,49]. In addition, it has a high rate of hydrogen interfacial exchange with the gas phase [50]. Consequently, hydrogen adsorption and dissociation on SFNM occur at a high rate on nickel particles and do not limit the HOR rate, in contrast to the SFM electrode. On the other hand, iron and nickel particles agglomerate in the pores of the SFNM electrode, significantly reducing its porosity, which is clearly seen from microphotographs shown in Fig. 7 . Estimation of the porosity of the electrodes after tests showed that the porosity of the SFM electrode increased by about 8%, which can be caused by slight sintering of the electrode during the experiments. At the same time, the porosity of the SFNM electrode decreased by almost 19%, due to the appearance of particles of nickel and iron in the pores, which is the reason for the large contribution of gas diffusion processes to the polarization resistance of the SFNM electrode. To make sure that small particles in SFNM formed after heat treatment in hydrogen (Fig. 7) are not the consequence of the sample preparation or polishing for SEM studies, additional samples were prepared from the same slurry and under the same conditions as described in the experimental part. One of the samples was treated in wet hydrogen and other sample in air at 800 °C for four days. Then the samples were cooled to room temperature without ambient change. Thereafter, the samples were broken in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the supporting electrolyte and then without any processing SEM images were obtained (Fig. 7). On a sample not subjected to reduction treatment, the boundaries between the electrode particles are clearly visible. The boundaries are well-defined, no inclusions were found on the surface of the particles. After the reduction treatment, the morphology of the electrode changes dramatically. All particle boundaries are uneven and look similar to the microstructure, which is obtained after wet impregnation of the electrodes [51,52], i.e. there are smaller particles on the electrode particles. In contrast to the works [23,24], in our case, the formed particles are quite larger. Probably, this is due to the much longer times of holding the samples in reducing conditions, about 4 days (about 100 h), and higher temperature that in [23,24]. It can be assumed that with an increase in the duration of the reduction treatment, the exsoluted particles of iron and nickel agglomerate on the electrode and, as mentioned earlier, reduce its porosity. Unfortunately, to perform analysis of exsoluted particles by the EDX method is not possible since the limitations of this method because the sample area from which the EDX detector collects data is significantly larger than the particle size."
9,Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell testing,"3.4 Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell testing SFNM tests as fuel and oxygen electrodes of symmetric SOFC were performed on a sample with an LSGM supporting electrolyte with 300 μm thickness. During the measurements, ambient air was supplied to the oxygen electrode at a rate of 5 l h−1, and the fuel mixture was supplied at a rate of 4 l h−1. Before the experiments, the possible maximum power density for the SOFC was estimated. The resistance of the LSGM electrolyte at 800 °C is about 7.8 Ohm cm, which, considering the thickness of 300 μm, gives a value of 0.23 Ohm. At a current density of 1 A cm–2 at 800 °C and an OCV of –1.1 V, the maximum power density (excluding the electrode polarization resistance) of 0.87 W cm–2 can be achieved. Thus, in [22], using SFNM as an anode and highly active La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3–δ as a cathode at 800°С and a current density of 1 A cm–2, power densities of about 0.8 W cm–2 were obtained. In [24], at 800 °C and a current density of 1 A cm–2, the authors reported a power density of about 0.6 W cm–2, also using the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3–δ cathode. In addition to ohmic losses, it is also necessary to consider the voltage drop due to the electrode polarization. Assuming that the U–I dependency is linear, in which the slope is equal to the polarization resistance, we can estimate the possible maximum SOFC power density by considering ohmic and polarization losses. Therefore, if we take into account the polarization resistance values for the SFNM cathode and anode at 800 °C (Table 1), we can conclude that the total cell voltage drop due to polarization of the electrodes at 1 A cm–2 is about 0.18 V. By adding this value to the voltage drop due to ohmic resistance, we find that the maximum possible power density in our case is about 0.69 W cm–2 at 800 °C. According to the results, the power density of about 0.5 W cm–2 at 1 A cm–2 and 800 °C was achieved with the SFNM/LSGM/SFNM fuel cell (Fig. 8 ). The discrepancies in the calculated values ​​are probably related to contact resistances and, possibly, to the non-linear behavior of the cathode and anode polarization dependencies. While the temperature decreases, the power density also decreases to about 0.3 W cm–2 at 700°С and 0.12 W cm–2 at 600°С. When a mixture of 70% CH4 and 30% H2O was fed to the anode, the fuel cell tests showed power densities of about 0.15 W cm–2 at 700 °C, which is about two times lower than in the case of using wet hydrogen as a fuel."
10,Conclusions,"A detailed investigation of the promising Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ electrode material was performed. The phase stability of the oxide in different gas environments was studied using the XRD technique. After heat treatment of the oxide in wet hydrogen, the exsolution of Ni–Fe particles takes place. The electrical conductivity of Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ was studied as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure. An increase in the electrical conductivity in the hydrogen-containing atmosphere was observed. Low electrode polarization values were obtained for the Sr1.95Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5O6–δ electrode, both in air and wet hydrogen. A detailed analysis of the impedance data by the DRT method showed that the nature of the rate-determining stage for the oxygen reduction reaction is the same as in case of Sr1.95Fe1.5Mo0.5O6–δ, and this is attributed to the slow oxygen exchange between the electrode and the gas phase. Contrarily, in wet hydrogen, the nature of the rate-determining stage of hydrogen oxidation changes from hydrogen dissociation on SFM to gas diffusion on SFNM. This phenomenon can be explained by the appearance of nickel particles in the hydrogen-containing atmosphere, which have high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen oxidation reaction and, therefore, accelerate the reaction stages connected with hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. However, this finding creates questions concerning the possible degradation of electrode performance in a hydrogen atmosphere with the high partial pressure of water, similar to Ni-cermet electrodes, and the necessity of further long-term experiments. During the fuel cell tests of the symmetrical cell based on the LSGM electrolyte, a maximum power density of about 0.5 W cm–2 at 1 A cm–2 and 800 °C was achieved."
