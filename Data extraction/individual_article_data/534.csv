0,Introduction,"The combustion of fossil fuels for heat and power generation has posed increasingly serious threats to the environment and public health [1,2]. The development of cleaner energy sources to replace fossil fuels is therefore of vital importance for global sustainable development [3–5]. Among various possible alternatives, hydrogen is considered as an ideal one because the only product resulting from its oxidation during combustion or in fuel cells is H2O [6–8]. In addition to this, hydrogen has very high energy density on a mass basis, being about 1.42 million joules per kilogram, superior to those of gasoline and natural gas by over three folds. Thermochemical methods with/without the aid of catalysts can extract hydrogen from hydrocarbons. Among possible feedstocks, methanol has been widely used due to its activity at low temperatures. Nobel Prize laureate George Andrew Olah (in 1994) championed the idea of a methanol-based economy as an alternative to the current world economy based on fossil fuels [9]. His method was to capture carbon dioxide, a single-carbon gas, and turn it into methanol, single-carbon alcohol, to create a renewable source of energy that helped to reduce greenhouse gas in the atmosphere [10,11]. Alternatively, methanol (CH3OH) can be reformed into hydrogen (H2) and carbon oxide (COx), making it a safe and effective hydrogen carrier. Unlike methane (CH4), which is a combustible gas with a high H/C ratio of 4:1, methanol, which is a liquid under atmospheric pressure at room temperature, is a safer carrier of hydrogen with an equally high H/C ratio. Its boiling point at 65 °C allows for facile vaporization in roughly the same temperature range as that for water, making it more stable than liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Besides safety issues, methanol, which is metabolized by natural organisms in the environment and is miscible with water, generates less environmental impact than oil or gasoline does. Lastly, methanol is easier to activate at low temperatures because it contains no carbon–carbon bonds that must be broken [12,13]. Therefore, it can be converted to hydrogen at lower temperatures (150 ~ 350 °C) than most other fuels can (>500 °C). Presently, there are four main approaches for hydrogen production [14]: (1) thermochemical methods such as natural gas reforming [15,16] as well as gasification of coal [17] and biomass [18,19]; (2) electrochemical methods [20–22], (3) photocatalysis [23,24]; and (4) biological methods. Among these approaches, thermochemical methods are of the greatest potential for commercialization or large-scale product inasmuch as the heat required for the processes is widely accessible and very stable [25,26]. When one is concerned with feedstocks for hydrogen production, methanol is considered as a promising candidate. There are four thermochemical routes commonly used to produce hydrogen from methanol; they are steam reforming (SR) [27], partial oxidation (POX) [28,29], autothermal reforming (ATR) [30,31], and catalytic decomposition (CD) [32]. SR and CD require external heating for triggering the chemical reaction. POX is an alternative to SR, which relies on the partial combustion of the methanol to provide heat for the reforming reaction. ATR is a method in between, combining SR and POX. Regardless of which selection of these techniques, optimized operating conditions and the preparation of catalysts hold a key for maximizing hydrogen output [33,34]. Among the methods introduced above, SR has the highest hydrogen yield. Being an endothermic reaction, however, it requires external heating during the reaction, which entails extra cost. In contrast, POX is a cost-efficient alternative since it is an exothermic reaction, thereby requiring no external heating. [23] Using methanol as a feedstock for hydrogen production, the equations of SR and POX are expressed as follows: SR (1) CH 3 O H + H 2 O ⇌ 3 H 2 + CO 2 , Δ H 298 0 = 49.5 k J mol - 1 POX (2) CH 3 O H + 0.5 O 2 ⇌ 2 H 2 + CO 2 , Δ H 298 0 = - 192.3 k J mol - 1 The most commonly adopted catalysts for hydrogen production from methanol include copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and platinum (Pt), while Al2O3 and SiO2 are often selected as supports for catalyst loading [35,36]. The porous structure of Al2O3 can serve to hold and protect particles of the selected catalyst during the hydrogen generation reaction. Al2O3 is an ideal supporter because of its resistance to high temperature and high pressure, low water absorption, and stable chemical properties. However, it will be converted into different phases (θ, δ, α, γ phases) at high temperatures [37,38], thereby driving the decrement of thermal stability [39]. Supplementary materials can be embedded in Al2O3 to improve its thermal stability. For example, it has been found that certain oxides such as ThO2, ZrO2, and SiO2 can enhance the thermal stability of Al2O3 [40,41]. In light of this, SiO2, which has the merit of low cost, is selected to combine with Al2O3 in forming supporting structures for preparing hydrogen-generating catalysts. To successfully coat SiO2 onto Al2O3 spheres and keep an adequate amount of pores on the surface to withhold the particles of catalysts, a porous, 3D-network structure of SiO2 is desirable. Such an ideal structure lies in fine-tuning raw materials, say, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol, water, acids, and bases, for the sol-gel process through which SiO2 is produced. One way to manipulate the structure and physical properties of SiO2 produced via the sol-gel method is to control the pH of TEOS-Si(OC2H5)4 solutions, the precursor of SiO2 [42–45]. It is because the sol-gel chemistry of silica is catalyzed by either acid or base [46]. This consequently leads to significant differences in the structure of SiO2 produced, considering the relative rates of the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the two environments [47]. According to the study of Danks et al. [46], the hydrolysis resulted in the replacement of an alkoxy group by a hydroxyl with a pentacoordinate transition state in both acid- and base-catalyzed systems. In the case of acid catalysts such as hydroxy-carboxylic acids or tartaric acid [48], smaller SiO2 particles with a 3D-network structure will be formed. Conversely, in an environment of high pH values, larger and isolated SiO2 particles will be produced. This suggests that the acid catalysts are related to the production of SiO2 with a 3D-network structure via the sol-gel method. In recent years, torrefaction has been widely investigated for producing biochar as an alternative to coal consumed in the industry. Torrefaction liquid products (TLPs), consisting of 16 wt% (350 °C) up to 49% (250 °C) organic acids among other components such as water, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones [49], are water-soluble organic by-products from industrial biomass torrefaction. In past studies, TLPs have been used as fuels [50,51]. Typically, TLPs exhibit low pH values in that their values are between 2 and 3 [49]. Therefore, TLPs can potentially be used as acid catalysts in the sol-gel process for SiO2 production. This utilization can enhance the economy of the torrefaction process while producing solid fuels or biochars, thereby achieving a circular economy. In addition, compared to the use of inorganic acids such as HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, and H3PO4 as catalysts for the sol-gel synthesis of SiO2, TLPs are environmentally friendly because they do not require chemical treatments after the completion of the sol-gel process. It should be pointed out that similar work using TLPs for catalyst preparation to produce hydrogen has never been investigated or reported in the open literature. For this reason, the present study aims to carry out an assessment of the utilization of TLPs. The performance of hydrogen production from the partial oxidation of methanol with the prepared catalyst will be analyzed. Aside from acting as a fuel, from the catalyst preparation point of view, TLPs can even be thought of as a value-added chemical from biomass torrefaction."
1,Methodology,
2,Parameters for torrefaction,"2.1 Parameters for torrefaction The biomass used in this study was rubberwood obtained from Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in Taiwan. Every batch of the wood sawdust used in the experiment was grounded by a crusher and sieved through the 100-mesh sieve. After sieving, the raw material was dried in an oven at 105 °C for 24 h to eliminate the moisture. A sample weight (30 g) of wood sawdust was placed in a sample glass tube mounted to a furnace, which was heated to 300 °C under N2 environment. Through torrefaction, TLPs were extracted from the sawdust and collected in sample bottles, which were then stored at −4 °C until use."
3,Preparation SiO2/Al2O3 spheres,"2.2 Preparation SiO2/Al2O3 spheres Tetraethyl orthosilicate, namely, TEOS, (Si(OC2H5)4, 99.99%, Aldrich Chemical Co.), ethanol (99.9%, Sigma Chemical Co.), and ammonia water (NH3(aq), 28–30%, Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd.) were used as starting materials without any pretreatment. The commercial catalyst (Green Hydrotech Inc.) of h-BN-Pt/Al2O3 was utilized to elicit POM. The samples of h-BN-Pt/Al2O3 and reactive alumina (Al2O3) were spherical particles with a diameter of 5 mm. A Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by a simple sol-gel method adopted from the literature [25]. Meanwhile, TLPs were obtained from the torrefaction of rubberwood (Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in Taiwan). TLPs (1.6 mL) were dissolved in 2 mL of ethanol and stirred at room temperature for 10 min, as shown in Fig. 1 . Then TEOS (3.2 mL) was added and stirred followed by the addition of reactive alumina and stirring for 1 h. The alkaline aqueous solution, 1 M NH3(aq) (1.6 mL) was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol and 5 mL of deionized water and then was stirred at room temperature for a few minutes. The alkaline aqueous solution was added to the TEOS solution and stirred for 6 h. The conditions of the reaction solutions are tabulated in Table 1 . The samples A0 and A1 showed the SiO2 produced from TEOS via the sol-gel synthesis in the NH3(aq) solution or TLPs environments without Al2O3. The sample A2 showed Al2O3 for the comparison with other supporters. The samples A3-A7 showed that SiO2 was coated on Al2O3 support via the sol-gel synthesis under different conditions of alkaline aqueous and TEOS solutions. The precursors were calcined and obtained SiO2@Al2O3 was annealed at 500 °C in an air atmosphere for 4 h to obtain SiO2@Al2O3 powder of spherical particles."
4,Catalyst preparation,"2.3 Catalyst preparation The Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 catalyst (with 0.06 g Pt/30.0 g SiO2@Al2O3 loading) was prepared using a conventional impregnation method. The SiO2@Al2O3 was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Platinic chloride hexahydrate/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (H2PtCl6·(H2O)6 and PVP, Aldrich Chemical Co.) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by drying at 110 °C for 2 h. The dried sample was reduced by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution, and then washed with deionized water and dried at 110 °C for 24 h."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization The BET surface area and porosity of the prepared catalysts were determined using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 apparatus. A high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI SU-5000) was used to characterize and examine the characteristics of the Pt deposited on SiO2@Al2O3 internal surface. The concentration of Pt was measured using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS THERMO-ELEMENT XR)."
6,Catalyst testing for partial oxidation of methanol (POM),"2.5 Catalyst testing for partial oxidation of methanol (POM) The prepared catalysts were tested for hydrogen production via POM in a spray reaction system. Details of the experimental procedures and operating conditions for POM could be found in previous reports [52,53]. POM tests were carried out under the operation conditions of the cold start or with preheating. When the preheating mode was operated, the catalyst bed was preheated to 100 °C before the onset of the POM experiment. The composition of the product gas was analyzed by a gas analyzer (GA, Fuji ZRJF5Y23-AERYR-YKLYYCY-A) and gas chromatography (GC, SRI 310C TCD). To avoid damaging the sensors installed in the GA, the moisture in the product gas was eliminated in two steps: condensation and drying in a condenser and a dryer, respectively. The volumetric concentrations of CO, CH4, and CO2 were monitored by the GA, while the concentration of H2 was measured by the GC. The measured data were recorded at a frequency of 3 min−1. To ensure the experimental quality, the electric flow rate controllers were periodically calibrated by a flow rate meter (Gillan-Stander Flow Cell-P/N 800266-1), while the GA was calibrated by a standard gas and the calibration curve of H2 in the GC were established prior to performing experiments. The experiment lasted around 50 min, which was long enough to achieve the steady state. In the final stage, the volumetric concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane were measured by the GA. Based on these concentrations, the methanol conversion could be calculated as follows (3) C H 3 O H c o n v e r s i o n % = n ̇ C O 2 , o u t + n ̇ CO , o u t + n ̇ C H 4 , o u t n ̇ C H 3 O H , i n × 100 where n ̇ stood for the molar flow rate (mol min−1), and the subscripts in and out designated inflow and outflow, respectively. Meanwhile, the volumetric concentration of hydrogen was measured with the GC, which indicates the gas concentration in terms of integral areas. To convert areas into comparable percentages, a calibration curve was created by linear regression based on data collected from five different H2 concentrations, namely 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30%. Based on the measured molar flow rate of outlet hydrogen and inlet methanol, the H2 yield was defined as: (4) H 2 y i e l d m o l / m o l C H 3 O H = n ̇ H 2 n ̇ C H 3 O H"
7,Operating conditions for POM,"2.6 Operating conditions for POM In the experiments, the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and O2/C ratio were fixed at 10,000 h−1 and 0.6, respectively. To provide a basis for the experiments, the flow rate of methanol was fixed at 1 mL min−1 (at 25 °C). To control GHSV and O2/C ratio in the experiments, N2 was used as a balance gas to meet the requirement of the feed gas (air + N2) flow rate. POM is an exothermic reaction in which methanol oxidation releases heat in the reaction process. Because the present study focuses on the partial oxidation of methanol without additional heat supplied, the reaction temperature is exhibited autothermally which is non-linearly affected by the platinum amount (oxidation catalyst). In other words, unlike past reported studies, the reaction temperature is not controlled in this work."
8,Results and discussion,
9,TLPs characterization,"3.1 TLPs characterization Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is an instrumental technique consisting of a gas chromatograph (GC) coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS). It allows complex mixtures of chemicals to be separated, identified, and quantified and is thus ideal for the analysis of TLPs. Table 2 and Fig. 2 show the composition of TLPs resulting from the torrefaction of rubberwood sawdust in N2 at 300 °C for 60 min. Such products were largely made up of condensable components such as phenols, acids, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones."
10,SiO2 and Al2O3 characterization,"3.2 SiO2 and Al2O3 characterization As discussed earlier, the physical properties (such as bulk density and percentage of porosity) of the resultant SiO2 are a function of the pH of the catalyst added to TEOS [54]. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the calcined samples of SiO2 resulting from the sol-gel synthesis of two different mixtures: (1) TEOS-ammonium (alkaline) (the small picture embedded in Fig. 3a), and (2) TEOS-TLPs (acidic) (the small picture embedded in Fig. 3b. For the first case, namely, the ammonium hydroxide system, Fig. 3a depicts that the SiO2 particles appear to be spherical and have an average particle size below 300 nm. For the second case, Fig. 3b reveals that narrower and uniform pores on the TLPs-catalyzed SiO2 surface are observed. In addition, the SiO2 assembly particles are very small and dense. The difference in the physical properties of the SiO2 derived from TEOS via the sol-gel synthesis in the basic and acid environments presented above can be elucidated by examining the graphical presentation shown in Fig. 4 [46,55]. Overall, when the pH of the TEOS solution is low to a certain value, the formed SiO2 is characterized by a three-dimensional network structure. Alternatively, the higher the pH value of the TEOS solution, the larger the formed SiO2 particles. The sol-gel experiments adopting the steps presented in Fig. 1 were performed to modify the surface of aluminum spheres using TLPs and aqueous ammonia solutions. First, ethanol and LTPs were mixed into a TEOS solution, which was then placed in an aluminum ball for 1 h. Then, the alkaline aqueous solution was added to the TEOS solution and stirred for 6 h. The obtained precursors were calcined and the SiO2@Al2O3 spheres were annealed at 500 °C in an air atmosphere for 4 h to obtain the resulting SiO2@Al2O3 spheres. Fig. 5 a and b show the SEM images of the Al2O3 spheres with and without a layer of SiO2 coated onto their surface. Fig. 5a shows the rough surface of the original Al2O3 sphere. Here the size of even the smallest pores on the surface is greater than 2 μm, which is too large to hold the particles of the Pt catalyst (10–300 nm, see Fig. 6 ). Another factor unfavorable for loading Pt onto Al2O3 spheres is the dense and smooth property of Al2O3 [56]. With a coating layer of SiO2, which drastically modifies the morphology of the surface (Fig. 5b), the SiO2@Al2O3 structure serves as a better supporter of Pt particles."
11,SEM analysis for Pt/SiO2@Al2O3,"3.3 SEM analysis for Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 After coating SiO2 onto the Al2O3 spheres, the resulted SiO2@Al2O3 spheres were used as catalyst supporters. The platinum catalyst was then applied onto the surface of the SiO2@Al2O3 spheres via impregnation. In the impregnation process, the uncoated Al2O3 and Al2O3 coated with SiO2 are impregnated with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (H2O)6/polyvinyl pyrrolidone [57,58]. As shown in Fig. 1, the Pt catalysts were prepared through a reduction in the NaBH4 solution and then washed with DI water. The SEM images of the surfaces of Pt/A2 (a), Pt/A3 (b), Pt/A4 (c), Pt/A5 (d), Pt/A6 (e), Pt/A7 (f), and h-BN Pt/Al2O3 (g) catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 in which their catalyst pellets are also shown. In contrast to h-BN Pt/Al2O3, which has an average particle size of less than 100 nm (Fig. 6g), the average size of the platinum particles found on the surface of the other materials under study ranges between 300 and 400 nm. As can be observed in Fig. 6a, the application of Pt catalyst directly onto uncoated Al2O3 supporter resulted in a smaller quantity and uneven distribution of Pt particles. In contrast, Fig. 6b–f depict that coating SiO2 on the Al2O3 supporter can significantly improve the quality and distribution of Pt particles applied on the supporter via impregnation. More interestingly, among the five cases shown in Fig. 6b–f, those concerning the addition of TLPs as acid catalyst (see Table 1 for more details of the experimental settings) clearly exhibit finer particles with better coverage as compared to the Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 setting in Fig. 6b, representing the case without TLPs addition. In addition, the last case shown in Fig. 6g is a commercialized catalyst which is used as a reference."
12,BET analysis,"3.4 BET analysis The measured BET surface areas of the A2, Pt/A2, A3, Pt/A3, Pt/A4, Pt/A5, Pt/A6, and Pt/A7 samples are sketched in Fig. 7 [59]. Among these samples, it appears that the Al2O3 without coating SiO2, namely, A2, has the highest BET surface area (325 cm2 g−1). This implies that the uncoated Al2O3 sample is the most porous among all the materials under study. For the Pt/A2 catalyst, its surface area is 321 cm2g−1 which is close to A2. It is thus recognized that the influence of adding Pt into A2 on the surface area is slight. After SiO2 is coated onto Al2O3 (A3), however, the sample’s surface is down to 239 cm2 g−1, while Pt/A3 catalyst has a surface area of 236 cm2 g−1. Even though the surface area of Al2O3 is lowered once it is coated by SiO2, its thermal stability can be intensified [40,41]. After TLPs are adopted as acid catalysts, Fig. 7 depicts that the surface areas of the five Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 (Pt/A3-A7) catalysts are between 221 and 241 cm2 g−1, indicating that the addition of TLPs has an ignorable impact on the surface areas of the catalyst."
13,ICP-MS analysis for Pt catalyst,"3.5 ICP-MS analysis for Pt catalyst For a quantitative assessment of platinum catalysts applied onto the catalyst supporter materials in this study, a known amount of each of the prepared catalysts was soaked in aqua regia, allowing platinum dissolved completely from the catalysts [60]. The dissolved platinum was detected and quantified employing an ICP-MS system [61]. Fig. 8 presents the results of this quantitative assessment, and it shows that the addition of SiO2 to Al2O3 supporters helps increase the amount of Pt catalyst coated to the supporter. Without SiO2 doping, the quantity of platinum on the supporter was found to be within 22–32 ppm. As a whole, the addition of SiO2 to Al2O3 supporters intensifies the loading capacity of the supporter, except for Pt/A6. Specifically, the formulas A4, A5, and A7 result in an increase of Pt loading by approximately 29–50%, whereas the Pt amount in Pt/A6 is close to Pt/A2 which does not coat SiO2 on the supporter. Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that the performance of formulas A4 and A5 in terms of Pt loading is as good as that of the reference commercial catalyst h-BN Pt/Al2O3."
14,Reaction phenomena of POM,"3.6 Reaction phenomena of POM The temporal distributions of reaction temperature, H2 yield, and CH3OH conversion of POM for all of the prepared catalysts (from Pt/A2 to Pt/A7) and the commercial catalyst are profiled in Fig. 9 . Fig. 9a shows that the reaction temperature rises rapidly after the onset of the experiment. This suggests that the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst can initiate POM in a shorter time. The reaction temperatures of all the catalysts under study including the reference (commercial catalyst) reached 500 °C within the reaction time of 40 min. This suggests a success of the Pt catalysts prepared in this work, which is comparable to the past studies [52,53]. While most methanol was converted into gaseous products, the temporal profiles of CH3OH conversion with all of the tested catalysts (Fig. 9b) show conversion rates that are higher than 92% with the sole exception of Pt/A6 (84%). The equation for CH3OH conversion has been laid out in section 2.6. According to this definition, methanol conversion can be regarded as a result of carbon balance. The lower conversion of the Pt/A6 catalyst might be explained by the lowest Pt content in the catalyst (Fig. 8). In addition to this, the size of the catalyst particles might be another important factor responsible for the efficiency in the CH3OH conversion of the catalysts. It is because, as discussed earlier, the samples of formulas A4, A5, and A7 may have been loaded with amounts of Pt particles comparable to that of the reference catalyst. The temporal profiles of H2 yield in mol/(mol methanol) under the prepared and reference catalysts are shown in Fig. 9c. It indicates that the variation of H2 formation from the chemical reaction (POM) is not pronounced after the time of 30 min. The H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 concentrations in the product gases, CH3OH conversion, and H2 yield using different catalysts are given in Table 3 . The reference catalyst (h-BN Pt/Al2O3) leads to the H2 yield of approximately 1.18 mol/(mol methanol). As for the prepared catalysts, the H2 yield is in the range of 0.93–1.35 mol/(mol methanol), exhibiting their capacity in converting methanol to hydrogen being commensurable to that of the reference catalyst [62]. The catalyst obtained from the formula A7 appears to be the most productive in terms of the H2 yield, exhibiting an overwhelming H2 yield up to 1.35 mol/(mol methanol). To ensure the performance of the prepared catalysts, the temporal profiles of hydrogen concentration in the long-term tests of the commercial and Pt/A7 catalysts are shown in Fig. 10 where the preceding experimental conditions are adopted. It is clear that the performances of the two catalysts are stable in the course of 20-h running, showing the good stability of the prepared catalyst. In addition, a survey on the performance of various precious-metal-based catalysts such as Pt, zinc oxide, copper, lanthanum, etc, is performed, and the results are summarized in Table 4 . The reaction conditions, process parameters, and conversion efficiency of the Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 catalysts in this study are integrated, allowing a comparison with other catalyst systems. Based on CH3OH conversion, the prepared Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 catalysts using TLPs exhibit pretty good performance."
15,Conclusions,"A novel and cost-effective approach to prepare Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 catalysts for triggering the partial oxidation of methanol and hydrogen production has been developed. In the catalyst preparation process, torrefaction liquid products (TLPs) are employed as an acid catalyst in sol-gel synthesis to aid in SiO2 coating onto Al2O3 to produce thermally stable supporter where an innovative two-step sol-gel process is employed. In the first step, TEOS is allowed to react in an acidic environment to form an adhesive cross-link structure. Then, in the second step, the solution continues in a basic environment to form a porous 3D-network with enlarged particles. SEM images suggest that the TLPs-catalyzed SiO2 is characterized by narrower and more uniform pores. The synthesized catalyst supporters of Al2O3 coated with SiO2 have lower surface areas compared to the Al2O3 without SiO2. Nevertheless, the Pt concentrations in the prepared Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 catalysts are close to that of a commercial catalyst (h-BN Pt/Al2O3). With a suitable combination of Pt, SiO2, and Al2O3, the experimental results indicate that the methanol conversion from the prepared catalysts is beyond 92%, except for Pt/A6 catalyst. The H2 yield is between 0.93 and 1.35 mol/(mol methanol) which is in a comparable state compared to the commercial catalyst. Accordingly, it is concluded that TLPs can be employed as acid catalysts for the sol-gel synthesis of SiO2 for enhancing the thermal stability of Al2O3 supporter and Pt/SiO2@Al2O3 catalysts which can effectively convert methanol to hydrogen. This novel approach for the utilization of TLPs can simultaneously achieve the hydrogen economy from hydrogen production and bioeconomy from biochar production and TLPs application, thereby implementing a more economically competitive production process in the industry."
