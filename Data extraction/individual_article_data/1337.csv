0,Introduction,"The first-row transition metals are Earth-abundant, cost-effective and have proven an alternative to some other expensive metals (rhodium, ruthenium, iridium palladium, and platinum) [1–7]. Amongst transition metals, manganese has attracted the researchers because of its bio-compatibility and natural abundance (3rd most abundant in the Earth's crust) making it a valuable ingredient in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries [8]. The low toxicity [9] and cost effectiveness [10] of manganese, aid the synthetic chemist as an appealing replacement for the precious metals (rhodium, ruthenium, iridium palladium, and platinum) based catalysts. Manganese is an essential trace element and a key ingredient which features in enzymes assisting in metabolizing carbohydrates, cholesterol and amino acids in the living human cell [11,12]. Due to incompletely filled d-orbital and half shell effect manganese exhibit potential redox activity and multiple oxidation states (–3 to +7) resulting in coordination compounds exhibiting a coordination number up to 7 [13]. Multiple oxidation states of manganese are responsible for a variety of reactivity, with high oxidation-state manganese species are powerful oxidising agents e.g. MnO2 and KMnO4, whereas low oxidation-state manganese compounds unveil chemistry similar to the main group compounds [RMn(II)X reagents correspond to Grignard reagents] [14]. Manganese-based coordination compounds have been extensively used in oxidative radical reactions [15], telomerisation of alkenes [16], and polymerization [17] processes. Mn-based catalysts are also capable of performing several cross-coupling reactions involving Grignard reagents [14], hydrosilylation of carbonyl compounds [18,19,11–14], electrochemical CO2 reduction [20], direct C–H activation processes [21–23], and hydrogenation [24]. Amongst several organic transformations, transition metal-catalyzed alcohol valorisation has been extensively investigated. Alcohols are key components in the synthetic chemists’ toolbox and cardinal source for chemical manufacturing [25–27]. Transition metal catalysts are key ingredients in (a) direct oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters [28] (b) alkylation reactions with alcohols which are further categorized in N-alkylation of amines, amides and Guerbet type condensation of alcohols leading to their dimerization [29] (c) oxidation of alcohols with amines and ammonia surrogates such as NH4Cl, (NH4)2CO3, (NH4)2SO4 etc to amides and cyanides [30] (d) olefination of alcohols leading to higher olefins [31] (e) multi-component reactions leading to the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds [32]. Conventionally alcohol oxidation involves peroxides, molecular oxygen or air as oxidant and transfer hydrogenation. However, peroxides are corrosive and generate a copious amount of waste into the environment [33], whereas, the molecular oxygen requires high pressure which makes their usage as an source of oxidants tedious [34]. More recently, acceptor-less dehydrogenation (AD) has emerged as an environmentally benign source for an alcohol oxidation. Amongst all, the Mn-based molecular catalysts have played a pivotal role in the recent advancement in AD reactions as it has several advantages over other transition metals as discussed above. Herein, we have compiled a comprehensive review focusing on alcohol oxidation/activation reactions catalyzed by the manganese-based molecular as well as surface catalysts."
1,Manganese-based molecular and supported catalysts for alcohol oxidation,"The controlled oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds has been widely acknowledged as one of the most fundamental chemical transformations in both the laboratories and industrial scale level [35]. Conventionally employed alcohol oxidation reagents are broadly classified as small molecular reagents such as Swern reagents, Moffatt reagents, Dess-Martin periodinane, metal-based systems such as pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), pyridinium dichromate and ruthenium tetroxide, etc. [36,37]. Moreover, compounds of the first-row transition metal such as titanium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese and Co/Mn/Br-systems by using O2 or H2O2 as oxidising agents also plays more prominent role in alcohol oxidation and biomass-derived hydroxyl methylfurfural (HMF) [25,38–43]. Amongst all the above catalysts, manganese compounds are more promising materials due to their versatile redox behaviour with varying oxidation states II–V and VII. Imperceptible toxicity and minimal environmental hazards have made rapid advancement in the field of manganese catalysis circumventing the high cost with excellent catalytic activity and high turnover numbers under ambient conditions. Manganese based enzymes are present in human physiological systems such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and oxygen-evolving complex photosystem (II) (PS II) [44–46]. Superoxide dismutase plays key role in scavenging the harmful peroxide radical (O2 ) into either ordinary O2 or H2O2. The penta-coordinated mononuclear MnIII metal center act as an active sites in the superoxide dismutase, this active site initiates the binding of the superoxide to the metal center (MnIII) and reducing the active site to form MnII and oxidation of superoxide radical into oxygen. Finally, the catalytic cycle terminates by reduction of superoxide and oxidation of MnII and regeneration of the active sites. Hydrogen peroxide is further degraded by catalase to water and oxygen. The active sites of catalase have the mononuclear-manganese complex recycles between MnII to MnIII. The spectroscopic characterization technique reveals that the MnII to MnIII conversion decomposes hydrogen peroxide [43–47].These interesting observations are useful for designing manganese-based molecular complexes for the alcohol oxidation reaction. In this direction, several manganese complexes based on the enzyme models catalyse the peroxide mediate alcohol oxidation [40–48]. Several manganese based complexes involving ligands such as salen [49], pyridine-2-carboxylic acid [50], polypyridyl [51,52], cross-bridged cyclam system [53], corrole [54], and N 4-tetradentate [55] has been actively controlling reactivity and selectivity for alcohol oxidation has been focused in this section of the review. Homogeneous Mn(II) acetate catalysed alcohol oxidation catalyst using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidant and acetonitrile and TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) with a broad substrate scope and quantitative yields (42–100%) for the respective carbonyl compounds. Primary alcohols and secondary alcohols were converted to their corresponding carboxylic acid and ketones respectively [56]. 2-picolinic acid (PyCOOH)/TEMPO/Mn(NO3)2 based catalytic system display remarkable catalytic activity for aerobic oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols under ambient conditions involving facile isolation and purification processes. The mechanistic investigations shows that oxoammonium ion-assisted aerobic alcohol oxidation has been carried out by using Mn(PyCOOH)/NOx catalytic system [57]. The experimental results shows that NO3 – disproportionate to form volatile NO2 resulting in the catalyst deactivation under open-air conditions impeding the oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III) which hampering the reconversion of TEMPOH back to TEMPO by Mn(III). TEMPO was found to be the active species responsible for the alcohol oxidationvia acid-induced disproportionation of TEMPO+ and TEMPOH. Control experiments unveil that the catalytic amount of NO3 – externally assisted in resuming the catalytic oxidation of various primary alcohols to the respective aldehydes [58] (See Fig. 1 ). In another example Mn(II) salts, pyridine 2-carboxylic acid (PCA) and butanedione show co-operative catalysis for alcohol oxidation using H2O2 as an oxidizing agent under mild reaction conditions giving moderate to high catalytic activity with high turnover numbers (TON = 10,000) [51]. The primary, secondary and benzylic alcohols were oxidized in the respective order such as benzylic > primary > secondary [50]. The mechanistic studies focusing on the reaction components such as ketonic component, ligand component (PCA), Mn(II) salt and solvent revealed that equilibrium between the butanedione co-catalysts and hydrogen peroxide was the predominant factor for enhancing the catalytic performance. The key intermediate gem-hydroxyl-hydroperoxy was responsible for generating catalytically active species form manganese catalyst. Furthermore, the ketone was oxidised to a carboxylic acid proceeded with the onset of substrate conversion. Other salient features for the aforementioned reactions are the stoichiometric ratio of Mn(II): PCA (1:2) is necessary for catalytic activity. Also, highly reactive manganese species formed in the rate-limiting step which indicated that the order of the reaction was zero (See Figs. 2 and 3 ). Non-heme enzymes have been used as potential candidates for highly active and selective oxidation of specific organic substrates for the alcohol oxidation reaction. To match the potential of metalloenzymes, biomimetic small manganese-based inorganic complexes have been synthesized and tested for the alcohol oxidation reaction [59]. Nehru et al. [59] investigated the catalytic activity of the manganese complex with N, N′- dimethyl-N, N′- bis (8-quinolyl) ethane-1,2-diamine, [Mn(BQEN)](OTf)2] for alcohol oxidation in the presence of peracetic acid as the oxidant. O18 labelling experiments showed that alcohol oxidation by CH3CO3H occurred via metal-based oxidants mechanism and not by the auto-oxidation mechanism (See Fig. 4 ). Shen et al. [60] designed the new class of ligands by replacing the pyridine moiety and incorporating the benzimidazole moiety further enhanced the catalytic performance for alcohol oxidation by manganese (II) based complexes. Manganese complexes Mn(S-PMB)(CF3SO3)2(See Fig. 5 ) presented excellent catalytic activity with a turnover number as high as 4700 for several benzylic and aliphatic secondary alcohols using H2O2 as the oxidizing agent and acetic acid as the additive. The electrophilic character manganese-based catalysts with N4 ligand was further corroborated by the Hammett analysis. Vermaak et al. [55] have reported manganese-based BMIMCN = N,N′-dimethyl-N,N′-bis (1-methyl-2-imidazole-methyl) – (R, R/S, S) −1,2-diaminocyclohexane molecular complex for alcohols oxidation (primary, benzylic and allylic alcohols oxidised to their corresponding aldehydes) with up to 96% yield using H2O2 as an oxidizing agent and acetic acid as an additive. Kani et al. [61] have also recently reported some more non-heme manganese-based mixed ligand system containing 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine for the alcohol oxidation using TBHP as an oxidizing agent. Manganese-based mixed ligand systems demonstrated average catalytic activity for benzylic, allylic and aliphatic alcohols (Fig. 6 below). Dai et al. [62] developed inexpensive and easily available porphyrin-based manganese complex as an effective catalyst for oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols with broad substrate scope to their respective aldehydes or ketones with promising yields. This porphyrin-based system witnessed high chemoselectivity for alcohol oxidation under ambient conditions. Moreover, the Hammett analysis confirms the electrophilic nature of the active oxidant for alcohol oxidation (See Fig. 7 ). Zhang et al. [53] have recently reported an efficient bio-inspired manganese(II) complex Mn(Me2EBC)Cl2 highly efficient for benzylic and aliphatic alcohols oxidation and also useful for quantitative conversion of β-O-4 lignin model molecule to corresponding ketone without cleavage of C–C bond in presence of water/acetonitrile solvent system and H2O2 as oxidant. The alcohols bearing more electron-donating functional groups afforded high selectivity for the unsymmetrical 1,2-diols oxidation. (See Fig. 8 ). Manganese-terpyridine (Terpy) and Trpy-derivative catalytic systems highly efficient for the dehydrogenative coupling of amines and alcohols provide an average to good yield for aldimines with a broad substrate scope (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups present on both alcohols and amines) under aerobic reaction conditions (See Fig. 9 )[63]. The bimetallic manganese(0) carbonyl complexes containing chelating or bridging mesoionic di(1,2,3-triazolylidene) ligands were employed for catalytic alcohol oxidation (See Fig. 10 ). The aforementioned catalytic material used for oxidizing the alcohols to obtain a broad range of carbonyl compounds with promising selectivity under mild reaction conditions (40 °C) [64]. Homogeneous manganese catalyst [LMn(l-O)3MnL](PF6)2 (1) and heterogeneous catalyst [LMn(l-O)3MnL]2[SiW12O40] (2) (L is 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, TMTACN) were used for oxidising 1-phenyl ethanol and glycerol to the respective carbonyl derivatives. Kinetic study reveals that manganyl species with “Mn = O” fragment reacts competitively with the alcohol, acetonitrile and hydrogen peroxide. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts efficiently oxidise 1-phenylethanol to acetophenone and glycerol to dihydroxyacetone (DHA) [(45% yield) (See Fig. 11 ) [65]. Superoxide-dismutase mimetic Mn(III) complex with 1,3-bis (5-sulphonatesalycilidenamino) propane was used as a molecular catalyst for glycerol oxidation to glyceraldehyde. There was a rapid decay in the catalytic activity of the aforementioned catalyst which was overcome by adding DMSO, DMF or acetone to the basic buffer system. EPR spectra witnessed an inactive bis-oxo-bridged Mn(IV)Mn(IV) dimer on H2O2 addition [66] (See Fig. 12 ) (See Table 1 for the summary of oxidation of alcohols using homogeneous manganese based catalysts)."
2,Manganese-based homogeneous and supported catalysts for enatioselective alcohol oxidation,"2.1 Manganese-based homogeneous and supported catalysts for enatioselective alcohol oxidation Enantiomerically pure secondary alcohols are a significant class of organic compounds used as chiral auxiliaries in several pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and fine chemical industries. In the last few decades globally, researchers have focused on Mn(III) salen based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative kinetic resolution (OKR) of racemic secondary alcohols. Ahmed et al. [67] have discussed the synthesis and catalytic performance of monomeric, dimeric, macrocyclic, polymeric and silica/resin supported chiral Mn(III)-salen for alcohol oxidation. Herein, we have discussed the most significant and recent advancements in the manganese catalysed enantioselective alcohol oxidation. Xia et al. have used chiral Mn(III)-salen complexes along with (diacetoxyiodo) benzene [PhI(OAc)2] as the co-oxidant have proven to be effective catalyst in CH2Cl2/H2O solvent system showed highly enantioselectivity (krel as high as 450) for the partial oxidation of racemic secondary alcohols to a mixture of the corresponding ketone and chiral alcohol [49,68–79]. Adding bromide salts in sub-stoichiometric amounts with PhI(OAc)2 and a biphasic CH2Cl2/H2O system enhanced enantioselectivity. Later on the detailed mechanistic studies for the alcohol oxidation by the aforesaid manganese complex by Corey and co-workers revealed that PhI(OAc)2 acted as an oxidising agent in the in-situ generation of positive bromine species which assist the oxidation of Mn(III)-salen complex to an Mn(V)-salen complex having composition dibromo-Mn(V) species, this the in-situ generated Mn(V) species assisted the enantioselective alcohol oxidation and regeneration of the catalyst (See Figs. 13 and 14 ). The Mn(III) salen based macrocyclic complex used as recyclable catalysts for oxidative kinetic resolution (OKR) of secondary alcohols by using diacetoxyiodobenzene (PhI(OAc)2) and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as catalysts in the presence of biphasic dichloromethane: water solvent system. Several secondary alcohols in different steric environments showed good to excellent enantioselectivities by using the aforementioned materials [80] (See Fig. 15 ). N,N-dialkyl imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) bridged chiral dimeric salen Mn(III) complex showed excellent enantioselectivity and catalytic activity in the OKR of α-methyl benzyl alcohol using diacetoxyiodobenzene as an oxidizing agent under the facile reaction condition[81] (See Fig. 16 ). The chiral octahedral coordination cage framework made up by enantiopure Mn(salen)- dicarboxylic acids linker connected to Zn atoms of Zn4-p-tert-butylsulfonylcalix[4] arene clusters with the help of tetravalent four-connected vertices. The porous organic–inorganic hybrid network containing hydrophobic cavity (~3944 Å3) having metallosalen species was efficiently used as the heterogeneous recyclable asymmetric catalyst for the OKR of racemic secondary alcohols with excellent ee (>99%). The cage architecture prevented the intermolecular deactivation and preservation of the Mn(salen) catalysts via concentrating the reactants in the cavity resulting in amplifying the reactivities and enantioselectivities as compared to the free metallosalen catalyst [82] (See Fig. 17 ). Miao et al. [83] have reported sulfuric acid-assisted chemoselective oxidation of secondary alcohols to their respective carbonyl compounds with good yields also showed an efficient oxidative kinetic resolution OKR (>90% ee) of racemic secondary alcohols by using manganese catalysts and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. Mechanistic studies corroborate that electrophilic character was present in active manganese oxidant and the slowest step was abstracting the hydrogen atom from the α-C–H bond of the alcohol substrate via a two-electron process. Molecular modelling studies showed that due to dissimilar energy barriers (i.e. 1.3 kcal mol−1) for abstracting a proton from α-C–H bonds of the R- and S-enantiomers by using high-valent manganese–oxo complex was responsible for the OKR of racemic secondary alcohols (See Fig. 18 ). Bryliakov et al. [84] extensively investigated chiral Mn–aminopyridine complexes catalysed enantiomeric enrichment of 1-arylalkanols with hydrogen peroxide. The observed enantiomeric excess values were an outcome of the stereo-convergent oxidative kinetic resolution of the resulting alcohol. The (S, S)-bipyrrolidine based Mn complexes gave an excellent catalytic performance (krel approaching up to 8.8 and TON > 1000). The mechanistic investigation revealed the electrophilic active species during the alcohol oxidation reaction [rate-limiting H-abstraction (kH/kD = 2.2)], resulting in oxygen rebound and dehydration of the resulting gem-diol to form the ketone. Kinetics of resolution krel clearly demonstrated that the asymmetric auto-amplification (chiral auto-amplification) was affected by the bulkiness of the alcohol, that is, in case of less bulky alcohol krel was increased which enhanced the conversion and optical purity of respective alcohol, whereas more bulky alcohols the krel remained unaffected (See Fig. 19 ). In another report, it was witnessed that replacing the solvent from CH3CN with fluorinated hydrocarbons there was an enhancement in catalytic activity. The solvent effect clearly showed that the 1-phenylethanol formation increased in the following order, CH3CN < 2-fluoroethanol < 2, 2-difluoroethanol < 2, 2, 2-trifuoroethanol. Amongst all, 2, 2-difluoroethanol solvent system has shown high asymmetric induction with the formation of the chiral benzylic alcohols with up to 89% ee. It was also investigated that without using co-catalytic additives the chiral alcohols were obtained up to 95% ee. The specialty of the above said kinetic resolutions was that the selectivity factor (krel) of the resolution was inconsistent because the diastereomeric catalytically active species responded differently to the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the substrate resulting into asymmetric autoamplification. The contribution of asymmetric auto-amplification in the oxidative kinetic resolution of sec-alcohols was substrate-dependent. The addition of acetic acid suppressed or completely switches off the auto amplification [85–87]. All the results for the enatioselective alcohol oxidation are summarised in Table 2 ."
3,Heterogeneous manganese catalyst for alcohol oxidation,"MnOx based materials have attracted the researchers as an excellent heterogeneous catalyst because it is inexpensive, earth-abundant and non-toxic in nature. Moreover, it also represents the diverse crystal structure with specific chemical/physical properties and multiple oxidation states. The manganese oxide crystal containing MnO6 octahedral units sharing the corners and edges to form different tunnel and layered structures. These diverse structures are due to easy inter-conversion of oxidation state between Mn(III) to Mn(IV) and defects in the crystals imparting impressive catalytic properties [88–91]. MnO2 is an excellent cost-effective and non-toxic heterogeneous catalyst widely used as an effective reagent for oxidizing activated alcohols (allylic, propargylic, benzylic etc.) to form their respective unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. In-fact first report for MnO2 as catalyst is utilized for oxidation of vitamin A to retinal [92–96]. Manganese oxides have a very high tendency to incorporate promoters and dopants, therefore manganese oxide with several non-reducible and reducible metal cations such as Sr2+, Mg2+, Ce4+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu+, Ni2+, Pd2+ have been investigated to enhance the oxygen mobility and improve redox functionality for alcohol oxidation reaction [97–107]."
4,Manganese oxide catalysed one pot tandem reactions,"3.1 Manganese oxide catalysed one pot tandem reactions Manganese oxide (MnOx) has been well investigated for the catalytic alcohol oxidation because manganese oxide exists in various oxidation states such as MnO, Mn3O4, Mn2O3, MnO2, etc. [108–110]. The aforementioned Mn-based oxides also reveal divergent crystal structures, morphologies, porosities and textures are responsible for miscellaneous properties and catalytic activity. The aforesaid characteristics of Mn-based oxides are the cornerstones for the cogent design and boosting the catalytic performance of Mn-based oxides. Considerable research focusing on the fine-tuning of the synthetic conditions to get the MnOx with preferable morphologies, defect chemistries (cation distributions and oxidation states) and crystal structures assisting in enhancing the catalytic performance. Manganese oxide occurs in various allotropic forms such as α-, β-, γ-, δ-, ε- and λ-MnO2 depending on the synthetic conditions used to design these structures. Among multifarious crystal structures of Mn-based oxide, the structural frameworks having [MnO6] octahedral sharing vertices and edges assist in the fabrication of one-dimensional [(1D) α-, β- and γ-MnO2] two-dimensional [(2D) δ-MnO2 with planer structure] or three-dimensional [(3D) λ-MnO2] tunnel structures [111,112]. Manganese oxides can exist in various morphologies such as urchin-like, rod-like, flower-like, etc. morphologies depending on their synthetic conditions [113–115]. Structure-activity relationships clearly show that the catalytic activity of various manganese oxide catalysts is primarily depends on the crystalline structure and morphologies. K. Nagashima et al. [116] reported high-valent Mn-based catalyst (Mn/HT-Ox ) which possessed redox properties when combined with alcohol and molecular oxygen, worked as effective heterogeneous catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of various benzylic alcohols. The redox property of the catalyst (Mn/HT-Ox ) during the reaction was confirmed by EXAFS analysis. Manganese plays multiple roles in many biological redox reactions in which it exists in different oxidation states from Mn(II) to Mn(IV). High-valent manganese-oxo intermediate plays an important role in certain enzymes and educates us from the natural system to inspire new developments of artificial systems for various organic conversions. Manganese plays a crucial role in many biological processes and changes redox state during catalysis [117]. The dual function of both Lewis acid and redox properties makes manganese oxides (MnOx) highly efficient catalyst for aerobic oxidation of amines to imines. X. Jia et al reported acetylacetone modified manganese oxide, which is a redox acid cooperative catalyst for the synthesis of both imines and nitriles from primary amines via aerobic oxidation [118]. B. Dutta et al reported cobalt doped mesoporous manganese oxide acts as a heterogeneous catalyst for the amine-alcohol cross-coupling reaction to produce imines. The surface chemistry and physical properties of the material revealed the redox behavior of material and they further supported the reaction mechanism also supported by DFT calculation [119]. T. Kurahashi reported Mn-based catalyst used for oxidation reaction [120]. Manganese silicates which act as a redox catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in a chemical looping ODH scheme, in this two-step process redox catalyst used as an oxygen carrier, provides oxygen from its lattice to transform ethane to ethylene and H2O in a ODH reactor. The Mn:Si = 70:30 redox catalyst was the preferred base redox catalyst due to its high oxygen-carrying capacity and H2 conversion, despite its relatively high COx selectivity [121]. The most plausible mechanism for the oxidation of organic compounds starts by absorption of organic molecules on surface of the catalyst (absorption involves Mars–van Krevelen mechanism). These adsorbed organic molecules are oxidised by surface lattice oxygen. Finally, the gaseous oxygen refills the oxygen vacancies generated during the oxidation process. The catalytic activity of MnOx can further improve by designing strategies promoting the lattice oxygen reactivity. Earlier reports, both experimental, as well as theoretical studies have further confirmed that oxygen vacancies defects (OVDs) play a significant role in enhancing the catalytic performance of MnOx. OVDs are the most probable active site involved in adsorption, activation and finally desorption of the reactant molecules [122] (See Fig. 20 ). Manganese dioxide (MnO2) has been extensively investigated as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective liquid phase and gas phase oxidation reactions by introducing, the one-pot tandem reaction for the synthesis of amides, amines and heterocyclic compounds [122–128]. One-pot alcohol oxidation and the Wittig reaction resulting in the synthesis of α, β- unsaturated esters by MnO2 are well documented [93,129–131]. Detailed MnO2 based alcohol oxidation and tandem reactions until 2005 have been discussed by Taylor and co-workers [93]. In the present review the focus will be on the more recent examples for the tandem oxidation process (TOP) by MnO2 resulting in alcohol valorisation. The one-pot tandem reaction involved oxidation-epoxidation of benzylic alcohols to epoxides catalysed by MnO2 or BaMnO4 using 1, 5, 7-Triazabicyclo [4.4.0] dec-1-ene (TBD) and 7-methyl-1, 5, 7-triazabicyclo [4.4.0] dec-1-ene (MTBD) as promoters. The reaction proceeded by conversion of sulfonium salts to sulfonium resulting in the excellent yield of corresponding epoxides (54–99% yield for the trans isomer) under the ambient reaction condition [132,133] (See Fig. 21 ). MnO2 catalysed two-step tandem catalytic process involving alcohol oxidation followed by the C1-homologation of dibromoalkenes and terminal alkynes by Bestmann-Ohira reagent. A variety of aliphatic, benzylic and heterocyclic alcohols transformed into their C1-homologs with average to excellent yield (14–86%) [134]. There are some other reports for similar C1- homologation of alcohols to alkyne using manganese dioxide and Bestmann–Ohira reagent with good to excellent yield (59–99% yield) under mild reaction conditions using MTDB as a base. The C1-homologation with a broad substrate scope involving benzylic, heterocyclic and propargylic alcohols (See Fig. 22 ) [93,131–135]. Lotus shaped γ-MnO2 synthesized by calcination of hierarchical lotus-shaped MnCO3 [prepared by precipitating manganese acetate tetrahydrate with (NH4)2CO3 as the effective redox catalyst for the coupling of o-nitro-phenol with benzyl alcohols resulting in the synthesis of 2-arylbenzoxazoles. Mn+3 along with surface O− & O2 − species played a significant role in the redox catalysis. A broad substrate range of alcohols resulting to 2-arylbenzoxazoles with good to excellent yield (56–97%) has been explored (See Fig. 23 ) [136]. Antiviral nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds 1, 2-disubstituted benzimidazoles prepared in the one-pot cascade process by using α-MnO2 as catalyst. 1, 2-diol or alcohols used as raw material for tandem reactions involving oxidation/cyclization/alkylation to the desired benzimidazole with satisfactory yields (91% yield). The mechanistic studies observed that surface oxygen atoms predominantly affected the catalytic performance and the loss of Na/K ions present in the catalyst tunnels. (See Fig. 24 ) [137]. The carboxylate modified MnO2 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyaldehyde ammoxidation to obtain hydroxynitrile (>92%). Due to variation of hydroxyl adsorption affinity of the aforementioned catalyst the carboxylate modifier affected dinitrile and hydroxynitrile. The carboxylic acid tail did not affect the product selectivity (See Fig. 25 and Table 3 ) [138]. α-, β- and γ -types MnO2 catalysed the synthesis of imines from the primary alcohols and primary amines. Amongst all, γ-MnO2 showed excellent catalytic stability and reusability with 98% yield for imines under aerobic conditions. The high catalytic performance of γ-MnO2 was due to the high concentration of low-valence manganese ions [139]. MnO2 was efficiently used for the ammoxidation of alcohols to nitriles with excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for nitriles. The gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) doped MnO2 showed excellent catalytic activity for hydration of the ammoxidation product of benzyl alcohol to produce benzamide with excellent selectivity supporting the gold nanoparticles were majorly responsible for hydration of the nitriles (See Table 3) [140]. One-pot ammoxidation–Pinner tandem reaction involving aerobic oxidation followed by condensation of aldehyde, ammonia and methanol using bifunctional sodium doped manganese oxide catalyst. NaOH/Mn predominantly assists α-MnO2/Na x MnO2 formation. The basic Na x MnO2 phase was due to sodium cation, and the redox-active α-MnO2 phase was due to potassium cation resulting in α-MnO2/Na x MnO2 interface structure assisting in imidate synthesis (yields 58–96%). The MnIV/MnIII redox cycle facilitated ammoxidation and the lattice oxygen present in the α-MnO2 donated active oxygen species. The Pinner synthesis involved methanol activation to generate methoxy species promoted by basic NaxMnO2 sites (See Fig. 26 and Table 3) [141]. Zhang et al. [142] have used α-MnO2 as a robust, reusable and highly efficient and selective catalyst for the quinazolinones synthesis by oxidative cyclization of anthranilamides with alcohols using TBHP as an oxidant with broad substrate scope under additive free conditions (See Fig. 27 ). In another example the alkali metal-doped (meso Cs/MnOx) mesoporous manganese oxide nanoparticles has been introduced as the for tandem oxidative transformations into imine, imidazole, cyanide, amide, lactone, ester and olefin from alcohol as the sole product. The catalyst showed excellent reusability and excellent selectivity for the desired product of each reaction with a broad substrate scope of each reaction (See Table 4 and Fig. 28 ). Multiple esterification reactions from the same aliphatic alcohol under aerobic atmospheric conditions was also observed by (Cs/MnOx) catalyst [143]. In another case, a series of alkali and alkaline earth metal-doped (Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Na+ and Cs+) manganese oxide crystal UCT-1 (University of Connecticut mesoporous material, UCT-1) have also been designed using the inverse micelles template technique. These UCT-1 based materials with tuneable porosity and crystallinity was used for selective aerobic oxidation of alcohol. The catalytic activity for alcohol oxidation increased by promoting ion-induced basicity (Mg < Ca < K < Na < Cs). Other factors responsible for enhanced catalytic activity were the retention of an amorphous structure, low reducibility and the effects of lattice oxygen. The UCT-18-Cs catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity with broad substrate scope for complete conversion of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones [144]. Controlled synthesis of Mn2O3/Mn3O4 resulting in the sponge-like material (large mesopores–macropores 25.5 nm, pore diameter) with unique morphological and surface properties formed by altering the heating rates and isothermal segments. The Mn2O3/Mn3O4 and 5 mol % Mn2O3/Mn3O4 sponges catalysed long-chain aliphatic alcohols (43–58% conversion) to their corresponding esters (<30% yields) (See Fig. 29 ) [145]."
5,Supported manganese oxide catalyst for alcohol valorisation,"3.2 Supported manganese oxide catalyst for alcohol valorisation MnOx supported on silica (Mn-SBA-15), MCM-41 (Mn-MCM-41), γ- alumina have been effectively used for alcohol oxidation with excellent yields. Gas-phase benzyl alcohol oxidation using 2% Mn–ZSM-5 zeolite synthesised by a one-step hydrothermal method using manganese salt and organic template [146–150]. MIL-101 encapsulated and uniformly distributed ultrafine Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with Mn3O4 content ranging between 3.2% and 33% exhibited excellent conversion with 99% selectivity to benzaldehyde. The aforementioned catalytic materials were heterogeneous and recyclable, but at high Mn3O4 loadings, there was a decline in catalytic performance due to aggregation of Mn3O4 particles outside the MIL-101 matrix [151]. MnO2 nanowires anchored on amine-functionalized graphite nanosheet composite (AFGNS) (MnO2@AFGNS) composite based heterogeneous catalyst efficiently catalysed the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to their respective carbonyl compounds under the aerobic condition with low catalyst loading. The synergistic interaction between 1-D MnO2 nanowires and AFGNS promoted e− transfer and catalytic activity of the aforesaid reaction [152]. The natural hydroxyapatite‐supported MnO2 (MnO2@NHAp) synthesized by potassium permanganate with natural hydroxyapatite by an efficient heterogeneous recyclable catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of alkylarenes and alcohols [153]. The Porous chitosan–manganese dioxide (PC–MnO2) nano-hybrid material has been synthesized by in-situ reduction of the KMnO4 solution with chitosan as the precursor and reducing agent. Heterogeneous and recyclable MnO2 incorporated into the porous chitosan matrix show excellent catalytic activity for the selective aerobic oxidation of alkylarenes and alcohols without a base [154]. γ-MnO2 (62.5 wt% loadings)/graphene oxide (GO) prepared by a simple wet precipitation method act as an efficiently alcohol oxidation. MnSO4 was used as the manganese precursor for γ-MnO2. The γ-MnO2/GO catalyst shows good activity for the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohols (91% yield over 3 h) to the corresponding carbonyl compounds under mild conditions [155]. Highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) nanocomposites of manganese carbonate doped with (1%) zirconia (ZrO x ) nanoparticles [ZrO x (1%)–MnCO3/(X%) HRG (where X = 0–7) was synthesized by facile co-precipitation method which was calcining at 300 °C utilized for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols with 100% benzyl alcohol conversion and 99% product selectivity in 4 min. This aforementioned catalyst presented a broad substrate scope for primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds [156]. Mn-MOF honeycomb-like channel was prepared by reacting 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl) butane-1,3-dione with Mn(OAc)2 in a solution. The above said Mn-MOF further doped with Pd–Au bimetallic alloy nanoparticles forming Pd–Au@Mn(II)-MOF acted as a bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst for the one-pot tandem synthesis of imines from alcohols and primary amines [157]. Manganese oxide with Mn loadings (<10 wt%) supported on alumina catalysed benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde as the main product with >99% selectivity. This Mn-based catalyst was reused for six cycles retaining its catalytic activity and selectivity [158]. Tang et al. used Mn–Ni mixed hydroxide synthesized via co-precipitation method was used for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol where Mn/Ni molar ratio of 6:4 showed the best catalytic activity with >99% selectivity for benzaldehyde [103]. The series of barium doped MnOx/CeO2-δ catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method which catalysed benzyl alcohol using TBHP as an oxidizing agent under solvent-free conditions [159]. Highly dispersed manganese oxide crystals supported on graphene oxide (MnO2/GO) have been efficiently used as the heterogeneous and recyclable catalyst for the following reaction (i) oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde [160], (ii) synthesis of primary amides (from primary alcohols and ammonia or aldehydes or nitriles) and (iii) coupling reaction of alcohols and amines to imines. All the reactions were performed under aerobic condition (See Fig. 30 and Table 5 ) [161,162]."
6,Manganese octahedral molecular sieves catalysed alcohol oxidation to added valuable chemicals,"3.3 Manganese octahedral molecular sieves catalysed alcohol oxidation to added valuable chemicals Octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) or the synthetic cryptomelane materials containing a framework of a mixed-valence and tunnel structure also widely exploited for the organic transformations with the chemical structure of KMn7 4+Mn3+O16·nH2O possessing 22 tunnel architecture where MnO6 occupying the edges and corners and K+ and H2O moieties occupying the tunnel. The manganese atoms had an average oxidation state of 3.8 because most of the manganese atoms had Mn4+ oxidation state a few manganese atom had Mn3+ oxidation states [13,121,125,163]. The particle size, unit cell system and morphology of the aforementioned OMS-2 system modified by incorporating alkali, alkaline or transition metal ions into their mixed-valence framework. The resulting OMS-2 nanoparticles with improved physico-chemical characteristics generated as compared to macro-scale equivalents. These nanosized OMS-2 have the high surface area to volume ratio providing more active sites for gas sensing, energy storage, batteries and catalysis [164–169]. Due to many-fold applications of these catalytic materials sincere efforts to mould their crystal system, particle size, and morphology to design new materials by varying the reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, time, solvents, reducing agent, co-solvents, hydrothermal conditions, pH etc.) [114,170–177]. Doping the OMS-2 with metal ions into the tunnels as well as the mixed-valent framework to alter their properties have been thoroughly investigated. Acid sites were generated by exchanging K+ ions in the K-OMS-2 tunnels with H+ ions [178]. Doping OMS-2 with several low and high-valent ions in the framework with Co2+, Zr2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Pd2+, V5+, W6+, and Mo6+ [179–185] produces cryptomelane with novel morphologies and enhanced catalytic performance [27]. OMS-2 has been used in the oxidation of alcohols, hydrocarbons [178,15], epoxidation of alkenes [17,18], synthesis of imines from alcohols [19–21,22,24] and the synthesis of amides from alcohols [26]. Herein, the present section of the review, we focus on modern trends and latest developments in alcohol oxidation using OMS. 3.3.1 Alcohol oxidation reactions by OMS-2 Alcohol oxidation has been extensively investigated using manganese-based un-doped and doped (OMS-2). K-OMS-2 with different morphologies were prepared by reflux method via syn-proportionation of KMnO4 and Mn2+ salts in acidic aqueous suspension or by oxidation of MnSO4 under aerobic conditions with K2Cr2O7 [186]. Manganese oxides (OMS-2) and metal-doped M-OMS-2 (M = Fe, Ni) were prepared by reflux method, solid-state mixing and hydrothermal methods for selective oxidation of 2-propanol (50% conversion) to acetone (100% selectivity) [187]. The sonochemical method has also been used for the synthesis of the very high surface area and small particle size (K-OMS-2SC) catalyst. A large number of defects present on the sonochemically synthesized materials were responsible for superior catalytic activity and performance for oxidation of benzyl alcohol as compared to OMS-2 and MnO2 [167]. Silica supported silver-modified OMS-2 (Ag/OMS-2 and Ag/OMS-2/SiO2) catalyst were prepared by impregnation, co-precipitation, and consecutive impregnation methods which catalysed the selective oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. However, the total oxidation on the Ag-MnOx occurred at high temperatures deteriorating the catalytic activity [188]. Manganese octahedral molecular sieve (Ag–OMS-2) (optimum performance with 10% w/w Ag–OMS-2) was effectively used for the gas phase oxidation (1-octanol (W/FA0)- 20 g h/mol, (WHSV)- 16.74 h−1,523 K) of 1-octanol to 1-octanal with toluene as solvent [189]. OMS-2 (cryptomelene) and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 and their modifications with ionic liquids [Bmim][NTf2] or [Bmpyr][NTf2] catalysed benzyl alcohol oxidation with promising yields for the corresponding aldehyde. Platinum on the OMS-2 surface was responsible for transforming the support to Mn3O4 during benzyl alcohol oxidation and the ionic liquid component assisted phase stability. The effect of diluent inert gases such as N2, He, Ar or CO2 as reactive gases and the nature of the ionic liquid was also studied for benzyl alcohol oxidation [190]. Manganese oxides (OMS-2) designed by hydrothermal reactions of KMnO4 and MnSO4 solutions with H2SO4, and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as additives catalysed the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. OMS-2 and pyrolusite (OMS-7) synthesised by varying MnSO4 and KMnO4/MnSO4 ratio. Catalytic oxidation efficiency was in the order H-K-OMS-2 > K-OMS-2 > OMS-7 due to the larger amount of acid sites in H-K-OMS-2[120]. Several other reducing and non-reducing metal ions doped OMS-2 based catalysts were also employed for alcohol oxidation reactions [182,191,192] (See Table 6 ). 3.3.2 One-pot tandem reactions catalysed by OMS-2 involving alcohol oxidation OMS-2 has also been effectively used for the one-pot tandem reactions involving alcohol oxidation. Heterogeneous, recyclable manganese oxide-based OMS-2 was effectively used for synthesis of α, β-unsaturated esters with high diastereoselectivity of a broad range of substituted and un-substituted benzylic, allylic and aliphatic alcohols via one-pot alcohol oxidation-Wittig reaction (See Fig. 31 ) [125]. Heterogeneous recyclable octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) effectively catalysed one-pot tandem cascade reactions involving direct aerobic oxidative amidation of alcohols with ammonia [193]. Furthermore, the application for benzyl alcohol oxidation for cascade reaction initiated by alcohol oxidation, followed by reaction with malononitrile to form 2-benzylidene-malononitrile. Reaction with acetophenone to form (E)-chalcone, where a three-step process leads to the synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-1,5-benzothiazepine. In all the cases catalytic materials were heterogeneous and recyclable (See Fig. 32 ) [124]. Cu(OH)X/OMS-2 octahedral molecular sieves developed by Wang et al. [194] was used as an efficient, highly reusable catalyst for the aerobic oxidative cyclization of the benzyl alcohols with anthranilamides to quinazolinones with an excellent yield of up to 85% (See Fig. 33 ). Zhao et al. [195] have reported additive and ligand-free highly efficient esterification of α-hydroxy ketone with alcohols affording α-keto esters by using the hydrotalcite-supported bimetallic catalyst (CuMn/HT) via a tandem oxidation process. Due to increase in oxygen vacancies and a newly generated CuMn2O4 crystal phase was responsible for the superior catalytic performance of CuMn/HT (See Fig. 34 ). An efficient method for quinazolines synthesis via tandem one-pot method involving alcohol oxidation followed by reaction with amidines under ligand-free conditions by using manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) as a catalyst. The catalytic material was efficient, recyclable and applicable for a broad range of substrates with good to excellent yield (See Fig. 35 ) [196]. Hierarchically MnCo2O4 nanorods having multi-nanopores was synthesized by co-precipitation method using oxalic acid as a precipitant followed by thermal degradation is found to be highly active for N-benzylideneaniline formation with very high selectivity from benzyl alcohol and aniline under mild reaction condition. Mn2+/Mn3+ (1.36:1) and Co2+/Co3+ (1.35:1) have shown excellent synergistic effects accountable for the excellent catalytic reaction. The aforementioned MnCo2O4 nanorods showed 91% conversion of benzyl alcohol with high selectivity (95%) for N-benzylideneaniline under eco-friendly reaction condition (See Fig. 36 ) [197]."
7,Oxidation of biomass-derived HMF using manganese oxide-based catalyst,"3.4 Oxidation of biomass-derived HMF using manganese oxide-based catalyst More recently contemporary researchers’ have focused on valorization of bio-based alcohol 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). The present section focused on the latest development in the design of manganese and supported manganese oxide as heterogeneous catalyst for selective oxidation of biomass-based alcohols to value added chemicals. The HMF is a very important compound containing aldehyde, alcohol and a furan ring. Selective oxidation of HMF leads to commercially valuable product 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) finds applications in pharmaceuticals [198,199], fungicides [200] and furan-urea resins [201]. On the other hand, the heterocyclic ligands such as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) has been used for the synthesis of furanic polyesters [202]. The 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) finds applications in the synthesis of the monomeric building block of bio-based polymers such as polyamides, polyesters and polyurethanes [203]. The present section of this review focuses on manganese oxide-based catalyst for the valorisation of HMF (See Fig. 37 ) [204,205]. 3.4.1 Selective oxidation of HMF to 2,5-difurandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) Manganese oxide, OMS-2 and manganese oxide-based mixed metal oxide catalyse HMF to FDCA conversion. Hayashi et al. [206] investigated MnO2 and NaHCO3 based system which oxidize HMF to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA). The molecular modeling investigations revealed that β- and λ-MnO2 contains planar and bent oxygen sites, respectively, had a lower vacancy formation energy as compared to α- and γ-MnO2, therefore β- and λ-MnO2 were found to be more favourable candidates for alcohol oxidation [206]. The experimental and H2-TPR studies further corroborated the quantum mechanical calculations. The high-surface-area of β-MnO2 was effectively used for enhancing the catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA [207]. The non-precious mixed metal (MnxFey = Mn/Fe = 3/1) oxide catalyst oxidize HMF to FDCA where Mn(III) and Mn(IV) co-existed with a hematite phase. The synergistic cooperation allowed the efficient oxidation of FFCA to FDCA [208]. Manganese oxide-based octahedral molecular sieves (KMn8O16; OMS-2) catalyze dimethyl furan-2, 5-dicarboximidate synthesis from hydroxyl methylfurfural (HMF) aqueous ammonia. The multistep cascade process initiated by ammoxidation of HMF and methanol addition, under the moderate reaction conditions. The in-situ generated imidate was further converted into 2, 5-furandiamidine dihydrochloride on reaction with ammonium chloride [209]. Several manganese oxide-based mixed metal oxide systems such as MnO x –CeO2 [210], hexagonal spinel MnCo2O4 [211], Ru/Mn X Ce1O γ [212], Mn x Fe y O z (Mn/Fe = 3/1) [208,213], Co/Mn-lignin coordination complexes (Fe, Co, Ni)-doped MnOx [214] and Li2CoMn3O8 [215] catalyze selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA (See Table 7 ). 3.4.2 Selective oxidation of HMF to 2, 5-diformyfuran (DFF) Self-assembled dense hollow spherical OMS-2 nanoparticles synthesized by room temperature atomization catalyze the oxidation of HMF to 2, 5-diformyfuran (DFF) [216]. Furthermore, Cs/MnO x synthesized by the soft template method unveil improved catalytic activity as compared to un-doped MnO x , suggesting that the incorporation of Cs into MnO x plays a crucial role in oxidizing HMF to DFF [217]. In an another example, Mn-Co binary mixed metal oxide system catalyzes HMF oxidation to DFF [218–221]. The selective oxidation of HMF by MnOx/P25 (titania) catalyst to 2,5-diformyfuran (DFF) (>90% selectivity) via in-situ wet impregnation of Mn(NO3)2 [222]. The magnetically separable heterogeneous catalyst (Fe3O4/Mn3O4) synthesized by the solvothermal method catalyze biomass-derived model substrate 5-hydroxymethyl furfural oxidation to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) under facile conditions with an excellent yield [223]. In case of Cu doped-MnO2 materials, synthesized by precipitation method and employed as heterogeneous recyclable catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to 2, 5-diformylfuran (DFF) with 96.1% selectivity. The doping of Cu ion into the MnO2 is useful for the exchange of Mn4+ and M3+ or to move the lattice oxygen [224]. The CoMn2O4 and Ru/MnCo2O4 has also been efficiently catalyzed HMF oxidation to form DFF with an excellent yield [225,226]. Further, the precious metals (Au and Pd) doped MnO2 has also been explored for the HMF oxidation to DFF [227,228] (See Table 6). Manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) with a tunnel size 2 × 2 Å and 4.6 × 4.6 Å effectively and selectively catalyzed aerobic oxidation of HMF to 2, 5-diformylfuran (DFF) with an excellent yields (97.2%). The mechanistic studies confirm that lattice oxygen atom assist oxidation of Mn4+ and reduction of HMF, followed by catalyst recovery step involving replenishment of oxygen vacancy O2 and regenerating the Mn4+ [229]. In presence of molecular oxygen as oxidant, heterogeneous recyclable catalyst Ag-OMS-2 (octahedral molecular sieve) showed excellent catalytic activity and recyclability for HMF (99%) to DFF with 99% conversion and 100% selectivity [230]. The N-MnO2 catalyst successfully converted HMF to DFF with 100% conversion and >99.9% selectivity at ambient conditions. The EXAFS analysis confirm that nitrogen doping was responsible for both elongation of the Mn–O bond and a lowering of the coordination number of the Mn–O, reulting in the more surface defect sites as well as coordinatively unsaturated Mn sites which in turns leads to the enhancement of the catalytic performance (See Table 8 ). The N-MnO2 for oxidizing HMF to DFF showed highly efficient due to more surface defect sites as well as coordinatively unsaturated Mn sites [231]. 3.4.3 Selective oxidation of HMF to other valuable products The base‐metal CoO x ‐N/C and α‐MnO2 catalyze additive-free oxidative esterification to furan‐2,5‐dimethylcarboxylate (FDMC, 95.6% yield). α‐MnO2 catalyzes HMF to DFF oxidation and subsequently CoO x ‐N/C catalyze DFF to FDMC conversion [232]. OMS-2 efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of HMF to furan-2,5-dicarboximidate. HMF oxidation involves the following pathway (i) hydroxymethyl group oxidation, (ii) aldimine formation by condensation of aldehyde with ammonia, (iii) oxidation of aldimine to nitrile. Finally, ammonium chloride expediently reacts with nitriles to form 2,5-furandiamidine dihydrochloride (See Fig. 38 ) [209]. OMS-2 doped metal cations (In3+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+) catalyzed aerobic ammoxidation-hydration tandem reaction of HMF to form 2,5-furandicarboxamide (>99% conversion and 97% selectivity). Al-doped K-OMS-2 gave an improved catalytic performance as compared to K-OMS-2. In this reaction, 0.15[Al]-K-OMS have high-efficiency due to lattice oxygen reactivity and the strength of strong acid sites (See Fig. 39 ) [233]."
8,Oxidant-free oxidation of alcohol to valuable products,"Traditional alcohol oxidation methods are becoming less significance concerning the recent advancement in synthetic organic chemistry due to stoichiometric quantities of inorganic oxidants [25,234,235]. Furthermore, these oxidation reactions required various additives, co-catalysts and bounteous toxic stoichiometric oxidants. The transfer hydrogenation can also be considered as the alternative avoiding generation of waste, but the sacrificial organic molecules used for these transformations in stoichiometric amounts generating copious amount of organic waste [236]. Recently, acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD) method has emerged as an alternative technique for efficient, green and sustainable emerging technology for oxidant-free alcohol oxidation reaction with or without elimination of small hydrogen molecules as only by-products [237]. In certain cases of AD reactions in-situ generated hydrogen equivalents is further used up reaction steps [238,239]. Thus, AD strictly follows the 12 principles of “green chemistry” as reactions afford complete use of reactants into the products aborting generation of waste products [240]. Currently, due to multifaceted applications, successful oxidation of alcohols to valuable chemicals via acceptor less dehydrogenation reaction is highly desired [4,241,242]. The alcohol oxidation/activation via acceptorless dehydrogenation finds applications in valorization of alcohols to ketones [243], carboxylic acids, esters [244], acetals [245], imines [246], secondary amines [247], olefins, heterocyclic compounds [32,248-250] and lactones [251]."
9,Alcohol oxidation/ activation by manganese complexes,"4.1 Alcohol oxidation/ activation by manganese complexes Recently, the transition metal organometallic complexes have opened the new gateway for clean chemical synthesis via the acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD) of alcohols to valuable products [5,236,241,252–254]. As discussed in the earlier sections among all the transition metal manganese-based complexes are more potential candidate due to inexpensive, readily available and environmentally benign fulfilling most of the criteria of the principles of green chemistry. In AD catalysis, not only the metal center but the ligand also cooperatively participates in the alcohol dehydrogenation. “Pincer ligands” have been primarily investigated for the alcohol dehydrogenation reaction. “Pincer lignads” were primarily reported by Shaw [255], defined by Koten and Albrecht [256] with central σ-donating phenyl moiety with two ortho-position functionalized by amino- or phosphino-methyl CH2ER2(E = N, P) ligands. The transition metal-based pincer complex exhibited high thermal stability and excellent catalytic activity due to the chelating and the rigid binding mode with the transition metal complexes making them versatile materials in catalysis (See Fig. 40 ) [257–264]. Alcohol dehydrogenation has been extensively investigated, especially by Milstein et al. for the synthesis of value-added chemicals such as esters [265], amides [266], aldimines [267], carboxylic acids, olefins [268] alkylation reactions (alkylation of alcohols, amines, nitriles, ketones, amides, esters and sulfones) [63,269–273], heterocyclic compounds [274,275] and hydrogen production [276] by employing the transition metal-based pincer complexes. 4.1.1 Alcohol valorisation to esters, amides, imines and amines Nguyen and co-workers [265] have reported primary alcohols cross-dehydrogenative coupling to form esters with a broad substrate scope showed an excellent yield (74–93%) by using PNP pincer supported manganese (1) dicarbonyl complex as a catalyst with base-free condition. This reaction proceed under neat condition with moderate catalyst loading and liberated H2 gas as a byproduct. Mechanistic studies showed that the dehydrogenation results from cycling between amido and amino hydrides of catalyst (See Fig. 41 ). Das et al. [277] have reported primary alcohols cross-dehydrogenative coupling to form cross esters as the major product with an excellent yield (up to 93%) by using manganese pincer complex and base as co-catalyst. This oxidant free cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction of alcohols only liberated H2 gas as a byproduct. The mechanistic studies showed that a de-aromatized complex generated via proton abstraction by base played a significant role in activating the catalyst during the reaction. Also, the de-aromatized complex synthesized independently clearly showed that the catalytic cross de-hydrogenative coupling under the base-free conditions (See Fig. 42 ). Kumar et al. [266] have reported base free dehydrogenative coupling reactions of the alcohols and amines by manganese PN2-pincer complex as the catalyst for the synthesis of the amides from aliphatic alcohols with an excellent yields. The proposed mechanism for the coupling of alcohols with amines was similar to the oxidative esterification reaction. The cyclic imides were synthesized from diols and lactones in good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) using manganese pincer complexes (See Fig. 43 ) [278]. 4.1.2 Alkyation of amines, amides, alcohols, esters and nitriles Sravankumar et al. [279] have reported both inter and intra molecular N-alkylation of amines with alcohol or methanol to form a secondary amine or indoles in an excellent yields using manganese-PNP pincer complex (See Fig. 44 ). The N-substituted hydrazones synthesized by coupling of alcohols with hydrazine via partial hydrogencatalysed by manganese pincer (PN2) complex (Mn(tBu-PNN)(CO)2Br) under the base-free facile reaction conditions. The mechanistic investigations clearly showed tandem cascade reactions involved both acceptorless dehydrogenation and ‘hydrogen borrowing’ reaction system (See Figs. 45 and 46 ) [280] (Fig. 46). Bipyridine-based PN3-pincer manganese complex (bpy-6NH-iPrP) highly efficient for N-alkylation of a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic amines with primary as well as secondary alcohols showed good to excellent yields. Moreover, the aforementioned catalytic system was even successful with more challenging nucleophilic aliphatic amines and challenging secondary alcohols were employed as substrates (See Fig. 47 ) [281]. Intrestingly, the (iPr-PNP)Mn(H)(CO)2 pincer complex catalyzes α-alkylation of ketones, amides secondary alcohols and esters using alcohol under mild conditions generating water and H2 as by-products (See Fig. 48 ) [270]. Sortais et al. [282] have recently reported the α-methylation of ketones and esters with methanol in presence of manganese PN3P complex as a pre-catalyst and NaO t Bu (50 mol%) as the base. Miguel et al. [283] have used manganese PNP complexes for alkylation of valuable ketones with easily available alcohols to form α-alkylated ketones [283]. Jang et al. [273] have reported manganese-PNP pincer complex for C-alkylation of the carboxylic acid derivative with renewable alcohol to valorised esters and amides using aliphatic, benzylic, and heterocyclic-containing alcohols as alkylating reagents (See Fig. 49 ). Balaraman et al [284] performed C-alkylation of unactivated amides and tert-butyl acetate by using alcohols as alkylating agents via hydrogen auto-transfer mechanism. The aforementioned effective method showed a broad substrate scope for alcohols bearing alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl provided the C–C coupled products of amides and esters with extended backbone by hydrogen auto-transfer reaction strategy (See Fig. 50 ). Manganese-PN2 ligand-based [285] catalyst containing a pyridyl-supported pyrazolyl-imidazolyl ligand have been efficiently used for the conversion of renewable alcohol via C-alkylation through double hydrogen auto-transfer leading to a sustainable process for the benign synthesis of valorised alcohols. The coupling of primary with secondary alcohols was efficiently converted to β-alkylated secondary alcohols (See Fig. 51 ). Guerbet-type condensation reaction resulting in the up-gradation of biomass to synthesize n-butanol from ethanol using manganese pincer complex as a catalyst with high TON and excellent yield [286,287].(See Fig. 52 ) Liu et al. [288] have developed an efficient method for the up-gradation of methanol and ethanol to biofuel such as iso-butanol using a well‐defined pincer PNP with Mn as a catalyst resulting high turnover number (TON = 9233 and TOF = 833 h−1) and 96% selectivity for iso-butanol. The Iso-butanol is a critical component of gasoline additive due to excellent compatibility with contemporary engine technology responsible for high energy density as well as high-octane number. This is the first example of deoxygenative coupling of lower alcohols to isobutanol by using a homogeneous non-noble-metal catalyst. The non-precious pincer ligand-based manganese complexes catalyze chemoselective alkylation of easily available nitriles with the naturally abundant alcohols with broad substrate scope tolerating a wide variety of functional groups and heterocyclic moieties. Interestingly, cyanoalkylated products were obtained with excellent yields generating water as the only by-product. The mechanistic studies reveal that the pathway for the alkylation was similar to the conventional alkyation of alcohols, ketones and amides involving the pathways initiated by the following steps: (i) dehydrogenative activation of the alcohol, (ii) second step involving α-C–H activation of the nitrile and (iii) finally hydrogenation of the in-situ-generated unsaturated intermediate [289] (See Fig. 53 ). N-formyl-amines synthesized by acceptorless dehydrogenative couplings of methanol and amines catalysed by manganese PNP complex (iPr-PNHP)Mn(H)(CO)2 with an excellent yield. The proposed mechanism involves O–H bond activation of methanol by metal–ligand cooperation [290] (See Fig. 54 ). Recently reported [267,291] cross-dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with amines to form aldimine via environmentally benign method using Mn-pincer complex. (See Fig. 55 ). Fertig et al. [292] have recently reported the base switchable synthesis of N-alkylated amines or imines from alcohols followed by condensation with amines by using Mn-PN3P precatalyst. Interestingly, amine formation with the potassium base shows 40 times more catalytic activity than sodium base favouring imine formation with an excellent catalytic activity for a broad range of substrates with a good functional group tolerance (See Fig. 56 ). Recently, Samuelsen and co-workers [293] designed various manganese (III) salen based homogeneous catalyst for efficient acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols followed by condensation with amines to imines as major products and hydrogen gas as a by-product. The reaction had a broad substrate scope in which Ca3N2 was used as a base for dehydrogenation reaction. The manganese salen complex was recoverable after completion of reaction without significant loss of catalytic activity (See Fig. 57 ). Recently, Chakroborty et al. [31] demonstrated the cross dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with nitriles to form acrylonitrile in the presence of (iPrPNHP)Mn(H)(CO)2 complex. DFT calculations corroborate that the metal–ligand cooperative interactions involve a multistep catalytic cycle. Water and alcohol also played a significant role in proton transfer via stabilizing the intermediates. Mechanistic studies show that the rate-determining step was the Knoevenagel condensation step between in-situ generated aldehyde and aryl acetonitrile. In another report, the same group of workers have reported the synthesis of additive-free N-formyl-amines by coupling of methanol with amines using the aforementioned manganese complex [294]. A plausible mechanism for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols by (iPrPNHP)Mn(H)(CO)2 complex followed by condensation with amines. (See Fig. 58 ). 4.1.3 Homo- and cross-coupling of alcohols to olefins The manganese-PNP complex catalysed dual-deoxygenative coupling of 2-arylethanols with primary alcohols. Both homo coupling and cross-coupling among two benzylic alcohols or between the benzylic and aryl alcohols occur smoothly demonstrating a broad substrate scope with outstanding functional group tolerance. The multistep cascade reaction includes catalytic dehydrogenation, aldol condensation and finally de-formylation by the base to alkene as the desired product (See Fig. 59 ) [295]. Waiba et al. [296] have synthesized a series of manganese pincer complex for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alkyl sulfones with alcohols to form vinyl sulfone in moderate to good yield. The aforesaid catalytic materials showed excellent catalytic activity for benzylic and aliphatic alcohols without affecting –Br and –I bond under the given reaction conditions (See Fig. 60 ). The Mn(I) PNP pincer pre-catalyst with a base (K2CO3) catalysed the synthesis of the N-alkylation of sulphonamides via borrowing hydrogen approach involving the coupling of benzylic or simple primary aliphatic alcohols with alkyl sulphonamides to mono-N-alkylation of sulfonamides with an excellent isolated yield (>85% average yield) [297] (See Fig. 61 ). Zang et al. [268] developed an efficient PN5P type manganese pincer complex assisted by a base (KOH) for α-olefination via alkylated N-heteroarenes with alcohols (See Fig. 63 ). The reaction showed a broad substrate scope and produced hydrogen as a sole byproduct. Bromo-, iodo- olefin substituted N-heteroarenes under the given reaction conditions were tolerated. Benzylic and aliphatic alcohols were effectively used for alkylation reactions. Conventional olefination reactions such as Wittig [298], Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons [299], Peterson [300], Julia [301] and Mc-Murry [302] need expensive pre-functionalization and toxic reagents. Das et al. [303] used manganese pincer catalyst (iPr-PNHP)Mn(H)(CO)2 for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with hydrazine to form E-alkenes. The most probable mechanism for acceprtorless dehydrogenation involves N–H activation by amido-amine metal–ligand cooperation (See Fig. 62). Barman et al. [304], recently have reported a benign and efficient method for the synthesis of (E)-disubstituted methyl heteroarenes from alcohol and methyl heteroarene in moderate to high yield with a broad substrate scope using manganese N3-pincer complex. The reaction proceeded by alcohol dehydrogenation and coupling with methyl heteroarenes produced water and hydrogen as the only byproducts (See Fig. 64 ). Manganese based pincer complex catalysed AD reaction involving the coupling of the primary alcohols with ketones for the synthesis of α-alkenyl ketones. This catalyst tolerated a range of primary, benzylic and heteroaryl alcohols. The proposed mechanisms for the acceproless dehydrogenative coupling involves the following route: (i) dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehyde intermediate and (ii) coupling of the dehydrogenated alcohols to ketones involving dearomatization-aromatization metal-ligand cooperation. The minimal catalyst loading along with the mild base Cs2CO3 gave satisfactory yield for α-alkenyl ketones (See Fig. 65 ) [305]. 4.1.4 Oxidative dehydrogenation to form carboxylic acids Shao et al. [306] have reported manganese pincer complex as highly efficient catalyst for the oxidant-free direct alcohol oxidation to carboxylic acid via acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols in alkaline medium with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (see Fig. 66 ). Thus, this manganese pincer complexes have been readily used for the acceptorless dehydrogenative oxidation of (bio-sourced) alcohols to carboxylic acid salts as a base (See Fig. 67 )[307]. 4.1.5 Heterocycle synthesis via aceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols to valuable chemicals Tandem one-pot acceptorless dehydrogenation and hetero-condensation by hydrogen auto-transfer method for the synthesis of pyrroles from readily available ketones, 1, 2-diols and primary amines catalysed by stable manganese PNP-pincer complex. The mechanistic studies by performing the DFT calculations show that acceptorless dehydrogenation hydrogen auto-transfer reaction mechanism involves in the productive synthesis of pyrroles (See Figs. 68 and 69 ) [308]. Kallmeier et al. [309] have used similar PN5P type manganese pincer complex for the synthesis of pyrroles from secondary alcohols and amino-alcohols with an excellent catalytic activity. 2, 5- unsubstituted pyrrols from biomass-based primary diols and amines using PN5P based manganese complexes under solvent-free condition and liberating H2 as the only by-product. Interestingly, no side products such as pyrrolidines, cyclic imides and lactones were formed during the reaction (See Fig. 70 ) [310]. The reaction showed several advantages such as mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Borghs and co-workers [310] designed a manganese complex for condensing biomass-based primary diols with amines to synthesize 2, 5-unsubstituted pyrroles under the solvent-free condition. Water and molecular hydrogen were the only by-products without the formation of pyrrolidines, cyclic imides, and lactones as undesired products (See Fig. 71 ). Mn(I) PNP hydride pincer complex catalysed the synthesis of quinolines and pyrimidines from primary, secondary and 2-amino-alcohols. The mechanistic study shows that one-pot tandem dehydrogenation and condensation steps led to C–C and C–N bond formation ejecting H2 and water as by-products. The catalytic material showed a broad substrate scope with a high catalytic activity [311]. The manganese-based pincer complexes catalysed homo-dehydrogenative coupling of 2-amino alcohols led to selective coupling of functionalized 2, 5-substituted pyrazine or 2, 5-dialkyl-substituted symmetrical pyrazine derivatives. Whereas, hetero-dehydrogenative coupling of 1, 2-diaminobenzene with 1, 2-diols also resulted in 2, 5-substituted pyrazine synthesis. The reaction plausibly proceeded via alcohol dehydrogenation followed by coupling with amines (See Fig. 72 ) [274]. Kalicharan et al. [275,312] have recently reported the synthesis of acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols followed by condensation with 1, 2-diamines, 1, 2 amino-alcohols and benzothiazole to quinoxalines, pyrazines and benzothiazoles by employing Mn(I) N2S-pincer complex. The non-phosphine ligand and the Earth-abundant manganese-based metal system makes this protocol attractive. In another report by the same group synthesized 2- and 1, 2-disubstituted benzimidazole using the same complex by acceptorless dehydrogenation (See Fig. 73 ). The manganese phosphine‐free N3‐pincer complex catalysed H-auto-transfer and C–C bond formation via α‐alkylations of ketones with primary alcohols. The catalyst had a broad substrate scope with high catalytic activity and selectivity. Quinoline derivatives were also prepared using 2‐aminobenzyl alcohol as the alkylating source and only hydrogen and water as byproducts [313] (See Fig. 74 ). 4.1.6 Multicomponent one pot cascade reactions involving alcohol oxidation The Mn(I) PNP pincer complex catalysed three-component aminomethylation of a series of aromatic compounds counting in naphthols, phenols, pyridines, indoles, carbazoles, and thiophenes on condensing amines and MeOH as a C1 source under facile and eco-friendly reaction method. The aforesaid reaction involves one-pot dehydrogenation and condensation steps in an atom economic reaction resulted in selective C– C and C–N bond formation eliminating hydrogen and water molecule as byproducts (See Fig. 75 ) [314]. Deibl et al.[315] have reported a multi-component reaction using the manganese-pincer-P2N2 complex as a catalyst for the synthesis of pyrimidines from amidines using three different alcohols. The reaction proceeded via multistep condensation and dehydrogenation steps resulting in C–C and C–N bond formation in a heterocyclic ring fully substituted pyrimidines in a single step (See Fig. 76 )."
10,Manganese-based heterogeneous catalyst for alcohol valorisation by acceptorless dehydrogenation,"The manganese-based heterogeneous catalysts have been sparsely investigated for alcohol dehydrogenation and valorisation. Herein, in the present section, we have discussed the heterogeneous manganese-based catalyst for the acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction. The MnO2 nanoparticles were immobilised on the 4-dichlorostyrene based microspheres (PDCS) nanocomposites was explored as a catalyst which exhibits high catalytic activity for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols with ketones, alcohols or o-phenylenediamine derivatives (See Fig. 77 ) [316]."
11,Conclusions and outlook,"To summarize, the present exhouastive review emphasises on the conversion of alcohol to value-added chemicals by manganese-based molecular, supported and heterogeneous catalyst under the oxidant or oxidant free conditions. Oxidant mediated alcohol oxidation by manganese-based molecular catalysts areof less importance because of homogeneous and non-recyclable and needs oxidants that are corrosive, difficult to handle or generate an ample amount of waste. However, manganese mediated enantioselective oxidation of alcohol is still topical because these enantioselective alcohols are useful ingredients for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine chemical industries. The manganese-based surface catalysts have attracted the researchers for the alcohol oxidation reaction as well as multicomponent reactions for alcohol valorisation. The manganese oxide (MnO2) based materials have been extensively investigated as highly catalyticaly active, selective and recyclable materials for alcohol activation. OMS-2 synthetic variants of MnO2 prepared by modulating the physicochemical properties and oxidation state via several chemical and synthetic methods enhance the catalytic performance for the alcohol value addition. More recently, acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD) has emerged as an alternative atom economic, green and environmentally benign process for alcohol valorisation. However, the AD method also has some shortcomings such as most of the manganese-based catalysts are homogenous and non-recyclable, therefore more heterogeneous and recyclable catalytic materials are desirable. Furthermore, the ligand molecules associated with manganese complexes are generally toxic and containing phosphine, therefore more facile protocol for designing phosphine free ligand processes are desirable. Although some preliminary work to explore more and more phosphine free ligands is on the way to abide by the environmental norms for more facile chemical synthesis. Also, most of the reports for the AD reactions for alcohol valorisation are homogeneous, but the heterogeneous catalysis for AD reactions has not received much attention. Therefore, more and more research works focusing on designing the manganese-based heterogeneous and recyclable catalysts for more benign, sustainable and clean chemical synthesis via manganese-based AD reactions."
