0,Introduction,"γ-Valerolactone (GVL) is a versatile lactone which can be directly used as fragrance, green solvent, monomer for biomass-derived plastics or gasoline blender. Furthermore, GVL is utilized to produce various bio-based products like aromatics (fuel additives), short chain alkenes (jet fuel) or long chain alkanes (diesel fuel) [1–3]. GVL can be synthesized from levulinic acid (LA) either by hydrogenation of LA to γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, which spontaneously condensates to GVL, or by dehydration of LA to angelica lactone, which is subsequently hydrogenated to GVL [4]. The condensation of LA to GVL occurs mainly in the presence of acid functionalities. LA as starting reactant is attractive since it can be easily generated from lignocellulosic feedstocks by selective chemical transformations [5–7]. In contrast to the complex production processes of other platform molecules (oxidation or biochemical processes like fermentation), only de- and rehydration reactions as well as a deformylation step (5-hydroxymethylfurfural to LA) are necessary to produce LA [8,9]. Various transition metal based catalysts, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, have been developed for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL [1,9–11]. Already in 1909, the hydrogenation of LA to GVL was reported by Sabatier and Mailhe [12] using a Raney-nickel catalyst in gas phase at 250°C. Also Christian et al. [13] used a Raney-nickel catalyst at 220°C for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL (GVL yields of 94%) and Schütte and Thomas [14] investigated the GVL synthesis using platinum oxide as catalyst and diethyl ether as solvent (GVL yields of 87%). Since 2000, the hydrogenation of LA to GVL has received renewed attention using supported Ru, Pd and Pt based catalysts in both continuous and discontinuous reaction modes at reaction temperatures between 130 and 220°C and hydrogen pressures up to 55bar. In most studies, various alcohols, water or different ethers were used as solvents and only a few investigations on solvent free hydrogenation of LA to GVL have been reported [3,4,11,15,16]. For instance, Al-Shaal et al. [17] tested 5wt.% Ru supported on activated carbon, Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 as catalysts for the GVL synthesis. The reactions were conducted in autoclaves using different solvents. Nearly quantitative conversion of LA to GVL was achieved after 2.5h using butanol as solvent, a hydrogen pressure of 20bar and a reaction temperature of 130°C. The groups of Manzer and Hutcherson [18] and Poliakoff [19] investigated the hydrogenation of LA to GVL in supercritical CO2 using 5wt.% Ru supported on Al2O3 (250bar, 150°C, 2h) and 5wt.% Ru supported on SiO2 (100bar, 200°C), respectively. In both studies quantitative conversion of LA to GVL was achieved. The use of Pd or Pt on acid supports like zeolites led to the hydrogenation of γ-valerolactone to 1,4-pentanediol which partly further condensates to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, thus decreasing the GVL selectivity [11,20–22]. The main disadvantage of noble metal based catalysts concerns their high costs and therefore the development of non-noble metal based catalysts is important. In the last few years non-noble metals like Ni or Cu were studied as hydrogenation catalysts for the GVL synthesis [3,23–31]. Manzer [3] investigated 5% Ni supported on carbon in 1,4-dioxane as solvent at a reaction temperature of 150°C, a reaction time of 2h and 55bar hydrogen pressure. Compared to other metals (Ir, Rh, Pd, Ru, Pt, Re), which were tested under the same conditions, Ni showed both the lowest conversion of LA (5%) and the lowest GVL selectivity (20%). The group of Rao [28,29] investigated Ni supported on different supports in a vapor phase hydrocyclization of LA to GVL at temperatures above 250°C under atmospheric pressure and obtained GVL yields of 80% with 30wt.% Ni on SiO2. Bimetallic catalysts like Ni–Cu/Al2O3 [30] or Ni–MoO x /C [26] were studied at high reaction temperatures (250°C) and H2 pressures (50–65bar) and with both catalysts GVL yields of over 90% were achieved. Up to now, little attention has been paid to the solvent and the preparation method for non noble metal based catalysts. Hence, we report here on the liquid phase hydrogenation of LA to GVL in different solvents using supported Ni/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by different preparation methods. This study focused on supported nickel catalysts as cheaper alternative to the expensive noble metals and Raney-nickel. Especially, solvent free conditions or water as solvent would enhance the sustainability of the GVL synthesis. All catalysts were well characterized before and after the reaction by nitrogen physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Four different Ni catalysts were prepared using wet impregnation (WI), incipient wetness impregnation (IWI), precipitation (P) and flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). Each catalyst has a metal content of 15wt% nickel. Nickel(II) nitrate (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as precursor, γ-Al2O3 (Carl Roth) as support for impregnation and precipitation and aluminum nitrate (Sigma–Aldrich) as precursor for flame spray pyrolysis. Wet impregnation was performed by suspending of 8.5g uncalcined γ-Al2O3 in 30mL of an aqueous Ni(II) nitrate solution (7.427g Ni(II) nitrate·6H2O) and the excess water was removed using a rotary evaporator. The impregnated catalyst was dried for 1h at 110°C and afterwards calcined for 5h at 600°C. The Ni/Al2O3_iwi catalyst was prepared by treating 8.5g of the uncalcined γ-Al2O3 with 8.5mL of an aqueous Ni(II) nitrate solution (7.427g Ni(II) nitrate·6H2O). The volume of the aqueous Ni(II) nitrate solution was equal to the pore volume of the γ-Al2O3 (pore volume 1cm3/g). The IWI catalyst was dried for 1h at 110°C and afterwards calcined for 5h at 450°C. Apart from this rather simple method we used additional preparation methods, which were applied after the solvent screening tests. For preparation of 15wt.% Ni/Al2O3 by precipitation, 8.5g of the uncalcined γ-Al2O3 were suspended in 100mL of an aqueous Ni(II) nitrate solution (7.427g Ni(II) nitrate·6H2O) and stirred for one hour. Thereafter, 465mL of a 0.1M NaOH solution were added at room temperature to the mixture until a pH of 9 was reached. The catalyst was filtered off, washed with distilled water until the pH of the filtrate was 7, dried for 1h at 110°C and afterwards calcined for 5h at 600°C. For flame spray pyrolysis 2.975g Ni(II) nitrate and 24.995g aluminum nitrate were dissolved in 120mL methanol, pumped with 5mL/min into the center of a methane/oxygen flame and dispersed with 5L/min oxygen to form a fine spray. The catalyst was collected on a filter 30cm above the flame and calcined at 600°C for 2h. The set up used for the flame spray pyrolysis was similar to the one described in [32]. Note that particle production and collection on the filter need to be performed in a fume hood and appropriate safety measures need to be undertaken not to be exposed to any nanoparticles. Ni/Al2O3_wi, Ni/Al2O3_p and Ni/Al2O3_fsp were reduced in a tubular furnace under 10% H2/N2 with a total flow of 20nL/h at 600°C for 2h (heating rate of 5K/min) while the Ni/Al2O3_iwi catalyst was only reduced at 450°C."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 Physisorption measurements The specific surface area of the catalysts was determined by N2 physisorption (Belsorp II mini, BEL Japan Inc.) at −196°C. All samples were outgassed for 2h at 300°C prior to the adsorption measurements. The BET surface area was determined using 10 points in the range of p/p 0 =0.05–0.3. 2.2.2 Temperature programmed reduction The reduction behavior of the catalysts was investigated by temperature programmed reduction and performed in a custom-made set-up. A calcined sample of the catalyst (100mg) was filled in a quartz glass tube, put in a tube furnace and heated up to 800°C (5K/min) in 5% H2/Ar with a total flow of 96mL/min. The H2 concentration of the influent and effluent gas was measured with a thermal conductivity detector and afterwards the H2 consumption was plotted against the temperature. 2.2.3 X-ray diffraction Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a PANalytical X‘Pert PRO diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Ni filter; Cu Kα1 =1.54060Å and Cu Kα2 =1.54443Å). The scan was recorded in a 2θ range of 20–80° with 0.017° step width and an acquisition time of 0.51s per data point. Crystalline phases were determined using the Cambridge structural data base (CSD), Cambridge crystallographic center, as a reference data base. The Scherrer equation was used to estimate the mean particle diameter of the nickel particles and their dispersion [33]. A LaB6 standard was used to calibrate and correct the instrumental line broadening. 2.2.4 In situ X-ray diffraction In situ X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance with Cu Kα radiation (Cu Kα1 =1.5406Å and Cu Kα2 =1.54439Å). The calcined catalyst was loaded in an in situ XRD cell (Anton Paar, XRK900) and afterwards heated stepwise in 50°C steps to 650°C in 5% H2/N2 with a total flow of 100mL/min. At each temperature a scan was recorded in a 2θ range of 20–80° (0.016° step width, 1s data acquisition time, total 1h). For analysis of the crystalline phase, the reflections were assigned using references from the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD). 2.2.5 Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry The nickel content of the catalysts was validated by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) using an Agilent 720/725-ES spectrometer. The catalyst was dissolved in HNO3, HCl, HF and 30% H2O2 in a microwave at 600W for 2h, afterwards diluted with distilled water and finally injected in the plasma. 2.2.6 Transmission electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy was conducted on a FEI Tecnai 20 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200kV with a LaB6 filament. Typically, a small amount of sample was ground and suspended in ethanol, sonicated and dispersed over a Cu grid with a carbon film. 2.2.7 X-ray absorption spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectra at the Ni K edge (8333eV) in terms of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were recorded in transmission mode at the bending magnet beamline ANKA-XAS of the ANKA synchrotron radiation facility (Karlsruhe, Germany). The energy of the X-rays was scanned by a Si(111) double crystal monochromator (DCM). Higher harmonics were rejected by detuning the DCM to 60% of its maximum intensity using a D-Mostab (Struck, Germany). XAS spectra were recorded on pelletized samples (pressed after dilution in cellulose) using a beam of 1mm×7mm (height×width). Data reduction and analysis were carried out using Athena and Artemis software of the IFEFFIT package [34]. The spectra were energy calibrated using a reference Ni foil (E 0 =8333eV), normalized and background subtracted using the autobkg algorithm in Athena software. In addition, a least-square linear combination analysis fitting of the normalized XANES spectra was performed in the energy range −20 to +90eV relative to the edge position to identify the fraction of mixed phases. The XANES spectra of NiO, Ni foil, NiAl2O4 and highly dispersed NiO particles obtained by wet impregnation were used as potential components. For analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) only the single scattering paths were considered. The corresponding theoretical backscattering amplitudes and phases were calculated by the FEFF 6.0 code [35,36]. The theoretical single scattering paths were adjusted to the experimental ones by a least square method in R-space to obtain the coordination number (N), bond distances (R), and mean square deviation of interatomic distances (σ 2). The amplitude reduction factor (S 0) was obtained by refining a Ni reference foil and used for the other samples. The absolute misfit between theory and experiment is expressed by the ρ factor (cf. Ref. [37])."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Screening of catalysts in aqueous phase or under solvent free conditions was carried out in custom-made batch autoclaves (max. temperature 350°C, max. pressure 200bar, volume 65mL). Catalytic tests in other solvents (monovalent alcohols, acetic acid, decane) were performed in a Parr batch autoclave allowing higher temperature and pressure (max. temperature 500°C, max. pressure 350bar, volume 100mL). After charging the reactor with 10mL of the reaction mixture (solvent and LA) and the 0.1g of catalyst, the reactor was purged with nitrogen and pressurized with hydrogen. The ratio of solvents and LA was 20:1 (mLsolvent/gLA) and the typical molar ratio of Ni and LA was 1:30. The turnover frequency was calculated with the starting amount of LA in mol (n LA), the LA conversion (X LA), the amount of Ni in mol (n Ni) and the dispersion (D). TOF = ( n LA ⋅ ( X LA / 100 ) ) / time D ⋅ n Ni The dispersion was obtained from the mean particle size calculated using the Scherrer equation according to Ref. [33]. The custom made autoclave was heated with a heating sleeve and a heating plate and was magnetically stirred whereas for the Parr batch autoclave a tube furnace was used and the mixture was stirred using a mechanical stirrer. The starting point of the reaction was defined as the time, when the desired temperature was reached (usually after 20–30min). After the corresponding reaction time the reactor was quenched in an ice bath, depressurized, flushed with nitrogen and finally the product was separated from the catalyst by centrifugation."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The product mixtures of the catalytic tests in aqueous medium or neat LA were diluted with distilled water and afterwards analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a HPLC apparatus from Merck–Hitachi containing a BioRad organic acid column (Aminex HPX 87H), a refraction index detector and a UV detector (wavelength: 254nm). A 0.004M sulfuric acid solution was used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.5mL/min. The column was operated at a temperature of 40°C with a pressure of 45bar. The product mixtures of the catalytic tests with organic solvents were analyzed using gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC2010 plus; polar Restek column (Rxi®-624Sil)) and tetradecane (TD) as internal standard to calculate the LA and GVL concentrations."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Standard characterization The Ni contents, BET surface areas, reduction peaks and crystalline phases of the four catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The Ni content was similar for all catalysts and in good accordance with the theoretical values. The specific BET surface areas of Ni/Al2O3_wi, Ni/Al2O3_p and Ni/Al2O3_iwi were 96m2/g, 122m2/g and 98m2/g, respectively, which is slightly lower than the surface area of pure γ-Al2O3 (145m2/g). The surface area of the Ni/Al2O3_fsp catalyst (31m2/g) was significantly lower than that of Ni/Al2O3_wi, Ni/Al2O3_iwi and Ni/Al2O3_p, but in the same range like typical values for nickel aluminates [38]. The structure of the four 15wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was further investigated by powder X-ray diffraction. The XRD patterns of the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation, incipient wetness impregnation and precipitation showed a NiO phase for the calcined catalysts and metallic Ni for the reduced catalysts. Ni/Al2O3_iwi was reduced at 450°C and the NiO phase was still found after the reduction. The XRD patterns of the Ni/Al2O3_wi, Ni/Al2O3_iwi and Ni/Al2O3_p catalysts after the reaction were similar to the XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts before the reaction. The Ni or NiO particle size of the reduced Ni/Al2O3_wi, Ni/Al2O3_p and Ni/Al2O3_iwi catalysts was estimated using the Scherrer equation resulting in about 50nm for Ni/Al2O3_wi and Ni/Al2O3_p (reflections of Ni) and about 7nm for Ni/Al2O3_iwi (reflections of NiO). Ni particles which are too small to be detected by XRD are not contributing in this case (see also TEM results). The XRD patterns of the Ni/Al2O3_wi, Ni/Al2O3_p, Ni/Al2O3_fsp and Ni/Al2O3_iwi catalysts both in calcined and reduced form are shown in Fig. S1 of the Electronic Supporting Information (ESI). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the calcined, the reduced and the used Ni/Al2O3_fsp catalysts were similar. Only reflections from γ-Al2O3 and no Ni containing phases were found (Fig. S1). Also possible nickel aluminum spinel formation could not be identified using X-ray diffraction. The reduction behavior of Ni/Al2O3_wi, Ni/Al2O3_p Ni/Al2O3_iwi and Ni/Al2O3_fsp was further investigated by TPR and gave similar results for the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and precipitation. For both catalysts the reduction started at 300°C and the H2 consumption featured a broad peak at 380°C. A second peak of the H2 consumption was observed for both catalysts at 700°C which was more defined for the wet impregnated catalyst. The two peaks of the H2 consumption may result from a broad particle size distribution. Large NiO particles are reported to be reduced at lower temperatures (300–400°C) while higher temperatures (600–750°C) are necessary for the reduction of small NiO particles [39]. The reduction of Ni/Al2O3_iwi started at 350°C and the H2 consumption featured a broad peak with a maximum at 530°C. Also for the catalyst prepared by flame spray pyrolysis reduction started at 300°C and the H2 consumption increased continuously to 800°C. The continuously increasing H2 consumption might be caused by the structure of the FSP catalyst. Due to the high temperature (>900°C) during the flame spray pyrolysis a spinel structure (NiAl2O4) or NiO, which is enclosed in alumina and thus more difficult to reduce, might be formed. The TPR profile of the FSP catalyst was similar to those reported for Ni aluminum spinels [40,41]. In addition, transmission electron microscopic analysis was conducted for the reduced Ni/Al2O3_wi and Ni/Al2O3_p catalysts to gain insight into the existence of small and large Ni particles as assumed from XRD and TPR analysis. Also TEM images of the Ni/Al2O3_fsp catalyst were recorded as the Ni phase is invisible in XRD and to unravel the Ni particle size. The corresponding TEM images of the three catalysts can be found in the ESI (Figs. S2–S4). The TEM images confirm the existence of small and large Ni particles on the Ni/Al2O3_wi and Ni/Al2O3_p catalysts. Also small Ni particles on the Ni/Al2O3_fsp catalyst, as assumed from XAS measurements (Section 3.1.2), could be verified. The particle size analysis supports the data from XRD. Since re-oxidation of the small Ni particles resulted in a bad contrast in the TEM images we used the average particle size determined by XRD for calculation of the TOF (Section 3.3). To investigate the reduction behavior of the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation in more detail and to determine the optimal reduction temperature we followed the reduction via in situ XRD. Similar to the TPR results reduction of NiO to Ni started at 300°C. The XRD pattern collected at 300°C showed reflections of both NiO and minor contributions of metallic Ni. The broad temperature range of reduction obtained with TPR could be proven by the in situ collected XRD patterns. All XRD patterns between 300°C and 550°C showed reflections of NiO and metallic Ni (cf. ESI, Fig. S5). At 600°C the XRD pattern featured only a metallic Ni phase indicating a fully reduced catalyst. 3.1.2 X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS and XANES) Fig. 1a shows the near edge X-ray absorption spectra at the Ni K edge for the reduced 15wt.% Ni catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (wi), precipitation (p) and flame spray pyrolysis (fsp). According to XRD analysis (Fig. S5) this treatment at 600°C under H2 led to a completely reduced Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst. Due to the similar structural data the same is expected for Ni/Al2O3_p. On the other hand, the XAS analysis unraveled that these catalysts were partially oxidized after air exposure. Due to the lower white line intensity and edge position, one may infer that the Ni/Al2O3_wi and Ni/Al2O3_p catalysts were more reduced than the Ni/Al2O3_fsp catalyst. This ex situ XAS analysis reflected the state of the catalyst as they were loaded in the batch reactor. Re-oxidation may partially occur for the Ni/Al2O3_fsp after the reduction procedure as well. The refinement of EXAFS data provided further information on the local chemical environment of Ni. Fig. 1b shows the experimental and refined Fourier transformed k 2 weighted EXAFS spectra of Ni/Al2O3_wi and Ni/Al2O3_p. The backscattering contributions of the oxygen and Ni neighbors of the Ni/Al2O3_p catalyst is higher than those of Ni/Al2O3_wi. This is also reflected by the lower coordination numbers (Table 2 ) and indicates that Ni/Al2O3_wi has smaller particles than Ni/Al2O3_p, although they appear to be very similar both from TPR and XRD analysis (Table 1). According to the fit results in Table 2 Ni/Al2O3_wi and Ni/Al2O3_p contain mainly metallic species, although some oxygen neighbors were also found around Ni (more details on the refinement and individual scattering paths in the ESI, cf. Fig. S6). In order to shed more insight into the structure of the partially reduced fsp catalyst, linear combination fitting of the Ni K edge XANES spectrum with the reduced Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst (mainly small metallic particles), a NiAl2O4 reference and NiO was conducted (Fig. 2 ). The linear combination analysis unraveled that the Ni/Al2O3_fsp catalyst could be best described as a combination of 47% NiAl2O4 and air exposed Ni particles (fraction of 53%, reduced Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst). Linear combinations based on a combination of NiO and metallic Ni resulted in poor agreement (cf. ESI, Fig. S7). Hence, the fsp-derived catalyst seems to be best described by a mixture of Ni present as a spinel-like phase and as metallic Ni after reduction at 600°C. This is in line with previous studies showing that catalysts prepared by flame spray pyrolysis are more difficult to reduce than impregnated ones, since the metal ions can be within the oxide lattice [42]. According to powder X-ray diffraction (only the presence of an Al2O3 phase is visible) Ni is highly dispersed. Hence, a structural model was built to refine the EXAFS data based on the following assumptions: (i) one first coordination shell with Ni in a spinel-like phase in octahedral coordination and the outer shells with Ni in the lattice of Al2O3 (ii) a metallic Ni phase. The Fourier transformed EXAFS spectrum and corresponding refinement are presented in Fig. S8. The results suggest that at least some of the Ni atoms were incorporated into the Al2O3 lattice during the preparation. Therefore it could be that surface Ni was reduced forming the metallic particles whereas the incorporated fraction was converted into a spinel-like phase. The spinel-like phase was similar to those reported by Fu et al. [43]. In this study the authors annealed Ni acetate impregnated on γ-Al2O3. While the sample treated at 500°C presented mainly NiO features, the spectra for the samples treated at 750°C and 950°C were similar to the one obtained for Ni/Al2O3_fsp in the present study. However, their Ni–O spinel-like bond length was around 1.83Å, whereas in the present study we have found 2.02Å (Table 2), indicating that only a spinel-like phase is formed in case of Ni/Al2O3_fsp. In summary, the local structure of nickel was strongly influenced by the preparation method, which therefore may play an important role on the catalytic activity (see comparison of catalysts in Section 3.3). Both precipitation and wet impregnation resulted in small metallic Ni particles covered by oxygen. However, the impregnation method led to smaller particles. On the other hand, the flame made material was composed of a mixture of metallic Ni and Ni in an Al2O3 matrix. Together with the particle size obtained from the XRD patterns, the analysis of the TPR and TEM images, these result support the hypothesis that also small Ni particles (2–4nm) exist beside few large Ni particles (50nm). In contrast to XRD, which only detects particles above 5nm, all Ni particles are probed in a global manner by EXAFS (not locally like in TEM). H2 chemisorption measurements on the Ni/Al2O3_fsp catalysts were performed to determine the particle size of the small particles. Due to the spinel formation, very high reduction temperatures were required to achieve full reduction. For the chemisorption measurements we reduced the catalyst at 600°C as we did before the catalytic tests. After the reduction at 600°C the catalyst is not completely reduced. Note that the real dispersion might be higher than the calculated value since the excact degree of reduction could not be determined."
8,Conversion of LA to GVL in different solvents,"3.2 Conversion of LA to GVL in different solvents First, the influence of different solvents on the conversion of LA to GVL was investigated using Ni/Al2O3_iwi and Ni/Al2O3_wi as catalysts. Different monovalent alcohols (C1–C5), acetic acid, DMF and water were used as solvents. Using acetic acid only traces of GVL were found in the reaction mixture. Using DMF a GVL yield of only 3% was achieved at a LA conversion of 24%. Hence, these solvents were not suitable for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL (cf. Table S1). Fig. 3 shows LA conversion and GVL yield obtained with different alcohols and water as solvent. Quantitative conversion of LA was obtained using methanol, 1-butanol and 1-pentanol as solvent. The conversions of LA in ethanol and 2-propanol were 75% and 87%, respectively, while only 2% of LA conversion was observed in aqueous medium. In contrast to the high LA conversion, GVL yields were comparatively low in the presence of alcohols. The highest GVL yield of 34% was achieved with 2-propanol. 1-Butanol and 1-pentanol resulted in a GVL yield of only 19%. With methanol and ethanol the GVL yield was lower than 10%. The GVL yield using water as solvent was 2% which is much lower compared to catalytic tests with alcohols. However, the selectivity was 100% in the presence of water. A selectivity of 100% to GVL was also found when Pd [22], Cu–ZrO2 [27] and Ni–MoO x [26] catalysts were used in water, whereas Ru/C as catalyst [17] resulted in a lower GVL selectivity of 86%. The low selectivity toward GVL in the presents of alcohols can be explained by esterification of LA to the corresponding levulinic acid esters (cf. Fig. S9) in good agreement with the literature [27]. The gas chromatograms (Fig. S9, ESI) indicate that the corresponding levulinic acid esters were the main side products (except using methanol and 2-propanol as solvent). The levulinic ester yields were also estimated with the effective carbon number (ECN) method and the obtained yields can be found in Table S2 in the ESI. Also Palkovits et al. [17] described the formation of levulinic acid esters, thus lowering the GVL yields. Note that the levulinic acid ester formation decreased the GVL yields more significantly if Ni catalysts were used because noble metal based catalysts also catalyze the GVL formation starting from levulinic acid esters and therefore in those cases alcohols are often used as solvents [17,44]. A longer reaction time for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL in the presence of an alcohol did not increase the GVL yield, even at 100% LA conversion. Note that no 4-hydroxypentanoic acid was found, also not by NMR (not shown). The highest GVL selectivity over Ni/Al2O3_iwi in the presence of an alcohol was obtained for 2-propanol (39%). Additionally, a possible influence of the H2 pressure was investigated using 2-propanol and water as solvents. Fig. 4 shows LA conversion, GVL yields and selectivities at hydrogen pressures between 5 and 50bar with 2-propanol as solvent. Both LA conversion and GVL yield increased from 70% (conversion) and 9% (yield) at 5bar H2 pressure to 87% (conversion) and 34% (yield) at 10bar H2 pressure. Further increase of the pressure led to a decrease of the LA conversion as well as the GVL yield to 45% and 25% (at 30bar) and to 22% and 20% (at 50bar), respectively. Interestingly, the selectivity toward GVL increased over the whole pressure range. Obviously, the side reaction to the corresponding levulinic acid ester was suppressed at elevated hydrogen pressure. Fig. 5 depicts the LA conversion and GVL yields with water as solvent at different hydrogen pressures. Compared to the test in 2-propanol, the reactions were carried out at 200°C with a reaction time of 4h and the Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst (reduced at 600°C) was used. A higher reaction temperature of 200°C and a reaction time of 4h led to an increased LA conversion (20%) compared to 2% LA conversion at 150°C and a reaction time of 6h (cf. Fig. 3). Also the higher reduction temperature of the Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst (600°C) might affect the catalytic activity. The GVL selectivity was 100% at both reaction temperatures. In contrast to the tests with 2-propanol both the LA conversion and GVL yield increased with rising H2 pressure when water was used as solvent. The LA conversion rose to 37% at 30bar and the highest GVL yield (57%) was obtained with a hydrogen pressure of 50bar. With respect to the behavior in water a similar trend was found on Pd catalysts [22] and the reported LA conversions are similar to those presented in our study. Catalyst stability is an important issue, especially under hydrothermal conditions. Analysis of the Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst after the reactions in water revealed a partial phase change of the γ-Al2O3 support to boehmite."
9,Solvent free conversion of LA to GVL,"3.3 Solvent free conversion of LA to GVL To prevent side reactions with alcohols to levulinic acid esters and to potentially increase the LA conversion compared to the use of water as solvent, the hydrogenation of LA to GVL was additionally conducted in the absence of solvents. GVL is reported as a good solvent for the LA hydrogenation to GVL [45,46]. Therefore, the formed GVL in the solvent free hydrogenation of LA might have a positive effect on the catalytic activity. For the catalytic tests with neat LA, 10g LA and 50bar H2 pressure were used for all experiments. Hydrogen consumption was very high under these conditions which resulted in a significant pressure drop. Fig. 6 shows LA conversion and GVL yields after a reaction time of 4h at different reaction temperatures. To obtain comparable data, Ni/Al2O3_wi was used in all parameter optimization experiments. At 120°C a LA conversion of only 2% was obtained which increased at higher reaction temperatures. LA conversions of 44% and 92% were achieved at 180°C and 200°C, respectively. The GVL selectivity was 100% at all temperatures. Also for other transition metal catalysts or those containing Raney-nickel, reaction temperatures above 200°C were required to achieve LA conversions in the same range (>80%) as reported for noble metal catalyst [13,22,26,30]. A reaction temperature of 200°C as reported here is still quite low for non-noble metal catalysts at comparable catalyst/reactant ratio to obtain a LA conversion over 90%. The influence of the catalyst amount on the LA conversion is depicted in Fig. 7 . The LA conversion and GVL selectivity were about 2% in the absence of any catalyst (blank test) and increased from 11% (0.6mol% Ni) to 92% (3.0mol% Ni) with increasing nickel content. In the literature, generally higher reaction temperatures were required to obtain comparable LA conversion and GVL yield when similar Ni concentrations (1–3mol% Ni [26,30]) were applied. Finally, the reaction time was varied and the obtained GVL yields are depicted in Fig. 8 . The GVL yields increased continuously with longer reaction times. The starting point of the reaction (t =0h) was defined after reaching the desired temperature, when a GVL yield of 5% was found. After 30min and 1h the GVL yield increased to 20% and 33%, respectively, and after 4h 92% GVL yield were achieved. The GVL selectivity was 100% in all cases. Although the catalyst did not show a significant deactivation with increasing reaction time (Fig. 8), recycling experiments unraveled a drop in the catalytic activity (Table 3 ). Washing of the catalyst with acetone before the second run resulted in a complete loss of activity. Washing, calcination and reduction of the catalyst before the second run increased the activity compared to the simple washing step. However, the LA conversion and GVL yields were still 44% lower compared to the 1st run with the fresh catalyst. The characterization data of the spent catalysts did not show significant changes in their structure which could explain the loss of activity. Also ICP–OES analysis of the catalyst after the reaction and the second run did not show metal leaching which might explain the lower catalytic activity. The reason for this deactivation is presently studied in our laboratory in more detail and continuous-flow experiments in a fixed-bed reactor are presently conducted. This has the advantage that the catalyst is not exposed to air and/or other solvents after the reaction which may also have an influence on the reaction. The parameter screening of the hydrogentation of LA to GVL under solventless conditions using the 3mol% Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst unraveled that the highest LA conversion (92%) and GVL yield (92%) were obtained at a reaction temperature of 200°C. For comparison, catalysts prepared by precipitation and flame spray pyrolysis were tested under these optimized conditions (Fig. 9 ). LA conversion and GVL yield were much lower with Ni/Al2O3_p (25%) and Ni/Al2O3_fsp (45%) compared to Ni/Al2O3_wi (92%). The lower catalytic activity of Ni/Al2O3_fsp may be caused by a partial incorporation of Ni into the framework structure of the support, as evidenced by TPR and XAS (cf. Section 3.1). The significantly lower LA conversion of Ni/Al2O3_p compared to the Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst is surprising since it featured similar textural properties (see Section. 3.1). Both the peaks in the TPR and the reflections for NiO and Ni in the calcined and the reduced catalyst were similar. The surface area of the precipitated catalyst was slightly higher. Also the XANES analysis showed strong similarities. Only EXAFS analysis showed significantly higher backscattering contributions for the precipitated catalyst (Fig. S6) and thus also the data fitting resulted in smaller Ni–Ni coordination numbers for Ni/Al2O3_wi than Ni/Al2O3_p. Hence, the difference in the catalytic activity may result from Ni particles with smaller size (<5nm) which are invisible by XRD but detected by EXAFS. In contrast to Ni/Al2O3_wi, the Ni particles were not detected by XRD. Although only 50% of the Ni sites are probably available in the flame-made catalyst, as LC-analysis gave nearly a 1:1 ratio of Ni particles and Ni in spinel-like structures, it is remarkable that the FSP catalyst was significantly better than the catalyst prepared by precipitation reaching almost half of the conversion of the wet impregnated catalyst. The TOF and initial rates of the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and precipitation were calculated at ∼20% LA conversion (Table 4 ). Note that the particle size derived by XRD was used for the TOF calculation of both catalysts, which may disregard smaller particles. The TOF and initial rate of the WI catalyst are about six times higher compared to that of the precipitated catalyst and may be attributed to the smaller particles as seen by EXAFS on the Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst. This is consistent with the statement that smaller Ni particles are more active for the LA hydrogenation to GVL. To our knowledge the highest TON for nickel catalysts reported in literature is 4950 at 250°C after 24h [26]. Hence, the Ni/Al2O3_wi catalyst shows very interesting turnover rates at similar LA conversions and GVL yields (>90%) but a lower reaction temperatures. This indicates that Ni particles with a size <5nm lead to an increased catalytic activity and thus to much higher LA conversions and GVL yields. The higher activity of smaller Ni particles was also found for other hydrogenation reactions, e.g., for the hydrogenation of benzene with supported Ni catalysts, as described by Molina and Poncelet [47]."
10,Conclusions,"Four different 15wt.% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared using different preparation methods that lead to different textural and catalytic properties in the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. In the first part of the study solvents and reactions conditions were varied to optimize the hydrogenation of LA to GVL over Ni-based catalysts. For this purpose a standard IWI catalyst was used. Among all alcohols, 2-propanol gave highest GVL yield (34% at 87% LA conversion). Due to side reactions to the corresponding levulinic acid esters, GVL selectivity was relatively low (40%) at 10bar H2 pressure. By increasing the hydrogen pressure both LA conversion and GVL yields decreased, but the GVL selectivity increased (91% at 50bar). Using water as solvent the GVL selectivity was 100% although higher reaction temperatures were required. Under optimized conditions (reaction temperature: 200°C, reaction time 4h, p H 2 = 50 bar , n Ni:n LA =0.3, reduction temperature 600°C) GVL yields of 57% were achieved. This could be further improved by optimizing the catalyst preparation and the solvent. The most attractive results of this study concern the hydrogenation of LA to GVL under solvent free conditions. In all cases, the GVL selectivity was 100% and the best GVL yields (92%) were obtained at 200°C with 3mol% Ni after 4h. The catalytic activity of the GVL synthesis depended strongly on the reaction temperature. Among the different catalysts Ni/Al2O3_wi showed the highest catalytic activity (GVL yield 92%) of all applied catalysts with high reaction rates. The comparison with catalysts prepared by flame spray pyrolysis and precipitation indicated that the difference in catalytic activity could probably be explained by the different Ni particle sizes and a partial incorporation of Ni into the lattice. Combined TPR, XRD and EXAFS analysis unraveled that the flame made catalyst featured a fraction of Ni incorporated into the lattice of the support, whereas the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation contained both small particles (active, as evidenced by EXAFS and TEM, invisible for XRD) and larger particles (reduced at low temperatures in TPR and detected by XRD). Hence, smaller Ni particles seem to be beneficial for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL."
