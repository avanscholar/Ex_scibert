0,Introduction,"CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been increasing due to the continuing consumption of fossil fuels worldwide, and the resulting global climate change has become a major challenge [1]. Alternatively, CO2 could be regarded as an abundant, renewable and economical feedstock, utilization of which into chemicals and fuels is very attractive [2–9]. CO2 hydrogenation has recently been extensively investigated to produce saleable products such as CO, CH4, methanol, light olefins (C2-C4 =) and fuels (C5+ hydrocarbons) using H2 ideally produced with renewable energy sources [10,11]. Among these, selective production of light olefins is considered prospective. Light olefins are key feedstocks in chemical industries for the manufacture of a wide range of products. Currently, light olefins are mainly produced from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha [12]. Using CO2 as a raw material to produce light olefins can not only alleviate the global warming, but also offer an alternative solution to replace the depleting fossil fuels. The routes of CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins are generally classified into (1) the indirect tandem routes requiring oxygenates as intermediates, where methanol-to-olefins (MTO), dimethyl ether-to-olefins, and dehydration of lower alcohols are usually involved [13], and (2) the direct route from CO2 to olefins, which is economically more competitive by substituting the one-step route for the more complicated two-step routes [14]. Direct hydrogenation of CO2 into hydrocarbons is regarded as a modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (CO2-FTS) process, with an initial reduction of CO2 to CO via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (eqn (1)) followed by the hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons via FTS [15–18] (eqn (2)). Fe-based catalysts are active in both processes above [19], and therefore expected to exhibit good performance for the hydrogenation of CO2 to high-value hydrocarbons. (1) CO2+H2 ⇌ CO+H2O ΔH298K = +41.2 kJ mol−1 (2) CO +H2 → (−CH2-) n + H2O ΔH298K = -152 kJ mol−1 To increase the selectivity toward hydrocarbons on iron-based catalysts, promoters are commonly added, such as cerium [20,21], copper [22–24], zinc [25–27], manganese [15,26,28], etc. Song et al. and others found that the Co promoters can accelerate consumption of CO from the RWGS reaction to increase CO2 conversion over Fe-based catalysts [29–32]. Moreover, the addition of sodium or potassium can increase the adsorption of CO2 and accelerate the formation of active χ-Fe5C2 species during the reactions. CO2 conversion increased and olefin production was enhanced over Na-modified iron catalysts [33]. Liu and his group found that the intimate contact between Fe and Co sites favors a higher selectivity to C2+ hydrocarbons in supported catalysts [31]. Unfortunately, there are few studies on the effect of the intimacy between Co and Fe sites in the hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins. In this work, CoFe2O4 was synthesized as a high-dispersion precursor of Fe–Co catalysts through a simple hydrothermal method and applied in CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. We discuss the effect of the intimacy between Fe and Co, and its influence on the catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. As a result, our new Fe–Co catalyst derived from CoFe2O4 overcomes the common barriers of CO2 hydrogenation, and high CO2 conversion as well as high selectivity to light olefin (C2-C4 =) can be achieved. In addition, the catalysts show no significant deactivation over 100 h."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts CoFe2O4 was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method according to a reported procedure [34,35]. In this method, 10 mmol of Fe(NO3)3 ·6H2O (>99 %, Aladdin Chemicals) and 5 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (>99 %, Aladdin Chemicals) was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water at room temperature. The NaOH (>99 %, Aladdin Chemicals) aqueous solution, which consists of 8 g of NaOH and 60 mL of deionized water, was added to the above solution dropwise with vigorous stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (Made by Kemi Corp.), and then heated in an oven at 180 °C for 24 h. The product was centrifuged and washed with deionized water, and dried at 80 °C overnight. The amount of residual Na is negligible after washing with more than 6 L of water, and then Na-free CoFe2O4 was obtained. The Na-CoFe2O4 was obtained by washing with 500 mL of deionized water. The Fe2O3 reference was also synthesized by the similar hydrothermal method starting with only Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. The Co3O4 was prepared by precipitation of a solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O using aqueous ammonia as the precipitating agent under the conditions of pH = 8 and 80 °C. The obtained precipitate was then filtered, washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. Co3O4 and Fe2O3 were physically mixed with mortar and pestle with a Co:Fe molar ratio of 1:2, which is denoted as Fe-Co-M. The Co was also impregnated onto the Fe2O3 using the Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution, and the product was obtained after drying at 80 °C and calcination at 400 °C for 4 h, which is denoted as Fe-Co-I."
3,Catalyst evaluation,"2.2 Catalyst evaluation The catalytic CO2 hydrogenation was carried out in a fixed bed reactor, where 0.5 g of the catalyst was loaded for each test unless otherwise noted. All samples were pre-reduced in a pure H2 flow at 400 °C for 4 h. After the reduction, the feed gas was switched to the mixture gas of CO2/H2/N2 with the molar ratio of 21/63/16 under the reaction conditions of 3 MPa, 320 °C and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 7200 mL g−1 h-1, unless otherwise noted. The dependence of selectivity on CO2 conversion was examined by changing the catalyst weight and feed gas flow rate (space velocity). The products were analyzed on-line by using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B). CO, CH4, CO2 and N2 were analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and the hydrocarbons were analyzed by a flame ionization detector (FID). Chromatograms of FID and TCD were correlated through CH4 and product selectivity was obtained based on carbon. The conversion of CO2 and product selectivity were calculated as eqn. (3), (4) and (5): (3) C O 2 C on v e r s i o n = n C O 2 i n - n C O 2 o u t n C O 2 i n × 100 % (4) C O S ele c t i v i t y = n C O n C O + ∑ i × n C i H x × 100% (5) C i H x S ele c t i v i t y = i × n C i H x n C O + ∑ i × n C i H x × 100 % where nCO2 in and nCO2 out represent the molar concentration of CO2 in the feed and effluent, respectively; nCO represents the molar concentration of CO in the effluent; nCiHx represents the molar concentration of hydrocarbons in the effluent; i represents the carbon number."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a Rigaku Smartlab 9 kw diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with 0.02° step size and a scanning rate of 8°/min over the range between 5° and 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed over a spectrometer (Model Max 200, Leybold, Germany), using Al Kα radiation as an excitation source. For the XRD and XPS measurements of the reduced catalysts, passivation treatment with 1% O2/99 % N2 at room temperature was applied after the reduction with H2 at 400 °C, 3,0 MPa for 4 h. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis was carried out using a PerkinElmer AVIO 500 apparatus. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was analyzed on a ChemBET Pulsar TPR equipment (Quantachrome, USA) to analyze the reducibility of the samples. About 100 mg of catalyst was placed in a quartz tube in the interior of a controlled oven. Prior to the reduction, the catalyst sample was purged with high-purity He at 500 °C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature. The TPR program was then initiated with a gas mixture containing 5 vol % H2/Ar at a flow rate of 30 mL/min and heating rate at 10 °C/min up to 900 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping were acquired using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (QUANTA450, FEI USA). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were carried out on a Tecnai G2 20 S-twin instrument (FEI Company) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The catalysts were dispersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated for 10 min. And then, some droplets of the supernatant liquid were dripped on a carbon film-coated copper grid and followed by drying at ambient temperature. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained by using the Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI gas adsorption analyzer at −196 °C. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 6 h. The total surface area was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties,"3.1 Physicochemical properties The XRD patterns (Fig. 1 a) exhibit reflections at 2 theta values of 18.38°, 30.20°, 35.56°, 43.18°, 43.56°, 57.06°, and 62.68° which can be assigned to spinel ferrite CoFe2O4 (JCPDS no. 22-1086). The presence or absence of sodium does not change the phase of the catalyst. The reflections of Fe2O3 and Co3O4 match well with the spinel-type of JCPDS:33−0664 and JCPDS: 43–1003, respectively. The Fe-Co-I sample shows the patterns of both Fe2O3 and Co3O4. Fe2O3 and Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst precursors were pre-reduced in a H2 flow at 400 °C for 4 h before the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction. According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 1b) of reduced CoFe2O4, there is no metallic cobalt observed. As a comparison, Fe2O3 is reduced to metallic iron under the same conditions. Although the XRD patterns of CoFe alloy is almost identical to those of Fe (0), the partial enlarged drawing of reduced catalysts (Fig. 1c) indicates the formation of FeCo alloy (JCPDS:49−1568), given the presence of a large amount of Co in the catalysts, as also supported by the catalytic results which will be discussed later."
7,Catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation It is worthy to note that before the catalytic tests, all the catalysts were reduced with 100 % H2 at 400 °C, and the XRD results have confirmed a full reduction of all catalysts. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, after reduction Fe2O3 catalyst shows typical performance of Fe-based FTS catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation with a CO2 conversion of 25.4 % and fair selectivity to C2-C4 hydrocarbons but low ratio of olefin to paraffin. The physically mixed Fe-Co-M exhibits 49.4 % CO2 conversion under the same reaction conditions. The addition of Co remarkably increases the CO2 conversion and methane formation at the expense of CO and heavier hydrocarbons. The CoFe2O4 catalyst shows a further improved CO2 conversion of 56.8 % (15 % higher than that of Fe-Co-M). According to the reaction rates [expressed as Fe time yield (FTY), i.e., moles of CO2 converted per g of Fe in the catalyst per second], the Fe-Co-M catalyst shows a significantly higher FTY (19.5 μmol gFe −1 s-1) than that of the bare Fe2O3 (6.8 μmol gFe −1 s-1), and the CoFe2O4 catalyst has the highest FTY (22.4 μmol gFe −1 s-1). In general, the introduction of Co efficiently promotes the conversion of CO2 by consuming the CO intermediate, and the product distribution is also significantly altered. Therefore, the most conspicuous characteristic of the CoFe2O4 catalyst is the selectivity of the hydrocarbon products from CO2 hydrogenation. Firstly, the selectivity of CO is suppressed from 19.4 % to 2.6 %, and that of methane increases slightly from 30.8% to 32.1%. It is well known that the Co sites are responsible for CC coupling in CO hydrogenation and methanation in CO2 hydrogenation [36,37]. While the selectivity of the C2-C4 = products on CoFe2O4 is 6.2 %, six times higher than that on Fe2O3 (1.0 %). Also, the selectivity of C5+ products increases from 10.3 % to17.3 %."
8,Influence of the intimacy between Fe and Co on the catalytic performance,"3.3 Influence of the intimacy between Fe and Co on the catalytic performance It is worth noting that the increase of the activity on CoFe2O4 is not a simple sum of the two metals, Fe + Co. It has been generally acknowledged that the electrons in an outer core level are sensitive depending on the variation of structures, and the chemical bonds between Fe and Co can largely alter surface electronic properties [38]. Therefore, the possible electron transfers were studied by XPS analysis to confirm changes of the interactions between Co and Fe species according to the comparison the binding energies (BEs) of Fe 2p between Na-CoFe2O4 and Fe2O3. The BE of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 on Fe2O3 peaks (Fig. 2 a) locate at 710.9 eV and 724.4 eV, which correspond to the phases of Fe2O3 hematite [35]. However, the BEs of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks on Na-CoFe2O4 were observed at 710.7 eV and 724.3 eV, respectively. With respect to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 photoemission spectra in the reduced Na-CoFe2O4, the formation of a metal component was confirmed by a peak shifted to 706.6 eV and 719.7 eV (see Fig. 2 b) [39]. This suggested Fe was partially exsolved from the spinel, while the reduced Fe2O3 peaks exhibited at 706.4 eV and 719.5 eV. Evidently, the BEs of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 were changed due to intimate interaction of Fe and Co, which can be influential for the catalytic performance. Higher light olefins selectivity was obtained over CoFe2O4, while CH4 was the dominant product over Fe-Co-M, suggesting that the intimacy between Co and Fe sites is important for selective CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, compared with the case of Fe-Co-M, the Fe-Co-I catalyst with closer Fe-Co distance displays a higher CO2 conversion from 49.4% to 56.8% and a much higher selectivity of CH4 from 55.5% to 86.4%. For the CoFe2O4 catalyst, the intimacy between Co and Fe sites at the atomic scale leads to a similar catalytic activity at 56.7 % CO2conversion and a significantly suppressed selectivity of CH4 at 32.1 % and the highest C2-C4 = formation rate of 0.49 μmolC2-C4= gcat −1 s-1. Additionally, long chain hydrocarbon selectivity is high on the CoFe2O4 catalyst, while the long distance between Fe and Co sites leads to a remarkably higher selectivity of CH4 likely due to the CO2 hydrogenation on Co sites directly [16]. This also suggests that in the reduced CoFe2O4 catalyst, FeCo alloy did form, instead of the presence of separate Fe(0) and Co(0) phases. Fig. 4 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the Fe-based catalysts. Generally, the reduction of Fe2O3 in H2 goes through Fe3O4, FeO and finally to metallic iron [40]. The reduction of bare Fe2O3 starts at 300 °C, and it decreases to 280 °C after the introduction of Co (Fe-Co-M). The promoted reduction of Fe oxides by the metal Co is likely due to the fact that Co is more easily reduced thereby facilitating dissociation of hydrogen. Further decreasing the distance between Fe and Co (Fe-Co-I) can promote dissociated H2 spillover from Co to Fe. Therefore, the reduction temperature of Fe-Co-I is lower. Compared with those of Fe-Co-M and Fe-Co-I, the distance between Fe and Co in CoFe2O4 is even closer and more uniform. The reduction peaks of CoFe2O4 are shifted to higher temperatures above 500 °C, indicating the presence of stronger Co-O-Fe bonds."
9,Role of Na on the catalytic performance,"3.4 Role of Na on the catalytic performance To further increase the olefin selectivity, Na was introduced into CoFe2O4, and the resulting Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst shows excellent performance for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. As shown in the H2-TPR results in Fig. 4, the Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst shows a higher reduction temperature, and under hydrogenation conditions, the presence of Na leads to a carbon-rich and hydrogen-poor surface, which benefits the C-C coupling to form hydrocarbons. Adding alkali promoter can increase the CO2 conversion and the selectivity of light olefins, but suppressed the methanation rate on the carbide catalyst which is ascribed to the enhanced CO2 adsorption, facilitating the formation and stability of active species Fe5C2, and the inhibition in the secondary hydrogenation of olefins [41–43]. And density functional theory (DFT) results showed conspicuous promotion in the presence of alkali promoter of the adsorption and activation of CO2. Adding alkali promoter on the catalyst surface also reduces the kinetic barrier for CO2 dissociation [44]. As a result, the CH4 selectivity is 20.0 % on Na-CoFe2O4, compared with 32.1 % on the Na-free catalyst. While the selectivity of light paraffins are suppressed from 41.8 % for CoFe2O4 to 6.9 %, and the selectivity of lower olefins increased from 6.2% to 37.2%. As listed in Table 2 , the Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst shows superior performance compared with known similar catalysts in the literature. Especially, the catalyst time yield (CTY) is 7.8 μmolCO2 gcat −1 s−1, which is much higher than published data. From the TEM images of the fresh and used Na-CoFe2O4 (Fig. 5 b-1 and b-2) catalyst, the particles have grown from ∼ 10 nm to ∼ 30 nm after a 10-h test, indicating the sintering takes place during the reaction. After the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, the XRD pattern in Fig. 5a shows that the main phases of the spent Fe2O3 catalysts are Fe3O4, and the HRTEM images (Fig. 6 ) show that Co particles are present near the surfaces of Fe3O4 particles. Fe3O4 is an active phase of the RWGS reaction and could be formed through the partial oxidation of metallic Fe by the product water [45]. While, the intensity of iron carbides is hardly seen possibly because of the high dispersion. However, the χ-Fe5C2 phase could be clearly observed on the spent Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst, and χ-Fe5C2 is commonly regarded as the active species for chain growth in FTS [45]. CoFe2O4 shows only Fe3O4 and FeCo alloy phases without apparent carbide phase after the reaction, and this result highlights the critical role of the small amount of Na residue for the formation of χ-Fe5C2, consistent with previous studies. The product selectivity of Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst is plotted as a function of CO2 conversion and shown in Fig. 7 . The CH4, C2–C4 olefins and paraffins is close to zero at the CO2 conversion of 8%, but the selectivity of CO is more than 90 %. The CH4 and olefin selectivity increased drastically with the conversion, and C2-C4 paraffins increased lightly, while the C5 + selectivity increased and then decreased. And CO selectivity decreased with the conversion. Thus, hydrocarbon products would form simultaneously from hydrogenation of the produced CO, but some of these C5 + could be further cracked to lower hydrocarbons. The catalytic activity and product selectivity were plotted as a function of time on stream in Fig. 8 . It could be seen clearly that for the Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst exhibited good stability until the end of the duration test (100 h). Specifically, the selectivities of long-chain hydrocarbons and light olefins were remained stable. Thus, the present catalyst is stable and suitable for the direct conversion of CO2 to C2-C4 =. SEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping images of the fresh and spent Na-CoFe2O4 catalyst are shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that Co, Fe and O are dispersed uniformly over the Na-CoFe2O4 surface before and after reaction. C is evenly distributed over the spent catalysts, corresponding to a large amount of iron carbide after 100 h TOS, and Na can hardly be observed owing to its low content. The content of metal in the fresh and spent catalysts was determined by ICP analysis. The ICP results of the Na-CoFe2O4 (before and after reaction) are shown in Table 3 . The content of Na is very low (Na/Fe=∼0.01, mass ratio), which is consistent with the mapping results. There is no significant change in metal content before and after 100 h CO2 hydrogenation reaction, which was consistent with the results of unchanged CO2 conversion rate and product selectivity."
10,Conclusion,"In conclusion, the influence of Na, Co and intimacy between Fe and Co on the catalytic performance is demonstrated on Fe-Co-based CO2 hydrogenation catalysts. With the introduction of Co into the Fe catalyst, the CO2 conversion is significantly enhanced. The product distribution of the bimetallic Fe–Co catalyst closely depends on the intimacy between Fe and Co sites. The intimate contact between Fe and Co sites favors the production of C2-C4 =. The addition of Na promoter facilitates the generation of χ-Fe5C2 under the CO2 hydrogenation reaction conditions and thus further improves the catalytic performances. It also exhibited excellent stability during the 100 h test at 320 °C. This work provides useful insight into the catalyst design to modulate the catalytic activity and products selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation."
