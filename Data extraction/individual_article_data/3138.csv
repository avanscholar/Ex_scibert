0,Introduction,"Today, energy is an indispensable subject worldwide to enhance the global economy as well as for the survival of people. The progress and utilization of energy sources have the utmost influence on securing the sustainability of the human community [1]. However, the demand for energy has been increasing every passing day in comparison with one day before [2] because the science has been incessantly developed, the global economy has been continuously enlarged, and the population of the countries has been progressively increasing. Therefore, the energy sources, which are shown as the critical force for the countries, have to be developed in terms of higher efficiency and more power so as to boost such accomplishment [3]. Unfortunately, fossil-based fuels have accounted for 88% of world energy consumption in recent days. The shares of natural gas, coal, and oil are in the order of 24%, 29, and 35% [4]. The limited reserves of existing fossil-based fuels have prompted people to search for alternative energy sources [5]. It can be stated very clearly that one of the most substantial consumption areas for fossil-based fuels has been the transportation sector since just about all vehicles have been energized by the internal combustion engines operating with fossil-based fuels. The diesel engines have been greatly preferred in the transportation sector due to the higher efficiency of combustion, reliability, cost efficiency and adaptability. However, they are one of the most dominant contributors to harmful exhaust gas emissions [6]. The consistently increasing usage of vehicles and engines in cities has caused to become environmental pollution issues [7]. The major quantities of exhaust gas emissions have been, thus, produced and emitted by the vehicles, particularly as unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOX) inside the densely populated cities [8]. As a result, these pollutants deal with both direct and indirect damage to the health of human society and the environment [9]. Hence, the dropdown in pollutant gas emissions and the independence of energy as well have been considered as significant topics of interest by researchers all over the world. The carbon dioxide (CO2) formation within these pollutants is accepted as accountable for the greenhouse impact in the world. Meanwhile, the varieties of energy have been also necessary for the countries. Therefore, one reasonable and probable remedy is the utilization of renewable fuels with acquiring in popularity due to the lesser contrition to the carbon cycle, their sustainability as well as smaller numbers of greenhouses gases in some conditions [10]. In this context, researchers and scientists began a trend to seek different applications for mitigating fossil-based fuel consumption in the transportation sector all over the world. To this end, some of them have investigated the usage of alternative and renewable fuels in the internal combustion engines [11–13] though others have studied to make modifications to the vehicles and their engine operating conditions [14–16]. The researchers have attracted attention to focusing on decreasing the detrimental exhaust gas emissions because of the augmentation of the environmental apprehensions and awareness by people [17]. In this regard, the acknowledged view in the recent literature exhibits that the clean combustion process can be obtained and supplied by replacing providing that the reformulation of diesel fuel has been associated with the developments in engine technology [18]. Accordingly, biodiesel fuels can be taken into account as the most encouraging candidate to petroleum fuel resources because they have been regarded as renewable, sustainable and alternative fuel types for the CI engine applications [19] and they have been produced from a wide range of feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats, algae oils, microbial oils or waste cooking oils as well [20]. Even though many production techniques have been built up for the production of biodiesel like pyrolysis, transesterification, micro-emulsification, etc., transesterification is the most preferred method among all of the production processes [21]. Generally, biodiesel has a higher cetane number than that of mineral diesel fuel, and hence it causes the lesser ignition delay period which infers that the engine begins swiftly and operates smoothly [22]. As opposed to this idea, some of the researchers [23–25] have found that the cetane number of biodiesel is lower than those of limits presented in EN 14,214 (min. 51) and ASTM D6751 (min. 47) standards because of high amounts of unsaturated fatty acid contents. Besides that, it has almost no sulfur content, no aromatics and has approximately 10–12% oxygen content by weight. As compared to the conventional diesel fuel, the combustion characteristics of the biodiesel fuels are close to the diesel fuel [26]. The prior researches in the literature have generally shown that the addition of biodiesel into diesel fuel resulted in higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) [27–29] and to emitting the larger amount of NOX emissions [27–29], lesser amounts of HC emission [27–29], CO emission [27–29], CO2 emission [27,28], and particulate matter (PM) emission [30,31]. However, there are slight alterations on the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) results due to the lower energy content [32]. The high viscosity, poor low-temperature behaviors and low volatility of the biodiesel have nonetheless affected its efficiency and quality of the combustion process inside the cylinder, especially at the low-temperature conditions. Moreover, low volatility and high viscosity of the biodiesel have brought about the negative impacts on the atomization characteristics when the fuel is sprayed from the injector [33,34]. In addition, the poor low-temperature properties of the biodiesels have led to forming the crystals structure and hence solidification of the fatty acids found in the chemical bonds at the low-temperature conditions in particular [26]. The aforementioned poor characteristics of the biodiesels can be improved by the blending with the alcohols having different chain lengths since the alcohols have reasonably high oxygen content in comparison with both biodiesels and diesel fuel. Alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, etc. mostly produced biologically from biomass via fermentation process are liquid biofuels and they have been particularly exhibited as important substitutions as alternative fuel additives for both spark-ignition engines and CI engines [35,36]. The production of alcohol by fermentation process is to be more suitable in terms of cost and environmentally friendly as compared to the other production methods [37]. Over the last decades, the production and utilization of various alcohols have been researched for replacing conventional fuels for engine applications. This is mainly because of the decrease in air pollution in the world and encourages the sustainability of energy sources [38]. The short-chain alcohols (commonly called as lower alcohols) like methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) have been widely tested in the diesel engines with blending the conventional diesel fuel, biodiesel or biodiesel/diesel fuel blends [39–43]. These papers have indicated that the alcohol-treated fuel samples caused to improve CO and smoke emissions while decreasing the engine torque and increase the BSFC results. The utilization of oxygen-rich alcohols improves both the premixed combustion phase and the diffusive combustion phase [44]. Çelebi and Aydın [45] presented more information about lower alcohol fuels in diesel engine characteristics. The basic shortcomings of using the lower alcohols are lesser energy content and latent heat of evaporation. The lower heating values of the methanol and ethanol are 19.58 MJ/kg and 26.83 MJ/kg, respectively while the latent heat of evaporation values are 1162.64 kJ/kg for methanol and 918.42 kJ/kg for ethanol [46]. These features have led to getting worse engine performance as well as increase the harmful exhaust gas emissions of HC and CO. Another poor characteristic of the lower alcohol is the lesser cetane number resulting in longer ignition delay during the combustion process takes place in the diesel engine cylinder and lower combustion controllability. The length of the carbon chain is the most significant parameter that affects the cetane number directly. The CI engines need a cetane number between 45 and 60. If the cetane number of fuel declines below 38, there is a rapid increment in the ignition delay period [47]. The cetane numbers are 3–5 for methanol and 5–8 for ethanol, resulting in larger ignition delay in the cylinder while diesel fuel has the cetane number of 50 [48]. Moreover, their low flash points and high vapor pressures cause to be necessary more rigorous safety prevention in the case of fuel storage and handling. Besides, methanol and ethanol have inappropriate lubricating properties, miscibility and stability problems with the diesel fuel [49]. Consequently, the usage of lower alcohols in diesel engines as a pure diesel engine fuel is limited due to the aforementioned poor characteristics. In recent days, the researchers have noticed attention towards the utilization of the higher alcohols, as opposed to lower-chainalcohols, to replace the conventional diesel fuel because their physicochemical properties are close to those of diesel compared to the corresponding characteristics of lower alcohols. But, the definition of higher alcohol has to be made. Kumar and Saravanan [46] defined the higher alcohol as long-chain alcohol having higher molecular weight as well as carbon atoms more than three. For instance, butanol (C4H9OH), pentanol (C5H11OH), hexanol (C6H13OH), heptanol (C7H15OH), octanol (C8H17OH), decanol (C10H21OH), and up to phytol (C20H39OH) are the higher alcohols. The researches have shown that the physical and chemical properties of the higher alcohols having long-chain carbon atoms in the chemical structures found to be convenient with the CI engines. In other words, it can be indicated that the higher alcohols have the pretty potential for diesel engine applications in comparison with the lower alcohols [50]. The fact is that the higher alcohols with longer carbon chains have higher energy content, preferable blend stability with diesel fuel, i.e. phase separation is not formed, higher viscosity, higher density, better lubricity behavior, and great cetane numbers and hence the superior quality of ignition compared to the lower alcohols [51]. Another advantage of the higher alcohol is the corrosive effect. Compared to the lower alcohols, their corrosive influence on some of the engine parts such as fuel pump, delivery lines as well as fuel injector is fewer owing to their lesser water contents [46]. Moreover, the flash points of the higher alcohols having longer carbon chained are quite high, therefore, fewer safety precautions in the fuel handling and storage are necessary [52]. Considering the production of the higher alcohol, there is a less energy amount need throughout the process owing to the short breaking down process. It can be concluded that the higher alcohols possess a substantial potential to utilize in the CI engines when all the above attributes are taken into account [53]. Some of the important fuel properties of various alcohols are represented in Table 1 for comparison."
1,Botanical description and distribution of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.),"In the present study, peanut or groundnut oil was used to produce biodiesel through the transesterification method. The scientific name “Arachis hypogaea L.” belongs to the Fabaceae(legume, pea or bean) family [54]. The systematic position of the peanut is known as follows: Plantae – Plants (Kingdom), Tracheobionta – Vascular plants (Subkingdom), Spermatophyta – Seed plants (Superdivision), Magnoliophyta – Flowering plants (Division), Magnoliopsida – Dicotyledons (Class), Rosidae (Subclass), Fabales (Order), Fabaceae ⁄ Leguminosae – Pea Family (Family), Arachis L. (Genus), Arachis hypogaea L. – Peanut (Species) [55]. One of the most significant crops cultivated in the US, Turkey and worldwide is the peanut. In Turkey, peanut which is an annual crop, is mostly grown in the Mediterranean region [56]. Fig. 1 exhibits the distribution and production quantity of the peanut around the world. The peanut is an important vegetable oil source for the countries as it contains approximately 50% oil by weight [58]. This means that the peanut oil can ensure a less expensive feedstock for the production of biodiesel [56]. Its oil is obtained from the peanut kernel by different techniques such as hydraulic pressing, screw pressing, solvent extraction, and aqueous method. Some of the physical and chemical properties of the crude peanut oil are given as follows: the refractive index at 25 °C of 1.468, iodine value of 84–100, specific gravity of 0.917–0.922, and saponification value of 188–195 with less than 1% unsaponifiable matter. In addition, peanut oil is a pale yellow color and has a prominent nutty taste and odor [59]. The characteristic of the peanut oil is a non-drying and it contains oleic acid of 54.15%, linoleic acid of 27.46%, palmitic acid of 8.17%, behenic acid of 2.92%, gadoleic acid of 2.42%, stearic acid of 1.73%, and lignoceric acid of 1.83%. The other fatty acids were found to be below 1% [60]."
2,Background of the research work,"A lot of researchers have worked the engine performance, combustion and exhaust gas emissions of a CI engine operating with various types of higher alcohols. Although Campos-Fernandez et al. [61] successfullytested 30% 1-butanol/70% diesel fuel and 25% 1-pentanol/75% diesel fuel without any engine alterations; they recommended long-term durability tests before their usage as substitutes of the traditional diesel fuel. Li et al. [62] investigated the effects of pentanol addition into diesel/biodiesel blends on the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine at a fixed engine speed of 1600 rpm under different indicated mean effective pressures (0.6 MPa, 0.8 MPa, and 1.0 MPa). They observed that the ternary blends of n-pentanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel kept the actual ignition feature due to the addition of biodiesel having high ignitability. Li et al. [63] also indicated that the addition of pentanol into a diesel fuel exhibited high premixed combustion stability and caused to a medium and consecutive heat release profile with elevated knock resistance than corresponding values of the traditional diesel fuel. Yang et al. [64] compared the carbonyl compound emission patterns including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, etc. from a generator coupled with am diesel engine fueled with n-butanol/waste cooking oil biodiesel/diesel fuel blends. Overall, the test results showed that 10% butanol/40% biodiesel/50% diesel fuel blend was recommended in terms of an environmentally acceptable ratio used in the diesel engine generator set. Imdadul et al. [65] studied the performance, emission, and combustion behavior of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, direct-injection (DI) diesel engine running on 10%, 15%, and 20% pentanol and Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel blends at various engine speeds (1200 rpm, 1500 rpm, 1800 rpm, 2100 rpm, and 2400 rpm). They concluded that pentanol is a promising and alternative biofuel, which exhibited a substantial enhancement in the engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics out of any engine modification when mixed with neat biodiesel fuel. Imdadul et al. [66] worked the engine performance and exhaust emissions of diesel–Alexandrian laurel oil biodiesel blends with mixing 15% and 20% of n-butanol and pentanol by volume. They concluded that pentanol blended fuel samples exhibited better diesel engine characteristics than that of n-butanol blends. Mo et al. [67] monitored the spray and atomization features of the pure soybean oil biodiesel fuel and 20% n-butanol/80% diesel fuel blend in a common-rail fuel injection system. The experimental results revealed that the reduction observed in the total droplet number slightly from the spray centerline to the spray periphery because the addition of n-butanol led to deploying the droplets more equally. They also obtained the butanol blending caused to becoming a smaller Sauter Mean Diameter owing to the lower viscosity and surface tension of the blend. Yilmaz and Davis [68] scrutinized the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in a CI engine operating with diesel, fry oil biodiesel and biodiesel/n-butanol blends. They found that the addition of more than 20% n-butanol to biodiesel increased the toxicity of PAH emission. Yilmaz and Atmanli [69] experimentally evaluated of a diesel engine fueled with the blend of diesel and pentanol as a next-generation higher alcohol. On the contrary of the many researchers, they recommended 5% pentanol addition as an appropriate percentage considering the performance and emission outcomes. Ramakrishnan et al. [70] used n-pentanol as an oxygenated additive to Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel at 10%, 15%, and 20% by volume. The nitrogen monoxide (NO) and CO2 emissions of n-pentanol/biodiesel blends were found to be higher than those corresponding values of 20% biodiesel/80% diesel fuel blend and neat diesel fuel while the CO, HC, and smoke emissions were reduced. Meanwhile, the addition of n-pentanol into biodiesel fuel caused to improve the combustion characteristics of the diesel engine. Zheng et al. [71] performed an experimental research to understand the difference between the two combustion modes on the combustion and emissions of n-butanol/biodiesel at various exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratios (0%, 30%, and 50%), alcohol percentages (20%, 50%, and 80%), injection timings and engine loads (low, medium, and high). The above literature survey demonstrated that butanol and pentanol have been widely reported as higher alcohol types in diesel engines at different percentages. Soloiu et al. [72] investigated the n-butanol with port fuel injection (PFI) and peanut oil biodiesel with DI to achieve low-temperature combustion (LTC) for reducing the emission levels idling in a CI engine. The researchers found that the utilization of n-butanol and peanut oil biodiesel with different injection systems resulted in low-temperature combustion leading to drop both NOX emission by 74% and soot emission by 98% at the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) of 3 bar out of exhaust after-treatment process. They concluded based on the experimental findings that the n-butanol/peanut oil biodiesel blends could be suitable alternative fuel in terms of reduction of emissions. Soloiu et al. [73] tested a DI diesel engine running on the biodiesel supplementing with n-butanol PFI under several IMEPs of 1–5 bars at 1400 rpm for attaining concomitantly decline in the formation of NOX and soot emissions in the cylinder along with affirmative modify their trade-off. They highlighted according to the results that n-butanol PFI could be an influential method to reach concurrently dropping soot and NOX emission emitted from the tested engine for chosen regions on the map of the engine. Soloiu et al. [74] elaborately studied the LTC by identifying an 80% (by mass) proportion of n-butanol in the mode of the reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI). In their trials, a 60% ratio of n-butanol was injected thanks to the PFI system and the additional 20% was injected directly via a mixture of n-butanol with Fischer-Tropsch gas to liquid synthetic paraffinic kerosene or ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel as reference. The RCCI mode prolonged the ignition delay and augmented the maximum heat release rates because of the extended mixing duration as well as reactivity stratification, inspiring faster flame speeds. Besides, the n-butanol raised the ringing intensity by 85% towards conventional diesel combustion and further RCCI regime with LTC declined NOX along with soot emissions by 90%. Soloiu et al. [75] reported that butanol having four carbon atoms in its chemical bond commences to auto-ignite and is burned out owing to the diesel injection ensuring a two-stage heat release with 40% PFI and late DI timing near the top dead center. Interesting and informative research conducted by Soloiu et al. [76] who investigated the LTC analysis of premixed charge CI operating with n-butanol and cottonseed oil biodiesel against the characteristics of combustion and emissions of binary blends of the above-mentioned fuels. The cooling impact of the alcohol throughout the formation of the mixture along with the spray development augmented the delay of the ignition for binary mixtures. With the premixed charge CI mode, the reductions in NOX and soot emission were noticed simultaneously in comparison with the diesel fuel combustion owing to the excessive amount of oxygen content in both n-butanol and biodiesel. Soloiu et al. [77] meticulously worked RCCI combustion and emissions using methyl oleate and n-butanol and they obtained that the NOX and soot emissions drew close near-zero grades in RCCO mode under low load condition and the ringing intensity reduced by 70% for methyl oleate RCCI because of the stratified high reactivity. Soloiu et al. [78] evaluated the peanut oil fatty acid methyl ester and its blends with ultra-low sulfur diesel in terms of sprays, combustion, and emissions when it was used in an indirect injection diesel engine. The researchers were to be noted that the highest instantaneous cylinder temperature approached approximately 2100 K while the overall heat flux was found to be at 1.95 MW/m2, and also there was a 7% mean increment in the BSFC for 50% methyl ester + %50 diesel fuel blend. Soloiu et al. [79] investigated the effect of peanut fatty acid methyl ester blends on the combustion behavior of an indirect injection diesel engine. They measured some important fuel characteristics of the alternative fuel which showed the utilization of peanut oil biodiesel in the CI engine practices. The experimental results exhibited that peanut fatty acidmethyl ester can be a viable selection when mixed with diesel fuel to satisfy the standards so as to decline the emissions and dependency on foreign energy. Hogan et al. [80] performed an economic feasibility work concerning the peanut-based biodiesel fuel production in Georgia. Soloiu et al. [81] researched the performance of an indirect injection engine operating with the fatty acid methyl esters synthesized from cotton seeds oils at 2400 rpm with different loads of 4.2–6.3 IMEP and compared with the reference diesel fuel. The researchers indicated that up to 50% (by mass) cottonseed oil biodiesel in diesel fuel could be powerful at keeping the performance and efficiency of a small diesel engine. There is a pronounced deficiency in the current literature that is paid attention to the investigation of the effects of higher alcohol, having more than 6 carbon atoms, with the diesel, biodiesel or diesel/biodiesel blends on the engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics of a CI engine. One of the most significant higher alcohols is heptanol at the point of the physicochemical properties. Heptanol is longer chain alcohol as compared to the butanol and pentanol. The physical and chemical properties of the heptanol show similarity with the characteristics of the petroleum-based diesel fuel [82]. As far as the author knows that, however, a limited number of investigations have been reported in the literature regarding the effect of heptanol blended fuel types on the fuel properties, engine performance, combustion characteristics, and harmful exhaust emissions of the CI engine. Some of the significant studies will be summarized in the following paragraph in order to better understand the influence of the fuel blends on the engine characteristics. Sastry and Valand [83] measured the viscosity and density values of heptane + 1-pentanol, +1-hexanol, +1-heptanol, +1-octanol, +1-decanol, and + 1-dodecanolat 298.15 K and 308.15 K and modeled the mixture viscosity with various semi-empirical equations like Grunberg − Nissan, Heric, McAllister, and Auslander. Xiao et al. [84] studied the influences of aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenates on diesel engine emissions. There was no considerable impact of the heptanol/diesel blends on the smoke emissions. Additionally, the heptanol/diesel blends caused being reduction in the NOX emissions as compared to that of conventional diesel fuel. This was mainly due to the lower oxygen content of the heptanol for generating the unimportant effect on the HC and smoke emissions. Chunhuaet al. [85] examined the explosion and combustion behavior of micro-emulsified diesel with different surfactants (monoethanolamine, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, heptanol, octanol, and decanol). They obtained that according to the improvements for the fire-resistant capabilities of micro-emulsified diesel was found to be as follows: n-octanol > n-decanol > hexanol > pentanol > n-heptanol. Kumar and Saravanan [46] reviewed the usage of the higher alcohols in diesel engines. They concluded that heptanol was preferred in small proportions by volume with diesel to stabilize the short-chain alcohol/diesel fuel blends in the CI engines and further investigations have to be required to evaluate heptanol in higher percentages with the conventional diesel fuel. Preuβ et al. [86] investigated the influences of various long-chain alcohols such as n-octanol, 2-ethyl-hexanol, 2-propyl-heptanol, and n-decanol with hydro-treated vegetable oil, rapeseed oil biodiesel and fossil-based diesel fuel on the engine performance and emission properties of a diesel engine. The findings revealed that the CO end soot emissions for the ternary blends of alcohol/diesel/biodiesel were remarkably reduced by 47% and 40% respectively as compared to that of diesel fuel. Devarajan et al. [82] examined the effects of n-heptanol/mustard oil biodiesel at varying proportions on the performance and exhaust emission characteristics of an 1800 rpm constant speed immobile diesel engine under different engine loads (0–100%). The experimental results exhibited that the increasing amount of n-heptanol in the fuel blend caused remarkable reductions in HC, CO, NOX, and smoke emissions as compared to the neat mustard oil biodiesel. Furthermore, 20% n-heptanol addition into biodiesel led to a decrease in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) up to 0.19 kg/kWh while an increase in the BTE by 1.7% when compared to the biodiesel. However, both of the performance parameters obtained lower than the corresponding diesel outcomes at all engine loads. It can be concluded that there is a lot of subjects respecting the effect of heptanol/diesel and heptanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel blends on the performance, combustion, and exhaust gas emission characteristics of a diesel engine have not been investigated yet to the author’s knowledge. Nour et al. [38] compared the effects of butanol/diesel, heptanol/diesel, octanol/diesel fuel blends of 10% and 20% v/v on the diesel engine combustion characteristics, exhaust emissions, and mechanical performance under different engine loads (0%, 25%, 50% and 75% of the full load) and engine speeds (900 rpm and 1500 rpm). The experimental outcomes revealed that BSFC and BTE were increased just about for all tested fuel blends. As the ignition delay period of the fuel samples rose with the usage of higher alcohol/diesel fuel blends, the highest results were obtained by butanol/diesel blends. 20% heptanol/80% diesel fuel blend exhibited the maximum cumulative apparent heat release rate. The NOX and smoke emissions were decreased while the CO and HC emissions were boosted for all tested fuel samples in comparison with the corresponding values for the unmodified diesel fuel. El-Seesy et al. [87] performed a common rail diesel engine and a rapid compression-expansion machine operating with n-heptanol/diesel fuel blends with different nanomaterial additives like graphene oxide, graphene nanoplatelets, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. They found that there was a considerable improvement in the temperature of flame with the help of the carbon nanomaterials addition. Overall, the addition of 20% n-heptanol into diesel fuel was observed as the most appropriate blending ration for the applications. In the recent study, El-Seesy et al. [88] researched the combustion and exhaust gas emission characteristics of a rapid compression-expansion machine fueled with n-heptanol/methyl oleate biodiesel blends. Although they blended n-heptanol with biodiesel up to 40% by volume, 20% n-heptanol/80% biodiesel blend was recommended to be the most suitable blending ratio based on the experimental outcomes."
3,The objective of the present study,"In the light of the above-mentioned pieces of literature review, it is obvious that a great gap consists for the performance, combustion behavior, and environmental characteristics of the diesel engines operating with 1-heptanol blends, especially with low mixing proportions, i.e., up to 20% of 1-heptanol on a volume basis. To the best of the author’s knowledge that the present experimental research is the pioneer in the field since 1- heptanol blended peanut oil biodiesel-diesel fuel blends have not been tried in the CI engines to achieve the performance, emissions and combustion characteristics at different engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and full load) and a fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm conditions. The novelty of the present experimental study is to close this gap by studying the comprehensive assessments of engine performance indicators (brake specific fuel consumption, brake specific energy consumption, exhaust gas temperature), exhaust emissions (CO, CO2, HC, O2, and NOX emissions), and combustion characteristics (in-cylinder pressure, apparent heat release rate, cumulative heat release rate, rate of pressure rise, ignition delay) of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, DI diesel engine fueled with diesel fuel, neat peanut oil biodiesel, diesel/1-heptanol, diesel/peanut oil biodiesel, and diesel/peanut oil biodiesel/1-heptanol blends. The lower concentrations of 1-heptanol were suggested in the present work because of a few grounds and these are explained as follows: initially, a little amount of 1-heptanol (20% by volume) could be blended with diesel devoid of any modifications on the engine. In other words, there is no need for any additional costs in order to modify the engines as well as their concerned sectors. In the second place, the cost of 1-heptanol is still larger and has less production capacity than that of conventional diesel fuel. The outcomes of 1-heptanol blends were compared with those of higher alcohol blended fuel types and discussed in detail."
4,Materials and methods,The present experimental examination has made use of biodiesel fuel produced from peanut oil along with 1-heptanol as an oxygenated fuel additive to the diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend. According to the convenience of the appropriate the materials were supplied and the necessary investigations were accomplished. A possible and suitable methodology was acknowledged to explore the prepared fuel samples for further study.
5,Materials,"5.1 Materials In the current study, peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) oil was selected as a prime source for the synthesis of an alternative fuel through the transesterification process and it was purchased from a local company in which located in Osmaniye, Turkey. The traditional petroleum-based diesel fuel was used as a reference fuel for the comparison of the experimental findings. The diesel fuel is commercially available in hand and procured from a local petroleum station in Yozgat, Turkey. The fuel properties of the conventional diesel fuel meet the EN 590 standard which they have been confirmed from the company. It can be indicated that the material and reagents have been picked based on the availability and ease of procuration. The methanol (99.8% purity) as a short-chain alcohol and potassium hydroxide (KOH) pellets (>90% purity) as a homogeneous base catalyst were employed and provided from Isolab (Wertheim, Germany) and Tekkim Laboratory Chemicals (Bursa, Turkey). Ethanol (>99.5% purity) and reference standards of the fatty acid methyl esters (>99% purity) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). KOH solution (0.1 N), phenolphthalein indicator, and diethyl ether were utilized to measure the free fatty acid (FFA) content and acid value of the samples. The first two of them were supplied from Norateks Chemical Company (Istanbul, Turkey) while the last one was also procured from Isolab (Wertheim, Germany). Finally, 1-heptanol (98% purity), seven-carbon straight-chain alcohol, was used as an oxygenated fuel additive and it was received from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The qualitative filter paper (125 mm) was bought from S&H Labware (Ankara, Turkey). All of the chemical materials were employed with the initial form, i.e., due to their analytical reagent grade, any further purification was not implemented to the reagents by the author. The distilled water for use in the washing process was supplied by using Millipore brand Direct-Q 8UV model device."
6,Methods,"5.2 Methods The tested fuel samples have been affected in two stages so as to carry out the present work. Primarily, peanut oil has been exposed to the transesterification process to obtain biodiesel. Secondly, the binary fuel blends (peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel and 1-heptanol/diesel fuel), and a ternary blend (1-heptanol/peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel) have been prepared. In there, 1-heptanol has been chosen as a next-generation oxygenated fuel additive. The biodiesel (methyl ester) production and tested fuel preparation methods have been introduced in the following subsections step by step. 5.2.1 The production of peanut oil biodiesel The production of biodiesel from peanut oil was executed through the transesterification technique in a laboratory-scale biodiesel processor at which is found in the Biofuel Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yozgat Bozok University (Yozgat, Turkey). The peanut oil was subjected to the filtration thanks to the cloth filter to remove the suspended large and non-soluble particulates that remained from the extraction processes. The temperature of the peanut oil was, then, increased up to 120 °C for approximately 2 h to evaporate the excess water in the oil. Prior to starting the production of biodiesel, there is also a need to determine the FFA content of the peanut oil. This is because of that one of the most considerable characteristics for selecting the step number of the transesterification process is the FFA of the feedstock. For this reason, the acid-base titration method was applied to find the FFA of the peanut oil. In order to determine the FFA, 5 g of procured peanut oil was put in an empty glass beaker and 50 mL of 50% diethyl ether/50% ethanol mixture was charged on the sample. Afterward, a few drops of phenolphthalein was added to the mixture as an indicator. The solution was stirred with the assistance of the hot plate magnetic stirrer (Scilogex brand MS7-H550-Pro model) without heating for a few minutes. Then, 0.1 N potassium hydroxide solution was poured in a burette and the titration process was begun by allowing drop by drop from a burette to the glass beaker with the help of a drainage valve of the burette. Until a permanent pink color was noticed in the glass beaker, the process was in progress. After the pink color was observed, the titration was completed and the corresponding quantity of the burette solution was noted. This measurement was repeated three times to achieve the exact results for the measurement of the FFA and acid value of the samples. The FFA and acid value of the feedstock were calculated using the following equations [89]: (1) FFA = v - b x N x 28.2 w (2) Acidvalue = 1.989 x F F A where, v: volume in mL of the titration solution, b: volume in mL of the blank, N: normality of the titration solution, w: weight of the sample of oil in grams used for measurement of these properties. According to the titration process, the FFA of the peanut oil was found to be at 0.74% and the measured value was lesser than the recommended limit of 1% [90,91]. Based on Equation 2, the acid value of the peanut oil was measured as 1.47 mg KOH/g which is reasonably low and it is appropriate for the production of biodiesel. As a result, the peanut oil was subjected to the respective methyl ester transformation performing the single-step transesterification process or base esterification process, and hence, the reduction would be expected in the viscosity of the peanut oil at the end of the reaction. Accordingly, the details of the biodiesel production procedure from peanut oil have been effectuated as presented underneath. In the single-stage transesterification process, the peanut oil was reacted with using KOH as an alkali catalyst for reducing the unsaturated fatty acid content in the biodiesel. To observe the behavior of the reaction conditions on the yield of the peanut oil biodiesel and to obtain the accurate reaction parameters, the transesterification process was repeated several times changing the reaction conditions like reaction duration, methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration. The experimental trials showed that the optimum reaction conditions for the production of the peanut oil biodiesel were summarized as follows: methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, reaction duration of 60 min, and catalyst concentration of 0.75 wt%. On the other hand, the reaction temperature was also considered as 60 °C because of the boiling point of the used alcohol (the boiling point of methanol is 64.7 °C). First of all, the crude peanut oil was charged into the three-neck flat bottom flask and heated previously. During the transesterification process, a reflux condenser unit with the required water supply was mounted on the flask to avoid the evaporation of the solution. Initially, 0.75% by weight of KOH was gaged and shuffled with methanol by the methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 for providing the mixture homogeneity for 15 min at room temperature to escape the alcohol evaporation. Followed by, the mixture of catalyst and alcohol was transferred into the heated peanut oil. When the temperature was reached to the desired value of 60 °C, the reaction was commenced for 60 min continuously. The reaction was in progress at a fixed stirring speed of 600 rpm. This process was called the reaction stage. After the reaction was finished, the mixture was settled to a separation funnel and rested without interruption for 8 h to subside the glycerol phase. After 8 h, two distinct layers were appeared in the separation funnel due to the difference of the density values and this step was also named as a separation stage. The down layer (glycerol) was taken with the help of a drainage valve and the upper layer was put in a clean glass beaker. The temperature of the resultant biodiesel was risen to 75 °C and maintained at this temperature to evaporate the excess amount of the alcohol in the biodiesel. Following by, the product was refilled into the separation funnel and waited for reducing the temperature until 55 °C. Next, the obtained product was washed with warm distilled water three times at various periods. This process was termed as the washing stage. The washing biodiesel was kept waiting approximately 12 h to sink the waste-water. To obtain the pure ester, the upper part of the mixture was heated up to 120 °C to deport the presence of the water molecules in the biodiesel for 2 h. This step was called as drying stage. The biodiesel was stored in a glass bottle at the dark medium in the laboratory conditions to recognition and further investigations. Eventually, the produced fuel was designated as peanut oil biodiesel (POB) or peanut oil methyl ester. Fig. 2 illustrates the production stages of the peanut oil biodiesel. 5.2.2 Analysis of the fatty acid composition The fatty acid profiles of the peanut oil and its biodiesel were analyzed by using Agilent (Santa Clara, California, USA) brand 7890A model Gas Chromatograph (GC) 5975C MSD system. The analysis conditions were implemented as follows: after the sample (2 μL) was injected, the temperature was augmented up to 70 °C for 1 min at the beginning of the process. Then 120 °C at 20 °C/min (held for 2 min), 180 °C at 10 °C/min (held for 3 min), and finally 240 °C at 5 °C/min (held for 10 min). The other conditions are adjusted as the injector temperature-250 °C, split ratio (50:1), carrier gas (helium), column flow rate (1.28 mL/min), and ionization mode used at electronic impact (70 eV). The composition of the peanut oil and obtained peanut oil biodiesel is listed in Table 2 . The GC analysis graphs were also illustrated in Supplementary data file A. 5.2.3 Physicochemical properties of peanut oil and its biodiesel The principal physical and chemical characteristics of peanut oil and its obtained biodiesel product under the optimized reaction conditions of the transesterification reaction method were analyzed following the global biodiesel standards of EN 14,214 and ASTM D6751 specifications. Group I metals (Na + K) and Group II metals (Ca + Mg) (EN 14538), phosphorous content (EN 14107), density (EN ISO 3675), polyunsaturated (≥4 double bonds) methyl esters (EN 15779), linolenic acid methyl ester (EN 14103), cloud point (ASTM D2500), pour point (ASTM D97), copper strip corrosion (EN ISO 2160), ash content (EN ISO 3987), flash point (ASTM D93), acid value (ASTM D664), pH, etc. were measured based on the cited standards. The saponification number, iodine value, cetane number, oxidation stability, kinematic viscosity, and higher heating value were calculated with the following equations as per the recommended by several authors [23,92-96]. The acid value and FFA content were measured with the help of a suitable acid-base titration technique with KOH solution and the phenolphthalein indicator and they can be calculated using the above-mentioned Equation 1 and Equation 2, respectively. The degree of unsaturation (DU) was found using the following empirical equations: (3) DU = m o n o u n s a t u r a t e d C n : 1 , w t . % + 2 p o l y u n s a t u r a t e d C n : 2 , w t . % + 3 p o l y u n s a t u r a t e d C n : 3 , w t . % Long-chain saturated factor (LCSF) can be predicted from the amount of the saturated fatty acids and their melting points (MPn) by using Equation 4: (4) LCSF = ∑ MP n x C n 100 The saponification number (SN), iodine value (IV), cetane number (CN), oxidation stability (OS), kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, and higher heating value (HHV) of the peanut oil biodiesel can be calculated as given the following formulas: (5) SN = ∑ 560 x A i MW i (6) IV = ∑ ( 254 x D x A i ) / MW i (7) CN = 46.3 + 5458 SN - 0.225 I V (8) OS = - 0.0518 D U + 11.121 (9) ln η i = - 12.503 + 2.496 × ln ( MW i ) - 0.178 × N s (10) HHV = 49.43 - [ 0.041 S N + 0.015 I V ] where, Ai: the proportions of each component in the fatty acids, MWi: the molecular mass of each component in the fatty acids, D: the number of double bonds in the fatty acids, η i : the kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, Ns: the number of double bonds in the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Finally, the molecular weight (MW) of the peanut oil was calculated using Equation 11 as given below: (11) MW = 3 ∗ A M W FA + w e i g h t o f g l y c e r o l b a c k b o n e where, AMWFA: the average molecular weight of all fatty acids. A sample calculation of the above-mentioned fuel characteristics of the peanut oil biodiesel is represented in the Appendix A. 5.2.4 Preparation of the tested fuels In the present experimental work, commercially available diesel fuel, peanut oil biodiesel, and 1-heptanol have been used to obtain the all tested fuel samples. Some of the important physical and chemical properties of diesel fuel, peanut oil biodiesel and 1-heptanol were presented in Table 3 . For this purpose, two binary blends (peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel and 1-heptanol/diesel fuel) and one ternary blend (1-heptanol/peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel) have been prepared by using splashing method on a volume basis building in fixed percentages of peanut oil biodiesel and 1-heptanol keeping a constant concentrations of 20% each of them. 1-heptanol, which has 7 carbon atoms in the molecular structure, has been chosen as an oxygenated additive. Initially, 20% of peanut oil biodiesel and 80% of diesel fuel, and 20% of 1-heptanol and 80% of diesel fuel have been blended by volume for the sake of acquiring two binary blends, respectively. For the preparation of a ternary blend, the fraction of conventional diesel fuel has been decreased by 20%. Afterward, for completing the remaining part of the blend, 1-heptanol has been added into a binary blend of a peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel at a concentration of 20% on a volume basis. The conventional diesel fuel termed D100 was tested as a reference fuel to acquire the basic data. The produced peanut oil biodiesel was named as B100. In the fuel blend preparation, the aforementioned amount of test fuels for each sample was mixed thanks to a calibrated beaker with the accuracy of ± 0.5 mL to get the exact blending ratios. Generally, the abbreviations of the binary and ternary fuel blends were named as DxBy, DxHpz, and DxByHpz where ×, y, and z have referred to the fractions of diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, and 1-heptanol, respectively of overall volume while D, B, and Hp have intended to the diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, and 1-heptanol, respectively. For the easy presentation, on the other hand, D was removed and only By, Hpz, and ByHpz were used in the present investigation. In this context, the abbreviations and blending percentages of all the tested fuels used in this present study have been tabulated in Table 4 . All of the tested fuel samples have been one after another prepared and stored in a sealed glass bottle in the dark medium under the laboratory conditions for one-week to observe whether the phase separation problems are or not. After the one-week duration, there was no phase separation in the blends. All of the test fuels were more than enough consistent at the ambient status. However, before the engine testing, all of the tested fuel samples were stirred in the fuel tank to remove any separation of phase as prevention. The physical appearance of peanut oil biodiesel, diesel fuel, 1-heptanol, binary blends (B20 and Hp20), and a ternary blend (B20Hp20) has been given in Fig. 3 . 5.2.5 Prediction of some physicochemical properties of tested fuel blends Some of the significant physicochemical characteristics of all the binary and ternary blends were estimated with the help of Kay’s mixing rule and Arrhenius type mixing rule represented by Gokdogan et al. [97]. Mathematically, Kay’s mixing rule and Arrhenius type mixing rule can be expressed in the form of: (12a) y = ∑ i n x i φ i (12b) l n η b = ∑ i n x i l n η i where, x: fraction of the component, y: the predicted value, φ : corresponding property, η: kinematic viscosity. The predicted fuel properties of the fuel blends were shown in Table 5 . It can be noticed from Table 5 that, the addition of 1-heptanol into the diesel fuel and peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel blend has caused to reduce some properties such as kinematic viscosity, density, cetane number, and energy content. But, all of the fuel samples could be tried as alternative candidates in the CI engine applications. This is mainly because of the similar cetane number of the fuel samples to the unmodified diesel fuel. 5.2.6 Experimental set-up The engine performance, exhaust gas emissions, and combustion characteristics for the prepared fuel blends were carried out on the engine test rig placing in Automotive Laboratory, Technical Sciences Vocational School Automotive Program, Ondokuz Mayıs University, Samsun, Turkey. The engine tests were conducted on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, naturally-aspirated, water-cooled multi-fuel research engine manufactured by Kirloskar oil engines Ltd. in India. The bore and stroke of this engine were 87.5 mm and 110 mm, respectively. The technical specifications of the test engine were presented in Table 6 . An eddy current dynamometer with water-cooled (Baturalp Taylan brand) was mounted to the engine crankshaft and used as an engine loading unit to vary the engine loads. The measurement of the engine fuel consumption was performed by noting the time taken for 100 mL of fuel consumption thanks to the standard burette assembly. The intake air flow rate was deciphered with the help of a standard air tank framework having an orifice meter and a manometer device. A K-type thermocouple was installed to determine the exhaust gas temperature. The present experimental work was also occupied with analyzing of combustion inside the cylinder which has been arranged by the pressure transducer (PCB Piezotronics brand S111A22 model) having a measurement range of 5000 psi with the sensitivity of 1.0 mV/psi with low noise cable and a Kubler brand 8.KIS40.1361.0360 model crank angle encoder with a top dead center pulse was utilized. The resolution of this device is supplied from the manufacturer by 1°. The other technical properties of the encoder are given as follows: Clamping/Synchro flange, 6 mm × 12.5 mm shaft, IP64 Logic level: RS422; Supply = 5 V DC Square wave O/P: A, A’, B, B’, 0, 0′ Incr/turn: 360 PPR, Termination: 2 m long axial cable, Speed 5500 rpm. The obtained in-cylinder pressure and crack angle data were collected to supply the heat release rate and ignition delay period parameters thanks to a National Instrument brand NI USB-6210 brand data acquisition device for all of the tested fuels. The exhaust gas emissions such as CO, CO, HC, O2, and NOX were detected by using a K-Test brand exhaust gas analyzer in percentage and also in ppm. After finishing the experiments, the measured emissions were transformed into g/kWh according to the standard procedure. The mentioned relations have been also presented as follows [98]: (13) EP i = EV i , d x M i M exh , d x m Exh , d P eff = EV i , w x M i M exh , w x m Exh , w P eff The empirical constants, i.e., kd and kw, of the equations have been taken into consideration as below: (14) k d = m Exh , d P eff = 3.873 g kWh (15) k w = m Exh , w P eff = 4.160 g kWh Considering the aforementioned constants, Equation (16) and Equation (17) were obtained. (16) EP i , d g kWh = EV i , d ( p p m ) 1 x 10 6 x M i 30.21 g mol x 3873 g kWh (17) EP i , w g kWh = EV i , w ( p p m ) 1 x 10 6 x M i 28.84 g mol x 4160 g kWh As a consequence, Equations (18–22) can be used to predict the corresponding exhaust gas emission outcomes. The general conversion of exhaust gas emissions from ppm or vol. % to g/kWh is represented as follows [2]: (18) C O g kWh = 3.591 x 10 - 3 x C O p p m (19) NO X g kWh = 6.636 x 10 - 3 x NO X p p m (20) H C g kWh = 2.002 x 10 - 3 x H C p p m (21) O 2 g kWh = 41.024 x O 2 v o l % (22) CO 2 g kWh = 63.470 x CO 2 v o l % The analyzer ensured the HC measurement range of between 0 and 4000 ppm with a resolution of 1 ppm, CO measurement range of between 0 and 10 vol% with a resolution of 0.001 vol%, CO2 measurement range of between 0 and 20 vol% with a resolution of 0.01 vol%, O2 measurement range of between 0 and 25 vol% with a resolution of 0.01 vol%, and lastly NOX emission measurement range of between 0 and 4000 ppm with a resolution of 1 ppm. Software-based performance assessments have been conducted, and hence figures have been generated from the analysis. The data acquired according to the experimental work have been stored in order to further evaluation of the engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion behavior of the aforementioned fuel tested fuel samples. The exhaust gas was directly discharged into a stainless steel tailpipe out of any dilution process. The schematic layout and pictorial view of the engine test setup were illustrated in Fig. 4 . 5.2.7 Test methodology First of all, the calibrations of the used apparatus have been provided prior to the commencement of the engine trials. The pre-tests have been then performed to observe the operating conditions of the tested engine. Afterward, the duration of the engine stabilization has been perceived and hence the engine has been stabilized for all the tested fuel samples. The main tests were begun after all shortcomings encountered during the pre-tests had been removed. The ambient temperature and relative humidity were measured as 20–22 °C and 59–65% throughout the trials. The conventional diesel fuel has experimented as a reference fuel. The engine performance, exhaust gas emissions and combustion behavior of the CI engine running on the tested fuel samples have been accomplished at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% engine load and a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. The brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) values (in the bar) corresponding to the engine loads (in percentage) were represented in Table 7 to better understanding the engine operating conditions. The in-cylinder pressure of the diesel engine has been recorded in each working cycle up to 720° crank angle for each 1° crank angle intervals under all engine loads as mentioned above. Besides, the average in-cylinder pressures of all the tested fuels have been taken into consideration after implementing a suitable filtering method for at least 50 cycles. Lab view based Engine Performance Analysis software package “Engine soft” has been used for the engine performance and combustion evaluation. Also, each trial has been performed thrice to achieve accurate results. The increment in the internal energy throughout the combustion process takes place inside the engine cylinder and the apparent heat release rate (HRR) values that transform the mechanical work corresponding to the crank angle were calculated using Equation 23 with regard to the first law of thermodynamics [88]. (23) dQ net d θ = γ γ - 1 P dV d θ + 1 γ - 1 V dP d θ The cumulative heat release can be defined as the integral of heat release over a restricted CA interval. The cumulative heat release values for the tested fuel specimens were computes using the following equation [99]: (24) Q cum = ∫ Q net = ∫ P γ γ - 1 dV d θ + V 1 γ - 1 dP d θ where, • Qnet (J): energy amount passing through the cylinder wall and combustion chamber wall at the end of combustion, • Qcum (J): cumulative heat release • θ (o): crank angle, • γ: specific heat ratio, • P (Pa): in-cylinder pressure, • V (m3): cylinder volume. The start of combustion (SOC) corresponds to the point where the HRR diagram crosses over the zero transition [100]. The start of injection (SOI) can be found like the crank angle (CA) at which the injector opens. The ignition delay (ID) period is the difference between SOI and SOC. The ringing intensity (RI), also called as the ringing index, was adopted from Soloiu et al. [74,77] and RI for the tested fuels n this experimentation was calculated considering the Equation 25 so as to appraise the inclination of the knock for the tested engine [99]. Although RI has been thoroughly acknowledged as the key factor to observe the knock in the homogenous charge compression-ignition engines, it has been performed for the DI diesel engine by Wei et al. [101]. A numerical derivative technique is then implemented to the filtered pressure data for detecting the maximum rate of the pressure rise. The major benefit of the RI equation is mentioned that it may be smoothly evaluated to measure the knock in the simulation of the engine since some models cannot get high-frequency oscillations [102]. (25) RI = 1 2 γ β dP dt max 2 P max γ R T max where, • d P d t m a x : maximum pressure rise rate, • P m a x : maximum in-cylinder pressure, • T m a x : maximum in-cylinder gas temperature, • R : gas constant, • β : a correlation constant. (Although it is fixed value determined from engine geometry, commonly 0.05 ms [102] has been used in the calculations) 5.2.8 Uncertainty analysis It is to be noted that the present experimental work included errors and uncertainties which have been caused because of the test apparatus accuracies, indigenous conditions, regulations, sensation blunder and so on. On this basis, in this paper, the square root technique that was recommended by Holman [103] was implemented to the engine trails so as to calculate the uncertainties. The equation was given underneath. (26) w R = ∂ R ∂ x 1 w 1 2 + ∂ R ∂ x 2 w 2 2 + ⋯ + ∂ R ∂ x n w n 2 1 / 2 where, • R: dependent factor and it is a function of independent variables, • x1, x2, x3,…, xn: independent variables, • wR: uncertainty value of the results, • w1, w2, …, wn: uncertainties of the independent variables. The uncertainty analysis of the engine parameters like brake power, mass of fuel consumption, brake specific fuel consumption, brake specific energy consumption, and brake thermal efficiency examples are ensured in Appendix B. The uncertainties of the measured and calculated parameters according to the Equation 26 were tabulated in Table 8 . As a consequence, the overall uncertainity of the present experimental stuy can ben calculated as follow: (27) Overalluncertainity = S q u a r e r o o t o f u n c e r t a i n i t y o f M F C 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f B T E 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f B P 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f C O 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f NO X 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f H C 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f O 2 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f CO 2 2 + u n c e r t a i n i t y o f E G T 2 (28) = S q u a r e r o o t o f 1.554 2 + 1.764 2 + 0.836 2 + 1.027 2 + 0.839 2 + 1.479 2 + 0.838 2 + 0.909 2 + 1 2 (29) = 3.564 %"
7,Results and discussions,"The engine performance, exhaust gas emissions, and combustion characteristics for all tested fuel samples (diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and B100) have been extracted at various engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and full load). The experimental findings have been compared with traditional diesel fuel and pure peanut oil biodiesel in terms of a better understanding of the effects of the addition of 1-heptanol in diesel fuel or biodiesel/diesel fuel blend."
8,Combustion characteristics,"6.1 Combustion characteristics In this section, the combustion characteristics of an unmodified diesel engine operating with diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, and B20Hp20 blends have monitored at various engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and full load) to figure out the processes and mechanisms of the reactions occurrence in the engine combustion chamber at which the fuel samples were burned for effectuating heat energy which depending on particularly the intermolecular structures and physical and chemical specifications. In-cylinder gas pressure, peak in-cylinder gas pressure, apparent heat release rate, peak apparent heat release rate, cumulative heat release rate, rate of pressure rise and ignition delay period have been minutely explored and discussed considering the outcomes of the current literature in the following subsections. 6.1.1 In-cylinder gas pressure The changing in the in-cylinder gas pressure with respect to the crank angles for all the tested fuel samples at various engine loads of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% can be seen in Fig. 5 (from A to D). Besides, from Fig. 5, the peak in-cylinder gas pressures for all the tested fuel samples were extracted and tabulated in Table 9 . The peak in-cylinder gas pressures for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and biodiesel at the engine load of 100% were found to be at 54.47 bar, 54.08 bar, 54.18 bar, 53.91 bar, and 51.67 bar respectively. At the end of the careful analysis of the in-cylinder pressure figures, it was followed up that the peak pressures for all the tested fuel samples were noticed to be around 5-8° crank angle near the top dead center (TDC). Due to the lesser energy content and poor atomization characteristics of the neat biodiesel, the in-cylinder gas-pressure for POB at all the engine loads was noted to be as the least and the pressure figures were appeared disordered because of the aforementioned characteristics respectively. However, the maximum in-cylinder pressure profiles at all engine load conditions were observed in the diesel fuel because of its highest calorific value (as seen in Table 2) and high-quality fuel atomization characteristics. The addition of 1-heptanol to the diesel fuel as well as the POB-diesel fuel blend resulted in little drops in the peak in-cylinder gas pressure figures at the lower percentages of the alcohol because some parameters such as the high latent heat of evaporation (as mentioned in Table 2) led to the aforementioned declines. It can be clearly noted that both the blends infused with biodiesel and 1-heptanol caused to shift in the curves of the in-cylinder gas pressure to the right side of the TDC. Also, there is a retarded start of the combustion process inside the engine cylinder owing to the lower cetane number of the 1-heptanol and its blends with diesel and biodiesel fuels. Ibrahim [36] observed generally a lower maximum gas pressure for butanol/biodiesel/diesel blends as compared to neat diesel fuel. Nour et al. [38] found that the acquired the utmost peak in-cylinder pressure was measured with heptanol/diesel blends while butanol added diesel fuel exhibited lightly lesser data than that of reference diesel fuel. Tse et al. [39] appeared that the diesel/biodiesel/ethanol blend usage in the CI engine caused to decrease the peak gas pressures according to the pure biodiesel while interestingly to increase against diesel fuel. The researchers highlighted that the reason for the aforementioned case was the lesser cetane number and supreme latent heat of vaporization of ethanol in the blend and hence temperature throughout the fuel injection process, i.e., fuel mixed air, the augmentation of the ignition delay period along with the effects the gas pressure turns in high. Jamrozik et al. [43] reported that the maximum methanol concentration in both diesel and biodiesel fuels should be 30% based on the experimental results. Further increasing the alcohol proportion in the blend caused in the reduction of gas pressure. Nanthagopal et al. [104] have blended 1-pentanol and 1-butanol with Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel at 40%, 50%, and 60% concentrations by volume and tested in a diesel engine under various engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and full load). The addition of higher alcohol led to a decrease in the peak in-cylinder pressure results and 1-pentanol exhibited better outcomes than 1-butanol in the blends. Ramesh et al. [105] have conducted various experiments on neat Calophyllum Inophyllum methyl ester and its blends with diesel fuel/hexanol in a diesel engine to explore the engine performance, exhaust emissions, and combustion characteristics. They have indicated that the addition of higher alcohol into the diesel/biodiesel blends caused to decline the peak pressures because of the higher latent heat of evaporation and higher relative specific heats of the hexanol. As opposed, Ashok et al. [106] observed that n-octanol with Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel resulted in the rise of the peak in-cylinder gas pressures because the n-octanol increased the oxygen content of the blends which improved the combustion efficiency. Emiroğlu and Şen [47] noticed that the maximum in-cylinder pressure findings for various alcohol blended diesel fuel was higher and also their positions were earlier than that of diesel fuel. This case could be based on the rapid combustion reaction of the accumulated fuel sample in the cylinder attributing the ignition delay period. Kumar et al. [50] tested the 30% by volume higher-order alcohols addition into the diesel fuel in the diesel engine to determine the combustion, as well as emission results and they, indicated that the maximum to minimum peak in-cylinder pressure figures was as follows: iso-butanol > n-pentanol > n-hexanol > n-octanol > ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. 6.1.2 Combustion parameters Ignition delay (ID), uncontrolled combustion, controlled combustion, and after burning periods are the combustion process stages that occurred in the CI engine. Throughout the ID period, the fuel has been injected into the chamber of the combustion and then evaporates progressively by mixing with the air. ID can be defined as the time difference from the beginning of the fuel injection to the start of the combustion process inside the cylinder as mentioned-above. Namely, it is the principal ratio where an instantaneous in-cylinder pressure increment is revealed. In this period, the physical and chemical processes have played an important role so as to prepare the fuel for the combustion stage. There is a difference that occurred between the fuel temperature injected into the cylinder of the engine and the temperature of air sucked into the combustion chamber with the time because the compression process takes place. The temperature of the heat overflows this temperature difference in the course of the evaporation of the fuel. During this transfer removed heat, slow to some extent on the temperature and pressure increase in the cylinder. The other significant combustion parameters in the points of the combustion analysis occurred in the diesel engines are called as the start of injection (SOI) and the start of combustion (SOC). SOI, in other words, the injection timing means the time when the fuel injection process commences in the cylinder. SOI can be found as the crank angle where the injector opens. SOC is described as the point where the HRR diagram crosses over the zero transition [100]. In addition, ID period can be calculated as the difference between SOI and SOC. In the present experimental study, SOI, SOC, ID, and other important combustion parameters were observed and briefly tabulated in Table 9. From the table, SOI increased slightly depending on the increases in the engine load while SOC and ID values were decreased. Also, the maximum mean gas temperature (MGT) was increased when the engine load was increased. This is one of the reason for decreasing the ID periods. A similar inclination was also obtained by Celik and coworkers [107]. The researchers indicated that the temperature in the engine cylinder rose thanks to the increase of the engine speed and thus, ID became shorter. Qi et al. [108] performed a study and appeared that ID duration was reduced with the increase in the engine load due to the higher temperature occurs inside the cylinder. No doubt that the increment in the engine load has led to increasing both MGT and EGT as seen in Table 9 and Fig. 20, respectively. Consequently, when Table 9 and Fig. 20 were taken into account together, the findings observed were exceedingly close to the anticipated results. Besides that, it can be figured out that the addition of 1-heptanol into the diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend caused to increase the ID values. One of the most substantial fuel characteristics that influence the ID period is the cetane number the fuels. The aforementioned information (given in the introduction section) has presented an idea regarding the cetane numbers of the different chains of alcohol. By all means, the cetane numbers of the alcohols are very low as compared to conventional diesel fuel whereas the cetane number of the biodiesels can be slightly higher or lower than diesel fuel according to the feedstock of the biodiesel. Actually, the cetane number of biodiesel has been affected by fatty acid composition. This subject was also given in Section 5.2.3. The cetane number of the used 1-heptanol was found to be at 23. The cetane numbers of the alcohol and peanut oil biodiesel were lower than that of diesel fuel and hence the cetane numbers of the fuel blends were reduced as mentioned in Table 5. A low cetane number may cause to evaporate more fuel inside the chamber of the combustion and hence occur a higher quantity of heat. It can be concluded that an extended ID periods were achieved. Another reason for becoming longer ID duration has been explained by Ozener and his team [109]. They indicated that the higher viscosity of fuel caused to occur poor atomization process, slower mixing course, larger penetration, and lesser cone angle in the CI engine and hence, the ID period has slightly extended. However, the density and viscosity values of the alcohols are found to be lower which improves the mixture of air/fuel. Therefore a higher amount of fuel has been combusted swiftly pending the premixed combustion stage. Moreover, the addition of alcohol has mitigated the surface tension as well as density. It is to be noted that the alcohol blended fuel samples well mixed with the air because of the evaporation and atomization of the alcohol have been developed in this way [110]. Tse et al. [39] observed that boosting the ethanol (lower chain alcohol) fraction (from 0% to 20%) in the fuel samples led to retard the SOC period and thus the ID duration was increased. In the present work, the addition of 1-heptanol to the diesel fuel and B20 blend brought about postponing the SOC values as compared to neat diesel fuel in general. Alptekin et al. [111] also stated that delayed SOI values of alcohol-treated fuel blends can cause to keep back the SOC duration. Alptekin [112], Örs et al. [113] and Zhu et al. [114] also found similar outcomes and reasons. The following table also provides the relative air–fuel ratio (λ) for all the tested fuel samples under each operating condition. As seen, the air–fuel ratio reduced with load owing to fix boost operation. First, the stoichiometric air–fuel ratios for each neat fuel, i.e. diesel fuel, peanut oil biodiesel, and 1-heptanol were calculated to be as 14.40, 12.31, and 12.43, respectively. The combustion equations for the above-mentioned tested fuels were represented underneath. • For diesel fuel (30) C 14 H 25 + 20.25 O 2 + 3.76 N 2 → 14 CO 2 + 12.5 H 2 O + 76.14 N 2 For 100% peanut oil biodiesel fuel (31) C 17.20 H 32.31 O 2 + 24.28 O 2 + 3.76 N 2 → 17.20 CO 2 + 16.16 H 2 O + 91.29 N 2 • For 1-heptanol (32) C 7 H 16 O + 10.5 O 2 + 3.76 N 2 → 7 CO 2 + 8 H 2 O + 39.48 N 2 The highest relative air–fuel ratio was found to be at 3.96 for pure diesel fuel under the least load condition. The peanut oil biodiesel, as well as tested fuel blends, had a lesser λ, corresponding to augmented fuel consumption. 6.1.3 Apparent heat release rate The heat release rate is a remarkable combustion key parameter that describes the combustion phases like premixed combustion, rapid combustion, controlled combustion and period after burning. It presents an opinion regarding the released total heat energy according to the crank angle of the internal combustion engine [106]. The apparent heat release rates for all the tested fuel samples were calculated using Equation 23. All the experimental tests for all tested fuel samples were carried out at a standard injection timing of 23° before TDC. The diverse apparent heat release rate values for all the tested fuel samples at various engine loads across the crank angles have been portrayed in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 , respectively. In addition, for better understanding, the maximum apparent heat release rates of the tested fuels have been presented in Table 9. As observed from the graphs that under all engine loads, the peak heat release rate values for conventional diesel fuel are found to be the highest among the fuel samples. This can be explained that the diesel fuel leads to becoming the aforementioned figures because of its higher energy content (as seen in Table 2), preferable fuel atomization characteristics, in-cylinder gas pressure profiles (as presented in Fig. 5 and Table 9) along with inefficient and retarded flame out duration. The higher ignition delay period of diesel fuel caused to becoming an increment at higher crank angles in the apparent heat release rate for diesel fuel. The peanut oil biodiesel, however, has achieved affirmative conditions owing to the lower calorific value, lower cetane number, and an excess amount of oxygen molecules in the structure so as to reduce the temperature inside the cylinder and therefore, lesser output in the point of the specific energy. B20 fuel blend has resulted in the apparent heat release rates closer to the unmodified diesel fuel owing to the low percentage of blending with diesel fuel and its some physicochemical properties, especially viscosity and density. The addition of 1-heptanol to the former diesel/biodiesel blend has led to becoming in a gradual enhancement in the specifications such as fuel atomization, the blending capabilities of the fuels, etc. Kumar and Saravanan [46] reviewed a paper that they also monitored an improvement in the energy content for the biodiesel/diesel fuel blend with the help of the addition of alcohol. The calorific value of 1-heptanol is 39.92 MJ/kg (as presented in Table 2) which is higher than that of peanut oil biodiesel. However, there is no evident improvement in the apparent heat release rate figures when the diesel engine fueled with alcohol-infused fuel blends. This is mainly due to the lower percentage of the 1-heptanol in the blend and the aforementioned better fuel properties. Even at all of the engine load operating conditions, similar trends were appeared among the tested fuel blends. On the other hand, the influence of the ignition delay is fairly extensive at partial loads, and hence the crank angles between the maximum heat release rate figures are substantially different as seen in both Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. As a result, the peak heat release rate values for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and peanut oil biodiesel were found to be at 40.22 J/deg (at 353° crank angle), 37.53 J/deg (at 354° crank angle), 37.80 J/deg (at 355° crank angle), 37.91 J/deg (at 356° crank angle), and 27.66 J/deg (at 356° crank angle), respectively under full engine load. The apparent heat release rate for the B20 fuel blend was significantly lower among the fuel blend because of its low calorific value. The addition of 1-heptanol into the biodiesel/diesel fuel blend led to improve the peak heat release rate. This is due to the lower cetane number of the higher alcohol and hence it leads to a slightly longer ignition delay period in the cylinder. Dhanasekaran et al. [115] indicated similar trends in the heat release rate figures with the addition of n-pentanol into the yellow grease/diesel fuel blend. Noteworthy was that the researchers observed a reduction in the peak in-cylinder gas pressure, the maximum rate of pressure rise as well as peak heat release rate owing to the higher viscosity and lower volatility of the waste cooking oil resulting in poor atomization and mixture preparation with the air throughout the shorter ignition delay period. 6.1.4 Cumulative heat release rate The cumulative heat release rates for all of the tested fuel samples at various engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) are presented in Fig. 8 . Among the tested fuels, conventional diesel fuel exhibited the highest cumulative heat release rate figures because of its considerable high calorific value, excellent fuel atomization characteristics and better brake thermal efficiency. On the contrary, the peanut oil biodiesel resulted in low cumulative heat release rate values at lower crank angles. This is probably due to its high viscosity, high density, low energy content and inherent oxygen content in the molecular bonds. The addition of 1-heptanol to the diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend caused becoming an indistinct reduction in the cumulative heat release rate figures owing to the low proportion in the blend. This decline can be explained by the high oxygen content of the 1-heptanol. The comparatively low temperatures of the combustion chamber lead a critical case in the above-mentioned drops in the cumulative heat release rates through enhancement in the capabilities of blending along with the increase in both brake thermal efficiency and volumetric efficiency was noticed. Ramesh et al. [105] highlighted that with the addition of hexanol into the biodiesel/diesel fuel blend, the cumulative heat release rate values were decreased drastically because of the excess oxygen content. Additionally, lower temperatures in the combustion chamber play a substantial role in the above-mentioned declines in the cumulative heat release rate values. 6.1.5 The rate of pressure rise Fig. 9 depicts the pressure rise rates of the tested fuel samples at various engine load conditions. It can be seen that the pressure rise rate rises with the increase of the engine load. Shrivastava et al. [116] stated that the rate of the pressure rise ascends with a rise of the engine load as well as a compression ratio. This is an indispensable parameter for monitoring the knocking generation in an engine. It also expresses a higher level in NOX formation in the engine [117]. The maximum rates of pressure rise were found to be at 4.45 bar/deg for diesel fuel, 4.22 bar/deg for B20, 4.30 bar/deg for Hp20, 4.14 bar/deg for B20Hp20, and 3.19 bar/deg for peanut oil biodiesel. There is no evident variation of the peak pressure rise rate with the addition of 1-heptanol and biodiesel into diesel fuel. 6.1.6 Ringing intensity An intensive ringing process causes elevated combustion noise in the engine, resulting in damage to the parts of the engine. Accordingly, it is very important to explore the behavior of the ringing intensity (RI) because it explains the combustion noise in the engine. Fig. 10 portrays the variation of the RI for the tested fuels at different engine loads. It was clarified that the RI values have to be lower than 5 MW/m2, leading to an appropriate combustion noise and knock free operation [118]. For this reason, the aforementioned level was employed as a maximum limit for acceptable noise for the combustion process. Besides, the RI is related with the peak in-cylinder pressure, engine speed, and maximum pressure rise rate [119]. As observed, the increase of the loads caused to increase the RI values. In the present study, the highest RI results for the diesel fuel, Hp20, B20, B20Hp20, and peanut oil biodiesel were calculated to be as 3.37 MW/m2, 3.17 MW/m2, 3.05 MW/m2, 2.95 MW/m2, and 1.82 MW/m2, respectively. The peak RI figures at the maximum engine loads were observed when the CI engine fueled with neat diesel fuel owing to its high HRR [77]. As hoped, the addition of alternative biodiesel fuel into the conventional diesel fuel ensured to reduce the RI figures because of the lubricity characteristic. In the work performed by Uludamar et al. [120] who indicated that the vibration and noise values of the tested engine mitigated with the rising concentration of the biodiesel in the blends. Based on the current RI results, this study exhibited that the peanut oil biodiesel led to decreases in the noise and vibration against diesel fuel. Erdoğan et al. [99] stated that the RI values were obtained lesser with the usage of biodiesel than that of diesel fuel due to the above-mentioned reason. Uyumaz [121] noticed that the RI declined with the increase of mustard oil biodiesel content in the tested fuel blends and the least RI was computed with diesel fuel. The researcher explained the reason as the lower calorific value of biodiesel resulted in a more stable combustion process inside the cylinder. Soloiu et al. [122] reported that a lower RI for the 100% cottonseed oil biodiesel was revealed because the pressure rise rate for biodiesel was 20% lesser than that of No. 2 diesel fuel."
9,Elemental analysis results of peanut oil biodiesel and diesel fuel,"6.2 Elemental analysis results of peanut oil biodiesel and diesel fuel The elemental analysis results of the peanut oil biodiesel and diesel fuel were shown in Fig. 11 . The actual values of the elements were also represented in Supplementary data file B. As observed, the contents of Cr, Co, Ni, and Cu in both diesel and biodiesel fuels were obtained to be lower than 1 ppm. The most dominant elements in diesel fuel were found to be at Ca with 169.194 ppm following K with the value of 122.317 ppm while for peanut oil biodiesel as Ca with 158.13 ppm and K with 115.976 ppm. Cesur et al. [123] analyzed the element content of the cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) seed oil biodiesel. The researchers found that most of the elements such as Cr, Ni, Sn, Pb, etc. were measured to be lower than 1 ppm meanwhile the highest value was observed with Na by 373.18 ppm. Mihaela et al. [124] measured the element contents in both various oils obtained from different raw materials such as safflower, soybean, and rapeseed and their biodiesel fuels. Interestingly, they noticed that the viscosity values of the analyzed specimens were not affected by the element content. Silva et al. [125] endeavored to analyze some elements in the marine microalgae being used for the production of alternative fuel. They marked that the element content of the microalgae was associated with the cellular affinity along with the existence of the elements in the ambient where the microalgae can grow. Hossain et al. [126] studied the elemental analysis of waste soybean oil biodiesel synthesized under different reaction conditions and determined that the quantity of silver was high in general while most of the elements were low."
10,Exhaust emission characteristics,"6.3 Exhaust emission characteristics In this section, the different exhaust gas emission parameters such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions have been analyzed and discussed in detail furthermore for comparative evaluations of 1-heptanol infused blends with conventional diesel fuel and peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel blend in the following subsections. 6.3.1 Carbon monoxide emission The carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no color and odor. Its density is slightly higher than that of atmospheric air and it is immensely poisonous to the people. The variation of CO emission level with engine load for various fuel samples was illustrated in Fig. 12 . From the graph, the CO emission patterns for all the tested fuel samples mitigated with the increase in the engine load. This is mainly explained by some parameters like higher BTE at the higher engine loads and early flame-out period because the augmented maximum in-cylinder gas pressures led to the reduction in the CO emissions as mentioned above. Additionally, it can be noticed from Fig. 12 that the conventional diesel fuel released the minimum CO emission at all the engine load conditions among the fuel samples. The diesel fuel has the highest calorific value as observed in Table 3 and increased in-cylinder temperature owing to the enhanced efficiency leading to the lower level of CO emission. The shortage of surplus oxygen content also obstructs the transformation of carbon monoxide to the carbon dioxide, assisting the CO emissions significantly. Furthermore, peanut oil biodiesel due to the excess amount of oxygen content in the chemical structure emitted a lesser emission level of CO than that of diesel fuel. Also, alcohols possess fewer C atoms in the chemical structure resulting in less amount of CO emission [127]. Besides that, the unstable moderate ketones and aldehydes occurred throughout the combustion process oxidize the CO and nitrogen atoms so as to compose the CO2 and nitrogen oxides. The comprehensive information about the nitrogen oxides formed during the combustion process will be given in the 6.3.5 section. Another ground for reducing the CO emission is the cetane number of the tested fuel sample since the high cetane number may provide a near-complete combustion process that takes place in the cylinder. The maximum CO emissions for all the tested fuel samples were noted to be at the lowest engine load of 25%. At this load, the CO emission for the pure diesel fuel was measured to be as 13.02 g/kWh whereas the CO footprint of the peanut oil biodiesel was recorded as 8.89 g/kWh. Namely, the biodiesel emitted by 31.72% lower CO than diesel fuel to the environment. On the other side, the infusion of the 1-heptanol to the diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend caused to decrease the CO figures according to the diesel fuel at all engine loads. Devarajan et al. [82] used heptanol with mustard seed oil biodiesel in the diesel engine and the CO emission figures were decreased with the increase of heptanol concentration in the blend. Because hydroxyl group and n-heptanol oxygen atoms connect throughout the combustion process which led to decelerate the formation of soot resulting in a lesser amount of soot and hence, increase the oxygen presence. Imdadul et al. [65] highlighted that pentanol evaporated smoothly in the cylinder because of the lesser density value of the pentanol than that of diesel fuel and hence, the spray atomization duration was shortened. The researchers also stated that pentanol infused fuel blends caused an inclined effect so that it had a low stoichiometric air–fuel ratio thereby the reduction was observed in the CO emission. Akar [128] reported that the blending of butanol with flaxseed oil biodiesel/diesel fuel blend caused to decrease CO emission as compared to the conventional diesel fuel. Ashok et al. [129] have concluded in their experimental study that by analyzing the performance, exhaust emissions, and combustion behavior of isobutanol in an unmodified single-cylinder diesel engine, the binary blend of alcohol/diesel fuel blend contains 20% isobutanol emitted lower CO emission than that of diesel fuel under the maximum engine load and one of the reasons for this reduction was the lower C/H ratio of alcohol. Choi et al. [130] remarked that the split injection process could be implemented to the CI engine in place of the single injection to attain a better CO emission pattern. Ramesh et al. [105] have reported in their findings that the addition of hexanol into the B50 fuel to form ternary fuel blends led to reducing the CO emission levels beyond the neat biodiesel fuel only appropriate if the hexanol content was equal to or larger than 30% by weight. Li et al. [62] monitored the lower percentage of CO emission with using diesel/biodiesel/pentanol blends. Ajav et al. [131] indicated that the ratio of the CO emission was declined from 36.8% to 62.5% by using 5%-20% ethanol/diesel fuel blends as compared to diesel fuel. Unsurprisingly, the opposite view in the CO emission was claimed by Randazzo and Sodré [132]. The researchers pointed out that CO emission rose progressively with the increase of the ethanol fraction in the B20 fuel blend. In addition to them, Wei et al. [133] also presented that higher alcohol addition into the diesel fuel brought about the higher CO emission and its impact was distinct at low loads. Zhu et al. [114] found that n-pentanol/waste cooking oil biodiesel blends generated a higher amount of CO emission than those of diesel and biodiesel fuels, especially low loads (from 0.08 MPa to 0.24 MPa). 6.3.2 Carbon dioxide emission The carbon dioxide (CO2) is related to the complete combustion of the fuel for internal combustion engines and also it is an end-combustion product of fuels that comprise carbon molecules in their chemical structure. It eventuates because of the elevated post-combustion temperature as mentioned above. The presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen molecules in the combustion chamber for a complete burning also rises the percentage of CO2 emissions. The hydroxyl radical OH (one of the principal oxidizing agents) transforms carbon monoxide into the carbon dioxide thanks to enough attendance of oxygen [104]. Fig. 13 has presented the carbon dioxide emission levels as a function of engine load for all the tested fuel samples. It can be observed from the graph that the CO2 emissions were increased with the increase of the engine load. These increments aforementioned in CO2 emissions can be integrated into the rise in BTE with an increase in the engine load. Among the fuel samples, pure peanut oil biodiesel released the maximum CO2 emissions for all the engine loads whereas, diesel fuel portrayed the lowest CO2 emissions due to its higher energy content, enhanced BTE and even atomization characteristics of the droplet size of the fuel causes to reduce the emission levels of CO2. Heptanol owing to its indigenous oxygen molecules in its chemical bonds reacts smoothly with CO molecules and occur CO2 molecules and therefore it has a substantial effect on the formation of CO2 emissions. The CO2 emissions for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and peanut oil biodiesel were recorded to be at 178.35 g/kWh, 181.37 g/kWh, 183.10 g/kWh, 187.06 g/kWh, and 227.54 g/kWh, respectively at the full load operating condition. It can be seen that the CO2 emissions for B20 and Hp20 are almost similar and the difference is very minute. Hulwan and Joshi [110] indicated that the addition of 20% and 30% by volume ethanol into the biodiesel/diesel fuel blend caused to increase the CO2 emission results under low engine loads since the fuel consumption was ascended to generate the same engine power because of the worse combustion process. Moreover, the researchers monitored that there was no significant change in the CO2 emission figures at all loads once the injection timing was altered from 21° to 13° bTDC. Babu and Anand [134] observed that the CI engine operating with used frying oil biodiesel/alcohol/diesel fuel blends released more CO2 emission than that of diesel and biodiesel fuels owing to the more complete combustion process takes place inside the engine cylinder. The opposite results were argued by various researchers in the literature. Alptekin et al. [111] explored that CO2 emission of the ternary blend (60% diesel fuel/20% was cooking oil biodiesel/20% bioethanol) descended up to 7.1% in comparison with the neat diesel fuel at the engine load of 600 Nm due to the low C/H ratio of the used alcohol. A similar reduction was also obtained by Akar [128] using butanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel blends. It can be concluded that 1-heptanol infused fuel blends can be preferred as a significant fuel additive so as to fight with global warming rather than neat biodiesel fuel. 6.3.3 Oxygen emission Fig. 14 demonstrates the oxygen (O2) emission levels with engine load for various fuel samples. The maximum O2 emissions for all the tested fuel samples were recorded at the lowest engine load while the O2 emissions were reduced with the increase of engine load. At 100% engine load, O2 emissions for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and pure peanut oil biodiesel were found to be at 613.31 g/kWh, 620.90 g/kWh, 664.59 g/kWh, 660.28 g/kWh, and 671.51 g/kWh, respectively. One of the most significant parameters, in order to happen complete combustion process inside the cylinder of the engine, is the concentration of the oxygen molecules in the combustion chamber. The amount of the O2 emission levels increased with the incorporation of biodiesel and 1-heptanol because the alcohol and biodiesel have an excess amount of oxygen contents at different fractions in their atomic structure (as observed in Table 3 and Table 5). As far as the researcher knows that there has not been previously reported study about oxygen emission of 1-heptanol treated fuel samples. However, the previous study of the researcher [135] has indicated that the addition of higher alcohols such as 1-butanol or n-pentanol into the biodiesel/diesel fuel blend by 5% and 10% to form ternary blend caused to increase the O2 emissions by averagely 84.62%-121.34% for 1-butanol addition and 52.74%-78.38% for n-pentanol addition as compared to the diesel fuel. Aydin and Öğüt [136] have observed in their experimental study that the addition of bioethanol into the biodiesel/diesel fuel blend led to increasing the oxygen emissions in comparison with the conventional diesel fuel. Besides, there is no reported study in the literature regarding the oxygen emission of 1-heptanol infused fuel blends to the best of the author’s knowledge. 6.3.4 Unburned hydrocarbon emission Unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for all the tested fuel samples as a function of the engine load have been drawn in Fig. 15 for advanced combustion characteristic research. It can be observed from the graph that HC emissions for all the tested fuel samples increased with the increase in the engine load from 25% to 100%. In the theoretical examination, diesel fuel has to emit the highest HC emission owing to the deficit of zero native oxygen content in the atomic structure. As interpreted in the aforementioned expression, the emission levels of HC for conventional diesel fuel occurred the highest at all engine loads among the tested fuel samples. This can be explained by the high efficiency, absence of the oxygen molecule and elevated carbon weight. The peanut oil biodiesel figured substantially lower HC emissions as compared to the diesel fuel at all loads. Factors such as high oxygen content and extended flame out region might have resulted in the state as mentioned above. The inherent oxygen molecules in the biodiesel are in the form of esters. The unburned hydrocarbons react with these oxygen molecules during the combustion process was undergone. As a result, RCHO and ROH have occurred. The infusion of higher alcohol to these fuel samples push forward fuels the mentioned-above reactions because of the increased temperatures inside the combustion chamber. B20, being a mixture of both peanut oil biodiesel and diesel fuel, concluded in HC emissions drastically higher than that of biodiesel fuel but slightly lower than that of traditional diesel fuel at almost all the engine loads because B20 composes of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel fuel. The addition of 1-heptanol to the diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend decreased the HC emissions according to the diesel fuel but still higher than that of biodiesel fuel. The maximum unburned HC emissions for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and biodiesel fuel were found to be at 0.164 g/kWh, 0.146 g/kWh, 0.145 g/kWh, 0.138 g/kWh, and 0.105 g/kWh, respectively. These findings have been in line with other investigations performed with various higher alcohols. Devarajan et al. [82], for instance, found that HC emissions were decreased with the blending of heptanol with mustard oil biodiesel at different concentrations because heptanol improved the fuel combustion efficiency and promoted combustion. Ashok et al. [129] noted that ternary fuel blends include diesel, biodiesel, and isobutanol showed an increase of HC emission as compared to the neat biodiesel fuel because of higher vaporization and combustion times of isobutanol. Babu and Anand [134] obtained that 85% biodiesel/5% diesel fuel/10% n-pentanol blend exhibited the least HC emission among the other ternary blends. At 100% load, it released 74 ppm which was lower than diesel fuel by 39.4%. 6.3.5 The oxides of nitrogen emission Fig. 16 has depicted the alteration of brake specific oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emissions for diesel fuel, peanut oil biodiesel, biodiesel/diesel fuel blend, 1-heptanol/diesel fuel blend, and 1-heptanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel blend at different engine loads. The unmodified diesel fuel portrayed the least NOX emission figures amongst the tested fuel samples against all engine loads. However, the neat peanut oil biodiesel has emitted the highest NOX emissions at all engine loads as compared to the diesel fuel owing to the existence of native oxygen molecules in the chemical structure. During the combustion process takes place in the cylinder, peanut oil biodiesel occurs by-products such as ketones and aldehydes that in turn decrease the oxides of nitrogen and carbon. Accordingly, pure diesel fuel releases the lowest NOX emissions as mentioned above. This may be clarified by some parameters like the elevated temperature of the combustion chamber, flame velocity, improved thermal efficiency, and the shortage of the oxygen molecules along with higher energy content leading in helping the lower NOX emissions of the diesel fuel [128]. As theory recommendation, B20, being a blend of peanut oil biodiesel and diesel fuel, should have levels of emission closer to the NOX emissions of diesel fuel due to the higher blending ratio of diesel fuel. However, the NOX emissions of the B20 fuel blend remained closer to the pure peanut oil biodiesel owing to the worse blending characteristics coupled with cetane number and poor atomization property. The addition of 1-heptanol to diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend increased the amount of the oxygen content in the fuel resulting in weak combustion situations at lesser temperatures of the combustion chamber. The aforementioned determinants concluded in reduced NOX emissions when compared to the pure peanut oil biodiesel even at the engine load of 100%. Nitrogen molecules need elevated temperatures to react with the oxygen molecules forming NOX. The excess amount of oxygen molecules maintains the combustion chamber temperature in the control and from this place goes down the NOX emissions. At 100% load, the NOX emissions for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and pure peanut oil biodiesel were recorded to be as 9.87 g/kWh, 14.54 g/kWh, 14.27 g/kWh, 13.13 g/kWh, and 17.22 g/kWh, respectively. Noteworthy, the ternary blend of 1-heptanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel figures the lowest NOX emission levels among the fuel blends, however, still higher than that of diesel fuel. The NOX emission difference for B20Hp20 and conventional diesel fuel at 25% engine load is approximately 33.51% while the gradient decreases to 24.83% at the full engine load. The enhancement in BTE along with drop-in BSFC at the higher engine loads associating with the increase in the apparent heat release rate in the meantime may denote that the fuel consumption reduced beside the blending efficiency of the fuel sample also improves for the ternary blends aiding in a decreased NOX emission difference. Ashok et al. [129] studied the effects of isobutanol as a higher alcohol addition into the diesel fuel, Calophyllum inophyllum oil biodiesel, and biodiesel/diesel fuel blends on the NOX formation and they detected that the isobutanol/diesel fuel blend (1658 ppm) increased NOX emissions as compared to diesel fuel (1547 ppm). 20% isobutanol/80% biodiesel blend showed significant NOX decrements when compared with pure biodiesel because of the better cooling influence of the alcohol resulting in lesser end combustion temperature. On the contrary, Babu and Anand [134] indicated that both biodiesel/diesel fuel/alcohol blends and pure biodiesel released a lower amount of NO emission than that of diesel fuel. They explained the reason as the higher latent heat of vaporization and lesser energy content of n-pentanol and n-hexanol caused the reduction in the combustion chamber temperature and formed lower NO emission. Although they pointed out that the lower iodine number of biodiesel led to a lesser amount of NO emission, this case can be explored in future investigations. Nanthagopal et al. [104] found that the utilization of higher alcohol like 1-butanol and 1-pentanol with Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester in the CI engine brought about the decreasing in NOX emissions compared to the biodiesel fuel due to the high latent heat of vaporization of alcohols in the blend resulting in quenching impact throughout the combustion process. Soloiu et al. [76] reported that the usage of an oxygenated fuel like alcohol or fatty acid methyl ester helped to the reduction of emissions since this case may be predicated to the lesser carbon to oxygen ratio as well as the came across relative air–fuel ratio."
11,Performance characteristics,"6.4 Performance characteristics The characteristics of the engine performance have been examined by the assessment of parameters like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), volumetric efficiency, exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The aforementioned parameters have been elaborately discussed in the following subsections for all the tested fuel samples taking into account the recent literature. 6.4.1 Brake thermal efficiency The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) can be briefly described as the mechanical brake power of an internal combustion engine as a function of the input thermal energy obtained from the used fuel in the case of the consumption in a unit time [105]. The brake thermal efficiency using the data acquired from the trials was calculated using Equation 33. (33) η e = P e Q (34) Q = m ̇ fuel . Q LHV where, • η e : brake thermal efficiency, • P e : effective engine power, • Q : heat provided from the fuel, • m ̇ fuel : mass fuel consumption, • Q LHV : lower heating value of the fuel. Fig. 17 has depicted the variation of the BTE values against the engine load for all the tested fuel samples. BTE values for the diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and neat peanut oil biodiesel at the full load were found to be at 40.81%, 40.46%, 40.67%, 40.27%, and 35.00%, respectively. As observed from the figure, a fractional increment in the BTE values with the rise in the engine load can be seen for all the tested fuel samples. Besides that, the difference between the BTE for peanut oil biodiesel fuel and diesel fuel has been augmented when the engine load was increased. It can be concluded the rising ratios in the consumption of the fuel at the maximum engine load. This case has also exhibited that the addition of small percentages of the 1-heptanol and biodiesel into conventional diesel fuel has caused to decrease in the BTE results accordingly. This can be explained because of the worsening of the energy content of the fuel blends, and decreasing the efficiency mainly owing to the poor combustion characteristics. However, it can be clearly mentioned that numerous parameters influence the BTE of an internal combustion engine as follows: injection pressure, injection timing, air/fuel ratio, compression ratio as well as most significantly the energy content of the fuel sample. From Table 3 and Table 5, it can be appeared that the neat diesel fuel possesses a larger calorific value than those of biodiesel and 1-heptanol. Also, the enhancements in the viscosity, surface tension, and density immediately lead to the improvement of the atomization properties of the fuel and air/fuel mixing ratio, as well. From now on, the BTE for diesel fuel has been noticed to be higher than that of biodiesel at all the engine loads. By the way, BTE for the B20 fuel blend has figured to be closer to the BTE of diesel fuel. This is mainly due to the calorific value of the diesel fuel and B20 fuel blend. Also, the addition of 1-heptanol to the diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend has shown similar effects in the chamber of combustion. The 1-heptanol treated diesel fuel exhibited better results than the ternary fuel blend due to the calorific value and inherent oxygen content of the fuel samples (as seen in Table 5). This leads to becoming favorable conditions for a preferable fuel atomization process inside the engine cylinder. Silitonga et al. [137] revealed similar outcomes of BTE as they tested by the addition of bioethanol along with diesel fuel and biodiesel. They mentioned that lesser energy content of the alcohol added blends caused to lower BSFC and hence resulting in lower BTE. Ibrahim [36] achieved that the blending of 20% (by volume) butanol with the B50 fuel blend decreased the peak thermal efficiency from 30.7% to 29.4%. Candan et al. [138] obtained that the BTE values were generally reduced when the diesel engine operating with diesel/methanol blend due to the calorific value of the alcohol. Yesilyurt et al. [135] monitored that 1-butanol and n-pentanol infused fuel samples figured out allowable alteration in the BTE values and hence, these higher alcohols had fine potentials to be used as an oxygenated fuel additive in the CI engine. On the contrary, Wei et al. [133] found that the addition of n-pentanol to diesel fuel caused no evident difference in the BTE values. Surely, the BTE can be enhanced with the help of utilizing several ways on the used engine. Fu et al. [139], for instance, showed that engine torque and thermal efficiency of the liquefied methane engine might be improved thanks to increasing the compression ratio of the engine. 6.4.2 Brake specific fuel consumption The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) can be defined as the amount of the fuel required in order to generate one kilowatt of power in one hour. In other words, it expresses the efficiency of the fuel for any internal combustion engine. Therefore, it has a crucial role in the choosing factor of any given fuel. The BSFC results for the various tested fuels were calculated using Equation 35, presented below: (35) BSFC = Fuelconsumption Outputpower The results of BSFC for all the tested fuel samples as a function of engine loads can be presented in Fig. 18 . For the diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and B100 fuel samples, BSFC values at 100% engine load were observed as 203.34 g/kWh, 209.14 g/kWh, 213.25 g/kWh, 218.94 g/kWh, and 257.80 g/kWh, respectively. As seen, it can be considered that BSFC figures decreased with the increase in the engine loads. Furthermore, the additions of 1-heptanol and peanut oil biodiesel into the neat diesel fuel have caused to increase in the BSFC values. The above-mentioned cases can be because of the calorific value of the 1-heptanol and peanut oil biodiesel. Henceforth, the proportion of the fuel-injected to generate a desired amount of power has been also varied accordingly. The performance and combustion characteristics of any engine effects from the latent heat of evaporation, calorific value, viscosity, and density. Diesel fuel consumed relatively lower than those of biodiesel and 1-heptanol due to the energy content (as seen in Table 3) and higher thermal efficiency (as observed in Fig. 17). Besides, the vaporization of alcohols eventuates quietly since the latent evaporation temperatures of the alcohols are to be higher than that of diesel fuel [138]. Atmanli et al. [140] noted from their experimental research that the increase in the BSFC results when using lower energy content of the higher alcohol blend and biodiesel in a similar aspect. Moreover, they indicated that diesel engines have spent more fuel in terms of using fuel blends with higher alcohol than that of unmodified diesel fuel so as to balance the brake power loss in the engine. On the other hand, Atmanli et al. [141] experimented with an extensive analysis of diesel fuel/vegetable oil/n-butanol ternary blends in a diesel engine and mentioned an extra parameter that even the cetane number of the fuel sample had a profound effect on the BSFC results. The start of the combustion was delayed and the remarkable increase in the BSFC because of the lower cetane number of the fuel blends with higher alcohols. Rahimi and his coworkers [142] claimed some reasons for increasing the BSFC as follows. The initial one is the cetane number of the fuel. The alcohol in the fuel blend leads to a decrease in the cetane number of the fuel blend. The second one is the energy content of the fuel blends because it was influenced by the water content which was come from the nature of the alcohol. Yilmaz [143] noticed that the BSFC values of the fuel blends increased when the C1 alcohol (methanol) and C2 alcohol (ethanol) concentration increased in the blend. The researcher suggested some alterations to avoid some of the problems a bit. These are as follows: i) the better vaporization of the fuel samples could be supplied at the higher or full engine loads, ii) the air temperature has to be increased before the suction process. Candan et al. [138] monitored that the BSFC results of the methanol/diesel fuel blends rose about 4.43%-16.76% averagely as compared to the diesel fuel. It is well known and observed from Table 3 that the energy content of the 1-heptanol used in this study is higher than that of methanol. Overall, this work was validated with the aforementioned researches. 6.4.3 Brake specific energy consumption Brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) means the ratio of the energy got by consuming fuel for an hour to the generated unit brake power [22]. The difference from the BSFC, BSEC is the most precise parameter to compare the capability of any engine running on the different fuel samples having various energy contents as well as densities [144]. On the basis, BSEC immediately correlates with the BSFC results of the tested fuel samples. In summary, BSEC can be calculated using lower calorific value and BSFC value of any fuel sample. Namely, The BSEC values for all the tested fuels were found using Equation 36, shown underneath: (36) BSEC = CalorificvaluexFuelconsumption Outputpower The variation of BSEC results concerning the engine load for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and neat peanut oil biodiesel was depicted in Fig. 19 . As assumed, BSEC figures descended with the increase of engine load because similar inclinations were also obtained for BSFC as mentioned-above. Also, the BSEC figures are in agreement with the inverse profile of the BTE. In addition, it is noted to be that the BSEC figures for conventional diesel fuel are the lowest when compared to all of the tested fuel samples against all engine loads. Meanwhile, it is pronounced from the graph that biodiesel has the highest BSEC results due to the higher BSFC values and lower heating value along with worse atomization characteristics, extended ignition delay duration and higher flash point [105]. Nanthagopal and his coworkers [145] marked that the BSEC profiles were obtained as higher when the CI engine fuelled with neat Calophyllum Inophyllum oil biodiesel at all engine loads because of the integrated influence of BSFC and net calorific values of biodiesel. Venu [146], in their experimental study, found that jatropha oil biodiesel showed the largest BSEC as compared to the other tested fuel blends because the calorific value of the biodiesel was lower by 4.53% than that of diesel fuel. It can be attributed that the lower energy content and higher viscosity of biodiesel caused to poor fuel atomization process and drop the vaporization rate resulting in increasing the BSEC. At the maximum engine load, BSEC values for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and B100 were computed to be as 8.78 MJ/kWh, 8.90 MJ/kWh, 8.85 MJ/kWh, 8.94 MJ/kWh, and 10.29 MJ/kWh, respectively. At 100% engine load operating condition, an augmentation of 17.20% in BSEC was observed from peanut oil biodiesel to diesel fuel. It can be assigned to the lower energy content, higher viscosity and boiling point of the biodiesel fuel. A low concentration of biodiesel in diesel fuel caused to decline in BSEC. There is only 1.37% difference between B20 and diesel fuel because of the calorific value of the blend was close to the diesel fuel. In other words, the energy content of the B20 is 1.53% lower than that of diesel fuel as seen in Tables 3 and 5 which can explain the aforementioned increment. On correlating with pure biodiesel, BSEC value for B20 was reduced by 15.62% under the full load. Noteworthy, BSEC figures for B20 and Hp20 were appeared almost close to each other due to the calorific value of the 1-heptanol. As can be observed in Table 3, the calorific value of Hp20 is solely 1.05 MJ/kg lower than that of B20. Among the fuel blends, the highest BSEC values were obtained with the ternary blend. 6.4.4 Exhaust gas temperature The variation of exhaust gas temperature (EGT) according to the engine load for various tested fuel samples were illustrated in Fig. 20. The maximum EGT values of the tested fuel samples were observed at the full engine load operating condition. The peak EGT values for B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and neat peanut oil biodiesel were found to be at 221.71 °C, 215.14 °C, 215.26 °C, and 218.96 °C, respectively, while the minimum values were measured as 162.62 °C, 165.20 °C, 160.67 °C, and 159.02 °C, respectively. As observed, the highest EGT values were happened as 224.75 °C in diesel fuel. One of the most significant engine characteristics that affect the exhaust gas emissions is the EGT. In general, EGT varies dependent on the engine operating conditions (such as injection timing, injection pressure, compression ratio, etc.) and fuel characteristics (such as energy content, density, cetane number, viscosity, etc.) [138]. From the graph, there is no substantial difference between the experimental outcomes for the tested fuels. B20 and Hp20 exhibited almost similar results and lower than that of diesel fuel because of the lower heating values of the fuel samples. The alcohols can retract the heat from the ambient owing to having high latent heat of evaporation properties and hence EGT can slightly drop. Besides that, the addition of biodiesel into diesel fuel caused to decrease in the EGT. This can be explained as the end temperature of the combustion declines when the diesel engine running on the fuel sample which has a high oxygen concentration in the structure and less energy content. In other words, the high oxygen content in the fuel leads to a drop in EGT values by increasing the rate of combustion in comparison with diesel fuel [143,147]. Yesilyurt et al. [135] found that there is no substantial variations between the EGT figures of the fuel samples include diesel fuel/yellow mustard seed oil/1-butanol or n-pentanol. They determined that the peak EGT values for 1-butanol blends were between 648.48 °C and 654.8 °C and for n-pentanol blends were between 644.1 °C and 656.8 °C whereas for diesel fuel was 658.9 °C. Yılmaz [143] investigated the EGT data for biodiesel/diesel/ethanol or methanol mixtures and detected that there was no considerable variation between outcomes because of the lower concentration of alcohol infusion in the blend. Yılmaz et al. [148] implied that the addition of butyl alcohol into the diesel/biodiesel binary blend caused to mitigate the EGT at all loads because of the lower heating value and lesser cetane number of used alcohol. Suhami et al. [149] came across that the addition of 2-ethyl 1-hexanol alcohol to the traditional diesel fuel caused to decrease the EGT values slightly at lower loads. Anand et al. [150] reported that the usage of Karanja biodiesel blending with methanol in the diesel engine resulted in lower EGT in comparison with the pure biodiesel due to the fewer period of the combustion and lesser in-cylinder gas temperature. Li et al. [151] noticed the lower EGT figures when a newly developed single-cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine operating with alternative alcohol fuel. In contrast to the aforementioned literature, Aydın and İlkılıç [152] found higher EGT values when the diesel engine fuelled with 80% biodiesel + 20% ethanol blend. The researchers thought the reason as the improved combustion process inside the engine cylinder thanks to the excessive amount of the oxygen molecule coming from the ethanol. Yılmaz and Vigil [153] observed that the utilization of diesel/biodiesel/ethanol in the CI engine led to rising the EGT against 70% diesel fuel + %30 biodiesel blend. Yılmaz and Sanchez [154] analyzed the CI engine in terms of the EGT values for biodiesel/ethanol and biodiesel/methanol blends and the researchers coincided that the shortened combustion time could be the reason for observing higher EGTs. Hazar and Uyar [155] were to be noted that the EGT values for isopropyl alcohol/diesel fuel mixtures augmented when compared to diesel fuel owing to the higher oxygen amount of alcohol. 6.4.5 Volumetric efficiency Volumetric efficiency in the internal combustion engines can be described as the proportion of the mass density of the air–fuel mixture sucked into the combustion chamber of the cylinder at the atmospheric pressure during the intake stroke to the mass density of the identical volume of air in the intake manifold [105]. In other words, volumetric efficiency infers the breathing capability of any engine. The first characteristic may be influenced by several parameters such as intake gas temperature, pressure, pre-ignition, etc. The volumetric efficiency of the tested fuel samples across the engine loads has been exhibited in Fig. 21 . It can be observed from the graph that the volumetric efficiency reduced with the increase of the engine load because of the enhancement in the brake thermal efficiency at higher loads (as seen in Fig. 17). Due to the density of air at high temperatures, the high temperatures inside the engine cylinder limit the quantity of the air which can be compressed in the chamber of combustion. When the low load operating conditions were examined, the volumetric efficiency of all the fuel samples was found to be the highest values and closer to each of them. Namely, the volumetric efficiencies for diesel fuel, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and peanut oil biodiesel were calculated to be as 75.49%, 75.53%, 75.18%, 75.27%, and 75.31%, respectively. However, beyond the engine load of 50%, an improvement in the volumetric efficiency values were happened with the usage of biodiesel and fuel blends. In addition, it can be indicated that the combustion efficiency was improved due to the fact that the increase in volumetric efficiency values. As a result, the engine performance along with the exhaust gas temperature was improved. The volumetric efficiency reduces owing to the decline of the intake valve timing in the engine even though the aspiration process in the cylinder at which the velocity of air increase with the rise of engine load. Another factor that influences the volumetric efficiency of the engine is called as the exhaust gas temperature. The volumetric efficiency reduced when the exhaust gas temperature arrives at elevated temperatures because it may preheat the intake air. The ground for this is the decrease in the specific gravity of the absorbed matter depending on the increasing temperature and hence lesser flowing into the combustion chamber can be attained. The deep evaluation regarding the exhaust gas temperature can be appeared in the section 6.4.4. Briefly, the exhaust gas temperature of the fuel samples increased with the increase of the engine load and therefore, the volumetric efficiencies for the fuel samples slightly decreased."
12,Comparative assessment of present findings with recent studies,"Comparative analysis of the experimental outcomes from 1-heptanol with diesel fuel and peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel blend (lowest to highest) at the full load operating condition were tabulated in Table 10 . As observed from Table 10, the engine performance, exhaust gas emissions and combustion behavior of all the tested fuel samples have been compared in detail. All the parameters have been presented in the ascended order. Additionally, the results achieved from the present experimental investigation have been compared with some similar and earlier conducted researches and it has been summarized in Table 11 . The researches on the CI engine running on the binary blends of higher alcohol/biodiesel as well as ternary blends of higher alcohol/biodiesel/diesel fuel have been tabulated in order to better comprehension of this motivation. No wonder that several combinations of the fuel samples involve different higher alcohol such as butanol, pentanol, hexanol, decanol, etc. as an oxygenated fuel additive has been experimented by researchers, on the other hand, some of these studies could be considered for the comparison. Similar to the earlier researches, this present study figured out that the reformulated fuel samples by the addition of 1-heptanol with diesel fuel and peanut oil biodiesel/diesel fuel blend have led to declining the CO and unburned HC emissions especially while increase the CO2 emission. By all means, other emission behaviors with a significant change have been appeared in the engine specifications. However, the substantial increments were observed in the NOX emissions when using higher alcohol as an oxygenated additive. The combustion characteristics were obtained similar to those of other studies. It can be concluded that the findings have shown that the convenience of 1-heptanol as an additive into the diesel fuel as well as biodiesel/diesel fuel blend for the diesel engine without any major modifications. On one hand, it can be highlighted that many examinations should be performed by the researchers prior to acknowledging the 1-heptanol as a partial substitution for the CI engines by courtesy of the suitable technology footstep concerning the 1-heptanol production, preservation, handling, and other related subjects."
13,The cost analysis of peanut oil biodiesel,"To observe and understand the applicability and profitability of biodiesel fuel, there is necessary to implement a cost analysis. It is a strong technique for conditioning the competitiveness of peanut oil biodiesel opposes to fossil-based diesel fuel. The methyl ester conversion process consists of two principal subsections. These are as follows: i) the oil extraction process from peanuts applying a convenient method and ii) the production of biodiesel from the obtained crude oil. Biodiesel can be achieved by several techniques such as dilution, thermal cracking, micro emulsion, transesterification, etc. Among the production methods, the transesterification process is the most preferred technique [159]. In the present study, peanut oil was bought from a local company as mentioned above. The cost of oil is $1.58/L. The cost of raw material to produce biodiesel fuel is one of the most substantial participants. In other words, it has been predicted from various researchers [26,160] that the cost of raw material has effectuated regarding 70–80% of the overall cost of the biodiesel production. The total cost of the produced biodiesel was obtained as about $2.08/L once whole prices like alcohol, catalyst, electricity, water, etc. were added. The cost of peanut oil composed to 75.96% in terms of the total cost of biodiesel. It can be also validated with the aforementioned results. At present, conventional diesel fuel has been sold $1.13/L in our country. Table 12 shows the comparison of the production cost of the biodiesel fuels obtained from various raw materials. As observed, the cost of peanut oil biodiesel fuel is still higher than that of petroleum-based diesel fuel. So that biodiesel is tax-favored for the promotional objective in various countries [161]. In this respect, the legal arrangements should be conducted by the government to increase the production of biodiesel in Turkey. Besides, the oilseed crops production should be supported, the drylands should be evaluated for the production of arid tolerance oilseed crops. As mentioned above, the taxes have to be free for the selling of biodiesel. By the way, the apprehensions of the farmers must be removed at the point of the oilseed production [167]. Indeed, the countries have commonly used soybean oil, karanja oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil, palm oil, cottonseed oil, and rapeseed oil to produce biodiesel [168–170]. As far as the researcher knows that the biodiesel production from peanut oil on a commercial scale has not been noted before. The aforementioned information indicated that the cost of peanut oil is the largest constituent in the biodiesel price. By all means, this price may be decreased by dint of a higher harvesting proportion of peanut plants by producers or by ensuring larger amounts. Actually, the peanut oil biodiesel is an encouraging candidate for the CI engine applications. It can contest with the traditional diesel fuel if the peanut oil might be lower than $0.90/L. This case should not be difficult for Turkey for more than 160 thousand tons of peanut were harvested in 2019 [171]."
14,Conclusion,"In the present experimental study, the effects of 1-heptanol (C7 alcohol) with diesel fuel and peanut oil methyl ester/diesel fuel blend on the CI engine performance, exhaust gas emissions, and combustion behavior at different engine loads (from 25% to 100%) under a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm have been comprehensively investigated and the findings have been compared with traditional diesel fuel as well as neat biodiesel. As a result, the following important outcomes are obtained from this work; 1. In general, the addition of higher alcohol into the diesel fuel and biodiesel/diesel fuel blend leads to a longer ID period due to the lower cetane number of the 1-heptanol. Because the lower cetane number affects the self-ignition features that cause extended ID duration. 2. All of the binary and ternary blends showed higher peak in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate than that of pure peanut oil biodiesel because of their higher oxygen amounts in the chemical structure and energy contents. 3. The RI figures increased when the engine load was increased. In this study, the maximum RI values for diesel fuel, Hp20, B20, B20Hp20, and B100 were calculated to be as 3.37 MW/m2, 3.17 MW/m2, 3.05 MW/m2, 2.95 MW/m2, and 1.82 MW/m2, respectively. The peak values were obtained with neat diesel fuel because of its high HRR results while the infusion of biodiesel to the diesel fuel supplied to drop the RI values due to the lubricity behavior of the biodiesel. 4. The addition of 1-heptanol to diesel and B20 increased unburned HC emissions as compared to neat peanut oil biodiesel (which demonstrated the lowest HC emission) owing to the lower cetane number resulting in poor self-ignition properties. Consequently, it causes the cooling effect in the leaner mixture region inside the engine cylinder. 5. On the other hand, 1-heptanol binary and ternary blends decreased the NOX emissions as compared to neat peanut oil biodiesel whereas the diesel fuel showed the least NOX emissions among the fuel samples. B20Hp20 was found to be the best choice in terms of NOX reduction. It is to be noticed that the higher latent heat of evaporation of the blends is an important parameter to decline that leads to a quenching influence in the chamber of the combustion by dropping the in-cylinder temperature. 6. The CO emission of the binary and ternary fuel blends were observed lower than that of diesel fuel and followed from lowest to highest at the full load operating condition an order of B100 (3.591 g/kWh) < B20Hp20 (4.297 g/kWh) < Hp20 (4.309 g/kWh) < B20 (4.668 g/kWh) < D100 (6.015 g/kWh). As appeared, the CO emissions of the fuel blends were obtained higher than that of neat peanut oil biodiesel. This is due to the poor evaporation and auto-ignition characteristics of the blends resulting in an incomplete combustion process in the cylinder. 7. At 100% load, the CO2 emissions for D100, B20, Hp20, B20Hp20, and B100 were measured to be as 178.35 g/kWh, 181.37 g/kWh, 183.10 g/kWh, 187.06 g/kWh, and 227.54 g/kWh, respectively. 1-heptanol due to its native oxygen molecules in the chemical bonds has reacted with CO molecules and forms CO2 molecules. Thus, it has a significant impact on the generation of CO2 emissions. 8. The binary blend of 1-heptanol/diesel fuel and the ternary blend of 1-heptanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel resulted in lesser BTE in comparison with those of biodiesel and diesel fuel since their calorific values were lower than that of diesel fuel. However, the excess amount of oxygen content causes the enhanced combustion process inside the cylinder. The diesel fuel exhibited the highest BTE at all engine loads among the fuel samples while the peanut oil biodiesel showed the least BTE values. 9. The blending of 1-heptanol with diesel fuel and B20 blend leads to an increase in the BSFC and BSEC owing to the reduction in the energy content of the blend. 10. The EGT values decline slightly when the diesel engine fuelled with 1-heptanol treated fuel blends as compared to diesel fuel. This can be explained by the alcohol may withdraw the heat from the ambient because of having high latent heat of evaporation characteristic and hence, EGT drops. 11. Briefly, it is recommended that the 1-heptanol can be utilized as an appropriate oxygenated fuel additive to the diesel fuel and pure peanut oil biodiesel owing to its preferable characteristics which improved some of the engine performance, exhaust gas emission, and combustion characteristics in the diesel engine applications. According to the whole experimental findings of the present experimental work, the peanut oil biodiesel, biodiesel/diesel fuel blend, 1-heptanol/diesel fuel blend and the ternary fuel blend of biodiesel/1-heptanol/diesel fuel could be tested in the single-cylinder, four-stroke, DI diesel engine without any modifications on the test engine. 1-heptanol is a powerful oxygenated additive because of the above-mentioned many significant advantages. But, the price of the 1-heptanol is the major problem and therefore, this case should be solved before using this alcohol in the engine. In further studies, the other higher alcohols (octanol, hexanol, decanol, etc.) can be used in the diesel engine as a fuel additive. Similar examinations can be performed with various diesel engines and vehicle engines to generalize the outcomes. Besides that, the engine operating conditions like injection timing, injection pressure, compression ratio, engine speed, etc. can be modified and the findings can be compared. Furthermore, energy, exergy, environmental and economic analyses can be implemented to the CI engine operating with alcohol-treated fuel blends in order to get accurate results."
