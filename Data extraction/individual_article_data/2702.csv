0,Introduction,"Recently hydrogen (H2) received extensive consideration as a clean energy source through fuel cell applications [1–4]. However, global capacity relating to H2 storage and distribution infrastructure is not yet established; it remains one of the greatest factors impeding the development of a H2 energy economy [5,6]. Hydrogen also supports a low volumetric energy density. Hydrogen dense energy carriers such as ammonia (NH3), methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (CH3OH) are thus suitable for transport and on-site H2 generation [1–4,6–9]. On the other hand, a recent universal trend has shaped to distance from fossil fuels and carbon-containing compounds for power generation [10,11]. As a carbon-free energy carrier, NH3 is a particularly attractive option for H2 generation as it supports a hydrogen density of 108.5 kg m−3 at 8.57 bara (saturated liquid at 20 °C) [12]. Also, NH3 has a large global production capacity of 100 million tons y−1 [5]. The process of NH3 decomposition (often called reforming) produces H2 through a slightly endothermic reaction (reaction 1). This reaction takes place over a suitable catalyst (Ru or Ni) at temperatures of 500–700 °C [13]. (1) 2 NH 3 → N 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 46 kJ mol − 1 (2) 4 NH 3 + 3 O 2 → 2 N 2 + 6 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 317 kJ mol − 1 (3) 2 NH 3 + 2 O 2 → N 2 O + 3 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 276 kJ mol − 1 (4) 4 NH 3 + 5 O 2 → 4 NO + 6 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 226 kJ mol − 1 Although NH3 decomposition is a convenient process for on-site H2 generation, the endothermicity of reaction makes it dependent on a heat source [14]. As such, self-sustained (autothermal) reactor operation is necessary for independent and continuous H2 supply in off-grid locations [13,15]. Thermal coupling of chemical processes is well-known and a powerful tool to increase process efficiency and reduce equipment size and cost [16]. To simplify logistical issues, NH3 oxidation is considered to supply in the thermal requirements of the decomposition reaction. Consequently, a single transported fuel is required for H2 generation. Ammonia oxidation (reaction 2) is a viable heat source, as atmospheric nitrogen (N2) and water are the main product species. Other possible oxidation products include nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) through reactions 3–4, however not desired in this application. Heat supply from NH3 oxidation/combustion is sustainable and may take place homogeneously (flame) or catalytically. The simplicity of homogeneous combustion is an attractive prospect to satisfy thermal requirements. However, to achieve improved heat and mass transfer in small-to-medium-scale H2 generation applications, homogeneous combustion may be susceptible to thermal and radical quenching [2,17,18]. In contrast, catalytic combustion supports broader operating limits and has the ability to improve fuel conversion at much lower reaction temperatures [16,18,19]. Material and catalyst stability is therefore sustainable at realistic flow velocities. In previous studies, lower reactor temperatures and using N2 selective catalysts (e.g. Pt/Al2O3) proved to significantly reduce N2O and NOx formation [20,21]. Furthermore, fuel rich conditions influence thermodynamic equilibrium in favor of N2 formation through so-called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reactions [10,11,20]. To achieve distributed H2 generation through NH3 reforming, compact reactor setups are necessary. Also, an efficient thermal coupling between the endothermic NH3 decomposition and exothermic NH3 oxidation reaction is pre-requisite [2,19]. Microchannel reactor technology is easily scaled to desired generation capacity, and proves convenient when incorporated in modularized plants [14,18,19]. These reactors have characteristic small diffusion paths and essentially support fast reaction rates through process intensification [16,22]. A central heat-conducting plate is characteristic between spatially coupled microchannels [19]. A wide range of process conditions, reactions, catalysts and flow configuration (co-, counter- and cross-flow) contribute to the multi-functionality of these reactors [23]. The use of cocurrent flow configurations proved beneficial in the coupling with a highly exothermic reaction [17,24]. Enhanced heat transfer was achieved at the reactor inlet region where high reaction rates dominate. Similar thermal behavior is envisioned in the coupling with the highly exothermic NH3 oxidation reaction. Autothermal NH3 decomposition in a microchannel reactor was the focus of previous modeling studies [17,18,25–27]. In all these studies, the oxidation of hydrocarbons is considered as the heat source. An experimental study was reported on NH3 decomposition in a microchannel reactor, in which catalytic butane combustion provided in thermal requirements [28]. Although hydrocarbon combustion provides as a reliable heat source, CO2 is formed and considered an unfavorable by-product [6,11]. Other studies have focused on the reforming of methanol [23,29–35], methane [14,15,19,24,36–47], ethane [16,48] and iso-octane [49] as fuel in reactor-heat exchangers, but not discussed further in this work. Recent work published by our research group [20] investigated coupled NH3 decomposition and oxidation as an effective autothermal operating strategy. A significant improvement on the thermal efficiency of electrically heated reactors (25.5% [50]) was obtained (57.3%). However, due to the small reactor size tested (45 We), the necessity exists to ascertain NH3 as fuel for H2 generation technology at increased volumetric throughput. Also, due to the high surface to volume ratio typical of the miniaturized reactor, the thermal efficiency can be increased further, when heat loss is reduced in an upscaled reactor. This work is therefore a continuation of the work previously reported by Chiuta et al. [20]. Specifically, the objective of this study is to assess the performance of an upscaled (theoretical 1 kWe) autothermal reactor for NH3 decomposition. This reactor development and testing provides a basis for multi-kW H2 power generation systems which can be commercialized. The effect of NH3 decomposition flow rate, oxidation flow rate and fuel-oxygen equivalence ratio is investigated in order to identify operating parameters associated with improved steady-state conversion, H2 production rate and reactor efficiency. In addition, transient reactor behavior is characterized to conclude on overall reactor performance."
1,Methodology,
2,Reactor design,"2.1 Reactor design The microchannel reactor was designed and fabricated in collaboration with Fraunhofer-ICT-IMM (Mainz, Germany). To accommodate enhanced thermal-coupling between reactions the microchannel reactor was designed as stacked, alternating catalytic plates of oxidation and decomposition reaction zones (identical geometry) [51]. Each double-sided microstructured plate (stainless steel 310, German classification 1.4841) was chemically etched with 50 microchannels (W = 500 μm, H = 250 μm and L = 10 cm) on both sides of the plate (Fig. 1 ) [52]. These plates were stacked in a face-to-face arrangement for oxidation and decomposition, respectively. Finally, two stacks of plates, each with 17 double-sided and two one-sided microstructured plates, one for decomposition and one for oxidation, were separated by a central plate incorporating ten evenly spaced 0.6 mm bores for thermocouples (Fig. 2 ). These plates were laser-welded into a compact stack, to which was added gas diffusers and inlet and outlet tubing (OD = ¼ inch). In total, the reactor consisted of 1800 oxidation and 1800 decomposition microchannels. For the purpose of reactor start-up, a heating block incorporating four heating cartridges (300 W, Watlow FIREROD®) with integrated K-type thermocouples was supplied with the reactor."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation As in our recent work on autothermal NH3 decomposition [20,53], we selected a commercial 8.5 wt.% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (Hypermec, 10010™) for NH3 decomposition and a 5 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (Sigma-Aldrich, 205974) for the NH3 oxidation reaction. These catalysts have BET surface areas of 113 m2 g−1 and 134.7 m2 g−1, respectively. Chiuta et al. [50] showed that Ru catalyst performance is significantly better than a commercial Ni catalyst for NH3 decomposition, thus its use in this work. The Pt catalyst was selected as it is a versatile and active catalyst for various oxidation reactions [32,47,54–56]. Identical deposition methods were followed for both these catalysts. The catalysts were milled to the desired particle size before commencing with the washcoating procedure. A chemical binder, polyvinyl alcohol, was dissolved in deionized water and the solution was stirred for 2 h at 65 °C. The solution was left to stand overnight, without stirring. The catalyst powder and acetic acid were then added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h at 65 °C. Stirring was continued for approximately 72 h to release all air bubbles and to obtain a homogeneous catalyst suspension. The microchannels were filled with the mixture before any excess suspension was removed. The catalyst was dried at ambient temperature before calcination in air was initiated at 450 °C for 6 h. A second calcination step was repeated at the same conditions. This deposition method is a slight modification to the original procedure described in Ref. [57]. In total, the microchannel reactor contained 3077 mg of the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst and 3193 mg of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The final catalyst washcoat thickness was approximately 45 μm. By calculating the Damköhler number, Chiuta et al. [58] showed that washcoats thicker than 40 μm might be susceptible to diffusion limitations, at excessively high temperatures (>700 °C)."
4,Experimental apparatus,"2.3 Experimental apparatus The supply of anhydrous NH3 (99.99%) was split via a T-piece to both reaction chambers. Pure NH3 was supplied to the decomposition side, while a mixture of NH3 and O2 (99.99%) was fed to the oxidation side. These gases were regulated by respective Brooks SLA5850 thermal mass flow controllers. In addition, N2 was connected via a 3-way valve to the NH3 supply line for the reactor start-up and cooldown procedures. Two Watlow FIREROD® heating cartridges (300 W each) were used for the sole purpose of reactor start-up before autothermal operation was initiated. Ten K-type thermocouples (0.5 mm OD) were placed uniformly along the axial length of the reactor (Fig. 2) to determine the reactor temperature profile. An AT9000 differential pressure transmitter was used for pressure drop measurements. The composition of the reformate gas was analyzed downstream of the reformer using a SRI8610C gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with two thermal conductivity detectors and one helium ionization detector. The total flow rate of the reformate gas was measured with a Bronkhorst® (EL-flow) mass flow meter. On the oxidation side, a water bath was used to cool the product gas. The condensate was separated from the fuel gas and collected in a round bottom flask. At the recommended operating point, the flue gas composition was analyzed using the GC."
5,Experimental procedure,"2.4 Experimental procedure Reactor start-up involved a heating procedure (approximately 45 min) using the heating cartridges to reach a light-off temperature (300 °C) for the oxidation reaction. During both the start-up and cooldown procedures, a flow of N2 (1 NL min−1) was used in the decomposition and in the oxidation reaction zones to prevent thermal sintering of the catalysts. Once 300 °C was reached, the operational flow rates were fixed for NH3 decomposition and oxidation, and the heating cartridges were switched off. National Instruments™ LabVIEW software was used to control all flow controllers and log data in 1-min intervals. The mass flow measurements and thermocouple readings (ten) were recorded. Decomposition product gas samples were analyzed after 15 min and thereafter in 30-min intervals after initiation of autothermal operation. Daily experiments, lasting a total of 6 h (continuous hours), were conducted to obtain one steady-state experimental data point. Approximately 280 h of experimental work was conducted at NH3 decomposition flow rates corresponding to 2–8 NL min−1. Depending on the decomposition flow rate, the total oxidation flow was varied in a range of 1–4 NL min−1 to restrict the maximum reactor temperature exceeding 650 °C (defined as the material stability limit). This limit is established as the maximum working temperature due to the nature of the corrosive (NH3) and oxidising (O2) environments that exist during reactor operation. More details regarding this limit are presented in the recent paper of Chiuta & Bessarabov [20]. The fuel-oxygen equivalence ratio (eq. (5)) was varied between values of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6, for all flow conditions. This parameter is defined as the ratio of ammonia fuel to oxygen relative to the average stoichiometric ratio of reactions (2–4). Finally, to investigate reactor performance stability, a continuous 24 h experiment was conducted at conditions corresponding to a decomposition flow rate of 8 NL min−1, oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1, and equivalence ratio of 1.4.

6,Results and discussion,"The experimental results pertaining to transient and steady-state reactor operation are now described. The reactor performance stability and recommended operating conditions are also discussed. The reactor performance is assessed on parameters including the NH3 decomposition conversion (eq. (6)), H2 equivalent fuel cell power output (eq. (7)), and reactor thermal efficiency (eq. (8)). For these calculations a PEM fuel cell efficiency ( η P E M ) of 60%, H2 utilization rate ( θ P E M ) of 80%, and lower heating values of 120.0 and 18.6 MJ kg−1 for H2 and NH3, respectively, are assumed.

7,Transient operating regime,"3.1 Transient operating regime The dynamics of autothermal reactor operation is illustrated in Fig. 3 for an NH3 decomposition flow rate of 6 NL min−1, NH3 oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1, and fuel-oxygen equivalence ratio of 1.4. This dynamic operating regime is a result of switching from the inert N2 flow to the respective reactants for the decomposition and oxidation reactions. As soon as these flows are introduced to the reactor, the temperature increases sharply at the reactor inlet (thermocouple 1) due to the extent of the exothermic oxidation reaction (Fig. 3a). A temperature of 454 °C is recorded within 2 min at the first thermocouple position. Thereafter, the temperature profile across the reactor increases steadily as a result of continual surplus heat supply by the oxidation reaction. An interesting observation is that the downstream reactor temperature (thermocouple 10) shows a time lag; it is initially slow to respond to transient operation being initiated. The inlet and downstream reactor temperatures thus exhibit response times on different time-scales, characteristic of different orders of magnitude in reaction rates, at these positions. In effect, heat transfer is shown to be more significant in the coupling with the decomposition reaction (transverse direction), compared to heat flow in the axial direction. As the reactor temperature increases, progressively more heat is consumed by the endothermic decomposition reaction, promoting H2 formation (Fig. 3b). About 95% of steady-state conversion values is achieved within 60 min after initiation. This transient behaviour is observed for all flow conditions investigated. Close to steady-state operation is obtained after approximately 180 min time on stream. At steady-state, a temperature drop of 118 °C is obtained, comparing measurements from thermocouples 1 and 10. The lower downstream reactor temperature is thus a reflection of the slow oxidation rate attained in this region. Theoretically, the energy balance, comprising reaction heat generation and consumption, heat loss, and gas enthalpies at the reactor inlets and outlets, is balanced at steady-state."
8,Steady-state reactor performance,"3.2 Steady-state reactor performance 3.2.1 Effect of decomposition and oxidation flow rates The effects of NH3 decomposition flow rate (2–8 NL min−1) and NH3 oxidation flow rate (1–4 NL min−1) on steady-state measurements for the maximum reactor temperature (measured at the reactor inlet) and NH3 decomposition conversion are shown in Fig. 4 for an equivalence ratio of 1.4. With increasing decomposition flow, the maximum reactor temperature decreases as a result of increased heat consumption in the decomposition chamber (Fig. 4a). For the purposes of comparison, consider a decomposition flow rate of 6 NL min−1 and oxidation flow rate of 3 NL min−1. Here, a maximum reactor temperature of 604 °C is noted. However, when a decomposition flow rate of 8 NL min−1 (33.3% increase in flow) is used at the same oxidation flow, the temperature decreases by 58 °C, to 546 °C. Although the decomposition reaction is only mildly endothermic, the increased enthalpy requirement also consumes heat and reduces the steady-state temperature. The corresponding NH3 conversion under these flow conditions decreases from 89.4% to 58.9%. Generally the NH3 decomposition conversion (Fig. 4b) shows strong correlation to the maximum reactor temperature for the corresponding oxidation flow rates. Overall, the pressure drop across the decomposition chamber varied in a range of 1.3–11.8 kPa, depending on the specific flow condition investigated. Overall, an increase in oxidation flow results in significant increases in maximum reactor temperature at constant decomposition flow rates. For comparison, if a 33.3% increase in oxidation flow (from 3 to 4 NL min−1) is considered at a decomposition flow rate of 6 NL min−1, the maximum reactor temperature increases by 47 °C, to 651 °C. With respect to operability limits, the oxidation reaction is thus restricted to narrow flow ranges for reasonable decomposition flows (6–8 NL min−1) due to the large exotherm of the oxidation reaction. As a result, flow ranges (for both reactions) that provide satisfactory reactor performance are identified for sustainable reactor operation. Conditions corresponding to a decomposition flow rate of 6 NL min−1 and oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1 come close to satisfying the constraints of material stability. Under these flow conditions, an NH3 conversion of 99.8% is achieved (Fig. 4b). In an effort to increase reactor throughput, decomposition flow rates of 7–8 NL min−1 and an oxidation flow of 5 NL min−1 were investigated to increase NH3 conversion greater than the breakthrough limit (99%) towards H2 production. For these conditions, an increase in temperature at the reactor inlet (to 680 °C, beyond the limit of material stability) within 60 min is observed. This sharp increase in temperature is a result of excess heat produced in the reactor that is not utilized by the endothermic decomposition reaction. Operational considerations associated with flame/homogeneous oxidation should be in place as this reaction might propagate beyond the catalyst washcoat and ultimately outside the reactor's inlet distribution manifold. This observation is crucial as the fuel-oxygen feed ratio is within the flammability limits of NH3. The material stability limit (650 °C) associated with a slight red glow of the stainless steel substrate at the reactor inlet is therefore maintained. Although the maximum power output recorded (832 We) is obtained for a decomposition flow rate of 8 NL min−1 and oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1, an undesirable NH3 conversion (86.9%) is achieved for this flow condition. The power output is noticeably lower than the theoretical maximum calculated for 100% conversion (Fig. 5 a). Again, the maximum decomposition flow rate that provides satisfactory reactor performance is 6 NL min−1 at an oxidation flow of 4 NL min−1. A H2 equivalent fuel cell power output of 716 We is obtained, which is close to that of the theoretical maximum (708.5 We). This flow condition also produces the highest thermal efficiency of 75.9% (Fig. 5b). Although the flow condition corresponding to a decomposition flow of 8 NL min−1 and oxidation flow of 4 NL min−1 provides a higher H2 throughput, the thermal efficiency is lower (71.1%) as a result of excess NH3 (7 vol.%) observed in the product gas, which is not decomposed to form H2. The residual NH3 content in the feedstock to PEM fuel cells is imperative as fuel cell performance will deteriorate considerably in the presence of NH3. Some sources even report a decrease in fuel cell catalyst activity at NH3 levels as low as 1 ppm over a one-week period [59]. The decrease in activity is attributed to the alkaline nature of NH3 at the fuel cell anode. Formed NH4 + ions react with sulphonic (SO3 −) groups, characteristic of Nafion® fuel cell membranes. Consequently, the membrane water content and conductivity decreases, leading to diminishing fuel cell performance [60,61]. Although the NH4 + ions are expected to affect the anode side the most, diffusion of NH4 + ions to the cathode side is also noteworthy as membranes are typically only 10–100 μm thick [59]. Although substantial poisoning effects is observed with NH3 in anode feed gas, studies have shown that fuel cell performance is recoverable with time (in the order of days) when a neat feed of H2 is introduced to the anode [60,62]. 3.2.2 Effect of fuel-oxygen feed ratio The effect of a variation in the fuel-oxygen equivalence ratio (eq. (5)) on the maximum reactor temperature and NH3 decomposition conversion is illustrated in Fig. 6 . Constant feed ratios of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 are considered, for decomposition flow rates of 6–8 NL min−1 and an oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1. First, an increase in the maximum reactor temperature is observed when the equivalence ratio is decreased from 1.4 to 1.2. As a result, similar increases in NH3 conversion are obtained for all flow conditions presented. For the decomposition flow condition of 8 NL min−1 and 4 NL min−1 oxidation flow, the temperature increases from 631 °C to 637 °C. The corresponding NH3 conversion also shows an increase, from 86.9% to 91.6%, when the equivalence ratio is reduced. This increase in reactor performance is due to the equivalence ratio being closer to the stoichiometric feed conditions for the oxidation reactions. Specifically, more O2 is available for reaction and therefore more heat is released into the reactor system. Although better reactor performance is achieved, the formation of NO2 is visually observed in the condensing flask. The formation of NO2 takes place via reaction 4, after which NO oxidises to NO2 in the presence of O2. From the stoichiometry of this reaction, it is evident that an increased O2 feed fraction will promote this reaction. Similar observations were made in our previous work for fuel-lean feed mixtures [20]. Besides identifying good reactor performance, considerations regarding flue gas are also essential. Nitric oxide and NO2 are highly toxic gases. Reactor operation at the 1.2 fuel-oxygen equivalence ratio is therefore not recommended. In contrast, when the equivalence ratio is increased from 1.4 to 1.6, the maximum reactor temperature and NH3 conversion decreases for all flow conditions considered here. This observation is a result of less heat provided to the reactor, as the imbalance of NH3 to O2 is enlarged. For comparison the 8 NL min−1 decomposition flow and 4 NL min−1 oxidation flow condition yields a maximum reactor temperature of 593 °C, which is 38 °C lower than in the case of the 1.4 equivalence ratio data point. The corresponding NH3 conversion also shows a reduction of 8.1%, to 78.8%. A decreasing effect on the reactor thermal efficiency is evident as more NH3 is fed to the reactor on the oxidation side, while less H2 is produced through decomposition. From an operational perspective, the 1.6 equivalence ratio manipulated thermodynamic equilibrium in favor of N2 formation through SCR reactions [10,11,20]. As a result, little to no NO2 formation is visually observed for all flow conditions, yet the reactor performance is not as enhanced as in the cases of the 1.2 or 1.4 equivalence ratios."
9,Performance stability test,"3.3 Performance stability test A 24 h stability test was performed at conditions corresponding to a decomposition flow rate of 8 NL min−1, oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1 and equivalence ratio of 1.4. These flow rates are the highest flows investigated here for NH3 decomposition and oxidation, respectively. They were selected to introduce demanding reactor conditions. This test was carried out in an effort to determine any inconsistencies in catalyst and material stability, over an extended test period, which may cause decreased steady-state reactor temperature and NH3 conversion. Results of the maximum reactor temperature and NH3 conversion (Fig. 7 ) show that no detectable catalyst deactivation occurs during testing. On the contrary, the temperature varies in a range of 625–632 °C and NH3 conversion increases steadily up to 90.9% over the 24 h period. Some temperature variations is attributed to natural fluctuations, especially as the temperature at the reactor inlet is observed to be very sensitive, due to high reaction rates occurring in this region. The slight increase in NH3 conversion is credited to the outlet reactor temperature, which exhibits a much slower response time from the start of the stability test. This phenomenon is discussed in section 3.1 (for Fig. 3a). On conclusion of the test, the reactor was visually inspected, and no structural defects were observed."
10,Recommended operating conditions,"3.4 Recommended operating conditions A summary of reactor specifications and recommended operating conditions are tabulated in Table 1 . The recommended operating point identified which closely satisfies the limit of material stability and supports good NH3 conversion is a decomposition flow rate of 6 NL min−1, oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1, and equivalence ratio of 1.4. For these conditions the NH3 conversion obtained is 99.8%. The reactor also shows high throughput with a H2 equivalent fuel cell power output of 0.71 kWe (8.92 NL min−1 H2). Furthermore, the thermal efficiency obtained (75.9%) is substantially higher than that (57.3%) attained by Chiuta & Bessarabov [20] during the first generation autothermal reactor testing. In their work the recommended operating point gives only 45 We power output. The improvement in reactor efficiency is largely due to the increased reactor volume vs outer surface area exposed to the insulation material. Heat losses are subsequently minimized and more heat is now utilized in the thermal coupling of the oxidation and decomposition reactions. The NH3 conversion obtained here allows for an NH3 outlet concentration of 680 ppm. However, this concentration of NH3 is still beyond the limit of PEM fuel cell tolerance. As mentioned by Refs. [20,63], alkaline fuel cells are resistant towards reasonable traces of NH3 in H2 supply streams, and in this case a viable power generation technology. Should the aim be to utilize PEM fuel cells, it is recommended that a H2 selective membrane is used to purify feed streams to NH3 concentrations below an acceptable limit for fuel cell operation (<1 ppm) [59]. For large-scale implementation of PEM fuel cells, a H2 purification method such as pressure swing adsorption is useful as an existing technology that can be utilized, with low operating costs associated. These purification methods will ensure long-term fuel cell catalyst activity for sustainable power supply. Although the aim of this work was to characterize the performance of the reactor based on the NH3 reforming reaction, considerations regarding the flue gas composition from the oxidation chamber is also noteworthy. Firstly, equilibrium data is calculated in AspenPlus™ using the Gibbs free energy minimization technique with the Peng-Robinson fluid property package. The downstream reactor temperature (530 °C) is used in equilibrium calculations, as it will most likely determine final product composition. At the recommended operating point, it is evident that the majority of excess NH3 is decomposed to form H2 on the Pt catalyst (Table 2 ). Note however that the data is presented on a dry basis (db), enlarging the percentile composition of dry gases. The other major component of the flue gas is N2, produced mainly through reaction 2, and also the decomposition reaction (reaction 1). The Pt catalyst shows to be selective towards N2 production with other products, i.e. N2O and NOx, in minority (summation < 3%). However, to quantify NO and NO2 proved elusive with the GC, as these gases are problematic to separate."
11,Conclusions,"A microchannel reactor was developed and tested for H2 production through the NH3 decomposition reaction. The reactor was designed as alternating catalytic plates which allowed for an autothermal (self-sufficient) heating approach through a secondary NH3 oxidation reaction. The reactor showed rapid temperature response during start-up and was able to produce significant H2 flow after 60 min of operation, compared to steady-state values. A recommended operating point was identified which closely satisfied the limit of material stability, yet provided satisfactory performance in terms of NH3 conversion and H2 throughput. A conversion of 99.8% was achieved with a H2 equivalent fuel cell power output of 0.71 kWe at conditions corresponding to a decomposition flow rate of 6 NL min−1, oxidation flow rate of 4 NL min−1, and fuel-oxygen equivalence ratio of 1.4. Although good reactor performance was achieved, residual NH3 concentrations are such that a H2 purification step should be established to prevent fuel cell catalyst degradation in a practical scenario. The work described in this paper nonetheless demonstrated that increased H2 generation from NH3 decomposition is viable through a highly efficient process. As a result, this work introduces groundwork for self-sufficient multi-kW power generation systems suitable for commercial implementation."
