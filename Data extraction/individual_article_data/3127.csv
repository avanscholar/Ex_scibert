0,Introduction,"With the depleting of oil reserves, the demand for an alternative liquid transportation fuel is becoming increasingly apparent [1]. Biomass is the only renewable source of energy that can be converted into liquid fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass is abundant, and it has the potential to significantly replace petroleum in the production of fuels for the transportation sector [2]. Multiple conversion routes for biomass conversion to liquid transportation fuels have been considered [3]. Fast pyrolysis of biomass is a feasible route to convert biomass into liquid fuels [4]. Depending on the biomass composition and operational condition, the yield of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis varied in the range of 60–80wt% [5]. However, unlike petroleum, bio-oil exhibited undesirable properties such as high viscosity, high corrosiveness, low heating value, and instability. It is widely accepted that bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of biomass cannot be considered as a realistic candidate for large scale liquid transport fuel substitution unless it is upgraded [6]. The oxygen content of bio-oil can be as high as 40%, which was once considered as the main reason for its undesirable properties [7]. Two catalytic upgrading methods including hydrodeoxygenation [8] and catalytic cracking [9,10] have been applied to remove the oxygen from bio-oil. However, these two upgrading methods were characterized by low liquid yield and severe catalysts deactivation. On the other hand, the oxygen content in bio-oil does not necessarily to be completely removed. Some oxygenated organics such as ethanol, butanol, and bio-diesel have been applied as transportation fuels. Besides, the cost can be reduced by converting bio-oil into stable and combustible oxygenated organics as less H2 was consumed. Therefore, alcohols and esters, which are stable and combustible oxygenated organics, were regarded as the desired products in this paper. Due to the complexity of bio-oil, most of the work focused on the conversion of model compounds. Bio-oil is composed of more than 400 compounds, including acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, esters, phenols, and ethers [11]. The undesirable properties of bio-oil are correlated with certain types of compounds. Acids contribute to the corrosiveness of bio-oil, and the instability of bio-oil is mainly caused by aldehydes and phenols. Hence, acids, aldehydes, and phenols should be removed in the final product. Aldehydes and phenols can be converted into stable oxygenated organics by hydrogenation [12]. Esterification is an effective method to convert acids in bio-oil into more stable esters [13,14]. However, in previous papers, most of the studies focused on single model compound, while the simultaneous conversions of different types of compounds were still to be studied. Zheng et al. [15–18] combined hydrogenation of aldehydes and esterification of acids to convert aldehydes and acids into alcohols and esters. However, in their work, aldehydes, phenols, and acids could not be simultaneously converted. In this paper, n-butanal, phenol, and acetic acid were selected as representatives of aldehydes, phenols, and acids, respectively. Four different groups of reactions: hydrogenation of n-butanal to n-butanol, hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol, esterification of n-butanol and acetic acid, and esterification of cyclohexanol and acetic acid were carried out separately to verify the possibility of hydrogenation–esterification of aldehydes, phenols, and acids. Pt/C, Pd/C, and Ru/C were used for hydrogenation as they were generally known as hydrogenation catalysts [19,20]. Acid catalysts SO4 2 −/ZrO2/SBA-15 and HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios (25, 50, and 100) were employed in the esterification reactions. Based on the results of SHE, one-pot hydrogenation–esterification reactions (OHE) of n-butanal, acetic acid, and phenol were carried out. Physically mixed catalysts and bifunctional catalysts were tested and a comparison was made between OHE and SHE."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials SBA-15, sulfuric acid, zirconium nitrate pentahydrate (Zr(NO3)4 5H2O), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were purchased to prepare acid catalyst SO4 2 −/ZrO2/SBA-15 (denoted as SZr). SZr and HZSM-5 (acid catalysts) with different Si/Al ratios were employed as the catalysts for esterification, while commercial Ru/C, Pt/C, and Pd/C were used as hydrogenation catalysts. RuCl3 ·3H2O was used as the Ru precursor of bifunctional catalysts. Phenol (99.0%), acetic acid (99.5%) and n-butanal (98.0%) were used as reactants and n-hexane (97.0%) was employed as the reaction solvent. Cyclohexanol (99.0%), n-butanol (99.9%), butyl acetate (99.7%), and cyclohexyl acetate (99.0%) were employed as standards. All chemicals were commercially available and used without further treatment."
3,Catalysts preparation and characterization,"2.2 Catalysts preparation and characterization SO4 2 −/ZrO2/SBA-15 (designated as SZr) was prepared via a two-step impregnation method according to Li [21]. Bifunctional catalysts 5wt% Ru/SZr and 5wt% Ru/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=50) were prepared by incipient impregnation method. The characterizations of Ru/SZr and Ru/HZSM-5 were conducted prior to activation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on an X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation over 2θ in the ranges of 10–70°. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. All samples were pretreated in vacuum at 200°C for 2h. The specific surface area was calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. The total pore volume was determined from the adsorption and desorption branches of the nitrogen isotherms at p/p 0 =0.97. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was conducted to determine the acidity of acid catalysts and bifunctional catalysts. In a typical run, 0.1g of sample was treated in a flow of NH3 (10% in He, 30mL/min) at 60°C for 1h after pretreatment at 500°C in a flow of He (40mL/min) for 1h. The physically absorbed NH3 was removed by flushing the catalyst with He (50mL/min) at 100°C for 90min before starting the TPD analysis. Experimental runs were recorded with a mass spectrometry (QIC20) system by heating the sample from 100°C to 700°C at a ramp of 10°C/min under He flow (40mL/min). The mass number of 17 was used to track NH3 desorption."
4,Experimental procedure and products analysis,"2.3 Experimental procedure and products analysis All the reactions were conducted in a sealed 100mL stainless steel batch reactor. The reactor was equipped with an electrical heating jacket and a mechanical stirrer. Prior to the reaction, the self-made bifunctional catalysts (Ru/HZSM-5 and Ru/SZr) were activated in flowing hydrogen at 400°C for 3h. In the SHE reactions, four different groups of reactions were carried out: n-butanal hydrogenation, phenol hydrogenation, esterification of acetic acid and n-butanol, and esterification of acetic acid and cyclohexanol. For hydrogenation reactions, the feedstock was 0.01mol of reactant dissolved in 20mL of solvent (n-hexane). For esterification reactions, the feedstock was composed of 0.01mol of n-butanol or cyclohexanol and 0.01mol of acetic acid dissolved in 20mL of n-hexane. The feedstock and 0.5g of catalysts were added into the reactor. In a typical run of OHE reactions, the feedstock consisted of 0.01mol of n-butanal, 0.01mol of phenol and 0.01mol of acetic acid dissolved in 20mL of n-hexane. The feedstock and a certain amount of catalyst (0.5g of bifunctional catalysts or 0.5g of Ru/C+0.5g of acid catalysts) were added into the reactor. Before each run, the reactor was flushed five times with N2 and H2 respectively to exclude the remaining air, followed by filled with H2 to 4.0MPa. Then the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature (150°C) in 1h, and the isothermal reaction proceeded for 3h with a stirring speed of 700rpm. Afterwards, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature and the products were recovered after the reaction. The mass balance was about 95% for all the reactions. The liquid and solid products were separated. The liquid products were analyzed by GC-FID (Agilent 7890) with an HP-5 column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm) using the external standard method. The GC operating conditions were as followed: the oven temperature was 40°C for 3min, heated to 180°C at 4.0°C/min, then to 260°C at 10°C/min and held at 260°C for 10min. Every sample was analyzed three times and the deviation was within 5%. The conversion rate (X), yield (Y), and the selectivity (S) were calculated according to the following equation. (1) X ( Reactant ) = n ( Reactant,in ) - n ( Reactant,out ) n ( Reactant,in ) (2) Y ( i ) = n ( i ,out ) n ( Reactant,in ) , i = Products (3) S ( i ) = Y ( i ) X ( Reactant )"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization results,"3.1 Catalysts characterization results The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 1 and the textural properties of catalysts are displayed in Table 1 . A type-I isotherm with H4-type hysteresis loop was identified in the isotherms of C-supported catalysts, indicating the existence of mesopores and micropores in these catalysts. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of HZSM-5 (with different Si/Al ratios) exhibited a type-I isotherms without hysteresis loop, which demonstrated the microporosity of HZSM-5. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of SZr exhibited a type-IV isotherm with a H1-type hysteresis loop, which is typical for mesoporous catalysts. The isotherms and hysteresis loop types of Ru/HZSM-5 and Ru/SZr were similar to their parent supports. This illustrated that the structures of HZSM-5 and SZr were retained after the impregnation of Ru. C-supported catalysts had high BET surface area and pore volume. SZr possessed higher BET surface area and larger pore volume than HZSM-5 catalysts. After the impregnation of Ru, the BET surface area and pore volume of SZr and HZSM-5 decreased, which might be attributed to the occupation of metal particles in pores. The XRD patterns of C-supported catalysts and bifunctional catalysts are given in Fig. 2 . No diffraction peak corresponding to the active metals was observed in the XRD patterns of C-supported catalysts and Ru/SZr, which demonstrated the active metals were highly dispersed in these catalysts. Three diffraction peaks at 2θ =28.0°, 35.1°, and 54.3°, which could be indexed as (110), (101), and (211) reflections of tetragonal RuO2, were identified in the XRD patterns of Ru/HZSM-5. Fig. 3 presents the NH3-TPD profiles of acid catalysts and bifunctional catalysts. The temperature of NH3 desorption peak was correlated with the strength of acid sites and the peak area represents the amount of acid sites. As shown in Fig. 3A, two distinct NH3 desorption peaks were identified in the NH3-TPD curves of HZSM-5 catalysts. The first peak was located at 200°C, which was attributed to weak acid sites, while the second peak corresponding to strong acid sites was at about 380°C. The second peak shifted to higher temperatures for HZSM-5 with lower Si/Al ratios, indicating the acid strength of HZSM-5 increased with the decrease of Si/Al ratio. Furthermore, the peak area increased significantly with the decrease of Si/Al ratio, demonstrating that there were more acid sites in HZSM-5 with lower Si/Al ratios. The NH3-TPD profile of SZr was different from those of HZSM-5 catalysts. In the profile of SZr, one broad peak at about 250°C was identified, which could be attributed to medium acid sites. From Fig. 3A, it was estimated that the amount of acid sites in acid catalysts followed the order: HZSM-5 (Si/Al=25)>HZSM-5 (Si/Al=50)≈SZr>HZSM-5 (Si/Al=100). The NH3-TPD profiles of Ru/SZr and Ru/HZSM-5 (50) are exhibited in Fig. 3B. Compared with Ru/HZSM-5 (50), Ru/SZr had more acid sites, especially for medium acid sites. To investigate the effects of impregnation on the acidity of catalysts, comparisons between the NH3-TPD profiles of acid supports and bifunctional catalysts were made and the results are given in Fig. 3C and D. Compared with HZSM-5 (50), there was no peak corresponding to strong acid sites in the profile of Ru/HZSM-5 (50), which demonstrated that strong acid sites were removed during the impregnation process. In contrast, with regard to weak acid sites, there was only a slight difference between the profile of HZSM-5 (50) and that of Ru/HZSM-5 (50), indicating the weak acid sites was barely affected during the impregnation process. This phenomenon was also observed for SZr and Ru/SZr as illustrated in Fig. 3D. After the impregnation of Ru, the desorption peak shifted from about 250°C to about 230°C. Moreover, the amount of NH3 desorption at high temperatures reduced significantly as showed in Fig. 3D. In summary, the impregnation of Ru removed most of the strong acid sites."
7,Hydrogenation reactions,"3.2 Hydrogenation reactions In this part, phenol hydrogenation and n-butanal hydrogenation were conducted. The reactions were carried out at 150°C of reaction temperature and 4.0MPa of initial hydrogen pressure. The results of hydrogenation reactions are given in Table 2 . Pt/C, Pd/C, and Ru/C all exhibited complete conversion of phenol and n-butanal, indicating the high catalytic activity of these catalysts with regard to the conversion of phenol and n-butanal. In this paper, the desired products of hydrogenation were alcohols, thus the selectivity to alcohols was an important parameter to consider. The selectivity to alcohols was highly dependent on the reaction substrates. Phenol was quantitatively converted to cyclohexanol on Pt/C, Pd/C, and Ru/C. Although the conversions of n-butanal were 100%, the selectivity to n-butanol was about 60% for the tested catalysts. The side products were n-butane, methane, and propane. It is speculated that n-butane was formed by dehydration-hydrogenation of n-butanol while methane and propane were mainly produced by hydrogenolysis of C4 compounds. Compared with Pd/C, a slightly higher selectivity was obtained over Ru/C and Pt/C. Ru was used as the hydrogenation catalyst in further studies as it is much cheaper than Pt."
8,Esterification reactions,"3.3 Esterification reactions In this part, the esterification reactions of cyclohexanol or n-butanol with acetic acid were carried out. The reaction condition was the same with that of hydrogenation reactions. The results are displayed in Table 3 . Obviously, acetic acid reacted with both alcohols to corresponding esters. Relative to esterification of acetic acid and cyclohexanol, higher conversion and higher ester yield were obtained in the reaction of acetic acid and n-butanol. This indicated that the esterification rate of n-butanol was much faster than that of cyclohexanol, which might be attributed to the steric hinderance of cyclohexanol. Except for the reaction substrates, the conversions of alcohols were also influenced by the catalysts. With the catalysis of HZSM-5 catalysts, the conversions of alcohols increased with the decrease of Si/Al ratio. As illustrated in Section 3.1, with the decrease of Si/Al ratio, the acidity of HZSM-5 catalysts increased. Therefore, it can be concluded that the increase of alcohols conversions was mainly attributed to the increase of catalysts acidity. The conversion of cyclohexanol over SZr was higher than that over HZSM-5 (50), while the conversion of n-butanol exhibited an opposite result. This might be explained by the difference in textural properties of SZr and HZSM-5. HZSM-5 was a microporous zeolite while SZr was mesoporous. Compared with n-butanol, cyclohexanol is more difficult to be transferred into the inner pores due to its ring structure. The existence of mesopores in SZr facilitated the diffusion of cyclohexanol. As a result, the conversion of cyclohexanol over SZr was higher than that over HZSM-5 (50) whereas the conversion of n-butanol exhibited an opposite result. In contrast to the conversions of alcohols, the selectivity to esters over HZSM-5 decreased with the decrease of Si/Al ratio. The side products from n-butanol were butane, butylene, and n-butyl ether while cyclohexene and cyclohexane were the byproducts from cyclohexanol. These side products were mainly derived from intramolecular or intermolecular dehydration reactions and subsequent hydrogenation. SZr exhibited the highest selectivity to esters, both for n-butanol (88.19%) and cyclohexanol (49.82%). According to Fig. 3, the acid sites in SZr were mainly weak and medium acid sites, while those in HZSM-5 were weak and strong acid sites. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that the esterification reactions were mainly catalyzed by weak and medium acid. This was in accordance with the work of Yu et al. [18], which demonstrated that moderate weak acid sites were favorable for esterification reaction. HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 and SZr were selected as the catalyst in further studies for their relatively high catalytic activity and high selectivity to desired products."
9,One-pot hydrogenation–esterification reactions,"3.4 One-pot hydrogenation–esterification reactions According to Sections 3.2 and 3.3, phenol, n-butanal, and acetic acid were converted to alcohols and esters, which were our desired products. However, four separate reactions are too complicated. To simplify the whole process, one-pot hydrogenation–esterification (OHE) was carried out. Bifunctional catalysts (Ru/HZSM-5 (50) and Ru/SZr) and physically mixed catalysts (Ru/C+HZSM-5 (50) and Ru/C+SZr) were employed. The results of OHE are provided in Table 4 . In the OHE reactions, phenol and n-butanal were completely converted in entry 1, 2, and 3. With the catalysis of Ru/SZr, the conversion of phenol was only 18.78%, which was evidently lower than the other three entries. Osada et al. [22] demonstrated that the activity of Ru was poisoned with the existence of sulfur. They claimed that the sulfur species which poisoned the ruthenium sites were ruthenium sulfide, ruthenium sulfite, and ruthenium sulfate. We can reasonably infer that these species formed during the preparation of Ru/SZr and thus leaded to the deactivation of its hydrogenation activity. The reactions of phenol and that of n-butanal exhibited a significant difference in terms of the distribution between alcohols and esters in entries 1–3. The majority of phenol was converted to cyclohexanol with only a small amount of cyclohexyl acetate formed. In contrast, the selectivity towards butyl acetate in the conversion of n-butanal was about 30%. For entries 1–3, the highest yield of esters (41.69% in total) was obtained over physically mixed Ru/C and HZSM-5 (50). However, physically mixed Ru/C and SZr gave the highest yield of cyclohexyl acetate (5.98%). This was attributed to the promoted transfer of cyclohexanol in mesoporous SZr as discussed in Section 3.3. Since the esterification of cyclohexanol and acetic acid esterification has a lower reaction rate than that of n-butanol and acetic acid, the competitive adsorption hindered the esterification of n-butanol and acetic acid. As a result, the total yield of esters in entry 3 was lower than that in entry 1. Compared with the entry 1, only a slightly lower yield (about 8%) of esters was obtained for entry 2 which was carried out over bifunctional Ru/HZSM-5. Given the fact that the strong acid sites were almost completely removed during the impregnation of Ru, this further demonstrated that esterification reactions were mainly catalyzed by weak and medium acid sites."
10,Comparison between SHE and OHE,"3.5 Comparison between SHE and OHE Both separate hydrogenation–esterification and one-pot hydrogenation–esterification can convert phenol, n-butanal, and acetic acid into desired alcohols and esters. A comparison between OHE over physically mixed Ru/C and HZSM-5 (50) and SHE over Ru/C for hydrogenation and HZSM-5 (50) for esterification was made and the reaction network of hydrogenation–esterification is illustrated in Fig. 4 . In SHE, the final yields of alcohols were calculated by multiplying the yields of alcohols in hydrogenation by the residual alcohols (100% – X Alc) in esterification. The yields of esters were determined by multiplying the yields of alcohols in hydrogenation by the yields of esters in esterification. The results are provided in Table 5 . In contrast to SHE, much higher yields of alcohols, especially n-butanol, but slightly lower yields of esters were obtained in OHE reaction. The low yield of n-butanol in SHE was mainly attributed to the low selectivity for n-butanol in n-butanal hydrogenation and the high conversion of n-butanol in esterification reaction. In OHE, the total yields of n-butanol and butyl acetate was 98.54%, which indicated the majority of n-butanal was firstly converted into n-butanol. Therefore, it can be inferred that the side reactions during the hydrogenation of n-butanal were inhibited in OHE. In OHE, the total reaction time was 3h, hence the reaction time for esterification was shorter than 3h. The lower yields of esters in OHE might be attributed to the reduced reaction time. However, the total yields of desired products from n-butanal (n-butanol and butyl acetate) and phenol (cyclohexanol and cyclohexyl acetate) were 98.54% and 93.79%, respectively, which were higher than that in SHE. This indicated that in OHE most of the consumed alcohols were converted into esters. Therefore, it can be concluded that the side reactions during esterification were inhibited in OHE. It can be reasonably assumed that given more reaction time, higher yields of esters could be expected (Supporting Information S2). In summary, side reactions were inhibited in OHE, which resulted in higher yields of desired products. Therefore, it can be concluded that OHE reactions is a promising method to upgrade phenols, aldehydes, and acids in bio-oil to stable and combustible alcohols and esters."
11,Conclusion,"In this paper, catalytic conversions of phenol, n-butanal, and acetic acid to alcohols and esters were proposed as a method for upgrading of bio-oil. Separate hydrogenation–esterification (SHE) reactions and one-pot hydrogenation–esterification (OHE) reactions were carried out. In SHE, Ru/C, Pt/C, and Pd/C all exhibited superior activity in phenol and n-butanal hydrogenation. SZr gave the highest yields of esters, which demonstrated esterification reactions were mainly catalyzed by weak and medium acid sites. Higher conversion and higher ester yield were obtained for the esterification of n-butanol and acetic acid. In OHE, phenol exhibited high selectivity towards cyclohexanol while about 30% of n-butanal converted to butyl acetate. Compared with SHE, higher yields of desired products (alcohols and esters) were obtained in OHE, which was attributed to the suppression of side reactions. This paper demonstrated that OHE of phenols, aldehydes, and acids was a promising method for upgrading of bio-oil."
