0,Introduction,"The world economy continues to grow at a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate of 3.25% and has been estimated to grow at a faster rate in Asia, particularly in India and China [1]. Significant energy sources are also required to meet the desired economic development. The total energy demand is expected to increase worldwide by 28% by 2040 [1]. Among all the energy sectors, transport sector, which mainly relies on liquid fuels, consumes the largest part of the energy and is predicted to reach nearly 3.3 Billion toe worldwide by 2040 [1]. There are predictions of the significant increase in electric vehicles (cars and buses) or solar-assisted vehicles that may decrease the demand of liquid fuel, however high-power transport vehicles, such as aeroplanes, long-haul trucks and ships, will still require high energy-density fuels. Therefore, potential alternatives to liquid fuels are required to meet the energy demand since the conventional liquid fuels (petrol and diesel) are depleting. The most desirable alternatives could be renewable and sustainable fuels or fuels that can be produced from renewable feedstocks and their combustion produces less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this regard, biomass has been considered the most suitable renewable energy source for production of various second-generation liquid fuels. This is mainly because biomass is a dominant source of carbon and contains less nitrogenous and sulphur contents. There are promising technologies that can convert biomass into high energy-density fuels [2–6]. In addition, it has been also reported that the combustion of fuels produced from biomass emits lower amount of NOx and SOx compared to conventional liquid fuels, like bio-oil [7,8] or bio-based jet fuel [9], which consequently could help to reduce GHG emissions. Pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) are the most widely used approaches to convert the dry and wet lignocellulose biomass or organic wastes into liquid or other fuels and value-added chemicals [12–17]. Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that degrades the various interlinkages between the biomass components as an effect of heating in an inert atmosphere where the main biomass components, such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, are further degraded into different organic compounds [18,19]. Fig. 1 shows the major component of lignocellulose biomass. The biomass pyrolysis usually results in three types of products, bio-oil, bio-char and pyrolytic gases. The yield of the products mainly depends on the composition of biomass and the pyrolysis temperature. Generally, at the temperature of 500–600 °C, the biomass with a higher proportion of cellulose results in a higher bio-oil yield, while the pyrolysis of biomass with a higher amount of hemicellulose and lignin may result in higher gas and char yield, respectively [20–22]. Other pyrolytic parameters, such as heating rate, flow rate of carrier gas or residence time, holding time, and particle size of the feedstock, also influence the product yield or the composition of bio-oil [23]. On the other hand, HTL involves decomposition of biomass (wet or dry biomass) in the presence of a solvent (water, methanol, ethanol, acetone etc.) at the temperature of 250–550 °C and pressure of 5–25 MPa [24,25]. The process of biomass HTL firstly comprises the depolymerization of biomass into their individual components, followed by their decomposition via various reactions, such as dehydration, cleavage, decarboxylation and deamination. In the last step, the reactive molecules are recombined or repolymerized to form high-molecular-weight compounds. Similar to pyrolysis, the HTL process also generates three types of fuels, mainly bio-oil, bio-char, gases and also a water phase that contains a high content of carbon, and their yields depend on the type of feedstock and operating parameters of the process. For example, de Caprariis et al. [26] suggested that an increased bio-oil yield could be obtained with the biomass containing higher content of lignin, while the minimum bio-oil yield was obtained with the biomass containing a higher content of cellulose. Generally, the temperature range of 250–330 °C is suitable to obtain a higher bio-oil yield. The solvents with higher density and ability to promote the solvolysis and hydration reactions are highly advantageous in the HTL process [27,47,48]. Other parameters, such as pressure, heating rate and residence time also play a critical role to obtain quality bio-oil. The bio-oil produced using either pyrolysis or HTL has been considered a clean and environmentally friendly energy fuel as its combustion generates lower GHG emissions compared to the conventional fossil fuels [28,29]. For example, a study demonstrated the comparison of bio-oil combustion with heavy fuel oil in an industrial boiler and the results showed that the NOx emissions for bio-oil were 88 mg/MJ, while the combustion of heavy fuel oil produced NOx emissions of 193 mg/MJ [30]. However, the bio-oil properties, such as high acidity, low stability, low higher heating values (HHV), presence of solid char particles make it an unsuitable drop-in fuel [19,31,32]. Therefore, bio-oil upgrading is essential to produce bio-oil as a transport fuel or for its direct use in the boilers and turbines for heat and power generation. There are different strategies to improve the properties of bio-oil, mainly based on the biomass pre-treatment, such as dry torrefaction [33,34], wet torrefaction [35,36], acid and alkali treatment [37–39], steam explosion etc. [40] and downstream treatment of the bio-oil such as emulsification [41,42], solvent addition [43,44], filtration etc. [45,46]. In terms of bio-oil upgrading, the biomass pre-treatment methods are usually advantageous to increase the conversion of oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons, increase the bio-oil yield and HHV [47,48], while the downstream treatment methods generally help to increase the bio-oil stability and HHV, and decrease the viscosity and the amount of solid char particles. In addition, the bio-oil can also be upgraded using electrochemical hydrogenation, which generally converts the carbonyl-containing compounds into hydrocarbons or other value-added compounds [49,50]. Alternatively, the application of different catalysts during pyrolysis and HTL is a significant approach to improve the kinetics of the process and enhance the bio-oil properties, and has been widely used for bio-oil upgrading in pyrolysis as well as in HTL [24,51,52]. Hydrotreatment is considered highly efficient for bio-oil upgrading as it removes oxygen in the form of H2O while in cracking oxygen is removed in the form of CO2 and CO which decreases the total carbon yield [53,54]. Hydrotreatment of bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis and HTL process has been reported in several studies with various types of catalysts utilized for hydrotreatment of bio-oil to either convert it into a more valuable fuel with improved physicochemical properties or other value-added products. For instance, Biller et al. [55] studied the application of sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3 for hydrotreatment of bio-oil obtained from HTL of Chlorella. The results reported considerable increase in the conversion of oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons with application of sulphided catalysts, as a high number of hydrocarbons was observed in the upgraded bio-oil [55]. The bio-oil obtained from thermochemical techniques could also be a suitable feedstock for steam reforming (SR) for production of H2 or a mixture of CO and H2, called syngas [56–61]. H2 produced from SR of bio-oil can be further used as a clean fuel, while syngas can be further subjected to Fischer-Tropsch process for production of hydrocarbons. SR is a process involving conversion of bio-oil containing oxygenated compounds or hydrocarbons into hydrogen in the presence of water at a temperature range of 350–1000 °C [62,63]. The technique also requires highly active catalyst to enhance the conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield. Several studies have reported the application of various types for catalysts with promising results for hydrogen production [60,62]. Bio-oil is foreseen as a potential drop-in fuel; hence, the bio-oil upgrading is highly important to make it competitive to the conventional energy fuels. The methods used for bio-oil upgrading, such as catalytic cracking, hydrodeoxygenation [10,13,64], biomass pre-treatments such as torrefaction and wet-torrefaction [35,35,65] have been comprehensively reviewed in previous publications. For example, Zacher et al. [66] critically reviewed hydrotreatment process for bio-oil upgrading and discussed various parameters, techno-economic analysis and challenges associated with the technique. Recently, Nishu et al. [67] published a review article focused on catalytic pyrolysis with ZSM-based catalysts for bio-oil upgrading. On the other hand, Bach and Skreiberg [65] published a review article on the effect of dry and wet torrefaction on bio-oil upgrading and other biofuel production. It was noticed that less attention has been paid to review the methods applied for downstream bio-oil upgrading and no review article has been published recently. In recent years, a number of research articles and reports have been published on various downstream techniques for bio-oil upgrading and production of other value-added fuels. Therefore, considering the significance of these methods for biofuel production this article aims to provide the recent advances in the downstream upgrading of bio-oil produced either using the pyrolysis process or HTL. The article begins with providing critical insights for the potential of biomass as a renewable resource and the conversion efficiency of pyrolysis and liquefaction for biofuel production. Later, it discusses the widely used methods for downstream bio-oil upgrading, such as solvent addition, emulsification, filtration, electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrotreatment. Basic principles of the processes and effects of different parameters on bio-oil upgrading are thoroughly discussed, while key challenges and possible solutions are also provided. Bio-oil can be successfully converted to clean fuel like H2 using steam reforming technique (SR), which is critically discussed in the article. In addition, techno-economic analysis, policy analysis, challenges and future recommendations related to downstream processes are provided in later sections of the article. Overall, this review article provides critical information about downstream bio-oil upgrading and production of other high value-added fuels."
1,Biomass as a renewable feedstock for bio-oil production,"Biomass is a non-fossil, complex organic-inorganic solid product, mainly derived from plants and could also be obtained from animals, bacteria, fungi etc. A recent study has estimated the amount of biomass among all the taxa (plants, bacteria, fungi, animals, viruses, archaea, protists) on Earth [68,97]. The study showed that approximately 550 Gt C is present on Earth with 80%, or ~450 Gt C, is covered by terrestrial plants, while the rest is dominant by bacteria and others [68]. Therefore, it could be suggested that out of the total biomass on earth, 80% of biomass could be estimated as the potential feedstock in different thermochemical technologies for biofuel production. Biomass is considered as a renewable energy source since it does not contribute to the greenhouse effect because of CO2 neutral conversion. The biomass plants store the energy in the primary products (monosaccharides) as a result of photosynthesis process, which involves the uptake of water, CO2 and solar energy by the plant pigments and are converted into organic chemicals (monosaccharides like glucose) and oxygen, as shown in eq. (1). (1) 6 H 2 O + 6 C O 2 + r a d i a n t e n e r g y → C 6 H 12 O 6 ( g l u c o s e ) + 6 O 2 These primary products produced after photosynthesis act as precursors for synthesis of all types of organic components of biomass and are further converted into the secondary products, such as polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and several other organic compounds. The biomass synthesis in the plants greatly depends on the photosynthesis efficiency, which varies for different biomass species. Generally, the higher the photosynthesis efficiency, the greater is the biomass synthesis. It has been reported that the plants that fix CO2 via C3 pathway show higher photosynthesis efficiency at warm temperatures, while the plants fixing CO2 via C4 pathway exhibit higher rates of photosynthesis at cool temperatures [69]. Therefore, from higher biomass production point of view, C3 or C4 plants can be cultured according to the preferred climate conditions in different parts of the world to enhance production of biomass in shorter span of time, which can be further utilized in various technologies for biofuel production. The organic-inorganic composition and energy content of the biomass are pivotal parameters for their utilization in conversion processes for the production of bio-oil or other biofuels. For example, the biomass that exhibits higher content of moisture could not be suitable for pyrolysis process, while it could be a suitable feedstock for HTL as the excess water could be used as a reactant medium, or in anaerobic or fermentation processes for methane or bioethanol production. Similarly, the ash content is highly undesirable in the biomass as its higher content lowers the organic matter in the biomass and consequently decreases the HHV of the biomass. The ash content also contains certain metal oxides, such as calcium and potassium, which might affect the conversion processes due to their catalytic behavior, and their further presence in the bio-oil makes it highly unstable as these metal oxides may start the polymerization reactions. It is evident and well known that different biomass exhibits varying composition, chemical structures and carbon contents. Generally, biomass with higher carbon content in reduced form shows higher heating value, while the higher degree of oxygenation reduces the heating value of the biomass. For example, the monosaccharides contain carbon contents of nearly 40% and their estimated HHV is 15.6 MJ/kg, while terpenes and lipids exhibit approximately 88% and 77% of carbon content and hence show higher HHV of 45.2 MJ/kg and 39.8 MJ/kg, respectively [70]. Table 1 shows the carbon content and HHV of specific biomass components. An extensive research has been carried on both pyrolysis and HTL technologies for bio-oil production for optimization of process parameters and selection of biomass feedstock to obtain higher yield and quality of bio-oil. These parameters have been discussed in detail in several articles published already [20,21,91,92], therefore, are not reviewed in this article. However, the key differences between the pyrolysis and HTL in terms of bio-oil quality and energy conversion rate (ECR) are briefly discussed. ECR of the pyrolysis (or HTL) for a biomass feedstock at any temperature can be obtained using equations (2) and (3). (2) η = Q r e c o v e r e d − Q p y r o l y s i s Q b i o m a s s × 100 % where (3) Q r e c o v e r e d = H H V g a s × m a s s g a s + H H V l i q u i d × m a s s l i q u i d + H H V c h a r × m a s s c h a r The comparative studies of pyrolysis and HTL suggest that HTL produces better bio-oil quality compared to pyrolysis [62,84,85]. For instance, Jena and Das [71] compared the quality of bio-oil produced from pyrolysis and HTL. They used Spirulina platensis as the feedstock and carried out the pyrolysis process at temperatures of 350 and 550 °C, with a heating rate of 3.5 °C/min and 7 °C/min, respectively, while the HTL process was carried out in a 1.8-L Parr reactor at 350 °C with the water pressure of 20.6 MPa and a heating rate of 3.3 °C/min, and the residence time of 60 min. The properties of the bio-oil resulted from both processes are shown in Table 2 , which suggests that the bio-oil from HTL showed better thermal stability and HHV as compared to the pyrolytic oils [71]. However, the higher content of inorganic species was found in the bio-oil collected from HTL process, which could be mainly because of the leaching of inorganic species from the char into the bio-oil, as the liquid and solid products are usually kept in the reactor until the reactor is cooled down and the bio-oil is separated from the solid char [93,94]. In terms of ECR, HTL also proved more efficient than pyrolysis process. The study showed that HTL could convert approximately 67.9% of energy present in biomass into the bio-oil, while the ECR during pyrolysis was only 33.9% and 46.7% for the bio-oils obtained at the temperature of 350 and 500 °C, respectively [71]. The lower ECR in pyrolysis could be attributed to more energy inputs required for the pyrolysis process, mainly for drying the biomass feedstock before pyrolysis. The conversion efficiency of the pyrolysis process could be further enhanced if the energy inputs are provided by the energy products generated during the pyrolysis or using the solar thermal energy. In a recent study, Weldekidan et al. [95] showed that the pyrolysis process could be highly efficient if heat required to carry out the pyrolysis process is supplied by combustion of the evolved pyrolytic gas products. In this scenario, the ECR (for all pyrolytic products) calculated for the pyrolysis of rice husk biomass (at 500 °C and heating rate of 10 °C/min) was 89% and if the solar thermal energy is used for the pyrolysis process, the ECR of 94% could also be achieved [95]. Overall, it can be suggested that pyrolysis could be an efficient and equivalent approach for bio-oil production when compared to HTL. Pyrolysis is a commercial process used for bio-oil production at a pilot scale. For example, KiOR and Envergent use Circulating Fluid Bed configuration, while Dynamotive applies Bubbling Fluidized Bed for biomass pyrolysis [96]. BTG-Bioliquids is using Rotating Cone Reactor fast pyrolysis technology for bio-oil production at a commercial level, and claims to obtain 70% of bio-oil yield. However, the bio-oil produced at the commercial level is still of low quality in terms of calorific value and H/C ratios, hence, the companies have to use an upgrading approach to improve the bio-oil properties. On the other hand, HTL has not been used at a commercial level yet mainly because of the high capital cost for the system. Other key challenges of HTL are associated with reactor designs, high cost for solvent, catalyst and purification of the bio-oil. A continuous reactor system is required to scale up the HTL process for bio-oil production as the batch reactors possess certain limitations regarding process parameters and mixture of bio-oil and biochar in the reactor which further requires a purification step to separate [97]. However, continuous reactors have some challenges when operates under high pressures and temperature conditions. For example, they require preparation of biomass slurries and pumping into the reactor, which is a challenging task to perform under high pressures. The requirement for pumping instrumentation and operation is also an economic challenge as it increases the total operating cost. The development of highly effective, cheaper and simple purification techniques, application of advanced, cost-effective and versatile catalysts, and minimizing the use of solvents are major breakthroughs required for successful application of HTL at a commercial level. Table 3 and Table 4 summarize few studies on production of bio-oil using general pyrolysis and HTL (without any upgrading approach), respectively. It can be estimated that the bio-oil produced using either pyrolysis or HTL cannot be directly used as a drop-in fuel and thus it is highly important to improve its properties and increase the energy content to make it a competitive fuel to the currently available conventional fuels. In this regard, several methods have been demonstrated for bio-oil upgrading, which can be applied during pyrolysis or HTL process that mainly contain catalytic approaches, such as catalytic cracking, hydrodeoxygenation and esterification, or pre-pyrolysis or pre-HTL approaches which mainly involve biomass pre-treatment methods, such as torrefaction, acid and alkali treatments, or steam explosion. Alternatively, the bio-oil properties can be improved during post-pyrolysis or HTL process, such as with solvent addition, emulsification, filtration, electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrotreatment, which are comprehensively discussed in the further sections of the article."
2,Methods for downstream bio-oil upgrading,"In this section, major downstream approaches for bio-oil upgrading have been comprehensively reviewed. Basic principles of the processes, effect of key parameters on bio-oil properties, challenges and feasibility of the processes have been thoroughly discussed."
3,Solvent addition,"3.1 Solvent addition The application of polar solvents has shown to improve certain properties of the bio-oil. The main objective of using solvents is to increase the stability and decrease the viscosity of the bio-oil. The increase in viscosity during the storage is generally linked with the formation of water, which subsequently results in the separation of a lignin-rich sludge at the bottom. The bio-oil along with water contains other oxygenated compounds and degraded lignin. Upon aging, the quantity of water-insoluble fraction increases, which further leads to the increase in average molecular mass and viscosity of the bio-oil. The formation of water and water-insoluble fraction is usually due to the occurrence of condensation and polymerization reactions. The presence of impurities in the bio-oil, like char particles or heavy metals absorbed from the biomass during pyrolysis or HTL process, can catalyse the condensation and polymerization reactions. The addition of a solvent generally affects the viscosity of the bio-oil mainly by diluting the bio-oil without affecting the chemical reaction rate. In addition, the chemical reactions between the solvent and the bio-oil components also help to prevent the polymerization reactions. The primary chemical reactions that occur between the alcohol solvent (such as ethanol and methanol) and the bio-oil components are esterification and acetalization. Table 5 shows some examples of solvents used to improve physicochemical properties bio-oil. Several solvents, such as ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, acetone and N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), have been successfully demonstrated for the bio-oil upgrading. For example, Oasmaa et al. [98] investigated the effect of alcohol on the improvement of bio-oil properties. The results demonstrated that adding 5% of ethanol or isopropanol increased the solubility of hydrophobic components of the bio-oil and the amount of water content decreased approximately 7 wt% in the top phase (that constitutes nearly 25% of the total liquid product) of the bio-oil, while no significant change in the water content was observed in the bottom phase. Moreover, the addition of solvent decreased the viscosity and density, whereas the heating value of the bio-oil increased proportionally with the concentration of the solvent, reaching maximum of 17.5 MJ/kg with 10% of isopropanol [98]. A recent study demonstrated the use of different proportions of methanol from 3 wt% to 15 wt% to improve the storage stability of bio-oil from pine wood pyrolysis [99]. The increasing concentration of methanol demonstrated decrease in viscosity, which could be attributed to the change in the bio-oil microstructure, physical dilution and prevention of chain reactions due to the interactions between methanol and bio-oil constituents [99,100]. In addition, the concentration above 6 wt% of methanol showed to increase the pH with the storage time, which could be ascribed to the fact that the neutral dilution effect of methanol or methanol could also inhibit the activity of H+ in the bio-oil [99,101]. In a similar study, Liu et al. [102] investigated the influence of varying concentrations of acetone (3 wt%-15 wt%) on physicochemical properties of bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis of pinewood at 500 °C in a continuously fed bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The results indicated that acetone had a significant effect on improving the overall bio-oil properties. The increasing concentration of acetone increased the pH of bio-oil proportionally, while the formation of water content decreased with increase in the concentration, obtaining approximately 12% decrease with 15 wt% acetone. On the other hand, a maximum of 84.6% decrease was observed in the viscosity with the addition of 15 wt% of acetone in the bio-oil [102]. The previous studies discussed above utilized an individual solvent separately to analyze its effect on bio-oil upgrading, however, a compound additive comprising two or more solvents in varying proportions has been also tested to improve the bio-oil quality that showed better results for bio-oil upgrading compared to its single solvent counterparts. For example, a compound additive with 1 wt% methanol, 5.06 wt% DMF, and 1.94 wt % acetone proved the best combination to produce the most significant quality bio-oil as compared to the either of the single solvents and increased the overall storage properties of the bio-oil [32]. The addition of compound additive was believed to prevent the polymerization of low-molecular compounds during the aging. In a similar demonstration, Zhu et al. [78] examined the effect of a compound additive (2.42 wt% n-butanol, 2.32 wt% dimethyl sulfoxide and 3.25 wt% ethyl acetate) on bio-oil properties during its storage at 80 °C for up to 48 h. It was reported that the compound additive showed noteworthy bio-oil stability as compared to the single solvent. For instance, the water content in the bio-oil with ethyl acetate was 8.18%, which decreased to 1.60% with the compound additive used in the study [78]. Moreover, Zhang et al. [103] also investigated the application of a mixed additive, containing methanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate in certain percentages for bio-oil upgrading and the results were satisfactory, showing substantial improvement in the viscosity and water content in the bio-oil. In comparison to single solvent, mixed additives proved more advantageous for bio-oil upgrading, which can be attributed to the chemical activity of the solvents in the compound additive that react with a greater number of constituents of the bio-oil and also prevent the polymerization reactions, consequently, leading to a stable bio-oil. The bio-oil upgrading with solvents can be further improved with physical treatments, such as ultrasonication, that could result in frequent particle movements and hence could allow the solvents molecules to interact better with the constituents of bio-oil. Noticeably, Xu et al. [44] successfully demonstrated the application of ultrasonication for bio-oil upgrading. They used n-octanol as the solvent mixed with the bio-oil in a ratio of 1:1 and the ultrasonic power of 150 W was applied for different exposure times from 2 to 20 min. The results revealed that increasing the exposure time of ultrasonication enhanced the bio-oil properties. For example, the bio-oil without ultrasonication showed lower pH of 4.92 and HHV of 25.76 MJ/kg, while the ultrasonication with an exposure time of 20 min increased the pH to 5.11 and HHV to 38.32 MJ/kg [44]. The increase in pH was attributed to the increase in alcoholysis of organic compounds of bio-oil upon ultrasonication. It was also suggested that ultrasonication promotes mechanical and cavitation effects at higher temperatures which triggers the decomposition of large chain compounds into smaller compounds that can be evaporated as gas, consequently, leading to decrease in moisture content of the bio-oil. A recent study also investigated the effect of ultrasonication power and exposure time on bio-oil properties, such as HHV, viscosity and moisture content using methanol and octanol blends [104]. Authors reported that bio-oil blends with solvents without ultrasonication treatment showed the HHV of 26 MJ/kg, viscosity of 316 mPa s, and moisture content of 17%, while ultrasonication of the blends at power of 55 W/L for 11 min increased the HHV to 34.2 MJ/kg and reduced the viscosity and moisture content to 260 mPa s and 14.4%, respectively [104]. The enhanced properties of the blends were attributed to breaking of larger compounds and formation of free radicals upon ultrasonication, which reacted with other group of compounds in the bio-oil and formed stable compounds [104]. Ultrasonication was also believed to promote ring opening and hemiacetalation reactions by breaking the double bonds in ketones, alcohols and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, leading to the reduction in the content of ketones and alcohols and increase in the content of alkanes and alkynes in the bio-oil [105]. The application of solvents is quite simple and significant approach to enhance the bio-oil properties, such as viscosity and calorific value. The solvents also react with the constituents of the bio-oil, such as organic compounds, minerals and alkali metals, and prevent the polymerization reactions, thereby leading to a stable bio-oil. However, less information is available about the reaction mechanism between the solvent and bio-oil constituents due to the complexity and bio-oil composition. Therefore, more research should be conducted to understand the chemical reactions between the solvent and constituents of bio-oil."
4,Emulsification,"3.2 Emulsification Similar to the solvent addition, emulsification can also be used to improve the bio-oil properties and increase the total energy content of the resultant bio-oil. Where the polar solvents are miscible in the bio-oil, emulsification involves two immiscible liquids in which the tiny particles of one liquid are suspended in the larger particles of the second liquid. The successful emulsion of the two liquids may result in different sizes of droplets, such as 1–10 μm, while the emulsion that results in the droplets of the size 1–100 nm is termed as microemulsions [41]. Emulsion and microemulsions are formed almost in a similar way but there are some key factors that differentiate them with each other. It has been stated that microemulsions are thermodynamically more stable than emulsions and hence possess less probability of phase separation at a broad range of temperature. On the other hand, emulsions are comparatively less stable and require more energy to form [106]. Emulsification is a simple and effective approach for bio-oil upgrading as the resultant mixture can be directly used for heat or power generation [41]. Generally, the bio-oil is emulsified with other petroleum fuels, such as diesel or biodiesel. Since the bio-oil and diesel are less miscible is nature, their emulsification could be carried out in the presence of a surfactant (such as Atlox 4914, Tween 80 and Span 80) and sometimes co-surfactants (for example, methanol, ethanol and n-butanol) can also be used to improve the emulsion stability [107]. Generally, the surfactant molecules are made up of two parts, a polar hydrophilic ‘head’ and a nonpolar lipophilic ‘tail’. During the emulsion of a polar liquid, such as bio-oil, and a nonpolar liquid like diesel, the hydrophilic part of the surfactant adsorbs on to the droplet's surface and the lipophilic part points outward into the nonpolar liquid. The surfactant molecules form a thin layer around the droplets and protect it to coalesce when they interact with each other in the emulsion. This type of emulsion is known as water in oil (W/O) emulsion. Alternatively, when the droplets of a nonpolar liquid are dispersed in an aqueous liquid they are termed as oil in water (O/W) emulsion, as shown in Fig. 2 A. In addition to this, other physical methods such as ultrasonication, stirring and the selection of favourable parameters can be employed to obtain the stable emulsions, which ultimately affect the physicochemical properties of the resultant bio-oil. Usually, the bio-oil upgrading through emulsification with diesel reduces the viscosity and enhances the calorific value and cetane number as the liquid fuel [106]. Table 6 compares the fuel properties of bio-oils and emulsions prepared using bio-oil and emulsifiers. To obtain a stable emulsion, the volumetric ratios of bio-oil/diesel and the concentration of the emulsifier/surfactant are the important parameters, while other factors like temperature, stirring intensity, and mixing time are also critical to obtain a stable emulsion which subsequently would affect the bio-oil upgrading. In other words, a stable emulsion would result in a high-quality bio-oil having a longer stability duration, while the unstable emulsion would lead to a poor-quality bio-oil. Jiang and Ellis [108] investigated the emulsification of bio-oil with biodiesel optimization using octanol as the surfactant and studied the effect of various parameters on the stability of emulsion and their effect on the bio-oil properties. The study concluded that the mixing ratio of bio-oil/biodiesel of 40%/60% produced the most stable emulsion, while 4% of octanol (surfactant) was optimum to obtain a stable emulsion. They found that at the lower concentrations of octanol, the mixture was unstable due to the agglomeration of the oil droplets, whereas the emulsion disrupted due to rapid coalescence at the higher concentrations of octanol [41,108,109]. Emulsification of the bio-oil with biodiesel decreased the viscosity to 4.66 mPa s compared to 67.39 mPa s of the sole bio-oil, while the HHV of the mixture significantly increased from 15.28 MJ/kg to 35.76 MJ/kg [108]. In a recent study, the bio-oil was emulsified with diesel using Span 80 and Tween 60 as surfactants, the resultant mixture showed HHV value of 44.32 MJ/kg that was close to the commercial diesel fuel (45.65 MJ/kg) [110]. Another important factor that plays a key role to obtain a stable emulsion and thereby a high-quality bio-oil is hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) number of the surfactant. HLB is a measure of the degree to which a surfactant is hydrophilic or lipophilic in nature. HLB generally varies between 0 and 18. Fig. 2B shows the scale of HLB values, indicating that a surfactant having an HLB range of 4–8 would result in W/O emulsions while a surfactant with an HLB range of 9–12 would lead to O/W emulsions. Bio-oil emulsification with diesel or biodiesel using surfactants of varying HLB values has been investigated to improve the bio-oil stability and other properties. For instance, Martin et al. [111] demonstrated the effect of surfactant polyethylene glycol-dipolyhydroxystearate (PEG-DPHS) of varying HLB values on the stability of bio-oil emulsion with diesel fuel. The results revealed that the surfactant with HLB of 4.75 produced the most stable emulsion with uniform size (~0.48 μm) of droplets when the ratio of diesel/bio-oil/surfactant of 32:8:1 was used in the experiments. It was further reported that the droplets were quite stable until seven days as no coalescence was observed. Such an emulsion showed greatly improved fuel properties, exhibiting the HHV value of 41.2 MJ/kg, which was approximately 75% higher than the raw bio-oil. A significant decrease in the viscosity and water content was also observed which were 5.94 cP and 1.74 wt%, respectively [111]. In a separate study, Farooq et al. [110] investigated emulsification of bio-oil with diesel using the surfactant of varying HBL values. Firstly, they treated the raw bio-oil with ether and used the ether extracted bio-oil for emulsification with diesel. Two surfactants, Tween 60 (HLB of 14.6) and Span 80 (4.3) were mixed to obtain the final surfactant with HLB range of 4.3–8.8. An emulsion of bio-oil/surfactant/diesel was prepared with a ratio of 5/5/90 wt% and the results showed that the surfactant with HLB of 7.3 was optimal to obtain the stable emulsion. The resultant emulsion showed a very high HHV value of 44.32 MJ/kg, which was nearly 107% higher than the raw bio-oil [110]. Based on the results from previous two studies, it can be suggested that to obtain a stable emulsion, the optimal HLB value may differ to the type of surfactant and might vary depending on the composition of the bio-oil. For example, if the bio-oil contains higher proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons it would be miscible with diesel and may require a surfactant with lower HLB value to produce a stable emulsion. On the hand, the bio-oil with no hydrocarbons and rich in oxygenated compounds may demand a surfactant with a higher HLB value to make a stable emulsion. The emulsification of bio-oil with other than diesel or biodiesel fuel has been also investigated for bio-oil upgrading. For example, Zhang et al. [112] demonstrated the emulsification of bio-oil with crude glycerol using Span 80 as the surfactant. They studied the effect of various parameters to produce the stable emulsion with crude glycerol and found that the concentration of surfactant of 1% and temperature of below 45 °C was favourable to produce stable bio-oil/glycerol emulsions. However, they also reported the presence of some impurities in the crude glycerol, such as water, salt and alkali metals, that significantly decreased the stability of emulsions [112]. The bio-oil emulsification can also be achieved without using any surfactant, which could make the process simpler and more cost-effective. It has been demonstrated that ultrasound emulsification with mechanical agitation is effective to break the droplets to produce stable emulsions and therefore, could prove highly advantageous over conventional emulsification and can also prevent the use of surfactants [42,113]. For instance, Zhang et al. [42] in their further study demonstrated the emulsification of bio-oil with crude glycerol using ultrasound and mechanical agitation. To prepare a stable emulsion with bio-oil, the amount of glycerol was controlled so that it contains 1% of soap content to prevent the re-coalescence of droplets, while the ultrasound at 40% amplitude for 4 min and mechanical agitation for 2 min was applied to obtain a stable emulsion. The ultrasound treatment could help in the effective breakdown of droplets while the mechanical agitation could prevent the re-coalescence of droplets. The results showed that the applied combined approach resulted in the emulsion that could be stable for maximum of 15 h and improved the fuel properties compared to the raw bio-oil. For example, the produced emulsion showed a viscosity of 119.2 mPa s, which was approximately 32% lower than the sole bio-oil [42]. Similar to solvent addition, emulsification could be a remarkable approach to improve the bio-oil properties but it requires other physical techniques, such as stirring, ultrasonication to produce a stable emulsion and the use of additional surfactant that increases the cost of overall bio-oil upgrading."
5,Filtration to remove solid char residue,"3.3 Filtration to remove solid char residue The crude bio-oil contains some solid char particles (1–10 μm) that encompass metal ions as well, which are usually present in the biomass and are retained in the char particles during the pyrolysis process. The metal ions may act as a catalyst and promote the polymerization and condensation reactions during bio-oil storage, adversely affecting the chemical composition of the bio-oil and making it highly unstable to use as a drop-in fuel [116]. The char particles can also agglomerate and transform into larger particles, which can easily be deposited in engine valves and may block them, adversely affecting the ignition process in engines. The char particles can also cause corrosion problems to the engines. Therefore, it is highly imperative to remove the char particles and metal ions to improve the bio-oil properties. In this regard, some successful attempts have been demonstrated using filtration techniques to remove the char particles from the bio-oil [45,46,117–122]. The filtration process can be divided mainly into two types, liquid phase filtration and hot vapour filtration (HVF). Both modes of bio-oil filtration have shown positive results for removal of char particles as well as improved bio-oil stability [66]. Fig. 3 a shows schematic diagram of fast pyrolysis unit with HVF. Liquid phase filtration is considered as post pyrolysis treatment or a complete downstream bio-oil processing approach. It can be used to separate solid particles of 1–10 μm size [45,119]. Evidently, Javaid et al. [45] demonstrated the application of tubular ceramic membranes with pore size of 0.5–0.8 μm for microfiltration of bio-oil at a temperature range of 38–45 °C and trans-membrane pressures of 1–3 bars. The authors reported the significant reduction in the char particles and overall ash content in the bio-oil, as confirmed by the microscopic analysis. However, insignificant changes were observed in the chemical composition of the bio-oil after the filtration process [45]. The most concerned problem of using membranes for bio-oil filtration is fouling of the membranes in long run filtration, which can occur due to pore constriction, partial or complete blockage of pores and formation of a cake layer on its surface. Therefore, the regular washing of membranes with solvents, like methanol or acetic acid, is important to hamper the fouling. On the other hand, HVF has proven more advantageous to remove char particles as well as to improve the bio-oil properties. It has been shown that char particles <10 μm can be removed using HVF. Unlike liquid filtration that is a post-treatment method, HVF upgrades the bio-oil in mid pyrolysis process, prior to the condensation. HVF can be further classified into two types based on the introduction of the filter that is ex-situ HVF and in-situ HVF. In ex-situ HVF, the filter can be placed downstream the pyrolysis process but before the vapour condensation. Alternatively in in-situ HVF, the filter is introduced in a continuous fluid bed pyrolysis system [66]. It has been observed that ex-situ HVF results in significant decrease in bio-oil yield while in-situ HVF could be advantageous to obtain higher bio-oil yields and lower cake formation on the filter [121]. Generally, an HVF unit is comprised of porous and permeable filter elements like filter candle, filter media and membrane. Filters are usually made up of ceramic and metal elements applicable for high temperature. Filter candles are cylindrical in shape and made up of ceramic monolith or other materials with 1–3 m in length, depending on the type of materials, and a diameter of 60–150 mm [124]. Filter media is made up of high or low-density ceramic like silicon carbide alumina or cordierite or metal filter media which is made up of sintered metal or metal alloy. HVF units are coupled with pyrolysis system for bio-oil filtration. During filtration, the pyrolytic vapours are passed through the filters where the treated pyrolytic vapours leave the filter through an open end, while the untreated vapours enter the filter candles. Dust particles are also formed during the process which aggregate on the surface of the candle and form cake layer (shown in Fig. 3b). The char particles or alkali and alkali earth metals are filtered in the HVF mainly by two mechanisms, surface filtration and depth filtration. In surface filtration, generally the particles larger than pore size of filters are filtered through a sieving mechanism where they attach on the surface of the filter. The cake on the filter is removed using jet pulsing techniques [124]. In depth filtration, particles are filtered on filter media where the particles are trapped through diffusion mechanism. The integration of HVF with pyrolysis unit is challenging since the pyrolytic vapours form a sticky cake layer inside the filters which requires additional efforts to remove. Therefore, efficient techniques are required to remove the cake more easily and prevent blocking of the filters. Ex-situ HVF has been widely used for bio-oil upgrading. For example, Baldwin et al. [117] demonstrated the application of ex-situ HVF to remove the char particles from bio-oil produced from oak wood by employing the pyrolysis reactor, which was operated in the entrained-flow mode. The hot vapour filter comprised of either porous sintered stainless-steel metal powder or sintered ceramic powder was placed slipstream from the pyrolysis process development unit so that the filtered and unfiltered bio-oils could be separately collected for the comparison, while the bio-oil condensation and collection system was interfaced to the slipstream filter unit. The results demonstrated that the bio-oil obtained after the HVF using either of the filtration systems showed significantly less amount of the alkali metals compared to the unfiltered bio-oil. For example, the bio-oil obtained from the filtration system using porous sintered stainless-steel metal powder showed concentrations of sodium and potassium at 7 and 14 ppm, which were 49 and 50 ppm in the unfiltered bio-oil, respectively. Similarly, the concentrations of sodium and potassium in the bio-oil obtained from the sintered ceramic powder filtration system were less than 5 ppm. Consequently, the significant effect on aging of the bio-oil and reduction in viscosity was noticed in the filtered bio-oil. However, stainless-steel filter was not found appropriate as a high concentration of iron was detected in the bio-oil filtered using a stainless-steel filter that was probably due to leaching from the filter, which indicates the importance of filter material for the effective bio-oil upgrading. Another important observation in the study was the major decrease of 10–30% in the bio-oil yield, which was attributed to the catalytic activity of alkali metals and char present on the filter that probably reduced the activation energy of secondary cracking reactions for the pyrolytic vapours and increased the production of hydrogen and methane [117]. The temperature of the filter unit plays an important role in the removal of alkali metals, physical properties of the bio-oil and the yields of pyrolytic products (bio-oil, bio-char, gases). Mei et al. [120] demonstrated the effect of temperature of HVF on the removal of alkali metals and analyzed its effect on the bio-oil properties. They utilized ceramic hot vapour filter for upgrading of the bio-oil produced under fast pyrolysis of pine wood in a fluidized-bed reactor and varying HVF temperature from 350 to 500 °C. The results showed higher bio-oil yield obtained under HVF temperature of 400 °C when compared to 350 or 500 °C, while the concentrations of alkali metals and solid contents were also lower in the bio-oil obtained at this temperature. Consequently, the filtered bio-oil showed the HHV value of 23.29 MJ/kg, which was slightly lower than the bio-oil produced at 500 °C (25.88 MJ/kg), however, the viscosity of 26.9 mm2/s was the lowest compared to either 350 or 500 °C, which were 28.6 and 37.6 mm2/s, respectively [120]. Similarly, Chen et al. [119] investigated the effect of HVF to filter the char and solid particles in rice husk bio-oil and showed a noticeable decrease in the contents of char and alkali metals compared to unfiltered bio-oil. This study also reported a decrease of ~2.2% in the bio-oil with HVF process. Another study demonstrated the effect of filter temperature on yields of pyrolytic products with results shown in Fig. 4 , which suggests an increase in the bio-oil yield from 400 to 475 °C, while decrease in the bio-oil yield was noticed as the temperatures increased to 550 °C [123]. Significant increase in char and gas yields was observed with HVF compared to non HVF fast pyrolysis [123]. The decrease in bio-oil yield is mainly attributed to the promotion of secondary cracking reactions catalysed by char and metal particles present in the cake layer. A study revealed that during the filtration process major cracking reactions occur in the homogeneous gas phase, while some other reactions like dehydration and decarboxylation take place heterogeneously by char particles or metals present in the cake layer [46]. The physical characteristics of the cake, concentration of metals and porosity may have significant effect on bio-oil composition, which should be studied in the future. Hence, it can be suggested that ex-situ HVF could prove significant for the removal of char and metal particles but the bio-oil yield could decrease due to the catalytic activity of char and metal particles attached to the filter that promote the secondary cracking reactions [66,117,120]. However, these challenges encountered in ex-situ HVF can be overcome and the filter fouling can be diminished if the filter is used in-situ in a continuous fluidized bed pyrolysis system. Hoekstra et al. [121] successfully tested in-situ filtration of the char particles using wire mesh filters with a 5 μm pore size. The results revealed less filter fouling and efficient process stability achieved during the continuous run of 2 h, while a significant decrease in solid contents and alkali metals was noticed in the filtered bio-oil. Besides, the liquid yield of approximately 61–62% was achieved which was comparably higher than that of pyrolysis without HVF process [121]. This technique is highly advantageous to remove the solid char particles that, if present in the bio-oil, could initiate the polymerization and condensation reactions, making the bio-oil highly unstable, hence, filtration can increase the bio-oil stability and also decreases the viscosity. However, HVF may reduce bio-oil yield significantly. The presence of char and alkali metals promotes secondary cracking reactions of pyrolytic vapours and extra residence time in the filter might also boost the cracking reactions, thereby reducing the bio-oil yields and increasing gas and char yields. Cake formation on the filter also leads to pressure deviations in filter media, which can make the operation process of filtration quite challenging. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the cake removal or regeneration to prevent pressure deviations and make filtration process stable for bio-oil upgrading. In addition, the use of filtration may increase the cost of bio-oil upgrading as the membranes used in the process are highly expensive. Besides, they need regular washing with solvents which can further make the process costly. Therefore, cost-effective and more efficient membranes should be developed for bio-oil upgrading to make the process economical and more significant. Very little or nothing has been studied to estimate the cost of filtration for bio-oil upgrading. Hence, a techno-economic study is further proposed to determine the capital and operational costs of the process and estimate the cost of the upgraded bio-oil. Filtration process removes contaminants and improves certain bio-oil properties like viscosity but high oxygen and water content and low HHV make the bio-oil a poor drop-in fuel. Therefore, filtration technique should be further integrated with other bio-oil upgrading technique such as hydrotreatment to improve the calorific value."
6,Electrochemical or electrocatalytic upgrading of bio-oil,"3.4 Electrochemical or electrocatalytic upgrading of bio-oil Electrochemical upgrading or widely known as electrocatalytic hydrogenation is a well-known process to convert the oxygenated or carbonyl containing compounds into value-added organic compounds or hydrocarbons [125–127]. However, only recently, electrocatalytic upgrading of bio-oil has been reported, which is believed to be a noteworthy alternative for conventional hydrogenation process that occurs at high temperatures and hydrogen pressures of up to 2000 MPa. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation is generally carried out in an electrolytic membrane fuel cell. The fuel cell utilizes the protons for bio-oil hydrogenation that result from the oxidation of water, therefore, eliminates the use of high-pressure hydrogen and high temperature for bio-oil upgrading, which decreases the cost of bio-oil upgrading or other chemicals. Fig. 5 shows an electrochemical cell used for bio-oil upgrading, made up of two compartments i.e. the anode and the cathode, separated by a polymer membrane that could be either cation exchange membrane (CEM) or anion exchange membrane (AEM). At the anode, the oxidation of H2O takes place, releasing O2 and H+, while at the cathode, the oxygenated compounds (in this case, bio-oil containing oxygenated compounds) are hydrogenated by the addition of H+ transferred through the membrane from the anode, evolving hydrogen during the process. At the cathode, a catalyst can be used to reduce the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and increase the conversion efficiency of the compound to the desired product. Similarly, the anode can also be modified with catalysts to improve the efficiency. A number of studies have reported the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of bio-oil model compounds to stable or value-added compounds, however, only a few studies have demonstrated the application of electrochemical cells for real bio-oil upgrading. For example, Zhao et al. [125] demonstrated the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Furfural is one of the main compounds formed during pyrolysis of hemicellulose, which can be hydrogenated to a high-value compounds i.e. furfuryl alcohol, which is widely used in chemical and polymer industries. Conventionally, furfuryl alcohol is prepared by vapour phase catalytic hydrogenation of furfural under high temperatures and high hydrogen pressures. Alternatively, electrocatalytic hydrogenation can be operated at mild temperatures and can eliminate the external supply of hydrogen, which otherwise uses the in-situ produced H2 during the electrocatalytic hydrogenation. The study by Zhao et al. [173] used H-type electrochemical cell for hydrogenation of furfural with different metal and metal-activated carbon fibre catalysts at the cathode. The results showed that sole platinum cathode showed better selectivity of approximately 99% for furfuryl alcohol as compared to copper, lead and nickel cathodes. However, the conversion or hydrogenation efficiency was found lower (8%) for the platinum cathode due to low active surface area. Subsequently, the platinum cathode was modified with high surface area activated carbon fibre catalysts, which enhanced the conversion efficiency to 82% [125]. Similarly, electrocatalytic hydrogenation of some other bio-oil model compounds has been demonstrated. For instance, phenol, guaiacol and syringol are the dominant compounds in the bio-oil composition which are usually formed during the pyrolysis of lignin content of the feedstock. Evidently, Li et al. [128] investigated the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of guaiacol in ruthenium/activated carbon cathode based two-chamber H-type electrochemical cell, Nafion-117 membrane and catholyte containing HCl, NaCl and NaOH. The major product of guaiacol hydrogenation was found to be cyclohexanol, while phenol was found to be the intermediate product. The study also suggested that during the electrochemical hydrogenation of guaiacol, demethoxygenation was the dominant deoxygenation reaction while in conventional catalytic upgrading of guaiacol, demethylation is one the major deoxygenation pathways, indicating that the former process retains more carbon in the liquid products than the latter and hence can prove more advantageous for enhanced bio-oil upgrading. After the successful demonstration of electrocatalytic hydrogenation of bio-oil model compounds, this approach has been applied for real bio-oil upgrading in few studies that showed considerable positive results for bio-oil deoxygenation. For example, Elangovan et al. [126] demonstrated bio-oil deoxygenation using an oxygen ion conducting ceramic membrane-based electrochemical cells, operated at 550 °C, while a condenser was attached to the cell to condense the vapours and was kept at 10 °C. The results reported that approximately 24.5% oxygen reduction was observed in the bio-oil after electrochemical hydrogenation and approximately 16% increase in carbon content was achieved, which could be attributed to the conversion of oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons. However, it was difficult to estimate the correct deoxygenation pathways due to the presence of numerous compounds in the bio-oil composition. In a recent study, bio-oil produced from the pine wood pyrolysis was upgraded in a dual membrane electrochemical cell, an AEM attached to the cathode and a CEM attached to the anode [127]. This demonstration showed improvements in few properties of the bio-oil, such as the pH increased from 2.6 to 4.5 and the total acid number decreased from 193 to 149 (mg of KOH/g, dry). This decrease in total acid number was attributed to the removal of carbonyl group-containing compounds, such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes, suggesting the successful hydrogenation of carbonyl moieties during the process [127]. Electrocatalytic upgrading could prove effective to convert the oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons. However, the technique has not been used extensively for real bio-oil upgrading due to some major challenges. For example, the technique utilizes costly membranes and hydrogen, which makes the process highly expensive compared to the other techniques. Moreover, it requires supply of electricity to initiate the reactions. This electricity could also be provided from other renewable technology such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) that can produce sufficient power for electrocatalytic hydrogenation. MFCs are also the electrochemical cells that use microorganisms to convert the chemical energy present in organic compounds into electricity [129,130]. Overall, it needs more development and research to make this technique more efficient and advanced to use for real bio-oil upgrading at a pilot-scale. Table 7 provides the main advantages and challenges of all methods for downstream bio-oil upgrading discussed in the previous sections. Besides making the bio-oil to a gasoline like product, it can also be upgraded to produce other clean fuels, has been discussed in the following section."
7,Hydrotreatment of bio-oil,"3.5 Hydrotreatment of bio-oil Hydrotreatment of bio-oil is the treatment with hydrogen in the presence of an active catalyst made up of metal or metal/support at temperatures between 200 and 500 °C and pressure in the range of 3–30 MPa [53,54]. It involves the removal of oxygen from oxygenated compounds of bio-oil through hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction to produce hydrocarbons and water as the by-product. The main reactions involved in bio-oil upgrading under hydrotreatment are i) hydrogenation of C − C and C − O bonds, ii) breaking of C − C bond by retro-aldol condensation and decarbonylation, iii) dehydration of C − OH groups and iv) hydrogenolysis of C − O − C bonds. Hydrotreatment is considered highly efficient for bio-oil upgrading compared to cracking since it removes oxygen in the form of H2O while in cracking oxygen is removed in the form of CO2 and CO which decreases the total carbon yield [19,53,131]. More information on the reaction mechanisms involved in the conversion of oxygenated compounds to hydrocarbons can be found elsewhere [132–134]. Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the hydrotreatment of bio-oils and has proven most valuable approach among above discussed downstream technologies for bio-oil upgrading. Hydrotreatment of bio-oils can be carried out in different reactors, such as batch, continuous and down flow reactors [135,136], are shown in Fig. 6 . Generally, the hydrotreatment is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the bio-oil is stabilized at lower temperature of between 100 and 300 °C in the presence of catalyst to convert the carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups to alcohol. Secondly, the stabilized bio-oil is treated at higher temperature around 350–400 °C where it undergoes HDO and cracking reactions in the presence of active catalysts [138,139]. The reactors can be operated at different optimized operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, relative flow rate and type of catalyst to obtain efficient bio-oil upgrading and less coke formation on the catalyst to prevent its early deactivation. For instance, temperature is one of the most important parameters to obtain the higher conversion of oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons and hence decrease the oxygen content and increase the carbon and hydrogen content in the bio-oils. A number of studies suggest that in stabilization step of hydrotreatment, a temperature range of 100–300 °C, pressures between 29 and 290 bar and reaction time interval of 0.5–4 h are ideal to obtain the bio-oil yield in the range of 17–92 wt% and oxygen content of 1–16 wt% in the bio-oils [140,141]. However, for second step of hydrotreatment, higher temperatures of more than 300 °C are required to crack the larger molecules in the bio-oil but may vary depending on the type of catalyst used for the hydrotreatment. For example, Auersvald et al. [53] investigated the effect of temperature on bio-oil hydrotreatment in a continuous flow reactor in the presence of commercial sulphide NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. Authors applied a range of temperatures of 240–360 °C and pressure of 2–8 MPa, while the hydrogen flow rate of 90 lh—1 was used in the experiments. Fig. 7 shows the results for the effect of temperature on physicochemical properties of bio-oils. It can be clearly observed from the figure that undesirable properties of the bio-oils, such as acid number and content, significantly decreased with increase in temperature from 240 to 360 °C, while the desirable properties, such as heating value and degree of deoxygenation, considerably increased with increase in the reaction temperature. Therefore, it can be estimated that the higher temperatures enhanced the deoxygenation reactions like dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation which were accompanied with hydrogenation reactions, leading to increase in H/C atomic ratio of bio-oils and decreasing O/C atomic ratio. The study also revealed that increase in hydrogen pressure from 2 to 8 MPa enhanced hydrogenation reactions, confirmed with the increase in H/C atomic ratio of bio-oils [53]. The selection of a temperature range is also essential to minimize the coke formation onto the catalyst surface during hydrotreatment of bio-oils. It is evident that temperature has a great influence on activation energies of the reactions that take place during hydrotreatment of bio-oils and it may promote the aromatization and polymerization reactions that usually favour coke formation and ultimately can lead to blockage of the reactor. Gholizadeh et al. [140] provided insightful information on the effect of temperature (370–470 °C) on coke formation and bio-oil properties during hydrotreatment of mallee wood pyrolysis oil in a continuous flow reactor using pre-sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The results showed that increasing the temperature augmented the coke formation considerably. The study reported the formation of small and large aromatic ring structures that probably occupied the active sites of catalyst and deactivated the catalyst. The study also revealed that the increase in temperature from 375 to 400 °C achieved the lowest oxygen content and highest carbon content in the bio-oils irrespective of varying bio-oil feed, however, further increase in temperature up to 450 °C marginally decreased the carbon content and increased the oxygen content in the bio-oils. The increase in oxygen content at higher temperatures can be attributed to reduced activity of the catalyst due to coke deposition [140]. The amount of coke formation on catalyst surface can be reduced by heating the hydrogen at the inlet point of the reactor. Evidently, a study demonstrated the application of active hydrogen at the inlet point of bio-oil to heat and activate the catalyst [142]. The results showed decreased coke deposition and lesser reactor blockage during hydrotreatment of bio-oil. This is probably because the active hydrogen enhanced cracking activity and reduced polymerization of polycyclic aromatics of the bio-oils. Similarly, other operating parameters such as hydrogen pressure, relative flow rate and catalyst to bio-oil feed ratio are also highly important to obtain the bio-oil with high carbon and less oxygen content, and improved calorific values. It has been noticed that increasing the hydrogen pressure enhances hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions, subsequently, increases deoxygenation activity and improves the conversion of oxygenated compounds to gasoline like products and less heavy products, while the lower hydrogen pressure may favour condensation reactions and increases heavy products in the bio-oil. Fig. 7 shows the results for the effect of hydrogen pressure on physicochemical properties of bio-oil, investigated by Auersvald et al. [53]. It can be observed from the figure that the higher hydrogen pressure of 8 MPa showed the maximum deoxygenation activity of nearly 85% compared to the lower hydrogen pressure of 2 MPa. The study reported that high hydrogen pressure of 8 MPa enhanced the hydrogenation of oxygenated compounds and produced approximately 8% of heavy products, while a higher yield of nearly 12% of heavy products was obtained with 2 MPa, owing to the promotion of condensation reactions at the lower hydrogen pressure. In addition, the values for undesirable physicochemical properties such as density, acid number, viscosity and water content decreased constantly with increase in hydrogen pressure [53]. On the other hand, the catalyst to bio-oil ratio in case of batch reactor or liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) in continuous bed reactor plays a significant role in the distribution of organic compounds in the bio-oil and coke formation on the catalyst, which ultimately affects the bio-oil quality and catalyst deactivation. LHSV is the rate at which bio-oil is fed into the hydrotreatment reactor and can be measured as h−1. A number of studies reported the application of catalyst to bio-oil ratio of 1:20 and reaction time of 1–4 h in batch reactors and LHSV of 0.05–2 h−1 in continuous bed reactors. For instance, Gholizadeh et al. [141] investigated the influence of LHSV on product distribution during hydrotreatment of bio-oil in a continuous bed reactor. They applied LHSV of 1, 2 and 3 h−1 with different amount of bio-oil (100–900 mL) at constant temperature of 375 °C and hydrogen pressure of 7 MPa. The yields of organics from the hydrotreatment of bio-oil as a function of the volume of bio-oil fed into the reactor and LHSV are shown in Fig. 8 , which suggests that increasing the LHSV from 1 to 3 h−1 increased the yield of organics and reaches plateau values when more than 500 mL of bio-oil was fed into the reactor. The study also revealed that a low LHSV of 1 h−1 produced less coke yield compared to the LHSV of 3 h−1. This is probably because increasing LHSV offered less residence time, providing less time for hydrotreatment reactions. Moreover, the number of accessible active sites of hydrogen decreases as the concentration of heavy liquid increases in the reactor with increase in LHSV. Consequently, in the absence of active hydrogen, hydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions are less favoured while polymerization reactions could be enhanced which ultimately could result in the formation of heavy products and carbonaceous species. Hydrotreatment of bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis and HTL process has been reported in several studies and various types of catalysts have been utilized for hydrotreatment of bio-oil to either convert it into a more valuable fuel with improved physico-chemical properties or other value-added products [138,155,156]. The major catalyst types used for HDO include the commercialized metal sulphides (MoS2, Ni–MoS2, and Co–MoS2), efficient noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Re) and most commonly used transition metal-based catalysts (Cu, Fe, Mo, Co and Ni) [137,157,158]. Noble metal-based catalysts are considered markedly favourable for bio-oil upgrading through HDO pathway [158]. However, their high cost and high hydrogenation activity leads to excessive hydrogen consumption, which increases the overall cost of the process [135,137]. These catalysts are highly prone to poisoning of sulphur content present in the bio-oils. On the other hand, transition metals are comparatively cheaper and possess competitive activity for bio-oil upgrading and therefore have been extensively studied for hydrotreatment of bio-oil as well as bio-oil model compounds. Table 8 presents the summary of catalysts used for hydrotreatment of bio-oil and the properties of upgraded bio-oils. Metal sulphide catalysts like NiMoS/Al2O3 and CoMoS/Al2O3 are commercialized catalysts used in petroleum refining and have been successfully utilized for hydrotreatment of bio-oils [146,159,160]. In these catalysts, Mo and S act as active parts of the catalyst. The retention of sulphur content is highly important to keep the catalyst active during the hydrotreatment of bio-oils. Since the bio-oil contains very low amount of sulphur, sulphur containing compounds like dimethyl sulphide, H2S are required to add with the feed to overcome the loss of sulphur and avoid the catalyst deactivation [159]. The presence of sulphur vacancies in the catalysts, mainly at the catalyst edges are thought to work as active sites in metal sulphide catalysts that catalyse the hydrodeoxygenation reactions [134], while the catalysts support like Al2O3 also contains acidic sites that catalyse various deoxygenation reactions like dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation and convert acids, aldehydes, ketones into hydrocarbons [161]. The addition of transition metals Ni and Cu can be used as promoters for Mo and are also believed to enhance the number of sulphur vacancies [146,160]. These promoters can donate their valence electrons to Mo, subsequently can make Mo − S weaker, resulting into more active sulphur vacancies. During hydrodeoxygenation on metal sulphide catalysts, the oxygen atom of the functional groups of the reactant is attached to sulphur vacancies and promote the breaking of C − O bond [162]. In addition, activated hydrogen from S − H groups is believed to saturate the oxygen atom released from the breaking of C − O [162]. A number of studies have reported the successful application of metal sulphide catalysts for hydrotreatment of bio-oils. For instance, Grilc et al. [163] investigated the influence of metal sulphide catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3 and MoS2 for hydrotreatment of bio-oils produced from HTL of spruce and fir sawdust at a temperature of 300 °C and hydrogen pressure of 8 MPa, and compared their activity with other catalysts like Pd/Al2O3, Pd/C, and Ni/Al2O3–SiO2. The authors examined the comparative effect of different catalysts studied on various reactions (such as hydrodeoxygenation, decarbonylation, decarboxylation and catalytic cracking) and yield of upgraded bio-oils. The results suggested that sulphide NiMo catalysts produced higher yield of upgraded bio-oil compared to oxide and reduced form of NiMo catalysts but lower than Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/C. In addition, sulphide NiMo catalysts showed high hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and catalytic cracking activity. Reduced form of NiMo catalyst also showed high hydrodeoxygenation activity but could not favour decarbonylation, decarboxylation and cracking much efficiently compared to sulphide NiMo catalyst. On the other hand, Pd/Al2O3, Pd/C, and Ni/Al2O3–SiO2 exhibited lower activity for all the reactions compared to either reduced or sulphide NiMo catalysts [163]. Biller et al. [55] studied the application of sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3 for hydrotreatment of bio-oil obtained from HTL of Chlorella. The hydrotreatment of bio-oil using both the catalysts was investigated in a batch reactor at two temperatures of 350 and 405 °C, 13.8 MPa hydrogen pressure and catalyst to bio-oil ratio of 0.2 [55]. The results reported that the application of sulphided catalysts considerably increased the conversion of oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons, as a high number of hydrocarbons was observed in the upgraded bio-oil [55]. Although the application of metal sulphide catalysts is highly advantageous for hydrotreatment technique to obtain the bio-oil with enhanced physicochemical properties and energy density, it may also lead to coke formation and subsequently, undesirable blockage of the reactor. The use of additives like methanol has shown to reduce the coke formation. Methanol may also react with carboxylic or esters groups of the bio-oil and help to reduce its corrosivity [159]. The other drawback of using sulphided catalysts is the leaching of catalyst bound sulphur into the upgraded bio-oil. Therefore, additional upgrading approach may require to remove the impurities, which ultimately can increase the overall cost of the bio-oil upgrading. The other type of catalysts widely used for hydrotreatment of bio-oils are noble metals-based catalysts, such as Rh/C, Rh/ZrO2, Ru/C, Pt/SiO2 and Pd/C, Pd/Al2O3 [139,150,158]. These catalysts show a high reactivity for H2 activation and thus can effectively saturate the oxygen atom of the functional groups of the oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil, making them highly favourable candidates for hydrotreatment of bio-oils [138]. The other advantage of noble metal-based catalysts is that they are less prone to deactivation by water or sulphur contents present in the bio-oil [133]. Consequently, a number of studies deployed noble metals on different catalytic supports for hydrotreatment of bio-oil and showed considerable improvement in the bio-oil properties and increase in H/C ratio, indicating the successful conversion of oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons. For example, Wildschut et al. [150] demonstrated the hydrotreatment of fast pyrolysis oil at 250 and 350 °C and hydrogen pressures of 10 and 20 MPa using Ru and Pt on different supports like Ru/C, Pt/C, Pd/C, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2. The results revealed that Ru/C achieved the highest yield of upgraded bio-oil and deoxygenation activity which were 60 wt% and 90 wt%, respectively, while Ru/TiO2 showed the least deoxygenation activity that can be attributed to low surface area of TiO2 [150]. Authors further suggested that other physicochemical properties of bio-oils like viscosity, water content and density were significantly reduced and notable increase in HHV of bio-oils was observed. Evidently, the HHV of upgraded bio-oil obtained using Ru/C was 43 MJ/kg, which was approximately two times higher than the feed bio-oil of 20 MJ/kg [150]. A recent study reported the application of Ru/α-Al2O3 and Ru/γ-Al2O3 on hydrotreatment of rice husk pyrolysis oil at 240 °C and hydrogen pressure of 4 MPa, reaction time of 24 h. The results showed that Ru/α-Al2O3 achieved superior activity for hydrotreatment compared to Ru/γ-Al2O3. Markedly, Ru/α-Al2O3 showed a higher bio-oil yield of nearly 80 wt%, while Ru/γ-Al2O3 could achieve a maximum bio-oil yield of 58.4 wt%. Ru/α-Al2O3 showed less coke formation than Ru/γ-Al2O3 which was ascribed to the higher acidic character of the latter catalyst [150]. In addition, Ru/α-Al2O3 produced 23.15% yield of hydrocarbons comprised of alkyl-substituted cyclohexane and alkyl-substituted benzene. The use of noble metals based catalysts showed promising results of bio-oil upgrading through hydrotreatment approach, however, noble metals are considered rare earth metals and not present abundantly. Moreover, noble metal-based catalysts are highly expensive that restricts their industrial-scale application for bio-oil upgrading. Therefore, comparatively cheaper catalysts can make the hydrotreatment approach more economical for bio-oil upgrading. Transition metals based catalysts are considered highly cost-effective and substantially efficient for hydrotreatment of bio-oils. Considering their low cost and lower hydrogen consumption, transition metals like Ni, Cu, Co, and Fe have been extensively used with and without different supports as potential catalysts for hydrotreatment of bio-oils [133,146,157]. The presence of valence electrons in their d-orbitals allows them to interact with reactants, however, electron density in the d-orbitals plays a key role in the determination of vacant coordination sites [133]. The mechanism of hydrodeoxygenation reactions over transition metals based catalysts can be understood more clearly using model compounds of the bio-oil components [164–166]. Consequently, many attempts have been made to understand the reaction mechanisms using model compounds, such as guaiacol, anisole, phenol and p-cresol [166–168]. Several studies have reported hydrotreatment of bio-oils using different monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. For instance, Yin et al. [145] investigated the effect of different transition metals based catalysts such as Ni/SiO2–ZrO2, NiCu/SiO2–ZrO2, NiMo/SiO2 and NiMoCu/SiO2 for hydrotreatment of pine wood bio-oil at 350 and 400 °C and hydrogen pressure of 14 MPa for 4 h. The results suggested that upgraded bio-oil showed higher H/C ratio with NiMo/SiO2 and NiMoCu/SiO2 catalysts compared to Ni/SiO2–ZrO2, NiCu/SiO2–ZrO2. A noticeable point was that Mo based catalysts yielded more CH4 due to enhanced methanation reactions, which could be an undesirable product in order to retain more carbon in the bio-oil [145]. Similar to transition metals, the application of metal oxides [133,146], metal phosphides [148,152,165], carbides [137,151] and nitrides [132,133] have also shown promising results for hydrotreatment of bio-oils. Hydrotreatment of bio-oils has proven an advantageous approach, nevertheless, the use of external hydrogen, arduous transport and exorbitant storage makes the overall process highly expensive. Therefore, it is important to adopt cost-effective measurements to develop the technique more affordable at industrial-scale. In order to reduce the cost of external hydrogen supply, liquid hydrogen donors, such as formic acid, ethanol and methanol can be used which can be successfully converted into hydrogen through catalytic aqueous phase reforming process. Subsequently, the produced hydrogen can be utilized in hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oils [169–171]. This approach is called in-situ hydrodeoxygenation where hydrogen is not supplied from outside rather provided from reforming reactions of hydrogen donating chemicals. In a recent study, Mohammed et al. [170] demonstrated the application of methanol in in-situ hydrodeoxygenation of Napier pyrolytic oil in the presence of Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts. The process was carried out at 350 °C, 2 wt% catalyst, 20 wt% methanol and 1 h reaction time. The results showed that the oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil were successfully converted into hydrocarbons. As a result, the upgraded bio-oil showed enhanced physicochemical properties compared to feed bio-oil. For example, feed bio-oil showed H/C ratio of 1.44, while H/C ratios of bio-oil obtained with Pd/C and Pt/C were 1.68 and 1.66, respectively. In addition, HHV was increased from 29.18 MJ/kg of feed bio-oil to 39.32 with Pd/C and 38.07 with Pt/C [170]. Alternative to the application of liquid hydrogen donors, hydrogen can also be generated from water using suitable catalysts. For instance, zinc hydrolysis can lead to generation of H2 ( Z n + H 2 O = Z n O + H 2 ), which can be further utilized for hydrotreatment of bio-oil [172]. Bio-oils also contain approximately 15–30 wt% of water content which can be converted to hydrogen and the in-situ produced hydrogen can be used for bio-oil upgrading making the whole process highly independent from external source of hydrogen. However, the amount of water present in the bio-oil might not be enough to act as solvent for all reactants to form a supercritical reaction system, hence, demanding the addition of water. A study attempted in-situ hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil using the water content of bio-oil to produce hydrogen but the authors also added water and methanol since the bio-oil contained 14.5 wt% water only, which might not be adequate to generate required amount of hydrogen for the treatment [135]. In a typical experiment, authors utilized 6 g zinc powder, 5 g Pd/C catalyst, 50 g bio-oil, 50 mL deionized water and 63 mL methanol as solvents and loaded them in a 500 mL autoclave reactor. The experiments were carried out at 200–300 °C and 5 h reaction time. The results suggested significant production of hydrocarbons in the upgraded bio-oils, producing 12.47 wt% at 200 °C and 19.36 wt% at 300 °C, while 250 °C produced the maximum hydrocarbons of 24.09 wt%. The oxygenated compounds like phenols, acids, aldehydes, ketones were reduced considerably, although esters were substantially increased. This was possibly because during hydrotreatment process ketones and aldehydes were hydrogenated into alcohols that further underwent esterification reactions to yield esters [156,173]. Therefore, in-situ hydrodeoxygenation could be an advantageous approach economically as it reduces the cost of external hydrogen supply but it also produces a low-quality bio-oil, hence, a comparative techno-economic study considering the quality of bio-oils should be conducted to understand the impact of both types of hydrodeoxygenations."
8,Commercial applications of bio-oils,"The main goal of bio-oil upgrading is to make it a competitive fuel to replace heavy fuel oil or light fuel oil for heat generation or using it as a transport fuel. The early bio-oil combustion tests for heating applications at the industrial scale have indicated the bio-oil as a suitable fuel to replace heavy fuel oil. To date, few commercial-scale applications of bio-oil have been reported for combustion in boilers, turbines and diesel engines. However, some specific modifications are required in the combustion equipment for bio-oil as compared to the conventional fuels. In boilers, a variety of fuels can be used for heat generation where bio-oil has also proved to be a suitable fuel for boilers for heat generation with acceptable emissions. For example, the combustion properties of bio-oils were tested in a test boiler on 4 MW output level in Finland [30]. The study demonstrated the combustion of different bio-oils in the boiler, modified with a special type of front head to avoid heat loss and an extra cylinder inside the furnace to obtain higher temperature and faster volatilization. The bio-oil samples were added with 10% methanol to increase the homogeneity and to enhance the combustibility and ignition. The combustion results suggested that the bio-oils were of high grade and the NOx emissions were competitive to heavy fuel oil and extremely lower to the standard emission value (120 mg/MJ for 50–150 MW boiler) in Finland. Noticeably, the NOx emissions were reported to be 88 mg/MJ for bio-oil, while the combustion of heavy fuel oil produced NOx emissions of 88 mg/MJ [30]. Alternatively, combustion of bio-oil has been also tested in a gas turbine for heat generation. Earlier [174], carried out bio-oil combustion in small gas turbine type T216 with capacity to generate 75 kW electric power. The combustion chamber of the gas turbine was modified with inline fuel nozzles i.e. an ignition nozzle and second the main nozzle. The gas turbine was started using diesel oil, firstly, diesel oil was used to operate the ignition nozzle and the bio-oil was supplied to the main nozzle using an external fuel pump. This gas turbine with dual fuel operation generated power of 580 kWth, which was lower to sole diesel fuel operation (791 kWth). However, the former mode resulted in lower NOx emissions as compared to the latter [174]. Recently, a study also reported the bio-oil combustion in a micro gas turbine [28]. The tests were performed using pure bio-oil and bio-oil/ethanol ratios of 20/80 and 50/50% (volume fractions), and the results were compared with the combustion of sole diesel fuel and ethanol. The results reported that pure bio-oil and the blend fuels with a higher fraction of bio-oil showed higher emissions of CO and NOx than sole diesel fuel and ethanol. These increased emissions of CO and NOx were attributed to the formation of larger droplets by the viscous bio-oil and fuel-bound nitrogen, respectively. However, the blend fuels showed better electrical efficiency compared to the diesel fuel, which was ascribed to the higher production of water vapour during the combustion process [28]. In addition to boilers and turbines, combustion of bio-oil has been successfully demonstrated in diesel engines for power generation. Generally, the diesel engines show higher efficiency for power generation as compared to boilers and turbines. Laesecke et al. [8] demonstrated the combustion of bio-oil in a diesel engine using 0.45 L Ricardo single cylinder direct injection diesel engine. The bio-oil showed approximately similar thermal efficiency to the diesel fuel, however, combustion air preheating of bio-oil (55 °C) was required for ignition. The longer ignition delay time with the bio-oil could be related to the chemical composition of the bio-oil. Recently, another demonstration showed the combustion behavior of bio-oil and its blends with biodiesel in a single cylinder research engine [29]. The testing results indicated that pure bio-oil and the blend fuels with the higher concentration of bio-oil showed longer ignition delays as compared to the diesel fuel, due to the reduction in cetane number and lower heating values. The above discussion suggests that the bio-oil has a great potential to serve as a potential fuel in turbines, boilers and diesel engines for heat and power generation. However, some modifications are still required either in the combustion units or mixing the bio-oil with the solvents like ethanol, methanol or diesel fuel to avoid the ignition time delays. On the other hand, application of bio-oil as a transport fuel needs more investigation. Currently, the lower heating values, chemical instability and other poor physical properties restrict its use in internal combustion engines. The bio-oil upgrading to a suitable transport fuel needs complete removal of oxygenated compounds and presence of naphthenes, paraffins and aromatic hydrocarbons and the other physical properties should also be improved to make it a realistic drop-in fuel. Besides, the production of bio-oil at a large scale similar to the cost of conventional fuels is one of the key challenges to overcome to make the bio-oil economical and affordable to the consumers."
9,Bio-oil upgrading to hydrogen/syngas via steam reforming,"The bio-oil generated from biomass pyrolysis or HTL process could also be a suitable feedstock for steam reforming (SR) technique for the production of H2 gas and synthesis gas (also termed as syngas is a mixture of CO and H2)·H2 produced from SR of bio-oil can be further used as a clean fuel as its combustion produces water and no harmful gases are generated or it can also be used in hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil for the synthesis of gasoline-like products, while syngas can be further subjected to Fischer-Tropsch process for the production of hydrocarbons. SR is a process that involves the conversion of bio-oil containing oxygenated compounds or hydrocarbons into hydrogen in the presence of water at a temperature range of 350–1000 °C [62,63]. SR of an oxygenated compound of bio-oil can be represented as following in eq. (4). (4) C n H m O k + ( n − k ) H 2 O → n C O + ( n + m 2 − k ) H 2 The presence of the higher amount of steam in the process can lead to water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) that involves the conversion of CO into CO2 and H2 gas, as shown in eq. (5), while at low temperatures, H2 produced in the process can combine with CO to generate methane, as given in eq. (6). (5) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 (6) C O + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 4 + H 2 O It is also interesting to note that for a complete SR reaction, 1 mol of CO is lost for each mole of H2 produced (eq. (5)), and in methanation reaction (eq. (6)), 3 mol of hydrogen are lost for each mole of CH4. From thermodynamics point of view, the reforming reaction (eq. (4)) is an endothermic reaction and occurs at high temperature and low pressures, while WGSR and methanation shown in eqs. (5) and (6), respectively are exothermic reactions and take place at lower temperatures [175]. Therefore, the endothermic reforming reaction is usually performed in the high-temperature reactor, and the resultant products are transferred to another reactor of lower temperature to carry out the exothermic conversion reactions. SR of bio-oil can be carried out in different types of reactors, such as combined two stage pyrolysis-reforming reactor, separate fixed bed reactor and fluidized bed reactor, tubular quartz micro-reactor, membrane reactor, spouted bed reactor, and nozzle-fed reactor [56]. Some reactors are shown in Figs. 9–11 . Several studies have employed fixed bed reactor for SR of bio-oil [56,175,176]. However, it is believed that fixed-bed reactor is convenient to reform only lighter model compounds of bio-oil such as acetic acid and ethanol, while the reforming of larger model compounds or crude bio-oil leaves large amount of residue in the reactor and subsequent heating may lead to thermal degradation and formation of coke. Therefore, to reduce the coke formation during SR of bio-oil or larger bio-oil model compounds, fluidized bed reactor has been widely used and it is thought that the reforming process can be operated more efficiently than fixed bed reactor [56,59,60]. Where in fixed bed reactor a layer of coke can be easily formed, in fluidized bed reactor the circulated catalyst particles are in direct contact with bio-oil components and thus less coke formation and more hydrogen yield can be obtained. Evidently, a study compared the activity of SR of bio-oil for hydrogen production in a fixed and fluidized bed reactor using Ni based catalyst and also observed the coke formation in both reactors at similar reaction conditions [177]. The results revealed that carbon deposition was severe in fixed bed reactor compared to fluidized bed which suggests quicker catalyst deactivation in the former. Since the fluidized bed showed lesser coke formation, it produced a higher yield of hydrogen, approximately 76%, which was 7% greater than the fixed bed [177]. However, coke deposition is still one of the limitations in fluidized beds. Other limitations associated with catalyst deactivation in fluidized beds are sintering and attrition. These processes result in the loss of active components of catalysts. More information on the mechanism of attrition of catalyst in fluidized bed can be found elsewhere [178]. Fluidized bed reactors could be made up of two beds, in which one bed is used for SR process and the other is used to regenerate the catalyst by gasification or oxidation. Alternatively, combined fixed and fluidized bed reactor can also be used for SR of bio-oil which allows to carry out the whole process at two different temperatures [56,179]. In this combined unit, fluidized bed is used to evaporate the bio-oil at lower temperatures of 430–500 °C, while steam reforming is carried out in the fixed bed at higher temperature of >700 °C in the presence of an active catalyst [179]. Another alternative to reduce the coke deposition on catalyst is the application of two stage catalytic reforming process, as shown in Fig. 11 [180,181]. In the first stage, a less active catalyst is used at temperature of 400–600 °C, while the second stage is operated with more active catalyst at temperature >700 °C. It is believed that in two stage reactor systems, coke generating precursors are reduced in the first stage, converting macromolecules of bio-oil into smaller compounds that lowers coke deposition in the second stage, consequently, it produces enhanced yield of syngas or H2 and stabilizes the activity of a catalyst in long term reaction. For example, Ren et al. [181] demonstrated the application of two stage SR of bio-oil, using quartz sand in first-stage fluidized bed reactor and Ni/dolomite for second stage fixed bed reactor and compared the reforming results with single stage fixed bed SR at 800 °C. The results showed that two stage SR produced a higher H2 yield of 85.3% in 1 h of reaction time, while single stage could produce 80% of H2 yield. After 3 h of reaction time, H2 yield decreased nearly 10% in single stage fixed reactor but only 5.6% reduction in H2 yield was noticed in two stage system, owing to reduced coke formation in the system [181]. Another study by Liu et al. [180] performed two stage catalytic SR of bio-oil using Fe/biochar in the first stage (or pre-reforming) at 350–600 °C and Ni–Ca/γ-Al2O3 in second stage at 700 °C. The study suggested that Fe/biochar in the pre-reforming stage converted coke precursors like polycyclic aromatics, naphthalenes and benzene into furans, phenols and other non-aromatic compounds, which were successfully converted to H2 and syngas in the second stage by Ni catalyst. The decrease in coke precursor compounds inhibits polymerization of volatiles and hence the coke formation on the catalyst in the second stage [181]. As a result, enhanced yield of H2 was achieved, indicating two stage catalytic reforming process an advantageous and efficient approach to reduce the coke formation and obtain a higher yield of H2. SR of bio-oil can be performed in different reactors on the type or composition of bio-oil under varying operating parameters, such as temperature, steam/carbon (S/C) ratio and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) or space time which greatly influence the conversion rate of bio-oil, yield of H2, and coke formation on the catalyst [62,175,183]. Generally, the smaller compounds like acetic acid require a low temperature of nearly 450 °C for its full conversion, while the larger compounds or polyaromatic compounds require a higher temperature of >750 °C for its complete conversion in the process. Therefore, SR of bio-oil is usually carried out between 400 and 1000 °C in a fixed or fluidized bed reactor. Valle et al. [184] investigated the effect of temperature range of 550–700 °C on H2 yield, bio-oil conversion and coke formation during SR of pine wood bio-oil in a continuous two-step system using Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 as the catalyst. It was found that H2 yield and bio-oil conversion increased with increase in temperature, showing the H2 yield of nearly 30% at 550 °C which increased to above 70% at 700 °C with a space time of >0.10 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil and S/C ratio of 1.5. However, increase in the temperature showed increased the coke deposition on the Ni catalyst. For example, 14.8 wt% coke was observed at 600 °C where 700 °C produced 21.4 wt% of coke with 0.04 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil of space time, S/C ratio of 1.5 and 5 h of reaction time [184]. It was further noticed that 550–650 °C range produced filamentous type of coke which does not block the active sites of the catalyst and therefore has less impact on the catalyst deactivation [184]. Similarly, Remiro et al. [185] examined the effect of temperature range of 500–800 °C on SR of aqueous fraction of bio-oil. The results revealed that a complete bio-oil conversion was achieved at 700 °C and the highest H2 yield of 95% was obtained with 5 h of reaction time [185]. Another key parameter for SR is S/C ratio to achieve a higher yield of H2 [183,186]. Generally, water is added to the bio-oil to obtain the desirable S/C ratio. Studies have shown that higher S/C ratio (>3) is advantageous to change the thermodynamic equilibrium of reforming and WGSR towards H2 production, consequently leading to the higher yield of H2. For instance, a study showed approximately 93% H2 yield with S/C ratio of 6, while S/C ratio of 1.5 could achieve a maximum H2 yield of nearly 78% [183]. Moreover, the higher amount of steam can also help to gasify some amount of carbonaceous species, thus, minimizing the risk of catalyst deactivation. However, the higher amount of steam can reduce the energy efficiency of SR process since it requires higher amount of energy to evaporate water at the required temperature [187]. Therefore, a suitable S/C ratio is pivotal to achieve the maximum H2 yield. In addition to S/C ratio, the selection of space time or WHSV is highly important to obtain optimum yield of H2 and bio-oil conversion in reforming reaction. Higher the space time or WHSV means longer the time catalyst can react with bio-oil components and therefore could be favourable to produce high H2 yield. Valle et al. [184] applied different space time (0.04, 0.10, 0.19 and 0.38 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil) for SR of bio-oil and examined its effect on hydrogen production. The results of the study are shown in Fig. 12 , which suggested that a space time of 0.19 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil was favourable to convert the all bio-oil into H2, obtaining the maximum H2 yield of nearly 93% with a S/C ratio of 6 and temperature of 700 °C. In addition, these operating condition were also ideal to form undesirable by-products, such as CH4 and C2–C4 hydrocarbons as negligible amount of CH4 and nearly no C2–C4 hydrocarbons were found with a space time of 0.19 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil [184]. On the other hand, increase in space time from 0.04 to 0.38 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil showed a constant decrease in coke formation, 0.04 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil producing the largest amount of coke of 17.3 wt% which reduced significantly to 6.7 wt% with 0.38 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil [184]. A highly active and stable catalyst is usually required to enhance the rate of SR reaction and increase the yield of H2 [188]. A desirable catalyst should be able to promote WGSR and favour the breaking of C–C, C–H, and OH bonds, and less prone to deactivation due to coke formation [189]. In this regard, noble metals like Pt and Rh or non-noble metals such as Ni, Co, Ce and Fe dispersed on different supports like Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO3–Al2O3, HZSM-5 and carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been widely explored in various modes of SR of bio-oil [62,182,188]. For instance, a study compared the activity of the noble metals Pt and Rh supported on Al2O3 and CeZrO2 for SR for beech wood bio-oil [190]. The results of the study are shown in Fig. 13 . It can be predicted from the results that Al203 based catalysts were less active for hydrogen production compared to CeZrO2 catalysts. This is probably because CeZrO2 exhibits redox properties and may carry out additional set of reactions compared to Al2O3 based catalysts. It was further noticed that Rh/CeZrO2 and Pt/CeZrO2 catalysts showed almost similar yields of H2 but Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst was found to maintain the reforming activity for a long-term reaction, producing more than 50% of H2 over 9 h, which can be attributed to better WGSR activity of Pt [190]. On the other hand, among non-noble metals, Ni-based catalysts have shown promising activity for WGSR and bond breaking and hence different Ni-based monometallic and bimetallic catalysts have been widely used for SR of bio-oil for enhanced H2 production. For example, Santamaria et al. [182] demonstrated the application of Ni/ZrO2 for SR of the bio-oil (produced from pyrolysis of pine wood at 500 °C) in a fluidized bed reactor at 600 °C and achieved a maximum H2 yield of 92.4%. In a separate study, Bizkarra et al. [58] carried out SR of bio-oil in a continuous fixed bed reactor using different Ni-based monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The SR reactions were operated using S/C ratio of 5 and at atmospheric pressure. The results showed that monometallic catalyst, Ni/Al2O3 showed a maximum H2 yield of 90%, which continuously decreased and reached to 35% after 3 h of operating time, attributing to the faster deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation. However, Ni/CeO3–Al2O3 showed more resistance to the coke formation and maintained high activity for H2 production for a longer period, which was attributed to the higher oxygen mobility by the ceria particles as compared to the sole Al2O3 [58]. Noticeably, compared to the monometallic catalysts, the bimetallic catalyst, Rh–Ni/CeO3–Al2O3 showed better activity and stability for H2 for a longer period of time. The catalyst showed a H2 yield of nearly 60% from starting to the end of the reaction, which was ascribed to the significant activity of the catalyst for oxidation of carbon instead of favoring carbon deposition, consequently, resulting in the higher resistance to catalyst deactivation and better catalytic activity towards H2 production [58]. Several other catalysts using different metals and supports have been utilized for SR of bio-oil, some examples are given in Table 9 . The kinetics of SR process for bio-oil has been less explored so far. Although several studies have been conducted to understand the SR reactions using model compounds like butanol and ethanol [191–193]. For instance, Vaidya and Rodrigues [193] examined the kinetics of ethanol reforming for hydrogen production in the presence of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at 600 and 700 °C. The authors concluded that SR of ethanol over Ru/Al2O3 catalyst involves three reactions in which the first reaction is irreversible and the latter two are reversible: (7) 1. C 2 H 5 O H + H 2 O → C O 2 + C H 4 + 2 H 2 (8) 2. C H 4 + H 2 O ↔ C O + 3 H 2 (9) 4. C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 The study suggests that the increase in temperature enhances ethanol conversion and above 700 °C, intermediate products like CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and CH2CHO are also formed that are steam reformed to produce CO2 and H2 [193]. A total of 6 mol of H2 and 2 mol of CO2 could be produced. It was further noticed that ethanol reforming follows first order kinetics and requires an activation energy of 96 kJ mol−1 [193]. However, the kinetics of ethanol reforming to hydrogen production under similar conditions over different catalysts can be varied and different values of activation energies can be obtained [192,194]. Similarly, the kinetics of other oxygenated compounds like acetic acid has been widely studied on different types of catalysts. Overall, SR of bio-oil is a promising approach to generate clean fuel like H2 and the studies have shown that significant conversion rates of bio-oil to H2 or a higher H2 yield of more than 90% can be obtained using catalytic SR. The main concern of catalytic SR is the catalyst deactivation. As the reaction is carried out usually at higher temperatures, the metals such as Ni in the catalyst can be sintered, which consequently affect the catalytic activity during the SR reaction. The formation of carbonaceous species during the reaction could occupy or block the active sites on the catalyst surface, initiating the prompt deactivation of the catalyst and leading to decreased catalytic activity. In addition, Ni is believed to be less active for WGSR and more active for methanation, which may result into lower H2 yields. Therefore, the performance of Ni based catalysts can be further improved by its modification with the addition of Cu and Co metals that are highly active WGSR and less active for methanation. The addition of metal oxides, such as CeO2 and MgO can also increase adsorption and activation of water, thereby increasing WGSR. Metal oxides can also enhance the oxygen storage capacity which can help to gasify carbonaceous species and minimize the catalyst deactivation. Therefore, the development of versatile catalysts with multiple functions that are highly efficient and less prone to deactivation is necessary for the successful conversion of different compounds in SR process."
10,Trends and future perspectives,
11,Techno-economic analysis,"6.1 Techno-economic analysis Thermochemical technologies, like fast pyrolysis and HTL, are used for bio-oil production and subsequently, upgrading techniques are applied to enhance the bio-oil properties to make a competitive fuel for real applications. In addition to the quality of bio-oil, it is also important to examine the cost involved in different steps of these processes and estimate the price of upgraded bio-oil. Additionally, a comparative techno-economic analysis between different approaches can help to adopt the appropriate technique that suggests highest energy conversion efficiency and maximum bio-oil production with minimum investment. In this regard, several techno-economic studies have been conducted for bio-oil production from fast pyrolysis, HTL and combined upgrading techniques [199–201]. The major cost involved in pyrolysis bio-oil production is from buying, transporting and drying of feedstocks, and electrical consumption during pyrolysis process. The total cost for electrical consumption can be reduced if the bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis process is used in a diesel engine for power generation. In this case, approximately 18% of bio-oil would be consumed. The cost of bio-oil production could be further reduced to 18% by selling the biochar that is also produced during the pyrolysis process [202]. The estimated cost for bio-oil production from fast pyrolysis of energy crops like willow and miscanthus is $12-$26/GJ [202]. A comparative techno-economic study between pyrolysis and HTL using a similar feedstock can provide better insights for economical bio-oil production. To confirm this, a recent study conducted a comparative techno-economic analysis for biofuel production through HTL and pyrolysis using sugarcane bagasse as the feedstock [198]. The estimated costs involved in different steps of pyrolysis and HTL of sugarcane bagasse have been outlined in Table 10 [198]. The study suggested that pyrolysis technique is more profitable for biofuel production compared to HTL. The results showed that liquefaction of biomass requires more energy inputs, mainly to pump liquefaction slurry at a high flow rate and liquefaction pressure. Besides, the use of ethanol also increases the operating cost in liquefaction process which is not required in pyrolysis. The total operating costs were estimated at $14.57 million/year for liquefaction and $6.16 million/year for pyrolysis process using the similar amount of the feedstock. On the other hand, the revenue obtained from unit price for HTL was higher compared to the pyrolysis, which could be attributed to the generation of different annual volumes of the products. Since the operating costs are higher than the revenue, unit margin (US$/L) is more suitable to compare the profits or losses of the process, which can be calculated with the following formula: U n i t m a r g i n ( US$ L ) = A n n u a l r e v e n u e − A n n u a l o p e a r a t i o n a l c o s t s A n n u a l p r o d u c t i o n v o l u m e The authors further suggested that the lower negative value of the unit margin indicates cost-effectiveness or profitability of the process. In this regard, the unit margin for pyrolysis was estimated to be $-0.21/L, while it was $-0.24/L for liquefaction [198]. Therefore, it can be suggested that pyrolysis technique is more favourable or economical for bio-oil production compared to liquefaction process. Various techno-economic studies of biomass fast pyrolysis estimated the cost of produced bio-oil to be in the range of $0.11-$0.65/Litre [200,203]. Integration of bio-oil production from either pyrolysis or liquefaction process with any upgrading approach such as solvent addition or hydrotreatment further increases the cost of bio-oil. Techno-economic analysis of an integrated process has been widely studied for hydrotreatment but has been rarely reported for other approaches like emulsification, solvent addition and electrochemical treatment. For example, Wright et al. [203] estimated the cost of bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of corn stover and upgraded with hydrotreatment, assuming two scenarios, one of which includes hydrogen production from a fraction of the bio-oil produced during the pyrolysis process and the other relies on purchasing hydrogen. Initial economic results showed that purchasing hydrogen for bio-oil upgrading would be more economical compared to producing the hydrogen as hydrogen production requires higher capital investment which would be approximately $287 millions compared to merchant hydrogen of $200 millions. The study further suggested that the upgraded bio-oil would cost nearly $1.73 and $0.90 per litre for hydrogen production and merchant hydrogen scenarios, respectively [203]. Sensitivity results indicated that process variables such as biomass cost and electricity supply in both scenarios had great influence on the final cost of the bio-oil, while the low fuel conversion yield could also be achieved due to reduced performance of the pyrolysis reactor, losses occurred during bio-oil collection and storage, and poor bio-oil upgrading yields [203]. On the other hand, Zhu et al. [204] conducted techno-economic analysis of bio-oil production through HTL and its further upgrading via hydrotreatment. Two scenarios were applied to evaluate the bio-oil production cost. The first scenario was based on using the parameters currently available and the second was based on advanced technologies in a commercial system. The annual production rates for upgraded bio-oil for the first and second scenario were $42.9 millions and $69.9 millions GGE (gallon gasoline-equivalent), respectively. The second scenario assumes the utilization of advanced technology that could reduce the organic loss and enhance the bio-oil yield compared to the first scenario, showing approximately 40.5% bio-oil yield which was estimated to be 29.4% for the first scenario. The minimum fuel selling price for the upgraded bio-oil was estimated to be $0.74/Litre for the second and $1.29/Litre for the first scenario [204]. The major factors affecting the bio-oil production cost were found to be feedstock cost, product yield and cost of upgrading equipment [204]. Furthermore, it has been inferred that the production of upgraded bio-oil which is equivalent to gasoline or diesel like liquid fuel could be economically attractive if the bio-oil is available at the cost of $0.11/Litre and should be sold at the cost of more than $0.31/Litre [96]. However, previous studies suggest that the cost of upgraded bio-oil production is still higher than the desired cost to make it a commercial liquid fuel. Therefore, more efforts are required to reduce the operating cost of the processes to obtain the bio-oil at cheaper prices. The economic feasibility of hydrogen production through SR of bio-oil has been also investigated [201,205,206]. Sarkar and Kumar [205] carried out fast pyrolysis of forest (whole-tree biomass and forest residue) and agricultural biomass (wheat and barley straw) for bio-oil production at a plant capacity of 2000 dry tonnes/day and its further SR for hydrogen production at a plant which has a capacity of processing 1198 tonnes bio-oil/day. The results showed that hydrogen production from forest biomass is economically more feasible compared to agricultural biomass, suggesting the cost of hydrogen production around $2.40/kg of H2 from whole-tree biomass, $3.00/kg of H2 for forest residue and $4.55/kg of H2 for agricultural biomass. Costs for feedstock transport and capital cost for bio-oil production were major contributions for production of H2 cost, contributing almost 34% of the total cost. In a separate study, Zhang et al. [201] estimated the cost of hydrogen production via SR of bio-oil and suggested that a total capital investment of $333 millions would be required at a 2000 t/day capacity plant, which could produce hydrogen around 160 t/day, indicating the cost of H2 in a range of $2.33 and $4.33/kg of H2."
12,Policy analysis,"6.2 Policy analysis Renewable Energy Directive of European commission has set the target to have 32% renewable fuels in the energy mix by 2030 which was nearly 17.5% in 2017. Pyrolysis and HTL technologies have shown promising potential to produce a low-cost liquid fuel that is bio-oil, which is foreseen to compete with conventional fossil fuels in the near future. However, poor physicochemical properties of the bio-oil mainly due to the high oxygen content is great challenge to make it a drop-in fuel. Although several approaches can be employed to improve poor physicochemical properties and convert oxygen containing compounds into high energy density hydrocarbons, the bio-oil is still not regarded as a drop-in fuel. This is mainly associated with production cost of bio-oil regardless of the production technology and the integration with bio-oil upgrading technique that influences the commercialization of bio-oil. Different techno-economic studies estimate high cost for feedstock sourcing, capital and operating expenses, lower process yields that ultimately contribute to the high cost of produced bio-oil. Moreover, the degree of sensitivity for these parameters could vary for different bio-oil upgrading approaches. Therefore, there is a high need of dedicated policies to reduce the capital and operating costs to promote the development and commercialization of bio-oil. To reduce the cost of feedstock transportation, the establishment of facilities for bio-oil production near to the feedstock source could be a feasible option. A sustainable management of land use is required for growing desirable crops that result in higher yield of bio-oil that could be advantageous for economical bio-oil production at a large-scale. On the other hand, the capital investment for bio-oil upgrading can be minimized by integrating the bio-oil production unit with the existing oil refining industry. In this way, the already built infrastructure can be used for bio-oil upgrading facilities and can minimize the capital cost. It has been estimated that oil refineries around the world would be used less for gasoline production and more for diesel and jet fuels, projecting the change in petroleum feed from fluid catalytic cracking units to hydrocracking units [96]. Therefore, oil refineries can be employed for hydrotreatment of bio-oils. Overall, effective policies are essentially required to reduce the capital cost for bio-oil production and commercialization of bio-oil to achieve the desirable target of renewable fuel generation."
13,Challenges and future recommendations,"6.3 Challenges and future recommendations The downstream approaches employed for bio-oil upgrading have shown promising results to improve certain physicochemical properties of the bio-oil. There are also certain challenges associated with the techniques which can be seen as possible research opportunities in the near future. For example, solvent addition and emulsification approaches are highly advantageous to increase the stability and calorific value of bio-oil. However, solvent addition can also increase water content of the bio-oil and decreases the pH, while to obtain a stable emulsion, additional physical techniques like ultrasonication and stirring are required. The necessity of surfactant in emulsification further increases the cost for bio-oil upgrading. Very less is known about the reaction mechanisms between solvents and bio-oil components. Therefore, more research studies can be conducted using bio-oil model compounds to understand the reaction chemistry during solvent addition and emulsification techniques. On the other hand, filtration removes the solid char particles from the bio-oil which otherwise could be detrimental for bio-oil stability as they can promote polymerization and condensation reactions. However, the use of filtration may increase the cost of bio-oil upgrading as the membranes used in the process are highly expensive. In addition, membranes need regular washing with solvents which can further make the process costly. Therefore, cost effective and more efficient membranes should be developed for bio-oil upgrading to make the process economical. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation approach is still in its infancy stage for real bio-oil upgrading although it has been widely used for processing of model compounds. The major challenges associated with the technique is utilization of high-priced membranes and hydrogen. Thus, development of cost-effective and high-performance ion exchange membrane is essentially required to make the technique economical. To decrease the hydrogen cost, electrochemical cells can be integrated with other systems such as steam reforming that can utilize bio-oil for hydrogen production, although converting it into a reality would require extensive research work since it requires significant capital investment and operational costs. Other main challenge in electrochemical hydrogenation is supply of electricity to initiate the reactions. To minimize the cost of electricity and make the technique more sustainable it can be integrated with other renewable technologies, such as microbial fuel cells that can produce required electricity that can be supplied to electrocatalytic hydrogenation of bio-oil. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis should be carried out to examine the extent of deoxygenation of bio-oil in electrochemical cells to optimize operating cost, use of external hydrogen, and greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrotreatment of bio-oil is considered the most promising approach to obtain hydrocarbon rich bio-oil, has shown almost 100% of conversion of oxygenated compounds to hydrocarbons and other high value-added products. Nevertheless, the technique faces critical challenges which should be addressed to make the process feasible at the commercial scale. The major challenge is associated with the cost of external hydrogen, its storage and transportation. To reduce the cost of external hydrogen supply, some liquid hydrogen donors such as ethanol can be used for in-situ hydrogen production and the produced hydrogen can be utilized in hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil. However, feasibility of the process to produce affordable bio-oil has not been examined so far. Therefore, a techno-economic study should be conducted to determine the operating cost and degree of bio-oil upgrading. Other challenges in hydrotreatment process are associated with the application of catalysts. For example, metal sulphide catalysts are highly prone to coke formation which may lead to unfavorable blockage of the reactor. The other disadvantage of using sulphided catalysts is the leaching of catalyst bound sulphur into the upgraded bio-oil which demands additional upgrading approach to remove the impurities, which ultimately can increase the overall cost of the bio-oil upgrading. Noble metal-based catalysts are highly expensive that restricts their industrial-scale application for bio-oil upgrading. On the other hand, transition metal-based catalysts are also sensitive to coke deposition at high temperature and pressure conditions, which leads to their early deactivation. The acidic nature of catalyst supports like Al2O3, zeolite is also unfavorable as the water content present in the bio-oils adsorbs onto active sites, resulting in the catalyst deactivation [138]. The formation of aromatic hydrocarbons is suitable up to certain concentrations, for instance, 40% in gasoline as aromatics act as precursors for coke formation and thus their high concentrations are prone to coking reactions and ultimately reactor plugging. Hydrogenation of aromatic rings is quite challenging because it requires highly active catalysts and stringent reaction conditions like high temperatures and hydrogen pressures of up to 8 MPa [158]. To produce more stable bio-oil and less coke deposition, two stage hydrotreatment can be carried out. In the first stage, lower temperatures up to 250 °C can be applied in the presence of a less active catalyst that converts large molecular compounds (which are thought to contribute for coke formation) into smaller compounds, the resultant bio-oil with intermediate compounds is considered stabilized. In the second stage, higher temperatures >350 °C can be applied in the presence of a more active catalyst to successfully convert the oxygenated compounds into high energy density hydrocarbons. SR of bio-oil is a promising approach to generate H2 or syngas. The main concern of catalytic SR is the catalyst deactivation. The metals such as Ni in the catalyst can be sintered at higher temperatures, which consequently affect the catalytic activity during the SR reaction. In addition, coke formation blocks the active sites on the catalyst surface, initiating the prompt deactivation of the catalyst and leading to reduced catalytic activity. Therefore, the development of advanced catalysts that are highly efficient and less prone to deactivation is necessary for the SR process. The catalysts can be promoted with metal oxides like CeO2 and MgO that increase adsorption and activation of water, which helps to enhance WGSR. Oxygen storage capacity of metal oxides can also help to gasify carbonaceous species and minimize the catalyst deactivation."
14,Conclusions,"This review article comprehensively reviewed predominantly applied downstream processing techniques such as solvent addition, emulsification, filtration, hydrotreatment, electrochemical hydrogenation for bio-oil upgrading, and steam reforming of bio-oil for hydrogen production. Significant improvement in bio-oil properties can be achieved using these techniques. It has been shown that in the downstream bio-oil upgrading, certain bio-oil properties, such as viscosity, pH, HHV and bio-oil stability can be considerably improved with polar solvents, like ethanol and methanol, and by preparing emulsions with diesel using surfactants, like Span 80 and Tween 60. However, the addition of solvents may increase the water content and decrease pH of the bio-oils. In addition, less is known about the reaction mechanisms between solvents and bio-oil components. Therefore, more research studies can be conducted to understand the mechanisms, which can help to make the process more feasible for enhanced bio-oil upgrading. Microfiltration and hot vapour filtration methods are highly beneficial to separate char particles and inorganic species present in the bio-oil but at the expense of a decrease in bio-oil yield due to enhanced secondary cracking reactions promoted by char particles and metals. Since filtration removes contaminants from the bio-oil it protects downstream equipment from corrosion and catalysts from poisoning. Formation of cake layer on filter is another challenge with hot vapour filtration associated with fast pyrolysis. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the cake removal or regeneration to make filtration process stable for bio-oil upgrading. Hydrotreatment has proven an advantageous approach to obtain the bio-oil rich in hydrocarbons and high energy density, nevertheless, the use of external hydrogen, transport and storage makes the overall process highly expensive. The cost of upgraded bio-oil obtained from hydrotreatment has been estimated between $0.74 and $1.80/L, which is still higher than the desired cost to make it a commercial liquid fuel. Therefore, more efforts are required to reduce the operating cost of the processes to obtain the bio-oil at cheaper prices. Recently, electrocatalytic hydrogenation has emerged as a novel approach for bio-oil upgrading and is effective to remove carbonyl-containing compounds in the bio-oil. It also improves the bio-oil-properties, such as increasing the pH and decreasing the acid values. However, the technique requires external supply of electricity and utilizes costly membranes and hydrogen, which makes the process highly expensive compared to the other techniques. Extensive research is required to make this technique more efficient and advanced to use for real bio-oil upgrading at a pilot-scale. Alternatively, the bio-oil could also be subjected to steam reforming to generate H2 and syngas, where H2 can be directly used a clean fuel, while syngas can be further subjected to Fischer-Tropsch process for production of hydrocarbons. The main concern of catalytic steam reforming is the catalyst deactivation. As the reaction is carried out usually at higher temperatures, the metals such as Ni in the catalyst can be sintered, which consequently affect the catalytic activity during the SR reaction. The addition of metals like Cu, Co and metal oxides, such as CeO2 and MgO increase adsorption and activation of water, thereby increases water gas shift reaction and hydrogen production. Coke formation is a major challenge for steam reforming of bio-oil. Thus, the development of versatile catalysts with multiple functions that are highly efficient and less prone to deactivation is necessary for the successful conversion of different compounds in SR process. To sum up, the bio-oil is still not regarded as a drop-in fuel. This is mainly associated with production cost of bio-oil regardless of the production technology and the integration with bio-oil upgrading technique. Therefore, there is a high need of dedicated policies to reduce the capital and operating costs to promote the development and commercialization of bio-oil."
