0,Introduction,"Hydrogen bonds constitute a very interesting class of intermolecular interactions, which are extremely important in many fields of chemistry and molecular biology [1]. The study of hydrogen bonding by means of infrared spectroscopy has found wide applications and an exhaustive account of the procedures adopted [2]. Benzyl alcohol and its substituents are found in the natural products and used for mechanistic investigation [3–5]. Benzyl alcohol is mainly used in flavour industries, perfumery, artificial essences, cosmetics, paints, lacquers, soap and industrial solvents [6]. Butyl methacrylate is an important industrial chemical used as a precursor in the production of high polymeric species and wider area of utility in the fields like dentistry, medicine, pharmaceuticals and optical plastics [7]. Krueger and Hawkins [8] reported the OH stretching frequency of substituted benzyl alcohols (methoxy, methyl, chloro and nitro) in carbon tetrachloride using infrared technique. Forland et al. [9] discussed the self association of benzyl alcohol in carbon tetrachloride using FTIR method. Vanderheyden and Zeegers-Huyskens [10] studied methyl acetate with substituted phenols in carbon tetrachloride using infrared techniques and reports that, the formation constant values vary with the substitution of phenols. Bellamy and Pace [11] have studied the hydrogen bonding between benzyl alcohol and phenols with dimethyl acetamide by employing IR spectroscopic method. Our research group has investigated the complex formation of aliphatic alcohols with acrylic esters in non-polar solvents using FTIR spectroscopic method [12–14]. Molecular interaction studies involving substituted benzyl alcohols with butyl methacrylate are scarce in literature. Keeping in view, the present work is an attempt to study the interaction between various substituted benzyl alcohols (o-aminobenzyl alcohol, o-methylbenzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, o-fluorobenzyl alcohol, o-chlorobenzyl alcohol, o-bromobenzyl alcohol, o-iodobenzyl alcohol and o-nitrobenzyl alcohol) with butyl methacrylate in carbon tetrachloride using FTIR spectroscopic method. This study is expected to provide useful information about the nature of molecular interactions existing between the interactive systems."
1,Experimental section and method,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Butyl methacrylate, benzyl alcohol, o-aminobenzyl alcohol, o-methylbenzyl alcohol, o-fluorobenzyl alcohol, o-chlorobenzyl alcohol, o-bromobenzyl alcohol, o-iodobenzyl alcohol and o-nitrobenzyl alcohol with purity >99% (spectroscopic grade) were used in this investigation. They were purchased from Aldrich and used without any further purification. AR grade carbon tetrachloride was purified by standard method [15] and redistilled before use. The physical parameters of all the chemicals used in this study were checked against their literature values."
3,FTIR measurements,"2.2 FTIR measurements A Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR spectrometer with a resolution of ±1cm−1 was used. Spectra were recorded at room temperature (298K) in the region of 4000 to 400cm−1 and NaCl cell of path length 0.1mm was used. The spectrometer possesses auto align energy optimization and dynamically aligned interferometer. It is fitted with a KBr beam splitter, a DTGS-Detector and Everlgo™ mid-IR source. A baseline correction was made for the spectra recorded."
4,Results and discussion,"The spectral data of substituted benzyl alcohols in carbon tetrachloride are provided in Table 1 . Substituted benzyl alcohols in carbon tetrachloride exhibit two hydroxyl bands in the region of 3700–3300cm−1. A sharp peak near 3600cm−1 is ascribed to the free OH stretching vibration and the broad band appears in around 3400cm−1 is due to the absorption of hydrogen bonded species of substituted benzyl alcohols. The wave number difference between the monomeric OH (νfree) and the bonded OH (ν bond) band is ΔνOH (i.e., ∆ν=νfree −νbonded) which is shown in Table 1. It is observed that, free hydroxyl band, bonded hydroxyl band and ΔνOH values vary with the substituent of benzyl alcohols. This result is in close agreement with Bellamy and Pace [11], Richards [16], Krueger and Hawkins [8] and Forland et al. [9] during their studies on benzyl alcohol and substituted benzyl alcohols with carbon tetrachloride systems. Butyl methacrylate with carbon tetrachloride exhibit a free carbonyl absorption band at 1719cm−1 as observed in the present study (Table 2 ). Similar free carbonyl absorption value was reported by Nyquist and Streck [17] using butyl methacrylate with carbon tetrachloride. For ternary mixtures, the proton acceptor (butyl methacrylate) concentration is fixed at 0.03mol.l–1, varying the proton donor (substituted benzyl alcohols) concentrations from 0.03 to 0.15 mol.l–1. The free O–H band intensity and half-bandwidth increases with increasing benzyl alcohol concentrations. But, at the same time the reverse trend is noticed for the carbonyl absorption band. This observation indicates that there exists 1:1 complex formation between free hydroxyl group of substituted benzyl alcohols and carbonyl group of butyl methacrylate (i.e., O-H ∙∙∙ O=C) (Fig. 1 ). Similar results of 1:1 complex formation between methacrylates and phenol in carbon tetrachloride system was reported by Khan et al. [18]. The association between an aromatic alcohol molecule (donor A), a butyl methacrylate (acceptor B) and complex AB can be represented by the equilibrium A+B↔AB, if only 1:1 complexes are present. Utilizing Nash [19] method, the equilibrium constant (K) for the 1:1 complex is calculated with the help of the following equation: K = AB / A B where [AB] is the concentration of the 1:1 complex and [A] and [B] are the initial concentration of the proton donor and proton acceptor, respectively. A graph was plotted between Y =[A]−1 and X =(1−(a/a 0))−1. where a and a 0 are the absorbance's of the carbonyl band of butyl methacrylate in the presence and absence of substituted benzyl alcohol. The intercept of the graph in the ordinate yields the value of K. The free energy change (ΔG°) of the systems was calculated using the following relation [20]: Δ G ° = − R T ln K where R, T and K represent the universal gas constant, absolute temperature, and formation constant of the relative systems respectively. The calculated formation constant (K) and free energy change (ΔG°) values for all the systems are given in Table 3 . The formation constant (K) and free energy change (ΔG°) values are observed in the order: o-aminobenzyl alcohol< o-methylbenzyl alcohol<benzyl alcohol< o-fluorobenzyl alcohol< o-chlorobenzyl alcohol< o-bromobenzyl alcohol< o-iodobenzyl alcohol< o-nitrobenzyl alcohol. This change in K and ΔG° values indicates that the proton donating ability of proton donor varies with the substituted benzyl alcohols. Further, the formation constant (K) and free energy change (ΔG°) value decreases for electron donating groups (i.e., NH2 and CH3) and increases for electron withdrawing groups (i.e., F, Cl, Br, I and NO2) when compared with benzyl alcohol. This is because, the electron donating substituents facilitate the bond breaking process, whereas the electron withdrawing groups facilitate the bond making process. This is well reflected with a lower formation constant and free energy change values for electron donating groups and higher formation constant and free energy change values for electron withdrawing groups with the same acceptor (butyl methacrylate). Similar observation of free energy change was carried out by Ozgun and Degirmenbasi [21] in substituted benzyl alcohols. The formation constant (K) and free energy change (ΔG°) value increases with increasing acidity of substituted benzyl alcohols [22]. This trend indicates that, the proton donating ability is positively correlated with the acidity of benzyl alcohols. Therefore, the strong hydrogen bond would be expected to form between o-nitrobenzyl alcohol with butyl methacrylate in carbon tetrachloride and weakest hydrogen bond between o-aminobenzyl alcohol with butyl methacrylate in carbon tetrachloride as reflected by the higher formation constant and free energy change in the system. The K and ΔG° values for o-nitrobenzyl alcohol with butyl methacrylate are found to be greater than that for all other substituted benzyl alcohols, which reveals that, the tendency of complex formation of o-nitrobenzyl alcohol is relatively larger than other substituted benzyl alcohols. This result is in close agreement with Thus and Zeegers-Huyskens [23] in phenones with substituted phenols."
5,Conclusion,"The complex formation between substituted benzyl alcohols with butyl methacrylate in carbon tetrachloride has been carried out using FTIR spectroscopic method at 298K. From this study, it may be concluded that the degree of complexation varies with the substituent of benzyl alcohols."
