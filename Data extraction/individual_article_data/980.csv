0,Introduction,"Banana is cultivated in tropical and subtropical countries. In addition to a cash crop, banana fruit is also a major food crop to provide 30–60 % of the daily calorie intake in some East African countries (Tripathi, Ntui, & Tripathi, 2020). As a typical climacteric fruit, banana fruit need to undergo a ripening process from harvest to consumption. During fruit ripening of banana, the biochemistry, physiology and structure change markedly to influence appearance, texture, flavor and aroma, such as the chlorophyll breakdown, degradation of cell walls and starch degradation (Giovannoni, 2004; Li et al., 2019a). Thus, the ripening affects greatly the quality of banana fruit, including color, hardness, flavor, astringency and shelf life (Hu et al., 2017). During postharvest ripening of banana fruit, ethylene production often bursts following the jump of respiratory rate (Gamrasni et al., 2020). Ethylene plays a key regulatory role in the ripening initiation of various climacteric fruits. Exogenous ethylene treatment significantly accelerated the ripening of various climacteric fruits, while the treatment with exogenous 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) as a competitive inhibitor of ethylene receptor significantly delayed the ripening of various climacteric fruits (Gamrasni et al., 2020; Pongprasert, Srilaong, & Sugaya, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, other potential regulators have been investigated to prolong the shelf life of banana fruit. Exogenous melatonin treatment delayed also fruit ripening of four banana cultivars by repressing the expressions of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (MaACO) and 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylic acid synthase (MaACS) (Hu et al., 2017). The monooxygenase combined with sodium alginate treatment extended the shelf life of banana fruit for 3–4 days by reducing ethylene production (Zhou et al., 2020). However, due to the high cost, complex procedures, food safety and treatment effect, there is increasing need to develop simple postharvest treatment directly applied to the commercial production of banana fruit. Hydrogen water can be produced by water electrolysis, which has the advantages of low cost, non-toxicity and simple treated procedure (Carmo, Fritz, Merge, & Stolten, 2013,). As a novel medical treatment, hydrogen has been extensively investigated in the medical field in the last ten years (Qian et al., 2019; Sano & Tamura, 2021). In addition to the direct reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen molecules induced tissues to enhance the ability of stress response (Iida et al., 2016). Hydrogen gas can inhibit autophagy also by activating PI3 K/Akt/GSK3 β-signal pathway, thereby improving the cell viability of microvascular endothelial cell (Wang et al., 2020). It has been also reported that exogenous HW treatment significantly delayed pericarp browning of litchi fruit by improving the ability of the antioxidant system (Yun et al., 2021a). However, little information on the roles of HW in delaying postharvest ripening of banana fruit has been available. This study investigated the effects of exogenous HW treatment on the fruit ripening of postharvest banana, mainly including ethylene-related characteristics (ethylene production, respiratory rate, and expressions of MaACO1, MaACO2, MaACO3, MaACS, MaERF21, MaERF105 and MaAP2/ERF), fruit color-related characteristics (color values of a*, b*, C* and L*, and expressions of MaCab7 and MaCab8), fruit flavor-related characteristics (TSS, total starch, amylose, amylopectin, starch granule, MaAMY1, MaAMY2, MaBMY1, MaBMY2, MaFK and MaHXK) and fruit softening-related characteristics (firmness, cell wall structure, WSP, CSP, ASP, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, MaGT12, MaXTH32, MaPE3, MaPE53 and MaLAP). It was hypothesized that HW treatment not only affects postharvest ripening characteristic of banana fruit via its own reducibility, but also may have an effect on ethylene synthesis and ethylene-effect to directly regulate the fruit ripening traits. This study provides a new strategy for delaying postharvest ripening of banana fruit during storage."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Plant materials and treatments,"2.1 Plant materials and treatments Banana (Musa spp. AAA cv. Baxijiao) fruit without pre-treatment were picked in 2020 at commercial maturity (85 d after flower bud drooping) from a commercial farm in Guangzhou City, Guangdong province of China and immediately transported to a postharvest laboratory at South China Botanical Garden within 1 h drive. The fruit fingers with uniform shape, color and size were selected for subsequent experiments. Fruit fingers were divided into two groups (25 kg each) and respectively soaked in ultrapure water (control) or hydrogen water (0.8 ppm) at 25 ± 1 °C for 10 min. This hydrogen water concentration was determined to be the optimum based on preliminary experiments using 0, 0.5, 0.8 and 1 ppm hydrogen water. After for 2 h air drying, 4 fruit fingers were packed into one polyethylene bag (0.03 mm, micro-perforated) for each treatment and stored in a room at 25 °C and 85–90% relative humidity. At day 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 24 and 26, fruit were taken sampled randomly from three bags for each biological replicate, and then peel and pulp were sampled, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for further analysis, respectively."
3,Determination of peel color of banana fruit,"2.2 Determination of peel color of banana fruit Peel color was measured using a Chroma Meter (Minolta CR 400, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan) according to a well-established method in our lab (Yun et al., 2019; Yun et al., 2021a). The color values of a*, b*, C* and L* were recorded according to the CIE system. L* values represent the lightness. Positive a* values indicate red and negative a* values indicate a green color. Positive b* values indicate yellow and negative b* values indicate blue color. C* values represent the degree of color saturation. Only the back of middle peel of banana finger was used for color measurement."
4,Determination of respiratory rate and ethylene production rate,"2.3 Determination of respiratory rate and ethylene production rate Respiratory rate was determined by using the infrared gas analyzer (Li-6262 CO2/H2O analyzer, LI-COR, Inc, USA) according to a well-established method in our lab (Yun et al., 2019; Yun et al., 2021a). Six fruit fingers of each replicate were weighted and placed in a 4 L airtight container. The change of CO2 concentration was determined and the respiratory rate was expressed as CO2 (mg kg−1 s−1) on fresh weight (FW) basis. Ethylene production of banana fruit was determined by using a Portable Ethylene Analyzer (F-900, Felix instruments, Camas, WA, USA). Six banana fingers were enclosed into an airtight container (4 L) for 2 h at 25 °C to collect ethylene. The ethylene production was recorded by a microcomputer. Ethylene production rate was expressed as μg kg−1 s−1 (fresh weight)."
5,Determinations of TSS and firmness,"2.4 Determinations of TSS and firmness TSS was determined by using a hand-held digital refractometer (Model PAL-BX|ACID F5, Atago, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The banana pulp was broken by juicer, then squeezed and filtered with 100 mesh nylon cloth. The obtained liquid phase was used for TSS determination. TSS was expressed as Brix (%). Fruit firmness was measured with a penetrometer GY-3 (Hangzhou Scientific Instruments, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China). Only the back of middle part of banana finger was used for firmness measurement and the firmness was expressed as g cm−1."
6,Observations of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy,"2.5 Observations of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed according to a well-established method (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2021). Briefly, fresh peel/pulp samples were soaked in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h, washed with 0.1 M phosphate twice, fixed in 1 % osmic acid for 4 h, and dehydrated for 10 min in a gradient ethanol (30, 50, 70, 80, 90 and 100 %; v/v), respectively. After the above steps, pulp sample was examined by JSM-6360 LV SEM (JEOL, Japan) at 15 kV while peel sample was examined using a JEM-1010 TEM (JEOL, Japan) at 100 kV."
7,Determination of starch contents,"2.6 Determination of starch contents The total starch content of banana pulp was determined using a reported method as described by Lin et al. (2019). Briefly, two grams of pulp powder was mixed in 20 mL of 70 % alcohol for total starch extraction. The mixture was bathed at 80 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 g at 25 °C for 5 min. The precipitation was suspended in 10 mL ultrapure water and bathed at 95 °C for 15 min. After cooling, the mixture was added to 7 mL of 12 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) and shaken for 15 min. A 50-μL supernatant was added to 250 µL anthranone and then bathed at 95 °C for 10 min. The absorbance was measured at 620 nm. Total starch content was calculated by preparing a standard curve using the absorbance value of glucose at 620 nm and then expressed as g kg−1 on fresh weight basis. The contents of amylose and amylopectin were determined using a reported method as described by Gao et al., (2016). Briefly, 5 g pulp powder was suspended in 30 mL of 250 mg L-1 pectinase solution. After a shaking water bath at 45 °C for 2 h, the mixture was filtrated, then the obtained residue was washed three times with ultrapure water, and finally the filtrate and cleaning solution were collected, precipitated and dried. The contents of amylose and amylopectin were determined by using an Amylose/Amylopectin Assay Kit (K-AMYL, Megazyme, Bray Business Park, Bray, Wicklow, Ireland) and then expressed as g kg−1 on fresh weight basis."
8,Determination of cell wall components,"2.7 Determination of cell wall components Cell wall components of banana peel were determined using a known methods (Basanta, Pla, Stortz, & Rojas, 2013) with minor modification. Briefly, 30 g of peel powder was suspended in 200 mL of 95 % ethanol and then bathed in boiling water for 45 min. After centrifugation, the precipitate was successively washed with 100 mL of 95 % ethanol, methanol chloroform solution (1:1, v/v) and acetone, and then dried to obtain an alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR). A 250-mg AIR was successively extracted with 40 mL of pure water at 100 °C for 5 min, 40 mL of 0.05 mM CDTA dissolved in sodium acetate at 25 °C for 6 h, 15 mL of 50 mM Na2CO3 solution (containing 20 mM NaBH4) at 25 °C for 12 h, and 15 mL of 1 M KOH at 25 °C for 2 h, the obtained supernatants were water-soluble pectin (WSP), CDTA-soluble pectin (CSP), sodium carbonate-soluble pectin (ASP) and hemicellulose, respectively, while the final residue was a mixture of cellulose and lignin. The final residue was suspended in 1 M H2SO4 solution and heated at 100 °C for 2 h to obtain lignin. The contents of WSP, CSP and ASP were determined by using Carbazole method and expressed as g kg−1 on fresh weight basis. The contents of hemicellulose, final residue and lignin were determined by using the Anthrone method and then expressed as g kg−1 on fresh weight basis. The cellulose content was calculated by subtracting lignin content from the final residue content."
9,RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis,"2.8 RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis Total RNA of banana pulp or peel was extracted using a reported method as described by Gao et al. (2016). Briefly, 6 g peel powder was suspended in extraction buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2.5% CTAB, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 1.4 M NaCl and 0.02 M EDTA, before 0.3 mL of 8 M LiCl was added to precipitate RNA. The integrity and concentration of total RNA were examined by gel electrophoresis and a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). Genes associated with banana ripening were selected on the basis of the reported transcriptome data (Yun et al., 2019). The gene sequence was downloaded from the Banana Genome Hub (http://banana-genome-hub.southgreen.fr/). The primers were designed by Primer Premier Software 5.0 (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, USA). One microgram total RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using a PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Dalian, China). qRT–PCR was performed on an ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) according to a well-established method in our lab (Gao et al., 2016). Pulp cDNA was used as a template for fruit flavor-related genes, while peel cDNA was used as a template for other genes. MaActin (Ma09_t08490) was used as the reference gene to normalize the content of cDNA. The comparative CT method (2−ΔΔCT method) was used to analyze the expression levels of different genes (Livak & Schmittgen, 2001)."
10,Data analysis,"2.9 Data analysis The determinations of all fruit ripening-related characteristics were conducted in four biological replicates. The data presented in this study were the mean values of four biological replicates. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, SPSS Version 16.0) was used to determine the significance of the difference, and Duncan's test was used to test the significance of the difference (P < 0.01). The line chart was drawn using the Sigmaplot software (Version 12.0; Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA). The heatmap was prepared using TBtools (Chen et al., 2020). The data of all characteristics was also analyzed for orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) by using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/home.xhtml)."
11,Results,
12,Effect of hydrogen water treatment on peel color of banana fruit during ripening,"3.1 Effect of hydrogen water treatment on peel color of banana fruit during ripening Skin color is one of the criterion that reflects the ripeness of banana fruit. The control fruit turned completely yellow at Day 26 of storage (Fig. 1 A), while the HW-treated fruit was in light green at Day 26 (Fig. 1B) and turned completely yellow at Day 32 of storage, indicating that HW treatment delayed banana ripening by about six days. To further quantify the changes in color, peel was measured using chromaticity L*, a*, b* and C* system. For control fruit, the chromaticity a*, b* and L* values began to increase after 19 days of storage, and then reached a peak at Day 24 or 26 (Fig. 1C). By contrast, the chromaticity a*, b* and L* values of the HW-treated fruit remained at a low level without a sharp increase during the 26 days storage (Fig. 1C). The chromaticity C* values of both control and HW-treated fruit fluctuated during storage and there was no obvious difference (Fig. 1C). The results indicated also that the control fruit began to fade green and turn yellow after 19 days of storage and the HW treatment could effectively delay this trend."
13,"Effect of hydrogen water treatment on respiratory rate, ethylene production rate, firmness and TSS of banana fruit during storage","3.2 Effect of hydrogen water treatment on respiratory rate, ethylene production rate, firmness and TSS of banana fruit during storage In order to further reflect the state of fruit ripening, respiratory rate, ethylene production rate, firmness and TSS were measured in this study. The respiratory rate of control fruit increased significantly (P < 0.001) and sharply at Day 22 of storage and then remained at a high level, while the respiratory rate of the HW-treated fruit only increased significantly at Day 26 (Fig. 1D). Similarly, the ethylene production rate of control fruit changed slightly at the early stage of storage and then increased gradually from Day 19 to 26, while the ethylene production rate of the HW-treated fruit remained at a low level (similar to the level at Day 1). The firmness of control fruit changed slightly at the early stage of storage and decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from Day 19 to 26, while the firmness of the HW-treated fruit changed slightly in a storage period of 26 days (Fig. 1D). On the contrary, the TSS content of the control fruit changed slightly at the early of storage and then increased gradually from Day 19 to 26, while the TSS content of the HW-treated fruit remained at a low level and increased only at Day 26 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the ripening of the control fruit started after 19 days of storage. During the ripening, fruit color changed from green to yellow, the respiration rate increased, the ethylene production rate increased, the fruit hardness decreased and the TSS increased. HW treatment delayed the fruit ripening, the increase of chromaticity a*, b*, L*, respiratory rate, ethylene production rate and TSS, and the decrease of firmness. It can be seen that the ripening of control and HW-treated fruit mainly began differentiation after 19 days of storage, so the subsequent analysis mainly focused on samples of Day 1, 19, 22, 24 and 26."
14,Effect of hydrogen water treatment on starch granules and cell walls of banana fruit during storage,"3.3 Effect of hydrogen water treatment on starch granules and cell walls of banana fruit during storage During storage, the similar starch granules of banana pulp was observed until Day 19 of storage, then the volume and number of starch granules gradually decreased, and finally there was no obvious starch granules in the cell lumen at Day 26 (Fig. 2 ). After HW treatment, the volume and number of starch granules in banana pulp changed slightly until Day 26 of storage. The results indicated that the HW treatment significantly delayed the degradation of starch granules of banana pulp during postharvest storage. For the control banana peel, the cell walls remained intact until Day 19 of storage, but there was significant gap in the middle of the cell walls at Day 22, with only narrow margin at Day 26 (Fig. 2). After the HW treatment, the cell walls of banana peel remained intact until Day 26 of storage, and no clear gap appeared in the cell walls during 26 days storage. Those results exhibited that the HW treatment significantly delayed the degradation cell walls of banana peel during fruit storage."
15,"Effect of hydrogen water treatment on total starch, amylose and amylopectin of pulp during banana storage","3.4 Effect of hydrogen water treatment on total starch, amylose and amylopectin of pulp during banana storage In order to understand the effect of the HW treatment on the delayed degradation of starch, the contents of total starch, amylose and amylopectin in banana pulp were analyzed in this study. The total starch content of the control pulp sharply decreased after 19 days of storage and then reached the lowest level on Day 26 (Fig. 3 A). After the HW treatment, the total starch content changed slightly at the early stage of storage, but was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than that of control pulp at Days 22, 24 and 26. After 19 days of storage, the amylose content of control pulp also began to decline sharply and reached the lowest level on Day 26, while the amylose content of the HW-treated pulp changed slightly during 26 days of storage (Fig. 3A). Similarly, compared with the control pulp, the amylopectin content of the HW-treated pulp showed no significant changes at the early stage of storage, but was significantly (P < 0.001) higher at Days 22, 24 and 26 (Fig. 3A). Those results indicated that the HW treatment significantly delayed the degradation of various starches in banana pulp. In addition, the degradation rate of total starch, amylose and amylopectin in the control pulp during fruit ripening were close to each other (about 83 %)."
16,Effect of hydrogen water treatment on cell wall components of peel during banana storage,"3.5 Effect of hydrogen water treatment on cell wall components of peel during banana storage In order to quantify the effect of the HW treatment on the degradation of cell walls, the contents of water soluble pectin (WSP), CDTA-soluble pectin (CSP), sodium carbonate-soluble pectin (ASP), cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in banana peel were measured in this study. During storage, the contents of WSP, CSP and ASP of the control peel showed the same trend, with a slight change within the first 19 days of storage and then a sharp decline with the lowest level at Day 26 (Fig. 3B). During fruit ripening, the degradation rate of ASP in the control peel was the highest (95%), followed by CSP (74%) and WSP (45%). After the HW treatment, the contents of WSP, CSP and ASP of banana peel were the same as at Day 1 during storage, but only the CSP content decreased at Day 26 (Fig. 3B). The cellulose content of the control peel changed slightly within the first 22 days of storage and then increased at Day 24, but decreased at Day 26 (Fig. 3C). After the HW treatment, the cellulose content remained at the same level during the 26 days storage. In consistence with the trend of starch and pectin, the contents of hemicellulose and lignin of the control peel changed slightly within the first 19 days of storage, then sharply decreased, and finally reached the lowest level on Day 26 (Fig. 3C). After the HW treatment, the contents of hemicellulose and lignin remained at the same level during the 26 days storage, and were significantly (P < 0.001) higher than those in the control peel at Days 24 and 26. Those results indicated that the HW treatment significantly delayed the degradations of hemicellulose, lignin and various pectins in banana peel."
17,Effect of HW treatment on gene expressions of banana fruit during storage,"3.6 Effect of HW treatment on gene expressions of banana fruit during storage In this study, a total of 20 genes were quantitatively analyzed to evaluate the effect of the HW treatment on the gene expressions of banana fruit, including seven ethylene-related genes, five cell wall-related genes, six flavor-related genes and two degreening-related genes (Fig. 4 ). As shown in Fig. 4, the HW treatment significantly inhibited the expressions of ethylene-related genes at from Day 22 to 26 of storage. The ethylene-related genes included four ethylene synthesis-related genes (MaACO1, MaACO2, MaACO3 and MaACS) and three ethylene signaling-related genes (MaAP2/ERF, MaERF21 and MaERF105). These results explained that the HW treatment not only delayed ethylene synthesis, but also inhibited ethylene signal transduction in banana fruit. The HW treatment significantly inhibited the expressions of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein 32 (MaXTH32) and pectinesterase 53 (MaPE53) at from Day 22 to 26 of storage and significantly down-regulated the expression of xyloglucan glycosyltransferase 12 (MaGT12) and MaPE3 at from Day 24 to 26 of storage (Fig. 4). In addition, the expression of lignin-forming anionic peroxidase (MaLAP) was significantly down-regulated in the control peel at from Day 22 to 26 of storage compared with Day 1 while the expression of MaLAP in the HW-treated peel maintained at same level during 26 days storage (Fig. 4). In similarity to MaLAP, the HW treatment significantly inhibited the down-regulated expressions of chlorophyll a-b binding protein 7 (MaCab7) and MaCab8 at from Day 22 to 26 of storage. Those results indicated that the HW treatment significantly inhibited the up-regulation of these genes related to cell wall degradation, as well as the down-regulation of these genes related to lignin synthesis and peel color during fruit ripening. It was noted also that the HW treatment significantly inhibited the expression of β-amylase 1 (MaBMY1) at from Day 22 to 24 of storage and the expressions of MaBMY2, α-amylase 2 (MaAMY2), fructokinase (MaFK) and hexokinase (MaHXK) at from Day 22 to 26 of storage, and significantly down-regulated the expression of MaAMY1 at Day 26 (Fig. 4). Those results showed that the HW treatment significantly inhibited the up-regulation of these genes related starch degradation and sugar metabolism during banana fruit ripening."
18,The clustering of ripening-related characteristics of banana fruit during storage,"3.7 The clustering of ripening-related characteristics of banana fruit during storage To visualize the general clustering trends, OPLS-DA were applied to analyze the 37 banana ripening-related characteristics obtained from five stages of the control and HW-treated fruit. The permutation result showed that p value of Q2 was<0.001 while p value of R2Y was equal to 0.012 (Fig. S1), indicating that the OPLS-DA model was valid. Fig. 5 presents a good reproducibility of each sample. The samples of control group at Days 22, 24 and 26 were clearly separated from the other samples of the control group and all samples of the HW group according to Scores plot (Fig. 5). The result of hierarchical clustering dendrogram showed that the HW-treated samples at Days 1, 19 and 22 were clustered into a group with the control samples at Day 1, the HW-treated samples at Days 22, 24 and 26 were clustered into a group with the control samples at Day 19, whereas the control samples at Days 22, 24 and 26 were clustered into separate groups (Fig. S2). Those results indicated that the effect of the HW treatment on banana fruit ripening was mainly reflected on Days 22, 24 and 26, with a small effect at the early stage of storage. Particularly, MaACS, ethylene production rate and MaXTH32 were significantly separated according to p[1] of Feature importance while other ripening-related characteristics were mainly separated according to p(corr)[1] of Feature importance (Fig. S3)."
19,Coordinated changes of ripening-related characteristics of banana fruit during storage,"3.8 Coordinated changes of ripening-related characteristics of banana fruit during storage In order to establish a link between two of these banana ripening-related characteristics, the correlation analysis was performed to identify each ripening-related character that was functionally related or co-regulated with other ripening-related characteristics in banana fruit after the HW treatment. The correlation coefficients were calculated by using a statistical analysis of MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (www.metaboanalyst.ca/). All 37 ripening-related characteristics were mainly clustered into three groups (Fig. 6 ). Cluster 1 consisted of 12 ripening-related characteristics, including total starch, amylose, amylopectin, firmness, WSP, ASP, CSP, hemicellulose, lignin, MaLAP, MaCab7 and MaCab8 (Fig. 6). These ripening-related characteristics showed a consistent trend, with slight change within the first 19 days of storage and then a sharp decrease in the control fruit. However, the HW treatment significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the sharp decrease. These ripening-related characteristics were mainly involved in starch degradation, fruit softening and fruit degreening. Cluster 2 consisted of 20 ripening-related characteristics, including ethylene production rate, MaACO1, MaACO2, MaACO3, MaACS, MaERF21, MaERF105, MaAP2/ERF, a*, b*, L*, respiratory rate, TSS, MaAMY2, MaBMY1, MaBMY2, MaGT12, MaXTH32, MaPE53 and MaPE3 (Fig. 6). These ripening-related characteristics showed also a consistent trend, with slight change within the first 19 days of storage and then a sharp increase in the control fruit. All twenty ripening-related characteristics of Cluster 2 were negatively correlated with those in Cluster 1, and they showed little changes after the HW treatment. The ripening-related characteristics in Cluster 2 were mainly involved in ethylene synthesis, color, flavor, and these genes related to ethylene signaling and degradations of starch and cell walls. In Cluster 3, all five ripening-related characteristics were weakly correlated positively with most of the ripening-related characteristics in Cluster 1 and most of the ripening-related characteristics in Cluster 2. Cluster 3 contained cellulose, C*, MaAMY1, MaFK and MaHXK (Fig. 6). Some characteristics of Cluster 3 in the control fruit fluctuated throughout the storage while others significantly increased only at Day 26. After the HW treatment, the change-fold of these characteristics in Cluster 3 was smaller than those of Clusters 1 and 2, indicating that these characteristics in Cluster 3 played a weaker role in HW treatment delaying banana ripening than those of Clusters 1 and 2."
20,Discussion,
21,HW treatment delayed ethylene synthesis and signaling of banana fruit during storage,"4.1 HW treatment delayed ethylene synthesis and signaling of banana fruit during storage Banana is a typical respiratory climacteric fruit and its ripening is completely controlled by ethylene (Yun et al., 2019; Yun et al., 2021b). The treatment of ethylene microbubbles significantly accelerated the ripening of banana fruit (Pongprasert, Srilaong, & Sugaya, 2020). MaACO and MaACS are key genes for ethylene synthesis in banana fruit (Jourda et al., 2014), CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of MaACO1 significantly reduced the ethylene production rate and delayed the ripening of banana fruit (Hu et al., 2021). MaERFs are key genes in ethylene signaling in banana fruit (Jourda et al., 2014), ethylene treatment significantly induced the up-regulation of several MaERFs, which accelerated the ripening of banana fruit (Kuang et al., 2021). In this study, the HW treatment significantly inhibited the expressions of ethylene synthesis-related genes (MaACO1, MaACO2, MaACO3 and MaACS), leading to no significant increase in ethylene production rate, and significantly blocked ethylene signal (MaAP2/ERF, MaERF21 and MaERF105) in the HW-treated fruit (Fig. 1D and Fig. 6), thus delaying banana fruit ripening. The peaks of respiratory rate and ethylene production rate of the control fruit appeared at Day 20 or 21 while those of the HW-treated fruit were delayed after 26 days of storage, which indicated that HW treatment delayed banana fruit ripening by delaying ethylene synthesis and signal transduction."
22,HW treatment delayed skin degreening of banana during storage,"4.2 HW treatment delayed skin degreening of banana during storage Degreening is a physiological process associated with ripening or senescence of various fruits after harvest (Dasgupta, George, Bhatia, & Sidhu, 2014; Song et al., 2015). Color is a key reference index for consumers to judge fruit ripeness. The color of banana fruit gradually changes from green to yellow during ripening (Yun et al., 2019). Cabs are a group of abundant membrane proteins, and can bind with chlorophylls to form a complex that exhibits green color of apple leaves (Zhao et al., 2020). During the ripening of banana and mango fruits, the expressions of Cabs were significantly reduced (Deshpande et al., 2017; Yun et al., 2019). In this study, the HW treatment significantly inhibited the down-regulation of both MaCab7 and MaCab8, retained more chlorophyll-Cab complex, delayed the degradation of chlorophyll, thus, resulted in lower values of chromaticity a*, b* and L*, as compared with the control fruit (Fig. 1C and Fig. 4)."
23,HW treatment delayed the degradation of starch and the formation of flavor in pulp of banana during storage,"4.3 HW treatment delayed the degradation of starch and the formation of flavor in pulp of banana during storage Starch was the main substance accumulated in banana pulp during development, and its content was as high as 80 % (dry weight) at harvest time (Gao et al., 2016). During banana fruit ripening, starch gradually degraded into soluble sugar, and the banana pulp gradually became sweet and soft (Lin et al., 2019). Starch granule erosion and disassembling are key events that lead bananas to reach their optimal postharvest quality (Cordenunsi-Lysenko et al., 2019). Recent studies have shown that ethylene-mediated regulation of starch-degrading enzymes at transcriptional and translational levels is crucial for sugar metabolism in banana ripening. The AMY in the banana fruit appears to act before BMY at the onset of starch breakdown, but the latter is essential for the complete breakdown and its upregulation is clearly correlated to a decrease in starch during fruit ripening (Gao et al., 2016; Cordenunsi-Lysenko et al., 2019). In this study, the HW treatment significantly inhibited the up-regulation of MaAMY2, MaBMY1 and MaBMY2 (Fig. 4), thus delaying the degradation of starch and maintaining the complete morphology of starch granules in banana pulp (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3A). HXK and FK as the only two types of glucose- and fructose-phosphorylating enzymes are the gateway for most of organic metabolism in plants (Granot, Kelly, Stein, & David-Schwartz, 2014). In this study, the up-regulation of MaFK and MaHXK was significantly inhibited also by the HW treatment (Fig. 4), suggesting a low level of TSS in the HW-treated pulp during storage (Fig. 1D)."
24,HW treatment delayed the degradation of cell wall components and softening of banana during ripening,"4.4 HW treatment delayed the degradation of cell wall components and softening of banana during ripening Fruit softening is a major determinant of shelf life and commercial value. There are many factors that cause fruit softening, such as membrane degradation, starch degradation and cell wall component degradation (Wang et al., 2018). Although the relative contribution of each event to fruit ripening is unclear, the degradation of cell wall components is considered to be the most important (Goulao & Oliveira, 2008). The inhibition of the expressions of PE, XTH and other cell wall degradation-related genes can significantly delay fruit softening (Goulao & Oliveira, 2008; Wang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019b). In this study, the expression of MaXTH32, MaPE53, MaGT12 and MaPE3 were significantly inhibited by the HW treatment (Fig. 4), resulting that the higher contents of WSP, CSP, ASP and hemicellulose in the HW-treated peel compared with the control peel at the later stage of storage (Fig. 3). In addition, the induced expression of lignin-forming anionic peroxidase (LAP) promoted lignin synthesis in plants (Dasgupta et al., 2014). In this study, the expression of MaLAP was maintained in the HW-treated peel, while the expression of MaLAP in the control peel was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 4), resulting in a higher lignin content in the former than in the latter at the later stage of storage (Fig. 3C). In short, HW treatment may maintain the integrity of cell wall and delay banana fruit softening by inhibiting the up-regulation of cell wall degradation-related genes and the down-regulation of cell wall synthesis-related genes."
25,Conclusions,"In summary, this is the first report about the role of hydrogen water in delaying the ripening of banana fruit. In a storage period of 26 days, the HW treatment significantly reduced ethylene production and repressed ethylene signaling in banana fruit, which in turn delayed significantly the fruit ripening as manifested by impeding the color change from green to yellow, the fruit softening and the formation of flavor. Compared with control fruit, HW-treated fruit exhibited higher values of firmness, total starch, amylose, amylopectin, WSP, CSP, ASP, hemicellulose, lignin and the expression of MaCabs, and lower values of Chromaticity a*, b*, L*, respiratory rate, ethylene production rate, TSS and the expressions of genes related ethylene synthesis, signaling, cell wall degradation and starch degradation. It is noted that the HW treatment has the advantages of safety, non-toxic, low cost and simple treatment procedure (Yun et al., 2021a), which can be used to extend the shelf life of various fruits. Further research can be carried out focusing on those quality characteristics. Firstly, focusing on different cultivars and application methods to ensure the maximum effects of the HW treatment on banana fruit. Secondary, an emphasis on sensory qualities to further analyze the overall impact of HW treatment on banana fruit. Thirdly, focusing on the flavor- and nutrients-related metabolites to further explore the detailed effects of HW treatment on banana fruit. Meanwhile, the role of hydrogen as signal molecule in delaying banana ripening via the mediation of ethylene effects requires to be elucidated further."
