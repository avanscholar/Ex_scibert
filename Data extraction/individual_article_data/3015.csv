0,Introduction,"Aviation fuel, one of the most demanding transport fuels, mainly including linear alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons in the range of C9∼C16, is mainly derived from petroleum today (Liu et al., 2013). In the global aviation industry, it consumes approximately 472–535 billion gallons of aviation fuel annually (Shi et al., 2019). As non-renewable resources like petroleum are decreasing worldwide, consumption of aviation fuel mainly derived from petroleum continues to increase (Cai et al., 2016). The contradiction between supply and demand is becoming increasingly prominent (Benito et al., 2019). It is great meaningful to exploit advanced techniques to produce aviation fuel based on renewable resources like waste biomass (Atsonios et al., 2015). The bio-fuel produced from catalytic conversion of biomass has attracted great attentions (Chowdari et al., 2019). A novel method was proposed and developed lately, which could produce alkanes in the range of C9∼C16 from biomass (Sheng et al., 2015). Namely, intermediates of aviation fuel was formed by aldol condensation, then the alkanes in the range of aviation fuel were generated by dehydration/hydrogenation (Faba et al., 2012). Aldol condensation is a vital C–C coupling process to realize carbon-chain growing (Sacia et al., 2015). In the aldol condensation, two molecules of aldehyde (ketone) can interact with each other. α-hydrogen of one aldehyde (ketone) molecule is added to the carbonyl atom of the other aldehyde (ketone) molecule, and the rest is added to the carbonyl carbon atom to form a molecule of β-Glyoxal. Thus, α-hydrogen and carbonyl group are two essential elements for the aldol condensation. In the above mentioned method, furfural from hydrolysis and hydration of cellulosic biomass and acetone from extra supply were popularly used for cross condensation to produce intermediate of aviation fuel (Dedsuksophon et al., 2011). In this study, ketones were proposed for self-condensation with the essential α-hydrogen and carbonyl group to expand the source of reagent, which can be formed by both catalytic pyrolysis and hydrolysis/hydrogenation of cellulose. The aldol condensation and the hydroprocessing are the vital process to product aviation fuel (Li et al., 2019). Some research have been accomplished on the aldol condensation and hydrotreating to produce aviation fuel by a two-reactor method, in which two processes happened in each reactor with atmospheric pressure and high pressure (Shao et al., 2019). Recent work on the integrated reaction mainly focused on the cross condensation. Barrett developed the single-reactor, aqueous phase aldol-condensation and hydrogenation of carbohydrate-derived compounds, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), leading to large water-soluble intermediates that can be converted to liquid alkanes (Barrett et al., 2006). Dedsuksophon et al. reported that aldol-condensation/hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural to produce water-soluble C5–C15 compounds was developed in a single reactor system, and the highest C5–C15 yields were 14.8–20.3% (Dedsuksophon et al., 2011). It is easy to find that the integration of aldol-condensation and hydrotreating is practical. In this study, direct synthesis of C10 and C15 alkanes by integrating self-condensation of biomass-derived cyclopentanone followed by hydrogenation is meaningful, simplifying the steps of manipulation, shortening the time of manipulation and decreasing energy consumption. It is of academic and application value to investigate the integrated reaction process. In the integration process, bifunctional catalysts are crucial and necessary, in which the basic sites undertake the condensation function, while the metal active sites are responsible for hydrogenation and deoxygenation. Li et al. reported the integration of self-condensation and hydrogenation of n-butyraldehyde by screening of the condensation and hydrogenation catalysts to prepare bifunctional catalysts Ni/La–Al2O3, some hydrophobic groups were introduced on the surface of γ-Al2O3 to effectively inhibit the hydration of γ-Al2O3 and the deactivation of Ni/La–Al2O3, which is complicated and uneconomical (Li et al., 2019). Liang et al. published a simple impregnation method for synthesis of Ni/Ce–Al2O3 method for synthesis of reaction of n-butanal, and the recovered Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst lost its catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of CO group in the reusability tests (Liang et al., 2015). The main reason for deactivation was that Ni species were covered, and the deactivation may be eliminated by surface modification of γ-Al2O3 with SiO2 or other substances. Considering the extra complicated modification above, the organic solvent should be introduced in the integration reaction in this study so that the metal sites and acid sites can play a synergistic catalytic role. Faba et al. proposed a single-reactor procedure for performing the aldol condensation and hydrodeoxygenation of condensates, the influence of aqueous phase and organic phase were considered on the integration reaction, with the selectivity to n-alkanes above 50% (Faba et al., 2014). With pure ketones as the reactants, choosing a bifunctional catalyst with suitable basic and metal sites is the key to achieve high yield and reusability in the condensation/hydrogenation for long carbon-chain alkanes. The key to prepare highly efficient bifunctional catalyst is to explore a new design strategy for the synthesis of carrier with appropriate pore structure and basicity. In this paper, all the prepared catalysts were characterized by CO2 temperature programmed reduction (CO2-TPD), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), etc. Self-condensation of cyclopentanone and hydrogenation of self-condensates were carried out over various catalysts to determine the favorable catalysts by one-pot method. The bifunctional catalyst was then determined to obtain good pore structure, appropriate basicity and uniform metal loading. The influence of preparation conditions was also considered. The reusability of bifunctional catalyst was investigated in 5 runs of integrated aldol condensation and hydrogenation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Technology Co. Ltd. if not specified. All reagents used were analytical pure. Cyclopentanone were used for the preparation of condensates. MgO, CaO, Al2O3, TiO2 and NaY (Nankai University) in the range 60–100 mesh were used as catalysts for condensation. AlCl3·6H2O, NaOH, MgCl2 and Na2CO3 were supplied for preparation of Mg–Al–O. γ-Al2O3 (50–80 mesh), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were used to prepare Fe/γ-Al2O3, Co/γ-Al2O3, Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/γ-Al2O3. Activated carbon made from coconut shell in Chengde were ground and screened in the range of 50–90 mesh with the specific surface area of 1050–1150 m2/g. In the process of condensation and hydroprocessing, dichloromethane (≥99%) were used as diluent for analysis, and n-decane (≥99%) was used as internal standard."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts Mg–Al–O was synthesized firstly by preparing two aqueous solutions, the first one containing 0.1 mol/L of AlCl3·6H2O and 0.3 mol/L of MgCl2, the second one containing 0.02 mol/L of Na2CO3 and 0.8 mol/L of NaOH. Then two solutions were gradually blended at 60 °C with vigorous stirring (Zhang et al., 2018). The precipitate was washed many times until there is no chloride ions in the solution (AgNO3 test). Mg–Al–O were dried at 105 °C and maintain 2 h. The products were activated at 450 °C for 6 h in air atmosphere (Shao et al., 2018). The solid samples were cooled to room temperature, and grounded into 40–60 mesh size for use (Lee et al., 2016). Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation of γ-Al2O3 in solutions of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O with expected nickel loading. The resulting suspension was mixed at ambient temperature for 9 h and the excess water was evaporated at 80 °C. Then the remaining solids was dried at 100 °C, followed by calcining at 500 °C in air and maintained 3 h. The catalyst was reduced by at 500 °C under 5 vol % H2/N2 flow and maintained for 3 h before use (Wang and Makkee, 2018). Preparation of Fe/γ-Al2O3, Cu/γ-Al2O3 and Co/γ-Al2O3 followed a similar procedure. To prepare Ni/Mg–Al–O catalyst, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was added into the equal volume of Mg–Al–O and was stirred until completely dissolved. The mixture stood for 24 h, and then dried for 2 h. The catalysts were activated by calcination at 500 °C under 5 vol % H2/N2 flow and maintained for 3 h before use. Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC were prepared by impregnating the mixed oxide precursor solution with activated carbon vector (9.218 g). MgCl2 and AlCl3•6H2O were used to prepare the aqueous solution, stirred in NaOH solution (400 mL, pH 10) for 90 min. The materials were washed and dried at 105 °C. The material was calcined in N2 atmosphere. The procedure of Ni loading on Mg–Al–O/AC was the same as that on Mg–Al–O. A schematic diagram of the experimental procedures including the preparation of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC catalyst and integrated aldol condensation was provided in Fig. 1 ."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization Characterization of catalysts for aldol condensation like MgO was carried out by CO2 temperature programmed desorption (AutoChem 2920 instrument, Micromeritics, USA). The sample was re-calcined by heating at 500 °C and maintained for 2 h under a flow of helium (25 mL/min). After cooling under flowing helium, the sample was exposed to CO2 for 30 min, after which physically-absorbed CO2 desorbed using 25 mL/min helium sweeping. Finally, the sample was heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min (Kim et al., 2019). H2 temperature-programmed reduction tests were carried out in order to select the optimal metal for hydrogenation. All samples were preprocessed in a flow of He (20 mL/min) at room temperature and maintained a period of 1 h. Then the sample was heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min with the flow of H2 (5 vol% in He) (González-Castaño et al., 2018). The surface area of bifunctional Mg–Al–O/AC and Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC catalysts were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The samples were outgassed at 200 °C for 6 h before measurement. The specific surface area (P/P0 = 0.05–0.20) was defined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation. The total pore volume was taken as the total uptake at P/P0 = 0.995 (Khojasteh et al., 2019). The fresh catalyst and that used for repeated 3 and 5 times were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The range of scan covered from 5° to 100° at a rate of 4°/min."
5,Direct synthesis of C10 and C15 alkanes from cyclopentanone,"2.4 Direct synthesis of C10 and C15 alkanes from cyclopentanone Before the start of an integration experiment of condensation and hydroprocessing, the mixtures of 2.4 g catalysts, 8 mL cyclopentanone and 1 mL n-decane were added into a 25 mL autoclave reactor with magnetic stirring systems (Xu et al., 2012). The reactor was purged with N2 (≥98.5%) three times with the final system pressure of 3 MPa. The condensation experiment begun when the temperature reached 170 °C. The reactor was cooled when the self-condensation experiment continuing for 9 h. At the second step, the reactor must be ensured of good air tightness and blown with N2 (≥98.5%) and H2 (≥99.99%) three times respectively. When the suitable pressure of H2 reached 3 MPa and the temperature reached 260 °C, the hydroprocessing experiment begun. The hydrogenation experiments continued for 12 h and then the reactor was cooled. The products were withdrawn and diluted with CH2Cl2 (Shi et al., 2019). In the reusability tests, the self-condensation and hydroprocessing procedure was similar to the first step of integrated reaction experiment above. The mixture were separated, and the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C and fed back into the autoclave reactor. Extra 4 mL n-pentane was added in the original mixture in the reusability tests in the organic solvent system."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis Gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) was used to quantitatively analyze the chemical component of the mixture. Before the analysis of product mixtures by GC/MS, the mixtures must be diluted to a concentration of 0.01–1.0 mg/mL with dichloromethane. An Elite-5MS capillary column was used to separate the products. A required quantity of n-decane was added to be an internal standard for quantification. In this paper, conversion, yield and selectivity were determined based on the equations (1)–(3). Determination of the conversion, yield and selectivity were all on the basis of carbon moles if not specified. (1) Conversion = Carbon moles of reagents consumed Carbon moles of reagents input × 100 % (2) Selectivity = Carbon moles of products Carbon moles of reagents consumed × 100 % (3) Yield = Conversion × Selectivity"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Screen of catalysts,"3.1 Screen of catalysts The favorable basic and metal catalysts for condensation and hydrogenation were screened out by understanding the performance of the bifunctional catalyst in the integrated aldol condensation and hydrogenation of cyclopentanone. 3.1.1 Aldol condensation of cyclopentanone The distribution and quantity of basic sites on the catalyst were firstly characterized by CO2-TPD, as shown in Fig. 2 . The desorption curves in the whole temperature range can be divided into three parts (Smoláková et al., 2016). The diffraction peak below 110 °C can be attributed to the existence of weak-basic sites on the catalyst surface. The diffraction peaks between 110 °C and 450 °C were related to the mild-basic sites on the surface, and that above 450 °C was related to the presence of strong-basic sites. The weak and medium basic sites of important role in the self-condensation of cyclopentanone can be found in the adsorption curves of all catalysts (Yuan et al., 2020). Intensities of the TPD spectra indicate that the total amount of CO2 desorbed on MgO is much higher when compared to five other catalysts. These measurements indicate that MgO presented strong weak-basic site. And extremely strong mild-basic sites could be observed in Mg–Al–O. This means that Mg–Al–O has the strongest catalytic performance. Fig. 3 provides the condensation performance of cyclopentanone using different catalysts. The conversions of cyclopentanone over MgO and CaO were basically at the same level. The selectivities of dimer and trimer was basically the same, 71.5% and 12.0%, respectively. The yield of the targeted condensates was 59.8% when MgO was used as the catalyst for aldol condensation. The catalytic performance of amphoteric metal oxides for the self-condensation of cyclopentanone was quite poor, and the yield of condensates over Al2O3 was 17.1%. The conversion of cyclopentanone was 27.6% using Al2O3 as catalysts. The condensation performance of cyclopentanone was quite poor due to its poor weak- and mild-basic property (Yang et al., 2014). The selectivity of dimer was very high of 93.42%, which indicated that trimerization did not occur. NaY was also considered for condensation, considering its porous support and certain basic sites (Shen et al., 2011). It worked in the self-condensation of cyclopentanone, but its catalytic activity was quite poor with the conversion of cyclopentanone of only 20.3%. The catalytic performance of six catalysts for the self-condensation of cyclopentanone indicated that MgO among the tested alkaline earth metal oxides and Al2O3 among the tested amphoteric oxides were more favorable, while the catalytic performance of zeolite was poor. A composite bimetallic oxide catalyst was proposed. The strength of weak- and mild-basic site on the surface of Mg–Al–O catalyst was greatly improved, which differed greatly from individual oxides. The conversion of cyclopentanone reached 80.4%. Because of the increasement of the strong-basic sites on the Mg–Al–O catalysts, the trimerization of cyclopentanone was promoted (Tichit et al., 2003). The selectivity of trimer was significantly improved of 38%. The trimer presented a more complex structure and a higher carbon number than the dimer (Vila et al., 2002). Its energy density should be higher, thus the increasingly selective formation of trimer was conducive to improve the quality of aviation fuel. The total yield of the targeted product reached 77.3% by using Mg–Al–O. Mg–Al–O was determined as the optimized catalyst for self-condensation of cyclopentanone. 3.1.2 Hydrogenation of condensates Fig. 4 shows H2-TPR curves of four metal (Fe, Cu, Co and Ni) loaded catalysts for hydroprocessing of condensates. Hydrogenation catalysts loaded with different inexpensive metal elements were prepared by using γ-Al2O3 as support. The hydrogen consumption peaks (I) lower than 550 °C of the four catalysts were related to the bulk metal oxides. The strength of consumption peak (I) of Ni/γ-Al2O3 was the most predominant. This can be interpreted as a better loading of Ni over the surface of the support γ-Al2O3 (Takehira et al., 2005). The hydrogen consumption peak (II) above 550 °C was mainly aiming at the mixed metal oxide formed between the metal oxide and the support γ-Al2O3. It showed that the peak area of hydrogen consumption peak (II) of Cu/γ-Al2O3 was quite conspicuous, while that of Fe/γ-Al2O3, Co/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/γ-Al2O3 was much lower. The metal loading of all hydroprocessing catalysts can be regarded basically the same except for Cu/γ-Al2O3. The hydroprocessing performance of condensates using four catalysts is provided in Fig. 5 . It performed quite poor during the hydrogenation over Fe/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/γ-Al2O3, while the conversion of condensation reached even 94.5%. Dimer derived ketone (DDK) and dimer derived alkene (DDAK) occupied a major part among all the dimer hydrogenated product using Fe/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/γ-Al2O3 as catalysts. Taking Fe/γ-Al2O3 for example, the selectivity of DDK and DDAK reached 43% and 10.6%. At the same time, dimer derived alcohol (DDAC) was not detected in the liquid product, which indicated that dehydration of hydrogenated intermediates was a rapid reaction, and the ability to saturate CC by hydrogenation was weak, which was also confirmed by the abundant existence of TDAK (nearly 31%) (Li et al., 2016). The conversion of condensation products has been significantly improved when γ-Al2O3 loaded with Co and Ni was used as hydrogenation catalyst. The yield of DA and TA were greatly improved higher than 70%. The selectivity of DA and TA obtained over Ni/γ-Al2O3 reached 48.1% and 36.8%. Incomplete hydrogenation intermediates catalyzed by Fe/γ-Al2O3 and Co/γ-Al2O3 was obviously different. Incomplete hydrogenation intermediates are mainly DDK and DDAC, while DDAK was not detected substantially over Ni/γ-Al2O3. It was supposed that the hydrogenation of CC was improved over Co/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/γ-Al2O3, and the dehydration for DDAC is slightly worse than that of Fe/γ-Al2O3. The yield of targeted DA and TA product over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst reached the highest of 83.8%. Nickel was selected as the favorable choice for hydrogenation of self-condensates (Chen et al., 2019). 3.1.3 Integrated performance of aldol condensation and hydrogenation On the basis of previous results, bifunctional Ni/Mg–Al–O catalysts with Ni loading of 10 wt% on hydrotalcite was prepared and its integrated performance was provided in Fig. 6 . If not specified, the conversion in all integrated experiments were almostly 100%, either to C10 and C15 or to cyclopentanol formed by hydrogenation of cyclopentanone. It was disappointed to find that the yield of the targeted alkane was much lower (34.8%) than that produced by the two-reactor process over Mg–Al–O and Ni/γ-Al2O3 (63.28%) (Shao et al., 2019). About 20% cyclopentanone were hydrogenated into cyclopentanol, which was a side reaction. Comparing the one-pot and the usual two-reactor process, the condensation of cyclopentanone was basically the same, and the selectivity to C10 and C15 was quite similar of 67% and 33%. And the main differences lay in the depth of hydrogenation. The selectivity of DDK and DDAC reached 32.9%, and that of DA was only 34.8%. The selectivity of TDAK was much higher than that of TA (24.1%). It was speculated that the poor performance of Ni/Mg–Al–O may be related with the underutilized activity of Ni sites or the low loading of Ni, which led to the more formation of intermediates and less formation of targeted alkanes (Kong et al., 2015). For the first possibility, if Ni is to fully exert its hydrogenation activity, the uniformity of its loading on support is the key point (Lu et al., 2008). The pore structure and specific surface area present a very high demand. Considering that Mg–Al–O may not meet these requirements, Ni/Mg–Al–O was characterized to describe its textural property. Table 1 shows that the specific surface area of Ni/Mg–Al–O were only 55.843 m2/g. The poor structure of Mg–Al–O brought about the uniform Ni loading. Activated carbon (AC) with large specific surface area was applied as support in this study (Araña et al., 2003). Mg–Al–O was uniformly formed on activated carbon by co-precipitation method, and then, Ni was loaded uniformly on the prepared Mg–Al–O/AC. The specific surface area of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC has been greatly improved and its channel structure was also promoted. Fig. 7 shows the integrated result for the targeted alkanes using Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC as catalyst. The yield of the targeted alkanes reached 44.3% which was boosted by 10.5% compared with Ni/Mg–Al–O. The catalytic performance of bifunctional catalyst was improved obviously with promoted specific surface area and pore structure. The yield of C10 + C15 reached 90.8%, indicating that the condensation performance was improved by the loading of Mg–Al–O on activated carbon. It may be closely related to the uniform Mg–Al–O loading. It was favorable that the yield of cyclopentanol was less than 10%. In Fig. 7, the selectivity of DA was 38.5% and the selectivity of DDAC in the dimeric intermediate product reached 22.5%. An increase of the selectivity of dimeric alcohol meant an enhancement of the depth of hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC was improved. It may be attributed to the more uniform loading of Ni. Actually, the yield of DA + TA was still much lower than that in the two-reactor method (62.81%) (Shao et al., 2019). Then the preparation condition was considered, especially the Ni loading amount."
9,Effect of preparation condition,"3.2 Effect of preparation condition The influence of Ni loading on the comprehensive properties of aldol condensation and hydrogenation over Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC is provided in Fig. 8 . The yield of C10 + C15 increased, indicating that the introduction of Ni helped promote the condensation of cyclopentanone slightly. The yield of the targeted alkanes were significantly boosted by 36.8% with Ni loading increasing from 10 wt % to 20 wt %. The increase of the yield of the targeted alkanes may be attributed to the more extensive Ni loading, providing more active sites for hydrogenation (Erhan Aksoylu et al., 1997). The selectivity of condensed intermediates decreased significantly, while the total yield of the targeted alkanes reached 81.1%. It decreased to 57.6% with Ni loading of 30 wt %. The excessive Ni stacking on the external surface of the support and growing into larger particles, resulting in the pore volumes and pore sizes of the catalysts decreasing gradually (Zuo et al., 2012). The condensates cannot contact well with the internal Ni, which led to the dramatic reduction of hydrogenation depth of condensates. In Fig. 9 , it provides the influence of calcination temperature during the preparation of Mg–Al–O/AC on its catalytic performance. The condensation performance over Mg–Al–O/AC with the calcination temperature of 450 °C was quite poor. The conversion of cyclopentanone was 54.7% and the yield of the targeted condensates was 51.6%, in which dimer was the main product. The dehydration and decarburization of hydrotalcite precursors did not complete thoroughly, and skeletal stable Mg–Al–O/AC was not formed well, thus it can not play its best condensation performance (Rao et al., 1998). At higher calcination temperature, the conversion of cyclopentanone increased to the maximum of 83.5% and the yield of the targeted alkanes increased to 78.1% at 550 °C. With calcination temperature of 550 °C, the skeleton structure of hydrotalcite was stable and its alkaline sites on the surface can give full play to its condensation performance (Özdemir et al., 2014). Fig. 10 presents the effect of reduction temperature during the preparation of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC on its catalytic performance. The yield of the targeted alkanes increased first with the increasing reduction temperature. When the reduction temperature was 550 °C, the Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC catalyst performed best, and the yield of the targeted alkane reached 81.1%. The depth of hydrogenation was enhanced gradually with higher reduction temperature. The selectivity of DDAC decreased obviously, and that of the DA increased. The selectivity of DA and TA over Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC catalyst with reduction temperature of 550 °C was boosted by 34.2% compared with that at 450 °C. With the reduction temperature lower than 550 °C, the Mg–Al–O/AC catalyst has been activated with a good deal of Ni distributed in the form of NiO in the bifunctional catalyst, which led to poor hydrogenation effect. With the reduction temperature rising to 600 °C, the yield of the targeted alkanes decreased significantly, which may be attributed to the agglomeration of Ni (Chutoransky et al., 1971)."
10,Reusability of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC,"3.3 Reusability of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC The reusability of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC catalysts in 5 runs of integrated aldol condensation and hydrogenation is provided in Fig. 11 . In the 2nd run, the yield of the targeted alkanes decreased to 70.3%, while the yield of C10 and C15 showed little change. The selectivity of DDK and DDAC increased, while the selectivity of trimer alkene is basically unchanged. In the 3rd run, its catalytic performance deteriorated obviously, and the selectivity of the targeted alkanes decreased. The selectivity of all hydrogenated intermediates has been greatly improved, which proved that the hydrodeoxygenation performance of the catalyst became poor. The yield of the targeted alkanes was only 31.6% in the 5th run, which was only one third of that in the 1st run. In the 5th runs, the yield of cyclopentanol increased continuously. Fig. 12 shows the XRD analysis of fresh catalyst and spent catalyst after 3 and 5 times of reuse. The main peaks related to the hydrotalcite hydrate located at 2θ of 43°. Characteristic diffraction peaks of hydrotalcite hydrate in fresh catalysts were broad and low, which indicated that hydrotalcite hydrate were slightly distributed on the surface of the support. After used for times, the diffraction peaks of hydrotalcite hydrate in Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC bifunctional catalyst become larger, which meant that the amount of hydrotalcite hydrate became more. Poor reusability of catalyst was attributed to the hydration between the produced water and Mg–Al–O during the integrated reaction. The new structure of AlO(OH) would cover up parts of Ni species on the surface, hindering the contact of hydrogen with Ni species. The decreasing amount of effective Ni on the surface led to the lower catalytic activity of hydrogenation (Liang et al., 2015). Fig. 13 presents the catalytic performance of Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC in 5 runs using n-pentane as solvent. The less polar it is, the less soluble it is in water (Kiani et al., 2020). The polarity of n-pentane is 0 and the polarity of water is 10.2, thus n-pentane was selected as the solvent. In the 2nd run, the yield of the targeted alkanes kept high of 71.8%. In the 3rd run, its catalytic performance deteriorated slightly, and the selectivity of the targeted alkanes decreased. The selectivity of all hydrogenated intermediates was basically unchanged, which indicated that the hydrodeoxygenation performance of the catalyst was still great. Compared with the solvent-free experiment, the yield of the targeted alkanes decreased in the experiment using n-pentane as the solvent. It was much higher than that in the solvent-free experiment after the end of the five runs, and the yield of alkanes was approximately 64.8%. The activity of the Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC bifunctional catalyst used for times was greatly improved by using n-pentane as the solvent."
11,Theoretical analysis and its implication,"3.4 Theoretical analysis and its implication A novel method was provided to produce aviation fuel from sustainable and economical source. The biomass wastes are treated and reused. The total CO2 release in airline industry is reduced. Bifunctional catalyst with high efficiency was developed to integrate the condensation and hydrogenation for high yield of the targeted alkanes in the range of C9∼C16 in one pot, simplifying the operation process, avoiding the product separation, and reducing energy consumption. A theoretical basis was provided for the design of bifunctional catalyst for condensation/hydrogenation, which introduced the key issues of preparing bifunctional catalyst, like the basic sites, the metal sites and the support. The basic sites undertake the condensation function, while the metal active sites are responsible for hydrogenation and deoxygenation. The basic property should be well considered during the design of the bifunctional catalyst especially the amount of the weak- and medium-basic sites. The type and loading of metal sites will both affect the hydrodeoxygenation performance. It is vital to ensure the appropriate loading of metal. The uniformity of its loading on support is another key point. The pore structure and specific surface area present a very high demand. The pore distribution become more closely and it creates better environment for the contact between condensate and metal sites, which can be realized by the loading of bifunctional catalyst on the support with large specific surface area like AC. In the preparation of the bifunctional catalyst, both the reduction temperature and the calcination temperature showed great effect the condensation an hydrodof condensation catalyst and Ni distribution. From the economic viewpoint, the reusability of the bifunctional catalyst is the focus of attention. Poor reusability of catalyst was attributed to the hydration between the produced water and catalyst during the integrated reaction. It is a feasible method to design a bifunctional catalyst in a less polar organic solvent system. 0.65 ton of aviation fuel can be obtained from one ton of cyclopentanone. The price of aviation fuel is 5000–6000 Yuan/ton, thus the economic benefit is about RMB 3575 Yuan. Expanding production scale can reduce the production cost of aviation fuel and increase profits."
12,Conclusion,"Aldol condensation and hydrogenation was mostly performed a two-reactor method to obtain liquid hydrocarbon fuel in the existing processes, which is complicated and not suitable for large-scale industrial applications. Developing catalysts with dual functions by integrating self-condensation and hydrotreating in one pot in an eco-friendly process became necessary. An efficient and cheap bifunctional catalyst was prepared for condensation and hydrogenation of cyclopentanone derived from biomasses pyrolysis to produce aviation. Mg–Al–O has extremely strong mild-basic sites, which was favorable for aldol condensation. Nickel was the optimal catalyst for hydrogenation of self-condensates. The bifunctional catalyst Ni/Mg–Al–O/AC was then determined. The loading of Ni was optimized to be 20 wt % to provide appropriate active sites for hydrogenation to improve the performance at the optimized calcination and reduction temperature of 550 °C. n-pentane was added as solvent, improving the stability of catalyst after five experimental cycles. The yield of the target alkane was generally higher than that in the solvent-free experiment in 5 runs, remaining approximately 70%. This study helps simplify the operation process and reduce energy consumption, and the renewable production of aviation fuel from biomass becomes economical and practical, achieving the conversion of low-valued renewable and waste biomass into high-valued aviation fuel. In the future work, not only ketones will be used as the starting material for preparing jet fuel, but also biomass-derived aldehydes should be introduced."
