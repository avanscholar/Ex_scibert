0,Introduction,"There is growing concern with the expected increase in greenhouse emissions with the growth of the aviation industry [1]. To address this issue, the International Air Transportation Association aims to reduce by 2050 the net CO2 production by 50% compared with the 2005 levels [2]. The use of alternative aviation fuels is one of the most promising alternatives to reduce the greenhouse footprint of the aviation industry [3,4]. Several production pathways for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) have been studied [5–8]. The fuels produced from five of these pathways: Gasification & Fischer Tropsch (GFT) led synthetic kerosene containing aromatics (SKA) or synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) [8–10], Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) [5,11], Direct Sugars to Hydrocarbons (DSHC) [6,12] and Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) [13] have received ASTM certification for up to 50 vol % blends with commercial petroleum based jet fuels [14]. The fuels produced by other processes: Applied Research Associates' Catalytic Hydrothermolysis (CH) [15], Virent's BioForming (VB) process to produce synthesized kerosene (SK) [14] or synthesized aromatic kerosene (SAK) [14] and Hydrotreated Depolymerized Cellulosic Jet (HDCJ) [16,17] are under ASTM evaluation. One of the major challenges for the wide adoption of sustainable aviation fuels is the price competitiveness with conventional jet fuel [18]. Thus, it is critical to develop strategies to reduce production costs. Integration with existing industrial plants could provide cost reduction opportunities in terms of capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating costs (OPEX). Corn ethanol is one of the industries that offers process integration opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel production. In the US there are more than 200 corn ethanol plants, 5% of which are currently out of service [19]. As of 2015, the Midwest region had 76% of the corn ethanol plants, which produce 80% of total the bioethanol in the United States [20]. The traditional cost structure of a dry grind corn mill includes ethanol fermentation from corn kernels and solids processing to produce distillers grain. Co-product processing accounts for the largest share of capital cost that ranges from 35% to 45% while the corn grain constitutes the majority of the operational cost with 60% of the yearly OPEX [21,22]. Dry Grind Corn Ethanol Mills (DGCEM) are 1st generation biorefineries which process food crop and have a fixed product capacity of ethanol [23]. There is a growing body of literature reporting integrated concepts between emerging technologies and existing infrastructure [6,24–30]. These concepts explore industrial infrastructures such as sugarcane mills [6,26,30], pulp and paper mills [24,25,27] or petroleum refineries [28,29] to produce alternative fuels. Studies are also available on environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment in terms of greenhouse gas emission (GHG) is a popular approach to estimate the direct impact of using biomass based alternative fuel [11,31,32]. Some of the recent works include comparative analysis of LCA for various feedstock based SAF technology [31], comparative analysis of LCA for different source of feedstock (ethanol) in alcohol to jet (ATJ) process [33] and impact of different types of allocation methods [32,34,35]. However, the number of references studying integrated concepts with DGCEM is only limited to economic analyses [21,36,37]. Ou et al. (2014) studied the integration between a corn grain ethanol plant and a corn stover ethanol plant through a combined heat and power plant (CHP) to facilitate the energy requirement by both plants [21,36]. Wallace et al., 2005 studied four integration scenarios - utilities, power, purification and fermentation between dry grind corn ethanol and lignocellulosic corn stover ethanol in order to produce ethanol [36]. Both examples resulted in positive economic impact by reducing minimum fuel selling price (MFSP). The main objectives of this paper are to evaluate several integration scenarios between sustainable aviation fuel and DGCEM [38] with respect to potential cost and environmental impact reduction."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Methodology for evaluation of bio-refinery alternatives,"2.1 Methodology for evaluation of bio-refinery alternatives In order to evaluate concepts for the production of sustainable aviation fuels in a DGCEM, the methodology described by Garcia-Nunez et al. is followed [38]. The first step of this methodology is to build the design case of DGCEM which includes mass and energy balances, techno-economic analyses (TEA) and GHG emission analysis. Similar design cases are also built for SAF technologies for the following types - greenfield (standalone) facilities, co-located and/or repurposed scenarios. After removing scenarios that are not technically feasible, the remaining cases are evaluated using the same economic and environmental performance indicators to identify the most promising."
3,Dry corn ethanol baseline scenario,"2.2 Dry corn ethanol baseline scenario In this work, data of a large scale DGCEM plant, processing (0.6 ∙ 106 ton year−1) (22∙106 bushels year−1) to produce ethanol and dried distillers’ grain with solubles (DDGS) is used to build our baseline model. This is the baseline model, and the corresponding capital cost estimation is used to determine the maximum capital cost as well as the product capacities of the SAF technologies. Although modern dry corn mills of this capacity will produce 6800 ton of corn oil per year as a co-product [39,40], the production of corn oil is not considered in our design case. This assumption is made to align with older plants which represent 80% of the operational facilities in 2012 [19,40]. The information collected from the literature to build the design case is shown in Table 1 . It is assumed that all equipment are over-designed by 15%. It is also assumed that the existing DGCEM started its operation in 2012."
4,Sustainable aviation fuel scenario,"2.3 Sustainable aviation fuel scenario Five SAF greenfield processes are studied and used to build the base case (design case) scenarios: VB, ATJ, DSHC, FP and GFT (GFT-SPK; for the rest of the work, it is labeled as GFT). They are denoted as the following: VB_A, ATJ_A, DSHC_A, FP_A and GFT_A. Co-location strategies are applied in eight proposed scenarios - VB_B1, VB_B2, ATJ_B1, ATJ_B2, DSHC_B1, FP_B1, GFT_B1 and GFT_B2 (see more information in section 2.4). On the other hand, four repurposed scenarios are proposed - ATJ_C1, ATJ_C2, DSHC_C1 and DSHC_C2 (see more information in section 2.4). Here the letter “A” is used to indicate a greenfield scenario, the letter “B” means co-location and “C” means repurposing. The numbers are used to designate scenarios in a specific type. In this work, these cases produce a range of alternative fuels including jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, naphtha, fuel oil, light petroleum gas and bunker oil. The capacities of these fuels vary depending on the yield data for each technology. The potential degree of integration between SAF production technologies and DGCEM is limited by the capacity of the corn ethanol plants. If the existing DGCEM is very small compared to the SAF plant, the existing infrastructure will not be capable of absorbing an important fraction of the needs of the SAF unit. Tanzil et al., 2020 [44] estimated the total capital investment (TCI) of SAF technologies producing 60∙106 L year−1 of jet fuel to be in the range of $ 70 to $ 170 million US dollars (Table 2 ). CAPEX of DGCEM processing between 95 and 360 MLY of ethanol is in the range of 40–115 million US dollars [21,22,36]. For this study it is decided to limit the CAPEX of the jet fuel standalone units analyzed below 115 million US dollars. Table 2 shows the scaled down capacity of the SAF units (4–10 MLY) that are to be studied. The technical information used to build these SAF base cases are tabulated in supporting information (see Table S1A to Table S1E)."
5,Integrated biorefinery scenarios,"2.4 Integrated biorefinery scenarios Fig. 1 shows four of the integration scenarios between the base case SAF technologies and DGCEM studied in this paper. A successful integration requires a detailed understanding of the synergisms between the existing infrastructure and the emerging SAF production technologies [45]. The compatibility issues involve utilizing existing assets that have the potential to be shared or repurposed to fit the desired integration scenario. In general, these integration scenarios can be divided into two categories: co-location and repurposing. 2.4.1 Co-location According to the definition of co-location, provided by de Jong et al. (2015) [46], in a co-location scenario, a portion of the infrastructure and/or utilities from the existing DGCEM can be shared by an SAF technology. DGCEM infrastructure that can be shared are: buildings and service facilities (SF) (steam generation, power distribution, water distribution, wastewater treatment, etc.) [47] which are outside battery limits (OSBL) [48]. Among the components of SF (denoted as partial SF), only power distribution, power substation and water distribution facilities are considered for sharing. Both power and water consumptions are estimated directly and provided that these capacities are lower than those of DGCEM. But a 15% cutoff is assumed for sharing these facilities. Since the co-location is not an on-site addition to an existing DGCEM, yard improvements are not considered for co-location. Also, any process units from the inside battery limit (ISBL) of DGCEM which are responsible for conversion process are not considered for sharing to keep the DGCEM operation intact. In addition to partial sharing of SF, managerial and technical skills can also be shared. Engineering and consultation fees, legal expenses etc. Do not change with repurpose or co-location [49]. Although a new SAF plant will need its own labor force to operate the unit, labor cost reductions could be realized by using the existing corn ethanol plant personnel for the higher level of management. It is assumed that the management duo of maintenance supervisor and plant engineer of DGCEM share their management and technical skill to an SAF technology (denoted as partial management). But a higher-level manager is added to the management core of the co-located scenarios. (More information can be found in Table S13). New land cost is also added as land is not shared between DGCEM and co-located scenarios. Besides sharing features, these scenarios are highlighted by the power usage option. Both options of self-generation and purchase of power are analyzed under co-location scenarios. The co-located scenarios studied are summarized in Table 3 . 2.4.2 Re-purposing Unlike co-location, a repurposing strategy retrofits existing infrastructure to produce a different product; this may require additional unit operations [46]. In this paper, four repurposed facilities are studied (Table 4 ). In the ATJ_C1 scenario, DGCEM derived corn ethanol continues to an ethanol upgrading department instead of leaving the process. This is regarded as a repurposed scenario as the ethanol is converted into a new product instead of going into the market. ATJ_C2 utilizes a closed DGCEM which is purchased and has access to the units of ISBL and some of the OSBL components. In DSHC_C1, DGCEM derived sugar stream is utilized in the DSHC process to produce jet fuel and other hydrocarbon fuels as co-products. An operational DGCEM is utilized, thus the processed DDGS is considered as co-product. Similar to ATJ_C2, DSHC_C2 utilizes a shutdown DGCEM. In addition to power distribution and substation and water distribution facilities, these repurposed scenarios also consider fuel and raw material storage tanks as service facilities reduction from DGCEM. It is also noteworthy to state that ATJ_C1 is regarded as a fluid processing plant instead of a solid-fluid processing plant since there is no solid handling units in this scenario. In such case, the ratio factors are different for this scenario which are detailed in Table S3 to Table S5 and Table 6 ."
6,Mass and energy balances,"2.5 Mass and energy balances Mass and energy flow of each of the five base case facilities and the integrated biorefinery scenarios are estimated based on the data collected from literature [6,7,50–53] and described elsewhere (supporting information, Table S1A to S1E). Table S10A to S10E in the supplementary material summarize the raw material and net energy flows in the conversion sites of SAF base cases."
7,Techno-economic analysis,"2.6 Techno-economic analysis For both DGCEM and SAF technologies, capital costs are estimated using the percent delivered method based on total delivered equipment cost (TDEC) which has an estimation error range of ±30% [47]. In this method, ratio factors are applied to TDEC to estimate fixed capital investment (FCI) (see Table S3). In estimating TDEC, base equipment costs are taken from literature [6–8,51–53] and ASPEN simulations (Table S2A to Table S2F). Operational costs are estimated based on mass and energy flows (supplementary material Table S10A to Table S10E) and price data (supplementary material Table S8). The selling price of each hydrocarbon fuel that is regarded as co-product is determined by a regression analysis of historical prices of various types of fuel in USA (Figure S1). Total capital investment (TCI) is the summation of FCI and working capital. Working capital (WC) is assumed to be 20% of annual operational costs. Corn grain price is taken from the USDA at $136 Mg−1 ($3.71 bushel−1) [54]. The corn stover price is taken as $125.7 ton−1 with 20 wt % moisture content which covers the farm gate price, logistics and transportation cost (an assumed collection radius of 50 miles) [55,56]. Three of the four fixed variable costs - property insurance, local taxes and maintenance are estimated based on certain percentile of FCI while labor burden is 60% of labor salaries (see supplementary information, Table S7) [47]. The salary structure (both base salary and number of people) is adapted from Jones et al., 2013 [53]. Since these scenarios are scaled down from a larger capacity, the number of people is also reduced as described in Table S13. Capital and operational costs are used to run financial analyses. The financial analyses assume a real discount rate of 10 and 2% inflation in order to find out MFSP when the net present value (NPV) of sales and expenditures are equal. All the cost and price entities are adjusted to 2017$ using cost indices [57–60] for SAF processes. Although DGCEM's operation is assumed to start at 2012, its cost profile is adjusted to $2017 for integration purposes. The financial assumptions are reported in supplementary information (see Table S6) [7,18,61,62]. All the TEAs were conducted assuming the technology is utilized in mature plants (nth plant assumption) [7,46,51]. The reduced ratio factor of buildings in co-location cases is taken from the literature [47]. The reduced ratio factor of service facilities are estimated as recommended by Martinkus and Wolcott, 2017 [49]. The detailed estimation procedure is given in supporting information (see Table S4 and Table S5). Reduced factor of buildings cost in repurposing is taken from the literature as recommended elsewhere [46,47]. The value of shutdown DGCEM is added as fixed capital cost to the cost profile of ATJ_C2 and DSHC_C2. These values are estimated by remaining value of shutdown DGCEM infrastructures after five years of depreciation. In this work, we suppose that our DGCEM has been in operation since 2012 and that the SAF technologies will be operational in 2017."
8,Green house gas emission analysis,"2.7 Green house gas emission analysis Current regulatory framework prioritizes GHG emissions, hence a limited attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) strategy is applied to estimate the GHG emission profile from the biorefinery sites (DGCEM, SAF greenfield scenarios and integrated co-location and repurpose SAF scenarios) [63]. In ALCA, the material or energy flow of each entity is multiplied by corresponding emission factor which is defined as the quantity of the pollutant released to the atmosphere against a unit rate of activity associated with the pollutant [64]. Fig. 2 shows the system boundary for cradle-to-gate LCA (from feedstock to biofuel production) for all the scenarios - DGCEM, SAF base cases and integrated SAF scenarios to estimate GHG emission [33,65]. Biofuel transportation and usage are not included in this boundary. GHG emission estimation from corn cultivation is allocated to grain production and stover production on the basis of energy content in terms of lower heating value (LHV) [66]. The energy content and yield data of both grain and stover are from literature [20,66] (see supplementary material Table S9A). The corn production inventories are adopted from a USDA survey on energy balance of corn ethanol mill [43] and an excel model developed by University of Nebraska, Linclon [43,67,68] (see supplementary material Table S9B). The emission factors were taken from the Argonne National Laboratory's GREET database, EPA website and a database developed by University of Nebraska, Lincoln [64,67,69,70] (see supplementary information in Table S11 and S12). Emission factors for cooling water chemicals, waste water chemicals, boiler chemicals and waste disposal are back calculated from the corresponding emissions provided by Davis et al., 2015 [7]. The emission credit by DDGS is taken from literature [43,67,68]. Emission factors for other co-products - biomass based electricity and hydrocarbon fuels are also taken from literature [69,70]. One mega joule (MJ) of total fuel product is chosen as the functional unit for estimating GHG emissions in this paper. In this work, total fuel product capacity changes from one technology to another but it is assumed that the function of MJ of total fuel is same across all technologies. The emission per MJ of fuel is then compared to a known value of emission (87.3 gCO2-eq MJ−1 of fossil based transportation fuel) [72]."
9,Results and discussions,
10,Mass and energy flowrate,"3.1 Mass and energy flowrate This simulated design provided mass and energy flow for a DGCEM with 236 million liter of ethanol per year. Fig. 3 shows simplified version of material and energy flow calculated based on the information presented in Table 1. A total thermal energy requirement of 8.17 MJ per liter of ethanol [43] is assumed which translated into 0.26 MM MJ hr−1 of natural gas equivalent. Of the energy requirement, the portion that is required in the ethanol conversion facilities is estimated to be 6.37 MJ L−1 [43]. The rest of the energy in the form of diesel and gasoline is required by the corn production and transportation, ethanol distribution and farm machinery [43]. The product ratio is estimated to be 2.88 gal of ethanol per bushel of corn grain and 15.8 lbs of DDGS which are similar to literature [20]. CO2 is produced at the rate of 22,528 kg h−1. All our design cases are made to a fixed capital cost lower than 115 million US dollars resulting in jet fuel capacities between 3.5 and 9 million liters per year. Fig. 4 (A)–(E) shows the overall material and energy flow of each of the base case jet fuel technologies studied. The feedstock processed is estimated to be in the range of 3800–10000 kg h−1. Based on the data that are used to develop these processes, all but FP has an intermediate product-based power generation facility. Depending on the process, the excess of power generated is sold to wholesale market. Each process produces varied range of hydrocarbon co-products as shown in Fig. 4. The hydrogen consumption required for hydroprocessing varies among technologies. The hydrogen is assumed to be produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) and it is purchased by our SAF unit at a market price of $1.77 kg−1 [7,71]."
11,Techno-economic analysis,"3.2 Techno-economic analysis Based on material and energy balance and cost data derived from literature and ASPEN simulation, TDEC is estimated to be 16.5 MM$. Ratio factors are applied to estimate TCI to be 115 MM$. OPEX is calculated to be 148 MM$, of which 75% came from feedstock contribution. The minimum ethanol selling price is estimated ($0.435 L-1 of ethanol at 2012) without considering any government incentives. Table 5 shows the modified ratio factors for two cost components in co-location scenarios. The new ratio factor for buildings are taken from the literature [47] while the SF ratio factors are modified according to the methodology elsewhere (Table S5) [49]. The co-located SAF scenarios consume electricity in the range of 1150–2963 kWh (Fig. 4) which are lower than DGCEM capacity of 7.6 MWh (Fig. 3) but exceeds the 15% cutoff point. Therefore, no sharing of the distribution and substation facilities for these co-located scenarios. The SAF scenarios consume water in the range of 6272–117513 kg h−1 water distribution facility can be shared except ATJ and GFT scenarios both of which exceed the 15% limit. These two sharing strategies resulted in reduced ratio factor of service facilities for the studied SAF integrated scenarios (Table 5). Table 6 reports new ratio factors in four repurposing scenarios using the ATJ and DSHC processes. The main assumptions made for each of the repurposing scenarios are shown in Table 4. The shutdown DGCEM is entirely used in the ATJ_C2 and DSHC_C2 scenarios. Therefore, the 15% limit for sharing SF is not applicable. In addition, raw material storage and finished product storage are used. For ATJ_C1, power and water facilities from DGCEM are entirely used to produce the ethanol. Nevertheless, the required power (72 kWh) and water (11884 kg h−1) by the upgrading section of ATJ_C1 falls below the 15% limit and therefore no additional facilities are required. The same rationale is applied to DSHC_C2. Table 7 shows the results of each scenario as jet fuel MFSP. Each of the integrated SAF scenarios offered lower MFSP than the corresponding base case process. Two co-located scenarios of Virent - VB_B1 and VB_B2 offer 4 and 16% reduction from the base case MFSP of $4.41 L-1 of jet fuel, respectively. VB_B2 has a lower MFSPs; this process does not include the capital-intensive power generation module. Similar co-located scenarios of ATJ (ATJ_B1 and ATJ_B2) results in 4% and 19% reduction, respectively from the base value of $4.16 L-1. FP_B1 reduced the MFSP by 3% from the base case value of $2.14 L-1 of jet fuel. GFT_B2 has a higher reduction due to the exclusion of the power generation. Similar to VB_B2 and ATJ_B2, DSHC_B1 also explores the cost reduction opportunities when cost sensitive power generation is replaced by purchased cost which resulted in 16% reduction. The first repurposed facility of ATJ (ATJ_C1) utilizes the corn ethanol and reduces the MFSP by 67% from the base case value of $ 4.09 L-1 of jet fuel. In this work, expensive cellulosic ethanol module is replaced by a less expensive DGCEM to provide the required ethanol (Table S2B). The impact on FCI due to this type of facility is shown in Fig. 5 which brought about a 92% reduction from the base case. This is supported by another work [52] where FCI is reduced by 70% by replacing ethanol producing module with purchasing ethanol. In this work, the cellulosic ethanol production module has higher cost estimation because of a power generation and pretreatment module. Therefore, FCI reduction is as high as 92%. The corn ethanol cost is added as an operational cost. Due to significant decrease in FCI estimation, this scenario also resulted in lower estimation of fixed OPEX and other variable OPEX (Fig. 6 ). In the ATJ_C2, a shutdown DGCEM is repurposed by using the existing equipment in an ATJ process. Three areas are identified in a DGCEM, which is utilized to produce corn stover derived ethanol: saccharification and liquefaction, fermentation, and separation. Further details are given in Table S2B. Table 7, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 show the impact of repurposing strategy on DSHC integration with DGCEM. Applying the modified ratio factors from Table 6, DSHC_C1 decreased the estimated FCI by only 3% after utilizing an operational DGCEM. However, the OPEX is more than doubled compared to the base case DSHC (Fig. 6) as a result of the higher cost and volume of corn grain (23710 kg/hr @$0.15/kg) than corn stover (4015 kg h−1 @ $0.13 kg−1). This significant increase in OPEX caused 167% increase in MFSP (Table 7). DSHC_C2 utilizes a shutdown DGCEM which is valued at 13.6 MM$ as mentioned above and used as FCI component. But shutdown DGCEM provides additional cost reduction opportunities as mentioned above in section 2.4. Thus, the estimated FCI (DGCEM value plus the new addition) is decreased by 18% from the base case (Fig. 5 and Table S2C) which causes a drop in newly calculated fixed OPEX as well. But the maintenance and repair cost is estimated based on the new addition of equipment only. Eventually total OPEX decreases by 7%. These changes lower the MFSP by 13%. The estimated management core of SAF technology accounts for 10% of the total salary load. Therefore, in co-located scenarios the cost of salaries is reduced by 10%. The labor cost can only be decreased in a repurposed facility that involves an operational DGCEM. Fig. 7 shows the cost distribution for each of the integrated scenarios, the cost contribution ($ L−1 SAF) is estimated for six components: feedstock cost, other OPEX, corporate income tax, depreciation, and annual cash income. Other OPEX is defined as the sum of variable OPEX and fixed OPEX where the former includes raw material costs (H2, H2SO4, KOH, NaCl, yeast etc.) and energy costs and the latter is the sum of salaries and other associated costs as described in section 2.6. Annual cash income is the difference between the net revenue (sales minus expenses) and corporate income tax [7,51]. Capital depreciation is estimated in each year to determine the federal tax [7,51] until a certain period of time when the capital cost is entirely depreciated. In this work, the general plant is depreciated in 7 years and the power/steam plant (depending on the process) is depreciated in 20 years. Each cost component changes every year due to inflation. Therefore, these costs are summed up and normalized by the SAF capacity throughout the entire plant life (SAF capacity at the startup plus SAF capacity for the rest of the plant life). The cost contribution by these segments are not uniform, it depends on the type of integration. For example, feedstock has higher contribution for DSHC_C1 which uses corn as feedstock instead of corn stover. Feedstock has also significant contribution towards MFSP of ATJ_C1 where ethanol is purchased. For each scenario, other OPEX also contributes significantly towards the MFSP. The co-product contribution depends on the degree of fractionations. Corporate income tax, depreciation and annual cash income have less influence over the MFSPs."
12,Sensitivity analysis,"3.3 Sensitivity analysis Various cost entities that contribute towards the MFSPs (Fig. 7) carry uncertainty which depends on the assumptions of process inputs or variables that are associated with these process models. These inputs can largely be categorized into two classes - technical and financial. Some of the technical variables are product capacity or product yield, conversion efficiency of process operations, consumptions of materials, operational ramp up, operating hours etc. (See Table S1A-S1E) while financial variables include feedstock price, major raw material, or energy price (H2, natural gas etc.), capital cost, equity, discount rate, tax rate etc. Each of these variables has various degree of impact on the final performance indicator such as MFSP. Authors across the literature have covered this uncertainty or sensitivity analysis focusing on various parameters’ impact on MFSPs [7,8,18,51,52,61]. But in this work, four parameters are selected to run the sensitivity analysis: feedstock price, fixed capital investment, equity, and discount rate. Sensitivity for product capacity is not carried out to maintain the technical feasibility of using a DGCEM (section 2.3). Few other parameters such as product ramp-up [5], operating hours [8], income tax rate [18] etc. are not considered due to lower product capacities as these parameters are directly associated with product capacities. Table 8 lists the base, favorable and unfavorable values for the studied parameters. A base case real discount rate of 10% is assumed with a base value of 30% equity [7,51]. In a percent delivered method, FCI has a typical error range of ±30% [47]. The other three base values are assumed to have ±50% deviation for sensitivity analyses. A single point sensitivity analysis (tornado chart) is carried out for each of the co-located and repurposed scenarios to determine the MFSP reaction to changes in a specified design parameter while other parameters are unchanged. These charts (Figs. 8 and 9 ) show the sensitivity of four parameters in descending order. 3.3.1 Co-location Fig. 8 shows that each parameter has a similar range of sensitivity for the co-located scenarios studied. FCI has the highest degree of sensitivity towards MFSP for all co-located scenarios except for GFT_B2. The capital-intensive power generation module is absent at both VB_B2 and GFT_B2. However, GFT_B2 has a higher feedstock cost than VB_B2 (Fig. 7). Therefore, feedstock has the greatest influence over MFSP for GFT_B2. With a real discount rate of 5%, MFSPs are decreased by 8–15% while MFSPs are increased by 21–33% for the unfavorable real discount rate of 15%. Equity appears to be the least sensitive parameter. 3.3.2 Repurposing Fig. 9 shows the sensitivity of the mentioned parameters for four repurposed scenarios. All of the parameters except feedstock cost have similar range of sensitivity across the scenarios. Feedstock cost has significant impact on both ATJ_C1 and DSHC_C1 as a result of their comparatively high feedstock costs."
13,GHG emission profile,"3.4 GHG emission profile Corn grain, corn stover, ethanol production: Based on life cycle inventory given in section 2.7, the GHG emission profile of the corn grain cultivation and ethanol production in DGCEM is presented in Table 9 . According to energy allocation method (as explained in section 2.7), 77% of total emission burden of corn cultivation is allocated to the corn grain production. The resulting GHG emission profile for grain is 16.3 g CO2-eq MJ−1. Displacement method [43,67,68] is used to account for the co-product emission profile of DDGS. Among the twelve integrated scenarios studied in this work, one case resulted in GHG reductions, six has the same and five scenarios resulted in higher GHG compared with their base case (see cases: XXX_A) (Table 10 ). The emission profile of conversion section is lower for ATJ because of lower consumption of hydrogen. VB_B2 has a higher emission profile as a result of purchasing electricity instead of generating inside the integrated facility. ATJ_B2, DSHC_B1 and GFT_B2 also have higher emission due to same reason. ATJ_C1 utilizes corn ethanol from DGCEM and this results in slightly higher emission profile than base case. The feedstock emission profile for this scenario is estimated from the corn grain emission profile of DGCEM. Both VB and ATJ have technical similarities which is reflected in the type of raw materials that both scenarios consume. DSHC_C1 has a high emission profile because of the thermal energy consumption by DGCEM to produce a sugar stream. The resulting fuels in twelve scenarios have GHG emission ranging from 13 to 93% of fossil fuel [72]."
14,Selection matrix,"3.5 Selection matrix Tables 7 and 10 provides the economic and environmental performance data of the integrated scenarios against their respective base cases, respectively. But a comparative platform is needed for decision makers or stake holders to select a scenario based on their requirement. In this section, this comparative platform is built in two stages. In the first stage, a simple normalization process is followed to rank all the scenarios (including base cases) based on the two performance criteria. A range of 0–100% is attributed to each of the scenarios’ performance on economic (MFSP) as well as an environmental (GHG) scale. Lower MFSP values indicate higher economic performance and vice versa. Similarly, lower the emission profile, higher is the performance percentage on GHG scale and vice versa. Details are given in Table S14 and Table S15. Fig. 10 shows the normalized values of the performance matrix which maintain consistency with the actual performance value as demonstrated in Tables 7 and 10. For example, Table 10 shows that GFT_B1 has the lowest emission profile among the integrated scenarios. This is reflected in the spider plot (Fig. 10) with 100% score. But this scenario only reduced the MFSP by 4% from its corresponding base value of $3.7 L-1 of jet (Table 7) which caused 40% score in the economic scale. On the other hand, ATJ_C1 topped with 100% score in the economic scale and scored 90% in environmental scale. DSHC_C1 has the lowest score in both criteria as discussed above in the two-performance matrix (Tables 7 and 10). While the performance criteria described above provides a comparative platform, the stake holders may have different priorities. Therefore, in the second stage, an importance based (weight factor) ranking is used to prioritize each scenario based on equal importance or unbalanced economic and environmental importance values [38]. Table 11 lists the weighting factors distributed in each category and sub-category for three assumed sets of priorities - equilibrated, economic, and environmental. Equation (1) [38] is used to estimate the final performance value for each of the scenarios. A and B are defined in Table 11. (1) F V = N P A C × A + N P B D × B Here, NP represents the normalized percentile for each of the scenario in each performance criterion (Fig. 10). Fig. 11 shows the final score of each of the scenarios in three different options: equilibrated, economic, and environmental. In all options, it turned out that ATJ_C1 has the highest degree of acceptance among the three decision-making options."
15,Conclusions,"The conversion of an existing DGCEM for the production of SAF offer cost reduction opportunities. However, the relatively small size of a typical DGCEM unit restrict the production capacity of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technologies that could be co-located with the unit. In this paper we answered the question of whether reduction in production cost associated with the co-locations or repurposing with a corn ethanol mill is higher than the expected cost increases associated with the reduction in the scale of the SAF unit. Our study confirms that reductions in MSFP (compared with the corresponding greenfield facility) in the range of 3–67% were achievable in eleven integrated scenarios. The highest reduction is observed when ATJ is produced in a repurposed facility. In the case of GHG we were able to identify one scenario with lower GHGs, six without changes and five in which the GHG increased. SAF in twelve scenarios have GHG emission ranging from 13 to 93% of fossil fuel. The source of electricity (self-generation or purchase), hydrogen production via SMR plant, the use of final product or intermediate from DGCEM and co-products (hydrocarbon fuels, lignin, electricity) have made an impact both economically and environmentally."
