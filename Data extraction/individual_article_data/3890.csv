0,Introduction,"Alkenes are important kind of raw materials for the synthesis of rubber, plastics, and organic chemical materials in the industry. However, the presence of alkadienes in alkenes streams will poison the initiators for the polymerization of alkenes [1]. Therefore, it is industrially significant to remove the alkadienes impurity from alkenes streams. Among the considered strategies, converting alkadienes to alkenes by selective hydrogenation has been receiving much attention [2]. Noble metal-based catalysts like Pd and Pt have been widely used for the selective hydrogenation due to their high catalytic activity [3]. However, noble metallic catalysts normally have low butenes selectivity because of their strong hydrogen activation [4]. Accordingly, many researchers have modified the support materials to enhance the selectivity of butenes. For instance, Xu et al. modified the Pd/γ-Al2O3 by adding different halide ions, leading to nearly 80% of butenes selectivity [5]. Bachiller and co-workers achieved 95% butenes selectivity by modifying the nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with sulfonic groups (–SO3H) [6]. By tuning the interactions between supports and noble metals, the catalysts with higher butenes selectivity can be achieved. Therefore, the development of efficient support materials is important for the selective hydrogenation of alkadienes. In recent years, natural materials have been regarded as viable alternatives to conventional support materials for loading catalytically active metal nanoparticles [7-9]. This is because natural support materials are valued for their hierarchical structures with inherent surface functional groups by default. For example, eggshell (ES) has multiple potential advantages, such as hierarchical porous structure with 7000−17 000 funnel-shaped pore canals between the first layer and the second layer of ES, which favors the mass and heat transfer. Besides, there are numerous functional groups (–COOH, –NH2, –OH, –SO3H, etc.) on the natural ES which may have strong interactions with metal precursors and benefit the uniform dispersion of the metal nanoparticles (NPs) [9]. Basically, the ES contains three layers, including the innermost shell membranes, a calcified layer, and the outermost cuticle layer [10]. Based on these properties, a series of works have been carried out to explore the practical applications of ES recently. For instance, Ding et al. highlighted the advantage of environmental compatibility of the ES, which was utilized as a sensor and catalyst for the efficient detection and treatment of 4-nitrophenol [10]. Minakshi et al. utilized the ES as the electrode in Li-ion capacitors which showed the comparable electrochemical performance to the commercial activated carbon [11]. Recently, our group prepared Ag/ES supported catalysts with high catalytic performance and stability for benzene oxidation due to the hierarchical porous structures of ES facilitating the mass and heat transfer [12]. These studies had demonstrated the potentials of ES in various applications, particularly as a support in enhancing catalytic activity. Likewise, it is possible that ES will play a role in enhancing the catalytic activity for the selective hydrogenation of alkadienes, in which, to our knowledge, has not been reported yet. Herein, ES was used as a scaffold for the first time to prepare the highly efficient catalyst support for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation. It can be used as a natural modified carrier due to the large amount of sulfonic groups in ES. Firstly, the ratio of Pd/Ag was regulated to optimize the catalytic performance of Pd-Ag/ES, leading to excellent performance with butenes selectivity of 95.8% and 1,3-butadiene conversion of 95%. Next, to fully understand the surface properties of ES, the effect of sulfonic groups on the catalytic performance was studied and a plausible mechanism was explored via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and in situ DRIFTS studies. It is believed that there are two factors responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance, that is, (i) the sulfonic groups on the ES promote the desorption of alkenes on Pd NPs by changing the electronic properties of Pd NPs, and (ii) the Ag component was an inert metal for this reaction, but it could dilute the Pd ensembles. This work aims to investigate the structure-activity relationships of Pd-Ag/ES catalyst as well as the feasibility of ES as an alternative support for the selective hydrogenation of alkadienes. In summary, using biomaterials as the support of catalyst can help reseachers get rid of the complex modification process of carrier and utilize the bio-waste like eggshell to reduce the environmental pollution, which provides reference for the application of biological materials in the field of hydrogenation catalysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The waste ES was obtained from the canteen located in Quanzhou Normal University of China, which was carefully rinsed with deionized (DI) water for several times and then was dried overnight at room temperature. The dry ES was grounded and sieved through a 100-mesh screen to obtain the ES powder. A controlled ES sample was also prepared by removing the shell membrane (denoted as ES-no). Firstly, the outer membrane of the ES was tore off, and then the ES was soaked in NaOH solution (0.1 mol L − 1) and was stirred at 80 °C for 0.5 h to remove the inner membrane. NaBH4, NaOH, and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Palladium nitrate (Pd(NO3)2•2H2O) was provided by Aldrich (Germany). Commercial CaCO3 (com-CaCO3) was bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. DI water was used throughout this work."
3,Preparation of pd-ag/es,"2.2 Preparation of pd-ag/es In this work, the loading amount of Pd and Ag on the catalyst was 0.5 wt% and 0.125 wt%, respectively, with a Pd/Ag ratio of 4:1. Pd(NO3)2•2H2O (75 mmol L − 1) and AgNO3 (100 mmol L − 1) aqueous solutions were separately reduced with 2 mL NaBH4 solution (0.2 g L − 1) at 90 °C for 0.5 h. Afterwards, the two sols containing metal nanoparticles were mixed with 0.21 g of ES powder, which was further stirred for 0.5 h with 600 rpm at 90 °C. Next, the suspension was filtered by using a cellulose filter membrane (0.8 µm). It was then rinsed for at least five times with DI water and was dried at 50 °C for 12 h. The obtained catalyst was labeled as Pd-Ag/ES. In addition, the catalysts with different Pd-Ag ratios and support materials (e.g., commercial calcium carbonate (com-CaCO3) or ES without the shell membrane (ES-no) were also prepared using a similar method."
4,Characterizations of pd-ag/es,"2.3 Characterizations of pd-ag/es The surface morphology and size of samples were observed by using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS SIGMA, Germany) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAI F30, USA). Crystal structures of samples were tested by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, RigakuUltima IV, Japan) with Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. The valence states of Pd and Ag on ES with different ratios were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The organic functional groups on the catalysts were tested by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, USA), where the KBr powder was mixed with the samples and then was pressed into an appropriate disk. The content of S was tested by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP, Agilent 7700 ICPMS). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a chemical adsorption analyzer (MFTP-3060, China) by using a H2-Ar (5%/95%, v/v) mixture as a reducing gas. Thermal stability of the samples was performed with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600, USA)."
5,Catalytic Activity evaluation method,"2.4 Catalytic Activity evaluation method The 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a miniature fixed-bed reactor containing 50 mg of catalyst at 45 °C under atmospheric pressure with variable total flow rates of 18,000, 36,000, and 54,000 mL min−1 gcat −1. In addition, the sample was subjected to stability tests for at least 30 h. The composition of the stream was 93.55% N2, 4.3% H2, and 2.15% 1,3-butadiene. On-line gas chromatography (GC) (Shanghai OH, Model GC-9160) was used to detect the products in the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. The conversion and selectivity were calculated by using the normalization method with the GC peaks area corresponding to the reaction products. The 1,3-butadiene conversion and the selectivity of butenes are calculated as follows: (1) X = ( n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − B R − n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − A R ) n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − B R × 100 % = n 1 − b u t e n e + n c i s − 2 − b u t e n e + n t r a n s − 2 − b u t e n e + n b u t a n e n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − B R × 100 % = ( ∑ f i A i ) f P A P × 100 % (2) Y = n 1 − b u t e n e + n c i s − 2 − b u t e n e + n t r a n s − 2 − b u t e n e ( n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − B R − n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − A R ) × 100 % = ∑ f Z A Z ∑ f i A i × 100 % TOF = X × Y × V g a s n P d ( s − 1 ) X refers to 1,3-Butadiene conversion and Y is the selectivity of butenes. The n n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − B R refers to the molar amount of 1,3-butadiene before the reaction; n 1 , 3 − b u t a d i e n e − A R is the molar amount of 1,3-butadiene after the reaction; f i , f P , f Z are the correction factors of product i, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes, respectively; A i , A P and A Z are the peak areas of product i, 1,3-butadiene before reaction and butenes, respectively. Vgas is the total molar flow rate, and nPd is the molar amount of Pd in the catalyst."
6,DFT calculations,"2.5 DFT calculations Using Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP), the first-principle DFT calculations were performed. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe ion-electron interaction and the energy cutoff was set to be 450 eV. In order to describe the exchange-correlation interaction, generalized gradient approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parameterization (GGA-PBE) functional was chosen in the calculations. As for the setting of the calculation parameters, the convergence thresholds have been set to 10−5 eV and 10−2 eV/Å for the input energy and the force, respectively. The lattice parameters for elements were a = b = 11 Å, and c = 20 Å along the Z direction to avoid the interactions of the periodic images. The Pd surface containing 32 Pd atoms within each layer by comprehensively considering the computational cost and accuracy. The Brillouin zone was sampled by Monkhorst-Pack-points mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 for structure optimization and 4 × 4 × 1 for band structure calculation. The adsorption energy was calculated through the following formula: Ead (1,3-butadiene) = E (1,3-butadiene-Pd) − E (1,3-butadiene) – E (Pd), where E (1,3-butadiene-Pd), E (1,3-butadiene), and E (Pd) were single-point free energy of relaxed geometry of 1,3-butadiene-Pd, 1,3-butadiene, and Pd. Similarly, we also performed the same calculations for 1-butene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene, respectively with the same computational settings."
7,In situ DRIFTS calculation,"2.6 In situ DRIFTS calculation In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) was performed on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). At first, the catalyst (15 mg) was pressed into a supported disk. The background spectrum was collected under the atmosphere of N2 (50 mL min−1), and automatically subtracted from the next sample spectra. Then, the sample was soaked under the stream of 93.55% N2, 4.3% H2, and 2.15% 1,3-butadiene at 35 °C for 1 h (50 mL min−1) to fully adsorb the 1,3-butadiene and its reaction intermediates. Afterward, the reaction stream was cut off and the sample was flushed in N2 steam for 15 min. Finally, the in situ DRIFTS spectra were measured under the temperature from 35 °C to 85 °C, each temperature was kept steady for at least 10 min."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterizations of Pd-Ag/ES catalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of Pd-Ag/ES catalysts The size and morphologies of Pd and Ag NPs can be observed from the TEM images shown in Fig. 1 (a-c). It can be seen from the TEM images that the metal NPs are well dispersed on the ES surface, whereby the average particle size was determined to be about 3.66 nm (inset in Fig. 1(a)). As shown in Fig. 1(d), the HRTEM image of the Pd-Ag/ES catalyst displays the crystal lattice with spaces of 0.226 nm and 0.208 nm, which can be ascribed to the Pd (111) and Ag (200), according to the standard PDF cards of Pd (JCPDS PDF#46–1043) and Ag (JCPDS PDF#04–0783), respectively. The results indicate that both Pd and Ag NPs were successfully loaded on the ES support. According to the individual particle size statistics in Fig. S6, the particle size of Pd NPs was determined to 3.40 nm while the Ag NPs was 3.71 nm. It was reported that the Pd NPs with the size of 3–5 nm exhibit excellent performance for selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene [6, 13-15]. Meanwhile, Fig. 1 (e-f) show the TEM images of Pd-Ag/ES-no and Pd-Ag/com-CaCO3 prepared with the same condition as Pd-Ag/ES. Unlike Pd-Ag/ES and Pd-Ag/ES-no, Pd and Ag NPs tend to agglomerate over the com-CaCO3 support. This can be associated with the different morphology and surface properties between ES and com-CaCO3. As shown in Fig. S1, ES has abundant surface folds and macropores. The hierarchically porous structures with high porosity are beneficial to the dispersion of Pd and Ag NPs [16, 17]. However, the surface of com-CaCO3 is smooth with intact structures, resulting in the uneven dispersion and serious agglomeration of metal NPs. The TEM image (Fig. 1(g)) and the corresponding EDX elemental maps (Fig. 1 (h-n)) appear to show that the Pd NPs and Ag NPs were evenly distributed on the ES. It is worth noting that the Fig. 1(b) shows a certain amount of S element in the Pd-Ag/ Es catalyst, which will be discussed in detail later. The crystalline structure of Pd-Ag/ES sample was then characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2 , there are no diffraction peaks of Pd or Ag in the XRD pattern due to the low loading amount. The main diffraction peaks are well-consistent with the calcite-type CaCO3 (JCPDS PDF#29–0305). The XRD patterns of Pd-Ag/ES and ES are basically the same, indicating the intact crystalline structure of ES during the catalyst preparation process. Besides, the textural properties of Pd-Ag/ES and ES samples were explored by the N2 physisorption method. As shown in Fig. S2, both samples showed the type Ⅱ isotherms [18], which is a characteristic of macroporous materials (surface area 1.3667 m2/g). The result shows that the ES porosity did not change after the loading of highly dispersed Pd and Ag NPs (Table S1). In order to validate the organic compositions of the Pd-Ag/ES catalyst, and three support samples (ES, ES-no, and com-CaCO3) were analyzed by FTIR. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the characteristic IR band centering at 3394 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of –OH from adsorbed water [19]. The two well-defined bands at 2983 and 2866 cm−1 are attributed to C = O and CH groups in the ES [20, 21]. The strong peak at 2512 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetrical vibration of carbonate [22]. Besides, the weak peak at 1640 cm−1 belongs to the tensile vibration of the sulfonic group SO–H bond while the peak of 1070 cm−1 is corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibration of O = S = O [23, 24]. The results verified the presence of a small amount of sulfonic groups on the ES and Pd-Ag/ES samples. In order to further confirm the existence of sulfonic groups on the ES, the ICP was used to measure the content of element S in the ES, which shows an amount of 0.057 wt% (see Table S2). There is no significant difference between the FTIR spectra of Pd-Ag/ES and ES. Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks of sulfonic groups did not appear in the curves of the ES-no which means that the sulfonic groups are mainly on the shell membranes which can be eliminated by removing the egg membrane. Subsequently, the Pd-Ag/ES, Pd-Ag/ES-no, and ES samples were analyzed by TG analysis. Based on Fig. 3(b), there are two steps of weight losses of Pd-Ag/ES and ES samples in the range between 250 and 800 °C. The first one belongs to the decomposition of the shell membrane at about 250 °C, accounting for about 4 wt%. Considering the element of S takes about 0.057 wt%, it indicates that there are a large number of sulfonic groups on the shell membrane. The second one is contributed to the decomposition of CaCO3 at about 670 °C [25]. Besides, the profile of Pd-Ag/ES is similar to the pristine ES, which indicates that the egg membrane was not damaged during the preparation of Pd-Ag/ES. It is worth mentioning that the TG curves of the Pd-Ag/ES sample before the reaction (Pd-Ag/ES-BF) and the sample after the reaction (Pd-Ag/ES-AF) in Fig. S3 were basically the same, which proves that the coking reaction can be ignored under the evaluation conditions. In addition, XPS was performed to study the surface chemical valence information of metallic NPs in Pd-Ag/ES and Pd-Ag/ES-no. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the binding energies of Pd0 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd-Ag/ES catalyst are about 335.3 eV and 340.5 eV, respectively [26]. In contrast, the peaks of Pd0 of Pd-Ag/ES-no shifted to a lower position at 335.2 and 340.4 eV. This can be ascribed to the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups binding with Pd NPs, considering the large content of sulfonic groups in the eggshell and more obvious than other groups in the infrared spectrum, it is believed that the sulfonic group is the dominant role. A similar explanation was reported by Zhu et al., who showed that the sulfonic groups modified on supports had a significant impact on the electronic properties of Pd [27]. The peaks at 342.6 and 337.0 eV of Pd-Ag/ES belong to the oxidized state of Pd [28]. It is obvious that the Pd-Ag/ES has a higher amount of Pd2+ species than Pd-Ag/ES-no. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the two characteristic peaks of Ag 3d on the Pd-Ag/ES-no at 367.7 and 373.7 eV also shifted to a lower position as compared to that of the Pd-Ag/ES at 368.1 and 374.0 eV, respectively. From this perspective, the Pd and Ag species on the ES both participated in this electron transfer process which becomes more electron-deficient as the electrons were transferred from the metallic NPs to the ES support (the sulfonic group) [15]. It is well known that the variations of butenes selectivity is related to subtle changes of the relative concentrations of Pd NPs surface species which are often associated with the electron density of the catalytic sites [29]. In this way, the changes in the electronic property of Pd NPs may affect their adsorption performance for intermediate alkenes, which in turn affects their activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation reactions."
10,Catalytic Performance of Pd-Ag/ES catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic Performance of Pd-Ag/ES catalysts The hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene in the presence of the monometallic Pd/ES catalysts was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the Pd/ES catalyst exhibited a high activity towards 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation (~59%) and a considerable butenes selectivity (~78.8%) at Pd loading of 0.25 wt%. However, when the conversion achieved 100% at the Pd loading of 0.5 wt% and 0.75 wt%, the selectivity of butenes rapidly decreased to 52% and 32%, respectively. To further improve the butenes selectivity, bimetallic Pd-Ag/ES catalyst was studied. As shown in Fig. 5(b), with the decrease of the Pd/Ag ratio (1:0, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, fixing Pd loading), the activity of Pd-Ag/ES catalyst decreased sharply (100%~42%), but the selectivity was greatly improved (52%~98.5%). The results are consistent with the conclusions drawn by others that Ag, as the second metal, is thought to behave as a spectator in the hydrogenation reaction. As shown in Fig. S5, the butenes selectivity of Pd-M/ES (M: Ni, Cu, Co and Ag) catalysts are higher than Pd/ES, which is consistent with the conclusion that he roles of second metal is mainly used to dilute Pd ensembles and decrease the adsorption strength of hydrocarbons [30, 31]. The best performance of the Pd-Ag/ES can be achieved when the ratio of Pd/Ag was 4:1, that is, the high butenes selectivity (~95.8%) can be obtained with an excellent conversion of 1,3-butadiene (~95%). Fig. 5(c) shows the performance of the Pd-Ag/ES catalyst at different reaction temperature conditions. When the reaction temperature rose from 35 to 50 ℃, the butenes selectivity decreased from 99% to 90%, and the 1,3-butadiene conversion increased from 82% to 100%. In particular, the selectivity of 1-butene at 35 ℃ was significantly lower than that of 50 ℃ (66.7%~36.9%). This is due to the relatively higher temperature will promote the 1-butene to undergo either the isomerization to 2-butenes or over-hydrogenation to butane [32]. The results indicate that the selectivity of butenes over the Pd-Ag/ES catalyst was greatly dependent on the reaction temperature. Therefore, the optimal reaction temperature was determined to be 45 ℃ to avoid deep hydrogenation of butenes (conversion of 95% and butenes selectivity of 95.8%). The durability over the Pd-Ag/ES (Pd/Ag = 4:1) was evaluated for more than 30 h at 45 °C (Fig. 5(d)). As can be seen, the conversion of 1,3-butadiene decreased slightly (95%~90%) while the butenes selectivity remained steady (95.8%), suggesting an excellent durability of the Pd-Ag/ES catalyst. Furthermore, the excellent performance of the ES supported catalyst is comparable to the relatively more expensive Pd/graphene catalyst prepared via atomic layer deposition (conversion of 95%, butenes selectivity of 99%, 50 ℃) [33]. Furthermore, the butenes selectivity is also higher than other bimetallic catalysts reported in the literature (Table 1 ), such as Pd-Ag/Al2O3 catalyst (conversion of 100%, butenes selectivity of 84.9%, 35 ℃) [28]. Hence, these comparisons have demonstrated the potential of ES as a low cost, yet excellent support for the application of selective hydrogenation of alkadienes."
11,Structure-activity relationships of the Pd-Ag/ES catalysts,"3.3 Structure-activity relationships of the Pd-Ag/ES catalysts It was reported that the supports modified by sulfonic groups will greatly improve the butenes selectivity of Pd based catalysts [32]. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that upon removal of the shell membrane (sulfonic groups), the butenes selectivity of Pd-Ag/ES-no was found to decrease to 85% while the conversion increased to 100%. The phenomenon can be attributed to the electron-deficient character of Pd NPs, as the change of electronic properties of Pd may affect the adsorption of species on the surface of particles. This is in agreement with the conclusion of Bachiller et al., whereby sulfonic group was indeed beneficial to the improvement of butenes selectivity, but at the cost of a certain reduction in 1,3-butadiene conversion [6]. In addition, the Pd-Ag/com-CaCO3 has lower 1,3-butadiene conversion (~61%) and butenes selectivity (~83%) than those of the Pd-Ag/ES (conversion 95%, selectivity 95.8%), and the 1,3-butadiene conversion is also lower than Pd-Ag/ES-no. Both catalysts were prepared by the sol-immobilization method by loading the metal NPs onto ES. The abundant lattice defects and hierarchical porous structures of ES make the dispersibility of metallic NPs on the ES or ES-no better than that of com-CaCO3, resulting in excellent catalytic activity. Therefore, the dispersion of metal NPs will directly affect the catalytic performance. Moreover, the sulfonic groups of ES also increased the butenes selectivity by changing the electronic properties of Pd NPs. Again, the results revealed that the sulfonic group plays an important role in the 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation. Furthermore, we performed the DFT calculations to explore the mechanism of sulfonic groups underlying the 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation reaction. Because Pd and Ag are reduced separately, they are distributed discretely on the eggshell, so they are not tightly combined. Herein, only the interaction between Pd and the sulfonic group is considered in the simulation calculation. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), after optimizing the structure of the Pd surface, two sulfonic groups were adsorbed on it through the Pd-S bond, simulating the electrophilic group in the ES. The optimized Pd structure and the Pd structure with sulfonic groups were labeled as pure-Pd and S-Pd, respectively. Firstly, in order to qualitatively observe to change of the electronic structure of Pd due to the effect of sulfonic groups, we performed the Bader charge calculation. As shown in Fig. 8 , the two sulfonic groups will capture 0.58 electrons from Pd, resulting in a positive valence on the metal surface. When there is no sulfonic group on the surface, the electronic structure of Pd stays unchanged, showing zero valence. The calculated results are well consistent with the conclusion of XPS analysis as the change of electronic properties of Pd NPs is indeed caused by sulfonic groups. Fig. 7 (b-c) illustrate the 1,3-butadiene adsorption sites on (b) pure-Pd, (c) S-Pd 1,3-butadiene adsorption. This is one of the key steps in catalytic hydrogenation to identify the catalyst property. It has been suggested that the conversion of hydrogenation is related to the desorption of 1,3-butadiene [15]. As for the case of pure-Pd, all the four carbon atoms in 1,3-butadiene form bonds with Pd atoms and have low adsorption energy, accounting for −1.68 eV. However, due to the existence of the sulfonic group, S-Pd shows a relatively higher value of adsorption energy, at −1.08 eV (Fig. 8). The calculation results showed that the adsorption of 1,3-butadiene on S-Pd is weaker compared to that of pure-Pd. By combining it with the Bader charge difference calculation data, the positively charged Pd will adsorb 1,3-butadiene weaker due to the influence of the sulfonic group. Similarly, the adsorption behaviors of three butenes products on the Pd surface were also performed. As shown in Fig. 9, the adsorption energy of 1-butene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene on the pure-Pd and S-Pd show the same trend as that of 1,3-butadiene, which decreased about 0.21, 0.2, and 0.21 eV, respectively. This led to the conclusion that the presence of sulfonic groups would also weaken the adsorption of butenes on the surface of Pd particles. As is well known, rate-determining step of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation is the isomerization and deep hydrogenation of 1-butene [10]. It has been proven that the electron-deficient Pd is not conductive to acticating H2 and alkenes [38], whereby the changes in the electronic properties of Pd may inhibited this step to some extent. More importantly, the weaker adsorptions of butenes are beneficial to improve the selectivity of the Pd-Ag/ES catalyst as weaker adsorption of the butenes will limit further hydrogenation [29]. Furthermore, in situ DRIFTS was used to study the effect of sulfonic groups on the adsorption energy of Pd NPs to 1,3-butadiene and their reaction intermediates. As shown in Fig. 10 , the IR bands at 1810 and 1824 cm−1 belong to the overtone of =CH2 wag [39]. The IR bands at 1601 and 1583 cm−1 are attributed to C = C stretching vibrations [40]. The IR bands at 1390 and 1368 cm−1 can be assigned to the symmetrical deformation vibration of C–H bond in methyl [41]. In addition, the IR band at 903 cm−1 belongs to the external bending vibration of C–H [42]. These IR bands indicate the presence of 1,3-butadiene and butenes. As shown in Fig. 10(a), when the temperature was increased to 55 ℃, the characteristic peaks of alkenes on the Pd-Ag/ES sample were disappeared, which means 1,3-butadiene and butenes were desorbed. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 10(b), the characteristic peaks of the alkenes still existed over Pd-Ag/ES-no at 55 ℃, which did not obviously disappear until 65 ℃. The experimental results indicate that when sulfonic groups are present on the ES, the adsorption of alkenes over Pd particles was indeed weaken. The result is consistent with the DFT calculations, which verified that the sulfonic groups significantly affected the adsorption alkenes over Pd NPs. Therefore, 1,3-butadiene and the reaction intermediates could be more easily desorbed on Pd, thus avoiding the deep hydrogenation. Obviously, the weaker adsorption of 1,3-butadiene is unfavorable for the conversion of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation, while the weaker adsorption of butenes is beneficial for the butenes selectivity."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, waste eggshell was utilized as a scaffold to design and prepare the highly efficient catalysts for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation. The Ag component did not serve as an active center but it was used to dilute the density of Pd NPs on the ES support and the resultant Pd-Ag/ES catalyst exhibited a high 1,3-butadiene conversion of 95% and the butenes selectivity of 95.8%. Through series of characterizations, it was confirmed that the ES not only has abundant surface folds and hierarchical porous structures to facilitate the dispersion of metallic NPs, but also has stronger electronic interactions with Pd and Ag NPs via the inherent sulfonic groups. According to the results of in situ DRIFTS, XPS studies, and DFT calculations, it was found that the electron transfer process between sulfonic groups and Pd NPs effectively reduced the adsorption energy of butenes and 1,3-butadiene over the Pd surface. This led to the enhanced butenes selectivity, performing better than many reported developed catalysts for the same application. Therefore, this study has expanded and pioneered the application of waste ES into selective hydrogenation of alkadienes. In this way, utilization of the available waste eggshell as a natural modified support for fabricating supported catalysts is of great significance to green chemistry and sustainable development."
