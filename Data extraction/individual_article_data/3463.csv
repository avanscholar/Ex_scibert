0,Introduction,"Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) for liquid alcohols like methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol as fuels to generate power for portable energy conversion devices, have attracted great attention due to their low toxicity, high energy density, renewability and abundant supply [1–3]. In the past few decades, platinum has been considered as the best catalyst for alcohol oxidation in nature. However, its high cost, rare amounts and low catalytic stability severely limit the large-scale practical applications in DAFCs [4]. In recent years, many different types of Pt-based nanocrystals have been designed with improved activity by control their size, shape, structure, and composition, which aims at enabling enhanced electrocatalytic activity and reducing cost in alcohol oxidation [5,6]. An effective method is devoted to the development of bimetallic nanostructures that are composed of Pt with another transition metal. This design not only reduces the demand of Pt, but also maintains the high catalytic activity and stability [7–10]. Nowadays, many bimetallic Pt catalysts, such as Pt-Ni [8], PtPb/Pt/Ni [11], have been studied, aiming to replace pure Pt catalysts. These bimetallic catalysts can enhance the catalytic activity as compared with monometal, which is owing to the suitable electron coupling and their synergistic effect [8–12]. Especially, since Pd has similar lattice constant and high chemical stability to Pt, PtPd bimetallic nanocrystals have been endowed into an increasingly significant research area for various applications such as fuel cell electrodes, chemical and biological sensors [13–16]. For example, dumbbell-like PtPd alloy-Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized for electrocatalytic reduction and real-time quantitative detection of H2O2 in biological environment [13]. Ultra-small PtPd alloyed NPs were anchored on three-dimensional nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide hydrogels for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [14]. Such nanocatalysts showed the significantly enhanced catalytic performance relative to commercial Pt/C towards the HER, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxidation of alcohols [15,16]. However, the challenges associated with their large-scale production and high tolerance to CO poisoning still need to be explored in the oxidation of multiple liquid alcohols. For heterogeneous catalysts, a high-quality carbon support has been considered as a good strategy to maximize the catalytic performance because it can provide high specific surface area, high chemical stability and has desirable metal-support interactions [17]. Among various carbon materials, hollow N-doped carbon spheres (HNCSs) as a superior support have received considerable attention due to electronic and geometric effects. Their defective C-N sites as the active center can promote the nucleation and growth of metal NPs. With the improvement of the metal-support interactions [18,19], it is beneficial to the hybridization of p orbitals of N and d orbitals of transition metals. Recently, many efforts have been made on the conversion of polydopamine (PDA) to a special category of carbon, nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphitized carbon [20–22]. PDA is a mussel adhesive-inspired biomimetic synthetic polymer via in situ polymerization of dopamine with good affinity to almost any solid surface [23]. The graphitization of carbon benefits hierarchical pore structure and high N contents to promote the transport process of electrolyte ions and increase electrochemical performance [24]. In this work, mesoporous HNCSs have been designed for the dispersion of flowerlike PtPd alloyed NPs by using silica as the sacrificial template with the coating of PDA and subsequent pyrolysis. Flowerlike PtPd NPs were synthesized by simultaneously reducing Na2PdCl4 and H2PtCl6 with L-ascorbic acid (AA) in an aqueous solution. And the atomic ratio of Pt and Pd could be tuned by simply varying the concentrations of the Pt and Pd precursors. Benefited from multiple structural and com-positional merits, PtPd/HNCSs (2 wt.%) exhibited remarkably enhanced electrochemical activity and stability toward the oxidation of liquid alcohols including methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol (EG), as compared to commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%)."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Dopamine hydrochloride, 98% and L (+)-Ascorbic acid (AA) was purchased from Macklin (Shanghai, China). Ammonium hydroxide (NH3•H2O), hexachloroplatinic acide hexahydrate (H2PtCl6•6H2O), sodium tetrachloropalladate (Na2PdCl4) were purchased from Energy Chemical Factory (Shanghai, China). The commercial Pt/C power (20 wt. % Pt on Vulcan XC-72) was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Tech Co. All the chemicals were analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Water used in all experiments was purified using a Millipore Q system."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL Inc., Japan), using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (HRTEM/SAED) were performed on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30, FEI, USA) with an acceleration voltage of 150 kV. The elemental distribution of the samples was measured on an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The samples for TEM measurements were prepared by placing a drop of the as-prepared solution on carbon-coated copper grids. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an XRD Riga kuD/max-2400 analyzer (Cu K-Alpha radiation, λ = 0.1541 nm) with the 2θ range from 10° to 90°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI 6000 spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (Thermo Scientific). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) and porosity characteristics analysis were determined from N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms measured using Micromeritics ASAP-2020 at liquid nitrogen temperature. Raman spectrum was measured by a Renishaw Raman microscope under λ = 785 nm laser excitation. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was tested on a NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal analyzer under air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10°C /min from 25 to 800°C All electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, China). The conventional three-electrode system was used with GCE as a working electrode (a diameter of 3 mm), saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode and graphite rod (~length 3 cm) as a counter electrode. In particular, 1 mg catalyst was dispersed in 1 ml water, 300 μL of 0.05 wt. % Nafion solution for 30 min. 10 μL of the suspension was put on the GCE surface uniformly. For CO-stripping experiments, CO was used to saturate a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution for 30 min, holding the working electrode at -0.14 V vs. SCE. The remaining CO in the electrolyte was thoroughly purged with high purity N2 gas for 15 min."
4,Preparation of PdPt/HNCSs nanocomposites,"2.3 Preparation of PdPt/HNCSs nanocomposites The preparation process of PdPt/HNCSs nanocomposites is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, hollow N-doped carbon spheres (HNCSs) were prepared by a facile step according to a previously reported method [25]. In a typical experiment, 1 mL aqueous ammonia solution (25–28%) was added to a mixed solution of 80 mL water and 24 mL ethanol under continuous stirring for 40 min. Then, 1 mL of a tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) solution was added dropwise to the mixture under stirring for 20 min. After that, 0.4 g dopamine was dissolved in 20 mL water and slowly added dropwise to the above mixed solution. The resulting solution was stirred for 36 h. The obtained product was centrifuged, washed with ultrapure water and ethanol, and dried at 70°C. The prepared material was carbonized by calcination at 800°C for 3 h under N2. Finally, HNCSs were obtained via the dissolution and removal of silica with a 10% HF solution. Generally, 0.1 g HNCSs was firstly dispersed in 80 mL water under sonication. Then, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6•6H2O (1.96 mL 3.86 mmol/L) and Na2PdCl4 (1 mL 2.5 mmol/L) with appropriate amount was added to the above HNCSs solution. Finally, 0.5 mL AA (0.1 mol/L) was quickly added under stirring. The product was collected and then washed three times with water, continuous washing/centrifugation with ethanol. The collected product was dried at 50°C. The total amount of H2PtCl6 and Na2PdCl4 was 0.01 mmol, and the metal loading percentage was kept at about 2 wt.%. The molar ratios of H2PtCl6 and Na2PdCl4 were adjusted at 1/0, 5/1, 3/1 and 1/1. These samples were named as Pt/HNCSs, Pt5Pd1/HNCSs, Pt3Pd1/HNCSs, and Pt1Pd1/HNCSs, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of PtPd/HNCSs composite,"3.1 Characterization of PtPd/HNCSs composite HNCSs were firstly synthesized by using silica as template with a PDA coating, subsequent carbonization at 800°C and removal of silica. The representative SEM (Fig. 1 A) and TEM (Fig. 1B) images show the microstructure of the prepared HNCSs, where a three-dimensional spherical structure is observed with the diameter of about 280 nm and many pores appear on the surface. The TEM image illustrates the hollow spherical morphology with the carbon shell of 18.6 nm. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of HNCSs (Fig. 1C) show the type-IV curves with sharp capillary condensation step and H2-type hysteresis loop, indicating the formation of mesoporous structure [26]. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plot (Fig. 1D) illustrates that the pore size distribution is uniform. From the BET parameters, the HNCSs has 850 m2 g−1 of specific surface area, 0.03 cm3 g−1 of pore volume and 4.5 nm of pore size. The high specific surface area will be beneficial to accelerate the diffusion and mass transport rate of reactants on the HNCSs support [27]. The PtPd alloyed NPs loaded on the surface of HNCSs were synthesized via one-pot synthetic strategy using ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. For monometallic Pt or PtPd alloys with different atomic ratios were prepared by changing the amount of H2PtCl6 and Na2PdCl4 during the synthesis procedure. Flowerlike nanostructures supported on the surface of HNCSs are clearly observed which are composed of many elongated NPs (Fig. S1). Their HRTEM images (Fig. S1) indicate that all PtPd nanostructures exhibit an alloyed structure. Their crystal lattice has about 0.23 nm of lattice fringes for all PtPd alloys and monometallic Pt, being assigned to the (111) crystal plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline structure. The formation of the flowerlike nanostructures could be attributed to two points: First, the N-doping carbon can provide active sites to promote the nucleation of metal NPs. The similar cases have been reported, such as the deposition of Pt [28] and Au [29] flowerlike nanostructures on a PDA layer with amine groups. Secondly, the relative rates for atom deposition (Vdepo) and surface diffusion (Vdiff) are critical to the growth of metal NPs [30]. The Pt (IV) and Pd (II) precursor was supposed to be reduced immediately on its introduction into the growth solution in the presence of a relatively strong reducing agent of ascorbic acid. This can lead to quick diffusion of deposited metal NPs to the edges and side faces, thus forming a flowerlike nanostructure [17]. Their alloyed nanostructures were further confirmed by XRD. Fig. 2 A shows the XRD patterns of the HNCSs support with bimetallic and monometallic NPs. For pure the HNCSs support, a typical diffraction peak (002) of graphite carbon locates at 2θ = 25° [23]. For either PtPd alloys or pure Pt, each pattern contains (111), (200), (220), and (311) faces, which demonstrates a fcc structure feature. It is noted that each face only contains a single peak irrespective of a single metal or a bimetallic system. The lattice constant (d) values can be calculated according to Vegard's law [31]. It is found that the d values of PtPd bimetallic systems linearly increase with the increase of Pt molar ratio (Table S1 and Fig. 2B). The results also indicate the alloy feature of PtPd NPs. Fig. 2C shows the Raman spectra of the HNCSs support without or with PtPd loading. The D and G bands can be seen, which verifies the graphitized structure [23]. When PtPd NPs are loaded on the support, the positions of the D and G bands do not shift. To give the detailed structure information of PtPd alloys, we selected Pt3Pd1/HNCSs as the typical sample, in which the Pt/Pd mole ratio was 3/1. From the TEM images (Fig. 3 A), it is found that the flowerlike nanostructures are composed of many small NPs. The size of small NPs is about 2.2 nm. Fig. 3B shows the HRTEM image of an individual Pt3Pd1 NP. The lattice fringe with inter planar spacing of 0.230 nm is clearly observed, assigned to the (111) plane of the fcc crystal structure [32]. EDX spectrum (Fig. 3C) confirms that Pt3Pd1 NPs are successfully loaded on the HNCSs support, where the C, O, N, Pd, and Pt elements could be found. The EDX mapping of Pt3Pd1/HNCSs was carried out to reveal the dispersion of these elements (Figs. 3D-I). The EDX mappings of C and N show the hollow carbon shell structure. The EDX mappings of Pd and Pt prove that they only present in the PtPd NPs. From the HAADF-STEM image of Pd, Pt elements (Fig. 3I), Pt and Pd are homogeneously alloyed. Furthermore, according to EDX analysis, the molar ratios of Pd/Pt in the samples are close to those in the electrolyte for all Pt-Pd systems (Table S1). The chemical states of Pt3Pd1/HNCSs were determined by XPS [33]. In the XPS spectrum (Fig. 4 A), there are the elements of C, O, N, Pd and Pt. The slight asymmetric C 1s spectrum (Fig. 4B) demonstrates a typical feature for N-doped carbon materials [34], which can be deconvoluted to C-C (284.9 eV), C-O/C-N (286.6 eV) and C=O (289.0 eV). The N 1s spectrum (Fig. 4C) can be fitted to a majority of pyrrolic N (400.0 eV), pyridinic N (398.6 eV), quaternar N (401.1 eV) and pyridinnic N-O (403.3 eV), evidencing the N-doping after the carbonization of PDA [35]. Fig. 4D shows the high-resolution Pd 3d spectra exhibiting one set of metallic Pd and another set of Pd2+, in which distinct Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 peaks at 335.3 and 340.6 eV (respectively) can be classified as metallic Pd, while the BEs at 337.0 and 341.2 eV are assigned to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd2+. Through peak fitting, the peaks of Pt contain the domination of Pt (0) and minor Pt (II). In Fig. 4E, the Pt 4f peak occurs a positive shift about 0.2 eV compared with pure Pt (0). The positive shift of Pt 4f in BEs can be attributed to a down-shift of Pt d-band center with respect to the Fermi level [36]. This down-shift of Pt d-band center will skew the results in favor of improving the electronic effect of Pt in electrocatalysis [36]. Furthermore, the loading amount of PtPd alloys was analyzed by TGA. Fig. S2 shows the TGA curve of Pt3Pd1/HNCSs in the range of 25°C to 800°C at a rate of 10 °C/min under air atmosphere. A small weight loss appears at the stage of 25–120°C, which is due to the evaporation of some contained water in the catalyst. Then, a rapid decline of weight loss occurs at the temperature of 400 to 500°C, which can be attributed to the combustion of carbon with air. After 550°C, the quality keeps almost unchanged. On top of that (800°C), the residual weight is only 1.89 wt.%. That means that the loading amount of PtPd alloys is 1.89 wt.% in the Pt3Pd1/HNCSs."
7,Electrochemical activity for the oxidation of liquid alcohols,"3.2 Electrochemical activity for the oxidation of liquid alcohols The oxidation of liquid alcohols is a class of significant half reactions for the development of DAFCs to generate renewable power [37]. The electrocatalytic properties of PtPd/HNCSs were measured in acidic media among Pt/HNCSs, Pt1Pd1/HNCSs, Pt3Pd1/HNCSs, Pt5Pd1/HNCSs and commercial Pt/C (20 wt. %) catalysts. Fig. 5 A shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of different catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 for calculating the electrochemical surface area (ECSAH) values. For Pt-based catalysts, the typical hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks as well as the monolayer oxide (PtOx) reduction peaks in the cathodic sweep can be observed. The ECSAH values can be determined by the charge concerning H+ adsorption, QH [28], and are listed in Table 1 . The detailed calculation method can be seen in the Supporting Information. For PtPd alloys, the increase of the Pt content can bring higher ECSAH. For pure Pt loading (Pt/HNCSs), its ECSAH (74.2 m2 g−1) is even lower than that of Pt1Pd1/HNCSs (131.1 m2 g−1). Also, the PtPd samples (about 2 wt. % PtPd loading) hold higher ECSAH values than commercial Pt/C (20 wt. % Pt loading). Obviously, the synergistic effect of between Pd and Pt is one important factor; another is the large specific surface area and mesoporous structure of the HNCSs support. The CO-stripping voltammetry is a useful tool to evaluate the anti-poisoning ability of the catalyst since the intermediate CO-like species are always generated during the DAFCs process [38,39]. Fig. 5B shows the CO stripping voltammograms for CO oxidation in 0.5 M H2SO4 over the above catalysts. From the CO stripping voltammograms, the parameters like electrochemically active surface area (ECSACO), COads stripping peak current (I f, CO) and potential (E f, CO) can be obtained and these data are listed in Table 1. The calculation of ECSACO can be seen in the Supporting Information. We find that the ECSACO and I f, CO increase with the Pt loading amount. Pt5Pd1/HNCSs has the highest ECSACO and I f, CO values among the above catalysts, which is agreed with the ECSAH results. However, we notice that Pt3Pd1/HNCSs has the lowest E f, CO in all PtPd samples. The lower E f, CO means the stronger anti-poisoning ability [38]. So, we select Pt3Pd1/HNCSs as the typical sample to access the kinetic parameters and electrochemical long-term stability. Next, the electrocatalytic activities of MOR, EOR and EGOR were studied in 0.5 M H2SO4 containing methanol, ethanol and EG, respectively. The corresponding CVs are shown in Figs. 5C–E. For the three kinds of liquid alcohols, all the CVs have a strong peak in the forward sweep and a weak peak in the reverse sweep, corresponding to the oxidation of alcohols and the removal of surface adsorbed intermediates generated during the oxidation of alcohols, respectively. We obtain the same results with the ECSAH and ECSACO: Pt5Pd1/HNCSs possesses the highest current densities for MOR, EOR or EGOR, as shown in Table 2 . For example, the forward scanning peak current (I f) of Pt5Pd1/HNCSs is 1.78, 2.56 and 4.92 times as high as Pt1Pd1/HNCSs, Pt/HNCSs and commercial Pt/C catalyst for MOR. The parameters like I f/I b and E onset (onset potential) also suggest that Pt5Pd1/HNCSs has the excellent activity. For EOR and EGOR, the similar improvement has been made for PtPd alloyed systems compared to Pt/C. Distinctly, the 3D hollow carbon spheres with large pore volume are much more beneficial for the mass transfer of large mass alcohols. Moreover, in the absence of Pd, the catalyst (Pt/HNCSs) has lower mass current densities for alcohol oxidation than Pt1Pd1/HNCSs, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of between Pd and Pt. It is well known that EOR and EGOR have much higher energy densities than MOR [6,40]. So, it is expected that PtPd alloy/HNCSs exhibits a promising potential for the high energy fuel cells."
8,Kinetic study and electrocatalytic stability,"3.3 Kinetic study and electrocatalytic stability The kinetics of MOR, EOR and EGOR over Pt3Pd1/HNCSs were studied by using CV. The CVs at different scan rates were recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4 with methanol, ethanol and EG (Figs. 6 A–C). Figs. 6D–F show the relationships of between peak current density (I p) and square root of scan rate (ν1/2). All the relationships exhibit good linearity, indicating the typical diffusion-controlled process for MOR, EOR and EGOR [40]. Meantime, it can be found that the peak potential (E p) values at Pt3Pd1/HNCSs rise linearly with log (ν) for MOR, EOR and EGOR (Figs. 6G–I). This infers that all the oxidation processes of methanol, ethanol and EG are irreversible. Chronoamperometric method is usually used to evaluate the electrocatalytic stability of the catalyst [41,42]. In Figs. 7 A–C, Pt3Pd1/HNCSs and commercial Pt/C demonstrate the similar chronoamperometric curves for MOR, EOR and EGOR, where the current densities decrease gradually in the initial time and then the steady-state current densities keep stable in the next period. The gradual decrease is due to the unavoidable accumulation of poisoning species on active sites [3,43], whereas the steady-state current densities indicates a good catalytic stability. Nonetheless, Pt3Pd1/HNCSs always reserves much higher residual currents after 1500 s than that of Pt/C for MOR, EOR and EGOR (Table S2). Also, the residual currents after 1500 s for EOR and EGOR are still higher than that for MOR which further highlights the unique advantages of Pt3Pd1/HNCSs for the applications in the high energy fuel cells. The catalytic stability was further tested by successive CV scanning [28]. Figs. 7D–F show the CVs of Pt3Pd1/HNCSs in 0.5 M H2SO4 with methanol, ethanol and EG. We can get the relationship of normalized current densities and cycle number, as shown in Figs. 7G–I. It can be found that Pt3Pd1/HNCSs catalyst keeps good stability for MOR, EOR and EGOR. The normalized current densities after 200 cycles retain about 77.8%, 88.9% and 93.9% of the initial cycle in MOR, EOR and EGOR, respectively. It is noted that the catalytic stability of the as-prepared Pt3Pd1/HNCSs is much better than those of Pt(Cluster)-PDA/RGO [28], Pt-RGO [28], PtRu-PVP-GNFH [44], CNTs/ionic liquid/Pt [45], CNT/Pt [46], and polyaniline/Pt [47], in which the current density decays at a much faster rate. For example, Pt (Cluster)-PDA/RGO [28], Pt-RGO [28], and three-dimensional (3D) Pt-on-Pd bimetallic nanodendrites supported on graphene [48] retained less than 65% compared to the maximum peak current after 200 cycles for MOR. The normalized current density in this work is compatible to that of carbon riveted PtRu/C [49] catalyst (about 80%) for MOR within 200 cycles. Similarly, the as-prepared Pt3Pd1/HNCSs held superior catalytic stability in EOR to Pd1Ptx alloy NPs on graphene aerogel/nickel foam [50], Pd/CNTs [51], and Pd/CNTs-NH2@SnO2 [51]. Our normalized current density in EGOR after 200 cycles is better than those of commercial Pt/C (only 40%) [52] and PtBi chain-typed nanoflowers (less than 70%) [52]. This study on catalytic stability further highlights the structural and compositional advantages including the synergistic effect of Pt and Pd, good dispersion of PtPd NPs and large specific surface area and mesoporous structure of HNCSs."
9,Conclusions,"A PDA-assisted synthesis approach was developed to fabricate hollow N-doped carbon spheres with large specific surface area and mesoporous structure for supporting flowerlike PtPd alloy NPs. The PtPd/HNCSs material was characterized with SEM, TEM, HRTEM, SAED, XPS, XRD, Raman and BET method. Compared with commercial Pt/C (20 wt. %), the PtPd/HNCSs (only 2 wt. %) had higher catalytic activity, stability and better tolerance against CO poisoning for the electrooxidation of multiple liquid alcohols (MOR, EOR, and EGOR). Kinetic study showed the electro-oxidation of liquid alcohols over the PtPd/HNCSs was proved to be diffusion-controlled and irreversible. These results indicate that the PtPd/HNCSs catalyst will be promised to explore other practical applications in fuel cells with high energy density."
