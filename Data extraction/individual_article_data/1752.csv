0,Introduction,"The major reason to be considered as driving force to look for alternative energy resources is environmental pollution. By igniting fossil fuels, several environmental complications like global warming, polluted air, acid rain, ozone layer exhaustion and excessive cut down of forests. Among the renewable energy resources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, hydrogen & nuclear and biomass have evolved as potential alternatives to fossil fuels. Biomass and farm produced materials have been used as alternative energy sources and the use of biodiesel is growing increasingly now. This is due to its great contribution to the environment and to its role as a strategic source of renewable energy in substitution to diesel oil and other petroleum based fuel [1]. Instability of many export sources has led to increased prices of fossil fuels and its by-products. Also the CO2 which is devastating cause of environmental destruction produced by combustion of fossil fuels has led to serious consideration of biofuel usage [2]. The consciousness of cleaner production technology is increasing globally. The need for an alternative to fossil fuels has engendered extensive research in recent years. Fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy which generate pollutants and are linked to global warming, climate change and even some incurable diseases. The impending challenges and the environmental implications of fossil fuels have been reviewed widely in the literature [3]. National bio diesel board formerly as National Soy diesel Development Board of United States introduced biodiesel in 1992 which boasted to have lesser exhaust emissions as compared to petroleum diesel and also was renewable and biodegradable in nature. It reduces the level of pollution causing agents in environment [4]. Biodiesel depends on crops that are compliant to a regional climate. For example in United States, major feedstock to produce biodiesel has been soybean oil. On the other hand, Europe has mostly preferred rapeseed (canola) oil and palm oil. A suitable source to produce Biodiesel should not competent with other applications that rise prices, for example pharmaceutical raw materials. But the requirement for pharmaceutical raw material is lower than for fuel resources. Biodiesel source that has low production cost but higher production quantity is supposed to be the best feedstock. Taking refined oil as example, production cost is on higher side but production scale is lower. In contrast to it, non-edible oil seeds, algae, sewerage have equally opposite criterion for feedstock production [5]. Transesterificaion reaction is the conventional method used to prepare biodiesel in which a monohydric alcohol and a catalyst chemically split the tri-glycerides to form alkyl esters. High viscosity is lowered to a value similar to that of D-2 while cetane number and heating value are saved through transesterification [6]. Till date most of the researchers have opted for methanol as alcohols in transesterification reaction. Methanol is derived from fossil resources, so biodiesel produced cannot be termed as renewable completely. To have completely renewable biodiesel, alcohols must be derived from bio-based resources. Ethanol, Butanol and Petanol are the alcohols of this type. In this paper, attempt has been made to investigate the impact of different higher alcohols on biodiesel production, yield and fuel quality of biodiesel."
1,Feedstocks used for biodiesel production,"In available literature there are numerous feedstocks reported which can be used to produce biodiesel. Among them, soybean, palm, sunflower, rapeseed and peanut oils have been considered in earlier times but their negative impact on food crops have hindered their usage. The selection of raw material mainly depends upon the availability and cost. European communities for example are self-dependent in production of edible oil with surplus to export. As a result edible oils such as rapeseed is commonly used in European Nations׳ biodiesel. In America, soybeans are commonly used. Similarly, countries with coastal areas such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have surplus palm, coconut oils which are used for biodiesel. In Brazil, the mostly used oils are soybean, castor and palm kernel. In India, Jatropha and Karanja have been reported to be as prominent sources for biodiesel production [7]. Table 1 depicts the number of vegetable oil which can be potential source for biodiesel production. As it is seen, there are numerous non-edible oils which hold an advantage over edible oils of being not used in food crops. Using edible oils for biodiesel production in longer term will hamper the food crops and their conventional uses. This may lead to scarcity of food products. Moving further, there are some emerging feedstocks like micro-algae, animal fats, fish oil, beef tallow oil etc. which can be utilised to produce biodiesel on large scale. Fig. 1 shows the production capacity of some vegetable oil. It is observed that Waste Cooking oil in China is quite prominent source of biodiesel whereas India is rich in Jatropha and Karanja Oil. Similarly Palm, Coconut and Rubber Seed Oils are in other Asian Countries."
2,Edible oils (1st generation),"2.1 Edible oils (1st generation) These oils are normally obtained from food crops and vegetable oils. Food crops like rice, wheat, potato wastes and sugarcane etc. have been used in past to produce alternative fuels. To a larger extent, first generation oils are derived from edible vegetable oils such as soybean oil sunflower oil, corn oil, olive oil, palm oil, coconut oil, rapeseed oil, mustard oil, castor oil. In addition to it, these oils face social, economic and environmental challenges because these are derived from food crop feedstocks. Their use leads to increased food prices and also creates pressure on land use which makes it unlikely to be sustainable [8]."
3,Non-edible oils (2nd generation),"2.2 Non-edible oils (2nd generation) Second generation oils are mainly non-edible oils derived from variety of feedstocks including lignocellulosicfeedstocks and non-food crops. These oils mainly include Karanja, Jatropha curcas, Polanga, Linseed, Moringa oleifera, Croton megalocarpus, Jojoba, Chinese tallow etc. The advantage of using non-edible oils is that these don’t have unnecessary burden on food crops in comparison of first generation oils [8]."
4,Other sources (3rd generation),"2.3 Other sources (3rd generation) These sources include microalgal biomass, animal fats, waste cooking oil, Chicken fat, fish oil, Spirulina platensis algae, Pig Fat Oil etc. Microalgae have some notable merits over other feedstocks like low-cost culturing, high yield energy, and environment friendly and renewable nature. It can be grown in undeveloped land and water which is not suitable for food production, therefore reducing the strain on already depleted water sources [8]. Algae have the greatest yield to give oil per unit area of land compared to other conventional feedstocks. Algae has very rapid growth. It can grow in different kinds of environment and even in saline or brackish water [18]. Microalgae has high levels of lipids proportion mainly more than 30 percent oftotal content. One of the prerequisites for the economical use and an efficient conversion of algae is high level of biomass content. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration is the most widely used indicator of algal biomass. Popular ways for biofuel production from micro-algae include transesterification reaction with alcohol, hydro-refining, catalytic selective oxidation. With use of these processes, algae can be transformed to liquid fuels, bioethanol and biodiesel [19]."
5,Composition of vegetable oils,"2.4 Composition of vegetable oils The fatty acid composition of different feedstocks are enlisted in Table 2 and indicates that Oleic acid holds major proportion in unsaturated fatty acids like in Moringa seed oil (72.6%), Moroccan frying oil (51.6%), Pangium edule Reinw (45.2%), Simarouba (54.6%), Moringa peregeria (71.09%), Moringa olifera (72.1%), Acrocomia aculeata (macaúba) (53.4%), Waste salmon (36.4%) whereas in Egusi seed oil, lenolenic acid is more (61.41%). Similarly in saturated fatty acids, stearic acid has major proportion."
6,Stability and cold flow properties,
7,Oxidation stability,"3.1 Oxidation stability The oxidation stability of fats, oils and their products plays an important role in determining the quality and so is an important parameter for quality assessment of fats and oils and biodiesels derived from them. Unsaturated components and double bond leads to oxidation due to increase reactivity with oxygen present in atmosphere which results in poor stability. This cause complications in long term storage of biodiesel. The oil and fats with high unsaturation are more susceptible to radical attack a sa first step of oxidation. Therefore an understanding of fuel stability requires the knowledge of chemical composition of biodiesel and its parent׳s oil/fat. The oxidation of fatty acid is related to the degree of double bond which can be correlated to the reduced oxidation stability of the fuel and so, the fuel in stability is directly proportional to the number of double bonds. Generally, the polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18:2, linoleic acid; C18:3, linolenic acid) are vulnerable to oxidation than fatty acid having single bond [43]. The oxidation stability can be measured by Oil Stability Index or Oxidation Stability Index (OSI). The OSI method is based on determining the time usually, called induction period (IP) and is widely used in fats and oil industries. OSI is a function of two type of position equivalent w.r.t. to double bond Allylic Position equivalent (APE) and Bis Allylic Position Equivalent (BAPE). An Allylic Position equivalent (APE) group consist of methylene (–CH2–) attached to a vinyl group (–CH=CH2). An Allylic carbon is a carbon atom bonded to a carbon atom that, in turn, is doubly bonded to another carbon atom. Bis Allylic Position Equivalent (BAPE) is given by hydrogen atom bonded to same carbon atom that are in allylic position w.r.t. to two different C=C double bonds i.e. =CH–CH2–CH=. 3.1.1 Theoretical calculation of OSI Chemically the stability of SVO can be theoretically measured using APE and BAPE in triglyceride molecule. Following equations [43] can be used to calculate APE and BAPE which further can be used to determine OSI. (1) APE=2 * (% Oleic acid+% Linoleic acid+% Linolenic acid) (2) BAPE=% Linoleic acid+(2 * % Linolenic acid) (3) OSI = 3.91 – ( 0.045 * BAPE ) Based on the above equations, APE, BAPE and OSI values for different vegetable feedstocks have been calculated and then depicted in Table 3. As given in table, it is observed that OSI value is minimum for Cannabis sativa>Egusi>Aphanamixis>Croton megalocarpus>Camelina sativa oil which determines that these have least potential for biodiesel production and worse in oxidation stability parameters. On the other hand, Moringa olifera, Moroccan frying oil, Schleichera oleosa L. oil, Moringa peregeria have good prospects as potential feedstocks as per their good characteristics in oxidation stability. The Variation of OSI and BAPE is shown in Fig. 2, which suggests that as the BAPE for given oil/fat increases, OSI also drops down that is as the proportion of BAPE goes up, oilbecomes more susceptible to oxidation stability. From above discussion, it is recommended that, oil having least BAPE must be used for biodiesel production citing their good oxidation stability."
8,Cold flow properties,"3.2 Cold flow properties The SVOs under cold climatic condition may lead to its condensation and gel formation resulting in the crystallisation of fuel particles in liquid fuel due to strong intermolecular interaction below their melting point. Inferior cold flow properties may cause clogging of fuel pipes and pump leading to improper engine operation. As the temperature drops down, more solid is formed and oil achieves the pour point which is the minimum temperature at which it will not be ableflow. The cold flow properties are explained in terms of Cloud Point (CP), Pour Point (PP), and Cold filter plugging Point (CFPP). 3.2.1 Cloud point Cloud point (CP) is the temperature at which solid crystals are observed when the fuel cools. Formation of wax at certain temperature defines the cloud point of oil. The presence of solidified wax thickens the oil, and it clogs to fuel filters and injectors in engines. CP can be predicted based on its fatty acid composition with Eq. (4) as given below [43]. (4) CP = 1.44 * % Saturated fatty acids - 24 . 8 Fig. 3 shows the trend of Cloud Point with % Saturated fatty acid as calculated from above equation. As the proportion of saturated fatty acids grows in feedstock, cloud point also rises. This suggests that, oils having more saturation will have poor cloud point thus having complications while operated in engine. 3.2.2 Pour point Pour point (PP) is the lowest temperature at which the fuel suffers from gel formation and attains semi-solid state and becomes deprived of its flow ability, which makes it no longer pumpable. 3.2.3 Cold filter plugging point (CFPP) It is the minimum temperature at which a liquid fuel is able to pass through a standard filtration deviceina certain time, when temperature is dropped down subjected to cooling under certain conditions. This measures the lowest temperature at which a fuel gives trouble free flow in a fuel system. It is very important for cold climatic countries, where high CFPP clog up the vehicle engines more easily. CFPP is determined by the following equation: (5) CFPP = 0.8537 * CP – 4.72 Fig. 4 explains the variation of CFPP with unsaturated content in oils or fats. As seen, with increase in unsaturation, CFPP follows a declining trend. It is observed that for colder regions, oil used must having more unsaturation in composition because it results in superior CFPP."
9,Biodiesel production by transesterification reaction,
10,Homogeneous catalysis,"4.1 Homogeneous catalysis Most common type of transesterification used for biodiesel production is Homogeneous Catalysed Reaction. Both acid and base have been used in literature as a catalyst. Acidic and alkaline constitute to two principle types of transesterification reaction. Main aim is to transform fatty acid components of raw materials into tri-glycerides. By-products obtained must be removed off otherwise yield gets lower by significant factor. Most regularly used acidic catalyst used is sulphuric acid (H2SO4) whereas sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) have been used in base catalysed reactions. NaOH and KOH have been preferred due to following reasons: 1. Ability to speed up the reaction at lower temperature and pressure. 2. Higher yield can be attained in lesser time. 3. Availability in abundance and cheaper in cost. The FFA and moisture content of oil have substantial impact on the transesterification of triglycerides with alcohols in presence of catalyst. It is reported that, alkali catalysts can be used only if vegetable feedstocks have free fatty acid composition as low as possible (0.5% or maximum up to 1% by weight) [44]. Higher FFA proportion (>1%) in oil or fat, during alkali catalysed transesterification, causes emergence of soap which in turn makes is strenuous to separate biodiesel, thus lowering the actual amount of biodiesel obtained. It is seen that activity of acid catalyst is slower in comparison to Basic catalyst. Moreover, even higher temperature doesnot speed up the reaction for acid catalysts. Mostly catalysts having acidic nature are used for vegetable oils containing FFA greater than 6% [5,46–49]. Generally, quantity of catalyst used for transesterification reaction is in between 0.5wt% and 5wt% as reported in literature with mostly H2SO4. Other, alkali catalysts used include alkoxides of alkali metals, such as CH3ONa, CH3OK, and so on. These catalysts have been utilised not only along with methanol but also with ethanol for biodiesel production [50,63]. Fig. 5 shows the schematic diagram of Homogenous Catalysed Transesterifcation. Raw materials (oil or fat) in highly pure form are fed into a reactor which contains a stirrer. Alcohol and catalyst are mixed into it in required proportion calculated as per the FFA composition of feedstock. The reaction is carried out for about 60–120min and for 70–80 °C temperature as reported in literature [5,6,43–53,56]. The temperature and molar ratio depends upon the alcohol used. Compared to methanol, reaction takes a bit more time when ethanol is used as alcohol. Also, separation is more strenuous in case of ethanol usage in contrast to methanol as emulsion formed is very strong. Short chain alcohols does not mix easily with tri-glycerides at normal temperature so to increase the mass transfer [50,53]. Table 4 shows the summary of different production parameters for homogenous catalysed transesterification reaction along with use of different alcohols. It is observed that most of the studies used base catalysts (KOH or NaOH) with molar ratio ranging from 3:1 to 9:1. This depends mainly on composition of vegetable oil. The optimised temperature is approximately 60min whereas reaction time falls in range of 60 to 120min. Selection of alcohol also effects the production parameters and yield obtained. As seen from the above table as the higher alcohols are used, yield reported tends to lower down. This may be due to higher viscosity. In the current scenario, there are some studies which report the application of higher alcohols for production of biodiesel and their impact on fuel properties. Nonetheless, these experiments cannot be compared directly because of the difference of reaction conditions during production of fatty acid alkyl ester and used raw material [63]. Some merits and demerits of this type are explained in Table 5."
11,Heterogeneous catalysis,"4.2 Heterogeneous catalysis Homogeneous reaction faces complications like soap formation and waste water which leads to lesser yield and is economically is not viable. The crucial disadvantage of homogeneous catalyst like KOH and NaOH is that these absorb moisture from air and are unsafe environmentallyin contrast to the heterogeneous catalyst. Although use of heterogeneous catalysts doesn’t speed up the reaction and time taken is longer but biodiesel production cost is not higher as catalyst is recovered and can be used again and again [59]. In heterogeneous catalysts, prominent ones are magnesium oxide (MgO), calcium oxide (CaO), barium oxide (BaO), strontium oxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, mixed oxides catalysts and hydrotalcites [59]. MgO, CaO, SrO and BaO are quite popular. Calcium oxide is being adopted as it is available in abundance and cheaper cost. It is also obtained from waste eggshells with calcination. Calero et al. [69] used 7% CaO by weight as catalyst to prepare biodiesel from sunflower oil with in presence of methanol and achieved conversion of nearly about 100% when reaction was carried at 65°C with molar ratio of 6:1. In a similar case, Ferrero et al. [70] used CaO and found out that approximately 83% of yield was obtained from soybean oil. Heterogeneous acid catalyst have no relation with FFA content of raw material and able to perform esterification and transesterification reaction simultaneously [71]. Fig. 6 explains the typical schematic used for heterogeneous catalysed transesterification reaction. Faroorq et al. [73] reported that in the case of heterogeneous reaction, the mixture includes three phases: alcohol,oil and catalyst. This results in diffusion resistance among different phases leading to lesser yield. Thus, optimum reaction temperature is required to overpower the diffusion resistance for better conversion. Among heterogeneous catalysts, base catalysts have been used initially due to their good activity and stability but for complete conversion into tri-glycerides these required higher reaction temperature. Therefore, solid catalyst with stable activity, which are able to produce biodiesel in lesser time even on normal temperature and pressure, is useful for industrial applications. Therefore metal doped catalysts like TiO2–MgO, SO2− 4/ZrO2/SiO2. Heteropolyacid have been emerged as potential alternatives to conventional catalysts [74–76]. Table 6 lists about the reaction conditions used for biodiesel production from different vegetable oils with help for heterogeneous catalysts. One major thing that can be noted down is reaction temperature which is normally higher in comparison to homogeneous reaction. Heterogeneous catalytic transesterification process can tolerate extreme reaction conditions. The temperature in heterogeneous catalytic reaction could go from 60°C to as high as 200°C to obtain about 90% of yield while in homogeneous reaction, some authors have done reaction at even 30°C [72,74,75]. Li et al. [72] made use of Mg2CoAl (a mixed catalyst obtained from Mg–Co–Al–La layered double hydroxide) to produce biodiesel with help of Canola oil. Keeping temperature as 200°C and molar ratio in range of 7:1–16:1, they were able to get yield up to 95%. Size of catalyst particles also played significant role in yield of biodiesel. Particles having size lesser than 100µm tend to produce more biodiesel initially but later on the process stabilised. On the other hand, particles having size greater than 1mm initially had lesser yield but achiever more conversion rate as the reaction proceeded. A reduction in conversion rate with particle size indicates internal diffusion control. Heteropoly acids possess very strong Bronsted acidity, being more reactive in comparison to conventional acids like H2SO4, Al2O3–SiO2, zeolites and acidic resins. The acid sites in HPAs are more uniform and easier to control than those in other acid catalysts. Hence HPAs frequently exhibit superior catalytic activity in acid-catalysed reactions, including transesterification in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Zhang et al. [76] prepared catalyst (Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40) with use of heteropoly acid obtained yield of 96.22% in presence of methanol having molar ratio 12:1. Mew merits and de-merits of using heterogeneous catalytic reaction are enlisted in Table 7."
12,Enzyme based catalysis,"4.3 Enzyme based catalysis Excessive wastewater and strenuous glycerol separation lead to higher cost for biodiesel production. In comparison to it, enzyme catalysts do not lead to any by-products andseparation of products is much easier. There is no impact of higher FFA content on reaction applicability and catalysts can be reused also. Enzymes are generally effective biocatalyst for having substrate specificity, functional group specificity and stereo specificity in aqueous media. Besides, chemical reactions can be also raised directly using lipase in an organic media [44,60]. The esterification reaction of alcohol and carboxylic acid is difficult in aqueous media, whereas this reaction takes place easily in organic solvent. The main hindrance towards adoption of this process is higher generation cost of biodiesel as catalyst is not cheaper. In order to use the enzyme catalyst repeatedly, the process of immobilisation must be carried out using appropriate method [78–80]. Pure lipase or lipase supported catalyst system are a recentlygrowing field of research for biodiesel production. Enzymecatalysis on transesterification of renewable oil is safe and cleanwithout by-products [81,82]. Table 8 delineates the production parameters for enzyme catalytic transesterification reaction. Adachi et al. [78] achieved yield of 94% with biodiesel prepared from brown rice feedstock. Liu et al. [82] made use of different biocatalysts (Novozym 435, Lipozyme TLIM and Lipozyme RMIM) and several monohydric alcohols like methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol) and observed conversion of more than 80%. Similar results were obtained by Lopez et al. [83] for micro-algae biodiesel. It is also observed that for enzyme based catalyst reaction temperature needed is lower among all types as maximum observed is 45°C and lower molar ratio in range of 4:1–7.5:1."
13,Super critical process,"4.4 Super critical process Catalytic process mainly consists of transesterification reaction, recovery of glycerol and catalysts, purifying the biodiesel, separation of by-products from biodiesel. Therefore, catalytic processes are not economic in nature and require larger amount of energy. Moreover, due to lesser miscibility of oils and alcohols, excessive stirring is needed to mix the both [86].The application of acidic or alkali catalyst also leads to complex process and, thus, super-critical process has an edge over other conventional techniques due to no usage of catalyst. In addition to it, the transformation of oilinto biodiesel is achieved more rapidly in supercritical alcohols. Comparatively, this process does not requires any external agent (catalyst) & is not affected by presence of water and free fatty acids. Supercriticalfluids (SCFs) are fluids above their criticaltemperature and pressure with gas like diffusivities andliquid like viscosities. Transesterification with help of supercritical alcohols is supposed to be superior due to good enhanced diffusion rates thus completing reaction in shorter period [87]. This process enables simultaneous transesterification of triglycerides and ethyl esterification of fatty acids in a lesser time and requires low energy due to simplified separation and purification steps [88]. Table 9 shows the summary of process conditions of super critical transesterification reaction. It is seen that in comparison to other process, supercritical reactions require higher process conditions (20:1–45:1 alcohol to oil ratio, 200–350°C temperature, and 100–200bar pressure). Madras et al. [87] produced biodiesel from non-edible oils in super critical conditions attained yield in range of 80–90% when temperature was kept at 300°C and higher molar ratio of 50:1. There are some studies which reported completion of reaction in shorter period of time (~10min) and yield obtained was still very much significant [92–94,97,99]. Rodríguez-Guerrer et al. [98] obtained yield of 98.9% for castor biodiesel keeping temperature in range of 200–350°C. Equilibrium was achieved after 30min."
14,Modern technologies for biodiesel production,"4.5 Modern technologies for biodiesel production Along with some conventional methods of producing biodiesel with transesterification reaction, there are some new technologies emerging out. Cubas et al. [100] made use of corona discharge plasma technology to produce biodiesel from food industry waste products and verified the results with Gas Chromatography to ensure possibility of biodiesel production. Reaction conditions used were molar ratio of 6:1 and reaction time of 25°C for 110min. The biodiesel obtained had acid value 0.43mgKOH/g. Ultrasound irradiation and microwave methods have been employed to accelerate the reaction rates of enzymatic reactionsfor biodiesel production. The activity of Novozym 435 was enhanced under the conditions of ultrasonic assistant and a conversion of 95% was achieved in 50min. According to the authors, ultrasonic energy reduced the adsorption of glycerol by-product on the surface of the immobilized lipase. Sometimes ultrasonication is used with other methods to improve the enzymatic transesterification process. Some facts are summarised about modern technologies in Table 10. Some researchers have made use of two-step process in enzyme catalytic transesterification in which initially hydro-esterification is done by hydrolysing the glycerides to FFAs and glycerol followed by esterification of FFAs.Membrane reactor technology has been successfully applied to many chemical reaction processes. The transesterification of lipids is a classic reversible chemical reaction that could also be combined with membrane reactor technology. The membrane can be either organic in nature (i.e. polymeric) or inorganic. Cao et al. [102] made use of four carbon membranes of different pore sizes viz. 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.4µm to produce biodiesel from Canola Oil. Results concluded that biodiesel obtained was rich in purity. Reactive distillation is a valuable process intensification technique that can be applied successfully to the production of biodiesel since the reactions leading to the end-product are controlled by the chemical equilibrium. This is highly advantageous in esterification-type processes, when the feed has a high content of free fatty acids [100]. In a similar way, Xu et al. [105] obtained yield of 91.7% on using fixed-bed membrane reactor to produce soybean biodiesel in presence of Ca–Mg–Al hydrotalcite/honey-comb ceramic monolithic catalyst."
15,Factors affecting biodiesel production,
16,Effect of temperature,"5.1 Effect of temperature The temperature at which reaction conducted has significant impact over rate of reaction. Using higher reaction temperature can diminish the viscosity of the oil which results in enhanced reaction rate. It is said that, there action temperature must be lower than the boiling point of the alcohol to make sure that alcohol does not get vaporised. If higher reaction temperature is used unnecessarily, yield drops down due to soap formation. On the other hand, Sánchez et al. [57] figured out something contradictorythat conducting reaction withhigher temperature, better conversion is obtained for all tested alcohols. But using methanol or ethanol for biodiesel production, didn’t face any significant effect on yield whereas n-butanol and 2-propanol were more sensitive to temperature and catalyst percent changes, respectively."
17,Effect of molar ratio,"5.2 Effect of molar ratio The alcohol to oil ratio is a chief criterion as it controls the phase of reacting system whether system is one or two phase. It is reported in literature that, on decreasing the molar ratio, system approaches single phase system from two phase. Zanuttini et al. [61] studied kinetics of esterification of Butia Yatay coconut oil and based on many preliminary experiments, alcohol to oil ratio was between 7:1 and 12:1 and only single phased mixture was obtained. Centrifugation was done to enhance the separation of products. Generally, fatty acids and esters settle down and other matter like alcohol and glycerol gets separted and lies in upper phase. The resulted biodiesel had acid values ranged in 109 and 140mg KOH/g. Yin et al. [62] suggested that, larger the alcohol:oil ratio, reaction achieves its equilibrium in lesser time. They observed that the more yield was obtained with molar ratio under 7:1 but as it was kept above this value, declining trend in yield was observed. Excessive alcohol doesnot help in yield rather, it results in unnecessary rise in cost of process because recovery becomes difficult. The best molar for maximum yield ranges between 6:1 and 9:1 but some authors also reported using alcohol in range of 3:1–20:1M ratio depending upon oil used and other reaction conditions [64]."
18,Effect of catalyst concentration,"5.3 Effect of catalyst concentration Sanli et al. [7] experimented with different catalysts and observed that performance of KOH in comparison to NaOH is better for sooner conversion and optimum amount of catalyst in 1.0% by weight. Using more catalyst than optimum value did not have any notable impact on yield or properties of biodiesel. When NaOH is utilised as a catalyst, amount must be taken care of, because excessive amount will result in formation of gel. Other alcohols apart from methanol should be used with an acid catalyst in spite of their reaction rates being too low. Sánchez et al. [57] kept catalyst concentration in range of 0.6–1.2wt%. For best yield of biodiesel, optimum value of catalyst is 1.2wt%. A higher concentration in the catalyst resulted in reducing the fatty acid butyl ester conversion due to secondary reactions."
19,Effect of stirring,"5.4 Effect of stirring There are basically four different methods used to stir the components in transesterification reaction. Yin et al. [62] compared the different methods of stirring to improve the yield of biodiesel. The reported methods are: i. Mechanical stirring (MS). ii. Flat plate ultrasonic irradiation (FPUI). iii. Flat plate ultrasonic irradiation with mechanical stirring (UIMS). iv. Probe ultrasonic irradiation (PUI). After reviewing the literature, following comparison for process conditions can be drawn out which are listed in Table 11. The results showed that, under the same condition, UIMS and PUI used less catalyst, less methanol, shorter time and less energy consumption than MS and FPUI when the biodiesel conversion was the same. At the same catalyst concentration, the sequence of biodiesel conversion from high to low was PUI, UIMS, FPUI and MS. As per the literature, effective stirring rate was around 100rpm."
20,Effect of alcohol type,"5.5 Effect of alcohol type The effect of higher alcohols on yield and properties of biodiesel have not been studied in deeper extent. Very less literature is reported about impact of higher alcohols. Bouaid et al. [48] produced biodiesel from used frying oil and rapeseed oil in presence of biobutanol. It was concluded that, using biobutanol as alcohol improves the cold flow properties in terms of cloud point (CP), pour point (PP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). There is no major impact on other fuel properties of biodiesel. Oxidation stabilities of produced fuels were also in good terms. Oliveira et al. [52] concluded that after 100min of reaction time, yield eventually comes out to be same irrespective of alcohol used among methanol and ethanol. This gives an advantage of using ethanol as it is obtained from biomass, which makes it renewable and biodegradable, whereas methanol is normally obtained from fossil sources. Malins et al. [54] also observed improvement in cold flow properties in rapeseed biodiesel prepared with butan-2-ol. Sanchez et al. [57] compared properties of biodiesel prepared with different alcohols and concluded that Methanol gave highest yield while 2-propanol was worst. Cetane number for FABE was >90. Flash point decreased for 2-propanol. Likozar et al. [63] did experimentation with different alcohols to produce biodiesel from various edible oils. As far as reaction kinetics are concerned, tert-butanol, isopropanol, Methanol, ethanol and butanol exhibit a decreasing initial conversion rate to alkyl esters. The length of the linear aliphatic chain in alcohol negatively influences the conversion to alkyl ester in equilibrium, which was corroborated in the literature with conversions decreasing upon methanol, ethanol and butanol use, respectively. A lower conversion in equilibrium when using isopropanol versus methanol agrees with presented results, but low efficiency of tert-butanol is may be due to biocatalysis. When using ethanol in place methanol, it is suggested to have excess proportion so that more yield is obtained and reaction takes lesser time to achieve equilibrium. Moreover, certain quantity of ethanol needed to break glycerol–fatty acid bonds, but in controlled manner otherwise crossing the limiting value, separation will be strenuous [64,65]. The most popular are methanol and ethanol, but additional higher alcohols like 1-propanol, n-butanol, butan-2-ol, iso-propanol are also used, where it was obtained that these branched-chain esters reduced the biodiesel crystallisation temperature [69]. Comparison of biodiesel produced through transesterification reaction by using several higher alcohols is done in Fig. 7 which shows that for most of cases a certain declining trend in yield is followed as number of carbon atoms are increased. But some researchers have reported that there is improvement of cold flow properties on using butan-2-ol [57]. Methanol is generally applicable on industrial level because of its lower cost. But, the notable point is the methanol is non-renewable as mainly it is acquired from fossil fuel resources like natural gas thus biodiesel prepared with help of methanol cannot be termed as renewable in nature. Therefore, use of ethanol is quite promising because it is derived from agricultural wastes for instance biomass via fermentation technique. Apart from that, ethanol is more soluble in oil compared to methanol and therefore minimises mass transfer limitation during transesterification reaction [71]."
21,Conclusion,"In earlier times, to a greater extent, biodiesel was being prepared from edible oils. However, using edible oils for fuel production is not encouraged due to negative impact on food purposes. Therefore, focus has shifted to look for new generation oils obtained from several resources which minimal primary usage. There is scope various non-edible and third generation feedstocks for biodiesel production. These oils have also shown promising fuel properties and biodiesel obtained has comparable engine operation with petroleum diesel. There are different unconventional techniques reported to produce biodiesel but still conventional techniques are being executed. Prominent new technologie scan help out reducing the energy consumption for whole process making it cheaper and environmental friendly. There is ascopeto enhance fuel properties of biodiesel. Oxidation stability mainly depends upon unsaturation content of feedstock used. Cannabis sativa, Egusi, Aphanamixis, Croton megalocarpus, Camelina sativa oil have poor stability characteristics. Moringa olifera, Moroccan frying oil, Schleichera oleosa L. oil and Moringa peregeria have reported to be better in terms of oxidation stability. As far as cold flow properties are concerned, it is subjective according to regional climate conditions and mainly depend on degree of saturation. As the proportion of saturated fatty acids is lowered, CP and CFPP improves. Some research has been done to identify the effect of higher alcohols on biodiesel properties and improvement in cold flow properties has been noticed. There is scope in using higher alcohols for biodiesel production and their impact on fuel properties of biodiesel and its lubricity properties and scope of improvisations in already existing technologies to obtain higher yield and lesser time for attaining equilibrium."
