0,Introduction,"Biodiesel can be obtained from a number of feedstocks and it can be classified into four categories according to the raw material used to produce it. First generation biodiesel comprehends edible oils as soybean oil, coconut oil, rapeseed oil, palm oil, etc. In the XIX century, Rudolf Diesel used Peanut oil to run its first compression ignition engines and for many years biodiesel production has used edible oils as its main raw material [1]. Nevertheless, this kind of feedstock interferes with food resources; therefore, research has focused on new raw materials that are equal to or more efficient than those previously mentioned. Second generation biodiesel is obtained from non-edible oils, Jatropha C. oil is the most commonly used, followed by Rubber seed oil and Karanja oil among others. However, this feedstock also has a negative influence in the societal economy since it uses farming lands that could be used for food production. Third generation biodiesel is often referred as having two different raw materials. The first is algae oil, which can be cultivated in large quantities in smaller places than sources from first and second-generation biodiesel. Algae oil disadvantage is that it has issues to develop larger crops, presents difficulties for the oil extraction and it also requires a larger investment. The second potential raw material source for third generation biodiesel is fat, oil, and grease (FOG) with different free fatty acids (FFA) content (yellow grease and brown grease) [2], in particular waste oils (yellow grease containing less than 15% FFAs). However, a disadvantage of using waste oils to produce biodiesel is their heterogeneity since they require a more complex processing to reach higher biodiesel yields due to the oils mixture in their composition. Waste cooking oils (WCO) contain also degradation products from oxidation, hydrolysis and polymerization as reported by Ramos et al. [3]. There is also the presence of other organic residues and compounds such as water depending on their source. Fourth generation biodiesel feedstock includes photobiological solar fuels and electro-fuels which produce biodiesel based on synthetic biology technologies [4]. One of the most economical raw materials for producing biodiesel is waste cooking oils since it is three times cheaper than virgin oils and it is considered a third generation biodiesel feedstock [5]. Furthermore, there is a further advantage of using WCO as feedstock to produce biodiesel since its use reduces water pollution generated by its poor disposal [6]. In addition it is environmentally friendly since processing WCO prevents bad odors, pests, and alterations in wildlife [7,8]. As mentioned earlier, the main disadvantage of WCO for biodiesel production is that it needs an extra processing. For example, when WCO is converted to biodiesel by solution transesterification with an alkaline homogeneous catalyst such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH), the high level of FFA and water would generate saponification which in turn decrease methyl esters (biodiesel) yield [9]. In order to improve WCO's transesterification yield, homogeneous acid catalysts such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4) are used for esterification and transesterification of both FFA and triglycerides. However, this homogeneous catalytic process has several disadvantages such as deactivation of active sites by the presence of water in the raw material and high-water waste for reactor neutralization. There are also increasing reagents and byproducts elimination costs and the consumption of a non-reusable catalyst. Recently, Litinas et al. reported a novel approach to overcome the high-FFA issue, which consist in the use of a reactor containing ferromagnetic iron particles subjected to an oscillating electromagnetic field and an acid pre-treatment of high-FFA oil prior to transesterification [10]. The results indicated that this technology could efficiently reduce high FFA levels of up to around 9% to acceptable levels (less than 2 wt%) even at room temperature and within a very short reaction time (60 s). Moreover, in order to find the most efficient biodiesel system and optimize its design and operating conditions, machine learning (ML) technology has been employed as a powerful tool to model the nonlinearities and complexities of biodiesel systems such as microwave-assisted, mechanically-assisted, ultrasound-assisted, supercritical alcohol, and enzyme-catalyzed transesterification processes [11]. Recently, heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed to solve some of the problems found in WCO transesterification by homogeneous catalysts without sacrificing biodiesel yield. Particularly interesting are solid acid catalyst since they are insensitive to FFA content, do not need a neutralizing process, and are easily removable from the reaction medium [12]. Among heterogenous catalysts polymeric membranes are reported as a suitable replacement for homogeneous liquid acid catalysts such as sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. The membranes act as a fixed reaction site for the acid groups that effect the transesterification process to produce methyl esters. In this context, catalytic polymeric membranes preparation techniques along with different supports or active sites can affect the composition and biodiesel yield [13]. For example, a water-soluble matrix such as Nafion, agarose or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) makes them prone to absorb polar solvents such as alcohols that used for the transesterification reaction [14,15]. The acid groups in the membrane can be strong or weak acid groups, such as carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, which may be deposited or embedded into a dense or porous matrix [16,17]. A number membranes bearing acid groups have a water-soluble matrix which makes them prone to absorb polar solvents such as alcohols used in the transesterification reaction. It is also important to notice that water, which is a byproduct from transesterification, can act as poison to the membrane active sites and decrease their catalytic capacity. According to Shu et al. [18] a increasing number of active sites can be available for transesterification in the catalytic membrane if a hydrophobic matrix is used to carry the acid groups. Biodiesel production from WCO has been already reported, and some yields reach methyl esters conversion between 86 and 99% [19], although several of them needed strong reaction conditions. For example, Issariyakul et al. [20] used a two stage homogeneous acid and alkali catalyzed WCO transesterification and reached 97% ethyl ester conversion. Zheng et al. [21] reached a 99% methyl ester waste cooking oil conversion using an homogeneous acid catalyst with a 254:1:3.8 methanol:oil:acid molar ratio. Ullah et al. [22] used an acid sulfonated functionalized ionic liquid to catalyze WCO transesterification and they were able to reach a 78.13% yield with a methanol:oil ratio 12:1 at 120 °C using 4 wt% catalyst. In order to reach higher yield, they performed a two-step reaction with potassium hydroxide (KOH), as a second catalyst, at the same conditions, which increased biodiesel conversion to 94.52%. Zhang J. et al. prepare a polyphenylene sulfide (PPhS) heterogenous acid catalytic membrane for transesterification of oleic acid which yielded 95% conversion after 35 min [23]. Aca-Aca et al. reported a catalytic membrane from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) crosslinked with sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) for soybean oil transesterification that yielded 92% biodiesel conversion [14]. Corzo-Gonzalez et al. made a catalytic membrane from a blend of PVA and poly(2-acrylamido-2-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS), (PVA/PAMPS 70/30) crosslinked with succinic acid (SA) that reached a 97% soybean oil conversion [24]. A catalytic membrane prepared from graphene oxide (GO) in a polyether sulfone (PES) matrix was reported for Tian et al. [25]. They found the best catalytic performance with a 1:5 (GO:PES) membrane annealed at 150 °C that reached an 85% oleic oil conversion and lasted at least six cycles. (Table 1) summarize some recent reports on biodiesel production from different oils by acid heterogeneous catalytic membranes. The target of this work was to test biodiesel production from WCO catalyzed by polyphenylsulfone (PPS) and sulfonated polyphenylsulfone (S-PPS) blend membranes (PPS:S-PPS). Kim et al. [26] report that S-PPS can reach similar acid ion-exchange values as the ones used in membrane-catalyzed transesterification; however, sulfonated polyphenylsulfone has not been reported as catalyst for biodiesel production. PPS:S-PPS catalytic membranes were characterized by their ion-exchange capacity, swelling degree and swelling control by crosslinking. Also, PPS:S-PPS membrane lost matter when they are exposed to methanol and waste cooking oil were considered in order to choose the most suitable membrane for the transesterification reaction. WCO employed was characterized according to its iodine value, moisture and triglycerides content. Once a PPS:S-PPS membrane with the best balance of Ion Exchange Capacity (IEC), methanol swelling and weight lost was identified, a transesterification reaction to methyl esters (biodiesel) was performed to evaluate its potential to carry out WCO conversion to biodiesel which has the advantage of low cost and the elimination of a harmful waste."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Polyphenylsulfone sulfonation,"2.1 Polyphenylsulfone sulfonation Polyphenylsulfone (Radel™) (PPS) was dissolved at room temperature in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) for 24 h on a three-neck round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirring. Next, a trimethylsilyl cholosulfonate (TMSClS) in TCE sulfonating solution was added dropwise using an addition funnel under a nitrogen atmosphere. Different concentrations of TMSClS, as indicated in (Table 2 ) were used in order to obtain different sulfonation degrees. The reaction was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. The reaction scheme is given in Fig. 1 . After 48 h, the solution was precipitated in 500 mL of a 1:1 acetone-isopropanol solution. The polymer was collected by filtration and it was washed out on a 1:1 acetone-isopropanol solution. Finally, it was dried on a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 24 h [27]. PPS final sulfonation degree (SD) was determined by titration with a 0.1 M NaOH solution. In order to determine SD, 0.5 g of sulfonated polyphenylsulfone from each reaction was dissolved in dimethylformamide. SD was calculated according to Equation (1): (1) S D ( % ) = M W ∗ ( M N a O H ) ∗ ( V N a O H ) w s a m p l e ∗ 1000 − ( 81 ∗ ( M N a O H ) ∗ ( V N a O H ) ) ∗ 100 where S D is the sulfonation degree, M W is the molecular weight of the polymer repeating unit, M N a O H is the molarity of the titrating solution, V N a O H is the titrating solution volume consumed in the titration and w s a m p l e is the weight of the dry sample [27]."
3,Membrane preparation,"2.2 Membrane preparation Dense membranes, MD 1 to MD 6, were prepared by slow solvent evaporation using different relations between PPS and S-PPS as indicated in (Table 3). A casting solution containing 13 wt% of total polymer dissolved in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) was stirred for 12 h. Once all the polymer was dissolved, it was filtered and the membrane was cast on a glass plate at 70 °C to complete solvent evaporation. Finally, the membrane was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 24 h. The membrane formulation MD 6 has a PPS:S-PPS relationship that was adjusted in order to reach the same sulfonic groups content that those on membrane MD 3; nevertheless, this sulfonic groups content has to be corroborated by the characterization results. 2.2.1 Ion exchange capacity The available sulfonic groups were quantified by titration. The membranes were dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Then, 0.1 g of membrane was immersed on 15 mL of 1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution for 24 h; after this time, all samples were extracted and the remaining solution was titrated with 0.1 N, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, and the IEC was calculated according to Equation (2): (2) I E C = C N a O H ∗ V N a O H m d where I E C is the Ion Exchange Capacity, C N a O H is the NaOH solution concentration, V N a O H is the NaOH solution volume consumed during titration and m d is the mass of dried membrane before immersion. 2.2.2 Membrane crosslinking In order to decrease membrane weight loss during the transesterification reaction, the membranes were crosslinked on a vacuum oven at 180 °C. Kim and Ghil [28] mentioned that a crosslinking reaction occurs between sulfonic groups in the sulfonated polymer; therefore the crosslinking degree can be followed by titration, according to Equation (3): (3) D C = I E C b − I E C a I E C b where D C is the crosslinking degree, I E C b is the ion exchange capacity before crosslinking and I E C a is the ion exchange capacity after crosslinking. 2.2.3 Swelling and weight loss In order to determine the PPS:S-PPS membranes stability towards the transesterification reactants, swelling percentage and weight loss experiments were carried out. PPS:S-PPS membranes were dried at 100 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. Then, 1 × 1 cm PPS:S-PPS membrane samples were cut and weighted. Each membrane sample was immersed in a vial with 5 mL of methanol or wasted cooking oil and they were kept at 60 °C. Next, the PPS:S-PPS membrane samples were extracted and dried with a filter paper, weighted and their weight recorded every 24 h until they reach constant weight. The swelling percentage and weight loss were calculated from Equations (4) and (5): (4) Q = m h − m s h m s h ∗ 100 (5) W L = m s − m s h m s ∗ 100 where Q is the swelling percentage, m h is the mass of swollen sample, m s h is the mass of the dry sample after swelling and dried under vacuum, m s is the mass of the dry simple prior to swelling and W L is the membrane weight loss [14]."
4,Oil characterization,"2.3 Oil characterization 2.3.1 Moisture content According to Odoom et al. [29] WCO moisture can be measured gravimetrically. At least three 2 g WCO samples were placed on petri dishes previously dried and weighed; afterwards, they were heated in a convection oven at 104 °C for 4 h. In the next step, WCO samples were cooled down on a desiccator and they were weighted again. WCO moisture content was obtained from Equation (6): (6) M o i s t u r e ( % ) = ( W C + W S ) − ( W C + D S ) W S x 100 where W C is the weight of the Petri dish, W S is the weight of the wet sample and D S is the weight of the dry sample. 2.3.2 Iodine value According to Guillen and Ruiz [30] olefinic hydrogen atoms can be used to determining the iodine value, comparing their signal in the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H1 NMR) spectrum with the total signal of the oil sample through Equation (7): (7) I V = 12691 F ( 120.0 + 7.013 T + 6.006 F ) where I V is the iodine value, F is the integration of the olefinic hydrogen atoms signal at 5.40–5.26 ppm and T is the total integration of the 1H NMR spectrum. 2.3.3 Triglycerides content Following a procedure outlined by Kumar et al. [31], triglycerides in WCO are measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H1-NMR). Triglycerides are calculated by integrating the proton signals of the –OCH2- groups corresponding to the glyceride part and the total spectra integration using Equations (8)–(10): (8) T G ( % ) = I O S I O R ∗ 100 where T G (%) is the triglycerides percentage, I O S is the corresponding percentage of the –OCH2- group protons given by: (9) I O S = I f I T ∗ 100 where I f is the integrating value of the –OCH2- group at 4.10–4.40 ppm and I T , is the integrating value of the total spectra from 0.5 to 9.0 ppm. I O R is given by the relationship between the –OCH2- protons of the glyceryl group and those of the average alkyl chain, that Kumar et al. [31] considered as C-18 with one double bond. Therefore, the total number of protons in the triglyceride appearing in the region 0.5–9.0 ppm are taken as 104 and the –OCH2- group protons of the glyceride are considered 4. (10) I O R = 4 104 ∗ 100 = 3.85 Samples were prepared dissolving a drop of waste cooking oil in deuterated chloroform, CDCl3."
5,Catalytic reaction experiments,"2.4 Catalytic reaction experiments Transesterification reactions were performed on vials. The reaction conditions were a 5:60 WCO:methanol ratio and 7 wt% catalytic membrane with respect to the waste cooking oil feed. Temperature was set at 60 °C. PPS:S-PPS catalytic membranes were cut into small pieces in order to promote the contact between membrane and reactants. PPS:S-PPS membranes were initially left to swell in methanol for 24 h before starting the transesterification reaction. After this time, waste cooking oil was added and samples for reaction conversion to methyl esters determination were periodically taken off and stored at 4 °C to stop the reaction. 2.4.1 Methyl ester yield determination According to Aca-Aca et al. [14] methodology, methyl ester yield can be measured by H1-NMR. Samples for reaction conversion were taken off from the reaction vessel and washed with distillated water at 50 °C. To eliminate oil from the samples, they were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. From the centrifugated sample a drop of the supernatant was dissolved on deuterated chloroform. To calculate methyl ester yield, methoxy groups (–OCH3–) signal at 3.7 ppm and α-methylene groups (–CH2-) signal at 2.3 ppm were integrated. The conversion percentage was calculated according to Equation (11): (11) Y % = 100 ∗ ( 2 A 1 3 A 2 ) where Y ( % ) is the methyl ester yield, A 1 is the integration of the methoxy signal and A 2 is the integration of the α-methylene signal."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Sulfonation degree, ion exchange capacity and crosslinking degree","3.1 Sulfonation degree, ion exchange capacity and crosslinking degree Three different sulfonation degrees were obtained from the sulfonation methodology used for S-PPS preparation. Depending on sulfonation degree, amber to dark brown solutions of S-PPS in TCE were obtained. The comparison between the theoretical sulfonation degree and the experimental one obtained is shown in (Table 4 ). Experimental determined SD values for the S-PPS remained within 32–66% SD range close to the theoretical sulfonation value. Each S-PPS obtained was used to produce membranes with the as is sulfonated polymer or blended with 30 wt% of non-sulfonated PPS (membranes MD 1 to MD 6). IEC and Dc were established experimentally for each membrane and the results are shown in (Table 5 ). Theoretical IEC values were calculate using the SD in (Table 4). MD 1 and 2 show low IEC values that indicate a dilution of the sulfonic (–HSO3) groups within the membrane matrix, thus the crosslinking of these membranes was not attempted. IECb of non-crosslinked membranes MD 3 to MD 6 shows similar values to those reported for transesterification catalytic reaction in a range between 0.79 and 1.42 meq/g of membrane [14,24]. After crosslinking, IEC values decreased around 12% for all membranes indicating the connection of two rings by the interaction of the sulfonic acid groups with phenyl groups [28], also all membranes became dark regardless Dc value as shown in Fig. 2 . On the other hand, MD 6 does not show an IEC decrease, thus the experimental results indicate that this particular membrane cannot be considered crosslinked. Overall, the results indicate that the membranes with the best availability of acid groups for a transesterification reaction are MD 3, MD 5 and MD 6 which present the largest IEC after crosslinking (IECa). However, the membrane stability in the presence of reactants is also important for a successful transesterification reaction. 3.1.1 Swelling degree and weight loss Figs. 3–5 show swelling degree and weight loss values for MD 1 to MD 6 membranes. It can be seen that the crosslinking by annealing increased membrane stability when they swell in the presence of methanol, see Fig. 3. Membrane crosslinking also decreases data dispersion. It is clear that crosslinking of sulfonic groups by thermal annealing imparts stability to S-PPS membranes. In fact, MD 5, which is prepared from S-PPS-56, totally dissolves in methanol because it has a high sulfonic group content. On the other hand, membranes made from PPS:S-PPS blends, MD 2, MD 4 and MD 6, diminish considerably their swelling degree in methanol in comparison to those not blended prepared with 100% S-PPS after crosslinking. All membranes present less than 6% swelling degree in waste cooking oil (WCO) as is shown in Fig. 4. This result indicates that the oil cannot get into the membrane matrix easily; therefore, in order to carry out the transesterification reaction, a previous swelling step in methanol is necessary to open the membrane matrix and give WCO access to the sulfonic groups. Fig. 5 reports material weight loss in methanol which is clearly proportional to the sulfonation of each membrane. Furthermore, this figure shows the positive effect of crosslinking by thermal annealing that decreases the membrane weight loss, especially in membranes MD 3 and MD 4. The weight loss in waste cooking oil for membranes MD 1 to MD 6 was found between 4.71% and 2.4% for non-crosslinked membranes. On the other hand, weight loss in waste cooking oil for membranes MD 1 to MD 6 reduces to the range between 2.6 and 0.75% after crosslinking. These results indicate that crosslinking would help decrease the loss of sulfonated polymer (S-PPS) during transesterification. As it was initially attempted, membrane MD 6 and MD 6 C swelling degree and weight loss averages cannot be differentiated since their values in both reactants are very similar and their standard deviations are also in the same range. Similarly, MD 5 and MD 5 C do not show significant differences in swelling degree and weight loss values in the as crosslinked and non-crosslinked membranes. These results are attributed to their high concentration of sulfonic groups which in turn made them highly soluble in polar solvents, such as methanol; however, they are not soluble in hydrophobic liquids such as WCO. The membranes which present the best balance between IEC, swelling degree and weight loss for attempting the WCO transesterification reaction for biodiesel production are MD 3 C, MD 4, and MD 4 C. These membranes have high swelling degree in methanol that allows reactants to access sulfonic groups to catalyze the reaction. They also show an optimal relationship between IEC and weight loss in methanol, especially MD 3 C."
8,Waste cooking oil characterization,"3.2 Waste cooking oil characterization 3.2.1 Moisture, iodine value and triglycerides content Several articles mentioned the negative effect of water in vegetable oil transesterification. According to Canakci and Gerpen [32], even trace amounts of water content around 0.1% can decrease the methyl or ethyl ester yield. There are several values of moisture content reported for waste cooking oils in a range between 0.02% and 2%. In this case, the WCO water content as received was 0.24%, which is in the range that can interfere with the transesterification reaction. In order to decrease the moisture in the WCO used here, calcium chloride was dipped into the oil [33,34]. High iodine values (IV) are related to formations of deposits due to polymerization during biodiesel combustion, also the cetane number, density and pour point are statistically related to iodine value. In this case, the iodine value (IV) obtained for the raw WCO sample was 68 g/100 g. This value fits under the standards accepted for EN 14214. Based on this IV, the product of transesterification would fit with the required standard. Triglycerides content in WCO was 93% as obtained after processing their 1H NMR spectra that is given in Fig. 6 . It can be considered a high triglycerides content that assures a low FFA content which is indicative of a low probability of side reactions. Hence based on the high triglycerides content in this WCO will be expected to reach a high methyl ester yield."
9,Catalytic reaction experiments and methyl ester yield,"3.3 Catalytic reaction experiments and methyl ester yield Transesterification reaction was carried out with the MD 3 C membrane based on the IEC, swelling degree and weight loss characteristics evaluated above. This membrane presented the best balance of IEC (1.00 ± 0.02 meq +H/g) and swelling degree (328.37%). The reaction time was 250 h and 10 samples were taken throughout the experiment. Fig. 7 shows the methyl esters yield as a function of time. It can be seen that the methyl esters conversion yield reached 86% after 250 h. The reaction shows an initial induction time in the first 100 h, with a low methyl esters conversion, between 0 and 20%. The induction time may correspond to the membrane swelling and stabilization in methanol. Methyl ester conversion increases fast between 100 and 200 h going from 20 to 80% and shows an initial stabilization plateau between 80 and 86% in the last 50 h. Fig. 8 shows the transesterification reaction 1H NMR spectrum at several times along the reaction. As it can be seen, the presence and continuous increase in the methoxy groups signal at 3.7 ppm, indicates the production of methyl ester. Also, the two signals between 4.4 and 4.0 ppm belonging to methylene in the glycerol group of triglycerides disappear gradually. Thus, 1H NMR allows to follow the evolution of triglycerides to methyl esters through time in a qualitative and quantitative manner. The conversion results show advantages compared to other results reported for heterogeneous acid-catalyzed membranes transesterification as shown in (Table 6 ). Catalytic membrane MD 3 C (PPS:S-PPS 56 blend crosslinked) decreased the transesterification reaction time, making the S-PPS membranes more efficient for transesterification reactions, even though it was tested using WCO as reaction feed and not a pure soybean oil as is the case in the other membranes reported. From this comparison it is important to point out that a larger IEC, and controlled swelling seems to be key to increase conversion of triglycerides to methyl esters using acid donor catalytic membranes. All membranes shown in (Table 6) had sulfonic acid as a catalyst. The first membrane has sulfonic acid on its crosslink agent, sulfosuccinic acid (SSA), and it uses a hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as polymeric matrix. The membrane used by Corzo-Gonzalez et al. [24] was based on poly(2-acylamido-2-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) in a PVA matrix crosslinked with succinic acid. Both PVA membranes have lower swelling degree than the blend PPS:S-PPS membranes; moreover, these membranes also have lower weight loss that makes them a better option for their reusability. The PPS:S-PPS membrane MD 3 C also shows a good performance, taking into consideration that WCO transesterification requires extreme operation conditions; however, PPS:S-PPS MD 3 C reaches a high conversion yield in less time than PVA/PAMPS and PVA-SSA membranes which employed pure soybean oil. In contrast with membranes PVA/PAMPS and PVA-SSA reported in (Table 6), membrane PPS:S-PPS MD 3 C reported here was not recovered after reaction thus it is not possible to determine if it is stable enough for reuse and the number of possible cycles. The stability for reuse and its relationship with crosslinking would be the next step in the PPS:S-PPS catalytic membrane performance tests. As (Table 6) shows, PPS:S-PPS membrane reached a high yield in less time, probably due to its high swelling degree on methanol. Moreover, if a higher IEC can be reached on PPS:S-PPS membranes, it would be expected to reach a higher methyl esters (biodiesel) yield in less time. Overall, even though the catalytic membranes technology seems promising in the biodiesel production, careful and serious studies of the long-run sustainability of this system are necessary on the basis of the process parameters (transesterification temperature, alcohol/oil molar ratio, IEC, swelling degree ratio to crosslinking and residence time) and adequate assumptions [35]. For example, life cycle assessment (LCA) to measure the environmental aspects by quantifying materials and energy consumed in the process as well as wastes discharged to the environment or using exergy-based methodologies that present greater accuracies and certainties than LCA, to optimize the environmental and thermodynamic viability of catalytic membrane technology [36] Moreover, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental methods could led to minimize the process cost and environmental impact, as well as meeting with the ASTM standard [35,37]. Finally, the issue of sustainability of PPS:S-PPS catalytic membranes should be assessed in the future through adequate life cycle tools to ensure that the process is sustainable. This issue should be done by an adequate economic comparison of different acidic catalyst and the reaction conditions, as suggested recently by Abomohra et al. [2] and Ramos et al. [3], to evaluate appropriately the sustainability of the PPS:S-PPS catalytic membrane biodiesel production."
10,Conclusions and prospects,"A route to WCO transesterification to produce biodiesel using S-PPS and PPS:S-PPS blends to prepare catalytic membranes was tested. Several S-PSS and PPS:S-PPS dense catalytic membranes were prepared and characterized by its ion exchange capacity (IEC), methanol and WCO swelling and weight loss before and after crosslinking. The results indicate that a high degree of sulfonation, S-PSS 65%, is detrimental for membrane stability since it becomes soluble in methanol. Crosslinking by thermal treatment diminishes the PPS:S-PPS blend membranes tendency to solubilize and swell. It also impedes the weight loss due to a high methanol solubility of the membrane. The membrane MD 3 C (PPS:S-PPS 30:70 blend) that presented the best balance between IEC, swelling and weight loss was tested for the acid catalyzed WCO transesterification. The results indicate that the crosslinked MD 3 C membrane is a suitable option for waste cooking oils transesterification since it reaches an 86% yield to methyl esters (biodiesel) in less time as compared to other sulfonic acid membranes reported in the literature. According to swelling results and WCO transesterification behavior during reaction, 100 h methanol pre-swelling could decrease the reaction time improving the catalytic membrane efficiency. Waste cooking oils characterization showed a 0.24% water content; thus, a simple process was used to remove it before transesterification. The high triglycerides content on the raw material (WCO) ensures a low water production preventing catalyst poisoning. The use of S-PPS membrane acid-catalyzed biodiesel production from WCO is a promising and cleaner solution for preventing water and soil pollution with an added value. The results reported here indicate the necessity of improving membranes stability by crosslinking in order to decrease the weight loss as well as to stabilize them during transesterification reaction. It is also important to reuse catalytic membrane to determine the number of cycles that they maintain catalytic activity. In addition, a study on conditions for the development of sulfonated polyphenylsulfone porous membranes should be performed to assess the feasibility of using them in a continuous biodiesel production form WCO."
