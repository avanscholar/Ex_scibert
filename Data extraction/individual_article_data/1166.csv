0,Introduction,"The production of polyol (poly-alcohols) monomers from vegetable oils has been an area of focus in polymer chemistry, particularly for the production of polyurethanes, to reduce the dependence on petroleum-based hydrocarbons. The epoxidation (Guo et al., 2000; Kiatsimkul et al., 2008; Kong et al., 2012) and ozonolysis–hydrogenation (Petrovic et al., 2005; Narine et al., 2007a) reactions are efficient and well-known chemical routes to introduce hydroxyl groups on triacylglycerols (TAGs). There are major structural differences found in the resulting monomers depending on the chemical route favored. Through epoxidation, the hydroxyl groups are located in a secondary position while through ozonolysis–hydrogenation, the hydroxyl groups are in a primary position. Furthermore, the co-products of the latter reaction are of commercial interest. These are short-chain mono-alcohols (mono-ols) or di-alcohols (diols) (Fig. 1 ). Mono-ols, such as hexanol, are used by the perfume industry (Kandra and Wagner, 1998) whereas diols, such as 1,3-propanediol, are used as chain extenders (Miao et al., 2013; Rashmi et al., 2013). The main drawbacks of the ozonolysis–hydrogenation reaction are the formation of acid at the ozonolysis stage and the high cost of the reaction. Recently, Omonov et al. (2011) focused their efforts to optimize the ozonolysis step by selecting conditions in order to reduce the amount of carboxylic acid formed in the aldehyde pool. It is important to note that the concentration of acid in the resulting polyols is not above the limit to prevent the formation of polyurethanes (Petrovic et al., 2005; Kong et al., 2007; Narine et al., 2007b,c). This publication is focused on the production of polyols, diol and mono-ols from unrefined vegetable oils in order to reduce the cost and increase the environmental friendliness of the ozonolysis–hydrogenation process. The unrefined vegetable oils selected were mustard oils (brown, yellow and oriental), flax oils (Nulin 50, CDC Bethune and Linola 2090), camelina oil and immature canola oil. The flaxes are of particular interest since they were genetically modified and therefore contained a unique fatty acid profile. Mustard oils were selected due to their high content in erucic acid which renders them indigestible for humans (Al-Jasass and Al-Jasser, 2012). Camelina oil was selected since it is used as industrial oil (Zubr, 1997) and immature canola was selected since it does not meet the allowable chlorophyll limit for food consumption (Daun and Symons, 2000; Daun, 2003). Because unrefined vegetable oils were not physically or chemically treated, they contained molecules other than TAGs such as sterols and tocopherols. Therefore, the study of the influence of the non-TAG content on the resulting polyols, mono-ols and diols was an objective of this study. The polyols and light alcohol content of these oils were compared to canola oil and sunflower oil which acted as standards since these oils were chemically refined."

3,Cold press,2.2 Cold press A Komet screw oil expeller was used to crush the seeds of the different varieties of flax and mustard in order to extract the vegetable oil. The processing rate ranged from 4 to 6kg/h.
4,Centrifugation,"2.3 Centrifugation Cold press mustard, camelina, flax and juvenile canola oils were centrifuged with a Beckman Coulter Avanti J26XPI centrifuge with a JLA 8.1000 rotor. The speed used was 6500rpm (which equals 10,543× g) for 30min at room temperature."
5,Vegetable oil characterization,"2.4 Vegetable oil characterization The analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was carried out using an Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer Instruments LLC, Shelton, CT) equipped with a flame-ionization detector (GC-FID) and an SP-2560 capillary column (100m×0.25mm i.d., 0.2μm film thickness, Supelco). The oven temperature was maintained at 45°C for 4min, increased to 175°C at a rate of 13°C/min, maintained at 175°C for 27min then increased to 215°C at a rate of 4°C/min, and finally held at 215°C for 35min. The injector and detector temperatures were 240°C and 280°C, respectively. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas at a rate of 1mL/min and the injection port was in split mode of 40:1. The vegetable oil samples (≈40mg) were dissolved in toluene (1mL) in a Pyrex caped test tube where 2mL of 10% of acetyl chloride in methanol were added. The test tube was sealed and placed in an oven at 80°C for 2h. 5mL of water containing 5% of sodium chloride was added to the tube after cooled down to room temperature. The formed esters were extracted with (2× 5mL) of hexane. The hexane layer was washed with basic water (2% sodium bicarbonate) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The hexane and sodium sulphate were centrifuged for 2min. C17:1 (internal standard) was added to the 5mL hexane layer for GC injection. The individual FAMEs were identified by their retention times, and by comparison with FAME reference standards (GLC-463, Nu-chekprep). All concentrations were calculated by using methyl 10-heptadecenoate (C17:1) as internal standard. The AOCS official Method Ce 1h-05 was applied to determine the theoretical flame ionization detector correction factor. The samples were run in duplicate."
6,Ozonolysis,"2.5 Ozonolysis Vegetable oils (100g) and ethyl acetate (600mL) were added to an ozonolysis batch reactor as described in Omonov et al. (2011). The reaction was carried out at −10°C under an ozone concentration of 6.5L/min. The agitation was set at a constant speed (500rpm) and the duration of the reaction was of 45min. After the reaction, the unreacted ozone was purged with nitrogen gas for 5min. The ozonolysis product (aldehyde oil) was sampled for GC analysis and then transferred for hydrogenation. The samples were run in duplicate."
7,Hydrogenation,"2.6 Hydrogenation The aldehyde oil was transferred to an hydrogenation vessel described in Kong and Narine (Narine et al., 2007a). Then 10g of nickel catalyst (Sponge Nickel, A-7063, promoted with 1% molybdenum) were added. The reaction vessel was charged with hydrogen gas to a pressure of 300psi. The temperature was then increased to 100°C. The reaction was carried out for 3h prior for the temperature to be reduced to room temperature. The reaction vessel was finally purged with nitrogen gas and the resulting hydrogenated mixture was filtered over celite. The solvent was then removed from the resulting mixture using rotary evaporation. The samples were run in duplicate."
8,Wipped-blade molecular distillation,"2.7 Wipped-blade molecular distillation The final hydrogenation product was added to a wipe-blade molecular distillation vessel (Model VKL 70/ICL-04, from Incon Processing, IL, USA) to separate the lighter and heavier alcohols. The jacket temperature was maintained at 115°C, the condenser was maintained at 5°C and the vacuum was maintained in the range of 80–90mTorr."
9,Characterization of the reaction products,"2.8 Characterization of the reaction products The GC apparatus was used for the characterization of the aldehyde (ozonolysis product) and the low molecular weight alcohols recovered from the distillation step. It was also used as a tool for the determination of the hydrogenation completion. The apparatus was an Agilent 6890. A split injection 80:1 was used for 1μL of sample. Helium was the carrier gas and the flow rate was 1.5mL/min. The initial oven temperature was held at 50°C for 3min, rising to 90°C at 25°C/min and then to 250°C at 10°C/min and held for 13min. The universal flame ionization detector had a range of 0–10V. A BP20 chromatographic column (30m×0.25mm i.d.×0.25μm film thickness) (SGE, USA) was selected. The detection of 1,6-hexanediol was done similarly except that a 5975B MSD Electron impact mode was used. The alcohol and acid standard solutions were prepared by dissolving the standards (listed in Section 2.1) in dichloromethane. All the standard solutions had a concentration of 10mgmL−1 and were injected with the internal standard. Standard calibration curves were generated by the analysis of a series of standard solutions over appropriate concentration ranges. The fatty acid standards have been injected within the concentration range of 0.015mgmL−1 and 0.38mgmL−1. All calibration concentration points were run in triplicate."
10,Hydroxyl and acidity values,2.9 Hydroxyl and acidity values The hydroxyl number of the polyols was determined according to ASTM D1957-86 and the acidity values were determined according to the ASTM D4662-98.
11,Rheometric measurements,"2.10 Rheometric measurements The viscosity of the polyols monomers was measured with an AR 2000 Rheometer (TA Instrument, Delaware) in a shearing mode with a shearing rate of 50.0s−1."
12,Molecular weight distribution,"2.11 Molecular weight distribution The molecular weight distribution of the polyols was determined with a gel permeation chromatography high pressure liquid chromatography (GPC HPLC) model 1200 series from Agilent equipped with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) 2000 from Alltech. Polyols (10mg) were dissolved in 10mL of dichloromethane. Then, 50% (v/v) of the mother solution and dichloromethane were transferred into the injection vial. The injection volume was 10μL. THF was used as the mobile phase and the flow rate was of 1mL/min. The temperature of the ELSD detector was 70°C. The gas flow rate and gain were 2L/min and 1 respectively. A Styragel HR 1 THF chromatographic column (7.8mm×300mm) (Waters, USA) was selected. High molecular weight (Mw) polystyrenes (Mw: 10,200, 6520, 3950, 2340) from Shodex STANDARD (Japan), tripalmitic triglycerol (PPP) from Sigma–Aldrich and distearine and monostearine from Nu-chekprep (USA) were used as standards."
13,HPLC,"2.12 HPLC The semi-quantitative analysis of the mono-ols, diols and triols fraction was done with an HPLC model 1200 series from Agilent equipped with an ELSD 2000 detector from Alltech. Polyols (10mg) were dissolved in 10mL of dichloromethane. Then, 50% (v/v) of the mother solution and dichloromethane were transferred into the injection vial. The injection volume was 10μL of samples. Hexane:isopropanol (1:1) and hexane (100%) were used as the gradient mobile phase. The flow rate was 3mL/min and the gradient started from 100% to 70% hexane in 20min. The temperature of the ELSD detector was 100°C. The gas flow rate and gain were 2L/min and 8 respectively. The column temperature was set at 50°C. A Thermo Fisher Betasil diol-100 chromatographic column (particle size of 5μm, 4mm×250mm) (USA) was selected."
14,Differential scanning calorimetry,"2.13 Differential scanning calorimetry A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) Q100 from TA Instruments (DE, USA) was used for the DSC measurements. This apparatus was equipped with a refrigerated cooling system and the measurements were performed under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The measurements were divided into 2 cycles. Cycle one consisted in cooling the sample (about 7mg) at a rate of 3°C/min from room temperature to −15°C, holding the temperature for 5min. Cycle two consisted in heating the samples to 70°C at a rate of 5°C/min. The measurements were done in duplicate."
15,Results and discussion,
16,Vegetable oils characterization,"3.1 Vegetable oils characterization Table 1 shows the fatty acid composition of canola oil, juvenile canola oil, sunflower oil, camelina oil, three types of mustard oils and three types of flax oils. The canola and sunflower oils were received in a chemically refined state and hence were mainly composed of triacylglycerol. Seeds of mustards, flaxes and camelina were cold pressed to extract the oils. The oils were subsequently centrifuged. Because no refining treatments were performed on these oils, different classes of lipid materials such as free fatty acids, phospholipids, sterols and tocopherols (Dumont and Narine, 2007) were present in the bulk. Furthermore, juvenile canola oil is known for its high concentration in chlorophyll (above 200mg/kg) (Daun and Symons, 2000; Daun, 2003), which may also impact the reaction products from the ozonolysis–hydrogenation process. The juvenile canola oil was also centrifuged prior to its characterization. From Table 1, the mono-, di- and tri-unsaturated fatty acid profile varied greatly among the species and among the varieties of the same species while the unsaturated fatty acid content did not vary significantly. The canola and the juvenile canola oils contained oleic acid as the main fatty acid. The main fatty acid of the oriental and yellow mustard oils was erucic acid. Brown mustard oil had the same proportion (22wt.%) of linoleic and erucic acid. The main fatty acid found in sunflower and camelina oils was linoleic acid. To our best knowledge, the fatty acid composition of CDC Bethune, Nulin 50 and Linola 2090 is reported for the first time. The fatty acid composition of these flax varieties showed great discrepancies. From Table 1, Nulin 50 is composed of 70wt.% of tri-unsaturated fatty acids which correspond to its content in α-linolenic acid. The CDC Bethune variety holds the second highest content in α-linolenic acid, with a ratio of 54wt.%. Interestingly, the proportion of tri-unsaturated fatty acid of the Linola 2090 variety is very low (1.7wt.%) but holds the highest percentage of di-unsaturated fatty acid (71wt.%) due to its content in linoleic acid."
17,Aldehyde formation,"3.2 Aldehyde formation It is well known that ozonolysis of fatty acids leads to the formation of aldehydes. The efficiency of the ozonolysis step was monitored through quantification of nonanal; the aldehyde formed by reacting oleic acid with ozone. The choice of nonanal was based on the fatty acid profile of the vegetable oils, which showed that oleic acid was significantly present in the oil samples (Table 2 ). From Table 1, high oleic canola and juvenile canola oils held the highest concentration with ≈66% and ≈54% respectively. Nulin 50 held the lowest concentration with ≈9%. Predictably, there was a correlation between the nonanal content of the ozonide and the oleic acid content of the different vegetable oils while considering the standard deviations (Table 2). High standard deviations were also reported for similar measurements (Omonov et al., 2011)."
18,Physical properties of polyols,"3.3 Physical properties of polyols As pictured in Fig. 1, the hydrogenation of the products yielded from the ozonolysis step (the ozonide) led to the formation of high molecular weight polyols and light alcohols. It was measured by GC-FID that the hydrogenation was completed at ≥99% for all samples. After hydrogenation, the light alcohols were separated from the higher molecular weight polyols through distillation. The semi-quantitative distribution of triols, diols and mono-ols was performed by normal phase HPLC. Fig. 2 shows the juvenile canola polyol fraction distribution which is similar to the polyols from the 9 other vegetable oils. Table 3 shows that the triols are generally the main component of the polyols. The proportion of triols in canola, juvenile canola, sunflower and mustard polyols accounted for at least 62wt.%. The triol concentration in camelina and flax polyols accounted for less than 50%. The results showed that camelina and Nulin 50 polyols had a higher concentration in diols than triols. Therefore, there seemed to be a correlation between the triol concentration and the hydroxyl number of the polyols (Table 4 ), where camelina and flax polyols displayed the lowest hydroxyl numbers. As shown in Table 1, camelina, CDC Bethune and Nulin 50 had the highest concentration in linolenic acid (a tri-unsaturated fatty acid) which may have required a longer ozonolysis time for conversion. Similarly, Linola 2090 had the highest concentration in linoleic acid (a di-unsaturated fatty acid). This may explain the low concentration in triols and lower hydroxyl numbers. However, it is important to note that Nulin 50, which displays the highest saturated Tag content (6%) and mono-ol content (29%) could still be utilized as polyol for the production of polyurethanes. It was shown that vegetable oil-based polyols with a mono-ol and saturated TAGs content of 26% and 14% respectively were used for that purpose (Kong et al., 2007). The difference between the calculated and the experimental hydroxyl number is of higher importance for the polyols synthesized from unrefined vegetable oils. Canola and sunflower oils had a low concentration in tri-unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, because these oils were refined, no impurities such as sterols and tocopherols were present in the lipidic pool. Therefore, their higher hydroxyl numbers were expected. The hydroxyl numbers of the flax species are especially low. Linola 2090 had a higher concentration in triols and a higher hydroxyl number than the other two mustard species, probably because of its low concentration in tri-unsaturated fatty acid. Nulin 50 and CDC Bethune held the highest concentration in tri-unsaturated fatty acids. Linola 2090 also has a very low concentration in tri-unsaturated fatty acids but holds the highest concentration in di-unsaturated fatty acids, which may explain the highest hydroxyl number compared to the other flax varieties. The low hydroxyl number of camelina was unexpected. Because camelina has a similar content in mono-, di- and tri-unsaturated fatty acids as brown and oriental mustard, camelina's hydroxyl number was expected to be similar to these mustard species. Because the oils were not refined prior to their processing, these oils contained non-saponifiable matter. Therefore, the lower hydroxyl number found for camelina may be the result of a higher content in non-saponifiable matter which may have consumed part of the available hydrogen destined for the hydrogenation of the ozonide and therefore, led to the resulting camelina polyol with a lower hydroxyl number. However, further investigation is needed. Nonetheless, the experimental hydroxyl number followed the trend of the calculated hydroxyl number. For example, the mustard polyol family had a higher hydroxyl number than the flax polyol family. However, the trend is not linear within the same oil family. Table 4 shows that Linola 2090 has a higher calculated hydroxyl number but a lower experimental hydroxyl number than Nulin 50 and CDC Bethune. In this case, Nulin 50 only contained 17% of tri-unsaturated fatty acid as compared to Linola 2090 and CDC Bethune which contained 70% and 54% of tri-unsaturated, respectively. The number average molecular weight of the polyols sourced from refined vegetable oils is also lower than sourced from crude vegetable oils (Table 4). This is explained by the non-triacylglycerol content present in crude oils. For example, the polyols from juvenile canola were 60g/mol heavier than the polyols from refined canola oil even though canola and juvenile canola oils displayed similar fatty acid profiles. The main difference between the juvenile and the refined canola oils is the ratio of oleic and linolenic acid, which are both fatty acids containing 18 carbons. Therefore the presence of chlorophyll and other compounds such as sterols and tocopherols are responsible for the difference in weight. Both the number average molecular weight and the hydroxyl number influence the viscosity of the polyols (Fig. 3 ). Therefore, various levels of crystallinity are present. For example, polyols from mustard (oriental, brown and yellow mustard) were crystallizing before 15°C (Fig. 4 ) and hence was the most viscous material. This is not surprising since the materials had high number average molecular weights (666–692g/mol) and high hydroxyl numbers (184–195mg KOH/g). On the contrary, the lowest onset of crystallization is found for all flax species (about −7°C). The hydroxyl number of Nulin 50 and CDC Bethune are amongst the lowest (165 and 163mg KOH/g respectively). Linola 2090 has a high hydroxyl number (180mg KOH/g) but the number average molecular weight is low (612g/mol). This trend is also demonstrated by the viscosity profile of the polyols since all polyols synthesized from the flax species show lower viscosities than polyols synthesized from the mustard species (Fig. 3). The highest viscosity is found for the refined canola polyols, which display a hydroxyl number above 200mg KOH/g but a low molecular weight value of 521g/mol. The increase in OH groups increases the chance of oligomer formation (Petrovic, 2008) which would increase the viscosity."
19,Characterization of light fraction,"3.4 Characterization of light fraction Fig. 5 a and b presents the light alcohols resulting from the ozonolysis–hydrogenation of canola and juvenile canola oil, respectively. As suggested by the figures, nonanol is the main component in the bulk. Both figures show similar light alcohol distribution patterns. However, an unknown peak at approximately 15min is present in the juvenile canola light fraction. It was determined that the mass and the probable structure of the fraction to be similar to hexanediol (molecular weight=118). This may be due to the formation of oligomers as suggested by Omonov et al. (2011). Table 5 presents the light alcohol fraction for all vegetable oils. Nonanol is the main component for all fractions. This is due to the oleic acid content in vegetable oils but also because erucic acid (n-9) is also a main component in mustard oils (Table 1)."
20,Conclusion,"This study showed that it is possible to produce polyols and light alcohols using crude vegetable oils as feedstock. It was demonstrated that the physical properties of polyols from unrefined vegetable oils differ from the refined vegetable oils. The presence of high molecular weight compounds such as phospholipids, sterols, tocopherols, chlorophyll and others increase the number average molecular weight of the polyol pool. It was also found that the hydroxyl numbers were lower than when refined vegetable oils are used as feedstock. Even though polyols from crude vegetable oils exhibited substantial gaps between the calculated and experimental hydroxyl number, some examples from the literature showed that polyurethanes elastomers and foams could be synthesized within the hydroxyl number range obtained in this study (Narine et al., 2007a,c). Our future work will provide the physical properties of polyurethane matrices from polyols synthesized form unrefined vegetable oils. The characterization of the light fraction revealed a good correlation with the fatty acid profile. The preponderance of nonanol in the bulk was due to oleic acid and eicosanoic acid, with both being found in large quantities in the vegetable oils."
