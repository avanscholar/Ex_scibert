0,Introduction,"Wood chips, a source of alternative renewable energy, have been studied as feedstocks for fuels in order to cope with the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions [1–5]. To improve the energy density of wood chips (6.5 GJ/m3) up to the level of coal (23–26 GJ/m3), torrefaction and densification technologies are required, which could convert wood chips into torrefied wood pellets with an energy density of 16–22 GJ/m3 [4,6,7]. Torrefaction is a thermal treatment under a non-oxygen environment at 200–300 °C. As the first step for the production of torrefied pellets, torrefaction has been studied with regards to its kinetics and optimized conditions, due to its great function in increasing the energy density, softness, and hydrophobicity of the torrefied biomass to make high-grade pellets [1,4,7,8]. However, compared to the research interest in the torrefaction process, few studies have been reported on the densification of torrefied particles, such as torrefied wood, into pellets [1]. Densification, the step that follows the torrefaction treatment, is a process that compacts biomass into solid particles of uniform shape and size (i.e., pellets, briquettes) by applying a mechanical force [1]. This process leads to an enhancement in bulk density. Torrefied pellets are not yet fully commercialized due to difficulties in producing durable pellets from torrefied biomass. However, the opportunity to expand the trade in torrefied pellets is still available because torrefied pellets can replace thermal coal without substantial modification to industrial boilers. The current trade in white wood pellets (non-torrefied) accounts for more than 28.5 million tonnes of the annual world production of pellets [5]. Conditions of the densification process, including the temperature of the die, holding pressure, holding time, and load speed [3,9–12], are essential in determining the properties of the pellets, including density, strength, moisture up-taking behaviour, and heating value [1]. To maintain the high density of the pellets, which reduces transportation and handling costs, the studies of Phanphanich in 2013 and Verhoeff et al. in 2011 on torrefied sawdust for pellets suggested high die temperature and holding pressure during the densification process for torrefied biomass [3,10]. Moreover, the mechanical strength of the pellets determines how easily the pellets will break during handling, transportation, and storage. Unlike a durability test used in large-scale production, which determines the percentage of mass retained after mechanical mixing [13], the strength of the pellets made by a single pellet pelletizer has been commonly estimated from the level of breaking force established through compression testing [1]. Peng et al. reported a higher strength of the sawdust pellets at a temperature of 220 °C or above than that of the pellets made in the range of 70–220 °C, indicating the effect of die temperature on pellet production [1]. Another essential parameter that affects pellet quality, moisture up-taking behaviour, is associated with the storage life of the pellets, which is measured by the mass change of pellets placed in a humidified chamber [11,14]. By treating the torrefied sawdust for pellet-making, Verhoeff et al. found that a higher die temperature (260 °C) was preferable during the densification process, in order to yield a relatively low moisture up-taking value [3]. However, torrefaction and resulting reactions eliminate many of the functional groups in unreacted biomass to give strength and density increase [7]. Densification has less impact on improving the properties of pellets via forming new bonds. This leads to the demand on external binders to provide additional functional groups for the densification process. Binders provide the natural adhesion force that brings interlocked particles into close contact, assisting the development of solid bridges in particles by heating and compression during the densification process [8,15–17]. Therefore, binders can theoretically improve the pellet strength without compromising other qualities. The significance of binders was first confirmed by Ghiasi et al. in their study of bio-coal production [4]. Also, potential binders such as lignin, starch, sawdust, calcium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide were found to be effective in the torrefied biomass densification process when used at 10–30 wt% binder level [8,18–20]. According to Peng et al.‘s study, sawdust was reported to increase the density and the strength of pellets with less energy input when used at 10–30 wt% [8]. Other lignocellulosic binders, such as peanut shell, were demonstrated to increase the pellet strength when used at a relatively high level (>10 wt%) [19,20]. Moreover, Hu et al. reported that inorganic binders, i.e. sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, can be used to increase the pellet strength with some sacrificing in pellet hydrophobicity [18]. They also indicated the binder level at 10 wt% for inorganic binders used in pellets production [18]. However, the strict standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) only allow a binder level of less than 4 wt% for premium quality pellets made from thermally treated wood [21]. This suggested that these studies on pellet binders cannot be applied for the commercial pellet production; thus, torrefied wood binders are scarce in the current market [18]. Specified risk materials (SRM) are the proteinaceous waste segregated from cattle, which are contaminated by prions, a possible infection agent for ‘mad cow disease’. According to the ban of SRM by the Canada government, rendering companies are responsible for the separation and disposal of SRM, causing more than 22.5 M CAD$ of additional costs for companies [22]. This has led to studies on the valorization of SRM. Recent studies have supported the development of protein-based adhesives with peptides derived from SRM via thermal hydrolysis [22–24], showing a great potential for SRM valorization. This is not only because of the outstanding properties these peptides possess, such as considerable binding strength, favourable biodegradability, and potential carbon/nitrogen release, but also due to several successful bio-conversion processes demonstrated by cross-linking of SRM-derived peptides for adhesion studies [22,25–28]. Cross-linking products produced from reactions between epoxidized poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and SRM-derived peptides, hereafter referred to as PVA-EPC-Peptides, have demonstrated superior binding with wood fibres [22], indicating the feasibility of using this cross-linked product to adhere to cellulosic materials such as torrefied wood. Herein, PVA-EPC-Peptides generated at a 1:1 M ratio (epoxy groups: primary amino groups) were examined as binders in the torrefied wood densification process. The properties of the pellets made with torrefied wood to which PVA-EPC-Peptides were added as a binder were characterized and evaluated in this study to verify the effects of this binder on pellet density, compression strength, moisture up-taking, elemental content, and heating value at relatively low binder levels."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials SRM was obtained from a rendering facility in Western Canada. The torrefied wood was generously provided by Airex Energie (Laval, QC, Canada). According to the information provided by Airex Energie, the feed material of torrefied wood was spruce/fir sawdust. The torrefied material had undergone 30% weight loss on a dry mass basis, which is consistent with the weight loss value suggested by references [1,8]. (±)-epichlorohydrin (purum, ≥99%), hydrochloride acid (certified ACS, 37%), and poly (vinyl alcohol) (MW 13000–23000, 87–89% hydrolyzed) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Sodium hydroxide (certified ACS, 98.8%) and hexane (certified ACS) were obtained from Fisher Scientific (New Jersey, USA)."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Thermal hydrolysis of SRM and SRM-derived peptides recovery The standard laboratory protocol for SRM thermal hydrolysis was approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) [29] and optimized by Mekonnen et al. [30–33]. To obtain the SRM hydrolysate, 1.0 kg of SRM was first placed in 1.0 L of Milli-Q water in a dedicated 5.5-L stainless steel pressure vessel (Parr 4582, Parr Instrument Company, Moline, USA). The subsequent hydrolysis was conducted at a temperature of 180 °C and ≥174 psi of nitrogen pressure for 40 min. After that, a recovery process was employed for peptides collection, starting with dilution via addition of 9.0 L of Milli-Q water to the SRM hydrolysate. The resulting slurry was then agitated at 200 rpm in a shaker (Innova lab shaker, New Brunswick™, Mississauga, Canada) for 10 min, followed by centrifugation (Avanti J-26 XP high-performance centrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, Canada) at 7000×g for 40 min, and filtration (Whatman no. 4 filter paper, 20–25 μM pore size) to remove any insoluble material. Following that, the filtrate was washed with hexane (1:1 v/v ratio) three times to facilitate removal of any residual lipids. Finally, a tan-coloured proteinaceous cake (total 34 ± 2% of the feed material) was afforded through lyophilisation on the aqueous fraction, referred to hereafter as SRM-derived peptides [34]. 2.2.2 PVA epoxidation The preparation of the PVA solution was previously described [22], in which the solution was first prepared by dissolving 1.14 g of PVA in 5.0 ml water at 60 °C, which helped to facilitate faster dissolving of PVA. Following this, 6.0 ml of epichlorohydrin was added to the PVA solution. The mixture was then placed in an oil bath at 60 °C for 12 h. During the reaction, 1.20 ml of 5.0 N aqueous NaOH solution was added to the reactants at the rate of 200 μl/20 min for dechlorination purposes. After the reaction was cooled to room temperature, the product was diluted with 15.0 ml Milli-Q water, and washed with 30 ml hexane to remove the excess epichlorohydrin. The aqueous fraction was later neutralized with 0.1 N HCl and stored as the epoxidized PVA solution. 2.2.3 Cross-linking of SRM-derived peptides and epoxidized PVA The cross-linking reaction was performed as previously described [22]. Briefly, 4.00 g of SRM-derived peptides were first mixed with the epoxidized PVA solution (20 ml) obtained from 1.14 g PVA (described in section 2.2.2), followed by a pH adjustment of the mixture to 9.0 using 3.0 N NaOH. Subsequently, the mixture was incubated in an oil bath at 23 °C for 20 h. After the reaction, the product solution was cooled and neutralized with 0.1 N NaOH. Finally, the cross-linked product was collected in powder form, referred to as PVA-EPC-Peptides hereafter, through a lyophilisation process. 2.2.4 Preparation of densification powders Prior to pelletization trials, the torrefied wood feedstock was pre-processed, which involved grinding using a blender (7500 series, Vitamix, Cleveland, USA) and sieve-screening to ≤300 μm. The torrefied wood powders were collected and stored at 23 °C. The moisture content of the collected powders was measured at ∼2.0–3.0 wt% using a moisture analyzer (HE53 Halogen, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, USA). To prepare densification powders with a specific binder, the ground torrefied wood powders were first mixed with the binder and/or Milli-Q water using a stainless steel coffee grinder (CBG 100 S Bean Coffee Grinder, Black + Decker, Baltimore, USA). The moisture level of the mixture was then checked using the moisture analyzer. The steps of adding Milli-Q water, mixing, and checking moisture content were repeated until the desired moisture levels (3.0–10.0 wt%) were reached. 2.2.5 Densification procedure Densification experiments were conducted using an MTI-10 K press single pelletizer (Measurement Technology Inc., Marietta, USA) to make torrefied wood pellets (Fig. 1 ). A metal cylinder with a hollow channel of 6.35 mm inside diameter and 70 mm length, called the die unit, was placed on a metal pedestal. A piston of 6.30 mm in diameter and 90 mm in length was then inserted into the cylinder to facilitate densification. During the densification, the piston was pressed by a 25.0-mm-diameter mobile probe, which could be controlled to deliver the desired mechanical force for the formation of pellets. The die unit was wrapped with heating tape and preheated to a given temperature (23–175 °C). The inside temperature of the die unit was monitored with a thermocouple, which was connected to the controller. In a typical run of sample densification, 0.50 g of the sample mixture was first loaded into the die to make a single pellet. The pistol was then inserted and pressed with a gradually increasing force at a velocity of 10 mm displacement/min until the pressing stress reached the desired level (50–350 MPa). This pressing stress was considered the holding pressure. After that, the pistol was held at the holding pressure for 1–5 min before increasing the pressure to the maximum value of 70–370 MPa (about 20 MPa higher than the holding pressure). The die was then placed on a metric hex nut (22 mm in diameter, 11 mm in height) to allow the probe to expel the pellet with the maximum-value pressure from the underneath of the die. Finally, the pellet was taken out of the nut and stored in a Petri dish (100 × 15 mm, Fisherbrand™, Ottawa, Canada) at 23 °C. 2.2.6 Density determination for torrefied wood pellets The mass of the pellet was determined using a balance (Balance XS105, Mettler Toledo, Mississauga, Canada). The diameter and the length of the pellet were measured with a digital calliper (Fisherbrand™, Ottawa, Canada). Since the pellet made by the single pelletizer was cylindrical in shape, the volume of the pellet could be calculated using the cubature formula for a cylinder. The density of the pellet was calculated as follows: ρ p e l l e t ( kg / m 3 ) = W p e l l e t ( g ) × 10 6 V p e l l e t ( mm 3 ) = W p e l l e t ( g ) × 10 6 L p e l l e t ( mm ) × π × ( D p e l l e t ( mm ) 2 ) 2 where ρ pellet is the density of the pellet, W pellet is the mass of the pellet, V pellet is the volume of the pellet, L pellet is the length of the pellet, and D pellet is the diameter of the pellet. 2.2.7 Compression stress determination The compression stress at the breaking point of pellets was measured in both the radial and axial directions to estimate the overall strength of the pellet [35]. To measure the radial or axial compression stress, pellets made from the same mixtures were placed on a specific ion disc (31.5 mm diameter) under the MTI mobile probe before compression at a velocity of 10 mm displacement/min. The bottom surface of the pellet was set parallel to the surface of the disk for the radial measurement, and these two surfaces were placed perpendicularly to determine the axial measurement of Meyer hardness [1], shown in Fig. 2 . The maximum compression force (F/N) exerted to break a pellet in these measurements was recorded with the probe displacement, and the compression stresses of the pellets were calculated as follows: Indentation depth (h (mm)) in radial compression test: h ( mm ) = D m a x ( mm ) − D 0 ( mm ) where D max is the displacement of the compressing probe at the point of pellet breaking, and D 0 is the displacement of the probe when the compressing probe first touches the pellet. Radial compression stress (P R (MPa)): P R ( MPa ) = F R ( N ) S ( mm 2 ) = F R ( N ) b ( mm ) × L p e l l e t ( mm ) = F R ( N ) 2 × L p e l l e t ( mm ) × ( D p e l l e t ( mm ) 2 ) 2 − [ D p e l l e t ( mm ) 2 − h ( mm ) ] 2 = F R ( N ) 2 × L p e l l e t ( mm ) × h ( mm ) × [ D p e l l e t ( mm ) − h ( mm ) ] where F R is the breaking force in the radial direction measurement, S is the indentation area made by the compressed probe, b is the width of the indentation area, L pellet is the length of the pellet, D pellet is the diameter of the pellet, and h is the indentation depth. Axial compression stress P A (MPa): P A ( MPa ) = F A ( N ) A ( mm 2 ) = F A ( N ) π × ( D p e l l e t ( mm ) 2 ) 2 where F A is the breaking force in the axial direction measurement, A is the base area of a pellet cylinder, and D pellet is the diameter of the pellet. 2.2.8 Moisture uptake of torrefied wood pellets The method developed by Peng et al. was followed in this study [1]. A growth chamber (PGR 15, Controlled Environments Ltd, Winnipeg, Canada) was used to determine the moisture up-taking behaviour of pellets, including the maximum moisture up-taking value and the moisture up-taking with time. Before the test, pellets were first dried in a drying oven (Isotemp 625G Gravity Oven, Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, Canada) at 105 °C for 3 h, and then stored in a Petri dish (100 × 15 mm, Fisherbrand, Ottawa, Canada) before being placed into the chamber. The growth chamber was pre-set at 30 °C and 90% relative humidity without any light. It is worth mentioning that the Petri dish was kept open when the pellets were placed into the chamber, but was covered during the measurement of pellet mass to reduce moisture loss. The weight of the pellets was measured every 30 min for the first 2 h, followed by measurements at 4 h, 8 h and 24 h. After 24 h, the weight was measured every 24 h until the weight became constant. The moisture up-taking (wt%) of the pellets can be calculated as follow: M o i s t u r e u p − t a k i n g ( wt% ) = W m o i s t u r e ( g ) W p e l l e t ( g ) × 100 % = W m e a s u r e m e n t ( g ) − ( W 0 ( g ) − W dish ( g ) ) W 0 ( g ) − W d i s h ( g ) × 100 % where W pellet is the weight of the pellet, W moisture is the weight of the moisture up-taken by the pellet, W measurement is the mass of the Petri dish with a pellet weighed at different measuring time, W dish is the mass of the Petri dish without a pellet (weighed before the test). W 0 is the mass of the Petri dish with an oven-dried pellet weighed at the beginning of the test (0 h). 2.2.9 Elemental analysis of torrefied wood pellets The pellets (dry basis) made with and without a binder were ground with a blender (7500 series, Vitamix, Cleveland, USA) and measured with a Thermo Flash 2000 Elemental Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) to determine the content of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur through sample combustion. The chlorine (Cl) content of the binders (SRM-derived peptides and PVA-EPC-Peptides) was determined by the Cl− content in the binder solution. The binder solution was made by dissolving SRM-derived peptides/PVA-EPC-Peptides (dry basis) in Milli-Q water at a concentration of 500 ppm. The resulting solution was measured with a Dionex Ion chromatography (IC) DX 600 system, with a 4 mm AS9-HC analytical column and electrolytic suppressor (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) to determine Cl− content. 2.2.10 Heating value determination for torrefied wood pellets An IKA C5000 Bomb Calorimeter (IKA-Werke, Staufen, Germany) was used to determine the calorific value of torrefied wood pellets obtained from 0.50 g powders (ASTM D5865). Measurement in a calorimeter is accomplished via combustion processes in an oxygen atmosphere, as described previously [36]. 2.2.11 Statistical analysis The Fisher LSD (Fishers Least Significant Difference) method [37] was applied for all of the statistical analyses. The values or bars of a given figure annotated with the same letter are statistically similar at a 95% confidence level."
4,Results and discussion,
5,The density and compression strength of torrefied wood pellets,"3.1 The density and compression strength of torrefied wood pellets As mentioned previously, wood binders are mostly used to enhance the properties of pellets, especially pellet density and pellet strength. Since torrefied wood powders are generated from cellulose sources, they are expected to interact with binders/adhesives developed for cellulosic materials. According to a previous study on tackifier development, SRM-derived peptides cross-linked with PVA improved the binding strength of the products (i.e., PVA-EPC-Peptides), as compared to unmodified SRM-derived peptides [22]. Therefore, in order to expand the application of this cross-linked product for other cellulosic materials, a study was conducted on the potential of PVA-EPC-Peptides to be used as a renewable and biodegradable torrefied wood binder. Other factors that influence pellet properties (i.e., die temperature, holding pressure, holding time, and moisture content) were studied to obtain promising pellets that satisfy the current industry standards. Considering that the cross-linked products synthesized by Shui et al. at molar ratios of 2:1 and 3:1 (based on primary amine groups in peptides: epoxy groups in epoxidized PVA) started to decompose at a temperature of 100 °C, which is not suitable for a densification process [22], only cross-linked products obtained at a 1:1 M ratio were subjected to this study. In further support of this selection, the cross-linked products generated using 2:1 and 3:1 ratios displayed excellent water absorption qualities [22], which may reduce the water-resistance of the resulting pellets and is thus not desirable. 3.1.1 The impact of binder LevelS Initial studies were conducted to assess pellet density and compression stresses when different binder levels (1.0–5.0 wt%, Table 1 ) of PVA-EPC-Peptides and SRM-derived peptides were used. Based on the conditions used by Peng et al., a die temperature of 150 °C, a powder moisture content of 3.0 wt%, a holding pressure of 250 MPa and 1 min holding time were initially used for pellet densification [1]. During the tests, pellets made only with torrefied wood powders were applied as a control. In addition, unmodified SRM-derived peptides were mixed with torrefied wood to make the sample powders and were pelletized as another control to help assess the impact of SRM cross-linking. Pellets with high density take up less space at the same mass, which is favored to decrease the costs for transportation and storage. Moreover, pellets with high density can improve combustion efficiency, which is essential to the current industry [38]. The densities of the pellets generated with different levels of binder are shown in Fig. 3 . In comparison to the density of the pellets made with no binders, the density of the pellets made with PVA-EPC-Peptides or unmodified SRM-derived peptides was increased (Fig. 3). Moreover, PVA-EPC-Peptides showed a greater improvement in pellet density when compared with the SRM-derived peptides, peaking at the 3.0 and 5.0 wt% binder levels (Fig. 3). One possible explanation for this density improvement would be that the particles of PVA-EPC-Peptides and SRM-derived peptides were softer than torrefied wood particles, and could thus fill in the gaps between particles that would otherwise be filled with air. Another possible reason is that the introduction of additional binding forces by the binder promotes better binding between torrefied wood particles, decreasing the number and size of voids formed in the pellets. The radial and axial compression strength measurements were then studied to estimate the strength of the pellets (Fig. 4 ). The torrefied wood pellets without a binder (Fig. 4A and B, 0.0 wt% binder level) exhibited the same compression strength as pellets made with unmodified peptides in both radial (Fig. 4A) and axial tests (Fig. 4B), indicating that the addition of unmodified peptides had no influence on the strength of the pellets. However, when observing the impact of PVA-EPC-Peptides, a strength enhancement in the pellets made using PVA-EPC-Peptides was noticed at all the binder levels, as demonstrated by higher breaking stresses of the pellets in both radial (Fig. 4A) and axial (Fig. 4B) tests. Furthermore, comparing the strength of the PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets at different binder levels demonstrated that the breaking stresses of pellets gradually increased with increasing the binder level of PVA-EPC-Peptides from 1.0 wt% to 5.0 wt%. Nevertheless, international standards and requirements can impact the binder level employed for pelletization. The International Standard Organization (ISO) specifies the binders/additives level to be ≤ 4.0 wt% on a dry mass basis for the highest quality classes of thermally-treated wood pellets (i.e., TW1a and TW2b), shown in ISO/TS 17225–8:2016 [21]. In addition, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) specifies binders/additives level to be ≤ 3.0 wt% for torrefied wood pellets that need to be transported on marine vessels [34]. Combining these requirements with the observation that there was no difference between 5.0 wt% and 3.0 wt% PVA-EPC-Peptides addition in either density or breaking stress tests, 3.0 wt% of PVA-EPC-Peptides addition was applied for the following tests. 3.1.2 The impact of die temperature As one of the essential factors in pellet production, die temperature affects the mechanical linkages formed within the powders during the densification process and may lead to further cross-linking of binders and improved adhesion. In their respective studies of sawdust densification, Peng et al. and Verhoeff et al. found that the strength of the torrefied pellets increased with increasing die temperature [1,3]. Therefore, to study the impact of die temperature during the densification process, pellets were made using die temperatures ranging from 22 to 175 °C. The density and breaking stresses of both groups of pellets were then compared, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 , respectively. Consistent with the conclusion of Peng et al. and Verhoeff et al. [1,3], Fig. 5 indicated an improvement in the density of both torrefied wood pellets without a binder (control) and PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets with increasing die temperature. Moreover, due to the addition of PVA-EPC-Peptides, the density of the resulting pellets remained at a higher level than that of control pellets (Fig. 5), demonstrating the function of PVA-EPC-Peptides as an effective adhesive for density improvement. This improvement was mainly because of two mechanisms: physical property of PVA-EPC-Peptides and chemical binding. The physical property of PVA-EPC-Peptides, i.e. softness and mechanical binding, can help to increase pellet’s density at a low temperature (22 °C), which is 60 kg/m3 larger than the density of a control pellet. Due to the impact of temperature on torrefied wood pellets demonstrated by Peng et al. [1], the density difference between the control pellet and the PVA-EPC-Peptides pellet became smaller at 100 °C and 125 °C, which is around 20 kg/m3 shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, the density difference was increased to 50 kg/m3 when temperature reached 150 °C, indicating the formation of additional chemical binding during the densification process. However, in contrast to the positive effect of increasing die temperature on pellet density, the impact of temperature on pellet strength improvement peaked at a lower temperature (Fig. 6). In the radial compression test, the breaking stress of the control pellets stayed at the same level under the temperature range of 100–175 °C, while the breaking stress of PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets peaked at 150 °C and decreased at 175 °C (Fig. 6A). For the axial compression test, pellet strength for both control pellets and PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets peaked at 150 °C (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, at a die temperature of 150 °C, the radial and axial breaking stresses of the PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets were higher than those of the control pellets (Fig. 6A and B). This indicated a positive effect of the PVA-EPC-Peptides on pellet strength enhancement via introducing additional chemical binding among the torrefied wood particles. The formation of binding possibly happened at 125 °C to improve the axial pellet strength and peaked at 150 °C to increase the radial pellet strength. However, this speculation still needs to be proved in future experiments. Also, pellets started to break apart and became stuck in the die during densification at 200 °C, indicating that a high die temperature (≥175 °C) may not be suitable for this study. The bulk density of industrial standard of ISO 17828 is higher than 600 kg/m3 [39]. Assuming a 50% bulk porosity, the pellet density is estimated at about 1200 kg/m3. The 150 °C pelletization thus meets the standard requirement. 3.1.3 The impact of holding pressure As another essential factor for densification, the holding pressure represents the level of mechanical pressing force applied to form the shape of pellets in a single pelletizer. Thus, the holding pressure is expected to directly affect the pellets’ properties, especially their density and strength. By varying the holding pressure (50–350 MPa), a study for the impact of holding pressure on pellet density and strength was performed. It was observed in Fig. 7 that the density of the pellets increased as the holding pressure increased. This can be explained by the decrease in pellet length due to the increasing compression force applied by the pelletizer. Moreover, the density required by ISO 17828 [39] has been achieved by all the pellets when the holding pressure was ≥100 MPa. In addition, PVA-EPC-Peptides displayed an improvement in pellet density as compared to the pellets without a binder at the same holding pressure (Fig. 7). The breaking stresses of the pellets were also assessed, and showed that the radial (Fig. 8 A) and axial (Fig. 8B) breaking stresses of the both pellets (i.e., PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets and torrefied wood pellets without a binder) increased with increasing holding pressure until the pressure reached 250 MPa, which was consistent with the results achieved by Verhoeff et al. [3]. In addition, the breaking stresses of the pellets were maintained at a constant level at a pressure range of 250–350 MPa. Therefore, 250 MPa was chosen as the holding pressure for subsequent studies. Moreover, regarding the function of PVA-EPC-Peptides, both the radial and axial breaking stresses of the pellets made with this binder were higher than that of the pellets made only with torrefied wood at the same holding pressure (Fig. 8). These results further confirmed the strength enhancement of pellets generated using PVA-EPC-Peptides as a binder."
6,Moisture up-taking of torrefied wood pellets,"3.2 Moisture up-taking of torrefied wood pellets The moisture absorbed by the pellets during transportation and storage is directly related to the storage life of the pellets. A high moisture up-take level or hygroscopicity may loosen the inner structure of the pellets, resulting in a decrease in pellet density and strength. Also, the combustion process requires a limited level of moisture to maximize the energy output (≤10 wt% on wet basis [21]). Therefore, a relatively low level of moisture up-take is essential for production of torrefied wood pellets. For this study, powders were pelletized under the conditions identified in the previous section. Measuring the moisture up-take rate of each pellet revealed that it took more than 72 h for all the pellets to reach saturation, as shown in Fig. 9 . In addition, moisture up-take at saturation of the PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets remained at the same level as the pellets without a binder and the commercial pellets, indicating that the hygroscopicity of the pellets was not modified by PVA-EPC-Peptides. On the other hand, compared to pellets made with unmodified SRM-derived peptides, the moisture up-take of the PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets was lower. The possible reason for unchanged PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets’ moisture up-take is that the relatively high temperature and pressure provided by the pelletizer may lead to cross-linking between the hydroxyl groups and the carboxylic groups during the densification process. This would consume most of the hydrophilic groups in PVA-EPC-Peptides and could even provide some hydrophobic characteristics due to the formation of ester bonds. This possible feature helps PVA-EPC-Peptides pellets to retain the same level of moisture up-take as the pellets without a binder, which is desirable for the pellets industry. However, this speculation still needs to be proved in future experiments. It is worth mentioning that any small water droplets that condense on the to the plate may cause the moisture up-taking value to be overestimated. However, since all the pellets were tested simultaneously in the same chamber with the same lid model, the amount of excess moisture should be the same for each pellet. Therefore, the results from these analyses are still comparable and can be used to show any differences in water absorption behaviour."
7,Composition of torrefied wood pellets,"3.3 Composition of torrefied wood pellets 3.3.1 Elemental analysis of torrefied wood pellets Torrefied wood pellets made with and without binders (EPC-PVA-Peptides or SRM-derived peptides) were characterized with regards to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur (Table 2 ) to assess the effect of binders on the elemental content. The carbon and hydrogen content in the pellets generated with a binder, regardless of which binder, were statistically similar to those made without a binder (Table 2). Sulphur was not observed in any of the pellets. Conversely, the nitrogen content was increased in the pellets made with a binder since peptides, a nitrogen source, were introduced (Table 2). It is worth mentioning that the fuel specification standard of ISO 16948 for industrial torrefied wood pellets requires a maximum nitrogen content of 0.3 wt% for I1 and I2 classes, and 0.6 wt% for the I3 class [39]. Therefore, use of 3.0 wt% PVA-EPC-Peptides as a binder resulted in pellets that met the nitrogen requirement for the production of the I3 class of torrefied wood pellets. 3.3.2 Chlorine analysis of PVA-EPC-peptides and SRM-derived peptides Chlorine content is strictly limited in wood pellet production. During the combustion of pellets, the relatively high chlorine content is associated with a risk of instrument corrosion due to HCl emission. Therefore, ISO 16994 specifies that the chlorine content limits for the I3 class of industrial torrefied wood pellets is ≤ 0.1 wt% [39]. The chlorine content of the PVA-EPC-Peptides was determined through the ferrithiocyante method (EPA Method 325.2) and was quantified at 3.10 ± 0.1 wt%. Since the chlorine content of the torrefied wood powders is negligible (∼1.0 × 10−7 wt% [34]), addition of 3.0 wt% PVA-EPC-Peptides led to a total of 0.09 ± 0.00 wt% of chlorine in the pellets, which satisfied the chlorine standard of the I3 class of pellets."
8,Heating value of torrefied wood pellets,"3.4 Heating value of torrefied wood pellets The heating value or calorific value is one of the most important properties of pellets destined for fuel applications. It is directly related to the amount of energy released by the combustion of the pellets, which can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heating and electricity. The heating values of the pellets made with different binders were statistically similar, measured as 20.6 ± 0.1 MJ/kg for the pellets made with unmodified peptides and 20.5 ± 0.0 MJ/kg for the pellets made with PVA-EPC-Peptides. Moreover, 20.6 ± 0.1 MJ/kg was measured as the heating value of the pellets without a binder. This indicated that neither PVA-EPC-Peptides nor unmodified SRM-derived peptides affected the heat generation of the resulting pellets. In addition, the heating values of all the pellets satisfy the ISO/TS 17225–8 fuel specification standards for the industrial pellets of all classes (I1–I3), which is ≥ 16.5 MJ/kg [39]. Moreover, the heating value of all the pellets was close to that of coal (20–32 MJ/kg [7]), further confirming the potential of pellets as a substitute for coal."
9,Conclusions,"This study examined PVA-EPC-Peptides as a binder for the production of torrefied wood pellets: 1. PVA-EPC-Peptides can increase the density and the compression strength of pellets produced under preferred densification conditions. 2. 3.0 wt% binder level is suggested for PVA-EPC-Peptides usage. 3. The hydrophobicity of pellets was not affected by adding PVA-EPC-Peptides. 4. Pellets produced with 3.0 wt% PVA-EPC-Peptides met the requirements for the I3 class of industrial pellets with regards to density, nitrogen content, chlorine content and heating value. 5. PVA-EPC-Peptides is a cross-linked product generated from SRM-derived peptides, which are associated with a relatively low feedstock price. Thus, this study not only offered a promising and renewable binder for pellets production, but also prove a bio-conversion pathway of using proteinaceous waste for binder applications."
