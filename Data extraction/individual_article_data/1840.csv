0,Introduction,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, with an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. In 2020, the most common mortal cancers were lung (1.76 million deaths), colorectal (862,000 deaths), stomach (783,000 deaths), liver (782,000 deaths), and breast (627,000 deaths) (IARC, 2020). Unfortunately, treatment is limited due to the heterogeneous manifestations of the disease, dose-related toxicity, and side effects (Olov et al., 2018; Saklani and Kutty, 2008). A promising strategy to limit the adverse effects of these treatments is the implementation of a targeted therapy through the use of nanoparticles (NPs) and hydrogels, capable of encapsulating, protecting, transporting, and administering a therapeutic agent (Pandey et al., 2014).Encapsulated drug delivery systems also offer the possibility of liberation of adequate concentrations in localized areas, maximizing the effect against cancer cells while reducing the side effects and cytotoxicity in healthy cells. Although only a relatively small number have been approved, these are likely to be an increasing part of oncological therapies in the coming years (Iturrioz-Rodríguez et al., 2019; Sunderam et al., 2019). Now, there are 94 cancer treatment drug delivery systems approved for sale, 81 nanoparticles, and 13 hydrogels (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). The nanoparticles drug delivery systems (NDDS) include gold nanoparticles, oxide nanoparticles, nanoliposomes, collagen matrix (Rexin G), bioadhesive nanoparticles, super magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, stable nucleic acid nanoparticles and the albumin stabilized nanoparticles (Nab-paclitaxel) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Nowadays, the NDDS’s are used as alternatives of treatment for carcinomas of thyroid, lung, prostate, ovarian pancreatic, cervical, gastric skin, head and neck, brain, lymphoma sarcoma, and in a greater number of cases on breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). The results of clinical trials have suggested some advantages of NDDS's such as a higher response, longer time to tumor progression, and, in patients receiving second-line or greater therapy, a longer median survival (Tran et al., 2017; Yardley, 2013). For example, Nab-paclitaxel a formulation of paclitaxel in the presence of serum albumin in a nanoparticle colloidal suspension (average size of 130 nm), has the advantage in comparison with the application of Cremphor-EL-paclitaxel (Paclitaxel + 50% Cremophor EL (CrEL)/absolute ethanol) of a shorter infusion time (30 min), it no need for premedication for hypersensitivity reactions and utilizes the endogenous albumin transport mechanisms to concentrate nab-paclitaxel within the tumor (Chao et al., 2005; Stinchcombe, 2007). Another example is Rexin G target gene therapy, which is encapsulated in a collagen matrix nanoparticle and administered intravenously. It was the first approved therapy for clinical trials in the treatment of metastatic cancers. Rexin G accumulates in cancerous lesions, enhancing local drug concentration within tumors. It is used in the treatment of Sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and pancreatic cancer (Chawla et al., 2019). In the pharmaceutical area, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a biodegradable semicrystalline synthetic polymer, had been widely used to prepare solid dispersions in order to improve the solubility of drugs and prevent crystal transformation. Furthermore, the PVA is used as a granulating liquid to prevent nucleation, slow crystal growth and remove water excess by absorption (Gaaz et al., 2015; Vaidya et al., 2008). In addition, PVA has been used as an embolic agent since the 1970s and current intravascular use is primarily in the form of microparticles (Córdoba-Esquivel et al., 2019). Lately, the PVA in conjunction with their copolymers, had been used to control drug delivery, as it can be useful for both, hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. It is a common excipient for drugs administered by the ophthalmic, vaginal, and transdermal route and it is considered as non-toxic by oral administration because of its high median lethal doses [LD50] in rats (15–20 g/kg) (Gaaz et al., 2015; Marin et al., 2014). The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the uses of PVA as a component of biomaterials used in the fabrication of delivery systems nanoparticles, hydrogels, and nanocomposites used in cancer treatment. In addition, this review supplies novel information about the in-vitro and in-vivo biocompatible studies, and the state of art in the clinical trials that involve the PVA biomaterials before mentioned."
1,Polyvinyl alcoholproperties,"PVA is a synthetic polymer represented by the formula (C2H4O)n. According to the length of the initial vinyl acetate polymer and the degree of hydrolysis, the PVA products can have different molecular weights (20,000–400,000 g/mol). It is classified into two groups, partially hydrolyzed and fully hydrolyzed. PVA chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1 (Gao et al., 2010; Rowe et al, 2009; Song and Kim, 2004). PVA was initially obtained in 1924 by Hermann and Haehnel, after hydrolyzing polyvinyl acetate in ethanol with potassium hydroxide (Chemical and Technical Assessment 61st JECFA, 2004). In 1960, it was reported the preparation of PVA by alkaline catalyzed alcoholysis of methanol solutions of polyvinyl acetate at temperatures in the range between about 30 to 60 °C (Snyder, 1954). After, Inskip et al, (Marin et al., 2014), report an alkali-catalyzed alcoholysis of polyvinyl esters to produce polyvinyl alcohol with a better yield with the addition of formaldehyde before the alcoholysis. The aggregation of polycarboxylic acid was incorporated in order to neutralize the alkaline reaction, increasing the thermal stability of the PVA in 1973 (Subramanian, 1972). Nowadays PVA is produced commercially from polyvinyl acetate. The acetate groups are hydrolyzed by ester interchange with methanol in the presence of anhydrous sodium methylate or aqueous sodium hydroxide (Marin et al., 2014)."
2,Physico-chemical properties,"2.1 Physico-chemical properties Generally, PVA is soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol and insoluble in other organic solvents. It is tasteless and odorless. Other properties such as pH, viscosity, drying, melting point, refractive index, and residue on ignition are based on molecular weight and hydrolysis percentage. For example, the partially hydrolyzed PVA (87–89%) is more soluble in water and it has more flexibility and adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces. On the other hand, highly hydrolyzed PVA (91–99%) is more stable in the presence of organic solvents and has more tensile strength and adhesion onto hydrophilic surfaces (Rowe et al., 2009; Marin et al., 2014; Saxena, 2003). The specific values of PVA physico-chemical properties are shown in Table 1 . Hydroxyl groups of PVA produce inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. They have an important effect on the rheological and mechanical properties of the polymer, which is determined by the density and spatial arrangement of hydroxyl groups (Gao et al., 2010). These bonding are also responsible for phenomena such as phase separation and gelation, which means the solution properties are time-depending. Rheological and viscoelastic properties of the PVA solutions are affected by the effectiveness of the physical bonding and polymerization degree and the molecular orientation is developed easier by steady shear (Gao et al., 2010; Song and Kim, 2004). In addition, it has been demonstrated that PVA solutions in water are rheological heterogeneous. It measured the rheological properties of PVA with 1300, 1700, 2000, and 2400 degrees of saponification (transesterification reaction). It was found that with a higher saponification degree, the PVA solution exhibits greater values of the complex viscosity. Furthermore, PVA-1700, PVA-2000, and PVA-2400 solutions had a non-Newtonian flow behavior, while PVA-1300 showed an almost Newtonian behavior (Gao et al., 2010)."
3,PVA in biomedical area,"It is important that a polymeric drug delivery system overcomes all the limitations and disadvantages related to conventional therapeutic agents and must be biodegradable, biocompatible, and non-toxic. The most representative delivery systems are hydrogels, microparticles, and loaded polymeric nanoparticles. It has been proved that the individual properties of polymers are key for their use for specific targets (Hossen et al., 2019; Lagoa et al., 2020; Marin et al., 2014). In this regard, PVA is one of the most used polymers in the biomedical filed based on its mechanical properties, high ability to form films, nontoxicity, water-solubility, no carcinogenicity, hydrophilicity, good compatibility and biodegradability in human tissues and fluids (Hassan and Peppas, 2000; Luo et al., 2018; Rolim et al., 2019). As well PVA has three remarkable properties for a polymer to be used as a delivery system: high surface stabilization, chelation properties (Fatema et al., 2018; Kadhim et al., 2016)and low protein adsorption properties resulting in low cell adhesion compared with other hydrogels (Baker et al., 2012). All previous mentioned properties made that PVA would be extensively used in many biomedical applications, including wound dressings (Badawy, 2014; Fatema et al., 2018; He et al., 2017). A highlight is the use of PVA in many medical devices, including contact lenses, orthopedic devices and drug delivery systems, which had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Bolto et al., 2009; Bourke et al., 2003; Kobayashi et al., 2001; Yamagata et al., 1979; Yon et al., 1994). Also, PVA has been used in many non-implanted medical materials as a tissue adhesion barrier, to treat vascular embolism and to improve neurologic regeneration. Furthermore, it had been reported the use of PVA in implantable medical materials to replace meniscus tissues and cartilage. These varied applications of PVA have demonstrated its safety for human use, especially where the adsorption of host protein is unwanted (Baker et al., 2012). This review addresses the use of PVA as delivery systems for cancer treatment. It includes historical use of PVA as delivery system in cancer treatment, and in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility studies."
4,Hydrogels,"3.1 Hydrogels The hydrogels are cross-linked polymer particles with a high-water content and three-dimensional structure. They are biocompatible, and they had a swelling degree which allows drug delivery (Escalona Rayo et al., 2014). Drug delivery from hydrogels can be classified in diffusion-controlled, swelling-controlled, and chemical-controlled and it could be controlled by the response to the external stimuli like pH, temperature, ionic strength, and electric field (Maya et al., 2013). An example of the release for stimuli is schematized in Fig. 2 . The hydrogels can be classified into crystalline, semi-crystalline and amorphous (non-crystalline), depending on the chemical composition and their physical structure. There are two methods used for hydrogel preparation, chemical (radical polymerization, chemical reaction with functional groups, irradiation with high energy, and reaction with the enzyme) and physical methods (hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, molecular entanglements, or physical interaction) (Ghawanmeh et al., 2019). 3.1.1 Methods of synthesis of PVA hydrogels Synthesis of hydrogels is based on cross-linking networks and can be classified into three main categories, physically cross-linked (self-assembled hydrogel), chemically cross-linked and cross-linking by irradiation (Sharma and Tiwari, 2020). 3.1.1.1 Physically cross-linked hydrogels The physically cross-linked is a reversible method of hydrogels formation, where the network formation is only physical. Recently, it has been increased interest in them, because of their relatively easy synthesis and their main advantage of avoiding toxic residues by keep away the use of cross-linking agents during their synthesis process (Sharma and Tiwari, 2020). The principle of physically cross-linked is based on the physical interactions (hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding) between the different polymer chains as well as, for example, proteins interactions (Parhi, 2017). The protein interaction involves block copolymers, which can be crystallized in physiological conditions, and determine film network formation and properties (Husain et al., 2018; Maitra and Kumar Shukla, 2014). These physical and protein interactions can be destabilized by variations in pH, ionic strength, or temperature. For example, Xu et al., 2018 report a protein engineered multinetwork physical hydrogel conformed by tannic acid (TA), PVA and bovine serum albumin (BSA). They treat a PVA/BSA solution by the freeze-thaw method and forms the first hydrogel network. Then, the TA was added, and a secondary hydrogel network based on the noncovalent interaction (hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction) was formed. This hydrogel shows high mechanical strength, good water- retention ability, and the mechanical property of hydrogel can be well-regulated by varying the concentration of TA and BSA proteins. The most common methods reported for obtaining physically cross-linked hydrogels are freeze-thawing (crystallization) (Sanchez et al., 2019) stereo complex formation (Wang et al., 2019), charge interaction (Drozdova et al., 2017) and hydrogen bonding (Parhi, 2017; Xu et al., 2018). Especially, crystallization is a widely used method for the synthesis of PVA hydrogels. This method consists of the formation of microcrystals and hydrogen bonding interactions in the polymer structure due to the exposure of PVA solutions to cycles of freezing-thawing. The properties of these PVA hydrogels formed will depend on the number of freeze-thaw cycles, the concentration of the polymer solution, the molecular weight of PVA, the temperature (generally −20 °C) and time of the freezing (Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2020). For example, (Sanchez et al., 2019) synthetized an eco-friendly hydrogel based on PVA and different contents of acid-treated bentonite (1–5 wt%). The freezing–thawing method was chosen because it is a non-toxic technique. In the case of the stereo complex formation method, the hydrogels are formed by a crosslinking between lactic acid oligomers of opposite chirality (Maitra and Kumar Shukla, 2014). Wang et al., 2019 fabricated an advanced injectable thermogel formed by poly(ethylene glycol)–polylactide (PEG–PLA) modified with cholesterol by stereo complex formation method. The hydrogel shows higher mechanical strength, lower critical gelation temperature, better chondrocyte adhesion, larger pore size, and slower degradation, compared with the PEG-PLA hydrogel. On the other hand, the hydrogels synthetized by charge interactions are based on the use of amphiphilic blocks or graft copolymers which contain different segments of hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature which result in swelling and uptaking water that forms the hydrogel (Maitra and Kumar Shukla, 2014). For example, Drozdova et al., 2017 synthetized hydrogels based on low molecular weight acrylated PVA copolymerized with either negatively charged acrylic acid (AA) or positively charged 2-(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA) monomers. The structure of the obtained hydrogels was studied in function of the co-monomer content and it was concluded that the proposed modifications improved cell adhesion (mouse fibroblast and human mesenchymal stem cells), spreading and proliferation. Finally, the hydrogen bonding method consists of the interaction of the hydrogen bonds, formed after the protonation of carboxylic acid groups at a low pH. This method, brings the characteristic of show pH-dependent swelling in hydrogels and it is used for the improvement of the physical and mechanical strength (Husain et al., 2018). For example, Liu et al. (2020) developed a hydrogel composed of PVA and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). This material was prepared by immersing a PVA hydrogel into an aqueous PAA solution, forming the H-bonds between the PAA and PVA chains. The facility of breakage and reformation of H-bonding bring to the hydrogel network a very effective energy-dissipating mechanism. The application proposed for these hydrogels are in biomaterials, sensors, and actuators, soft machines, and flexible electronics Another example, are the pH-responsive supramolecular hydrogels based on PVA with small phenolic biomolecules synthesized by (Euti et al., 2019). The structure and type of functional groups of different phenolic molecules allow the formation of hydrogen bonding, which provided them the characteristics of controlled low phase transition temperature, and pH-dependent swelling behavior. Some of the applications proposed for these hydrogels include the 3D bioprinting and topical drug delivery of thermolabile biomolecules. Nowadays, this pH-dependent swelling characteristic in hydrogels is already explored in the oncologic area for the creation of smart materials for drug delivery (Fan et al., 2019). 3.1.1.2 Chemically cross-linked hydrogels The chemically cross-linked hydrogels are formed by polymer networks cross-linked by covalent bonds between pendant hydroxyl (–OH) groups present in PVA chains. They are stable, possess a higher mechanical strength than physical hydrogels and cannot be dissolved (Wang et al., 2018). The chemically cross-linked hydrogels can be synthetized by chemical reaction of complementary groups, where covalent bonds between polymer chains of hydrogels can be created by the reaction of their functional groups with crosslinker agent, such as N, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N0-ethyl carbodiimide, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), borates, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde and other monoaldehydes, in conjugation with either methanol, acetic acid or sulfuric acid (Kumar and Han, 2017; Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2020). However, this chemically crosslinking has the disadvantage of the production of toxic radicals and monomers, which make these hydrogels unacceptable for biomedical applications (Kumar and Han, 2017; Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2020). For example, Liu et al. (2020), design an ethylene glycol/PVA hydrogel to be used in a highly compressible and superior low temperature tolerant supercapacitor. This hydrogel shows a significant improvement of compressive stress (15.5 MPa), excellent shape recovery property and high ionic conductivity (0.48 S m−1). In another research, a chemical-physical crosslinked triple-network hydrogel was prepared using PVA, poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP) and AA as raw materials. This hydrogel showed a fracture stress of 1.87 MPa, strain rate of 175%, and compressive stress of 3.5 MPa under 80% compressive deformation. The application proposed for this hydrogel is to develop a supercapacitor for compression-resistant electronics (Li et al., 2019). An alternative method to produce chemically cross-linked hydrogels is the chain-growth polymerization, which includes anionic and cationic polymerization, free radical polymerization and controlled free radical polymerization (Ogbeide Ebhodaghe, 2020). This method is performed in three steps process, initiation, propagation, and termination, where a free radical active site is created where monomers are added in a chain form (Maitra and Kumar Shukla, 2014). Another method to produce chemically cross-linked hydrogels is the enzymatic reaction, which requires slight reaction conditions, such as neutral pH, aqueous environment and mild temperature (Nguyen et al., 2015; Ogbeide Ebhodaghe, 2020). Some of the most used enzymes are horseradish peroxidase, tyrosinase, transglutaminase, lysyl oxidase and, phosphopantetheinyl transferase. This method has the main advantage of the substrate specificity of the enzyme, which can prevent toxicity caused by side reactions (Nguyen et al., 2015). 3.1.1.3 High-energy irradiation hydrogels Finally, hydrogels could be synthesized by the high-energy irradiation with gamma or electron beam as well (Ogbeide Ebhodaghe, 2020). This method allows the creation of radicals in the polymer chain of hydrogel inducing the formation of covalent bonds between their functional groups without the addition of a crosslinker. Gamma and electron beam polymerizations implicates the initiation, propagation, and termination steps similar to the radical polymerization. The process begins when the hydroxyl radicals are created and start free radical polymerization between the vinyl monomers which proliferate in a quick chain addition. The hydrogel is synthetized once the network reaches the critical gelation point (abrupt change in viscosity) (Maitra and Kumar Shukla, 2014; Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2020). The main advantages of this method, are the control of pore size of hydrogels by varying the irradiation dose and the possibility to perform at room temperature and in physiological pH (Maitra and Kumar Shukla, 2014; Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2020). For example, Khozemy et al. (2019) synthetized a crosslinked hydrogel composite membrane based on PVA, vitamin E and chitosan-loaded AgNO3 using gamma irradiation for potential use in wound dressings. It was found that increase of the irradiation dose improves radical formation in the reaction mixture. For consequence, more crosslinking occurred with a higher gelation percent. In other study, a Zinc oxide (ZnO)/PVA hydrogel was created using gamma irradiation for being used in drug release. It was found that interaction between ZnO with the hydroxyl group of the PVA produce a decrease in the equilibrium degree of swelling percentage in the ZnO/PVA hydrogel nanocomposites in comparison with pure PVA hydrogel (Kumaraswamy et al., 2017). Nowadays, the existence of diverse synthesis techniques, allows the generation of a great variability of hydrogels, with different characteristics and applications. Specially, the biomedical area has become in a tendency for the innovation procedures of synthesis. 3.1.2 Use of PVA hydrogels for cancer treatment Because of its controlled release applications, and the kinetics of the entrapped drugs which can be monitored by the regulation of the water uptake of the polymer or by crosslinking it, PVA hydrogels have become a tendency as potential cancer treatment for different tissues (Chao et al., 2020). For that reason, numerous studies are underway in human cancer cells lines, as it is shown in Table 2 . The studies show promising preliminary results, and more test are required to determine other parameters such as human doses and best administration route."
5,Microparticles,"3.2 Microparticles Microparticles are characterized by their size, which is ranging from 50 μm to 1200 μm. They have become a trend in material research due to their simplicity and versatility. Nowadays, microparticles from different materials already exist in the market for different therapeutic applications(Luz et al., 2020; Piacentini et al., 2020). Nevertheless, microparticles synthesized from PVA (commonly called drug eluting beads (DEBs) have been specially put in the light because of their clinical use in the unresectable hepatocellular cancer treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). The PVA microspheres have been synthesized towards nucleophilic substitution reaction with carbonyl diimidazole or carbodiimide. They are conformed by functional groups on a preformed crosslinked PVA hydrogel (Dreher et al., 2014). These microspheres are capable of being loaded with specific therapeutic agents and then deliver a high intratumoral drug concentration while reducing plasma drug levels, reducing systemic toxicity. Their therapeutic function is the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and generate ischemia, resulting in tumoral necrosis (Sottani et al., 2012). The most commercially available microspheres are from Merit medical, Boston Scientific, and Biocompatible UK laboratories, which are used in process such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), targeting intratumoral lactic acidosis (TILA) and drug-eluting bead (DEB). The microparticles characteristics are shown in Table 3 . Since the microparticles shown in Table 2 have been approved by FDA a long time ago, (“510(k) Premarket Notification,” n.d.), they are the most used in clinical practice. Exist in numerous studies where a comparison is made, between them and other materials, showing the advantages and disadvantages of each one (Bishay et al., 2014; Spies et al., 2004). However, nowadays the researchers are focusing on the replication microparticles drug delivery system, but in the nanoscale. 3.2.1 Methods of synthesis of PVA particles Some of the techniques used to prepare micro and nanoparticles include the single emulsion, double emulsion, coacervationand spraying drying. The single emulsion, also known as the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion or solvent extraction, it is a common method used to form drug encapsulated polymeric microspheres for pharmaceutical purposes. The process consists of forming the microsphere, dissolving the polymer in an organic solvent with the drug to be encapsulated. This combination is added to an aqueous solution containing a stabilizer (PVA) and after they are homogenized. The organic solvent is then removed by evaporation and the drug encapsulated microspheres are recovered. A variation of the single emulsion method can use an acetone/mineral oil emulsion instead of the organic and water system (Floyd et al., 2015). The double emulsion known as the water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion, allows the efficient encapsulation of hydrophilic compounds. The process consists in the dissolution of the drug to be encapsulated in a small volume of water and the later addition of an organic solution, containing the dissolved polymer. This is emulsified and produces the first water-in-oil emulsion (W/O). The first W/O emulsion is then added to an aqueous phase, containing PVA, forming a double emulsion of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W). Finally, the organic solvent is evaporated, and the microspheres are recovered. The most used solvents are chloroform and dichloromethane (DCM). In addition, co-solvents, as methanol, can be added (Floyd et al., 2015; Paulo and Santos, 2019). The coacervation, also called phase separation, this technique involves the dissolution of the polymer in an organic non-solvent that contains the drug to be encapsulated. This mixture is added to a vegetable oil to induce polymer phase separation. Then, the polymer-solvent is extracted before hexane or heptane is added to achieve the final sphere hardening, Finally, the microspheres are collected and washed (Floyd et al., 2015). This technique does not have the requirement of complex machines in high-pressure homogenization or high temperatures to melt the lipid matrix (Chirio et al., 2011). The spraying drying is a well-established method of powder preparation from a liquid phase for a wide range of drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. In this technique, the polymer and drug are dissolved in a solvent and passed through a spray dryer. A stream of heated air breaks the polymer solution into droplets, forming microspheres that are dried and collected (Chirio et al., 2011; Sham et al., 2004). Its main advantages are the particle formation in a single-step continuous and scalable process and the manipulation of the process parameters (Lee et al., 2011). In addition, results suggest that the incorporation of PVA in the particle formulation from microscale to nanoscale range process may lead to the formation of mucoadhesive particles for many nanoparticulate systems (Yang et al., 2014). 3.2.2 Use of microparticles of PVA for cancer treatment Until now, the most used form of PVA in the treatment of cancer is the microparticles. TACE, TILA and DEB are used alone or in conjunction as an alternative of treatment in gastrointestinal, liver, hepatocellular, thorax, peritoneal and uterine cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020?). Nowadays, the brands commercially available have been used specially to treat the unresectable liver cancer ( Table 4 ). For example, it was reported a study which evaluated safety and efficacy of TACE-DEB PVA microparticles loaded with doxorubicin in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The results show a partial response of (10%), and the maintain a stable disease of (90%). Treated tumors demonstrated a mean decrease in contrast enhancement of 64% (P < 0.0001). Non-present progression of a treated lesion while undergoing treatment. At 6 months, the disease control rate was 95%; median overall survival was 26 months (Reyes et al., 2009). The efficiency of PVA microparticles has also been compared with other materials. For example, Shlansky-Goldberg et al., 2014 publish an study with the objective of make a comparison between spherical PVA microsphere (SPVA) (size 700–900 μm and 900–1,200 μm) with tris-acryl gelatin (TAG) microsphere (size 500–700 μm) used for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids with uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). The study shows that both products have an equal reduction in the symptom severity and the improvement of quality of life at 3 and 12 months. Complications were minor in both groups. Because of the promising preliminary results, the use of PVA microparticles had become an important research line, which according to the base data of the National Institute of Cancer exist thirty-two clinical trials using PVA for oncological purposes."
6,Nanoparticles,"3.3 Nanoparticles Nanoparticles are systems that range in size from 1 to 300 nm and contain a therapeutic agent. They can be synthesized from a diversity of substances, such as polymers, lipids, ceramics, and carbon nanotubes. Polymer nanoparticles are stable and allow high loading of agents, which brings the opportunity to control the drug release kinetics and displays a variety of surface-attached ligands (Feng et al., 2010). For example, silk/PVA nanoparticles could be loaded with a therapeutic drug and show pH-dependent release in-vitro. It had been reported a new aqueous-based method of preparation, called polyvinyl alcohol blends, used for silk spheres synthesis with controllable size and shape. In these systems, the drug distribution and loading efficiency depend on their hydrophobicity and charge, which leads to different drug release profiles (Cao et al., 2017). The PVA is widely used as a surfactant during particle formulation by the nanoprecipitation or emulsion methods leads to the formation of nanoparticles (Yang et al., 2014) and to encapsulate metallic nanoparticles (Khanna et al., 2005). Some examples of this formulation are shown in Fig. 3 . Synthesis methods of nanoparticles are similar to synthesis methods of microparticles, for example PLGA/PVA nanoparticles used to control the delivery of doxorubicin are made by single emulsion (Siddharth et al., 2017). Another example is the use of double emulsion technique to synthesize drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles for intracranial tumor therapy, encapsulating chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil, camptothecin, imatinib mesylate, C-terminal fragment of platelet factor 4 (PF-4/CTF), hemopexin (PEX), doxorubicin, radio iodinated IUdR, antisense oligonucleotides, and mitoxantrone (Floyd et al., 2015). Also Spray drying technique has been successfully used to encapsulate paclitaxel and doxorubicin in PLA/PVA and PLGA/PVA nanoparticles for brain tumor treatment (Floyd et al., 2015). 3.3.1 Use of PVA nanoparticles for cancer treatment Although clinical trials have shown some chemotherapies as a safe drug even at high doses, poor bioavailability and suboptimal pharmacokinetics largely moderated its anti-cancer activity in pre-clinical and clinical models (Yallapu et al., 2010). In recent years, polymeric nanoparticles have become the most promising and viable technology platform for targeted and controlled drug delivery systems for anti-cancer drugs. They accumulate in cancer tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention effect, reducing the toxicity in non-target tissues, and protecting drugs from preliminary inactivation (Pieper et al., 2019). The nanoparticles should possess high drug loading levels, deliver drugs to the specific pathological site, and target cells without drug leakage on the way (Cheng et al., 2013). Nanoparticles with a hydrophobic surface are early absorbed by the liver, spleen, and lungs, while those with a hydrophilic surface show an increased circulation time in the body (Cheng et al., 2013). Regarding PVA nanoparticles, they have become a tendency in cancer treatment for different tissues because of the relatively low cost and high biocompatibility (Pieper et al., 2019). For example, Yallapu et al. (2010) developed PLGA nanoparticles, in the presence of PVA and PLL stabilizers, using a nanoprecipitation technique to encapsulate curcumin to improve its applicability in cancer therapy. In this study nanoparticles demonstrated two and sixfold increases in the cellular uptake performed in cisplatin-resistant A2780CP ovarian and metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, respectively, compared to free curcumin. Also, Hu et al. (2008) report the synthesis of a self-assembled PVA-Iron oxide/silica core-shell nanocarriers for the controlled release of therapeutic agents by an external magnetic field. The nanoparticles present a high-efficiency uptake by HeLa cervical cancer cells and exhibit excellent cytocompatibility, implying the nanoparticles are potentially capable of offering highly efficient and accurate release of therapeutic agents for anti-cancer applications. In addition, De Patricio et al. (2014) prepared PLA/PVA nanoparticles charged with Phosphorus-32 orthophosphate, strontium-89 Chloride, and ethylenediamine-tetra-methylenephosphonic acid (EDTMP) using a double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Nanoparticles were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), showing spherical in shape with a heterogeneous surface and with a size ranging from 200 to 500 nm. After an in-vivo study of biodistribution was performed in rats, it was observed that they have controlled-release and greater stability than the administration of EDTMP alone. Some examples of in-vitro studies which use chemotherapy encapsulated in nanoparticles with PVA, are shown in Table 5 . Although there exist a growing number of in-vitro studies of nanoparticles synthesized with PVA, nowadays, there does not exist PVA nanoparticles charged with anticancer encapsulated drugs in the market."
7,Biocompatibility and routes of administration/ adsorptionof PVA compounds,"In humans, several evidence support the biocompatibility of PVA since the late 1980s (Hulman and Kirkham, 2007; Lanman et al., 1988) and some biomedical application includes ophthalmic solutions containing 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol of tear replacement solutions without experiencing any ocular discomfort (Fassihi and Naidoo, 1989). In this decade, it had increased the number of studies where PVA hydrogels are used with biomedical applications, such as replacing part of the articular cartilage (Yuan et al., 2013) a tissue sealant in a polymeric hydrogel therapy for advanced emphysema (Ingenito, 2013), wound dressing containing healing agents (Nasef et al., 2019) and wound dressings which absorb wound fluid and act as an effective barrier against secondary infections (Singh et al., 2016). More applications include drug delivery in wound dressing (Hamedi et al., 2018), drug delivery systems to enhance the delivery of antimicrobials for the treatment chronic infections (Wan et al., 2015), drug delivery of insulin as a part of diabetes therapying in animals models (Cai et al., 2016). Because of its biocompatibility, PVA has been widely used as an excipient in biomedical and pharmaceutical drug delivery systems administered by ophthalmic, vaginal, and transdermal routes (Gaaz et al., 2015). Thus far, some studies for cell absorption are described for epithelial lung cells and cancer cells. Because of the highly glycosylated segments interspersed by hydrophobic, lipid-coated domain, present in mucus, PVA particles could be trapped through steric obstruction and adhesion of constituents through hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions (Yang et al., 2014), however, Madlova et al. (2009) confirmed qualitatively by confocal images that PVA nanoparticles are internalized by epithelial lung cells, independently of surface charge, or particle hydrophobicity. Concerning PVA absorption by cancer cells, the mechanism depends on particle properties. For example, Rejman et al. (2004), showed that bigger particles (>200 nm) are mainly internalized via clathrin-coated pits, while small particles with (<200 nm) are absorbed via caveolae-mediated endocytosis by skin cancer cells. This biological process is shown in Fig. 4 . Evaluation of potential oral toxicity of PVA and its intravenous injection pharmacokinetics had been tested in animal models in past decades (DeMerlis and Schoneker, 2003; Kaneo et al., 2005; Kelly et al., 2003; Rodwell et al., 2003). Thus, the potential systemic and neurotoxicity of PVA was assessed when fed in the diet rats (Kelly et al., 2003). It was not found evidence of reproductive, neurological or systemic toxicity after 70 and 90 days; moreover, it was not observed alterations in macro- and microscopic examinations, mortality, motor activity, ophthalmology, hematology, clinical chemistry, organ weights, urinalysis, and functional observation assessments. The no-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was very high, stablished on 5000 mg/kg/day in this study (Kelly et al., 2003). In another study it was determined the oral LD50 of PVA of 10 g/kg body weight in male albino rats (Nair, 1998). Regarding oral toxicity of PVA, a review revealed that acute oral toxicity of PVA is very low and it is very poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; moreover, the compound does not accumulate in the body when administered orally and does not display a mutagenic or clastogenic effect (DeMerlis and Schoneker, 2003). Furthermore, 98% of PVA is excreted in feces and 0.2% in urine (DeMerlis and Schoneker, 2003). Other pharmacokinetics and biodisposition studies indicate that PVA disappears slowly from the blood circulation with a half-life of 7 h after intravenous injection (Kaneo et al., 2005). Moreover, its presence in blood circulation, in tissue distribution and, the urinary and fecal excretions suggest that PVA is eliminated exclusively by the mechanisms that do not involve saturable transport processes (Kaneo et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2012). Furthermore, it was found that PVAs are very stable in the body because no degradation product was detected in the urine and feces (Kaneo et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2012). Moreover, the participation of parenchymal, Kupper, and endothelial liver cells was suggested in the clearance of PVAs after intravenous injection in mice (Kaneo et al., 2005), indicating that liver is the main site of accumulation after administration of PVA-based nanocarriers (Sun et al., 2012). Regarding genotoxicity, Ames test using some Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains indicate there is no evidence of mutagenicity (Nair, 1998). Furthermore, tests in animals, showed no evidence of carcinogenic activity of PVA (Nair, 1998). At cellular level some studies evaluated the putative toxicity effects of nanoparticles PVA coated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) on some human cell lines (Schulze et al., 2014; Strehl et al., 2015). Results showed any observable toxic effects to human mesenchymal stromal cells and immune cells (Schulze et al., 2014; Strehl et al., 2015). Despite the PVA coated nanoparticles increased the migration of mesenchymal stromal cells (Schulze et al., 2014) and promoted cell differentiation and increased survival of immune cells (Strehl et al., 2015). It is not clear whether the effect on these phenotypes can be due to the SPION nanoparticles coated with PVA or to the PVA (Schulze et al., 2014; Strehl et al., 2015). Regarding toxicity to the environment and, since PVA, widely used in many industrial applications, can result in the release of harmful heavy metals from sediments (Giroto et al., 2006), several studies had evaluated the efficiency of its degradation by several methods (Chou et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2017); some of them include the combination of UV/chlorine oxidation working in synergy for effective degradation (Ye et al., 2017). In summary, for years PVA has been widely used in many products without any report of damage. The safety and biocompatibility of PVA had been demonstrated in different studies in animals and currently there are many clinical trials using PVA microparticles for cancer treatment. At this moment, several evidence of the use of PVA nanoparticles charged with drug for cancer support a promising technology platform that offer a highly efficient therapeutic agent."
8,PVA future trend forecast,"The application of PVA in the synthesis and development of nanomaterials for drug delivery in the oncological area had been historically applied. However, the recent advances in biomedicine have led to the discovery of new molecules for therapeutic purposes such as growth factors, proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids which need a more highly developed drug delivery system. For that reason, the design of new pharmaceutical excipients and their delivery systems, which can increase the drug specificity while reducing possible side effects, are a very important aspect for future enhancement. Numerous developments are being researched in the area of smart nanomaterials, self-assembled hydrogels, and the combined approaches using microengineering and 3D matrices in order to generate safer and custom drug delivery systems."
9,Conclusion,"Cancer is one of the most challenging and deadliest illnesses in the world with the disadvantage of non-standard treatment because of its heterogeneous manifestations. The polymeric materials have become a promising research area, because they bring the possibility of encapsulating, protecting, transporting and administering a therapeutic agent. Specially, PVA and its properties have been deeply studied, since the PVA is a traditional material used as an excipient in numerous pharmaceutical formulas. PVA is commonly used in conjunction with other polymers or materials with the purpose of enhancing the composite properties and improving its absorption.It has been demonstrated that PVA is highly biocompatible and non-toxic in in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Nowadays the PVA is widely used in many products without any report of damage. The most representative use of PVA in drug delivery systems include hydrogel, microparticles and loaded nanoparticles. However, only the microparticles synthesized from PVA are available in the market. They have been specially used in the unresectable hepatocellular cancer treatment. Nevertheless, the hydrogels have become in a tendency in research because of its controlled delivery applications, as well as the kinetics of the entrapped drugs. In a similar way, the nanoparticles have been put in the light because of their enhanced permeability and retention effect. The widespread review of the literature in this article resumes the data available of state of art of PVA based-drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. We conclude that PVA is a promising material, which has demonstrated its safety, biocompatibility and non-toxicity properties to be a suitable material to be used in oncological area."
