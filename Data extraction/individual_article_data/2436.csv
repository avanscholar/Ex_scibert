0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a promising candidate as a clean energy carrier of the future [1–3]. Microbial hydrogen production has been suggested as an attractive process for hydrogen generation. A lot of basic studies have been reported for creating renewable hydrogen production systems through either photosynthesis or anaerobic fermentation [4–6]. Hydrogen production by fermentative bacteria is technically simpler than that by photosynthetic bacteria. Also, the fermentation process could generate hydrogen from carbohydrate-rich wastes. Food waste is a carbohydrate-rich waste, which represents one of the most important organic wastes generated by our society. As food waste has a high energy content, it seems ideal to achieve dual benefits to energy recovery and waste stabilization. Especially, hydrogen production from food waste has considerable potential to enhance the economic feasibility of waste treatment. Hydrogen production from organic waste is usually accompanied by the production of organic acids that are suitable substrates for methane production. Methane production is, therefore, considered as a suitable unit of post-treatment of hydrogen production. Recently, a two-stage process combining acidogenic hydrogenesis and methanogenesis has been focused [6,7]. It is known that hydraulic retention times (HRTs) for hydrogen and methane production from organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) are 1–2 days and 10–15 days, respectively [8–10]. That is, the volume of reactor for methane production is about eight times as large as that of hydrogen production. Therefore, it is important and necessary to develop the high-rate methane production from OFMSW. An up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) process is an extensively applied anaerobic treatment system with high treatment efficiency and a short HRT, but it is not suitable for high solid waste. If a solid residue is physically removed, the separation process is needed, and it complicates the process. It is well known that hydrogen yield is affected by environmental factors such as pH, temperature etc. The optimum pH range of hydrogen production is 5.5–6.0 and NaOH was added for pH adjustment [11–14]. It was also reported that thermophilic hydrogen production is more efficient [6,15–17], and mesophilic methane production was appropriate because the ammonia inhibition is prevented [18]. Based on the above information, we developed a pH- and temperature-phased two-stage process combined by a thermophilic hydrogen production reactor and a mesophilic methane production reactor with internal recirculation of the digested sludge from methanogenic reactor to hydrogen production reactor. The objectives of this work were (1) to show the feasibility of using this new process to produce hydrogen and methane from food wastes without adding any reagents, (2) to show the feasibility of adding suspended media to mesophilic methane production reactor for shorting the HRT, and (3) to evaluate the operational performance of the process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock and seed organisms,"2.1 Feedstock and seed organisms Food waste collected from a dining hall (National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan) was used as the substrate of this study. It was mainly composed of grains, vegetables, meat and fish. According to the average of six times measurement, total solid (TS) of raw food waste was 33.8%, and 92% of TS was volatile. The volatile solid (VS) contains 55–69% of carbohydrate and 37–44% of protein. To make the feedstock for the experiment, raw food waste was shredded with a cut-pump and then diluted with water. The mixing ratio of raw food waste to water was 1–1.4 (w/w). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the diluted food waste with TS concentration of 10.7–12.8%. This feedstock was made once a week and then stored in the mixing tank at 5°C. Acidification happened slowly and pH dropped from 5.1 to 4.3 and VFA increased from 5.4g/l to 27.2g/l. Among them, net lactate, acetate and n-butyrate increases were 15.8g/l, 3.9g/l and 2.3g/l, respectively. Indicating pH decrease was mainly due to lactate fermentation. An anaerobic digester sludge obtained from a wastewater treatment plant was used as seed organism both for thermophilic hydrogen production reactor and mesophilic methanogenic reactor. These seeds have been sufficiently adapted to the organic waste for over 2 years in another experiment of high solid digestion, before being used for this study."
3,Experimental setup and operation,"2.2 Experimental setup and operation Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus used in this study. The apparatus was composed of four parts including mixing tank, thermophilic hydrogen production reactor (55°C), mesophilic filter methane production reactor (35°C), and digested sludge storage tank. The first part is a mixing tank for shredding organic wastes and also for making uniformly high solid slurry. The well-mixed fluid slurry in the mixing tank was then fed to the second part, which was a thermophilic acidogenic hydrogen production reactor with an effective volume of 10l. The third tank was a mesophilic methanogenic reactor with an effective volume of 40l, in which suspended media (HP-60, Takiron Co. Ltd., polyethylene, midair cylinder reticulation, ∅ 28mm×28mm, specific gravity 0.96, and specific surface area 330m2/m3) was added in volume ratio of 30% for enhancing methane production. The fourth tank was a storage tank of digester sludge, in which precipitated sludge at the bottom was recirculated to the hydrogen production reactor for maintaining a stable pH. The temperature of each reactor was maintained with water jackets surrounding the reactors connected to a water bath. A gas meter was installed in each reactor to record gas amount automatically. The pH was automatically controlled to 5.5±0.1 in the hydrogen production reactor, which was equipped with a pH controller. The feedstock was fed into the reactor six times a day by roller pump with a timer. The HRTs of hydrogen production reactor and methane production reactor were 3.8 and 15.1 days in the bases of the process influent, respectively. Recirculation rate, which means the volume of circulating digested sludge to that of influent, was 2. The actual HRTs of hydrogen and methane reactors in the recirculation base were calculated as 1.3 and 5.0 days, respectively (Table 2 ). The experiment was continued for 150 days. At the beginning of the experiment, the seed organisms without any pre-treatment were added to the hydrogen and methane production reactors to fill half of the effective volume, and the other half was filled with the substrate in the hydrogen production reactor. The atmosphere of the reactor was exchanged by nitrogen gas. After 1–2 days, gas production was confined from the reactor, rather than continuously fed into the reactor as it was initially. In order to prevent the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation in the methanogenic reactor at short HRT of 5 days, twice HRTs (2g 6.3 days as shown in Table 2) were operated at the first month. The steady-state condition (pH over 7.2 and VFA less than 1000mg/l) was confined from the methanogenic reactor, rather than HRT indicated in Table 2 were operated. The digested sludge was recirculated into the hydrogen reactor for pH adjustment."
4,Methods of analysis,"2.3 Methods of analysis The proportions of H2, CH4, N2 and CO2 in the biogas were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co. Ltd.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The stainless steel column was packed with Shimalite Q. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a pressure of 5kg/cm2. The operational temperatures of the oven and detector were 100°C and 120°C, respectively. The concentrations of the VFAs and alcohols were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC14B, Shimadzu Co. Ltd.) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Stabiliwax-DA was used for the column and helium for the carrier gas with a detector temperature being of 280°C. The analysis was carried out according to the column temperature ramp program (100°C, 2min; 8°C/min; 250°C, 7min; 280°C for VFAs, 40°C, 6min; 20°C/min; 100°C, 2min; 280°C for alcohols). The concentration of lactate was determined using a liquid chromatograph (LC-10AD, Shimadzu Co. Ltd.) equipped with an ultraviolet detector. COSMOSIL 5C18-AR-II was used for the column, and 0.05M phosphoric acid buffer liquid (50mM NaH2PO4:50mM H3PO4 =9:1, pH 3) for the carrier liquid. The analysis was carried out at a detector temperature of 40°C, flow velocity of 1.0ml/ml, and UV 210nm. The pH was determined using a pH meter (TOA, Co. Ltd.) equipped with a GST-5721C probe. The concentrations of total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), suspended solids (SS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), and CODCr were determined according to the procedures described in Standard Methods [19]. The carbohydrate concentration was measured according to the phenol–sulfuric acid method, using glucose as the standard [20]. Protein concentration was measured by Lowry method [21]. T-N, NH4-N were analyzed using the automatic analyzer Traacs 2000 (Bran+Luebble K.K., Japan)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Biogas production,"3.1 Biogas production Fig. 2 shows the time course of the biogas production in the thermophilic hydrogen production reactor. Biogas production rate was stable at 10.4l/l/d. The biogas was mainly composed of H2 and CO2. The contents of H2 and CO2 in biogas were 52–56% and 41–47%, respectively. No CH4 was detected in hydrogen production stage. As mentioned above, lactate fermentation happened in the mixing tank. It has been reported that the lactate production has an inhibitory effect on hydrogen production [22]. It has also been reported that the effect of lactic acid bacteria on hydrogen production depends on pH and temperature, the inhibition effect on hydrogen-producing bacteria can be prevented by keeping the pH at over 5.0 [12] or temperature over 50°C [22]. In this study, pH was adjusted to 5.5 in the thermophilic hydrogen production reactor, so that a stable hydrogen production was observed as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows the time course of the biogas production in the mesophilic methane production reactor throughout the experiment. The biogas production rate was stable at 4.7l/l/d. The biogas was mainly composed of CH4 and CO2. The contents of CH4 and CO2 in biogas were 70–80% and 20–29%, respectively. The suitable HRTs of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for treating OFMSW have been reported to be more than 10 and 15 days at thermophilic and mesophilic conditions, respectively [9]. In this study, although the HRT of mesophilic methane production reactor was as short as 5.0 days, a good operation performance of methane production was obtained. It is considered that the enhancing effect for methane production was provided by the suspended media added to the reactor. The role of suspended media is considered to provide the absorbent surface for methanogens, so that a high concentration of methanogens can be maintained in the reactor. This might be the reason that the mesophilic methane production reactor was possible to operate at such a short HRT of 5.0 days in this study."
7,Formation of metabolic products,"3.2 Formation of metabolic products Table 3 summarizes the average of the experimental results under steady-state condition in the process. Throughout the experiment, the pH in methane production reactor was maintained at a stable range of 7.3–7.7, which is close to the optimum pH range of methanogenic bacteria. The alkalinity helps to resist changes in pH caused by the addition of acids as a measure of the stability of the digestion process. A high alkalinity in methanogenic reactor was able to secure the pH neutral and methane generation. Since the hydrogen production from organic waste accompanies the organic acid production, lactate, acetate, n-butyrate, n-valerate and ethanol were detected in hydrogen production stage. It was found that main VFAs were acetate and butyrate with a concentration range of 3000–4000mg/l, while the n-valerate and ethanol were in the range of 1000–2000mg/l. The concentration of propionate was as low as 170mg/l. According to the metabolic pathway of glucose, hydrogen is produced via the metabolic pathway of acetate or butyrate fermentation, while there is no hydrogen production in the propionate fermentation. The results of VFA composition in Table 3 indicate that preferable fermentation pattern for hydrogen production occurred in the thermophilic hydrogen production reactor. The concentrations of VFAs were very low and solvent was not detected in the methanogenic reactor. The NH4-N concentration in the methanogenic reactor fluctuates at around 1465mg/l, this level is not inhibitory to the mesophilic methane production [23,24]. The removal efficiencies for the total process and each reactor were based on influent and effluent recycle, respectively, and results are shown in Table 4 . The removal efficiencies of TS, VS, SS, VSS, T-CODCr, T-carbohydrate were as high as over 90%, indicating that this process is very efficient for the degradation of OFMSW. The removal efficiencies of carbohydrate and protein were 90.5% and 47.4% in the hydrogen production stage and reached 96.6% and 85.1% by the methane production stage, respectively. It was found that the majority of carbohydrates were removed in the hydrogen production stage, this result indicated that hydrogen was mainly produced in the degradation of carbohydrate."
8,Role of digested sludge recirculation,"3.3 Role of digested sludge recirculation The role of the digested sludge recirculation in this process is enumerated by two points. The first, the hydrogen-producing bacteria that existed in digested sludge replenished the hydrogen production reactor by recirculation, the hydrogen-producing bacteria were able to be maintained in the hydrogen production reactor, and steady hydrogen production was able to be secured. The second, acidity in hydrogen production stage is neutralized by recirculation of the digested sludge having a high alkalinity, so that the reagent for pH adjustment can be saved. The possibility of hydrogen production from various organic wastes has been extensively investigated using batch or continuous experiments in laboratory scale. Large amounts of hydrogen was formed in a short time such as a batch culture, however, it was frequently observed that hydrogen production was unstable or low hydrogen production rate in continuous hydrogen production for a long time [22]. Moreover, it was reported that hydrogen production from wastewater in the membrane or granule system to maintain high density bacterial cells [25–29]. However, it is considered that these bioreactors are not applicable in case of food waste due to the high SS. In this study, the stable hydrogen production yield recorded 2.5–2.8mol-H2/mol-hexose added. It might be due to the fact that the hydrogen-producing bacteria that existed in digested sludge replenished the hydrogen production reactor by recirculation, the high density hydrogen-producing bacteria was able to be maintained to hydrogen production CSTR in this process, and steady high yield hydrogen was able to be secured. This is the first important feature in this study. As seen in Table 3, the alkalinity of precipitated sludge at the bottom of the digested sludge storage tank was as high as 8132mg/l in this process, while the pH was low as production of acid was accompanied with waste hydrolysis in the hydrogen production reactor. It was well known that the hydrogen yield is affected by pH, and the optimum pH range is 5.5–6.0 as mentioned in the introduction. Therefore, high alkalinity of digested sludge neutralizes the acidity in the hydrogen production stage, reducing not only the effluent amount of digested sludge but also the reagent addition cost for pH adjustment. Moreover, it can maintain a low level of heavy metal Na+ in effluent. This study offers an economical and environment friendly process. This is the second important feature in this study."
9,Yield of hydrogen and methane,"3.4 Yield of hydrogen and methane The pH- and temperature-phased two-stage process was demonstrated as an optimal way which combined hydrogen and methane production in this study. The short HRT, suitable pH and temperature in the first stage resulted in effective separation of hydrogen production from methane production, without the need of external addition of reagents. A comparison of results of works using OFMSW for biological hydrogen production is exhibited in Table 5 . The new two-stage process in this study worked very well, and the stable hydrogen production yield was 205ml/g VS added or 283ml/g VSrem. It is close to 290ml/g VS added from food waste reported by Han [7] and 250ml/g VSrem from OFMSW reported by Liu [10] under semi-continuous mesophilic two-stage process. It is higher than the hydrogen potential range 62–96ml H2/g VS added reported by Okamoto [30] and 180ml H2/g VS added using H2-producing bacteria reported by Lay [31] from OFMSW under mesophilic batch culture experiment. The yield of methane in this study was 464ml/g VS added, which is close to 500ml/g VS added reported by Liu [10], and higher than 240ml/g VS added reported by Han [7]. The results indicate that the pH-phased two-stage process combined thermophilic hydrogen production and mesophilic methane production is a suitable process for producing hydrogen and methane simultaneously from OFMSW. In this process, a short HRT and low pH in the first thermophilic stage resulted in effective separation of hydrogen production from methane production."
10,Mass balance in the process,"3.5 Mass balance in the process The products of anaerobic degradation could be divided into a solid, soluble, and biogas, and the COD mass balance can be calculated according to the COD conversion coefficient of each product [32]. In this process, after two-stage fermentation, 9.3% of the influent COD was converted to the hydrogen gas in the thermophilic hydrogen production reactor, and 76.5% of the influent COD was converted to the methane gas in the mesophilic methane production reactor, as a result, a total of 86% of influent COD was converted to biogas by the whole process. Based on the experimental results, the mass balance in the process is summarized in Fig. 4 . As a typical result, one ton of wet food waste (TS 33.8%) could produce hydrogen-rich biogas of 100m3 hydrogen content of around 52–56% from hydrogen production reactor, and methane-rich biogas of 265m3 with methane content of around 72–80% from methane production reactor by using the new two-stage fermentation process. Energy recovery from hydrogen and methane production reactors were 139,333kcal/t-wet and 1,722,925kcal/t-wet, respectively."
11,Conclusions,"The newly developed pH-phased two-stage process, combined thermophilic hydrogen production and mesophilic methane production, is a suitable process for producing hydrogen and methane simultaneously from OFMSW. Three important points of advantage of this process can be explained. First, the recirculation of the precipitated digester sludge from digested sludge storage tank to hydrogen production reactor makes the pH of the hydrogen production reactor stable and optimal for hydrogen production without the addition of any reagents. Second, the hydrogen-producing bacteria existing in the returned digested sludge contributed as the seed to maintain a high concentration of hydrogen-producing bacteria in the hydrogen production reactor. Third, the suspended media added to the methanogenic reactor support the growth of methanogenic bacteria and make it possible to shorten the HRT of the methane production reactor."
