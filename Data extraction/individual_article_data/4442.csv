0,Introduction,"The bio-hydrogen production from agricultural biomass (such as cornstalk) has attracted intense interest in the past decade in view of their important applications in the fields of clean energy production, the use of renewable resources, environmental protection and so on [1,2]. Only in China, the annual yield of natural cellulosic waste exceeds 0.7 billion tons, among which, the amount of corn stalk is around 220 million tons [3]. So far, most of them have not been effectively utilized in China, which has resulted in a huge waste of renewable resource. At present, it has been proved that it can be served as feedstock for bio-hydrogen production [4]. In all of the available biological routes for H2 production, dark-fermentation H2 production can utilize various agricultural wastes as feedstock to be considered to be an effective method. However, the low conversion efficiency of substrate and the issue of effluent pollution from bio-reactor are a serious challenge throughout all of hydrogen fermentation process. Up to the present time, almost all the researches done on bio-hydrogen production from crop stalk wastes are still confined to using low substrate concentration as feedstock (≤20 g/L) [5,6], which resulted in producing large quantities of organic wastewater. Thus the increasingly stringent requirement is challenging the scientific community to decrease the generation of organic wastewater consumedly in hydrogen fermentation process. An alternative strategy is to employ a higher substrate concentration as feedstock. For instance, Song et al. utilized steam-exploded corn straw of 12.5% (with a solid- to -liquid ratio of 1/7) as feedstock to produce methane by anaerobic digestion and obtained a methane yield of 153 ml/g-TS at initial pH of 7.5 and 50 °C [7]. Fatma and his collaborators reported a methane yield of 31 ml/g-VS treating chicken manure of 25% at 37 °C [8]. Until recently, Yohei et al. reported a hydrogen yield of 1.8 mol H2/mol-TS from starch of 70 g/l by mixed culture [9]. Valdez-Vazquez et al. employed an organic solid wastes of 20.9% (TS, containing paper of 40% and food wastes of 60%) as feedstock and obtained a maximum hydrogen yield of 54.8 ml/g-VS at 55 ± 1 °C by mixed culture [10]. However, little information is available on bio-hydrogen production from high concentration of corn stalk (>20 g/l) via the anaerobic mixed microbes. On the other hand, during the hydrogen fermentation processes, the hydrogen production is usually accompanied with production of volatile fatty acids production (VFAs, such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate), which resulted in a problem about the aquatic environment's pollution. On the other hand, the effluent from above is also an optimal feedstock for production of methane by anaerobic digestion. As far as we know, the anaerobic digestion had successfully been used to treat complex organic wastewater for methane generation in the last two decades [11]. Assuming the above effluent from a bio-hydrogen producing reactor, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), could be further employed as a feedstock to produce methane by coupling with anaerobic digestion. This would provide ternary environmental benefits, viz., clean hydrogen energy generation, effective method of agricultural waste treatment with simultaneous producing methane in a sustainable fashion. Recently, it was found that hydrogen fermentation could be further linked with the anaerobic digestion, microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) or photo-fermentation to produce an additional methane or hydrogen from the effluent of hydrogen fermentation. The advantages of two-stage process, such as greater energy recovery, higher conversion efficiency of substrate and an enhanced removal of fermentation effluent than single one-stage process, have been highlighted [12–15]. Several research focuses have been conducted to utilize agricultural wastes as primary carbon source to produce greater biohydrogen or additional methane by two-stage process. e.g. Cheng and co-workers reported the maximum yields of hydrogen and methane were 731.33 ± 3.6 ml/g-trehalose and 116.9 ± 4.3 ml/g-trehalose from trehalose of 10 g/L with microwave-assisted pretreatment by combination of hydrogen fermentation and methanogene [13]. Logan and etc. reported both 1.67 mol H2/mol-glucose with a corn stover lignocellulose (5 g/L) feed by dark fermentation and an additional 800 ± 290 ml H2/g-COD from a synthetic effluent with a wastewater inoculum by microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) [14]. Kargi et al. found a greater hydrogen production (176 ml H2/g-starch) and a faster rate (12.17 ml H2/g- biomass h) by combined dark–light fermentation of ground wheat of 5 g/L at a D/L (dark/light biomass ratio) of 1/7 as compared to the dark and light fermentations alone [15]. Guo et al. also described a two-stage production hydrogen process from corncob of 8 g/L by dark–light hydrogen fermentation [16]. From the above discussion, we can see that the low substrate concentration (5–20 g/l) is still usually utilized in hydrogen generation and additional methane generation by a single hydrogen fermentation or two-stage process combining hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion so far as literature [13–18], resulting in a large amount of fermentation effluent to be discharged as secondary pollutant. Unfortunately, no much attention has been to paid to such problem as yet, several researches as reported by literature [9,10] are still initial and inadequate. Therefore, the further probe for the above theme is necessary to fully assess the potential benefit of a two-stage process combining hydrogen fermentation and methanogenesis. In light of the above background, herein, we attempt to employ a higher concentration of corn stalk (60 g/L) for the first stage hydrogen fermentation, and then the effluent from hydrogen fermentation was further used to produce methane by the second stage anaerobic digestion. For this purpose, some major parameters on two-stage process combining hydrogen fermentation and methanogenesis were investigated and optimized in the present text."
1,Materials and methods,
2,H2-producing micro-flora,"2.1 H2-producing micro-flora The natural microbial consortium, cow dung compost was obtained from cattle farm in Henan Agricultural University. Prior to use, the mixture of the compost and tap-water was boiled for 30 min to inhibit the bioactivity of H2 consumers and harvest high yield H2-producing spore-forming anaerobes, and then were pre-incubated with glucose in anaerobic reactor at 36 ± 1 °C for about 16 h."
3,Methanogenic reactor start-up and incubation,"2.2 Methanogenic reactor start-up and incubation Before the fermentation effluent was pumped into methanogenic bio-reactor, the methanogenic reactor was first inoculated with a mixture comprising 5.0 L of tap water, 1.0 L of activated anaerobic sludge obtained from was obtained from municipal sewage factory of Zhengzhou, and 0.5 L of the effluent from hydrogen production reactor. The above reactor was then incubated on the effluent with an HRT of 30 days and an organic loading rate (OLR) of 7.4 g-COD/L d under the anaerobic condition of 55 ± 1 °C with mixing speed of 120 rpm. The anaerobic digestion system was started up after undergoing 30 days of acclimation experience for the above reactor, and thus the methanogen activity was recovered in the methanogenic reactor."
4,Experimental materials,"2.3 Experimental materials Air-dried cornstalk was collected from a single field in the suburb of Zhengzhou City, and then was milled by a vegetation disintegrator (FZ102) to pass through a 40-mesh screen and become homogeneous, and stored in sealed plastic bags at 4 ± 0.5 °C. Its characteristic was as follows: total solid (TS) 90.2%, total volatile solid (TVS) 81.7%, the soluble sugar (SS) 32 mg/g-TS, cellulose 39.1%, hemicellulose 30.9% and lignin 9.7%. Prior to use, the mixture of milled cornstalk and dilute H2SO4 solution (0.5 wt %) with solid loading of 10% (w/w) was pretreated at 121 ± 1 °C for 60 min, and then adjusted to pH 7.0 with dilute Ca(OH)2 solution after cooling to room temperature for the next tests. Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) solution: 5 ml of CTAB solution with the concentration from 0.0 to 1.0 g/L was added into each culture flask as bio-reactor."
5,Preincubation of strain Bacillus sp. FS2011,"2.4 Preincubation of strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 The strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 was isolated from a lab-scale producing hydrogen bioreactor of corn stalk in our lab, which was seeded with compost irradiated for 1.5 min and pre-incubated with glucose at 36 ± 1 °C for 9 h under anaerobic condition, and that was identified as belonging to Bacillus sp. on the basis of 16S rDNA gene sequence. The strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 displayed a high-efficiency hydrogen producing performance in a broad range of initial pH from 5.3 to 7.4 to be confirmed in our lab. Before being used, the strain was pre-cultured in 50 ml serum bottles containing 140 ml of basal media at 36 ± 1 °C for 24 h. The basal fermentation media (g/L) was comprised of 20 g/L sucrose, 4 g/L peptone, 3 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L K2HPO4, 0.5 g/L cysteine, 0.1 g/L FeSO4, 0.1 g/L MgCl and 10 ml mineral salt solution."
6,Experimental procedure,"2.5 Experimental procedure The batch experiments were performed with 300 ml serum vials as batch reactors filled to 50 ml with a mixture of the seed microorganism comprising sucrose and 3 ml of nutrient stock solution. Nutrient stock solution was consisted of 80 g/L NH4HCO3, 12.4 g/L KH2PO4, 0.1 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g/L NaCl, 0.01 g/L Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.01 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 0.015 g/L MnSO4·7H2O, and 0.0278 g/L FeCl2, which was slightly modified from the work of Fan et al. [17]. The initial pH values of the medium were adjusted by pH buffer solution. These vials were gassed with nitrogen to remove oxygen to keep the anaerobic environment and then capped with rubber stopper. The bottles were incubated at 36 ± 1 °C in an orbital shaker with a rotation speed of 120 rpm to provide better contact among substrates. At each time interval, the total biogas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using a gas-collecting vessel of displacement method with saturated brine."
7,Two-stage fermentation process integrating biohydrogen production with methanogenesis,"2.6 Two-stage fermentation process integrating biohydrogen production with methanogenesis The verification tests integrating biohydrogen production with methanogenesis from corn stalk were performed by combining hydrogen fermentation in a 10 L continuously stirred hydrogen production bioreactor with a jacket and working volume of 4.00 L (Fig. 1-(2)) and anaerobic digestion in another 10 L methanogenic bio-reactor (Fig. 1-(3)) with a jacket and working volume of 6.5 L, respectively. The schematic diagram was shown in Fig. 1. In one stage, the initial pH value of the reactor (2) was adjusted to 7.5 ± 0.5 by dilute NaOH(6)/HCl(7). The fermentation effluent from reactor (2) was pumped to a started-up reactor (3) as described in Section 2.2. In the two stage, the pH level of reactor (3) was natural and maintained at a near invariable level of 6.8 ± 0.1 by self-adjustment of system throughout the anaerobic digestion process. The temperature of reactor (2, 3) was controlled by pouring an invariable temperature water from a constant temperature water tank(14) to inject of reactor (2, 3) with a miniature centrifugal pump. Both the pH and temperature of reactor (2, 3) were monitored online by automatic controller of pH and temperature (Shanghai Bo Xing Biological equipment Co. Ltd). The contents of hydrogen, methane, VFAs and alcohol were measured online at regular intervals by GC analysis as described in Section 2.6, respectively."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods Hydrogen concentration and methane content was measured by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 4890D) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 6 feet stainless column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 100 °C, 80 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min [13,18]. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were detected using another GC with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an 8-ft stainless column packed with 10% PEG-20 M and 2% H3PO4 (80/100 mesh). The temperatures of the injection port, FID detector, and oven were 220 °C, 140 °C, and a programmed column temperature of 115–170 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min [18]. Hydrogen yield or methane content was calculated by measurements of the gas composition in the headspace plus the total volume of biogas production at each time interval using the mass equation: (1) V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i ( V G , i − V G , i − 1 ) + V H ( C H , i − C H , i − 1 ) where V H,i and V H,i−1 are the cumulative H2/CH4 volumes at the current (i) and previous (i − 1) time intervals, respectively; V G,i and V G,i−1 are the total biogas volumes in the current and previous time intervals, respectively; C H,i and C H,i−1 are the fractions of H2/CH4 in the headspace in the current and previous time intervals, respectively; V H is the volume of headspace of vials."
9,Kinetic modeling,"2.8 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of hydrogen produced in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (2) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (ml); λ is the lag time (h); P is the hydrogen production potential (ml); R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h) and e is the constant of 2.718281828. The values of P, R m and λ for each batch were estimated using the solver function in Excel (version 5.0, Microsoft) with a Newtonian algorithm. In this study, R m is expressed as ml/g-substrate h−1, the specific hydrogen production potential (P s) is defined as ml/g-substrate [19]."
10,Results and discussion,"In early tests from our lab, it was found the hydrogen production exhibited a descending trend with the increase in corn stalk concentration in the range of 20 g/L to 60 g/L, the hydrogen yield sharply decreased from 104.0 ml/g-TS for 20 g/L to 49.6 ml/g-TS at 60 g/L, indicating that substrate concentration had a significant influence on the bio-hydrogen production. In order to reduce wastewater formation from low substrate concentration (≤20 g/L), herein a higher substrate concentration of 60 g/L was selected during hydrogen fermentation, some key process parameters were further investigated and optimized in this study."
11,Effect of bioaugmentation technology from strain FS2011 on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of bioaugmentation technology from strain FS2011 on hydrogen production Fig. 2 depicted that the effect of dosages of strain FS2011 on bio-hydrogen production at the fixed corn stalk pretreated with dilute acid of 60 g/L, initial pH 7.5 ± 0.5 and temperature of 36 ± 1 °C. As shown in Fig. 2, the accumulate H2 yield increased along with the increase of dosage of strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 in the range from 2% to 10%. For instance, the accumulate H2 yield was 51.1 ± 1.2 ml/g-TS in the contrast sample, the next was 53.2 ± 1.0 ml/g-TS for dosage strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 of 2%, the maximum H2 yield of 59.3 ± 1.9 ml/g-TS occurred at the dosage FS2011 of 10%, and then the hydrogen yield declined to 54.7 ± 1.3 ml/g-TS when the dosage FS2011 increased to 12%. The maximum H2 yield had increased by about 16% compared with that of the contrast sample. The results showed that the bioaugmentation of microbial strain on bio-hydrogen production by adding adequate dosage of strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 to the mixed culture medium."
12,Effect of CTAB on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of CTAB on hydrogen production As far as we know, some surfactant can give rise to the change of the permeability of microflora outer membrane, leading to hydrogen production performance. Fig. 3 illustrated the effect of the dosage of CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) on hydrogen production under the conditions with substrate of 60 g/l, initial pH value 7.5 ± 0.5 and 36 ± 1 °C. As shown in Fig. 3, the accumulated H2 yield of maize straw increased with increase of the dosage of CTAB in the range from 0.0 to 30 mg/L, the hydrogen yield of 47.0 ± 0.5 ml/g-cornstalk was observed in the contrast sample (0.0 mg CTAB/L), the maximum value of 68.3 ± 2.1 ml H2/g-cornstalk was recorded at dosage of 30 mg CTAB/L, and then the hydrogen yield declined with the further increase of the CTAB dosage. For example, the hydrogen yield decreased to 63.5 ± 2.3 ml/g-cornstalk for CTAB dosage of 40 mg/L and 53.9 ± 2.4 ml/g- cornstalk for CTAB dosage of 50 mg/L, respectively. The results indicated that the excess dosage of CTAB could destroy the structure of cell wall for hydrogen production bacteria, resulting in the decrease of hydrogen yield. This was similar to the CTAB used as surface active agent could destructed badly degrade the cell membranes in the DNA extraction. The results showed that the hydrogen production performance of cornstalk could be improved by adding an appropriate amount of CTAB in fermentation medium during the hydrogen fermentation process."
13,Effect of NH4HCO3 on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of NH4HCO3 on hydrogen production Nitrogen, as important as carbon, is also essential element to affect the activity of bacteria by dark fermentation. Herein, NH4HCO3 was further selected as the nitrogen resource, and the effect of NH4HCO3 dosage on hydrogen production was illustrated in Fig. 4 at the fixed substrate of 60 g/l, CTAB dosage of 30 mg/L, initial pH value 7.5 ± 0.5 and 36 ± 1 °C. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the NH4HCO3 dosage was also impacted the efficiency of hydrogen production from corn stalk, the cumulative hydrogen yield increased with increase of the culture time and reached maximum value at culture time of 57 h in all cases. The hydrogen yield of 44.4 ± 1 ml/g-cornstalk was observed in the contrast sample. The hydrogen yield was increased with the increase of the NH4HCO3 dosage under the condition with NH4HCO3 concentration ≤1.2 g/L, the maximum hydrogen yield of 51.6 ± 0.6 ml/g-cornstalk occurred at NH4HCO3 dosage of 1.2 g/L, which was increased by about 16.2% as compared with that of the control, and then the variation trend of hydrogen yield was reversed with the further increase of NH4HCO3 dosage. For instance, when the NH4HCO3 dosage increased from 1.8 g/L to 3.6 g/L, the corresponding hydrogen yield rapidly declined to 47.3 ± 0.6 ml/g-cornstalk and 41.7 ± 0.3 ml/g-cornstalk, indicating excess NH4HCO3 dosage displayed a negative impact on hydrogen production. The results implied that NH4HCO3 dosage was also a factor to effect bio-hydrogen production during hydrogen fermentation. However, the NH4HCO3 dosage as inorganic nitrogen sources showed a relatively small influence on bio-hydrogen production because the inorganic materials lacked of some growth factors that were necessary for microbe growth. On the other hand, adding appropriate amount of NH4HCO3 was also in favor of the formation of the buffer system CO3 2−/HCO3 −, which was also meaningful for maintaining the medium pH level during the hydrogen fermentation process. Therefore, to improve the bio-hydrogen yield, the NH4HCO3 dosage should be controlled at an acceptable level."
14,Combined producing hydrogen and methanogenesis by two stage fermentation,"3.4 Combined producing hydrogen and methanogenesis by two stage fermentation The verification test was performed by two-stage fermentation process integrating biohydrogen production with methanogenesis as described above in Section 2.6 (See Fig. 1). 3.4.1 Hydrogen production During the hydrogen fermentation process, the reactor (Fig. 1-(2)) was filled with 4 L mixture comprising the bio-pretreated corn stalk (60 g/L), the pre-incubated inoculums (3 L) and a certain amount of tap water at the fixed NH4HCO3 dosage of 1.2 g/L, CTAB dosage of 30 mg/L, strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 dosage of 10%, initial pH of 7.5 ± 0.5 and 36 ± 1 °C with a rotation speed of 120 rpm, the results were depicted Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5a, the hydrogen production was immediately started after the starting up the reactor, the hydrogen yield and hydrogen content rapidly increased with the increase of culture time from 0 ml/g-cornstalk and 0% at 0 h to 58.0 ± 0.3 ml/g-cornstalk and 59% at about 14 h, the culture pH decreased quickly with the increase of the culture time from 8.0 at 0 h to 4.48 at 14 h. Surprisingly, a platform phase was found from 14 h to 64 h, in this stage, there was hardly hydrogen to be detected, the corresponding culture pH decreased very slowly from 4.48 at 14 h to 4.26 at 64 h. Undergoing the above platform phase, the hydrogen production was beginning to restore, and hydrogen yield gradually increased with the increase of culture time from 58.0 ± 0.3 ml/g-cornstalk at 64 h to maximum value of 79.8 ± 1.5 ml/g-cornstalk at 90 h( Fig. 5a), the hydrogen production was maintained at near a constant level in this stage, the culture pH increased with the increase of the culture time from 4.21 at 69 h to 4.73 at 90 h. Last, the hydrogen production tended to come to a finish at 97 h. Meantime, the hydrogen content increased with the increase of the culture time from 0% at 0 h to 62% at 6.4 h, and then decreased with the increase of the culture time from 59% at 14 h to 45.7% at 64 h during the plateau phase. After the platform phase, the hydrogen content maintained in the range level from 50% to 60%. As far as we know, the hydrogen production is habitually accompanied with production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are also an optimal feedstock for production of methane by anaerobic digestion. Fig. 5b depicted the change curves of VFAs, alcohol and the reduced sugar content with culture time during the hydrogen fermentation. As shown in Fig. 5b, during H2 fermentation progresses, acetate, the maximum yields of acetate, butyrate and ethanol was 10997 mg/L, 7648 mg/L and 376 mg/L respectively, followed by small amounts of butanol and propionate. Among them, the contents of acetate and butyrate accounted for 70–80% of the total VFAs. The total concentration of COD in the effluent was detected to be 22300 mg/L and there was no significant methane observed in the batch tests. Correspondingly, the reduced sugar content decreased with the increase of the culture time from initial 250.3 ± 5.4 mg/g-cornstalk to 3.43 ± 0.01 mg/g-cornstalk at 90 h, indicating the reduced sugar in the corn stalk was completely biodegraded by hydrogen fermentation. Strangely, the hydrogen production was hardly ever detected while the reducing sugar was still consumed slowly in the platform phase (culture time 14–84 h), and yet the content of main byproducts such as VFAs and alcohol was still increased slowly but steadily, implying the substrate had been converted into sole metabolic byproducts such as VFAs and alcohol and cell substance under such circumstances. In addition, we also briefly compared the hydrogen production characteristics of several different agricultural wastes by hydrogen fermentation, and the results were summarized in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, our experiment result in the present research, with which several literature data published was compared, was better than most of those reported in the literature [20–24]. Unfortunately, a low concentration of substrate was still employed as feedstock to produce bio-hydrogen during hydrogen fermentation until now. The result validated that a higher concentration of corn stalk (60 g/L) was utilized to produce bio-hydrogen to be an effective strategy for reducing the formation of fermentation effluent from low concentration of substrate (≤20 g/L) during hydrogen fermentation. 3.4.2 Methane production After the methanogenic reactor (3) had been cultivated for 30 days as described in Section 2.2, and then was used to treat above effluent from reactor (2). The fermentation effluent from reactor (2) as feedstock was pumped to the reactor (3) by a miniature centrifugal pump, which was mainly composed of VFAs (such as acetate, butyrate and ethanol), hydrogen fermentation residue of corn stalk and anaerobic sludge from hydrogen fermentation with influent COD concentration of 22300 mg/L. The anaerobic digestion reaction was achieved under the conditions with the HRT 13 days, organic loading rate 16.9 g COD/L d, pH 6.8 ± 0.1 and thermophilic 55 ± 1 °C (See Section 2.6 and Fig. 1). The developing trends of methane yield and methane content versus culture time was illustrated in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, the methane yield significantly increased with the increase of culture time in the range from 0 to 184 h, and then trended to be a constant. Correspondingly, the methane content increased with the increase of culture time changing from 57 ± 1% at about 10 h–67 ± 1% at about 60 h, and then was kept at a relatively constant level. Both the maximum methane yield and producing methane rate were recorded to be 227.57 ± 2.5 ml/g-COD at 184 h and 436.77 ± 10.5 ml/L d at 70 h, respectively. The methane production was lasted for about 184 h and the cumulative methane yield reached 20300 ml by anaerobic digestion. Finally, the methane production gradually stopped while the substrate was exhausted. Meanwhile, the COD removal efficiency of the reactor (3) could even reach 95 ± 1% ranging from influent COD concentration 22300 mg/L to reaction termination of 860 mg/L. The results demonstrated that the co-producing biohydrogen and methane by two-stage fermentation process could be a one-stone-two-birds paradigm, it not only produced a clean and readily usable biologic energy hydrogen and methane but also removed simultaneously the effluent COD from hydrogen fermentation in a sustainable fashion."
15,Conclusions,"The feasibility of the combined production of hydrogen and methane from higher-concentration of cornstalk (60 g/L) by integrating dark fermentation with anaerobic digestion had been demonstrated in this paper. The maximum hydrogen yield of 79.8 ± 1.5 ml/g-cornstalk and hydrogen production rate of 3.78 ± 0.2 ml/g-cornstalk h were observed by hydrogen fermentation at the fixed strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 dosage of 10% (v/v), CTAB dosage of 30 mg/L, NH4HCO3 dosage of 1.2 g/L. Meantime, the total amount of the produced organic wastewater was reduced by about two-thirds compared with that of low substrate concentration (≤20 g/L). The above effluent was further converted to methane by anaerobic digestion. The maximal methane yield of 227 ± 2.5 ml CH4/g-COD and COD removal efficiency of 95 ± 1% had been recorded. The result showed that the target strategy was feasible in conversion of cornstalk into clean energy process, it not only produced a clean and readily usable biologic energy (H2 and CH4) but also removed simultaneously the effluent COD from hydrogen fermentation in a sustainable fashion."
