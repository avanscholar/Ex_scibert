0,Introduction,"Nerve injuries, particularly in peripheral nerve and their overwhelming effects, has become the major concern in the field of medical science. These injuries result from acute trauma and may lead to chronic sensorimotor defects. Due to the lack of useful and robust repair techniques, it is challenging to maintain the adequate health and function of neurons. The usual methods for the cure of injured peripheral nerve are based upon either coaptation or the use of nerve grafts, which is generally hard to operate due to its number of drawbacks like limited availability of donor's nerve, need for multiple surgical interventions and loss of function at the donor site [1–3]. The major challenge is the recovery of the nervous system after an injury. Since the last decade, much promising research has been carried out to treat peripheral nerves injuries via a tissue engineering approach [3–5]. The major limitation is the cytotoxicity of the materials and its degraded products [6]. Currently, tissue engineering has gained great interest, as attempts are made to engineer the scaffold environment mimicking the cellular niche. The major challenges in this field are to closely mimic the hierarchical architecture and properties of the extracellular matrices (ECM) of the native tissue. Biomaterials, mainly polysaccharide and proteins based nanomaterials have played an increasingly prominent role in the development of tissue-engineered implants. Polysaccharides are the most abundant renewable macromolecules in the biomass and have gained particular attention, due to their physicochemical, thermal, biocompatibility, cell adhesion and non-toxic properties. Fabrication of nanofibers scaffolds via electrospinning techniques provides a valuable means to mimic the natural nanoscale ECM of cells and tissues [7]. Tissue engineered nerve graft has emerged as a promising substitute to autologous nerve grafts. It comprises of biomaterials based template that integrates biochemical signals. In advanced technique, the nerve regeneration has been facilitated by artificial nerve guidance conduits like microfilaments, microchannel and nanofiber bundles under axonal guidance [4,8]. These tools are not only helpful in increasing the nerve regeneration but also cater to the problem associated with cumbersome nerve grafting technique. Recent research has revealed that, use of biomaterials based nanofiber scaffolds in combination with different synthetic, non-toxic polymers like polycaprolactone (PCL), polyesters (poly(glycolide)) (PGA), poly(dl-lactide glycolide), poly(glycerol sebacate), poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(ethylene oxide) are widely applied for the tissue engineering applications due to their biocompatible and biodegradable properties [4,9,10]. Some of the commonly used biomaterials for neural tissue engineering also include carbohydrates like alginate, chitosan, and hyaluronic acid along with proteins such as collagen, gelatin, silk, keratin and fibrin [11,12]. It was suggested that interaction of neurons with nano range materials mainly nanofiber promotes neurons regeneration with improving neurite outgrowth [6,10,13]. Recent studies revealed that few metal-based non-toxic carbon dots also promote neural cell growth and differentiation [14]. Besides, conductive polymers based nanocomposites also support neural regeneration [15,16]. Gellan gum (GG) is a linear anionic microbial polysaccharide composed of tetrasaccharide (1,3-β-d-glucose, 1,4- β-d-glucuronic acid, 1,4- β-d-glucose, 1,4-α-l-rhamnose) repeating units, containing one carboxyl side group [17]. It is obtained from Sphingomonas (Pseudomonas) elodea by fermentation [18] and is commonly used in the food and pharmaceuticals industry. It is soluble in hot water and can form a gel upon lowering the temperature and mixing it with mono or divalent cations [19]. Due to biocompatibility, bio-adhesiveness and the presence of free carboxylic groups [20]. GG is considered as a potent biomaterial for biomedical and tissue engineering applications. Previously, gellan based films, hydrogels, and microcarriers have been studied as a prospective material for biomedical engineering [19]. However, so far, there are limited reports on fabrication and biocompatibility study of electrospun gellan nanofibers. Because of limited solubility, anionic nature, low shear viscosity and strong shear thinning behaviour at a low-shear rate, electrospinning of gellan solution is very difficult [21,22]. These limitations were overcome by adding another hydrophilic polymer poly(vinyl alcohol) as a supporting polymer. Formerly, Stijnman et al. (2011) [23] have tried to electrospin 1% aqueous gellan solution but were unsuccessful in producing gellan nanofibers. They suggested that gellan solution produced only deformed droplets and an unstable Taylor cone at the spinning needle tip. Vashisth et al. have successfully fabricated and optimized the process for gellan nanofibers [21,22]. Previously fabricated fibers have some drawbacks such as high water solubility, fast degradation rate, and low mechanical strength. Also, there is no systemic study on the cytotoxicity of GG nanofibers, which limits their biomedical application. Hence, in this context, it might be interesting to study the biocompatibility and tissue engineering application potential of GG nanofiber scaffolds. The current research work primarily focuses on the fabrication and characterization of PG-NFs as plausible scaffolds for prospective neural tissue engineering. Electrospinning technique was used for the fabrication of PG-NFs with PVA used as supporting material for the fabrication of gellan based nanofiber due to its non-toxic and biocompatible properties [24]. Moreover, due to high molecular weight of PVA, it could be easily electrospinnable. Surface morphology of nanofiber was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and physicochemical properties were studied using different standard methods. Further, compatibility of PG-NFs as promising tissue engineering scaffolds was elucidated using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro and assessing their growth characteristics."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials GG (Phytagel), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Mw = ~1,40,000), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (MTT), Paraformaldehyde (PFA), β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Murine stable ESCs clones, established in the laboratory of Dr. Nibedita Lenka at National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India. The cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium: DMEM) and other supplements such as l-Glutamine, Penicillin-Streptomycin, Non-essential amino acids were procured from Invitrogen and Fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Hyclone. Alpha-tubulin (α-tubuluin) antibody and DAPI were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, USA for immunostaining. Ultra-pure Milli Q water was used throughout the experiment. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade."
3,Preparation of PVA-gellan blend solution,"2.2 Preparation of PVA-gellan blend solution To prepare PVA-gellan blend solution, the aqueous solutions of 1.5% (wt/v) gellan and 10% PVA (wt/v) were mixed at a ratio of 3:7 and stirred for 2 h at 80 °C followed by the sonication for 30 min to obtain a homogenous solution."
4,Electrospinning,"2.3 Electrospinning To fabricate PG-NFs, blend solution was transferred to a 2 ml plastic syringe with a 22 gauge hypodermic needle and nanofibers were spun using electrospinning setup (E-Spin Nanotech Pvt. Ltd, India). The nanofibers were spun at the optimized parameters with a flow rate of 5 μL/min of feed solution controlled by a syringe pump to achieve a steady flow rate throughout the deposition. The distance between the collector plate and needle tip was set at 8 cm, and 16 kV potential difference was applied between tip and collector by a high voltage power supply. Nanofiber samples were collected on the aluminium foil covered on the grounded stainless steel collector. This experiment was carried out at ambient temperature and with 55% relative humidity."
5,Characterization of nanofibers,"2.4 Characterization of nanofibers 2.4.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis Morphology of electrospun PG-NFs was studied by SEM (JEOL JSM-6390LV). Samples (0.5 × 0.5 cm) were mounted on silicon wafers and coated by gold using sputter coating technique for 20 s to make them conductive. Images of the fibers were taken at 20 kV accelerating voltage at different magnifications. The diameter of nanofiber from the SEM image was calculated using Image J software. 2.4.2 FTIR analysis Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Model: Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrophotometer) was performed without any pretreatment of the samples. Nanofibers sample were cut into 1 × 1 cm and kept on the sample holder. Spectra were obtained with 16 scans per samples at a resolution of 4 cm−1 between 4000 and 400 cm−1. 2.4.3 Physical properties of PG-NFs Water solubility and swelling behaviour of the PG-NFs was studied as described elsewhere [25,26]. Contact angle value was measured by a contact angle analysis system (Pheonix 300) at room temperature. Nanofiber sample was sliced into 1 × 1 cm sizes, and images of the droplet on the mat were taken after 5 s of contact time. The hydrophilicity of the fiber mat was measured by the acquired images. Apparent porosity of PG-NFs mat was calculated as described earlier [27]. Degradation study of PG-NFs was tested in phosphate buffer for different time periods (1, 3, 7 and 14 days) as reported by Aadil et al. (2018) [24]. Further, the conductivity of PG-NFs mat was determined by two micro-pillars using sharp tip probes, and I–V characteristic was recorded using a digital electrometer (Keithley 4200 SCS). The conductance was calculated from the slope of linear I–V curves [24]."
6,In-vitro cytotoxicity assay,"2.5 In-vitro cytotoxicity assay One of the well-characterized murine stable ESCs clones, established in the laboratory of Dr. Nibedita Lenka at National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India was considered for investigating the in-vitro biocompatibility effect of PG-NFs. The said ESCs were maintained in culture using the maintenance medium, as described [28]. The percent cell viability following exposure to the PG-NFs was determined by placing ~0.2 cm2 PG-NF slices onto 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture dish followed by seeding 5 × 103 ESCs on the same. The wells without PG-NF served as the control. After two days of incubation under the maintenance condition at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator with 5% CO2, the cells were subjected to 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye reduction (MTT) assay using the protocol described [24]. All samples were assayed in triplicate, and the percent cell viability was calculated, keeping the value of control ESCs as 100% viable. The data were presented as mean ± SEM from three different sets (n = 3) with statistical significance calculated using t-test (Sigma plot)."
7,Determination of ESCs adhesion and growth on PG-NFs,"2.6 Determination of ESCs adhesion and growth on PG-NFs To verify successful adhesion, growth and colony formation of ESCs upon seeding on PG-NFs, the PG-NFs were trimmed to 1 cm2 slices, and placed within 4-well tissue culture dish with 1 slice/well. Undifferentiated ESCs (15 × 103) were seeded on PG-NFs using the maintenance medium and incubated at 37 °C using a humidified CO2 incubator with 5% CO2. After 2–3 days of culture, the medium was removed; the scaffolds were rinsed with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Immunostaining was carried out as described [28], using antibody against α-tubulin for detecting the cytoskeleton, followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody and DAPI as the nuclear stain. The samples for negative control was processed in a similar manner by substituting the primary antibody with 5% FBS (fetal bovine serum). The cell-laden PG-NFs were placed on glass coverslips and images were captured under confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon). In parallel, ESCs grown on PG-NFs were fixed with 4% PFA, dehydrated and taken for SEM analysis to monitor ESCs growth and colony formation on the same."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Most of the assays were performed in triplicates, and the results presented as mean value ± standard deviation (SD)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Visual appearance and surface morphology PG-NFs,"3.1 Visual appearance and surface morphology PG-NFs The visual appearance of the prepared electrospun nanofiber mat was uniform and white as shown in Fig. 1 A. The formation of a uniform mat suggested good miscibility of the gellan with PVA. The morphology, surface structure, and dimension of nanofibers were characterized by SEM at different magnifications. SEM images of the prepared PG-NFs displayed that the electrospun PG-NFs were smooth, random and long with interconnected three-dimension network structure (Fig. 1B). The average diameter of PG-NFs was found to be 158 ± 23 nm, which was less than the previously reported alginate-PVA nanofiber (250 nm) [24,29]. As suggested earlier, the morphology of fiber was significantly affected by gellan concentrations [22]. Low concentration (<2%) of gellan favours the electrospinning while high concentration (~2%) of gellan leads to branched and beaded fiber. This behaviour is possibly due to the high surface tension of gellan-PVA solution and the difference in applied electrical forces during electrospinning experiment [22,30]. In the present study, reduction in fiber diameter is possibly due to the use of low concentration of gellan (1.5%) and the ratio of PVA-gellan (7:3). Nanofiber with narrow diameter range closely resembles the structure of the extracellular matrix and may have more potential for tissue engineering applications."
11,FTIR analysis,"3.2 FTIR analysis The characteristic peaks observed at 3321, 2941 cm−1 and from 1667 to 1238 cm−1 are attributed to the hydroxyl groups of glucopyranose ring of gellan and carboxyl groups of the gellan-PVA matrix respectively (Fig. 3 ). A wide peak for hydroxyl group appeared at 3321 cm−1, denotes the hydrogen bonding interaction between O–H group of gellan and PVA [31,32]. The low intensity of the peak at 1500 cm−1, ascribed to carbonyl groups (CO), showed a gradual decrease and shifted towards lower wavenumber. Previous studies also reported that a broad peak around at 3200-3400 cm−1 attributed to O–H bond appeared due to the interaction of gellan with PVA [24]. Moreover, FTIR results suggested the existence of hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl groups of gellan and PVA. Consequently, the addition of PVA moderated the interaction between gellan molecules and improved the electrospinnability of the blend solution [22,24]."
12,Physical properties of PG-NFs,"3.3 Physical properties of PG-NFs Table 1 displays the physical properties of PG-NFs. While the water solubility percentage of PG-NFs was 10%, the swelling percentage was found to be 669%. The less water solubility of PG-NFs was possibly due to a high degree of cross-linking between hydroxyl groups of gellan with PVA molecules, which subsequently reduced the exposure of free hydroxyl group of gellan and PVA to water molecules [24]. Further, nanofiber mat retained more water molecules, possibly due to a high degree of cross-linking, thereby slightly increasing the swelling percentage of PG-NFs mat. Previous studies also suggest that the degree of cross-linking affects the water solubility and swelling percentage of nanofiber [22,24,32]. Wettability of the fabricated nanofiber was measured using contact angle analysis, which is significantly important for tissue engineering application. The contact angle value of PG-NFs was about 35° (Fig. 2) indicating its hydrophilic nature. In fact, this is in line with the report by Vashisth and Pruthi, (2016), who have also suggested the gellan-PVA nanofibers scaffolds as hydrophilic [22]. Additionally, the apparent porosity of PG-NF was found to be 40%, and conductivity was 126.93 pS. Indeed, the conductivity value of the PG-NFs was found to be higher than the alginate-PVA nanofiber scaffolds (61.79 pS) [24]. It was suggested that the conductive nature of the nanofiber scaffolds does enhance the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of cells, particularly neural and cardiac cells [33]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the conductivity of PG-NFs scaffolds. Hence, in this context, the conductive nature of PG-NFs would be a significant property to become an ideal scaffold for neural tissue engineering applications."
13,Degradation study,"3.4 Degradation study Degradation study of the PG-NFs was performed in phosphate buffer up to 14 days. The initial weight loss after 24 and 72 h was 15 and 25%, respectively. The maximum weight loss after 14 days was 36% (remaining weight 64%) (Table 1). Results revealed that PG-NFs scaffold was stable in the aqueous medium and can maintain its structure up to 14 days in PBS. The initial weight loss of the nanofiber scaffold was most possibly due to the non-cross-linked molecules of the gellan and PVA. There are limited reports on biodegradation study of PG-NFs. In the previous report, the degradation rate of PVA-alginate (2% alginate and 10% PVA) based nanofiber scaffolds was approx. 25% (remaining weight 75%) after 7 days of the study period in PBS [24]. Further, the degradation rate of the scaffolds can also be controlled by cross-linking methods. Generally, scaffolds having a reasonbale time period and non toxic degradation products are found to be ideally suited for tissue engineering application [2]."
14,In vitro cytotoxicity study,"3.5 In vitro cytotoxicity study ESCs grown in the presence of PG-NFs for 48 h exhibited colony formation similar to that of control, thereby suggesting the biocompatible nature of the fabricated gellan nanofiber (data not shown). The quantification of cell viability by MTT assay did not indicate any appreciable difference in ESCs growth when grown in presence of PG-NFs (95.3 ± 6.7%) compared to that of control (100%) (Fig. 4 a). Hence, the fabricated PG-NFs was found to be biocompatible. The biocompatible nature of PG-NFs scaffolds, as well as favourable ESCs growth was further authenticated by detecting the presence of ESCs colonies on those. As seen in Fig. 4b, successful colony formation by ESCs was verified by visualizing DAPI stained nuclei and α-tubulin positive cytoskeleton in each colony. Some previous reports have also shown that polysaccharides such as gellan and alginate based nanofiber scaffolds show the non-cytotoxic and cell growth characteristic [22,24]. This might be due to PG-NFs matrix providing a suitable environment for cells attachment and proliferation by acting as artificial extracellular matrices. Moreover, the hydrophilic and conductive nature of the nanofiber might have also supported the attachment of the desired cells onto the scaffold surface, thereby facilitating cell growth and viability [16,24,34–36]. In line with the same, SEM analysis also revealed successful cell adhesion and growth of ESCs on PG-NFs (Fig. 4c). Together our data suggested that, PG-NFs might be considered suitable as a biomaterial scaffold for tissue engineering applications. A couple of earlier reports have demonstrated the use of electrospun nanofibers for growth and differentiation of neural cells [1,16,35,37]. Ramakrishna and co-workers reported that electrospun nanofibers have the potential to support the growth and differentiation of neural cells [5]. Consistent with these, our findings combining conductivity and biocompatibility have suggested the potential of PG-NFs to support the murine ESCs growth and differentiation thereby paving the way for exploring PG-NFs for neural tissue engineering, ongoing currently in the laboratory."
15,Conclusion,"PVA-gellan electrospun nanofibers were successfully fabricated that exhibited smooth and random nanofiber structure with an average diameter ranging from 140 to 160 nm. While FTIR study revealed the intermolecular interaction of gellan with PVA via hydrogen bonding, physicochemical properties, particularly water solubility and degradation rate indicated it's hydrophilic nature with good stability in the aqueous medium. Biocompatibility study suggested that gellan nanofiber was non-toxic to ESCs and supported cell adhesion and growth. In summary, due to the notable physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and cost-effective production, PVA-gellan nanofiber scaffolds can be considered as a potential biomaterial for different bio-implant fabrication and tissue engineering applications, which may be explored in the future. Further, its potential for in-vitro and in-vivo nerve regeneration is currently under investigation in our group."
