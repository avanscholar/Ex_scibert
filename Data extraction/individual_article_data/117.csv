0,Introduction,"The current major energy source used around the world is fossil fuels, but their quantities are limited. The excessive use of fossil fuels directly results in the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as CO x , NO x , SO x , and C x H y , which cause global warming and acid rain problems [1,2]. Hydrogen is an interesting alternative clean energy source for various applications since it only produces water when it is combusted. Hydrogen can be used by itself or blended with another fuel, such as methane. The combustion of hydrogen mixed with methane results in lower NO x emissions from internal combustion engines, which is environmentally more desirable [3,4]. Not only does hydrogen produces greenhouse gases, but it also gives a high energy yield of 112 kJ/g. This is approximately 2.75 times higher than most hydrocarbon fuels on weight basis. Hydrogen can also be directly used in fuel cells for electricity generation [5–7]. Hydrogen can be produced by several processes already available, such as steam reforming of methane (SRM), non-catalytic partial oxidation (POX) of fossil fuels, autothermal reforming which combines SRM and POX, photochemical processes, photocatalytic processes, and photo-electrochemical processes [1,8–11]. Nevertheless, all of these processes require high energy for operation, do not give the dual goals of energy production and waste reduction, and are not environmentally friendly [5–7]. Hydrogen production by biological processes has been considered more economically feasible because these processes operate at relatively low temperatures and pressures (30–40 °C and 1 atm) [12], which, in turn, lead to lower energy consumption, an environmentally desirable goal in itself. Biological hydrogen production can be attained either via photo or dark fermentation processes, which are particularly attractive from the viewpoint of being able to directly convert organic compounds in wastewaters to hydrogen gas by fermentative bacteria [1–7,12]. The dark fermentation processes by anaerobic bacteria offer a more promising approach for hydrogen production as compared to the photo fermentation processes because the dark fermentation does not require light supply and waste stream transparency. In addition, it gives a higher and more stable hydrogen production rate, since the process can operate by day and night [13,14]. Under anaerobic conditions, organic compounds can be converted by acidogenic bacteria to produce mainly organic acids and hydrogen gas [15–17]. There are a number of parameters that have been considered to significantly affect the biological hydrogen production rate, such as pH, temperature, organic loading rate, cycle duration, solid retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and toxic compounds present in an incoming wastewater. Several model wastewaters containing simple sugars (such as glucose and sucrose) and starch have been extensively studied for hydrogen production [5,16,18–28]. Fundamentally, industrial wastewaters with high strengths of organic compounds are far more economically attractive to be used as substrates for hydrogen production. This is because the use of industrial wastewaters for hydrogen production provides dual benefits for the reduction of wastewater treatment cost and the production of hydrogen as a renewable energy source. A number of studies of real industrial wastewaters have been investigated for hydrogen production, such as palm oil mill wastewater [15], cassava wastewater [17], rice winery wastewater [29], pulping wastewater [30], beer lees wastewater [31], and cheese processing wastewater [32]. However, to our knowledge, alcohol distillery wastewater with high contents of both potassium and sulfate has not been extensively used for hydrogen production via anaerobic fermentation. The alcohol distillery wastewater used in this study is the wastewater from the alcohol distillation process, using sugarcane molasses as a raw material. This alcohol distillery wastewater has a very high chemical oxygen demand (COD), up to 150,000 mg/l, and also contains high amounts of potassium and sulfate, which makes it unsuitable to efficiently convert to either hydrogen or methane. This is due to the toxicity of high concentrations of both potassium and sulfate. Hence, it is of great interests to investigate how to maximize the hydrogen production from the distillery wastewater. In this study, anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) were employed to produce hydrogen from the distillery wastewater. The effects of feed COD value and COD loading rate were investigated for the ASBR operation, in order to minimize the toxicity of both potassium and sulfate and to maximize the efficiency of hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Seed sludge preparation,"2.1 Seed sludge preparation The seed sludge for the hydrogen production experiments, collected from the anaerobic tank of Red Bull Distillery (1988) Co., Ltd., Samuthsakorn, Thailand, was first concentrated by sedimentation. The concentrated sludge was ground and filtered through a 1-mm sieve in order to remove debris and large particles. Then, it was pretreated by boiling at 95 °C for 15 min in order to enrich spore-forming hydrogen-producing acidogenic bacteria and to eliminate hydrogen-consuming methanogenic bacteria [4]. The heat-treated sludge was then added to the anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR). The use of this heat-treated sludge can facilitate the start-up procedure."
3,Feed preparation,"2.2 Feed preparation Alcohol distillery wastewater was also obtained from the same distillery plant, where sugarcane molasses is used as a raw material for alcohol fermentation. It was filtered through a 0.2-μm sieve to remove any large solid particles before use. The alcohol distillery wastewater, having a COD of about 150,000 mg/l, was then diluted with water to obtain various feed COD values of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mg/l, in order to determine the highest tolerant level of the toxicity of both potassium and sulfate on the hydrogen-producing bacteria. The freshly prepared wastewater was used without any nutrient supplementation in order to investigate its inherent potential for hydrogen production."
4,Bioreactor design and operation,"2.3 Bioreactor design and operation Two identical ASBR reactors were used independently to perform the hydrogen production experiments. To inhibit the activity of photosynthetic bacteria, the 5-L bioreactors were made of opaque PVC. Each of them had an inner diameter of 13 cm and a height of 30 cm. The bioreactors were operated with a working volume of 4 l. The schematic of the investigated ASBR unit is shown in Fig. 1 . The ASBR operation comprised four sequential steps: feeding, reacting, settling, and decanting. During the operation, the time required for each step was controlled by digital timers, which regulated a diaphragm pump to feed the prepared wastewater into the top of the bioreactor during the feeding step. Homogeneous mixing of the microbial cells and wastewater was achieved by using a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm during the reacting step. A pH-controller (equipped with diaphragm pumps connected to 1 M NaOH and 1 M H2SO4 solutions) and a heater (equipped with a thermocouple) were used to maintain a constant pH of 5.5 and a constant temperature of 37 °C, respectively. Regarding the work of Bhaskar et al. [33], the pH range of 5.5–6 was considered to be the optimum pH range for hydrogen production. In addition, Lee et al. [34] reported that an excellent hydrogen production was obtained when a bioreactor was operated under a mesophilic temperature of 37 °C and pH of 5.5. Moreover, Lin and Chen [24] reported that the sulfate toxicity could be reduced by controlling a system pH at 5.5, which was the desired value for suppressing the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Hence, in this work, the studied ASBR reactors were operated to produce hydrogen at the temperature of 37 °C and pH of 5.5. For the start-up procedure, 500 ml of the heat-treated seed sludge was added to each studied ASBR reactor. The distillery wastewater was diluted to have a feed COD of 20,000 mg/l for starting up the ASBR units. A COD loading rate was then increased stepwise by increasing feed flow rate and/or feed COD concentration. The operation times of the four sequential steps for the ASBR operation at a cycle time of 6 cycles per day in this present work are shown in Table 1 . The 6 cycles per day was used because it was proven in our previous work to be the optimum operationable cycle time for the ASBR system that provided exceptionally high hydrogen production performance [17]. In this work, the feed and decant flow rates were varied at different feed COD values of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mg/l to achieve different COD loading rates, as shown in Table 2 . In this study, the toxicity from both high potassium and sulfate was reduced by dilution technique and a lowest dilution ratio was determined in order to minimize the volume of the treated distillery wastewater. Hence, a feed COD value lower than 20,000 mg/l was not studied while at a feed COD value greater than 60,000 mg/l, the system performance was found to decrease drastically. For any given feed COD value, the experimental data at very low COD loading rates producing a low hydrogen concentration with a very high methane concentration as well as at very high COD loading rates with low hydrogen production efficiency were not reported and excluded from the table. Hence, Table 2 shows only 4 COD loading rates for each studied feed COD value which are sufficient enough for evaluating both the best feed COD value and COD loading rate for the hydrogen production. Under any given feed COD value and COD loading rate, the ASBR system was operated to reach steady state around two weeks before taking samples of effluents and produced gas for analyses. The steady state condition was justified when both the gas production rate and effluent COD were nearly invariant with time (with standard deviation less than 5% from day-to-day analyses). The produced gas samples were measured for gas production rate and analyzed for gas composition. The feed and effluent samples were taken for analyses of COD, total amount of volatile fatty acids (VFA), and VFA composition. For any given experimental conditions, the steady state data from at least three runs were averaged and used to assess the process performance of the ASBR system."
5,Measurements and analytical methods,"2.4 Measurements and analytical methods The gas production rate was determined by a wet gas meter. The gas composition of the produced gas samples was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (AutoSystem GC, Arnel PerkinElmer) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless-steel HayeSep D 100/120 mesh packed column (Alltech). The total amount of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the effluent samples was determined by the distillation and titration method [35]. The VFA composition in the effluent samples was analyzed by another gas chromatograph (PR2100, Perichrom) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-WAXetr capillary column (J & W Scientific). The volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the effluent samples, used to represent the microbial washout from the ASBR unit, and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) used to represent the microbial concentration in the ASBR unit were both measured according to the standard methods [35]. The COD in the feed and effluent samples was determined by the dichromate method, using a COD reactor and a spectrophotometer (DR 2700, HACH). The potassium concentration in the feed and effluent samples was also analyzed, using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (SpectrAA 300, Varian)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characteristics of distillery wastewater,"3.1 Characteristics of distillery wastewater Table 3 shows the characteristics of the distillery wastewater used in this work. The distillery wastewater contains a high concentration of organic compounds, as clearly seen by both COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) values. Most of the organic compounds are in soluble form, as indicated by the low SS:TS (Suspended Solids:Total Solids) ratio. The low BOD:COD ratio of 27:100 indicates that this distillery wastewater is hardly biodegradable. This was as expected, since the sugarcane molasses was used as the raw material for the alcohol fermentation, and the most easily biodegradable fraction had already been utilized by the yeast to produce ethanol. Interestingly, this distillery wastewater also contains very high concentrations of both potassium and sulfate in the toxicity levels. For the toxicity levels of potassium to anaerobic bacteria, it has been reported that the moderate and strong inhibition ranges are 2500–4500 and 12,000 mg/l, respectively [36]. It has also been reported that in a full-scale biogas plant operation, a dilution of the distillery wastewater is needed in order to minimize the potassium toxicity. Hence, in this study, a maximum potassium concentration that could be used to operate the studied ASBR unit to achieve acceptable hydrogen production efficiency was also investigated, as will be described later."
8,Organic removal results,"3.2 Organic removal results Fig. 2 shows the effect of COD loading rate and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the COD removal efficiency and gas production rate at different feed COD values. The maximum COD removal efficiencies at the feed COD values of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mg/l were 27, 30, and 32% at the COD loading rates of 37.5, 60, and 112.5 kg/m3 d, respectively. It should be mentioned here that at a feed COD value greater than 60,000 mg/l, the studied ASBR system showed poor process performance in terms of very low COD removal efficiency, as well as very low gas production rate and high carbon dioxide content with low hydrogen content in the produced gas. Hence, the highest feed COD value of 60,000 mg/l was used in this present work. Under the studied range of feed COD values of 20,000–60,000 mg/l, the results indicate that the compounds in the distillery wastewater were more effectively converted anaerobically at a higher feed COD value and a higher COD loading rate, resulting in high gas production rate, as shown next. However, a lower COD removal efficiency as compared to a sucrose-containing wastewater [24] was observed, possibly because the distillery wastewater contains higher-molecular-weight organic components, leading to it being hardly biodegraded as compared with a simple sugar [37]. The gas production rate as a function of COD loading rate and HRT at different feed COD values is also shown in Fig. 2a, b, and c, respectively. For the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l (Fig. 2a), the gas production rate dramatically increased with increasing COD loading rate from 0.11 l/h at 15 kg/m3 d to 1.09 l/h at 37.5 kg/m3 d. For the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l (Fig. 2b), the gas production rate increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached the maximum of 1.59 l/h at a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d. Beyond the COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d, it decreased to 1.35 l/h with further increasing COD loading rate to 75 kg/m3 d. For the feed COD value of 60,000 mg/l (Fig. 2c), the gas production rate remained nearly constant at about 0.75 l/h at COD loading rates in the range of 45–90 kg/m3 d, but it increased to 1.49 l/h at a COD loading rate of 112.5 kg/m3 d. The comparative results at different COD loading rates of the three feed COD values of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mg/l showed that the gas production rate for the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l—with a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 16 h—was much higher than those for the feed COD values of 20,000 and 60,000 mg/l. This is possibly due to a relatively higher bacterial growth at the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l, as shown later in the part of MLVSS. The decrease in gas production rate at any given COD loading rate with increasing feed COD value (corresponding to both a lower gas production rate and a lower hydrogen content in the produced gas, as shown next in Fig. 3 ) is probably due to a higher VFA accumulation [4,16,17], which will be discussed in the part of total VFA concentration. The composition of the produced gas as a function of COD loading rate and HRT at different feed COD values is shown in Fig. 3. For the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l (Fig. 3a), the hydrogen content in the produced gas increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached the maximum of 29.6% at a COD loading rate of 37.5 kg/m3 d. In contrast, the carbon dioxide and methane contents showed the opposite trend to the hydrogen content, with the minimum values of 63.9 and 6.5%, respectively, at a COD loading rate of 37.5 kg/m3 d. For the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l (Fig. 3b), the hydrogen content increased from 7.0 to 34.7% with increasing COD loading rate from 30 to 60 kg/m3 d and then decreased to 28.0% at a higher COD loading rate of 75 kg/m3 d. The decrease in both gas production rate and hydrogen content at a higher COD loading rate at the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l is due to the toxicity of VFA accumulation, as explained later in the part of total VFA concentration. The carbon dioxide content also showed the opposite trend to the hydrogen content. It decreased from 81.3 to 65.3% when increasing COD loading rate to 60 kg/m3 d, and after that it slightly increased to 72.0% at a COD loading rate of 75 kg/m3 d. However, the methane content in the produced gas decreased dramatically with increasing COD loading rate, and no methane was detected at a COD loading rate higher than 60 kg/m3 d. This is possibly because the system was in a highly favorably acidic environment (high VFA concentration), which leads to totally suppressing the methane production step [38]. For the feed COD value of 60,000 mg/l (Fig. 3c), the hydrogen content became almost unchanged at 24.0% when increasing COD loading rate from 45 to 90 kg/m3 d, and then it increased to 33.7% at a COD loading rate of 112.5 kg/m3 d. There was no methane detected at this feed COD value for all COD loading rates. It can be clearly observed that the system operated at the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l—with a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d and an HRT of 16 h—provided the maximum hydrogen content in the produced gas."
9,Hydrogen production results,"3.3 Hydrogen production results The hydrogen production rate basically depends on the gas production rate (Fig. 2) and the gas composition (Fig. 3); and the calculated hydrogen production rate as a function of COD loading rate and HRT at different feed COD values is shown in Fig. 4 . For the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l (Fig. 4a), the hydrogen production rate increased with increasing COD loading rate; however, it was quite low at this feed COD value, especially the COD loading rates in the range of 15–22.5 kg/m3 d with the hydrogen production rate only lower than 0.02 l/h. This is possibly due to low hydrogen contents in the produced gas and low gas production rates. The presence of methane throughout the COD loading rate range verifies that the produced hydrogen was partly consumed by the methanogens. For the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l (Fig. 4b), the hydrogen production rate increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached the maximum of 0.55 l/h at a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d because of the highest hydrogen content and gas production rate. After that, it rapidly decreased with further increasing COD loading rate to 75 kg/m3 d. Since the total VFA concentration was found to be quite high at this COD loading rate (as shown later in the part of total VFA concentration), this high total VFA concentration resulted in the low hydrogen production rate due to the toxicity of VFA accumulation [4]. For the feed COD value of 60,000 mg/l (Fig. 4c), the hydrogen production rate was relatively unchanged in the range of 0.17–0.20 l/h between COD loading rates of 45–90 kg/m3 d, and afterward, it increased to reach the maximum of 0.50 l/h at a COD loading rate of 112.5 kg/m3 d. The comparative results at different feed COD values revealed that the hydrogen production rate for the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l—with a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d and an HRT of 16 h—was much higher than those maximum values for both feed COD values of 20,000 and 60,000 mg/l. Therefore, the change in the feed COD value remarkably affected the hydrogen production rate. This is because for any given COD loading rate, an increase in the feed COD value simply decreases HRT, leading to higher hydrogen production efficiency. It is very interesting to point out that for any given feed COD value, an increase in COD loading rate results in decreasing optimum HRT of the system; therefore, the effect of HRT will be further discussed in detail later. Another factor that can greatly inhibit the hydrogen production is the potassium toxicity. As aforementioned, since the as-received distillery wastewater used in this work contains high potassium concentration of about 8800 mg/l (Table 3), which is very close to the strong inhibition range of potassium toxicity level (12,000 mg/l) [36], it was diluted prior to feeding to the ASBR system in order to reduce the potassium toxicity. In this work, the potassium concentrations contained in the diluted distillery wastewater at the different feed COD values of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mg/l are 1,173, 2,347, and 3520 mg/l, respectively. As also mentioned before, the potassium toxicity level in the moderate inhibition range is 2500–4500 mg/l [36], which is still toxic to anaerobic bacteria. This may be a possible reason why the increase in the feed COD value to 60,000 mg/l (with the potassium concentration of 3520 mg/l) resulted in a significantly lower hydrogen production. However, when the distillery wastewater was diluted to obtain the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l (with the potassium concentration of 1173 mg/l, which is much lower than the moderate inhibition range), very low hydrogen production was observed. This was possibly due to the simultaneously low level of organic compounds in the highly diluted wastewater that could be anaerobically converted to hydrogen. Therefore, the experimental results indicate that the diluted distillery wastewater, which still contains sufficient amount of organic compounds (i.e. at the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l) with the potassium concentration slightly lower than such moderate inhibition range of toxicity level (i.e. 2347 mg/l), is the most suitable substrate to be used for hydrogen production from the ASBR system, providing the highest hydrogen production rate at the COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d (Fig. 4b). Apart from the potassium toxicity, the toxicity from sulfate present in the as-received distillery wastewater with high concentration of about 7000 mg/l may also negatively affect the hydrogen production efficiency because the sulfate concentrations in the diluted wastewater at different feed COD values (i.e. 933 mg/l at the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l, 1867 mg/l at 40,000 mg/l, and 2800 mg/l at 60,000 mg/l) reached or even exceeded the sulfate toxicity level to anaerobic bacteria of about 1000 mg/l [39]. It was experimentally found that the sulfate concentration in the effluent at any given feed COD value and COD loading rate was almost the same as that in the feed. These results imply either that the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria was suppressed when operating the investigated ASBR system at a controlled pH of 5.5 [24], or that the sulfate-reducing bacteria might stop their metabolism under the studied operating environments. Since this present study was mainly to investigate the feasibility of hydrogen production from real distillery wastewater, any pretreatment step to reduce the potassium and sulfate toxicity was not investigated. From the experimental results obtained in this work, a high potential for hydrogen production using the ASBR system was observed. An interesting future study would be to reduce the potassium and sulfate toxicity in the distillery wastewater (e.g. by chemical pretreatment), aiming to further enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production. The specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) is very useful as a scale-up parameter, in order to study the economic considerations of hydrogen production from this process. Fig. 5 shows the SHPR as a function of COD loading rate and HRT at different feed COD values. The maximum SHPR of 270 ml H2/g MLVSS d (or 3310 ml H2/l d) was obtained at a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d for the feed COD of 40,000 mg/l since the maximum gas production rate and maximum hydrogen content in the produced gas were achieved at these operating conditions (Figs. 2b and 3b). When considering the variation in hydrogen production with respect to the HRT, it can be seen that the HRT greatly affected microbial activity and metabolic products, leading to variations in gas production rate, gas composition, hydrogen production rate, and SHPR. The results show that for both systems with the feed COD values of 20,000 and 60,000 mg/l, the hydrogen production rate (Fig. 4) and SHPR (Fig. 5) tended to increase when the HRT was reduced from 32 to 13 h, and reached the maximum values at 13 h HRT. This indicates that a shorter HRT can reduce the methanogenic step, leading to higher hydrogen and lower methane contents in the produced gas. This is because the hydrogen-producing bacteria have a much shorter doubling time than the methane-producing bacteria. Interestingly, at the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l, the hydrogen production rate and SHPR also increased, to reach the highest values of 0.55 l/h and 270 ml H2/g MLVSS d (or 3310 ml H2/l d), respectively, when the HRT was reduced from 32 to 16 h; but a further reduction in the HRT to 13 h resulted in the decreases in both the hydrogen production rate and SHPR to 0.38 l/h and 182 ml H2/g MLVSS d (or 2265 ml H2/l d), respectively. This can be explained with the aid of the VFA concentration results and the relation with the changes in both microbial concentration and the microbial washout, as discussed later. The hydrogen yield in terms of ml of hydrogen produced per g of COD removed as a function of COD loading rate and HRT at different feed COD values is shown in Fig. 6 . For the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l (Fig. 6a), the hydrogen yield sharply increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached the maximum of 178 ml H2/g COD removed at a COD loading rate of 37.5 kg/m3 d (13 h HRT). For the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l (Fig. 6b), the hydrogen yield rapidly increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached the maximum of 172 ml H2/g COD removed at a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d (16 h HRT), and then it decreased with further increasing COD loading rate up to 75 kg/m3 d. For the feed COD value of 60,000 mg/l (Fig. 6c), the hydrogen yield dropped when increasing COD loading rate to 67.5 kg/m3 d, and then became nearly constant in the COD loading rate range of 67.5–90 kg/m3 d. Afterward, it slightly increased with further increasing COD loading rate to 112.5 kg/m3 d. When comparing the results of the three feed COD values, the maximum hydrogen yield tended to decrease with increasing feed COD value, and a higher COD loading rate was required to obtain a maximum hydrogen yield at a corresponding higher feed COD value. The feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l and the COD loading rate of 37.5 kg/m3 d (13 h HRT) gave the highest hydrogen yield (178 ml H2/g COD removed). However, the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l and the COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d (16 h HRT) were considered to be the optimum conditions for the hydrogen production, since the maximum hydrogen production rate (Fig. 4b) and maximum SHPR (Fig. 5b) were obtained, and the hydrogen yield of 171 ml H2/g COD removed was only slightly lower than that at the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l and the COD loading rate of 37.5 kg/m3 d."
10,VFA results,"3.4 VFA results An anaerobic system not only involves the degradation of soluble organic compounds in a wastewater to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane, but also accompanies the VFA production, which greatly affects the process performance of the hydrogen-producing bacteria in the system. The total VFA concentrations as a function of COD loading rate and HRT at different feed COD values are shown in Fig. 7 . It was clearly observed that the total VFA concentration increased with increasing COD loading rate for all feed COD values. The highest total VFA concentrations of 16,400, 23,200, and 22,300 mg/l were found at the COD loading rates of 37.5, 75, and 112.5 kg/m3 d at the feed COD values of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mg/l, respectively. At the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l and the COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d, the maximum gas production rate (Fig. 2b) and maximum hydrogen content in the produced gas (Fig. 3b) were obtained with a total VFA concentration of 18,400 mg/l; however, at this feed COD value, a further increase in the COD loading rate to 75 kg/m3 d negatively affected the gas production rate and the hydrogen content possibly due to an overly high total VFA production of 23,200 mg/l, which was the highest total VFA concentration among the investigated three feed COD values. As mentioned above, the gas production rate (Fig. 2b), the hydrogen content in the produced gas (Fig. 3b), and the hydrogen production rate (Fig. 4b) reached maximum values at the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l (with a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d and an HRT of 16 h). From the results, it can be concluded that the hydrogen production efficiency is greatly reduced by increasing VFA concentration in the bioreactor. The extremely toxic level of VFA was found at around 22,000 mg/l, which resulted in the reduction of the microbial concentration in the system and the increase in the microbial washout from the system, as discussed in the next section. The VFA compositions and ethanol concentration in the effluents at different COD loading rates and feed COD values are also shown in Fig. 7. For any given COD loading rate and feed COD value, the main VFA components were acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid with zero concentration of ethanol. It should be noted here that under the studied conditions, the ASBR system treating the distillery wastewater did not produce any other alcohols. For any given feed COD value, the concentrations of acetic, butyric, and valeric acids increased with increasing COD loading rate; however, the propionic acid concentration tended to decrease. The butyric and acetic acid formations in an anaerobic system have been found to be derived from the favorable metabolic pathways of acidogenic bacteria for the hydrogen production, whereas the propionic acid is generated from the metabolic pathway for the consumption of produced hydrogen [38]. The concentrations of butyric and acetic acids were quite high at the COD loading rates of 37.5, 60, and 112.5 kg/m3 d for the feed COD values of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mg/l, respectively, leading to the observed maximum hydrogen content in the produced gas (Fig. 3a–c), as well as the maximum hydrogen production rate (Fig. 4). At any given feed COD value, the concentration of propionic acid decreased while the concentration of butyric acid increased. These results indicate that the simultaneously obtained high butyric acid concentration and low propionic acid concentration is a clear evidence of bacterial metabolic shift toward higher hydrogen production. These results agree well with the work of Cohen et al. [40], who reported a linear inverse relationship between butyric acid and propionic acid concentrations and also a linear positive correlation between butyric acid concentration and hydrogen production. The valeric acid concentration also had the same trend as the butyric and acetic acid concentrations; its concentration increased with increasing COD loading rate. The overloading of organic substrate in the bioreactor can lead to an increase in the accumulation of reduced product like valeric acid [41]. Therefore, a higher concentration of valeric acid was produced at higher COD loading rates and higher feed COD values."
11,Microbial concentration and microbial washout results,"3.5 Microbial concentration and microbial washout results Fig. 8 a shows the microbial concentration in the bioreactor in terms of MLVSS as a function of COD loading rate at different feed COD values. At the feed COD value of 20,000 mg/l, the MLVSS tended to decrease slightly with increasing COD loading rate. However, the sludge washout indicated by the VSS was found to increase with increasing COD loading rate (Fig. 8b). As mentioned above, the methane content in the produced gas decreased with increasing COD loading rate. The results suggest that the increasing washout in conjunction with decreasing microbial concentration in the bioreactor resulted from the increasing loss of the methanogens from the system with increasing COD loading rate. As a consequence, the hydrogen-producing bacteria became more predominant with increasing COD loading rates. At the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l, the MLVSS rapidly decreased when increasing COD loading rate from 30 to 45 kg/m3 d, suggesting a drastic loss of the methanogens from the system at this high COD loading rate of 45 kg/m3 d. Afterward, the bacterial concentration slightly increased with increasing COD loading rate in the range of 45–75 kg/m3 d, indicating that the remaining hydrogen-producing bacteria started increasing because of more substrate available in the system. For the feed COD value of 60,000 mg/l, the MLVSS rapidly dropped from 12,100 mg/l to 11,000 mg/l with increasing COD loading rate from 45 to 67.5 kg/m3 d. After that, it increased with further increasing COD loading rates, and reached the maximum amount of 12,800 mg/l at the COD loading rate of 112.5 kg/m3 d. The same explanation used for the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l can be used for the results of 60,000 mg/l. From the results, the comparatively high MLVSS obtained at the feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l and the COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d implies that these conditions were the most appropriate for the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria in this work, resulting in the highest gas production rate (Fig. 2b), as explained above. The comparatively low microbial washout from the bioreactor was also observed under these conditions (Fig. 8b). The dilution is therefore necessary for maximizing the hydrogen production from the distillery wastewater in order to reduce the toxicity of potassium and sulfate to the hydrogen-producing bacteria. Once more, the studied distillery wastewater had to be diluted to obtain a maximum feed COD value of 60,000 mg/l, and the very severe toxicity of potassium and sulfate to the hydrogen-producing bacteria could be clearly observed beyond this feed COD value."
12,Conclusions,"The hydrogen production from alcohol distillery wastewater by using ASBR system under a mesophilic temperature of 37 °C and a controlled pH at 5.5 was found to greatly depend on the feed COD value and COD loading rate, as well as hydraulic retention time (HRT). A dilution was found to be necessary for the reduction of potassium and sulfate toxicity to the hydrogen-producing bacteria. The feed COD value of 40,000 mg/l gave the highest hydrogen production rate. At this feed COD value (with a dilution ratio of 3.75), the best conditions for a maximum hydrogen yield (172 ml H2/g COD removed) and specific hydrogen production rate (270 ml H2/g MLVSS d (or 3310 ml H2/l d)) were a COD loading rate of 60 kg/m3 d and an HRT of 16 h. Only hydrogen and carbon dioxide were found in the produced gas under these optimum conditions."
