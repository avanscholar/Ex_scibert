0,Introduction,"The particulate matter (PM) emitted by compression-ignition (CI) engines is seriously harmful to the ecological environment and human health [1,2]. In recent years, oxygenated fuels have attracted much attention for their clear advantages in reducing particle emissions and reducing dependence on fossil fuels [3]. Among them, alcohol fuels are considered to be very promising alternative fuels for CI engines because of their high-octane number, low carbon content, sulfur-free elements, renewable and higher oxygen content than traditional fossil fuels [4,5]. Alcohol fuel consists of straight-chain carbon or branched-chain carbon plus hydroxyl [6]. Alcohols with less than or equal to three carbon atoms in the carbon chain are low-carbon chain alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol [7]. In contrast, the alcohols with more than three carbon atoms are high-carbon chain alcohols, such as n-butanol [8], and n-octanol, etc [9]. Regarding the application of alcohol-diesel mixture in CI engines, it has been shown that blending alcohol fuel in diesel can significantly reduce soot emissions [10-13]. However, the physicochemical properties, combustion characteristics and abatement effect on particles vary considerably for the carbon chain lengths of alcohols. For example, high-carbon chain alcohol has higher low heating value, auto-ignition temperature and flame speed compared to low-carbon chain alcohol, but the oxygen content is reduced [14]. In addition, it was found that alcohols with different carbon chain lengths had different premixed combustion ratio, and different dilution effect on normal alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons, resulting in differences in their effectiveness in reducing particle emissions [15]. It can be seen that the carbon chain length of alcohol fuels affects the combustion process of the engine, which ultimately leads to differences in the reduction of particles. In addition to focusing on the inhibitory effect of oxygenated fuels on particle formation, researchers have also carried out in-depth studies on the physicochemical properties of particles [16]. This is because the physicochemical properties have an important influence on the oxidation activity of the particles in the diesel particle filter (DPF), which ultimately determines whether the particle emissions from the CI engine will meet the stringent regulations [17]. The graphitization degree is an important indicator to measure the defects of the microchip layer in the internal structure of the particles [18]. Wei et al. [19] studied the influence of the addition of methanol on the graphitization degree of diesel engine particles. It was found that the addition of methanol can significantly reduce the graphitization degree of the particles, and continued to decrease with the increase of the methanol blending ratio, which increased the reactivity of the particles. Zhou et al. [20] studied the graphitization characteristics of diesel/n-octanol mixed fuel. It was found that the higher n-octanol concentration resulted in an increased proportion of amorphous carbon and the increased graphite layer curvature, thus leading to lower graphitization degree and higher particle reactivity. Wang et al. [21] studied the effect of n-pentanol additives on the graphitization degree of particles. It was found that as the mixing ratio of n-pentanol increased, the content of disordered carbon and amorphous carbon continued to increase, indicating that the graphitization degree decreased. The research of Chen et al. [22] also found that the particles would have more defective structures and the lower graphitization degree by increasing the proportion of n-pentanol in the mixed fuel. However, some studies showed the graphitization degree of particles was not linearly related to the oxidation activity. The initial structure of the particles did not determine the oxidation activity, but that the initial functional groups on their surface had an important influence on the oxidation activity [23]. It can be seen that in the current literature, alcohol fuels significantly reduce the graphitization degree of the particles. However, studies on the effect of lower and higher alcohols on the graphitization degree at the same oxygen content have not been carried out. In addition, more research is needed on the relationship between the graphitization degree of the particles and the oxidation activity. Under the process of particle generation and oxidation, there are a large number of functional groups at the edges or defects of short-chain crystallites, mainly including aliphatic C–H functional groups and oxygenated functional groups [24]. The type and concentration of these intermediate combustion products play an important role in the generation and oxidation of particles [25,26]. Wang et al. [27] used a full-cylinder sampling system to study the surface functional groups of particles under different loads. It was found that the oxidation activity of the particles was more affected by the surface aliphatic C–H functional groups than by the oxygenated functional groups. Zhao et al. [28] investigated the effect of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the physicochemical properties of diesel particles. It was found that as the EGR rate increased, the aromatic and graphitic carbon content of the particles decreased, but the content of oxygenated functional groups and aliphatic C–H functional groups increased, which strongly contributed to the oxidation activity of particles. However, Alfè et al. showed [29] that there was no simple linear relationship between C–H functional group content and particle oxidation activity. In the study of aliphatic C–H functional groups of alcohol particles, Fan et al. [30] found that the addition of methanol would reduce the content of aliphatic C–H functional groups, but they did not analyze the effect of C–H content on oxidation activity of particles. In addition, there is a research gap regarding the effect of carbon chain length of alcohols on aliphatic C–H functional groups. Moreover, further exploration is needed about the relationship between aliphatic C–H functional groups and the oxidative reactivity of the particles. In addition to the graphitization degree and functional groups, the O/C ratio on the surface of the particles and the hybridization mode of C atoms are also closely related to the oxidation activity [31]. Song et al. found [32] that the addition of biodiesel to the fuel increased the oxidation rate and reduced the ignition temperature of the soot. They attributed this phenomenon to the high oxygen content of the particle surface. This is because the O atoms on the surface of the particles enable the automatic formation and release of CO and CO2 without the involvement of the surrounding O2. The sp3 and sp2 are the main hybridization mode of C atoms in particles, and the number and spatial relationships of C atoms in these two states are closely related to the formation and oxidation of particles. Jaramillo et al. [33] found that the sp2 to sp3 ratio of oxygenated fuels is six times lower than that of other fuels, resulting in microcrystals on the surface of the particles that break easily, thus making the activation energy lower. In the study of the O/C ratio and the hybridization mode of C atoms of alcohol particle surface, Fan et al. [30] found that there was no significant correlation between the O/C ratio and the methanol blending ratio. In addition, there is a research gap regarding the effect of different carbon chain length alcohols on the O/C ratio and the hybridization mode of C atoms. Meanwhile, further studies are needed on the effects of O/C ratio and the hybridization mode of C atoms with the oxidation activity of the particles. Substantially, alcohol fuels can reduce diesel soot particles and alleviate the shortage of fossil energy. In addition, the carbon chain length of the alcohols has different inhibiting effects on the generation of particles. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of particles are highly correlated with fuel characteristics, which ultimately impact the oxidation activity of the particles. However, the current researches on alcohols with different carbon chain lengths are still focused on the regular emission characteristics such as particle mass and particle number emission rules. Fewer studies have been reported on the physicochemical properties of alcohol particles with different carbon chain lengths. In particular, there are gaps in systematic studies on the graphitization degree, C–H functional groups, O/C ratios and carbon atom hybridization of alcohol particles with different carbon chain lengths. Furthermore, no regular knowledge has been obtained on the relationship between the microscopic physicochemical properties and the oxidative activity of alcohol particles with different carbon chain lengths. Therefore, this paper has conducted an in-depth study of the microscopic physicochemical properties of particles for alcohols with different carbon chain lengths (methanol, n-butanol, n-octanol)-diesel mixture. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the oxidation activity of particles to physicochemical properties is profiled by Partial Least Square (PLS). This study has important theoretical significance for understanding the particle properties and has important engineering value for guiding the improvement of diesel particle filter."
1,Experimental equipment and methods,
2,Experimental equipment,"2.1 Experimental equipment Fig. 1 is the test system established in this research. The whole system comprises three parts: combustion test system, pollutant test system and particle dilution sampling system. The system can quickly and accurately adjust test conditions, timely monitor and record engine operating parameters, and accurately collect and measure combustion parameters and particle pollutants. The engine used in the experiment is a supercharged, water-cooled, four-cylinder, direct-injection commercial diesel engine. The engine model is YC4Y22-15050. Table 1 shows the specific parameters of the engine. During the experiment, the temperature of intake air and cooling water were controlled at 30 ± 1 °C and 85 ± 2 °C, respectively. The inlet pressure was maintained at 0.15 MPa. The engine speed and load were controlled by a PowerLink eddy current dynamometer. The engine speed was maintained at 1400 rpm, and the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) was controlled at 0.6 MPa and 1.2 MPa. In addition, the ETAS INCA 6.2 software was used to adjust parameters such as injection timing, injection volume and injection pressure. The engine injection timing was maintained at −3 °CA ATDC, and the injection pressure was maintained at 120 MPa under all experimental conditions. Table 2 shows the engine operating parameters."
3,Experimental fuels,"2.2 Experimental fuels The low- to high-carbon chain alcohols used in this article include methanol, n-butanol and n-octanol. The pure diesel fuel (named D100) is used as the experimental base fuel, the D100 is blended with alcohols in different volume ratios so as to keep the oxygen content of the blending fuel near 5%. The three mixed fuels are named M10 (90% diesel, 10% methanol), NB25 (75% diesel, 25% n-butanol), and NO45 (55% diesel, 45% n-octanol). In order to prepare the unstratified mixture fuel, the alcohol was first mixed with diesel using an ultrasonic vibration device and then further stirred using a magnetic stirrer mounted in the tank. Moreover, the blending fuel had been prepared before the experiment to ensure the homogeneity of the mixture. Table 3 shows the properties of base fuels and mixed fuels."
4,Particle sampling and pretreatment,"2.3 Particle sampling and pretreatment During the experiment, when the engine reached the steady state, it began to collect particle samples. During the sampling process, a vacuum pump was used to pump the exhaust gas from the diesel engine. The exhaust particles will first enter the diluter (the dilution ratio is 10:1 to 20:1), and undergo the process of dilution and cooling (below 50 °C). The exhaust gas particles then flowed through and were deposited on a Teflon filter membrane (PallGelman, USA) to complete the sampling process. The PM sampling time depends on the engine working conditions, and the sampling time is 10–30 min. After sampling, the filter membrane was dried and placed in a dichloromethane solution for ultrasonic vibration for 30 min. The ultrasonic vibrations could not only detach the particles from the filter membrane, but also dissolve the soluble organic matter on the particles in the dichloromethane solution. The dichloromethane solution containing the particles was then transferred into clean centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged with a benchtop centrifuge (TDL-60C) at 2000 r/min for 15 min. Finally, the solution on the upper layer of the centrifuge tube was removed, and the remaining particles were soot particles without organic matter."
5,Characterization test of particle samples,"2.4 Characterization test of particle samples 2.4.1 Microscopic Raman spectroscopy test Raman spectroscopy can determine the structural information of carbon-containing materials based on the vibration frequency of molecules. By observing the Raman spectrum curve, the lattice defects and the graphitization degree of particles can be analyzed. The RM2000 micro Raman spectrometer from Renishaw, UK, was used in this experiment. The specific parameters are shown in Table 4 . Ten different areas were randomly scanned for each test sample, and then took the average to reduce experimental error. In order to minimize the noise in the spectrum, each area was scanned three times in total. 2.4.2 Fourier Transform infrared test In this paper, the KBr tableting method was used for Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis of samples to study the C–H functional groups on the surface of the particles. Before the experiment, the KBr powder and particle samples were placed in a vacuum drying oven to fully dry for 24 h to avoid interference from moisture. Before the particle samples were detected, a blank experiment of pure KBr powder was performed to obtain the infrared spectrum background curve. Firstly, the pure KBr powder was ground in a mortar for 4–5 min until it could hang on the wall. Then, the ground sample was filled into a tablet pressing tool and placed on a tablet press with a pressure of 10 MPa for 10–15 min to form a tablet with a thickness of about 0.5 mm. Next, the pressed tablet was placed into the sample chamber of the infrared spectrometer (Vertex 70 FTIR) for scanning to obtain the background atlas. Table 5 shows the main technical parameters of the instrument. Finally, the KBr powder and soot particles were mixed and ground at a mass ratio of 20:1, and then the samples were tested according to the same steps as above. After the sample spectrum was obtained, the background spectrum was subtracted to obtain the infrared spectrum of the particles. In addition, three spectra were collected for each particle sample to ensure reproducibility, and the average value was taken to reduce errors. The uncertainty of FTIR results was less than 5%. 2.4.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test The PHI-1600ESCA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) was used to analyze the samples. The main technical indicators of the equipment are shown in Table 6 . The O/C ratio and the sp3/sp2 hybridization ratio of carbon atoms were obtained by XPS analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Analysis of graphitization degree of soot Particles.,"3.1 Analysis of graphitization degree of soot Particles. Fig. 2 is the Raman spectrum curves of alcohol-diesel mixed fuel particles. Although the mixed fuel particles show similar curve characteristics, there are still some significant differences in their internal structure information [34]. Therefore, in order to obtain the change law of the chemical heterogeneity and graphitization degree of different fuel particles under different engine conditions, it is necessary to perform peak fitting of the Raman spectra of the particles. In this study, four Lorentzian peaks and one Gaussian peak are fitted using the method used by Sadezky et al. [35]. After the original peak is fitted, there are five spectral bands, namely D4 peak (1180 cm-1), D3 peak (1510 cm-1), D2 peak (1610 cm-1), D1 peak (1360 cm-1) and G peak (1580 cm-1). The G peak represents the ideal graphite structure; the D1 peak is the disordered carbon structure; the D3 peak is caused by the amorphous carbon component and contains functional groups, organic components and fragments within the diesel exhaust particles; the D2 peak is the shoulder of the G peak and is caused by the disordered graphite lattice vibrations at the edge of the graphene layer; the D4 peak is the shoulder of the D1 peak and is caused by the C = C stretching vibrations in the polyolefin-like structure. According to the fitting result of the split peak curve, the parameters characterizing the graphitization structure of the particles are obtained. The D1-full width at half maximum (D1-FWHM) is the difference between the two horizontal coordinate values corresponding to half the maximum intensity of the D1 peak. It reflects the chemical heterogeneity of the particles [36]. The larger the D1-FWHM, the more substances contained in the particles, and the stronger the chemical heterogeneity. The variation of D1-FWHM of different mixed fuel particles is shown in Fig. 3 . As the load increases from 0.6 MPa to 1.2 MPa, the D1-FWHM of all fuel particles decreases. This is because a large amount of unburned fuel organic matter adheres to the surface of soot particles under low load. As the load increases, the combustion becomes more complete, thereby reducing incomplete combustion products, resulting in a decrease in chemical heterogeneity [36]. In addition, Wang et al. [37] believed that under low load, a larger D1-FWHM indicated that the particles had fewer crystalline phases and therefore had fewer ordered graphite-like structures. In addition, whether the engine is under high load or low load, the D100 particle has the highest D1-FWHM, and the addition of alcohol fuel will reduce the D1-FWHM. This is because the aromatic hydrocarbons in pure diesel are prone to produce small molecular groups such as acetylene and propargyl, which help to form the C5 ring structure, which makes the crystallites of the primary particles more curved and causes the external defects of the particles to increase [38,39]. Therefore, more defects have more active sites to adsorb organic matter, making the D100 particles have the highest chemical heterogeneity. Moreover, the high oxygen content of the alcohol fuel improves the combustion process and thus increases the peak in-cylinder temperature (see Table 7 . Therefore, for D100 fuel, the lower temperature in the cylinder reduces the oxidation of the surface chemicals on the particles, resulting in a highest D1-FWHM. However, for different load conditions, the D1-FWHM of alcohol particles with different carbon chain lengths show different rules. Under high load, with the use of M10 to NO45, the D1-FWHM continues to decrease. This is because in order to maintain the same oxygen content, the blending ratio of high-carbon chain alcohols continues to increase, resulting in a substantial decrease in the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons. This will reduce the overall content of small molecules in the engine cylinder, so that the content of gas-phase hydrocarbons that can be adsorbed is reduced. Meanwhile, due to the reduction of external defects, the ability of the particle surface to adsorb gaseous hydrocarbons is reduced. These two reasons have caused the continuous decrease of D1-FWHM under high load. However, among all the mixed fuel particles, the D1-FWHM of NB25 particle is the largest under low load. This may be due to the combined effect of the low cetane number, high viscosity, and high latent heat of vaporization of NB25 fuel, which makes the ignition delay time the longest and delays the combustion phase [40]. Therefore, the oxidation time of gaseous hydrocarbons and other substances on the surface of the particles is shortened, and the chemical heterogeneity of exhaust particles is increased. The ratio of the area of the D1 peak, D3 peak and D4 peak to the area of the G peak is usually used to evaluate the degree of disorder and graphitization of the particles [20,22]. Fig. 4 shows the ratios of AD1/AG, AD3/AG and AD4/AG of different fuel particles. For the same fuel, as the load increases, the area ratio of the D peak to the G peak under most operating conditions decreases, indicating that the order degree of particles increases. This is because the order of soot particles is related to their internal lattice arrangement. The nascent particle has an irregular structure of crystallites and a low degree of ordering [39]. The microcrystals inside the mature soot are arranged regularly, and the particles are highly ordered [39]. When the load increases, the amount of fuel injection increases, resulting in the lower in-cylinder air–fuel ratio relative to low load (see Table 7. Therefore, more incompletely combusted fuels are cracked at high temperatures to form reactive groups of unsaturated hydrocarbons. As a result, particles continue to grow, and the degree of order increases, which increases graphitization degree [41]. In addition, under high load, the oxidation reaction of the particle crystallites becomes more intense due to the high in-cylinder temperature. Moreover, the disordered microcrystals at the edges of particles are more susceptible to oxidation, and are easy to combine with amorphous carbon or adjacent microcrystals, which increases the order of the microcrystals and the graphitization degree [42]. Under low load, the oxidation effect is weak due to the low in-cylinder temperature, which ultimately leads to more disordered structures in the soot particles. When the alcohol-diesel blended fuel is used, the ratio of AD1/AG of the particles decreases, indicating an increase in graphitization and an increase in the orderliness of the carbon layer of the particles. Compared with mixed fuels, the pure diesel contains aromatics and cycloalkanes, which make diesel particles more likely to form C5 ring structures, causing defects in particle crystallites and a lower graphitization degree. In addition, the atomic activity at the edges of the carbon layer of the particle is much higher than that at the base, and the OH radicals in alcohol fuels are the main substances that react with the carbon atoms in oxidation. Therefore, the alcohol fuels increase the degree of oxidation of the particles, reducing the number of disordered crystallites, thereby increasing the graphitization degree of the particles [43,44]. However, under different loads, the carbon chain length of alcohol fuels has different effects on the graphitization degree. Under high load, the value of AD1/AG continues to decrease with the use of low- to high-carbon chain alcohols, indicating that the graphitization degree continues to increase. This is because under high load, the fuel is more likely to crack into small molecular fragments, and the addition of small molecules is easier to promote the growth of soot particles, that is, the dehydrogenation aromatization reaction is dominant under high load [45]. The aromatic hydrocarbons in diesel are easy to generate small molecular groups and promote the formation of C5 ring structure. The increase of the C5 ring structure will reduce the order of the overall structure of the carbon particles, which will reduce the graphitization degree [38]. With the use of M10 to NO45, in order to maintain the same oxygen content, the blending ratio of alcohol in the mixed fuel is increased, thereby reducing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons, resulting in the reduced C5 structure and the increased graphitization degree. Under low load, the ratio of AD1/AG of M10 particles is the smallest, indicating that the graphitization degree of M10 particles is the highest, which is different from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results in our previous study [40]. In the studies of Wei et al. [46], Agudelo et al. [47], and Pfau et al. [48], this phenomenon also appeared, that is, the nanostructure of the particles is not always correlated with the AD1/AG ratio. The ratio of AD3/AG and AD4/AG represents the degree of disorder of particles and the irregularity of their microstructure [49]. With the use of alcohol fuels, the AD3/AG ratio decreases. Moreover, with the use of low- to high-carbon chain alcohols, the AD3/AG ratio continues to decrease. This shows that the amount of amorphous carbon such as organic molecules, lamellar structure and functional groups in particles is constantly decreasing, and the particles tend to develop in an orderly manner [50]. This is because the oxygenated nature of alcohol fuels promotes the combustion process, which results in higher in-cylinder temperatures (see Table 7, leading to increased oxidation of organic matter and functional groups at the edges of the particle microcrystals, thus reducing the AD3/AG and AD4/AG ratios [51]."
8,Aliphatic C–H functional groups on particle surface,"3.2 Aliphatic C–H functional groups on particle surface The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) is used to analyze the functional groups on the surface of the particles. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR curves of different mixed fuel particles. It can be seen that for different particles, their spectral curves show similar change characteristics, indicating that the composition of the functional groups present in the particles is similar. However, the differences in the intensity of different peaks are also observed in the spectra, which indicates the difference in the distribution of functional groups. Therefore, in order to distinguish the functional groups to which the different absorption peaks belong, the FTIR curve of the particles was fitted by peak fitting [52]. The surface functional groups corresponding to the absorption peaks at main characteristic positions are shown in Table 8 . In order to compare the changes of aliphatic C–H functional groups on the surface of particles, the aliphatic peaks around 2850 cm−1 to 2960 cm−1 are used as the characteristic peaks for carbon-hydrogen bonding, and the aromatic peaks around 1610 cm−1 are used as the characteristic peak for carbon–carbon bonding. The ratio of the peak areas of the two characteristic peaks is used to evaluate the changes in the aliphatic C–H functional groups on the surface of the particles [27]. Fig. 6 shows the C–H/C = C ratio on the surface of different fuel particles. When the load increases from 0.6 MPa to 1.2 MPa, the ratio of C–H/C = C has no obvious change rule. This is because the C–H functional groups on the surface of particles are the result of competition between production and consumption. On the one hand, the in-cylinder temperature increases as the load increases, which increases the high-temperature dehydrogenation and carbonization reactions of the C–H functional groups, thereby reducing the content of aliphatic C–H functional groups [53,54]. On the other hand, as the load increases, the fuel is easily cracked into small hydrocarbon groups. The high concentration of hydrocarbon groups increases the possibility of attaching to particles and becoming aliphatic C–H functional groups. Therefore, the content of C–H functional groups on the particle surface is the result of the combined effect of generation and consumption. For the D100 particle and the NO45 particle, the consumption effect is dominant. As for the M10 particle and the NB25 particle, the generation effect shows a more significant effect. In addition, compared with pure diesel, the ratio of C–H/C = C of mixed fuel particles is significantly reduced. This is because the pyrolysis of alcohol fuels will generate OH radicals, which can oxidize particle precursors and promote particle maturation, thereby reducing the bond sites between C–H functional groups and crystallites, resulting in lower aliphatic C–H groups [55]. Moreover, compared with pure diesel, the high in-cylinder temperature when burning alcohol fuels increases the oxidation of functional groups on the surface of the particles, resulting in a decrease in C–H content. In addition, because the carbon chain of M10 fuel is the shortest, the OH is the easiest to decompose. Therefore, the C–H functional group content of M10 particle is the lowest in all mixed fuel particles. With the use of low- to high-carbon chain alcohol fuels, the OH is not easy to dissociate, thereby weakening the degree of oxidation of particle precursors. This not only increases the number of newly generated particle precursors and increases the binding sites of the C–H functional group, but also inhibits the oxidation reaction of the C–H functional group itself, so that the C–H functional group continues to increase [52]."
9,O/C ratio and sp3/sp2 ratio,"3.3 O/C ratio and sp3/sp2 ratio Except for C–H functional groups, there are also many oxygenated functional groups on the surface of soot particles, mainly in the form of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. During the combustion process, the particles are constantly oxidized by oxidizing substances such as O and OH in the surrounding environment. The oxygenated functional groups are generated as intermediate products. According to reports, the oxidation reactivity is related to the oxygen content on the surface of the particles [32]. The full spectrum of X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) can be used to detect the oxygen content and carbon content on the surface of the particles [56]. The O/C ratio is the molar ratio of oxygen to carbon obtained from the peak area of the C1s peak and the O1s peak in the XPS full spectrum scan [18]. Fig. 7 shows the O/C ratio of different fuel particles. As the load increases, the O/C ratio decreases. On the one hand, the high air–fuel ratio at low load increases the possibility of particles contacting oxygen, so that more atoms at the edge of the carbon layer combine with surrounding oxygenated free radicals [57]. On the other hand, the lower temperature in the cylinder under low load weakens the oxidation reaction process of the oxygenated functional groups attached to the surface of the particles [58]. These two reasons make the O/C ratio higher under low load. Under high load, the high temperature promotes the oxidation of particles, and the oxygenated functional groups detach from the surface of the soot particles in gaseous form, resulting in a decrease in the O/C ratio [56]. Under the same load, the O/C ratio of pure diesel is the highest, and the addition of alcohol fuel will reduce the O/C ratio. This is because the aromatics and cycloalkanes in pure diesel will increase the disorder degree of the particles and provide more active sites, making the active oxygenated groups in the combustion environment easier to combine with the edge carbon atoms, thereby increasing the O/C ratio [59]. Moreover, compared with pure diesel, the high in-cylinder temperature when burning alcohol fuels increases the oxidation of oxygenated surface functional groups on the surface of the particles, resulting in a decrease in O/C ratio. In addition, with the use of M10 fuel to NO45 fuel, the O/C ratio first decreases and then increases. This is because the viscosity of NO45 is the highest, which deteriorates the atomization process, thereby reducing the uniformity of the mixture, and making the soot precursors relatively increase. In addition, the higher number of carbon atoms in the NO45 structure will also increase the soot precursors. The increase in precursors provides more attachment sites for O radicals, which leads to an increase in the O/C ratio [24,44]. By deconvolving the C1 peak, the binding state of carbon on the particle surface can be quantified [60]. The types of carbon atom hybridization on particle surface mainly include sp3 and sp2. The ratio of sp3/sp2 can indirectly reflect the characteristics of the microstructure. The increase in content of sp3 means an increase in the disorder degree of the particles. On the contrary, the increase in sp2 content indicates an increase in the order degree of the particles [56]. Fig. 8 shows the ratio of sp3/sp2 for different fuel particles. For the same fuel particle, there are competing effects of increasing load on the sp3/sp2 ratio. First, under high load, the high pressure and temperature in the cylinder will promote the transition of particles to a more orderly state, causing the sp3/sp2 ratio to decrease [61]. On the other hand, under high load, the increase of fuel injection amount increases the number of newly generated particles, that is, the increase of immature particles [62], which means that the disordered sp3 carbon atoms on the surface of the particles increase, resulting in sp3/sp2 ratio increases. It can be seen that in this study, for D100 particle, NB25 particle and NO45 particle, the oxidation effect of temperature on the particles dominated, resulting in a lower sp3/sp2 ratio at high load. While for M10 particle, the increase mechanism of immature particles dominated, resulting in an increase of sp3/sp2 ratio at high load. Under two loads, the sp3/sp2 ratio of different fuel particles are consistent with the changing trend of AD1/AG. This further proves that the addition of alcohol fuel will increase the order of particles."
10,Sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting the oxidation activity of particles,"3.4 Sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting the oxidation activity of particles Fuel characteristics and engine operating conditions change the microscopic physicochemical properties of the particles by controlling the combustion state, which ultimately determines the difference in the oxidation activity of the particles. In order to analyze the contribution of the microscopic physicochemical properties of alcohol particles with different carbon chain length to the oxidation activity, this section uses Partial Least square (PLS) to perform a sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the particles. The PLS uses the idea of component extraction to make the new composite variable represent as much information as possible from the original set of variables, while being able to explain the dependent variable to a greater extent [63]. In addition, the PLS can effectively solve the problem of multiple correlations between variables, and can perform regression modeling when the sample size is less than the number of variables. Therefore, the PLS method is very suitable for sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting the Ea of particles in this paper. The Ea of soot particles was selected as the target dependent variable (Y) and twelve microscopic physicochemical property parameters were selected as independent variables (X), as shown in Table 9 . It should be noted that in addition to the data provided in this article, other parameter data comes from our previous research [40]. It is worth noting that the data in literature [40] and this paper are derived from the same set of particle samples. This paper uses five principal components, and the cumulative variance of the independent variables of the explanatory model is 0.975, and the cumulative variance of the dependent variables is 0.992. The Ea regression model of the particles was calculated using the PLC built-in program of Matlab. The following equation is obtained: Y = 467.53 - 0.53 X 1 + 21.59 X 2 - 46.30 X 3 - 1201.68 X 4 + 17.66 X 5 + 1.36 X 6 - 17.34 X 7 - 39.93 X 8 + 14.99 X 9 + 19.57 X 10 + 75.55 X 11 - 18.57 X 12 Fig. 9 a shows the comparison curve of the fitted value and the actual value of Ea. It can be found that the relative error between the experimental value and the fitted value of Ea is less than 1.5%, which shows that the model and its analysis results are in good agreement with the measured results. Fig. 9b shows the contribution degree of each variable on Ea (regression coefficients have been standardized). By calculating the absolute value of the regression coefficient of each variable in Fig. 9b, the contribution degree of each variable on Ea can be obtained. It can be found that the fringe separation distance (d) and fringe length (La ) of particles are the two factors that have the greatest impact on the Ea, especially the effect of d on the oxidation activity is more prominent. This is due to the fact that a larger d represents the looser the internal structure of the primary particles and the more isolated microcrystal layers, that is, the more boundary defects between the microcrystal layers, which can promote the oxidation of the particles and improve their reactivity. Interestingly, among the characteristic parameters of Raman spectroscopy, the D1-FWHM contributes the most to Ea. It can be concluded that there is a close relationship between the chemical heterogeneity and the oxidation activity of the particles, which is rarely mentioned in previous studies. In addition, the AD3/AG of soot particles has a strong ability to explain Ea, indicating that the amorphous carbon on the surface of particles is a key factor affecting the oxidation characteristics of the particles. However, surprisingly, unlike AD1/AG and AD3/AG, the AD4/AG is positively correlated with the Ea. This means that the D4 band alone cannot represent the disordered state in the particle structure, but the D1, D3 and D4 should be considered together [35]. However, the O/C ratio and sp3/sp2 ratio on the surface of the particles have a lower ability to explain the oxidation activity, which is similar to the findings of Yehliu et al. [64]. In addition, compared with the O/C ratio and sp3/sp2 ratio, the C–H/C = C ratio has a greater contribution to Ea, indicating that the aliphatic C–H functional group has an important effect on the oxidation activity of the particles. Al-Qurashi K et al. [39] found that the particle with abundant active sites (such as C–H functional groups) exhibits high oxidation reactivity. In addition, Alfè et al. [65] believed that a combination of the relative amount of active C–H sites and the particle nanostructure affects the oxidation reactivity of particles."
11,Conclusions,"This paper focuses on the particle emissions from commercial engines when burning pure diesel, methanol/diesel blends (M10), n-butanol/diesel blends (NB25), and n-octanol/diesel blends (NO45). The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to systematically study the graphitization degree, C–H functional groups, O/C ratio and C atom hybridization of particles. Moreover, the contribution of the microscopic physicochemical properties to the oxidation activity of the particles was analyzed by PLS. The main conclusions are as follows: As the load increases, the D1-FWHM of the particles decreases, which means that the chemical heterogeneity of the particles decreases. The addition of alcohol fuel in diesel will reduce D1-FWHM. However, the D1-FWHM continues to decrease with the use of low- to high-carbon chain alcohols under high load, while under low load, the D1-FWHM of NB25 particles is the largest. As the load increases, the AD1/AG of the particles decreases, which means that the graphitization degree of the particles increases. The addition of alcohol fuel will increase the graphitization degree of the particles. However, under low load, the order of AD1/AG of particles is: D100 > NB25 > NO45 > M10, while under high load, the order of AD1/AG of particles is: D100 > M10 > NB25 > NO45. The content of aliphatic C–H functional groups on the surface of the particles is the result of the combined effect of production and consumption. For D100 particle and NO45 particle, the consumption effect is dominant. For M10 particle and NB25 particle, the generation effect is dominant. The addition of alcohol will reduce the content of aliphatic C–H functional groups. However, as the use of low- to high-carbon chain alcohols, the content of aliphatic C–H functional groups continues to increase. As the load increases, the O/C ratio decreases. Compared with pure diesel, adding alcohol fuel to diesel fuel will reduce the O/C ratio. With the use of low- to high-carbon chain alcohols, the O/C ratio first decreases and then increases, and the O/C ratio of NB25 particle is the smallest. As the load increases, the sp3/sp2 ratio of D100 particle, NB25 particle and NO45 particle decreases, while the sp3/sp2 ratio of M10 particle increases. Under different loads, the sp3/sp2 ratio of different fuel particles are consistent with the changing trend of AD1/AG. Through the PLS analysis, the fringe separation distance and fringe length have the greatest influence on the activation energy of particles. Among the characteristic parameters of Raman spectroscopy, the D1-FWHM contributes the most to activation energy. The oxidation activity is less sensitive to the O/C ratio and the sp3/sp2 ratio. In future research, the physicochemical properties of more fuel particles should be investigated, for example, alcohols with longer carbon chain lengths (n-pentanol, n-Hexanol, n-octanol) and butanol isomers."
