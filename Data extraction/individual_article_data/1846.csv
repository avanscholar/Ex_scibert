0,Introduction,"As the world’s fossil fuel reserves continue to decrease, energy researchers resolutely investigate more sustainable energy resources. The unavoidable decrease in fossil fuel reserves will continue as the world’s population grows by 0.9% per year from 7.3 billion in 2014 to 9.2 billion in 2040. This population growth will be attended by increase in global energy consumption by nearly 29% in 2040. Its concomitant CO2 emission will also increase from 32 to 37 giga tonnes [1]. Air transportation energy increased by 5% (24,856–26,030 trillion Btu) in USA from 2009 to 2019 [2]. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts approximately 38% increase (1.25–1.73 million barrels/day) oil consumption between 2019 and 2050 [3]. Furthermore, global airlines’ fuel consumption has been predicted to reach 97 billion gallons (367 billion liters) in 2019 with 1032 million tonnes of CO2 emission [4]. Considering the fuel consumption and its potential environmental footprint, there is a need for alternative, sustainable liquid fuel resources. Prominent among these energy resources are microalgae that are promising biomass resources and high photosynthetic efficiency and fast growth rate [5]. Not only do microalgae possess growth advantage but they also eliminate food-fuel competition and farmland occupation. Besides, they enhance fertilizer recycle, such as struvite (NH4MgPO4) [6], and acts as CO2 sink, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emission [7–15]. Apart from their agrarian advantages, microalgae are endowed with bio-based resources, namely polysaccharides, proteins, and oil. The latter, which is of lower percentage, has enormous level of triglycerides, which has been used to produce jet-diesel-fuel-range hydrocarbons [16–18]. Microalgae oil has longer carbon chain than that of vegetable oil, and can produce the carbon number (C8-C16) in jet fuel [19]. A statistical summary of lipid contents in 19 different species of microalgae is presented in Table 1 . Considering the moderate level of lipid contents of microalgae, few processes in the literature have highlighted the conversion of microalgae to jet fuel. Chiefly among them are thermal and hydrocracking (time consuming); pyrolysis (uncontrollable, high level of N & O); Fischer Tropsch (costly and energy-intensive); transesterification (costly); enzymatic process (costly and immature); Centia™ process (costly); plasma gasification (costly and immature) [18]. To offset the problems associated with the preceding processes, there is a need to concentrate the oil in the microalgae to ensure sustainability. One of the most famous ways of concentrating oil is via hydrothermal liquefaction with or without a catalyst at high pressures to produce biocrude that comprises high levels of nitrogen and oxygen [20]. The presence of significant levels of oxygen and nitrogen in the biocrude oil does not favor catalytic hydrogenation as excessive hydrogen is required, making the process cost-ineffective. Besides, the presence of nitrogen could lead to unwanted nitrogenous compounds, such as amides, in the jet fuel, leading low heating value of the resulting fuel [21]. Furthermore, biocrude oil possesses remarkable viscosity (high pumping cost), low pH (3.5–4.2, corrosive), and high water content that requires extra energy for evaporation [22]. Considering the problems associated with the concentrated algae oil described above, flash hydrolysis (FH) was used to concentrate the lipids content (~10 wt%) of Chlorella Vulgaris [23]. FH, a chemical-free and subcritical water-based process that fractionates the components of the algae, thereby increasing the lipid content to nearly 52 wt% (Fig. 1 ) [24]. The main objective of FH was to extract the bioactive components (proteins) from the microalgae resulting in biofuel intermediate (BI), having limited benefit, that has not been explored to produce jet fuel. The use of BI as raw material for hydrocarbon production has the potential of cost reduction concerning raw material handling compared to using raw microalgae as the raw material. In this study, the oil-laden BI served as a raw material for catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction over NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite [25] catalyst using 2-propanol as an in-situ hydrogen donor. CTH is a reduction of unsaturated organics (such as oleic acid) using hydrogen-donating compounds that catalytically produce hydrogen in situ. CTH is advantageous over hydrogenation using gaseous hydrogen, as CTH reduces the high cost of transporting and storing large volumes of gaseous hydrogen in the conventional process of hydrogenation. Whereas CTH requires oil-to-2-propanol ratio of approximately 1.57 mL/mL, conventional hydrogenation uses H2-to-oil ratio of 200–300 mL/mL [25]. Selection of 2-propanol as hydrogen donor and oil extract is due its non-toxicity and its potential renewability [26–28]. Employing 2-propanol for CTH of algae oil enhances mass transfer and diffusion of reacting species as 2-propanol is polar and significantly miscible with algae oil. Contrariwise, the use of gaseous hydrogen is constrained by mass transfer and diffusion of reacting species except at high pressures greater than 100 bar [29,30]. Effective CTH reaction is underpinned by stable and commercially available catalyst. In this study, a trimetallic catalyst was employed to enhance the cracking of the long-chain algae oil. NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite has excellent features and it is commonly used in the petroleum refinery industry. Literature has shown that mono-metallic catalyst, such as nickel, has lower activity towards direct scission of CO and C–O bonds due to its low electrophilicity, but has high C–C bond scission [31]. Adding more electrophilic molybdenum to nickel improves the cleavage of both CO and C–O bonds. Mono/bimetallic sulfide catalysts (e.g. Mo2C, MoS2, Ni-Mo-S, and Co-Mo-S) are biased towards hydrodeoxygenation, and unable to cleave C–C bonds because sulfided catalysts lack acid site, and deactivate in the presence of water [32]. Additionally, sulfided catalysts require constant replacement of sulfur by adding sulfiding agents such as H2S and CS2, which in turn produce H2S emission and produce fuel replete with sulfur [33]. Comprehensive studies have been done on the use of noble metals catalysts (Noble metals (Palladium (Pd), Platinum (Pt), Rhodium (Rd), Ruthenium (Ru), etc.) supported on alumina, activated carbon and zeolite. Despite their catalytic effectiveness, they are expensive and short-lived [34–39]. Surfactant-mediated mesoporous catalysts, such as SBA-1, HMS, and SBA-15 with high surface area, large pore structure, and well-ordered morphology, have been used to hydrotreat vegetable oil. However, they possess weak hydrothermal and mechanical stability, and reduced acidity, leading to retardation of their practical application [40,41]. Silcoaluminophosphate (SAPO-5, SAPO-11, SAPO-31, et cetera) is one of the surfactant-mediated catalysts that have been employed in hydrotreating triglycerides [42–46]. Though SAPO has both micro-mesoporous with large surface area, it is biased towards isomerization of short chain hydrocarbons [47–49]. They also have low hydrothermal stability during hydrogenation of triglycerides due the production of water as by-product [50]. This instability could be reduced by adding more surfactant, which consequently renders the catalyst expensive [51]. As a result of the problems associated with the preceding catalysts, we use NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalyst, which has been tried and tested by commercial refineries around the globe. Few of these companies that have tailored the trimetallic catalyst to process triglycerides are ConocoPhillips (United States, Ireland), Universal Oil Products (UOP)-Eni (UK, Italy), Nippon Oil (Japan), SK Energy (Korea), and Syntroleum (United States) [39]. Not only is NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalyst commercially available, but it is also resistant to coking compared to mon-bimetallic catalysts. It is reported that the coke resistance of catalysts ranks in the order of mono-metallic < bimetallic < trimetallic [52]. It is worth selecting zeolite as the support in this work because it is environmentally benign, recyclable, porous, acidic, and resistant to attrition [53]. There has not been exhaustive report on CTH of oil-laden BI from flashed hydrolyzed microalgae. In this study, oil-laden BI, characterized by pyro-GCMS, was employed as the raw material to produce jet-fuel range hydrocarbon. We used 2-propanol to extract the oil via design of experiment to obtain the maximum oil yield. Without evaporation of 2-propanol, the mixture was subjected to CTH over the prepared catalyst in a batch reactor to produce iso-alkane, the major jet fuel components. Thus, 2-propanol used as both oil extract and in-situ hydrogen donor for the conversion of BI via CTH reaction over NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalyst was first reported."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium-aluminosilicate pellets (-600 mesh), 2-propanol (99.5 wt%) and dichloromethane, nickel nitrate (II) hexahydrate (99.9%), Cobalt (II) molybdenum oxide hydrate (99% metal basis), and diethyl ether were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Refrigerated BI was obtained from our last work on Chlorella Vulgaris [23] ."
3,BI characterization,"2.2 BI characterization The purpose of characterization of BI was to ascertain the chemical composition via ultimate analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), pyro-GCMS, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was also necessary to determine the latent energy of the BI by determining the rate of thermal decomposition by TGA and pyro-GCMS. These techniques assisted in evaluating the heating value and the gaseous components of the pyrolysis products. The heating value obtained from this section would serve as a baseline for the heating value of the liquid product from the CTH reaction. 2.2.1 Thermal analysis of BI This step was aimed at determining the rate of thermal decomposition of BI, and consequently ascertaining the average boiling point range of oil content that served as a guide for selecting the reaction temperature for the CTH. From the kinetics of the thermal decomposition BI, it was easy to postulate the CTH reaction order as the catalyst was expected to lower the order of reaction. To study the thermal performance of the BI, TGA and differential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed in a nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 30 mL/min with heating rate of 5–30 °C/min. Within this atmosphere, approximately 5 mg of BI was placed in a platinum cup and was heated to 900 °C [1]. From the DTA plots, the temperature at which the maximum thermal decomposition rate occurred served as a guide in choosing the CTH reaction temperature range, and from the kinetics of thermal decomposition of BI, the order of thermal decomposition and activation energy were obtained. 2.2.2 FTIR analysis of BI The purpose of the FTIR analysis was to determine the major components in the BI (oil, carbohydrate, and protein) by identifying the common functional groups. The FTIR spectra of the BI were recorded at room temperature and a wavenumber range of 480–4000 cm−1 by diffuse reflectance using a ThermoNicolet Avatar 370 DTGS spectrometer. Each spectrum resulted from 128 scans to achieve optimal signal-to-noise ratio. 2.2.3 Pyro-GCMS analysis To determine the nature of gaseous products (that could not be analyzed by the TGA facility) obtained from the thermal decomposition of the BI, a pyro-GCMS (a pyrolysis unit connected to GCMS) was used to track and analyze the gaseous compounds. Fig. 2 depicts the experimental set-up for the pyro-GCMS. 3 ± 0.03 mg of BI sample was loaded into a platinum crucible. The crucible and its contents were placed in a 4 × 150 mm pyrolysis tube. To ensure inert condition in the pyrolysis unit, gaseous nitrogen with a flow rate of 20 mL/min was maintained. The crucible and its contents were lowered down to the pyrolysis zone by a single shot mechanism. The BI was pyrolyzed at a temperature range of 400–850 °C, and the gaseous products were analyzed by the GCMS. It was assumed that the concentration of the chemical species was proportional to the percent area of the peak."
4,CTH of algae oil,"2.3 CTH of algae oil In this section, using 2-propanol as an extract, the optimum oil-extraction condition was established via design of experiment. The oil obtained at the optimum condition was characterized, and without evaporation of the propanol, the oil-2-propanol mixture was subjected to CTH over NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalyst. The catalyst (fresh and used) for the CTH was characterized; the reaction rate equation was postulated; the activation energy and the order of reaction were estimated. 2.3.1 Optimization of oil extraction To convert the oil-laden to jet fuel, the oil was extracted by 2-propanol using design of experiment. Three factors were considered: temperature, BI-2-propanol ratio, and time of extraction. Table 2 highlights the factors considered in the 3-factor and 3-level factorial design of experiment. Using fractional factorial technique, 16 different experiments were conducted. To accomplish this, a given BI-2-propanol ratio was measured and placed in a test tube. The content was thoroughly mixed with vortex mixer and placed in a water bath with a set temperature. The content was agitated intermittently with the vortex mixer. The pregnant 2-propanol was separated from the barren BI via centrifugation and decantation. The yield of the oil was calculated for each experiment as shown in Eq. (1). (1) Yield = Total m a s s o f o i l Mass o f B I × 100 % Based on D-optimal design, a polynomial model was proposed (Eq. (2)) and by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with experimental data, the coefficients, β’s, were evaluated. (2) Y = β 0 + β 1 A + β 2 B + β 3 C + β 4 AB + β 5 AC + β 6 BC + β 7 ABC + β 8 A 2 + β 9 B 2 + β 10 C 2 The optimum values for the independent factors (Temperature (A), BI-2-propanol ratio (B), and time (C) were determined by both analytical and 3-dimensional surface response plots. Analytically, the partial derivative of Eq. (2) and applying MS-Excel solver facility were employed. The optimum values were validated by running oil extraction experiment at these optimum values and the percent oil yield was calculated. The barren BI obtained at the optimum run was analyzed by FTIR whereas the pregnant 2-propanol was subject to CTH. 2.3.2 Catalyst preparation Fig. 3 highlights the processes involved in the preparation of the catalyst. NiOx-MoOx-CoOx-zeolite was prepared by wet-impregnating the zeolite (support) with Ni (2.7 wt%)-Co (1.2 wt%)-Mo (2 wt%) precursors (nickel nitrate (II) hexahydrate and cobalt (II) molybdenum oxide hydrate). In this process, 1.9 g of CoMoO4·H2O (5 wt% of support) was dissolved in 1000 mL of deionized water at 80 °C. A given amount of the support (sodium aluminosilicate) was added to the prepared solution and the content was stirred overnight. The loaded zeolite was removed from solution and was dried in an oven at 105 °C. A solution of nickel nitrate (II) hexahydrate was prepared by dissolving 5.16 g of it in 1000 mL of deionized water at 80 °C. The dried catalyst was added to the nickel solution and stirred overnight under a hood. The loaded catalyst was then separated from solution and was dried. The dried catalyst was calcined in a furnace at 500 °C for 2 h. 2.3.3 Catalyst characterization The aim of this section was to assess the stability of the catalyst by determining the surface area, the crystallinity, the chemical position of the fresh and the used catalysts and ascertaining the level of coke formation. Both the fresh and used catalyst were characterized by BET, XRD, SEM, EDS, FTIR, TGA-DTA. The XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Diffractograms were recorded from 5°-80° (2 θ values in discrete mode with a step of 0.1°). The morphologies of the catalysts were analyzed with SEM using Hitachi S‐3400N operated with beam energy of 15 kV. Imbedded in the SEM was EDS, which was used to determine the elemental composition of the catalysts. The FTIR spectra of the catalysts (fresh and used) were recorded at room temperature and wavenumber range of 480–4000 cm−1 by diffuse reflectance using a ThermoNicolet Avatar 370 DTGS spectrometer. The BET surface area, the pore volume, and the pore size of the new and used catalysts were measured by using Quantachrome NOVA 200e surface area analyzer after degassing the catalyst at 300 °C for 3 h and adsorbing and desorbing it with N2 at −196 °C. The surface area was evaluated using multi-point BET model. The pore size distribution was obtained from the desorption isotherm using Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model while the total pore volume was calculated at relative pressure range of 0.0–1.0. The amount of coke formation on the surface of the catalyst was determined using TGA-DTA by measuring the percent mass loss and the rate of thermal decomposition of the catalyst. 2.3.4 CTH of extracted oil After establishing the optimum oil yield from the BI, the oil-2-propanol mixture (0.08 g/0.8 g) was placed in a 30-mL batch reactor (Fig. 4 ). 1.0 g of of NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalyst was added to the reactor. The reactor was placed in a sand-bath furnace and the reaction was carried out at 390, 405, and 420 °C with the respective autogenic pressures of 24.8, 26.0, and 27 bar. The reaction was stopped and allowed to cool, and thereafter, the liquid product was separated from the catalyst and analyzed with GCMS. The amount of water produced due to hydrodeoxygenation was separated by gravity. In all, 15 runs of experiments were conducted with different reaction times as shown in Table 3 . With the results from the GCMS, the algae oil conversion x (%) was calculated as Eq. (3). It was assumed that the fatty acids obtained in the GCMS results represented the unreacted algae oil. It was also assumed that the concentration of the chemical species was proportional to the percent area of the peak. (3) Conversion = [ ( I n i t i a l m a s s o f o i l ) - ( u n r e a c t e d m a s s o f o i l ) ] × 100 % Initial m a s s o f o i l"
5,Results and discussions,
6,Characterization of BI,"3.1 Characterization of BI Fig. 5 highlights the results for the mass-loss profile for the oil-laden BI when subjected to TGA analysis. It was evident that the thermal decomposition of the oil-laden BI had three different stages. The first stage showed a weight loss of 6% at 160 °C, signifying the presence of bonded water molecules during the flash hydrolysis. This loss could also be attributed to light organic compounds present in the BI [54]. The second stage occurred between 160 and 440 °C where the organic components (carbohydrate, protein and lipids) decomposed. Since the BI contains mainly oil, most of the weight loss (73%) at this stage could be traceable to the oil. The third stage of the weight loss occurred beyond 440 °C that could be carbonaceous residue, which decompose slowly giving total weight loss of approximately 10%. Evidently, varying the heating rate (5–30 °C/min) did not affect the mass loss significantly. The total mass loss at 5 °C/min was nearly 85% whereas that at 30 °C/min was 89%. These results could also mean the total volatile organic compounds in the BI amounted to 83% with roughly 10% being inorganic residue (ash content). The difference in mass loss could be due to more energy that was added at the latter condition than at the start the process. It could be observed from Fig. 6 that increasing the heating rate increased the maximum rate of thermal decomposition from 0.002 to 0.01 mg/min. Besides, the rate of BI thermal decomposition peaked at 250 °C and 400 °C that could represent the boiling points of the oil in the BI. With this temperature profile obtained, the CTH reaction temperature was selected. Since there was no apparent CTH reaction below 390 °C from the experimental runs, it could be inferred that the average boiling point of the algae oil was 400 °C."
7,FTIR analysis of BI,"3.2 FTIR analysis of BI Fig. 7 highlighted the FTIR profile for both oil-laden and depleted BI. FTIR spectra were recorded for oil-laden and depleted BI in a frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1. The spectra at 3301 cm−1 represented O–H stretching vibration of hydroxyl or carbonyl group or polysaccharides or phenolic compounds. There was insignificant change in the peak at 3301 cm−1 after the oil extraction, meaning that the carbohydrate group were not soluble in 2-propanol. Peaks at 2857 cm−1 and 2922 cm−1 represented asymmetrical and symmetrical C–H stretching vibrations of aliphatic methylene group, such as those in alkanes or fatty acids. The depleted BI signal indicated that most of these groups vanished by dissolving in the 2-propanol. The peak registered at 1740 cm−1 depicted CO group stretching of acids and esters, which totally vanished after the oil extraction. At a frequency of 1635 cm−1, there existed CC ring stretching, signifying the presence of aromatics and conjugated system. At this same frequency, there existed COO– antisymmetric stretching that announced the presence of carboxylate ions [55]. The intensity at 1542 cm−1 represented amides (N–H and C–N) deformation vibration from protein [56], which remained insoluble in the 2-propanol. It could also be inferred that the flash hydrolysis was not able to remove all the proteins from the algae. 1462 cm−1 showed the CH2 scissoring that announced the presence of lipids, which vanished after the oil extraction. Also, 1377 cm−1 showed symmetric bending of the -C–H (CH3) that emanated from lipids. Spectra at 1155 cm−1 and 1026 cm−1 highlighted C–O–C (glycosidic ether) stretching of ring and –C–O stretching, respectively. These spectra showed the presence of cellulose or polysaccharides [57], which was insoluble in 2-propanol. Finally, spectra in the range of 600–800 cm−1 portrayed C–H bending vibration of aromatics, which showed slight solubility in 2-propanol. It could be concluded that the fresh BI was made of lipids, polysaccharides, and insignificant protein."
8,Pyro-GCMS analysis,"3.3 Pyro-GCMS analysis Fig. 8 highlighted the gaseous components from BI pyrolysis. At 400–550 °C, it could be inferred that the percent lipid in the BI was approximately 62% as there was no degradation of triglyceride at that temperature (Fig. 6). The components of the BI started degrading chemically at 650 °C where the percent of fatty acid dropped by 10%. As the temperature increased, dehydration of long-chain hydrocarbon resulted and gave rise to alkenes. Other components such as aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, amides, and aromatics increased with increasing temperature (Fig. S1). As dehydration increased at high temperatures, O–C ratio dropped, giving rise to high heating value of the gaseous product (Fig. 9 ). The heating values of the gaseous products were estimated based on the percent of individual compounds obtained from the GCMS analysis. The calculated calorific value was higher than that obtained from the raw BI (33.8 MJ/kg) [23]. It was observed that H-C ratio remained unchanged though there were some losses of hydrogen via dehydration. It could be concluded that the BI could render huge calorific value (~48 MJ/kg) if upgraded by pyrolysis or any other means"
9,Kinetics of pyrolysis of BI,"3.4 Kinetics of pyrolysis of BI To determine the activation energy of the thermal decomposition of BI, two isothermal equations were employed: the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) as shown in the supporting information (Eqs. (S1)–(S3)) [58]. Given the heating rate ( β ) , fractional conversion, and temperature of decomposition of BI, plots of ln ( β ) and l n ( β / T 2 ) against ( 1 / T ) produced straight lines with R-squared values ranging from 0.94 to 0.99, which explained the goodness of fit (Figs. S2 and S3) of these two equations (Eqs. (S1) and (S2)). Increasing the fractional conversion increased the activation energy (Tables S1, S2, & Fig. 10 ). Since the lower boiling-point components in the BI were decomposed first, less energy was required compared to high boiling-point components, which required higher energy to decompose. Hence, the activation energy increased from 115 to 298 kJ/mol with increasing fractional conversion from 0.2 to 0.7. Thus, the average activation energy for thermal decomposition based on FWO and KAS equations were 220 kJ/mol and 223 kJ/mol, respectively. These values could be compared to what was reported in the literature (298–301 kJ/mol) [58]. The lower values in the current study could be attributed to the removal of proteins via flash hydrolysis whereas the one in the literature was fresh algae with all the three main components (lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) present. Summarily, this characterization step has revealed the dimension of energy required to convert the BI into high quality fuel product."
10,Optimization of oil extraction,"3.5 Optimization of oil extraction Results from the optimal design of oil extraction were shown in Table 4 , which highlighted the process variables (temperature (A), BI-2-propanol ratio (B), and time (C)) and the experimental and calculated percent oil yields. The values in Table 4 were employed in determining the coefficients in Eq. (2) and the interactions among the process variables. After testing other polynomials, Eq. (4) highlighted the final and appropriate equation obtained by multiple regression using the MATLAB software. (4) y = - 71.2 + 3.94 A + 16.8 B + 0.668 C + 0.556 AB + 0.002 AC - 0.073 BC - 0.0047 ABC - 0.042 A 2 - 49 B 2 - 0.0036 C 2 ANOVA was used to assess the goodness of fit (Table 5 ) for the polynomial using the experimental data. The goodness of fit for the regression model was determined by the R-squared value (0.995) and R2-adjusted value (0.993). R-squared was used to judge the adequacy of the model by measuring the variability in the data. In this case, the chosen model accounted for the 99.5% of the variability in the experimental data. R-squared statistic proved somewhat problematic or deceptive as a measure of the quality of fit for multiple regression since it never decreased when a variable was added to the model. To alleviate such a problem, R2-adjusted (0.993) was employed as a perfect criterion for assessing the quality of fit as it only increased when the added variable reduced the error mean squared. The interaction of process variables and their effects on the model were determined by using the p-values. Coefficients with p-value less than 0.05 (significant level) were considered significant. Essentially, all the process variables had significant effects on the yield of oil as their p-values were less than 5% [59]. It was also evident that the degree of these effects varied with variable p-values. For example, the effect of A (temperature) on the model was higher than that of B since the p-value of A was lower than that of B (2-propanol). AB had stronger effect on the process than did AC since the p-value of AB (temperature-BI-2-propanol ratio) was lower than that of AC (temperature-time). Similarly, the p-values for the coefficients of C, A2, B2, and C2 were less than 0.05, meaning that all the three variables contributed significantly to the model. The average p-value was 5.52 × 10−6, which signified the goodness of the model. 3.5.1 Model validation The reliability of the model used in this experiment was proved by validation, whereby data outliers in the residuals were examined and removed. The assumption that the residuals were normally distributed was verified. The residuals were plotted against the fitted values and investigated any pattern and unpattern (random) distribution. Fig. 11 shows unpattern distribution of residuals, signifying an absence of outliers in the data. Moreover, the probability plot highlighted how normally distributed as the points lied close to the straight line. 3.5.2 Effects of process variables The effects of all the three variables were examined via response surface and contour plots. Noticeably, increasing the temperature increased the yield of oil extraction as the oil became increasingly soluble in the 2-propanol. Beyond ~50 °C, the oil yield began to drop due the evaporation of 2-propanol into empty space. BI-2-propanol ratio increased with decreasing oil yield as the required amount of 2-propanol dipped thereby limiting the solubility of the oil. The maximum oil yield was obtained at BI-2-propanol ratio of 0.133 g/g (Fig. 12 (1–1 & 1–2)). Increasing the time allowed significant amount of oil to transfer from the fibrous zone into the 2-propanol. Obviously, at infinite time, the oil yield remained unchanged, signifying that at 1.68 h, the oil extraction process had stopped (Fig. 12 (2–1 & 2–2) with the maximum oil yield of 62%."
11,Catalyst characterization,"3.6 Catalyst characterization 3.6.1 TGa Fig. 13 shows TGA profiles for both the fresh and the used catalysts that depicted three stages of weight losses. The first stage (below 200 °C) showed approximately 6%, and 3% weight loss for both fresh and the used catalysts, respectively. These losses could be ascribed to the loss of loosely bonded water. Fresh catalyst showed the highest weight loss probably due to the adsorption of water employed in the wet impregnation. Ironically, the used catalyst showed the lowest weight loss in the first stage probably due to the displacement of water molecules by the fuel products that diffused to displace the water molecules in the zeolite structure during the CTH reaction. From 200 to 400 °C, approximately 6% and 13.3% weight loss for the fresh and used catalysts, respectively were experienced. These weight losses could be linked to strongly bonded water, which resided in the first coordination sphere and could not be removed under mild thermal treatment. The next weight loss (3% for both fresh catalyst, and 2% for used catalyst) occurred between 400 and 900 °C. This loss could be attributed to structural hydroxyl group that condensed and dehydrated at 500 °C and above. Evidently, there was 4% weight loss difference between the used and fresh catalyst within last stage of the TGA (400–900 °C). This weight loss difference was attributable to the coke formed from carbonized hydrocarbon or poly-alkyl aromatic hydrocarbon that were precursors of catalyst deactivation [60,61]. The FTIR and EDS analyses (Figs. 16 and 14 ) confirmed the presence of this carbonized components on the used catalyst. Conclusively, the overall weight loss from the used catalyst after TGA was estimated to be 4% compared to what was reported in literature. Comparatively, TGA of coke-laden NiO-CaO5/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst showed weight loss of 15% [62] while 20Ni-6Cu-5Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited weight loss of 22–25% [63], and NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite showed weight loss of 19% [25]. 3.6.2 SEM and EDS Fig. 14 highlighted the spectrum obtained from the analysis of elemental composition of the fresh and used NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalysts. The analysis revealed the following elements common in zeolites: carbon, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, and iron. These nine elements in the raw zeolite announced the possible presence of the oxides (Na2O, K2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, FeO, Fe2O3) [64]. The presence of cobalt, nickel, and molybdenum highlighted the results of doping the zeolite that was filled with NiO, CoxOy, and MoxOy, respectively. Due to the calcination of the doped zeolite, the oxides of the active metals were prominent as reduction of the catalyst was not performed. These oxides were preferable to their reduced form because they offered higher level of acidity than their metal counterparts as reported in the literature. Also, these oxides introduced metal-support interaction for activation of oxygen-containing compounds, and improved direct cleavage of C-O in oil [65]. Moreover, without the reduction of the catalyst, the cost of catalyst preparation could reduce. The presence of sodium and calcium predicted the zeolite to be A-type [66] with cubic crystal structure [67] as could be observed in the SEM results. The analysis showed that the raw zeolite was weakly acidic since Si/Al = 1.42 < 1.5 [68]. It was also observed that the level of acidity remained unchanged after the zeolite was impregnated with the active metals. Maintaining the Si/Al < 5 rendered the zeolite hydrophobic, porous, alkaline and more adsorbent [69]. The percent compositions of the active metals (Ni, Co, and Mo) dropped by 15%, 31%, and 34%, respectively after the catalyst was used one cycle (3 h of reaction). The high reduction of cobalt and molybdenum might be attributed to weak interaction with the zeolite during the impregnation that enhanced the leaching of the metals during the CTH reaction. It could be traceable to the rise in the carbon content to 12.4%, which could occlude the active metals during the CTH reaction. 3.6.3 X-ray diffraction Fig. 15 highlighted the X-ray diffraction patterns observed for the zeolite and the fresh and used Ni-Co-Mo-zeolite catalysts with significant characteristic peaks observed at 7.4°, 10.7°, 12.6°, 16.6°, 17.8°, 21.9°, 24.4°, 27.6°, and 30.4° for zeolite according to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS File no. 43-0142) [25]. These results were in consonance with what were in the literature [70,71]. Apparently, the zeolite had high crystallinity prior to doping it with the metal precursors. Its crystallinity significantly decreased due to the interaction between the Si-O and Ni, Co, and Mo at 2 θ = 7.8°, 12.6°, 24.4°, 27.6°, and 53°. The peaks at these angles could be traceable to oxides of molybdenum in the following crystallographic directions, namely MoO3 [1 0 0], MoO3 [0 0 1], MoO3 [1 0 0], MoO3 [0 2 1], and MoO2 [3 1 1], respectively [72–78]. Further interaction from oxides of cobalt (CoxOy) found at 16.6°, 21.9°, and 41.9° decreased the crystallinity of the zeolite [79]. Oxides of nickel (Ni2O3 [0 0 2], NiO [2 2 2], NiO [1 1 1]) at 30.4°, 34.7°, and 44.5°, respectively contributed to the lowering of crystallinity of the zeolite [78,80,81]. It could be observed that the stability of the catalyst was affected in this work compared to that in the past work [25]. The intensity dropped in this work probably because of significant presence of ringed compounds (forerunners of coke formation) observed in the products. 3.6.4 FTIR analysis Fig. 16 highlighted the FTIR profile for zeolite (support) and the fresh and used NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalyst that was recorded in a frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1. The spectrum for the zeolite exhibited frequencies of 460, 540, 668, 972, 1650, and 3340 cm−1. The peak at 460 cm−1 could be linked to bending vibration of T-O-T (T = Al, Si groups) in the zeolite structure [82,83]. This band also depicted the bending vibration of internal tetrahedron TO4 of the zeolite structure [84], which showed the presence of Al+3 and Si4+ in the zeolite. The bands around 540, 668, and 752 cm−1 could be ascribed to internal and external linkage symmetrical stretching vibrations. The band at 972 cm−1 highlighted the symmetrical stretching vibration and tetrahedron vibration of Si-O bond [84]. The peak at 1650 cm−1 could be attributed to bending vibration of O–H in the adsorbed water (H2O) on the zeolite surface [66]. 3340 cm−1 could be ascribed to Si-OH in nest defects and hydrogen bonding of loosely held water molecules [85]. Conspicuously, the metal-doped zeolite (fresh catalyst) exhibited the lowest intensity (absorbance) and slight shift in frequencies due to Co3+, Ni2+, and Mo6+ interactions with O–H, Si-O, and Al-O bond during the doping process. Spectra at 2003, 2126, and 2355 cm−1 could be attributed to the interaction between Ni-Co-Mo ions and TO4 in the zeolite during the doping process. Conversely, the used catalyst did not exhibit peaks at 2003, 2126, and 2355 cm−1 due to deactivation. It was observed that the peak at wavenumber 1650 cm−1 disappeared after metal doping and calcination. This indicated the thoroughness of the calcination that removed the water molecules, which could promote agglomeration and consequent deactivation [66]. In contrast, the used catalyst showed a peak at 1650 cm−1 indicating the presence of water molecules that caused the catalyst deactivation during the CTH reaction. The appearance of the frequency 3673 cm−1 evidenced the stretching modes of CHx, which was formed during the CTH reaction [86]. 3.6.5 Surface area analysis Fig. 17 showed the performance of the NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite via adsorption and desorption isotherm and the application of BET method. The catalyst surface area was reduced from 250 m2/g to 150 m2/g after 3 h of CTH reaction. The reduction in the surface area was traceable to coke formation that could be corroborated by the increased in carbon (4.4–14.5 wt%) content in the EDS analysis (Fig. 14). While the pore volume changed from 0.164 cm3/g to 0.032 cm3/g, the pore width increased from 19.6 Å to 86 Å. The surface coke formation caused this increase in the pore width of the catalyst due to reduction in effective surface area, and consequently increased the average pore radius or diameter. The shapes of the hysteresis loop for both used and spent catalysts appeared parallel, which meant that there was not much change in the texture, pore size distribution, and pore geometry. Evidently, at a relative pressure of 0.44, the loop closed at a point where pore condensation and evaporation of N2 occurred. This shape depicted adsorption and desorption isotherm of type 1 and 4 according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry [87]. These values showed how the stability of the catalyst was shaken during the CTH."
12,CTH of algae oil,"3.7 CTH of algae oil Fig. 18 showed the CTH conversion of algae oil conducted at different temperatures (390, 405, 420 °C). It was observed that 100% conversion was achieved at all reaction temperatures. At a temperature of 390 °C, the conversion of the oil increased as the time of reaction increased from 1 to 5 h, the percent conversion increased respectively as 50, 86, 90, 99, and 100%. Most of the hydrocarbon produced at 390 °C were cyclo-and iso-alkanes at 3–5 h (Tables S5–S7) while the products at 1–2 h produced both hydrocarbons and oxygenates (Tables S3 and S4). It was observed that reaction at 390 °C produced branched-chain (41%) and cyclo-alkanes (35%). These cyclo-alkanes underwent dehydration and formed polyaromatics, which are not environmentally friendly during combustion. The percent iso-cyclo alkanes produced were extraordinarily higher than what was reported in the literature [1,25]. As the temperature increased, the conversion increased rapidly, but the products obtained were mostly polyaromatics that caused catalyst deactivation (Fig. S5). It was observed that the percent coke formed at 390, 405, and 420 °C were 4, 15, and 25%, respectively. It was observed in one hour of the CTH reaction at 390 °C that most of the products were nitrogenous in nature (e.g. 1-Phenazinecarboxylic acid) due to the presence of little proteins left in the BI after the flash hydrolysis. As time progressed, the nitrogen vanished probably by converting to gaseous NH3 as the ring structure opened. It was also evident that the oxygenates disappeared via deoxygenation or hydrodeoxygenation, which gave the fuel a significant calorific value. For example, the heating value increased from 35 to 48 MJ/kg as the reaction progressed (Table 6 ). It was observed that the maximum heating value was obtained in 3 h of reaction due to the production of more branched alkanes, and this value could be compared to that observed at the pyrolysis of the BI. Fig. 19 highlights the number of carbon distribution in the liquid products as CTH was conducted at the temperature range of 390–420 °C and at autogenic pressure of 24–27 bar. Most of the carbon were in the range of C6-C9, which depicted typical jet-fuel composition [88] The C3-C8 highlighted the production of cyclo-alkanes and branched hydrocarbons, such as isomers of heptane and hexane (Tables S3–S7). The liquid fuel obtained from the CTH reaction contained carbon atom range of C3-C18 with most of the hydrocarbons within C5-C8. As the reaction proceeded from 1 to 5 h at 390 °C, the percent carbon atoms within C5-C8 increased from 7 to 94%. Since the compounds in the liquid fuel were saturated hydrocarbon, the CTH underwent either deoxygenation, catalytic cracking, or thermal cracking. Moreover, the presence of water in the liquid products signified the hydrodeoxygenation reaction, whereby the oxygen content of the oil reacted with the hydrogen produced by the 2-propanol [89]. Summarily, the optimum process parameters for the CTH of the microalgae oil were temperature (390 °C), pressure (24 bar), reaction time of 3 h, and algae oil to 2-propanol ratio (0.08 g/g), It could be estimated that 2-propanol to oil ratio was 12.2 L 2-propanol per liter algae oil compared to using gaseous H2 as hydrogen donor as found in literature (200–300 L H2/liter oil) [25]. 3.7.1 CTH kinetic model Based on percent conversion, the kinetic parameters (reaction order, activation energy, and pre-exponential factor) were estimated. Reaction at 390–420 °C were considered to develop the kinetics of CTH of algae oil with the following elementary assumptions: (i) isothermal and steady-state conditions are assumed; (ii) for the sake of simplicity, all the products were lamped into one product; (iii) the rate of coke and gaseous products formation were not considered as the amounts produced were. considered insignificant compared to that of the liquid. products; (iv) intraparticle mass-transfer resistance was assumed to be negligible since diffusion was very fast, such that the overall rate was not affected by mass transfer in any fashion; and [90] the rates of adsorption and desorption of products and reactants were not considered. The CTH reaction was condensed as shown in Eq. (5). (5) A → Catalyst P r o d u c t s Since the fatty acid could be monitored easily, the rate law could be written as shown in Eq. (6). (6) - r A = k C A n where k and n are the rate constant and reaction order, respectively. Combining the rate law with the mole balance for a batch reactor, Eq. (6) could be written as shown in Eq. (7). (7) k C A n = - dC A dt Integrating Eq. (7) at the boundary condition (t = 0, C A 0 ; t = t , C A ), the instantaneous concentration of the fatty acid could written as in Eq. (8). (8) C A = C A 0 ( 1 - n ) - t k ( 1 - n ) 1 ( 1 - n ) Since conversion data was available, Eq. (8) could be written in terms of conversion, x , shown in Eq. (9). (9) x = 1 - C A 0 ( 1 - n ) - t k ( 1 - n ) 1 ( 1 - n ) C A 0 Also, the rate constant is related to the temperature as proved by Arrhenius equation (Eq. (10)). Arrhenius equation was employed based on the assumption that the rate constant depended on the temperature only. Besides, this equation has been verified empirically to give the temperature behavior of most reaction rate constants within experimental accuracy overly fairly large temperature ranges [25]. (10) k = A e - E a RT With the knowledge of initial concentration ( C A 0 ) of the fatty acid (0.0136 mol/L), the time of reaction, temperature, the rate constant, order of reaction, and activation energy of the reaction was estimated by employing POLYMATH software and Excel Solver facility. This was achieved by using least square method (Eq. (11)) by minimizing squared errors of conversion data. (11) f = ∑ i = 1 n X pred i - X exp i 2 Table S8 and Figs. S6–S8 highlighted the experimental and estimated conversion of the algae oil. The kinetic parameters could be found from Table 7 , which also highlighted the statistical parameters. The reaction was found to be first order (range from 0.76 to 0.92) whereas the activation energy was estimated to be 176 kJ/mol, which was lower than that obtained from the pyrolysis in the preceding section probably due to the use of catalyst. This value was obtained from linearizing Eq. (10) and plotting lnk against ( 1 / T ) (Fig. S9). The reaction rate constant could be estimated by Eq. (12). The activation energy for the CTH was somewhat lower than that obtained from the pyrolysis of the BI. (12) lnk = 22.5 - 21229.3 T 3.7.2 Material balance for CTH reaction To render the work beneficial to the biofuel readership, scale-up material balance was done by considering processing 1.0 g of BI (Fig. 20 ). With 1.0 g of BI, 62% of the oil would be extracted as estimated during the oil extraction. To ensure oil concentration of 0.0136 mol/L as used in this work, reactor volume of 87 mL would be required. It was estimated that the yield for liquid fuel was 42% while that for the gaseous products was 46%. With the high yield of gaseous product, the process would be sustainable if the gas were used as the source of fuel to power the reactor or used to generate electricity. It could be inferred from the material balance that the 2-propanol decomposed and produced to hydrogen and acetone, which in turn decomposed into alkanes (CH4 & C2H6) and CO [1]. These alkanes could further react to form long-chain or branched hydrocarbon. The material balance also revealed water yield of 7.8% that showed the presence of hydrodeoxygenation during the CTH reaction. It was also evident that there was coke yield of 4.5% that required catalyst regeneration. To fully appreciate the sustainability of CTH reaction with BI as the feedstock, exhaustive technoeconomic analysis must be made, but this is outside the scope of this work."
13,Conclusions,"2-propanol was used as both oil extract and in-situ hydrogen donor to convert oil-laden BI into liquid hydrocarbon fuel over a trimetallic catalyst. BI (from microalgae) with limited usefulness was employed to produce high quality gaseous and liquid high hydrocarbon fuels (jet-fuel range) by employing pyrolysis and catalytic transfer hydrogenation methods. The BI was characterized to evaluate the oil content, temperature at which thermal decomposition could occur. It was revealed that above a temperature of 400 °C, most of the BI was decomposed. Below a temperature range of 400–700 °C, most of the gaseous pyrolysis were oxygenates. However, increasing the temperature above 750 °C produced mainly hydrocarbon with significant alkenes, which are not chemically stable due their C = C bonds. Because of high cost in handling gaseous fuel, the BI was converted to liquid hydrocarbon products via CTH over NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite catalyst that produced mainly iso-cyclo alkanes (76%) that are chemically stable with considerable octane rating. Above 390 °C, significant amount of polyaromatics were produced, rendering the liquid products environmentally unfriendly. It was estimated that 2-propanol to oil ratio was 12.2 L/ liter algae oil compared to using gaseous H2 as hydrogen donor as found in literature (550 L H2/liter oil). This work showed a way to significantly eliminate the issue of handling huge volume of gaseous hydrogen in hydrogenation reactions. The trimetallic nature of the NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite was understandably able to enhance the cyclization and ring opening of the algae oil with insignificant coke formation. Despite the production of poyl-aromatics in the liquid fuel products, the TGA of showed only 4% weight increase due to coke formation, which was better than what was reported in the literature. Further characterization the catalyst revealed cubic nature of the zeolite, which slightly lost its crystallinity after one cycle run of the CTH reaction."
