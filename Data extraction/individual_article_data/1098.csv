0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes (UAL) to unsaturated alcohols (UOL) is a reaction of industrial importance [1–4]. The hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde to give selectively saturated aldehyde or unsaturated alcohols, could be achieved by choosing suitable metal complex catalyst [5–9]. So the selection of promoters, supports and reduction conditions is important for the selective formation of UOL. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have developed entirely new field in many natural science since their discovery at the beginning of the last decade [10]. The unique physical and chemical properties make them potential and promising applications in various areas like reinforcement materials and microelectronics devices. Recently, there has been great interest to use CNTs as catalyst supports. Such structures can display unusual behaviors compared to classical supports, especially for liquid-phase reactions and some meaningful results have been obtained [11–13]. A typical example of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes (UAL) to unsaturated alcohols (UOL) is the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CMA) to cinnamyl alcohol (CMO), one of the important starting materials for production of perfumes, flavorings, pharmaceuticals, and other fine chemicals. However, it is a challenging task to accomplish selective hydrogenation of the CO double bond since the hydrogenation of the CC double bond is thermodynamically more favorable than the CO hydrogenation, and low yields of the desired product are obtained with the conventional hydrogenation catalysts [14]. Only a few catalysts suitable for that purpose have been reported hitherto, most of them are Pt- and Co-based catalysts [15–19]. The aim of the present work is to report the preparation and the characterization of a platinum and cobalt-decorated carbon nanotubes catalyst and its implication in hydrogenation reactions. The catalytic activity is investigated for the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of CMA into the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (CMO) in mild reaction conditions. Comparison is made with Graphite supported Pt-Co catalysts in terms of activity, expressed as conversion, and selectivity towards the CC double bond and the CO double bond hydrogenation. The microstructure, H2 reduction and desorption properties of the catalysts are also studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and H2-temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) techniques, respectively."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation CNTs are prepared according to method described in Ref. [20]. The surface area of CNTs is 110m2/g and the average pore diameter value is 22nm, the pore volume is 0.311ml/g. The as-prepared carbon nanotubes are subsequently purified by thick nitric acid treatment at 80°C for16h in order to dissolve the residual catalyst which could be contained in their structure during the synthesis process and decorate the surface before used as catalyst carrier. The solid is filtered and washed several times with distilled water until the pH reached 7 and then dried overnight at 110°C. The surface area of commercial Graphite is 16m2/g and the average pore diameter value is 21nm, the pore volume is 0.0344ml/g. The Graphite is purified by thick nitric acid treatment also before used as catalyst carrier. Pt/CNTs and Pt/Graphite catalysts are prepared by conventional impregnation with an aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2. The sample impregnated is reduced by KBH4, filtered and washed with large amount of water, dried at 110°C overnight before use. The content of platinum is 0.50wt%. Pt-Co/CNTs and Pt-Co/Graphite catalysts are prepared by co-impregnation with aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 and Co(NH3)4Cl2 with a weight of Pt 0.50wt% and Co 0.17wt% (unless otherwise stated). The bimetallic catalyst preparation process is similar to monometallic Pt/CNTs and Pt/Graphite catalysts."
3,Catalyst characterization electron microscopy,"2.2 Catalyst characterization electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a conventional method to give detailed information about the shapes, mean size and size distribution of metallic dispersions. The microstructure of the carbon nanotubes supported platinum material is observed by TEM using a JEM-2010 (HR) apparatus operated at 200kV. The bulk composition of the samples is determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS)."
4,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),2.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are performed on a VG ESCALAB 2201-XL spectrometer. Non-monochro Mg Kα radiation are used as a primary excitation. The binding energies are calibrated with the C1s level of adventitious carbon (284.6eV) as the internal standard reference.
5,Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and desorption (H2-TPD),"2.4 Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and desorption (H2-TPD) The reduction properties of the supported Pt catalysts are measured by means of H2-TPR. Prior to experiments, 50mg of the catalysts are pre-treated in a He flow at 200°C for 15min. Then the sample is cooled to −50°C in flowing He. The feed is then switched to 5vol.% H2 in He, the reduction gas which is purified with deoxidizer and silica gel. The reaction temperature is programmed to rise at a constant rate of 10°C/min up to 300°C and the flow-rate is 30ml/min. Amount of H2 consumption during the H2-TPR is measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and the effluent H2O formed during H2-TPR is adsorbed with a 5A molecular sieve. The hydrogen uptakes are quantified using CuO as a standard. H2-TPD experiments are carried out over the same equipment of TPR studies. Prior to experiments, 50mg of the catalysts are pre-treated in a 5vol.% H2 in He flow at 200°C for 15min. Then the sample is cooled to −30°C in flowing 5vol.% H2 in He. The feed is then switched to He, which is purified with deoxidizer and silica gel. The reaction temperature is programmed to rise at a constant rate of 10°C/min up to 300°C and the flow-rate is 30ml/min. Amount of H2 desorption during H2-TPD is measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
6,Catalytic properties measurement,"2.5 Catalytic properties measurement The hydrogenation reaction of CMA is carried out at low pressure and low temperature, in a stainless steel reactor equipped with a hydrogen inlet, a teflon vessel and a muphet stirrer. A mixture of 0.36g catalyst, 8.0mmol CMA and 19.0ml C2H5OH is placed in the reactor. The reaction temperature is maintained by water bath. Chemical analysis of the products is performed by gas chromatography Perkin-XL equipped with a FID detector and SE-30 capillary column. Reactants and products are identified by comparison with authentic samples. Biphenyl is used as internal standard."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Electron microscopy,"3.1 Electron microscopy The TEM images and EDS patterns of Pt/CNTs and Pt-Co/CNTs are shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1(A) shows that most of the Pt particles over Pt/CNTs are dispersed more homogeneously on the outer surface of the nanotubes, leading to small diameters on the whole, and Pt particles have a wide range size of 2–5nm. Different preparing methods result in different dispersion of Pt particles over CNTs, since different surface property of oxidized CNTs is resulted. It is reported that HNO3-oxidized CNTs is negative net surface charge [21,22], which decides that CNTs will adsorb cations in the solution and favor their homogeneous dispersion on the outer surface. The TEM image of Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst is similar to that of Pt/CNTs. EDS analyses are performed to identify the composition of the material on the CNTs surface. From Fig. 1(B and C), it can be seen that the strong signal peaks of Cu appear in EDS patterns of the catalysts, which is caused by metal Cu net floor. There is only Pt signal peak appears in the EDS pattern of the Pt/CNTs catalyst while Pt and Co signal peaks appear simultaneously in the EDS pattern of the Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst, indicating that there may be strong interaction between Pt and Co in the Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst because of the close distance."
9,XPS,"3.2 XPS The state of Pt in the catalysts is also studied by XPS. Table 1 shows the binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 level for the Pt/CNTs and Pt-Co/CNTs catalysts. From Table 1, it can be seen that two doublets are obtained for both catalysts: one at a low binding energy, which can be assigned to metallic platinum, the BE values for Pt 4f7/2 levels of bulk metallic Pt, reported in the literature [23], ranged between 71.0eV and 71.3eV, and a second one at a higher binding energy, corresponding to Pt(IV) oxidized species[24]. The percentage of Pt(0) and Pt(IV) are also listed. After the addition of Co, the percentage of Pt(IV) increased definitely, which shows that the addition of Co is therefore to stabilize Pt in a high oxidation state and the low reducibility could be interpreted by a strong interaction between Pt and Co. These results are almost qualitatively in agreement with the TPR data discussed below."
10,H2-TPR,"3.3 H2-TPR The reducibility of supported platinum catalysts is an important factor influencing its catalytic property. H2-TPR profiles of the CNTs and Graphite supported Pt or Pt-Co catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 and values of the H2 consumption, H2 desorption and their peak temperature maxima are listed in Table 2 . (Note that the small apparent peak seen with all samples around −50°C is an artefact caused by the sudden increase in temperature when the temperature ramp is started.) From Fig. 2 and Table 2, it can be seen there is one H2 consumption peak at the temperature range of −30°C to 30°C representing the reduction of highly dispersed PtO2 species appears in CNTs and Graphite supported Pt or Pt-Co catalysts. For the CNTs supported Pt or Pt-Co catalysts, the value of H2 consumption is much larger than that theoretically expected 2.5μmol/gcat for the reduction of the all platinum from Pt(IV) to Pt(0) when the Pt content is 0.5wt%, which may attributed to the hydrogen spillover from reduced Pt0 onto CNTs [25]. Platinum particles can act as adsorption sites for hydrogen which, once dissociated, is spilt over the carbon surface [26]. And we find that the trend of the peak area increasing after the addition of Co is similar to that of their catalytic activities increasing. This suggests that the strong interaction between Pt and Co would improve the increasing of activated hydrogen number and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of CMA to CMO. As for the Graphite supported Pt or Pt-Co catalysts, the value of H2 consumption is smaller than the corresponding theoretical value because of the partial reduction of platinum already."
11,H2-TPD,"3.4 H2-TPD H2-TPD profiles of CNTs and Graphite supported Pt or Pt-Co catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 and values of the H2 desorption and its maxima peak temperature are listed in Table 3 . From Fig. 3 and Table 3, it can be seen that there is only one H2 desorption peak in all the catalysts and their supports, interestingly, the amount of H2 desorption in Pt/CNTs (Graphite) is larger than that in Pt-Co/CNTs (Graphite), and the desorption shifts to a lower temperature with the addition of Co. This suggests that the strong interaction between Pt and Co would also improve H2 desorption at low temperature because of the hydrogen spillover."
12,Catalytic properties,"3.5 Catalytic properties Fig. 4 shows the catalytic properties over Pt-Co/CNTs catalysts with different content of Co for the CMA hydrogenation. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the addition of trace Co to Pt/CNTs catalyst improves obviously catalytic activity and the selectivity for CMO. The Pt-0.17wt%Co/CNTs catalyst exhibits the best hydrogenation activity, the conversion of CMA and the selectivity of the hydrogenation for the CO double bond is 87.4% and 92.4%, respectively. The selectivity of the hydrogenation for HCMA (hydrocinnamaldehyde) and HCMO (phenylpropanol) decrease greatly at first and then remain almost constant with the increasing content of Co. To provide if the metal leaching into reaction solutions, the solution after once reaction is recycled with the addition of new material, the result show that the solution coming from the catalytic run is not active “itself” in the catalytic reaction. The influence of reaction temperature on hydrogenation properties of CMA is also studied under 2.0MPa of H2 pressure, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 shows that when the reaction temperature increases, the conversion of CMA over Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst increases slowly while the selectivity of CMA to CMO decreases slightly, and exhibits a higher selectivity (about 93.0%) of CMA to CMO at the temperature range of 50–70°C. When the reaction temperature is higher than 70°C, the selectivity of CMA to CMO decreases greatly mainly due to the selective hydrogenation of CMA to form HCMA and the yield of by-products, which by-products are considered mainly from the reaction between aldehyde (CMA) and ethanol. In the gas–liquid–solid three phases reaction, the increase of H2 pressure can improve the solubility of H2 molecule in the liquid phase, increase the frequency of collision between hydrogen molecule and the surface of catalyst, and so hydrogenation rate often increases with increasing H2 pressure. The influence of H2 pressure on hydrogenation properties of CMA over Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst is also studied at 60°C, and the results are listed in Table 4 . Table 4 shows that when the H2 pressure increases from 1.5MPa to 2.5MPa, the conversion of CMA over Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst remarkably increases and the selectivity of CMA to CMO increases as increasing H2 pressure, indicating that it is to improve the hydrogenation for the CO double bond as increasing the H2 pressure which is in accordance with the result of previously published by Zsigmond et al. for [RuH2(TPPMS)4] catalyst [27], and the catalyst exhibits the best hydrogenation rate (0.139s−1 for TOF value) when the H2 pressure is the highest of 2.5MPa. To investigate ulteriorly the influence of the nanosized channel structure of CNTs on catalytic properties, the selective hydrogenation properties over Pt/Graphite or Pt-Co/Graphite catalysts are also examined. The results are listed in Table 5 . From Table 5, it can be seen that large amount of by-products are produced because the reaction between aldehyde (CMA) and ethanol, and resulting in the higher conversion of CMA. The activity of the hydrogenation and the selectivity of CMA to CMO over Pt-Co/Graphite catalyst is obviously lower than those over Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst. The results suggest the unique features that the CNTs material possesses, such as its nanosized channel, the highly conductive graphite like tube-wall, the sp2-c-constructed surface, and its excellent performance of hydrogen adsorption and activation, make the CNTs full of promise to be a novel catalyst carrier. The influence of reaction time on the selective hydrogenation properties is also investigated over the Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst, and the results are showed in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6, we can see that Pt-Co/CNTs catalyst has a better reaction rate on the selective hydrogenation of CMA, and the conversion of CMA is higher than 87% and the selectivity of CMA to CMO is 93.0% when reaction time is 1h. But the conversion of CMA increases monotonously and the selectivity to HCMA decreases slightly with the reaction time, while the selectivity to CMO and HCMO increases."
13,Conclusions,"The Pt-Co catalysts supported on CNTs are prepared by wet impregnation and hydrogenation of CMA over the catalysts has been studied in ethanol at different reaction conditions. The results show that Pt-0.17wt%Co/CNTs catalyst exhibits the highest activity and selectivity at a reaction temperature of 60°C under a H2 pressure of around 2.5MPa, and 92.4% for the conversion of CMA and 93.6% for the selectivity of CMA to CMO, respectively. It is to improve the hydrogenation for CC double bond as increasing the reaction temperature and the hydrogenation for the CO double bond as increasing the reaction pressure. The Pt-Co/CNTs catalysts are also characterized by TEM-EDS, XPS, H2-TPR and H2-TPD techniques. The results show that Pt particles are dispersed more homogeneously on the outer surface of the nanotubes. The strong interaction between Pt and Co would improve the increasing activated hydrogen number because of the hydrogen spillover from reduced Pt0 onto CNTs, and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of CMA to CMO. In addition, the high selectivity obtained over the CNTs-based catalysts is also attributed to the complete absence of micropores and residual acidic sites in the support matrix. Such peculiar properties seem to be most promising for the future class of catalysts which will have to cope with the more and more demanding selective reactions, in order to reduce waste coming from further purification processes [28]."
