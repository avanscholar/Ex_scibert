0,Data Description,"This article shows the life cycle inventory (LCI) of the foreground system needed to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) of power production from sugarcane press-mud. These data give transparency to the main results shown in the reference article [1]. LCI was gathered from experimental data at lab-scale, simulation from Aspen Plus V9 (Aspentech, Bedford, USA), Ecoinvent database V3.4, scientific and academic reports, and websites. Fig. 1 shows the foreground system for producing power from sugarcane press-mud, while Table 1 shows the data sources employed to build the complete LCI. Mostly of the data information were retrieved from Aspen Plus and the main simulation flowsheets are depicted in the main manuscript [1]. Tables 2 and 3 describe the operating conditions of main processes highlighting that three scenarios were addressed under three different separation processes units: i) flash distillation (scenario 1); ii) mash column (scenario 2); and iii) mash column followed by a rectification unit (scenario 3). Figs. 2 -4 validate the simulation results by comparing them with both experimental (i.e., H2 composition) and commercial (i.e., polarization curves of fuel cell) data. Table 4 shows both the energy consumption and the cooling water demand of main energy blocks, such as pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, reactors, and condensers. Figs. 5 and 6 depict the Aspen flowsheets to produce biomethane and power in a Rankine cycle, respectively. Table 5 describes the operating conditions to produce biomethane from the solid fraction of sugarcane press-mud. Tables 6 and 7 show the power distribution in the 32 departments of Colombia. Fig. 7 portrays the block flow diagram to synthesize RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 and Au-CuO/CeO2 under laboratory conditions. Whilst Fig. 8 illustrates the block flow diagram to manufacture the main precursors to produce the above catalysts at industrial level. Table 8 describes the Ecoinvent assumptions to build the LCI of chemicals that are not included within Ecoinvent databases. Tables 9 –26 summarize the LCI of the foreground systems detailed in Fig. 1. Aside from the data shown in this document, the raw data to calculate the inventory data for both the power production from sugarcane press-mud and the synthesis of catalysts are shown in the repository in Mendeley [15]. On the one hand, the dataset associated with the power production from sugarcane press-mud included: (i) mass and energy balances from Aspen Plus and (ii) life cycle inventory and life cycle impact assessment of power production from sugarcane press-mud. On the other hand, the data associated with the synthesis of catalysts includes: (i) mass and energy balances to synthesize all precursors and catalysts at laboratory scale and (ii) life cycle inventory of the catalysts precursors and catalysts."
1,"Experimental Design, Materials and Methods","The detailed process to produce power from sugarcane press-mud is described in the related research paper [1]. Fig. 1 shows the main foreground systems. Detailed information about data acquisition, for each of the main units, is explained below."
2,Raw bioethanol production,"2.1 Raw bioethanol production Raw bioethanol production from sugarcane press-mud encompasses 3 main stages: i) pretreatment; ii) fermentation; and iii) inoculum preparation. Material and energy flows for said processes were calculated based on experimental work. The mass was measured in each stage by using an analytical balance. Moreover, the energy flows were calculated based on the thermodynamic properties and the chemical composition. Chemical composition of liquid samples was quantified by gas chromatography, whereas the sugarcane press-mud composition was quantified by SGS (Société Générale de Surveillance), a certified laboratory [2]. Thermodynamic properties were retrieved from Aspen Plus V9 (Aspentech, Bedford, USA). For the subsequent stages: bioethanol purification, syngas production and purification, and power production in a low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LT-PEMFC), Aspen plus V9 (Aspentech, Bedford, USA) was used and the non-random two liquid – Redlich-Kwong (NRTL-RK) thermodynamic package was employed."
3,Bioethanol purification,"2.2 Bioethanol purification Bioethanol purification is the second stage, as shown in Fig. 1. Material and energy flows were retrieved from Aspen Plus V9. The design specification tool along with calculator subroutines were used to define the operating conditions that warrant a steam-to-ethanol molar ratio (S/E) of 3. Three main scenarios were assessed, and the Aspen flowsheets are shown in the reference article. Besides, Fig. 2 shows the effect of molar reflux ratio on the sugarcane press-mud consumption and ethanol recovery in the rectification unit."
4,Syngas production and purification,"2.3 Syngas production and purification Syngas production was carried out in a Gibbs reactor system which models the Ethanol Steam Reforming (ESR) by using RhPt/CeO2-SiO2, as catalyst at 700 °C. Table 3 shows the description of main subroutines employed to simulate the syngas production and purification. Since impurities have an important effect on H2 production, a linear model developed experimentally was used to forecast the H2 production. Fig. 3 shows the validation between experimental work and simulation data. Material data of output streams were directly gathered from the simulation to define the water and air emissions to the ecosphere. Table 4 shows the energy demand and cooling requirements of each subroutine employed to produce power from raw bioethanol. These data were used to calculate LCI associated with heat, power, and cooling water requirements. Syngas purification was performed in a CO-removal reactor at 260 °C over a Au-CuO/CeO2 catalyst. RGIBBS subroutine was employed to model this operation. Both CO and H2 conversion models, retrieved from experimental data at lab-scale [5], were used to forecast the clean gas composition. To produce pure H2, a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit was employed. PSA unit was modelled by using a separator and defining both H2 purity and recovery. Prior PSA, a train compressor system was employed to adjust the operating pressure of PSA (i.e., 15 atm). Moreover, intermediary cooling systems and separators were employed to remove the water present in the syngas stream."
5,Fuel cell simulation,"2.4 Fuel cell simulation The electrochemical behavior of LT-PEMFC was modelled in Aspen Plus V9 along with FORTRAN statements based on the model recommended in the literature [16]. Moreover, the anode was modelled using a SEPARTOR (SEP), while the cathode was modelled using an adiabatic RGIBBS. The SEP splits the H2 fraction that is used in the LT-PEMFC and the RGIBBS simulates the chemical reaction between H2 and oxygen to yield water and heat as main products. RGIBBS was considered adiabatic. The design specification tool was used to calculate the cooling air needed to keep the fuel cell temperature at 70 °C. Heat was not considered as by-product. Fig. 4 shows the validation of the simulation according to the polarization curves between a commercial Ballard Mark V LT-PEMFC and Aspen results."
6,Aspen simulation to produce biomethane from residual biomass,"2.5 Aspen simulation to produce biomethane from residual biomass Fig. 5 shows the simulation to produce biomethane from the solid fraction of sugarcane press-mud. Herein, a theoretical estimation of the biogas production by anaerobic digestion was used according to the Boyle's formula (Eq. 1) and the following assumptions: (i) constant temperature and perfect mixing; (ii) ideal bacterial condition; (iii) biomass is modelled from ultimate analysis; (iv) products reaction include only CH4, CO2, NH3, and H2S; and (v) no accumulation of ashes [7]. The non-random two liquids (NRTL) thermodynamic model was used along with Henry law. Biogas upgrade to biomethane was done by high pressure water scrubbing. Proximate and ultimate analysis were included in the simulation. The solid fraction was created as a non-conventional solid. HCOALGEN and DCOALIGT were used to estimate the enthalpy and density of the biomass, respectively. FORTRAN statements were used along with simulation to adjust input and outputs of the flowsheet according to the requirements. Table 5 shows the description of the subroutines described in Fig. 5. (1) C a H b O c N d S e + A H 2 O → B C O 2 + C C H 4 + D N H 3 + E H 2 S Fig. 6 shows the aspen flowsheet diagram to produce combined heat and power in a Rankine cycle. Heat and power were used to supply the energy demand of the biomethane production process described in Fig. 5."
7,Modelling of Colombia power grid in different regions,"2.6 Modelling of Colombia power grid in different regions Colombia power grid was modelled by modifying the process unit “market for high voltage, APOS, U, CO” from Ecoinvent database V3.4 in the software OpenLCA V1.9. Different power grids could be modelled by using the data present in Table 6 to calculate the power share, as shown in Table 7."
8,Modelling LCI of catalysts,"2.7 Modelling LCI of catalysts Table 8 shows the assumptions made to calculate LCI of catalysts based on the Ecoinvent guidelines [9]. Besides, the use of scientific reports and lab-scale data were used to build the LCI [2,5]. Fig. 7 shows the block flow diagrams to synthesize RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 and Au-CuO/CeO2 catalysts at lab-scale. Fig. 8 shows the block flow diagrams to synthesize main precursors to yield the aforecited catalysts. All the block flow diagrams were built based on scientific reports. All the precursors were assumed to be manufactured in Germany, except cerium nitrate which was assumed to be synthesized in China. Detailed information of material flow calculation is shown in the up-coming section. 2.7.1 Synthesis of Rhodium chloride trihydrate (RhCl3.3H2O) Fig. 8a depicts the block flow diagram to synthetize RhCl3.3H2O based on literature review, described by Kleinberg [10]. The manufacturing of RhCl3.3H2O starts with the mining of rhodium (Rh), a noble metal which is found in the platinum group metal (PGM) ore in small quantities (i.e., 0.01%). After mining, synthesis process is carried out. The process involves four reactions (Eqs. (2) – (5)) and the overall yield is 1.64 kg RhCl3.3H2O kg−1 metallic Rh [10]. Stoichiometric relations and assumptions described in Table 8 were used to build the complete LCI to produce RhCl3.3H2O. (2) 2 Rh + 6 KCl + 3 C l 2 → 2 K 3 RhC l 6 (3) K 3 RhC l 6 + H 2 O → K 2 [ Rh ( H 2 O ) C l 5 ] + KCl (4) 2 K 2 [ Rh ( H 2 O ) C l 5 ] + 6 KOH → R h 2 O 3 . 5 H 2 O + 10 KCl (5) R h 2 O 3 . 5 H 2 O + 6 HCl → 2 RhC l 3 . 3 H 2 O + 2 H 2 O 2.7.2 Synthesis of acid Hexachloroplatinic hexahydrate (PtH2Cl6.6H2O) Fig. 8b shows the block flow diagram to synthetize PtH2Cl6.6H2O. Similar as Rh, the process starts from the mining and extraction of platinum (Pt) in the PGMs. Therefore, similar transport distances were assumed. Synthesis process was done according to the Ullman's Encyclopedia where metallic Pt is dissolved in a 7M solution HCl and Cl2, as shown in Eq. (6). Conversion of both HCl and Cl2 was assumed to be 100% [11]. Production of the hydrated salt was done through an evaporation-crystallization system. (6) Pt + 2 HCl + 2 C l 2 → Pt H 2 C l 6 2.7.3 Synthesis of copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2.3H2O) Fig. 8c displays the manufacturing process to produce Cu(NO3)2.3H2O. The process starts from the mining and extraction of metallic copper (Cu). After mining, Cu is mixed with nitric acid (HNO3) according to the Ullman's encyclopedia [12]. The reaction between Cu and HNO3 is shown in Eq. (7). The effluent from the reaction step is evaporated and concentrated to obtain crystals of Cu(NO3)2.3H2O. To determine the amount of crystal, solubility of the hydrated copper salt was considered as 77.4 g Cu(NO3)2.3H2O per 100 g water. (7) 4 Cu + 12 HN O 3 → 4 Cu ( N O 3 ) 2 + 6 H 2 O + 2 NO + 2 N O 2 2.7.4 Synthesis of Acid chloroauric trihydrate (HAuCl4.3H2O) Fig. 8d shows the block flow diagram to produce HAuCl4.3H2O, which starts with the mining and extraction of gold (Au) from the ore. The process to convert Au into HAuCl4.3H2O was described by Gross [14]. Firstly, Au is diluted in aqua regia (75% HCl, 25% HNO3) to produce HAuCl4 according to Eq. (8). However, a side reaction takes place between HCl and HNO3 (Eq. (9)). The reaction between Au and aqua regia is highly exothermic. Therefore, heat was assumed to be 0 and no energy source is required. Besides, water consumption was estimated according to the methodology process showed by Gross [14]. (8) Au + 3 HN O 3 + 4 HCl → HAuC l 4 + 3 N O 2 + 3 H 2 O (9) 3 HCl + HN O 3 → C l 2 + 2 H 2 O + NOCl 2.7.5 Synthesis of cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3.6H2O) Ce(NO3)3.6H2O is the precursor to produce the catalyst support in both cases. Cerium is a rare earth element and is mainly found on Bastnäsite ores (50%) in China. Hence, energy consumption was based on the Chinese power grid available in Ecoinvent V3.4. (10) Re ( OH ) 3 + 3 HN O 3 → Re ( N O 3 ) 3 + 3 H 2 O"
9,Transport,"2.8 Transport Transport distances among the locations on the different stages of the life cycle were calculated by using Google maps. Oceanic distances were calculated by using free calculators in web sites, such as sea-distances.org. When transport distances were unknown, 100 km and 200 km by lorry and railway, respectively, were assumed according to the standard distances set by Hischier et al. [9]"
10,Life Cycle Inventories,"Tables 9–26 show the LCI for all the stages involved in the production of power from sugarcane press-mud. LCI were used to calculate the environmental impacts, as shown in the main manuscript."
