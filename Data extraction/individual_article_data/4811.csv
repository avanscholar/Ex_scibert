0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (e.g. citral and cinnamaldehyde) is practically important and also challenging for both fundamental and practical points of view due to their complex reaction pathways and resulting various products [1–8]. Cinnamaldehyde (CAL) hydrogenation, for example, can produce useful unsaturated intermediates including CO hydrogenated cinnamyl alcohol (COL) and CC hydrogenated hydrocinnamic aldeyde (HCAL) for pharmaceutical and fragrance industries [9,10]. COL and HCAL may further be hydrogenated to hydrocinnamic alcohol (HCOL) as the final product (Fig. 1 ). Undoubtedly, fast reaction rate as well as high selectivity to desired product is always what we expect in selective hydrogenation. For this purpose, several important factors affecting the reaction rate and the product selectivity have been studied over the past decades, such as active metal [9,11–13], metal particle size [14–16], solvent effect [5,17] and particularly catalyst support and its surface chemistry [6,8,18–23]. Surface chemistry of a supported catalyst mainly influences the catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation via dispersion of active site, adsorption ability to reactants and their adsorption mode on catalyst [6,8]. Carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene are proved the promising supports for metal nanoparticles towards selective hydrogenation [24,25]. Besides some excellent characteristics including strong resistance to acids and bases, large surface area, high mechanical strength and minimal mass transfer limitations [10,11,25–28], CNMs possess exceptional surface chemical properties such as hydrophobic surface and good electronic transfer property, which favor the adsorption of organic compounds with weak polarity on its surface, enhancing the reaction rate. In addition, the different adsorption mode depending on CNM surface chemistry often leads to the different product selectivity as well. Jung et al. [28] and Ji et al. [11], for example, deposited Pt nanoparticles on the surface of CNTs and graphene, respectively. The resulting catalysts exhibited high catalytic activities, thanks to the strong π-π interactions between CAL and sp2-bonded surface of CNM supports. Furthermore, enhanced π−CO back bonding adsorption mode of CAL on metal nanoparticles increased the probability of the hydrogenation of CO bond, resulting in the high selectivity to COL. However, hydrophobic nature of CNM hampers high dispersion of metal nanoparticles on its surface, using conventional aqueous wetness impregnation technique in catalyst preparation. Therefore, CNM supported catalyst is typically prepared through a two-step process. It is firstly oxidized with concentrated sulfuric acid, nitrate acid and other strong oxidants to introduce some functional groups (e.g. carboxyl and hydroxyl groups) on its surface to increase anchoring sites for improving dispersion of metal nanoparticles on it. After impregnation of metal precursors and the following reduction, extra hydrophilic groups on the catalyst are further removed by chemical reduction or heat treatment with inert gases to recover its hydrophobic surface for the subsequent organic reactions [15,29]. Clearly, this treatment process brings about tedious operations. Hence, constructing a wettability-controllable surface (i.e. smart surface) on CNM is an efficient solution we are seeking for to achieve high catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation [30–33]. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), a well-known thermosensitive polymer, is a promising candidate to construct “smart surface” on catalyst. In this mechanism, CNM possessing thermosensitive smart surface exhibits an extended conformation in aqueous solution if ambient temperature is below its lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at about 32 °C, which gives a hydrophilic surface; while it curls to a compressed coil if ambient temperature ascends to above LCST, resulting in a hydrophobic one. At present, thermosensitive ploymer has achieved wide applications in many fields such as cell adhesives [34], controllable water permeation [35,36] and very recently catalysis [31,37–40]. Chen et al. [31], for example, prepared a graphene supported Au nanocatalyst with thermo-sensitive surface. It showed a thermo-controlled catalytic behavior with different catalytic activities in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol at different temperature windows (below or over 33–34 °C). Herein, we directly grafted PNIPAM brushes from CNT surface via a facile method, using persulfate as polymerization initiator. The resulting thermo-responsive CNT-PNIPAM hybrid was employed to prepare Pd catalyst (Pd/CNT-PNIPAM) for selective hydrogenation of CAL. Effects of catalyst surface chemistry on catalytic performance were discussed in this work. Compared to CNTs supported Pd catalyst (Pd/CNT), thermoresponsive Pd/CNT-PNIPAM exhibited an enhanced catalytic activity, meanwhile keeping the selectivity to COL unchanged. Obviously, the synthesized thermo-responsive CNT-PNIPAM is an efficient and competitive catalyst support for selective hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of PNIPAM brushes on CNT surface (CNT-PNIPAM hybrid),"2.1 Synthesis of PNIPAM brushes on CNT surface (CNT-PNIPAM hybrid) Before polymerization, the monomer N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, Aladdin, 98%) was purified by recrystallization twice from hexane, and dried under vacuum for 48 h at room temperature. In addition, CNTs were purchased from Heng Qiu Technologies, Suzhou, China. (1) Acidification of CNT surface Piranha solution (H2SO4: H2O2 = 3 : 1, v/v) was employed to produce hydroxyl groups (−OH) on CNT surface for the further grafting of polymers on it. Specifically, 1.0 g of CNTs was dispersed in 60 ml of piranha solution and kept stirring at 80 °C for 2 h. After that, CNTs was rinsed extensively with water and dried overnight. The resultant CNTs was labelled as CNT-A. The amount of hydroxyl groups on CNT-A surface was measured by ion exchange capacity. (2) Grafting of PNIPAM on CNT-A NPIAM (0.80 g) was firstly dissolved in distilled water (40.0 ml), followed by CNT-A (0.50 g) dispersion in it. Then, 4 ml of aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate (APS, Aladdin, ≥ 98%) with the concentration at 1.4 wt. % was dropped in it and kept stirring at 80 °C for 8 h under argon protection. The obtained hybrid was named CNT-PNIPAM."
3,Preparation of CNT-PNIPAM supported palladium (Pd) catalysts (Pd/CNT-PNIPAM),"2.2 Preparation of CNT-PNIPAM supported palladium (Pd) catalysts (Pd/CNT-PNIPAM) A series of Pd catalysts supported on CNTs (Pd/CNT-PNIPAM) were prepared via impregnation-reduction method in aqueous medium using KBH4 as the reducing agent. Specifically, CNT-PNIPAM (1.0 g) was impregnated with 200 ml of aqueous solution of PdCl2 (0.016 g, Pd ≥ 59%, Sinopharm, China) and stirred continuously at 25 °C for 1 h. 20 ml of aqueous solution of KBH4 (0.005 g, Sinopharm, China) was then dropped into the solution for Pd reduction at the same temperature. The reaction proceeded for 2 h. After that, the resultant Pd catalyst was filtered and rinsed with deionized water for three times to remove unreacted impurities and free Pd nanoparticles. The catalyst was finally obtained after drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. It was labelled as Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L). In comparison, another two catalysts were prepared at different temperatures from that of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L). The one that prepared via impregnation-reduction method at 50 °C was named Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H), while the other one that prepared by impregnating and reducing half of Pd precursors at 25 °C and then the other half at 50 °C was called Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH). In addition, CNT and CNT-A supported Pd catalysts were prepared using the same method as Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) for comparison. They were labelled as Pd/CNT and Pd/CNT (A), respectively."
4,Characterization of catalysts and supports,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts and supports The morphology of CNT-PNIPAM was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL-2010) at 200 kV. Some characteristic functional groups on CNT and CNT-PNIPAM hybrid were obtained by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, collecting on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. Thermal stability was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (STA449F3, NETZSCH) in the temperature range of 25–850 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in oxygen. Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman spectrometer (Bruker, SENTERRA) using a 532 nm laser excitation. Water contact angles (WCAs) were measured using an optical contact angle measuring device (KRUSS, DSA100). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 195 °C using an ASAP 2020 Micromeritics instrument. Phase-transition temperature of CNT-PNIPAM materials were tested on PerkinElmer DSC8000 Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The specific surface area of the catalyst was obtained using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model, and the branch average pore size was analyzed using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) formula. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al Ka radiation as the excitation source. The contents of various elements in the catalyst were determined by inductively coupled plasma-emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), which was carried out by a Perkin Elmer Optima 7000 DV analyzer. Organic elemental analysis (OEA) for CNT, CNT-A and CNT-PNIPAM composite were conducted on a Thermo Scientific™ FLASH 2000 CHNS/O Analyzer."
5,Catalytic performance on selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde,"2.4 Catalytic performance on selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde CAL hydrogenation was typically performed in an 80 ml pressurized autoclave at 80 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 pressure. The detailed reaction conditions was summarized in Table S1 in Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI). Specifically, approximately 0.2 g of a catalyst was dispersed in 40 g of isopropanol (IPA, A.R., Sinopharm, China) solution of CAL (A.R., Sinopharm, China) at a concentration of 5.0 wt. %. The reactor was then sufficiently flushed with nitrogen flow to remove dissolved oxygen. After the temperature ascended to the set value, nitrogen in autoclave was completely replaced with hydrogen. The reaction was carried out at 80 °C, maintaining the total pressure constant at 3.0 MPa by continuously injecting hydrogen into the autoclave. The stirring speed was controlled to approximately 800 rpm, guaranteeing the removal of external diffusion limitation. Small amount of samples were withdrawn from autoclave at different times in the reaction. They was analyzed by gas chromatograph (SP-7820) equipped with an FID detector and a CP7821 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). In addition, the reaction was carried out at 30 °C for comparison. Also, Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) was employed for recycling test through five consecutive reactions at 80 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 pressure. The recycled sample was labelled as Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH)-R."
6,Calculation of initial reaction rate in turnover frequency (Initial TOF),"2.5 Calculation of initial reaction rate in turnover frequency (Initial TOF) Due to the first order reaction of cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, initial reaction rate in TOF over five catalysts including Pd/CNT, Pd/CNT(A), Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L), Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) could be calculated using Eq. (3). (3) I n i t i a l T O F = k 1 × n C A L 0 × N S u r f a c e P d − 1 where k1 is reaction rate constant over the catalyst, n° CAL is initial mole amount of CAL and NSurface Pd is the molar number of surface Pd in catalyst."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis of PNIPAM brushes on CNTs,"3.1 Synthesis of PNIPAM brushes on CNTs PNIPAM brushes were grafted from CNT surface in this work by radical polymerization, using APS as the initiator. The structural properties of synthesized CNT-PNIPAM hybrid were characterized by some technologies including FT-IR, Raman, XPS, TGA, OEA and N2 adsorption. The results were compared to that of CNT. Initially, compared to FT-IR spectrum of CNT (Fig. 2 a), that of CNT-PNIPAM (Fig. 2b) showed three new characteristic peaks at 1665, 1545 and 1282 cm−1, representing band I, II and III of secondary amide group, respectively. It was reasonably originated from the side chain of PNIPAM, confirming the successful grafting of PNIPAM on CNT. In addition, appearance of ether group (C–O-C) with the characteristic peak at 1137 cm−1 on CNT-PNIPAM very possibly hinted the grafting of PNIPAM on CNT via covalent combination with ether linkage. Furthermore, Raman spectra of all CNT materials (Fig. 3 ) exhibited three characteristic peaks at 1347, 1575 and 2688 cm−1 on behalf of d-band, G-band and 2D-band, respectively. Compared to I D/I G for CNT (0.19, Table S2, ESI), the slight increase of that for CNT-A (0.21) hinted that partial oxidation to CNT with piranha solution in this work produced slight effects on the crystallinity and defect of CNT. However, after the further synthesis of PNIPAM on CNT, a great amount of disordered carbon (sp3) led to a significant increase of I D/I G for CNT-PNIPAM (0.39). After that, XPS spectra were analyzed to characterize the detailed surface chemical compositions of CNT materials. From Fig. 4 a, C1s spectrum of CNT showed only one peak with a binding energy of 284.6 eV, which represented graphitic carbon-carbon bond (CC, sp2). In comparison, a new independent peak (285.9 eV) representing C–O could be separated from that of CNT-A (Fig. 4b). Acidification with piranha solution resulted in the formation of hydroxyl groups on CNT-A surface [41]. The amount of hydroxyl groups on CNT-A was calculated to be approximately 5.2 mmol/g by ion exchange capacity. It would help the grafting of PNIPAM on it via covalent combination with ether linkages. After the synthesis of PNIPAM, according to the expected structure of CNT-PNIPAM composite, its C1s spectrum (Fig. 4c) was deconvoluted in five independent peaks at 284.6, 284.9, 285.7, 286.2 and 288.2 eV, corresponding to CC (sp2), CC (sp3), C–N, C–O and CO groups, respectively [32,33,42,43]. Obviously, CC (sp2, 284.6 eV) and C–O (286.2 eV) groups are originated from CNT surface, while CC (sp3, 284.9 eV), CO (288.2 eV) and C–N (285.7 eV) groups are typical in the structure of PNIPAM, hinting the synthesis of PNIPAM on CNT surface. The descending content of graphitic CC (sp2) in carbon composition (Table S3 in ESI) also supported it. In combination with O1s and N1s spectra of CNT-PNIPAM (Figure S1b and S1c in ESI), PNIPAM was successfully grafted from CNT, in accordance with FT-IR and Raman analysis. TGA and OEA were further conducted to determine the grafting amount of PNIPAM on CNT. As shown in Fig. 5 , both CNT and CNT-A showed only one significant mass loss between 600 and 850 °C with DTG peaks at 771 and 755 °C, respectively. It was related to the decomposition of carbon ring on CNT. The similar decomposition process over CNT and CNT-A indicated a slight impact of acidification on structural defect of CNT, in agreement with the result of Raman spectra. However, CNT-PNIPAM exhibited another significant mass loss in the range of 250–480 °C with DTG peaks at 332 °C, attributing to the decomposition of PNIPAM on CNT. The grafting amount of PNIPAM on CNT was calculated to be approximately 34.1 wt. % of the total. It complied with the calculation result based on OEA analysis (approximately 35.8 wt. %, Table S4 in ESI). Finally, the textural properties of CNT materials were analyzed by N2 adsorption-desorption measurement. Clearly, CNT-A exhibited the similar structural properties to that of pristine CNT (Table 1 ). It proved once again that although the process of acidification with piranha solution rendered a few OH groups on CNT surface, it had slight impacts on structural properties of CNT, in agreement with the results of Raman and TG. However, after the synthesis of PNIPAM on CNT, CNT-PNIPAM hybrid showed a decreased BET surface area (about 190 m2/g) in comparison to that of CNT and CNT-A (220 m2/g). We speculated that the grafted PNIPAM very possibly blocked some pores and tunnels inside CNTs, leading to the decrease of its surface area. In addition, the similar structural properties of CNT-PNIPAM to that of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM catalysts hinted the good stability of the hybrid. In conclusion from above characterizations, PNIPAM were successfully synthesized on CNT surface by the method of radical polymerization. The possible grafting mechanism was shown in Figure S2. Specifically, some hydroxyl groups were firstly created on CNT surface in process of acidification using piranha solution. Hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which were produced by thermal decomposition of APS in aqueous medium, further attack hydroxyl groups on CNT, leading to the formation of oxyradicals (C–O·) on its surface. Afterwards NIPAM monomers were continuously introduced to the sites of radicals that resulted in the growth of PNIPAM on CNT via covalent combination with ether linkages."
9,Thermoresponsive properties of CNT-PNIPAM,"3.2 Thermoresponsive properties of CNT-PNIPAM Thermoresponsive properties of CNT-PNIPAM was determined through water contact angles (WCAs) and dispersion tests in different solvents at low and high temperatures. Apparently, CNT possessed a hydrophobic surface, keeping WCA unchanged at approximately 150° when ambient temperature ascended from 25 °C to 50 °C (Fig. 6 a-b). In comparison, CNT-PNIPAM exhibited the thermoresponsive surface. Specifically, the hybrid showed a hydrophilic surface (WCA less than 15°) at 25 °C (Fig. 6c) while automatically switched to a hydrophobic one (WCA approximately 150°) at 50 °C (Fig. 6d). The dispersion tests also confirmed this conclusion (Figure S3, ESI). Obviously, CNTs agglomerated in water at any temperature due to its hydrophobic surface (Figure S3a and S3g, ESI). In comparison, CNT-PNIPAM showed the thermoresponsive property. It could be well dispersed in water at low temperature while agglomerated at high one, thanks to the change of the surface wettability from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity with the temperature increasing. In addition, CNT-PNIPAM dispersion in IPA was opposite to that in water. Although the nature of the protic solvent, IPA possessed the polarity of 4.3, between water (10.2) and toluene (2.4), which preferred the dispersion of nanoparticles with weak polar surface. CNT well dispersion in IPA at any temperature confirmed it (Figure S3d and S3j, ESI). The thermoresponsive surface of the hybrid gave the direct proof of the successful grafting of PNIPAM on CNTs. LCST of the hybrid was further estimated through phase-transition temperature using DSC, as shown in Figure S4 (ESI). In contrast to CNT, CNT-PNIPAM and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) exhibited clear endothermic peaks at about 37 °C thanks to the change of PNIPAM conformation at this temperature. Hence, LCST of the hybrid was confirmed at about 37 °C. The thermoresponsive property of CNT-PNIPAM would produce great impacts on Pd dispersion and the subsequent selective hydrogenation."
10,Catalytic performance of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM,"3.3 Catalytic performance of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM 3.3.1 Pd dispersion on CNT-PNIPAM A series of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM were prepared by depositing Pd nanoparticles on CNT-PNIPAM at different temperatures. Average sizes of Pd nanoparticles on catalysts were measured from TEM images (Fig. 7 ) and summarized in Table 2 . Apparently, the synthesis of PNIPAM helped the improvement of Pd dispersion on the support. Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L), for example, had the highest Pd dispersion (34.9 ± 7.8%) among five catalysts in this work, much higher than Pd/CNT did (12.1 ± 3.5%). Considered the lower BET surface area of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM than that of Pd/CNT, the high Pd dispersion on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM reasonably derived from its hydrophilic surface that provided more anchoring sites for Pd deposition on it. Pd3d XPS spectra of Pd/CNT and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) (Fig. 4d–e) were further analyzed to investigate the effect of supports on active sites. Apparently, both Pd catalysts exhibited four peaks at 336.1, 338.5, 341.3 and 343.6 eV, corresponding to Pd°3d5/2, Pd2+3d5/2, Pd°3d3/2 and Pd2+3d3/2, respectively. Pd° species on Pd/CNT surface accounted for approximately 91.4% of the total. In comparison, that on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) surface decreased to 85.2%. More Pd2+ species on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) than that on Pd/CNT was very possibly attributed to the coordination effect of nitrogen (N) atoms in PNIPAM side chain with metallic Pd nanoparticles. Some reports [44–46] suggested that N sites on supports provide electrons for coordination and anchoring with metal ions. Also, the Lewis basic site from N atom makes Pd2+ species rich. Hence, results further proved that the grafting of PNIPAM on CNT favors the dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, preventing their aggregation. Moreover, among three Pd/CNT-PNIPAM samples, Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) possessed comparatively lower Pd dispersion (27.9 ± 6.4%) than the other two did because its hydrophobic surface at high temperature hampered Pd dispersion well on it. Specifically, as shown in Figure S6 (ESI), PNIPAM exhibited an extended chain conformation at room temperature, which allowed a great amount of Pd nanoparticles to deposit on its hydrophilic side chains, resulting in a high Pd dispersion on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L). However, with the temperature ascending to 50 °C (>LCST), the conformation of PNIPAM automatically switched to a compressed coil in which hydrophilic side chains were inside the coil while hydrophobic backbones outside. Thus, the declined amount of exposed hydrophilic anchoring sites was unfavorable to Pd deposition, leading to a comparatively low Pd dispersion on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H). In addition, in preparation of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH), Pd nanoparticles could be deposited on PNIPAM including its hydrophilic side chains and hydrophobic backbone thanks to its consecutive preparation at room temperature (< LCST) and then a high one (> LCST). Therefore, Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) had a relatively higher Pd dispersion (30.8 ± 4.7%) than Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) did. 3.3.2 Catalytic activity of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM Catalytic activity of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM was evaluated in CAL selective hydrogenation at different temperatures. Generally, the reaction rates over the catalysts in this work always increased with the temperature ascending. CAL conversion over Pd/CNT, for example, was approximately 61% after 8 h at 30 °C (Fig. 8 a). Due to the first order reaction of cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, the reaction rate constant (k) at 30 °C was further calculated to be 0.12 h−1 in Fig. 9 a. However, k ascended to 0.23 h−1 at 80 °C (Fig. 9b), approximately twice as fast as that at 30 °C. Compared to Pd/CNT, Pd/CNT-PNIPAM showed a higher activity at a high temperature (> LCST). Reaction rate constant over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH), for instance, reached 0.75 h−1 at 80 °C, much higher than that over Pd/CNT (0.23 h−1) at the same temperature (Fig. 9b). The initial TOFs over them at 80 °C were further calculated, using Eq. (3). Through t-test statistics (P < 0.05), results exhibited the similar initial TOFs over them (Table 2). It indicated that CAL hydrogenation is very possibly structure insensitive, and the high activity over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM at high reaction temperature was reasonably attributed to the high Pd dispersion on it. On the contrary, Pd/CNT exhibited the higher activity than Pd/CNT-PNIPAM did at a low temperature (< LCST). Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH), for example, had k value of 0.067 h−1 (Fig. 9a) at 30 °C, only half of Pd/CNT did (0.12 h−1) at the same reaction temperature. The lower activity over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM than that over Pd/CNT at 30 °C was mainly ascribed to its hydrophilic surface that decreased the adsorption ability for CAL on it. It was thus evident that surface wettability of a catalyst played a key role on the activity via affecting the adsorption ability for reactants on it. Furthermore, three Pd/CNT-PNIPAM catalysts that prepared at different temperatures exhibited different catalytic activities. Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) generally possessed the higher activity than Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) did. Considering the similar surface wettability of three samples in the reaction, the comparatively lower activity over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) was reasonably relied on the less active Pd sites on it than those of the other two samples. Although Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) possessed the highest Pd dispersion among the catalysts, most of Pd nanoparticles deposited on hydrophilic side chains of PNIPAM (Figure S6). At the reaction temperature of 30 °C, reactants with weak polarity preferred being adsorbed on hydrophobic part of the catalyst including CNT surface and backbones of PNIPAM, where less Pd nanoparticles deposited on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) than those on the other two catalysts. Therefore, comparatively low contact frequency between CAL molecules and Pd nanoparticles on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) led to the slow reaction rate over it. In contrast, Pd nanoparticles on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) were mainly deposited on the hydrophobic backbones of PNIPAM as well as CNT surface. A great amount of CAL molecules was adsorbed on the hydrophobic surface neighboring to Pd nanoparticles, which enabled more active sites participate in the hydrogenation. It rendered comparatively fast reaction rate over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H). While as the temperature ascended to 80 °C, the conformation of PNIPAM switched from an extended one to a compressed coil. During this process, some Pd sites that deposited on side chains of PNIPAM were covered (Figure S6, ESI). Thus, the decreased amount of exposed Pd sites on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) logically led to the decline of activity over it. In comparison, the change of PNIPAM conformation had little effects on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) because most Pd nanoparticles maintained exposed outside during the reaction (Figure S6, ESI). The slight decrease of the amount of active sites on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) resulted in the high activity over it. The calculated lower initial TOF at 80 °C over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) (13.3 ± 3.0 min−1, Table 2) than those over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) (33.6 ± 5.2 min-1) and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) (29.3 ± 6.9 min−1, Table 2) supported this conclusion. Above results demonstrated that thermoresponsive smart surface greatly affected catalytic activity through regulating both the amount of active sites and the adsorption ability for the reactants on catalyst surface. 3.3.3 Selectivity to COL over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM In general, all catalysts in this work exhibited the predominant selectivity to HCAL at the reaction temperature of 80 °C (Fig. 10 ) because hydrogenation of CC is thermodynamically favored over that of CO. However, there existed some difference in product distribution over Pd/CNT and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM catalysts. At first, the catalysts with hydrophobic surface including Pd/CNT and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM possessed the higher COL selectivity than Pd/CNT (A) did. Pd/CNT, for example, had COL selectivity as high as approximately 30% at CAL conversion of 80%, higher than Pd/CNT (A) did (approximately 20%) at the same conversion. It was attributed to a change in the adsorption mode of reactants as a function of the surface wettability of the catalyst. Hydrophobic surfaces of Pd/CNT and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM at high temperature helped the adsorption of phenyl ring on them. Thus, a great amount of CAL molecules leaned against the neighboring Pd nanoparticles on the surface, directing CO group towards the periphery of Pd nanoparticle (Figure S7, ESI). Therefore, this adsorption mode enables the periphery of Pd nanoparticle to participate in the hydrogenation, leading to the higher COL selectivity over Pd/CNT and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM than that over Pd/CNT (A). Furthermore, among three Pd/CNT-PNIPAM samples, Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) possessed the higher COL selectivity (approximately 27% at CAL conversion at 80%) than Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (L) did (approximately 20% at the same CAL conversion) (Fig. 10). It could be explained that Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) and Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (H) deposited more Pd nanoparticles on hydrophobic surface of CNT and PNIPAM backbones, which favored more CAL adsorption on the peripheries of Pd nanoparticles, rendering the comparatively high COL selectivity over them. In conclusion, Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) exhibited enhanced catalytic activity in CAL hydrogenation, meanwhile maintaining the COL selectivity unchanged in comparison to Pd/CNT. 3.3.4 Recycling of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM The recyclability of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) was examined at 80 °C and its catalytic performance in five consecutive reactions were shown in Fig. 11 . The sample after recycling was labelled as Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH)-R. Actually, CAL conversion over it gradually decreased from approximately 95% to 84% in five runs, while remaining COL selectivity constant (approximately 30%) in each run. The decline of activity over Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) was mainly attributed to the mass loss during the recycling. Moreover, the recycled catalyst was characterized using TG, DSC and WCA, for checking its stability. Results indicated that Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH)-R remained the obvious thermoresponsive properties. It showed a hydrophilic surface (WCA approximately 18°) at 25 °C (Figure S8a, ESI) while automatically switched to a hydrophobic one (WCA approximately 150°) at 50 °C (Figure S8b, ESI). Through DSC, its phase-transition temperature was measured to be approximately 37 °C, similar to that of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) (Figure S4, ESI). The grafting amount of PNIPAM on recycled catalyst was further calculated to be 31% of the total (Fig. 5). Hence, these characterizations hinted the good reusability and stability of Pd/CNT-PNIPAM (LH) for CAL hydrogenation."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, we constructed a wettability-controllable surface on CNT via a facile method and employed this hybrid as the catalyst support for selective hydrogenation of CAL. In comparison to Pd/CNT, as-prepared Pd/CNT-PNIPAM exhibited enhanced catalytic activity, meanwhile maintaining COL selectivity unchanged, thanks to the high Pd dispersion on Pd/CNT-PNIPAM as well as its good adsorption properties for the reactants in the reaction. This work potentially created a highly efficient catalytic system for selective hydrogenation in application of scientific research and industrial production."
