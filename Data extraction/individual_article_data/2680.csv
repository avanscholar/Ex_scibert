0,Introduction,"Alkylated amines are fundamental organic chemicals that play an important role as building blocks in many organic synthesis reactions and have extensive applications in drug molecules, agrochemicals, polymer materials, and synthetic industries [1–6]. Synthesis of these compounds, which have such diverse and vital uses, is an important area of interest in synthetic chemistry. Traditional methods of obtaining these compounds are the hydroamination of alkenes or alkynes and the amination of aryl halides, the reaction of amines with alkyl halides, reductive amination of aldehydes or carboxylic acids [7–21]. But, because of these reactions have disadvantages such as poor yield and selectivity, a large amount of inorganic waste and atom uneconomy, a utilitarian method has attracted attention that it is called “hydrogen borrowing chemistry” or “hydrogen auto-transfer chemistry”. This method based on metal-catalyzed N-alkylation of an amine with an alcohol was reported firstly in 1981 [22]. In this process, alcohols are first dehydrogenated to form aldehydes, followed by the condensation of the resulting aldehydes with nucleophilic agents, which affords imine intermediates that are further hydrogenated by metal hydride species generated in the step of the dehydrogenation of alcohols to give alkylated products (Scheme 1 ). After the first use of RhH(PPh3)4] many useful homogeneous catalysts based on ruthenium, iron, iridium, palladium, copper, and manganese have been synthesized [22–28]. Although some of these metal precursors are almost ten-fold more expensive than cobalt precursors, cobalt-based catalysts were reported only a few studies until this time for the N-alkylation reaction. If we examine them, firstly, Kempe and co-workers described a new Co-PNP pincer complex that stabilized by a PN5P ligand (triazine backbone) which was highly active for the alkylation of aromatic amines in 2015 [29] (Fig. 1 a). In later years, Zhang employed cobalt(II) catalyst based on a pincer PNP ligand for the efficient N-alkylation of both aromatic and aliphatic amines with alcohols [30] (Fig. 1b). In another study, Zeng and Zhang presented selective alkylation of amines with amines to synthesize a large variety of secondary amines using the same cobalt catalyst [31] (Fig. 1b). Kirchner and co-workers described the efficient alkylation of amines with alcohols catalyzed by Co(II) complexes which are stabilized by an anionic PCP ligand based on the 1,3-diaminobenzene scaffold [32] (Fig. 1c). Balaraman described alkylation of aromatic amines by alcohols catalyzed by in-situ reaction using CoCl2·6H2O and triphenylphosphine as a ligand [33]. Benzimidazoles have attracted much attention due to their usage in many applications in coordination-, medicinal- and supramolecular-chemistry. Because of having high thermal stability, good catalytic performance and superior optical properties, metal complexes with benzimidazole ligands are important [34–39]. The cobalt complexes are easy to synthesize and simple to activate. They can be synthesized quantitatively on a multigram scale and are air-stable as crystalline materials for months. In only a few examples available in the literature, toluene has always been used as the solvent for the catalytic reaction medium. Herein, we report for the first time cobalt catalyzed the N-alkylation of amines with alcohols via the “hydrogen-borrowing” under solvent-free medium. Also, N-alkylbenzimidazole coordinated-cobalt catalyst was used the first time for the N-alkylation reaction in this study."
1,Result and discussion,
2,Synthesis and characterization of N-alkyl benzimidazole cobalt (II) complexes,"2.1 Synthesis and characterization of N-alkyl benzimidazole cobalt (II) complexes Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ligands have attracted attention in the fields of coordination chemistry, homogeneous catalysis and organic synthesis due to organometallic complexes bearing nitrogen donor ligands by a majority show high reactivities. Co(II) complexes bearing benzimidazole ligand were synthesized reaction of N-alkylbenzimidazoles with CoCl2·6H2O in very good yields and complexes 2a-c were characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, and FT-IR spectroscopies. Besides, suitable crystals of 2a were obtained and the structure of 2a was characterized by X-ray crystallography studies. The general synthesis pathway for N-alkybenzimidazole cobalt(II) complexes (2a-c) was summarized in Scheme 2 . The Co(II) complexes (2a-d) with blue color are air and moisture stable in the solid-state and soluble in dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide and halogenated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane but insoluble in petroleum ether, diethyl ether. At the elemental analysis, for all compounds (2a-c), experimental elemental analysis values of all compounds are compatible with the theoretical ones. In keeping with the a distorted tetrahedral geometry of the cobalt(II) atom, complexes 2a-c exhibited paramagnetic behavior. We noted that signals number of hydrogen atoms of the complexes was missing in the 1H NMR spectrum in the range 0–12 ppm. Also, no NMR signals of carbon atoms of the complexes could be seen in the range 0–200 ppm in the 13C{1H}NMR spectrum. Cobalt complexes (2a-c) have paramagnetic properties due to 3d configuration of cobalt(II) since signals of the aromatic protons appear as broad singlet and shifted downfield region up to 15.00 ppm according to ligands (1a-c). Also, aliphatic protons appear as broad singlet and shifted upfield region down to 1.00 ppm according to ligands (1a-c). The position and sharpness of the 1H NMR resonances clearly demonstrate the paramagnetic nature of the complex, indicative of a Co(II) complex. In the infrared spectrum of complexes 2a-c, strong peaks at 1509, 1516 and 1516 are assigned to CN vibrations, respectively. These NMR and FT-IR values are in agreement with reported data for N-coordinated cobalt(II) complexes in literatüre [41,44]. See the Supplementary data for print out of the elemental analysis, and spectrums of 1H, 13C{1H} NMR and FT-IR."
3,Description of the crystal structure,"2.2 Description of the crystal structure The molecular structure of 2a with the atom-labelling scheme is shown in Fig. 2 , while selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 1 . The complex consists of two 1-allyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole ligand with a CoII metal center and two chlorine ligands. The CoII ion is four-coordinated and adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry involving two nitrogen atoms from the two benzimidazole ligands and two chlorine atoms, with the Cl─Co─Cl angle [115.33(3)°] being significantly larger than the Cl─Co─N angles [average 109.33(5)°] and the N─Co─N angle [110.02(6)°]. The four-coordinate geometry index for the complex, τ 4 [48], is 0.94. In the case of ideal square-planar geometry, the τ 4 value is equal to zero, while it becomes unity for a perfect tetrahedral geometry. As a result, the value of τ 4 confirms the slightly distorted tetrahedral environment of the cobalt atom. The Co─N bond distances [2.0041(15) and 2.0147(15) Å] are somewhat longer than the sum of the individual covalent radii of the cobalt and nitrogen atoms (1.97 Å), while the Co─Cl bond distances [2.2440(6) and 2.2274(6) Å] are slightly smaller than the sum of the covalent individual radii of the cobalt and chlorine atoms (2.28 Å) [49]. The internal N─C─N ring angles at the carbene centers are 112.98(19) and 113.76(18)°. Bond lengths and angles around the cobalt atom are consistent with the similar structures with a chromophore group CoCl2N2 [50–55]. The benzimidazole rings are almost perpendicular to each other with a dihedral angle of 89.95(7)°."
4,The catalytic activity of complexes 2a-c in N-alkylation reaction of aniline with benzyl alcohol,"2.3 The catalytic activity of complexes 2a-c in N-alkylation reaction of aniline with benzyl alcohol Complexes 2a-c were studied in the N-alkylation reaction of aniline with benzyl alcohol. At the end of the reaction, two products may be formed, namely, amines (A) or imines (B). To determine optimum conditions for the catalytic system, we have carried out the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol using as base KOtBu in toluene for 24 h at 120 °C as a model reaction which catalyzed with 2c based on literature [32] (Table 2 ). To see the catalytic role of the cobalt catalyst, experiment without complex was performed and the reaction did not give any product (Table 2, entry 1). Under the same conditions, when 1.5 mol % 2c was loaded, the conversion was % 21 (Table 2, entry 2), when 2.5 mol % 2c was loaded, the conversion was 43% (Table 2, entry 3). Reducing the temperature of reaction to 100 °C, reaction resulted in a conversion of 21% (Table 2, entry 4). In the experiments at the same reaction conditions to see if it affects the yield of the reaction solvent-free medium, surprisingly, we found that the solvent-free medium increased the efficiency of reaction and selectivity of the amine with 75% (Table 2, entry 5). As a result of the optimization experiments, it was found that the optimal environment for this reaction is solvent-free medium, 120 °C, 24 h and using KOtBu base and % 2.5 mol catalyst. Based optimal conditions were applied to examine the substrate scope of the N-alkylation between various amines with alcohol derivatives using N-alkylbenzimidazole cobalt(II) complexes as catalyst (2a-c) at solvent-free medium and results are summarized Table 3 and Table 4 . Also, when referring to conversion and yield throughout the text it is meant the amine product (A). Under the optimal condition, N-alkylation reaction data among anilines with benzyl alcohols were showed in Table 3. On the N-alkylation reaction between various alcohol with the aniline, p-methoxybenzylalcohol gave the highest conversion at around 60–75% compared to other alcohols. (Table 3, entry 3). Among the complexes, complex 2c yielded the highest conversion. From the reaction of benzyl alcohols with p-(threefloromethyl)benzylaniline was obtained amine products in good conversions at around % 60–70 for all alcohol derivatives for the 2a and 2c (Table 3, entry 5–8). p-Methoxyaniline was converted to the corresponding amine in excellent yield (%85) with benzyl alcohol loading 2c (Table 3, entry 9). The reaction involving 2,4-dimethylaniline resulted in amine product in only moderate yield, due to the steric effect of an o-methyl group (Table 3, entries 13–16). In general, the complex 2b gave low yields and 2c provided the highest yield for all N-alkylation reactions. The activity of 2c may be attributed to the presence of electron donating-oxygen in the alkyl group bound to the nitrogen. Therefore, the presence of benzimidazole ligands bearing a different donating group such as ether side chains on the metal may radically increase the catalytic performance of the catalyst. The chelating nature of these ligands promotes production of highly stable complexes. The hemilabile part of such ligands is capable of reversible dissociation to produce vacant coordination sites, allowing complexation of substrates during the catalytic cycle. Although 3,4-dimethoxybenzylalcohol have electron-donating methoxy groups, due to sterically hindered of the o-methoxy group, it yielded the lowest conversion among the alcohols (Table 3, entries 4, 8, 12, 16). A heteroaromatic amine such as a 2-pyridyl amine was also efficiently alkylated with alcohol derivatives under optimal conditions. Except for furfuryl alcohol, 2-pyridyl amine was converted to amine products with all other alcohols in good conversion at around 50–80% using 2a-c catalysts (Table 4, entries 1–4, 6). In the literature, CoCl2·6H2O and PPh3 were used as in-situ for the N-alkylation reaction of benzyl alcohol and 4-methoxy aniline at 130 °C and 5% catalyst for 48 h and a yield of 73% was obtained. For the same reaction in our study, we obtained 87% yield with 2.5% 2c catalyst for 24 h h. While for the N-alkylation reaction of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and aniline at the same condition, reaction yield was 66% in the literature, in our study, reaction yield was 75% for 2c catalyst [33]. By comparison reported for related Co catalysts, in the present catalytic system using N-alklybenzimidazole cobalt(II) complexes are more economic due to solvent-free medium, higher efficiency and the cheapness of cobalt precursor [29–33]. The use of organic solvents as re-action media for hydrogenation reactions is very common. However, the practical use of organic solvents is limited due to the production of environmental waste and high energy consumption of the subsequent separation of the reaction mixtures. Thus, compared with diluted reaction, the solvent-free reaction is more efficient for scale-up and saves cost for solvent purification and recycling [56,57]."
5,Experimental,
6,Materials and methods,"3.1 Materials and methods All experiments were performed under argon in flame-dried glassware using standard Schlenk line techniques. All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co. (Dorset, UK). The solvents used were purified by distillation over the drying agents indicated and were transferred under Argon. Elemental analyses were done by İnönü University Scientific and Technology Center. Melting points were determined using the Electrothermal 9100 melting point detection apparatus in capillary tubes and the melting points are reported as uncorrected values. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR. 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were taken using a Bruker As 400 Mercury spectrometer operating at 400 MHz (1H), 100 MHz (13C) in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. 1H peaks are labeled as singlet (s). Chemical shifts and coupling constants are reported in ppm and in Hz, respectively. Catalytic reactions were observed on an Agilent 6890 N GC system by GC-FID with an HP-5 column of 30 m length, 0.32 mm diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh). All the measurements were taken at room temperature for freshly prepared solutions."
7,General procedure for the preparation of the N-alkylbenzimidazole cobaltII) complexes,"3.2 General procedure for the preparation of the N-alkylbenzimidazole cobaltII) complexes All compounds were sythesized according to literature [40,41]. Benzimidazole (10 mmol) was added to a solution of NaH (10 mmol) in dry THF (30 mL), the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and corresponding alkyl halides (10.1 mmol) was added dropwise and heated for 24 h at 60 °C. Then, the THF was removed under the vacuum. Dichloromethane (50 mL) was added upon to solid. The mixture was filtered and the obtained clear solution was concentrated under vacuum. Then the solution was distillated and 1-alkylbenzimidazoles (1a-c) were obtained. A solution of CoCl2·6H2O (0.10 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) was carefully added to a solution of 1a-c (0.20 mmol) in chloroform (5 mL) to give two layers. Blue crystals were obtained after a few days. The solid (2a-c) was filtered and washed with diethyl ether (3 × 10 mL) and dried under vacuum. 3.2.1 1-Allylbenzimidazole, 1a [42] Yield: 76%; liquid product; FT-IR ν (CN): 1615 cm−1; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 7.93 (s, 1H, NCHN), 7.84 (t, 1H, NC6 H 4 N, 3 J = 4 Hz),7.40 (t, 1H, NC6 H 4 N, 3 J = 4 Hz), 7.32 (d, 2H, NC6 H 4 N, 3 J = 4 Hz), 6.03 (quint, 1H, NCH2CHCH2, 3 J = 8 Hz), 5.32 (d, 1H, NCH2CHCH 2, 3 J = 8 Hz), 5.22 (d, 1H, NCH2CHCH 2, 3 J = 16 Hz), 4.80 (s br, 2H, NCH 2CHCH2). 13C{1H} NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 143.8 (NCHN), 142.9, 140.9, 133.8, 131.9, 123.0, 122.2, 120.3, 118.7 and 110.0 (NC 6H4N and NCH2 CHCH2), 47.4 (NCH2CHCH2).

9,Crystal structure of complex 2a,"3.4 Crystal structure of complex 2a Intensity data of 2a were collected on a STOE IPDS II diffractometer at room temperature using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation by applying the ω-scan method. Data collection and cell refinement were carried out using X-AREA while data reduction was applied using X-RED32 [45].

The crystallographic data and refinement parameters are summarized in Table 5 . The molecular graphic was created by using ORTEP-3 [47]."
10,Conclusion,"As a result, three N-alkylbenzimidazole cobalt(II) complexes (2a-c), including two new compounds, were synthesized. The structure of complexes 2a was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. All complexes were investigated catalytic activities on alkylation reaction of amines with alcohol derivatives. For the first time in the literature, N-alkylbenzimidazole complexes were on alkylation reaction of amines with alcohol derivatives performed under the solvent-free medium. It was found that in the solvent-free medium is more efficient and selective compared with a solvent medium such as toluene by using complexes 2a-c as catalysts. Cobalt is almost ten-fold cheaper than other metals such as ruthenium, palladium, iridium, and cobalt complexes are easy to synthesize and simple to activate. They can be synthesized quantitatively on a multigram scale and are air-stable as crystalline materials for months. As a result, cobalt-based compounds appear to be economical for N-alkylation reaction."
