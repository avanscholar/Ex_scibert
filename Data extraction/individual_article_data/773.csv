0,Introduction,"Currently-revealed greenhouse effects and global climate warming due to high rate CO2 emissions make it an urgent task to accelerate the transition from fossil-based energy systems to CO2-free energy circulation systems [1]. As a typical clean energy carrier, hydrogen that is primarily generated from water, can efficiently address the issues of sustainability and environmental emissions [2,3]. However, commercial hydrogen is mainly produced by fossil fuel reforming, leading to the release of large quantities of CO2. Besides, it still remains a technological challenge to develop an efficient hydrogen storage/release system for long-term storage and long-distance transportation [4-6]. As such points limit the wide application of the hydrogen-based energy system, it is of significance to develop other alternative energy carriers to replace hydrogen. As another CO2-free energy carrier, alcohol is currently considered as a potential candidate because of its considerably high energy density, high chemical stability and low-cost production [7,8]. Yamauchi et al. reported a CO2-free power circulation using oxalic acid (OX), a divalent carboxylic acid, to produce glycolic acid (GC), a monovalent alcohol, through the 4-electron reduction of OX by the oxidation of water as described by the following equations [9-11]. (1) HOOCCOOH + 4H+ + 4e− → HOOCCH2OH + H2O + 0.13 V vs. RHE (cathode) (2) 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e− + 1.23 V vs. RHE (anode) (3) HOOCCOOH + H2O → HOOCCH2OH + O2 1.1 V vs. RHE (overall) The theoretical capacity of the GC solution produced by the electrochemical reduction of OX (~3.89 M) is ~417 Ah L−1, which is ~190 times higher than that of hydrogen gas (2.2 Ah L−1 (SATP)) [12]. The most important requirement for the cathode catalyst is high selectivity for the electroredution of OX and antase TiO2 was found to be the best catalyst for this purpose. [9] A flow-type polymer electrolyzer for the continuous GC production from OX, called the polymer electrolyte alcohol electrosynthesis cell (PEAEC), was fabricated based on the GC/OX redox couple (see the Supplementary Information, Fig. S1) [12-14]. The OX is first reduced to glyoxylic acid (HOOCCOOH, GO) through a two-electron reduction, then reduced to GC through further a two-electron reduction [15] (see Fig. S2). For the construction of PEAEC, Yamauchi et al. prepared a novel membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), which consisted of a porous TiO2-decorated Ti felt cathode, Nafion 117 polymer electrolyte and gas diffusion anode [12,13]. An electrode needs to have high permeability of the substrate solution. Thus, Ti mesh or Ti felt was selected as an electrode because of their porous structure. Rigid linking between the electrode and catalysts is also very important. Thus, TiO2 is directly grown on the surface of the Ti mesh to obtain a TiO2-Ti cathode through a two-step hydrothermal reaction [12,13]. As the energy efficiency is limited by the high overpotential for water oxidation at the anode, the development of an efficient anode catalyst to reduce the overpotential is of importance for obtaining high PEAEC performance [16,17]. The requirements for the PEAEC anode catalyst are very vital and severe. Because of the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability in an acidic medium, IrOx is considered to be the most promising anode catalyst for the PEAEC. Such an IrOx is usually sputtered on porous conductive substrates, such as carbon or Ti paper, to form a composite gas diffusion anode to ensure a high conductivity. However, there are two problems to be addressed for this method. One problem is that when using a physical sputtering method, the interaction between IrOx and the substrates is not strong enough, then adding a Nafion binder is required, which is not preferable for the electrolysis of the PEAEC. Another one problem is that the Ir consumption of this method is not low. Therefore, because of the high cost and low elemental abundance of Ir, it is crucial to reduce the amount of Ir to a minimum level without compromising the catalytic activity for the future evolution of the PEAEC. In our previous study, we designed and prepared a 3D-structured material, the IrOx-TiO2-Ti (ITOT) catalyst, in which IrOx nanoparticles were deposited on the surfaces of Ti mesh-supported TiO2-nanorods [18]. The catalyst with the loading of IrOx = 0.58 mg cm−2 showed an excellent OER activity in acidic media. In this study, we describe i) the synthesis of a new IrOx-Ti (IT) catalyst by depositing IrOx nanoparticles directly on the surfaces of a porous Ti mesh via a simple in situ growth method, in which the catalyst has a much lower IrOx loading amount (0.09–0.25 mg cm−2) than ITOT, ii) excellent OER activity and durability of IT in acidic media, and iii) PEAEC performance using the ITOT and IT catalysts as the anode materials. One advantage of using the ITOT and IT catalysts as anodes in the PEAEC is that the interaction between IrOx and the substrates is enhanced by introducing in situ growth method. Besides, it is no need to add Nafion as a binder, and the performance of the obtained PEAEC is better than that of using the commercial IrO2-Ti paper anode (loading of IrO2 = 3 mg cm−2). In this study, we demonstrate that the PEAEC performance using the IT anode is much higher than that of using ITOT even though the OER activity of ITOT is better than that of the IT. We also focus on the mechanism of this high performance PEAEC based on the IT anode."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The Ti mesh (twill weave, 100 μm line diameter) was purchased from Manabe Industry, Co., Ltd. The IrO2 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation), OX•2H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.), and IrCl3•xH2O (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) were used as purchased. Nafion 117 (0.007 inch thickness) and Nafion solution (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Co. Ethylene glycol (EG) and 0.05 M H2SO4 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical, Ltd. The PEAEC evaluation systems (carbon block electrodes with flow channels, 1–25 cm2, serpentine flow) were purchased from ElectroChem, Inc."
3,Synthesis of IrOx-Ti (IT) catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of IrOx-Ti (IT) catalyst The IT catalyst was prepared by a wet-process in situ reduction method. Before the reduction, the Ti mesh was washed with acetone then in methanol via sonication for 3 times in order to remove the surface impurities and oil contamination. After washing and drying, the weight and area of the Ti mesh were measured and recorded as M1 and S, respectively. This mesh was then immersed in an IrCl3 solution under an N2 atmosphere for 6 h in an oil bath (140 °C) and refluxed to in situ grow IrOx nanoparticles on the surfaces of the Ti mesh, in which the IrCl3 solution was prepared by dissolving IrCl3•xH2O into an ethylene glycol (EG)-water (volume ratio 3/2) solution. After in situ growing, the mesh was rinsed with water then in methanol for 3 times, then dried overnight. The final obtained IrOx-Ti (IT) mesh was weighed and recorded as M2. The deposition amounts of the IrOx were calculated by the formula (M2−M1)/S. We prepared three different IT catalysts with the IrOx loading amounts of 0.09, 0.16, 0.25 mg/cm2, which denoted as IT-0.09, IT-0.16 and IT-0.25, respectively. These three catalysts were prepared by once, twice and three times wet-process. A Ti mesh, ITOT catalyst and commercial IrO2-Ti paper (IrO2 loading = 3 mg/cm2) were used as comparison catalysts. The IrOx loading amount of the ITOT was 0.58 mg/cm2, so it is denoted as ITOT-0.58 (for the synthesis of this catalyst, see our previous paper, ref. #18)."
4,Materials characterizations,"2.3 Materials characterizations Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a JSM-IT100 (JEOL, Ltd.) and SU9000 (Hitachi High-Technologies) at the accelerating voltage of 20 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images were taken by a JEM-ARM200F instrument (JEOL Ltd.) at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained by an AXIS-ULTRA DLD (Shimadzu, Co., Japan). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were carried out using Kyushu University Beamline (SAGA-LS/BL06) equipped with a storage ring operating at the energy of 1.4 GeV. A monochromator with two Si (111) crystals was used to scan the energy of the X-ray beam. The photon flux was 2 × 1010 photons/s. The Ir l-edge of the IT samples was measured in the fluorescence mode with a silicon drift detector. The data analysis was performed using Athena and Artemis software of the IFEFFIT package. The OER performances of the catalysts were measured by a three-electrode system. The electrochemical characterization was conducted by a Model 760E Electrochemical Analyzer (ALS Co., Ltd.) at 25 °C in a 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution. All potentials were normalized with respect to the RHE. The IR-compensated OER polarization curves were collected in an N2-saturated electrolyte at the sweep rate of 10 mV s−1. The potential vs. Ag/AgCl was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.059 V × pH Durability was evaluated by a chronopotentiometry test at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The potentials were recorded as a function of time and after IR-compensated."
5,Fabrication and electrolysis procedure of PEAEC,"2.4 Fabrication and electrolysis procedure of PEAEC The detailed structural schematic of the PEAEC is shown in Fig. S1. The core component of PEAEC is a novel membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), which is composed of the TiO2-Ti cathode, IT (or IrO2/C) anode and Nafion 117 as the solid polymer electrolyte membrane. The sizes of the cathode and anode are both 2 cm × 2 cm. The MEAs were prepared by a hot press method as described in a previous paper.12 In order to have a better sealing and electrical contact, the silicon rubber and calcined Ti felt were inserted between the Ti block and both sides of the MEA. The PEAEC used different flowing solutions in the cathode (1 M aqueous solution of oxalic acid) and anode (deionized water) sides during the electrolysis procedure. In order to avoid the influence of O2, both of the solutions were bubbled with Ar and degassed by a degasser (Gastorr BG-34, FLOM Co.) before flowing. The electrolysis procedure was conducted at 60 °C and 0.5 ml min−1 solution flowing rate that was controlled by a flow controller on each side. A potentiogalvanostat (1280 C, Solartron) was used to monitor the voltage to a constant state and the cathode products solution was collected for 20 min at each applied voltage. The response currents at different voltages were recorded by this electrochemical workstation directly. The current area was 2 cm × 2 cm. Then the current densities at different potentials are obtained. This value was used to compare the power generating capacity of the PEAEC system. The composition of the products was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, LC-20AD, Shimadzu Co.) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID-10A, Shimadzu) and a diode-array detector (SPD-M20A, Shimadzu)."
6,Definition of numbers of electrons,"2.5 Definition of numbers of electrons The number of electrons is defined as the number of electrons that are related to the oxidized product formation from OX. The number of electrons was calculated from the amount of an oxidized product, which was quantified by HPLC, from the reaction solution in the anodic cell. For example, 2 and 4 electrons are required for GO and GC from OX. Therefore, if x mol GO and y mol GC were detected, the numbers of electrons for GO and GC formation can be calculated using the equations below. Number of Electrons for GO = x × 2 Number of Electrons for GC = y × 4"
7,Definition of OX conversion,"2.6 Definition of OX conversion Conversion was defined as the percentage of electrons related to the specific product formation out of the total electrons for all product formation. This value can be calculated from the number of electrons for a specific product and sum of them for all the products. During the electrolysis process, a slight amount of GO was also observed as an intermediate product. Since the complete conversion to GC can produce more energy, GC is the target product. If x mol GO and y mol GC were detected, the OX conversion can be calculated using the following equation. C o n v e r s i o n o f O X = N u m b e r o f E l e c t r o n s f o r G C N u m b e r o f E l e c t r o n s f o r A l l P r o d u c t s = y × 4 ( x × 2 ) + ( y × 4 )"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of materials,"3.1 Characterization of materials Fig. 1 shows SEM images and EDS diagrams of the Ti and IT catalysts. As seen in Fig. 1a and c, the surfaces of the Ti mesh are rough and irregular. After in situ growing, we obtained an IT whose SEM (Fig. 1b and d) provided a structure that resembled the original Ti. Compared to the EDS diagram of Ti (Fig. 1e), we observed a distinct Ir peak in addition to Ti in the IT-0.25 in its EDX diagram (Fig. 1f). Elemental quantification results of Ti and IT-0.25 catalyst are shown in Tables S1 and S2. For IT-0.25 catalyst, the atomic ratio of Ir to O was 1.1224 to 0.0665, which indicated that a large amount of Ir metal was loaded on the surface of the Ti mesh after the wet process. The high-angle annular dark field STEM (HAADF-STEM) image of the IT catalyst is shown in Fig. 2 a, in which the lattice spacings of 0.22 nm and 0.23, 0.26 and 0.32 nm correspond to the (111) crystal plane of Ir, and the (200), (101), (110) crystal planes of IrO2, respectively, suggesting the coexistence of the Ir metal and IrO2 clusters on the surfaces of the IT-0.25. The coexistence of Ir and IrO2 is also confirmed by the diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 2b. The lattice spacing of 0.221 and 0.135 nm in the diffraction pattern correspond to the (111) and (220) crystal faces of Ir, while 0.320, 0.257, 0.225, 0.170 and 0.145 nm are assigned to the (110), (101), (220), (211) and (310) crystal planes of IrO2, respectively [19-21]. As shown in Fig. 2c, the HRTEM image also shows the lattice spacing of both Ir and IrO2. The EDS mapping images of the sample (Fig. 2d-f) show that the existence of the elements Ti and Ir agreed with the STEM image. In order to analyze the surface chemical states, we conducted XPS measurements for the IT-0.09, IT-0.16, IT-0.25, ITOT-0.58 and commercial IrO2-Ti paper. Fig. 3 a shows the Ir 4f XPS diagrams of the six samples. Except for the Ti mesh, the other five samples all provided distinct Ir 4f peaks, among which only the Ir4+ peaks were observed on the commercial IrO2-Ti paper. It is considered that the Ir 4f peaks of ITOT-0.58 are between Ir0 and Ir4+, which indicated the intermediate valence state of Ir between Ir0 and Ir4+, which is consistent with our previous results [18,22-24]. However, for the three IT catalysts, the main peaks are assigned to the Ir0 whose peak area also overlapped with Ir4+, which indicated that the Ir0 and Ir4+ coexisted, but the Ir0 dominated on the surfaces of the IT catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3b, the O 1 s peak in the Ti mesh is assigned to TiOx, indicating the oxidation of the Ti surfaces. For the commercial IrO2-Ti paper, the O 1 s peak is very broad, which suggested that the oxygen species on the surface are varied and complicated. The two O 1 s peaks on the ITOT-0.58 are assigned to IrOx and TiOx, respectively [18,23-27]. However, for the IT samples, the O 1 s peaks are definitely assigned to IrOx. The disappearance of the TiOx peak indicated that IrOx clusters almost completely covered the surfaces of the Ti mesh. The Ti 2p XPS spectra were also measured and the result is shown in Fig. S3, in which the Ti mesh and the ITOT-0.58 show obvious Ti 2p peaks. However, for the commercial IrO2-Ti paper and IT samples, there are no Ti 2p peaks in their XPS spectra, which also indicated that the Ti surfaces were efficiently covered by the IrOx clusters. The OER activity of these catalysts was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the result is shown in Fig. 4 a, in which the OER of ITOT is taken from our previous paper [18]. For the Ti mesh, no obvious OER current response was observed. At the current density of 10 mA cm−2, the EOER potential of ITOT-0.58, IT-0.25, IT-0.16, IT-0.09 and commercial IrO2-Ti paper were 1.449, 1.478, 1.485, 1.491 and 1.571 V vs RHE, respectively. Among these, the ITOT-0.58[18], which has a wide electrochemical double layer capacitive current, showed the best OER activity. For the IT catalysts, the performance slightly increased with the increasing IrOx amounts although the difference is not very significant. Notably, although the amounts of IrOx in the IT catalysts are much lower and the synthetic procedures are much simpler than those of the ITOT-0.58, their OER activities were not much different from that of the ITOT-0.58. The chronopotentiometry test of the IT-0.25 was conducted and the 100-h duration result is shown in Fig. 4b, in which at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, the potential did not apparently change even after the 100-h durability test. We also compared the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the ITOT-0.58 and IT-0.25 catalysts. The ECSA values were evaluated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which was determined from the double-layer charging curves using the CVs in the potential range of 1.2–1.4 V [28-30]. The CVs of ITOT-0.58 and IT-0.25 at different scan rates are shown in Fig. S4a and b. As shown in Fig. S4c, the plot of the current density (at 1.25 V) versus the scan rate has a linear relationship and the slopes in the figure provide the Cdl of the catalysts to be 40.3 and 258.4 mF cm−2 for the IT-0.25 and ITOT-0.58, respectively. The observed higher Cdl of the ITOT catalyst would be due to the higher IrOx loading amount and mixed-valent IrIII/IV hydrated amorphous oxyhydroxides on the catalyst [18]."
10,PEAEC performance,"3.2 PEAEC performance We used the above three IT catalysts (IT-0.09, IT-0.16, and IT-0.25) as the anode materials in PEAEC and also used ITOT-0.58 and commercial IrO2-Ti paper for comparison. The PEAEC performance was evaluated by using an electrolyzer with a two-compartment, three-electrode system and PEAEC technology. To evaluate the performance of the PEAEC for the continuous electrochemical production of GC from OX, we first conducted the controlled-potential electrolysis of OX at various potentials in the range from 1.8 to 2.8 V using the prepared MEA (OX conc. =1 M, cathode: TiO2-Ti, reaction area = 4 cm2, flow rate = 0.5 mL min−1, temp. = 60 °C). Under the different applied potentials, the continuous response currents were recorded by using an electrochemical workstation, and the obtained response current densities of the PEAEC are shown in Fig. 5 . The impedance of the PEAEC systems was recorded as |Z|. As shown in Fig. 5a, the average current density of PEAEC with the commercial IrO2-Ti paper anode was only 0.174 mA cm−2 and its impedance |Z| was 0.41 Ω. When using ITOT-0.58 as the anode (Fig. 5b), the impedance |Z| increased to 0.82 Ω, which would be due to the low conductivity of TiO2, and the average current density of PEAEC still increased to 0.300 mA cm−2, indicating that high OER activity was beneficial for the PEAEC performance. As shown in Fig. 5c-e, when using IT-0.09, IT-0.16 and IT-0.25 as the anode, their average current densities of the PEAEC were 0.318, 0.421 and 0.636 mA cm−2, respectively. It is evident that as the IrOx loading amount increased, the current density of the PEAEC at the different applied potentials drastically increased. The impedance |Z| values of these three systems using IT-0.09, IT-0.16 and IT-0.25 were 0.91, 0.43 and 0.23 Ω, respectively, indicating that the impedance decreased with the increasing IrOx amounts. Since the OER activities of these three catalysts are not much different (see Fig. 4a), the progressive PEAEC performance would be derived from the decreasing impedance of the systems. Notably, although the OER activity of the ITOT-0.58 was better than that of IT-0.25, the PEAEC performance using the IT-0.25 anode was much higher than that of the ITOT-0.58 anode. Such a higher PEAEC performance of the IT-0.25 would be due to its lower impedance |Z|, and such factor is crucial for obtaining a high PEAEC performance. The conversion of OX and yields of GO and GC in the PEAEC were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6 a, c and e, the max OX conversion of PEAEC using the commercial IrO2-Ti paper as the anode was 31.7%, while the conversion increased to 40.5% and 54.0% when using ITOT-0.58 and IT-0.25 anode, respectively. Such an improvement was observed for the GC/GO yield rate of the PEAEC (Fig. 6b, d and f); namely, both OX conversion and GC/GO yield rate of the PEAEC using the ITOT-0.58 and IT-0.25 anodes provided a much better performance than that of the commercial IrO2-Ti-used anode. Among these three catalysts, PEAEC with the IT-0.25 anode showed the best performance."
11,Schematic drawing of IT anode in PEAEC,"3.3 Schematic drawing of IT anode in PEAEC As already described, we compared the OER activity of different catalysts, system impedance and performance of PEAEC used different anodes, which is shown in Table 1 . We found that the IT-0.25 catalyst, with much lower IrOx loading amount, provided the best PEAEC performance, thus we further investigated its detailed nanostructural and valency change based on HRTEM, XPS and XAS measurements for the samples before and after the PEAEC test as well as after the 100-h chronopotentiometry duration test. The HRTEM images are shown in Fig. S5 and based on the outlines of particles, the rough particles size distributions are obtained. The size change of IrOx particle on the IT-0.25 surfaces is not obvious after the 100-h chronopotentiometry test or after the PEAEC test. We also measured the compositional differences of the IT-0.25 based on their diffraction patterns (Fig. S6), and found that the surface nanoparticles were composed of the mixture of the Ir and IrO2 before the test. However, after 100-h chronopotentiometry test, we only observed IrO2, indicating that the Ir was oxidized after the durability test. However, after the PEAEC test, in addition to TiO2, we found that Ir still remained in the sample, which would be considered to contribute to the higher anode conductivity, thus leading to a high PEAEC performance. We also carried out the XPS spectral measurements on these three samples in order to analyze the valence state changes of the surface elements, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . The Ir 4f XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 7a, in which the Ir 4f peaks of the pristine IT-0.25 catalyst are mainly assigned to Ir0. After 100-h chronopotentiometry duration test, it is evident that the main peak position changed from Ir0 to Ir4+. However, after the PEAEC test, the main Ir 4f peaks were still assigned to Ir0, but Ir4+ shoulder peaks were clearly observed, indicating that the Ir was partially oxidized during the PEAEC test. Fig. 7b shows the O1s XPS spectra of three samples. For the pristine IT-0.25 sample, the main O1s peak was only assigned to IrOx. After 100-h chronopotentiometry duration test, IrOx (shoulder) and strong TiOx peaks were observed, suggesting that some IrOx nanoparticles became detached from the Ti mesh, then the TiOx surfaces were exposed on the surfaces after the long time chronopotentiometry duration test. However, for the sample after the PEAEC test, no such O1s peak from the TiOx was observed, indicating that the IrOx nanoparticles are highly durable during the PEAEC test. The XAS measurements were further conducted using these three samples in order to examine the oxidation state change of the Ir in the IT catalyst during the electrochemical processes. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the Ir-LIII edge (probe the electronic transitions from 2p to 5d) was reported to be sensitive to the change in the Ir oxidation states [31-34]. Fig. 8 a shows the normalized XANES spectra at the Ir-LIII edge of these three samples. The absorption energy peak of the pristine IT-0.25 and the sample after the PEAEC test appeared very close in energy levels, which shifted to a slightly higher energy level after 100-h chronopotentiometry duration test. The Fourier transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra are shown in Fig. 8b, from which we can obtain the local structural environments of the Ir element. The peaks that appeared at ~1.6 Å reduced distance represent the Ir-O bond, which were reported to be highly sensitive to the Ir oxidation state [20,32-35]. As seen in Fig. 8b, the Ir-O bond distance of the pristine IT-0.25 was ~1.49 Å, which did not shift after the PEAEC test, while it changed to 1.52 Å after 100-h chronopotentiometry duration test. Both the XANES and EXAFS results indicated that the Ir oxidation state of the IT-0.25 remained after the PEAEC test, but partially changed to the higher valence state after the 100-h duration test. Finally, we present a schematic drawing of a catalytic reaction of PEAFC using the IT catalyst in Fig. 9 , in which the Ti mesh was covered with Ir and IrO2 nanoparticles after the in situ growth process and the Ti mesh, Ir and IrO2 nanoparticles that contacted with each other in the catalyst and formed a three-material system. During the PEAEC processes, the OER reaction, 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−, occurred on the anode side, from which the O2 released, H+ permeated through the electrolyte membrane and e− passed through the external circuit to the cathode side. And simultaneously, the three materials system worked synergistically—the IrO2 on the IT catalyzed OER reaction while the Ir, and Ti acted as good electron conductors, which formed two pathways of electron transfer, thus accelerating the electrochemical processes of PEAEC and leading to a high PEAEC performance."
12,Conclusions,"In this study, we designed and synthesized three different binder-free IrOx-Ti catalysts, IT-0.09, IT-0.16 and IT-0.25, with different IrOx amounts as anodes for the PEAEC by an in situ growth method. The Ir and IrO2 nanoparticles (< 5 nm) coexisted and were uniformly distributed on the surfaces of the catalysts. Despite the very low IrOx loading amount (0.25 mg/cm2), the IT-0.25 catalyst showed a high OER activity in acidic media compared to the commercial IrO2-Ti with the IrOx loading amount of 3 mg/cm2, and the activity was not much different from that of the previously reported ITOT-0.58 catalyst. Besides, the IT-0.25 catalyst also showed a high stability for the 100-h chronopotentiometry duration test in acidic media. When using IT-0.25 as the anode for the PEAEC, the average response current density was 0.636 A cm−2, which was much higher than those of using the commercial IrO2-Ti (0.174 A cm−2) and ITOT-0.58 (0.300 A cm−2) anodes. Such a high PEAEC performance would be due to both the high conductivity and high OER activity of the IT-0.25-based anode. The XPS, HRTEM and XAS measurements revealed the detailed nanostructural and valency change of the catalyst before and after the PEAEC test as well as after the 100-h chronopotentiometry duration test. Such studies have proved that the catalyst is highly durable during the PEAEC test. The high performance of the PEAEC with the IrOx-Ti anode was due to the synergism of the stable three-material system—Ir, IrO2 nanoparticles and Ti support, which showed a high OER activity and provided two pathways of electron transfer during the PEAEC processes (see Fig. 9). Since the presented IT catalysts are easy to synthesize and have high OER and PEAEC performances, this study provides an efficient method for the design of a catalyst with a high energy conversion ability."
