0,Introduction,"Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs, E.C. 1.1.1.1) are oxidoreductases that catalyze the reversible oxidation of a wide range of aliphatic or aromatic alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes or ketones using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) as cofactor [1]. ADHs play a central role in the metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes, and anaerobic fermentation [2]. ADHs are widely distributed in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals [1,3–5], and play important roles in a broad range of physiological processes (e.g. alcohol metabolism, cell defense towards exogenous alcohols and aldehydes) [6], whence these biocatalysts are of great interest for industrial applications [7]. Based on their sequences length, ADHs can be divided into short-chain ADHs, medium-chain ADHs and long-chain ADHs [8]. Short-chain ADHs, which have about 250 amino acid residues are nonmetallic enzymes (e.g. Drosophila ADH) [9]. Most of medium-chain ADHs are zinc-containing enzymes with 250–375 amino acid residues length (e.g. archaeon ADH [10], bacterial ADH [11], yeast ADH [12] and mammalian ADH [4]). They catalyze the interconversion of ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH. Long-chain ADHs have more than 700 amino acid residues [13]. In terms of quaternary structure, the ADHs in higher eukaryotes (plants and mammals) tend to be homodimer, whereas those in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes (yeast) are usually homotetramers. Horse liver ADH (374 amino acid residues) was the first ADH studied by X-ray crystallography in ADH superfamily [1,4,11]. In yeast, structural and mechanical studies of ADHs were mostly focused on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, containing three ADH isoenzymes (ADH1, ADH2 and ADH3) [14]. ADH1 reduced acetaldehyde during fermentation of glucose [12,15], and ADH2 oxidized ethanol in aerobic metabolism [16], while ADH3 located in mitochondria and involved in a redox shuttle for reducing equivalents in NADH [17]. ADH3 from the thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha was also mitochondrial enzymes [18]. However, there are four ADH genes in the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus [19] and Kluyveromyces lactis [20], including two cytoplasmic enzymes (ADH1 and ADH2) and two mitochondrial enzymes (ADH3 and ADH4) [19]. The mitochondrial ADH3 in the thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus might play a crucial role in the control of the NADH/NAD+ balance in mitochondria [21]. Both ADH2 and ADH3 were repressed by high concentration of glucose [22]. ADH3 of Kluyveromyces lactis could be expressed in the presence of low glucose concentrations and respiratory carbon sources other than ethanol, because ethanol acted as a strong repressor of this gene [23]. ADH3 from the thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, which was not the major ADH, displayed substrate specificities with clear preferences for medium-chain length primary alcohols and acetaldehyde, and its gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium [24]. Moreover, due to the function of ADH1, ADH2, ADH3 and the acetyl-CoA synthetase encoding gene (ACS1), the non-conventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica can utilize a wide range of different substrates like glucose, ethanol, acetate, glycerol, proteins and various hydrophobic molecules [25,26]. Pichia pastoris, a methylotrophic yeast, is usually used for harvesting recombinant protein [27,28], and produces small amounts of alcohol as a by-product during fermentation under aerobic conditions [29,30]. However, ethanol production procedure was repressed by high concentration of glucose [31]. Three ADH genes had been annotated from the genomes of Komagataella phaffii GS115, DSMZ 70382 and CBS 7435 strains [32–34]. According to the UniProtKB and Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) search results, the sole mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme III was found in Komagataella phaffii GS115 (ATCC 20864), which belonged to Pichia pastoris and also named Pichia pastoris GS115 [35]. The adh3 gene was the only gene responsible for consumption of ethanol in Komagataella phaffii GS115 [32,36]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mitochondrial ADH3 was involved in the shuttling of mitochondrial NADH to the cytosol under anaerobic conditions and ethanol production [17,37]. To date, the relationship between structure and function of mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme III from Komagataella phaffii GS115 (KpADH3) is still not clear yet. Here, we present the crystal structure of KpADH3 at 1.745 Å resolution, which is the first ADH structure from Komagataella phaffii GS115, and the only dimeric ADH among the structurally studied members of the medium-chain ADH family from yeast described so far. Each monomer of KpADH3 is composed of a catalytic domain and a cofactor binding domain. Structural analysis indicates that KpADH3 is the sole dimeric ADH structure with face-to-face orientation quaternary structure from yeast. The major structural different conformations locate on residues 100–114 and residues 337–344. Residues 100–114 are the structural zinc binding loop and residues 337–344 locate in the loop between α12 and β15, which covers the catalytic domain. In addition, three channels are observed in KpADH3 crystal structure, channel 2 and channel 3 locate in the catalytic domain and may be essential for substrate specific recognition, ingress and egress from the active site to surface, channel 1 situates in cofactor binding domain and may be the pass-through for cofactor."
1,Material and methods,
2,Protein expression and purification,"2.1 Protein expression and purification The yeast Komagataella phaffii GS115 was incubated in YP (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone) liquid medium containing 2% (v/v) glycerol at 30 °C for 72 h. Then the cultures were obtained by centrifugation and the collected cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and disrupted by high pressure cell disruptor (Constant System Ltd.). The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, 10,000 ×g for 30 min, then was mixed with an equal volume of 2.5 M ammonium sulfate solution. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C, 10,000 ×g for 30 min, the crude protein pellets were dissolving into PBS, pH 7.4 added 0.2 g/L NaN3 and then dialyzed for 48 h at 4 °C, then the crude soluble protein was obtained. The dialysis buffer was replaced every 6 h for removing ammonium sulfate completely. The crude soluble protein was applied to a Superdex 75 column (16/60, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4 added 100 mM NaCl. After this step the active fractions were concentrated and buffer exchanged by 10 K, Amicon® Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Units before the concentrations were estimated spectrometerically at OD280 [38]. The purity (higher than 95%) was assessed in denaturing conditions by SDS-PAGE."
3,Nano LC-MS/MS for protein identification,"2.2 Nano LC-MS/MS for protein identification The major visible protein band (~40 kDa) on SDS-PAGE gel was cut out, and the sequence was analyzed by ProtTech Inc. Firstly, the protein band was digested by trypsin at 37 °C overnight. Secondly, the supernatant was collected and subjected to Nano LC-MS/MS. Nano LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using the MASCOT search engine on SwissProt database."
4,Sequences and phylogenetic tree analysis of alcohol dehydrogenases,"2.3 Sequences and phylogenetic tree analysis of alcohol dehydrogenases Multiple alignments, phylogenetic analysis and structural comparison of ADHs were performed using Clustal X 2.1 [39], MEGA 5.2 [40] and DALI server [41], respectively."
5,Enzymatic activity assay and biochemical properties analysis,"2.4 Enzymatic activity assay and biochemical properties analysis At 30 °C, ADH enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm [42]. The reaction mixture for ADH enzyme activity contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 in presence of 7.5 mM NAD+, 3.2% (v/v) ethanol and 100 ng purified soluble protein (KpADH3) or distilled water as control. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of NADH produced per minute [36]. Unless otherwise indicated, the ADH enzyme activity was determined at 30 °C for measuring the absorbance at 340 nm. The optimum temperature was investigated in the range of 20–50 °C with 5 °C intervals. The effects of pH on ADH enzyme activity were examined over the range of pH 4.0–10.0."
6,Protein crystallization,"2.5 Protein crystallization Crystals of KpADH3 were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. KpADH3 (1 μL at 10 mg/mL) was mixed with the precipitant solution (10% (v/v) 2‑propanol, 0.2 M zinc acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate/hydrochloric acid, pH 6.5) on screening plate. The crystals of KpADH3 appeared after 3 days incubation at 16 °C and reached their maximum size 5 days later. Then 3% (v/v) 2‑propanol was added into the protein/precipitant solution mixture as additive, and the crystals of KpADH3 appeared after 5 days incubation at 4 °C and reached their maximum size 10 days later. In order to obtain KpADH3/NAD+ complex crystals, 10 mg/mL KpADH3 and 1 mM NAD+ were mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution (13% (v/v) 2‑propanol, 0.2 M zinc acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate/hydrochloric acid, pH 6.5). And the apo-form crystals of KpADH3 were soaked in the reservoir solution with 1 mM NAD+. The crystals were soaked in the cryoprotectant containing the precipitant solution and 15% (v/v) glycerol before frozen in liquid nitrogen."
7,Data collection and structure determination,"2.6 Data collection and structure determination Diffraction data were collected at 100 K from KpADH3 crystal with an ADSC Q315 CCD detector on beam-line BL17U, SSRF, Shanghai, China. The data set of KpADH3 was indexed with XDS package [43,44] and scaled with Scala [45]. The structure of KpADH3 was solved by molecular replacement using the program Phaser with the Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) alcohol dehydrogenase I (ScADH1) (PDB ID: 4W6Z) as the search model [46]. Auto-model building was performed with Phenix.AutoBuild [47], which was followed by the manual model building performed with Coot [48]. Alongside the manual building process, the refinement was done with Phenix.refine [47], and the quality of KpADH3 structure was checked using MolProbity [49]. The refinement statistics was shown in Table 1 ."
8,Identification of channels in KpADH3 crystal structures,"2.7 Identification of channels in KpADH3 crystal structures In order to explore potential access/egress channels in the static crystal structure, the glycerol molecule in the catalytic domain of KpADH3 was removed and the program CAVER 3.0.1 [50] was used as a plugin in Pymol to calculate channels in KpADH3. Firstly, KpADH3 crystal structure was loaded in Pymol, then the catalytic zinc atom was set as the starting point and the number of channels was set to twenty."

10,Results and discussion,
11,Purification and identification,"3.1 Purification and identification The crude soluble protein was purified by salting-out and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1 ). The elution volume was about 7.5 mL and the corresponding molecular weight was about 80 kDa. Due to the major visible protein band is about 40 kDa on denatured SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1), the soluble protein is apparently dimer existed in solution. Then the major visible protein band (~40 kDa) on SDS-PAGE gel was cut out and digested, and the sequences of protein fragments were assayed by ProtTech Inc. Six fragments were identified, including YSGVCHTDLHAWK, ADLSGFTHDGSFQQYATADATQAAR, EADLAEVAPILCAGITVYK, VLGIDGGADKGEFVKSLGAEVFVDFTK, GSYVGNREDSAEAIDLFTR and VYEQMEAGAIIGR, which had 100% identity to Komagataella phaffii GS115 mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme III (gi|254,568,544) (Fig. 2 ). Nano LC-MS/MS analysis and the MASCOT search result indicated that this protein from Komagataella phaffii GS115 was absolutely KpADH3."
12,Phylogenetic analysis,"3.2 Phylogenetic analysis All the sequences of ADHs identified from yeast were aligned using Clustal X [39] (Fig. 3 ). We performed a phylogenetic tree analysis using a total of 48 unique ADHs from BLASTP result [51]. In ADHs sequence phylogeny, organisms are clustered consistent with genera, such as Kluyveromyces, Cyberlindnera, Wickerhamomyces, Candida, Ogataea and Scheffersomyces (Fig. 3). This phylogenetic analysis result revealed the sequence evolution of ADHs. While KpADH3 shared a low level of identity with other ADHs, which indicated that it was relatively unique."
13,Optimum temperature and effects of pH on enzyme activity,"3.3 Optimum temperature and effects of pH on enzyme activity As mentioned above, the adh3 gene from Komagataella phaffii GS115 was the only gene responsible for consumption of ethanol [32,36]. In situ expressed KpADH3 showed high ADH activity in a temperature range of 30–40 °C with its highest activity at about 35 °C (Fig. 4A). This result revealed that KpADH3 exhibited the optimum temperature, which was higher than the growing temperature. In addition, the optimum ADH activity of KpADH3 occurred at a pH range of 6–8 (Fig. 4B)."
14,Overall and oligomeric structure analysis,"3.4 Overall and oligomeric structure analysis The crystal structure of KpADH3 was solved at 1.745 Å resolution. The KpADH3 polypeptide has 350 amino acid residues. The final model of KpADH3 contains residues Thr4 to Lys350, two zinc atoms, two glycerol molecules and one isopropanol molecule in each subunit. No electron density was observed for the three N-terminal residues. The electron density maps were of high quality for the entire model, and the enzyme exists as dimer (Fig. 1, Fig. 5A). KpADH3 structure has one dimer per unit cell of the P64 symmetry. The asymmetric unit contains two subunits arranged as a face-to-face homodimer connected with α3 region, not a homotetramer formed from back-to-back asymmetric dimers of subunits [46] (Fig. 5A). Like other Zn-dependent ADH, each subunit of KpADH3 was composed of two distinct domains, a catalytic domain and a cofactor binding domain (Fig. 5B). The catalytic domain contained a zinc atom to which the alcohol bound and a structural zinc in a distant loop, and the cofactor binding domain was formed by a Rossmann fold. Alcohol molecule bound in the cleft between the catalytic and cofactor binding domain [52]. The interchain interaction in the dimeric structure was maintained by side chains of several residues (100–114) from the structural zinc binding loop and α3 region in a dimer. As superposition of subunit A and B gave an RMSD value of 0.70 Å, the two subunits displayed slightly different conformations. Subunit A differed somewhat from subunit B on residues 100–114 and residues 337–344. Residues 100–114 were the structural zinc binding loop and residues 337–344 were the loop between α12 and β15, which covered the catalytic domain (Fig. 5C). Although sequence alignments showed low identity between yeast and horse liver ADHs, their three-dimensional conformations were very similar and conserved, such as catalytic residues in the active site, zinc ligands and hydrophobic cores [53]. Most yeast ADH structures are tetramers with four back-to-back subunits [46], but the horse liver ADH structure is a head-to-tail rotational symmetric dimer [54,55]. What is interesting is that KpADH3 is a dimer with two face-to-face subunits in an asymmetric unit. As we known, comparison of protein structures provides information about evolutionary and structure-function relationships [52]. To find out the structural similarities and differences with higher order organisms, the crystal structure of KpADH3 was compared with horse liver ADH (PDB ID: 6ADH) [54] and yeast ADH (PDB ID: 4W6E) [46] which indicated that a similar fold is adopted. Superposition of the first ADH crystal structure from horse liver (PDB ID: 6ADH) [54] (Fig. 5D) and the yeast ADH crystal structure from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDB ID: 4W6E) (Fig. 5E) with KpADH3 gave RMSD values of 2.70 Å and 1.67 Å, respectively, and the catalytic and cofactor binding domains of each KpADH3 subunit were arranged in the open conformation with a glycerol molecule in the substrate binding pocket near the catalytic zinc (Fig. 8A)."
15,Sequence analysis,"3.5 Sequence analysis The sequence of KpADH3 was aligned with alcohol dehydrogenase sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScADH1, 73%), Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsADH, 33%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaADH, 44%) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (htADH, 42%) (Fig. 7). The structure-based sequence alignments of KpADH3, ScADH1, SsADH, PaADH and htADH showed different levels of sequence identities according to their source from different genera. Comparisons of KpADH3 sequence with ScADH1, SsADH, PaADH and htADH sequences enabled identification of key residues which may contribute to catalysis and function, these included active site residues which bound to the catalytic zinc binding residues (Cys46, His69, Glu70 and Cys156) (Fig. 6A), structural zinc binding residues (Cys100, Cys103, Cys106 and Cys114) (Fig. 6B), and cofactor binding residues (His47, Asp204, Lys209, Ser251, Arg263 and Arg343) (Figs. 7 and 8A )."
16,Active site architecture,"3.6 Active site architecture Usually, the catalytic zinc of yeast ADH is fixed by three residues, two cysteine residues and one glutamic acid residue [46], but the glutamic acid residue is replaced by histidine residue in horse liver ADH [54]. The cysteine residue is a ligand to the active site zinc atom and the substitution of cysteine residue mutant may make the alcohol dehydrogenase inactive [56]. The catalytic zinc of KpADH3 is located inside a cleft formed between the catalytic and cofactor binding domain (Fig. 5B). It is worth mentioning that the catalytic zinc is coordinated by four residues, Cys46, His69, Glu70 and Cys156 (Fig. 6A), not the common three residues. The extra His69/Glu70 residue took up the substrate position, and the glycerol molecule was fixed with SG group of Cys156 (Fig. 6A). Thus KpADH3 may have to utilize not quite the same catalytic mechanism. Each subunit of KpADH3 crystal structure contains a glycerol molecule in the catalytic domain, and the glycerol molecule comes from the crystallization solution (Fig. 8A, B). Glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant for KpADH3 crystals, each NADH-free subunit showed the corresponding density for glycerol molecule with its 3-hydroxyl oxygen located within 3.2 Å distance from Cys156 and 3.0 Å distance from the catalytic zinc (Fig. 6A). In addition, the 1‑hydroxyl group of this bound glycerol was in hydrogen bonding interaction with Thr48 (3.0 Å distance). The structural zinc, connected with α2, α3 helix and the nearby loop, is in a tetrahedral coordination by side-chain heteroatoms of four cysteine residues as C4 type of zinc finger (Cys100, Cys103, Cys106 and Cys114) (Fig. 6B). The distance between the structural zinc and SG group of Cys100, Cys103, Cys106, Cys114 is 2.37 Å, 2.29 Å, 2.37 Å, 2.32 Å, respectively. The bottleneck of ADHs in industrial applications is the limited substrate range. Nevertheless, many industrial bioprocesses have relied on wild type yeast strains and traditional mutagenesis methods to obtain stable high-yielding strains [26]. Mutations in the active site of ADHs are useful to expand the small pocket and broaden the substrate specificity [57], and can affect substrate specificity and altered stereoselectivity [58]. Meanwhile, the broader substrate specificity and altered stereoselectivity for ADHs make them useful for asymmetric catalytic reductions and industrial applications [59]. Besides, mutations in the active site of ADHs not only altered their alcohol dehydrogenase activity, but also affected their thermostability [60]. Consequently, combining methods of mutational analysis with in silico substrate docking were developed for accelerating good strains selection and helpful to industrial production [61]."
17,Substrate/cofactor binding pocket and channels analysis,"3.7 Substrate/cofactor binding pocket and channels analysis As previous research, cofactor NAD+/NADH binding can cause the conformational changes in cofactor binding domain [46]. To probe the mechanism of reaction catalyzed by KpADH3, cofactor NAD+ was used to form complex with KpADH3 by co-crystallization and soaking. However, the attempts to crystallize KpADH3/NAD+ complex had proved fruitless, then we tried to model a NAD+ molecule into cofactor binding domain of KpADH3 by LeDock [62]. A pocket in the cofactor binding domain could accommodate NAD+ molecule readily according to the docking result (Fig. 8B). NAD+ molecule associated with cofactor binding domain through hydrogen bonds mainly with hydrophilic amino acid residues (Fig. 8A). The adenine part was sandwiched between residues Asp204 and Lys209 corresponding to Ser249 and Ser251. Lys209 bound the O2B oxygen atom of NAD+ molecule, and the interaction between glycerol and the O2’ oxygen atom of NAD+ molecule was present in KpADH3 (Fig. 8A). The distances from NAD+ to Lys209 or glycerol molecule were both 2.9 Å. The substrate access channels are essential for enzyme activity maintenance [63,64], and the access channels could guide the substrate directly to the position of the active site [65]. The program CAVER 3.0.1 [50] was used to find the most accessible channels, which were essential for substrate specific recognition, ingress and egress from the active site to the surface of the protein. Three channels were observed in KpADH3 crystal structure, channel 1 (colored in red) situated in cofactor binding domain, channel 2 (colored in cyan) and channel 3 (colored in magenta) located in the catalytic domain (Fig. 9 ). As hydrophilic residues located close to access channels and ethanol was water-soluble, these hydrophilic residues may play a significant role in substrate recognition and helping the substrate enter into the active site [66]. Further studies with the determination of substrates and cofactor specificities should be helpful in better understanding the role of KpADH3 in Komagataella phaffii GS115 mitochondrial metabolism."
