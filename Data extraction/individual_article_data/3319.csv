0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production has been the dream of generations of scientists and engineers, and remains the goal of researchers in the 21 st century. That dream may at last be realized with the development of newer semiconductors and suspended photocatalysts [1–5]. In the case of a suspended photocatalyst system, the semiconductor is in the form of tiny particles suspended in a solvent (usually an aqueous solution) [6]. Dynamics of light-induced water cleavage in colloidal systems were investigated by Doughong et al. [7]. A TiO 2 sol was produced via hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide in an aqueous solution. When loaded simultaneously with ultrafine Pt and RuO 2 deposits, these particles displayed extremely high activity as water decomposition catalysts. n- TiO 2 , n- SrTiO 3 and n-CdS have been used as photocatalysts for the photoproduction of hydrogen [8,9]. There have been some attempts to load a semiconductor, such as TiO 2 , with Pt and RuO 2 islands, which act as reduction and oxidation catalysts, respectively. Several aliphatic and aromatic compounds were used as sacrificial agents for the photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous suspensions of Pt/ TiO 2 [10]. A complete mechanism for the evolution of hydrogen from these materials has been discussed. Sakata et al. [11] also used Pt/ TiO 2 along with Pt/CdS for the photocatalytic hydrogen production from lactic acid and achieved high quantum yield using light of λ < 400 nm , whereas the efficiency was low in the visible light. The following reaction was proposed for the decomposition of lactic acid: (1) CH 3 CH ( OH ) COOH ⟶ Pt / TiO 2 H 2 + CO 2 + CH 3 CHO . Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of liquid methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol was investigated [12] using platinized anatase and 366nm UV radiation. Activities and activation energies for carbonyl compound formation were efficiently identical for the four alcohols over 0.5% Pt/ TiO 2 prepared by photodeposition. Activation energy of 20kJ/mol was associated with photoelectron transport through TiO 2 anatase to Pt particles. In the present investigation, the preparation of TiO 2 –loaded photocatalyst was reported and the investigations of the optimum conditions for the highest yield of hydrogen were studied."
1,Experimental,The purest research grade chemicals were used in the present study obtained from FLUKA and SIGMA-ALDRICH companies.
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation The chloride salts of Ru, Pd and Ag were dissolved in water and mixed with TiO 2 anatase to form a slurry in which the chloride salt content is 30%. The slurry was dried at 110 ∘ C and then heated at 500 ∘ C for 2h. The resulting solid mass was ground to obtain fine powder. The particle size of the metal oxide formed was 10–20Åand the resultant photocatalyst particle size of 2– 5 μ m [13]."
3,Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments,"2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments The immersion well photochemical reactor was used for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water or aqueous solutions of organic compounds by using UV energy. The photochemical reactor comprises radiation source, a reactor transparent for the light, a gas product outlet and includes a photocatalyst containing carbon, in addition to a semiconducting photocatalytic material as photocatalyst in the reactor. The products of the process is released from the reactor by the gas product outlet. As the products of the process basically are H 2 and CO 2 , the product is led to a CO 2 absorber (CaO, Ca ( OH ) 2 , NaOH), where CO 2 is separated from the hydrogen. Hydrogen was detected using Bacharach hydrogen detector (USA), and the amount of hydrogen evolved was measured using water manometer. Different experimental operating conditions were studied for obtaining the optimum conditions for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen using titanium dioxide-loaded photocatalyst. These conditions are: photocatalyst type and its concentration, pH, light harvesting material type and its concentration, activated carbon concentration, electron donor material type and its concentration, and the time of photolysis."
4,Results and discussion,"The irradiation of a semiconductor with ultra-bandgap energy results in the promotion of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, with the generation of a hole in the valence band. The photo-excited electrons and holes can then react with aqueous electron acceptor and donor, respectively. The semiconductor catalysis by conduction-band energy has been shown for H 2 O photodecomposition. For example, the E C of rutile is lower than the redox potential of H 2 / H 2 O ( E 0 = - 4.5 eV VAS at pH 0), hence rutile cannot photoreduce H 2 O to H 2 . In an early photoelectrolysis study of H 2 O on the rutile electrode, a 0.2V bias was added to generate H 2 [14]. Because of the quantum size effect, colloidal TiO 2 particles have a higher E C value than the H 2 O / H 2 redox couple. Consequently, no bias is required for H 2 O photodecomposition in the presence of a colloidal TiO 2 suspension. Semiconductors with conduction band edges higher than that of the water reduction potential, such as SrTiO 3 and other ternary titanates, have been reported to generate H 2 via water photoreduction. In the present investigation we used the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds in the production of hydrogen. In this case an organic compound, which may be a pollutant, is used as the sacrificial donor in a reduction half reaction [15,16]. There is no net energy storage (indeed, most of these reactions are endergonic), but hydrogen is produced at the same time as a surplus or even polluting organic compound is oxidized. For example, the reaction (2) CH 3 COOH ( aq ) + O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 is endergonic by 392.3kJ and the fuel value of the H 2 produced is 474kJ. The process involves the conversion of one fuel ( CH 3 COOH , with a fuel value of 866kJ) into another fuel (2 H 2 , with a fuel value of 474kJ). The potential added value is in the destruction of a pollutant. For example, UV light (and also sunlight) is now used to oxidize organic pollutants to CO 2 and H 2 O . It may be possible to modify these processes so that hydrogen would be produced as a byproduct. Fig. 1 demonstrates the photocatalytic reactions occurring on the photocatalyst surface. Under illumination, the excited electrons in the valence band (VB) of the TiO 2 semiconductor transfer to the conduction band (CB) leaving a positive hole ( h + ) . • At the VB, water and/or other organic matters donate electrons to compensate the electron deficiency [17–19]. (3) H 2 O - 2 e = O + 2 H + , (4) C 2 H 5 OH - 2 e = CH 3 CHO + 2 H + , (5) CH 3 OH - 2 e = HCHO + 2 H + . • At the CB, the excited electrons are withdrawn by H + ions with the aid of catalyst ( MO x ) resulting in the evolution of H 2 . (6) 2 H + + 2 e = H 2 . From Figs. 2 and 3 , it is clear that the RuO 2 / TiO 2 is the most efficient photocatalyst and the optimum concentration of RuO 2 / TiO 2 photocatalyst may be 2 g l - 1 . At acidic pH more H + ions would be adsorbed on the semiconductor surface and hence the possibility for reduction of H + to H by e cb - would also be higher (Fig. 4 ). Also, the effect of light harvesting material type and concentration was studied (Figs. 5 and 6 ). TiO 2 anatase was chosen as the most suitable light harvesting material [20]. Also, methanol was chosen as it was found to be the most efficient electron donor (Figs. 7 and 8 ). Fig. 9 indicates that the amount of hydrogen increases by increasing the activated carbon concentration. The role of activated carbon is to increase the surface area of the photocatalyst and its properties and also, activated carbon can enhance the ability of the photocatalyst to make use of wide range of radiation, e.g. sunlight [21,22]. From the results obtained in Figs. 2–10 , it could be concluded that the optimum conditions for the photocatalytic hydrogen production using RuO 2 / TiO 2 photocatalyst ( 2 g l - 1 ) are: 6% methanol, a UV lamp of 125W, activated carbon 1.5% and a pH of 1–3. The results showed that the evolved hydrogen amount increased with the increment of time of photolysis (Fig. 10) [23]."
