0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known as an environment-friendly oxidant, and is one of the most important chemical compounds in industry [1,2]. Recently, H2O2 has received attention as an energy carrier because it is an easily stored and transported liquid fuel possessing even higher energy density (3.0 MJ L−1) than that of compressed hydrogen (2.8 MJ L−1 at 35 MPa) [3,4]. To utilize H2O2 as a renewable energy source, it should be produced in an eco-friendly way. However, the commercial H2O2 production mainly depends on the multi-step anthraquinone oxidation (AQO) process, which generates large amounts of organic waste and CO2 during the hydrogenation/oxidation reaction step and extraction process. In addition, it requires noble metal-based catalysts (Pd, Pd-Au alloys, Ag, etc.) and high-pressure H2, which make the process expensive and potentially dangerous [5,6]. Photocatalytic H2O2-generation methods are promising because H2O2 can be produced by reducing O2 under ambient temperature and pressure without expensive Pd catalysts or high-pressure H2 [7–11]. Additionally, there is no possibility of an explosion due to the H2 and O2, which causes critical safety issues during the traditional synthesis of H2O2. Most of all, this eco-friendly method does not utilize or produce any harmful chemical or CO2. However, the most important problem in photocatalytic H2O2 production is that photocatalysts have a strong tendency to induce the consecutive decomposition of H2O2 on their surfaces, even though a high amount of H2O2 is produced [12]. Thus, many studies have observed saturation in the H2O2 production after a certain time (typically ∼3 h), associated with the self-oxidation of H2O2 at higher concentrations. To restrict this and enhance the photo-efficiency, several strategies have been proposed, such as surface passivation by phosphorous or fluorine [13–15], loading metal nanoparticles (NPs) or graphene [10,16–20], and addition of redox/charge transfer mediators [10,21]. These strategies have been applied on various kinds of semiconductor photocatalysts including graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) [25], MoS2 [20], TiO2 [10], and CdS [19]. For example, Zhou et al. reported a phosphorus-modified hierarchically porous g-C3N4 nanosheet that shows one of the highest H2O2 concentration and production rate (3.25 mM and 1.08 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively), where the phosphorus doping lead the high-yielding two-electron path way to form H2O2 [25]. Song et al. presented atomic-scale Au° modification on MoS2 nanosheets, which significantly enhanced the production of photocatalytic H2O2 (792 μM) owing to the Au-mediated low recombination rate of photogenerated electrons–holes [20]. Moon et al. coupled TiO2 with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a cocatalyst and an electron mediator under UV light irradiation to achieve the production of H2O2 at a millimolar level [10]. Thakur et al. also reported that the incorporation of rGO on CdS resulted in an increase in the H2O2 concentration up to 128 μM by preventing its decomposition [19]. Nevertheless, all of these methods show limited effects in preventing H2O2 decomposition, or rather negligible photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination. In this study, to overcome these major problems, we report the nanocomposite photocatalyst composed of CdS NPs with heteroatom-doped carbonaceous supports, which was prepared by adopting Cd(EDDA) (EDDA2- = 2,2′-(ethylenedithio)diacetate) as the metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor. Cd(EDDA) is a well-ordered crystalline solid composed of coordination bonds between Cd(II) ions and S-based organic ligands. Upon simple annealing, it thermally converted to a composite material in which sulfur-doped carbon is evenly spread around 5 nm-sized CdS nanoparticles. The presence of sulfur-doped carbon can restrict H2O2 decomposition by preventing the approach of H2O2 due to its hydrophobic character (Scheme 1 ) [23,24,26]. The H2O2 concentration accumulated by photocatalytic reaction in the presence of 2-propanol reached 17.1 mM which is the highest value among all the reported photocatalysis systems."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals and solvents used in the syntheses were of reagent grade and they were used without further purification. 2,2′-(Ethylenedithio)diacetic acid (H2EDDA) was bought from TCI, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O from JUNSEI, and commercial CdS from Sigma-Aldrich (product number: 208183)."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Preparation of Cd(EDDA) Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (15 mg, 0.50 mmol) and H2EDDA (11 mg, 0.50 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O (50 mL, 1:1, v/v). The mixture solution was placed in a 250 mL glass reaction vessel and heated at a rate of 1 °C/min and maintained at 80 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, colorless crystals were filtered off and briefly washed with water and ethanol. Yield: ∼85 %. Anal. Calcd for Cd1C6H8O4S2: C, 22.47; H, 2.51; N, 0.00; S, 20.00.

The hydrothermal reaction with a small portion of triethylamine (0.14 mL, 1 mmol) also afforded the synthesis of the same compound in powder form. 2.2.2 Thermal conversion of Cd(EDDA) into M-CdS-xh Solid Cd(EDDA) (300 mg) was heated at 5 °C/min under an oxygen flow of 500 mL/min. After reaching the target temperature of 270 °C, the material was maintained at that temperature for x hr (x = 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, or 24). After cooling to room temperature, dark yellowish solid was obtained. Brown solid M-CdS-10h (70 mg) was heated at 5 °C/min under an argon flow of 200 mL/min (M-CdS-10h-A). After reaching the target temperature of 450 °C, the material was maintained at that temperature for 1 h. The dark brown solid was obtained after cooling to room temperature."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were recorded on a Bruker D2 phaser diffractometer at 30 kV and 10 mA for Cu Kα (λ = 1.54050 Å), with a step size of 0.02° in 2θ. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were measured by a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer. N2 sorption isotherms of samples were obtained using a BELSORP-max at 77 K. Prior to the adsorption measurements, the samples were evacuated (p < 10−5 mbar) at 150 °C for 6 h. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed under N2(g) atmosphere at a scan rate of 5 °C/min using Q50 from TA instruments. Elemental analyses were done by UNIST Central Research Facilities center (UCRF) in Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was acquired on Varian VNMRS 600 instrument at a room temperature (298 K). The 1H NMR spectra was recorded in parts per million (ppm) with DMSO-d6, corresponding to 2.50 ppm. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) data were measured using R-AXIS RAPID II single-crystal X-ray diffractometer, Rigaku, Japan. The contact angles of all the materials were obtained using the Phoenix 300 Model instrument."
5,Photocatalytic production of H2O2,"2.4 Photocatalytic production of H2O2 Photocatalytic activity of the samples for hydrogen peroxide production was evaluated at room temperature and pressure. Photocatalyst powder (25 mg) was placed into a quartz vessel and dispersed in 25 mL of deionized (DI) water or 1 M KOH with a sacrificial agent. The colloidal solution in the reactor was purged with oxygen gas for 30 min to saturate the oxygen in the solution in the dark condition. The performance test of the H2O2 production was carried out with 300 W Xenon lamp with continuous oxygen bubbling. To maintain dispersion, the solution was stirred by magnetic stirrer before and during the reaction. The photocatalyst samples were tested under visible light irradiation with 420 nm cut-off filter. A certain amount of the colloidal solution (0.6 mL for DI water and 0.2 mL for 1 M KOH solution) was with a syringe and filtrated by 0.45 μM PTFE syringe filter (Millex)."
6,Photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2,"2.5 Photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2 Hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity of the samples was tested with 300 W Xenon lamp under visible light (> 420 nm, 100 mW/cm2) intensity with 420 nm cut-off filter with continuous stirring. Photocatalyst powder (25 mg) was placed into a quartz vessel and dispersed in 25 mL of 1 mM H2O2 solution that was made by diluting hydrogen peroxide (35 %, Alfa Aesar) in deionized water. To avoid H2O2 production from oxygen, the reactor was purged with argon for 30 min under dark condition before the decomposition test."
7,Measurement of H2O2 concentration,"2.6 Measurement of H2O2 concentration The concentration of generated H2O2 was measured by DPD method [27]. After the photocatalytic reaction, the colloidal solution (1 mL for 2-propanol solution and 0.2 mL for 1 M KOH solution with 2-propanol) was collected by syringe from the reactor and it was filtrated by 0.45 μM PTFE filter (Millex) to separate H2O2-containing solution from photocatalyst powders. Sodium phosphate buffer (SPB, 0.1 M) was added to properly dilute the sample and then, deionized water was added. N,N,-Diethyl-p-phenylene-diamine sulfate (DPD, ≥ 98 %, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (in 0.1 N sulfuric acid standard solution) and peroxidase (POD, horseradish, Sigma) solution (in deionized water) was used to make vivid color for measuring absorbance of hydrogen peroxide; 0.4 mL of 0.1 M SPB, 1.1 mL DI water, 50 μL DPD, and 50 μL POD were used for 2-propanol solution, and 3 mL of 0.1 M SPB, 50 μL DPD, and 50 μL POD were used for 1 M KOH solution with 2-propanol. The highly accumulated H2O2 solution was further diluted for an accurate measurement. The concentration corresponding its absorbance was automatically calculated by using UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimazu). Standard calibration curves used for quantitation of H2O2 are shown in Fig. S1."
8,Electrochemical analysis,"2.7 Electrochemical analysis The electrocatalytic properties of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were studied using rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE, PINE Research Instrumentation) analysis in O2-saturated 1 M KOH solution (pH 14). A catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of the sample in 1 mL of ethanol containing 50 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution with ultrasonication for more than 30 min. The catalyst ink (10 μL) was then loaded on glassy carbon (GC, geometric area: 0.247 cm2) as the working electrode and dried in an oven at 60 °C. A platinum electrode was used as the counter electrode and Hg/HgO electrode was used as the reference electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted with a scan rate of 10 mV/s from 1.0 to 0.25 V (vs. RHE) at different rotating speeds (400, 900, 1600, and 2500 rpm). The electron transfer number (n) was determined using Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plot: (1) 1 i = 1 i k + 1 0.62 n F D 0 2 / 3 ω 1 / 2 v - 1 / 6 C 0 Where i, ik, n, F, A, D0, ω (= 2πN, N is the linear rotation speed), v, and C0 indicate the measured current, kinetic current, electron transfer number, faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1), diffusion coefficient of O2 in the electrolyte at 298 K (1.43 × 10-5 cm2 s−1), rotation speed (rad s−1), kinematic viscosity of O2 (1.12 × 10-2 cm2 s−1), and concentration of O2 in bulk (8.43 × 10−7 mol cm-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively."
9,Computational details,"2.8 Computational details 2.8.1 Density functional theory calculations The spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the DMol3 program [28,29]. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was applied for exchange-correlation functional [30]. DFT-D2 with the Grimme scheme was used to correct van der Waals interactions [31]. All electrons with relativistic effects were considered for core treatment, while DNP 4.4 level was applied as the basis set. The global orbital cutoff was set to 4.5 Å. For the surface slab models, the Brillouin zone was sampled using the Monkhorst-Pack grid with 1 × 2 × 1 k-points corresponding to the actual spacing of 0.04 Å−1 [32]. For the electronic density of states (DOS) analysis, the k-point sampling was set to 2 × 3 × 1. The conductor-like screening models (COSMO) scheme was applied with a dielectric constant considering the implicit environment of water (i.e., 78.54) [33]. The geometry optimization calculations were performed until satisfactory convergence tolerances of 1 × 10–5 Ha for energy, 0.002 Ha/Å for the maximum force, and 0.005 Å for the maximum displacement were achieved. 2.8.2 Monte Carlo simulations To investigate the adsorption sites and atomic configurations of the H2O2 molecule on the CdS/sulfur-doped carbon nanocomposite, the configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations were employed [34]. A universal forcefield was used to describe the interatomic potentials [35]. Mulliken charges obtained using the results of DFT calculations were assigned to the corresponding atoms. The atom-based summation method was applied for van der Waals interactions, while Ewald & group summation method was applied for electrostatic interactions. The cut-off distance was set to 15.5 Å. In the Monte Carlo simulations, the number of maximum loading steps, production steps, and the number of annealing cycles were 1.0 × 105, 1.0 × 106, and 15, respectively. For the annealing cycle, the maximum temperature at which the cooling process will begin and the final temperature where one annealing cycle will end were set to 500 and 100 K, respectively. Five energetically stable models, wherein the H2O2 molecule was adsorbed on the surface, were extracted. 2.8.3 Computational models For constructing the computational models, zinc-blende CdS was introduced. The energetically stable CdS (110) surface was constructed with a vacuum slab of approximately 20 Å perpendicular to the surface [36]. The lattice parameter of the CdS surface was 17.61 × 12.45 × 28.30 Å3. The carbon or sulfur-doped carbon layer was placed on the CdS surface for the modeling of the CdS/sulfur-doped carbon interface. The carbon layer was composed of 80 sp3 carbon atoms, while the carbon atoms were terminated with hydrogen atoms. The optimized carbon layer was placed onto the optimized CdS surface where the lattice mismatches along x and y directions were 0.4 and 1.7 %, respectively. The sulfur-doped carbon layer was obtained by replacing a carbon/hydrogen pair in the pristine carbon layer with a sulfur atom; one sulfur atom and 79 sp3 carbon atoms composing the entire layer. The adsorption energy of the H2O2 molecule ( E a d s ) was calculated using the following equation: (2) E a d s = E t o t − E s u r f − E H 2 O 2 , where E t o t is the total energy of the slab model including the H2O2 molecule, E s u r f is the energy of each slab model, and E H 2 O 2 is the molecular energy of H2O2."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Preparation of Cd(EDDA) precursor,"3.1 Preparation of Cd(EDDA) precursor The Cd/S-based MOF, Cd(EDDA) can be readily prepared as colorless crystals by the solvothermal reaction of Cd(II) ions and S-containing H2EDDA ligand in a 1:1 (v /v) mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and water. In the single-crystal X-ray crystallographic structure of Cd(EDDA) (Fig. 1 a and Table S1), the Cd(II) center is positioned in an octahedral geometry, forming coordination bonds with two sulfur atoms of the thioethers from one EDDA ligand and four oxygen atoms of the carboxylates from three different EDDA ligands. This repetitive bridged assembly generates 2D sheets, which are stacked in parallel. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the as-synthesized Cd(EDDA) is consistent with the simulated pattern (Fig. 1b), indicating that the entire material has the same structure as the single crystal."
12,Photocatalyst synthesis and characterization,"3.2 Photocatalyst synthesis and characterization Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that Cd(EDDA) is thermally stable up to ca. 300 °C under a flow of O2 (Fig. S2a). The isothermal TGA curves measured at 270 °C showed that Cd(EDDA) was slowly decomposed over 12 h (Fig. S2b). As shown in Fig. 2, crystals of Cd(EDDA) were converted to the integrated solid of CdS NPs and carbonaceous compounds in pseudomorphic manner. Upon thermolysis at 270 °C (500 mL/min of O2 flow), the Cd(EDDA) crystals lost transparency and gradually changed their color over time (dark brown at 6 h, brown at 12 h, and brownish yellow at 24 h, respectively), while maintaining the overall rod-like morphology (Fig. 2 , top). The confocal laser scanning microscopic images were obtained upon excitation at 559 nm, which exhibited red fluorescence evenly distributed throughout the material (Fig. 2, bottom). The red fluorescence is originated from CdS NPs, in which sulfur vacancies replaced by O atoms during thermolysis might be responsible for the emission [37–41] As shown in Fig. 3 a, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis confirms that Cd(EDDA) successfully converted into an integrated solid of CdS NPs, which are consistent with JCPDS no. 10-0454 (typical Hawleyite CdS phase). Hereafter, the converted materials are referred to as M-CdS-xh (M = MOF-derived and x = the heating time). Notably, M-CdS-6h and −8h still show the PXRD peaks of Cd(EDDA), indicating an incomplete transformation into CdS NPs before 10 h. The crystalline sizes of CdS NPs were estimated to be ca. 5.5 nm for all the samples, applying the Debye-Scherrer equation to the (220) reflection, which implies that no severe aggregation occurs during the thermolysis. These series of nanocomposites have similar band-gap energies with commercial CdS (2.41 eV) as 2.42 eV, which is calculated from diffusion reflectance spectra (Fig. 3b). These narrow band gaps allow the samples to photo-catalytically operate under the visible light spectrum. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images also showed similar observation of the size of CdS crystallites (5−10 nm) (Fig. 3c). The distinct lattice fringes in the high-resolution TEM images also indicated that these NPs exhibit the highly crystalline nature of CdS. Elemental analysis revealed that even after the complete conversion, the samples contain the carbonaceous residue, forming CdS NPs/carbon nanocomposites, despite heating under the oxygen atmosphere at high temperature. The carbon amount in M-CdS-xh (x = 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24) gradually reduces from 6.90 to 1.85 wt% on increasing the heating time (Table S2). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area was 60 m2 g−1 and the total pore volume was 0.23 cc g−1, based on the nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiment (Fig. S3). This nanocomposites composed of crystalline CdS NPs and carbons may give rise to high photocatalytic activity because it has been known that the porous nature help reactants rapidly delivered to the reaction interface and the high crystallinity of photocatalysts can suppress the unwanted electron-hole recombination [42–44]."
13,H2O2 production performance of M-CdS-xh photocatalyst,"3.3 H2O2 production performance of M-CdS-xh photocatalyst In order to examine the photocatalytic activity of these CdS/carbon composites having similar morphological and fluorescent properties but different carbon contents, the H2O2 formation capacities of Cd(EDDA), commercial CdS, and six M-CdS-xh samples (where x = 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24) were tested in the presence of 2-propanol under visible light irradiation (detailed experimental methods are provided in Section 2.4). Commercial CdS is the same cubic Hawleyite phase with M-CdS-xh photocatalysts (Fig. S4). As summarized in Fig. 4 a, the Cd(EDDA) sample shows negligible photoactivity; the concentration of H2O2 after 3 h is 0.001 mM (i.e. almost zero) and the commercial CdS shows more higher than Cd(EDDA) sample, 0.55 mM after 3 h. In contrast, a dramatic increase in photocatalytic performance in H2O2 production was observed after 3 h for M-CdS-6h, −8h, −10h, −12h, −16h, and −24h, recorded as 1.82, 2.12, 2.65, 2.42, 1.75, and 1.30 mM, respectively. To further optimize the photocatalytic reaction condition for M-CdS-10h, the effect of both the type and amount of sacrificial agent were verified (Fig. 4b). The highest concentration of H2O2 (2.89 mM) was observed when 2-propanol was used as the sacrificial agent with 20 % of concentration. An excessive amount of 50 % reduced the photocatalytic H2O2 generation efficiency, which can impede the access of the reactants to the surface of the photocatalysts [19]. For photocatalytic H2O2 production, most of the studies utilized an alcohol as a sacrificial agent which should be consumed to produce H2O2 (Table S3). In this study, we also verified that 2-propanol can be selectively oxidized to acetone without observable by-product, evidenced by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR, Fig. S5), which indicates that the photogenerated hole also can be used to synthesize another value-added product by the selective oxidation reaction. Further, the effect of pH on the photocatalytic performance of M-CdS-10h was investigated. Fig. 4c shows a relative H2O2 production performance in solutions of 1 M KOH (pH 14), pure water, and 0.1 M HCl (pH 1). Notably, the amount of photogenerated H2O2 is significantly enhanced with an increase in the pH. In the acidic solution and neutral solution, maximum H2O2 concentration was 0.42 and 2.89 mM, respectively. The concentration of H2O2 (7.12 mM) in 1 M KOH solution was significantly higher than that in acid and neutral condition. Generally, the rate of H2O2 production decreases with an increase in the pH of the solution because the photocatalytic production of H2O2 is governed by proton coupled electron transfer [45]. When we performed the same experiment with TiO2 (Degussa P25), the best performance was recorded in the acidic solution with 0.1 M HCl (Fig. S6). This uncommon phenomenon might be due to the surface passivation effect by CdOx and Cd(OH)x formed in situ from the surface of CdS in a highly basic solution, which can block CdS defect sites that induce radiation-less recombination of charge carriers and enhance the performance of the CdS photocatalyst [46]. This was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the sample isolated from 1 M KOH solution after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S7). The peaks of 405 and 412 eV of the raw sample before the photocatalytic reactions indicate the typical Cd 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 binding energies of CdS (Fig S7a), respectively. These peaks shift 1 eV lower to 404 and 411 eV after the reaction under 1 M KOH solution, wherein the binding energies are consistent with the environments of CdO or Cd(OH)2 [47]. In the O 1s spectrum, a new peak at 530 eV appears after the reaction (Fig. S7b), which is also known to be the binding energy of metal oxides. The selectivity of the products in the ORR is governed by the number of transferred electrons. The two-electron reduction of O2 produces H2O2, while the four-electron ORR results in the formation of water. Thus, to prove the ORR pathway and H2O2 generation of the M-CdS-10h photocatalyst, we measured LSV on a RRDE in an oxygen-dissolved 1 M KOH solution (detailed methods are described in Section 2.7). Fig. 5 a displays the LSV curves at various rotation speeds from 400 to 2500 rpm, where the cathodic current density increased with an increase in the rotation speed owing to the controlled thickness of the diffusion layer. This relationship between the current density and rotation speed can be described based on the K–L equation (Eq. (1)). From the slope of the linearly fitted K–L plot, the overall electron-transfer number (n) is estimated for the ORR. As shown in Fig. 5b, the K–L plots indicate good linearity and evaluate the value of n to be approximately 2.5, which confirms that M-CdS-10h prefer the two-electron ORR pathway to merit the H2O2 production."
14,Revealing the role of sulfur-doped carbon,"3.4 Revealing the role of sulfur-doped carbon Likewise, the carbonaceous support as well as the nanocrystalline CdS are regarded as the main reasons for their high performance: i.e., the enhanced H2O2 production and reduced H2O2 decomposition rate at the same time. To scrutinize their roles, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping and XPS were conducted (Fig. S8 and 6, respectively). EDS mapping for the M-CdS-10h proves well-distributed carbon throughout the material even though it is hardly detectable in the TEM images due to its minute amount. XPS reveals the bonding structures of CdS and carbon further: the Cd 3d 5/2, S 2p, O 1s, and C 1s spectra were deconvoluted as shown in Fig. 6 a-d. It is noteworthy that the Cd 3d 5/2 spectrum reveals the minor presence of cadmium oxide with binding energy of 403.8 eV, where oxygen may come from either the atmosphere or the pre-coordinated EDDA ligand carboxylate groups. In the S 2p spectrum, the peak from cadmium sulfide appears at 161.7 and 160.9 eV [24]. The other four peaks in the S 2p spectra are assigned to organic sulfur (e.g., thiophene-like CSC structure, 162.9 and 164.0 eV; and C-SOx groups (168.5 and 169.5 eV) [48]. In the C 1s spectra, the major peak at 284.8 eV is attributable to organic sp3 carbon. The binding energies of 286.6 and 288.3 eV may represent carbon in many different environments (e.g., CS, COH and COC for 286.6 eV, and SCO, OCO and CO for 288.3 eV). A similar result is observed for the O 1s spectra with the peak at 533.5 and 531.4 eV that commonly represent the organic CO and CO groups. As a result, the XPS data indicate that M-CdS-10h possess polymeric carbon on the surface, which is also supported by the fact that the amount of carbon quantified from the XPS exceeds that observed in the EA (Table S4). As previously denoted, the consecutive decomposition of photogenerated H2O2 causes the saturation phenomenon, thereby resulting in a low efficiency of H2O2 production. It is well-known that the carbon layer on the photocatalyst can suppress re-adsorption of the produced H2O2 by preventing the material from the interaction with H2O2 and its decomposition [22,49]. In our system, the carbonaceous residue imparts the CdS photocatalysts hydrophobic character and steric hinderance to H2O2 such that the H2O2 formation capacities could be significantly enhanced. To prove this, the contact angles of DI water and 35 wt% H2O2 solution were measured to evaluate the surface wettability (i.e., hinderance and hydrophobicity) of the photocatalysts (Fig. 7 ). The contact angles formed on the commercial CdS-based thin film at the intersection of liquid-solid interface for DI water and H2O2 solution were 45.8° and 47.5°, respectively, indicating its highly hydrophilic nature. M-CdS-10h, in contrast, showed an increase in the contact angles for DI water and H2O2 solution (53.7° and 56.5°, respectively), indicating that the surface of this photocatalyst still exhibited a hydrophilic nature, but with lower forces of interaction with water and H2O2. To further improve the hydrophobicity and stability of the M-CdS-10h, we conducted thermolysis on M-CdS-10h because 270 °C of annealing temperature was not sufficient to stabilize the S-doped polymeric carbon. Therefore, M-CdS-10h was annealed at 450 °C under 200 mL/min of Ar flow for 1 h, which resulted in a dark brown solid (hereafter referred to as M-CdS-10h-A, where A implies annealing). Even after the heat treatment, the M-CdS-10h-A material still possess a significant amount of carbon (2.43 % based on EA), while retaining the same CdS phase and similar nano-crystallinity as those of M-CdS-10h, which were confirmed using the PXRD and TEM measurements (Fig. S9). The average crystalline size could be estimated to be ca. 5.9 nm by applying the Debye-Scherrer equation to the (220) reflection, which is similar to that of M-CdS-10h before annealing. As indicated in EDS mapping (Fig. S10), the carbon residue is still well-distributed throughout the CdS NPs without agglomeration. On the contrary, the change in surface carbon properties is clearly visible in the XPS data (Fig. 6e–h). As quantified using XPS (Table S4), the amount of oxygen on the surface significantly changed from 21.0 to 18.0 at% owing to annealing under inert atmosphere, while the proportion of other elements was not affected. In the Cd 3d 5/2 spectrum (Fig. 6e), the main strong signal at 405.1 eV is attributed to cadmium ions in the bulk of CdS. The weaker component at a lower binding energy (404.1 eV) can be assigned to cadmium oxide that existed from M-CdS-10h. Further, the third component at a higher binding energy (406.3 eV) can be assigned to the surface Cd2+ ions bound to the neighbored carbon residue [50]. In the S 2p profile (Fig. 6f), one can observe that the peaks at 169.3 eV, corresponding to the C-SOx groups [48], are significantly weaker in M-CdS-10h-A than that of M-CdS-10h. However, the peaks associated with the thiophene-like CSC structure become stronger (163.1 and 164.2 eV). Further, the C 1s spectrum of M-CdS-10h-A still presents a main peak at 284.0 eV originating from sp3-hybridized carbon, but shows no evident CO (or CS) peaks. Comprehensively, using the XPS results, it can be concluded that after the annealing treatment of M-CdS-10h, the sulfur atoms in the form of CSC become more dominant in the carbon residue. Accordingly, the water and H2O2 solution contact angles on M-CdS-10h-A (62.5° and 66.9°, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7) represent even larger values than those on M-CdS-10h, verifying a more hydrophobic nature of the carbonaceous residue. In addition, photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition experiments were conducted on the three aforementioned samples to further identify the effect of the hydrophobic carbonaceous residue. As shown in Fig. 8 a, 47 % of the initial amount of H2O2 is degraded by commercial CdS after 1 h (i.e., decomposition rate, 0.47 h−1). M-CdS-10h-A exhibits the lowest degradation rate (0.081 h−1) in the same period, while M-CdS-10h presented a degradation rate of 0.20 h−1. The drastic reduction in the H2O2 decomposition rate from commercial CdS to M-CdS-10h and M-CdS-10h-A implies that the carbon residue surrounding the CdS NPs is inhibiting the adsorption and degradation of H2O2. We further evaluated the H2O2 production kinetics of these three samples separately by fitting the photocatalytic H2O2 production and decomposition data to the equation of [H2O2] = (k f/k d), where k f and k d are the rate constants for H2O2 formation and decomposition, respectively. We assumed that the formation rate is determined by zero-order kinetics because the reaction solution is continuously purged with O2, and the decomposition rate by the first-order kinetics. The resultant k f and k d values are presented in Fig. 8b for commercial CdS, M-CdS-10h, and M-CdS-10h-A. The k f was the slowest, while the k d was the fastest for bare commercial CdS (5.8 μM/min and 0.0078 min-1, respectively), which justifies the lowest H2O2 production efficiency among the listed samples. Between M-CdS-10h and M-CdS-10h-A, surface modification by the annealing treatment not only decreased k f drastically (from 21.9 to 7.1 μM/min) but also decreased k d values significantly (from 0.0034 to 0.0014 min−1). This kinetic analysis clearly indicates that the relatively lower, but more steady formation of H2O2 in the heat-treated M-CdS-10h-A, was attributed to the reduced formation but highly inhibited decomposition of H2O2 as compared to that of M-CdS-10h. One of the key reasons for the reduced k f of M-CdS-10h-A is that the carbonization at a high temperature under Ar atmosphere results in an increase in absorbance by the S-doped polymeric carbon, which retards the light absorption of CdS photocatalyst (Fig S11). To further investigate the role of carbon and S doping, we conducted DFT calculations. As a molecular modeling system, the sp3-type carbon layer was placed on the CdS (110) surface with the presence or absence of a sulfur dopant and compared with the bare CdS structure (Fig. S12). Firstly, we found that the adsorption energy of the H2O2 molecule on the CdS surface reduced significantly in the presence of the carbon, and it further decreased on the sulfur-doped carbon layer (Fig. 9 a and S13). This result showed that the adsorption of H2O2 molecule on the carbon or sulfur-doped carbon layer was not thermodynamically favored as compared to that on the CdS surface. Thus, the decomposition of H2O2 molecule could be reduced. Additionally, in the DOS analysis, it was observed that the electron-occupied states of the carbon layer containing no S dopant were partially located in the bandgap of CdS (Fig. 9b, middle), which would take the photogenerated holes from the excited CdS and inhibit the reduction of the O2 molecule. On the contrary, in the S-doped system (Fig. 9b, bottom), the band structure of the CdS surface shifted positively to be in line with the valence band edge of the (S-doped) carbon layer. This indicates that there is a charge transfer between the sulfur-doped carbon layer and CdS surface (i.e., local charge polarization at the interface), as presented in Table S5. That is, the ORR would not be suppressed upon the introduction of the sulfur dopant to the carbon layer unlike in the case of the pristine carbon layer. In summary, the simulation results clearly showed that S-doped carbon can effectively prevent the decomposition of photogenerated H2O2 without interfering with the production and transfer of charge carriers, thereby increasing the performance of photocatalysts."
15,Stability of M-CdS−10 h and M-CdS−10 h-A,"3.5 Stability of M-CdS−10 h and M-CdS−10 h-A To verify the stabilities of M-CdS-10h and M-CdS-10h-A, we investigated the recyclability of the photocatalysts. Here, the sample was reused and the photocatalytic test of H2O2 production was repeated for up to five cycles under the same conditions (Fig. 10 a; each cycle was run for 3 h). Notably, M-CdS-10h showed a drastic decrease in performance during the five cycles. However, M-CdS-10h-A still maintained high photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production after the five cycles. Furthermore, PXRD and XPS demonstrate that M-CdS-10h-A is partially oxidized, but mainly retains its phase and surface properties of the photocatalyst after the photocatalytic cycling reactions, as shown in Figs. S14 and S15. These results indicate that the additional annealing process can further stabilize the S-doped polymeric carbon that protects the CdS surface, as indicated previously. To verify the saturated H2O2 concentration for the commercial CdS, M-CdS-10h, and M-CdS-10h-A samples, we extended the reaction time to 24 h in 1 M KOH solution with 20 % of 2-propanol (Fig. 10b). The H2O2 concentration using commercial CdS was 1.18 mM. However, the H2O2 concentration of M-CdS-10h was 17.1 mM, which is 9.3 times higher than that of commercial CdS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accumulated H2O2 concentration among all the reported photocatalytic systems (Table S3). This amount is high enough to be directly applied to bleaching and acid water treatment [6,51,52]. The H2O2 concentration for M-CdS-10h-A (11.6 mM) is slightly lower than that for M-CdS-10h. However, it showed higher stability than M-CdS-10h upon additional annealing process as seen in the recycling test (Fig. 10a). This result is also supported by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, which shows the lower content of dissolved CdS for M-CdS-10h-A (1.24 wt%) as compared to that for M-CdS-10h (3.51 wt%). PXRD results show that similar peak intensities of CdS before and after the reaction were observed for both samples, because additional CdOx forms on the surface of CdS deter the drastic collapse of CdS crystal (Fig. S16)."
16,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we successfully fabricated CdS/sulfur doped-carbon nanocomposites by simple annealing of Cd(EDDA) MOF containing Cd, S, and carbon sources. This nanocomposite photocatalyst (M-CdS-10h) showed an H2O2 concentration of 17.1 mM under visible light irradiation in 1 M KOH with 20 % of 2-propanol, which is the highest concentration among reported photocatalysts. The presence of sulfur-doped carbon residue appears to prevent the adsorption and decomposition of H2O2, which is verified by the contact angle measurement and H2O2 decomposition experiment followed by theoretical calculations. Using MOF as a precursor and fine-tuning the conversion conditions, the optimum amount of sulfur-doped carbon was uniformly and intimately distributed throughout the CdS nanocrystals, which could suppress the reverse decomposition of photogenerated H2O2 without disturbing the photocatalytic reaction itself. Thus, we believe that the expansion of this simple method to other types of materials has enormous potential in developing higher-performing photocatalyst systems for H2O2 production."
