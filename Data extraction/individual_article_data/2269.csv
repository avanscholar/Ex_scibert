0,Introduction,"A carbon–neutral energy economy may be realized if the emitted CO2 can be efficiently utilized as carbon feed-stock to produce CO2-based fuels or energy carriers such as alcohols, hydrocarbons and formic acid (FA) [1-6]. Among them, FA is an attractive non-toxic chemical, widely applied in leather tanning, animal feed additives, and silage preservation, as well as in hydrogen storage [7,8]. CO2 hydrogenation into FA can proceed in aqueous phase (ΔG = −4 kJ mol−1) [9] and further be promoted with the addition of bases to produce formate [3,6,10]. Although homogeneous catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation into formate using Ir-, Ru-, and Rh-based catalysts has exhibited high activities [11-13]. The cost and tedious separation steps for catalyst recycling limit the applicability. Thus, the exploration of efficient heterogeneous catalysts with high activity and good stability has aroused considerable interests. Among various heterogeneous catalysts, Pd-based catalysts are most promising, generally with one or two orders of magnitude higher activities than other metal-based catalysts [14-27]. The first reported heterogeneous Pd-based catalyst was Pd black, dating back to a century ago [17]. Subsequently, a long silent period appeared until more efficient supported Pd catalysts using carbon-based supports such as carbon, active carbon, and carbon nitride were developed recently [18-21]. Additionally, metal oxide, in view of their versatile redox/acid-base properties and high stability, also exhibits great potential. For instance, our previous results clearly revealed that the nature of metal oxide support significantly affects the CO2 activation and subsequently reaction mechanism, resulting in the difference of catalytic performance [24]. For metal oxide supported Pd catalysts, the support, especially its basicity, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation into FA/formate [24-27]. By varying the crystal-phase/crystal-plane structures of metal oxide supports, the density and strength of basic sites can be tuned, which is beneficial to the catalytic activity of these catalysts [25-27]. Meanwhile, the metal-support interactions (MSIs) are also modified due to the variations of defective structure and density of metal oxide support, which can affect both the metal structures and the catalytic performance of these catalysts, particularly the stability [27-31]. TiO2, owning versatile crystal-phase and crystal-plane structures, has been widely used as support for CO2 hydrogenation reactions [22,24,30]. For instance, Mori et al. reported a TiO2 supported PdAg alloy nanoparticles that can efficiently promote formate production from CO2 hydrogenation under mild reaction conditions (2.0 MPa and 373 K) [22]. Previously reported results exhibited that the basicity of anatase TiO2 surface is stronger than that of rutile TiO2 surface [32]. Therefore, we employed anatase TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) predominantly exposing {100}, {101}, and {001} facets to support Pd as the catalysts for the tests of CO2 hydrogenation into formate and found that Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst exhibits pronounced promotion in both catalytic activity and stability compared to those of Pd/TiO2{101}, Pd/TiO2{001} and previously reported Pd/TiO2-P25 catalysts. The combined microscopy and spectroscopy results demonstrate that higher density of moderate basic site and relatively more metallic Pd species respectively contributing to the activations of CO2 and H2, and higher oxygen vacancy concentrations in the TiO2 NCs contributing to the enhancement of the MSIs, are responsible for the high activity and stability of Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst, respectively."
1,Experimental section,"All the chemicals and reagents, including TiCl4, (NH4)2SO4, NH4Cl, Ti(OBu)4, NaOH, HCl, PdCl2, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, NH3·H2O, HF, iPrOH, and absolute ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. and used without further purification. Commercial TiO2-P25 support was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd and used without further purification. Reaction gases, including H2 (99.999%), CO2 (99.999%), CO (99.999%), N2 (99.999%), 5% H2/N2, and 10% CO/N2 were purchased from Nanjing Shangyuan Industrial Factory and used without further purification. Deionized water with a resistance no less than 18.5 MΩ was used."
2,Catalyst preparations,"2.1 Catalyst preparations Synthesis of anatase TiO2{100} and TiO2{101} NCs: Anatase TiO2{100} and TiO2{101} NCs were prepared according to Liu et al.’s procedure [33]. Typically, TiCl4 salt solution (6.6 mL) was added dropwise into 0.4 M HCl aqueous solution (20 mL) at 273 K. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was added dropwise into 5.5 wt% NH3 aqueous solution (50 mL) at room temperature (RT). Then the pH value was adjusted to 6–7 using 4 wt% NH3 aqueous solution, after which the system was stirred at RT for additional 2 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water until no residual Cl- was detected using AgNO3 aqueous solution. The precipitated was finally dried at 343 K for 12 h to acquire Ti(OH)4 powders. In the preparation of TiO2{100} NCs, as-prepared Ti(OH)4 (2 g) and (NH4)2SO4 (0.5 g) were dispersed in a mixture of deionized water (15 mL) and iPrOH (15 mL) under stirring at RT. Next, the suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) and kept at 453 K for 24 h. The resulting white precipitate was collected and washed repeatedly with deionized water. The preparation process of TiO2{101} NCs is similar to that of TiO2{100} NCs and the only difference is that NH4Cl (0.2 g) was used to replace (NH4)2SO4 (0.5 g) in the initial suspension. Synthesis of anatase TiO2{001} NCs: Anatase TiO2{001} NCs were prepared according to Han et al.’s procedure [34]. Typically, Ti(OBu)4 (25 mL) and 40 wt% HF (3 mL) were mixed under stirring at RT. The mixture was then transferred into a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) and kept at 453 K for 24 h. The resulting white precipitate were collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with absolute ethanol and deionized water for several times, and finally dried at 343 K for 24 h. The acquired powder was subsequently dispersed in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution (700 mL), stirred at RT for 24 h, subsequently, further centrifuged, and washed repeatedly with deionized water until the pH value reaching 7–8. Synthesis of Pd/TiO2 catalysts: Pd/TiO2 catalysts were prepared via a deposition–precipitation method. Typically, as-prepared TiO2 NCs (300 mg) were ultrasonically dispersed in deionized water (100 mL) and then the suspension was heated to 323 K under continuous stirring. The PdCl2 aqueous solution with a certain content was subsequently added into the suspension and the pH value was adjusted to 10 by the addition of 1 M Na2CO3 aqueous solution. The mixture was stirred at 323 K for additional 3 h and the resulting precipitation was collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times, and then dried at 343 K for 12 h. Finally, the acquired powder was calcined in a muffle oven at 623 K for 2 h, afterwards, reduced in 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 473 K for 1 h to prepare Pd/TiO2 catalysts. The Pd loading was adjusted by changing the added amount of PdCl2 aqueous solution."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations Specific Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of various TiO2 NCs and representative 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts were measured on a Beckman Coulter SA3100 surface area analyzer. Prior to measurements, the catalyst was degassed at 423 K for 5 h. The Pd loadings in the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts were determined by an Optima 7300DV inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of various TiO2 NCs and Pd/TiO2 catalysts were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a nickel-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation source operated with an operation voltage of 40 kV and an operation current of 50 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of various TiO2 NCs were conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα (hν = 1486.7 eV) excitation source. The likely charging of samples was corrected by fixing the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C1s) to 284.8 eV. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of various TiO2 NCs were recorded at 140 K on a JEOL JESFA200 ESR spectrometer (9.087 GHz) at a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a microwave power of 0.998 mW, and a modulation amplitude of 0.35 mT. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of various TiO2 NCs and representative 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts were acquired on a JEM-2100F high resolution transmission electron microscope. The average size and particle shape of the Pd NPs were counted by more than 200 particles in TEM images. XPS without exposure to air of the representative 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts were recorded on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a reaction chamber, using a monochromatic Al anode Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) as the excitation source. The likely charging of samples was corrected by fixing the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C1s) to 284.8 eV. Prior to the measurements, the unreduced catalyst was pretreated by 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 473 K for 1 h in the reaction chamber to acquire the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst and then cooled down to RT naturally, followed by directly transferring to analysis chamber for XPS measurement without exposure to air. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO chemisorption, and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments were conducted on a Belcat II apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Typical in the H2-TPR experiments, 50 mg of TiO2 support or unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst was loaded in a U-shape quartz microreactor and then heated at an increasing rate of 5 °C min−1 under 5% H2/N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. A trap containing zeolite was used to move water from the stream prior to TCD. The H2 consumption was recorded by the TCD detector. In the CO chemisorption experiments, 50 mg of unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst was loaded in a U-shape quartz microreactor and then in situ pretreated by 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 473 K for 1 h to acquire the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst. Next, the catalyst was purged in high-pure He with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 473 K for additional 1 h and then was cooled down to RT. The catalyst was exposed to a mixture of 5% CO/He with at least 20 pulses till no CO adsorption was observed. In the CO2-TPD experiments, 100 mg of TiO2 support or unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst was loaded in a U-shape quartz microreactor and then in situ pretreated by 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 473 K for 1 h to acquire the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst (this process is unnecessary for TiO2 support). Next, the catalyst was purged in high-pure He with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 473 K for additional 1 h. Afterwards, the catalyst was cooled down to RT naturally and then exposed in high-pure CO2 (30 mL min−1) at RT for 1 h, subsequently, purged by high-pure He (30 mL min−1) at RT for 1 h again. Finally, the catalyst was heated at a rate of 5 K min−1 in high-pure He with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 and the CO2 desorption signal was recorded by the TCD detector. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were performed on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an in situ low-temperature and vacuum DRIFTS reaction cell (Harrick Scientific Products, Inc.) in series mode with 256 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1 with an MCT/A detector. Prior to the measurements, 50 mg of unreduced catalyst was in situ pretreated by 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 473 K for 1 h and then purged with high-pure N2 at 473 K for additional 30 min to acquire the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst. For in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption experiments at 123 K, 50 mg of as-prepared TiO2 NCs was loaded on the sample stage of the reaction cell. The reaction cell was degassed to a base pressure of 0.01 Pa and then cooled down to 123 K using liquid nitrogen, whose spectra was taken as the background spectra. High-pure CO was then admitted into the reaction cell. The DRIFTS spectra was recorded at a chemisorption pressure of 200 Pa. For in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption experiments at RT, the in situ reduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst was purged in high-pure N2 (30 mL min−1) at RT for 30 min, whose spectra was taken as the background spectra. Then 10% CO/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 was introduced to the reaction cell for 30 min till to saturation and the spectra was recorded. For in situ time-resolved DRIFTS spectra of H2 or CO2 adsorption experiments, the in situ reduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalyst was purged in high-pure N2 (30 mL min−1) at 313 K for 30 min, whose spectra was taken as the background spectra. Subsequently, the catalyst was exposed to H2 or CO2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 313 K. The spectra were serially recorded in the presence of H2 or CO2 for 30 min. After CO2 activation for 30 min, the steady spectra was taken as the background spectra. Then, the H2 was introduced in the presence of CO2 (CO2:H2 = 1:1) with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 and The spectra were recorded for different times at 313 K. For in situ time-resolved DRIFTS spectra of CO2 hydrogenation experiments, the spectrum in high-pure N2 (30 mL min−1) at 313 K was recorded as the background. Subsequently, the catalysts were exposed to a mixture of CO2 and H2 (CO2:H2 = 1:1) with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 313 K. The spectra were serially recorded in the presence of CO2 and H2 for 30 min. These DRIFTS spectra were obtained directly from the IR instrument with an automatic Kubelka Munk transformation and used without further treatments."
4,Catalytic performance evaluations,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluations The CO2 hydrogenation into formate experiments were conducted in an autoclave. The reaction conditions contain 5 mg of the Pd/TiO2 catalyst, 2 mL ultra-pure water, 168 mg NaHCO3, 1 MPa H2 and 1 MPa CO2. The reaction was conducted at 313 K for 1 h. The products were systematically analyzed by a combination of the gas chromatography for detecting gas products such as CO and CH4, the 1H NMR spectroscopy for detecting liquid products such as CH3OH and formate, and the anion chromatography, a more sensitive method for detecting formate. The results show that only formate was observed in both the 1H NMR spectroscopy and the anion chromatography. The formate content was quantified via a standard curve plotted according to the measured areas of formate by the anion chromatography as a function of added formate concentrations. The turnover frequency (TOF) value of production rate of formate (molformate molsurf. Pd h−1) was calculated using the following equation: TOF = Mol Formate Pd Surf . ∗ T = Mol Formate Pd total ∗ D i s p e r s i o n ∗ T Where MolFormate refers to moles of formate production, Pdsurf. and Pdtotal refer to moles of surface and total Pd atoms, respectively. T refers to reaction time. Dispersion refers to Pd dispersion that is determined by CO chemisorption. The apparent activation energies (Ea) of the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts were derived from the Arrhenius plots. All CO2 conversions were controlled below 15% without the thermodynamic equilibrium and mass transfer limitations. The experiments were conducted using the same procedures to the activity measurement but under different reaction temperatures. The activity evaluation for each sample was conducted for 3 times to acquire an average value in order to eliminate experimental uncertainty. Reaction orders of H2, CO2, and NaHCO3 of the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts were conducted using the same procedures to the activity measurement. The reaction order of H2 was acquired by fixing the NaHCO3 mass of 168 mg and the CO2 pressure of 1 MPa but changing the H2 pressure from 0.5 to 2 MPa. The reaction order of CO2 was acquired by fixing the H2 pressure of 1 MPa and the NaHCO3 mass of 168 mg but changing the CO2 pressure from 0.75 to 1.25 MPa. The reaction order of NaHCO3 was acquired by fixing the H2 pressure of 1 MPa and the CO2 pressure of 1 MPa but changing the NaHCO3 mass from 16.8 to 67.2 mg. All CO2 conversions were controlled below 15% without the thermodynamic equilibrium and mass transfer limitations. Also, the experimental uncertainty is eliminated by conducting the activity evaluation for each sample for 3 times to acquire an average value. The successive reaction round experiments were conducted using the same procedures to the activity measurement. The catalysts after reaction were washed by deionized water and dried in vacuum at RT for the next batch use."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural characterizations of the catalysts,"3.1 Structural characterizations of the catalysts Hydrothermal procedures were developed to prepare anatase TiO2{100}, TiO2{101}, and TiO2{001} NCs with uniform morphologies (Fig. 1 A-C) [33,34]. According to Wulff’s rules [35], anatase TiO2{100}, TiO2{101}, and TiO2{001} NCs predominantly expose {100}, {101}, and {001} crystal planes, respectively, on which the factions of the dominant facets are around 80–100% (Fig. S1- Fig. S3), agreeing with previous results [29-31]. The measured BET specific surface areas of three TiO2 NCs are very close, with values of around 100 m2 g−1 (Table S1). The XRD patterns (Fig. S4A) and Ti 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S4B) confirm that both the bulk and the surface of these crystals are TiO2. The surface structures of various TiO2 NCs were probed by in situ DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption at 123 K (Fig. 1D), in which three vibrational bands centered at 2125, 2178, and 2212 cm−1 were observed, assignable to 13CO adsorbed at Ti5c sites, CO adsorbed at Ti5c sites and defective Ti4c sites, respectively [29,36]. Similar to previous results [36], the peak intensity of CO adsorption on defective Ti4c sites follows an order of TiO2{101} > TiO2 {100} ≫ TiO2{001}, indicating a higher density of defective sites on the TiO2{101} and TiO2{100} surfaces than on TiO2{001} surface. It has been reported that the surface composition and structure of the TiO2 NCs strongly affect the formation of surface carbonaceous species [36], in which the bidentate carbonate species is characteristic for TiO2{001}, the formate species is characteristic for TiO2{100} and TiO2{101}, and the monodentate carbonate is characteristic for TiO2{101}. In our case, the carbonaceous species observed on the TiO2 NCs during CO chemisorption (Fig. S5) matches well with previously reported results [36], further confirming the {100}, {101}, and {001} crystal planes predominantly exposed on various TiO2 NCs. The defect structures of the TiO2 NCs are precisely characterized by EPR spectroscopy that is a more defect-sensitive technique (Fig. 1E). Both the features of g = 2.002–2.008 arising from oxygen vacancy with one electron (F1+ color center) located in the subsurface or bulk regions of TiO2 and g = 2.015–2.025 arising from the O2 – species formed by the adsorption of O2 on F1+ color centers at the TiO2 surface were observed for three TiO2 NCs while the peak intensities of total F1+ color center and O2 – species on TiO2{100} and TiO2{101} NCs are relatively higher than those on TiO2{001} NCs [30,37,38]. Additionally, two weak features of g = 1.972 and g = 1.984 respectively arising from the surface Ti3+ species and bulk Ti3+ species are absent on TiO2{001} NCs [30,37,38]. These results clearly demonstrate that both bulk and surface oxygen vacancy concentrations in the TiO2{100} and TiO2{101} NCs are higher than those in the TiO2{001} NCs. A series of TiO2 supported Pd catalysts (Pd/TiO2) were prepared via a precipitation-deposition method. The Pd loadings determined by ICP-AES are very close to the nominal values (Table S1), indicating the Pd species were completely deposited on the TiO2 supports. The XRD patterns of various Pd/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. S6) only present the reflection characteristic for anatase TiO2, indicating the bulk structure of original TiO2 NCs maintained during catalyst preparation and the formation of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on these catalysts. Corresponding Ti 2p XPS spectra of all Pd/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. S7) are similar to corresponding fresh TiO2 NCs (Fig. S4B), demonstrating that the praparation process of Pd/TiO2 catalysts seldom affects the surface structure of TiO2. TEM images of the representative 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts reveal that the original TiO2 morphologies can be remained well after Pd loading (Fig. 2 A1-C1 and Fig. S8). These clearly reveal that both the surface and bulk structures of original TiO2 NCs do not change during preparation process of the Pd/TiO2 catalysts, as the reported results in literature [29-31,39]. Pd is clearly identified in the enlarged TEM images (Fig. 2 A2-C2), with size distributions of 3.6 ± 0.9, 4.0 ± 0.9, and 4.0 ± 1.1 nm for 2%Pd/TiO2{100}, 2%Pd/TiO2{101}, and 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalysts, respectively (Fig. 2 A4-C4). Their corresponding HRTEM images present an additional lattice fringe of 0.22 nm (Fig. 2 A3-C3, labeled in yellow circle), corresponding to the spacing of Pd{111} crystal plane. This indicates metallic Pd species formed on these catalysts. Subsequently, the Pd dispersion is determined by CO chemisorption, which are 23.5%, 22.4%, and 41.9% for the 2%Pd/TiO2{100}, 2%Pd/TiO2{101}, and 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalysts, respectively (Fig. S9). Different from the similar Pd particle sizes observed in TEM images (Fig. 2 A4-C4), 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst shows a higher Pd dispersion than 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts, which could be due to the ignored shapes and/or the likely very fine Pd particle identified difficultly in TEM images."
7,Reaction performance of the catalysts,"3.2 Reaction performance of the catalysts As-synthesized Pd/TiO2 catalysts were evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation into formate. The production rate of formate based on the total amount of Pd atoms presents a volcano-type variation tendency, in which the best activity was achieved at the Pd loading of 2% (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the catalytic activity is strongly dependent on the TiO2 morphology, following an order of Pd/TiO2{100} > Pd/TiO2{101} > Pd/TiO2{001}. Normalized by the surface Pd atoms based on the Pd dispersion determined by CO chemisorption (Fig. S9), 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst exhibits a production rate of formate as high as 1369 molformate molsurf. Pd h−1, which is higher than 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalyst (1034 molformate molsurf. Pd h−1) and ca. 2–4 times higher than 2%Pd/TiO2{001} (323 molformate molsurf. Pd h−1) and 2%Pd/TiO2-P25 (633 molformate molsurf. Pd h−1) catalysts (Fig. 3B and Fig. S10). To the best of our knowledge, such a high production rate of formate on 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst is peerless for heterogeneous catalysts under similar reaction conditions (Table S2). Especially, the catalytic activity is almost unchanged after 6 rounds of CO2 hydrogenation reaction for the 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts, but not for the 2%Pd/TiO2{001} and 2%Pd/TiO2-P25 catalysts (Fig. 3C and Fig. S10), indicating that the former two catalysts are more structurally stable. ICP-AES measurements show that no Pd species was detected in the liquid collected after the reaction, indicating no any leaching of Pd species during the reaction. These results identify anatase TiO2 NCs predominantly exposing {100} facets supported Pd as a highly active and stable Pd/TiO2 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation into formate, and demonstrate the oxide morphology engineering as a powerful strategy for developing improved heterogeneous catalysts [40-42]. The apparent activation energies (Ea) of the representative 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into formate were derived from the Arrhenius plots by controlling the CO2 conversion no > 15% and the stirring rate higher than 800 r/min that is confirmed to eliminate the thermodynamic equilibrium and mass transfer limitations (Fig. S11) [24-27]. The calculated Ea value of the 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst (ca. 13.0 kJ mol−1) is lower than those of the 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (ca. 15.9 kJ mol−1) and 2%Pd/TiO2{001} (ca. 22.2 kJ mol−1) catalysts (Fig. 3D and Fig. S12), further confirming that 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst is more intrinsically active. Corresponding kinetic investigations were conducted. The reaction order of H2 (Fig. 3E and Fig. S13) is different, following an order of 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (ca. 0.57) > 2%Pd/TiO2{100} (ca. 0.50) > 2%Pd/TiO2{001} (ca. 0.28), whereas that of CO2 (Fig. S14) presents a similar value, close to zero order. This suggests that the involvement of the direct CO2 activation is the minor pathway for the catalytic reaction, consistent with the reported results on PdAg/TiO2 catalyst [22]. Previous literature showed that the bicarbonate species could be the true precursor of formate formation from CO2 hydrogenation [22,24,25,27], thus the reaction order of NaHCO3 was subsequently investigated. It was found that the reaction order of NaHCO3 (Fig. 3F and Fig. S15) is distinctly different with an order of 2%Pd/TiO2{001} (ca. 0.93) > 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (ca. 0.56) > 2%Pd/TiO2{100} (ca. 0.44), which is consistent with their catalytic activity order in CO2 hydrogenation. These perfectly demonstrate that the present catalytic system mainly proceeds via the reduction of bicarbonate species transformed from gaseous CO2 under basic aqueous solutions. Moreover, the reaction orders of H2 becoming around and lower than 0.5 suggest homolytic dissociation of H2 on the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts, which has been proposed in previously reported literature [43,44]. The adsorption and activation behaviors of H2 and CO2 are closely relevant to the electronic structure of Pd and the support basicity, respectively [24-27]. Therefore, detailed investigations on these characteristics of the Pd/TiO2 catalysts were further conducted."
8,The investigation of active structure,"3.3 The investigation of active structure The electronic structure of Pd in the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts was probed by in situ DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption at RT and Pd 3d XPS spectra without exposure to air (Fig. 4 ). In the in situ DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption at RT (Fig. 4A), besides the vibrational features of gaseous CO (COgas), similar vibrational features giving five peaks at 2075, 2039, 1966, 1905, and 1845 cm−1 were observed on the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts, which are commonly assigned to CO linearly bonded to Pd(111) facets, CO linearly bonded to Pd NP edges/corners, µ2 bridge-bonded CO on the Pd NPs edges/corners, µ2 bridge-bonded CO on Pd(111) facets, and CO bonded to 3-fold Pd(0) sites, respectively [27,45]. Corresponding Pd 3d XPS spectra without exposure to air (Fig. 4B) shows two symmetric components with Pd 3d5/2 binding energies of 335.2 and 336.4 eV, typically arising from Pd(0) and Pd(II) features, respectively. The appearance of Pd(II) features mainly result from the Pd atoms of the Pd-TiO2 interface involving a charge transfer from Pd to TiO2. The Pd(II)/Pdtotal ratios of the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts (Table S1 and Table S3) are slightly different, following an order of 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (9.1%) > 2%Pd/TiO2{100} (8.8%) > 2%Pd/TiO2{001} (7.8%). It is well-known that defects on oxide support determine the MSIs, affecting the charge transfer between metal and support [27-31]. Therefore, more defects over TiO2{101} and TiO2{100} NCs (Fig. 1 D and E) lead to stronger Pd-TiO2 interactions and thus more positively-charged Pd species over 2%Pd/TiO2{101} and 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalysts, fully consistent with Pd 3d XPS results. Of note, previous results reveal that metallic Pd species is favorable for the adsorption and activation of H2 than positively-charged Pd species, leading to smaller reaction order of H2 [24-27]. Thereafter, the surface Pd(0) content is calculated on the basis of the Pd loading, the Pd dispersion and surface Pd(0):Pd(II) ratio, which are 0.411, 0.399, and 0.776 wt% for the 2%Pd/TiO2{100}, 2%Pd/TiO2{101} and 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalysts. As a result, it is reasonable that smaller reaction order of H2 (Fig. 3E) was observed on 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst with more Pd(0) presented. H2-TPR experiments were conducted to investigate the reduction properties of the TiO2 support and representative unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts. For various bare TiO2 supports (Fig. S16), it has been reported that the reduction of bare TiO2 NCs generally locates at ca. 923 K [31], thus no reduction peak is observed at below 773 K. Additionally, the broad and weak negative peaks at the temperature range of 320–700 K present on various bare TiO2 supports, which could be ascribed to the physisorbed and/or chemisorbed H2 formed at RT under the reducing environment but desorbed at high temperature releasing hydrogen. After Pd loading (Fig. 5 A), besides the negative peaks, an additional reduction peak is observed for the unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts, commonly ascribed to the reduction of Pd-TiO2 interface. This reduction peak shifts from 538 K for the unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts to 520 K for the unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst, suggesting that the Pd-TiO2 interface becomes weaker and consequently eases the TiO2 reduction of the Pd-TiO2 interface [31]. Of note, no reduction peak of PdO species appears on various unreduced 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts, which mainly arises from the facile reducibility of PdO, proceeded at RT under the reducing environment [45]. The adsorption and activation behaviors of CO2 are affected by the support basicity, which is determined by CO2-TPD results. As shown in Fig. 5B and Fig. S17, similar desorption signals were observed on both various bare TiO2 NCs and various 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts, on which two desorption peaks (denoted as α and β, respectively) appear, both starting from RT. The peak α, located at ca. 365 K, arises from the desorption signal of CO2 weakly interacting with TiO2 support (denoted as weak basic site), and the peak β, located at ca. 455 K, can be ascribed to the desorption of adsorbed CO2 species existence in the form of carbonates and bicarbonates (denoted as moderate basic site) [46,47]. The factions of different basic sites based on the fitted results in CO2-TPD profiles (Table S4) is distinctly different between TiO2{001} and 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalysts, which could be due to the instability of the moderate basic site on TiO2{001} NCs, leading to the vanishment and/or turn into weak basic site of the moderate basic site during complex Pd-loaded process. The reaction order of NaHCO3 was found only linearly relevant to the desorption intensity of moderate basic site normalized by the specific BET surface area but not to those of weak basic site (Fig. 5C) and total basic sites (Fig. S18). This indicates that the adsorbed CO2 species on moderate basic site should contribute to the formate formation from CO2 hydrogenation, i.e. the elemental step of CO2 activation proceeds on the moderate basic site of Pd/TiO2 catalysts."
9,The investigation of reaction mechanism,"3.4 The investigation of reaction mechanism The reaction behaviors of three 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts were systematically investigated by in situ DRIFTS spectroscopy. Assignments of the vibrational bands for various surface species in the DRIFTS spectra are summarized in Table S5 [24,25,27,36,48-50]. Upon H2 adsorption (Fig. S19), compared to other two 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts, an initial and strong loss of original surface carbonaceous species over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst was observed, indicating the activation and reactivity of H2 over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst more readily, consistent with its prominently higher surface Pd(0) content (Table S1). Upon CO2 adsorption (Fig. 6 A1-C1 and Fig. S20), similar surface carbonaceous species, including monodentate and polydentate carbonates (labelled in black words), bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate (labelled in red words), and formate (labelled in blue words), are gradually generated. However, the intensities of surface carbonaceous species over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts are much higher than that over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst based on the significant different of the in situ DRIFTS spectra of CO2 activation (not fully quantitative comparison) for 30 min over various 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. S20D). These suggest a similar structure of basic site but different densities of basic site for the adsorption and activation of CO2 over various 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts, consistent with CO2-TPD results (Fig. 5B). In addition, the ratio of formate is much higher over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst than those over other two Pd/TiO2 catalysts, further indicating a rapid hydrogenation process over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst. These results clearly reveal that the adsorbed CO2 is easily activated into carbonaceous species over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts whereas the carbonaceous species hydrogenation proceeds more readily over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst. Afterwards, the in situ DRIFTS spectra under the working conditions were conducted (Fig. 6 A2-C2). The surface carbonaceous species are generated during CO2 + H2 atmosphere over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts whereas 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst exhibits a rapid loss of the original carbonaceous species, suggesting the rate-determining step is different on these catalysts. It is widely reported that the formate formation from CO2 hydrogenation mainly involves with two elemental steps, i.e. the activation process of adsorbed CO2 and the hydrogenation process of carbonaceous intermediates [24-27]. Therefore, the generation of surface carbonaceous intermediates over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts indicates that the hydrogenation process of carbonaceous intermediates is the rate-determining step but switch to the activation process of adsorbed CO2 over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst due to lower density of moderate basic site (Fig. 5B), agreeing with previous results of the rate-determining step determined by the support basicity [24]. The hydrogenation process of surface carbonaceous intermediates over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts was subsequently investigated by in situ DRIFTS spectra recorded the consumptions of surface carbonaceous intermediates reacting with H2 after CO2 activation. As shown in Fig. S21, the declines of monodentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species emerge for both catalysts after H2 introduced, suggesting these species likely contribute to the formation of formate. Previously experimental and theoretical results revealed that the bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate are two mainly involved species of CO2 hydrogenation into formate [22-25]. For instance, Mori et al. reported that the bicarbonate species is a key carbonaceous intermediate [22], who further reacting with atomic H is regarded as the rate-determining step of CO2 hydrogenation into formate over PdAg/TiO2 catalyst. Therefore, the ratio of formate / (formate + bidentate carbonate + bicarbonate) was derived from the fitted in situ DRIFTS spectra in CO2 + H2 atmosphere (Fig. S22) and presents an order of 2%Pd/TiO2{100} (29.6%) > 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (26.0%). This indicates a more rapid hydrogenation process of bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst, matching well with a higher catalytic activity observed on 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst. It is noteworthy that the intensity of the in situ DRIFTS spectra exposed in CO2 and CO2 + H2 atmospheres is significantly different (Fig. 6), which can be ascribed to the addition of H2, leading to more formations of bicarbonate and formate species and thus higher intensity of surface carbonaceous species in CO2 + H2 atmosphere. Furthermore, the intensity of surface carbonaceous species over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst is much weaker than that over 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalyst in CO2 + H2 atmosphere, in consistent with better hydrogenation activity observed on 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst (Fig. 3B)."
10,The investigation of catalytic stability,"3.5 The investigation of catalytic stability The microscopic structural changes of the 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts evaluated after 6 rounds of CO2 hydrogenation into formate were tested by TEM imaging. As shown in Fig. 7 , compared to fresh 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. 2), the morphologies of original TiO2 NCs in the Pd/TiO2 catalysts are well preserved after the reaction (Fig. 7 A1-C1) while the Pd particle structures exhibit titania morphology-dependent changes. The average Pd particle size does not change significantly for used 2%Pd/TiO2{100} (3.7 ± 0.9 nm) and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (4.3 ± 1.1 nm) catalysts but grows up obviously from 4.0 to 4.9 nm for used 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst (Fig. 7 A4-C4). This further indicates weaker Pd-TiO2 interactions in the 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst, resulting in the agglomeration of Pd particles during CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The Pd particle shape was further analyzed by determining the ratio between the short diameter (R1) and the long diameter (R2) of the two-dimensional projection in the TEM image of an individual Pd particle (Fig. 8 A). For various fresh 2%Pd/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. 2 A2-C2 and Fig. 8 B1-D1), the fraction of Pd particles with R1/R2 ratios less than 0.8 follows the order of 2%Pd/TiO2{100} (88.0%) > 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (77.7%) ≫ 2%Pd/TiO2{001} (48.8%), indicating more flat Pd particles formed on 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts than that on 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst. After 6 rounds of CO2 hydrogenation reaction (Fig. 7 A2-C2 and Fig. 8 B2-D2), the fraction of Pd particles with R1/R2 ratios less than 0.8 decreases to 26.4% on 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst, while those on 2%Pd/TiO2{100} (84.1%) and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} (75.8%) catalysts remain almost unchanged. These observations clearly confirm much stronger Pd-TiO2 interactions in the Pd/TiO2{100} and Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts than in the Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst, which can stabilize Pd structures and resist to both size increases and shape changes of Pd particles. Therefore, the above microscopic analysis results not only demonstrate that the deactivation of Pd/TiO2 catalysts mainly arises from the structural changes of Pd particles, but also provide a realizable strategy for developing stable Pd/TiO2 catalysts."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a highly active and stable Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst has been successfully developed for CO2 hydrogenation into formate by the morphology engineering of TiO2 support. The catalyst basicity plays a crucial role for formate formation from CO2 hydrogenation, resulting in the switch of the rate-determining step from the hydrogenation process of carbonaceous intermediates over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} and 2%Pd/TiO2{101} catalysts to the activation process of adsorbed CO2 over 2%Pd/TiO2{001} catalyst. Higher density of moderate basic site and relatively more metallic Pd species over 2%Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst, respectively contributing to the activations of CO2 and H2, are favorable for the catalytic activity. Higher oxygen vacancy concentrations in the TiO2{100} NCs, contributing to the enhancement of the MSIs, can result in the formation and stability of flat Pd particles over Pd/TiO2{100} catalyst, and thus are favorable for the catalytic stability. These findings shed light on the role of the oxide support structures (morphology) in heterogeneous catalysis and provide possibilities of developing highly active and stable Pd/TiO2 catalysts for possible applications."
