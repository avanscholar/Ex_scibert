0,Introduction,"Recently, converting synthesis gas into mixed alcohols has become more and more attractive with the depletion of fossil energy and the increase of fuel demand in the world [1,2]. For this reaction process, rhodium, cobalt, iron, nickel and molybdenum supported catalysts have been extensively studied. It has been proved that for Mo-based catalysts, the suitable acid–base property plays a very important role in producing higher alcohol [3,4]. Kim et al. [5] suggested that the alkali promoter for Mo2C changed the surface electron density and further increased alcohol productivity. Gascon et al. [3] pointed out that the presence of an alkali promoter was necessary for higher-alcohol synthesis from syngas. On the other hand, since Co has demonstrated the appropriate interaction with the active components, it has also often been used as the promoter to modify Mo2C or MoS2 [6,7]. Xiang et al. reported that the alcohol production rate over Mo2C catalysts was promoted by the addition of Co and Ni, but not Fe [8]. Storm also believed that addition of Co to a K–Mo catalyst was beneficial to achieving significant selectivity to higher alcohols from syngas [9]. Transition metal phosphide has higher activity for hydrogenation than carbide and nitride [10]. At the same time, it can expose higher density for the active site than sulfide [11]. Recently, MoP supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 has used to catalyze hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and CO hydrogenation reactions [12–15]. Zaman and Smith [16,17] have reported that C2+ oxygenates are the main product of CO hydrogenation over K promoted MoP/SiO2 catalysts. Ding et al. [18] also found that CoxP/SiO2 catalysts showed a high selectivity of 45% toward C2+ oxygenates. The sol–gel method with citric acid as a complexant has been widely used for preparing catalysts with highly dispersed activity components [19,20]. Bao et al. [21] have prepared a K–Co–Mo/C catalyst with small particle size and homogenous component distribution using this method. The results show that this catalyst has high C2+ alcohol and hydrocarbon selectivities. However, the phosphide catalyst for syngas to higher alcohol is seldom prepared from the modified sol–gel method. In the present work, a series of carbon modified KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts was prepared by using citric acid (CA) as a complexant. The as-prepared catalysts were evaluated with CO hydrogenation and characterized using various XRD, XPS and TPD techniques. The effects of the different components, especially potassium, on the performances of these catalysts for syngas conversion were also discussed. These results are novel and beneficial to further investigation for CO hydrogenation on phosphide based catalysts."
1,Experiments,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of carbon modified KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts was prepared from a modified sol–gel method. All reagents are of analytical grade. A typical procedure was as follows: Firstly, a certain amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was successively dissolved in ultra-pure water. Then CA was added to the above salt solution with CA/(Mo+Co) molar ratio=1.0. Finally, the mixed aqueous solution of K2CO3 and (NH4)2HPO4 was slowly added into the former solution. The resulting solution was kept in a water bath at 338K under constant stirring until the solution became a gel with high viscosity. During the gelation process, the solution kept homogeneous and no precipitate was formed. The as-prepared gel was dried in air at 393K for 15h and calcined in N2 at 773K for 4h. The calcined catalyst precursor was reduced to a phosphide by temperature-programmed reduction in H2 at a flow rate of 150ml/min and a heating rate of 5K/min to 773K, followed by a heating rate of 1K/min to 923K. The final temperature was held for 2h. After cooling to room temperature in nitrogen, the sample was passivated with 1% O2/N2 for 2h. The nano-structured phosphide catalysts were denoted as KxCo0.75MoP, where x was the K/Mo molar ratio in the parent solution."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The bulk structure of the catalyst after passivation was measured by XRD. The XRD measurements were carried out on a PAN-alytical X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka (λ=0.15406nm) radiation. A continuous scan mode was used to collect 2θ data from 20° to 80° with a step width of 0.0167°. Specific surface area was determined by N2 adsorption–desorption method at 77K using a Micrometrics Tristar-3000 system. Prior to the analysis, the samples were outgassed at 523K for 4h to eliminate volatile adsorbates on the surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe system with Al Kα radiation under ultrahigh vacuum. The binding energies were internally referenced to C 1s from the carbon residuum (Eb=284.6eV). Temperature-Programmed Desorption Mass Spectroscopy (TPD-MS) of CO2 was performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2920 sorption analyzer. Before CO2 adsorption, a sample was pre-reduced in-situ in the TPD cell at 923K in a stream of H2 for 2h. The amount of desorbed CO2 was monitored by a mass spectrometer connected to the Micromeritics 2920."
4,Catalytic reaction measurement,"2.3 Catalytic reaction measurement The reaction performances of the catalysts for mixed alcohol synthesis were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor (i.d.=13mm). The production was checked with an on-line gas chromatograph. For each experiment, 0.7g of the samples were sized between 20 and 50mesh and diluted with 3.3g of quartz sands (inert diluents) with similar size in order to maintain isothermal conditions. Prior to the reaction, the sample of the catalyst was pre-reduced in situ at 923K for 2h under H2 stream of 150ml/min. After cooling to below 353K, the sweeping gas was switched to syngas. Catalytic activity measurements were carried out under the reaction conditions of 5.0MPa, 548K, V(H2):V(CO):V(N2)=45:45:10, and GHSV=3600h−1 after steady state was reached. The carbon-based selectivity for the carbon-containing products (including alcohols, alkanes, alkenes, and other oxygenates) was calculated based on carbon efficiency. All the experiments were repeated two times to check the reproducibility."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of cobalt promoter,"3.1 Effects of cobalt promoter The N2 physisorption for the phosphide catalysts was performed and results were presented in Table 1 . Results show that the surface areas are relatively high (~35m2/g) compared with the unsupported MoP catalyst without CA (<10m2/g) [22]. This is due to the directing effect of CA. It can form complexes with Mo and Co, thereby inhibiting aggregation of the metal species. Residual CA is transformed to carbonaceous species in H2 at high temperatures. These carbonaceous species could be well dispersed around the catalyst particles, preventing them from sintering [23]. In addition, we also noted that the addition of Co can also result in the increasing of the surface area of K0Co0.75MoP in comparison with K0Co0MoP. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of K0Co0MoP and K0Co0.75MoP catalysts. The XRD pattern of the K0Co0MoP catalyst shows several peaks at 27.9, 32.1, 43.1, 57.3, 64.8, 67.6 and 74.2°, similar to the standard pattern of MoP from the JCPDS powder diffraction file (PDF card 24-0771) as well as that reported in the literature [24]. The other new peaks around 39.4, 49.1 and 54.0° for the K0Co0.75MoP catalysts are assigned to CoMoP species according to PDF card 32-0299. The XRD result, on one hand, indicates that MoP can be prepared from the modified sol–gel method successfully. On the other hand, the existence form of phosphide can change from MoP to CoMoP with the addition of Co. Combined with BET results, the addition of cobalt contributes to the dispersion of catalytic components in phosphide catalysts."
7,Effects of potassium promoter,"3.2 Effects of potassium promoter In order to investigate the effects of potassium on the performance of CO hydrogenation, a series of KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts was prepared. Table 2 summarizes their activities and selectivities. The results in Table 2 illustrate that CH4 and other hydrocarbons are the main products over K0Co0MoP and K0Co0.75MoP catalysts. With the addition of K to the K0Co0.75MoP catalysts, the selectivity to CH4 and other hydrocarbons was significantly reduced by potassium. At the same time, the selectivity to C2+ oxygenated products increases with the increasing of K/Mo molar ratio from 0 to 1 and then decreases. Fig. 2 demonstrates the XRD patterns of KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts. In comparison with the K0Co0.75MoP catalyst, the addition of potassium in KxCo0.75MoP results in the transformation from CoMoP to MoP and the generation of molybdenum and potassium oxides. Meanwhile, MoP (101) diffraction peak shifts toward the lower position (PDF card 24-0771), from 43.1° to 42.7°, and CoMoP (210) peak does toward the higher position (PDF card 32-0299), from 39.4° to 40.1°, which means that the strong interaction between CoMoP and MoP occurs in KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts due to the addition of potassium. Fig. 3 displays the XPS spectra of the KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts [25,26]. The baseline corrections were carried out using the Shirley method. Recorded spectra were fitted using Gaussian–Lorentzian curves. The spectra of XPS Mo 3d were deconvoluted using a splitting parameter of 3.13eV. The distributions of the Mo oxidation states on the surface of various catalysts are shown in Table 3 [27]. The results are based on XPS peak areas. The dominant Mo species for K0Co0MoP and K0Co0.75MoP catalysts were Mo2+, Mo3+, Mo5+ and Mo6+. With the addition of potassium, the content of Mo2+, Mo3+, Mo5+ and Mo6+ decreased while the content of Mo4+ remarkably increased. The content of Mo4+ has increased up to 100at.% for K1Co0.75MoP and K1.5Co0.75MoP catalysts. The presence of a large number of Mo4+ is the reason for the best selectivity to C2+ higher alcohol in CO hydrogenation reaction [4,5,28–30]. K0Co0.75MoP comprises CoMoP and MoP phases and involves Mo2+, Mo3+, and Mo5+ besides Mo6+ species. Since the addition of potassium leads to the strong interaction between CoMoP and MoP, the compromise of the electronic density between both of them occurs. Therefore, a large number of Mo4+ species are produced. This is similar to the effect of potassium to MoS2 [3]. The CO2-TPD spectra for the pre-reduced KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The strength of the basic sites can be determined by the temperature at which the adsorbed CO2 starts to desorb. As shown in Fig. 4, no peaks can be found on the K0Co0MoP catalyst. This result indicates the absence of basic sites. With the addition of Co into the K0Co0MoP catalyst, there appeared a peak around 506K, which means the presence of basic sites. With the further addition of K, higher CO2 desorption temperature is required and the stronger basic site is formed in comparison with that of only Co. Although higher alkali content may suppress the activity of the catalyst by blocking the active sites and decreasing the surface area of catalysts (Table 1), it can contribute to the dramatic increasing in the selectivity to C2+ higher alcohol products. Therefore, there is the optimal K/Mo ratio of 1.0 for the phosphide catalysts. Stability of the catalyst plays an important role in industrial applications. Thus, Fig. 5 presents the activity and selectivity of the K1Co0.75MoP catalyst for 50h. After about 8h, a stable operating state is achieved. Stability results show that catalytic performance almost keeps constant during the reaction process. Study on the effect of internal mass transfer was conducted over K1Co0.75MoP catalysts with different particle sizes (see Fig. S1). CO conversion and C2+ oxy selectivity increase slightly while alkene and alkane selectivities almost keep constant with the decreasing in catalyst particle size from 8–20 to 20–50mesh. With further decreasing catalyst particle size from 20–50 to 50–80mesh, no significant change is observed in the reaction. These results suggest that the effect of internal mass transfer on catalytic performance is negligible for kinetics studies for syngas to higher alcohol after the catalyst particle size increases up to 20–50mesh."
8,Conclusions,"A series of carbon modified KxCo0.75MoP (0≤x≤1.5) catalysts was prepared from a modified sol–gel method, evaluated for CO hydrogenation and characterized by various physiochemical techniques in this work. Results show that the addition of Co can improve phosphide transformation from MoP to CoMoP phase and accelerate the dispersion of catalytic components in phosphide catalysts. The addition of potassium in phosphide catalysts can increase the alkali of the catalyst, enhance the interaction between MoP and CoMoP and facilitate the rearrangement of electron density in different Mo species. In this case, a large number of Mo4+ species resulted in high selectivity to C2+ higher alcohol. However, the higher alkali content can also decrease the surface area of catalysts, hindering syngas conversion. Therefore, there is the appropriate K/Mo ratio of 1.0 for the phosphide catalysts. The appropriate phosphide catalyst is K1Co0.75MoP for CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols. It has a high stability for 50h. In addition, the effect of internal mass transfer on catalytic performance is negligible for kinetics studies after catalyst particle size increases up to 20–50mesh. We believe that these results will help the study of phosphide catalysts involving acid–base performance to a great extent. Of course, the reaction conversion and selectivity to higher alcohols still do not reach researchers' expectation. The main reason may come from the still low surface area and the unsuitable pore structure for the phosphide catalyst. The study is under way."
