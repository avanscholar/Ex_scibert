0,Introduction,"Previously, this author has published one monograph and two reviews, including a report in the 8th International Conference on Carbon Dioxide Utilization, in 2005, in the field of carbon dioxide utilization [1–3]. This article addresses synthetic technologies for the preparation of organic chemicals reported since 2005. Two important events have occurred in the area of climate change since 2005. First, the most advanced countries agreed in 1997, with the Kyoto Protocol, to reduce their collective greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels. However, overall gas emission levels actually increased rapidly after 1990 because the gas emissions of developing countries increased rapidly and the two countries with the largest gas emissions, the United States of America and China, did not have any carbon dioxide reduction obligations. The second issue is that the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami forced the decommissioning of four nuclear power stations and will stop the operation of almost all of the other 50 stations in Japan in the middle of 2012 because of a campaign against nuclear power plants and other anti-nuclear demonstrations in the world. Therefore, we have to depend more on thermal power generation through coal burning, which emits the most carbon dioxide of any method of electric power production. The production of carbon dioxide is expected to increase in the future. As shown in Table 1 , in the period from 1975 to 2002, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by approximately 1.5ppm (8 billion tons) per year. Very recently, however, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased much more rapidly, by 2.25ppm (12 billion tons) per year. Table 1 shows that, recently, the amount of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere has increased by 10 billion tons or more every year. Special effort should now be made to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a very stable compound because it is highly oxidized and thermodynamically stable. Its utilization generally requires reactive compounds and highly reactive catalysts. However, due to the electron deficiency of the carbonyl carbon, carbon dioxide has a strong affinity toward nucleophiles and electron-donating reagents. Recently, oxygen-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, carbon–carbon unsaturated compounds and other substrates have been investigated for the utilization of carbon dioxide for the production of organic chemicals (Table 2 ). These reactive substrates are oxygen-containing compounds, such as epoxides and alcohols; nitrogen-containing compounds, such as aziridines and the other amines; unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as aromatic compounds, alkynes and alkenes; and others, such as hydrogen. The chemical produced in the greatest amount through carbon dioxide utilization is urea. According to the international fertilization association, 157 million tons of urea were produced in 2010 [7]. Other chemicals produced through carbon dioxide utilization are cyclic carbonates, acyclic carbonates, polyalkylene carbonates, Asahi Kasei polycarbonates, carbamic acid esters, oxazolidinones, polyurethanes, carboxylic acids and esters, lactones, formic acid and methanol. The amounts of various organic chemicals produced through carbon dioxide utilization throughout the world are shown in Table 3 . Recently, several reviews on carbon dioxide utilization have been published. In 2007, Sakakura et al. [15] published “Transformation of Carbon Dioxide”, Aresta et al. [16] published “Utilization of CO2 as a chemical feedstock: opportunities and challenges” and Aresta [17] published “Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Uses as a Chemical Feedstock”. In 2010, Riduan and Zhang [18] published “Recent developments in carbon dioxide utilization under mild conditions”, Darenbourg [19] published “Chemistry of Carbon Dioxide Relevant to Its Utilization: A Personal Perspective”, Hu published “Advances in CO2 Conversion and Utilization,” ACS Symposium Ser. 1050, 2011, and He et al. published “CO2 Chemistry at Nankai Group: Catalytic Conversion of CO2 into Value-Added Chemicals” [20]."
1,Oxygen-containing compounds,
2,Introduction,"2.1 Introduction Carbon dioxide reacts with reactive oxygen-containing compounds such as epoxides and alcohols in the presence of a catalyst, as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) [3]. (1) (2) 2 ROH + CO 2 ⟶ cat ( RO ) 2 C = O + H 2 O The first reaction (1) proceeds easily with many kinds of catalysts because the epoxides are more reactive compounds than the alcohols. However, the second reaction (2), with alcohols, generally does not proceed in high yield because the reaction yields water and the catalysts are usually deactivated by the water. Hence, these reactions need dehydration agents during the reaction. The first reaction (1) also proceeds to form polymeric products under reaction conditions described in Section 2.4, as shown in Eq. (3) [3]. (3) The cyclic carbonates shown in Eq. (1) can also be synthesized through three cyclocarboxylation reactions with reactive substrates such as propargyl alcohols, diols and alkenes, as shown in Eqs. (4)–(6) [21]. (4) (5) (6) These carbonates are very useful as raw materials for the production of polycarbonates such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diphenyl carbonate (see Section 2.5), as electrolyte solvents in lithium ion secondary batteries, as polar aprotic solvents and as additives for fuels [15,21]."
3,Cyclic carbonates,"2.2 Cyclic carbonates 2.2.1 Synthesis of cyclic carbonates with epoxides Cyclic carbonates are easily synthesized by the reaction of reactive epoxides with carbon dioxide in the presence of many kinds of catalysts, as shown in Eq. (1). An earlier review [3] reported that catalysts such as Cr, Ni, Al, Mg and Sn compounds and ionic liquids induced high yields. Propylene carbonate synthesis in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) with polyfluoroalkylphosphonium was an especially effective process because the product spontaneously separated from the scCO2 phase and the catalyst could be recycled while maintaining a high CO2 pressure and temperature [22]. Recently, Ru and Co complexes have been the principle transition metal catalysts, and Ti, Nb, Cr, Re and Au compounds have also been used. The main non-transition metal catalysts used have been Zn and Al compounds as well as Bi and Li compounds. Quaternary ammonium compounds, phosphines, amines and ionic liquids have been used as organic catalysts; these are shown in Table 4 [22–38], Table 5 [38–49] and Table 6 [50–63], respectively. The reaction of propylene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of trans-dichlorotetrapyridineruthenium(II) together with CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) produces propylene carbonate in a high yield, with a high turnover number (TON, Moles of product produced per mole of catalyst) and a high turnover frequency (TOF, Moles of product produced per hour), as shown in Eq. (7) [24]. (7) The proposed mechanism of the coupling reaction of propylene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and a tetraalkyl ammonium bromide co-catalyst is shown in Scheme 1 [24]. North et al. [64] published a review on the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and carbon dioxide. 2.2.2 Alternative routes in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates 2.2.2.1 Cyclocarboxylation with propargyl alcohols Reactive propargyl alcohols react with carbon dioxide in a reaction similar to the epoxide reactions shown in Eqs. (1) and (7) to give cyclic carbonates, as shown in Eq. (8). The metal compounds of group 11, silver [65–67], copper [68], alkyl phosphines [69] and N-heterocyclic carbenes [70] are used as the catalysts for these reactions. Propargyl alcohols react under carbon dioxide at a pressure of 1.0MPa in the presence of silver acetate to give a cyclic carbonate in excellent yields, as shown in Eq. (8) [67]. (8) Propargyl alcohol, activated by an amine base, reacts with carbon dioxide to form a carbonate intermediate (6, Scheme 2 ). An intramolecular ring closure reaction then proceeds on the alkyne, activated by a metal complex, to give the corresponding cyclic carbonate with the release of the metal catalyst, as shown in Scheme 2 [67]. Furthermore, electrosynthesis was also successfully carried out with a copper anode and a nickel cathode in an undivided cell containing n-Bu4NBrMeCN electrolyte under 3MPa of CO2, and α-alkylidene cyclic carbonates were obtained in high yield [71]. 2.2.2.2 Cyclocarbonylation with 1,2-diols Cyclic carbonates are also synthesized by the reaction 1,2-diols such as 1,2-propylene glycol with carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalyst, e.g., anhydrous zinc acetate, in acetonitrile, as shown in Eq. (9) [64,72–75]. (9) 2.2.2.3 Cyclocarbonylation with alkenes Alkenes and carbon dioxide are cyclized directly in water with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (10% molar) and aqueous hydrogen peroxide with DBU at a high yield, as shown in Eq. (10) [76]. (10) Similarly, the direct preparation of styrene carbonates from styrene has been achieved in the presence of an ionic-liquid-base consisting of methyltrioxorhenium(MTO)/urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP)/Zn [1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium(EMIm)]2Br4[EMIm]Br4 at an 83% yield [77]."
4,Acyclic carbonates,"2.3 Acyclic carbonates As shown in Eq. (2), the carboxylation of alcohols yields acyclic carbonates and water. This process usually has a low yield because of the formation of water, especially in the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate [21]. Many kinds of catalyst and dehydrating agent have been investigated. Catalysts include Ti(OMe)4 [78,79], V2O5 [80], Nb(OR)5 [81], CeO2, ZrO2 [82–87], CeO2 Al2O3 [88], W, CeTi [89], CuCl [90], CuNi [91] and CuMo [92] as transition metal compounds and Bu2Sn(OMe)2 [93,94] and t-Bu2Sn(OMe)2 [95] as non-transition metal compounds. An acetal and a molecular sieve (3A) have been used as recyclable dehydrating agents [21] and DDC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) [96], orthoester (Si(OMe)4) [97] and Mitsunobu reagents (e.g., triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate) [98] have been used as non-recyclable dehydrating agents. Recently, Sakakura et al. [93,94] reported two excellent processes using an acetal and a molecular sieve (3A) as dehydrating agents in the presence of a Bu2Sn(OMe)2 catalyst, as described in an earlier review [3]. The process using the acetal gives methyl carbonate in high yield because it is easy to utilize acetone, a byproduct, as the raw material for a reaction with methanol, as shown in Scheme 3 [93,94]. Therefore, methyl carbonate is synthesized through the reaction of MeOH and CO2. The other dimethyl carbonate process, using the 3A molecular sieve, involved directly reacting carbon dioxide with methyl alcohol, with dehydration occurring in a separate apparatus at a low temperature [94]. (11) Sakakura et al. [93] studied several active catalyst structures through X-ray diffraction and NMR studies. R2Sn(OMe)2 obtained as a single crystal from a tert-BuOH solution has a methoxy-bridged structure (compound 7, R=Me). The reaction between R2Sn(OMe)2 and excess carbon dioxide gave a complex with two new kinds of methoxy groups, as determined by NMR data. These methoxy groups are a methoxy-bridged dinuclear complex (compound 8, R=Me) and a mononuclear complex with an intramolecularly coordinated carbonyl group (compound 9, R=Me). Single crystals of compound 8 were obtained from a carbon dioxide saturated CH2Cl2 Et2O solution. The above tin catalyst is deactivated with water to yield dibutyltin oxide, as shown in Eq. (12). (12) Bu 2 Sn ( OMe ) 2 + H 2 O → 1 2 [ Bu 2 SnO ] 2 + 2 MeOH The dibuthyltin oxide reacts with methanol in the presence of a dehydrating agent (acetal (2,2-dimethoxypropane)) to give the ladder complex tetrabutyl(dimethoxy)stannoxane dimer (compound 10) in the presence of carbon dioxide pressure, with a quantitative yield, as shown in Eq. (13) [15,99]. (13) This ladder complex is activated by an organotin oxide catalyst with a dehydrating agent such as acetal (2,2-dimethoxypropane) or a 3A molecular sieve. The ladder compound has an activity similar to that of Bu2Sn(OMe)2, and it reacts with carbon dioxide to give a carbon dioxide insertion product that is the same as compound 8, as shown in Eq. (14) [21,100]. (14) The reaction proceeds as follows: first, carbon dioxide inserted into the tin-methoxy bond (the active site) in Bu2Sn(OMe)2 (compound 7, R=Bu) to form the tin carbonate complex (compounds 8 and 9, R=Bu); next, methanol reacts with the tin carbonate to give dimethoxy carbonate and a tin hydroxy complex or a tin oxide complex. These tin hydroxy and tin oxide complexes are reactivated by the dehydrating agent and methanol under carbon dioxide pressure, as shown in Eq. (13). Ballivet-Tkatchenko et al. [101] reported the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate with n-Bu2Sn(OMe)2 in scCO2 (20MPa pressure) without using the dehydrating agent. They isolated a new tin complex (compound 12) containing 10 tin atoms that was similar to the above ladder compounds from Eqs. (13) and (14). The active sites of these organotin compounds are presumed to be SnOMe bonds or SnO(Me)Sn bridged bonds because carbon dioxide is inserted into the SnOMe bond in these reactions. This active tin catalyst is able to absorb water as the organotin oxide [Bu2SnO] n does, as shown in Eq. (12). Furthermore, the deactivated tin catalyst ([Bu2SnO] n ]) can be re-activated with methyl alcohol to yield a new SnOMe bond together with a [Bu2SnO] group by bonding with the ladder compounds, as shown in compounds 10, 11 and 12. Compound 12 is a 10-tin compound having four SnOMe active sites together with 10 Bu2SnO groups as non-active sites and two carbonate bridges. The ratio of active sites to tin atoms in compound 12 is (4/10). Eq. (2) with compound 12 has approximately half the yield of Eq. (1) [101]. Recently, Wakamatsu et al. [102] reported the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate with Me2Sn(OMe)2 in a reaction that proceeds by inserting carbon dioxide into the SnOMe bond or the SnO(Me)Sn bridged bond, as determined by a density functional theory (DFT) study. The ratios of the total active sites to the tin atom in the tin catalyst and the reaction intermediates are as follows. The catalyst (compound 7) has a ratio of 2 while the reaction intermediates (compounds 8 and 9, R=Bu) each have a ratio of 1. The product of the reaction of dibutyltin oxide with methanol in the presence of a dehydrating agent (acetal (2,2-dimethoxypropane)) and the carboxylation product (compounds 10 and 11) each have a ratio of 0.75. However, the ratio of the new tin compound (compound 12) is only 0.4 (4/10). The yield of this compound in the first reaction is roughly 50%."
5,Polyalkylene carbonates,"2.4 Polyalkylene carbonates Inoue and co-workers disclosed the first example of epoxide/CO2 copolymerization in 1969, as shown in Eq. (3). They discovered that a mixture of ZnEt2 and H2O successfully catalyzed the copolymerization of propylene oxide (PO) and CO2 [103]. An earlier review [3] reported on the various kinds of zinc catalysts, such as alkyl, aryl, diimines, Schiff bases, bis(salicylaldiminate) zinc compounds, organotins, metal porphyrins such as aluminum and chromium porphyrins, chromium salens and salen cobalt compounds and on an alternating copolymer having a narrow molecular weight (Mw/Mn=1.07–1.17) and a high molecular weight (Mw=approximately 420,000) at a high turnover number (TON) (TON=1441g/1gcat). Recent transition metal catalysts and main group metal compounds used as catalysts for the synthesis of polyalkylene carbonates are shown in Table 7 [104–114,29,115–127] and Table 8 [128–142], respectively. The copolymerization of propylene oxide and carbon dioxide forms a poly(propylenecarbonate) (PPC) with polyether linkages and a cyclic carbonate as a side product, as shown in Eq. (15) [109]. (15) This polycarbonate containing polyether linkages and the cyclic carbonates shown in Eq. (15) can be synthesized with high selectivity and a high rate with subtle modification of the architecture of the catalyst. Precise control of the production ratios of cyclic carbonates and polycarbonates is achieved by utilizing homogeneous catalysts with appropriate reaction conditions, such as pressure, temperature and co-catalytic additives [143]. Recently, only Cr, Co and Zn have been used in these catalysts. The catalysts can alternate between alkylene oxide and carbon dioxide in their copolymerization, as shown in Tables 7 and 8. In 2008, Lee et al. [121] reported on the reaction of propylene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a Co(salen) complex, as shown in Eq. (16). They presented a highly active catalytic system for CO2/propylene oxide copolymerization to selectively produce a very high molecular weight copolymer. The catalyst can be readily separated by filtration through a short pad of silica gel to yield a resin containing negligible amounts of metal residue. The separated catalyst can be reused without showing significant loss of catalytic performance [121]. (16) The glass transition temperatures of alternating copolymerization products with carbon dioxide are 30–40°C for the polymer from polypropylene oxide and 110–120°C for the polymers from cyclohexene epoxide. Hence, the latter polymers can tolerate boiling water while the former polymers are available as biodegradable polymers for medical uses. Such polycarbonate is industrially used in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and 3000 tons per year of the polypropylenecarbonate are manufactured for biodegradable tableware and medical supplies. The Chukai Petrochemical Company manufactured 3000 tons per year of the polypropylenecarbonate on Hai-nan Island [144,145]. The first major commercial launch of the Novomer Company in the USA is a grade of polypropylene carbonate called NB-180. The polymer chain breaks up and sublimes at a relatively low temperature and is thus ideally suited for applications such as photolithography and the technology used to draw lines tens-of-nanometers wide on integrated circuits. Novomer is also looking at applications in capacitors, resistors, printing materials and binders, and in binding diamonds onto saw blades. This company also manufactures a polyethylene carbonate with good oxygen-barrier properties. It may be an ideal gas-barrier laminate for uses with PET in food and beverage packaging, such as soda bottles, because it is suitable for making plastic films with PET film [146]."
6,Asahi Kasei Polycarbonate Process,"2.5 Asahi Kasei Polycarbonate Process In an earlier review [3], the Asahi Kasei Polycarbonate Process (Scheme 4 [147]) was reported to have four excellent characteristics. First, the raw materials for the process are carbon dioxide, ethylene oxide and bisphenol A, and the process does not use toxic phosgene and halogen-based solvents, such as CH2Cl2. Second, the products are polycarbonate and ethylene glycol. Both products are of a high quality because the products do not contain halogen-based materials originating from phosgene or CH2Cl2. Third, all of the intermediate products of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, methylphenyl carbonate and diphenyl carbonate are produced in high yields and at high selectivities. These intermediates and the two raw materials (MeOH and PhOH) are completely recycled. Finally, this process decreases carbon dioxide use by 1730 tons per 10,000 tons of polycarbonate. Furthermore, this process has two more excellent characteristics. One is that the byproduct of the ethylene oxide manufacturing process, i.e., carbon dioxide produced by the oxidation of ethylene with oxygen, is used in this process. The other is that a diphenyl carbonate production process proceeds in a series of reactions from dimethyl carbonate to diphenyl carbonate, and the separation processes of methanol, methylphenyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate and diphenyl carbonate are performed in the two distillation towers, as shown in Fig. 1 [12]. This process is already in use in Taiwan, Korea, Russia and Saudi Arabia and produces 605 thousand tons of polycarbonate per year throughout the world, as shown in Table 9 [10,12]. The process decreases carbon dioxide use by 105 thousand tons per year. Furthermore, this process could decrease carbon dioxide use by more than 800 thousand tons per year if all of the polycarbonate produced was made through this process [11,12,148–150]."
7,Coupling reactions of oxetanes with carbon dioxide,"2.6 Coupling reactions of oxetanes with carbon dioxide An earlier review [3] reported that the reaction of oxetane with carbon dioxide in the presence of Bu2SnI2 as a catalyst gave polycarbonate, while the reaction with Bu2SnI-HMPA yielded a cyclic trimethylene carbonate in place of the polycarbonate, as shown in Eq. (17) [151]. (17) Recently, Darensbourg et al. [19,152–154] reported the reaction of oxetane with a transition metal compound catalyst. A major difference between the two copolymerization processes is that five-membered cyclic carbonates made from epoxides and carbon dioxide are thermodynamically more stable than the copolymer, whereas six-membered cyclic carbonates are thermodynamically less stable than their ring-opened polymer, as shown in Eq. (18) as described in Eqs. (15) and (16). (18) The (salen)CrCl/[PPN]N3 catalyst is effective for catalyzing the ring-opening polymerization of the trimethylene carbonate, and the copolymerization of oxetane with carbon dioxide gives a poly(trimethylene carbonate), as shown in Eq. (19) [153]. (19) The free energies of activation at 110°C for the two processes, i.e., the ring-opening polymerization of trimethylene carbonate and enchainment of oxetane and carbon dioxide, were 101.9 and 107.6kJmol−1, respectively, as shown in Scheme 5 [153,154]. A notable difference in the composition of the polymeric product from the two processes is that the ring-opening polymerization of the trimethylene carbonate leads to a polycarbonate without ether linkages, whereas the enchainment of oxetane and carbon dioxide results in ether linkages of up to 10%, depending on the catalyst system [153,154]. The two processes are energetically quite similar. Hence, the formation of polycarbonate from the oxetane and carbon dioxide coupling reaction could be occurring via two different or concurrent pathways, i.e., the intermediacy of trimethylene carbonate formation and subsequent polymerization (B) or the direct enchainment of oxetane and carbon dioxide (A). For example, the salen CrBr/n-BuNBr catalyst system operating at the lower temperature of 70°C, which is lower than the normally employed temperature, gave a copolymer having >99% carbonate linkages [154]."
8,Nitrogen-containing compounds,
9,Introduction,"3.1 Introduction Nitrogen atoms in nitrogen-containing compounds such as ammonia, amines and aziridines are also reactive, similar to oxygen atoms. Therefore, the reactions of nitrogen-containing compounds with carbon dioxide easily proceed in a manner similar to the reactions of oxygen-containing compounds. Urea, which is a reaction product between reactive ammonia and carbon dioxide, is the only industrially utilized nitrogen-containing compound and the organic chemical associated with carbon dioxide that is produced in the largest amount. The production amount was estimated to be 157 million tons in 2010 by the International Fertilization Industry [7]. Other representative nitrogen-containing compounds are carbamic acid esters, oxazolidinones and polyurethanes. These chemicals are prepared by the four reaction processes shown in Eqs. (20)–(23). The carbamic acid esters are prepared by the reaction of amines with carbon dioxide followed by reactions with alcohols, as shown in Eq. (20). The aziridines are nitrogen compounds equivalent to the oxygen-containing epoxides. Reactions of aziridines with carbon dioxide give two kinds of oxazolidinones, as shown in Eq. (21). These heterocyclic compounds are also synthesized by the reaction of aminoglycidyl compounds, as shown in Eq. (22). The reaction of aziridines with carbon dioxide also gives polyurethanes under certain reaction conditions and with certain catalysts, as shown in Eq. (23). Recently, Barzagli et al. [155] reported on the capture of carbon dioxide by ammonia in both aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. The ammonium carbamate produced was used to make urea in 45–54% yields (with respect to carbamate) in the presence of Cu(II) and Zn(II) catalysts. (20) RNH 2 + CO 2 ⟶ base RNHCOOH ⟶ R ′ OH RNHCOOR ′ (21) (22) (23)"
10,Ureas,"3.2 Ureas Urea is industrially manufactured by the reaction of carbon dioxide with ammonia (molar ratio 1:2). However, other ureas are prepared by the reaction of carbon dioxide with twofold molar ratios of amines. For example, benzylamine was treated with carbon dioxide to form carbamic acid (compound 13) in situ. The carbamic acid was then dehydrated with the Mitsunobu reagent (PBu3 and DBAD) to yield an intermediate isocyanate (compound 14), which was condensed with a corresponding building block amine to form the desired urea (compound 15) at a high yield, as shown in Eq. (24) [156]. (24) Fuchter et al. [159a] achieved the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical ureas simply by heating the silylamines in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). For example, carbamates were easily synthesized by the reaction of silylamines in scCO2 at a lower temperature, e.g., 40°C, as shown in Eq. (25). At a higher temperature, the symmetrical urea is easily synthesized by a reaction with another molecule of an amine, as shown in Eq. (26). With N,O-bis-trimethylsilylacetamide (SBA), an unsymmetrical urea is easily synthesized, as shown in Eq. (27). (25) ( n -C 6 H 13 ) HN-TMS ⟶ CO 2 125 bar 40 ° C , 18 h scCO 2 ( n -C 6 H 13 ) HNCOOTMS conversion 92 % isolated yield 82 % (26) (27) Other interesting articles have been published on the synthesis of symmetrical urea compounds via base catalysis [159b], synthesis in the absence of catalyst and solvent [159c] and synthesis with functional ionic liquid as the catalyst [159d]."
11,Carbamic acid esters,"3.3 Carbamic acid esters Amines react with carbon dioxide to give carbamic acids, as shown in Eq. (20). Carbamic acid esters are prepared by reactions with alcohols, halides and diazomethanes, as shown in Scheme 6 . These carbamic acid esters are easily prepared at high yields by reaction with alcohols, organic halides and diazomethane, as shown in Eqs. (28) [156], (29) [15,32,160a] and (30) [160b], respectively. Carbon dioxide can also react with various amines to give corresponding products. For example, carbon dioxide and amines can form β-oxopropylcarbamates [159], (9-anthryl)alkylcarbamic acids by the photoreactions [160], methyl N-phenyl carbamates [161], arylalkylamine carbamates [160b] and isocyanates via methyl N-phenyl carbamates [162], carbamoyl azides from primary amines [163], quinazoline-2,4(1H, 3H)-diones from 2-aminobenzonitrile [164] and benzoxazinones from benzylidenemethylamines [167a]. De Vos et al. [167b] reported on the green synthesis of carbamates from carbon dioxide, amines and alcohols, a halogen-free way starting from inexpensive and readily available reagents resulting in a good yield under mild reaction conditions, even in the absence of dehydrating agents. (28) (29) PhNH 2 + CO 2 ( 3.4 bar ) + BuBr ⟶ 80 ° C , 4 h Ti-SBA- 15 - ( CH 2 ) 3 -NHR phNHCOO-Bu 89 % yield (30)"
12,Oxazolidinones,"3.4 Oxazolidinones The oxazolidinones, shown in Eq. (31), are prepared by reactions with aziridines, corresponding to epoxides in oxygen-containing compounds, and various kinds of catalysts. These catalysts are alkali metal halides [166], ammonium halide [166], a quaternary ammonium halide functionalized polyethylene glycol [167], zirconyl chloride [168], ionic liquids based on a symmetric tetraalkyl ammonium salt [169], Lewis basic ionic liquids [170] and α-amino acids [171]. These reactions occur at high yields (Eqs. (31)–(35)). (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) These reactions yield small amounts of 2,5-diphenyl-piperazine and 2,3-diphenyl-piperazine as by-products, as shown in Eq. (33) [168]. The hybrid reaction system composed of scCO2 and room temperature ionic liquid based on symmetric tetraalkyl ammonium salts can effectively promote carbon dioxide fixation from aziridine to 2-oxazolidinone at high yields and with high TOF values, as shown in Eq. (34) [169]. The oxazolidinones are also prepared by reactions with propargyl amines, as shown in Eq. (22). The products are easily prepared in the presence of silver salts or tetraalkylammonium salts and can even be prepared in the absence of any metal compound or base catalyst because the propargyl amines are very reactive substrates. The reactions in the presence of silver salts [172], direct electrolysis in the solution of MeCN and Et4NPF6 containing the propargylamine and carbon dioxide [173] and the reaction of propargylic amines with carbon dioxide under supercritical conditions proceed even in the absence of any metal or base catalyst [174]; these reactions are shown in Eqs. (36)–(38), respectively. (36) (37) (38) Furthermore, both the reaction of propargyl alcohols with amines [175,176] and the reaction of alkynes and aldehydes with primary amines [177] give oxazolidinones. Copper halides are used as catalysts for these reactions, as shown in Eqs. (39) and (40). (39) (40) Some aminoalcohols, such as norephedrine, also give oxazolidinones by reaction with carbon dioxide in acetonitrile in the presence of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2-phenylguanidine (PhTMG) as a base, as shown in Eq. (41) [178]. (41)"
13,Polyurethanes,"3.5 Polyurethanes The reactions of aziridines with carbon dioxide, as shown in Eqs. (21) and (31)–(35), give heterocyclic products, i.e., oxazolidinones. However, under high temperatures and high pressures, the reactions yield polyurethanes. For example, the reaction of 2-methylaziridine is shown in Eq. (42) [179–181]. (42) The reactions of biscyclic carbonates with diamines also give polyurethanes. The biscyclic carbonates are prepared by the reaction of bisepoxide with carbon dioxide. Furthermore, a poly(hydroxyurethane) can be prepared from a commercially available bisepoxide with carbon dioxide and diamine without performing the purification of a biscyclic carbonate. The poly(hydroxyurethane) converts into polyurethane derivatives with commercially available substances, as shown in Scheme 7 [182]. These poly(hydroxyurethane) and polyurethane compounds may be used for adhesives, paints, fibers and impact-absorbing materials [78,182,183]."
14,Carbon–carbon unsaturated hydrocarbons,
15,Introduction,"4.1 Introduction Carbon–carbon unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as aryl compounds, alkynes, allenes, alkenes, and allyl compounds, can react with carbon dioxide. The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction is the most famous named reaction with carbon dioxide. Phenol sodium salt reacts with carbon dioxide to afford an ortho-derivative, as shown in Eq. (43). (43) The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction was developed in 1860 by Kolbe, and the yield was improved under reaction conditions at 125°C and 4–7atm carbon dioxide pressure in 1885 by Schmitt [184]. Acetylsalicylic acid, which was produced by the reaction of salicylic acid with acetic anhydride, appeared on the market as aspirin, which is an antipyretic–analgesic agent. Recently, it was found useful for the prevention of cerebral infarction and as a heart medicine because of its antithrombotic action; 16,000 ton per year are manufactured in the United States of America [13]. The reactions of aryl compounds under carbon dioxide pressure at a high temperature give aryl carboxylic acids. Reactions with alkynes, allenes, alkenes and allyl halides give lactones and the corresponding carboxylic derivatives [3]."
16,Aryl carboxylic acids,"4.2 Aryl carboxylic acids 4.2.1 Introduction The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction is the carboxylation of phenol compounds, as shown above. The four types of reactions are as follows:(1) substitution at ortho and para positions, (2) insertion into an aryl-metal bond, (3) transmetalation of aryl boron compounds, and (4) substitution via cyclometalation. 4.2.2 Substitution Kirimura et al. [185] confirmed that p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) was produced from the carboxylation of m-aminophenol by a reversible salicylic acid decarboxylase found in the yeast Trichosporon moniliiforme WU-0401. An enzymatic Kolbe–Schmitt reaction in aqueous solution is shown in Eq. (44). (44) Moreover, 70mM PAS was produced at 30°C in 15h with a conversion yield of 70% (mol/mol, m-AP:100mM) through a whole-cell reaction with an F195Y mutant, which is a recombinant E. coli cell. PAS is used as an antituberculous agent [185]. p-Aryl carboxylic acids are prepared by the substitution of X groups in ArX (X=Br, ZnBr, ZnI, TMS) [186–189]. For example, the substitution of an arylzinc iodide proceeds with carbon dioxide to give its benzoic acid derivative in a high yield, as shown in Eq. (45) [186]. (45) 4.2.3 Insertion Carbon dioxide is easily inserted into the bond between a metal and an aryl carbon atom in an aryl metal compound. For example, in the reaction of lithiophenyl isocyanide with carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide inserts into the bond between the lithium and phenyl carbon atom, followed by cyclization together with the isocyano group, finally yielding isatoic anhydride, as shown in Eq. (46) [190]. (46) 4.2.4 Transmetalation Arylboronic esters easily give carboxylic acids by transmetalation with metal compounds, e.g., copper [191,192] and rhodium compounds [193,194]. For example, the copper catalyzed carboxylation reaction of arylboronic esters proceeds smoothly under carbon dioxide to give the corresponding carboxylic acids in high yields, as shown in Eq. (47) [191]. (47) 4.2.5 Via cyclometalation The author has studied cyclometalations since 1965 and reported on it in reviews [195] and monographs [196]. The substitution reactions in cyclometalation easily form five-membered ring intermediates, each having a metal atom. The metal atoms are active centers in the intermediates. Hence, the active metal atoms easily react with carbon dioxide to give carboxylic acid derivatives. For example, the cyclometalation of 2-phenylpyridine as a substrate in the presence of a rhodium compound easily proceeds to give the five-membered ring rhodium intermediate. Carbon dioxide can be inserted into the rhodium–phenyl carbon bond, and a methyl ester is formed with TMSCH2N2 from rhodium and a carboxylate, as shown in Eq. (48) [197]. (48) Substrates, such as 2-phenylpyridine, are shown in Table 10 [197n]. These substrates easily form the corresponding five-membered rings, having an active metal–carbon bond. The insertions of carbon dioxide into bonds between many kinds of metals and carbon atoms proceed to form carboxylic acid derivatives, as shown in Eq. (48). Some of the insertions of carbon dioxide into the metal–carbon bonds proceed as shown in Eq. (46) (Li) and Eq. (54) (Ni). 4.2.6 Carboxylation of heteroaryl compounds The carboxylation of heteroaryl compounds proceeds similarly to that of aryl compounds, as shown in Eqs. (44)–(48) [198–201]. For example, the carboxylation of aromatic heterocyclic compounds such as oxazoles, thiazoles and oxadiazoles proceeds with Cs2CO3 as a base, as shown in Eq. (49) [198]. (49)"
17,Other carboxylic acids and esters,"4.3 Other carboxylic acids and esters Carboxylation with other carbon–carbon unsaturated compounds, such as alkynes [202–207], allenes [208–211] and alkenes [212–217], easily proceeds similarly to the aryl compound reactions described above. These reactions proceed in the presence of both transition metal compounds such as Ni, Rh, Pd, Cu and Au compounds and main group metal compounds such as Li, B, Zn and Al compounds as catalysts. Representative examples of alkynes, allenes, dienes and alkenes are shown in Eqs. (50)–(53) [202,208,212,213]. (50) (51) (52) (53) In the carboxylation of enyne compounds in the presence of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the cyclization proceeds in the presence of a nickel catalyst and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), and the hydrolysis of the resulting mixture followed by a treatment with diazomethane gives the carboxylative cyclization product, as shown in Eq. (54) [218]. (54) Arylboronic esters easily give carboxylic acids by transmetalation with metal compounds, as shown in Eq. (47). However, these reactions can also proceed with vinyl compounds, as shown in Eq. (55) [192]. (55)"
18,Lactones,"4.4 Lactones The reactions of carbon–carbon unsaturated compounds, such as alkynes, allenes, dienes and alkenes, yield carboxylic acids, as shown in Eqs. (50)–(53). Because both unsaturated compounds and carbon dioxide have unsaturated π-electron bonds, transition metal compounds easily form π-complexes with these compounds. Therefore, cyclocarboxylation proceeds by the coupling reactions of these π-coordination bonds at the transition metal. An earlier review [3] reported that the cyclocarboxylation of two acetylenes, two allenes, two dienes and two diynes with carbon dioxide forms various kinds of five- or six-membered lactones, occurring at high temperatures with transition metal catalysts, especially Ni and Pd compounds. Recently, reactions with two dienes and Pd catalysts [219–221], two acetylenes with silver catalysts [222,223], and [3+2] cycloaddition of 2-trimethylsilylmethyl-2-propyl acetate with Pd catalysts [224] have been reported. For example, Behr et al. [219–221] reported that a δ-lactone was obtained by the reaction of butadiene with carbon dioxide with the catalyst system Pd(acac)2/PPh3, as shown in Eq. (56). (56) This reaction was intensively investigated and finally optimized and developed to a mini-plant scale by Behr et al. [220]. The selectivity for the δ-lactone was increased by approximately 95% by recycling by-products, and the overall butadiene conversion was increased to 45%. Closing all solvent and catalyst loops provided a stable process that is ready to be scaled up industrially, as shown in Fig. 2 [220]. In the first step, butadiene and carbon dioxide are mixed in a continuously stirred tank reactor together with the selectivity-enhancing solvent, acetonitrile, and a catalyst, Pd(acac)2/PPh3. The product mixture is continuously fed into a thermal separation unit where unreacted carbon dioxide, butadiene and the solvent are removed in the gaseous phase and recycled to the first reactor. Simultaneously, the δ-lactone/catalyst mixture is fed into a second thermal separation unit together with by-products. In this distillation step, the δ-lactone is separated in vacuo as a gaseous product while the catalyst is recycled into the first reactor together with the by-products. The resulting δ-lactone is a highly functionalized compound and may be used for producing various products, as shown in Table 11 [220]. Some electrocatalytic carbonylations have been reported for the production of the corresponding carboxylic acids from β-bromostyrenes [225], cinnamate esters [226], 1-bromotrifluoroarens [227] and aliphatic halides [228]."

20,Introduction,"5.1 Introduction Another substrate for the synthesis of organic chemicals with carbon dioxide is hydrogen. Hydrogen is also used for the production of methanol by reactions with carbon dioxide. Methanol is synthesized by the reaction of carbon dioxide with three moles of hydrogen, as shown in Eq. (57). (57) CO 2 + 3 H 2 → CH 3 OH + H 2 O The other hydrogenation products are formic acid esters, formamides, carbon monoxide and methane, as shown in an earlier review [3]. However, these products do not attract much interest industrially."
21,Formic acid,"5.2 Formic acid Formic acid is mainly used in the fields of silage additives, animal feed preservatives, textile dyeing and finishing, leather tanning, intermediates for pharmaceuticals and insecticides/pesticides and food and drink preservatives. It is commercially manufactured by methanol carbonylation to methyl formate and the hydrolysis of methyl formate, as shown in Eq. (58). Global production was 610,000 tons in 2005 [229]. (58) MeOH + CO → HCOOMe ⟶ H 2 O HCOOH + MeOH However, the syntheses of formic acid by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide have been enthusiastically investigated with many transition metal compounds and some non-transition metal compounds. The reactions start with the insertion of carbon dioxide into a metal hydrogen bond. High TON and TOF values have already been achieved in the production of formic acid by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide with hydrogen in the presence of Ru and Rh metal compounds as the catalysts, as reported in an earlier review [3]. Recently, formic acid was prepared by the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen in the presence of three transition metal compounds: Ru, Rh and Ir, as shown in Table 12 [230–240]. In 2009, Nozaki et al. [237] reported that a significant breakthrough in catalyst efficiency for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide was achieved in the presence of an iridium pincer compound and potassium hydroxide. Excellent TON (3,500,000) and TOF (150,000h−1) values were obtained. The reaction and reaction mechanism are shown in Eq. (59) and Scheme 8 .

(60) [241–245] and Fig. 3 [241–243]. (60) HCOOH → H 2 + CO 2 The decomposition of formic acid was carried out with many kinds of transition metal compounds, such as Fe, Ru, Rh, Ir and Pt compounds, especially with the Ru compounds [241,245] and inexpensive Fe compounds [242,244] with high TON and TOF values."
22,Methanol,"5.3 Methanol Methanol is generally manufactured from carbon monoxide with hydrogen produced from coal gas and natural gas. Therefore, methanol manufactured by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide is generally not of interest industrially because of the high price of hydrogen. Recently, the demand for methanol as an additive for gasoline and LPG mixes and for the production of dimethyl ether (DME) has risen sharply. The process has been used with the hydrogen generated from the electrolysis of water with inexpensive electricity obtained by natural energy, such as hydroelectric power, wind power and geothermal power. Actually, in Iceland, the amount of methanol production by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide with geothermally generated electric power is scheduled to be 4000 tons per year. The construction of facilities was started in 2010 [14]. The hydrogenation reaction of carbon dioxide to form methanol proceeds at lower temperatures and under higher pressures using copper catalysts such as Cu/ZnO, CuO/ZnO and CuOZnO/ZrO2 [246–251]. For example, Li et al. reported a low-temperature methanol production process in a slurry-phased reactor over copper catalysts prepared by an oxalate-gel coprecipitation method, shown in Eq. (61) [252]. (61) CO 2 5 MPa + 3 H 2 ⟶ 170 ° C , 20 h 2 -octanol Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 CH 3 OH Conversion 15.7 % Selectivity MeOH 78.7 % CO 21.3 % + H 2 O Other catalysts that have been studied include a Ni catalyst [253], Al-based frustrated Lewis pairs ammonia borane [254], N-heterocyclic carbenes [255–257] and pyridinium and its derivatives [258]. Methanol is formed by the hydrosilylation of carbon dioxide with N-hetrocyclic carbenes as catalysts under mild reaction condition such as carbon dioxide balloon pressure at room temperature, as shown in Scheme 9 [255,257]."
23,Others,"5.4 Others Other hydrogenation products, such as formic acid esters, formamides, carbon monoxide, dimethyl ether and methane, are not of much interest industrially. However, there have been some relevant investigations. Carbon monoxide is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide in the presence of (N-heterocylic carbene)Cu(boryl) complexes [259], while carbon monoxide and hydrogen are also produced by the CO2/H2O reforming process [260]. Methane is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide on a Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [261], and carbon dioxide is converted to methane by microbes [262]. Methane and methanol are the main reduction products in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with silver doped TiO2 [263], and methane is also generated photocatalytically on titania [264]. Dimethyl ether is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of methanol [265]. Hydroformylation using carbon dioxide to alcohols is performed by using carbon dioxide as a reactant catalyzed by an immobilized Ru-complex in ionic liquids [266]."
24,Concluding remarks,"1. Cyclic carbonate formation reactions with epoxides easily proceed with many kinds of catalysts, such as transition metal compounds (Table 4), non-transition metal compounds (Table 5) and organic compounds including ionic liquids (Table 6). This is because the epoxides are very reactive substrates with carbon dioxide. Cr, Ru, Co, Pd and Au metals or metal compounds are especially effective as industrial catalysts because of their high TON and TOF values. 2. The reactions of carbon dioxide with alcohols show generally low yields because of the formation of water and the strong shift of the equilibrium toward reactants. However, the reaction with Bu2Sn(OMe)2 as a catalyst and with a dehydrating agent such as acetal and a 3A molecular sieve shows good yields because the tin catalyst is able to put the water into the harmless inactive site ([Bu2SnO] moiety) and the inactive site is activated by methanol and the dehydrating agent under CO2 atmosphere. 3. From the investigation on carboxylic acid production with 2-phenylpyridine, many other substrates (Table 10) can be applied to synthesize the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives by the reactions of cyclometalated intermediates with carbon dioxide. 4. Formic acid is used in the fields of silage additives and preservatives. Recently, it has attracted interest as a hydrogen storage material because of the excellent synthetic method with a high yield and high TON and TOF values. 5. Methanol is the most important organic chemical in this regard. We expect that methanol can be prepared in a carbon dioxide utilization purpose by utilizing hydrogen produced using natural energies, such as electric power generation with geothermal resources, wind or water."
