0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol finds application in the manufacture of resins, rubbers and fibres [1] and can be produced by selective hydrogenation of furfural, a biomass derived heterocyclic aldehyde that can serve as a renewable, non-petroleum based raw material. Decarbonylation (path (I)), furan ring reduction (paths (II), (IV) and (VI)) and hydrogenolysis (path (V)) generate a range of by-products (Fig. 1 ). Noble metals (Pd and Pt) catalyse decarbonylation to furan, hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and hydrogenolysis to 2-methylfuran [2,3]. Incorporation of Ce to Ni–B polarised/activated the carbonyl function resulting in preferential formation of furfuryl alcohol [4]. Taking an overview of the literature, Cu catalysts are the most selective to furfuryl alcohol [1,5–8]. Batch liquid phase reaction has been predominantly conducted at elevated H2 pressure (10–20bar) [1,9]. A move to continuous processes at atmospheric pressure presents advantages in terms of product/catalyst separation, reduced downtime and higher throughput [10]. In continuous operation, Liu et al. [5] reported 90% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol over commercial copper chromite with the generation of toxic Cr2O3 waste. Application of Cu/MgO [6,7] and Cu/C [8] can overcome this limitation and these systems are used as the benchmark in this study. Supported Au nano-particles have shown unique selectivity for –CO reduction in the presence of other functionalities (e.g. CC) [11]. We could not find any reported application of supported Au in furfural hydrogenation beyond the observation by Hong et al. [12] of negligible activity (1% conversion) for Au/SiO2 in liquid phase reaction at high pressure (10bar). We should note the work of Ohyama et al. [13] who reported preferential alcohol formation from 2-hydroxylmethyl-5-furfural over Au/Al2O3 in batch operation at 38bar. In previous work [14] we demonstrated full selectivity in the gas phase reduction of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3. Here we assess for the first time continuous hydrogenation of furfural over Au/Al2O3 and compare performance against benchmark supported Cu."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation Au/Al2O3 was prepared by deposition–precipitation using urea (Riedel-de Haën, 99%) as a basification agent. An aqueous solution of urea (100-fold urea excess) and HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%, 4.4×10−6 molcm−3, 400cm3) was added to γ-Al2O3 (Puralox, Condea Vista, 30g). The suspension was heated (2Kmin−1 to 353K) under constant stirring and the solid separated by filtration, washed with distilled water until chlorine free, dried in He (45cm3 min−1) at 373K (2Kmin−1) for 5h and sieved to mean particle diameter=75μm. Catalyst activation by temperature programmed (2Kmin−1 to 603K) reduction (TPR in 60cm3 min−1 H2) ensured metal precursor transformation (Au3+ →Au0) [14]. The activated sample was passivated in 1%v/v O2/He for 1h at ambient temperature for ex situ characterisation."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation Gold content was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer) from the diluted extract in aqua regia. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were recorded on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan rate of 0.02°step−1 over the range 20°≤2θ≤80°. The diffractogram was identified against the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. Au (04-0784) and γ-Al2O3 (10-0425). Nitrogen physisorption was performed on the Micromeritics Gemini 2390p system and total specific surface area (SSA) calculated using the standard BET method with cumulative pore volume/pore radius from BJH analysis. Hydrogen chemisorption (pulse 10μl titration at 298K and 413K) following TPR (as above) was conducted on the CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome) unit with data acquisition/manipulation using the TPR Win™ software; there was no measurable H2 uptake on Al2O3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was performed on a VG ESCA spectrometer equipped with monochromatised Al Kα radiation (1486eV) under an ultra-high vacuum (<10−8 Torr). The Au 4f spectra were fitted with abstraction of the Shirley background using the Gaussian–Lorentzian function in XPSPEAK 41 and binding energies (BE) calibrated with respect to the C1s peak (284.5eV). Gold particle size was determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, JEOL 2200FS field emission gun-equipped unit). Samples for analysis were dispersed in acetone and deposited on a holey carbon/Cu grid (300mesh). Surface area weighted mean Au size (d) was based on a count of at least 300 particles."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing Furfural (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) hydrogenation was carried out at atmospheric pressure (at 383–523K) in a continuous flow fixed bed tubular reactor (15mm i.d.). Isothermal conditions (±1K) were maintained by diluting the catalyst bed with ground glass (75μm). Furfural was delivered as a n-butanolic (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) solution to the reactor via a glass/Teflon air-tight syringe and Teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100kd Scientific) with a co-current flow of excess H2; GHSV =5×103 −3×104 h−1. Catalyst mass to inlet furfural molar feed rate (W/F) spanned the range 100–300gmol−1 h. Passage of furfural in a stream of H2 through the empty reactor or over Al2O3 did not result in any detectable conversion. The reactor effluent was condensed in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent analysis by capillary GC (Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL) [14]. All gases (O2, H2, N2 and He) were of high purity (BOC, >99.98%). Furfural fractional conversion (X) is defined by (1) X = furfural in − furfural out furfural in and selectivity (S) to product (j) is given by (2) S j % = product j , out furfural in − furfural out × 100 . Catalytic activity is quantified in terms of furfural consumption rate (R) obtained from (3) R μmol h − 1 = X 0 × F where initial fractional conversion (X 0) was extracted from time on-stream measurements [14]. Turnover frequency (TOF, rate per active site) was calculated using (4) T O F h − 1 = R n A u × D where n Au is the number of moles of Au in the catalyst bed and D is the Au dispersion determined by STEM [14]. Repeated reactions with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered raw data reproducibility and carbon mass balance within ±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation Analysis by XRD (diffractogram not shown) revealed diffraction peaks at 2θ =37.6°, 39.5°, 45.9° and 67.0° due to γ-Al2O3. There was no detectable signal for metallic Au (2θ =38.1°, 44.3°, 64.6° and 77.5°), suggesting Au particle size below XRD (<5nm) detection limits [14]. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. 2(I)) show a hysteresis loop at P / P 0 >0.6 characteristic of mesoporous materials (type IV IUPAC) [15]. This is consistent with the mesoporosity of γ-Al2O3 (from Puralox) with mean pore radii in the 30–41Å range [16]. A decrease in total surface area, pore volume and radius was observed for Au/Al2O3 (Table 1 ) relative to the starting support (SSA=191m2 g−1, pore volume=0.45cm3 g−1 and pore radius=31Å), which can be linked to partial pore filling during catalyst preparation [17]. TPR of Au/Al2O3 (not shown) generated a positive H2 consumption signal with a temperature maximum (T max) at 451K where H2 consumption (Table 1) matched that (1.5molmolAu −1) required for the reduction of the Au3+ precursor to metallic Au. The XPS spectrum over the Au 4f BE region (Fig. 2(II)) exhibited two peaks (BE=83.4eV and 87.0eV) corresponding to 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 levels, respectively. The Au 4f 7/2 BE is lower than that characteristic of metallic Au (84.0eV) [18], suggesting electron donation from the support to generate Auδ− [18]. STEM analysis (Fig. 2(III)) confirmed the presence of nano-sized gold particles (1–8nm, Fig. 2(IV)) with a mean of 4.3nm. Hydrogen chemisorption on Au/Al2O3 is an activated process and uptake under reaction conditions (413K, Table 1) was appreciably higher (9-fold) than that recorded at ambient temperature. The characterisation results demonstrate formation of nano-scale Auδ− particles with significant (318μmolgAu −1) H2 uptake under reaction conditions."
7,Catalytic response,"3.2 Catalytic response Representative time on-stream conversion and selectivity profiles are shown in Fig. 3(I). An initial decrease in conversion was observed with the attainment of steady state activity after 6h on-stream. Furfural was solely converted to the target furfuryl alcohol over Au/Al2O3 (at 413K), i.e. exclusive reduction of the carbonyl group (Fig. 1, path (III)). This is a significant result in the light of the negligible activity over Au/SiO2 in batch mode [12] and the reported formation of by-products over Pd [2], Pt [3] and Ni [19] catalysts. A meaningful evaluation of the catalytic response requires that the reaction is operated under kinetic control, free from heat/mass transfer constraints. These possible limitations were assessed using standard diagnostic tests [17] and the results are presented in Fig. 3(II). Furfural consumption rate increased with contact time (at τ <0.36s, (IIA)), indicative of interparticle transport limitations that inhibit hydrogenation. Rate was insensitive to contact time at τ ≥0.36s, demonstrating minimal external diffusion constraints; τ was set at 0.36s in subsequent tests. Variation in catalyst mass to furfural feed rate (W/F) was used to probe the effect of possible reactant concentration gradients on performance. Hydrogenation rate (at X ≤0.9) displayed a linear correlation with respect to W/F (IIB) and we can discount contributions due to internal and/or external mass transport on the observed activity. The applicability of pseudo-first order kinetics for hydrogenation of substituted aldehydes over supported Au has been established elsewhere [20]. The Arrhenius plot (IIC) using the extracted rate constants (k) delivered an apparent activation energy (∆Ea =45kJmol−1) close to that (50kJmol−1) reported for reaction over Cu/SiO2 [21] and higher than the reported furfural adsorption energy (<30kJmol−1) [21], confirming surface kinetic control (at τ ≥0.36s, W/F =100–300gmol−1 h and T =383–433K). Reaction exclusivity to furfuryl alcohol was maintained over 383–433K (Fig. 4 ). An increase in temperature (to 523K) resulted in higher turnover frequencies (TOF) but with a switch from –CO reduction to subsequent hydrogenolysis (steps (III) and (V) in Fig. 1). Similar behaviour has been reported for Cu/MgO [7] where reaction temperatures of ≥473K favoured 2-methylfuran formation. Theoretical (DFT) calculations have demonstrated perpendicular adsorption of furfural on Cu via the oxygen lone pair of the carbonyl group as the most stable configuration for reduction to the alcohol [21]. FTIR analysis has established benzaldehyde interaction with Al3+ sites on alumina to generate a surface benzoate as reactive intermediate to the alcohol [22]. We have confirmed, by pyridine titration coupled with FTIR, that the Lewis acidity of alumina facilitates selective activation and reduction of –CO to the alcohol at low temperatures (423–443K) in the gas phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzaldehyde [20]. Moreover, electron-rich Au particles have been shown to favour selective carbonyl group reduction in the conversion of benzalacetone [23]. We envision that surface Lewis acid sites on Al2O3 in tandem with electron-rich Au particles (from XPS analysis) contribute to selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol at T ≤433K. It is important to note that Au/Al2O3 not only promoted exclusive production of the target alcohol but delivered a higher TOF at lower reaction temperatures than values reported for Cu/MgO (18–140h−1) [6,7] and Cu/C (65–115h−1) [8] at 453–498K. The higher selective hydrogenation rate can be linked to the greater capacity of nano-sized Au to chemisorb/activate H2 (318μmolgAu −1 in this work) relative to supported Cu (0.8μmolgCu −1 for Cu/C [24])."
8,Conclusions,"We achieved exclusive formation of furfuryl alcohol in continuous atmospheric pressure hydrogenation of furfural (383–433K, ∆Ea =45kJmol−1) over nano-scale Auδ− (1–8nm, mean=4.3nm) on Al2O3 under conditions of chemical control (τ ≥0.36s, W/F =100–300gmol−1 h). Reaction over Au/Al2O3 (at 433K) delivered a TOF that was significantly higher than the benchmark supported Cu catalysts operated at higher temperatures (453–498K)."
