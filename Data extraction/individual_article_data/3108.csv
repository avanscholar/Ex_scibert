0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas, a clean and efficient fuel with the advantage of producing no secondary pollutant, is one of the potential substitute environmentally friendly energies [1]. Traditionally, hydrogen is produced using thermo-chemical or radiolytic methods. These processes are not economically attractive and can only be applied where cheap electricity is readily available. Thus, the biological production of hydrogen using dark fermentative microorganisms seems to be an efficient alternative since organic wastes could serve as the feeding substrate and be recycled at the same time [2]. When choosing a possible feeding substrate for biohydrogen production, its availability, cost, carbohydrate content and biodegradability should be evaluated first [3]. Among the common organic wastes, starch stands out because it is one of the major components in many agricultural and food industry wastes. Starch is rich in terms of carbohydrate content and can also be hydrolyzed into glucose and maltose by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis followed by biological conversion of the carbohydrates into organic acids and then into hydrogen gas [3]. However, the initial hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in microbial conversion; it dominates the efficiency of dark fermentative hydrogen production by using starch. Various factors have been studied relating to fermentative biological hydrogen production including the operating conditions (pH, temperature and HRT), feeding substrates and source of inoculation [4–8]. Since the microorganism community composition in any bioreactor directly contributes to its process efficiency, exploring the predominant hydrogen producer as well as the other co-existing microorganisms is also important, especially for the sake of process stability. The bacterial compositions on different feeding substrates had been reported. For example, bacteria species including Clostridium, Klebsiella, Bacillus and Enterobacter were found to be the predominant community members in mixed-culture biohydrogen production systems feeding on glucose or xylose as substrates [4,6]. Studies were also carried out using pure bacteria cultures such as Enterobacter [9], Citrobacter [10], and Clostridium [11] to degrade monosaccharides, cellulose and starch in laboratory-scale studies. However, no reports have been made on the bacterial community composition for starch-feeding hydrogen production bioreactors. The objective of this study is to explore the bacteria composition in a starch-feeding dark fermentation AGSB reactor. Successful biohydrogen production was achieved when the system was operated at pH 5.5 and 6.0 while the HRTs were controlled at 12, 2, 1, and 0.5h, respectively. The microorganism community structure from steady-state samples was analyzed and quantified using denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The non-culture-dependent molecular cloning and sequencing 16S rDNA approach was used for bacterial species identification. The reactor performances were compared with the information regarding microbial community structure to obtain a better understanding of the fermentative H2 production from the engineering, microbial ecology, and molecular biology perspectives."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reactor inoculation and operation,"2.1 Reactor inoculation and operation Two AGSBs were operated under pH 6.0 and 5.5, respectively. The working volume of the AGSB was 1L and a paddle impeller agitator was installed into the center of the reactor with a fixed agitation rate of 15rpm. To the reactor was initially added powdered activated carbon (PAC, 1g/L) as a biological carrier and inoculates intertidal sludge from Tai-Xi, Taiwan. Subsequently, the AGSB reactor was switched to a continuous mode at an HRT of 12h. The HRT was progressively decreased after reaching a 30 days steady-state operation. The amount and composition of biogas produced were monitored and liquid samples were also taken to analyze the composition of soluble metabolites and residual carbon substrate concentration with time. Meanwhile, all the cultures were operated at a constant temperature of 37°C. Synthetic wastewater feed contained starch 20g COD/L as the sole substrate and consisted of the following components (mg/L): NH4Cl, 717; NH4HCO3, 5240; NaHCO3, 15 000; K2HPO4, 125; MgCl2ċ6H2O, 100; CaCl2ċ6H2O, 100; MnSO4ċ6H2O, 15; FeSO4ċ7H2O, 25; CuSO4ċ5H2O, 5; and CoCl2ċ5H2O, 0.125."
3,Chemical analysis of bioreactor performance,"2.2 Chemical analysis of bioreactor performance Gas products including H2 and CO2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas used argon and the column was packed with Porapak Q. The temperature at the column was initially 50°C and was increased to 200°C at the rate of 30°C/min. Injection temperature was 140°C. The volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by GC using a flame ionization detector. The temperatures at the glass column and injection were 145 and 175°C, respectively. The carrier gas was N2 and the packing material was FON (contains polyethylene glycol and 2-nitroterephthalic acid) obtained from Shimadzu, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) [5]. The residual starch concentration was measured by the KI–I2 colorimetric method [12], in which the starch content in the sample was quantified by the absorbance at 680nm. The residual sugar concentration of the culture was measured by the phenol–sulfuric acid method [13]."
4,Extraction of genomic DNA and amplification of 16S rDNA genes,"2.3 Extraction of genomic DNA and amplification of 16S rDNA genes For the microbial community analysis, samples of bioreactor liquid were taken during the 30 days steady-state operation before change of HRT and stored at −20°C. The frozen and sludge samples were thawed, dispersed, and washed twice with 1× PBS (phosphate buffer saline). The cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 6000×g for 2min. Total genomic DNA was obtained and purified by using the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were stored at −20°C prior to PCR reactions. Two sets of primers were used for amplification of 16S rDNA genes. EUB968F (5′-AACGCGAAGAACCTTAC-3′) plus GC-clamp (5′-CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG-3′) and UNIV1392R (5′-ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC-3′) were used for targeting universal-consensus 16S rDNA fragment [14]. For targeting Clostridium-specific 16S rDNA fragment, Chis150f (5′-AAAGGRAGATTAATACCGCATAA-3′) plus GC-clamp and ClustIr (5′-TTCTTCCTAATCTCTACGCA-3′) were used [15]. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) mixtures (50μL) contained each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 200μM, 1.5mM MgCl2, each primer at a concentration of 0.2μM, 1.25U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA), and the PCR buffer supplied with the enzyme. The amplification consisted of a DNA denaturing step at 95°C for 3min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 45s, annealing at 54°C for 45s, and extension at 72°C for 2min. The cycling included a final extension step at 72°C for 3min to ensure full extension of the product. All PCR operations were performed with an automatic thermal cycler iCyclerTM (BioRad, USA). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis at 100V for 30min through 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. The amplified products were visualized under UV light after being stained with ethidium bromide."
5,Denatured gradient gel electrophoresis,"2.4 Denatured gradient gel electrophoresis Before PCR-amplified extracted rDNA fragments, sequence variations were assessed by DGGE. The DGGE profile of the PCR-amplified DNA was obtained following the method of Muyzer et al. [16] using a DCode™ Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, USA). The 6% (w/v) acrylamide solution was used to cast a gel with denaturant gradients ranging from 30% to 65% for universal-bacteria DNA fragment and 35% to 55% for Clostridium-species target DNA fragment respective. Electrophoresis was conducted in a 1× TAE (Tris/acetic acid/EDTA) buffer solution at 180V and 60°C for 5h. The gels were stained for 10min with ethidium bromide and visualized with UV radiation. The number of operational taxonomic units in each sample was defined as the number of DGGE bands."
6,Fluorescent in situ hybridization,"2.5 Fluorescent in situ hybridization Oligonucleotide probes labeled with Cy3 (MWG Biotech Inc., Ebensberg, Germany), hybridization conditions, and related chemicals were applied in this study following the review paper by Lipski et al. [17]. Several oligonucleotide probes, EUB338-mix [18] for all Eubacteria, HGC69a [19] for Gram positive high G+C bacteria, GAM42 [20] for Gamma proteo-bacteria, LGC354-mix [21] for Gram positive low G+C bacteria, Chis150 [22] for Clostridium sp., respectively, used in this study, along with hybridization conditions and related references. One milliliter of hybridization buffer (0.9M NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20mM Tris–HCl, 5ngμL−1 probe, pH 7.2) was added to a properly diluted cell sample, followed by 2h hybridization in 46°C. For probes that required more stringent hybridization conditions, formamide was added to the buffer. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axioscope epifluorescent microscope. Typical microscopic analysis consisted of manually counting the cells in at least 10 photographs per well from duplicate wells, resulting in total cell counts of 500–1500 per sample. Total bacterial counts were enumerated by staining the sample with fluorescent dye DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The operating conditions were identical to those reported previously [23]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Hydrogen production efficiency and microbial population composition,"3.1 Hydrogen production efficiency and microbial population composition The operational HRT of the two reactors, pH 6.0 and 5.5, was controlled at 12h from start-up. The average HPR, HY and microbial community of each reactor are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. For the pH 6.0 system (Fig. 1), the HPR increased slowly from 0.12±0.02 to 0.84±0.2L/h/L when the HRT decreased from 12 to 2h followed by a significant increase up to 2.0±0.53L/h/L as the HRT was maintained down to 0.5h. Although the HY decreased from 3.64±0.09 to 1.82±0.38mmol H2/g starch when HRT decreased from 12 to 2h, it increased to 5.41±0.62 H2/g starch slowly as HRT changed from 2h all the way to 0.5h. The total cell density in the reactor was measured to be close to 20g VSS/L throughout the operation and no significant variation was observed. About 55% of the total cells could be accounted for by FISH when the pH 6.0 reactor was operated under HRT 12h. This is an indication that the overall metabolic activity in the sludge was low; which is in agreement with the low HPR. Clostridium sp., Gram positive low G+C bacteria and Gamma proteo-bacteria accounted for 28.1%, 20%, and 2.6%, respectively, which means that the two dominant groups, Clostridium sp. and Gram positive low G+C bacteria, were responsible for starch hydrolysis and hydrogen production at this stage. For a system operated under HRT 2h and 1h, the low cell count percentages for Clostridium sp. were measured. There were high percentages of some Eubacteria (detected by EUB338-mix) found in the sludge that could not be detected using the Chi150, HGC69a, Gamma and LGC354 probes. Similar results were found in the DGGE profiles in which multiple unidentified bands were observed (to be discussed in Fig. 3 ). At this moment, it is not clear what kind of microorganisms these unidentified bacteria were. The unidentified Eubacteria disappeared when the HRT was switched down to 0.5h and higher percentages of Clostridium sp. (32%) and Gram positive high G+C bacteria (37%) were measured instead. A third dominant bacteria group was the low G+C bacteria, which accounted for about 10% of the total hybridization positive cells. Comparing the HY and bacteria community structural composition, a positive correlation between the percentage of Clostridium sp. cell count and HY was observed in this system. For the pH 5.5 system (Fig. 2), the HPR and HY variations associated with four different HRT conditions were similar to the pH 6.0 system. HPR was measured between 0.17 and 0.32L/h/L under the first three HRTs and then increased to 1.77±0.41L/h/L when the HRT was down to 0.5h. The highest HY was observed at HRT 12h (5.06±0.12mol H2/g starch) followed by a sharp decrease in HY down to 1.64±0.07mol H2/g starch after the HRT was switched to 2h and then slightly increased to 2.74±0.38mol H2/g starch at HRT 0.5h. High percentages of unknown Eubacteria existed in the pH 5.5 system when operated under 12 and 2h HRTs. The ratios of Clostridium sp. to the total cells maintained between 5% and 11% at the four operating HRTs. When the reactor was operated at HRT 1h and 0.5h, Gram positive bacteria, sum of high G+C and low G+C bacteria, dominated the system, while the ratio of other Eubacteria significantly decreased. The ratio of high G+C microorganisms jumped to its highest, accounting for about 60% of the total cell counts, when operated under HRT 0.5. In the same time, the highest HPR was achieved. No Gamma proteo-bacteria were found in the system under all four HRTs."
9,Bacterial community structure analysis by DGGE,"3.2 Bacterial community structure analysis by DGGE The sludge samples from four HRT conditions were collected and their corresponding bacterial communities analyzed using the PCR–DGGE method based on two different 16S rRNA sequence fragments, targeting the universal-consensus fragment and Clostridium-specific fragment on 16S rRNA, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 . C. butyricum, a reported starch-utilization hydrogen producing Clostridia [24] was the predominant Clostridia existing in the pH 6.0 system, especially at high HRT conditions (bands C-1 and C-2 in Fig. 3b). An unidentified Clostridium sp. (band C-3 in Fig. 3b), comparing its sequence to the gene database returned no significant match, also existed in the pH 6.0 reactor when operated at HRTs 2, 1, and 0.5h. Other non-Clostridium species including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. (bands S-1, S-2, and S-3 in Fig. 3a) were present in the system throughout the four operating HRTs. It is notable that a Bifidobacterium sp. (band S-5 in Fig. 3a), the only high G+C microorganism identified in the system, was observed when HRTs were controlled below 2h. The corresponding bacterial communities in the pH 5.5 DGGE system are also shown in Fig. 3. A more complex Clostridia community was found in the system. Highly similar Clostridium species including C. butyricum, C. tyrobutyricum and unidentified Clostridium sp. were all present in the first three HRT operations. However, when operated at HRT 0.5h, most of the other Clostridia disappeared, possibly being washed out. Only one Clostridium sp. (band C-6), whose DNA sequence matched with Clostridium sp. B904-4 or C. pasteurianum strain CGS5 listed in the GeneBank database existed. Other bacterial species including Streptococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Dialister sp. and other non-identity bands were present throughout the four HRT operations. As in the pH 6.0 reactor, Bifidobacterium sp. was observed after switching the HRT down to 1h and 0.5h."
10,Soluble metabolites,"3.3 Soluble metabolites Table 2 reveals the starch consumption, production of main VFAs and alcohol associated with the HRT in two systems. The ratio of starch hydrolysis was in general over 90% with exceptions for HRT operated under 0.5h in two systems. The lowest HRT, under 0.5h, compared with other HRT conditions, the X 1 ratio decreased to 74.3% and 87.6% between pH 6.0 and pH 5.0 in the respective systems, indicating that there was not enough time for starch hydrolysis via the high dilution rate. The remnants of the reduced sugars (X2) in the effluent were lower, over 0.2g/L under 12h of HRT in both systems, but increased with decreasing HRT. High X2 presented 11.1g/L at pH 6.0 and 9.4g/L at pH 5.5 in systems under 0.5h and 1h of HRT, respectively. This indicated that a lot of residual carbon substrate was not utilized. The TVFA and SMP decreased with decreasing HRT for the pH 6.0 system and increased, and then decreased for the pH 5.5 system. The primary TVFA was butyric acid (HBu) and acetic acid (HAc) both accounting for 60–90% of TVFA in both systems. Propionic acid (HPr) and ethanol are considered unfavorable metabolites for H2 production [25,26]. However, from this study, HPr was found at a high level even when the system was at low HRT condition. In contrast, HPr and other VFA, ethanol was maintained at a low content, less than 10%, during the entire experimental period. Valeric acid (HVa) was also produced in considerable amounts and accounted for less than 10% of TVFA. The HBu/HAc ratio has been used as an indicator for the richness of H2 production in an acidogenesis system [27,28]. Many investigations showed that the optimal H2 production occurred at a HBu/HAc ratio of 2.1–2.4 [27,29]. However, using the HBu/HAc ratio alone seems to be insufficient to justify the H2 production yield or H2 content. Some other factors should also be considered simultaneously [6]. In the present study, the HBu/HAc ratio was about 0.80 (pH 6.0 system, HRT 2h) to 4.91 (pH 5.5, HRT 0.5h), while the maximum H2 production performance occurred at HRT 0.5h in the pH 6.0 system, giving a HBu/HAc ratio of 1.79. All values are not similar to the optimal HBu/HAc ratio, especially those associated with the pH 5.5 system. The relative correlation of the HBu/HAc ratio and H2 yield variant was performed on the pH 6.0 system but still not relative with optimal value of the HBu/HAc ratio which was noticed for previous studies. The HBu/HAc ratio was therefore not a great index for presenting the characteristics of these two systems. Some previous investigations noticed that a shorter HRT could lead to propionate production reduction in anaerobic hydrogen production using mixed cultures [30–32] and propionic acid has negative effects on hydrogen production efficiency. Hussy [31] found that an immediate reduction in propionate production was observed in continuous hydrogen fermentation from wheat starch as the HRT was shortened to 12h and high H2 producing efficiency was found simultaneously. Zhang et al. [8] noticed that a significant decrease in HPr accompanied high H2 yield in a glucose-fed fermentation hydrogen CSTRs. From the results of this study, the HPr concentration did not markedly vary with the HRT but a positive correlation between the HPr and H2 yield was found. From Table 2, it was observed that excellent H2 yield came with low HPr concentration among systems operated under different pHs. In the pH 6.0 system, the H2 yield was 3.64±0.09mmol H2/g starch when the HPr concentration was 9.9%, 5.41±0.62mmol H2/g starch for 14.9% HPr, 3.14±0.38mmol H2/g starch for 17.7% HPr, respectively. In contrast, poor H2 yield was observed comparing high concentration HPr with the H2 yield 1.82±0.15mmol H2/g starch for 30.6% HPr. In a pH 5.5 system, the H2 yield was 5.06±0.12mmol H2/g starch when the HPr concentration was 12.1%, 2.74±0.38mmol H2/g starch for 14.3% HPr, respectively. In contrast, poor H2 yield was observed with high concentration HPr; the H2 yield was 1.64±0.07mmol H2/g starch for 27.0% HPr, 1.5±0.21mmol H2/g starch for 34.7% of HPr, respectively."
11,Starch degradation and bacterial community,"3.4 Starch degradation and bacterial community The starch hydrolysis ratio was over 90% in general with the exceptions of HRT 0.5h, indicating that a large starch hydrolysis bacteria population was active in reducing sugar. It can be concluded that the influent starch did not have enough retention time to be degraded; thus the lowest starch hydrolysis rate was observed. Comparing the hydrogen production efficiencies in this study, the pH 6.0 reactor had better hydrogen production efficiency than the pH 5.5 system. Quantification of Clostridium sp. cells showed that the increasing of its cell counts was in company with the rise in H2 yield in the pH 6.0 reactor. In these two systems, C. butyricum was found to be the dominant Clostridium sp. in the pH 6.0 reactor, while the pH 5.5 reactor was equipped with a more complex Clostridium sp. community. Among the changes in the microbial community in these two pH systems, one particular Gram positive high G+C content microorganism, Bifidobacterium sp., was found to dominate the bacterial composition under certain HRT operating parameters. A previous study demonstrated that Bifidobacterium sp. could have an excellent ability to hydrolyze starch [33]. In that study, the highest HPR and HY occurred when the reactor was operated at HRT 12h and HRT 0.5h, while the Clostridium sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. cell count ratio was greater than the total Eubacteria cell count; around 40% and 40–60%, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the bacterial species that could degrade starch, such as Bifidobacterium sp., broke down the starch into small molecules first and then these less complex compounds were utilized by the Clostridium species for hydrogen production. The roles of other microorganisms such as K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were not clear at this stage."
12,Conclusions,"Based on bacterial community analyses for two starch-fed AGSB systems, a less diverse bacterial structure and higher hydrogen producing efficiency was observed in the pH 6.0 system over that for the pH 5.5 system. C. butyricum, Uncultured Clostridium sp. K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas sp., Streptococcus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. were found in the pH 6.0 system. In the pH 5.5 system, C. butyricum, C. tyrobutyricum, Clostridium sp. B904-4/C. pasteurianum, uncultured Clostridium sp., Streptococcus sp., some Dialister sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and several unidentified DGGE bands existed. No conclusion could be made on whether the diversity or complexity of the Clostridium community could directly affect the reactor performance in these two pH systems via bacterial structure, HRT and hydrogen production efficiency comparison. However, based on the bacterial cell counts using the FISH assay, the viable number of Clostridium sp. changed along with the HPR. It was believed that the viable number of these dominant cells could directly affect the hydrogen production efficiency. According to the FISH cell count results, Bifidobacterium sp., the only high G+C content microorganism found in the system, dominated the bacterial composition when good starch utilization and hydrogen production were obtained. This suggested that non hydrogen producing microbial species such as Bifidobacterium sp. or other starch-hydrolytic bacteria could also participate in the fermentation process in a way that helped hydrogen production by breaking starch down into smaller molecules first. These less complex compounds were then utilized by the Clostridium species for hydrogen production, especially when the system operated under the low HRT."
