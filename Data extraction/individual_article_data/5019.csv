0,Introduction,"Supercritical water (SCW, T c = 374 °C, P c = 22.05MPa) as a reaction medium has attracted substantial attention due to its several advantages over liquid water, such as density, viscosity, dielectric constant, diffusivity, hydrogen bonding, ion product and heat-transporting property [1]. These features make it a perfect solvent for non-polar organic compounds and gases. Reaction can be conducted in single-phase, and higher reaction rate is achievable. SCWG is a promising technology because of its potential utility as an alternative method for renewable resources recovery and harmless treatment. For instance, it can be used to gasify industrial and agricultural biomass waste with high water content to produce H2. Much research has been carried out on SCWG of glucose [2–5], methanol [6], cellulose, lignin [7,8] and some real organic compounds [9,10,17]. These studies have acquired a fundamental understanding of SCWG. According to these investigations, high hydrogen yield can only obtained at the temperatures above 600 °C due to thermodynamic reasons [11]. In order to moderate reaction temperature, increase reaction rate and enhance hydrogen selectivity, much attention has been focused on the application of catalysts to SCWG process in recent years. Kruse et al. [12] have done some pioneering research and reported that hydrogen production in SCWG of pyrocatechol with adding KOH, which is considered as a catalyst, was improved by the catalytic effect on the water–gas shift reaction. This hypothesis is supported by many researchers. In the experiments of industrial organic wastewaters [13], the highest amount of H2 was obtained in the presence of KOH. It can be concluded that addition of alkali salts, probably as a base catalyst, increased the rate of the water–gas shift reaction. Schmieder et al. [14] also reported that H2 rich gas was obtained at 600 °C and 25 MPa that all biomass compounds were completely gasified by addition of KOH. Watanabe et al. [15] investigated the catalytic effects of NaOH and ZrO2 for partial oxidation gasification of n-hexadecane and lignin in SCW. They found that H2 yield with NaOH was 4 times higher than that without catalyst. These results suggested that base catalyst has a positive effect for the gaseous production, especially hydrogen production. The catalytic effects of K2CO3 and Na2CO3 also have been confirmed by several reports. Sınağ et al. [16] gasified glucose in SCW with K2CO3 and hypothesized the catalytic mechanism. In detail, a formate salt (HCOO−K+) is formed by adding potassium carbonate as shown by Eq. (1)–(2). (1) K 2 CO 3 + H 2 O → KHCO 3 + KOH (2) KOH + CO → HCOOK Hydrogen yield depends on the reaction of formate salt with water (Eq. (3)). Then the catalytic cycle is finished by the decomposition of KHCO3 (Eq. (4)) and water–gas shift reaction is precisely the overall reaction as shown in Eq. (5). (3) HCOOK + H 2 O → KHCO 3 + H 2 (4) 2 KHCO 3 → H 2 O + K 2 CO 3 + CO 2 (5) H 2 O + CO ↔ HCOOH ↔ H 2 + CO 2 Kruse et al. [17] also pointed out that the addition of K2CO3 can not only decrease the formation of CO but also increase the gasification efficiency. The catalytic effect of K2CO3 and Trona (NaHCO3 Na2CO3 2H2O) on hydrothermal gasification of natural biomass was investigated [18]. The results indicated that the catalytic activity of Trona was similar to that of K2CO3. Nitriles as vital reactive intermediates and solvent are commonly found in the industry of petrochemical, polymers and plastics, pharmaceutical, and pesticides. Nitriles show acute toxicity with prolonged exposure resulting in metabolic cyanide formation [19]. Such cyano-containing compounds exist in industrial and agricultural byproduct can set off a series of environmental- and health-related problems. Klein and co-workers [19] investigated the effect of pressure (ranging from 128 to 2600 bar) on the rate of butyronitrile hydrolysis in high-temperature water. In their further research [20], hydrothermal reaction (<300 °C) pathways of saturated and unsaturated nitriles have been analyzed. The most of these published investigations have been examined under sub-critical conditions. In addition, little information has been published concerning the production of H2 by SCWG of nitriles with catalyst. In this study, benzonitrile, acetonitrile and acrylonitrile were chosen as model compounds to be gasified in SCW. Their SCWG characteristics and gaseous product distributions with or without Na2CO3 were probed at different reaction temperatures. Correspondingly, the reaction pathway for each model compound was proposed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The reagents used in this investigation were benzonitrile (purity ≥98.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.), acetonitrile (purity ≥95%, BASF (China) Co.) and acrylonitrile (purity ≥99%, Shanghai ShanPu Chemical Co.). Aqueous solutions of the above reagents were prepared by resolving appropriate amount of reagents into deionized water and their concentrations were 2 wt.%, 2 wt.% and 1.6 wt.%, respectively. Na2CO3 (purity ≥99.8%, Tianjin Jinbei Chemical Co.) was added to the solution and served as a catalyst for this investigation."
3,Apparatus and procedures,"2.2 Apparatus and procedures The experimental setup employed in this work was the same one used in our previous study [21]. Briefly, the reactor was a tubular flow reactor (1.7 m length and 12.3 mm i.d.) made of Hastelloy C-276, which was designed for temperature of 600 °C and pressure of 40 MPa. The outer wall of preheater (1 m length and 15 mm i.d.) and reactor tube was packed with insulating course and heated to the desired temperature by electrical heating wires which was controlled by thermodetector. The nitriles-water solution from the feed reservoir to the preheater and reactor was pumped by high-pressure metering pump, and the flow rate was controlled by transducer. After reaction, the products were cooled down in a heat exchanger and depressurized by means of a back pressure regulator to normal temperature and pressure. The gas–liquid mixture was separated in a glass liquid-vapor separator. The gaseous product was collected in gas bag, and liquid product was collected in conical beaker. Before gaseous product was collected, its volumetric flow rate was determined by a wet test meter. Before each run, the residues from previous experiments were rinsed by deionized water to minimize their possible effects on the following experiments."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis (a) Gaseous products. The gas composition was determined by using a gas chromatograph (Shanghai, GC-112A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 3 m × 3 mm TDX-01 packed column; helium served as the carrier gas and the flow rate and the pressure were 18.5 ml/min and 0.42 MPa respectively; the column temperature was maintained at 80 °C and the TCD detector temperature was maintained at 100 °C. The method of analysis is simple and effective for the detections of H2, CO2, CO, CH4, N2, and O2. The content of NH3 in gas phase can be neglected for the reason that the solubility of NH3 in water is extremely high (approximately 1:700) in room temperature. (b) Liquid Products. The residual total organic carbon (TOC) content in the liquid effluent was measured by a commercial TOC analyzer (Shanghai EURO TECH, ET1020A). A high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a UV3000 detector and a C18 column (35 °C) was used to determine the aromatic compounds in the liquid effluent. Methanol(chromatographic purity) and deionized water were used as mobile phases with 220 nm for detection wavelength. Measurements of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3–N) in the liquid product were conducted by individual Merck cell test via the Spectroquant NOVA 60 minpectrophotometer."
5,Data interpretation,"2.4 Data interpretation Data obtained from the gas chromatograph was used to calculate the yields of gaseous products, hydrogen gasification efficiency, ηH, and carbon gasification efficiency, ηC, in order to characterize the SCWG of nitriles. Hydrogen gasification efficiency, η H, is defined as: (6) η H = Hydrogen amount in the product gas Hydrogen amount in the feed × 100 % Carbon gasification efficiency, η C, is defined as: (7) η C = Carbon amount in the product gas Carbon amount in the feed × 100 % The TOC removal rate is defined as: (8) TOC removal rate = TOC in − TOC re TOC in × 100 % where, TOCin is initial TOC content in the feed, TOCre is the residual TOC content in the liquid product. At ambient temperature and pressure, i.e., produced gases, after pressure relief, can be considered as ideal gases."
6,Result and discussion,"Model compounds of benzonitrile, acetonitrile and acrylonitrile selected in our investigation are considered to be the simplest compounds of aromatic, saturated and unsaturated nitriles, respectively. The reaction chemistry of these reactants defines major reaction pathways that can be generalized to their respective classes. Table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions employed in this study along with the results we obtained. We estimate the uncertainties in the molar yields during the gas collection and measuring process to be about 3–5% of the reported value. The temperatures mentioned in the following sections are the temperatures of reactor outer wall."
7,SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile,"3.1 SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile Experimental results of total gas yields for SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile at different temperature are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the total gas yields of both benzonitrile and acetonitrile increased as the temperature increased. The gas yield for SCWG of benzonitrile was lower than that of acetonitrile, and almost no gas was produced even at temperature higher than 500 °C. The cyano-group is the only vulnerable spot in chemical structure of benzonitrile, which is easier to be attacked by H2O as a nucleophilic reagent to form benzamide. The benzamide can further undergo a hydrolysis reaction to yield benzoic acid and NH3. The following decomposition involved decarboxylation reaction of benzoic acid to benzene proceeds easily with simultaneous expulsion of CO2 [22]. The benzene is thought to be the biggest obstacle to the formation of gases due to its conjugated π-bond which could be still highly stable even under extreme condition in SCW. In the case without catalyst, total gaseous yield of acetonitrile was low, but it can be remarkably improved (approximately 10–15 folds at 490–500 °C) by adding 0.1 wt.% Na2CO3. In the case of SCWG of benzonitrile with 0.1 wt.% Na2CO3, little appreciable improving effect was observed. Total gas yield increased as amount of catalyst increased. However, we found that 0.5 wt.% addition was easier to cause a plug in the reactor because its depositing on reactor wall under supercritical condition reflected in the pressure difference exists between before and after the reactor tube. Fig. 2 shows the TOC removal rate for SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile at different temperature. The increasing tendencies were demonstrated for both SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile with increasing temperature. Na2CO3 catalyst showed an improving effect and the catalytic effect of 0.1 wt.% adding dosage was more significant than that of 0.5 wt.% in SCWG of benzonitrile. It is indicated that excessive addition of catalyst may accelerate the polymerization of intermediate products. But it is confused that there is a contradiction between the low gas yield and high TOC removal rate during SCWG process of benzonitrile. The authors calculated the carbon content in gaseous and liquid products and found that the carbon balance was difficult to be achieved. It is hypothesized that char/coke was formed during the preheating process due to the high C/H ratio of benzonitrile molecule. This phenomenon is consistent with our unpublished data about SCWG of phenol obtained by current continuous apparatus. In the temperature range of 450–490 °C, TOC removal rate for SCWG of acetonitrile with 0.1 wt.% Na2CO3 increased rapidly and reached a first maximum value of 95.6% at 490 °C, while that of the other experiment without catalyst decreased to a minimum value. It is likely that acetic acid was formed in this temperature range, which was known to be thermally resistant [8,23]. It is one of the most important rate-controlling intermediates in SCW reaction [24]. In contrast, Na2CO3, as indicated, had a promotive action on the thermal decomposition of acetic acidinto lower molecular products, such as H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. It is supposed that Na2CO3 not only as a heterogeneous catalyst but also as a homogeneous catalyst had a complicated effect on SCWG reaction. Sınağ et al. [16] found that the concentration of alkali metal ion was much lower than those under normal condition, which is due to the relative low dielectric constant of SCW. This means that the solubility of Na2CO3 is low and phase interface can be formed in SCW. The great majority of Na2CO3 existing in the reactor tube was in solid form as a heterogeneous catalyst. It would be partially attached to the inner wall of the reactor and partially flowed with reacting fluid out of the reactor. It is possible that, in this process, catalytic active sites could be provided for the decarboxylation reaction of acetic acid, further led to the formation of gases. The presumed catalytic mechanism is demonstrated in Fig. 3 . On the contrary, the rest of soluble Na2CO3 could play an important role as a homogenous catalyst. Excess addition would also enhance the content of dissolved Na2CO3. It is possible to provide a strong base-catalyzed reaction condition for aldol condensation between aldehydes during the process. In this circumstance, a large number of condensation products, such as cyclic aliphatic ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, and aromatic aldehydes could be formed, and which may be more difficult to decompose in SCW [25]. It is consistent with the SCWG results of benzonitrile with two different ratios of catalyst as shown in Fig. 2. SCWG is a process associated with hydrolysis and pyrolysis reaction [1]. Cyanogen exist in nitriles is easier to undergo a hydrolysis reaction to convert to amidogen and subsequently lead to ammonia in sub-critical water condition [26]. However, ammonia is also known to be a “refractory substance” which is still stable in SCW even above 600 °C [27,28]. In order to investigate the catalytic effect on cyanogen conversion during the SCWG processes, the ammonia-nitrogen content in liquid effluent for SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile is depicted in Fig. 4 . The variation tendencies were complicated, but it can be confirmed that Na2CO3 catalyst had obvious improving effects on ammonia-nitrogen production for both starting reactants. But the catalyst loading effect on ammonia-nitrogen production for SCWG of benzonitrile is negligible between 0.1 wt.% adding and 0.5 wt.% adding in high temperature range. The ion product of water as it approaches the critical point is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than it is for ambient liquid water. So the high concentration of H+ and OH− can be provided by water even without addition of acid and base catalyst [33]. It indicates that the nucleophilic addition tocyano-groupcan be accelerated in sub-critical or near-critical condition during in the course of heating. Here, water behaves like a catalyst under this condition. The base catalytic effect can be reinforced by adding base catalyst, such as sodium carbonate. According to Ding et al. [24], heterolytic reaction involves a nucleophilic substitution step can be enhanced by the addition of salt, acid and base. Meanwhile, the coupling mechanism during the hydrolysis can be inhibited. This assumption was confirmed by the difference of ammonia-nitrogen contents between the cases with and without Na2CO3 catalyst as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the yields of different gaseous products for SCWG of acetonitrile. The main gaseous products were CO2, CH4 and H2. The recovered amount of H2 and CO2 per mole of acetonitrile increased with increasing temperature, while that of CH4 was negatively correlated with the reaction temperature. The yields of CO were very low at both conditions. In the case with 0.1 wt.% catalyst, according to experimental data, CO yield slightly increased and reached a maximum value of 9.5 × 10−3 mol/mol at temperature 490 °C and further decreased in the range of 490–550 °C. This disappearance of CO was likely due to the water–gas shift reaction with the assistance of Na2CO3 catalyst. The conversion of ammonia-nitrogen to N2 was difficult to be observed even at high temperature (550 °C). These results were consistent with our original estimation. The other gases, such as C2+, were not observed because of the quantitative constraint of carbon atoms in acetonitrile molecule. Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen and carbon gasification efficiencies for SCWG of acetonitrile. The hydrogen gasification efficiency was lower than the carbon gasification efficiency. Na2CO3 had a remarkable improving effect on the both gasification efficiencies. The carbon gasification efficiency shows a complicated variation tendency, decreased first and hence increased. It may be that the acetic acid produced at relatively low temperature, which prohibited the transmission of carbon atoms from acetonitrile molecules into the carbon-containing gases. Here, the hydrogen gasification efficiency just reached 54.4% at 550 °C. A possible explanation for this is that a portion of hydrogen atoms transferred into CH4 molecules during decarboxylation reaction, as shown in Eq. (9). However, hydrogen could be regenerated via steam reforming reaction at higher temperature as shown in Eqs. (10) and (11). (9) CH 3 COOH → CH 4 + CO 2 (10) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 (11) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H 2 Fig. 7 demonstrates the reaction mechanisms for benzonitrile and acetonitrile SCWG. Cyanogen as the only active group for nucleophilic addition reaction leads to the similar linear reaction pathways for both starting reactants. Benzene and acetic acid highlighted by dashed frame are confirmed to be the main intermediate products which control the yield of gases for SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile, respectively. Na2CO3 showed a significant base catalytic effect on hydrolysis reaction of cyanogen and amido. From gas yield, the catalytic decomposition of benzene was obviously lower than that of acetic acid as a result of its stable molecular structure. The major gaseous products are CH4, CO2 and H2. The absence of CO indicates that a water–gas shift reaction from CO and H2O to H2 and CO2 (Eq. (5)) proceeded easily by Na2CO3 catalyzed [16]."
8,SCWG of acrylonitrile,"3.2 SCWG of acrylonitrile The SCWG of unsaturated nitrile was probed further through experiments conducted with the acrylonitrile as a starting reactant. The gaseous product distributions are in the form of gas yields versus temperature at 25 MPa as shown in Fig. 8 . The H2 and CO2 yield increased as temperature increased. Na2CO3 catalyst had a significant improving effect on hydrogen yield. A small amount of N2 can only be produced at the temperature higher than 490 °C with 0.1 wt.% Na2CO3. It is noteworthy that, different from SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile, a large quantity of C2+ gases was produced, especially at the condition with adding catalyst. It is possible that unknown intermediate products were produced by catalysis. And the yield of C2+ gases may be attributed to the incomplete decomposition of these intermediate products. The data of TOC removal rate for SCWG of acrylonitrile shown in Fig. 9 confirm this speculation. As can be seen from Fig. 9, the TOC removal rate rose to a maximum value of 82.1% near 490 °C and hence decreased to 51.8% at 520 °C, the higher temperatures are driving the reaction further to completion. It indicates that more complicated intermediate products may form by polymerization reaction in the range of 490–520 °C, which may be directly related to the reactivity of double bonds in acrylonitrile molecules. For saturated nitriles, as mentioned above, cyano-group is the only option for nucleophilic addition reaction. However, unsaturated nitriles, such as acrylonitrile, can provide double bond as another option for electrophilic addition reaction [20]. Water can play a role as predominant electrophilic reagent for alkene hydration of acrylonitrile under SCW condition. Following Markovnikov rule, 3-hydroxypropiontrile is the primary product. A polymerization reaction between the two 3-hydroxypropiontrile molecules may further proceed to form 2 cyano ethyl ether. The both reactions mentioned above require acid as catalyst with high concentration under ambient condition. SCW or near-critical water can knock off H+ with high concentration, which provides a perfect environment for acid catalyzed reaction [33]. However, in the presence of Na2CO3 catalyst, as indicated, 3-hydroxypropiontrile is merely considered to be a logical intermediated product due to the base-catalyzed re-arrangement. Klein et al. [29,30] also found that ether linkage was unstable and easily hydrolyzed to two alcohols in SCW. The ammonia-nitrogen content versus temperature for SCWG of acrylonitrile is likewise shown in Fig. 9. It is clear that the variation tendency of ammonian production was correlated with that of TOC removal rate in the presence of Na2CO3 catalyst. This phenomenon is understandable because the process of transforming from cyano-group to ammonia was also restrained by the formation of intermediate products. The 1,2-nucleophilic addition of water to cyano-group is the other pathway for hydrolysis of acrylonitrile. Acrylamide can be first formed and subsequently converted to acrylic acid and ammonia. It is possible that a portion of ammonia can subsequently compete with water to take part in the electrophilic addition reaction on the double bond of acrylonitrile, further to form 3-aminopropionitrile reflected in the decreasing trend of ammonia-nitrogen content in the range of 490–520 °C (see Fig. 9). This high yield of 3-aminopropionitrile would then present an opportunity for a polymerization reaction with acrylonitrile to produce 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile. This possible polymerization reaction was considered to be the most important rate-controlling step of SCWG of acrylonitrile in our experiments. Our experimental data seems to show that Na2CO3 as a catalyst had high selectivity for 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile. But the detailed catalytic mechanisms are not clear and further investigations are required. Fig. 10 shows hydrogen gasification efficiency for SCWG of acrylonitrile. It can be observed that Na2CO3 catalyst had a strong improving effect on hydrogen gasification efficiency which increased as temperature increased and reached 123.3% at 550 °C. It indicates that SCW can not only behave as a benign solvent but also play a role as resource of hydrogen, which makes it a significant influence on the distribution of pyrolytic reaction [1,31]. Here, the water may take part in the reaction and provide hydrogen mainly via hydrolysis reaction and water–gas shift reaction. And both of these reactions could be catalyzed by Na2CO3. Based on the previous research about hydrolysis of nitriles in near-critical water [19,20] and SCWG of some model compounds with alkali metal catalysts [12–18], the reaction pathways for gasification of acrylonitrile with Na2CO3 catalyst were developed summarized in Fig. 11 . Acetic acid and 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile highlighted by dashed frame are considered to be the primary intermediate products which may influence the final product distributions directly or indirectly. Acetic acid conversion was the final controlling step for production of gases in the whole reaction, which was partial dominated by the thermal decomposition of 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile. As demonstrated by Fig. 12 , there were three possible pathways for the formation of acetic acid. The first was the conversion of 3-hydroxypropionic acid to form one formaldehyde molecule and one acetic acid molecule. The second pathway was the hydrolysis of acetonitrile which was regarded as decomposed product of 3-hydroxypropionitrile. The third pathway involved the hydrolysis of propane diacid with simultaneous decarboxylation. Here, the internal condensation of diprotonic acid was negligible because electron-withdraw group was attached to α-carbon atom. It is found that two thirds of them would be affected by the formation of 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile. Meanwhile, the ammonia-nitrogen contents in the liquid production were also restrained. The routes marked with “(cat)” represented the reaction pathways may affected by Na2CO3 catalyst. Based on the above analysis, Na2CO3 showed a promotive action on the formation of 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile. As a homogeneous catalyst, similar to benzonitrile and acetonitrile, strong base-catalyzed reaction condition had a responsibility for acceleration of cyanogen and amido's hydrolysis in SCWG of acrylonitrile. The cannizzaro reaction of formaldehyde could also be base-catalyzed and proceed readily in SCW to form methanol and formic acid [32] according to Eq. (12). Then methanol may undergo a fragmentation reaction to form CO and H2 as shown in Eq. (13). And formic acid may decompose into gaseous products via decarboxylation or dehydration reaction [17] as shown in Eqs. (14) and (15), respectively. (12) 2 HCOH → ( cat ) + H 2 O CH 3 OH + HCOOH (13) CH 3 OH → CO + 2 H 2 (14) HCOOH → H 2 + CO 2 (15) HCOOH → H 2 O + CO in addition to these, a similar catalytic mechanism for decarboxylation reaction of acetic acid proceeded in SCWG of acetonitrile may directly contribute to the large gas yield."
9,Conclusions,"The SCWG of benzonitrile, acetonitrile and acrylonitrile were investigated in a tubular flow reactor at different temperatures. The gas yield for both acetonitrile and acrylonitrile can be greatly enhanced by adding Na2CO3 catalyst, which may be due to the acceleration for decarboxylation reaction of intermediate products. However, the similar improvement was not observed for that of benzonitrile may be attributed to the stable molecular structure of benzene ring. Char/coke may be formed during the preheating process. The major gaseous products for SCWG of acetonitrile and acrylonitrile were CO2, CH4 and H2. Most of CO converted to CO2 via water–gas shift reaction by Na2CO3 catalyzed. The hydrogen gasification efficiency for both reactants increased with increasing temperature and reached 55.4% and 123.3% at 550 °C in the presence of Na2CO3, respectively. SCW can play a role as hydrogen source for SCWG of acrylonitrile via hydrolysis and water–gas shift reaction. Na2CO3 as a base catalyst can accelerate the hydrolysis of cyano-group. Benzene and acetic acid were likely to be the key intermediate products for SCWG of benzonitrile and acetonitrile, respectively. SCWG of acrylonitrile was more complicated because of the activity of double bonds. It is possible that 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile was formed by Na2CO3 catalyzed, which dominated 2/3 pathways for the subsequent formation of acetic acid. The yield of C2+ gases may be caused by incomplete decomposition of 3,3′ iminodipropionitrile. Ammonia-nitrogen contents in the liquid effluent were limited by the hydrolysis degree of cyanogen and possible polymerization reaction of intermediate products. There was no obvious trend to reveal that NH3 was converted into nitrogen under our experimental conditions."
