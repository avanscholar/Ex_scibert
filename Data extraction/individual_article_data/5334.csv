0,Introduction,"In recent years, scientific study of catalytic steam reforming has been of considerable interest, chiefly because of its potential use to produce hydrogen for fuel cells from alcohols. Among the liquid fuels that can be reformed, ethanol has several advantages, such as its natural availability and safe storage and handling. Additionally, ethanol can be made renewably from several biomass sources, including energy plants, which grow by consuming the carbon dioxide produced during the fuel reforming or burning [1,2]. However, the H2 to be used in fuel cells must contain a CO content lower than 20ppm, because the anodic catalyst is readily poisoned by this contaminant, resulting in a drastic fall in the efficiency of the fuel cell. The production of hydrogen with a low CO concentration by reforming ethanol depends on the type of catalyst. It can be achieved by using a noble-metal based catalyst such as Rh/Al2O3, at low temperatures, but the high cost of noble metals limits their usefulness. Thus, it would be highly desirable to develop novel composite catalysts based on Ni or Co, designed to combine low CO production with good resistance to coke accumulation and long-term stability. Some studies have shown that the support material can also play an important role in defining the catalytic activity and the deactivation by coke formation [3–5]. The most commonly used support for reforming reactions is γ-Al2O3 owing to its great thermal and chemical stability, combined with a high surface area [6]. However, in the case of the ethanol steam reforming reaction, the acidic sites of γ-Al2O3 favor ethanol dehydration to undesirable reaction byproducts, such as ethene. The presence of ethene leads to a decrease in the selectivity for H2 production and to deactivation of the catalysts, since this reactant is involved in polymerization reactions that favor coke formation [2]. In order to overcome these limitations, additives based on alkaline-earth elements are used to diminish the acidity of the γ-Al2O3 and thus the formation of the undesirable byproducts [7]. Moreover, active promoters are usually added to the support in order to improve the dispersion of the metal catalyst and to facilitate carbon removal, as well as to prevent the sintering of the active metal and the formation of an inactive metal-aluminate phase [5,8–10]. Some studies have shown that the addition of MgO to γ-Al2O3 improves the performance of the Ni-based catalysts in methane and ethanol reforming reactions [7,11,12] and that the MgAl2O4 spinel suppresses the phase transformation to NiAl2O4 spinel and thus stabilizes the Ni crystallites. Furthermore, the oxidation of carbonaceous species was enhanced on MgAl2O4, due to its higher capacity to form oxidizing species on the surface; these react with C, reducing the accumulation of coke [13]. Several works report the high catalytic activity of nickel and cobalt catalysts for the production of hydrogen by ethanol reforming [14–19]. However, the rapid sintering of these catalysts generally restricts their application to reactions performed at moderate temperatures. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the activity of the Co catalyst can be increased by adding of small amounts of noble metals, in applications for the catalytic removal of CO and NO from fuels and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [20–24]. However, the data on the performance of such catalysts in ethanol steam reforming to produce hydrogen is scant. On the other hand, while much work has been done on MgO-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for methane reforming, the effect of MgAl2O4 spinels on the stability of a supported Co catalyst has not been investigated in detail. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop a novel catalyst based on Co/MgAl2O4 for the steam reforming of ethanol to produce hydrogen for fuel cell applications. These catalysts should combine the properties of cobalt promoted with small amounts of noble metal, in reducing CO formation, with the properties of the MgAl2O4 spinel support, in reducing ethene formation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The MgAl2O4 support was prepared by wet impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with Mg(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution (molar ratio Mg:Al=1:2), followed by solvent evaporation under reduced pressure, drying at 90°C overnight and calcination at 900°C for 5h [25]. Before the preparation, the γ-Al2O3 pellets were sieved to 80–65 mesh particle size and treated at 550°C for 3h under a flow of synthetic air, in order to remove adsorbed contaminants. For the cobalt catalysts, sufficient Co(NO3)2·6H2O (98% Aldrich) aqueous solution to give a nominal load of 18% Co (w/w) was first impregnated on to the MgAl2O4 powder by solvent evaporation [15]. Next, the mixture was dried at 90°C, and then calcined in air at 550°C for 6h. The promoter metals were added to the Co/MgAl2O4 calcined samples by impregnation with aqueous solutions containing Pt (H2PtCl6·2H2O; Aldrich), Ru (RuCl3·H2O; Aldrich) or Ir (IrCl4·xH2O; Aldrich). As previously, the solvent was evaporated and the solids calcined in air at 550°C for 5h. All the promoted catalysts contained 0.3% (w/w) of noble metal."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical compositions of the catalysts were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), using a Leo 440 microscope linked to an Oxford 7060 microanalyzer, with the samples immobilized on an Al support. The crystalline structures of the catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer using a Cu Kα (1.5406Å) radiation source. The X-ray patterns were obtained for 2θ values ranging from 10° to 70°. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra were collected in the range of 200–800nm with a Varian Cary 5G UV–vis/NIR spectrophotometer. Barium sulphate was the reference material. Temperature-programmed reductions (TPR) of catalysts were carried out in a quartz U-shaped tube reactor with a mixture of H2 (1.96%)/Ar flowing at 30cm3 min−1. The catalyst (50mg) was heated from room temperature to 1000°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The water produced in the reduction was removed by driving the exit stream through a tube containing silica gel. The dried outlet gas was analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the H2 consumption was measured quantitatively. The amount of hydrogen consumed was determined by comparing its peak area to that of a standard CuO sample. A similar procedure was used for temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analyses. After cooling to room temperature, the reduced samples were heated up to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 in the presence of 2vol.% O2/He mixture gas, using the same apparatus previously described. In situ H2-TPR or O2-TPO and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) studies were performed using the dispersive geometry X-ray absorption spectroscopy at D06A-DXAS beam-line from the Laboratório Nacional Luz Síncrotron (LNLS). A Si(111) monochromator was used to select the wavelength. The experimental setup consists of a compact furnace with halogen lamps as heater elements, and a quartz tube sample chamber with ends closed by aluminum flanges sealed by Kapton windows. The catalyst sample was fixed in a stainless steel holder placed in the center of the quartz tube. The reactor was purged with He for more than 30min at 30cm3 min−1, then the reactant gas (H2/N2, 5% or synthetic air) was flowed through the samples (30cm3 min−1) using a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. The Co K-edge spectra were recorded in transmission mode and collected in the CCD detector with 15ms of time exposure and 50 accumulations for each edge. A Co metallic foil spectrum was measured for energy calibration. The spectra for each sample were collected in the photon range energy from 7600 to 7900eV."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The ethanol steam reforming was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor (10mm inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure in a furnace equipped with temperature controllers. The catalyst sample (fixed mass of 150mg) was loaded into a tubular quartz reactor and then reduced with H2 (30cm3 min−1) at 700°C for 1h. After this step, the reactor was purged with N2 and the water–ethanol mixture (molar ratio 3:1) was supplied at a rate of 2.5cm3 h−1 by means of a piston pump. This mixture was vaporized in a preheating chamber (180°C) before reaching the reactor. The reaction temperature was maintained at 500 and 400°C in two experiments, monitored by a thermocouple placed in the reactor, close to the catalyst bed. The gaseous reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed with an in-line gas chromatograph (Varian 3800) equipped with two TCDs and columns packed with 13 X molecular sieve (H2 analyses) and Porapack-N (CO2, CO and CH4 analysis). The liquid products were condensed in a cold trap at the reactor outlet and analyzed in a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890) with a flame ionic detector (FID) and a capillary column HP-FFAP. The catalytic activity was evaluated in terms of the selectivity (S) for each product, defined as follows: (1) S = M P M ethanol where M P is the number of moles of the product and M ethanol is the number of moles of ethanol converted. The ethanol conversion was calculated in the end of the experiments by analyzing the non-reacted ethanol contained in the cold trap, and were defined as mole percent of ethanol consumed per mole of fed ethanol. Carbon deposition was determined as the difference between the mass of the fresh catalyst before reaction and that of the used catalyst, which was heated to constant mass at 110°C, to eliminate water."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts The catalyst compositions were analyzed by EDX at three different points on the catalyst sample, providing the average Mg, Al, Co and noble metal contents. The average elemental percentages of the Mg and Al on the support were 14% and 29%, respectively. This is consistent with the nominal molar ratio used in the preparation of the support, i.e. 1:2 (Mg:Al). The percentage obtained for the Co in the catalysts varies between 18 and 20% (w/w), which is very close to the nominal composition in all regions of the sample. This suggests that the preparation method yields catalysts with the required homogeneous distribution of Co over the support. The amount of promoter metal added was very small (0.3%, w/w), so that it was only possible to confirm the presence of the noble metal qualitatively. The crystalline phases formed during catalyst preparation were identified by XRD. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the CoM/MgAl2O4 samples. The MgAl2O4, MgO, and Al2O3 diffraction peaks appear strongly in the diffractogram of the MgAl2O4 support. The XRD patterns of MgAl2O4-supported Co catalysts show peaks that may be assigned to the MgAl2O4 spinel, whereas the Al2O3 and MgO peak heights have decreased. The diffraction lines of Co/MgAl2O4 coincide with those of MgAl2O4 support and no extra lines for cobalt aluminate or cobalt oxide species and noble metals were distinguished in the diffractogram. The disappearance of the MgO peaks may be due to the formation of a MgCo2O4 phase whose diffraction peaks are close to those of MgAl2O4. Another possible phase formed in these catalysts is the Mg x Co(1−x)Al2O4 solid solution, in which the magnesium is partly replaced by Co ions, adopting the same spinel structure. The Co species formed during the calcination process were identified by UV–vis spectroscopy. The spectra of the cobalt catalysts and the MgAl2O4 support are shown in Fig. 2 , where the Kubelca–Munk functions of the corresponding bands are plotted as a function of wavelength. The relatively high intensity of the broad absorption bands at about 430nm and 720nm in these spectra indicates the presence of cobalt phases in which large amounts of the cobalt atoms are in octahedral and tetrahedral symmetries [26]. The eventual presence of CoAl2O4 in the UV–vis spectrum should be revealed by a distorted triplet absorption band (∼620nm) corresponding to tetrahedral Co2+ [27]. The formation of CoAl2O4 species is highly undesirable since the poor reducibility of cobalt in aluminate compounds results in less active catalysts. The CoAl2O4 spinel structure might be formed in solid-state reactions during high-temperature treatment, when Co2+ ions diffuse into the alumina lattice, and their distribution could vary with the Co load. In the present work no peaks assigned to cobalt aluminate species were found in the spectra of promoted or unpromoted cobalt catalysts (Fig. 2). Comparing the UV–vis spectra of the promoted and unpromoted catalysts, it can be seen that no detectable difference exists between their coordination structures. This is probably due to the incorporation of the noble metals predominantly on the surface of the Co/MgAl2O4 particles, in a highly dispersed form. These results suggest that this method of preparation leads to the synthesis of cobalt oxide species well-dispersed on the support, avoiding the formation of inactive cobalt aluminate. The reduction profiles of the cobalt catalysts and of the MgAl2O4 support are shown in Fig. 3 . The TPR curve for the Co/MgAl2O4 catalyst shows that the reduction begins at ca. 300°C and reaches a sharp maximum of hydrogen consumption near 420°C, followed by a broad peak centered around 700°C. This reduction profile agrees with data in the literature [28,15,17,18], where two reduction peaks, one at ∼350°C and another located between 400 and 700°C, are reported. Although data has been published on the reduction behavior of oxidized cobalt, there is no consensus on the assignment of the reduction peaks. Some studies report that the lower temperature peak corresponds to the reduction of large Co3O4 crystallites to Co0 via CoO [29,30]. Other authors propose that these low-temperature peaks are related to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, with only a small portion of the CoO being reduced to Co0 [23,24]. The Co3O4 reduced at lower temperatures consist of species weakly bonded to the support, since for pure Co3O4 there is only one sharp reduction peak at 378°C [21]. On the other hand, the broad higher-temperature peak corresponds to the reduction of Co+3 and Co+2 species, which are highly dispersed on the surface and interact strongly with the MgAl2O4 support. The addition of the noble metals led to considerable changes in the TPR profiles relative to that for the base material. For the promoted catalysts, lower reduction temperatures and more intense peaks are seen than for the unpromoted catalyst. This shift the TPR curves to lower temperatures may result from hydrogen spillover phenomenon that occurs in the noble metals [22–24], while the increased intensity indicates greater hydrogen consumption during the reduction process. On the promoted catalysts, the hydrogen molecule is firstly dissociated on the reduced noble metal clusters to active hydrogen atoms, which migrate and reduce the neighboring cobalt oxide clusters. Corroborating previous results involving CoM/Al2O3 catalysts [31], the present results indicate that the presence of a noble metal facilitates the reduction of cobalt species. The amounts of H2 consumed in the first and the second reduction process are listed in Table 1 . Theoretically, the ratio of the H2 consumption corresponding to the first peak to the second peak in the TPR profiles should be 1:3, for the stepwise reduction of cobalt oxide via Co3+ →Co2+ →Co0 [32]. However, these ratios are not close to 1:3 for all samples, as observed from Table 1 and Fig. 3. Furthermore, the reduction degree indicated that the cobalt species were not completely reduced. This difference between the reduction behavior of the catalyst prepared here and that in literature [32] may partially result from the different interactions with the support. It is indicated by Wang and Ruckenstein that a solid solution phase formed between cobalt and magnesium oxides, as MgCo2O4, requires a temperature higher than 1000°C for a complete reduction [33]. Thus, the reduction peaks observed in Fig. 3 may be ascribed to the portion of cobalt oxide species weakly interacting with MgAl2O4 and the reduction degree indicates possible formation of MgCo2O4 or Mg x Co(1−x)Al2O4 solid solutions. The reduction degree calculated from the TPR response follows the sequence: CoRu>CoPt>CoIr>Co, demonstrating that the amount of reducible cobalt in Co/MgAl2O4 is smaller than in the promoted catalysts. This increase in the degree of reduction of the Co species caused by the addition of noble metal may be closely related to the improvements in catalytic performance observed for the promoted catalysts. In order to evaluate changes on the oxidation states of cobalt species occurring along the reduction experiments, X-ray absorption experiments were performed “in situ” on freshly calcined catalyst samples in the XANES region at the Co K-edge (7709eV). The XANES method is often applied in order to identify the oxidation state and obtain qualitative information about the local geometry around a selected element in a sample. In this study, the XANES spectra were used to obtain information about the influence of the noble metal addition on oxidation state of the cobalt species present in the catalysts. Fig. 4 shows normalized XANES spectra of Co metal, CoO, Co3O4 and Co3O4/γ-Al2O3 standards. K-edge spectra for 3d transition metals or compounds may involve the X-ray-induced energy dependent successive promotion of a 1s electron into valence shells, higher energy bound states and into the continuum. In the spectrum of the CoO and Co3O4 there is a pre-absorption peak (pre-edge) with weak intensity attributed to the 1s–3d transition and a sharp absorption peak owing to 1s–4p transition, which occurs above the absorption edge and is generally called white line. The pre-edge intensity is related to the symmetry and to the occupancy of the 3d shell. In the case of the tetrahedral coordination, the 1s–3d transition, normally dipole-forbidden, becomes partially dipole-allowed due to lack of symmetry, thus appearing the pre-edge [34]. In centrosymmetric bond environments, as for octahedral coordination, the pre-edge peak is inexistent or less intense just appearing when some thermal vibrations momentarily eliminate the center of symmetry and allows the 1s–3d transition [34]. These normalized XANES spectra of the standard Co compounds is in agreement with those reported by Jacobs et al. [35], who also showed the XANES profile of tetrahedrally coordinated CoAl2O4. Some differences are noted in the feature of these published spectra: it is found that the absorption pre-edge of CoAl2O4 is more intense than that of Co3O4. Moreover, in the spectrum of CoAl2O4 [35] a large shoulder appears in the absorption edge, while the spectrum of Co3O4 shows some shoulders at the absorption edge. These particular characteristics observed in the spectra results from the distinct symmetry of the cobalt compounds. The cobalt ions in Co3O4 are in a mixed environment, i.e. one-third in tetrahedral sites (Co2+) and two-thirds in octahedral sites (Co3+), whereas the cobalt ions in the CoAl2O4 are only at distorted tetrahedral coordinations, explaining the differences in XANES features of Co3O4 compared that of CoAl2O4. In CoO, the cobalt atoms are in an octahedral environment and the spectrum assumes the profile with a weaker pre-edge feature. In the Co metal spectrum there is also a small peak at the absorption edge, which is also related with the 1s–3d transition. Fig. 5 shows “in situ” XANES spectra obtained during the reduction process of the Co/MgAl2O4 and CoPt/MgAl2O4 catalysts. As seen from these results, the pre-edge feature appears at ca. 7710eV, while the main absorption edge is observed at ca. 7725–7730eV, whose characteristics are very similar to those of the Co3O4 XANES spectrum. The energy of the main edge (7729eV) is close to the value reported by Vrålstad et al. [36] and Jacobs et al. [37,38] for Co3O4 and Co/Al2O3 catalysts, and remarkably different from the value observed for the CoAl2O4 edge energy [35,39]. On the other hand, results in Fig. 5 show that the features in the region soon after the absorption edge are different from that for Co3O4 and Co3O4/γ-Al2O3, shown in Fig. 4. Comparisons of the spectra of the Co3O4 and Co3O4/γ-Al2O3 standards evidence that the cobalt species formed on the γ-Al2O3 support is the spinel Co3O4. However, the cobalt species formed on MgAl2O4 undergoes different interactions with the support, and other Co phases must be formed during the calcination step, probably MgCo2O4, which may be responsible for the changes on the X-ray absorption profile. Fig. 5a shows that the reduction of cobalt species begins at 350°C, where a slightly increase in the intensity of the white line is observed. This feature can be assigned to the formation of the CoO specie. As the temperature is increased, the white line intensity diminishes and the spectrum assumes a profile more similar to that of Co foil. The shift of the absorption edge towards lower energies is also observed on the course of the reaction, which at the end assumes the photon energy values characteristic of metallic Co. Fig. 5b shows the evolution of the reduction reaction of the CoPt/MgAl2O4 catalyst where it is seen that the white line intensity changes starting from 250°C, followed by the shift of the absorption edge, differently of the Co/MgAl2O4 catalyst, for which the changes of the white line start at higher temperatures. The XANES features in Fig. 5a and b at 850°C clearly denote the presence of metallic Co on both samples, with that in the promoted catalyst containing a more pure phase. The evolution spectra of the others promoted catalysts are similar to that for CoPt/MgAl2O4 and not shown for the sake of brevity. Fig. 6 shows the variation of the X-ray absorption profile obtained for all samples at some temperatures. It is noted that the spectra of the catalysts at room temperature, are similar in several aspects such as the energy and intensities of the pre-edge peak and the pos-edge oscillations. However, taking into account the white line intensities, some differences are found between the catalysts. Comparing the spectra in Fig. 6, it is seen that the white line of the spectrum at room temperature of CoRu/MgAl2O4 is less intense than that of Co/MgAl2O4, whereas the white line intensities of CoIr/MgAl2O4 and CoPt/MgAl2O4 are higher. For a constant symmetry it can be proposed that the magnitude of the white line is directly related to the occupancy of the 4p electronic states, the lower the occupancy the higher is the hump. Hence, these changes in the white line intensities suggest that an interaction between the Co and the noble metals occurs causing a considerable electronic effect, where the Ru atoms contributes to an increase of the occupancy of the Co 4p band and the Pt and Ir causes the opposite effect. This effect is close related to the reducibility degree achieved by CoRu/MgAl2O4, as seen in TPR and XANES results. At the end of reducing treatment (850°C) the presence of metallic Co is clearly observed from the XANES results in Fig. 6, except for the unpromoted catalyst for which some oxides may be still present. In the case of CoRu/MgAl2O4, a preponderant metallic phase is already observed at 630°C. In summary, it is seen that for all of the catalysts, the cobalt species reduces in a distinct two-step reduction process, first undergoing a transition to CoO and after to Co0. This is in agreement with Jacobs et al. [35], where it was found that the Co3O4 undertakes a transition to nearly 100% CoO prior to the formation of Co0, and corroborates with the TPR results. In order to investigate the extent of reduction for each catalyst and the influence of the noble metal contents on Co/MgAl2O4 properties before the catalytic tests, TPO and XANES analyses of the freshly reduced samples were performed. Since the experiment involves the re-oxidation of metallic cobalt to Co3O4, the results are affected by the degree of reducibility achieved in the reduction step. Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the XANES profiles of the unpromoted and noble metals-promoted catalysts, and it is observed that initially the spectra of the catalysts show the profile feature of the Co0 and as the temperature is increased in oxidizing environment, the catalysts are oxidized to Co3O4. The changes in the white line intensity showed a decrease of the oxidation temperature of the reduced cobalt species in the promoted catalysts compared to that of Co/MgAl2O4. This decrease of the temperature can be ascribed to an oxygen spillover from the noble metals to the cobalt phases. In this case, the spilled-over oxygen makes easier the oxidation of the metallic cobalt. Fig. 8 shows the TPO reoxidation profiles of the catalysts, where the oxygen-consumption bands resulting from the superposition of several oxidation peaks are plotted as a function of temperature. For the promoted and unpromoted catalysts, an oxygen-consumption broad peak appears at about 250°C, but with differences between the peak areas. The highest oxygen-consumption area is obtained for the CoRu/MgAl2O4 catalyst. This catalyst presented the highest reducibility of the active phase and consistently, reacts with a larger amount of oxygen, compared for example to Co/MgAl2O4. These measurements confirm the higher reduction degree achieved by the cobalt species due to the addition of the small amount of Ru. It was found that the order of the oxygen-consumption area is CoRu>CoPt>CoIr>Co, i.e. the same order of the reducibilities degree observed in the TPR analysis."
7,Catalytic tests at 500 and 400°C,"3.2 Catalytic tests at 500 and 400°C The catalytic activity of the materials for the ethanol steam reforming was performed at two different temperatures (500 and 400°C), in both cases using a 3:1 water/ethanol molar ratio. The support MgAl2O4 and the catalyst containing Ru (0.3wt.%) dispersed in MgAl2O4 showed only the formation of ethene as a gaseous product. At 500°C all the promoted Co catalysts achieved almost complete conversion of ethanol (∼100%), while Co/MgAl2O4 showed ethanol conversion around 90%. This confirms that the addition of the noble metal slightly enhances the catalytic activity. Fig. 9 shows the selectivity as a function of time measured for each product of the steam reforming of ethanol on the Co/MgAl2O4 and CoRu/MgAl2O4 catalysts at 500°C, and Table 2 shows the average product selectivity during the ethanol steam reforming for all catalysts. In all measurements, it is seen that gaseous mixtures containing a higher proportion of H2 and smaller amounts of CH4, CO and CO2 were obtained, probably due to the following reactions: (2) C2H5OH+3H2O→6H2 +2CO2 (3) C2H5OH→CH4 +CO+H2 (4) CO+H2O↔H2 +CO2 Unpromoted Co/MgAl2O4 showed typical behavior in being slowly deactivated over 6h on stream (Fig. 9a), while this phenomenon was not observed for the promoted catalysts in the same period, especially for CoRu/MgAl2O4 (Fig. 9b), even though considerable amounts of coke were deposited on the surface of the catalysts (between 2.4 and 3.3mmolh−1) in the reaction time. Thus, it is believed that the deactivation may be caused by oxidation of active metallic Co sites. Hence, the addition of small amounts of noble metal probably prevents the reoxidation of Co sites, making the Co/MgAl2O4 catalyst less susceptible to the deactivation during the reforming reaction. The data in Table 2 indicate that the Co catalysts modified with small amounts of noble metals leaded to higher H2 selectivity than the unpromoted catalyst. It is also seen that the by-product compositions varied depending of the catalyst composition. The Co/Al2O3 data were placed in the Table 2 for comparison. Thermodynamics studies carried out using the stoichiometric method in a homogeneous system predict that the acetaldehyde and ethene are the main products obtained at moderate conditions [40]. Nevertheless, the ethanol steam reforming was also performed at 400°C in order to evidence the contribution of the noble metal on the cobalt catalysts in less drastic conditions. These results are shown in Fig. 10 in terms of the product distribution as a function of time. For the Co/MgAl2O4 catalysts, the ethanol steam reforming occurs considerably at 400°C, and no production of ethene was detected among the products. As expected, the product yields and selectivities (not shown) decreased compared to those of the reaction performed at 500°C, as well as the conversion of ethanol undergone an appreciable decline, mainly for the unpromoted catalyst as shown in Table 1. As can be also seen in Table 1, the promoting effect of the noble metal became more evident in this operational condition, and the values of ethanol conversion was increased in the order of Co/MgAl2O4 ≪CoIr/MgAl2O4 <CoRu/MgAl2O4 <CoPt/MgAl2O4, with just small differences between the results for the promoted catalysts. The effect of the noble metal addition is also observed in the distribution of the gaseous phase with time at 400°C (Fig. 10). Evidently the catalytic activities of the materials in terms of the products yields or products selectivities are not comparables in these plots due to the different ethanol conversion values; however, the behavior of the products distribution throughout the period of reaction (6h) may be evaluated with respect the nature of the catalyst. In Fig. 10, it is seen that the compositions of CO and CO2 on Co/MgAl2O4, CoIr/MgAl2O4 and CoPt/MgAl2O4 changed with the time, starting from ∼15% CO and ∼5% CO2, and after 3h of reaction a decrease of the CO concentration occurred concomitantly with the increase of the CO2 amount. At the end of the experiment, the production of CO reached 2.9, 4.2, 1.2% for Co/MgAl2O4, CoIr/MgAl2O4 and CoPt/MgAl2O4, respectively. Additionally, high CO2 productions (approximately 20%) were obtained for these catalysts. This behavior is an indication that the metallic sites may be acting for both, the ethanol reforming and the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction (4) at this temperature. A distinct feature was observed over the CoRu/MgAl2O4, which the formation of CO and CO2 remains almost constant during the experiment at 15 and 7%, respectively. This profile is consistent with the high CO selectivity observed for this catalyst in the reaction performed at 500°C. It is noteworthy that the H2 production for ruthenium-promoted catalyst is about 63% (Fig. 10d), whereas for the others catalysts the values ranged from 66 to 68%. This slight increase in the H2 contents in the gaseous effluent from the reaction performed over Co/MgAl2O4, CoIr/MgAl2O4 and CoPt/MgAl2O4 suggests that reaction (4) may be responsible for this H2 increment. At this temperature the formation of small amounts of liquid products was also observed. It is clearly seen that the catalytic activity and the reaction products changes with the catalyst composition. The higher reducibility of the promoted Co/MgAl2O4 catalysts is one of the factors responsible for their higher catalytic performance. Another possible reason for the differences in the catalytic performances of the promoted catalysts is the nature of the metallic species and their interactions with cobalt species. In this case, the electronic structure of cobalt may be modified, thus changing the adsorption strength and reactivity of the adsorbates, as described by Kitchin et al. [41]. From the TPR/XANES results (Fig. 6), it was possible to identify the occurrence of an electronic effect, as seen from the changes of the magnitude of the white lines of the XANES spectra of the catalysts at room temperature, mainly in ruthenium-promoted catalyst. It is well known that the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene is strongly favored at the acidic sites of alumina, resulting in low H2 yields. Our previous studies have shown that the cobalt catalysts dispersed on γ-Al2O3 exhibited a good catalytic activity in the steam reforming of ethanol [17–19]. However, the selectivity of H2 was decreased due to the production of ethene [31]. The present findings imply that ethene production was clearly inhibited on MgAl2O4-supported catalysts, since it was not found as a by-product, confirming the prediction that the basic support sharply suppresses the dehydration reaction. However, the formation of small amounts of liquid products (less than 1%) such as acetaldehyde, ethyl ether, acetone, acetic acid and ethyl acetate was still observed. The present results demonstrate that the promoted Co catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 are appropriate materials for hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming, but the rate of formation of coke and CO must still be reduced. In addition, the MgAl2O4 support prevented both the formation of a CoAl2O4 inactive phase and the production of ethene. Further studies aiming to identify the mechanism and minimize the coke formation are in progress."
8,Conclusions,"The performance of Co/MgAl2O4 catalysts promoted with small amounts of noble metals (Pt, Ru, Ir) for ethanol steam reforming was investigated. Results showed that the MgAl2O4 spinel support suppressed the formation of an inactive phase of the CoAl2O4, as confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopic analyses. Additionally, the incorporation of small amounts of noble metals decreased the reduction temperatures of the cobalt surface species interacting with the support, owing to a hydrogen spillover effect. Results of XANES analyses have shown that significant changes occur in the oxidibility/reducibility and electronic properties of Co due to noble metals addition. Moreover, it was established that the reduction of the cobalt oxide species occurs in two steps. The performance of Co/MgAl2O4 catalysts in ethanol steam reforming was boosted by small amounts of noble metals (Pt, Ru, Ir). All these promoted catalysts showed high selectivity for hydrogen production, with no formation of ethene, the best result being shown by the CoRu/MgAl2O4 catalyst at 500°C. These results corroborated with the TPR and TPO analyses, where a higher reduction degree of the CoRu/MgAl2O4 catalyst was seen. A progressive deactivation was observed on Co/MgAl2O4, while the promoted catalysts exhibited good stability, and no deactivation within the time frame of the experiments. Thus, it is believed that the addition of noble metal stabilizes the Co sites, which remained in the reduced state throughout the ethanol reform process. On the other hand, despite the beneficial effect of the noble metal, some coke was formed."
