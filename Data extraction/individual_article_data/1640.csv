0,Introduction,"The fast exhaustion of conventional fossil fuels (like petroleum, coal, and natural gas), and their detrimental effects on the natural environment have attracted considerable attention in the development of advanced technologies for efficient energy storage and conversion, especially for clean and renewable energy sources, like solar, tidal, and wind energy [1–3]. Hydrogen is widely observed as an encouraging choice to replace unsustainable fossil energy as an energy resource, due to its high energy density and zero pollution [4–6]. Water electrolysis is one of the most affordable strategies for hydrogen production, however this electrochemical process requires competent non-precious electrocatalysts [7]. In general, the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate is restricted with limited by that of the corresponding anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the more sluggish kinetics of the four-electron transferring process [8–10], which thereby inevitably lowers the overall energy conversion efficiency. To address this, urea electrolysis by replacing the formidable OER with more thermodynamic readily urea oxidation reaction (UOR, CO(NH2)2 + 6OH− → N2 + 5H2O + CO2 + 6e−) has recently developed to realize energy-saving hydrogen production [11–13]. The urea electrolysis process is capable of producing hydrogen with less energy consumption because of its favorable oxidization thermodynamics (0.37 V) than that of conventional water electrolysis (1.23 V), and achieving urea-rich wastewater purification [14–18]. However, intrinsically in UOR, slow kinetics are usually encountered begun with the six-electron transferal system, and hence high-performance electrocatalysts are quite necessary to promote the reaction rate. Noble-metal based catalysts including Pt [14] and Ru [19] can efficiently catalyze UOR; nevertheless, the aim for large-scale application of the urea electrolysis technique demands highly efficient and inexpensive alternative catalysts [20]. In this regards, enormous studies have explored based on non-noble-metal catalysts for example: transition-metal hydroxides [11,12,21], oxides [13,22], phosphides [23,24], chalcogenides [18,25–28], and nitrides [29] in the form of two‐dimensional nanosheets and/or self-supported nano architectures for alkaline urea-assisted water electrolysis. Among them, Ni-based UOR catalysts are promising alternatives for replacing expensive noble metal catalysts (Pt and Ru), although there is still potential to further improve the catalytic efficiency [30]. Considering the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts is closely related to their electronic structures [7,31]. An important path to boost the intrinsic catalytic activity is to optimize the electronic structure of the host Ni catalysts through heteroatom incorporation. For instance, NiCo-based hydroxides have exhibited significantly enhanced UOR activity and promising durability in comparison to the corresponding single Ni hydroxides [32]. Incorporation of Co into Ni catalysts reveals the improvement of the catalytic activity toward UOR on account of the particular electronic property of the bimetals. More importantly, the electronic structure of Ni catalysts with optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy can also be engineered by heteroatom doping [33,34], which enables efficiently catalyzing UOR and HER at the same time. Therefore, the effective regulations on the electronic structure in a catalyst are of great significance to achieve effective materials including high-performance bifunctional UOR/HER activity, which remains a challenge. Inspired by the above consideration, we synthesized Co-doped Ni(OH)2 hybrid films with ultrafine nanoparticles assembled 3D-networked structures developed on Cu foam (Cox-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF) as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea-assisted water electrolysis and systematically investigated the influence of Co incorporation on the catalyst activity and catalytic mechanism of the Co-doped Ni(OH)2 catalyst towards UOR. The doping of Co not merely changes the morphological structure with a high density of accessible active sites, but also modifies the electronic structure of the host films, resulting in a lower onset potential for the phase transition of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH and inducing superior UOR activity and HER bifunctionality to attain efficient overall urea electrolysis. A two-electrode alkaline urea electrolyzer formed by the optimized Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF hybrid electrocatalysts could reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low voltage of 1.42 V including long-duration durability for 38 h, which provide a high-efficiency hydrogen production system."
1,Experimental section,"Chemicals and materials: Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), deionized water (18 MΩ cm−1), choline chloride (ChCl, 99%), ethylene glycol (EG, 99%), and potassium hydroxide (KOH, 95%) were purchased from Aladdin Ltd. All chemicals were used without any further purification. The Ethaline based deep eutectic solvent (DES) was synthesized according to the literature [35], with a molar ratio of ChCl/EG (1:2) at 333 K under stirring. Synthesis of Cox-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF: The Cox-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF were synthesized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) electrodeposition using a CHI 760E electrochemical working station (Chenhua, China) in a standard three-electrode system with copper foam (CF) as the substrate. In a typical synthesis, the CF (purity > 99.99%) was ultrasonically washed in 0.1 M HCl and alcohol for 5 min and dried at room temperature. Then, the potentiodynamic deposition of Cox-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF was carried out by cycling 50 times of voltammetry scan at 333 K in the range of −0.3 V to different terminals in the Ethaline containing 100 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 30 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O at a scan rate of 15 mV s−1 with a treated CF (1 ⨯ 0.5 cm2), two parallel-arranged graphite plates and Ag/Ag+ used as the working, counter and reference electrode, respectively. The Ni/Co ratio (determined based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis) can be conveniently regulated by changing the cathodic potential terminal, e.g. Co0.20-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF (−0.3 V to −0.8 V vs Ag/Ag+), Co0.24-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF (−0.3 V to −0.9 V vs Ag/Ag+), and Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF (-0.3 V to −1.0 V vs Ag/Ag+), and Co0.28-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF (−0.3 V to −1.1 V vs Ag/Ag+). For comparison, the synthesis of pure Ni(OH)2/CF in Ethaline containing 130 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was prepared using a similar procedure with the potential range of −0.3 V to −1.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+. After electrodeposition, the obtained electrodes were repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol, dried in a vacuum oven for further characterization. Materials characterization: The Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (XRD; MinifexII Desktop) used to measure crystalline structures and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PHI 550) was performed to access the surface chemical states of as-deposited samples. The morphological characteristics and elemental makeup of the specimens were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, NOVA Nano SEM 450), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) system. In situ Raman characterization of these samples was carried out on a Renishaw Invia Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, UK). The Ni and Co contents of each sample were conducted on an induced coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscope (ICP-OES, Varian 700-ES). The ratio of nitrogen to oxygen and the quantification of hydrogen gas were determined using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820 A, USA). Electrochemical measurement: The electrocatalytic performance of the deposited samples were studied with in a standard three-electrode system at room temperature using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, China). A Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH) electrode and a graphite rod were used as the reference and the counter electrode, respectively. The as-deposited samples were used as the working electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was compensated by 85% iR-drop a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH without and with urea (0.5 M). Stability tests were performed by multi-current step and chronoamperometry measurement without iR-correction. All potentials were converted into a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the Nernst equation: E RHE = E Hg/HgO + (0.098 + 0.059 × pH). Electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of the as-prepared samples were tested through measuring the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) by CV treatment at different scan rates from 20 to 100 mV s−1 with a potential range from 1.03 V to 1.13 V vs. RHE. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were obtained with the frequency range from 0.05 Hz to 100 kHz, and their alternating voltage is 5 mV."
2,Results and discussion,"The Co-doped ultrafine Ni(OH)2 NPs with a Ni/Co atomic ratio of 1:0.26 grown on Cu foam (Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF) was synthesized through a simple potentiodynamic deposition approach performed in Ethaline-based DES by cycling 50 times of voltammetry scan in the range of −0.3 V to −1.0 V vs Ag/Ag+ at a scan rate of 15 mV s−1. Co-free coating (Ni(OH)2/CF) was also synthesized for comparison with the same preparation procedure. Fig. 1 a shows the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Ni(OH)2/CF, which reveals that the deposit possesses a cluster configuration composed of pompon-like nanospheres (Fig. 1b), uniformly grown on the CF support. The introduction of Co induces significant structural changes (Fig. 1c and d), where the cluster surface is observed to develop into a highly porous interconnected network structure. This networking open structure not only enables a larger surface area of the catalyst with more exposed active sites, but also facilitates electrolyte penetration, which is conducive to the rapid transport of ions and electrons, and finally contribute to excellent catalytic activity. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared deposits display strong diffraction peaks at 43.2° and 50.4° correspond to the Cu substrate coupled with two small peaks at 44.5° and 51.7° attributed to a face centered cubic (fcc) metallic Ni (green line, Fig. 1e). In contrast, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni become distinctly flattened after Co doping (orange line, Fig. 1e), suggesting that the grains are refined according to the Scherrer equation [36]. The representative TEM image (Fig. 1f) further confirms the cluster architectures of the Co-free sample (scraped off from the CF substrate). After Co doping (Fig. 1g), the bulk structure is transformed into stacked 2D nanoplates assembling with plentiful ultrafine nanoparticles, as manifested in Fig. 1h. Such nanoparticles have a mean size of around 3 nm (inset of Fig. 1h), which are well organized to construct a porous lamellar skeleton. The ultrasmall-sized nanoparticles correspond to more exposed edge areas and grain boundaries, which are possible active sites for electrolysis. The associated high-resolution TEM image (HRTEM) in Fig. 1i, reveal two sets of lattice fringe spacings with distances of 0.203 and 0.232 nm, assigned to the characteristic (1 1 1) facet of Ni and the (0 1 5) facet of Ni(OH)2 [37], suggesting aspecific structural feature (metallic Ni lining with a Ni(OH)2 surface) of the hybrid Ni composite. Moreover, the slightly expanded spacings obtained for the (1 1 1) facet of Ni (0.206 nm) and the (0 1 5) facet of Ni(OH)2 (0.238 nm) with Co doping (Fig. 1j) should be attributed to partial Ni sites occupied by incorporated Co atoms as Ni (1.15 Å) has a smaller ionic radius compared to Co (1.16 Å) [38]. The incorporation of Co into the Ni phases results in modification of the electrode morphology and is expected to change the electronic structure of the host Ni composite. The HAADF-STEM image of the Co-doped sample and associated EDX element mapping (Fig. 1k-l) demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of Ni and Co elements in the bulk skeleton. In addition, the line-scanning profile in Fig. 1m also confirms that the regular distribution of the components with a Ni/Co molar ratio of ≈1:0.258. It is noticed that the Co incorporation concentration can be tuned by varying the cathodic potential terminal (a more negative potential applied favors greater Co concentration in the samples, see more details in Experimental Section), and the different potentiodynamic deposition processing treatments lead according to changes on the catalyst morphology (Fig. S1) and mass loading (Fig. S2), which can be related with the doping effect of Co on the crystal growth rate and orientation through surface charge modification. In addition, the crystalline features were similar for all catalysts based on the XRD results, where the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni for all catalysts become distinctly flattened after Co doping. To assess the electrocatalytic UOR activity, the polarization curves for the Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF, along with those of Ni(OH)2/CF, and bare CF for comparison are shown in Fig. 2 a. The Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF shows a superior catalytic performance toward UOR in 1.0 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea with a low onset potential of 1.27 V vs. RHE and small potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE to drive a large current density of 100 mA cm−2, compared with the Ni(OH)2/CF (1.42 V vs. RHE) to get the same current density. In comparison, Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF also presents an enhanced OER catalytic activity with a Tafel slope of 126.7 mV dec-1, onset potential of 1.53 V, and overpotential of 330 mV to achieve 100 mA cm−2, which are much smaller than those of the Ni(OH)2/CF (Fig. S3). When 0.5 M urea existed, the potential value obtained at 100 mA cm−2 for UOR is much lower (280 mV) than that for OER, showing much superiority to their OER activities. In both cases of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF and Ni(OH)2/CF, the peaks observed at ca.1.40 V vs. RHE for the OER curves are associated with the transformation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) on the surface [39]. Notably, the initial potential of the transformation is highly consistent with the UOR onset potential obtained on the respective electrode surface, suggesting an indirect electrochemical-oxidation mechanism proposed by Botte et al. [17], for which the electrochemically formed NiOOH species are the real active phases for catalytic oxidation of urea molecules. The doping of Co in Ni is observed to promote the generation of NiOOH via an in-situ electrochemical oxidation process, leading to improved high activity. The enhanced UOR catalytic behavior of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF is additional proven through the Tafel plots presented in Fig. 2b. A lower Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec-1 for Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF is obtained in comparison to that of Ni(OH)2/CF (35.6 mV dec-1). These values are substantially lower than those of 127 and 140 mV dec-1 required for the OER process. Such a low Tafel slope demonstrates more favorable catalytic kinetics of the UOR in contrast to the OER. We also investigated the effect of Co incorporation concentration of the catalysts on the UOR activity (Fig. S4a–c). Incorporation of Co results in a notable enhancement towards UOR catalytic performance with an optimal Ni/Co ratio of 1:0.26. According to the corresponding SEM images (Fig. S1), the incorporation of Co proffers inflation toward a larger stacking surface and thus increases the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs, determined by a simple CV method as shown in Fig. S5). With increasing Co dopant concentration, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is rapidly increased from 3.7 to 11.9 mF cm−2 (Fig. S4d). In contrast, the Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF exhibits the highest Cdl (11.9 mF cm−2) and the smallest charge transfer resistance (5.2 Ω, Fig. S4e). Moreover, the mass normalized LSV curves (Fig. S4f) further confirms the superior catalytic activity of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF with more electrochemically active sites and favorable charge transfer kinetics. In response to the pairing reaction, the HER catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts are also evaluated, as observed in Fig. 2c. Compared with the bare CF, Ni(OH)2/CF is active for the HER with an overpotential of 147 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2. In contrast, Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF shows further improved HER activity concerning the corresponding current density near a smaller overpotential of 106 mV, which is also observed to be the optimized Co-doped catalyst towards HER (see more details in Fig. S6). More importantly, the polarization curves of the Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF shows a negligible shift in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea compared to that in the absence of urea, revealing the little impact of urea on the HER catalytic performance of the catalyst in KOH solution. Fig. 2d shows the corresponding Tafel plots for bare CF, Ni(OH)2/CF, and Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF with the Tafel slopes of 172.3, 129.9, and 98.2 mV dec−1, correspondingly, demonstrating the fast HER catalytic kinetics of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. The catalytic stability of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF toward UOR, OER, as well as HER, was also evaluated. Fig. 2e displays the multistep chronopotentiometric curves of these reactions for Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF with anodic and cathodic current densities step increasing from ±10 to ±120 mA cm−2, with an increment of ±10 mA cm−2 per 1800 s, respectively. As for UOR and OER, the responsive potentials are observed to level off upon the current input quickly and remains stable in the following 1800 s, over a wide current density range. These features signify exceptional mechanical robustness, electron and mass transport properties of the Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF electrode. Similar phenomenon is also obtained for HER without and with the presence of urea, indicative of negligible activity influence by urea molecules. Apparently, Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF exhibits much lower responsive potential toward UOR at a given current density in comparison with that for OER, revealing its superior catalytic activity and selectivity for UOR, which offers us an ideal pairing anodic reaction toward energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production. Moreover, by comparing the long-term OER electrolysis process (orange line, Fig. 2f), Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF can give a stable UOR catalytic performance (green line, Fig. 2f), with barely activity loss even after 70 h of continuous electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. In terms of the HER, negligible activity difference is obtained with regard to the addition of urea. These results presented above indicate the robust stability of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF in UOR electrocatalysis without sacrificing HER activity. The 3D networking features of the films remain unchanged after overall water and urea electrolysis (Fig. S7), except for partial aggregation at the superface for long-term HER practice, revealing the robust structure stability of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF under continuous electrolysis conditions. To verify whether or not a side reaction occurs during the UOR process, the generated gas obtained at different applied potentials under a three-electrode configuration was quantified by gas chromatography (GC), as shown in Fig. S8 and Fig. S9. As can be seen from Fig. S9, the constructed catalytic system with either Ni(OH)2/CF or Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF is highly selective toward UOR at all applied potentials from 1.28 to 1.83 V vs. RHE with the proportion of N2 higher than 97% (in all cases, a small amount of air remains in the syringe). These results suggest that the oxidation of urea is more favorable thermodynamics to OER, and interestingly the OER route (competition reaction) can be excluded as no generated O2 is detected during the step-electrolysis process at different potentials, illustrating the great selectivity of the nickel-based materials for urea oxidation. We next turn to investigate the underlying factors that administrate the superior UOR catalytic performance of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF with Co-doping. During the material testing, it is interesting to find that the as-deposited samples, both Ni(OH)2/CF and Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF, are activated with dramatically enhanced UOR activity after 5 times of voltammetry scans, as depicted in Fig. 3 a. Since the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalysts is highly related to the valence state and coordination environment of active centers [13], the evolution of the surface chemical states of the electrode during the reaction process was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the data were listed in Table S1. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Ni 2p XPS spectra of Ni(OH)2/CF shows two main peaks with binding energies at 854.7 and 872.3 eV corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2, respectively, accompanied with two satellite peaks located at 860.7 eV and 879.2 eV [40,41]. In contrast, the Ni 2p3/2 (855.7 eV) and Ni2p1/2 (873.4 eV) main peaks for Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF, is ca. 1.0 eV higher than that of Ni(OH)2/CF, indicating a higher oxidation state of Ni cations in Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF with Co doping [42]. The spin energy separation of the two main peaks of the Ni(OH)2/CF and Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF was 17.6 eV and 17.7 eV, respectively, which are characteristic of the Ni(OH)2 phase [43,44]. Upon voltammetry scans, the high-resolution Ni 2p spectra of both Ni(OH)2/CF and Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF exhibit a progressive decrease in the peak corresponding to Ni2+ (855.1 eV) and a simultaneous emergence of Ni3+ (856.2 eV) [45], suggesting the oxidation of Ni species during the UOR process. Accordingly, the Co 2p spectrum of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF also gives similar phenomenon with an obvious transformation of Co2+ into Co3+ on the electrode surface (Fig. 3c). Meanwhile, the XPS spectra for O 1s of the initial and post-UOR samples are shown in Fig. 3d. Each spectrum could be fitted into four sub-bands, denoted as O1, O2, O3, and O4, respectively (summarized in Table S2). The peak O1 at around 530.0 eV is typical of metal-oxygen bonds, according to the metal oxides [46]. The dominated peak O2 located at 531.2 eV is ascribed to the oxygen in OH− groups, indicating that the catalyst surface is hydroxylated (M-(OH)2 and/or MO-OH) to some extent as a result of surface oxidation [47]. The peak O3 at 531.9 eV is attributed to the low oxygen coordination of oxygen-vacancies/defect sites, while the weak peak O4 sitting at 533.0 eV is characteristic of physic- and chemisorbed water molecule at or near the surface [48]. The relative content change of these fitted peaks in O 1s for Ni(OH)2/CF and Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF upon the UOR process was summarized in Fig. 3e. As observed, for Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF, both the content of O3 and O4 is much higher than that in Ni(OH)2/CF with the course of UOR. It reveals that the surface of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF, which is rich in oxygen-vacancies/defect sites and easy to adsorb water molecules, is more active and effectively beneficial for urea oxidation. In combination with the survey relative content results of Ni 2p and Co 2p, the doping of Co in Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF is evidence to trigger the generation of more Ni3+ in the form of NiOOH with a larger ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ (Fig. 3f), which is responsible for the UOR activity enhancement. To further clarify this catalytic enhancement mechanism of Co doping, the local crystal structures of the Ni(OH)2/CF and Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF during the in-situ electrochemical oxidation process were also investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 4 a and b shows a series of Raman spectra for Ni(OH)2/CF obtained after electrolysis for 1 h each in 1.0 M KOH at different applied potentials from 1.20 V to 1.45 V vs RHE, respectively. For the as-prepared Ni(OH)2/CF, no Raman signal is detected at low wavenumbers (Fig. 4a). The broad bands observed at high wavenumbers of 3583–3665 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 4b are assigned to O-H vibrations of α-Ni(OH)2 [49]. In contrast, the band at 459 cm−1 for the as-prepared Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF can be attributable to a typical Ni–O vibration of α-Ni(OH)2, while the strong band at 522 cm−1 is positively shifted by ~57 mV of the standard band at 445–465 cm−1 (Fig. 4c), indicating a more disordered or doped Ni(OH)2 structure [50]. This is well consistent with the results of our TEM and XPS analyses, which shows Co atoms doping into the lattice of Ni and Ni(OH)2. In both cases, the Raman spectral features gradually change with the applied potential, which is identical to the phase transformation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Specifically for Ni(OH)2/CF, the peaks emerge at 474 and 554 cm−1 associated with the formation of γ-NiOOH [51] when the applied potentials exceed 1.35 V vs. RHE, while the transformation for Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF starts at 1.30 V vs. RHE. Under a potential higher than 1.30 V vs. RHE, two characteristic bands at 473 and 553 cm−1 from γ-NiOOH with a slight shift of 1 cm−1 are visible for the films with Co incorporation. Results demonstrate the incorporation of Co into the Ni film decreases the potential required for Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox occurring, which well explains why the Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF exhibits smaller onset potential than that of Ni(OH)2/CF to drive the UOR. In addition, the catalytic mechanism involves the chemical oxidation of urea to its products along with the electroreduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+ species is further confirmed, where the characteristic bands (473 and 553 cm−1) for γ-NiOOH are substituted by two bands (459 and 522 cm−1) characteristic for defective α-Ni(OH)2 [52,53] with a broad shoulder on the band at ca. 534 cm−1 (Fig. 4d and Fig. S10). This phase change is clearly visible, as the originally silver-white deposited film is turned to black for OER (in-situ electrochemical oxidation) and returned to the original color after UOR (inset of Fig. 4d). These results above indicate that the doping of Co can alter the redox properties of Ni, promoting the phase transformation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH and thus boosting the UOR activity. In view of the high catalytic activity of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF for the UOR and the HER in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M urea, a two-electrode setup was constructed by using our Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF as electrode materials for coupled urea electrolysis. As expected, the cell voltages obtained with Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF couple are much lower than those for bare CF and Ni(OH)2/CF couples at different current densities (Fig. S11a,b). In addition, an overall water-splitting electrolyzer with the same electrode configuration was also constructed for comparison. Fig. 5 a shows the polarization curves of coupled UOR-HER (urea electrolysis) and OER-HER (water electrolysis), clearly revealing significant thermodynamic advantages and favorable reaction kinetics of urea electrolysis in comparison to water electrolysis. Specifically, urea electrolysis requires cell voltages of 1.37, 1.47, 1.63 and 1.79 V to deliver current densities of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, which are much lower than that for water electrolysis, as compared in Fig. 5b, implying the highly efficient performance of the urea electrolyzer. Notably, such a low voltage (1.37 V) obtained at 10 mA cm−2 of our urea electrolyzer competes favorably to those of the other reported Ni-based materials as electrodes for urea electrolysis (Table S3). The amount of H2 and N2 generated were further quantitatively measured via gas chromatography, which is consistent well with the theoretical value, suggesting a nearly 100% Faraday efficiency with 1:3 ratio of N2 to H2 (Fig. S11c). At a fixed applied voltage of 1.80 V (Fig. 5c), the hydrogen production rate for urea electrolysis (109 µL min−1) is roughly 2.85 times higher than that of water electrolysis (38.2 µL min−1). Certain outcomes confirm that substituting the anodic OER with UOR provides an effective route toward energy-preserving electrolytic hydrogen production applying Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF as a bifunctional catalyst electrode. The long-term electrochemical stability of our electrolyzer was also explored. As observed, the Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF || Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF couple exhibits strong durability with a low cell voltage of 1.34 V to drive10 mA cm−2 and maintained stable at around 1.42 V for 38 h continuous electrolysis (Fig. 5d) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, whereas the alkaline water electrolyzer demands a much larger voltage of 1.73 V to attain stable catalytic current of 10 mA cm−2. SEM images (inset of Fig. 5d) indicate that both electrodes still maintain their original structural features, which means Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF can operate stably in urea and water electrolyzers. The high overall urea-electrolysis performance of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF could be explained from the aspects below. (1) The design of in-situ grown active phase exhibits unique substrate adhesion, removing the extra electrical resistance raised by binders, which enables better electrical connection and favorable electron transport. (2) The 3D networking architectures induced by Co doping provide large surface areas with abundant reactive sites, which are not only in favor of electrolyte penetration but also promote accelerated mass and charge transport, and conclusively offer unique catalytic activities. (3) The incorporation of Co modifies the electronic structure of the host Ni(OH)2, lowers the onset potential required for Ni(OH)2/NiOOH, and thus boosting the activity of Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF for the UOR."
3,Conclusion,"In summary, 3D-networked Co-doped ultrafine Ni-based nanoparticles with an α-Ni(OH)2-rich surface supported on Cu foam, Cox-Ni(OH)2NPs/CF, was electrochemically fabricated, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance towards UOR and HER. The doping of Co in the host Ni could not only induce a structural transition with abundant reactive sites for electrocatalysis but also efficiently tune the electronic structure of the deposited Ni hybrid films, which can contribute significantly to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Electrochemical measurements combined with spectral analyses reveal that the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox couple is promoted dramatically by the incorporation of Co, resulting in the generation of more Ni3+ in the form of NiOOH with a larger ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+. Benefiting from the porous network architectures with large surface area, accessible active sites, robust structural stability, and the presence of local NiOOH species with enhanced charge transfer, the Co0.26-Ni(OH)2 NPs/CF with optimal Co incorporation displays excellent electrocatalytic performance in urea electrolysis for energy-efficient hydrogen production. This study may pave a facile strategy for the design and synthesis of earth-abundant Ni-based catalysts for urea-assisted water electrolysis that promises energy-saving hydrogen production and urea-rich wastewater purification."
