0,Introduction,"The accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has reached a critical level since the industrial revolution, aggravating global climate change and ocean acidification. Catalytic CO2 reduction, especially with green H2, is a promising strategy to achieve net CO2 emission while obtaining valuable products. [1,2] Due to the complex reaction network of CO2 hydrogenation, various products, including CO, [3,4] CH4 [5,6], CH3OH, [7,8] hydrocarbons [9,10], and alcohols [11], could be produced under different reaction conditions. To rationally design catalysts with high activity and desired selectivity for specific applications, it is critical to understand the origin of CO2 hydrogenation selectivity. For many decades, great efforts have been made to deepen the understanding of CO2 hydrogenation processes and identify key factors that determine the activity and selectivity of catalysts. [12] Under the condition of atmospheric pressure, there are two main products for CO2 hydrogenation, i.e., CO and CH4. CO can be further hydrogenated to hydrocarbons or alcohols at high pressure while CH4 produced from captured CO2 and green H2 can be injected into the gas grid to foster interaction of gas and electric grids (widely known as one of the potential Power-to-Gas technologies). [13,14] Unveiling the origin of tunable CO and CH4 selectivity is very important to rationally design CO2 hydrogenation catalysts as there are a lot of similarities between the atmospheric-pressure and high-pressure reactions in the reaction network of CO2 hydrogenation. [9,12] So far, it is generally accepted that the binding energy of adsorbed CO (*CO) can be a descriptor of products selectivity, in which strong adsorption of *CO results in continuing hydrogenation of *CO species to produce CH4 and the desorption of CO is favorable for weak adsorption of *CO. [15,16] Based on this principle, various strategies, including tuning particle size of metal [17], changing oxide support [18], or alloying with another metal [19], have been used to control the CO adsorption strength to tune the product selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation. For example, Charlotte Vogt et al. found that smaller sized Ni particles tend to produce CO while larger sized Ni particles tend to produce CH4 [17]. This particle size effect of particle size on product selectivity is also found in supported Rh, Ru and Ir based methanation catalysts [20–22]. Our recent work also found that the formation of Ni/FeOx interface significantly shifted the selectivity of Ni-based catalysts from CH4 to CO. [16] However, there is still a big challenge to experimentally determine reaction pathways and establish a quantitative relationship between the descriptor and the catalytic selectivity. To this end, it is of emerging interest to discover more experimentally accessible parameters as quantitative descriptors of catalytic performance especially selectivity towards the rational design of efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts. Herein, a Ni doping-segregation method is used to prepare spinel supported Ni catalysts with controlled sizes from 1 nm to 12 nm, in which MgAl2O4 spinel that usually used to stabilize small active metal particles, [23,24] is chosen as the doping matrix. It is found that the size of Ni particles strongly affects the selectivity of methane. A series of transient response, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and temperature-programmed experiments are carried out to determine the primary pathway for Ni-catalyzed CO2 methanation. The activation barrier of H2-assisted CO dissociation, and the activation temperature of CO under H2 atmosphere as well, is identified as a descriptor of CH4 selectivity. The descriptor based on the relationship of activation temperature and CH4 selectivity is demonstrated to be applicable to Ni-based catalysts supported not only on spinel but also on various oxides."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Nix/Mg0.9Ni0.1-xAl2O4 catalysts were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, followed by high-temperature calcination. In a typical synthesis, 6 mmol of Al(NO3)3·9H2O, 2.7 mmol of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.3 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 18 mmol of urea were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water. The solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h in an oven. After cooling to room temperature, the products were centrifuged, washed several times with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C overnight. The dried powders were calcined at 750 °C in air for 5 h in a muffle furnace and then reduced by H2 (N2:H2 = 10:10 mL/min) at different temperatures for 1 h in a tube furnace. The samples with different reduced temperatures were denoted as MNAO-T, where T represents the reduction temperature. The MgAl2O4 support was synthesized through a similar method but without H2 reduction. In a typical synthesis, 6 mmol of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 3 mmol of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 57 mL of deionized water. 3 mL of NH3·H2O (∼28 wt%) was then added into the solution under magnetic stirring. After stirring for 10 min, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h in an oven. After cooling to room temperature, the products were centrifuged, washed several times with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C overnight. Finally, the dried powders were calcined at 750 °C in air for 5 h in a muffle furnace. The supported catalysts were synthesized by the impregnation method. In a typical synthesis, the 1 g of supports (MgAl2O4, SiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, Al2O3) was mixed with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 (0.7 mmol, 4 wt%). After dried at 100 °C for 12 h, the sample was calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the catalyst was obtained after reduced by H2 (N2:H2 = 10:10 mL/min) at 600 °C for 1 h. For Ni-supported MgAl2O4 catalysts, as-calcined catalysts were reduced by H2 (N2:H2 = 10:10 mL/min) at different temperatures for 1 h. These samples were denoted as Ni/MAO-T, in which T represents the reduction temperature."
3,Structural characterizations,"2.2 Structural characterizations Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were drop-casted onto carbon-coated copper grids from H2O suspensions. TEM imaging and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elements mapping were performed using a TECNAI G2 TEM operating at 200 kV. Samples for diffuse reflectance spectra were coated onto a commercial whiteboard (Hefei Xingyue Luminous Technology Applications Institute). Diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a Lambda 950 UV/visible/near-infrared spectrometer from PerkinElmer and an integrating sphere with a diameter of 150 mm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained on a PHI Quantera II instrument from Ulvac-Phi Inc. using monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The binding energies for all spectra were referenced to the adventitious Al 2p peak at 73.0 eV. The XPS spectra were deconvoluted using XPS peak, a commercially available XPS analysis program. The Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni° 2p3/2 peaks were addressed and fitted at 535 eV and 533 eV, respectively. The Ni contents of MNAO were measured by X-ray fluorescence (SPECTRO XEPOS) using a PdCo alloy target at the air atmosphere. The average weight content of Ni in MNAO was found to be 4.6 wt%. Surface area measurements were obtained through BET analysis using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ2-C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected at the 4B9A beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using a 0.15402 nm and 0.06887 nm wavelength X-ray, respectively. Diffraction patterns were compared to powder diffraction files from the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD). X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments were performed at the 4B9A beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The powder samples were coated onto the 3 M tapes examined in a fluorescence mode. Data were collected from 200 eV below the Ni K-edge (8333 eV) to ∼800 eV above the edge. Data processing and subsequent linear combination fitting for valence analysis were performed using the Athena software package, in which the XANES spectra of MNAO and Ni foil were used as the reference spectra for Ni2+ and Ni°, respectively."
4,Catalytic performance evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation Steady-state CO2 hydrogenation was performed in a quartz tube flow reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm under atmospheric pressure. 50 mg catalyst was loaded into a reactor tube and held in place by quartz wool for each test. Before reaction, the catalysts were reduced under a 20 mL/min H2/N2 mixture gas (at 1:1 ratio) at different temperatures for 1 h. Next, the inlet flow was switched to 30 mL/min N2 for cooling down to reaction temperature, and then the inlet flow was switched to CO2 of 5 mL/min, H2 of 20 mL/min, and N2 of 5 mL/min for CO2 hydrogenation. The concentration of gas products was analyzed online by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B) equipped with a flammable ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductive detector (TCD). The N2 in the flow was used as the internal standard. The response factor of each reactant and product was calibrated using standard curve methods. The conversion of CO2 ( X CO 2 ) is defined as: (1) X CO 2 = F CO 2 inlet - F CO 2 outlet F CO 2 inlet = C CO 2 inlet C N 2 inlet - C CO 2 outlet C N 2 outlet C CO 2 inlet C N 2 inlet The selectivity of CH4 ( S CH 4 ) is defined as: (2) S CH 4 = F CH 4 outlet F CO outlet +F CH 4 outlet = C CH 4 outlet C N 2 outlet C CO outlet C N 2 outlet + C CH 4 outlet C N 2 outlet where F is the flow rate of reactants or products (mol/min), C is the concentration of reactants or products (%)."
5,In situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments,"2.4 In situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments In situ DRIFTS experiments combined with CO2 hydrogenation transient response experiments were performed using a FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet iS50). Approximately 20 mg as-reduced catalysts (< 80 mesh) were packed into a homemade in-situ cell. As shown in the experimental process scheme (Fig. S1), before reaction, the catalysts were reduced under a 20 mL/min H2/N2 mixture gas (at 1:1 ratio) at 450 °C for 30 min. Next, the inlet flow was switched to 30 mL/min N2 for cooling down to 400 °C temperature, and then the inlet flow was switched to CO2 of 5 mL/min, H2 of 20 mL/min, and N2 of 5 mL/min. After reaction for 20 min, the CO2 or H2 was switched to 10 mL/min H2 and 20 mL/min N2 to reaction for 30 min (from State 1 to State 2 in Fig. S1). The adsorption species on the surface of catalysts were detected online."
6,Temperature-programmed experiments,"2.5 Temperature-programmed experiments All temperature-programmed experiments, including temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) for CO/CO2 hydrogenation, Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) for CO2 activation, TPSR for CO activation, and TPSR for H2-assisted CO activation was performed in a flow reactor under atmospheric pressure. Briefly, the catalysts were reduced and then the inlet flow was switched to inert gas for cooling down. Next, the inlet flow was switched to reaction gas, while the reactor was heated up. The gas product was detected online using an FTIR. The experimental details could be found in Supporting information."
7,Transient response experiments,"2.6 Transient response experiments CO activation transient response experiments were performed in a quartz tube flow reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm under atmospheric pressure. 20 mg catalyst was loaded into a reactor tube and held in place by quartz wool for each test. All inlet reactant gas was further purified by deoxidizing treatment. As shown in the experimental process scheme (Fig. S2), before reaction, the catalysts were reduced under a 20 mL/min H2/N2 mixture gas (at 1:1 ratio) at different temperatures for 1 h (State 1 in Fig. S2). Next, the inlet flow was switched to 30 mL/min N2 for cooling down to 400 °C temperature (State 2 in Fig. S2), and then the inlet flow was switched to 1% CO/N2 of 2 mL/min and N2 of 18 mL/min to reaction for 15 min (State 3 in Fig. S2). The CO and CO2 concentrations were detected online using an FTIR."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Structural characterization of MNAO-T catalysts,"3.1 Structural characterization of MNAO-T catalysts Nix/Mg0.9Ni0.1-xAl2O4 catalysts, donated as MNAO-T, were prepared by reducing Ni-doped MgAl2O4 (Mg0.9Ni0.1Al2O4, denoted as MNAO) by H2 at different temperatures. The Mg0.9Ni0.1Al2O4 (MNAO) precursor was synthesized by a hydrothermal method followed by a post-annealing treatment. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the as-prepared MNAO sample consists of a mixture of nanosheets and nanorods. Owing to their small sizes, MNAO exhibits a high BET surface area of ∼114 m2/g (Fig. S3). The lattice parameter shown in the high-resolution TEM image is determined as 4.6 Å, which corresponds to the (111) fringes of the spinel (Fig. 1b). The EDX elemental mapping images reveal the homogeneous distribution of Mg, Al, and Ni in MNAO (Fig. 1c). As depicted in Fig. 1d, the XRD pattern of MNAO can be solely assigned to MgAl2O4 with the spinel structure (PDF-#21−1152) without any peak from NiO, implying the successful doping of Ni into MgAl2O4 (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, the enlarged 27.20°∼28.70° region of the XRD pattern shows the shift of the (440) reflection to higher 2θ values from 27.99° to 28.02° (Fig. 1e). This corresponds to a decrease of the lattice parameter due to the substitution of small-radius Ni2+ to larger sized Mg2+. After Ni doping, a new peak at ∼640 nm in the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of MNAO is observed, which can be traced to the absorption of NiAl2O4 (Fig. 1f). [25] This is also consistent with the fact that the original white color of MgAl2O4 turns to light green in MNAO (Fig. 1f inset). These results confirm the successful doping of Ni into MgAl2O4. Notably, the Ni species doped into MNAO might exist in two forms, phase-separated NiAl2O4 and Ni ions partially inserted into MgAl2O4. Both the existing forms inhibit the reduction of Ni2+ to metallic Ni, allowing to obtain Ni particles with different sizes over a wide temperature range. The as-obtained MNAO sample was reduced by H2 at four different temperatures to prepare MNAO-T catalysts with different sizes of Ni nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. S4, the light green MNAO becomes darker and darker with increasing reduction temperature, which is a direct indication of the segregation of Ni atoms. The (440) peak in the XRD pattern of MNAO also gradually shifts back to the original value of 27.99° for MgAl2O4, suggesting the increased removal of Ni2+ from the MgAl2O4 lattice at higher reducing temperatures (Fig. S5). As depicted in Fig. 2 a-d and Fig. S6, uniform Ni nanoparticles, whose sizes increase with the reduction temperature, are segregated in MNAO-T. As summarized in Table S1, the average size of Ni nanoparticles is found to be ∼0.9, ∼4.8, ∼7.6, ∼12.3 nm for MNAO-550, MNAO-600, MNAO-700, MNAO-800, respectively (Fig. S6). Notably, this method allows the preparation of sub-nanometer Ni particles at 550 °C via the strong interaction between Ni guest and MgAl2O4 host, though it is widely accepted that sub-nanometer metal clusters tend to sinter into larger particles at such a high temperature. This doping-segregation strategy provides a unique route to synthesis sub-nanometer metal clusters that are stable at high temperatures. [26–30] As shown in Fig. 2e, no signal of metallic Ni is observed in the XPS spectrum of MNAO, which is consistent with the doping of Ni2+ into MgAl2O4. After H2 reduction, the intensity of Ni 2p3/2 peak (metallic Ni) gradually raises with the reduction temperature along with the decrease of the Ni2+ peak. As summarized in Table S1, the peak areas of metallic Ni in the XPS spectra of MNAO-550, MNAO-600, MNAO-700, and MNAO-800 account for 2.5 %, 6.2 %, 17.4 %, and 56.1 % of the total area of Ni 2p3/2, respectively. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra also show that the whiteline intensity decreases and the absorption edge of Ni K-edge of MNAO red-shifts with increasing reduction temperature, indicating lower oxidation states of Ni after reduction at higher temperatures (Fig. 2f and inset). The linear combination fitting (LCF) curves of the XANES data are shown in Fig. S7 and the corresponding content of metallic Ni is also summarized in Table S1. It is found that the proportion of Ni° is similar to XPS results for the four MNAO-T samples. This trend is further demonstrated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results (Fig. 2h). In the case of MNAO-550 and MNAO-600, the intensity of Ni-O and Ni-Ni (NiO) bonding at 1.7 Å and 2.6 Å is almost unchanged. With an increasing reduction temperature from 600°C to 800 °C, the Ni-Ni (metallic Ni) bonding at 2.2 Å gradually appears while the intensity of the Ni-O and Ni-Ni (NiO) bonding gradually decreases. These results suggest that more Ni2+ are reduced at higher reduction temperatures, which is responsible for the increase of Ni sizes. Notably, despite the reduction temperature is as high as 800 °C, the Ni2+ ion in MNAO still cannot be completely reduced to metallic Ni due to the limitation of segregated kinetics. [31,32]"
10,Catalytic performance evaluation,"3.2 Catalytic performance evaluation The steady-state catalytic properties of the MNAO-T catalysts with different Ni particle size for CO2 hydrogenation were evaluated at 400 °C and compared with those of supported Ni/MgAl2O4 (Ni/MAO-T) catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3 , CO and CH4 are the main detectable products for all catalysts. For MNAO-T catalysts, with increasing Ni particle size, CO2 conversion shows a progressive increase from 6.5 % with 96 % CO selectivity to 59.9 % with 95 % CH4 selectivity. In contrast, the Ni/MAO-T catalyst shows a stable CO2 conversion of ∼70 % and continuous >95 % CH4 selectivity. Moreover, the increase of Ni particle size in the MNAO-T catalyst improves the TOF of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4, (Fig. S8 and Table S1). Furthermore, when the CO2 conversion of MNAO-800 (6.3 %) is controlled at a similar level to that of MNAO-550 (6.5 %), the CH4 selectivity of MNAO-800 is still as high as 66 % (Table 1 ). These results indicated that the increased Ni particle size promotes the generation of CH4. Notably, it is found that the increase of CO2 conversion with increasing Ni particle size mainly comes from the contribution of the increase of CH4 formation rate, while the CO formation rate is almost constant and even decreases for MNAO-700 and MNAO-800. The same conclusions can also be drawn from the evaluations of CO2 hydrogenation at 350 °C and 450 °C for MNAO-T and Ni/MAO-T (Fig. S9, Table S2, and Table S3). Therefore, the generation of CH4 may be the key factor affecting product selectivity in the CO2 hydrogenation process."
11,Determination of the primary reaction pathway for CO2 hydrogenation,"3.3 Determination of the primary reaction pathway for CO2 hydrogenation At atmospheric pressure, CH4 is the most stable CO2 hydrogenation product and its formation requires a series of complex transitions of intermediates. [12] Therefore, the transition of key intermediates to CH4 will directly affect the formation rate of CH4. To identify key intermediates and the primary reaction pathway, the in-situ DRIFTS combined with transient response experiments of CO2 hydrogenation were carried out for MNAO-T catalysts at 400 °C. For CO2 hydrogenation, it is commonly accepted that weak adsorption of *CO leads to the formation of CO as the main product while strong adsorption of *CO promotes its continuing hydrogenation to produce CH4 [5]. Here, as shown in Fig. 4 , the *CO species during CO2 hydrogenation reaction, 2016 cm−1 for linear adsorption while 1916 cm−1 and 1868 cm−1 for bridged adsorption [33,34], are identified. With the increase of CH4 selectivity from MNAO-550 to MNAO-800, the intensity of *CO species increases correspondingly, which is consistent with the previous conclusion that lower average valence state of Ni leads to stronger adsorption of *CO and thereafter results in higher selectivity of its further hydrogenation product (i.e., CH4). [15] Moreover, surface adsorbed bicarbonate (*HCO3- at 1636 cm−1), formate (*HCOO at 1605, 1397 and 1375 cm−1) with corresponding C–H vibration bands (2997, 2916, 2903, and 2857 cm−1), and gas-phase CH4 (CH4(gas), 3016 cm-1) are also identified(Fig. S10a-d) [33,34]. For catalysts with aluminum-containing supports, *HCOO species adsorbed on metal-support interfaces are considered to be the active intermediates that can react with the *H species to produce CH4, which is known as the formate pathway [33,34]. Thus, for CO2 hydrogenation, there are two possible pathways to generate CH4, i.e., via the *CO intermediate and via the *HCOO intermediate. To unveil the contribution of the two pathways on the generation rate of CH4, CO2 hydrogenation transient response experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4c, after switching the reaction gas from H2/CO2 mixture to H2 at the reaction temperature, the intensity of *CO and CH4 maintain a similar trend of variation, while the intensity of *HCOO shows a much slower decrease trend. Within 0.5 min after switching the gas, the intensity of *HCOO, *CO, and CH4(gas) species are decreased by 56 %, 97 %, and 87 %, respectively. Based on the decrease rate of intensity, *CO and *HCOO species account for 75 % and 25 % of CH4 generation, respectively. Furthermore, after 1 min of switching gas, the attenuation of CH4(gas) species is 94 % and the *CO signal has almost disappeared (98 %), while the intensity of *HCOO species attenuates only 66 %. Since the surface *CO species has been almost exhausted from 0.5 to 1 min after gas switching, the contribution of *HCOO species to the generation of CH4 grows to 70 %. Similar results are also obtained for the MNAO-600 with lower CH4 selectivity (Fig. S11). Therefore, it can be concluded that the RWGS + *CO hydrogenation pathway dominates the generation of CH4 during CO2 hydrogenation in this case (Fig. 4e), which is consistent with the previous reports. [12] Following the *CO hydrogenation pathway, the key step in the hydrogenation of *CO to CH4 is the dissociation of the C-O bond. There are two possible pathways for the dissociation of adsorbed *CO, including direct CO dissociation and H2-assisted CO dissociation. [12,35] To determine the pathway of CO dissociation, the CO hydrogenation TPSR experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. 5 a, in the H2-rich atmosphere, the CO concentration starts to decrease with increasing temperature in the range of 150–250 °C, suggesting the dissociation of CO occurs. Notably, as the average valence of Ni decreases (from MNAO-550 to MNAO-800), the H2-assisted CO activation temperature gradually decreases. Taking CO activation temperature T20 (the temperature corresponding to 20 % CO conversion) as an example, it drops from 264 °C in MNAO-550 to 203 °C in MNAO-800. The activation energy (Ea ) of H2-assisted CO dissociation can be obtained according to the results of CO hydrogenation TPSR experiments. As shown in Fig. 5b–e, the H2-assisted CO dissociation activation energy also shows a downward trend with the decreasing average valence of Ni from MNAO-550 to MNAO-800, suggesting that the dissociation of CO might be the rate-determining step for CH4 generation. To exclude the possible direct dissociation of CO without H2, the CO TPR experiment was carried out. The results indicate that the direct CO dissociation has a higher onset temperature than H2-assisted CO dissociation for the four MNAO-T catalysts (Fig. S12). The Ea of direct CO dissociation obtained through CO transient response experiments for MNAO-700 and MNAO-800 (Fig. S13) is higher than that of the H2-assisted CO dissociation (Fig. S14b). Meanwhile, the Ea of CO adsorption on the surface of catalysts is much lower than that of CO dissociation (Fig. S14a). These results demonstrate that the H2-assisted CO dissociation pathway dominates the further hydrogenation of *CO to CH4, which is consistent with previously reported theoretical calculation results. [35]"
12,Descriptor identification for CO2 hydrogenation selectivity,"3.4 Descriptor identification for CO2 hydrogenation selectivity So far, it is generally accepted that the binding energy of *CO is the descriptor of CO2 hydrogenation selectivity. [15,16] According to the above results, the primary pathway of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 over Ni-based spinel catalysts is experimentally identified. To further understand the relationship between the hydrogenation ability of *CO and CH4 selectivity, the CH4 selectivity is plotted as a function of the Ea of H2-assisted CO dissociation for the four MNAO-T catalysts. A good linear relationship is presented (Fig. 6 a). To this end, it can be inferred that the ability of H2-assisted CO dissociation controls the generation of CH4. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6b, the Ea of H2-assisted CO dissociation also shows a good linear relationship with the activation temperature (e.g., T20, T50, or T80, the temperatures corresponding to 20 %, 50 %, or 80 % CO conversion, respectively) of H2-assisted CO dissociation from CO hydrogenation TPSR experiments. Therefore, the CO activation temperature (take T50 as an example), which also represents the H2-assisted dissociation ability of CO, could be adopted as a quantitative descriptor of CH4 selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation over Ni-based spinel catalysts. The CO activation temperature (e.g., T50) of H2-assisted CO dissociation shows a good linear relationship with the Ni particle size (Fig. S15a), suggesting that the Ni particle size can also be a descriptor of product selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation over Ni-based spinel catalysts. Fig. S15b shows a linear correlation of the CH4 selectivity with the Ni particle size. To demonstrate the generality of this descriptor, various Ni-supported catalysts including Ni/SiO2, Ni/ZrO2, Ni/CeO2, Ni/Al2O3, were synthesized and evaluated (Fig.S16 and Table S6). The BET surface area of these oxide supports was summarized in Table S7. As shown in Fig. 6c, a good linear relationship is presented when CH4 selectivity is plotted as a function of CO activation temperature (T50) for various Ni-based catalysts when the CO activation temperature (T50) is higher than 220 °C. When the CO activation temperature (T50) is lower than 220 °C, all the Ni-based catalysts show >95 % CH4 selectivity. As a quantitative indicator, the CO activation temperature (T50) can be experimentally measured easily, which will help guide the design of new catalysts with high selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation. The methodology developed in this work would be universal for the determination of key intermediates, the quantification of the activation energy for the rate-determining step, and the identification of a quantitative descriptor for consecutive reactions over heterogeneous catalysts."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, the effect of Ni particle size on the product selectivity of carbon dioxide hydrogenation reactions are systematically studied. It is found that smaller Ni particles exhibit a higher oxidation state and favor the production of CO, while larger Ni particles are likely to exist in a metallic state and tend to produce more CH4. Through a series of temperature-programmed, DRIFTS, and transient response experiments, the primary reaction pathway of CO2 methanation over Ni-based catalysts, i.e., RWGS + H2-assisted CO dissociation and hydrogenation, was experimentally revealed. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the H2-assisted CO dissociation is the rate-determining step for CH4 generation and the activation energy of this key step can be experimentally obtained. The activation energy of H2-assisted CO dissociation shows a good linear relationship with another parameter that is more easily accessible, i.e., the activation temperature of CO in hydrogen atmosphere. Therefore, both parameters are proposed as the quantitative descriptors of CH4 selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Our study brings new insight into tunable CO2 hydrogenation selectivity, better explaining the structure-performance relationship of heterogeneous catalysts. The identification of an experimental accessible quantitative descriptor also greatly facilitates the fine-tuning of activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis."
