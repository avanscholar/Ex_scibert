0,Introduction,"Great attention is paid now to the transformations of renewable feedstocks into fuels and various valuable chemicals to replace fossil resources like oil and natural gas [1]. The main problem here is to develop efficient processes for treatment of such highly functionalized molecules as sugars, polyols, cyclic ethers, carboxylic acids and esters [2]. In particular, fatty acids and esters can be converted to the corresponding alcohols via the selective catalytic hydrogenation. Fatty alcohols are used as non-ionogenic detergents and additives to lubricants; they are employed also in perfumery and cosmetics. In the 1930s, the hydrogenation of fatty acid esters derived from vegetable raw materials has been commercialized. The process was carried out on Cu–Cr catalysts at a hydrogen pressure of 20–50 atm and temperatures between 200 °C and 400 °C [3,4]. Since 1950s, an industrial process has been used to produce fatty alcohols from the olefins obtained by the oligomerization of ethylene, which were subjected to the hydroformylation with subsequent hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to alcohols [5]. At present, the rise of oil prices and the intense development of technologies for renewable feedstock processing facilitate the emergence of methods for the alcohols production with lower energy consumption. Thus, the direct hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to corresponding alcohols under mild conditions is the key step in the transformation of renewable feedstocks into valuable chemical products. Previous attempts to perform the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids under milder conditions (low temperatures and hydrogen pressures) were reported in several works [6–9]. In particular, low yields of fatty alcohols C6 C18 were obtained on rhenium oxide at a hydrogen pressure of 170–270 atm and temperature of 150–250 °C [6]. Supported bimetallic catalysts containing noble metals showed a higher activity in the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids and hydrogenolysis of esters under milder conditions. On bimetallic RuSn/Al2O3 catalysts at a hydrogen pressure of 80 atm and temperature of 250 °C, the yield of fatty alcohols C12 C18 reached 85% [7]. On PtRe/TiO2 catalysts the selectivity toward fatty alcohols C10 C18 was 90% at a conversion near 80% [8], while on the PdReO X /SiO2 catalyst the yield of fatty alcohols exceeded 90% [9]. As rhenium was found to be the most efficient promoter allowing a substantial decrease in the hydrogenation temperature and pressure, the structure of the active sites in PtRe catalysts has been studied intensively. An in situ XANES study of PtRe/TiO2 [10] showed that platinum is present as a metal, while rhenium can be in both the metallic and oxidized states. When Pt–Re/C catalysts were examined by XAS and TEM [11], it was found that the reductive treatment produces PtRe alloy nanoparticles with a size less than 2 nm; however, in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol, the surface rhenium atoms are oxidized with the appearance of hydroxyl groups. The authors of [12] demonstrated by means of XANES that even the treatment in H2 cannot ensure a complete reduction of rhenium in the PtRe/C catalysts. The stability of oxide ReO X clusters in PtReO X /SiO2 [13,14], RhReO X /SiO2 [15] and IrReO X /SiO2 [16] catalysts was confirmed also by Tomishige and co-authors who supposed that the active sites of such catalysts are represented by noble metal particles covered with the oxidized rhenium species; it means that the Pt–Re nanoparticles do not form the alloy. Nearly the same conclusions were made in [17,18], where bimetallic Rh(Pt)–Re catalysts were shown to have the acidity that is caused most likely by the formation of PtORe species. At the same time, it was demonstrated that homogeneous metal-organic Ru(II) complexes can also hydrogenate the esters to alcohols under much milder conditions (a temperature of 50 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 25 atm) [19]. Recently, the metal-organic complexes containing a transition metal (MeRu, Os, Pd, Ir) and bulky pincer-type ligands with donor heteroatoms (LO, S, N) were proposed as efficient homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of carboxylic acids and esters [20–24]. It was shown that the heterolytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen takes place on MeL pair with the formation of hydride species [24]. As a result, the hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols proceeds with high selectivity and activity, so that the TOF values are close to 100 h– 1 and above. In the present work, the structure-activity relationship in the selective hydrogenation of hexanoic acid to hexanol under mild conditions over PtReO X /TiO2 catalysts was studied to achieve deeper insights into the hydrogenation chemistry of the carboxylic groups. Various physico-chemical methods (HRTEM/STEM with EDX mapping, XPS, FTIR, etc.) were employed to investigate the structure and chemical composition of the active sites in PtReO X /TiO2 catalysts with different Pt/Re atomic ratios."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts and supports,"2.1 Catalysts and supports The catalysts were synthesized using anatase titania Hombifine N calcined at 400 °C. The specific surface area measured by the BET method was 170 m2/g; the pore volume was equal to 0.37 cm3/g, and the characteristic pore diameter was ca. 10 nm. The catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation from aqueous solutions of Pt(II) tetraammine nitrate and ammonium perrhenate with deionized water as a solvent. The resulting catalysts differed in the order of Pt and Re deposition and had different Pt/Re ratios. When platinum was introduced prior to rhenium, TiO2 was impregnated with a [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution, and the samples were sequentially dried at room temperature and 110 °C and then reduced in flowing hydrogen at 300 °C for 3 h. Rhenium was deposited on thus prepared Pt/TiO2 samples from a NH4ReO4 solution; after that, the samples were also dried and reduced in flowing hydrogen at 300 °C for 3 h. When rhenium was introduced prior to platinum, the support was impregnated with a NH4ReO4 solution and dried at room temperature; rhenium salt was then decomposed by heating the sample to 350 °C (10 K/min) in an argon flow and keeping at this temperature for 30 min. Note that the 15% Re content corresponds to a monolayer coverage of the TiO2 surface under the assumption of Re/Ti = 1. After that, platinum was introduced into the sample from a [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution with subsequent drying and reduction in flowing H2 at 300 °C for 3 h. It is important to emphasize that the interaction of platinum complex with the reduced Re-containing sample was accompanied by a release of molecular nitrogen. This indicates unambiguously that chemical interaction between supported rhenium species and platinum (II) complexes occurs already at the impregnation step. To prevent undesirable contact with air, the sample reduced in H2 was transferred for testing in a Parr reactor with a solution of hexanoic acid under a dry argon atmosphere. The monometallic Pt/TiO2 sample with platinum introduced by the technique described above was used as a reference sample. The synthesized samples were denoted as xPt yRe/TiO2 for Pt deposition prior to Re, where x and y are the Pt and Re weight content, respectively. On the contrary, Re deposition prior to Pt was designated as yRe xPt/TiO2."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1. Electron microscopy High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEM-2010 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) at the accelerating voltage of 200 kV and lattice resolution of 0.14 and 0.1 nm, respectively. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained with a JEM-2200FS electron microscope equipped with a Cs-corrector and an omega-type energy filter. Local energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) was carried out on an EDAX spectrometer (EDAX Co.) fitted with a Si (Li) detector with a resolution of 130 eV. The minimum diameter for the EDX analysis spot was ∼20 nm in JEM-2010, whereas for JEM-2200FS in the HAADF-STEM mode the spot diameter reached ∼0.5 nm. In addition, the elemental composition of nanoparticles was studied more precisely using a high resolution HAADF-STEM equipped with step-by-step line elemental EDX analysis (mapping) with a step of 0.8 nm. Samples for electron microscopy were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion in octane followed by deposition of the suspension on a perforated carbon film that was mounted on a copper grid. Therewith, a sample was transferred to the electron microscope chamber in the absence of air. 2.2.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The XPS study was carried out on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH, Germany) equipped with an X-ray source XR-50 with a double Al/Mg anode and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer PHOIBOS-150. The spectrometer was also equipped with a high-pressure cell, which enables to heat samples before analyzing in gaseous mixtures at pressures up to 0.5 MPa. The XP spectra were obtained using the non-monochromatic MgKα (hν = 1253.6 eV) radiation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The charge correction was performed by setting the Ti2p 3/2 peak at 458.6 eV. Relative element concentrations were determined from the integral intensities of XPS peaks using the cross-sections according to Scofield. The samples unloaded from the reactor were transferred to the spectrometer chamber without air access using a vessel with octane; then the liquid evaporated in an argon medium. To check a possible oxidation of rhenium or platinum, the sample was additionally reduced in hydrogen at 300 °C for 1 h in a high-pressure chamber of the XP spectrometer after recording the spectrum. Invariability of XP spectra after in situ reduction testifies that the technique used in the study actually measures true oxidation states of platinum and rhenium. 2.2.3. IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO IR spectra of the samples with adsorbed CO were recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8300 spectrometer over a range of 400–6000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and scan number 800. The catalyst was pressed into a thin pellet which was subjected to the reductive treatment including evacuation of the sample (300 °C, 1 h) and treatment at 100 Torr H2 (300 °C, 30 min). After evacuation at 300 °C, the sample was cooled to room temperature and the adsorption of CO (20 Torr) was carried out. After subtraction of the background spectrum, the integral intensities of the band as referred to the pellet thickness were evaluated."
4,Catalysts testing,"2.3 Catalysts testing The catalysts were tested in the selective hydrogenation of hexanoic acid using a setup operated in a flow mode with respect to hydrogen, with GC analysis of both the liquid and gas phases. The setup included a 450 mL titanium Parr reactor (model 4567) with an oven and a controller, cylinders with H2 and N2 (for blowing off air and H2), a high pressure reducer with a manometer, a mass flow controller for gas feeding, and an upstream pressure controller for maintaining a constant pressure in the reactor. 2 g of the catalyst was put into 150 mL of the reaction mixture containing 5% of hexanoic acid (0.4 mol/L) in dodecane (or dioxane). After reactor purging with N2 the hydrogen was admitted to 50 bar, and the temperature was raised to 130 °C. The reaction was carried out for 5 h at a stirring velocity of 600 min−1. Note that an increase in the solution volume and catalyst weight (at the same ratio) as well as stirring velocity exerted no effect on the activity, thus indicating that the entire volume of the suspension was involved in the reaction and all catalyst particles were accessible to reactants. The strictly linear dependence of reaction rate on catalyst loading (1–4 g) indicates that the reaction proceeds without diffusion limitation. The reagent (hexanoic acid) and solvents (dodecane and dioxane) contained no less than 99% of the main substance, the rest being the admixtures of methylpentanoic acid and dodecane isomers, respectively. The concentration of the liquid (hexanoic acid, ester and hexanol) was analyzed on a Shimadzu GC-14 equipped with a Carbowax capillary column (25 m × 0.22 mm) and a flame-ionization detector (FID), helium serving as a carrier gas. The concentration of gaseous products (hexane, pentane and CO2) was analyzed on a Kristall 2000M gas chromatograph with a packed column Chromosorb-108 (1.5 m × 2 mm). The conversion of hexanoic acid (X), selectivity for products (Si ), and material balance (N) were calculated as X ( % ) = C ACID 0 − C ACID C ACID 0 × 100 S i ( % ) = C i C HEXANOL + C PENTANE + C HEXANE + C ESTER × 100 N = C ACID outlet + C HEXANOL + C PENTANE + C HEXANE + 2 C ESTER C ACID inlet where, Ci denotes the concentrations of the reactant and products (mol/L). Note that the molar material balance was not worse than 100 ± 1%. Furthermore, the turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as w 0/C Pt, where w 0 is the initial reaction rate determined as a slope of experimental time (t) dependence of hexanol concentration at t = 0, and C Pt is the total number of Pt atoms. The point is that, according to the HAADF-STEM high resolution image, the separate Pt or Re atoms in Pt–ReO X species of ca. 0.5 nm size were really observed (Section 3.2). Therefore, for TOF calculation the total number of Pt atoms was considered as the number of active sites."
5,Kinetic model of the selective hydrogenation of hexanoic acid,"2.4 Kinetic model of the selective hydrogenation of hexanoic acid When modeling the hydrogenation kinetics of hexanoic acid, the mechanistic scheme comprising four reactions was considered (Scheme 1). The first reaction is the target hydrogenation of the acid to alcohol, the second reaction is the esterification of the acid with hexanol catalyzed by acid, the third one is the decarboxylation of the acid to pentane, and the fourth one is the total hydrogenation of hexanol to hexane. Note that the contribution of the last two reactions is very low due to a low reaction temperature. All the reactions were taken to be irreversible. Rates of the reactions (wi ) were expressed according to the law of mass action under the assumption of a constant hydrogen concentration in the solution, which was implicitly included into the value of effective rate constants for reactions 1 and 4 (Scheme 2). The numerical analysis of experimental data on the kinetics of hexanoic acid hydrogenation was performed using a model of batch (with respect to liquid phase) gradientless reactor: d C i d t = ∑ k N 1 w i k − ∑ l N 2 w i l i = 1 , N The initial conditions: t = 0 C i = C i 0 Here, Ci denotes the concentrations of reaction components in a solution (mol/L), ∑ k N 1 w i k and ∑ l N 2 w i l are the sums of reaction rates for the formation and transformation of the ith component (mol/L/h), and t is the time (h). Expressions for the rates of main and side reactions were written in compliance with the law of mass action: w 1 = k 1 C 1 , w 2 = k 2 C 1 C 2 , w 3 = k 2 C 1 , w 4 = k 2 C 2 , where, C1, C 2 and C 3 are concentrations of the acid, hexanol and ester, respectively; and ki denotes the effective rate constants of the reactions."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Rhenium deposition on TiO2,"3.1 Rhenium deposition on TiO2 As will be shown in Section 3.3, the order of rhenium and platinum deposition is the most crucial factor affecting the catalyst performance, the Re deposition prior to Pt being more preferential. Therefore, the rhenium species formed on the TiO2 surface were investigated with HRTEM and XPS. The latter technique was applied to study the effect of the Re salt decomposition atmosphere (air, argon, hydrogen) on the rhenium charge state in the 15% Re/TiO2 sample. It should be reminded that 15% of rhenium corresponds to a monolayer coverage of the titania surface. The corresponding Re4f spectra are shown in Fig. 1 . It is known that the Re4f spectrum represents the Re4f 7/2–Re4f 5/2 doublet with a 4:3 ratio of the integral intensities of components and a spin-orbital splitting of 2.43 eV. According to the literature data, ReO, Re2O3, ReO2, ReO3, Re2O7 and rhenium in the metallic state are characterized by the Re4f 7/2 binding energy equal to 41.4, 42.0, 42.5, 44.3, 46.4–46.5 and 40.3 eV, respectively [25,26]. The Re4f spectrum of the sample heated in air flow contains two doublets with the Re4f 7/2 binding energies of 44.2 and 46.2 eV (Fig. 1a). The sample decomposed in argon flow is characterized by the spectrum with a strong Re4f 7/2–Re4f 5/2 doublet having the Re4f 7/2 binding energy of 41.8 eV (Fig. 1b). And the spectrum of the sample reduced in hydrogen flow is the single doublet with the Re4f 7/2 binding energy of 40.5 eV (Fig. 1c). Hence, it can be suggested that the thermal decomposition of ammonium perrhenate in air leads to the formation of Re2O7 or ReO3 oxides, in argon flow the partially reduced Re+2 or Re+3 species are produced, whereas the treatment in hydrogen results in the complete Re reduction to the metallic state. The HRTEM study of the 15%Re/TiO2 sample heated in argon (Fig. 2 ) demonstrated that rhenium is located on the TiO2 surface as highly dispersed ReO X oxide clusters because, according to XPS, the metallic rhenium was not detected at all. Such a high dispersion of the rhenium species may be caused by their strong interaction with the support surface. The thermal decomposition of ammonium perrhenate in an inert atmosphere is accompanied most likely with the partial reduction of rhenium by the evolved ammonia, which leads to the formation of rhenium oxides of a lower valence."
8,"Size, location and electronic state of the Pt and Re species in bimetallic samples","3.2 Size, location and electronic state of the Pt and Re species in bimetallic samples 3.2.1. Electron microscopy According to the electron microscopy data, the samples with Pt deposited prior to Re contain both the coarse and finely dispersed platinum particles on the surface. As seen from Fig. 3 (the inset), the lattice parameter of 0.225 nm corresponds to the cubic lattice of metallic Pt. Furthermore, EDX analysis of extensive areas shows the prevalence of platinum particles, while particle-free areas contain mainly the highly dispersed rhenium species. It means that the rhenium oxide species and the Pt metallic particles exist separately on the TiO2 surface. On the contrary, the catalysts with Re deposited prior to Pt are characterized by the presence of highly dispersed particles on the support surface. The HAADF-STEM images of the 15Re-5Pt/TiO2 sample indicate mainly the presence of highly dispersed particles with a size of 0.5–1 nm, whereas large particles or their agglomerates are completely absent (Fig. 4 ). Chemical composition of the particles in this sample was thoroughly studied by the step-by-step linear EDX elemental analysis. The inset shows the EDX analysis of Re and Pt along the line intersecting some subnanometric particles, with a 1 nm step, i.e. with a simultaneous analysis of no more than 1–2 particles. It is seen that the Pt and Re atomic concentrations change synchronously and the estimated Re: Pt ratio is close to 2:1, thus indicating that the highly dispersed Pt–ReO X particles have close chemical composition. In distinction to the 15Re-5Pt/TiO2 sample having a monolayer coverage with rhenium compounds, the samples with a lower Re content have another morphology and chemical composition of the particles. Indeed, the HAADF-STEM images of the 7.5Re–7.5Pt/TiO2 sample show not only the highly dispersed Pt–ReO X particles with a size smaller than 1 nm but also the large 2–5 nm particles (Fig. 5 ). The step-by-step linear elemental analysis of the large particles revealed that the absolute concentration of both platinum and rhenium increases from the edge to the particle center, while the Re/Pt ratio remains virtually constant and equal to 0.5 (Fig. 5, the inset), which is 4 times lower than in a monolayer on ReO X samples. It means that, unlike highly dispersed Pt–ReO X particles, the large particles are substantially enriched with platinum. 3.2.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The charge state of Pt and Re in the catalysts was determined by XPS and FTIR. Two asymmetric peaks corresponding to components of the Pt4f 7/2–Pt4f 5/2 doublet are observed in the Pt4f core-level spectra of the 15Re-5Pt/TiO2 sample (Fig. 6 a). The spin-orbital splitting is 3.33 eV, and the peak asymmetry parameter is 0.21, which is typical of platinum in the metallic state. The Pt4f 7/2 binding energy equal to 71.1–71.5 eV is also typical of platinum in a metallic or possibly a slightly charged state. The observed shift toward high binding energies with respect to the monometallic Pt/TiO2 sample (70.7 eV) may be related to a strong interaction of platinum with rhenium. This suggests that the state of platinum in the Pt–ReO X particles is mostly Pt0 or Ptδ+ due to transfer of electron density from rhenium to platinum. The Re4f spectrum of the 15Re-5Pt/TiO2 sample consists of a single doublet with the Re4f 7/2 binding energy equal to 41.0 eV (Fig. 6b), which corresponds to rhenium in the oxidized state most close to Re2+. The data obtained allow a conclusion that platinum is in the metallic state, while rhenium is present as Re2+ in the ReO X oxide cluster. Thus, XPS and electron microscopy data suggest that active sites for the hydrogenation of the acid are represented by the highly dispersed Pt0–ReO X particles, where x ≤ 1. 3.2.3. IR spectroscopy The infrared spectra of adsorbed CO for the Pt–ReO X /TiO2 catalysts and monometallic Pt/TiO2 one are displayed in Fig. 7 . Three main absorption bands at 2110–2125, 2060–2077 and 2030-2035 cm−1 are observed. The band at 2110–2125 cm−1 can be assigned to CO molecules adsorbed on the Re cations with a charge from +1 to +3, the band at 2060–2077 cm−1 corresponds to CO complexes with metallic platinum, and the band at 2030–2035 cm−1 is characteristic of CO molecules bound with small Ptδ – particles or Re0 located on the TiO2 surface [27–29]. One can see that all three types of surface sites for the CO adsorption are present in the Pt–ReO X /TiO2 samples; they differ only in relative intensities of CO bands and in slight shifts of their maxima. For the monolayer 15Re–10Pt sample, only the bands belonging to Re cations and Pt metal are observed. It means that platinum deposits on ReO X species only. However, for the 7.5Re–5Pt sample where Re content is lower than a monolayer, the low-frequency absorption band at 2030–2035 cm−1 appears, whereas intensity of the bands assigned to Pt0 and Re n + decreases essentially. This indicates unambiguously that in this case platinum is located not only on the ReO X –covered support surface but also on the Re-free surface. Let us compare the densities of all three sites for CO adsorption using the relative intensities of corresponding absorption bands listed in Table 1. One can see that the higher is the Pt content (at a constant Re level), the lower is the 2030–2035 cm−1 band intensity and the higher are the 2110–2125 cm−1 and 2060–2077 cm−1 ones (compare data for samples with 5 and 10% Pt at 15% Re). This means that an increase in both the Re n + and Pt0 concentration and a decrease in Ptδ – with the total Pt content take place. Hence, one can suggest that this is due to the formation of Pt–ReO X species with the transfer of electron density from rhenium to platinum. At the same time, in the samples where titania surface is partially covered with ReO X clusters (Re content < 15%), the concentration of the Pt0–ReO X species is substantially lower, while the concentration of Ptδ –, which is characteristic of Pt deposited on the neat titania surface, is higher. Thus, the catalysts with Re deposited prior to Pt have a high concentration of the highly dispersed 0.5–1 nm Pt–ReO X sites with the Re/Pt atomic ratio close to 2. Here, platinum is in a metallic state, while rhenium is in a low-valence state. Note that the concentration of the Pt–ReO X sites is lower for the catalysts with rhenium content less than a monolayer."
9,Performance of the synthesized Pt–ReOX/TiO2 catalysts in the acid hydrogenation,"3.3 Performance of the synthesized Pt–ReOX/TiO2 catalysts in the acid hydrogenation Results of catalytic testing of the prepared samples in the hydrogenation of hexanoic acid under standard conditions are listed in Table 2. It is seen that activity of the samples where Pt was introduced prior to Re is close to that of monometallic Pt/TiO2. As follows from HRTEM/STEM and XPS studies, platinum resides on the titania surface as big particles which do not interact with rhenium. Therefore, the Pt–Re samples show a low activity similar to that of monometallic one. However, the Re–Pt samples with rhenium deposited prior to platinum are much more active in comparison with Pt–Re ones. The main reaction product is hexanol; so the 90–91% selectivity is essentially higher as compared to the monometallic one (80%). In other words, the rate of by-products (ester and paraffins) formation on the Re–Pt/TiO2 catalysts is much lower as compared to Pt/TiO2. Note that the decarboxylation rate was extremely low due to a low reaction temperature; as a result, the amount of pentane in all the experiments was an order of magnitude lower compared with that of hexane. As the Re–Pt catalysts exhibit higher activity and selectivity toward hexanol, it can be concluded that such method of synthesis is preferable for the formation of Pt–ReOX sites which are active in the selective hydrogenation of hexanoic acid. It is seen from Table 2 that the samples with a monolayer Re coverage show the maximal activity, the highest reaction rate being achieved on the catalyst with Re/Pt = 1.6, which is somewhat lower than the atomic ratio Re/Pt = 2 derived from the STEM with EDX study. Note that the reaction rate decreases sharply for the samples with the Re content lower that a monolayer. Indeed, the rate decreases monotonously by a factor of 3 after reducing the Re amount from 15 to 5% at a constant 5% Pt content (see entries 5, 10, 13 and 15). The same dependences take place for the samples with a Pt content of 7.5% (entries 6, 11 and 14) and 3% (entries 4, 9 and 12). It is obvious that the drop in the reaction rate is due to the formation of large and low-active Pt particles located on neat titania surface. Note that not only the catalyst activity but also the selectivity toward hexanol decreases, mainly due to the rise in esterification rate. The obtained kinetic dependences for the transformations of hexanoic acid over all rhenium monolayer catalysts were described well by the first order kinetics (see Section 2.4). The typical example of a good description of experimental kinetic curves obtained over the 15Re–5Pt/TiO2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 8 . The calculated reaction rate constants are as follows: k 1 = 0.15 h– 1 for the hydrogenation step, k 2 = 0.1 L/mol/h for the ester formation step, k 3 = 0.002 h−1 for the acid decarboxylation step, and k 4 = 0.012 h−1 for the total hydrogenation of hexanol to hexane. In spite of good description of the experimental data with the proposed kinetics, we need to check whether the reaction rate is limited by hydrogen diffusion to the catalyst active sites. The linear dependence of the reaction rate on hydrogen pressure ranging from 25 to 75 bar indicates the compliance with Henry's law as well as the lack of H2 diffusion limitation when the reaction rate becomes higher at elevated pressures. Moreover, we tested also the stability of the Pt–ReO X /TiO2 catalyst upon contacting with the reaction medium for a long time. A possible reason of the catalyst deactivation is the destruction of support, leaching of platinum or rhenium species in an acid medium, and accumulation of oligomeric products that may block the active sites. To check the stability of the 15Re–5Pt/TiO2 catalyst, four sequential single-type tests were carried out at 130 °C with the same sample. Between the tests, the catalyst was filtered off from the reaction mixture without washing and reduction. As seen from Fig. 9 , the catalyst activity slightly decreased (by ca. 5%) in the second cycle; however, in the next cycles conversion of the acid remained virtually constant. Furthermore, TEM and XPS data of the spent catalyst (not shown) confirmed its structural stability: neither the particles enlargement nor the change of Pt or Re electronic state was observed. This result testifies clearly that deactivation of the catalyst virtually does not occur. It is worth noting that selectivity toward hexanol in these test cycles remained constant, too. The main by-product of the hexanoic acid hydrogenation is the ester; its concentration does not decrease below 4%–5% irrespective of the sample composition. Blank experiments (without a catalyst but with the acid and alcohol) performed under the same reaction conditions demonstrated that the esterification takes place in this case too. It means that this reaction proceeds homogeneously in the liquid phase and is most likely catalyzed by the proper acidity of hexanoic acid. To hinder the undesirable esterification process, the dodecane solvent was replaced with a more basic dioxane. In this case, the rate of the hexanoic acid hydrogenation remained nearly the same as in the case of dodecane; however, the rate of the esterification reaction was substantially lower. As a result, the selectivity toward hexanol increased sharply up to 98% (Table 3). Numerical modeling of the blank experiments with dodecane and dioxane as solvents allowed us to find the contribution of homogeneous reaction. In all cases, esterification rate (w 2) was expressed as w 2 = k 2 _ hom C 1 C 2 Here, C 1 and C 2 are the concentrations of hexanoic acid and hexanol, respectively. The calculated rate constants k 2_hom for homogeneous esterification, which were found by fitting, are listed in Table 3. It is obvious that an increase in hexanol selectivity in the case of dioxane takes place due to the suppression of the homogeneous reaction. Since virtually all by-products are formed from hexanol, the catalyst activity can be characterized by the rate of hexanol formation. The dependencies of hexanoic acid hydrogenation rate constant (k 1) on Pt content for Re–Pt/TiO2 catalysts are displayed in Fig. 10. Evidently, for the samples with 10% and 15% of Re, the dependencies of hydrogenation activity on the Pt content are linear and virtually coincide with each other (Fig. 10a). One can suggest that these catalysts have the same type of active sites and the number of these sites is proportional to the total content of platinum. Activity of the catalysts having a monolayer coverage with Re increases linearly with the total content of platinum and reaches a maximum at the Re/Pt atomic ratio close to 2 (Fig. 10b). It is noteworthy that the same atomic ratio (Re/Pt = 2) was derived from the HAADF-STEM with EDX studies (Fig. 4). The addition of overstoichiometric platinum does not raise the activity because in this case only the Re-free low-active platinum particles are deposited on the support surface. Indeed, when Re coverage is less than a monolayer one (5% and 7.5% of Re), the slopes of the reaction rate versus Pt content dependences are noticeably less (Fig. 10a). It means that only a part of total platinum is bound to rhenium with the formation of the active Pt–ReO X sites, while the other part is deposited on neat titania surface as big and low-active Pt particles. Summarizing the catalyst characterization data and the kinetic results, we suppose that the structure of the active Pt–ReO X sites may resemble the structure of homogeneous pincer-type metal-organic complexes for the selective hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis [24]. Indeed, as in the case of Ru–NP y pair in these metal-organic complexes, the neighboring Pt–O atoms in our Pt–ReO X sites can form a similar pair that is able to dissociate heterolytically the H2 with the generation of hydroxyl and platinum hydride for the hydrogenation of the carboxylic group: Here, the redox interaction of platinum (II) complex with partially reduced rhenium species is accompanied by a release of molecular nitrogen, which results in the formation of Pt0 and low-valent Re species. The ReO X plays the role of pyridine ligand in the pincer-type metal-organic complexes maintaining platinum in metallic state due to the partial electron transfer from rhenium. The basic oxygen atoms bonded with rhenium can participate in the heterolytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen. They are able to bind the proton with formation of the hydroxyl group, while hydride anion is bonded with Pt to be involved in the hydrogenation of the acid carbonyl group. In [8] it was proposed that Re cations, due to their oxyphilicity, can activate the carboxylic group to weaken CO bond for its further hydrogenation. This somewhat contradicts the above-mentioned hydrogenation chemistry over metal-organic complexes, where the key step is heterolytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen [24]. The formed metal hydride and proton anchored to basic ligand hydrogenate selectively the carbonyl group to alcohol one without non-selective reactions of the acid overhydrogenation or decarboxylation with the formation of paraffins. In our work, an analogy was found between atomic structure of PtReO X sites and Milshtein's or Noyori's metal-organic complexes and their performance in acid hydrogenation. As a result, the selectivities toward alcohol are also close to each other (99% and 100%), and TOFs (20 and 100 h−1) are within one order of magnitude. In this connection, the role of the support is not clear. The strong metal-support interaction likely takes place, since extremely highly dispersed ReO X species of 0.3–0.5 nm size are really observed (Fig. 2). We believe that exactly these low-valent and low-coordinated ReO X species are responsible for the formation of the highly dispersed PtReO X sites. We do not think that the strong metal-support interaction is caused by specific defects located on the titania surface [8] because ReO X sites cover TiO2 very homogeneously up to a monolayer. This looks like molecular grafting of titania surface with rhenium oxide species. Moreover, using the same preparation technique as for TiO2 catalyst, similar PtReO X sites having virtually the same size, electronic state and Pt/Re ratio were stabilized over a non-oxide (activated carbon) support. As a result, the carbon based catalyst showed even a higher activity in hexanoic acid hydrogenation than the titania based one (these data will be published soon). The study of the structure-activity relationship allowed us to make a rational design of the highly selective and active Pt–ReO X solid catalyst, which approaches the homogeneous metal-organic complexes with respect to their performance in selective hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to alcohols. Indeed, the estimated TOF value reached 20 h−1, which is nearly by an order of magnitude higher than those reported in the literature and approaches the values for homogeneous catalysts (Table 4)."
10,Conclusions,"A series of the Pt–ReO X /TiO2 (X ≤ 1) catalysts with different Re/Pt ratios was synthesized, characterized by means of HRTEM/STEM with EDX, XPS and FTIRS, and tested in the selective liquid phase hydrogenation of hexanoic acid to hexanol at mild conditions (T = 130 ºC and P = 50 bar). The Pt–ReOX nanoparticles with the size around 0.5 nm and atomic ratio Re/Pt = 2 were formed via successive and strong interaction of the Re precursor with titania and of Pt complex with supported low-valent rhenium oxide clusters. These nanoparticles were shown to be highly active and selective in the hydrogenation of hexanoic acid at mild reaction conditions. The values of TOF and selectivity toward alcohol achieve 20 h−1 and 98%–99%, respectively, which are higher than those reported in the literature and approach the values of homogeneous pincer-type metal-organic complexes. Note that neat Pt metal particles deposited on titania showed much lower activity and selectivity. The proposed structure of the active Pt–ReO X sites is similar to that of homogeneous metal-organic complexes and includes Pt–O pair in the composition of active sites, which is also similar to Ru–NP y pair in Ru pincer complex. Here, the low-valent ReO X acts as a specific ligand maintaining Pt atom in metallic state via electron transfer from rhenium to platinum. One can propose that these pairs, like metal-organic complexes, are able to dissociate heterolytically the molecular hydrogen with the formation of hydroxyl groups and Pt hydrides for the hydrogenation of the carboxylic group. It was shown that the first order kinetics describes well the experimental kinetic data in a wide range of pressures and acid conversions. The main side reaction is a homogeneous esterification catalyzed by hexanoic acid itself. The use of dioxane as a more basic solvent did not affect the hydrogenation activity but suppressed substantially the reaction of ester formation. Finally, the Pt–ReO X /TiO2 catalyst showed a high stability when activity and selectivity remained constant during at least four cycles (5 h each) of testing."
