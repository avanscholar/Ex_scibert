0,Introduction,"With continuous depletion of traditional energy sources and severe environmental pollution, the exploitation of green new energy sources has received more and more attention. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs), with the higher output voltage, greater specific capacity and longer cycle life [1–6], have been efficient energy storage devices and now become an indispensable part in many power portable devices such as cellular phones, digital cameras and laptops [7–9]. Usually, commercial LIBs are comprised of four components including cathode, anode, separator and liquid electrolyte. The isolated liquid electrolyte has been widely used in LIBs for its low cost, high ionic conductivity and excellent compatibility with electrode. However, safety accidents caused by liquid electrolyte such as leakage, flame and explosives cannot be ignored [10–14]. Thus, gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with homogeneous gelation was obtained by the combination of polymer separator and liquid electrolyte. This gel state definitely makes a contribution to electrically insulating cathode and anode to prevent electrical short-circuits, allowing rapid transfer of ionic charge carriers and reducing the risk of leakage of liquid solution [15,16]. To date, four types of synthesized polymer host were well-studied for GPEs: poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) [17–20], polyacrylonitrile (PAN) [21–24], poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) [25–27] and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [28–30]. However, although all electrolytes based on these polymer matrixes exhibits satisfactory performances to some extent, these polymers are not easy biodegradable. Serious pollution was even caused by these difficultly degraded synthesized polymers when LIBs are completely invalidated. Thus, sustainable matrix materials especially involving some low cost, biodegradable and high performances materials should be developed immediately. Lignocellulose (LC), composed of constituent cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [31], is one kind of massive natural polymer in nature with 50 million tons production every year while the amount of annual use is less than 10%. Moreover, LC is easy degradable. From former research about LC based on GPE matrix, the preparation process of electrolyte membrane is not only simple but also shows outstanding electrochemical properties of GPE [32,33]: the ionic conductivity at room temperature is 1.27 × 10−3 S cm−1 and the number of lithium ions transference reaches up to 0.79. To be one green and environment-friendly GPE firstly used as matrix to prepare GPE all over the world, LC truly witnessed the realistic breakthrough for LIBs with zero environmental impact. The only drawback is the relatively weak mechanical strength of pure LC (1.04 MPa) [32], which cannot satisfy the actual application of LIBs. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), one kind of well-known membrane materials, has outstanding properties, such as excellent thermal, mechanical and chemical stabilities and good film-forming property [34–37]. Moreover, it is biodegradable [38,39]. Due to these above advantages, PVA has been selected to prepare separators for LIBs. And the obtained PVA based GPEs exhibit better electrochemical performances, such as ionic conductivity [40–43], discharge C-rate capability and cycling performance, as compared to PP separator, fully applicable to practical application in LIBs [44]; what is more important, the tensile strength of PVA membrane can reach up to 11.5 MPa [44]. Thus, combining outstanding properties of both PVA and LC, the composite matrix membrane and corresponding GPE can obtain outstanding comprehensive performances. In the present work, further investigations were studied to discuss its comprehensive performances."

Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) was obtained from Deyang Weixun Company; Carbon black (Indigo Power Sources, Battery grade) and LA-132 water binder (Indigo Power Sources, Battery grade) were used as received. Liquid electrolyte (1M) with lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DMC/DEC, 1/1/1, v/v/v) was bought from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Company. Lithium metal electrode, aluminum foil and battery cases were purchased from Shenzhen Kejing Star Technology Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of PVA composite LC membranes,"2.2 Preparation of PVA composite LC membranes Firstly, 600 mg LC was introduced into deionized water (80 mL) in one beaker at room temperature; then a suspension was obtained under constant stirring for 20 min. Secondly, 1 g PVA was added into 9 mL deionized water; with constant stirring for 3 h at 90 °C, PVA solution was formed. The final uniform suspension was prepared with a mixing of PVA solution and LC suspension with ultrasonic fragmentation about 40 min. Thirdly, the obtained mixture suspension was cast on a glass plate and then transferred into oven with 60 °C for drying. Finally, after water was evaporated completely, an opaque and dry PVA composite LC membrane was obtained. The labels presented as LC-0, LC-1, LC-2 and LC-3 refer to the prepared membranes with 0 wt.%, 5 wt.%, 15 wt.% and 20 wt.% PVA in composite membranes, respectively."
4,Preparation of GPE,"2.3 Preparation of GPE The prepared composite membranes were punched into circular pieces with diameter of 19 mm. The pieces were dried in vacuum oven at 70 °C for 24 h, and then transferred into a glove box (water and oxygen content less than 0.1 ppm, argon atmosphere). After these pieces absorbed liquid electrolyte about 2 h, corresponding GPEs were obtained and they were named as GLC-0, GLC-1, GLC-2, and GLC-3, respectively."
5,Preparation of electrode,"2.4 Preparation of electrode The LiFePO4 cathode was synthesized with LiFePO4 as active material, carbon black as conducting reagent and LA-132 as a binder. LiFePO4, carbon black, and LA-132 were mixed at a weight ratio of 85:10:5 (w/w/w) with a mortar and pestle to form slurry. The slurry was evenly coated on aluminum foil, using a 100 μm depth scraper and dried at room temperature. Then the coated aluminum foils were punched into small circular (diameter: 14 mm). Last, these cathode round pieces were dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 24 h and then immediately transferred into the glove box for storage."
6,Characterization and performance evaluation,"2.5 Characterization and performance evaluation The surface morphology of the composite membranes was obtained by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) on a measurement (ZEISS EV0 MA15), in which the acceleration voltage is 5 kV. Mechanical tensile property of the obtained membranes was carried out by using an US Masters Industrial Systems (China) CWT6104 tensile testing machine with a crosshead speed of 1 mm min−1. The size of sample was 50 mm (length) × 30 mm (width) × 500 μm (height). The composite membranes were immersed into organic liquid electrolyte to calculate liquid electrolyte uptake (η) according to equation (1): (1) η = W t − W 0 W 0 × 100 % Where W 0 and W t are the mass of composite membrane piece before and after soaked in liquid electrolyte. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were conducted to analyze thermal property of membranes and GPEs by utilizing a thermogravimetric analyzer (METTLER TOLEDO TGA/SDTA85/e/DSC823). The test was measured from 25 °C to 400 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under air. Ionic conductivity was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement on CHI660D electrochemical work station (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.) over the frequency from 1 Hz to 105 Hz. The temperature range is from 30 °C to 50 °C. GPE membranes were sandwiched between stainless steel electrode (SS) and ionic conductivity (δ) was calculated according to equation (2): (2) δ = L R b S Where L is the thickness of GPE membranes, R b is the bulk resistance of GPE and S is the contact area between GPE and SS square. Lithium ion transference number of GPE membranes was estimated by a combination of EIS and Direct Current (DC) polarization proposed by Evans & Abraham method [45]. In the study, symmetric cells of Li/GPE/Li were fabricated. The values can be calculated according to the following equation (3): (3) t Li + = I s ( Δ V − R 0 I 0 ) I 0 ( Δ V − R s I s ) Where I 0 and I s are the initial and steady-state DC current, respectively; R 0 and R s are the initial and steady-state interfacial resistances, respectively; ΔV is the applied polarization potential of 10 mV. The electrochemical stability window of GPE membranes was determined using electrochemical instrument (CHI660D) by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this study, Li/GPE/SS cells were used, in which the SS was used as the working electrode and lithium metal electrode as used as both the counter and reference electrode. The scanning rate was 1 mV s−1 over the range of −1.0 V to 8.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). The compatibility of GPE with lithium metal electrode was determined on CHI660D by EIS using the Li/GPE/Li cell with amplitude of 5 mV. And the frequency is from 0.01 Hz to 105 Hz. Time dependence interfacial resistance (R i) between lithium electrode and GPE was evaluated by monitoring the impedance responses over a period of 35 days. The cells of Li/GPE/LiFePO4 were fabricated to obtain charge-discharge curve, rate capacity and cyclic stability of LIBs. The charge-discharge test was conducted on NEWARE instrument at 0.2 C between 2.0 V and 4.5 V (vs. Li/Li+). The C-rate capability was obtained at the rate of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1.0 C, 1.5 C, 2.0 C and then 0.2 C between 2.0 V and 4.5 V with five cycles for each rate. And these cells were cycled at current density of 1.0 C between 2.0 V and 4.5 V for 150 cycles."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Comprehensive performances of GPEs,"3.1 Comprehensive performances of GPEs As a significant parameter to characterize the property of membranes, higher liquid electrolyte uptake ensures better electrochemical performances of GPEs. Liquid electrolyte uptake of composite membranes is shown in Fig. 1 . Liquid electrolyte uptake of LC-1 is 425 wt.%, which is significantly higher than that of LC-2 (389 wt.%), LC-3 (350 wt.%) and the commercial separator (90.9 wt.%) [46], but lower than that of LC-0 (458 wt.%), implying that with PVA content increasing, LC composite membranes present decreased trend for liquid electrolyte uptake. There are two influence factors. The first one is that matrix structure becomes denser with more PVA occupied in LC membrane, which is confirmed by SEM in Fig. 10 . The second one is the compatibility between matrix and solvent in liquid electrolyte; the more compatibility corresponds to the higher liquid electrolyte uptake value, which is demonstrated by the video file of contact angle. It can be seen obviously in the video file, liquid electrolyte immerged rapidly in all matrixes, and all matrixes can be entirely wetted by liquid electrolyte, showing well compatibility between matrix and solvent in liquid electrolyte. What is more interesting, wetting speed of liquid electrolyte decreases with increase of PVA content, which is well in line with the variation trend of liquid electrolyte uptake. Fig. 2 presents Nyquist plots of all PVA composite LC based GPEs in the temperature range from 30 °C to 50 °C. Apparently shown in these plots, bulk impedance of GPEs gradually decreases with higher temperature, which means that the corresponding ionic conductivity is raised. This can be attributed to the faster ionic carries of lithium ion when temperature increases. In addition, higher temperature endows polymer chains with more flexibility and enhances the segmental mobility, which undoubtedly contributes to ionic conductivity. As is known that ionic conductivity of electrolyte membranes plays a crucial part in whether the membrane can be used in LIBs and has a great influence on the electrochemical performances. As shown in Table 1 , the ionic conductivity of GLC-0, GLC-1, GLC-2, and GLC-3 at 30 °C reaches 4.17 × 10−3, 3.92 × 10−3, 3.20 × 10−3 and 2.50 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. All values of developed GPEs are comparatively higher than that of the separator of Celgard 2730 with commercial liquid electrolyte (0.21 × 10−3 S cm−1) [47]. Meanwhile, obvious downward trend can be observed with PVA in GPEs, which owns to the decrease liquid electrolyte uptake shown in Fig. 1. Notably, the lowest ionic conductivity of GLC-3 (2.50 × 10−3 S cm−1) is still high enough for practical LIBs. The lithium ions movement mechanism in these prepared GPEs was investigated by the following Arrhenius equation (4): (4) log σ = log σ 0 - E a 2.303 R T Where σ is the ionic conductivity of GPE; T is the temperature; σ 0 is the pre-exponential factor; E a is the activation energy and R is the thermodynamic constant. The dependence of ionic conductivity on temperature is shown in Fig. 3. From (a) to (d), the corresponding linear relationship between lg σ and 1/T accords with typical Arrhenius behavior [48]. As listed in Table 2 , the E a values are increased, indicating larger barrier for diffusion and migration of lithium ions in GPEs. This should due to its denser structures of more PVA composite LC membranes and this is in accordance with the variation tendency of electrochemical performances. Being a vital characterization parameter for LIBs, lithium ion transference number (t Li +) plays a critical role in both charge and discharge [49]. Generally, lithium salt in electrolyte dissociates into two kinds of ions (Li+ and PF6 −) and the dual ions move in electrolyte in two opposite directions. Partial anions may accumulate at the surface of GPE membrane, bringing about concentration polarization and causing irreversible capacity loss in the charge and discharge cycles of batteries [50–52]. Hence, a high t Li + can reduce undesirable side reaction from anions and guarantee a high-power output of cells. Fig. 4 displays DC polarization and the Nyquist plots of GPE membranes. All fitting data of Nyquist plots and calculated lithium ion transference numbers of prepared GPE membranes are listed in Table 3 . For GLC-0, the t Li + is highest up to 0.73, whereas more PVA added into LC causes a downtrend of lithium ion transference numbers. The reasons are as follows. As is known that there are so many components in the composite GPEs, including LC, PVA, lithium salt and plasticizers, thus the interaction within these components must be complicated. Large amount of hydroxyl in polymer matrix (LC and PVA) form hydrogen bonds with polar groups of CO and COOR in liquid electrolyte (including a, b, c and h) while strong hydrogen fluoride bonds are formed between the polymer matrix and PF6 − (including d, e, f, g) as illustrated in Fig. 5. These strong hydrogen fluoride bonds can promote the decomposition of lithium salt and retard the movement of PF6 −. Meantime, both the LC and organic solvent have a certain number of polar groups, which can hinder the transference of lithium ions through columbic forces (including w, x, y, and z) as shown in Fig. 5. With more PVA added, less available hydroxyl as well as polar groups shows up on LC. All the interactions such as hydrogen bonds (including a, b, c, d, f, g and h) and columbic forces (including w, x, y, and z) are weakened, which allows rapid transference of both lithium ions and PF6 −. The resulting transferences of the GLC-1, GLC-2 and GLC-3 are 0.63, 0.62 and 0.59, respectively, indicating that with addition of PVA, the correlation in the composite matrix compels PF6 − to transfer more easily than lithium ions. As a consequence, the obtained GPEs present a decline for lithium transferences. Remarkably, the lowest value of GLC-3 (0.59) is still much higher than that of the commercial separator Celgard 2730 (0.27) [53], implying the obtained GPEs are enough to satisfy the actual request of LIBs. It is generally well-known that the oxidation decomposition of organic solvent such as EC, DEC and DMC in liquid electrolyte is under higher working voltage over 4.4 V (vs. Li/Li+). The working voltage that is far higher over 4.4 V can result in large amount of gas produced inside battery, which may cause serious blast and burning problems. The electrochemical stability window of GPEs are studied by LSV in the potential range from −1.0-8.0 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in Fig. 6(a). There is almost no change in the oxidation current of all GPEs before 5.1 V, indicating the excellent electrochemical stability of GPEs based on PVA composite LC are obtained. This is attributed to good wettability, which promotes the formation of hydrogen bonds between matrix and liquid electrolyte and postpones the decomposition of electrolytes at high voltage. The current between 0 and 1.0 V is corresponding to the stripping of lithium, until the voltage reaches up to 5.1 V, the curve appears a slight current rise, suggesting the decomposition start of electrolyte. What is even more interesting is that the GLC-2 shows best electrochemical stability with the decomposition voltage of 5.4 V, while this value shows 5.3, 5.2, 5.1 V of GLC-0, GLC-1 and GLC-3, respectively. In GPE system, the hydrogen bonds between liquid electrolyte and LC matrix also can postpone electrolyte decomposition. Furthermore, LC fibers cover with PVA molecule in PVA composite LC systems, and form gelation state which hinders the process of electrolyte decomposition in high voltage. These can be seen in Fig. 6(b). For GLC-0 and GLC-1, the little content of PVA do little influence, the decreased number of hydrogen bonds caused by liquid electrolyte uptake (Fig. 1) becomes the leading factor and leads to the declined decomposition voltage. When the content of PVA increases to 10 wt.% (GLC-2), the gelled PVA molecule makes the decomposition process difficult to conduct in lower voltage, and this also overcomes the effect of hydrogen bonds, thus showing higher decomposition voltage compared with GLC-0 and GLC-1. However, this balance is offset in the case of GLC-3, the drastically reduced hydrogen bonds greatly limits the usage in high voltage, and the gelled PVA molecule show weaker influence, so obtains the lower value of 5.1 V. That is to say, the GLC-2 obtains best performance in the test of electrochemical stability. Additionally, the electrochemical stability window of polypropylene (PP) separator was studied by LSV in the potential range from −1.0-8.0 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in Fig. S1. As shown in Fig. S1, the decomposition voltage of all GPEs are higher than that of PP separator (4.5 V), showing promising application potential."
9,Mechanical property of membranes,"3.2 Mechanical property of membranes As known that mechanical strength influences the application of GPEs in LIBs, especially in large-scale energy storage systems [54]. Usually, the mechanical property of GPE membrane has positive correlation with that of corresponding matrix membrane. Fig. 7 presents the stress-stain curves of composited LC membranes with different PVA contents. The LC-0 membrane exhibits a relatively weak mechanical strength (0.85 MPa), which don't satisfy practical application for LIBs production. The stress strengths associated to LC-1, LC-2 and LC-3 are 3.54, 10.09 and 11.45 MPa, respectively. These values are 4–11 times higher than that of LC-0, definitely confirming that the incorporation of PVA produces a positive impact on the improvement of mechanical properties. These results can be ascribed to two aspects: PVA in GPEs acts like glues to tightly stick the LC fiber together; the PVA composite LC membrane owns dense structure. Fig. S1 presents the stress-stain curve of PP separator. Although the PP separator exhibits a higher mechanical strength than the PVA composite LC membranes, mechanical property of the PVA composite LC membranes is enough to satisfy the actual application of LIBs."
10,Compatibility with anode and cell property,"3.3 Compatibility with anode and cell property From the above investigation, among three composited electrolytes of GLC-1, GLC-2 and GLC-3, GLC-1 has better liquid electrolyte uptake, ionic conductivity and lithium ion transference number. What is more important, the enhanced mechanical behavior of LC-1 is high enough to use as a matrix to prepare GPE. For electrochemical stability, although GLC-1 is not the best among three composited GPEs, its electrochemical stability is high enough for practical application. Therefore, GLC-1 will be chosen for further investigation. The compatibility between electrolyte and lithium metal anode has a great influence on safety and cycle performance for practical application in LIBs, which can be elucidated by the interfacial impedance (R i) between electrolyte and electrode [55,56]. The EIS curves of assembled Li/GLC-1/Li cells were obtained with different storage days of set up, 1 day, 5 days, 10 days and 35 days, respectively. In Fig. 8, all the fitting EIS curves exhibit a semicircle at high frequency corresponding to passivation layer resistance (R p). Meanwhile, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) on lithium metal electrode belongs to the intermediate frequency semicircle in EIS curves. More importantly, the summation of R p and R ct is corresponded to interface resistance (R i). All the values based on fitting curves are listed in Table 4 . It can be seen in both Fig. 8 and Table 4 that the value of R i mainly depends on R p, whereas R ct has no tremendously change with storage days. The raised R p with days must be ascribed to the changeable thickness and structure of the formed passivation layer with storage days. As shown in Table 4, R p increases from 135.20 Ω after 1 day to 196.32 Ω after 10 days, which is consistent with the formation of passivation layer on the lithium metal electrode. Furthermore, there is a small growth of R p from 10 days to 35 days, suggesting that the passivation layer resistance is stable during this stage. This small change definitely demonstrates that the stable passivation layer resistance has grown completely. As for the increased magnitude of R ct, it gradually rises from 1.68 Ω after 1 day to 1.94 Ω after 5 days and decreases to 0.88 Ω after 10 days and to 0.13 Ω after 25 days. All these results illustrate that GLC-1 presents excellent compatibility between electrode and GPE. Additionally, the EIS curves of assembled Li/PP/Li cell were obtained with different storage days of set up, 1 day, 5 days and 15 days, respectively. As shown in Fig. S3, all the fitting EIS curves exhibit a semicircle at high frequency and the intermediate frequency semicircle. All the values based on fitting curves are listed in Table S1. There is a small growth of R p from 10 days to 15 days suggesting that the passivation layer resistance is stable during this stage and the stable passivation layer resistance has grown completely; while the value of R i is much higher than that of the Li/GLC-1/Li cell, demonstrating that Li/GLC-1/Li cell has better interfacial impedance compatibility than Li/PP/Li cell. Fig. 9(a) shows the charge-discharge curves of Li/GPE/LiFePO4 cell using GLC-1 as electrolyte and separator at room temperature at various C-rates of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1.0 C, 1.5 C and 2.0 C. Definitely found in the profiles, the charging and discharging potential platforms can be observed from 3.11 V (vs. Li/Li+) to 3.72 V, which agrees well with the two phase co-existence reaction for LiFePO4 cathode [57,58]. As the C-rate increases, the potential difference of charge and discharge gradually ranges from 0.14 V at 0.2 C to 0.24 V at 0.5 C, to 0.37 V at 1.0 C, to 0.48 V at 1.5 C and to 0.63 V at 2.0 C, showing that the charging plateau rises while the discharging plateau continuously decreases with C-rates and this is because of increased polarization in the cell. The reversible specific capacity for GLC-1 at 0.2 C (153 mA h g−1) is much higher than that of commercial separator 2730 with liquid electrolyte (about 126 mA h g−1) [46], which is mainly attributed to higher lithium ion transference number and higher lithium ionic conductivity in GLC-1 than those in the Celgard 2730. A higher t Li + can guarantee the occurrence of redox reactions even at a high current density by eliminating concentration gradients within the electrolyte. The rate behavior of cell is presented in Fig. 9(b). Conducted in the successive C-rate behaviors, excellent and stable discharge capacity can be obtained from 153 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C to 133 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C and to 118 mA h g−1 at 1.0 C and to 109 mA h g−1 at 1.5 C and to 99 mA h g−1 at 2.0 C and back to 148 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, which exhibits higher reversible capacity. The drastic falling of capacity at higher C-rates is the result of comprehensive consequences of two influence factors: the increased concentration polarization caused by incomplete reversible electrode reaction of Li+ + e− →Li at a higher density; the increased ohmic resistance resulting from thickened passivation layer. The cycling performance and coulombic efficiencies of cells based on GLC-1 between 2.5 V and 4.2 V are presented in Fig. 9(c). After 150 cycles at 1.0 C, there is no dramatic capacity fading and all the efficiencies are between 98% and 100%. This is mainly because of the high t Li + and the stable passivation layer forming on the lithium metal surface, which ensures easier transport of the ions, thereby resulting in a good cycling performance."
11,Micro-morphology and thermal properties,"3.4 Micro-morphology and thermal properties In terms of all excellent comprehensive performances of GLC-1, micromorphology of LC-1 was analyzed. Fig. 10(a) and (b) presents the SEM images of surface of LC-0 and LC-1, respectively. In Fig. 10(a), the LC-0 exhibits porous network structure with long LC fiber plates overlapped each other. The large number of cavities must contribute to higher adsorption of liquid electrolyte, while this porous structure can also lead to poor mechanical tensile property. In Fig. 10(b), we can see that LC-1 not only still maintains porous network structures but also becomes more compact; furthermore, the surface of LC fibers is smooth since partial LC fibers are entangled with PVA to stick together. Therefore, LC-1 presents significantly enhanced mechanical property and GLC-1 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance. Fig. 11 presents the TGA-DSC curves of LC-1 and GLC-1. It can be seen that LC-1 is thermally stable until 225 °C, which is high enough as one kind of matrix used in GPE. In Fig. 11(a), the initial small mass loss occurred in the temperature range from 25 °C to 100 °C, which should be attributed to the removal of free water, physical-adsorption water and crystal water in LC-1. The mass loss in the stage from 225 °C to 387 °C must be associated with the thermal decomposition reaction of PVA and LC. While in the corresponding DSC curve, the first small endothermic peak at 79 °C is the resulting of the dissociation of hydrogen bonds in matrix system [59–62] and evaporation of trace water as well as glass transition of PVA (T g) [63]; the second obvious endothermic peak at 223 °C corresponds to the melting temperature (T m) of PVA [63,64]. The small exothermic peak at 286 °C is corresponded to the thermal decomposition of side chain hydroxyl groups of PVA [65,66] while the exothermic peak at 366 °C is related to thermal decomposition of LC in TGA. In Fig. 11(b), there is very slight mass loss until 100 °C. The observation of TGA curve illustrates that there are two main mass loss procedures of GLC-1: the drastic mass loss from 100 °C to 200 °C is the result of the evaporation of organic solvent in GLC-1; the second mass loss stage from 200 °C to 313 °C is the result of decomposition of PVA and LC in the polymer matrix. In terms of DSC curve, the presentation of DSC curve still expresses two obvious sharp peaks. The first endothermic peak at 61 °C is the reflection of dissociation of hydrogen bonds in GLC-1 and the glass transition of PVA. This temperature at 61 °C is lower than that of LC-1 at 79 °C, which is mainly because of gelation of PVA, in which the free volume of PVA is increased and the glass transition temperature (T g) decreases. The first sharp endothermic peak at 197 °C is the reflection of evaporation of organic solvent. The sharp exothermic peak at 275 °C is corresponded to the decomposition of LC, which belongs to the second mass loss in TGA curve. On account of above discussion, all the results show that both LC-1 and GLC-1 express excellent thermal stability. GLC-1 is thermal stable below 100 °C, suggesting the organic solvent in electrolyte is very stable."
12,Conclusion,"In this study, a kind of low-cost, environment-friendly GPE based on PVA composite LC for LIBs was prepared. With the addition of PVA, a significant enhancement in tensile strength of composite membranes can be obtained comparing to pure LC. When the proportion of PVA is 5 wt.%, GPE shows outstanding thermal property in the DGA-DSC test and high enough electrolyte uptake (425 wt.%). Meanwhile, the obtained GPE presents excellent ionic conductivity (3.92 × 10−3 S cm−1), high lithium ion transference number (0.63) at room temperature, outstanding electrochemical stability and suitable compatibility between the electrode and GPE. Moreover, at 1.0 C, the GLC-1 showed a relatively high discharge specific capacity of 123 mA h g−1 and the capacity retention is between 98% and 100% after 150 cycles. Therefore, all these outstanding comprehensive performances endow the prepared GPE an optimized application potential in GPE for LIBs."
