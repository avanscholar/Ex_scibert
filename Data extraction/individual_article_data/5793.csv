0,Introduction,"CO2 hydrogenation plays a significant role in environmental remediation. It composes of two steps: 1) a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction over a transition metal such as iron, cobalt, nickel, etc. and 2) Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Those steps are shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) [1]: (1) RWGS: CO2 +H2 ⇄CO+H2O ΔRH573K =+38kJ/mol (2) FTS: nCO+(2n+1)H2 →CnH2n+2 +nH2O ΔRH573K =−166kJ/mol FTS is the reaction of syngas (CO+H2) converting into long chain hydrocarbons, i.e. alkanes, alkenes and/or oxygenated compounds in the presence of a transition metal, either iron or cobalt, etc. Iron is mainly used, due to its activity for both RWGS and FTS. It forms active species via CO decomposition, producing surface carbon which may react in several ways forming iron carbides. At the steady state of FTS, the iron catalyst could be constructed according to the degree of catalyst alkalization and composition of the syngas [2]. Riedel et al. [2] reported that the episodes (the period of reaction time in minutes) of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (over Fe-Al-Cu-K catalyst) corresponded to the real catalyst structure and composition. For the reaction of H2/CO2 syngas, the steady state of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is reached in 2500–5000min, which is much more than that resulting from H2/CO syngas (about 1000min), because of less CO being available. The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction with H2/CO2 syngas occurred during 100–1000min reaction time producing CO from CO2 (Eq. (1)). It has been concluded that the consumption of CO by FTS causes overall low CO yield. The catalyst construction process is the same, either CO or CO2 being the reactants in the hydrogenation process over alkaline promoted catalysts. A catalyst support also plays an important role for active species dispersion and stabilizing the catalyst in its active state during the reaction time. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are chosen as the support for many applications, such as magnetic materials, sensors and catalysts [3]. Recently, the conversion of syngas to hydrocarbons and to alcohols using metal catalysts supported on carbon materials have been developed [4]. In the catalysis of FTS over an iron catalyst, the reduction of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 forming iron carbide as the active catalyst is an important step, which could be more facile for a carbon-supported iron catalyst, with a weak interaction between iron and carbon [4,5]. Using CNTs as the support, the carbon-iron (π-d) interaction of curve surface of CNTs facilitates the reduction process [6], and nitrogen of N-functionalized CNT (NCNT) causes some distortion on such interaction [4]. It is also important in the catalysis of FTS to have iron in the reduced form during the reaction time, thus used iron catalysts within the confined environment as CNTs should be reduced much easily [3,4]. It has been tested that the method of preparation of Fe/CNT did not affect the conversion of the syngas [7]. CNT modification with 10M nitric acid produced high degree of iron dispersion inside NCNTs, and the catalysts showed high reducibility, which enhanced the FTS performance [8]. The catalyst particles do not form strong interactions with the carbon support, thus their activities are higher than that on oxide supports, such as SiO2 [1,4]. Chew et al. used H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and in situ XANES to show that iron oxides nanoparticles on NCNT were easier to reduce than those on OCNT indicating low interaction between iron oxides and NCNT. Scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) images showed iron oxide nanoparticles located within the NCNT [1]. CO2 adsorption, on catalyst surface, also plays an important role in the FTS reaction. For example, 1,4-bis(hydroxydimethylsilyl) benzene was used to modified zeolite surface and altered the surface property of the catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation [9]. Potassium is known as an electronic promoter of the iron catalyst for FTS over promoted Fe/CNTs, producing high molecular weight alkanes and alkenes [9]. Potassium also decreases methane production and increases WGS. A potassium promoter increases the strength of CO chemisorption and suppresses that of hydrogenation, which causes a high concentration ratio of CO to H2 on catalyst surfaces, therefore causing low hydrogenation activity and high alkene selectivity [10]. Jiang et al. [11] investigated the effects of potassium on iron-manganese catalysts by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using NO, CO and CO+H2 as probes. The potassium species coordinates with iron species and promotes iron oxide reduction forming fine metallic iron clusters. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the K 2p levels showed that potassium forms oxides on the iron catalyst surface. It is not covered by carbon, but appears on top of the carbon layer [12]. Xiong et al. [13] found that sodium- and potassium- promoted Fe/CNT for FTS decreased the selectivity of methane, increased the selectivity of alkene and shifted the selectivity of products to higher alkanes and alkenes, compared to the results of the unpromoted Fe/CNT catalyst. The sodium-promoted catalyst showed better activity. Yang et al. [10] showed that the catalysts are further reduced during FTS reaction. As illustrated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the addition of potassium promoted the formation of iron carbides during the FT reaction. When the potassium loading increased, carbon deposition was significantly enhanced. The influence of potassium content on the selectivity of alkenes under different temperatures, is consistent with its effect on the strength of carbon monoxide and hydrogen chemisorption. Manganese, in the form of MnO, has been used as a chemical promoter to develop the chemisorption of the syngas and as a structural promoter to stabilize the iron-active phase during the FTS [14]. It stabilizes the active species against agglomeration during the reduction reaction with the syngas. The effect of manganese promotion of the iron catalyst is in a limited concentration range [15]. Manganese-to-iron ratios higher than 0.05 decreases the production of C2-C5, C6+ and oxygenated products due to high CH4 formation. It was assumed that high manganese loadings produce high amount of manganese oxide on the surface during the reaction, which could block CO or CO2 to the active iron phase. The blockage of such phases by the amorphous MnOx phases should be avoided [15]. Manganese and potassium promoters coated on carbon nanotubes (MnK-CNTs) as the catalyst support, then impregnated by iron (Fe/MnK-CNTs with 7.9wt% Fe, 15.7wt% Mn and 1.9wt% K), were used for the direct conversion of syngas to lower alkenes. The as-synthesized Fe/MnK-CNTs catalyst compared with the FeMnK/CNTs catalyst prepared by co-impregnation showed better catalytic performance, leading to high selectivity for C2-C4 alkenes, which were due to uniform nanoparticles, well distributed promoters, the weak iron-CNT support interaction and the defects on CNTs of the unique structural transformation of MnK-CNTs [16]. However, metal-support interactions do not affect the promoter properties [4]. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) provides structural and chemical information on the element of interest, namely, iron or cobalt of the catalyst [17]. The XANES technique is suitable for characterization of nanocrystals when limited using XRD [18]. However, iron catalyst phases can be sensitive to environmental conditions, especially oxidation after removing from the reactor. Thus, iron phases should be monitored using an in situ cell under the high temperature reduction conditions needed for CO2 hydrogenation. CO2 hydrogenation, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction followed by the FTS under suitable conditions, produces valuable chemicals such as alkenes or oxygenated hydrocarbons. FTS over an iron catalyst involves many proposed mechanisms which are developed from ideas resulting from the observed products and the conditions, such as high or low pressure and temperature operations [19]. For low temperature FTS, iron carbide forms during the reaction, which involves in the reaction mechanism [19]. The promoted catalyst undergoes restructuring under the reaction conditions which has an influence on chain growth and hydrocarbon distribution. Particular product distributions, of alkanes, alkenes, etc. could be achieved by controlling catalyst composition which affects the selectivity of secondary reactions [20]. “Time resolved product selectivity analysis” [21] provides information on product desorption (methane, alkanes, alkenes and oxygenated compounds), which is useful for evaluating a promoted catalyst, especially at the steady state. Product selectivity and distribution during CO2 hydrogenation by K- and Mn-promoted Fe catalysts supported on NCNT was the focus of this work. Fe/NCNT, K/Fe/NCNT, Mn/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT were used for the hydrogenation reaction. Alkenes and alcohols, important chemicals for further petrochemical processes, recovered from CO2 emission gas, were of interest. Product distributions of alkanes and alkenes during the CO2 hydrogenation of all catalysts were used to investigate Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalyst performances. Time-resolved XANES reduction was also used for catalyst characterization of iron phases for the reaction."
1,Material and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation [22],"2.1 Catalyst preparation [22] Carbon nanotubes (Pyrograf III, diameter 70–200nm, length 50–100μm from Applied Sciences) were pretreated with HNO3 vapor at 473K for 24h to obtain the oxygen-functionalized CNT (OCNT) [23] and dried at 333K for 24h. The OCNT was then treated in flowing NH3 (10vol% in He) at 673K for 6h with a flow rate of 25.50cm3 min−1, to give the nitrogen-functionalized CNT (NCNT) with about 5.9% of nitrogen concentration [1]. Iron catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method using ammonium ferric citrate (C6H8O7·xFe·xNH3) as the iron precursor [24]. The NCNT was immersed in an aqueous solution of ammonium ferric citrate to achieve iron loading (40.0wt% Fe). To prepare a Mn-promoted iron catalyst, an aqueous solution of 10.0wt% Mn in manganese(II) nitrate hydrate, Mn(NO3)2·xH2O, was mixed with an aqueous solution of ammonium ferric citrate. The as-prepared catalyst was calcined at 573K with a heating rate of 2K min−1 in flowing synthetic air (100.0cm3 min−1) for 90min. To obtain the K-promoted iron catalyst (K/Mn/Fe/NCNT), the calcined sample was suspended in an aqueous solution of 1.5wt%K of potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Subsequently, the impregnated catalyst was dried at 333K."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The catalyst compositions were determined quantitatively using an atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) (Varian AA300). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Panalytical MPD diffractometer to determine the crystalline phases of the catalysts, using CuKα (λ=1.54Å), an electron current of 40mA and an accelerating voltage of 45kV. The spectra were scanned with step size of 0.02° in the 2Ө range of 20–80°. The crystalline phase was identified by comparison data from the inorganic crystal structure database, ICSD. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed at beam line 2.2 of the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), Thailand. Samples were prepared as 4.0mm diameter pellets. Fe K-edge XANES measurements were carried out in transmission mode. Iron metal foil was used for energy calibration at 7112eV. Data processing was performed using the Athena software. Iron metal foil, FeO, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 were used as references."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing The experimental method for CO2 hydrogenation set-up and testing is described in detail elsewhere [25]. A catalyst 40mg was mixed with 160mg of SiC and loaded between quartz plugs in a reactor. Before the catalytic test, the catalyst mixture was reduced in flowing H2 (50cm3 min−1) at 653K for 5h. The reactor was then cooled to 633K in flowing Ar (30cm3 min−1) to remove residual H2. The reactant gases, 7.5cm3 min−1 CO2 mixed with 22.5cm3 min−1 H2 and 3.3cm3 min−1 Ar, flowed continuously to the reactor through the catalyst bed with a space velocity of 50dm3 g−1 h−1 at 633K and 25bar. The products were directly analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2010 plus) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two flame ionization detectors (FID), with argon as an internal standard."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The percentage masses of the elemental compositions in the catalysts were analyzed by AAS as shown in Table 1 . The XRD patterns of the unpromoted and promoted Fe/NCNT are illustrated in Fig. 1 [22]. Peaks at 26.3° and 44.8° can be assigned to the (002) and (111) planes, respectively, of the hexagonal graphite structures of CNT. For Fe/NCNT, the peaks at 30.2°, 35.6° and 62.5° corresponded to the magnetite (Fe3O4) phase. When manganese was added to Fe/NCNT, the intensity of the peaks at 30.2°, 35.6° and 62.5° became weaker, which can be attributed to the loss of crystallinity of Fe3O4. A broad peak observed between 32°–34° can be attributed to Fe2O3 (33.2°). When potassium was added to Mn/Fe/NCNT, the intensity of the peaks at 35.6° and 62.5° became stronger. However, Fe3O4 was the major iron phase of all catalysts. In situ XANES spectra of K/Fe/NCNT reduction from 323K to 653K with 300min holding time are shown in Fig. 2 . Table 2 gives the phase compositions of the iron catalysts, K/Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT, as deduced from linear combination analyses of XANES spectra before and after reduction. In the case of K/Fe/NCNT, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 phases were detected during reduction for 60min, and Fe, FeO, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 phases were detected during 300min holding time. Mn/Fe/NCNT exhibited only the Fe3O4 phase during 60min reduction time, and a mixture of FeO and Fe3O4 during the holding time for 300min. Figs. 3 a and b shows the phase compositions of K/Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT catalysts deduced from the linear combination analysis of the XANES spectra during reduction and holding time. When Fe/NCNT was promoted with potassium (K/Fe/NCNT), Fe2O3 was reduced well to Fe3O4, and then further to FeO until it reached 2.2% at 623K. The reducibility of FeO increased to 14.5% Fe, 1.2% FeO, with some remaining 15.7% Fe3O4 and 68.6% Fe2O3 after 300min holding time. In the case of Mn/Fe/NCNT, 100.0% Fe3O4 was observed until 653K. Fe3O4 reduction started after holding at 653K, reaching 14.8% FeO after holding at 653K for 300min. From the reduction phases of iron via XANES, it indicated that with the manganese promoter, the percentage of the phase compositions from the reduction decreased. Manganese influences the iron-containing species by forming MnO, causing high stability of FeO, which can be reduced at higher temperature [14]. By comparison, potassium-promoted Fe/NCNT was reduced to 14.5% Fe after holding at 653K for 300min (the FTS condition), indicating that the potassium-promoted Fe/NCNT could provide active iron for carbide formation available for FTS."
7,CO2 hydrogenation,"3.2 CO2 hydrogenation For the hydrogenation reaction, the catalysts a) Fe/NCNT, b) K/Fe/NCNT, c) Mn/Fe/NCNT and d) K/Mn/Fe/NCNT were used. Growth probability and product selectivities are discussed. 3.2.1 CO2 conversion and product selectivities at the steady state CO2 conversion over all catalysts was ca. 30–35%. To study product selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation over the catalysts; a) Fe/NCNT, b) K/Fe/NCNT, c) Mn/Fe/NCNT and d) K/Mn/Fe/NCNT, those of n-alkanes, alkenes and alcohols at 60h reaction time are illustrated in Fig. 4 (a–d). Methane produced from Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT was ca. 70mol%. Methanation occurs from the metal active sites for hydrogenation but not for FTS [21]. Besides, a Mn/Fe catalyst supported on NCNT could cause methane formation by hydrogenolytic cleavage of alkenes [20], due to a high H2: CO ratio on the metal surface. The results from K/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT were ca. 25mol%, due to low hydrogen dissociation corresponding to the potassium-promoted catalysts suppressing methane formation [5]. Alkane selectivity from the Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT catalysts was maximum at C3 (ca. 5–10%) but decreased for higher carbon numbers indicating that propane products were produced from both the FT and the readsorption sites [21]. For the reaction over the K/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT catalysts, n-alkane selectivity was low at C2 with small amounts of long chain hydrocarbons up to C6. Among alkene products of different carbon numbers, alkenes selectivity from the Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT catalysts was high at C2 (ca. 20%) but decreased for the high carbon numbers, together with high CH4 selectivity of 70%, indicating that a high local H2:CO ratio causes CH4 formation by hydrogenolysis of alkenes [20]. With potassium-promoted catalysts, ethene selectivity was low due to ethanol formation but the selectivities of higher alkenes were high and decreased with high carbon numbers. Alcohol selectivity was obtained in terms of ethanol for 10% from the potassium-promoted catalysts only. Mn/Fe/NCNT produced methanol only in small amounts. 3.2.2 Product distributions and growth probability of n-alkane Product distributions in terms of log (mole of n-alkane) as a function of carbon number for Fe/NCNT, K/Fe/NCNT, Mn/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT at 60h are shown in Fig. 5 a. Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT catalysts show high values at Nc =1, low values at Nc =2 and straight lines with no further changes of slopes at high carbon numbers, referred to high CH4 selectivity and at Nc =2, explained by C2 dissociation to CH4 [20] or ethene secondary reaction [2]. The n-alkane distribution of each catalyst at 60h indicated the production of high n-alkanes. FTS polymerization can be characterized by the growth probability, pg, [21]. It is shown as a horizontal line in the diagram of pg over carbon numbers in the case of ideal polymerization behaviour [20,21,26]. Fig. 5b shows the growth probabilities of n-alkanes from FTS over Fe/NCNT, K/Fe/NCNT, Mn/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT at 60h [2,27]. The growth probabilities of the products from four catalysts can be discussed in two groups, Fe/NCNT without and with potassium promoted catalysts. A low pg-value at Nc =1 for Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT referred to high CH4-selectivity and a high pg-value at Nc =2, explained by ethene re-adsorption and proceeded secondary reactions producing ethane in Scheme 1 [2]. The pg-values at Nc =3 resulting from both Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT catalysts were ca. 0.2 and increased to 0.4atNc =5, due to 1-alkene re-adsorption forming n-alkanes. The growth probability of polymerization on potassium-promoted catalysts (K/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT) was almost constant at 60h indicating the steady state of FTS over the potassium-promoted catalysts [2]. The pg-value in the range of 0.6 was independent of carbon number and higher than those resulting from Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT. The pg-values at Nc =2 resulting from the potassium-promoted catalyst were ca. 0.1 indicating low selectivity for ethane due to ethanol formation. The products of the potassium-promoted catalysts corresponded to those reported by Riedel et al. [2], such that at the steady state with H2/CO2 and H2/CO, pg at Nc =1 is even higher than pg at Nc =2. It indicated that methane forms a little, meaning that methane desorption (CH3 +H=CH4) is slow even if it has a high tendency for methane formation according to thermodynamics. Riedel et al. [2] reported that FTS with a H2/CO2 syngas is feasible only on the alkaline-promoted iron catalysts. 3.2.3 Product distributions of alkene content and the growth site of FT synthesis Product distributions in terms of alkene content in mol% as a function of carbon number over all catalysts at 60h are shown in Fig. 6 . With the potassium-promoted catalysts, the alkene content was high at Nc =3 and decreased to 10–2mol% (forNc =4−7), which corresponded to the primary selectivity [2]. With the non-potassium promoted catalysts, deviation was consistent for secondary reactions of 1-alkenes, i.e. double bond hydrogenation and double bond shift (Scheme 2 ) [2]. With increasing carbon number, the hydrogenation of double bonds increases, mainly due to the carbon number increasing the reactor residence time. Alkene secondary reactions are mostly observed when FT catalyst formation is slow especially with the H2/CO2 syngas. The growth site of FT synthesis can be indicated by a 1-alkene [28] such as 1-butene desorbs from an FT intermediate on an FT growth site [17]. The mol% of 1-butene produced from each catalyst as a function of time is shown in Fig. 7 . 1-Butene resulting from K/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT was constant at 10 mol% during 40–60h, meaning that the FT growth site was constant at the steady state. Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT produced negligible amount of 1-butene. The catalysts with high percentages of iron and manganese promoted iron produced mainly CH4 from the early stage and retained the sites until it reached the steady state. In this case the FTS steady state occurs in a longer reaction time. 3.2.4 Alcohol formation Mol% of alcohols as a function of carbon number, Nc, resulted from CO2 hydrogenation over Fe/NCNT, K/Fe/NCNT, Mn/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT at 60h are shown in Fig. 8 . Ethanol was mainly produced with the potassium-promoted catalysts. However, the other two catalysts also produced traces of methanol and propanol. The formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons (i.e. alcohols) has been explained as follows: CO dissociates on iron, following by adsorption, COad =Cad +Oad, forming adsorbed oxygen, which reacts with adsorbed hydrogen, Oad +Had =OHad, forming chemisorbed OH, available on the surface for the reaction with hydrocarbon species such as alkylidenes (R-CH2-CH=) as shown in Scheme 3 [2];"
8,Catalyst performance,"3.3 Catalyst performance CO2 conversions over Fe/NCNT, K/Fe/NCNT, Mn/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT at 60h were around 30–35%, with K/Mn/Fe/NCNT giving the best results in terms of high conversion and constant performance during 60h reaction time. The first step is a reverse water gas shift (Eq. (1)) and the second step is the FTS (Eq. (2)), which produced mainly FT products, described in alkanes and alkenes selectivities distributed over carbon numbers. From the XANES results, potassium-promoted Fe/NCNT was reduced to 14.5% Fe after holding at 653K for 300min (the FTS condition), so one can assume that the potassium-promoted Fe/NCNT can provide active iron for carbide formation available for FTS. Catalyst performances is divided into two groups; products resulting from Group I (iron catalyst without potassium-promotion: Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT) and those resulting from Group II (iron catalysts with potassium-promotion: K/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT). Group I catalysts produced mainly CH4, with small amounts of alkenes at high carbon number. In a confined environment with high local H2:CO, hydrogenolysis of alkenes could occur, due to the hydrogenation site. One assumed that FeO on the catalyst acts as an alkene adsorption site [20]. With the XANES reduction of Mn/Fe/NCNT, FeO was the main iron species, along the period of holding time, thus it can adsorb alkenes producing small alkanes as final products. The product distributions for the Group II catalysts included high alkenes from C3-C6. From the growth site of FT synthesis, indicated by 1-butene desorption from an FT intermediate on an FT growth site, 1-butene resulting from K/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT was constant during 40–60h (Fig. 4), meaning that the FT growth site was constant at the steady state. The catalyst with the potassium promoter (K/Fe/NCNT) was reduced to Fe and FeO as the active sites for RWGS and FT reactions as confirmed by XANES. Potassium weakens the CO bond in the promoted Fe catalyst [5], producing CHx species for chain formation. Besides, H2O, the product from the reverse water gas shift in the first step, can easily adsorb onto the potassium-promoted catalysts and add to an alkene product such as ethene to produce ethanol as by product. However, manganese also plays an important role as a structural promoter inhibiting the iron active site on NCNT from agglomeration during the high temperature reduction as examined by XANES."
9,Conclusions,"Product distributions and growth probability of n-alkanes during CO2 hydrogenation indicated that the alkaline-promoted iron catalysts (K/Fe/NCNT, K/Mn/Fe/NCNT) performed Fischer-Tropsch (FT) steady state around 60h. The time-resolved XANES reduction showed mixed phases of Fe, FeO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 resulting from K/Fe/NCNT and FeO and Fe3O4 resulting from Mn/Fe/NCNT. The potassium-promoted Fe/NCNT can provide active iron for carbide formation available for FTS. The catalyst performance is divided into two groups: Group I (the potassium unpromoted catalysts: Fe/NCNT and Mn/Fe/NCNT) and Group II (the potassium promoted catalysts: K/Fe/NCNT and K/Mn/Fe/NCNT). Group I catalysts produced mainly CH4, small amount of alkenes with high carbon number. The product distributions of Group II included high alkenes from C3-C6. Potassium promotion on the Fe/NCNT catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation could be assumed to provide active sites for alkene and alcohol formation. The reduced surrounding of NCNT support, the potassium electronic promoter together with the manganese structural promoter maintained the iron phases as the active catalyst well suitable for CO2 hydrogenation producing mainly alkenes and ethanol."
