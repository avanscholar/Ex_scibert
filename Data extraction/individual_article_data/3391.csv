0,Introduction,"The use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier could reduce environmental pollution from fossil fuels [1–3]. The future prospects of hydrogen energy depend primarily on the development of suitable technologies for the safe and cost-effective storage and transportation of hydrogen. Over the past decades, various hydrogen storage methods have been investigated [4–7], including hydrogen compression in pressurized containers, hydrogen adsorption as metal hydrides, cryogenic storage using hydrogen adsorption materials, hydrogen liquefaction, and hydrogenation of organic compounds (organic hydrogen carriers). Discussions based on the results of these studies have indicated that there are many environmental, economic, technical, and social advantages of organic hydrogen carriers in storing hydrogen [8–12]. From an environmental viewpoint, hydrogen storage system using organic hydrogen carriers can maintain a closed carbon cycle, thus dramatically reducing chemical and thermal pollution caused by the release of toxic gases. Economic considerations suggest that hydrogen storage systems using organic hydrogen carriers will not require large capital investments, as the technology is compatible with the existing energy infrastructure. Furthermore, from a technical viewpoint, hydrogen storage systems using organic hydrogen carriers are promising for both mobile and stationary applications, with further research and development expected to provide considerable advancements. From the social perspective, the handling of organic hydrogen carriers is not so much different from the gasoline used today, and it is expected to be accepted through the process of its dissemination. For these reasons, hydrogen storage systems based on organic hydrogen carriers will become very competitive for energy storage in the near future. To realize effective hydrogen storage based on organic hydrogen carriers, it is important to achieve reversibility, which requires high efficiencies for both the reaction that hydrogenates the medium to store hydrogen and the reaction that extracts hydrogen through dehydrogenation. It is also essential that the selected medium has a high gravimetric capacity of hydrogen. In this paper, we introduce examples of reversible dehydrogenation reactions (hydrogen release process) and hydrogenation reactions (hydrogen storage process) using organic hydrogen carriers, along with the types of catalysts used in each reaction and their characteristics. Hydrogen storage systems using various kinds of organic hydrogen carriers will be described. Furthermore, an ammonia-borane and related compounds, those are regarded as highly efficient inorganic compounds for hydrogen storage, are briefly introduced as promising medium."
1,Metal-catalyzed hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions for efficient hydrogen storage,
2,Cyclic hydrocarbons,"2.1 Cyclic hydrocarbons Cyclic hydrocarbons are the simplest candidates as the organic hydrogen carriers through the interconversion between hydrogenated alicyclic compounds and dehydrogenated aromatic compounds [8,13–15]. Cyclohexane-benzene [16–18], methylcyclohexane-toluene [19–27], and decaline-naphthalene [17,28–35] systems have been investigated as representatives due to their abundance in industry, commercial availability, and their relatively low toxicity. More recently, similar systems employing diphenylmethane [36–39], dibenzyltoluene [40,41], and biphenyl [32,38,39] have also been explored. The main advantage of cyclic hydrocarbons as organic hydrogen carrier is that they provide COx free hydrogen. Their high gravimetric capacity of hydrogen (6–8 wt%) is also a fascinating feature. However, the dehydrogenation process is strongly endothermic (64–69 kJ/mol per mol of H2), requiring high temperature, whereas the reversal exothermic hydrogenation step is relatively straightforward [13]. This hampers the study on the dehydrogenation reaction of cyclic hydrocarbons in homogeneous catalysis, in which catalytically active species are generally less stable than in heterogeneous catalysis. The majority of the investigated systems have employed heterogeneous catalysts, which tolerate harsh reaction conditions. In this section, we focus on a few examples of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes catalyzed by homogeneous complex catalysts. 2.1.1 Dehydrogenation process As mentioned above, dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons requires high temperature because of its high endothermicity, which renders heterogeneous solid catalysts having enough thermodynamic durability much more suitable than homogeneous catalysts. In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, there are many publications on the dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons by taking advantage of the stability of metallic catalysts such as Pt, W, Ir, Rh, Re, and Pd [17,28,42,43]. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one example of a homogeneous catalytic system for hydrogen storage utilizing an Ir-pincer complex. Jensen developed the pincer-type complex IrH4{2,6-(CH2P(t-Bu)2)2C6H3} (1), which showed catalytic activity for both dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane and hydrogenation of toluene (Scheme 1 ) [44]. The dehydrogenation reaction proceeds at about 190 °C in a reaction vessel equipped with a tubular membrane that selectively permeates H2 gas. The reverse reaction undergoes in the same vessel under 10 atm pressure of H2 at more than 100 °C. Other studies using cyclic hydrocarbon as hydrogen carrier under homogeneous catalyst should be in progress. 2.1.2 Hydrogenation process The hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons is a relatively well-documented transformation even in the field of homogeneous catalysis, probably due to its natural exothermicity, contrary to the reverse dehydrogenation [45]. Complexes exhibiting good catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons typically contain Co, Ru, Rh, and Ir. In early studies, Muetterties et al. reported the catalytic hydrogenation of benzene, substituted benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and other polyaromatic compounds under mild conditions (25 °C, 1–3 bar H2) by using allyl cobalt trisphosphine complexes [Co(allyl)(PR3)3] (2) (Fig. 1 ), although the turnover number in the hydrogenation of benzene hardly reached 25 [46–51]. Later, efficient catalytic systems employing Ru complexes have been developed. Dyson et al. developed a [Ru(p-cymene)(η 2-TRIPHOS)Cl][PF6] catalyst (3) [TRIPHOS: 1,1,1-tris(diphenylphosphinomethyl)ethane] for the hydrogenation of arenes in ionic liquid [52]. The reaction of benzene with Ru catalyst under H2 (60 atm) at 90 °C afforded cyclohexane in 1 h with a turnover frequency of 476 h−1. Meanwhile, Süss-Fink et al. reported the high catalytic activity of a trinuclear Ru cluster complex 4 toward hydrogenation of benzene and its derivatives with H2 (60 atm) at 90 °C under arene/water biphasic conditions, achieving turnover number of almost 1000 and turnover frequency of 1000–5500 h−1 [53]."
3,N-Heterocyclic compounds,"2.2 N-Heterocyclic compounds The introduction of nitrogen atoms in the skeleton of cyclic hydrocarbons significantly decreases the endothermicity of the dehydrogenation process, which implies that the reaction could be performed under milder conditions than for the sole cyclic hydrocarbons [54,55]. This is very important for the realization of homogeneous catalysis although the possibility of decomposition of the N-heterocyclic compounds arises due to the weaker C–N bond compared with the C–C bond. In most cases, this is not a problem for homogeneous catalysis because of its high reaction selectivity under mild reaction conditions compared with the heterogeneous catalysis. The thermodynamic advantage in the dehydrogenation process for N-heterocycles over sole cyclic hydrocarbons mainly derives from the lower bond dissociation enthalpy of the C–H and N–H bonds; C–H bonds adjacent to the nitrogen substituent are known to be weaker. Pez et al. firstly demonstrated in their series of patents that the incorporation of heteroatoms, especially nitrogen atoms, to π-conjugated substrates was effective for lowering the reaction temperature for hydrogen storage [56,57]. Crabtree and Eisenstein et al. computationally investigated the thermodynamicity of the dehydrogenation of various N-heterocycles, demonstrating their potential as organic hydrogen carriers [58]. The introduction of both nitrogen atom and a substituent in the ring is effective for lowering the reaction temperature for the dehydrogenation process. Since these pioneering works, a number of studies on hydrogen storage utilizing N-heterocyclic compounds in the fields of homogeneous and heterogeneous [59–82] catalysis have been reported. In this section, we mainly focus on the dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles under the homogeneous catalysis, directed toward the application to hydrogen storage systems. 2.2.1 Carbazole, indole, pyrrole Five-membered N-heterocyclic compounds such as pyrroles and their benzene-fused derivatives (carbazoles and indoles) are good candidates as organic hydrogen carriers. In general, the dehydrogenation of five-membered N-heterocycles is thermodynamically more facile than that of the six-membered derivatives, since the cleavage of only four N–H or C–H bonds in the five-membered cycles is required for achieving aromaticity, whereas six σ-bonds should be cleaved in six-membered cycles [58]. Perhydrogenated carbazoles and indoles can be dehydrogenated at lower temperature than pyrroles because their nitrogen atoms can be considered as substituents for the six-membered ring. Jensen et al. reported the dehydrogenation of N-ethylperhydrocarbazole (EPHC) catalyzed by PCP pincer Ir complexes (Table 1 ) [83]. Three pincer Ir complexes 5–7 were examined for the reaction at 200 °C, giving a mixture of partially dehydrogenated products, i.e., N-ethyloctahydrocarbazole (EOHC), N-ethyltetrahydrocarbazole (ETHC), and fully dehydrogenated N-ethylcarbazole (EC). Among the three catalysts, complex 7 showed the highest catalytic activity to fully consume EPHC after 9 h affording 70% of EOHC and 30% of ETHC. These results are in good accordance with the tendency of the catalytic activity of pincer Ir complexes observed in hydrogen transfer processes [84]. Further dehydrogenation proceeded after extended reaction time to form 82% of ETHC and 18% of EC. In this conditions, turnover number [85] reached 436. The reaction temperature could be lowered to 150 °C although the reaction efficiency was remarkably diminished to give 23% of EOHC and 2% of ETHC. These results obviously show that the central five-membered ring undergoes dehydrogenation at the first step. The selective dehydrogenation of perhydrocarbazoles and perhydroindoles at the five-membered ring was later reported by the same group [86]. Jensen et al. also investigated the catalytic dehydrogenation of perhydroindole and N-methylperhydroindole (MePHI) using Ir complex 7 (Table 2 ) [87]. Perhydroindole was quantitatively dehydrogenated into tetrahydroindole after 3 h at 200 °C; however, even after 3 d under heating at the same temperature, no further dehydrogenation was observed. This result obviously implies that the dehydrogenation most likely involves only the carbon-nitrogen bond rather than the carbon-carbon bond. A similar reaction of N-methylperhydroindole at 150 °C mainly led to the partial dehydrogenation product, N-methyltetrahydroindole, with a limited amount of fully dehydrogenated N-methylindole after 216 h. Considering that the reaction performed in the presence of a hydrogen scavenger (tert-butylethylene) afforded a similar result, the degree of dehydrogenation can be expected to be controlled by kinetics. The reaction with hydrogen scavenger at 200 °C afforded 37% of N-methyltetrahydroindole and 62% of N-methylindole, which may be the thermodynamically controlled product distribution. The reactions of 4,4′-bipiperidine and 4-(aminomethyl)piperidine at 200 °C in the presence of Ir catalyst 7 also resulted in H2 generation; however, the residual reaction mixtures were solid probably due to polymerization, which limits the applicability of this system as organic hydrogen carrier. Kinetic studies on the dehydrogenation of a series of pyrrolidine-based N-heterocycles such as EPHC, MePHI, and N-butylpyrrolidine (BuPy) catalyzed by Ir complex 7 were described by Jensen et al. (Table 3 ) [88]. They defined dehydrogenation onset temperature (DOT), “as the temperature at which a minimum of 5% yield of H2 is obtained within a 36 h period” in their publication. The DOT of EPHC, MePHI, and BuPy was 180 °C, 160 °C, and 140 °C, respectively. Moreover, their activation energy was determined to be 115, 142, and 166 kJ/mol and their frequency factor values were found to be 3.56 × 108, 1.05 × 1011, and 2.17 × 1014 s−1, respectively. These results support that in the pincer Ir complex catalysis, steric hindrance of organic hydrogen carrier is more dominant for the reaction rate of the dehydrogenation reaction than the activation energy of the C–H bond. More recently, Wasserscheid, Riisager and co-workers investigated a 2-methylindoline/2-methylindole-based hydrogen storage system in the presence of Crabtree’s catalyst 8 in the molten salt-organic liquid-liquid biphasic reaction system (Scheme 2 ) [89]. Cationic Crabtree’s catalyst was captured in molten ionic phase ([PPh4][NTf2]), while organic hydrogen carrier was in the organic phase (n-Bu2O). The dehydrogenation reaction proceeded smoothly at 130 °C by adding PPh3 as additional ligand for the stabilization of the Ir catalyst. Recyclability was tested twice by washing the ionic phase with n-Bu2O after the reaction, resulting in only a small loss of the catalytic activity. The possibility of performing a consecutive dehydrogenation/hydrogenation process was also examined for hydrogen storage, although complete recharge of hydrogen under 30 bar was not achieved. Although interesting properties have been reported for five-membered N-heterocycles as organic hydrogen carriers, these compounds are still in their early infancy for practical application in hydrogen storage systems. 2.2.2 Pyrazine As mentioned above, the dehydrogenation of six-membered cyclic compounds with one nitrogen atom leading to N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds is typically more endothermic than that of five-membered cycles; however, incorporation of more than one nitrogen atom on the appropriate position can significantly lower the reaction enthalpy [58]. From this viewpoint, pyrazine, a six-membered cyclic compound with two nitrogen atoms at 1- and 4-positions, can be a more suitable candidate as organic hydrogen carrier than pyridine derivatives. Recently, our research group has developed the catalytic interconversion between 2,5-dimethylpiperazine and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine using an Ir complex with functional ligands directed toward its application as hydrogen storage system (Scheme 3 ) [90]. One of the keys for the successful dehydrogenation is the introduction of two methyl groups at 2- and 5-positions, which reduces the reaction enthalpy of the dehydrogenation process. In addition, the methyl groups might provide a moderate steric hindrance that hinders the strong coordination of the nitrogen atoms of 2,5-dimethylpiperazine or 2,5-dimethylpyrazine to the Ir center, which leads to catalyst resting state. The dehydrogenation of 2,5-dimethylpiperazine in the presence of Cp*Ir bipyridonate complex 9 (Cp*: η 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) as a catalyst proceeded quantitatively in both p-xylene reflux and solvent-free reflux conditions (Scheme 3a). In the solvent-free conditions, the amount of catalyst could be lowered to 0.25 mol%, resulting in turnover number of 1188 [85]. The reversal hydrogenation of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine was also catalyzed by the same catalyst 9 in p-xylene/H2O mixed solvent under 15 atm of H2 atmosphere at 110 °C (Scheme 3b). In this case, the use of an additional ligand L1 stabilized the catalyst to afford the parent 2,5-dimethylpiperazine in quantitative yield. To our delight, this mixed solvent system with an additional ligand did not disturb the dehydrogenation of 2,5-dimethylpiperazine at all. Hence, reversible and repetitive interconversion of 2,5-dimethylpiperazine/2,5-dimethylpyrazine with release and uptake of H2 could be achieved for at least four times with almost quantitative efficiency (Table 4 ). Albeit the efficiency of the hydrogenation under solvent-free conditions was lower, a solvent-free consecutive hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process could also be performed (Scheme 4 ). The use of solvent leads to a decrease of the total hydrogen gravimetric capacity of the whole hydrogen storage system; therefore, this can be a promising prototype of hydrogen storage system with high hydrogen capacity (5.3 wt%). 2.2.3 Quinoline and related fused-bicyclic compounds Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds have generally reduced aromaticity compared with their unfused counterparts; thus, the dehydrogenation enthalpy of saturated fused polycyclic compounds decreases in comparison with that of the parent monocyclic derivatives. The quinoline/1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline pair is a good candidate as an organic hydrogen carrier. In 2009, our group reported Ir-catalyzed reversible dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline/quinoline derivatives for hydrogen storage [91]. A screening of substituted 2-pyridonate-ligated Cp*Ir catalysts 10–14 disclosed that 5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridonate complex 12 exhibited the best catalytic performance for the dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline in p-xylene solvent under reflux conditions (Scheme 5 ). The different reactivity of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives having a methyl group on various positions was also examined. 2-Methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline could be quantitatively transformed into 2-methylquinoline after 20 h with the concomitant generation of H2 (Table 5 ). The reverse hydrogenation reaction was also catalyzed by the same catalyst 12 under H2 (1 atm) at 110 °C in p-xylene for 20 h leading to quantitative conversion (Table 6 ). Similar to the dehydrogenation process, 2-methylquinoline was smoothly hydrogenated to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, whereas other quinolines having their methyl group on different positions were less reactive, except 6-methylquinoline. Under high pressure of H2 (3 atm), the reaction could be carried out at 80 °C. Furthermore, the reaction under higher pressure of H2 (10 atm) was completed within 2 h. The reversible and repetitive interconversion of 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline/2-methylquinoline could be performed in the presence of Ir catalyst 12 for at least five cycles without significant loss of conversion efficiency (Table 7 ). As a mechanistic insight, pyridonate complex 12 was converted to hydrido-bridged Ir dimer 15 under H2 (1 atm) with loss of the 2-hydroxypyridine ligand (Scheme 6 a). The hydrido-bridged Ir dimer 15 was also converted to pyridonate complex 12 by a reaction with 2-hydroxypyridine in refluxing p-xylene (Scheme 6b). The dimer 15 could catalyze the hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline under the optimal conditions (Scheme 6c). On the other hand, in semi-stoichiometric conditions, the complex 12 quantitatively converted 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline to 2-methylquinoline while preserving its own structure (Scheme 6d). From these results, it was proposed that the dehydrogenation process is catalyzed by pyridonate complex 12, whereas the hydrogenation process is catalyzed by hydrido-bridged dimer complex 15. Complexes 12 and 15 would be interconverted with each other during the catalytic reaction. In later years, we disclosed that bipyridonate-based Ir complex 9 exhibited higher catalytic activity toward the dehydrogenation of 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline [92]. Furthermore, the bipyridonate complex could also catalyze the perdehydrogenation of 2,6-dimethyldecahydro-1,5-naphthyridine in refluxing p-xylene, releasing 5 equiv of H2 together with the aromatized product 2,6-dimethyl-1,5-naphthyridine (Table 8 ). This bicyclic N-heterocycle-based hydrogen storage system showed higher gravimetric hydrogen capacity (6.0 wt%) than the 2-methylquinoline/2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-based partial dehydrogenation/hydrogenation system (2.7 wt%). Perhydrogenation of 2,6-dimethyl-1,5-naphthyridine was also performed in the presence of the same catalyst 9 under H2 (70 atm) in p-xylene at 130 °C to afford the hydrogenated product as a mixture of diastereoisomers (Table 9 ); however, deactivation of the catalyst was observed due to formation of precipitates after the hydrogenation process. By using Ir catalysts 16 having 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dione with a rigid backbone, quantitative perhydrogenation of 2,6-dimethyl-1,5-naphthyridine was achieved. The reverse perdehydrogenation was also catalyzed by the same Ir catalyst 16 (Scheme 7 ). Its potential application as reversible hydrogen storage system was confirmed by performing successive perhydrogenation and perdehydrogenation of the naphthyridine compound (Scheme 8 ). Similar to Ir complex 12, complex 16b was converted to tetrahydrido-Ir 17 under H2 (70 atm) in toluene at 130 °C (Scheme 9 a). Hydride complex 17 could catalyze the perhydrogenation of 2,6-dimethyl-1,5-naphthyridine in the presence of free 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diol (Scheme 9b). Moreover, the regeneration of complex 16b from 17 to 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diol proceeded in refluxing p-xylene (Scheme 9c). Therefore, the perhydrogenation process would be catalyzed by Ir hydride 17 with the assistance of 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diol, and the perdehydrogenation process would be promoted by complex 16. Jones et al. described the dehydrogenation of N-heterocyclic compounds such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, 2,3-dihydroindole, and piperidine derivatives catalyzed by Fe complexes 18 and 19 having a bis(phosphino)amine (PNP) ligand (Scheme 10 ) [93]. Borohydride-ligated precursor 18 effectively catalyzed the dehydrogenation in refluxing xylene for 30 h. The hydrogenation reactions of the corresponding N-heteroaromatic compounds were smoothly catalyzed by a similar Fe complex 19 by adding KOt-Bu under H2 (5–10 atm) in THF solvent and heating at 80 °C for 24 h (Scheme 11 ). It was proposed that monohydride complex 20 would be formed in situ as the catalytically active species to catalyze both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions. This species 20 was successfully isolated by the reaction of complex 19 with KOt-Bu, and was characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis (Scheme 12 a). Both borohydride complex 18 and monohydride complex 20 were active in the dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline and 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline (Scheme 12b). Interconversion of monohydride complex 20 and dihydride complex 21 in the presence or absence of H2 atmosphere was observed, which supports the involvement of these species in the catalytic dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions (Scheme 12c). Jones et al. also reported the reversible dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of N-heterocyclic compounds catalyzed by Co complex 22 bearing a similar PNP ligand (Scheme 13 ) [94]. The dehydrogenation reaction proceeded in p-xylene at 150 °C. At a difference with the Fe catalytic system, 2,6-dimethylpiperazine did not undergo dehydrogenation. The hydrogenation of N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds was carried out under H2 (10 atm) in THF at 120 °C (Scheme 14 ). 2,6-Dimethylpyridine did not undergo hydrogenation reaction in this system either. Crabtree et al. examined the reversible dehydrogenation of 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and the hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline with Ir catalysts 23 and 24 (Table 10 ) [95]. Prior to this report, they investigated the catalytic activity of cationic Ir–NHC complex 23 (NHC: N-heterocyclic carbene) toward the hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline under very mild reaction conditions (25 °C, 1 atm H2) [96]. The same catalyst could also promote the dehydrogenation of saturated quinoline in refluxing chlorobenzene. The reversibility of the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation process required for its application as hydrogen storage system was demonstrated, although perfect dehydrogenation was not achieved. Recently, the acceptor-less dehydrogenation of organic molecules in water has attracted attention as an environmentally benign transformation method. Albrecht et al. achieved both dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives and hydrogenation of quinoline derivatives in water by using an NHC-based water-soluble Ir catalyst [97]. The dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline proceeded in water at 100 °C in good yield in the presence of Ir complex 25 bearing a C,N-bidentate NHC ligand (Scheme 15 a). A similar C,C-bidentate NHC-ligated Ir complex 26 showed better catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation reaction. The hydrogenation of quinoline in water under H2 (5 bar) was also catalyzed by C,N-bidentate NHC-ligated complex 25 in high yield, whereas C,C-bidentate complex 26 only worked in i-PrOH for the hydrogenation reaction (Scheme 15b). More recently, Fischmeister et al. also developed effective Ir catalyst 27 bearing electron-rich dipyridylamine ligand for both dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives and hydrogenation of parent quinoline derivatives in aqueous conditions (Scheme 16 ) [98]. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoline underwent catalytic dehydrogenation leading to quinoline in 98% yield in refluxing water after 30 h. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoxaline and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline were also converted to corresponding N-heteroaromatic compounds in good yield. The reverse hydrogenation of quinoline also proceeded in aqueous conditions under H2 (1 bar) at 80 °C after 17 h to afford 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline in 98% yield (Scheme 17 ). Hydrogenation of quinoxaline, isoquinoline, and other N-heteroaromatic compounds were also investigated to give the corresponding hydrogenated products good to high yield. A visible light-mediated approach for the dehydrogenation of tetrahydroquinolines was recently reported by Li et al. (Scheme 18 ) [99]. The reaction was carried out in the presence of Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O (28) as (bpy: 2,2′-bipyridine) photoredox catalyst and cobaloxime 29 as H2 generation catalyst. Under the irradiation of blue LEDs, tetrahydroquinoline derivatives underwent dehydrogenation leading to the corresponding quinolines. To demonstrate its potential application as hydrogen storage system, the hydrogenation of quinoline derivatives was also performed in the presence of Hull-Himeda-Fujita’s Ir catalyst 30 [100]. Although this is just a preliminary result because it requires purification prior to the dehydrogenation or hydrogenation reactions, this visible light-mediated approach seems a promising candidate as hydrogen storage system. Apart from homogeneous transition metal complex-based catalysis and heterogeneous supported solid metal catalysis, nanoparticles (NPs)-based catalysis has also attracted growing interest in recent years. Toste and Somorjai developed the synthesis of dendrimer-stabilized NPs supported on SBA-15 which exhibited high catalytic activity toward dehydrogenation of 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and related compounds (Scheme 19 ) [101]. In the presence of 5 mol% of Pd, Rh, or Pt NPs as catalyst at 130 °C in toluene, 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline was quantitatively converted to 2-methylquinoline after 23 h. Even 1 mol% of Pt NPs could promote the reaction quantitatively to afford H2 with turnover number of 200. The reverse hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline under H2 (1 atm) also proceeded quantitatively in the presence of 2.5 mol% of Pt and Pd NPs at 60 °C in toluene after 24 h of reaction. The reversible and consecutive dehydrogenation/hydrogenation process for hydrogen storage was also achieved. Cai et al. reported the reversible dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tethrahydroquinoline catalyzed by Pd–Ni bimetallic NPs encapsulated in MIL-100(Fe) [102]. Both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions could be performed in water. The dehydrogenation proceeded at 130 °C, whereas the reversal hydrogenation proceeded at 60 °C under H2 (4 atm). The catalyst could be easily reused by filtration from the reaction mixture followed by washing with ethanol and water. At least five cycles were completed with only a small loss of catalytic activity. Very recently, Beller et al. developed a Ni silicide catalyst supported on fumed silica with catalytic activity toward the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline. The dehydrogenation required a temperature as high as 200 °C in triglyme [103]. On the other hand, the hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline proceeded at 120 °C under H2 (30 atm). Even under these relatively harsh reaction conditions, the catalytic system was reusable for at least three cycles of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation without significant loss of catalytic activity. Another approach for the development of a catalyst for hydrogen storage was reported by Wang and Li et al. They adopted single atom catalysts (SACs) for the acceptor-less dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, demonstrating isolated Co single atom sites on porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (ISAS-Co/OPNC) as the catalytically active species [104]. The catalyst demonstrated good dehydrogenation activity in mesitylene at 120 °C for 8 h. Although the hydrogenation activity was unexplored, SACs might be promising candidates as effective catalytic systems. 2.2.4 Phenazine Incorporation of a nitrogen atom onto the cyclic hydrocarbon skeleton or substituent on the ring is a very effective strategy for decreasing the reaction enthalpy of the dehydrogenation process; however, such modification may potentially induce a loss of gravimetric hydrogen capacity. To pursue the development of an efficient hydrogen storage system, exploration of novel candidates as organic hydrogen carriers with high theoretical gravimetric hydrogen capacity is strongly demanded. Kempe et al. developed a novel hydrogen storage system utilizing perhydrophenazine as an organic hydrogen carrier catalyzed by a Pd–Ru nanocomposite supported on silicon carbonitride (Pd2Ru@SiCN) (Scheme 20 ) [105]. The theoretical hydrogen capacity of perhydrophenazine was as high as 7.2 wt%, which is equal to that of the cyclohexane/benzene system. Octahydrophenazine could be synthesized from the reaction of ammonia with 1,2-cyclohexanediol obtained from hydrogenolysis of lignin, hence, phenazine could potentially satisfy the requirements of sustainable chemistry. The dehydrogenation of perhydrophenazine was promoted by Pd2Ru@SiCN catalyst in diglyme at 190 °C for 24 h to afford phenazine in high yield accompanying H2 evolution, with turnover number of 1883. The hydrogenation could be performed in the presence of the same catalyst at 115 °C under H2 (50 bar) in 1,4-dioxane/water. The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycle could be repeated seven times. Despite the relatively harsh reaction conditions, the perhydrophenazine/phenazine system is promising for hydrogen storage with high hydrogen capacity."
4,Cyclic and non-cyclic amide and urea,"2.3 Cyclic and non-cyclic amide and urea Compared to cyclic hydrocarbons and their nitrogen-containing derivatives, alcoholic substrates can more readily undergo dehydrogenation from the viewpoint of reaction enthalpy, leading to carbonyl compounds. Hemiacetal or hemiaminal can also be dehydrogenated to ester or amide. Although the reverse hydrogenation reactions of amides to parent alcohols and amines are slightly challenging, this amide-based transformation can be promising for hydrogen storage in the presence of a suitable dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalyst. Recently, Milstein et al. reported this new concept of organic hydrogen carrier based on dehydrogenative amide formation from aminoalcohol (Scheme 21 ) [106]. They applied Ru-PNN pincer catalysts 31 and 32, which were effective for both dehydrogenative coupling reactions of alcohols with amines and the reverse hydrogenative fragmentation reactions, for hydrogen storage using 2-aminoethanol. The dehydrogenative reaction of 2-aminoethanol can afford piperazine-2,5-dione (glycine anhydride, GA) or linear oligopeptide (LP). The formation of GA is more beneficial than that of LP from the standpoint of hydrogen storage capacity (6.6 wt% and 5.5 wt% for GA and hexapeptide, respectively). The reaction in the presence of Ru catalyst 31 and KOt-Bu (1.2 equiv relative to the catalyst) without any solvent at 135 °C proceeded with 48% conversion to give a trace amount of GA (Table 11 ). The use of 1,4-dioxane as a solvent was essential for the formation of GA. On the other hand, Ru catalyst 32 exhibited better catalytic activity in the presence of 2.4 equiv of KOt-Bu (relative to catalyst), resulting in 85% conversion to form 60% of GA and 77% yield of H2 generation with its turnover number [85] of 616. The reverse hydrogenation of GA was also smoothly catalyzed by Ru catalyst 32 to give 2-aminoethanol quantitatively under H2 (50 atm) at 110 °C (Scheme 22 ). A mixture of GA and LP obtained by dehydrogenation of 2-aminoethanol could also be hydrogenated to 2-aminoethanol in 85% yield. Repetitive dehydrogenation/hydrogenation cycles could be carried out for three times, which demonstrated the potential of this system for application in hydrogen storage (Table 12 ). Later, the same group described another hydrogen storage system based on the dehydrogenative coupling of ethylenediamine with ethanol leading to N,N-diacetylethylenediamine (DAE) (Scheme 23 a) [107]. In this reaction, Ru catalyst 33 having bipyridine-based ligand scaffold showed high catalytic activity in 1,4-dioxane solvent at 135 °C to give DAE in 92% yield together with H2 in 95% yield and turnover number of 1900 (Scheme 23b). The reverse hydrogenation reaction was also promoted by the same catalyst (Scheme 23c). Repetitive dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions were possible for three cycles without significant loss of the catalytic activity. Milstein et al. also reported a cyclic imide-based hydrogen storage system using 1,4-butanediol and ethylenediamine (Scheme 24 a) [108]. In the presence of Ru catalyst 34 and 2 equiv of KOt-Bu (relative to the catalyst), the coupling reaction of 1,4-butanediol with ethylenediamine at 120 °C afforded a mixture of cyclic bis-imide, linear oligoamide, and lactone together with H2 evolution (Scheme 24b). The reverse hydrogenation of the cyclic bis-imide was also catalyzed by Ru catalyst 32 under H2 (40 bar) to afford the parent 1,4-butanediol and ethylenediamine with a yield higher than 90% (Scheme 24c). Repetition of the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation was also tested by hydrogenating the cyclic bis-imide with catalyst 32, followed by dehydrogenation with catalyst 34. Two cycles of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation were possible with moderate efficiency of imide formation. Olah and Prakash et al. investigated a formamide-based hydrogen storage system employing the coupling reaction of N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine with methanol in the presence of a Ru-MACHO type catalyst (Scheme 25 ) [109]. Methanol is advantageous for this type of hydrogen storage system due to its high hydrogen gravimetric capacity. The reaction of N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine with 4 equiv of methanol in toluene solvent at 120 °C was catalyzed by Ru complex 35 to afford a mixture of a diformylated product and a monoformylated product with 90% yield of H2, based on the stoichiometry of full conversion to the diformylated product. The reverse hydrogenation of the reaction mixture obtained from dehydrogenation was performed under H2 (40 bar) at 120 °C with the addition of K3PO4 in toluene, resulting in 92% recovery of N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine. Very recently, Milstein et al. developed a similar hydrogen storage system based on dehydrogenative ethylene urea formation from ethylenediamine and methanol in the presence of Ru catalyst (Scheme 26 a) [110]. Due to the low reactivity of urea toward hydrogenation, ethylene urea has been a challenging substrate for hydrogen storage applications. Ru catalyst 32 could catalyze the hydrogenation of ethylene urea at relatively high temperature (170 °C) under H2 (60 bar) to afford ethylenediamine quantitatively after 7 d with 79% yield of methanol (Scheme 26b). The reaction time could be shortened to 1.5 d by using Ru catalyst 33. The dehydrogenative coupling of ethylenediamine with methanol proceeded in 48 h in the presence of Ru catalyst 32, leading to a mixture of formamide, diformamide, and ethylene urea, whereas catalyst 33 showed no catalytic activity in this process (Scheme 26c). A consecutive dehydrogenation/hydrogenation process in the presence of catalyst 32 could be performed without any additional catalyst in the second hydrogenation step, albeit further dehydrogenation after the second hydrogenation failed probably due to catalyst decomposition (Scheme 26d)."
5,Formic acid,"2.4 Formic acid Before attention was turned to organic hydrogen carriers for hydrogen storage, formic acid was well known as hydrogen source or reductant in decarboxylation reactions. Its availability, relatively low toxicity, good hydrogen capacity (4.4 wt%), and low risk of explosion or other hazardous accidents render it as an attractive candidate for organic hydrogen carrier. During the H2 releasing process, an equimolar amount of CO2 is also generated, hence pure H2 gas cannot be obtained; however, for the use of fuel cells, the presence of CO2 does not represent a problem. Recently, separation method to obtain high pressure H2 from H2/CO2 mixed gas generated via decomposition of formic acid was developed, providing 85% purity of H2 after gas-liquid separation process, which renders the formic acid more promising hydrogen carrier [111]. In case of the charge of hydrogen, formic acid is superior to other candidates as organic hydrogen carrier in terms of transfer cost because CO2 can be collected from atmosphere. For these reasons, studies on hydrogen storage systems using formic acid in the presence of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are intensively ongoing [112–116]. In this section, studies on the homogeneously catalytic interconversion between formic acid and CO2:H2 gases are mainly featured. The structures of the catalysts described in this section are summarized in Fig. 2 . The catalytic systems are summarized in Table 13 . In 2000, Puddephatt et al. reported the catalytic activity of binuclear Ru complex [Ru2(μ-CO)(CO)4(μ-dppm)2] (36) [dppm: bis(diphenylphosphino)methane] in the interconversion of formic acid and H2/CO2 [117]. The dehydrogenation of 13C-labeled formic acid was promoted by complex 36 in acetone-d 6 at rt. The turnover frequency was ca. 500 h−1. The reverse hydrogenation of CO2 under equimolar conditions was also catalyzed by the same complex in the presence of excess amount of Et3N in acetone solvent. Under 1020 psi, the turnover number reached 2160 after the reaction for 21 h. From the NMR studies conducted on Ru species observed during the dehydrogenation process, a possible mechanism was proposed (Scheme 27 ), in which an in situ formed dihydride species reacts with formic acid to release H2, followed by β-H elimination or hydride abstraction from the intermediate of transient dissociation of formate. Finally, dissociation of CO2 completes the catalytic cycle. The reverse hydrogenation process is expected to obey the reverse mechanism. Lau et al. described the synthesis of heterobimetallic Ru–Mo complex 37 and Ru–W complex 38 and their catalytic property in the interconversion between formic acid and H2/CO2 [118]. The decomposition of formic acid in the presence of 10 mol% of catalyst was monitored by NMR spectroscopy, revealing that the reaction was complete within 6–40 h at 80 °C. The reverse hydrogenation reaction under H2 (30 atm) and CO2 (30 atm) at 120 °C for 45 h afforded a small amount of formic acid with a turnover number of up to 43. A mechanistic study disclosed the involvement of a bridged hydride intermediate in the catalytic cycle. A highly active catalyst for the reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO2/formic acid was developed by Nozaki et al. [119,120]. PNP pincer-type Ir(III)-trihydride catalyst 39 promoted the hydrogenation of CO2 in a mixture of 1 M KOH aqueous solution and THF at 120 °C, leading to a turnover number of 470,000 and a yield of formate of 94% based on the added base. The turnover number was further increased to 3,500,000 by reducing the loading amount of catalyst. In the reverse dehydrogenation of formic acid, addition of Et3N was beneficial to achieve a high turnover number (5,000) at 80 °C in t-BuOH as a solvent containing a small amount of THF. Beller et al. reported a hydrogen storage method utilizing the formate/bicarbonate interconversion catalyzed by a Ru-dppm complex [121]. Bicarbonate can be considered as an equivalent to CO2 in basic aqueous solution, hence it can be used as an alternative of the CO2-based hydrogen storage system. Hydrogenation of NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) in a H2O/THF mixed solution under H2 (80 bar) was achieved in the presence of a catalytic amount of [RuCl2(benzene)]2 and dppm ligand (Ru:dppm = 1:4), affording 96% yield of sodium formate with a turnover number of 1108. The reverse dehydrogenation process of sodium formate was also catalyzed by the Ru catalyst (Ru:dppm = 1:6) at 60 °C in DMF/H2O solution, resulting in a turnover number of 2000 with 2592 h−1 of initial turnover frequency to give H2 and a small amount of CO2 (8.3%). Dehydrogenation at lower temperature reduced the evolution of CO2 gas (0.8%), albeit the turnover number and the turnover frequency were decreased. Consecutive dehydrogenation from sodium formate to NaHCO3 and hydrogenation was possible, although isolation of NaHCO3 was required. The order of this sequence could be reversed by starting from NaHCO3. Later, the same group improved the efficiency of the catalysis reaching a turnover number of up to 800,000 [122]. At almost the same time and independently, Papp and Joó et al. reported a similar rechargeable hydrogen storage system using a Ru catalyst with a water-soluble phosphine-based ligand [123]. Himeda et al. reported the high catalytic performance of Ir complexes 40,41 with 4,4′-dihydroxy-2,2′-bipyridine (DHBP) as ligand in the interconversion between formic acid and H2/CO2 [124,125]. A key concept of the design of catalyst is the strong electron donating ability of the deprotonated DHBP ligand under basic conditions. A good correlation between Hammett σ values and the initial turnover frequency was observed for various 4,4′-disubstituted-2,2′-bipyridine-coordinated Ir, Rh, and Ru complexes. Among these three metal complexes, the Ir derivative exhibited the best catalytic activity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Later, the group of Hull, Himeda, and Fujita developed a reversible hydrogen storage system using pH-switchable Ir catalysts 30 and 42 [100]. The hydrogenation reaction is accelerated under basic conditions, whereas acidic conditions favor the reverse dehydrogenation. Hence, pH-responsive catalysts effective for both reactions may realize this concept for reversible hydrogen storage. Dinuclear Ir catalyst 42 showed efficient catalytic ability in the hydrogenation of CO2 in 1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution (pH 8.4) under H2/CO2 (1:1) atmosphere (3–5 MPa) at 50 °C–80 °C, reaching a maximum turnover number of 153,000. The catalytic dehydrogenation of formic acid was also smoothly promoted by a dinuclear Ir catalyst formed via partial protonation of the parent catalyst 42 at 60 °C–90 °C in acidic conditions (pH 3.5), achieving a turnover number as high as 308,000. By using this catalytic system, a consecutive reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation system was demonstrated for two cycles. The group of Onishi, Fujita, and Himeda took advantage of strong electron donating ability of picolinamide ligand for the design of highly active catalyst for both hydrogenation of CO2 and dehydrogenation of formic acid [126,127]. The amidate moiety of the catalysts 43 are beneficial not only for increase of electron density at Ir center but also for proton-responsive function to accelerate H–H bond cleavage and formation. Ir catalyst 43 having picolinamide with 4-hydroxyl group on the pyridine ring achieved high initial turnover frequency as 2660 h−1 after 1 h on hydrogenation of CO2 at 50 °C in aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (1.0 M) under H2/CO2 (1:1) (1.0 MPa) [126]. The catalyst worked well even under ambient conditions (0.1 MPa of H2/CO2 (1:1), 25 °C) to achieve initial turnover frequency of 167 h−1 after 1 h and turnover number of 14,700 after 328 h. For the reversal process, dehydrogenation of formic acid in 8 M formic acid/sodium formate solution at 60 °C was smoothly catalyzed by Ir catalyst 44 bearing N-phenylpicolinamide ligand, achieving initial turnover frequency of 118,000 h−1 after 10 min [127]. Reaction at 50 °C enabled stable gas production, reaching turnover number of 1,000,000 with turnover frequency higher than 35,000 h−1 over the first 6 h. More recently, Himeda et al. reported the newly developed imidazoline-based Ir catalyst 45, which was more effective for hydrogenation of CO2 under ambient conditions than catalyst 42 [128]. Catalyst 45 also worked well for the catalytic dehydrogenation of formic acid at 60 °C, resulting in a turnover number of 40,000 after 2.5 h with 23,000 h−1 of initial turnover frequency. Himeda et al. developed pyridyl-pyrazolyl-chelated Ir catalyst 46 with hydroxyl group on the 3-position of pyrazole moiety, which contributes to an enhancement of electron donating ability of the ligand under basic conditions [129]. The catalyst promoted hydrogenation of CO2 at 50 °C in aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (1.0 M) under H2/CO2 (1:1) (1.0 MPa), achieving initial turnover frequency of 650 h−1 after 1 h and total turnover number of 7850 after 48 h. The same catalyst also exhibited high catalytic performance toward dehydrogenation of formic acid with extremely high durability, reaching total turnover number of 10, 000, 000 after 35 days with the continuous addition of formic acid by a pump. The catalytic activity of an Ir complex was also investigated by other groups. Fukuzumi et al. reported phenylpyrazolyl-based Ir complex 47 for the catalytic interconversion between formic acid and H2/CO2 [130]. This complex has a carboxyl moiety that reacts with a base giving carboxylate species. In slightly basic conditions under an atmospheric pressure of 1:1 of H2:CO2, the catalyst changed to carboxylate form, which exhibited good catalytic activity toward the hydrogenation of bicarbonate anion (CO2 equivalent in basic aqueous solution) to formate anion with 6.8 h−1 (at rt) or 22 h−1 (at 60 °C) of turnover frequency. On the other hand, in acidic conditions (pH 2.8), the carboxylic acid form of the catalyst smoothly promoted the dehydrogenation of formic acid to CO2 at rt with turnover frequency of 1880 h−1. Grotjahn, Webster, and Papish et al. reported a comparison of bidentate NHC-hydroxypyridine-based Ir complexes 48 with 6,6′-dihydroxybipyridine (dhbp) complexes 49 for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 in aqueous phase and dehydrogenation of formic acid [131]. The catalytic hydrogenation under H2/CO2 (1:1) (300 psi) at 115 °C in 1 M NaHCO3 was promoted smoothly by Ir-dhbp catalyst 49, achieving a turnover number of 2400 after 18 h at 115 °C. The NHC complex showed lower catalytic activity. For the dehydrogenation of formic acid, Ir-dhbp complex 49 was much superior to the NHC complex, resulting in >3500 vs 140 of turnover number after 3 h at 60 °C. Another type of Ir–NHC-based catalyst was synthesized and evaluated for the interconversion of CO2/formic acid by Choudhury et al. [132]. This benzimidazole-abnormal NHC-based Ir complex 50 exhibited good catalytic activity in the hydrogenation at an atmospheric pressure of CO2:H2 in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution at 30 °C for 1 h, leading to of turnover frequency of 58 h−1. The dehydrogenation of 1 M formic acid/sodium formate aqueous solution (pH 4.4) was smoothly promoted by the same catalyst at 90 °C, achieving a turnover frequency of 100,000 h−1. The strong σ-donating abnormal NHC moiety and the amido-type N–Ir bonding mode may be responsible for the high catalytic activity. Manzano and Espino et al. reported 8-aminoquinoline-based Rh and Ir complexes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of formic acid and dehydrogenation of CO2 [133]. Rh complex 51 and Ir complex 52 exhibited high catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of a formic acid/sodium formate mixture (1:2) in water at 100 °C, reaching turnover number of 1560 and 2826 after 1 h, respectively. The hydrogenation of CO2 in 0.1 M KOH solution under H2/CO2 (5 bar/5 bar) at 80 °C was also efficiently catalyzed by the same complexes, resulting in turnover number of 5991 (for Rh) and 6021 (for Ir) after 8 h. In the case of the Ir catalyst, the temperature could be lowered to 40 °C while maintaining a turnover number of 5662. Pidko et al. developed a highly efficient Ru-PNP pincer catalyst 53 for the reversible hydrogenation of CO2 [134]. To prevent catalyst deactivation, the dehydrogenation of formic acid was performed in DMF solvent. The reaction at 90 °C in the presence of Ru catalyst 53 and NEt3 as a base proceeded with high efficiency, resulting in high turnover frequency (257,000 h−1) and turnover number (326,500). For the reverse hydrogenation of CO2, the use of DBU as a base instead of NEt3 was important to achieve a high turnover frequency (1,100,000 h−1) at 120 °C under pressurized H2/CO2 (30 bar/10 bar). A consecutive reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation sequence in DMF/DBU conditions was demonstrated as a promising model for hydrogen storage. The H2 uptake process was performed at 65 °C under 40 bar and 5 bar (H2: CO2 = 1:1), and the releasing process was performed at 90 °C, without significant catalyst degradation after ten cycles. Plietker et al. reported Ru-PNNP tetradentate ligand complex 54 for catalytic hydrogen storage reactions [135]. In this catalytic system, CO2 was handled as solid (dry ice), and was hydrogenated to DBU formate in 84% yield under H2 (70 bar) in the presence of the Ru catalyst and DBU as a base, reaching a turnover number of 5600 after 4 h at 100 °C. The dehydrogenation of DBU formate was performed in the presence of the same catalyst at 100 °C in toluene. It was demonstrated that five cycles of charge and discharge of H2 and CO2 were possible without loss of efficiency. For the consecutive reversible hydrogen storage, the above described reaction systems require pH switch, solvent change, or addition of reagent prior to the change of H2 uptake and release. To realize a more practical system, hydrogen storage controlled by using only pressurized H2 gas and heating is more desired. Czaun, Prakash, and Olah reported a Ru-PNP pincer catalyst for amine-free reversible hydrogen storage in formate salts without pH control or solvent change [136]. Ru catalyst 55 smoothly promoted the hydrogenation of CO2 using H2/CO2 (61 bar/20 bar) at 70 °C in the presence of NaOH in 1,4-dioxane/H2O mixed solvent, achieving turnover number of 10,775 with turnover frequency of 1096 h−1 after 590 min. The same complex catalyzed the dehydrogenation of sodium formate in the same solvent at 68 °C to afford H2 quantitatively after 240 min with a turnover number of 1000. Since both directions have similar reaction conditions, consecutive CO2 hydrogenation and formate dehydrogenation cycles could be performed just by changing the pressure conditions (heating to 70 °C under 75 bar of a 3:1 mixture of H2 and CO2 for H2 charge, and heating to 70 °C under atmospheric pressure for H2 discharge). No significant loss of catalytic activity was observed during six cycles of H2 charge/discharge. Not only noble metal catalysts such as Ir and Ru but also base metal catalyst has been investigated as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts. Gonsalvi et al. reported the syntheses of Fe-tetradentate phosphine complexes 56 and their catalytic performance toward the dehydrogenation of formic acid and hydrogenation of NaHCO3 [137]. The Fe complex exhibited good catalytic activity for the hydrogenation reaction of NaHCO3 in methanol solvent at 80 °C under H2 (60 bar), resulting in turnover number of 766 and 71% yield of sodium formate. The dehydrogenation of formic acid at 60 °C in propylene carbonate as a solvent proceeded in the presence of an in situ formed Fe complex (Fe:ligand = 1:4) to achieve turnover number of 6061 after 6 h. Enthaler and Junge et al. described the evaluation of the catalytic activity of Ni-PCP pincer complex 57 for the hydrogenation of NaHCO3 and dehydrogenation of a formic acid/amine mixture [138]. H2 production from a formic acid/octyldimethylamine mixture at 60 °C in diglyme solvent was promoted by Ni catalyst with a turnover number of 83 after 3 h. This complex exhibited better catalytic activity toward hydrogenation of NaHCO3 in methanol at 150 °C for 20 h under H2 (55 bar), resulting in turnover number of 3038."
6,Miscellaneous,"2.5 Miscellaneous H2 generation from other novel dehydrogenation reactions of small molecules has also been studied. Although most of these reaction systems may be a little far from application to practical hydrogen storage, they include some interesting points worth noting for future breakthroughs compared to the above described systems from the perspective of reversibility and reaction efficiency. 2.5.1 Primary amine The primary amine/nitrile pair can be envisaged as a hydrogen carrier [139]. The CH2NH2 moiety provides 2 equiv of H2, thus containing 13.3 wt% of hydrogen theoretically. The maximum hydrogen capacity can be available by utilizing acetonitrile; however, the corresponding hydrogenated compound ethylamine is highly volatile, which renders this system difficult to handle. Amine/nitrile pairs having sufficiently high boiling point are suitable candidates as hydrogen carriers, in spite of the decrease in the hydrogen storage capacity. Hydrogenation of nitrile is a relatively well known reaction that is utilized in industrial applications such as the hydrogenation of adiponitrile. Recently, efficient catalytic systems for hydrogenation of nitriles under mild reaction conditions was developed by some groups [140–142]; however, the reverse dehydrogenation reaction of amine to nitrile, which is key for the construction of a hydrogen storage system, is still challenging. Szymczak et al. discovered catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of primary amines leading to both aliphatic and aromatic nitrile in the presence of Ru-NNN pincer type catalyst 58 (Scheme 28 ) [143]. 1-Octylamine underwent dehydrogenation catalyzed by 1 mol% of Ru complex 58 in toluene at 110 °C to afford 75% yield of octanenitrile. Phenethylamine and benzylamine were also converted to the corresponding nitriles in good yields. This report is remarkable for the exploration of the amine/nitrile pair as reversible hydrogen storage system. Mata et al. reported Ru-catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions of primary amine to nitriles directed toward their potential application as hydrogen storage systems (Scheme 29 ) [144]. NHC-based Ru-p-cymene complex 59 promoted the dehydrogenation of benzyl amine to nitrile, which was obtained along with imine as byproduct, in refluxing toluene for 8 h. By using pyrene-tethered NHC-ligated Ru complex 60 immobilized onto the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), recycling of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation of benzylamine could be performed for ten times. Although the consecutive dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of the amine/nitrile pair was not investigated, this report will be helpful for future application to hydrogen storage. 2.5.2 Methanol Alcohols can be oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with the release of H2, which enables alcohol-based hydrogen storage system. Especially, methanol as the simplest alcohol is the most promising candidate for the organic hydrogen carrier. In aqueous conditions, methanol undergoes three steps of dehydrogenation reaction, including the first dehydrogenation leading to formaldehyde followed by hydration giving methanediol, the second dehydrogenation of methanediol affording formic acid, and the last dehydrogenation furnishing CO2 (Scheme 30 ). Hence, 3 equiv of H2 can be released from the pair of methanol and water. Although the methanol-based reversible dehydrogenation/hydrogenation system under homogeneous catalysis has never been reported, it is quite beneficial to feature the catalytic system of dehydrogenation of aqueous methanol leading to CO2 + 3H2 and reversal hydrogenation of CO2, for the future development of genuine hydrogen storage system. Here, several examples of either direction of conversion between methanol and CO2 under mild conditions in the presence of homogeneous catalysts are briefly summarized. In this section, turnover number for dehydrogenation process is based on the ratio of generated H2 to catalyst loading. For more detailed information of the studies on methanol-based hydrogen storage, please refer the recent well-organized reviews [145,146]. 2.5.2.1 Methanol dehydrogenation to CO2 Since early studies in 1980’s, Ru complexes were known to exhibit catalytic activity to the dehydrogenation of methanol in water-free conditions. Maitlis et al. reported dehydrogenation of methanol in the presence of RuCl2(PPh)3 as a catalyst at 150 °C, leading to formation of methyl formate with the release of H2 gas with turnover number of 65 after 18 h [147]. Saito et al. also reported the same reaction at 66 °C catalyzed by Ru(OAc)Cl(PEtPh2)3 together with the addition of 2 equiv of acetic acid with regard to the Ru catalyst, achieving turnover number of 34 after 90 h [148]. Cole-Hamilton et al. employed light irradiation for the dehydrogenation of methanol and related alcoholic compounds with the combination of RuH2(N2)(PPh3)3 catalyst under NaOH-basic conditions at 150 °C, reaching turnover frequency of 37.3 h−1 and turnover number of 74 after 2 h in methanol dehydrogenation [149]. In 1990, Shinoda and Yamakawa reported Ru–Sn cluster complex Ru(SnCl3)5PPh3 exhibited catalytic activity in dehydrogenation of methanol in methanol/nitromethane (1:1) solution with turnover number of 15.7 after 100 h at 65 °C [150]. Regarding dehydrogenation of methanol in water-containing conditions, Cole-Hamilton investigated the dehydrogenation of 5% v/v of water-containing methanol in the presence of NaOH under [Rh(2-2′-bipyridyl)2]Cl catalysis at 120 °C [151]. Although the rate of H2 production was low as 7 h−1 and the turnover number was 21 after 3 h, a possibility for methanol dehydrogenation in aqueous phase was significantly demonstrated. Complete dehydrogenation of methanol combined with water was first reported by Beller’s group [152] and Trincado and Grützmacher’s group [153], independently in 2013. Beller et al. developed aqueous-phase methanol dehydrogenation system catalyzed by PNP-pincer Ru complex under basic conditions [152]. Reaction of 4:1 v/v mixture of methanol/water containing 0.5 M of NaOH at 72 °C in the presence of Ru catalyst 61 and 62 afforded H2 gas with turnover frequency of 120 and 45 h−1, respectively (Scheme 31 ). In the basic conditions, pure H2 gas was obtained due to the trap of co-produced CO2 as carbonate. Employment of highly basic conditions (8.0 M KOH) in neat methanol led the highest turnover frequency of 4720 h−1 at 95 °C for Ru catalyst 62. The maximum turnover number of 350,000 was achieved in the reaction conditions using 9:1 v/v ratio of methanol/water with 8.0 M KOH and 1.0 ppm of catalyst 62 after 23 days. The Beller’s group also reported the similar dehydrogenation system utilizing PNP-pincer Fe complex catalyst in the same year [154]. The hydrogen generation from 9:1 ratio of methanol/water mixture with 8.0 M KOH in the presence of Fe catalyst 18 at 91 °C proceeded with turnover number of 9834 after 46 h (Scheme 32 ). Recently, the same group applied Mn catalysis to this methanol dehydrogenation system under 8.0 M KOH basic conditions [155]. In the presence of 10 equiv of free PNP-pincer ligand referenced to Mn catalyst 63 at 92 °C, turnover number of 20,000 was achieved after 1 month (Scheme 32). Trincado and Grützmacher et al. reported that tetradentate bis-olefin diazadiene ligated Ru complex 64 exhibited catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of the mixture of methanol and water (Scheme 33 ) [152]. The reaction of methanol-water-THF mixture in the presence of Ru catalyst 64 (0.5 mol%) at 90 °C under base-free conditions achieved ∼80% conversion after 10 h, which corresponded to turnover number of 475. Stoichiometric reaction of Ru complex 64 revealed that diazadiene moiety of the ligand could incorporate four hydrogen atoms on its nitrogen and carbon atoms, which was a key for the catalytic activity. After the pioneering works by the two groups, the exploration of effective catalytic system for dehydrogenation of aqueous methanol have been intensively investigated. In 2014, Milstein et al. reported dehydrogenation of methanol with 2 equiv of KOH in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of toluene/water catalyzed by Ru complex 33 (Scheme 34 ) [156]. The reaction at 100–105 °C (115 °C of oil bath temperature) for 9 days afforded 77% yield of H2, achieving turnover number of 9288 and average turnover frequency of 43 h−1. It is noteworthy that the recovered organic layer after the dehydrogenation reaction for 9 days could be reused for the same dehydrogenation conditions without any addition of catalyst and toluene, giving 82% yield of H2 after 9 days. The further reuse resulted in the generation of 80% yield of H2 after 9 days. With respect to the durability, Ru catalyst 33 maintained catalytic activity for nearly 1 month, achieving maximum turnover number as ∼29,000. Beller et al. developed a bicatalytic system for base-free dehydrogenation of methanol (Scheme 35 ) [157]. Combination of two Ru catalyst 65 and Ru(dppe)2H2 (dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) enabled dehydrogenation of 9:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and water with triglyme solvent at 93.5 °C, reaching turnover frequency of 93 h−1 with turnover number of 651 after 7 h. Turnover number up to 4200 was achieved in a long-term experiment after 10 days. Notably, under the base-free conditions, gas evolution from bicatalytic system was significantly greater than that of the sum of gas generation of individual catalysis worked separately. This synergistic effect was also observed in basic conditions using two Ru catalysts 62 and 66 [158]. Our group reported hydrogen production from refluxing methanol/water (1:4) solution at 88 °C in the presence of catalytic amount of anionic Ir complex 67 bearing functional bipyridonate ligand, which worked well under weakly basic conditions (Scheme 36 ) [159]. Ir catalyst 67 exhibited the best catalytic performance when 1 equiv of NaOH referenced to the Ir complex was used, affording 84% yield of H2 with turnover number of 504 after 20 h. Through this reaction, the pH value of the solution was changed from 11.1 to 8.2, which allowed maintaining of catalytically active anionic structure of Ir complex during the catalytic process. Long-term H2 generation experiment from methanol/water (1:4 M ratio) solution with continuous addition of methanol/water (1:1 M ratio) solution containing 0.2 mol% of NaOH achieved 64% yield of H2 with turnover number of 10,510 after 150 h. Highly active Fe catalyst 68 for dehydrogenation of methanol/water (4:1 M ratio) in refluxing ethyl acetate (bp 77 °C) solvent was reported by Bernskoetter, Hazari, and Holthausen et al. (Scheme 37 ) [160]. With a combination of LiBF4 as Lewis acid catalyst, turnover number of 30,000 with >99% yield of H2 was achieved after 52 h. The turnover number was further increased to 51,000 after 94 h by reducing the catalytic amount, although the yield of H2 was decreased to 50%. Other catalytic systems for dehydrogenation of methanol were also reported, in which Ru, Ir or Fe complexes were employed [161–164]. Exploration of highly active catalyst under genuine milder reaction conditions (low temperature, nearly neutral pH, and no-use of organic solvent) will be demanded for future works. 2.5.2.2 CO2 hydrogenation to methanol With regard to hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol [165], a reaction under mild conditions (below 200 °C) has never been reported until recently. The early study on catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reported by Sasaki et al. in 1993 required high temperature (240 °C) and high pressure of 1:3 CO2/H2 mixture (80 atm) in the presence of [Ru3(CO)12] [166]. In 2011, Sanford et al. reported cascade catalytic system for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, which consisted of the 1st [RuCl(OAc)(PMe3)4] (69)-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid, the 2nd esterification of the in situ formed formic acid in the presence of Sc(OTf)3 catalyst leading to methyl formate in methanol solution, and the last PNN-pincer Ru complex 70-catalyzed hydrogenation of methyl formate to methanol to complete the overall hydrogenation of CO2 (Scheme 38 ) [167]. Combination of the 1st and 2nd step achieved methyl formate formation from CO2/H2 (1:3, 40 bar) in methanol solvent at 135 °C with turnover number of 40; however, cascade of the three individual reactions resulted in low turnover number of 2.5 for methanol formation due to incompatibility of PNN-pincer Ru complex 70 and Sc(OTf)3. Separation of 1st+2nd steps (inner vessel) from the last step (outer vessel) enabled improvement of turnover number to 21. Very recently, this cascade catalytic system consisting of three individual catalysts was improved by the group of Goldberg, utilizing tetradentate phosphine-Ru complex 71, Sc(OTf)3, and PCP-pincer Ir complex 72 with the combination of ethanol to achieve higher turnover number of 428 (Scheme 39 ) [168]. In 2012, Klankermayer and Leitner et al. reported the first hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol under relatively mild conditions catalyzed by single Ru complex (Scheme 40 ) [169]. Combination of [Ru(η 3-TRIPHOS)(TMM)] (TMM = trimethylenemethane) (73) and HNTf2 promoted the hydrogenation reaction of CO2/H2 (1:3, 80 bar) in the presence of ethanol at 140 °C in THF, reaching turnover number of 221 after 24 h. Ethanol was added in order to stabilized the formate intermediate as ester which underwent hydrogenation leading to methanol. Addition of HNTf2 was quite important to achieve high catalytic activity. In later years, the same group reported mechanistic study of the hydrogenation of CO2 using Ru(triphos) complex [170]. Addition of HNTf2 under catalytic conditions was effective for formation of cationic formate complex as a catalytically active species. As a result of the mechanistic study, alcoholic additive was turned out to be not essential for the hydrogenation system. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the turnover number was increased to 442 at 140 °C in THF under CO2/H2 (1:3, 80 bar). In 2015, Sanford et al. reported tandem catalytic system for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol utilizing a combination of dimethylamine and Ru-PNN pincer complex 65 [171]. In this reaction system, it was proposed that formation of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylammonium formate (DMFA) proceeds prior to formation of methanol (Scheme 41 ). Formation of DMF from CO2 and dimethylamine proceeds via two possible pathways. One pathway is the hydrogenation of dimethylammonium dimethylaminocarbamate (DMC), which is formed via reversible condensation of CO2 with dimethylamine. The other is hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid (FA) followed by dehydrative condensation with dimethylamine. DMFA is generated via reversible salt formation between FA and dimethylamine. During the optimization study for hydrogenation of DMC, formation of DMF and DMFA was turned out to proceed smoothly at 95 °C, whereas the following hydrogenation leading to methanol required much higher temperature as 155 °C, at which decomposition of Ru catalyst should be problematic. Hence, temperature control was quite important for achieving high turnover number for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Reaction of CO2 (2.5 bar) with H2 (50 bar) in the presence of catalytic amount of Ru complex 65 and K3PO4 together with dimethylamine in THF was performed at 95 °C for 18 h, then the temperature was elevated to 155 °C for 36 h, affording methanol with turnover number of 550 and DMF + DMFA with turnover number of 1870 (Scheme 42 ). Similar amine-mediated strategy for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol was demonstrated by other research groups. Ding et al. reported PNP-pincer Ru complex 61-catalyzed N-formylation of morpholine and related aliphatic amines under CO2/H2 (1:1, 70 atm) [172]. As an application, sequential N-formylation of morpholine followed by hydrogenation under H2 (50 atm) in one-pot was performed, resulting in 36% yield of methanol with 63% yield of N-formylated morpholine untouched. Milstein et al. reported hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol by combination of PNN-pincer Ru catalyst 33 with 2-(methylamino)ethanol as CO2 capturing agent (Scheme 43 ) [173]. It is notable that CO2 was captured by aminoethanol as oxazolidinone form in the presence of Cs2CO3 catalyst under low pressure (3 bar). The oxazolidinone underwent Ru-catalyzed hydrogenation under H2 (60 bar). Consecutive CO2 capture/hydrogenation sequence could be performed in DMSO solvent without requirement of isolation of intermediate oxazolidione. Use of valinol as CO2 capturing agent enabled low pressure (1 bar) CO2 uptake at 150 °C followed by hydrogenation under H2 (60 bar) at 135 °C for 72 h in the presence of Ru catalyst 33 (2.5 mol%), resulting in 53% yield of methanol with 74% yield of valinol (Scheme 44 ). It is worth noting that the Milstein’s group reported Ru- or Mn-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2-derived organic compounds such as carbonates, carbamates, urea, and formates leading to methanol [174–176]. Ding et al. [177] and Cavallo, El-Sepelgy, and Rueping et al. [178] also reported hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate leading to methanol under Ru and Mn catalysis. Olah and Prakash et al. employed a polyamine for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol catalyzed by PNP-pincer Ru complex (Scheme 45 ) [179]. In the presence of pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) at 155 °C in THF solvent, reaction of CO2/H2 (1:3, 75 bar) was catalyzed by Ru complex 65 to afford methanol with turnover number of 1060 after 40 h. Higher turnover number of 1200 was achieved in the reaction conditions using CO2/H2 (1:9, 75 bar) in triglyme solvent at 145 °C after 200 h. Recyclability was tested by distilling methanol and water off after end of each cycles. After 5 cycles, the catalyst retained 75% of the initial activity, reaching total turnover number of 2150. CO2 capture from air using 3.4 mmol of PEHA was investigated, resulting in 5.4 mmol of CO2 capture which was converted to 4.3 mmol of methanol. More recently, the same group achieved much higher turnover number of 9900 after 244 h by fine-tuning of the optimized reaction conditions using very low catalyst loading (11 ppm) [180]. Furthermore, the same group reported the similar reaction system using amine immobilization for the improvement of recyclability [181]. Highly active catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol was developed by the group of Wass by employing Ru catalyst 74 bearing two P,N-bidentate ligands (Scheme 46 ) [182]. Reaction of CO2/H2 (1:3, 40 bar) in toluene with i-Pr2NH and NaOEt at 100 °C for 2 h afforded methanol with turnover number of 8900 and turnover frequency of 4500 h−1. Bulky amine was proposed to be effective for acceleration of hydrogenation of formamide, resulting in complete consumption of amide intermediate. Studies on hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol catalyzed by other than Ru complex were reported by a few groups. Beller et al. reported Co catalysis for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol [183]. Combination of Co(acac)3, triphos, and HNTf2 enabled hydrogenation reaction under CO2/H2 (2:7, 90 bar) at 100 °C in THF/EtOH giving methanol with turnover number of 50. Very recently, the turnover number was increased up to 125 by employing tuned triphos-based ligand [184]. Prakash et al. reported PNP-pincer Mn complex 63-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol mediated by amine additive [185]. 1st N-formylation of morpholine proceeded under CO2/H2 (1:1, 60 bar) in the presence of Mn catalyst in THF at 110 °C in 95% yield. One-pot N-formylation/hydrogenation sequence leading to methanol resulted in turnover number of 36. Martins et al. reported hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol in the presence of pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) solvent and Fe-scorpionate complex catalyst 75 [186]. Reaction under CO2/H2 (1:3, 75 atm) was promoted by Fe catalyst in PEHA at 80 °C to afford methanol in turnover number of 2387 (Scheme 47 ). Although solvent amount of PEHA was required, the relatively high turnover number is remarkable. Bernskoetter et al. reported PNP-pincer Fe complex 20-catalyzed sequential N-formylation of morpholine with CO2/H2 followed by hydrogenation affording methanol [187]. Consecutive N-formlyation performed under CO2/H2 (1:4.6, 1400 psi) at 100 °C in THF and hydrogenation of the formamide under H2 (1150 psi) at 100 °C in THF afforded methanol with turnover number of 590 (Scheme 48 ). 2.5.3 Other alcohols Other than methanol/CO2 pairs, alcohol/ketone interconversion can be applied as hydrogen storage system. Although the hydrogen capacity of the alcohol/ketone pair is not higher than that of systems based on C1-compounds (methanol, formic acid, and CO2), there is significant advantages on the use of specific materials having other functions not available for C1-based systems. In this context, Nishide et al. developed a hydrogen storage polymer material based on interconversion of a fluorenol/fluorenone moiety (Scheme 49 ) [188]. The polymer was synthesized by the copolymerization of fluorenone- or fluorenol-bridged diamine with tri(bromomethyl)benzene. It was obtained as a bendable sheet, which showed color change accompanying the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation. The charge of hydrogen was performed electrolytically in water. On the other hand, the H2 release was promoted in the presence of a catalytic amount of Ir 6,6′-dihydroxybipyridine complex in water at 80 °C. Although the theoretical hydrogen capacity of fluorenol is as low as 1.1 wt%, this report is interesting in terms of hydrogen fixation to the solid polymer-based material. Primary alcohol/ester interconversion along with dehydrogenation can also be applied to hydrogen storage system. Especially, readily available and renewable ethylene glycol would be good candidate for hydrogen carrier. Dehydrogenative esterification leading to liquid oligoesters can be utilized for hydrogen storage system, by combining reversal hydrogenation process. Maximum theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of ethylene glycol reaches 6.5 wt% (for infinite polyester formation) (Scheme 50 ). Recently, Milstein et al. reported Ru-catalyzed reversible dehydrogenation/hydrogenation system of ethylene glycol [189]. Dehydrogenation of ethylene glycol in toluene:1,2-dimethoxyethane 1:1 mixed solvent at 150 °C in the presence of Ru catalyst 76 (1 mol%) proceeded in 97% conversion of the diol after 72 h, affording 64% yield of H2 referenced to the maximum hydrogen storage capacity (Scheme 51 ). The reaction mixture of dehydrogenation process could be recovered to the parent ethylene glycol via hydrogenation under H2 (40 bar) at 150 °C for 48 h, giving 92% yield of ethylene glycol. Solvent-free dehydrogenation process was also performed for increasing the hydrogen storage capacity of the whole system. Under reduced pressure (95 mbar), the dehydrogenation reaction of ethylene glycol in neat conditions at 150 °C was catalyzed by Ru catalyst 76 (0.5 mol%), achieving 75% yield of H2, which corresponds to turnover number of 300 [85], estimated by 1H NMR study of the crude reaction mixture after 168 h. Vacuum conditions was effective for removing the generated H2 gas from the reaction mixture and moving the dehydrogenation reaction forward. Regeneration of ethylene glycol from the reaction mixture obtained under neat conditions was carried out by adding toluene/1,2-dimethoxyethane solvent, yielding 96% of ethylene glycol at 150 °C after 60 h. 2.5.4 Silane with alcohol Hydrosilane has a negatively polarized hydrogen atom that can react with protic reagents such as alcohols, affording molecular hydrogen and silyl ether. This process is thermodynamically favored due to the formation of strong Si–O bonds, thus, H2 generation from silane and alcohol can proceed in mild reaction conditions in the presence of an appropriate catalyst. Although the regeneration of hydrosilane from silyl ether requires a strong reductant such as LiAlH4, the easy handling and low toxicity of silane-based compounds render them good organic hydrogen carriers. García and Mata et al. reported a Ru catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols with a release of H2 (Scheme 52 a) [190]. Pyrene-tethered Ru catalyst 77 rapidly promoted the coupling reaction at 30 °C within 10 min. The reaction was still fast even at 0 °C to give the coupling product in almost quantitative yield. The same group reported a similar Ir catalysis in the coupling reaction of 1,4-disilabutane with methanol affording 6 equiv of H2 (Scheme 52b) [191]. This reaction corresponds to 4.3 wt% of gravimetric hydrogen capacity, reaching turnover number of 1200. The reaction in the presence of pyrene-tethered Ir catalyst 78 completed within 12 min at 30 °C. The recyclability of the rGO-immobilized Ru catalyst 77 and Ir catalyst 78 in the reaction of phenyldimethylsilane with methanol was investigated, finding that the catalytic activity was maintained after ten times of use (Scheme 52c). 2.5.5 Oxygen heterocycle Compared with nitrogen-containing cyclic hydrocarbons, reports on the dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons bearing oxygen as heteroatom are still scarce. The dehydrogenation of perhydrodibenzofuran was investigated by Jensen et al. using an Ir-PCP pincer catalytic system [87]. The reactivity toward dehydrogenation was much lower than that of the nitrogen analogue; only 15% yield of octahydrodibenzofuran was obtained after 24 h at 200 °C. By adding a hydrogen scavenger (tert-butylethylene), a mixture of octahydrodibenzofuran (60%), tetrahydrodibenzofuran (32%), and dibenzofuran (8%) was obtained. Recently, our group reported the interconversion between γ-butyrolactone and 1,4-butanediol with release and uptake of H2 in the presence of an Ir catalyst [192]. Since 1,4-butanediol is easily available from biomass fermentation, it can be promising hydrogen carrier. The dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol was quantitatively promoted in the presence of Ir catalyst 9 in refluxing 1,2-dimethoxyethane to afford γ-butyrolactone with the release of 2 equiv of H2 (Table 14 ). The turnover number for H2 generation reached 2000 (Table 14, entry 1). This reaction could be performed under solvent-free conditions giving H2 and γ-butyrolactone in almost quantitative yields at 150 °C for 5 h (99% of H2 and 98% of lactone) or at 140 °C for 9 h (96% of H2 and lactone), respectively. The reverse hydrogenation of γ-butyrolactone proceeded also without requiring any solvent in the presence of Ir catalyst 9 under H2 (8 atm) at 130 °C (Table 15 ). Interestingly, catalyst decomposition could be circumvented by adding 6,6′-dihydroxy-2,2′-bipyridine (L1) as an extra ligand, thereby improving the yield of diol. Further addition of amine to avoid tetrahydrofuran formation, which proceeds under acidic conditions, could increase the yield of diol up to 99%. The successive hydrogenation of γ-butyrolactone and dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol was demonstrated for the application as hydrogen storage system (Scheme 53 ). 2.5.6 Ammonia-borane The ammonia-borane has attracted much attention as a material for hydrogen storage for a long time [193–196]. The strong interaction between boron and nitrogen atoms is a powerful driving force for the H2 releasing reaction. Noteworthily, a high gravimetric capacity of hydrogen (19.6 wt%) is also fascinating. H2 generation can occur via two types of reactions, i.e., hydrolysis and dehydrogenation. Hydrolysis of ammonia-borane with 4 equiv of H2O affords 2 equiv of H2 together with NH4B(OH)4 as a spent fuel. In this case, the theoretical gravimetric capacity of hydrogen is reduced to 5.8 wt%. Furthermore, regeneration of ammonia-borane from ammonium borate is typically difficult because it requires a strongly reducing agent, which renders the reversible hydrogen storage system based on the hydrolysis of ammonia-borane unpractical [193,197]. On the other hand, the mere dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane forms boron nitride as a spent fuel. This process can take full advantage of the theoretical gravimetric capacity of hydrogen. Although the regeneration of ammonia-borane from boron-nitride is still difficult, the catalytic anhydrous dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane is promising for hydrogen storage. In this section, we focus on the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane in the presence of a catalytic amount of transition metal complexes. The structures of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The catalytic systems are summarized in Table 16 . Heinekey and Goldberg et al. reported the high catalytic ability of Ir-PCP pincer complex toward dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [198]. The reaction proceeded in the presence of 0.5 mol% of Ir catalyst 7 at ambient temperature in THF, affording 1 equiv of H2 within 14 min. The byproduct was confirmed to be [H2NBH2]n, which was in good accordance with the amount of H2 evolved. Baker et al. reported that Ni–NHC catalyst 79 (Ni-Ender’s NHC catalyst) produced more than 1 equiv of H2 and aminoborane in the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [199]. The dehydrogenative reaction in diglyme/benzene solvent completed within 4 h at 60 °C in the presence of 10 mol% of Ni–NHC catalyst, generating 2.5 equiv of H2 per ammonia-borane. More recently, Guino-o et al. investigated the steric effect of the ligand on the Ni–NHC-catalyzed dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane using triazolylidene ligands [200]. Fagnou et al. reported the catalytic dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane and methylamine-borane using N,P-chelated Ru complex [201]. The dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane in THF proceeded smoothly in the presence of 0.03 mol% of Ru catalyst 80 within 5 min at rt to afford 1 equiv of H2. Furthermore, the reaction of methylamine-borane using 0.5 mol% of 80 afforded 2 equiv of H2 within 10 min at rt. By using a 1:1 mixture of ammonia-borane/methylamine-borane under solvent-free conditions, 3.6 wt% of hydrogen was released using 0.1 mol% of Ru catalyst 80 at 50 °C. Schneider et al. reported Ru-PNP pincer type catalyst 81 for dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [202]. Slightly more than 1 equiv of H2 was generated by the reaction of ammonia-borane in THF at rt with 0.01 mol% of Ru catalyst 81 within 10 min. Michalak and Kang et al. reported the Pd-catalyzed dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane derivatives [203]. [Pd(allyl)][BF4] (3.0 mol%) (82) exhibited high catalytic activity giving 2 equiv of H2 in 20 s at rt. Meanwhile, [Pd(MeCN)4][BF4]2 (3.0 mol%) (83) also showed good catalytic activity to complete the reaction within 60 s. A series of ammonia-borane derivatives were subjected to these catalytic dehydrogenation conditions. Methylamine-borane and ethylamine-borane were very reactive toward the dehydrogenation reaction affording 2 equiv of H2 in 10 s, whereas the less reactive diethylamine-borane produced 1.5 equiv of H2 after 1500 s. A monosubstituted borane-ammonia complex released only 1 equiv of H2. The catalytic ability of Shvo’s catalyst 84 toward the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane was investigated by Williams et al. [204]. 5 mol% of Shvo’s catalyst promoted the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane in diglyme/benzene at 70 °C in the presence of 2.0 mol% of ethanol, affording 1 equiv of H2 in 30 min and 2 equiv in 120 min. Williams et al. described the catalytic dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane in the presence of Ru-dipyridylmethylhydroxyborate complex 85 [205]. The reaction in diglyme at 70 °C under air using 2.0 mol% of Ru catalyst 85 afforded 2.0 equiv of H2 in 4 h and a total of 2.2 equiv upon completion of the reaction (turnover number = 110), which corresponded to the release of 4.2 wt% of hydrogen. Four consecutive runs in a single reactor were possible, producing 2.2, 2.1, 2.3, and 2.2 equiv of H2, respectively. Three successive runs with reduced amount of catalyst (0.1 mol%) resulted in a turnover number of 5700. Baker and Gordon et al. investigated the catalytic dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane in the presence of a series of amido-Fe complexes 86–89 [206]. Depending on the Fe complexes (5 mol%), 1–1.7 equiv of H2 was generated in THF or diglyme solvent at rt or 60 °C (1.5–1.7 equiv for 86, ∼1.2 equiv for 87, 1 equiv for 88, and 1.3–1.5 equiv for 89, respectively). Manners et al. reported the photo-induced dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane in the presence of [CpFe(CO)2]2 (90) [207]. The reaction at 20 °C in the presence of 5 mol% of Fe complex for 3 h under the irradiation with a Hg lamp afforded 65% of aminoborane trimer and 35% of borazine. Morris et al. reported the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane using Fe-PNNP tetradentate precatalyst 91 [208]. Up to 1.8 equiv of H2 was generated in the presence of 2.5 mol% of Fe complex and 40 mol% of t-BuOK in THF at 22 °C for 1 h. A mechanistic study suggested that the true catalytically active species is not a homogeneous complex but nanoparticles composed of zerovalent Fe, which is formed in situ and stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. García-Vivó et al. reported the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane and its derivatives in the presence of group 6 Cp complexes 92–94 having metal-metal bonds in THF at 60 °C, albeit the efficiency (turnover frequency) was as low as <1 h−1 [209]. Guan et al. developed an efficient Fe catalyst 95 having PCP-pincer ligand for the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [210]. The reaction of ammonia borane in THF/diglyme mixed solvent at 60 °C in the presence of Fe catalyst 95 (5 mol%) proceeded to afford 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 equiv of H2 in 1.5, 7, and 16 h, respectively. Agapie et al. reported Mo(0) complex 96 for the catalytic dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [211]. 5 mol% of catalyst 96 at 70 °C in diglyme solvent exhibited high performance to produce 2 and 2.5 equiv of H2 within 6.5 and 15 h, respectively. Meanwhile, Mo(II) complex 97 efficiently catalyzed the dehydrogenation to release 2 equiv of H2 in 8.5 h, with a larger initial rate than catalyst 96. Williams et al. reported a highly efficient Ru-phenanthroline-based catalyst 98 for the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [212]. The released amount of H2 reached 2.7 equiv in 10 h at 70 °C in diglyme solvent using 1 mol% of Ru catalyst. Key to increase the H2 releasing extent is the dehydrogenation of borazine, which is a major byproduct of ammonia-borane dehydrogenation. By subjecting isolated borazine to the catalytic conditions of dehydrogenation, ca. 70% of borazine was converted to polyborazylene after 24 h. Esteruelas et al. reported the catalytic activity of Rh(I) monohydride 99 toward ammonia-borane dehydrogenation [213]. The extent of H2 release per ammonia-borane reached up to 1 equiv at 31 °C in THF solvent in the presence of 1 mol% of Rh catalyst in 8 min. Gudat et al. reported the synthesis of Mn–N-heterocyclic phosphenium complex 100 and its catalytic ability toward the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [214]. The reaction at 50 °C in THF/toluene solvent catalyzed by 2.5 mol% of Mn catalyst proceeded to generate >1.7 equiv of H2 in 30 h. Giambastiani, Rossin, Belkova, and Shubina et al. reported Ir–PCN pincer type complex 101 for the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane and its derivatives [215]. The dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane in THF at rt in the presence of 3.5 mol% of Ir catalyst afforded 1 equiv of H2 in 1 h. The dehydrogenation of dimethylamine-borane under the same reaction conditions was faster, reaching completion within 0.5 h. Tobita et al. reported a highly efficient Fe-amino complex 102 for dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [216]. In the presence of an equimolar amount of KN(SiMe3)2 with respect to the catalyst 102 (2 mol%) could promote the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane within 100 s, generating 0.93 equiv of H2 with an initial turnover frequency of 9.3 × 103 h−1. After the report by Peters et al. on catalytic ability of Co complex toward hydrogen transfer reactions including dehydrogenation of dimethylamine-borane [217], some reports on Co catalysis for the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane emerged. Thus, Waterman et al. described Cp* or Cp Co catalysts 103 and 104 for this reaction [218]. The reaction in the presence of 0.1 mol% of Co catalyst 103 in THF at 65 °C afforded 1.91 equiv of H2 in 4 h along with a mixture of borazine and polyborazylene. Both Cp* and Cp complexes showed similar catalytic activities. Rossin and Shubina et al. reported Co complexes 105 and 106 with κ 4-NP3 or κ 4-PP3-tetradentate ligands for the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane [219]. κ 4-NP3-Co complex 105 exhibited better catalytic ability (33 mol%) to give 2 equiv of H2 in the reaction at 55 °C in THF solvent after 24 h, whereas in the case of κ 4-PP3-Co complex 106, only 1 equiv of H2 was generated. The hemilabile nitrogen atom in 105 would effectively promote the second dehydrogenation step. Wangelin and Wolf et al. reported diimine-cobaltate complex 107 for the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane and its derivatives [220]. The reaction of ammonia-borane at 25 °C in THF with 5 mol% of Co catalyst 107 afforded more than 1 equiv of H2 after 24 h. 2.5.7 Related B–N compounds Some of designed amino-borane compounds have been investigated for the future application to hydrogen storage. Compared with the parent ammonia-borane, their gravimetric capacity of hydrogen is significantly lower. Nevertheless, they present some advantages over the ammonia-borane, such as easiness of regeneration of the dehydrogenated form, and easy handling due to the good solubility in organic solvents or the liquidity at rt. Dixon and Liu et al. designed a BN-heterocyclic compound for hydrogen storage (Scheme 54 a) [221]. Compound BN1 can release 3 equiv of H2 together with dehydrogenated waste BN2 (spent fuel). If the reverse hydrogenation is possible, this type of compound can serve as useful hydrogen carrier. To demonstrate this proof of concept, model spent fuel compound BN3 was synthesized. The hydrogenation of BN3 was performed under H2 (45 psi) in the presence of 25 mol% of Pd/C in benzene at 80 °C, resulting in almost quantitative formation of the doubly hydrogenated product BN4 as confirmed by GC (Scheme 54b). In a following report, Liu et al. described that the synthesis of 1,2-BN cyclohexane BN1 and examined its reactivity toward dehydrogenation reaction [222]. BN cyclohexane BN1 underwent thermal dehydrogenation at 150 °C in toluene to afford trimerized product BN5 in quantitative yield (Scheme 55 ). In this trimerization process, 4.7 wt% of hydrogen was released. A hypothetical dehydrogenation of the C–H moiety would provide a theoretical hydrogen capacity of 9.4 wt% of hydrogen. The same group also investigated a similar five-membered amine-borane compound BN6 as hydrogen storage material [223,224]. This compound underwent thermal dehydrogenation at 150 °C in 1 h leading to the trimerized product in quantitative yield (Scheme 56 ). It is worth noting that both starting material and dehydrogenated product are liquid at 20 °C, which reinforces their availability in neat conditions that retains the theoretical gravimetric hydrogen capacity (4.7 wt%). The dehydrogenation process was performed under milder conditions by adding FeCl2 (5 mol%) in neat conditions. The reaction at 80 °C completed within 25 min. Regeneration to the parent cyclic amine-borane BN6 from spent fuel BN7 was possible by methanolysis followed by reduction with LiAlH4 (Scheme 57 ). Although the regeneration process requires a strong reducing agent, this compound can be used as a reversible hydrogen storage system."
7,Conclusion,"Hydrogen is widely considered an ideal energy source from the viewpoint of sustainability. However, as hydrogen is a gas under ambient conditions and needs to be handled with care, the development of safe and efficient hydrogen storage methods is indispensable for realizing advanced hydrogen technologies. For this reason, hydrogen storage systems that use organic compounds as a medium have garnered attention. In such systems, hydrogen is incorporated into organic molecules through the formation of covalent bonds, allowing hydrogen to be stored and transported in a liquid or solid state that is safe and easy to handle. Furthermore, the use of organic hydrogen carrier for hydrogen storage is economically advantageous, as existing infrastructure for handling liquid and solid fuel resources as well as well-established methodologies for the storage and transportation of such materials can be employed. As discussed in this paper, the most important aspect of hydrogen storage systems based on organic hydrogen carrier is the development of a catalyst system that can reversibly achieve highly efficient reactions that store hydrogen by hydrogenating the medium and extract hydrogen through dehydrogenation. Furthermore, it is essential that the medium has a high gravimetric capacity of hydrogen. We hope that the research findings summarized here will lead to the development of a new practical hydrogen storage system based on organic hydrogen carrier."
