0,Introduction,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a main component of Co(Ni)MoS2/Al2O3 industrial hydrotreating (HDT) catalysts. The active phases of HDT catalysts contain nanoscopic slabs of MoS2 decorated at the edges with Co or Ni [1]. Unsupported sulfides are widely studied as well for the novel generation of highly active HDT catalysts [2,3] or as dispersed catalysts for upgrading heavy residuals [4]. Beyond HDT, MoS2 shows interesting performance for alcohol synthesis [5,6], carbon oxide hydrogenation [7,8], and water gas shift [9]. In recent years, MoS2 has also attracted much attention as a promising material for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [10,11] or as a component of photocatalysts aimed at water splitting, where it is used as a hydrogen production co-catalyst [12,13]. In all these applications, hydrogen activation and/or associative desorption is involved. Hydrogen adsorption on MoS2 edges has fundamental importance for the understanding of the whole catalytic act. Indeed, for any hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction to occur, adsorption of an S-containing molecule and dissociative adsorption of H2 are necessary. Similarly, for HER process, recombination of adsorbed H species is necessary. Determining the state of adsorbed hydrogen in MoS2-based catalysts would improve control of the surface species involved in the elementary steps. Despite the importance of the topic, there are relatively few experimental studies of the adsorption of hydrogen on MoS2. Topsoe et al., using infrared spectroscopy, provided the first indirect evidence of the presence of –SH groups in the supported catalysts [14]. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the few straightforward methods of spectroscopic observation of H species. Bulk MoS2 prepared by decomposition of (NH4)2MoS4 in 10% H2S/H2 at 400 °C was studied by Jones et al. in the range of pressures 1–50 bar [15]. Only S–H bending at 82 meV (660 cm−1) was observed besides lattice vibrations and molecular hydrogen. Bulk and supported MoS2 has been studied by INS Wright et al. [16,17] for MoS2 samples prepared by reduction of MoS3 in flowing hydrogen at 400 °C. Vibration was observed at 650–670 cm−1 and it has been concluded that hydrogen is bonded to one or more sulfur atoms rather than to metal atoms. Later, H2 sorption at pressures from 1 to 30 bar was studied by INS by Sundberg et al. [18] and Mitchell et al. [19]. Pure, Ni-promoted, and alumina-supported MoS2 treated at 673 K in 10% H2S/H2 (and resulfided at 573 K) were studied in [19]. Again, on bulk MoS2, a bending S–H vibration at 650–670 cm−1 has been observed. The stretching frequency appeared at 2500 cm−l. To maximize the amount of adsorbed H2, MoS2 was treated in hydrogen at 1200 K in Ref. [20], which in fact leads to a drastic drop in H2 uptake [20]. In previous studies, no structural attribution had been provided relating the observed species to the existing models of MoS2 slabs, which predict the existence of structurally distinct slab edges, the so-called S-edge and M-edge [21]. The influence of treatment conditions and/or that of the presence of a second metal on H2 adsorption by unsupported MoS2 was never accessed by INS. Many theoretical works have been published on H2 activation by MoS2. Some earlier works dealt with heavily reduced MoS2, assuming heterolytic dissociation to Mo–H on sulfur vacancies and adjacent S–H species [22]. On the other hand, Byskov et al. suggested that homolytic activation is favored for CoMoS catalysts, leading to formation of –SH groups on the S-edge [23,24]. Cristol et al. carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations for H2 adsorption on [100] MoS2 surfaces for various edge stoichiometries. A thermodynamic diagram was built, relating the edge stoichiometry to the nature of adsorbed hydrogen atoms, as a function of the total pressure and of the P H2S/P H2 ratio. The S−H groups were identified as the stable adsorption form of hydrogen [25]. Travert et al. studied activation of hydrogen on MoS2 edges and found that migration of adsorbed hydrogen from a Mo atom to a S atom is almost athermic, leaving the possibility of existence of both Mo–H and –SH stable species [26]. Sun et al. concluded that on the unpromoted MoS2 and on the Co-promoted S-edge, H2 adsorption generates stable surface –SH groups. Addition of Co was predicted to increase the amount of adsorbed H2, whereas promotion with Ni was predicted to decrease it [27,28]. Lauritsen et al., combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of single-layer MoS2 nanoclusters with DFT, concluded that on the hexagonal MoS2 flakes, S-edges contain adsorbed S–H groups [29]. Dinter et al. studied 100% S-covered M-edges and found that the rate-determining step for the onset of reduction is dissociative chemisorption of H2 on two adjacent S2 dimers on the M-edges [30]. Later, Prodhomme et al. calculated S–H vibration frequencies for partially sulfur-covered M- and S-edges and found values close to the experimental values of 2500 cm−1 for stretching and 650 cm−1 for bending on both M- and S-edges [31]. Each of these theoretical works is supported by a subset of INS and other experimental data, but no coherent picture emerges of the nature and amount of stable adsorbed hydrogen species as a function of treatment conditions and the presence of promotor. Thus adsorption is concluded to be predominant on the S-edge in [30], whereas no clear preference was given to the M- or S- edge in [32]. This work reports an INS study of a series of samples differing by MoS2 reduction and/or the presence of a second metal. We inquire how these parameters influence the amount and the nature of stable adsorbed hydrogen species. DFT calculations of the vibration frequencies have been carried out to explain the experimental results."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation All chemicals were high-purity products purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium thiomonomolybdate (NH4)2MoS4 was obtained by adding 15 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O to 200 mL of a 20 wt% solution of (NH4)2S at ambient temperature. The precipitated red crystals were thoroughly washed with small amounts of ethanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF), dried, and stored under nitrogen. Decomposition of ATM was carried out in Pyrex or quartz reactors. A weighed amount of ATM was placed in a reactor and treated in a gas flow of 10 L/h of pure H2 or pure H2S. The temperature was raised at a rate of 5°min−1 to a desired value and maintained for 2 h. Promoted catalysts were prepared according to Ref. [32]. In brief, a weighed amount of Ni(II) or Co(II) acetylacetonate was dissolved in a minimum amount of methanol while being flushed by nitrogen. Then MoS2 powder was added to the solution at an atomic ratio of Co(Ni)/Mo = 0.4 and the suspension was heated for 4 h at the boiling temperature of methanol (65 °C) without air admission. Then the mixtures were cooled to room temperature and kept overnight under nitrogen. Afterward, the solids were recovered by filtration and dried under N2 at room temperature. The catalysts were tested after resulfidation with H2/H2S at 350 °C for 1 h. Platinum-containing material was prepared by impregnation of MoS2 (prepared in H2 at 400 °C) with aqueous tetraammineplatinum (II) nitrate solution, followed by resulfidation in 15% vol. H2S/H2 for 2 h and then by treatment in hydrogen flow at 400 °C for another 2 h. To carry out hydrogen adsorption, for all preparations under study, the samples were cooled to room temperature under the same gas atmosphere as was used for activation (H2S, H2, or their mixture), and then the gas flow was changed to a pure H2 flow at 10 L/h and maintained for 2 h. Then, to remove physically adsorbed hydrogen-containing species, the sample was flushed in 10 L/h nitrogen flow for 1 h at room temperature. It was then placed in a sealed stainless steel container for inelastic neutron scattering, without delay."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JEOL 2010 device with an accelerating voltage of 200 keV. The samples were dispersed in n-hexane by ultrasound and then put onto a holey carbon filament on a copper grid sample holder. The analysis of images was carried out using Digital Micrograph Gatan software. Nitrogen adsorption was carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument and calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation. Prior to measurements, the samples were heated for 4 h in a secondary vacuum at 300 °C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker diffractometer with CuKα emission, and crystalline phases were identified using standard JCPDS files. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out in a quartz reactor. The samples of sulfides (ca. 0.01 g) were linearly heated under a hydrogen flow (50 cm3 min−1) from room temperature to 1050 °C (heating rate 5°min−1). Hydrogen sulfide and other gases evolved upon reduction were detected by a Thermo Fischer quadrupole mass spectrometer. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) in argon flow was carried out in the same setup as used for TPR, but the sample mass was increased to 0.2 g to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The amounts of H2S and H2 released from the solids were quantified after calibration of the MS with gas mixtures of known H2S and H2 content, containing respectively 500 ppm H2S and 1 vol% H2 in Ar. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a VG ESCALAB 200R device using AlKα radiation. The binding energies (BE) were referred to the energy of the C1s peak (285.0 eV). Quantification of the surface content was done using the sensitivity factors provided with the VG software. Metal content was analyzed after dissolution in a HNO3/H2SO4 mixture by plasma-coupled atomic emission spectroscopy (AES-ICP). Analysis of light elements (CHNSO) was carried out on a Thermo Fisher Flash 2000 device."
4,Inelastic neutron scattering,"2.3 Inelastic neutron scattering Weighed amounts of about 8 g of each material were prepared and transferred to stainless steel containers for INS measurements under inert atmosphere. INS experiments were performed on the IN1BeF spectrometer at the Institut Laue–Langevin, Grenoble, France. The INS spectra were measured from 240 to 2800 cm−1. A beryllium filter was placed between the sample and the detector. This setting gives an instrumental resolution varying from 25 cm−1 at small energy transfers to 50 cm−1 at large energy transfers. The frequency values were corrected from a systematic shift due to the beryllium filter. The estimated resolution is ~20 cm−1. The spectra were recorded at 5 K to decrease the mean squared amplitude of the atoms and thus to sharpen the vibrational features."
5,Thiophene hydrodesulfurization test,"2.4 Thiophene hydrodesulfurization test Catalytic activity in the thiophene HDS reaction was measured at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow microreactor. Reaction was carried out in the temperature range 300–340 °C under 50 mL/min gas flow, using 50–100 mg of catalyst and a partial pressure of thiophene of 2.7 kPa. The plug-flow reactor model was used to calculate the specific reaction rate, V s, according to the equation V s = −(F/m)ln(1 − x), where F is the thiophene molar flow (mol/s), m is the catalyst mass (g), and x is thiophene conversion. Catalytic activity was estimated at steady state conversion after at least 16 h on stream. Arrhenius plots were built using five temperature points between 300 and 340 °C. A high correlation coefficient (better than 0.995) and physically reasonable activation energy between 17 and 22 kcal/mol were used as criteria of successful activity measurement in the kinetic regime. In all experiments, thiophene conversion was below 10%, making it possible to use a pseudo-first-order kinetics equation. For each catalyst, at least two HDS tests have been carried out."
6,Density functional theory calculations,"2.5 Density functional theory calculations Small MoS2 clusters were simulated using ORCA code [33]. Triangular clusters were used, providing the maximal edge length vs. the total number of atoms. In the DFT calculations, generalized gradient PBE and BP86 functionals were used in combination with Ahlrichs family def2-SVP and def2-TZVP basis functions, under the RIJCOSX approximation for Coulomb and HF exchange. Considerable convergence problems have been encountered, in particular for the open-shell configurations. To achieve convergence, a two-step scheme was applied. First, geometry optimization was carried out with the def2-SVP basis and loose convergence criteria, and then, a final calculation was carried out from the molecular orbitals and geometries of these intermediate optimized structures, taken as input but using a larger basis, a fine grid, tight convergence tolerance, and the SlowConv or VerySlowConv options (high mixing degree). Examples of input files and optimized structures are available in the SI. To select an appropriate model size, clusters with n = 3 to 7 (n is the number of metal atoms on an edge) have been studied and the frequencies compared as a function of n. It appears that from n = 4 onward, the calculated frequencies weakly depend on n. To reduce the computation cost without losing accuracy, n = 5 clusters have been retained. Such clusters correspond to small MoS2 flakes yet are observable by conventional TEM (size ~ 1.3 nm). All-electron calculations were implemented. All atoms were relaxed, which seems important for the frequency calculations, because (i) normal vibration modes involve movements of variable number of neighboring atoms sometimes extending relatively far and (ii) unphysical results were often obtained on the constrained models. As calculation of analytical frequencies presented serious convergence problems, numeric frequencies were finally preferred, which are more stable, though arguably less accurate. In cases where both types of frequency calculations converged, the difference of frequencies did not exceed several cm−1."
7,Results and discussion,"In this work we focus on five MoS2-based materials prepared by the same technique but differing in the conditions of preparation and in the presence of a second metal (Co, Ni, Pt). The designations of materials are self-explanatory, indicating composition and activation conditions. One sample (MoS2-H2S-350) was prepared in pure H2S at 350 °C, two (Co-MoS2-H2SH2-350 and Ni-MoS2-H2SH2-350) were activated in a H2S/H2 mixture at 350 °C, and two others (MoS2-H2-400 and Pt-MoS2-H2-400) were prepared in pure H2 at 400 °C. This choice of samples was a compromise between the goal of obtaining maximum information and the limited time available for the INS run. The solids as prepared are supposed to have different sulfur coverage of edges and different proportion of S- and M-edges in the 2D MoS2 slabs morphology. Thus, according to ab initio theory studies [34], a solid prepared in pure H2S such as MoS2-H2S-350 should expose almost exclusively M-edges, whereas molybdenum sulfide samples obtained under hydrogen flow as (Pt)MoS2-H2-400 should expose comparable numbers of S- and M- edges."
8,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The influence of preparation conditions on the catalytic and physical properties in a similar series of unsupported MoS2 catalysts has been studied previously [21]. However, a considerable scale-up was necessary to comply with the requirements of the INS experiment. Whereas the mass of prepared samples in [20] was in the range 0.5–1 g, here we prepared 8–9 g of each sample, using the same lab equipment. We characterized the solids as prepared using a set of usually applied techniques (XRD, BET, XPS, TEM, chemical analysis). The main properties of the solids under study are summarized in Table 1 . The results of TEM, XRD, and XPS characterizations are provided in the supporting information. According to XRD, all samples are dispersions of poorly crystalline 2H-MoS2 (Fig. S1). In the bimetallic catalysts (Co, Ni, Pt)-MoS2, no phases containing the second metal were observed. Analysis of the (002) XRD linewidth using the Scherer formula gives mean stacking from 3 to 5. In agreement with XRD, TEM shows bundles of MoS2 slabs with length 3–6 nm and stacking from 2 to 7, typical for these preparations (Fig. S2). The specific surface area is in the range 51–64 m2/g, in agreement with our previous studies of ATM- derived MoS2 [21]. Chemical analysis (Table 1) shows that four of five samples are overstoichiometric with respect to sulfur; the highest excess of sulfur is found in the MoS2 prepared in pure H2S. The most reduced Pt-doped sample is slightly understoichiometric. The amounts of Co and Ni after washing and resulfidation are far below the initial atomic ratio M/Mo = 0.4 (M = Co, Ni), showing that only part of the Ni or Co introduced in the reflux mixtures was grafted at the edges, whereas the excess of Ni(Co) acetylacetonate remained in the solution. Grafting of nickel appears less efficient than for cobalt. The amount of Pt (introduced not by grafting but by impregnation) was fixed at the 3 wt% level (Table S1 in the supporting information). Accessing the H content by chemical analysis is difficult, as it gives poorly reproducible results. Indeed, recently we demonstrated that edge –SH groups in freshly prepared bulk MoS2 are labile in air and totally disappear during the first hour of air exposure, being replaced by hydroxide groups and water. Moreover, continuous increase of the number of OH groups occurs in time, due to air humidity [35]. For this reason, chemical analysis (CHONS), even after a short air exposure, seems less reliable as a method of H species quantification than the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique discussed in the following sections. XPS shows full sulfidation of the samples (Fig. S3, Table S1). Small amounts of Mo(VI) and S(VI) surface impurities probably come from the imperfections of the sample transfer system. Transition metals are all mostly in the sulfide state, except platinum, which after reduction at 400 °C in H2 is present in a state closer to metal (Table S2). The signal-to-noise ratios in the spectra of the dopant metals were not sufficient to make reliable decomposition for fine analysis of species, for example, to distinguish between Co(Ni)MoS decorated sites and individual (Co, Ni) sulfides, but the Cop 3/2 signal maximum at BE 778.4 eV is close to that reported for the CoMoS phase [36]. According to XPS, the dispersion of Co seems to be better than that of Ni and Pt (Table S2). A significant difference was observed between the composition of sulfur species in the MoS2-H2S-350 sample that contains 24% S(-I) and the reduced samples MoS2-H2-400 and Pt-MoS2-H2-400, in which the amount of S(-I) from disulfide groups is considerably smaller (Fig. S4, Table S1)."
9,Thiophene hydrodesulfurization,"3.2 Thiophene hydrodesulfurization The results of the thiophene HDS test show strong variations of activity with the nature of the second transition metal, in the sequence Co > Ni > Pt. The highest degree of promotion was observed for cobalt: nearly a fourfold increase of activity was achieved vs. the nonpromoted MoS2-H2S-350 sample (Fig. 1 a). A similar promotion procedure carried out with nickel acetylacetonate resulted in lower activity. We therefore expect a smaller decoration effect of Ni and a smaller difference in other properties between the Ni-promoted sample and the nonpromoted one than for the Co-promoted solid. Platinum demonstrated a strong effect on reducibility, but showed the weakest synergy effect. Pt atoms are probably not located at the decoration positions at the MoS2 slab edges, but detailed study of this question remains beyond the scope of this work. A twofold difference in HDS activity between two nonpromoted MoS2 samples is due to the presence in MoS2-H2S-350 of more abundant SH groups, possessing hydrogenating properties [21]. Overall, the HDS activity test used here as a characterization technique, attests a high degree of promotion for the Co-doped sample and confirms the expected differences between nonpromoted samples with different degrees of reduction."
10,Temperature-programmed reduction study,"3.3 Temperature-programmed reduction study TPR allows accessing interaction of MoS2 with hydrogen and speciation of sulfur. The TPR curves of MoS2 often show a sharp low-temperature peak (150–250 °C) appearing due to reduction of the S2 2− moieties [37]. A similar sharp first peak has been observed on sulfur-saturated MoS2 and on amorphous sulfur-rich sulfides [38], having presumably a chainlike structure with abundant S2 2− groups in the structure (Fig. 2 a–2c). After the first peak follows an intermediate zone with less intense H2S release, smeared between 300 and 600 °C. Finally, the ascending TPR branch appears above 700 °C, due to quasi-equilibrium bulk reduction [37]. TPR of MoS2 has been studied by first-principles theory [31,32]. The narrow first peak has been attributed to the reductive transition from 100% S-covered Mo edges to 50% S-covered Mo edges (Fig. 2e and 2f). While the first TPR peak is well identified experimentally and explained by theory, no TPR features of the S-edges had ever been identified. Whether the M- and S- edges are reduced at similar temperatures, or on the contrary, S-edges are too stable (and therefore featureless in TPR) is not clear. TPR patterns for the samples under study are shown in Fig. 1b. For the solids prepared in hydrogen (MoS2-H2-400 and Pt-MoS2-H2-400), the TPR curves are obviously featureless below 400 °C and therefore are not presented. Instead, TPR curves for the nonpromoted MoS2 and the Pt-doped solid reactivated in a 15% H2S/H2 mixture at 350 °C are given, to demonstrate change reducibility due to Pt addition (though these samples were not retained for the INS study and other experiments). A sharp low-temperature TPR peak is expectedly present for MoS2-H2S-350. Its intensity is strongly decreased in MoS2-H2SH2-350 and both Co- and Ni-promoted solids prepared under the same conditions. This finding agrees with the previous attribution of the first TPR peak to the reduction of 100% S-covered M edges. While the intensity of the first peak varies drastically, the broad reduction zone between 300 and 600 °C is invariably present and has a similar shape for all preparations except the Pt-containing one. According to phase diagrams [34], the MoS2-H2S-350 sample is assumed to expose almost exclusively M-edges, whereas MoS2-H2-400 should contain a significant part of S-edges. However, the TPR pattern of MoS2-H2-400 does not show any particular features attributable to S-edges. The TPR curve for the Pt-containing sample shows higher reducibility than for the non-doped sample prepared under the same conditions. Several small peaks appear for Pt-MoS2-H2-400, not typical for the individual MoS2. As the amount of Pt is small and reduction of platinum sulfide is not prone to give intense TPR features, these novel peaks probably correspond to more sharply revealed reduction steps between the MoS2 edge states of different sulfur coverage, which becomes possible due to the high hydrogen-activating power of platinum."
11,Temperature-programmed desorption of H2 and H2S,"3.4 Temperature-programmed desorption of H2 and H2S Temperature-programmed desorption experiments allowed quantifying the amount of hydrogen species in the solids by integration of TPD curves from room temperature to 1050 °C. Hydrogen species are released in two forms: as molecular H2 (Fig. 3 a) and as H2S (Fig. 3b). The amount of desorbed H2 is comparable for all samples, but it decreases in the sequence MoS2-H2S-350 > MoS2-H2-400 > Ni-MoS2-H2SH2-350 > Pt-MoS2-H2-400. The overall amount of released H2 decreases with the degree of sample reduction, but also is less for the promoted solids than for the nonpromoted ones. The H2 TPD curves are shifted toward higher temperatures for more reduced samples. As with the desorbed H2S, its amount strongly differs for the solids under study. For the MoS2-H2S-350 solid, almost one-fifth of the total hydrogen is released as H2S, whereas for Pt-MoS2-H2-400 and MoS2-H2-400, its amount is negligible, being less than 1% as compared with the amount of desorbed H2 (Table S3). As there is no physically adsorbed H2S on the solids (vide infra), the adsorbed hydrogen species is partially present as –SH groups for which thermal recombination leads to the release of H2S. Noteworthily, solution-synthesized amorphous sulfides such as oxysulfide CoSOH [39] and amorphous sulfur-rich sulfides MoS x (x from 3 to 6) [39], when exposed to static hydrogen even under ambient conditions, absorbed large amounts of hydrogen (as much as 0.3 mol of H2/Co atom and up to 0.5 mol H2/mol Mo) without any apparent changes in their structure. For these amorphous sulfides, all sulfur atoms are involved in the S–S bridges and H2 absorption occurs as formation of SH groups due to S–S bond cleavage. Thermal desorption leads to release of hydrogen species, mostly as H2S. Therefore the dominant form of desorbed H species strongly depends on the stoichiometry: the greater the excess of sulfur, the greater is the part released as H2S."
12,Inelastic neutron scattering experiment,"3.5 Inelastic neutron scattering experiment Inelastic neutron scattering as a form of vibration spectroscopy has a great advantage for studying hydrogen in catalysts, because the INS cross-section is much higher for hydrogen than for other elements [40]. Moreover, it probes the whole Brillouin zone and has no selection rules, which makes attribution of the INS spectral lines quite straightforward. In contrast, as even for high-frequency modes the impacting neutrons are able to excite not only the first but several vibrational levels, the INS spectra usually show several harmonic replicas of the same pattern. Besides the type of moving nuclei, the INS cross section depends on the movement amplitude. That is why, in contrast to IR- spectra, bending and wagging modes usually have higher INS amplitudes than stretching ones [41,42]. Heterolytic vs. homolytic H2 adsorption on different sulfides have been studied by INS and actively debated in the literature. Thus, for H2 adsorption on the ruthenium sulfide RuS2, INS suggested heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 with formation of Ru–H and S–H bonds [43], but in another study, only SH groups were observed [44]. On the other hand, only SH groups were detected on amorphous MoS x sulfides [39]. Therefore it was not a priori clear whether the M-H species could be present in the bimetallic catalysts or in the reduced MoS2. The INS spectra are shown in Fig. 4 . The intensity of the signal varies significantly, but the position of the main peaks and their relative intensity are similar for all five materials. The maxima of all lines coincide within 10 cm−1 accuracy (Fig. S5). Therefore, no change in the nature of the main H species could be inferred, whatever the sample and whatever the treatment temperature. For two differently treated samples of MoS2 and three bimetallic materials, the major hydrogen species showed a vibration band at 83–-85 meV (685–692 cm−1) and its harmonics. A similar frequency was previously attributed to bending vibrations in the surface –S–H groups [15–20]. Due to anharmonicity effects [45], the frequencies of overtones are slightly lower than integer multiples of the main line (Fig. 4). The S–H stretching region at ca. 2500 cm−1 overlaps with the third harmonics of bending vibration and could not be analyzed. No evidence of Mo–H bonding, nor of M-H where M is a promoting atom (expected above 800 cm−1), could be inferred from the INS spectra. A pronounced shoulder is observed for the Co-promoted sample and for the MoS2-H2S-350 material in the range between 610 and 625 cm−1. INS peaks decomposition with PEAKFIT software (Fig. S6, Table S4) indicates that this shoulder peak is also present in other samples, but in much smaller amounts. Being relatively close to the main peak, this shoulder is probably also attributable to the S–H bending, but in a modified coordination. The materials at stake are supposed to have different proportions of S- and M-edges, as well as (for promoted catalysts) considerable numbers of promoting atoms in the decoration position. The observed similarity of the main INS frequency could be explained formally in several ways. Either the stable H species have similar environments (and therefore vibration frequency) on both M- and S-edges, as well as on the promoted sites, or only one of two edges accommodates stable adsorbed H species. Another possible explanation is that only one type of edge structures is actually exposed in all samples. These alternatives are discussed in more detail in the next section. The integral intensity of INS vibrations for five samples at stake correlates with the variations of the amount of hydrogen in the material, as determined from TPD experiments (Fig. S7). The linear regression line has a slope close to 1 and crosses the Y axis near the origin. Therefore all the H species are probed by INS, and, the other way around, no H species escape detection by TPD. Our values are close to those reported by Polz et al. [46], who studied the volumetric H2 uptake on similar polycrystalline MoS2 (39 m2/g) and concluded that H2 activation goes via homolytic dissociation. Hydrogen uptake (Table 1) was always significantly lower than could be accommodated by the edges at a hypothetic 1:1 Mo to H stoichiometry. Indeed, full edge coverage by H atoms would correspond to the stoichiometry in the range from H0.31MoS2+δ for 5-nm triangles to H0.18MoS2+δ for 6-nm hexagons (Fig. S8). The measured H2 uptake values are several times lower than these theoretical values. The BET specific surface areas of all samples (51–64 m2/g) are an order of magnitude lower than the theoretical values for single sheets. Indeed, the theoretical surface area for monolayer fringes is greater than 550 m2/g (for an infinite single sheet) and depends on the edges’ contribution (Fig. S9). Thus, the edge surface for the 5-nm-size triangular particles is 120 m2/g, which is twice the total measured BET surface areas. This means that the samples expose to nitrogen only a minor part of all edges. Stacking of slabs and agglomeration of stack bundles are obvious reasons for this difference. It seems not clear, however, what is the physical nature of the relationship between the total amount of edges available, the BET surface area, and the hydrogen uptake. Two alternative (non-mutually-exclusive) pictures are possible, which for better visual representation are sketched in Fig. S10. In the first case (Fig. S10a), hydrogen is adsorbed only on the surface available for the BET measurements. As hydrogen is chemically adsorbed only on the edges and not on basal planes, the possible H2 uptake corresponds to the part of the edges in the total BET surface area. Under this assumption, H2 should occur on approximately 10% of total slab edges present in the solid. Then to explain the observed H2 uptake, an edge H:Mo adsorption stoichiometry close to 2 should be assumed (Table S5). In the second hypothetical case, after being dissociated, atomic hydrogen can freely penetrate in between the agglomerates of stacks. Then incomplete coverage of edges by H atoms (low H:Mo stoichiometry) should be assumed to explain the observed H2 uptake. At this point, we cannot distinguish these two effects, but the second hypothesis of incomplete coverage seems more probable. Indeed, the edge H:Mo stoichiometry of 2 or higher seems chemically unreasonable, in particular for the samples treated at 400 °C, because it assumes the existence of two thermally stable germinal SH groups at each edge Mo atom. Moreover, the observed H2 uptake is not proportional to the BET surface area, as it should be in the first case. Thus, for two solids reduced at 400 °C, BET specific surface areas and XRD/TEM morphologies are similar. However, one sample (H0.044MoS2.03) adsorbs considerably more hydrogen than another (H0.024PtMoS1.99). This difference could be explained only by different chemical properties of the edges."
13,Results of density functional theory calculations as compared with the inelastic neutron scattering spectra,"3.6 Results of density functional theory calculations as compared with the inelastic neutron scattering spectra DFT calculations have been carried out to compare calculated and experimental frequencies and to explain the nature of the observed low-frequency shoulder. Nonperiodic calculations using ORCA code were carried out. However, our results could be compared approximately with the previous plane-wave periodic calculations, where the M- and S-edge supercells of size comparable to our clusters were. As far as comparison is possible, our results are not far from those reported in the most recent calculations by Prodhomme et al. [32] using VASP code and the PW91 functional. In our calculations, we did not compare the energies, but focused on the frequency calculations for triangular clusters with S- and M-edge structures, similar to those reported previously [35]. In addition, we studied Co-substituted and corner configurations that seemed plausible in such catalysts. As only cobalt showed a large promotion effect and a significant difference of INS spectrum from nonpromoted samples, Pt- and Ni-doped edges were not considered. On the other hand, since compelling evidence exists of the coexistence of large amounts of S2 2− and SH species in the MoS2-H2S-350 sample, we considered M-edges containing such moieties. Significant relaxation from the ideal MoS2 structure has been observed in all cases. Thus, in the 100% S-covered S-edge triangles, dimerization of the S as well as Mo–Mo bonds was observed, as reported in [35]. Detailed analysis of these effects is beyond the scope of this study. The values of calculated vibrations frequencies are summarized in Table 2 . A full list of the structures and the numerical conditions is given in Table S1. Our calculations reproduce the experimental frequency of H2S bending within 10 cm−1 range (exact value obtained for PBE0, Table S6). However, for the Mo-containing clusters, there are no benchmark experimental references and the error could be larger. As the published scaling factors for these functionals and bases vary from approximately 0.98 to 1.04 [49, 59], the overall accuracy of 20 cm−1 at the main line frequency 680–690 cm−1 seems reasonable; that is, the frequencies within the range 20 cm−1 around the experimental values could be considered as matching. Several model structures give SH bending vibration frequencies close enough to the experimental one (Table 2). These include the Mo–SH–Mo bond on the 50% and 100% S-covered S edge-like structures (entries 1 and 3) and the 100% S–covered M-edge configurations with germinal and vicinal SH groups (entries 9–11). As several configurations give an approximate match between the calculated and experimental frequencies, a simple selection of calculated frequency that is closest to the experimental value is not sufficient to conclude on the nature of species. A chemical rationale is necessary to rule out certain species as main contributors and to privilege others. An important caveat should be noted concerning the relative and the absolute accuracy of the DFT-calculated frequencies. It is well known that the relative values of vibration frequencies are much better predicted than the absolute values, so that additional scaling of frequencies is usually necessary [49]. Our DFT frequency calculation accuracy is about 20 cm−1. Then if, for example, DFT frequencies calculated for two alternative species A and B differ from the experimental value by 15 cm−1 and −15 cm−1, then both A and B structures are matching as absolute values and we cannot decide from DFT only which one is appropriate. However, if both A and B structures were observed in a series of measurements, then DFT calculation would reliably predict the relative 30 cm−1 shift between them. From comparison between the observed and calculated frequencies, the presence of any significant amounts of physically adsorbed H2S (1183 cm−1) can be ruled out. By the same token, no stable Mo–H or Co–H species could be present in these systems (frequencies above 800 cm−1, Table S6). Isolated Mo-SH groups at the corner position (Table 2, entry 5) should give a significantly lower bending frequency than is experimentally observed and can be ruled out as well. In contrast, bridging Mo–SH–Mo groups at the 50% or 100% sulfur-covered S-edges (662 and 686 cm−1, entries 1 and 3) are formally eligible as the main SH species. However, the (presumably all M-edge) MoS2-H2S-350 solid shows the same frequency as in MoS2-H2-400 and Pt-MoS2-H2-400, potentially containing S-edges. As with 100% S-covered S-edges, they are not assumed to be formed either in MoS2-H2S-350 (because of 2D morphology) or in MoS2-H2-400 and Pt-MoS2-H2-400 (because of edge reduction). The 50% S-edge could in principle be present in the MoS2-H2-400 and Pt-MoS2-H2-400 samples. However, the frequency of 662 cm−1 for the 50% covered S-edge is sufficiently different from the frequencies expected for sulfur-saturated M edges (689, 697, and 675 cm−1, respectively) to be detected as a systematic shift between sulfur-saturated and reduced samples, which is not the case. Therefore, hydrogen species located at the S-edges are not predominant in our samples. At best they are present simultaneously with the M-edge SH groups but are hidden due to frequency overlap. Previous DFT calculations [32] predict stretching modes at 1374 and 1285 cm−1 for the 50% covered S edge, due to bridging SH and MoH groups bonded in parallel to adjacent edge Mo atoms. If present, these modes should overlap with the second harmonic of the main line, having a maximum at 1340–1350 cm−1. However, both the intensity and position of this second line follow the first one as the second harmonic should, without anomalies. Such in-step behavior of the second line vs. the main one leaves little room for the eventual contribution of other species. Nevertheless, the possibility of heterolytic H2 chemisorption on the S-edge remains an open question due to the current experimental limitations of INS. At the M-edge, several configurations have been considered, differing in approximate S coverage from 100% to 25%. Such configurations may contain µ2 (bridging) and µ1 (dangling) SH groups as well as S2 2− surface moieties. Bridging Mo–SH–Mo groups are always formed after geometry optimization on the reduced surfaces (50% S coverage and below), whatever the initial configuration. For the bridging SH groups located at the reduced M-edges, calculations give systematically lower frequencies than for the isolated dangling SH groups (Table 2, entries 6, 7 vs. 9–11). As is well known from the IR spectroscopy of oxides, the OH vibration frequency varies in the sequence isolated > bridged > tribridged [50]. The magnitude of the effect in oxides vs. sulfides must be different, but the chemical rationale is the same. Our calculations suggest that if the predominant type of H species were changed from dangling to bridging SH bonds, then a tangible frequency decrease should be observed. No frequency decrease was observed experimentally for the reduced solids vs. sulfur-saturated ones. Therefore the presence of bridging SH groups on the M-edges as major species seems less probable. Between 100% and 50% sulfur coverage, multiple configurations could be proposed, in which isolated SH groups and disulfide moieties are present at the M-edge. Characterizations give evidence that in the sulfur-saturated sample abundant S2 2− moieties are present simultaneously with the –SH groups (cf. TPR and TPD curves and XPS spectra). However, for the reduced samples, disulfide groups are virtually absent, but the same SH species are still detected in comparable amounts. Therefore the SH groups of the same type are present on the sulfur-saturated M edges (where they coexist with the S2 2− groups) and then on the reduced solids. We conclude then that the main SH-bending INS signal belongs rather to the isolated SH groups, in which Mo preserves a six-coordinated state, as depicted in Table 2, entry 11. Such groups coexisting with the S2 2− ones may be natural primary products of the interaction of sulfur-saturated slab with H2 (Fig. 2), but as we see from the INS experiment, they are formed already during preparation in pure H2S; that is, no formation of the hydrogenless totally sulfur-covered edge (Fig. 2d) is necessary. During reduction with H2, disulfide groups are eliminated. When sulfur coverage decreases below 50%, Mo–S–Mo bridges are formed, which are less reactive toward hydrogen, in step with the decrease of hydrogen uptake observed experimentally (remarkably, according to TPD, hydrogen uptake decreased by orders of magnitude for the MoS2 reduced at 700 °C [21]). The presence of abundant disulfide groups distinguishes the sulfur-saturated sample from others, and is correlated with appearance of a strong shoulder at 610–625 cm−1. As shown by DFT calculations, appearance of a low-frequency signal could be explained by interaction between the disulfide and SH groups. Thus, if a single SH group is located between two S2 2− moieties, then after geometry optimization it invariably turns toward one of them and interacts strongly. Geometry optimization leads to hydrogen-bonded S–H–S species and the corresponding frequencies below the main experimental value, but closer to the position of the shoulder (Table 2, entry 8). Again, an analogy seems relevant to the well-known effects in the IR spectra of oxides, where hydrogen-bonded OH groups are broadened and have lower frequencies than isolated groups of the same chemical nature [45]. More generally, without considering direct S–H–S bonding, the neighboring S2 2− group vibrations may interact with the SH-bending vibrations and modify (decrease) their frequencies. Group vibrations of S–S at 530–550 cm−1 and SH bending modes at 675–690 cm−1 are coupled and generate novel normal modes with the frequencies in between the values for the corresponding isolated groups. This effect may contribute to the appearance of a low-frequency shoulder. For vicinal and geminal (SH)2 species, the calculated frequencies split into asymmetric and symmetric modes separated by ca. 10–20 cm−1 (entries 9–11 of Table 2). These modes should not be distinguishable as separate peaks by INS with its resolution of 20 cm−1, but might contribute to line broadening. The presence of vicinal SH groups cannot be formally excluded, yet seems less probable. Such structures should rather correspond to the transient states of irreversible reaction between H2 and disulfide groups. The cobalt-promoted sample showed the strongest low-frequency shoulder, which distinguishes it from other bimetallic samples. Therefore, Co-substituted structures have been studied to explain the origin of this pronounced feature at 610–625 cm−1. If a Mo–SH fragment was replaced by a Co–SH one within the same structure, the resulting frequency was always significantly higher than in the corresponding all-Mo structure (entries 1, 2 and 4, 5). Therefore, substitution of Co for Mo within the same structure is ruled out. On the other hand, if the Co atom was put in a position adjacent to the Mo–SH group and the coordination number of Co was lowered from 6 to 4, then we obtained a decreased SH frequency, matching the shoulder position (entry 14). Lowering of the frequency was in this case due to transition from an all-Mo structure with dangling SH bonds (entry 12) to the substituted structure with a bridging Co–SH–Mo fragment (entry 14). The bending frequency in this bridging SH group is higher than that for the analogous Mo–SH–Mo structure, but lower than in the parent all-Mo structure with dangling SH bonds. It seems important that the Mo atom linked to the SH group should remain six-coordinated, in order for the Mo–SH bond to be easily inclined toward the adjacent cobalt atom, to form a bridge (nonbonding S–Co distance of 2.4–2.5 Å). Otherwise, if the Mo atom is pentacoordinated, a dangling SH bond remains vertically oriented, formation of a bridge seems unfavorable, and a high frequency is predicted (entry 13). An alternative explanation of the low-frequency shoulder in the Co-promoted catalyst is formation of a “corner-like” structure (Table 2, entry 5). This structure is naturally formed at the slab corners, but also if Co atoms are grafted on top of the existing edges. These two possibilities (entries 14 and 5) cannot be distinguished on the basis of our results. The final answer might be given only if coordination of cobalt within the promoted catalyst prepared using the acetylacetonate method [33] were established more accurately. Grafting of Co on top of MoS2 edges with creation of cornerlike geometries seems plausible. Thus, XAS data for CoMoS catalysts show coordination numbers of Co lower than they should be in the linear edge-substituted structures [51,52]."
14,Conclusions,"The following conclusions can be drawn from the presented results: (i) Only SH groups are formed as stable hydrogen-containing species on the surfaces of the MoS2-based solids under study (homolytic dissociation). (ii) The same type of SH species is stable at the surface of nanocrystalline MoS2, independent of the preparation conditions (H2S, H2, or H2S/H2 mixture) and of the presence of a second metal (Co, Ni, Pt). No tangible difference between the structures presumably exposing M- and S-edges could be identified. (iii) The edges of sulfur-saturated MoS2 prepared in pure H2S, are not fully covered with S2 2− species (as in Fig. 2d), but comparable amounts of SH and S2 2− species coexist on them (as in Table 2, entry 11). Such configurations were neither previously demonstrated by experiment nor predicted by theory. (iv) A low-frequency component (610–625 cm−1) is systematically present in the INS spectra of our samples. This component is particularly intense for sulfur-saturated and for Co-promoted solids. It is attributable to the interaction between SH groups and S2 2− species and/or adjacent Co atoms. (v) Hydrogen uptake is greater than could be expected from the BET surface areas, suggesting that hydrogen penetrates between the stack agglomerates to the edges inside the sample, unavailable for nitrogen adsorption. (vi) Hydrogen uptake decreases with the degree of reduction of MoS2 edges. However, complete elimination of observable S2 2− moieties from the surface by reduction at 400 °C leads to only a moderate decrease in the amount of hydrogen species. Stability and abundance of SH groups on the edges of MoS2 slabs, as demonstrated here, obviously impact the models applied and the interpretations given to other characterizations, such as low-temperature CO adsorption [53,54]. Indeed, even if the presence of surface hydrogen species at the HDS reaction temperatures had been debated [25,31], the SH groups are massively present at the temperatures of characterization experiments (ambient, 100 K). Preliminary DFT results show that the presence of SH groups might strongly impact the frequencies of adsorbed CO. Beyond MoS2, many studies have been focused on the interaction of H2 with other lamellar sulfides. Some of them, such as NbS2 and TaS2, can intercalate hydrogen within the layers, whereas others, such as WS2 [55], do not intercalate but adsorb hydrogen on the surface. Interaction of sulfides with hydrogen is of both fundamental and practical interest not only for heterogeneous catalysis and not only for molybdenum, but for other metals and for other applications, such as electrocatalysts [56] or sensors [57]."
