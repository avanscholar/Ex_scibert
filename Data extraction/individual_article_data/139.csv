0,Introduction,"Supercritical (sc) alcohols are considered to be excellent reaction media (as both reactant and solvent), which are very attractive and promising to be used in new industrial processes and technologies. So, sc alcohols are known to be very effective for liquefaction of woody or grassy biomass and hydrodeoxygenative upgrading of crude bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis of different lignocellulosic feedstocks [1–7]. In the hydrotreating process, sc alcohols act as hydrogen donor and alkylating agent enhancing the liquid fractions yield with a reduced content of oxygen [8,9]. The same properties of supercritical alcohols are in demand for upgrading unconventional crude oils, vacuum residues, different petroleum feedstocks including asphaltenes [10–12], as well as low rank coals [13]. The beneficial property demonstrated by sc alcohols during upgrading was desulfurization and denitrogenation ability [13,14]. Similar to the degradation process of lignocellulosic materials and as a step towards green chemical recycling, depolymerization or decompositon of some plastics and polymer wastes can be successfully realized in sc alcohols [15,16]. Other important chemical process is supercritical biodiesel (or biofuel) production mainly conducted in sc methanol or sc ethanol [17–20]. As a new technology, the sc transesterification process offers several advantages over other conventional methods: catalyst-free reaction, no soap and wastewater formation, short residence time, high reaction rate, a wide variety of bio-feedstock (including lower quality ones) and no pretreatment requirement. Additionally, pronounced alkylation ability of sc alcohols can be useful and suited for practical application in new chemical technologies. For sc alcohols, C- and N-alkylation of aromatic or N-heteroaromatic rings is well-known [21–24]. C-alkylation of olefins [25] and O-/N-alkylation of phenols [24], anilines [24,26,27] or aliphatic amino alcohols [28] are also well-documented. Reducing properties of sc alcohols, mainly H-donor activity, are very important feature of the SCF technology that provides clear advantage over hydrogenation processes, for example, in transfer hydrogenation reaction (THR), which can be considered as a green alternative of conventional catalytic hydrogenation. The most studied version of the THR is the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reaction (MPV reaction), in which conventionally the aluminum isopropoxide Al(i-PrO)3 in 2-PrOH is applied as a catalyst for reduction of ketones and aldehydes. A modified version of the MPV reaction involves the use of another type of base (alkali or alkoxide) that is different from Al(i-PrO)3. At the same time, the non-catalytic and base-free THR of ketones/aldehydes with alcohols is known since 1983 [29] and usually proceeds at temperature above 300 °C under supercritical conditions of aliphatic alcohols [30–34]. But a range of carbonyl compounds involved in THR under sc conditions is still scarce and rather limited to simple ones showing good reactivity. The TH reduction (MPV reaction) of sterically hindered or other low-reactive ketones without any catalyst or base remains insufficiently studied. Naturally occurring menthone and menthol are terpene compounds of great practical importance since both of them have a large number of useful biological properties, in particular antifungal [35], antiviral [36], anticancer [37], insecticidal [38–40], acaricidal [41], nematicidal [42] activities, inhibition or inactivation of some enzymes [43,44], and gastroprotective [45] effect together with well-known antibacterial [46,47], anti-inflammatory [48], anesthetic [49,50], and antioxidant [48] activities. In 2016, the total world production of menthol was about 48,000 metric tons. The global sales are expected to reach the level of 61,600 metric tons in 2022 [51]. But the worldwide demand of menthol substantially exceeds available natural resources. The deficiency is compensated by synthetic menthol which can be obtained via hydrogenation [52,53] or reduction [54,55] reactions of menthone. However, the menthone reactivity in hydrogenation or reduction reactions is low enough due to both steric bulk of an isopropyl substituent adjacent to a carbonyl group and an electron-donating inductive effect (+I effect) of carbon chain substituents of CO group. For that reason, modern cost-effective methods of menthone reduction are urgently needed to be developed. Alternative reduction of menthone can be realized under MPV reaction conditions where aliphatic alcohols act as a hydrogen source. However, only a few MPV reactions of menthone were described in the literature during last 50 years. Importantly, a catalyst and/or strong base (for instance, metal alkoxide) needed to be used in each of them. So, when the conventional Al(i-PrO)3/i-PrOH couple is used for MPV, the menthone conversion reaches 97% for 2 h at 82 °C [56]. If Al(i-PrO)3 is replaced by sodium isopropoxide, the menthone conversion may be nearly the same (90–99%) using the chelate complexes of ruthenium or osmium as the main homogeneous catalyst [57,58]. A heterogeneous catalyst was obtained by grafting the ruthenium chelate complex onto the SiO2 surface. In the presence of NaOH, the catalyst provided a 93% conversion of menthone for 26 h at 80 °C [59]. So far, there are no any other examples of heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts for the menthone reduction under the THR conditions, as well as non-catalytic or base-free THR of menthone. Taking into account the low reactivity of menthone and developing eco-friendly approach for the synthesis, it seems important to apply a heterogeneous catalyst and base-free reaction conditions for the reduction of sterically hindered and low-reactive ketones like menthone in the THR. For lab- and pilot-scale studies, heterogeneous catalysts based on abundant, inexpensive, non-toxic, and non-noble metals can be very promising candidates for THR of ketones, in particular metal nickel catalysts (Raney® nickel, supported Ni catalysts, nickel nanoparticles, etc.) which are readily available. Some TH reactions with using both alcohols as a H-donor and Raney® Ni as a heterogeneous catalyst are known. So, in the presence of Raney® Ni, ethyl levulinate derived from lignocellulosic biomass is reduced by 2-PrOH or 2-BuOH in high yield (99% and 92%, respectively) for 9 h at room temperature under argon and further γ-valerolactone, which is a valuable platform molecule, is formed [60]. The H-donor activity of other alcohols (MeOH, EtOH, 1-PrOH, and cyclohexanol) under the same reaction conditions was significantly lower (24–35% yields) [61]. Unexpectedly, Raney® Ni demonstrated the best catalytic activity among heterogeneous catalysts: neither supported nickel catalysts (Ni/TiO2, Ni/SiO2, Ni/CeO2, Ni/C), nor carbon-supported noble metals (Au/C, Pd/C) show acceptable catalytic efficiency at room temperature [60]. In addition, both ceria-supported nickel catalyst and nickel nanoparticles exhibit high catalytic activity in isopropanol to reduce aliphatic and aromatic ketones, including sterically hindered ones, with high yield [62–64]. The efficient reduction of sterically hindered compounds is still a great challenge. For instance, the difference in the reaction time for full conversion of structurally similar cyclohexanones can reach two orders of magnitude under the same TH reaction conditions [65]. Herein, we report a non-catalyzed and base-free transfer hydrogenation of menthone by six primary and secondary alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol) as hydrogen source under supercritical conditions (at 350 °C). The aim of this study is to investigate a comparable reactivity of sc alcohols in THR of menthone and difference between primary and secondary alcohols as a reactant. We compare the process selectivity with those of the transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by well-known hydrogenation catalyst Raney® nickel under milder subcritical conditions (at 150 °C). The latter process seems to be synthetically more simple reaction and remarkably efficient way to reduce low-reactive ketones like menthone. General scheme of menthone reduction by alcohols is shown in Fig. 1 ."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and solvents,"2.1 Reagents and solvents All solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received: acetone (≥ 99.5%, Sigma–Aldrich), aluminum–nickel alloy (purum, 50% Al basis and 50% Ni basis, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-butanol (ACS reagent, ≥ 99.4%, Sigma–Aldrich), 2-butanol (≥ 99.5%, Sigma–Aldrich), (1R,2S,5R)-(–)-menthol (≥ 99%, Sigma–Aldrich), (2S,5R)-(–)-menthone (97%, L-menthone, Alfa Aesar), 1-propanol (ACS reagent, ≥ 99.5%, Sigma–Aldrich), 2-propanol (≥ 99.5%, Sigma–Aldrich), and sulfolane (99.0%, Aldrich). Critical parameters of used alcohols are taken from NIST Chemistry WebBook (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/name-ser/). For methanol: T cr = 240 °C, P cr = 80 atm, ρ cr = 0.27 g/cm3; ethanol: T cr = 241 °C, P cr = 62 atm, ρ cr = 0.28 g/cm3; 1-propanol: T cr = 264 °C, P cr = 51 atm, ρ cr = 0.28 g/cm3; 2-propanol (isopropanol): T cr = 236 °C, P cr = 48 atm, ρ cr = 0.27 g/cm3; 1-butanol: T cr = 289 °C, P cr = 44 atm, ρ cr = 0.27 g/cm3; 2-butanol (sec-butanol): T cr = 263 °C, P cr = 41 atm, ρ cr = 0.28 g/cm3."
3,Non-catalytic transfer hydrogenation of menthone by sc alcohol at 350 °C,"2.2 Non-catalytic transfer hydrogenation of menthone by sc alcohol at 350 °C The batch reactor was charged with ∼ 123–127 mL of alcohol, 0.50 g of menthone, and 0.25 g of sulfolane (internal standard). Before heating, the bolted closure reactor was purged with argon. The reaction occurred for 5 h with stirring rate of 800 rpm in all runs at a constant temperature of 350 ± 1 °C and a density of reaction mixture of approximately 0.33 g/cm3. The heating time was 45 − 55 min to reach the reaction temperature starting from 25 °C with heating rate of ∼7 °C/min. During the reaction, samples of the reaction mixture were collected hourly to the sampler by using a sampling system. Alcohol (2.5–3 mL) was pumped into the reactor after each sampling to keep a constant pressure inside. After cooling reactor to room temperature (30–40 min), the final reaction mixture was dumped to the collection vessel and, along with other samples, analyzed by GC–MS method. The reaction pressure depended on the alcohol used and rose slowly to the end of the reaction due to thermal decomposition of alcohol: for methanol, from 201 up to 210 atm; for ethanol, from 168 up to 172 atm; for 1-propanol, from 104 up to 109 atm; for 2-propanol, from 116 up to 128 atm; for 1-butanol, from 78 up to 85 atm; and for 2-butanol from 92 up to 99 atm, respectively. After cooling of the reactor to room temperature (30 min), the residual pressure after the reaction was 3–6 atm."
4,Transfer hydrogenation of menthone catalyzed by Raney® nickel at 150 °C,"2.3 Transfer hydrogenation of menthone catalyzed by Raney® nickel at 150 °C The batch reactor was charged with ∼123–127 mL of alcohol, 0.50 g of menthone, 0.25 g of sulfolane (internal standard), and freshly prepared Raney® nickel (∼300 mg). Before heating, the bolted closure reactor was purged with argon. The reaction occurred for 5 h with stirring rate of 800 rpm in all runs at a constant temperature of 150 ± 1 °C. The heating time was 15–20 min to reach the reaction temperature starting from 25 °C with heating rate of ∼7 °C/min. During the reaction, samples of the reaction mixture were collected hourly to the sampler by using a sampling system. Alcohol (2.5–3 mL) was pumped into the reactor after each sampling to keep a constant pressure inside. After cooling reactor to room temperature (20–30 min), the final reaction mixture was dumped to the vessel through the port and, along with other samples, analyzed by GC–MS method."
5,Analysis of reaction mixtures,"2.4 Analysis of reaction mixtures The identification of the products was performed by GC–MS method on a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GCMS–QP2010 SE equipped with autosampler. A 30 m-long quartz capillary column VF-5 ms with 0.25 mm i.d. was used for the analysis; the film thickness of the stationary phase (5% diphenylsiloxane – 95% dimethylsiloxane copolymer) was 0.25 μm; helium was as the carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1; a split ratio was 1:25; the injector temperature was 250 °C; the temperature program was 3 min at 50 °C, 50–280 °C (15 °C min-1), and 280 °C (20 min). The qualitative analysis was carried out by comparing the retention time of the components and their complete mass spectra with the corresponding data for the pure compounds and with the data from the NIST and Wiley7 mass spectral libraries. Sulfolane was used as internal standard for the quantitative assessment of the products. Some chromatograms of the reaction mixture are shown in Supporting Information file."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst-free THR under supercritical conditions,"3.1 Catalyst-free THR under supercritical conditions It was observed that all chosen alcohols (four primary and two secondary ones) react with menthone approximately in the same way. At 350 °C, menthone conversion (58–69%) depends little on the alcohol type: EtOH>2-PrOH>1-PrOH≈1-BuOH≈2-BuOH > MeOH (Fig. 2 , solid lines with symbol). The process selectivity on menthol decreases is the similar way: EtOH≈1-BuOH≥1-PrOH≥2-PrOH>2-BuOH > MeOH (Fig. 2, dash lines). The selectivity on menthol is very high (92–99%) for all alcohols except MeOH (73%). So, the reaction with methanol is characterized by a lower conversion of menthone and a higher amount of side products compared to the other alcohols. For 5 h of the reaction, the best result of the TH reduction of menthone was obtained in supercritical ethanol: the conversion and selectivity on menthols were 69% and 99%, correspondingly. In total, the reduction of low-reactive ketones as menthone by aliphatic alcohols can be successfully realized with high conversion and close selectivity under non-catalytic and base-free conditions at 350 °C. The trend of menthone conversion in all alcohols clearly indicates the possibility of achieving about 100% conversion in all reaction. Regarding the process of the hydrogen transfer from alcohol molecule, a simple, clear and non-contradictory explanation of the H-donor phenomenon has not yet been reached. Trying to explain our results of the non-catalytic TH reduction by different alcohols, we browsed and analyzed the main macroscopic properties of the alcohols paying particular attention to the heterolytic OH dissociation energy (pK a, ROH → RO– + H+) [66], the Kamlet–Taft solvent parameters (especially the hydrogen bond donation ability, the hydrogen bond acceptance ability, and polarity/polarizability parameter) [67], and dielectric constants. Unfortunately, none of these characteristics can explain the experimental sequence of alcohol H-donor activity. Only the homolytic OH dissociation energy (the bond dissociation enthalpy, R1R2(H)CO–H → R1R2(H)CO· + ·H) [68] predicts the activity of alcohols close to our data (2-PrOH > EtOH > MeOH) and may help to elucidate the nature of the phenomenon. An additional argument for the possible mechanism is the order of the homolytic R1R2(HO)C–H cleavage in alcohols molecule: secondary > primary > methyl [69]. If the alcohol used as a hydrogen source undergoes the dehydrogenation (R1R2(H)CO–H → R1R2C = O + H2, i.e. simultaneous breaking of both R1R2(H)CO–H and R1R2(HO)C–H bonds) as the first stage of the THR, the useful information is the oxidation enthalpy (ΔH) of the alcohol. The yield of the MPV type reduction is known to depend on the ΔH: the lower the oxidation enthalpy of alcohol, the higher the yield [34,70]. In general, the ΔH of a secondary alcohol is lower than that of a primary alcohol. Therefore, the secondary alcohol should be a better reducing reagent than the primary alcohol and the alcohol H-donating activity should be as follows: 2-BuOH≥2-PrOH>1-BuOH≥1-PrOH ≥ EtOH > MeOH. Again, the predicted sequence of alcohols activity correlates weakly (only partially) with the experimental menthone conversion and selectivity on menthol (Fig. 2). Thus, other arguments should be found for correct explanation of the results obtained. The only conclusion we can made is that the simultaneous homolytic cleavage of the bonds does not contradict the concerted mechanism postulated for the non-catalytic reduction of carbonyl group of ketone using supercritical alcohol [33]. According to the mechanism (Scheme 1 ), the hydrogens on the α-C and the O of alcohol transfer to the carbonyl C and O of the ketone, respectively, proceeded via a six-membered cyclic transition state. For the transition state, it is reasonable to consider the steric hindrance effect of the alcohols molecule which should be obviously different. There is another real reason that could explain very similar values of menthone conversion obtained in the TH reaction with different alcohols. It is quite feasible that the reaction may be catalyzed by trace metals amount that was leached by supercritical alcohols from the reactor walls. To exclude the possibility, we did the ICP–MS comparative analysis of trace metals amount (Cr, Ti, Fe, Ni, and Mo) in three alcohols (MeOH, EtOH and 2-PrOH) before and after the reaction (the results are included in Supporting Information file). Additionally, we carried out the alternative menthone reduction in sealed glass tubes for methanol and isopropanol to avoid a catalytic influence of dissolved metals amount. It was shown that ppb concentrations of trace metals are expectedly changed during the reaction and the total concentration of all dissolved metals in the final reaction mixtures was lower than 16 molar ppb. But the main result of the study is that there is no difference in both menthone conversion and selectivity on menthols formation if we compare the reaction in a batch reactor with metal walls and in sealed glass tube (the results are shown in Supporting Information file)."
8,Menthone/isomenthone isomerization in supercritical alcohols,"3.2 Menthone/isomenthone isomerization in supercritical alcohols Isomenthone is found in all reaction mixtures, and its amount is changed during the reaction (Fig. 3 ). The initial ratio of menthone/isomenthone (M-to-IsoM ratio) in commercial menthone was 65.7:1 and decreased to 2.94–6.33 when the reactor was heated up to 350 °C (Fig. 3, zero reaction time). Afterwards it was stabilized after 1 h of the reaction at the level of 1.31–1.42 for different alcohols to give a quasi-equilibrium mixture of isomeric menthone/isomenthone reached via enolization (Scheme 1). The mixture of four menthol isomers was formed during the reaction including menthol, neomenthol, isomenthol, and neoisomenthol. It means that the reduction rates of menthone and isomenthone are close enough (cf Ref. [56]), but the reactions are not highly stereoselective: the reduction of every menthones gives two stereoisomeric menthols in comparable amounts. To evaluate the quasi-equilibrium of M-to-IsoM isomerization, the equilibrium constant and the Gibbs energy (ΔG) of the isomerization in each alcohol were calculated. The values of lnK and ΔG seem to be quite small and vary within a narrow range of 0.270-to-0.351 and (–0.43)-to-(–0.33), correspondingly (Table 1 ). The Gibbs energies of M-to-IsoM isomerization obtained for various alcohols at 350 °C were close to that evaluated for isomerization at 25 °C (–0.53 kcal/mol) [71]. At first glance, there is no difference between the isomerization process of menthone at 25 °C (at atmospheric pressure) and under supercritical conditions at 350 °C (at 78–210 atm), which, in fact, was unexpected and unpredictable in advance. For 2-PrOH, we tested the non-catalytic THR of menthone at 250 °C to find the lower reaction temperature. The conversion was only 7.0–7.5% for 9 h of the reaction, but the selectivity on menthol was close to 100%. The M-to-IsoM equilibrium ratio at this temperature was about 1.80. So, the calculated lnK and ΔG values are 0.588 and –0.61 kcal/mol, correspondingly. Taking into account the related values of the reaction at 250 °C and 350 °C, the ΔH and ΔS values calculated according to equation ΔG = ΔH – TΔS were evaluated for the isomerization in supercritical 2-PrOH. The both values are negative and small: –1.58 kcal/mol (ΔH) and –1.9 cal/(K × mol) (ΔS). It means that the menthone seems to undergo no drastic geometric change during the enolization/isomerization and the process is neither enthalpically nor entropically driven in supercritical alcohols. Any alcohol as a protic polar solvent is a proper reaction environment for ketone enolization including the M-to-IsoM isomerization. It remains to be seen whether this is true also for supercritical conditions since alcohol molecule can participate in the formation of the six-membered cyclic transition state during the keto–enol equilibrium constant may depend on solvent density at supercritical conditions [72,73], as well as on the Kamlet–Taft solvent parameters of the alcohols [67]. Under the non-catalytic THR conditions, these parameters fail to show any correlation with the values of K (Table 1) and the change of M-to-IsoM ratio at zero reaction time (Fig. 3) when the temperature of 350 °C is reached inside the reactor after the start of the heating (∼ 55 min)."
9,Raney® nickel catalyzed THR under subcritical conditions,"3.3 Raney® nickel catalyzed THR under subcritical conditions We compare the observed conversion and selectivity with those of the transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by Raney® nickel under milder subcritical conditions. The last reaction carried out at a much lower temperature seems to be more synthetically simple, remarkably efficient, and effective way to reduce low-reactive ketones like menthone to corresponding alcohols. Earlier, Raney® Ni demonstrated high catalytic efficiency in the TH reduction of ketones by secondary 2-PrOH or 2-BuOH [60]. At the same time, the H-donor activity of primary alcohols (MeOH, EtOH, 1-PrOH) was low enough [61]. To revise the activity of alcohols, the catalytic and non-catalytic THR of menthone need to be compared under the same reaction conditions (at 150 °C for 5 h) using MeOH, EtOH, 1-PrOH, 2-PrOH, 1-BuOH, and 2-BuOH as a hydrogen donor. Under the identical reaction conditions, no menthone conversion was observed for the reaction with primary alcohols (MeOH, EtOH, 1-PrOH, and 1-BuOH) catalyzed by Raney® Ni prepared according to well-known procedure [74] from aluminum–nickel alloy (50:50 wt. %). Only the secondary 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH demonstrated excellent H-donor activity (Fig. 4 ) and selectivity on menthols close to 100%. At the same time, the menthone reduction without Raney® Ni was negligible in all alcohols at 150 °C. Thus, at much lower temperature, difference in the hydrogen-donating properties of the alcohols especially secondary ones is more pronounced than under supercritical conditions at 350 °C. Indeed, the secondary alcohols are the best reaction media and reducing reagents for the base-free THR catalyzed by Raney® Ni. The keto-enol tautomerism of menthone is significant in some alcohols under the catalytic conditions. So, the M-to-IsoM ratio is changed in the range of 30–50 (∼ 97/3 ÷ 98/2 in 1-PrOH) to 1.6–2.6 (∼ 62/38 ÷ 72/28 in 2-PrOH) for 5 h of the reaction. The ratio decreases as follows: 1-PrOH≥1-BuOH > EtOH > MeOH>2-BuOH≥2-PrOH. Interestingly, the calculated M-to-IsoM equilibrium ratio at this temperature is 2.5 (∼ 72/28), i.e., in the presence of Raney® Ni, the menthone isomerization in 2-PrOH reaches the quasi-equilibrium mixture during 3–5 h at 150 °C."
10,Conclusions,"For the first time, the TH reduction of menthone by six supercritical alcohols (primary MeOH, EtOH, 1-PrOH, 1-BuOH and secondary 2-PrOH, 2-BuOH) has been developed under non-catalytic and base-free reaction conditions. Conversion of menthone was up to 69% and selectivity on menthols reached to 99% at 350 °C. Among supercritical alcohols, ethanol demonstrated the best activity, whereas methanol was the worst one. But in subcritical (at 150 °C) secondary 2-PrOH or 2-BuOH, the THR catalyzed by conventional Raney® nickel seems to be a more synthetically useful reduction showing almost 100% conversion and selectivity. Under both sub- and supercritical conditions, the initial ketone undergoes keto-enol tautomerism to form isomenthone which further is reduced to isomeric menthols. Milder reaction conditions in combination with effective, low-cost and non-toxic Raney® nickel render this protocol as an attractive method for reduction of various low-reactive ketones. Further applications of Raney® nickel and aliphatic alcohols in the TH reduction of challenging organic substrates (not only ketones or aldehydes) are currently underway."
