0,Introduction,"Sago commonly known as cassava and tapioca is extracted from Mannihot esculenta, a plant species widely grown in Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines. In India, states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala are the major producers of cassava. During the extraction process of starch from tapioca tubers, 20,000–30,000 L of water per ton of sago is required which eventually produces equal quantity of wastewater that is highly organic, foul smelling and acidic [1]. The cassava starch processing wastewater is a carbohydrate-rich waste with small amounts of cyanide [2]. Cyanide is a well-known metabolic inhibitor and wastewaters containing cyanide cannot be discharged without proper detoxification. Wastewater from tapioca processing factories are high in chemical oxygen demand (COD) up to 25 g L−1 with biodegradable starch containing solids up to 4 g L−1, their pH is low with values in the range 3.8–5.2 [2]. Quite a lot of anaerobic technologies including conventional anaerobic treatment, high rate anaerobic treatment such as anaerobic filters and fluidized bed have been reported to treat the wastewater [3–7]. Nonetheless, owing to its starchy nature the sago-processing wastewater could be an excellent feedstock for production of bioenergy like bioH2, ethanol and butanol. Among all the bioenergy carriers, H2 is highly energetic and clean because of its high energy content (122 kJ g−1), and its burning produces only water as a by-product [8]. The decrease in the fossil fuel resources and increase in the demand for the energy consumption warrants most promising and alternative method of biological H2 production from various organic wastes. Due to the flexibility of dark fermentation for various organic wastes, low temperature and pressure range it is more favorable method of H2 production than any other biological H2 production processes. About 20–60 m3 of wastewater is generated from processing of sago while production of 1 ton of starch in an industry [9]. BioH2 generation from such large quantities of starch wastewater will significantly contribute to alleviate the current demand of clean energy worldwide. Moreover, H2 production via anaerobic fermentation will not only yield bioenergy but will also reduce the COD of the sago-processing wastewater. Therefore, sago-processing wastewater is considered a potential source of renewable biomass to produce bioH2 [10]. The production of bioH2 from starch-containing waste has been reported extensively [10–19]. However, most of the studies have been carried out using starch powder at temperatures above 30 °C. Studies on bioH2 production from real wastewater from sago-processing using mixed cultures are very few [10–12,20]. None of the previous studies focused on the net energy gain from their reported process [10–19], which is extremely important to develop a low energy consumption process of bioH2 production. For successful biological H2 production the overall performance of bacterial communities, i.e., mixed cultures in reactor is critical. In fact, the mixed cultures might provide useful combinations of metabolic pathways for the processing of complex waste material ingredients [21]. In order to develop an energy efficient bioH2 production process from sago-processing wastewater, it is very essential to develop selective mesophilic mixed cultures with optimized process parameters (pH, nutrients, inoculum size, inoculum pretreatment, etc.). In this study heat-treated inoculum able to grow in mesophilic temperature was developed and was further used to produce bioH2 under optimum set of conditions that were experimentally determined. Batch and repeated-batch fermentations were carried out with sago-processing wastewater and the net energy gain was calculated for the process."
1,Material and methods,
2,Characterization of seed inoculum and sago wastewater,"2.1 Characterization of seed inoculum and sago wastewater Fresh cattle dung was used as seed inoculum which was subjected to different pretreatment methods to enrich and develop microbial cultures able to produce bioH2 from sago starch. Total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) of cattle dung were 19.3 ± 1.4% (w/w) and 14.3 ± 0.5% (w/w), respectively. Sago-processing wastewater was obtained from Trimurti Agro processing Ltd., Maharashtra, India. The main characteristics of sago wastewater were as follows: pH 4.6, TS 8.9 ± 0.2 g L−1, VS 1.9 ± 0.03 g L−1, total carbohydrates 0.6 ± 0.03 g L−1 and total COD (TCOD) 11.6 ± 0.8 g L−1. Granular sago starch was procured from local market and ground with blender to get uniform fine sago starch powder. Sago starch powder was oven dried at 105 °C for 24 h prior to use to make it zero moisture. The TCOD of 1% sago starch solution was 10.3 ± 0.36 g L−1."
3,Seed inoculum pretreatment,"2.2 Seed inoculum pretreatment The seed inoculum was subjected to three different pretreatment methods namely, heat (80 °C, 2 h), chemical (Bromoethanesulphonic acid 0.2 g L−1, 24 h) and acid (pH 4, 2.5 N HCl, 24 h). Batch H2 production experiments were conducted in 130 mL serum bottles with working volume 50 mL to study the effect of the pretreatments. Fresh cow dung was weighed equivalent to 5% TS and was taken as the seed inoculum for fermentation. The bottles were incubated at 30 °C for 120 h and gas measurements were carried out at every 24 h interval. The composition of medium used was 1% soluble starch as the sole carbon source, containing the following components NH4HCO3 (5.24 g L−1), MnSO4·6H2O (0.015 g L−1), K2HPO4 (0.125 g L−1), FeSO4·7H2O (0.025 g L−1), MgCl2·6H2O (0.1 g L−1), CuSO4·5H2O (0.005 g L−1), CoCl2·5H2O (0.000125 g L−1), Na2CO3 (6.72 g L−1) with initial pH adjusted to 7.0."
4,Enrichment of H2 producing mixed cultures,"2.3 Enrichment of H2 producing mixed cultures Heat-treated seed inoculum was used to enrich the H2 producing microbial consortium (mixed cultures) from sago starch. Enrichment of H2 producing mixed cultures was conducted in 130 mL serum bottles with 30 mL working volume. The minimal medium containing (NH4)2SO4 (5 g L−1), K2HPO4 (7 g L−1), KH2PO4 (3 g L−1), NaCl (5 g L−1), trace elements (1 mL L−1), resazurin (1 mL L−1), cysteine HCl (0.5 g L−1), peptone (1 g L−1), yeast extract (1 g L−1) and 1% sago starch as a sole carbon source was used for growth and selective enrichment. Composition of trace elements was as follows: nitrilotriacetic acid (45 g L−1), FeCl2·4H2O (4 g L−1), MnCl2·4H2O (1 g L−1), CaCl2 (0.2 g L−1), CoCl2·6H2O (1.7 g L−1), ZnCl2 (1 g L−1), H3BO3 (0.19 g L−1), sodium molybdate (0.1 g L−1). Successive transfers of 48 h grown mixed cultures as inoculum (10%) to fresh growth medium were made to obtain stable H2 producing microbial consortium. The developed mixed cultures were maintained and preserved at 4 °C. In all the fermentation experiments the developed mixed cultures were freshly grown for 48 h and used as the culture inoculum."
5,Fermentation process optimization,"2.4 Fermentation process optimization Batch experiments (I–V) were carried out to optimize the fermentation process of sago starch by mixed cultures in 130 mL serum bottle with 50 mL working volume. Independent experiments in triplicate were conducted to optimize the substrate concentration, pH, peptone-yeast, inoculum size and Fe ions. The bottles were filled with medium as described in Section 2.3. The headspace was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min and sealed with rubber stopper and aluminum seals. Mixed cultures were inoculated into each bottle and incubated for 120 h. Gas measurements were carried out at every 24 h interval. Respective control sets were kept, in order to account for background H2 production. The H2 produced from control was subtracted from test. The experimental design for the optimization is shown in Table 2 ."
6,Batch H2 production with and without inoculum,2.5 Batch H2 production with and without inoculum Batch experiments for the comparison of H2 production with and without inoculum (control) were conducted in 2 L glass reactors with 1 L working volume. The reactor with inoculum was seeded with 10% inoculum and fed with 900 mL sago wastewater while the reactor without inoculum was fed with 1000 mL sago wastewater only. Both set of reactors contained minimal medium components with 0.1% PY. Initial pH of the wastewater was adjusted to pH 7.0 using 10 N NaOH. The headspace was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min and then sealed with rubber stopper and incubated at 30 °C.
7,Repeated-batch H2 production,"2.6 Repeated-batch H2 production Repeated-batch H2 production experiments were conducted in 2 L glass reactors with 1 L working volume. The reactor was initially fed with 900 mL of sago wastewater containing minimal medium components with 0.1% PY. Initial pH of the wastewater was adjusted to pH 7.0. The reactor was seeded with 10% inoculum (enriched mixed cultures). The headspace was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min and then sealed with rubber stopper and incubated at temperature of 30 °C. For repeated-batch mode operation the reactor was fed with half of its working volume every 24 h, i.e. HRT of 2 days. After sampling, fresh feed was added in the reactor. Gas production, H2 content, COD, total suspended solids (TSS), amylase activity, total carbohydrates, VFA and alcohols were analyzed."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods The amount of biogas produced in each bottle was measured by downward water displacement method. The composition of biogas was analyzed using gas chromatograph (Model 3800 Perkin Elmer) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Porapak Q column (SS, 1/8″ × 8′ mesh). The operational temperatures of the injector port, detector and column were 100 °C, 70 °C and 40 °C, respectively. Argon was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. VFA content were analyzed using gas chromatography (Chemito 8610) equipped with flame ionization detector using 10% FFAP, 2% H3PO4, 80/100 mesh column with nitrogen as carrier gas (flow rate 30 mL min−1); with detector and injector temperature as 185 °C and column temperature as 140 °C. The pH, COD, TS, TSS, VS and VSS were determined according to standard procedures in APHA standard methods [22]. Amylase activity was followed according to method of Bernfeld [23]. Total carbohydrate was determined by Anthrone method [24]. H2 gas production was calculated, from headspace measurements and the total volume of biogas produced during each time interval, using the mass balance equation (Eq. (1)) [25]. (1) V H 2 , i = V H 2 , i − 1 + C H 2 , i V w + V G , i C H 2 , i − V G , i − 1 C H 2 , i − 1 where, V H 2 , i and V H 2 , i − 1 are cumulative H2 gas volumes at the current ith and previous (i − 1)th time intervals, respectively, V w is volume of biogas obtained by downward water displacement method. C H 2 , i and C H 2 , i − 1 are the fraction of H2 gas in the headspace of the bottle measured using gas chromatography in the ith and (i − 1)th time interval, respectively. V G,i and V G,i−1 are the volumes of the headspace in the bottle at ith and (i − 1)th time interval."
9,Kinetic and net energy analysis,"2.8 Kinetic and net energy analysis The modified Gompertz equation [26] was used to fit the cumulative H2 production data in each batch. H2 yield and H2 production rate were calculated based on the kinetic parameters obtained from the Eq. (2). (2) H = P · exp { − exp · [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is cumulative H2 production, mL, P is H2 production potential, mL L−1, R m is maximum H2 production rate, mL L−1 h−1, λ is lag phase time, h and t is incubation time, h. Non-linear regression analysis was done using Sigma plot (Version 11). The net energy was calculated following the Eq. (3) [27]. (3) E N = G ρ H 2 ( LHV ) − V ρ w C p ( T f − T a ) VC where E N is the net energy, G is volume of H2 produced (mL), ρ H 2 is density of gaseous H2 (8.9 × 10−5 kg/L), LHV is lower heating value of H2 (120,000 kJ/kg), V is the liquid volume in the reactor (L), ρ w is the density of water (1 kg/L), C p is the specific heat of water (4.187 kJ/kg K) and C is COD of feedstock (g COD/L). In our study T a was 28 °C and T f was 30 °C."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Effect of various inoculum pretreatment methods on bioH2 production,"3.1 Effect of various inoculum pretreatment methods on bioH2 production Three different inoculum pretreatment methods were tested for H2 production and it was found that heat pretreatment showed maximum H2 yield of 323.4 mL g−1 starchadded. Previous findings also suggested that heat pretreatment of inoculum is superior among all other methods [28,29]. Table 1 shows the H2 yields for various inoculum pretreatment methods. The rank of H2 yield upon different pretreatment of inoculum in this study was heat-treatment > acid-treatment > chemical-treatment > control (without-treatment). For acid, chemical and without pretreatment the H2 yields obtained were 255, 223.3 and 110.3 mL g−1 starchadded, respectively. The final pH observed in chemical-treatment and acid-treatment experiments were in neutral range (pH 7) whereas acidic pH was observed in both heat- and control-experiment (pH 4–5). The cumulative H2 production results fitted to modified Gompertz model Eq. (2) are plotted in Fig. 1 . The cumulative H2 produced by heat-treated inoculum was 4.6 times higher than control. However, the lag phase (λ) was longest in heat-treatment experiment than the others, which probably has resulted due to loss of active microorganisms while high temperature exposure leading to selection of only slow growing spore-formers (Clostridium spp.). In fact, most of the microorganisms identified in mixed cultures producing H2 belong to genus Clostridium [12]. Methanogenic activity was completely repressed in all pretreatment methods. The detailed kinetic parameters obtained from fitting cumulative H2 production curve to model Eq. (2) are summarized in Table 1. It was observed that maximum H2 production potential of 3206 mL L−1 was observed in heat-treatment experiment whereas maximum volumetric H2 production rate of 144.5 mL L−1 h−1 was observed in acid-treatment experiment. Owing to the high bioH2 yield observed in this study, the heat-treated inoculum was used to further develop and enrich the H2 producing mixed cultures. VFAs analysis showed acetate and butyrate as the major soluble metabolic products in all the pretreatment experiments (Fig. 2 ). Propionate was produced only in case of chemical- and acid-treatments experiments. The pretreatment experiment showed delayed production of VFAs in case of heat-treatment probably due to metabolic slow down as a result of heat exposure. No such phenomenon was observed in the other pretreatments indicating no effect of either acid or chemical on metabolic activity. Acetate and butyrate found in heat-treatment experiments after 120 h were 1.07 g L−1 and 1.21 g L−1, respectively. Acetate, propionate and butyrate found in chemical-treatment experiment were 1.09, 1.99, 2.38 g L−1, respectively after 120 h. In case of acid-treatment the acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations were 1.02, 1.82, 2.22 g L−1, respectively after 120 h. The control experiment showed more production of acetate (0.72 g L−1) than butyrate (0.48 g L−1) after 120 h. The butyrate/acetate (B/A) ratios were similar in chemical- and acid-treatments and showed butyrate type fermentation in these pretreatments methods (Table 1). Mixed-acid type fermentation was noted in all pretreatment methods including the control experiment. Ren et al. [30] also showed varied types of metabolite production during exposure of sludge to different pretreatment methods as a result of different microbial community dominance. It may be concluded that the production of soluble metabolites depends on the nature of the microorganisms and the type of feedstock."
12,Effect of sago starch concentration and initial pH on batch H2 production,"3.2 Effect of sago starch concentration and initial pH on batch H2 production The effect of various initial sago starch concentrations and initial cultivation pH on batch H2 production showed that the peak H2 yield and production rate were 349.7 mL g−1 starchadded and 77.1 mL L−1 h−1, respectively at initial cultivation pH 7 and 0.5% sago starch concentration (Table 3 ). With the increase in sago starch concentration there was an increase in the cumulative H2 production up to 4% substrate concentration (Fig. 3 ). But, sago starch concentration higher than 4% was found to lower the bioH2 production. In general, higher substrate concentrations could enhance H2 production efficiency, but too high concentration would inhibit the metabolic reaction [31]. The maximum cumulative H2 production of 2697 mL was observed at 4% sago starch concentration in this study (Fig. 3). In fact, there is no specific optimal concentration for the various substrates used in fermentative H2 production [32]. For instance the optimal sucrose concentration for fermentative H2 production reported by Fan et al. [33] was 4.0 g COD/L, while Wu et al. [34] showed high H2 production rate at even 20 g COD/L. These findings could probably be the result of using different inoculums and substrate concentration ranges [35]. VFA analysis showed acetate and butyrate as the major soluble metabolites. VFA results showed that, as substrate concentration increased B/A ratio also increased simultaneously (Table 3). The B/A ratio has been often used as a performance indicator for dark H2 fermentation. The maximum B/A ratio (2.2) was observed at 5% sago starch concentration (Table 3). A close scrutiny of the composition of the soluble metabolites obtained from this work suggests that the mixed cultures carried out metabolic pathways in favor of H2 production, as the soluble metabolites were predominantly butyrate and acetate. VFA observed at 0.5% sago starch concentration were acetate (1.12 g L−1) and butyrate (0.907 g L−1). Furthermore, it was observed that as initial sago starch concentration was increased, the final pH of fermented broth decreased, probably due to accumulation of volatile fatty acids in the medium as also mentioned in literature [35,36]. pH is a fundamental operating parameter for the production of bioH2 [31]. The range of optimum pH reported in literature varied from 4.5 to 7.5 [13,37]. In this study, it was observed that the H2 yield and maximum H2 production rate increased with increasing initial pH from 5 to 7, and then decreased as the pH was further increased to 7.5 (Table 4 ). Similar trend of pH effect on H2 yield is reported in an earlier study [13]. The peak cumulative H2 production of 2157 mL was obtained at pH 7 (Fig. 4 ) with peak H2 production rate of 78.6 mL L−1 h−1. Our results suggest that the initial cultivation pH 7 is favorable for the enriched mixed cultures to produce maximum bioH2. The different pH dependence of H2 production may primarily be attributed to the difference in the dominant bacterial H2 producing bacteria present in the mixed cultures. Initial pH of the medium influenced all the kinetic parameters significantly in this study (Table 4). The maximum H2 yield of 412.6 mL g−1 sago starchadded at pH 7 and 30 °C (Table 4) was higher than earlier reported values [11,13], but slightly lower than the value reported under thermophilic condition (60 °C) [14]. Hasyim et al. [14] reported H2 production with low substrate concentration (2.5 g L−1) which might have yielded slightly higher value than our study where we found 5 g L−1 as the optimum sago starch concentration. Literature shows that high HY is usually associated with lower substrate concentration. It is important to note that our study showed HY nearly 2 fold higher than the earlier study [11] which was carried out at 60 °C. The present HY values are therefore the highest one considering the use of mesophilic temperature (30 °C) and higher sago starch concentration (5 g L−1) and are important for developing low energy consumption H2 production process."
13,"Effect of peptone yeast extracts (PY), inoculum size and Fe ions on batch H2 production","3.3 Effect of peptone yeast extracts (PY), inoculum size and Fe ions on batch H2 production The effect of PY, inoculum size and Fe ions concentration on batch H2 production were investigated to obtain the best nutrient formulation. Addition of PY to the medium seems to be essential for the growth of the mixed cultures. Our results showed some difference in H2 yield obtained with 0.1 g L−1 (350.9 ± 11.5 mL g−1 sago starchadded) and the H2 yield obtained with 1 g L−1 (428.8 ± 8.1 mL g−1 sago starchadded). However, the enhancement in the H2 yield was not very promising looking into the quantity of PY (1%) added. In fact, a previous study [38] reported no significant differences in the gas yield at 1 and 10 g L−1 peptone (at 9–10 g L−1 starch). Furthermore, the results of PY addition study also confirm that PY was not the substrate for H2 production in our experiments. On the other hand a linear increase in the H2 yield was observed when the inoculum size was increased from 5% to 10%. However, further increase in inoculum size (20%) resulted in no increase in H2 yield. Therefore 10% inoculum size was found as optimum inoculum size for maximum H2 yield in this study. No significant effect of Fe ions addition in the fermentation medium was observed in this study. In fact, Nath and Kumar [39] also found only a marginal effect of Fe2+ (at ∼20 mg L−1) on glucose-dependent H2 production by Enterobacter cloacae. This indicate that the iron requirement is defined both by physiological properties of the cultures and by the iron availability in the fermentation medium [35,38]."
14,Batch and repeated-batch H2 production from sago-processing wastewater,"3.4 Batch and repeated-batch H2 production from sago-processing wastewater Batch and repeated-batch reactor studies were conducted to investigate the H2 production from sago-processing wastewater under optimum conditions (initial pH 7, 0.1% PY, minimal medium components, 10% inoculum and 30 °C) obtained in this study. The H2 yield obtained in the experimental set-up was 126.5 mL g−1 COD and 456 mL g−1 starch. During the batch H2 production process the COD removal efficiency achieved was 11.6%, which is usually low in case of dark fermentation since soluble forms of carbon are not completely transformed to CO2 and CH4. The control set-up also showed H2 production, however, it was much less than the experimental set-up. This ascertains the role of developed mixed cultures in the bioH2 production enhancement from sago-processing wastewater at 30 °C. Previous studies have also shown that starch-based feedstock have indigenous microbiota which can perform anaerobic fermentation to produce H2 and ethanol [40]. The results of batch fermentation are summarized in Table 5 . Amylase activity was found to be quite high in the experimental set-up indicating the hydrolytic activity of the developed mixed cultures, which probably have degraded the starch in the wastewater to glucose for fermentation step. At the end of fermentation there was no detectable starch in the medium which shows the complete utilization of the starch content in the wastewater. However, in experimental set-up this led to H2 production, while in the control fermentation the non-specific microbiota might have transformed the starch into other end-products. In the repeated batch experiment with a HRT of 2 days, it was observed that the H2 production ceased after 48 h fermentation (Fig. 5 ). This might be due to the washout of the microorganisms at such high volumetric feeding and removal of the feed. The mixed cultures were probably unable to grow too rapidly to balance the biomass concentration inside the reactor which ultimately led to failure of H2 production after 48 h of operation. Moreover, the system used in this study was a free suspended cells reactor without any immobilization support to retain the free biomass. This finding was in agreement with the study by Chen et al. [41]. In addition, the soluble metabolite production profile during the repeated feeding of the reactor indicated accumulation of propionate and butyrate (Fig. 5). Propionate accumulation also suggests that the anaerobic condition (redox potential) in the reactor was not sufficient enough due to repeated feeding and exposure to air. Moreover, if pH and ORP is not controlled, then it leads to propionate accumulation [42]. Another study reported that propionate production did not generate H2 [43]. Therefore the accumulation of propionate might have caused the failure of H2 production after 48 h of fermentation. However, the COD removal efficiency could be achieved up to 14.6% in 96 h of fermentation period. Propionate, butyrate and acetate were the major volatile fatty acids and ethanol was the major alcohol observed during repeated-batch operation. A comparison of H2 yield observed in the present study with literature on sago-based starch as feedstock is summarized in Table 6 . This study demonstrate that the enriched mixed cultures has significant potential to give more H2 yield at mesophilic conditions as compared to reported H2 yield at thermophilic conditions."
15,Net energy gain analysis,"3.5 Net energy gain analysis The net energy gain analysis for dark fermentation from organic wastes has been reported in recent studies [27,44]. In the present study the net energy was calculated following Eq. (3). A net energy yield of +2.97 kJ g−1 COD was obtained in the present study at the optimum conditions (pH 7.0, 30 °C, sago starch concentration 0.5%) using sago starch powder as the feedstock. However, while using sago-processing wastewater the net energy yield of +0.57 kJ g−1 COD was obtained in batch H2 production. An evaluation of the net energy gain with different temperature range showed that the net energy gain declined with fermentation temperature and was negative when the fermentation temperature exceeded 30 °C [43]. Therefore it is essential to generate high volumetric H2 production at lower temperature, which finally suggests for a highly efficient mesophilic mixed cultures. Table 7 demonstrates the net energy that can be made available from sago-processing wastewater using the developed mesophilic mixed culture in this study. The estimated net energy value of +2.85 × 1013 kJ indicates that sago-processing wastewater can serve as an excellent feedstock for bioenergy production."
16,Conclusions,"The present study evaluated the bioH2 production potential of sago-processing wastewater and the net energy that can be made available to alleviate the current energy demand worldwide. A series of experiments (pretreatment, culture enrichment and process optimization) to obtain maximum H2 yield showed quite higher values compared to literature reports. The results showed that sago-processing wastewater can generate bioH2 in spite of the presence of cyanide, a metabolic inhibitor, with mesophilic mixed cultures as the source of biocatalyst (developed in this study). A cumulative H2 production of 1.34 L L−1 of wastewater was obtained while using mixed cultures at 30 °C. The net energy analysis revealed a positive energy gain from batch production of H2 using wastewater. Lastly, the estimated energy value suggests that sago-processing wastewater can be an excellent feedstock for the future bioenergy industries and can significantly contribute to ease the current and future energy demands."
