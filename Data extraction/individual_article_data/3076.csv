0,Introduction,"The current concern on oil consumption and environmental problems have promoted the use of new energy sources. Hydrogen presents as a promising energy carrier, but challenges remain in the usage of pure hydrogen in IC engines, gas turbines, and boilers [1–3]. Specifically, hydrogen has strong diffusibility, wide flammable range, fast flame speed, and high chemical activity, the above-mentioned properties have led to the concern of combustion control and safety [1–4]. Despite the challenges, hydrogen is still an attractive alternative fuel because it is completely carbon free [2]. A sustainable compromise is to blend the hydrogen with hydrocarbons [5], which does offer the potential to adjust the combustion properties of both hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels, realize the lean burn technology in the combustion appliance, and reduce the carbon footprint. The combustion of hydrogen-enriched methane (natural gas) has been most widely studied from both aspects of the application and fundamental. Indeed, the blending of hydrogen into methane or natural gas contributed to the expansion of operating load limits and the enhancement of thermal efficiency for IC engines [6–9]. Besides, dual-fuel gas turbine operation of hydrogen/natural gas demonstrated that lower carbon and NOx emissions can be achieved simultaneously by using hydrogen-enriched blends to implementing lean-burning [10–12]. To better guide the dual-fuel application, the laminar flame speeds of hydrogen/methane or hydrogen/natural gas have been measured using a variety of apparatus, such as the combustion bomb [13–16], stagnation plane flame [17–19], and heat flux [20]. In addition, the ignition delay times of hydrogen and methane combined fuel have been comprehensively studied via shock tubes [21–23] and rapid compression machines [24,25]. The above-mentioned studies show that hydrogen addition can intensify the methane laminar flame by increasing the H radical concentration in the reaction zone and preheat zone. Similarly, the ignition delay time of methane can be reduced by hydrogen addition under different temperatures due to the accelerated accumulation of free radicals. The use of hydrogen-doped blends was identified as an interim towards the long-term transformation of the “hydrogen economy” [12]. On this account, a growing body of research has been conducted to better understand the combustion property of hydrogen-enriched larger molecular transportation fuels. Some studies report on the combustion and emission characteristics of hydrogen-enriched alcohol fuels [26–29], gasoline [30–33], diesel [34–36], etc. in engine applications. The ignition delay time is the important fundamental data for the design of combustion devices such as engines and gas turbines, furthermore, it is the benchmark data for the validation of chemical kinetic models. However, fundamental understanding of the ignition delay characteristics of hydrogen blended larger hydrocarbons is far from comprehensive, only a few researchers have studied the ignition delays of hydrogen blending with DME [37,38], ethane [39,40], propane [41,42], and butane [43–45]. n-Pentane is an n-paraffin composed of five carbon atoms that exist within practical fuels [46] and petroleum feed-stocks [47]. It is considered as the representative component of surrogates or primary reference fuels (PRFs) [48,49], for which several studies took n-pentane directly as the simulated gasoline [50,51]. Being in the transition position between gaseous and liquid alkanes [52], the reaction pathway of n-pentane can be analogous to larger hydrocarbons to offer substantial insights into the oxidation kinetics [53]. For these reasons, the ignition delay times of n-pentane have been measured using rapid compression machines by Westbrook et al. [54], Ribaucour et al. [55], Piehl et al. [53], and Bugler et al. [56], it is found that n-pentane gives the two-stage ignition property under low to intermediate temperatures, the first stage ignition is closely related to the alkylperoxy isomerization. Shock tube studies focusing on the high temperature ignition delays of n-pentane were also reported by different research groups [52,56–58] from atmospheric pressure to 530 atm, and equivalence ratios from 0.3 to 2.0. In order to guide the application of hydrogen-enriched combustion, it is necessary to study the ignition delays of n-pentane/ hydrogen mixtures. Chemical interaction between binary fuel derivatives may happen under engine-relevant conditions and act on the combustion properties. Mehl and co-workers [59] found that in the kinetic model of multiple gasoline surrogate components, it is necessary to consider the inter-reaction between alkyl and alkyl-peroxy to capture the combustion characteristics. However, the influence of hydrogen blending on the ignition delays of n-pentane at various equivalence ratios is not clear. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to conduct ignition delay measurements of n-pentane/hydrogen blends from lean to rich conditions (equivalence ratio of 0.5 to 2.0) and at engine-relevant high pressure (20 atm) using a shock tube. The measured ignition delay data are used to validate the capability of the available kinetic model and identify any crucial reactions for the dual-fuel ignition chemistry. The second objective is to investigate the equivalence ratio dependence characteristics for n-pentane/hydrogen blends at different degrees of hydrogen doping. Finally, the effect of hydrogen blending on the high temperature ignition behavior of n-pentane will be compared with that of methane to see whether hydrogen blending has any generalized effect on large and small n-alkanes."
1,Experimental and numerical approaches,
2,Shock tube device,"2.1 Shock tube device The present measurements are conducted in a stainless steel shock tube of 11.5 cm internal diameter. The specifications of this shock tube are described in detail in Ref. [23]. In simple terms, as shown in Fig. 1 , the shock tube has a 2 m high pressure driver section and a 7.3 m low pressure driven section divided by double polyethylene terephthalate (PET) diaphragms. Four PCB 113B26 pressure sensors are installed along the end of the driven section at equal spacing. Fluke PM 6690 time counters are used to measure the time interval between the shock wave reaching each pressure sensor to determine the shock wave velocity. The pressure and CH* emission signal at the shock tube endwall are recorded by the Hamamatsu CR 131 photomultiplier and PCB 113B03 pressure sensor, respectively. The ignition delay is defined as the time from the arrival of the incident shock wave (t = 0) until the extrapolation of the maximum slope of CH* emission trace to the baseline, as shown in Fig. 2 . The typical attenuation rates of the incident shock of this shock tube is dP/dt = 4.2%/ms [23]. The experimental uncertainty of the measured ignition delay time is ±20% assessed according to the references [23]."
3,Preparation of test mixture,"2.2 Preparation of test mixture Test mixtures are prepared based on the Dalton partial pressure law in a stainless steel tank of 128 L in volume and sit for more than 12 h. The “air” in this paper is a mixture of oxygen and argon in the molar ratio of 21:79. The ignition delay times of the argon-diluted (fixed dilution ratio of 80%) n-pentane/hydrogen/ “air” blends were measured at the equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The test mixture conditions are shown in Table1 . The purities of the reactants in this study are higher than 99.999%."
4,Kinetic simulations and model validation,"2.3 Kinetic simulations and model validation The simulations of the ignition delay time in the shock tube were performed using the 0-D constant volume and adiabatic solver in the Chemkin Pro software [60]. The non-ideal pressure rise ratio (dP/dt = 4.2%/ms) of the shock tube is considered in numerical modelling using the SENKIN/VTIM method [61]. The Pentane Isomers Model developed by Bugler et al. [56,62,63] in the NUI Galway is used for the simulation in this study. This model consists of 697 species and 3216 reactions. Both the chemical kinetics and thermodynamics of n-pentane, iso-pentane and neo-pentane in this model are well developed [63] and been validated by both the macroscopic ignition delay data of the pentane isomers in shock tube and rapid compression machine [56], as well as the microscopic JSR data [62]. Therefore, one of the objectives of this study is to evaluate the chemical kinetics for the oxidation of n-pentane/hydrogen binary mixtures of this model through experiments. A proper kinetic model of dual-fuel ignition must first be able to accurately predict the ignition behavior of single components. The hydrogen chemical kinetics play a significant role and been considered as the prerequisite and foundation in the model development for all hydrocarbon fuels since the oxidation of which involving the combustion chemistry and some crucial elementary reactions of H, O, OH, HO2, etc [64]. As it is important, extensively studies of hydrogen ignition delay properties have been reported in the literature. The Pentane Isomer Model was developed based on the widely recognized hydrogen base-mechanism proposed by the NUI Galway, the performance of this hydrogen sub-model has previously been validated against the ignition delay time pure hydrogen and hydrogen-containing mixtures in the references [23,44,65–67]. Moreover, Hu et al. [65] recently did comprehensive measurements on the ignition delay times of argon diluted hydrogen using a shock tube from low to high pressure (1.2 to 16 atm) and lean to rich conditions (equivalence ratios of 0.5–2.0) with the similar test mixture composition as that in this study. They considered the influence of residual H-atom to guarantees the reliability of the data and evaluated the predictive performance of hydrogen ignition for many literature models. The Pentane Isomer Model was validated against the hydrogen ignition delay of Hu et al. [65], the measurements and simulations show good agreement (see the supporting material) indicating that the Pentane Isomer Model is able to capture the high temperature ignition delay time of hydrogen from low to high pressures, and lean to rich conditions. Note that the Pentane Isomer Model can also well capture the ignition delay times of pure n-pentane and n-pentane/hydrogen binary mixtures in this study, as shown in Fig. 3 . Therefore, this model was used in this study to calculate the ignition delays of hydrogen, n-pentane, and their binary mixture, as well as to conduct relevant kinetic analyses."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of equivalence ratio,"3.1 Effect of equivalence ratio Fig. 3 (a)–(e) gives both the experimental measurements and numerical simulations for the equivalence ratio dependence of the ignition delay time for various n-pentane/hydrogen mixtures at 20 atm. In Fig. 3 (a), the auto-ignition delays for pure n-pentane at the equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 were compared, wherein the highest reactivity was observed for the fuel-lean mixture, followed by the fuel-stoichiometric mixture, and the fuel-rich mixture gives the lowest reactivity. Such an equivalence ratio dependence characteristic is consistent with the previous observation by Bugler et al. [56] for the ignition behavior of n-pentane/air mixtures, as well as the high temperature ignition of most alkanes [68]. It is found that the chain-branching reaction H + O2 ⇔ O + OH is always the most sensitive promoting reactions during the high temperature ignition of n-alkanes [56,68], the rate of which is relevant to the concentration of the H radical and oxygen. On the one hand, the oxygen concentration in the reaction system reduces with the increase of the equivalence ratio. On the other hand, RH + H ⇔ R + H2 is the main oxidation path of n-pentane at high temperatures [56], the increase of equivalence ratio lead to more effective competition for H atom via RH + H ⇔ R + H2 and the less pronounced chain-branching of H + O2 ⇔ O + OH. As a result, the ignition delay time of the n-pentane becomes even longer with the increasing equivalence ratio. Also, note that in Fig. 3 (a), a convergence of both the measured and simulated ignition delays for n-pentane of each equivalence ratios occurs at about 1150 K and 20 atm indicating that the effect of equivalence ratio becomes lessens as the temperature decreases in the current conditions. This phenomenon is due to the gradually important role of fuel radicals in the oxidation of n-pentane at intermediate to low temperatures, wherein the reaction RH + HO2 ⇔ R + H2O2 provides the consequent chain-branching sequence [56]. As shown in Fig. 3 (e), the simulated ignition delay times of pure hydrogen are identical at high temperatures above 1190 K indicating the approximate reactivity at different equivalent ratios, this trend is consistent with previous literature experiments [41,69] (The predictions of the Pentane Isomer Model and the above literature data also show good agreements, gives in the supporting materials). For the high temperature ignition of hydrogen, besides H + O2 ⇔ O + OH, the hydrogen-relevant reactions O + H2 ⇔ H + OH and OH + H2 ⇔ H + H2O are also the important chain reaction channels [68]. The increase of the equivalence ratio will inevitably decrease the oxygen concentration and restrain the reaction H + O2 ⇔ O + OH, however, the following chain sequence of O + H2 ⇔ H + OH and OH + H2 ⇔ H + H2O become more frequent with the increase of hydrogen concentration. As a result, the hydrogen ignition delays yield weak equivalence ratio dependence at high temperatures. However, as the temperature decreases, the fuel-rich hydrogen mixtures ignite slightly faster than the fuel-stoichiometric and the fuel-lean mixtures give the longest ignition delay times. With the decrease of temperature, H + O2 ⇔ O + OH is not that favored because it is an endothermic reaction with high activation energy [70]. Meanwhile, its competing chain-termination reaction H + O2 + M ⇔ HO2 + M consumes much of the H and O2 [22], therefore, the higher oxygen concentration in the fuel-lean mixture has a slight decelerating effect on the ignition at the moment. It is interesting to notice that the ignition delay times of all the n-pentane/hydrogen mixtures in this study show the equivalence ratio dependence similar to n-pentane indicating the n-pentane chemistry gives the obvious effect on the ignition chemistry after fuel blending, as shown in Fig. 3 (b)–(d). This point of view is further supported by the following sensitivity analysis. The brute force sensitivity analysis for the P5H95 mixtures is performed at 1300 K, 20 atm, and various equivalence ratios in Fig. 4 to identify the most sensitive reactions affecting the ignition delay of the binary fuels. The sensitivity coefficient is defined as S = log (τ (2ki)/τ (0.5ki))/log(2/0.5), where τ is the ignition delay time, ki is the rate coefficient of specific reactions. Note that the H-atom abstractions of n-pentane compete for H radicals and lead to the inhibited chain-branching through H + O2 ⇔ O + OH thus increase the ignition delay time, while the decomposition of n-pentane is the sensitive ignition promoting reaction in the current condition. With only 5% n-pentane blending, some reactions relevant to the carbon-based compounds show the high sensitivity coefficients, those reactions compete for free radicals with the oxidation reactions of hydrogen, leading to the n-pentane-like ignition behavior and equivalence ratio dependence for the n-pentane/hydrogen mixtures."
7,Effect of hydrogen on n-pentane reactivity,"3.2 Effect of hydrogen on n-pentane reactivity In Fig. 5 , the ignition delay times of n-pentane blended with hydrogen are compared under different equivalence ratios. It is seen that under each equivalence ratio, the ignition delay times always decrease with the increasing hydrogen ratio due to the higher reactivity and shorter ignition delay times of hydrogen relative to n-pentane. The similar effects of hydrogen blending on the ignition delays of other n-alkanes are reported in the previous studies [22,23,41–43] illustrate that for a general binary n-alkane/hydrogen system, the increase of hydrogen blending can always promote the reactivity and lead to shorter ignition delay times. In addition, the influence of hydrogen blending under different equivalence ratios are similar, indicating the change of equivalence ratio does not alter the impact of fuel blending under the current conditions. To interpret the influence of hydrogen blending on the reactivity of n-pentane, reaction pathway analysis is performed at 1300 K, 20 atm, and ϕ = 1.0. It is observed in Fig. 6 that under the current conditions, the oxidation of pure n-pentane mainly proceeds through the uni-molecular decomposition and the H-atom abstraction. Most of the n-pentane decomposed to produce NC3H7 (17.7%) followed by β- scission to yield C3H6 and C2H4, a small amount (1.7%) of the fuel also generates PC4H9 and CH3 via the decomposition pathway. Indeed, the vast majority of n-pentane consumed via H-atom abstraction to produce C5H11-1(22.6%), C5H11-2 (38.8%), and C5H11-3 (17.1%), respectively. Those fuel radicals then mostly proceed via the following β-scission reactions. Such an observation for the high temperature reaction pathway has previously been confirmed by the experimental and theoretical studies of n-pentane [56,63]. Note that the reaction pathway indicates that n-pentane reacts independently from the hydrogen after blending, following almost the same pathway as that for the pure n-pentane. In other words, there is no inter-reaction between n-pentane/fuel radicals and hydrogen in the current conditions. It is found that the addition of hydrogen slightly accelerates the H-atom abstractions of n-pentane, especially promotes that by the H radicals due to the presence of the higher H radical concentration after hydrogen blending. In a previous work, Man et al. [42] examined the ignition delay properties of propane/hydrogen mixtures and conclude that hydrogen addition results in the promoted reaction pathways via C3H8 + H ⇔ H2 + nC3H7, and C3H8 + H ⇔ H2 + iC3H7 during the oxidation. In another related work [23], it is observed that adding hydrogen into methane can accelerate the production and consumption of H radical during the oxidization thus contribute to the total reaction rate. Hence, in agreement with previous studies, we conclude that the high temperature reactivity of alkane can be promoted by the introduced H radical from hydrogen after blending."
8,Effects of hydrogen blending on the auto-ignition of methane and n-pentane,"3.3 Effects of hydrogen blending on the auto-ignition of methane and n-pentane Methane is the representative of small alkane, while n-pentane represents for large alkane, the effects of hydrogen addition on ignition delay of large and small alkanes are compared in this study. Fig. 7 gives the computed effect of hydrogen mole fraction on the ignition delays for the stoichiometric methane and n-pentane at 20 atm, 1300 K. It is seen from Fig. 7 that the ignition delay time of methane reduces by about 67% with 20% hydrogen addition, while reduces by about 89% when further increase the hydrogen fraction to 40%. This tendency is consistent with previous experiments in the literature [23] indicating a small amount of hydrogen addition can effectively promote the ignition delay of methane. However, for n-penatne, the ignition delay is reduced by less than 7% with 40% hydrogen blending, obvious reduction in ignition delay is observed only with higher hydrogen ratios. Such an effect of hydrogen addition to n-pentane was also found much alike to that for propane and butane in the literature [41,42,44], indicating the influence of hydrogen on the high temperature ignition of C3–C5 n-alkanes are similar. To understand the reactivity of methane and n-pentane blended with hydrogen, the normalized H radical rate of consumption for pure hydrogen, 20% hydrogen/80%methane, 20%hydrogen/80%n-pentane, 60% hydrogen/40%methane, and 60% hydrogen/40% n-pentane mixtures are analyzed. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the H radicals are mainly consumed via the competing pathways of H + O2 ⇔ O + OH (R1) and H + O2 (+M) ⇔ HO2 (+M) (R9), H + O2 (+AR) ⇔ HO2 (+AR) (R10) during the ignition of pure hydrogen. (R1) is well known as the key chain-branching step of the radical chain process for the high temperature oxidation of both hydrogen and alkanes, while the three-body reactions (R9) and (R10) are the chain-termination steps of hydrogen ignition [22]. For the high temperature oxidation of pure methane, the initial generation of the radical pool is governed by CH4 + O2 ⇔ CH3 + HO2 [70]. Because the above-mentioned reaction for methane is slower relative to the rates of the similar type reactions or decomposition reaction for larger alkanes, the ignition delay time of methane is longer in comparison to higher-order alkanes [71]. Note that after hydrogen addition, shown in Fig. 8 (b), (R129) account for more than 40% of the total H radical rate of consumption at the initial stage of ignition indicates that the auto-ignition of methane is promoted by hydrogen. That is to say, once hydrogen is added to methane, the fast-reacting hydrogen produces H radical to promote the initial consumption of methane via CH4 + H ⇔ CH3 + H2 thus contribute to the development of the radical pool. Also note that for the ignition of 20%hydrogen/80%methane mixture, the reaction system is influenced by the hydrogen chemistry since most of the H radicals are still consumed by the reaction channels of hydrogen oxidation via (R1), (R9), and (R10). For the 20%hydrogen/80%n-pentane mixture, shown in Fig. 8 (c), the H radical consumption is governed by the H-atom abstraction reactions of n-pentane which show higher consumption rates relative to that via (R1), (R9), and (R10) during the early inducing time, that is to say, the n-pentane chemistry plays a dominant role in the dual-fuel reaction system. This is reasonable because it is easier to cross the lower activation barrier than the higher one when chemical reactions occur. The lower activation barriers of the H-atom abstractions of n-pentane (R2312), (R2313), and (R2314) allow the relevant chain-branching to happen more quickly than that from the reaction (R1), therefore (R1) is less competitive for the H radicals relative to the n-pentane H-atom abstractions in the dual-fuel system. When further increase the hydrogen ratio to 60%, as shown in Fig. 8 (d) and (e), the normalized H radical rate of consumption shows similar properties to the 20% hydrogen ratio cases, indicating the similar dominant reactions in consuming the H radicals. In general, the reasons why 20% hydrogen blending can obviously promote the ignition of methane but has an unremarkable effect on the ignition of n-pentane are as follows: (1) Hydrogen addition provides the alternative path via CH4 + H ⇔ CH3 + H2 besides the initial radical production reaction of pure methane (CH4 + O2 ⇔ CH3 + HO2) thus promotes methane oxidation. In addition, hydrogen itself ignites much faster than methane, besides, most of the H radicals in the dual-fuel system are consumed along the oxidation pathway of hydrogen, so the reactivity is improved greatly after fuel blending. (2) Although hydrogen ignites much faster than n-pentane, the ignition of the n-pentane/hydrogen mixture is dominated by n-pentane chemistry. That is, the H radical consumption rate via hydrogen oxidation path reduces significantly due to the radical competition, and the H radicals in the system are mostly supplied to the n-pentane H-abstractions, the above reasons result in a less significant ignition promotion effect of hydrogen addition."
9,Conclusions,"The ignition delay time of pure n-pentane and n-pentane/hydrogen blends were measured using a shock tube under engine relevant pressure. The predictions of the Pentane Isomer Model developed by NUI Galway show good agreement with the n-pentane/hydrogen ignition delay data. It is interesting to notice that the ignition delay times of all the n-pentane/hydrogen mixtures in this study show the equivalence ratio dependence similar to pure n-pentane indicating the ignition delays of the binary mixtures are dominated by n-pentane chemistry after blending. The reaction pathway indicates that n-pentane reacts independently from the hydrogen after blending. Simulation and kinetic analysis indicate that 20% Hydrogen addition only gives the moderate promotion on n-pentane ignition since the H radicals in the dual-fuel system were mostly supplied to the n-pentane H-abstractions and the oxidation chemistry hydrogen is inhibited after blending. Methane ignition delay can be obviously accelerated by 20% hydrogen addition, it is found that the competitive effect of methane on H radical is weak and hydrogen addition can promote methane oxidation by activating the initial radical production via CH4 + H ⇔ CH3 + H2."
