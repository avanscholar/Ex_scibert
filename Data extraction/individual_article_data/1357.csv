0,Introduction,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are promising energy-generation devices for converting chemical energy into electricity with higher efficiency than conventional heat-engine plants [1]. SOFC normally operates at high temperature from 500 to 1000 °C and direct utilizes hydrogen [2], gaseous carbonaceous fuels [3] and liquid alcohols like methanol [4] and ethanol [5]. Hydrogen fuel is an ideal candidate for SOFC, but the major obstacle to the widespread use of hydrogen in fuel cells lies in the premature infrastructure for the storage and distribution of the hydrogen fuel [6],i.e. utilizing hydrocarbons to generate electricity has been drawn great attention to commercialization because of their easier storage and distribution than H2 [7]. Over the last few decades, there has been a steadily growing demand for the biomass hydrocarbon due to climate change [8]. The efficient utilization of energy from biomass is one of the most important ways to achieve carbon neutrality [9]. Liquid methanol and ethanol can be produced directly from renewable biomass and solar energy and have been considered as the most promising fuel for commercial utilization at ambient pressure [10]. Within the anode, the ethanol fuel reforming produces small molecules, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen, to reduce the complexity of the prior fuel processing systems [11]. Albeit ethanol conversion is thermodynamically high at typical working temperatures of SOFC [12], there are still various issues to be tackled regarding the coke deposition on the anode side as the insufficient cleavage of C-C bond in the C2 fuel favors the carbon deposition reaction [13]. The state-of-the-art nickel cermet anode for SOFC is efficient in H2 oxidation but is unstable in carbonaceous fuel as a result of coking, and thus various oxide anode structures and materials of an SOFC were designed to combine the cracking of molecules and the electricity generation [14]. For example, rational structure design strategies including the integration of a porous electrolyte [15] and hierarchically porous anode [16–17] has been employed to boost the coke resistance of the cells. Compared with Ni(O) cermet, perovskite oxide with a nominal formula ABO3 (A = rare-earth or alkaline-elements, B = transition elements) is much better at suppressing coking and carbon deposition [18], and makes it possible to utilize in symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell (SSOFC) with identical cathode and anode which could solve the problems of coking and sulfur poisoning by switching between the anode and cathode [19]. Metal particles on the surface of oxide anode was employed to enhance the performance for fuel internal oxidation: a small amount of Ni particles exhibiting high C–C cleavage activity under ethanol fuel can be used for production of CO or H2 [20], while the accumulated carbon on the anode can be removed in the re-oxidation of the anode since the volumetric expansion of dispersed Ni0 on oxide during the re-oxidation was too minor to cause the failure of the stack [21]. The oxide anode can be metallized through ionic impregnation [22], the exsolution of metal or alloy particles of reducible cations, such as Co2+, Pt2+ and Ru4+ from oxide anodes, upon exposure to fuel, was able to yield well-dispersed metallic nano-particles for more active sites [23]. Moreover, the carbon formation can be suppressed by decreasing the size of the metals or alloys: e.g. metal particles smaller than 7 nm or Ni alloying with Fe [24], Sn [25]and Co [26] were found to reduce the coke deposition during the steam reforming of ethanol. Although the well-designed oxide/metal composite anode can be used to withstand the coking process to some extent, the final oxidation of the fuel/coke requires the oxygen from the cathode to complete the reaction cycle in a long-term operation. Here, we demonstrate how compositing a ferrite perovskite based on SrFeO3 with an appropriately with Ni2+ doping on the B site and excessive Ce4+ on the A site was reduced to drive the superficial exsolution of Fe-Ni alloy as co-catalyst and makes it possible to tune the overall coke deposition of the anode electrode and to mediate, or even fully eliminate. The dynamic situation of coke deposition under different environment is also known to demonstrate the coke behavior upon heating over a certain range of temperatures. Ce0.2Sr0.8Fe0.95Ni0.05O3 perovskite oxide as electrode ( Scheme 1 ) was pre-reduced and the interaction between the electrode with combined metal/CeO2 particles and ethanol was subjected to carbon deposition and anode decomposition under an open circuit voltage condition, while a continuous electricity output with decent electrode stability could be maintained at 0.5 V or o.7 V under an SOFC mode. This work provides significant insights into the design and operation of a long-term operating with controllable coke deposition alcohol-fueled SOFC with ferrite electrode for both cathode and anode."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation SrFeO3 (SF), Ce0.1Sr0.9FeO3 (Ce10SF), Ce0.15Sr0.85FeO3 (Ce15SF), Ce0.2Sr0.8FeO3 (Ce20SF), SrFe0.95Ni0.05O3 (SFN), Ce0.1Sr0.9Fe0.95Ni0.05O3 (Ce10SFN), Ce0.15Sr0.85Fe0.95Ni0.05O3 (Ce15SFN), and Ce0.2Sr0.8Fe0.95Ni0.05O3 (Ce20SFN) were prepared by a combustion method. Precursors with stoichiometric ratios of Ce(NO3)3·9H2O (99.9%, Macklin, China), SrCO3 (99.9%, Macklin, China), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99.9%, Aladdin, China) and NiC4H6O4·9H2O (99.9%, Macklin, China) were dissolved in de-ionized water where equal molar citric acid (CA) to the cations was added. The solution was constantly stirred until they were gel states and calcined at 600 and 1250 °C for 5 h."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystal phases were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a monochromated Persee XD-3 diffractometer with a Cu cathode (Kα1 = 1.5406 Å). Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses in Ar-5% H2 were carried out on 25 mg sample under flowing (25 mL min−1) Ar-5% H2 or synthetic air (TG209 F3 tarsus, NETZSCH, Germany). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the oxidized and carbonized samples under ethanol vapor were performed on a chemisorption device (VDSorb-9li, Vodo, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector in the temperature range from 30 to 900 °C (10 °C min−1) in a flow (15 sccm) of Ar-5% H2 and synthetic air for H2-TPR and TPO, respectively. The H2 consumption was calibrated against that of 0.005 g CuO. The electrical conductivity was measured using a high-accuracy multi-meter (Keithley 2100, USA) using the four-probe method in flowing (30 mL min−1) air during the heating and Ar-5% H2 during the cooling. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of Ce20SF and Ce20SFN was measured on a dilatometer (PCY–1400II, Xiangtan, China) during the heating in air and Ar-5% H2 in the temperature range from 25 to 800 °C. The length of the bar for TEC was around 20 mm and the ramp rate of heating was 5 °C min−1. 100 mg of the as-prepared or reduced Ce20SFN was filled in a U-tube using quartz wool to make a bad. The ethanol reforming process was carried out heating from 20 to 800 °C with a flowing Ar bubbled through H2O and ethanol at 25 °C to achieve a gas mixture containing 2.5 vol% H2O and 1 vol% ethanol vapor, respectively. The efflux in ethanol reforming and TGA was analyzed a HIDEN QIC-20 instrument for the H2 and CO2 concentration at m/e = 2 and 44, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W Al Kα radiation. The morphologies were examined using SEM (ZEISS SUPRA 55) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Bruker)."
4,Electrochemical measurement,"2.3 Electrochemical measurement Ce20SF and Ce20SFN powders were refined by ball-milling and then mixed with a vehicle containing polyvinyl butyral in terpineol to prepare a slurry that would be painted onto both surfaces of an La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ (LSGM) disk (10 mm in diameter, 0.3 mm in thickness). The green film was dried at 80 °C and then calcined at 1100 °C for 2 h. Ag containing 20 wt% starch was also painted on the surface of both electrodes to collect the current over an active area of 0.15–0.2 cm2. The anode was reduced in Ar-5% H2 for 2 h before the introduction of alcohol fuel to the anode while the cathode was exposed to ambient air. A flowing Ar (30 mL min−1) bubbled through C2H5OH or CH3OH liquid carried the fuel into the anode chamber and the actual flow rate of fuel was calculated based on the saturation vapor pressure. The current density–voltage (I-V) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) of the symmetrical cell were measured in the frequency range of 0.1–1 MHz with a sinewave of 10 mV."
5,Results,
6,Ceria doping and metal exsolution,"3.1 Ceria doping and metal exsolution Ce10SFN showed a monophasic perovskite similar to SFN ( Fig. 1 (a)), while Ce15SFN and Ce20SFN maintained perovskite phases with minor CeO2. A good chemical compatibility (( Figure S1 )) was found between LSGM and Ce20SFN according to the XRD of their admixture calcined at 1100 °C in air. According to the XRDs ( Fig. 1 (b)), SFN decomposed to Sr2Fe2O5 structure after the reduction in 5% H2 at 800 °C, while Ce doped samples maintained the perovskite structure. The reduction process in 5% H2 enlarged the cell volume of Ce20SFN and Ce15SFN (Table S1) expanded by 4.2% and 4.8% and drove the exsolution of FeNi3 phase as a result of Ni doping since no metal exsolution was found in Ce20SF ( Figure S2 ). The CeO2 peak for Ce20SFN ( Fig. 1 (c)) in oxygenated state located at 28.72°, but after the reduction it shifted to higher angle at 28.54° as a result of the cell expansion from 4.8485 Å to 4.8828 Å. The shift of CeO2 peak after reduction could be related to the transition from Ce4+ to Ce3+. The relative peak intensity of CeO2 increased after the reduction, which could be related to the exsolution of FeNi3 alloy ( Fig. 1 (d)) that increased the A/B ratio in the perovskite. SEMs of Ce20SFN and Ce20SFN-R ( Fig. 1 (e, f)) confirmed that FeNi3 nanoparticles of 100 nm in diameter (a population density of 27 μm−2) socketed homogeneously on the surface. The Fe-Ni alloy on the surface was found to be produced in the sequential exsolution and alloying process and was facilitated by the partial Ni on the Fe site of the perovskite [27]. Ce10SFN without superficial CeO2 showed the lowest weight loss amongst the four samples ( Fig. 2 (a)). The dTG peaks at 270 °C of SFN and Ce10SFN could be related to the transition of Ni3+ to Ni2+ and the absence of this peak in Ce15SFN and Ce20SFN indicated that Ni was in a divalent state as a result of Ce4+ doping [28]. The two emerged TPR peaks ( Fig. 2 (b)) located from 400 °C to 600 °C represented the transition from Fe4+ to Fe3+ in perovskite-type structure [29] and the peak at 790 °C could be ascribed to the production of Fe2+ along with the exsolution of Fe-Ni alloy. Because ceria showed a TPR peak at a temperature higher than 800 °C ( Figure S3 ), the increased Ce4+ content in Ce10SFN, Ce15SFN and Ce20SFN could decrease the Fe4+ content in the initial oxides for the charge neutrality [30–31]. However, Ce15SFN and Ce20SFN with ceria exsolution showed higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) than Ce10SFN in terms of H2 consumption and weight loss in 5% H2 ( Fig. 2 (c)). Higher Ce4+ doping in Ce15SFN and Ce20SFN could increase the initial oxygen content in the as-prepared perovskite or the oxide-ion conduction in the perovskite as can be seen from their higher H2 consumption below 500 °C than Ce10SFN. The electrical conductivity ( Fig. 2 (d)), σ, of SFN, Ce10SFN, Ce15SFN and Ce20SFN showed a semiconducting behavior in 5% H2, indicating that the oxides rather than the exsolved alloy were responsible for the electric conductivity. The σ of Ce10SFN (0.74 S cm−1), Ce15SFN (0.68 S cm−1) and Ce20SFN (0.42 S cm−1) at 800 °C were much higher than undoped SFN (0.23 S cm−1) as Ce4+ doping increased the stability the structure during reduction [32–34]. The isothermal conductivity ( Figure S4 ) of Ce10SFN, Ce15SFN and Ce20SFN at 800 °C showed a valley with time as a result of the conductivity transition from p-type conductivity for Fe4+/3+ to n-type for Fe3+/2+ [35]. TEC ( Fig. 2 (e)) of Ce20SFN in air was 17.81 ppm K−1, which was smaller than SrFeO3 (40.80 ppm K−1) and SrFe0.8Mo0.2O3 (25.70 ppm K−1) [36]. The TEC of the reduced Ce20SFN increased to 21.03 ppm K−1, which was higher than Ce20SF in hydrogen (16.13 ppm K−1)."
7,H2 evolution under steam reforming,"3.2 H2 evolution under steam reforming The ethanol steam reforming involved several competing reactions dependent on temperature and pressure. Dehydrogenation of ethanol was confined mainly to the temperature range below 400 °C for the product acetaldehyde, H2, and small amounts of CO and CH4. Ce20SFN-R with Fe-Ni alloy ( Fig. 3 (a)) showed a lower starting temperature than Ce20SFN for the production of H2. On the other hand, the ethanol and hydrocarbons reforming was predominant above 400 °C for the production of more H2 and CO [37]. The exsolved CeO2 with higher oxygen mobility favored the reforming of hydrocarbon with steam, leading to maximization of hydrogen production. The further increase in temperature (above 600 °C) could decrease the H2 concentration as a result of the reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWSR) [38]. Ce20SFN and Ce20SFN-R after ethanol reforming with water both remained mostly as perovskite ( Fig. 3 (b)), but the former showed a minor SrCO3 phase because of the redundant accumulation of acetaldehyde on the surface causing the decomposition of perovskite due to the carburizing process. Carbon formation seemed to be unavoidable for most hydrocarbon fuels in the temperature ranges between 20 and 800 °C [39]. Although Ce20SF and Ce20SFN were stable in H2 at 800 °C, the oxygen partial pressure may not be the only parameter for the decomposition and reduction process. Since carbon deposition was possible and according to the Fe-C-O phase diagram ( Figure S5 ), the trace deposition of C at the beginning would induce the formation of FeCx at an oxygen partial pressure (P(O2)) higher than that for the production of Fe0. The formation of carbides was found to be efficient in catalyzing the further deposition of carbon. In order to study the effect of surface variation on the carbon deposition under ethanol vapor, Ce20SF(N) with or without the prior reduction annealed under ethanol vapor for 5 h showed decomposition in ethanol vapor at 800 °C according to the XRDs ( Fig. 4 (a)): i.e., the perovskite oxide with or without prior reduction decomposed completely into Fe0 along with some Sr2CeO4, CeO2, SrCO3, C and FeCx. The deposition of C or formation of FeCx can be confirmed by the re-oxidation of the residue during the TPO measurement ( Fig. 4 (b)). The TPO signals below 100 °C could be related to the loss of absorbed water or ethanol as weight loss was shown in the TG ( Fig. 4 (c)). The peak at 500 °C could be assigned to the FeCx oxidization (∼500 °C) because more oxygen was consumed than the released CO2, whereas the one at 600 °C corresponded to the oxidation of carbonaceous material (∼600 °C) for the production of large amount of CO2 [40]. The weight gain ( Fig. 4 (c)) of the samples aged under ethanol vapor started at around 250 °C as a result of the oxidation of Fe0 or oxides and carbides, and the weight loss after 500 °C could be related to the oxidation of C as CO2 was found in the efflux. According to the CO2 signal ( Fig. 4 (d)) in TPO, Ce20SF without metal exsolution accumulated less carbon than Ce20SF-R because the initial reduction would decrease the OSC that was required for the oxidation of ethanol and increased the possible deposition of carbonaceous species [41]. In contrast, Ce20SFN-R showed less carbon deposition than Ce20SFN since the exsolved CeO2 with Fe-Ni alloy would benefit from the partial oxidation of ethanol for the gaseous product, such as acetaldehyde or ethylene, to avoid the deposition of carbon. XPS ( Fig. 5 (a)) was carried out to confirm the elemental composition and valence states of Ce20SFN, Ce20SFN-R and Ce20SFN-R-F (Ce20SFN-R annealed under ethanol vapor). The Ce 3d spectrum ( Fig. 5 (b)) with multiple splits could be split for ceria species of Ce3+ and Ce4+, respectively. However, the characteristic peak for Ce4+ at 916.2 eV decreased and the peak of Ce3+ at 880.9 eV showed more obvious for the reduced sample. Ce3+ with a similar ionic radius similar to La3+ could be on A site, but Ce4+ can also be on B site of a perovskite (e.g. as in SrCeO3) and causing A-site deficiency. The Ce4+ substitution on the Fe site would increase the lattice volume of Ce10SFN than SFN since its ionic radius (87.0 pm) is much larger than those of Fe ions (Fe4+ for 58.5 pm v.s. Fe3+ for 64.5 pm) (Table S1). Since the A-site deficient tolerance of a perovskite increases with the bond energy of < B-O> [42–43], Ni doping on Fe site decreasing the < B-O > bond energy, which is in accord with the fact that Ce15SF did not show a CeO2 secondary phase, but Ce15SFN did. The superficial cation composition according to the XPS scan (Table S2) indicates that Ce20SFN or Ce20SFN-R was A-site excess, and specifically the Ce4+/3+ concentration decreased because of the reduction of Ce4+ would produce Ce3+ that could fit better on the A-site of the perovskite. While two asymmetric peaks were observed in the Fe 2p spectrum ( Fig. 5 (c)), each of which could be decomposed into three peaks, corresponding to a mixed oxidation state of Fe+2/+3/+4 [44]. All the peaks of Fe 2p shifted to lower binding energy along with the reduction of Fe cations [45]. The peak at 706.0 eV for exsolved Fe0 in 5% H2 was intensified in Ce20SFN-R-F than Ce20SFN-R [46]. Core-level scan of Ni 2p3/2 ( Fig. 5 (d)) for Ce20SFN could be fitted into the main peak for Ni2+ at 854.4 eV, but the subpeaks in Ce20SFN-R at 852.3 eV and 854.4 eV could be assigned to metallic Ni0 and Ni2+, respectively. Peaks for metallic Ni were observed in both Ce20SFN-R and Ce20SFN-R-F as a result of Ni0 exsolution during the reduction in 5% H2 and the following C2H5OH (g) flow. Moreover, the addition XPS peak at 854.0 eV for Ce20SFN-R-F indicated the presence of Ni3C phase [47]. The C 1 s spectrum ( Fig. 5 (e)) of Ce20SFN consisted of peak C-C (284.5 eV), C-O (286.6 eV) and C = O (288.0 eV), but the reduced one showed a higher content of C = O and the presence of C-OR (287.9 eV), which related to the absorbed polyaromatics species on the surface. The major IR-bands at 1436 cm−1 in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy ( Figure S6 ) is also assigned to the symmetrical stretching of a –COOH [48]. The O 1 s spectrum ( Fig. 5 (f)) showed three peaks for M−O (529.0 eV), oxygen vacancy (532.0 eV) and C = O species (534.5 eV), respectively."
8,Alcohol-fueled cell testing and stability,"3.3 Alcohol-fueled cell testing and stability I-V curves for SSOFC based on Ce20SF and Ce20SFN under the C2H5OH-fuel and static air oxidant ( Fig. 6 (a)) indicated that the cell with Ce20SF electrode showed curvature high deactivation at 700 and 750 °C until the voltage was lower than 0.5 V. In contrast, the cell with Ce20SFN showing a quasi-linear I-V curve indicated the exsolution of Ni-Fe alloy would promote for the decomposition and oxidation of ethanol fuel. IV curve ( Fig. 6 (b)) of the cells under methanol fuel showed higher current density than those under ethanol fuel. The Ce20SFN cell under methanol fuel ( Fig. 6 (c)) showed peak power densities (PPDs) of 0.57, 0.45 and 0.20 W cm−2 at 800, 750 and 700 °C, respectively, similar to those under ethanol fuel (0.58, 0.41, 0.18 W cm−2). The PPD for Ce20SFN in 800 °C was superior to that of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3-δ (0.48 W cm2 at 850 °C in ethanol), (La0.6Sr0.4)0.9Co0.2Fe0.6Nb0.2O3 (0.062 W cm2 at 800 °C in ethanol), the anode supported cell with a Cu-CeO2 impregnated Ni-YSZ support layer (0.40 W cm2) and the other reported anode using ethanol fuel (Table S3) [49–50]. However, the power densities of Ce20SF cell with ethanol (0.13, 0.12 and 0.09 W cm−2) was much lower than the one in methanol (0.48, 0.22, 0.10 W cm−2), which was subjected more to thermal activation in methanol than the cell in ethanol. The different behavior in cell performance for Ce20SF and Ce20SFN cell under methanol and ethanol, indicated that Ni-Fe alloy was efficient in cracking the C-C bond. Three arcs could be distinguished in the EIS of the cells under alcohol fuel and air ( Fig. 6 (d) and Figure S7 ) at OCV, where the polarization resistance (R p) estimated from the impedance of the low-frequency end subtracting the high frequency intersection between the impedance and x-axis. Ni doping greatly reduced the magnitude of the R p: e.g. the Ce20SFN cell under ethanol fuel was smaller than Ce20SF cell at 700 °C (10 Ω cm2 versus 2 Ω cm2). A fitting with an equivalent circuit containing three Voigt elements would benefit the assignment of corresponding reaction steps. At 700 °C, the fitted resistance parameter ( Figure S8 ) showed that the R3 for the low frequency dominated the R p for Ce20SF and Ce20SFN cell at 700 °C because of the slow gas phase diffusion of ethanol molecules. As temperature increased to 800 °C, the proportion of R3 in R p (64% for Ce20SF and 54% for Ce20SFN) decreased as a result of the ethanol thermal conversion into small molecules. Besides, Ni doping in Ce20SF decreased the R2 since the enhanced catalysis on ethanol facilitated the charge transfer process on the electrode/electrolyte interface, and thus decreased R3 due to simultaneous production of smaller molecules on the anode. The analysis of the EIS of methanol fueled cells with Ce20SF and Ce20SFN suggested that R2 related to the dissociation/adsorption was more important in the electrochemical than that in ethanol fuel, because the shorter carbon bond and lower molecular weight could reduce the diffusion resistance. The current densities of the cells ( Fig. 7 (a)) with Ce20SF and Ce20SFN at a constant voltage of 0.5 V at 700 °C all showed a slight variation and the current density reached 1.1 A cm−2 and 0.3 A cm−2, respectively, after 10 h. The variation of Ce20SFN could be related to the fluctuation of unstable flow during the feeding process. The cross-sectional microstructures of the symmetrical cells ( Fig. 7 (b) and (c)) clearly showed that both the anode and cathode were well anchored on the electrolyte and the thickness of Ce20SFN anode was about 60 μm. The Ce20SF and Ce20SFN anodes ( Fig. 7 (d) and (e)) showed matt surface with small spherical particles of 10 nm in diameter which could be the deposition situation of polyaromatics on the surface of the electrode after 10-h test. The cell with Ce20SFN electrode for C2H5OH showed a stable current density of 1.0 A cm−2 and 0.6 A cm−2 under a bias at 0.5 V and 0.7 V, respectively ( Fig. 8 (a)), and no obvious carbon fiber was detected in the SEM of the electrode after 300 h’ aging ( Fig. 8 (b)). The elimination of carbon was also consistent with the absence of vibrating points in the current after 300 h’ durability test. Actually, with CeO2 and Fe-Ni alloy exsolution, Ce20SFN became a quasi-SSOFC, but the main phase was identical in the cathode and anode. The anode ( Figure S9 ) maintained the main phase of perovskite with a minor phase of Fe-Ni alloy, CeO2 and SrCO3 as a result of superficial decomposition. The morphology of anode after 300 h was completely different than after 10 h and the EDS mapping ( Fig. 8 (c-g)) proved that a clear Ni-Fe exsolution. The significant reduction in carbon deposition was related to the high oxygen exchange rate and excellent oxidation catalysis of CeO2 and good catalysis to C-C bond crack of Ni-Fe alloy for the initial coke deposition was eliminated under anodic polarization because of ceria/alloy composite [51]."
9,Discussion,"Ethanol reforming (Eq. (1) ) for the production of aldehyde can be automatically conducted at a relatively low reaction temperature lower than 600 °C [52–53]. The scission of the C–C bond and deposition of carbon took place after the formation of acetaldehyde species, and it could be accelerated if insufficient H2O and O2 were provided [13]. The acetaldehyde could be finally converted into CO and a small amount of CH4 (Eq. (2) ) that induced carbon deposition through carbon monoxide disproportionation (Eq. (3) ) and methane pyrolysis (Eq. (4) ). (1) 2 C2H5OH = 2 C2H4O + H2 (2) C2H4O = CO + CH4 (3) 2 CO = CO2 + C (4) CH4 = C + 2 H2 The carbon deposition on Ce-doped SrFeO3 seems inevitable unless additional oxidant is provided for the reforming of ethanol. Ethanol could induce the loss of superficial lattice oxygen (OO x) of a perovskite oxide for possible production CO (Eq. (5) ) and the produced Vo •• would provide the transport of oxide ion for further loss of OO x (Eq. (6) ) [54–55]. In this case, the formation of carbon is reduced by the gas–solid reaction of CO with the lattice oxygen for the production of CO2 [56]. The obvious carbon deposition on Ce20SF and Ce20SFN without oxidant indicates that CHx and CO remained on the surface and generated carbonaceous residues rather than evolved to H2O and CO2. Comparing with Fe0, a reduced surface with Fe2+ would be more prone to induce the coke deposition [57], and this explains why the FeNi3 alloy exsolved during the prior H2 reduction does not accelerate the carbon deposition of Ce20SFN. (5) C2H5OH + OO x = 2 CO + 3 H2 + Vo •• + 2 e′ (6) CO + OO x = CO2 + Vo ••+ 2e′ The decomposition of oxide perovskite could also be related to the formation of carbide that shatters the physical structure, but, fortunately, the perovskite structure could be maintained partially after the operation under bias (0.5 V) for 300 h. Remarkably, the morphologies of the electrode after 300 h’ operation showed less carbon deposition than those after and 10 h. The transport of O2– from the cathode could act as the oxidant of ethanol for the production of H2O and CO2 and moreover, it can also oxidize the deposited carbon species at the OCV stage. The wide use of ceria and ceria-based mixed oxides as an active component for catalytic oxidation in hydrocarbons reforming and water gas shift reaction (WGSR) (Eq. (7) ) has been traditionally associated with the unique excellent ability of these oxides to shuttle between Ce (III) and Ce (IV) states [58–59]. (7) H2O + CO = CO2 + H2 The generation of H2 would be beneficial for the oxidation kinetics of the fuel in the anode and increases the output of the cell. CeO2 was found to facilitate the gasification of carbon species to partially inhibit coke formation in the presence of H2O or CO2, but the transport of oxygen from the cathode to the anode could be essential in this process. A dynamic balance between carbon consumption and accumulation could be achieved for a fuel cell under load. Actually, the interaction between CeO2 and ferrite perovskite was found to strongly improve the reducibility and oxygen mobility of a perovskite [60]."
10,Conclusion,"A stable perovskite-type ferrite oxide Ce20SFN is explored as an electrode candidate for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell. It exhibits outstanding reversibility and stability performance in liquid alcohol fuel condition if the cell is under a bias of 0.5 V. Trace ceria was present on the Ce20SFN and Ce20SF electrode prepared in air, but FeNi3 alloy could be outgrown from the oxide lattice of Ce20SFN after the reduction in the prior hydrogen for the superior electrocatalysis of the fuel oxidation, comparing to Ce20SF. A maximum power density of 0.58 W cm−2 and 0.57 W cm−2 and an R p of 0.13 Ω cm2 and 0.12 Ω cm2 can be achieved at 800 °C for ethanol and methanol, respectively. Most importantly, the performance and structure of the SSOFC remain stable after 300 h at 0.5 or 0.7 V. The presence of CeO2 and the in-situ exsolved FeNi3 is able to remove the deposited carbon through the synergistic effect in water gas shift reaction. The studies find that Ce0.2Sr0.8Fe0.95Ni0.05O3 perovskite has a bright prospect as an electrode material."
