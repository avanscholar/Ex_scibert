0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels have played a fundamental role in industrial development and are responsible for fulfilling 80% of energy demand globally. However, this current energy system is now facing two fundamental problems: gradual depletion and environmental pollution. This lack of sustainability has led to extensive research on new alternative energy sources (Brey et al., 2006). Among various alternative energy sources, H2 is regarded as the most promising future energy carrier, since it produces only water when combusted, generating a 2.75 times higher energy yield (122kJ/g) than hydrocarbon fuels. Furthermore, H2 fuel cells and related H2 technologies provide an essential link between renewable energy sources and sustainable energy services (Levin et al., 2004). H2 production methods can be broadly divided into physico-chemical and biological processes. Recently, more than 90% of H2 production has been achieved via steam reforming of hydrocarbons and coal gasification, due to the low costs involved in these processes. However, these methods have been criticized by the public and specialists, because they entail the use of fossil fuels, thus emitting a significant amount of greenhouse gases (Ewan and Allen, 2005). Given these perspectives, biological H2 production assumes paramount importance as an alternative energy resource. Despite relatively lower yields of H2 compared with photo-driven processes, dark fermentative H2 production (DFHP) is a promising method due to its higher rate of H2 evolution in the absence of light sources and the transformation of waste into environmentally sound materials. Therefore, this article presents an up-to date overview of current knowledge on important operation parameters and various reactor configurations in DFHP."
1,Reactor design parameters,"The operational parameters such as inoculum preparation and start-up, pH, temperature, HRT, substrate concentration and liquid product inhibition, feedstock, H2 partial pressure and nutrients are considered to have significant effects on the performance of DFHP. Defining their optimal ranges would provide important information in determining reactor and system size, materials, additional equipment, chemical reagents, and so on."
2,Inoculum preparation and start-up,"2.1 Inoculum preparation and start-up It is more practical to use mixed cultures than pure cultures in engineering point of view, because they are simpler to operate and easier to control, and may have broader choice of feedstock (Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005). Thus, numerous methods have been made to obtain H2 producing inocula from various seeding sources such as anaerobic digester sludge, sewage sludge, compost, manure and soil. Physico-chemical attack was generally used to get the inocula on the basis that main H2 producing bacteria, Clostridium sp., are spore-forming bacteria (Li and Fang, 2007). At first, toxic chemical addition was applied to inhibit H2-consuming reaction, especially killing methanogens. 2-Bromoethanesulfonate (BES), acetylene and chloroform were added to anaerobic digester sludge and showed successful performances (Liang et al., 2002). However, it is seldom used today due to the high cost of chemicals and their ineffectiveness on non H2-producing bacteria such as lactic and propionic acid bacteria. Acid/base treatment was also effective in obtaining H2 producing inocula because microbial activity is hindered at low and high pH. Acid (pH 3) and base (pH 10) enrichment of sewage sludge increased the H2-production potential by 200 and 333 times compared to control, respectively (Chen et al., 2002). Similarly, successful continuous operation using acid (pH 3–4) enriched microflora has been reported (Lin and Chou, 2004). Heat treatment of seed sludge has mostly been used for screening of H2 producing bacteria. It is reported that heat treatment not only reduces the non-spore-forming bacteria but also activates clostridia spores to commence germination by altering the germination receptor (Hawkes et al., 2007). The heating temperature and time was varied from 75°C to 121°C and 15min to 12h, respectively (Li and Fang, 2007). Sometimes sequential pretreatment (heat shock at 100°C for 2h and acid treatment at pH 3.0 for 24h) was applied for the perfect extermination of non H2-producing bacteria (HPB) in the seeding source (Mohan et al., 2007). In addition to above main pretreatment methods, aeration was applied to compost sludge (Ueno et al., 1996). After obtaining mixed cultures of H2 producing bacteria by various pretreatments, continuous operation has to be postponed until H2 production from batch operation reaches some extent in order to germinate H2 producing bacteria and to block their wash-out. Continuous operation was preceded when the H2 yield (HY) reached 0.5mol H2/mol hexose or after 48h by batch mode (Kim et al., 2006a,b). Interestingly, Kim et al. (2008) observed the successful start-up only when the continuous feeding started after HY reached 0.2mol H2/mol hexose by batch mode at 12h of HRT using continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). H2 production ceased within 10d when the operation mode was changed from batch to continuous after 0.5mol H2/mol hexose of HY was achieved by batch mode and concluded that it was due to the regrowth of propionic acid bacteria which were inhibited by heat shock (90°C for 20min) but not totally exterminated (Kim et al., 2008). Generally, HRT decreased gradually for the successful acclimation of H2 producing bacteria in the reactor. It decreased from 5d to 12h in 4 steps, each taking 20d (Lin and Jo, 2003), 120 to 12h (Lin and Chou, 2004)."
3,pH,"2.2 pH Among various operational parameters, it has been widely accepted that pH has the most significant effect on DFHP, since it directly affects the hydrogenase activity, metabolic pathway, and dominant species (Lay, 2000; Fang et al., 2002). However, the optimal initial and operational pH values vary extensively from 4.5 to 9.0. Some studies have shown that pH lower than 5.0 is preferable for H2 production. H2-consuming methanogenic activity has been detected at pH 5.0 in studies by Kim et al. (2004) and Hwang et al. (2004). They concluded that a weakly acidic condition around 5.0 is not sufficient to exterminate methanogens, and therefore pH should be lowered to 4.5 so as to prohibit H2-consuming reactions. Based on equilibrium of the NADH/NAD+ ratio inside the cell, it was proposed that an acetate–ethanol fermentation type induced at pH 4.5 is a better and more stable metabolic pathway than acetate–butyrate or acetate–propionate metabolic pathways induced at pH between 5.0 and 7.5 (Ren et al., 1997). Several studies concluded that the proper pH range is above 7.0. The maximum H2 production was detected at initial pH values of 9.0 and 7.5 by Lee et al. (2002) and Wang et al. (2006), respectively, using glucose as a substrate. Also, a maximum HY of 68.1mL H2/g TVS was observed at an initial pH 7.0 in treating wheat straw waste (Fan et al., 2006b). However, in the three aforementioned studies on the effects of initial pH, the pH was not controlled during fermentation; it was allowed to drop without any buffer addition. This experimental condition could lead to wrong conclusions, as the pH change is highly dependent on the substrate concentration and the amount of buffer capacity. For example, if there is an insufficient amount of buffer in the medium in treating a high-strength substrate, the pH drop will be drastic, and hence it is important to find the optimum pH at relatively higher ranges. However, if sufficient buffer is provided to this substrate and the buffer is also diluted, then a neutral initial pH also could yield high H2 production. Thus, in a batch process, it is necessary to separately define the roles of initial and operational pH and find the optimal values with consideration of the substrate concentration and buffer capacity. The main anaerobic HPB, Clostridium sp., have several metabolic pathways, and hydrogenic reactions are dominant at pH 5.0–6.5, while non-hydrogenic reactions are triggered outside of this range (Jones and Woods, 1986). Therefore, the pH of recent H2 producing reactors is generally controlled at pH 5.0–6.5. In batch studies reported by Lay (2000) and Fan et al. (2006a), symmetric graphs were shown with pH 5.2 and 6.0 at the center peak, respectively. The alcohol production rate was greater than the H2 production rate (HPR) if the pH was lower than 4.3 or higher than 6.1 (Lay, 2000). A number of reports on continuous operation studies have also revealed that pH around 5.5 is optimal. Fang and Liu (2002) and Yu et al. (2002), concluded that the optimal pH was 5.5 in treating glucose and rice winery wastewater, respectively. Increased microbial diversity was observed at high pH (Fang and Liu, 2002), and the compositions of propionate and ethanol were increased at lower pH (Yu et al., 2002). The addition of an alkaline solution to control pH is essential in DFHP, but presents an economic burden. To date, to our knowledge, the required amount of alkaline solution has never been quantified and an efficient way to reduce the amount has not been reported. Kraemer and Bagley (2005) attempted to decrease the alkaline solution requirement by recycling the effluent in a methane fermenter; however, this resulted in 87% decrease of H2 production, resulting from H2-consuming methanogenic activity. We speculate that anaerobic co-digestion with a high buffer containing feedstock such as sewage sludge or livestock waste can be an economical solution. As these wastes are protein rich, a large amount of hydroxide ions along with ammonia ions ( NH 4 + ) would be supplied during the fermentation, which would help to mitigate pH drop."
4,Temperature,"2.3 Temperature Temperature affects the activity of microorganisms and the conversion rate of fermentation products, and is closely related to economic benefit. Zhang and Shen (2006) obtained results indicating that the sensitivity of mixed bacteria to temperature was significantly high and the optimal temperature was found to be around 35°C. Mu et al. (2006a,b) examined the effect of temperature by varying the temperature from 33 to 41°C and found that H2 production and microbial growth rate were increased with increased temperature, accompanied by a change of the metabolic product distribution. In spite of placing an economic burden, H2 fermenters are often operated in a thermophilic (50–60°C) or hyper-thermophilic (70–80°C) range, since it is believed that operation at high temperature could enhance the H2 fermentation performance by promoting hydrolysis and simplifying microbial diversity such that it is favorable to H2 production. Gavala et al. (2006) and Yu et al. (2002) observed enhanced H2 production from glucose and rice winery wastewater, respectively, by increasing the operation temperature from 35 to 55°C. According to Shin et al. (2004) and Idania et al. (2005), H2 production obtained from a thermophilic culture was much higher than that of a mesophilic culture owing to changes in the population dynamics and metabolic pathways that are favorable to H2 production. The highest HY (2.47mol H2/mol glucose) in continuous operation reported to date was achieved under a hyper-thermophilic (70°C) condition (Kotsopoulos et al., 2006), and complete disappearance of H2-consuming activity was observed at 75°C in treating cow waste slurry (Yokoyama et al., 2007). High temperature can promote hydrolysis and simplify microbial diversity in a manner favorable to H2 production, but it can also bring about monotonous microbial diversity, resulting in incomplete substrate degradation, especially in the treatment of actual waste. Also, operation at high temperature places an economic burden, as it requires a tight and closed structure and immense energy to heat and maintain the temperature of the reactor. Therefore, the temperature effect must be thoroughly investigated considering not only the H2 fermentation performance but also substrate degradation and economic factors."
5,Hydraulic retention time (HRT),"2.4 Hydraulic retention time (HRT) As HRT is related to the amount of organics that can be handled per unit time, it has a direct impact on economical operation. Generally, H2 producing bacteria prefer short retention time, since the main H2 producing bacteria, Clostridium sp., tend to produce VFAs with H2 at the exponential growth phase while they produce alcohols at the stationary growth phase (Jones and Woods, 1986). With respect to microbial community, short HRT is also preferred. The washout of propionic acid bacteria, which consume H2 during their metabolism, was observed upon transition of the HRT from 8 to 6h (Zhang et al., 2006). It is generally held that short HRT prohibits methanogenic growth, since the growth rate of methanogens is much lower than that of H2-producing bacteria. In the first (to the best of the authors’ knowledge) review paper mainly focused on DFHP, it was concluded that an HRT in a range of 8–12h is optimal for a liquid-type substrate (Hawkes et al., 2002). However, recently, the employment of immobilization and granulation techniques has dramatically reduced the HRT with increased HPR. This is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. In treating solid-type feedstock, the optimal HRT was much longer, as a hydrolysis step is required. Shin and Youn (2005) compared the H2 fermentation performance of food waste at HRTs of 2, 3, and 5d; a HRT of 5d showed the highest HY, 2.2mol H2/mol hexose. A survey of the literature indicates that the shortest HRT with stable and high performance achieved to date is 1.2d, for the treatment of a mixture of food waste and paper waste operated under thermophilic (60°C) conditions using packed-bed reactor (Ueno et al., 2007)."
6,Substrate concentration and liquid product inhibition,"2.5 Substrate concentration and liquid product inhibition In the batch tests, optimal substrate concentration was quite varied and deeply influenced by other operational parameters such as pH. When the pH was not controlled, HY usually decreased with increasing substrate concentration due to low pH condition. Using fractional factorial design, the effects of pH and substrate concentration and their interaction on H2 production were investigated, and pH 5.5 at substrate concentration of 7.5g COD/L was found to be the optimal condition (Ginkel et al., 2001). Finding the optimal substrate concentration in continuous operation is more meaningful and practicable especially in treating wastewater. Best performance was found at 30g sucrose COD/L with HY of 1.09mol H2/mol hexose using CSTR (Kim et al., 2006b). At inlet substrate concentration below 20g COD/L, the HY decreased along with a significant decrease in the n-butyrate/acetate ratio and appearance of H2 consuming bacteria and decrease of substrate removal efficiency was observed at over 35g COD/L. However, the HY decreased from 2.4 to 1.7mol H2/mol hexose with substrate concentration increase from 2.5 to 10g COD/L (Ginkel and Logan, 2005). High substrate concentration allows more energy-efficient operation but product inhibition is likely to set the upper limit. Certain level of metabolic products in the DFHP may inhibit H2 producing pathway as well as microbial activity. It is known that butyrate has the most toxic effect on Clostridium sp., among various acids, thus a lot of attempts were made to alleviate butyrate inhibition, mostly by chemical extraction. Kyazze et al. (2005) reported that adding butyrate to a stable reactor to raise the free butyrate level from 33 to 63mM stopped gas production completely, although the reactor recovered in 84h after the spike."
7,Feedstock,"2.6 Feedstock The main substrate for the fermentative H2 production was synthetic wastewater containing carbohydrate substances. Numerous works have been focused on glucose and sucrose and optimal process parameters including pH, HRT, temperature, substrate concentration, etc. for them were fully investigated (Li and Fang, 2007; Ghosh and Hallenbeck, 2010). Xylose and cellulose, main components of agricultural wastes, were also used for the successful H2 production. Polysaccharides such as starch were also successfully used as a single substrate for the H2 production (Arooj et al., 2007). Mohan et al. (2010) studied about the feasibility of fermentative effluents from DFHP as substrate for poly (β-OH) butyrate production. It was found that HY was significantly increased (12.48–16.21mol H2/kg COD) with increase in OLR (2.91–4.58kg COD/m3/d). For the dual benefit of fermentative H2 production, waste degradation and energy generation, actual wastes were often utilized as substrates. Carbohydrate-rich actual wastewaters were the main target for the H2 fermentation. Food processing wastewater (Ginkel and Logan, 2005), reed canary grass (RCG) (Lakaniemi et al., 2011), and rice straw (Lo et al., 2010) were proved to be feasible substrates by batch tests showing the maximum HY of 2.8L H2/L-wastewater, 1.25mmol H2/g RCG, and 0.76mol H2/mol xylose, respectively. Continuous H2 production from rice winery wastewater in an upflow reactor was conducted at various operating conditions and achieved the optimum HPR of 9.33L H2/g VSS/d at HRT of 2h, COD concentration of 34g COD/L, pH 5.5 and temperature 55°C (Yu et al., 2002). High HY of 2.52mol H2/hexose was obtained using CSTR from sugary wastewater and it was successfully operated for 190days (Ueno et al., 1996). Fan et al. (2006a) operated the CSTR treating brewery waste at various HRT and pH and achieved the maximum H2 production performance of 43mL H2/g COD at HRT=18h and pH=5.5. Also cheese whey wastewater was tested for the H2 production using CSTR (Venetsaneas et al., 2009). Recently, Jung et al. (2011a,b) evaluated DFHP from eight different kinds of marine algae, often referred to as third generation biomass, in order to find new feedstock. Results showed that the highest HY of 69.1mL H2/g COD was obtained from Laminaria japonica. It was attributed to its high carbohydrate content (about 60%) in the cell, including laminarin and alginate."
8,H2 partial pressure,"2.7 H2 partial pressure Partial pressure or H2 in the liquid phase is one of the key factors affecting DFHP. It is known that high H2 partial pressure generally has a negative effect on H2 production, by decreasing the activity of hydrogenase and making the H2 production reaction thermodynamically unfavorable (Bahl and Dürre, 2001). Ruzicka (2006) theoretically proved that high H2 partial pressure inside the cell may facilitate propionate production while suppressing acetate and butyrate production. Numerous attempts have been made to decrease H2 partial pressure. Vigorous mixing to avoid supersaturation, N2 and CO2 sparging, and installation of a H2-permeable membrane to remove dissolved H2 from the mixed liquor were found to be effective means of enhancing H2 production (Mizuno et al., 2000; Liang et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2006a) ."
9,Nutrients,"2.8 Nutrients Besides main substrate, carbohydrate materials, DFHP requires nutrients for bacterial activity like all biological treatment processes. The nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), ferrous (Fe) and some trace metals. Among many kinds of nutrients N is the most essential one for bacterial growth. N was supplied by various forms i.e. ammonia ion, yeast extract, peptone and so on. Optimal C/N ratio was varied a lot, 6.7 and 47 according to Liu and Shen (2004) and Lin and Lay (2004a), respectively. Excess ammonia addition caused inhibitory effect on H2 production; continuous decrease of HY from 1.9 to 1.1mol H2/mol hexose with increase of ammonia concentration from 0.8 to 7.8g NH4-N/L (Salerno et al., 2006). P and Fe concentrations would affect metabolic pathway of Clostridium sp., and H2 production potential decreased when their concentrations were limited. P is the main source of ATP formation and it has a lot of functions in enzyme linkage. Lin and Lay (2004b) found that phosphate acted as a better buffer source for H2 production than carbonate. Its addition enhanced H2 production by 1.9 times and decreased the lag period. Effect of iron has investigated a lot in DFHP since it is an essential component of hydrogenase, but its optimal concentration was varied. It was varied with culture temperature; 800, 200 and 25mg FeSO4/L when cultured at 25, 35 and 40°C, respectively (Zhang and Shen, 2006). Lin and Lay (2005) studied the requirement of eleven trace metals in H2 fermentation. Magnesium, sodium, zinc and iron were found to be the important trace metals with magnesium the most significant one. H2 production enhanced by 30% at optimal combined concentrations, 4.8mgMg2+/L, 393mg Na+/L, 0.25mg Zn2+/L and 1mg Fe2+/L. Li and Fang (2007) suggested the CI,50 values, at which the bioactivity of the sludge was reduced to 50% of the control, for individual heavy metals; Cu 30mg/L, Ni and Zn 1600mg/L, Cr 3000mg/L, Cd 3500mg/L and Pb >5000mg/L and they concluded that H2-producing sludges have higher resistance than methanogenic sludges."
10,Bioreactor classification,"Two types of reactors have been developed for DFHP: (1) suspended bioreactors – continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR), and anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR); and (2) immobilized bioreactors – up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBr), expanded granular sludge bed reactor (EGSBr), and anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR)."
11,Suspended bioreactors,"3.1 Suspended bioreactors Early applications of hydrogen fermentation utilized suspended bioreactors, which were initially designed to function in a manner similar to anaerobic digestion for methane fermentation. Although immobilized bioreactors have recently been developed, the suspended bioreactors are still useful, especially for feedstock containing high particular content such as municipal solid waste and food waste. As highly concentrated biomass is a means of guaranteeing positive energy gain for hydrogen production (Hawkes et al., 2002), suspended bioreactors hold a dominant position in hydrogen fermentation. Table 1 lists feedstock, operating conditions, and H2 production performances for various bioreactor configurations. 3.1.1 Continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) The simplest H2-producing suspended bioreactor configuration is a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The important operating parameters such as pH, substrate concentration, solids retention time (SRT), and hydrogen content have been derived mostly from CSTR operation (Hawkes et al., 2007). In a strict definition of a CSTR, feeding and discharge are also continuously performed; however, they are sometimes also performed in sequencing mode, especially for biomass with high particular content (Li et al., 2008). Table 2 summarizes the maximum H2 production in CSTRs fed with organic solid waste. In most cases, H2-producing suspended bioreactors have cylindrical shapes and employ mechanical turbines for mixing. As the size of a H2-producing CSTR is much smaller than that of a conventional methane digester due to the shorter HRT of the former, the aforementioned shape and mixing method could be feasible up to a certain level of commercialization. However, it might be necessary to apply enhanced shapes and mixing methods to achieve ideal CSTR condition at larger sizes. It has been recently reported that H2 producing bacteria (HPB) in CSTR operation can be rapidly flocculated and granulated. Although, few studies on the commencement of granulation and formation mechanisms of H2-producing granule (HPG) have been reported, the formation of HPG can be explained by a four-step model (Schmidt and Ahring, 1996): (1) transportation of cells to the surface of other cells; (2) initial reversible adsorption to the substratum; (3) irreversible adhesion of the cells; (4) multiplication of the cells and formation of granules. It is also believed that divalent cations, e.g., Ca2+/Mg2+/Fe2+, and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), especially the carbohydrate component of EPS, might play essential roles in the formation of HPG (Fang et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2007). Fang et al. (2002) first reported that HPB could be agglutinated into granules at 26°C, pH 5.5, and HRT 6h within 80days, having a diameter and settling velocity of 1.6mm and 50m/h, respectively, and consequently the HPR was 13.0L H2/L/d. Furthermore, the HPG contained EPS of 179mg/g VSS and had a protein/carbohydrate (P/C) ratio of 0.2. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2007) reported that HPG was successfully formed after 114h and consequently a HPR of 3.2L H2/L/h was achieved by acid incubation of sludge for 24h. These findings suggest that an acidic environment will neutralize the negative charge of the cell surface, thereby decreasing the repulsion forces between cells. Initially, the portion of protein was higher than the amount of carbohydrate with a P/C ratio of 0.8; however, a decrease of the P/C ratio was observed and it was maintained at 0.2. Jung et al. (2011a,b) also demonstrated that the key EPS component for successful formation of HPG is carbohydrates. Indeed, it was reported that CDMW is a suitable feedstock to form HPG, because it has various divalent cations, especially calcium ions. 3.1.2 Anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) Decoupling of SRT from HRT would provide a superior organic loading rate (OLR) and H2 productivity, because shorter HRT and higher retention of H2-producers would be achieved. H2-producing high-rate bioreactors initially followed the example of high-rate digesters for methane production. However, longer SRT might cause growth of H2-consumers or competitors for the substrate, such as non-hydrogen producing acidogens (Chang et al., 2002). Therefore, the operating parameters and some configurations of H2-producing high-rate bioreactors should be different from those for methane production. The anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) is a batch variation of up-flow reactors such as the UASBr in that it depends on the development of superior settling biomass and provides for staging of the kinetics (Sung and Dague, 1992). The process involved batch feeding, internal solids separation, and supernatant wasting, and is capable of achieving long SRT with relatively short HRT. It is suitable for treating feedstock containing high particular content, unlike other high-rate digestion processes (Dugba and Zhang, 1999). The simplicity of the operation by using batch feeding is another advantage in solid waste treatment (Han and Shin, 2004). Lin and Jo (2003) investigated the ASBR performance for hydrogen production from sucrose. HRT and the reaction period/settling period (R/S) ratio varied from 16 to 8h and 1.7 to 5.6, respectively. VSS concentration was maintained at more than 5.0g/L, which was much higher than that (1.5–2.5g/L) in CSTR (Hawkes et al., 2002). However, the optimum HRT was 12h, similar to that achieved in CSTR. The maximum hydrogen production of 1.3mol H2/mole hexoseadded was attained at a R/S ratio 5.6 in the study by Hawkes et al. (2002). Arooj et al. (2007) operated an ASBR (HRT 18h and SRT 72h) and a CSTR (HRT 18h) with starch as a substrate, and compared their performance. The ASBR showed higher VSS concentration, but lower H2 production (0.2mol H2/mol hexose in ASBR vs. 0.5mol H2/mol hexose in CSTR). They found that non-settleable decanting microorganisms, resulting from stratification in the settling phase, were capable of more specific H2 activity than settleable microorganisms in ASBR. On the other hand, Kim et al. (2008) reported higher hydrogen productivity of an ASBR (2.72L H2/L/d and 80.9mL H2/g VS at HRT 30h and SRT 90h) compared to that of a CSTR (0.91L H2/L/d and 25.8mL H2/g VS at HRT 30h) with food waste as a substrate. They decanted the liquid from the middle or bottom layer (0.20 to 0.42 of decanting level, which is the relative height of the drawing port with respect to the depth of mixed liquor). 3.1.3 Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) The membrane bioreactor (MBR) has emerged as an effective means of attaining performance improvement in wastewater treatment and has recently been applied to anaerobic process due to its capability of increasing biomass retention via membrane separation (Lee et al., 2010; Vallero et al., 2005). There are two principal approaches for membrane design and operation: external cross-flow type and submerged or immersed type. Previously, most researches have utilized an external cross-flow type due to ease of use and possible construction of a CSTR. However, the submerged type has attracted more interest recently and seen increased use, because it is less energy intensive and requires less membrane management (Yang et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2009). Attempts have been made recently to apply the MBR process to hydrogen production, but relatively little research has been carried out thus far. Oh et al. (2004) demonstrated that HPR was increased by 25% to 0.32L/L/h due to a 164% increase in biomass concentration to 5.8g/L with an increase of the SRT from 3.3 to 12h using an external cross-flow membrane. However, increasing the SRT from 5 to 48h at a HRT of 5h more increased overall glucose removal, but did not increase overall H2 production compared to that achieved with a HRT=SRT condition. Similarly, stable operation was observed in treating different kinds of carbon sources, fructose (2.75L/L/h), glucose (1.48L/L/h), and sucrose (2.07L/L/h), by effectively avoiding cell washout, at 1h HRT using a hollow-fiber membrane installation. However, decreased substrate utilization was observed, thereby decreasing HRT conditions (Lee et al., 2007). Lee et al. (2009) also reported that the HPR of the MBR was around 2.6 times higher than that of a CSTR, whereas no parallel increase between HPR and HY was found in the MBR. Indeed, due to a low F/M ratio of 2.6, the specific H2 production rate (SHPR) was considerably lower than that in the CSTR, specifically by about 15 times. Accordingly, previous reports pointed out that SRT and HRT are important factors in cross-flow and submerged membrane type for H2 production using an AnMBR, because SRT and HRT are closely related with the F/M ratio and organic loading rate (OLR), respectively. Lee et al. (2010) showed that increased H2 production was observed with increasing SRT, but it decreased at a long 90d SRT. This might have been due to the low VSS/TSS concentration and a metabolic pathway shift to lactate. Moreover, decreased H2 production under a long SRT was due to a reduction of microbial growth, linked to the accumulation of EPS. Several reports have demonstrated that EPS can negatively affect not only microbial activity by metal toxicity but also membrane permeability by membrane fouling (Li and Fang, 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Halbouni et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010). Membrane fouling is a key process limitation and remains one of the most challenging issues in future MBR development (Yang et al., 2006). However, the mechanisms of membrane fouling have not been clearly identified thus far. Two reports have attempted to define the mechanism of membrane fouling during DFHP (Lee et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010). Both researches reported that colloidal adhesion and biomass deposition by EPS production directly led to a decrease in the permeate flux, and thus these were postulated as the main mechanisms of membrane fouling."
12,Immobilized bioreactors,"3.2 Immobilized bioreactors Most outstanding H2 productivities reported to date have been achieved using immobilized reactors. The common reactor configurations are the UASBr, EGSBr, and AFBR. 3.2.1 Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBr) The concept of the UASBr was developed in the 1970s for CH4 production, and it has prevailed successfully for anaerobic treatment of various types of wastewater to produce methane, because of its high treatment efficiency and excellent process stability (Lettinga et al., 1980; Wang et al., 2007). This reactor has a longitudinal structure with a gas/liquid/solid separator at the top, where microbial granules with high settling velocity are formed, resulting in a thick biomass blanket zone at the bottom (Jung et al., 2010). Numerous works have dealt with H2 producing UASBr, since HPG formation was first reported by Fang et al. (2002), and as mentioned above, this reactor generally shows high and stable performance. However, for most studies in this field, synthetic wastewater is generally applied as a substrate. Chang and Lin (2004) produced H2 from sucrose using an UASBr seeded with heat pretreated sewage sludge. The highest HY and HPR values were 0.75mol H2/mol hexose and 0.25L H2/L/h, respectively, at a HRT of 8h. In addition, the average HPG diameter was 0.43mm after 173d of operation. Mu et al. (2006a,b) attempted to optimize the operational pH condition from sucrose using an UASBr seeded with sludge taken from an anaerobic reactor treating citrate-producing wastewater. A maximum HY of 1.68mol H2/mol hexose and a HPR of 0.145L H2/L/h were obtained at pH 4.2. However, a long start-up period of 300d was required for successful formation of HPG. Similarly, the highest HY and HPR values of 3.0mol H2/mol hexose and 0.05L H2/L/h, respectively, were achieved at 18h HRT after a 150day start-up period. Wang et al. (2007) reported the highest HY of 1.33mol H2/mol hexose and a HPR of 0.1L H2/L/h using sucrose as a substrate; however, a start-up period of 150d was needed to establish stable operation. Lee et al. (2004) developed a carrier-induced granular sludge bed (CIGSB) reactor and installed carrier matrices on the bottom to stimulate granule formation in consideration of the findings of a previous study showing that self-flocculated sludge formed when the bed porosity was high (>90%) and the HRT was low (<4h) (Lee et al., 2003). They achieved a maximum HPR of 7.3L H2/L/h at a 0.5h HRT. Similarly, Wu et al. (2005) designed a reactor containing silicone-immobilized and self-flocculated sludge and obtained the highest HPR (15L H2/L/h) documented to date. A high concentration of biomass up to 35.4g VSS/L was maintained even at 0.5h of HRT. However, application of the UASBr is obstructed by the major drawback of a long start-up period, where a few months are generally required for HPG formation, as mentioned above. Hu and Chen (2007) used methanogenic granules as a seeding source after heat, acid or chemical shock and observed whether this granular structure was maintained with H2 production ability. Only chemical shock (chloroform addition) caused irreversible damage to methanogens while H2 productivity reached 11.6L H2/L/d without granular structure breakage. In an effort to decrease the start-up period in the UASBr, Jung et al. (2011a,b) inoculated heat-treated sludge to a CSTR, and then mixed liquor in the CSTR was transferred to the UASBr as a seeding source. As a result, HPG with an average size of 1.9mm was successfully formed in the UASBr after 45d of operation using coffee drink manufacturing wastewater (CDMW). This is the first report on the formation of HPG from actual wastewater. Thus far, the application of actual wastewater for DFHP using an UASBr has been limited, although it has high potential for significant enhancement of economic viability. Four studies on DFHP from actual wastewater have been conducted thus far (Yu et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2010, 2011a,b). Rice winery wastewater was applied as a substrate for DFHP in order to optimize HRT, substrate concentration, and operational pH conditions (Yu et al., 2002). A maximum HY of 2.14mol H2/mol hexose and a HPR of 0.16L H2/L/h were reported; however, no information on the HPG was provided. Jung et al. (2011a,b) reported that maximum HY and HPR average values of 1.78mol H2/mol hexose and 2.76L H2/L/h, respectively, were obtained from CDMW. 3.2.2 Expanded granular sludge bed reactor (EGSBr) An expanded granular sludge bed reactor (EGSBr) is a variant of the UASBr concept, and was developed to overcome problems such as preferential flows, hydraulic short cuts, and dead zones that can occur in the UASBr (Kato et al., 2003). In this reactor concept, a liquid up-flow velocity (V up) above 4m/h permits partial expansion (fluidization) of the granular sludge bed, resulting in better substrate-sludge contact as well as enhancing separation of small inactive suspended particles from the sludge bed (Seghezzo et al., 1998). Due to the hydrodynamic characteristics in the EGSBr, soluble pollutants are efficiently treated but wastewater containing inert or poorly biodegradable suspended solids must not be allowed to accumulate in the reactor (Kato et al., 2003; Seghezzo et al., 1998). Recently, a few studies have been conducted to enhance DFHP using EGSBr; however, HPR was not substantially increased compared to the UASBr. Guo et al. (2008a) operated an EGSBr with granular activated carbon as the support media and achieved a highest HPR of 17.04L H2/L/d and a HY of 1.95mol H2/mol hexose under an OLR of 120g COD/L/d (2h HRT and 10g COD/L) using molasses wastewater as a substrate. Guo et al. (2008b) also reported that the maximum HPR was 1.64L H2/L/d under an OLR of 1.0g starch/L/d and a HRT of 4h using starch wastewater. Fresh leachate originating from municipal solid wastes was utilized for the first time as a substrate in an EGSBr (Liu et al., 2010). Results showed that the average HPR was 2.15L H2/L/d under a V up of 3.7m/h and an OLR of 24g COD/L/d. 3.2.3 Anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR) The AFBR system has been widely applied for wastewater treatment due to its high efficiency at low HRT with high biomass concentration (Hickey and Owens, 1981); accordingly, this system has been recently utilized for DFHP. In most studies in this field, gel entrapping, granular active carbon (GAC), and expanded clay were applied in order to immobilize HPB. The alginate gel entrapment method, i.e., mixing biomass with acrylic latex/silicon supplemented by a small amount of sodium alginate and activated carbon, was applied to a fluidized-bed reactor, resulting in a high HPR of 0.93L H2/L/h at a short HRT of 2h (Wu et al., 2003). Lin et al. (2006) operated a draft tube AFBR containing silicone gel immobilized HPB, and the highest HPR of 2.27L H2/L/d was achieved under a HRT of 2.2h. However, it was reported that the immobilized cells created by gel entrapping techniques easily suffer from mass transfer resistance and immobilized bioparticles can be damaged by the biogas produced inside the gel (Zhang et al., 2007). Zhang et al. (2007) produced H2 from glucose using GAC as a support medium. Results showed a maximum HPR of 2.36L H2/L/h with an attached biofilm concentration of 21.5g/L under a HRT of 1h. Also, Zhang et al. (2008) reported that a biofilm-based AFBR using a GAC showed a higher HPR (7.6L H2/L/h) as compared with a granule-based AFBR (6.6L H2/L/h) under a HRT of 0.25h with an average biomass concentration of 35g VSS/L in both AFBR. In the case of using expanded clay as a support medium, Shida et al. (2009) and Amorim et al. (2009) reported that the highest HPR values were 1.28L H2/L/h and 0.97L H2/L/h when the HRT was 1h, whereas the HYs were higher under a HRT of 2h in both studies. Barros et al. (2010) operated an AFBR using different support materials – polystyrene and expanded clay – and achieved a highest HPR of 1.21L H2/L/h with 1.1mg TVS/g using expanded clay under a HRT of 1h."
13,Concluding remarks,"Thus far, the numerous researches on DFHP have been investigated; however, the technology is still ambiguous to practically apply in full-scale operation. First, even though physico/chemical shock to obtain HPB is not a big economic burden in a lab-scale system, it could be a significant problem in full-scale system. Therefore, it is better to develop a practically applicable method, which is cheap but effective, or, it may be possible to obtain the inoculum from the substrate itself such as food waste (Kim et al., 2009). Second, this review showed that immobilized bioreactors can overcome the drawbacks of suspended bioreactors, resulting in enhanced H2 productivity. Nevertheless, numerous studies have focused on DFHP using carbohydrate-rich synthetic wastewater such as glucose and sucrose. Therefore, the utilization of actual waste/wastewater is strongly recommended in order to exploit the dual benefits of DFHP, waste degradation and energy generation. In addition, terrestrial biomass, referred to as first and second generation biomass has been a main substrate for biofuel. However, some negative opinions have been arisen due to several reasons (Jung et al., 2011a,b). Therefore, it is time to focus on aquatic biomass, such as micro and macro algae, due to its advantages as follows: (1) fast growth rate; (2) negligible lignin; (3) high CO2 utilization rate. Third, many operational parameters affect DFHP, and thus statistical approaches and kinetic models can help attain a better understanding of individual and interactive influences of each parameter and can provide useful information for the analysis, design, and operation of fermentation processes. Last, as the DFHP alone could convert, even at optimal condition, less than 33% of the substrate, second step process should be recommended. Recently, there has been an attempt to recover H2, CH4, and electricity by microbial fuel cell (MFC) from biodiesel or bioethanol waste via two-stage fermentation system. Although two-stage fermentation system would enhance total bioenergy conversion efficiency, it is still required further studies for practical application."
