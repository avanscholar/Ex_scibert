0,Introduction,"The rhizome Zingiber officinale Roscoe is generally known as ginger and is widely used as a spice and ingredient in Chinese folk medicine. Gingerols of various chain lengths (n6 to n10) are the most abundant pungent compounds in ginger and have been shown to possess many beneficial pharmacological applications, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities [1–6]. However, gingerols are thermally sensitive and undergo facile dehydration at high temperatures (>60 °C)[7]. Green extraction techniques are developed based on the design of extraction processes with the aim to reduce the energy consumption and the use of volatile organic solvents (VOSs). Decocting, refluxing, distillation, and Soxhlet extraction are conventional extraction techniques employed in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries for obtaining active products from plant materials [8,9]. However, these methods typically require high extraction temperatures and the use of VOSs. This may result in a lower yield of the isolated active gingerols as well as potentially increase process risks. Ultrasonication-based extraction is a promising technology for extracting contents from plant materials without the need for high-temperature operations and has been widely used for the extraction of different plant materials in several studies [10–13]. Strong stretching forces generated by ultrasound waves allow the higher penetration of the extraction solvent into the cell walls of the raw plant materials, which facilitates the release of their contents into the solvent [1,14,15]. Additionally, the straightforward procedures of its use and the affordability of the instrumentation make ultrasonication-based extraction highly appealing. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a class of green and sustainable solvents which were first introduced by Abbott et al. [16]. in 2003. These novel solvents are being developed as replacements of conventional VOSs in many areas owing to their unique properties [17–21]. DES is defined as a eutectic liquid mixture of two or more solid or liquid components which are able to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions [16,22,23]. DESs have displayed many outstanding advantages, including negligible volatility, non-flammability, adjustable viscosity, cost-effectiveness and facile production processes [20,24–27]. Owing to these superior properties, DESs have been extensively used in many different fields such as pharmaceuticals, catalysis, electrochemistry and extractions [18,23,28–30]. DES is typically prepared by mixing two compounds in specific ratios under stirring and heating or vacuum evaporation over a long period to obtain a clear liquid [20,23]. At the time of writing, an ultrasonic bath preparation method was first reported to produce DES samples. In this study, various DESs have been designed and prepared with three different compounds (choline chloride, betaine and L-carnitine) as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and five different alcohols (triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, glycerol, and 1,3-butanediol) as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) using the ultrasonic bath method. Depending on the size of the ultrasonic bath machine, a number of DES samples can be produced simultaneously under the same conditions. All components used for the preparation of the DESs have been approved or regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, the DESs prepared here can be considered as natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) and can be used directly in cosmetic and pharmaceutical fields. The physical properties of the prepared DES samples were characterised and the samples were used as media for extracting gingerols from ginger. Selected extraction conditions, including the concentrations of DESs, extraction time and temperature, were optimised via response surface methodology (RSM) to develop an effective route for the extraction of the active products. The antioxidant capacity of the selected DES with ginger extract was examined by using the Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and the 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assay method."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Chemicals and plant material,"2.1 Chemicals and plant material The ginger powder was obtained from Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Guangdong, China). All alcohols with purities > 99 wt%, namely triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, glycerol, and 1,3-butanediol, were purchased from Adamas Reagent (Shanghai, China). Betaine (purity > 98 wt%) and choline chloride (purity > 99 wt%) were purchased from Maya Reagent (Zhejiang Jiaxing, China) while L-carnitine with purity > 98 wt% was provided from Adamas Reagent (Shanghai, China). The gingerol standards with purities > 98 wt% (6-gingerol, 8-gingerol and 10-gingerol) were sourced from Shanghai Nature Standard Company (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used as received without further treatment."
3,Synthesis of DESs,"2.2 Synthesis of DESs The DES samples were prepared by using the ultrasonication-assisted preparation method by mixing the two components in sealed 20 mL glass bottles in the molar ratios indicated in Table 1 . The glass bottles were placed in a KQ-300E ultrasonic bath (Kunshan ultrasonic instruments Co. Ltd., Kunshan, China) with an ultrasonic input power of 300 W and a frequency of 40 kHz. The mixtures formed clear and homogeneous liquids at room temperature after up to 5 h of ultrasonication. The final temperatures of ultrasonic bath could reach up to 50 °C due to the long periods of ultrasonication. All DES samples were placed at ambient temperature for an extra 24 h after their production to ensure the formation of the liquid mixture. The DESs prepared in this study can be stored at room temperature stably for over 14 days without any recrystalizing. The viscosities of the DESs were typically high and were reduced by dilution with water for facilitating extractions. The viscosities of the DES aqueous solutions were determined by A&D SV-1A vibro viscometer (A&D Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) while the pH values were measured with an INESA PHS-3E pH meter (Shanghai Youyi instrument Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China)."
4,Ultrasonication-assisted extraction and microstructure of plant material,"2.3 Ultrasonication-assisted extraction and microstructure of plant material The DES samples were diluted to 75 v/v% before extraction. The raw ginger powder was ground and sieved through a 120-mesh sieve before extraction. The sieved ginger powder was added into 75 v/v% DES in a solvent/solid ratio of 30/1. The mixture was ultrasonic extracted in a KQ-300E ultrasonic bath (Kunshan Ultrasonic instruments Co. Ltd., Kunshan, China) with an ultrasonic input power of 300 W and a frequency of 40 kHz under desired conditions. The extractant was centrifuged for 5 min and was then filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. A Hitachi (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) SU8018 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) in the secondary electron (SE) mode with 5 kV accelerating voltage was used for observing the microstructure of the raw and treated ginger powder. Before imaging, the samples were coated with a Pt layer of approximately 10 nm thickness."
5,Determination of the content of gingerols,"2.4 Determination of the content of gingerols The concentrations of gingerols extracted by DES solutions were determined using an Agilent (Santa Clara, California, USA) 1100 series HPLC equipped with a quaternary pump, a DAD detector, an autosampler and a thermostated column compartment. An Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (250 × 4.60 mm; 5 μm) was built to detect chromatographic separation. The mobile phase was made with (A) water and (B) acetonitrile while a gradient elution programme was set up from 20 v/v% acetonitrile for 10 min with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The concentration of acetonitrile was gradually increased to 100 v/v% at 45 min. Another 10 min post-run time was carried out to fully equilibrate the system. The column oven was held at 25 °C while the UV spectra were controlled at 280 nm. The sample injection volume was 20 μL. The standard solutions of gingerols were prepared by directly dissolving 8.55 mg of 6-gingerol, 3.30 mg of 8-gingerol and 5.70 mg of 10-gingerol, respectively, in 10 mL of methanol. All standard solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter before analysis. HPLC analyses of each sample were carried out in triplicate to provide estimates of experimental variability. The extraction yield was calculated by the following equation. Y i e l d m g / g = m a m p × 100 % where ma is the mass of the gingerols extracted in the solution and mp is the mass of ginger powder added."
6,Response surface methodology,"2.5 Response surface methodology The optimized ultrasonic extraction conditions of the selected DESs were determined by response surface methodology (RSM) which is a statistical technique for studying the interactions between factors in an appropriate variable range. The effect of the DES concentration, extraction time and temperature were studied by RSM to obtain the suitable extraction yield of gingerols with optimal antioxidant capacity (FRAP and ABTS assay). Central composite design (CCD) combined with RSM was applied to three independent variables including (A) concentration of selected DES, (B) extraction time, and (C) temperature at five levels (−a, −1, 0, +1, and +a) to study their relation to the extraction yield and the antioxidant ability. The Design-Expert 8.0 software package (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used for the generation and evaluation of the experimental design."
7,Antioxidant capacity assay,"2.6 Antioxidant capacity assay FRAP and ABTS assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant capacities of the ginger extracts in the solutions. Ginger can scavenge reactive oxygen species, free radicals, and various other damaging oxidants while those two examinations have been applied in many studies to determine the gingerols as a potential source of natural antioxidants [3,31–33]. Both FRAP and ABTS assays were performed in triplicate on the selected samples based on reported studies [34,35] to obtain estimates of experimental uncertainties. The two examination methods employed are briefly described as follows. The FRAP reagent contained 2.5 mL of 10 mM tripyridyltriazine (TPTZ) solution in 40 mM HCl, 2.5 mL of 20 mM ferric chloride hexahydrate, and 25 mL of 300 mM acetate buffer. The reagent was freshly prepared and kept warm at 37 °C before the test. The selected samples were mixed with the reagent in a 96 well plate for 5 min and then their absorbance at 593 nm was recorded using a spectrophotometer. The calibration was carried out by 80 v/v% ethanolic solutions of known trolox concentrations (0.1–0.8 mmol/L) with a superior linear relationship (r > 0.99). The results were presented as mM of the trolox equivalent (mM TE). The ABTS solution was produced by mixing 7 mM ABTS reagent with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate solution to generate the ABTS radical cations. The mixture was incubated in a dark room at ambient temperature for 16 h. The absorbance of the ABTS working solution was adjusted to 734 nm by diluting it with 80 v/v% ethanol. The selected samples were mixed with ABTS working solution in a 96 well plate for 6 min and their absorbance was recorded at 734 nm using a spectrophotometer. The calibration was performed with 80 v/v% ethanolic solutions of known trolox concentrations (0.1–0.8 mmol/L) with a great linear relationship (r > 0.99). The results were presented as mM of trolox equivalent (mM TE)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effects of DESs,"3.1 Effects of DESs Fifteen alcohol-based DESs were produced via ultrasonication-assisted preparation method (Table 1). Both choline chloride and betaine series of DESs generally formed clear and homogeneous liquids after up to 1 h of ultrasonication in the bath, while the L-carnitine series of DESs required greater ultrasonication time in the bath (up to 5 h) to be made. Table 2 displays the viscosities and pH values of the original DESs and 75 v/v% DESs. The L-carnitine series of DESs exhibited higher viscosity than choline chloride and betaine series of DESs, which may be caused by the longer carbon chain (C7 > C5). These observations are in agreement with a study reported by Florindo et al.[36] where the shorter carbon chain of the hydrogen bond donor in the DES results in lower viscosity. High viscosity may impair the efficiency of extraction as slow mass transfer occurs in the system. The type and length of the carbon chain of the components used for preparing the DES could change the viscosity of DES and thus affect the extraction efficiency [37]. Furthermore, the addition of water into the DES can significantly decrease its viscosity [38–40]. The acceptable liquid viscosity for industrial use should be as low as possible and values less than 100 mPa*s have been suggested [38]. The low viscosity of the DES solution led to high diffusivity and hence improved the extraction performance [41]. Therefore, the DES samples were diluted to 75 v/v% with water to decrease their viscosities for enhancing the efficiency and ease of process ability. Generally, all of the DES samples prepared during this study satisfy a viscosity lower than 100 mPa*s after mixing with water. The pH value is another factor that affects the extraction efficiency. The pH values of the diluted DESs were close to neutral (pH = 5–9) which could reduce the acidic or basic effects during extraction. In addition, the neutral solutions with active products may be applied in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical fields directly. Fig. 1 shows the extraction yield of gingerols using the 75 v/v% DES solutions, ethanol and water with a solvent/solid ratio of 30/1 via ultrasonic extraction at 40 °C for 30 min. The HPLC detection limits of 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol and 10-gingerol were 0.014, 0.022 and 0.019 mg/g respectively. The extraction yields of the gingerols in water were under the detection limits, which indicated that the gingerol contents in diluted DESs were mainly obtained from DESs themselves. The 1,3-butanediol series of DESs exhibited superior extraction capability than other alcohol-based DES samples. Notably, three DESs, Bet-ButG, Lcat-TriG and Lcat-ButG, extracted a higher amount of gingerols than the traditional solvents (ethanol and water). Although the viscosities of DESs are typically higher than those of the traditional solvents (1.07 mPa*s for ethanol and 0.9 mPa*s for water), some of them still display better extraction ability. Many extraction studies of natural products with DESs [42–45] have reported, wherein the DESs could replace the organic solvents as extraction media due to their great extraction performance, which is in agreement with the results of this study. However, a clear explanation is not available, which explains the superior extraction performance of some DESs (Bet-ButG, Lcat-TriG and Lcat-ButG) than others. Fig. 2 shows the microstructure of the raw ginger powder before and after ultrasonic extraction in water, ethanol and the 75 v/v% Lcat-ButG DES baths. The raw ginger powder displayed a rough and coarse surface with many flakes (Fig. 2a), whereas the surface of ginger powder after ultrasonic extraction in ethanol and 75 v/v% Lcat-ButG DES baths displayed some breakages along the edges without any flakes (Fig. 2c and d). These results illustrated that both ethanol and Lcat-ButG DES destroyed the cells and cell walls as well as dissolved those weak flakes during extraction. However, the ginger powder extracted with water exhibited similar microstructure to that of the untreated powder (Fig. 2b), which is in agreement with extraction yield results, as the water extraction did not dissolve any gingerols but ethanol and Lcat-ButG DES did."
10,Effects of water content and ultrasonication-assisted extraction conditions,"3.2 Effects of water content and ultrasonication-assisted extraction conditions Fig. 3 illustrates the extraction yield of gingerols with the different water contents of the 1,3-butanediol series DESs. The 75 v/v% of DESs exhibited the best extraction performance compared to the DESs with other concentrations. The addition of water to the DES at a certain level can improve its extraction performance due to a significant reduction of its viscosity (Table 2), which results in a better mass-transfer. However, beyond this point, the presence of excess water in the DES led to negative effects such as the decline of ginger solubility in the extraction solvent and the disruption of hydrogen bond interconnections between the components in the DES system [46–48], which indicated that the dilution of DESs might affect their physicochemical properties (mainly viscosity) and applications. The ultrasonication-assisted extraction conditions were carried out using the 75 v/v% Lcat-ButG DES solution at different extraction temperatures, extraction times, and solvent/solid ratios to optimize the extraction conditions. The data presented in Fig. 4 a reveals the enhancement of the amounts of the extracted gingerols with increasing extraction temperatures up to 50 °C. In general, higher extraction temperatures lower the viscosity of the extraction solvent and thus improve extraction performance [49]. However, gingerols begin to degrade and decompose significantly when the temperature reaches greater than 60 °C during the extraction [7]. Therefore, 50 °C was selected as the suitable extraction temperature. Another consideration of the extraction conditions was the extraction duration, which was investigated over time ranging between 5 and 60 min. Fig. 4b demonstrates that the extraction ability expanded within 30 min, but the extraction yield of gingerols remained at a similar level during longer extraction times, as the dissolution was complete after 30 min. Similar trends were observed for the solvent/solid ratios, but the effect on the extraction performance was smaller, particularly between 30/1 and 60/1. Overall, the preferred ultrasonication-assisted extraction parameters for energy and cost saving were determined to be an extraction temperature of 50 °C, extraction time of 30 min and a solvent/solid ratio of 30/1. The extraction conditions were narrowed down as described in this section by employing an RSM approach for efficient optimisation of the conditions."
11,Response surface methodology,"3.3 Response surface methodology The effects of the three independent variables, the concentration of the DES (A: 25–75 v/v%), extraction time (B: 10–30 min) and extraction temperature (C: 30–50 °C), were investigated for optimization of ultrasonication-assisted extraction conditions based on the three single-factor experiments. The antioxidant assay was used to evaluate the quality of the gingerols extracted in the DES solutions. The Lcat-ButG DES solution was selected for further optimisation of the gingerols extraction conditions for performance and antioxidant capabilities by using the 20 runs of the CCD experimental design depicted in Table 3 . The results from the experiments of the CCD matrices for the highest gingerols yield were in agreement with those reported in the previous section, stating that the suggested extraction conditions were 75 v/v% DES with extraction temperature of 50 °C and extraction time of 30 min. The solubility rate of the target compounds was enhanced with higher extraction temperatures as the viscosity of the DES decreased and hence the rate of diffusion was increased in the system. However, the higher yield of the gingerols did not generally improve its antioxidant capability. Furthermore, the operating temperature had an important effect on the antioxidant activity of the extracts. The degradation of active products and the loss of the phenolic compounds might start to occur during high extraction temperatures [50–52]. The greatest FRAP value was obtained at the 14th run while the largest ABTS value was achieved at the 13th run. Both runs were performed at relatively lower temperatures (less than50 °C). Moreover, the 1st and 14th runs were carried out with the same DES concentration and extraction time but were treated at different temperatures. Despite its lower content of gingerols, the 14th run displayed better antioxidant performance, which indicated that the active products extracted are highly sensitive to high temperatures and may begin to decompose when the operating temperature reaches higher than 50 °C. The simulations of the experimental data by the Design-Expert 8.0 software package could predict the yield of gingerols, FRAP and ABTS values via second-order polynomial equations in the coded form as follows: Y i e l d = 3.48 + 0.63 ∗ A + 0.38 ∗ B + 0.33 ∗ C + 0.021 ∗ A ∗ B + 0.040 ∗ A ∗ C - 0.034 ∗ B ∗ C - 0.61 ∗ A 2 - 0.089 ∗ B 2 + 0.014 ∗ C 2 F R A P = 16.57 + 2.36 ∗ A + 2.65 ∗ B - 3.33 ∗ C + 1.60 ∗ A ∗ B - 0.93 ∗ A ∗ C - 2.07 ∗ B ∗ C - 4.80 ∗ A 2 - 2.33 ∗ B 2 - 1.51 ∗ C 2 A B T S = 22.56 + 3.26 ∗ A + 4.29 ∗ B - 0.50 ∗ C + 1.40 ∗ A ∗ B + 0.59 ∗ A ∗ C - 1.00 ∗ B ∗ C - 5.10 ∗ A 2 - 2.53 ∗ B 2 - 2.48 ∗ C 2 Fig. 5 displays the 3D response surface plots that illustrate the interaction effects between the variables affecting the yield of gingerols, FRAP and ABTS values. The highest yield of gingerols for the concentration of DES appeared at ~60 v/v% in Fig. 5a and b whereas both extended extraction time and temperature increased the extraction efficiency, as seen from Fig. 5c. However, the extraction temperature is an important factor which affects the antioxidant power and is not fully related to the yield of the gingerols. The data from Fig. 5e, f, h and i show that the extracts exhibit better antioxidant performance at lower extraction temperatures. The optimal extraction conditions from the simulation for obtaining reasonable content of the gingerols content and the maximum FRAP and ABTS values were 62.6 v/v% of DES, 30 min of extraction time and 34.1 °C of extraction temperature. A one-off experiment was performed with 63 v/v% Lcat-ButG DES at 35 °C with an extraction time of 30 min to examine the calculated optimal parameters. A slight difference was observed between the predicted extraction yield (3.78 mg/g) and the experimental result (3.82 mg/g), along with similar antioxidant assay results (FRAP: 20.36 vs. 20.94 mg TE/g and ABTS: 25.32 vs. 25.75 mg TE/g), which suggested that the RSM predication was appropriate and time-saving for determining the optimized processing conditions with the desired results. This approach has also been widely used in many studies, particularly in extraction fields [42,53–55]. In general, no significant difference was found between the values observed and predicted by this system."
12,Conclusions,"The alcohol-based DESs were successfully produced via an ultrasonication-assisted preparation method and formed stable and clear liquid mixtures. While the gingerols from ginger could be dissolved in the DESs themselves, the Bet-ButG, Lcat-TriG and Lcat-ButG DES samples displayed better extraction performance than the traditional solvents. Furthermore, the changes in the microstructures of the treated ginger powders demonstrated that the DES solutions broke the cells and cell walls, and also dissolved the weak flakes during extraction. A certain degree of the DES dilution with water could increase the diffusion in the system as the viscosity of DES decreases. The extraction temperature was determined to be an important consideration for maintaining the antioxidant capability of gingerols extracted and high operating temperatures could lead to their degradation and hence reduce their antioxidant ability. The suitable extraction conditions were determined via RSM with the maximum antioxidant ability and reasonable gingerols content. The simulated values were examined by practical experimentation and both results were similar. Therefore, RSM is a reliable and efficient method for determining the optimal extraction conditions. This study provided an example on the use of natural DES solutions for replacing VOSs and enable efficient extraction. Since all of the compounds used to produce DES were approved or regulated by the U.S. FDA. This suggested that the DES solution containing extracts has potential to be applied safely in cosmetic and pharmaceutical fields without additional steps of product isolation. Lastly, the ultrasonication-assisted synthesis can prepare DESs which not only consist of one solid (choline chloride, betaine and L-carnitine) with one liquid (alcohols) but also two different solids such as choline chloride plus urea. Another study discussed the ultrasonication-assisted synthesis for DESs produced by two solids is under preparation and will be submitted to a journal soon."
