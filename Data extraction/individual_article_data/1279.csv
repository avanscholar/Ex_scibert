0,Introduction,"Spontaneously solar-driven water splitting to produce H2 in the existence of photocatalyst is a highly promising pathway towards a clean and renewable energy supply in the future [1–11]. To increase the efficiency of hydrogen production, developing an efficient and stable photocatalyst which is able to accomplish maximum hydrogen evolution is meaningful [12–14]. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has elicited ripples of excitement in the research communities as the next generation photocatalyst, due to its facile synthesis, appealing electronic band structure, high physicochemical stability, and earth-abundant nature [15–19]. However, the efficiency of g-C3N4 is still limited due to the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs [20]. Thus, it still remains challenging to construct g-C3N4-based photocatalysts which carry efficient charge transfer and separation to drive hydrogen evolution reactions [21]. For further practical application of solar-driven water splitting, introducing co-catalysts is an auspicious solution that can promote water molecules adsorption, charge separation and transfer, and photocatalytic stability [7,22,23]. To improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, proper pick of co-catalysts which can not only improve the charge separation by capturing electrons or holes, but also favor the transfer of electron is vital [24]. Pt is an excellent catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, but its practical use is hindered by its high price and rarity [25–28]. The developed transition metal selenides systems, such as CoSe2, NiSe2, benefiting from their faster transformation efficiency of adsorbed H atoms into hydrogen and providing active sites of pyrite catalysts, are reported to be suitable water splitting catalysts [29–34]. Besides, compared with the other chalcogenides such as O and S, Se has a larger ionic radius with lower electronegativity, leading to the weak attraction to the outer electrons of cobalt, contributing to a promoted redox reaction rate [35]. Meanwhile, simple procedure and appropriate precursors should be chosen deliberately, aimed at obtaining efficient and stable cocatalysts easily. Based on the point above, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), as an important branch of metal organic frameworks MOFs synthesized by coordinating transition metals (Zn2+, Co2+) with imidazole ligands can be candidate for constructing photocatalyst or cocatalyst incorporated with g-C3N4 which has not been mentioned in previous reports [36–39]. Additionally, MOF-derived materials, such as ZIF-67 derivation cobalt selenide have been successfully applied in the field of electrocatalysis and electrochemistry [34,40–42]. The corresponding results show that the metal sites in MOF-derived materials can be stabilized and reinforced because of the accompanied surface coating in the calcination process which consists of carbon or metal oxide nanoparticles [34,43,44]. Thus, ZIF-67, which is rich in carbon, nitrogen and transition metals, easily prepared and very cost-effective, could be ideal solid-phase precursors for the synthesis of cocatalysts [36]. Further, we envisaged that the introduction of the transition metal selenides, in the form of nickel selenide and cobalt selenide would greatly enhance the ability of hydrogen evolution of g-C3N4. In addition, the intimately combination of co-catalysts on a semiconductor support is quite beneficial for charge separation, since the electron can be transferred faster. Herein, we design a g-C3N4-based photocatalyst by rationally introducing NiSe2 and CoSe2 as co-catalysts derived from Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 on g-C3N4 support for hydrogen evolution via a calcination process. Specifically, the calcination temperature of synthesizing CN-CoNiSe was set as 350 °C which is above the melting point of Se and below the decomposition temperature of g-C3N4. Owing to melt mixing method used in the formation of the g-C3N4-based photocatalyst, NiSe2, CoSe2 and g-C3N4 can be well connected and dispersed uniformly [45]. With the cocatalysts combined intimately, the electron-hole pairs activated by light would be easily dissociated and transferred into the active sites to participate in hydrogen evolution reactions. The as-obtained photocatalyst exhibited remarkable H2 production activities of 854.1 μmol h−1 g−1 in the absence of noble metal, outperforming g-C3N4 obviously."
1,Experimental,
2,Photocatalysts preparation,"2.1 Photocatalysts preparation Bulk g-C3N4 can be simply prepared by the thermal condensation of melamine. In a typical fabrication, melamine in a crucible was kept at 550 °C for 4 h and then cooled to room temperature. Thus, the yellow g-C3N4 was obtained. ZIF-67 was synthesized by a facile method according to previous publications [46]. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, 2-methylimidazole (2-Hmim) and methanol were mixed in a molar ratio of 1: 40: 1100 (Co/2-Hmim/methanol) following with vigorous agitation and ultrasonic dispersing for 1 h at room temperature. The dispersions were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, washed with methanol to remove excess soluble ions for at least 5 times, and dried. The obtained precipitate was dispersed in methanol, then added into Ni(NO3)2·6H2O methanol solution with a molar ratio of 1:1. Afterwards, the mixture was for ultrasonic dispersing 0.5 h. The dispersions were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, washed with methanol to remove excess soluble ions for at least 3 times, and dried in drying cabinet at 60 °C overnight. After volatilization of the methanol, Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 was obtained. And then it was crushed for further use. Ni2+ doped ZIF-67, g-C3N4 and Se powder were milled in a mortar for 15 min. Then, the mixture mentioned above was placed in a quartz boat in pipe furnace. The precursor was directly heated to 350 °C and kept for 2 h in a flowing 60 mL/min N2. The product was put into mortar, grinding into fine powder for further use. Through this method, samples with different Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 to g-C3N4 weight ratios (i.e., 2.5, 5, 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni2+ doped ZIF-67/g-C3N4) were obtained and labelled as CN-CoNiSe2.5, CN-CoNiSe5, CN-CoNiSe10 and CN-CoNiSe12.5, respectively. Additionally, the mass ratio of Se powder to Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 is 1:1. For comparison, CoSe2/g-C3N4 was prepared, following a similar procedure to that of CN-CoNiSe."
3,Characterizations of photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterizations of photocatalysts The composition, structure and texture properties of the materials were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Spectrum 100), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns (Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD apparatus), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs (Hitachi S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiment (JEM-2100 electron microscope). Optical properties were also studied by diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy (Lambda 35 spectrometer), photoluminescence spectrum (SPEX Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Mott-Schottky plot and photocurrent-time (I-T) profiles was recorded on the CHI660E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode cell at room temperature. The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. ITO glasses dipping with catalysts as working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode were used. The powder was fabricated onto ITO glass substrate electrodes via the uniformly dispersed by mixing catalyst with alcohol solutions for 30 min and dried for 24 h. Calomel electrode and 0.5 M sulphuric acid aqueous solution were used in linear sweep voltammetry."
4,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments Light driven H2 evolution reactions were conducted in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system fitted with a top window Pyrex cell (CEAULIGHT CEL-SPH2N). Prior to light irradiation, the system was vacuumed for 0.5 h to remove air with vacuum bump. In a typical reaction, 30 mg of photococatalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of 20 vol% triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution. Then the solution was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 320 nm) under vigorous stirring. Meanwhile, the photoreaction temperature was kept at 6 °C. The hydrogen evolved was determined by a GC112A gas chromatograph with TCD detector."
5,Results and discussion,"The morphology of as-synthesized particles is detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM image (Fig. S1a) exhibits the ZIF-67 rhomb dodecahedron with an average size of 300 nm was synthesized. After Ni2+ doping, the surface of the resulting crystal became irregular (Fig. S1b). It can be inferred that the add of Ni(NO3)2 contributes to the generation of protons from the hydrolysis of Ni2+ ions which can etch part of the ZIF-67 particles [46]. On the basis of that, the Co2+ ions are partially released from ZIF-67. Meanwhile, the Co2+ ions co-precipitate with Ni2+ ions to form the Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 particles. The PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized sample of Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 is identical to that of its simulated pattern of ZIF-67 from X-ray single crystal (Fig. S2), confirming the successful synthesis of Ni2+ doped ZIF-67. Even if Ni2+ was introduced, the basic structure of ZIF-67 remained. This phenomenon coincided well with the results obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S3). The strongest XRD peak (Fig. S4) at 27.4° (002) is a characteristic inter-planar stacking peak of conjugated aromatic systems of g-C3N4 [47]. Another distinct peak (100) at 13.0° can be attributed to an in-planar structural packing motif [48]. The FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S5) also displays two significant absorptions in the 900–1800 cm−1 region possibly resulting from the vibration characteristics of the s-triazine ring units and heptazine heterocyclic ring units, and 3100–3300 cm−1 indicating an N-H bending mode, respectively, representative of g-C3N4 [49–51]. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) exhibits the excellent thermal stability of the as-synthesized g-C3N4 (Fig. S6). Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized photocatalysts CN-CoNiSe, which show weaker pronounced diffraction peaks at 27.4° and 13.0° than g-C3N4 because of the doping of cocatalysts [52], indicating that the basic structure of g-C3N4 was not destroyed [24]. This is consistent with the observation from FT-IR spectra in Fig. 1b, in which there are two significant absorptions. Besides, weak CoSe2 and NiSe2 peaks can be observed in the XRD patterns for all the calcined CN-CoNiSe with different additions of Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 in the precursors due to the existence of small volume fraction of metal selenides in catalysts. As the JCPDS card file of CoSe2 provided, the diffraction peaks at 34.5°, 35.9°, and 47.7° can be assigned to the (111), (120), and (211) planes of CoSe2, respectively. Meanwhile, the peaks of NiSe2 can be recognized at 33.5°, 36.8° and 50.6°, in accordance with the (210), (211) and (311) planes from the JCPDS card of NiSe2. TEM image in Fig. 1c exhibited that the CN-CoNiSe5 photocatalyst contained CoSe2 and NiSe2 particles of approximately 10 nm in diameter well dispersed on the g-C3N4 support. In addition, the g-C3N4, CoSe2 and NiSe2 particles are fully contacted with each other. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1d showed the lattice fringes of CoSe2 and NiSe2 particles. For detail, the interplanar spacing of 0.259 nm was consistent with the spacing of (111) plane of CoSe2, while 0.267 nm was corresponding to the spacing of (210) plane of NiSe2. The existence of small amount of Ni, Co and Se in the catalyst can be further indicated by XPS and EDS results, described below. Smooth and flat layers of g-C3N4 could be clearly seen in SEM images of CN-CoNiSe5 photocatalyst in Fig. 2a. It can be suggested that hierarchical structure facilitated the efficient transport of electrons and holes. The corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of Co, Ni and Se in Fig. 2b–d showed uniform dispersion on the g-C3N4 surface. The EDS pattern (Fig. S7) also indicated that CN-CoNiSe5 contained Ni, Co and Se elements. Meanwhile, it can be confirmed that Se powder is an efficient Se supplier and selenides have been produced. The polyvalent states of metal ions on the photocatalysts have also been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As seen in Fig. 3a, the CN-CoNiSe5 photocatalyst is composed of C, N, O, Co, Ni and Se elements. The XPS spectrum of C 1s (Fig. S8a) shows two peaks at binding energies of 284.9 and 287.8 eV. The peak located at 284.9 eV is assigned to the C–C bond and the peak at 287.8 eV is due to the carbon atom bonded to three nitrogen atoms in the CN lattice nitrogen, represents another characteristic peak of g-C3N4 [53]. The N1s peak (Fig. S8b) at 398.6 eV represents aromatic N in triazine rings [54]. It is noted that the binding energy at 853.2 eV accompanied by satellite bands in Fig. 3b is corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 which surely confirms the presence of NiSe2 in CN-CoNiSe photocatalyst [50]. As shown in Fig. 3c, The binding energies at 781 and 796.2 eV correspond to Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively. Meanwhile, satellite peaks can also be found at 778.9 and 793 eV. The existence of Co2+ can be confirmed [55]. The binding energies of Se 3d5/2, 3d3/2, and SeOx in Fig. 3d are located at 54.3, 55.0, and 59.2 eV, respectively [56]. These results provided further insight about the newly formed selenides. Hydrogen production experiments were carried out over CN-CoNiSe samples. Notably, CN-CoNiSe5 demonstrated higher activity than that of CN-CoNiSe2.5, CN-CoNiSe10, and CN-CoNiSe12.5, as shown in Fig. 4a, the hydrogen production was at a rate of over 854.1 μmol g−1 h−1 in detail, and the maximum hydrogen yield approached 1690 μmol g−1 in 4 h. When the percentage increased above 5%, the hydrogen production shows decease tendency. We can infer that excessive amounts of cocatalysts will hinder the light absorption and contribute to a decreased activity and active sites in cocatalysts should be kept at an appropriate level. Additionally, the hydrogen production rate decreased slightly with the increase of the irradiation time in Fig. 4b, which can be explained by the continuous consumption of the triethanolamine [50]. In contrast experiments, CN-CoNiSe exhibited excellent hydrogen production activity which surpassed g-C3N4 and CoSe2/g-C3N4 (Fig. S9), indicating that the introduction of NiSe2 is essential to excellent H2 evolution property of the resulting composite. The result of contrast experiments also indicates the synergistic effect between CoSe2 and NiSe2. The positive effects of the synergistic effect on photocatalytic hydrogen production can be inferred as follows. First, the diffusion of electrons was optimized and H–H bond formation on two adjacently adsorbed H atoms might be prompted, lowering the kinetic energy barrier for H2 evolution [57,58]. More active sites were offered for hydrogen production. Second, the differences in electronegativity between Ni and Co might offer more electron transport pathways. Thus, electron transfer was enhanced and the reaction kinetics has greatly increased [59]. Notably, the hydrogen production activity of CN-CoNiSe is even better than that of Pt-deposited g-C3N4 (Fig. S10). Focus on practical application, stability and durability are important factors in hydrogen production reaction. Thus, we performed photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments over CN-CoNiSe5 photocatalyst by time-cycles under similar conditions. In the case of the H2 recycling test, it was observed that up to the 3rd cycle the activity was almost constant (Fig. S11). Meanwhile, the sample was characterized by XRD and FT-IR after reaction (Fig. S12). Compared with fresh catalyst, no obvious change was observed by these characterization methods, demonstrating the durable property of CN-CoNiSe5 photocatalyst. To further study the photocatalytic mechanism of CN-CoNiSe5, the following characterizations has also been given. Fig. 4c shows the transient photocurrent response of CN-CoNiSe5 and g-C3N4 photocatalyst under simulated solar light illumination. The photocurrent of the CN-CoNiSe5 electrode is about 4 times as high as that of g-C3N4, indicating a higher photocurrent density of CN-CoNiSe5 electrode. In Fig. 4d, g-C3N4 exhibits a strong emission peak centered at 470 nm, which could be attributed to the band–band PL phenomenon with the energy of light approximately [60]. Actually, the band–band PL signal can be ascribed to excitonic PL, which was mainly caused by the n–π* electronic transitions involving lone pairs of nitrogen atoms in g-C3N4 [61]. Obviously, the position of the emission peak in the PL spectra of CN-CoNiSe5 were similar to that of the pure g-C3N4, but the emission intensity significantly decreased, indicating that a notable depression of the electron–hole recombination in CN-CoNiSe5 had much lower recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers. This is in good agreement with the photocatalytic results. UV–vis spectrum of CN-CoNiSe5 (Fig. S13) exhibits a broad absorption band [38], indicating that the sunlight can be absorbed, took advantage by CN-CoNiSe and excited the separation of electron and hole. According to the following formula E g = 1240/λ, the band gap of g-C3N4 can be calculated which is 2.85 V. Notably, the absorption of CN-CoNiSe photocatalysts is not enhanced obviously compared with g-C3N4, demonstrating charge separation and transfer may act as the key functional factor. Mott–Schottky plots confirm the photocatalytic hydrogen production ability of CN-CoNiSe. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the positive slope of the obtained C−2 to the potential plot is consistent with that of typical n-type semiconductors at frequencies of 10,000, 5000 and 2000 Hz [62]. Meanwhile, the intersection points do not depend on the different frequencies applied. The flat band position (Vfb) determined from the intersection is approximately − 0.59 V vs. Ag/AgCl (i.e. −0.39 V vs. NHE) for CN-CoNiSe. Since it is generally believed that the bottom of the conduction band in many n-type semiconductors is more negative than the flat band potential [63,64], the conduction band (LUMO) of CN-CoNiSe can be estimated to be − 0.49 V vs. NHE, which is more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2 (−0.41 V vs. NHE, pH = 7) [65], satisfying thermodynamic requirements in the process of photocatalytic decomposition of water and hydrogen production. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results in Fig. 5c exhibit smaller semicircular diameter of Nyquist curves of CN-CoNiSe5 than that of sole g-C3N4 which demonstrates a smaller interfacial charge-transfer resistance leading to acceleration of interfacial charge transfer. Thus, electron can be utilized efficiently. To further highlight the role of NiSe2 in improving the photogenerated charge separation, linear sweep voltammetry curves of CoSe2/g-C3N4, CN-CoNiSe5 were carried out (Fig. S14). Obviously, CN-CoNiSe5 exhibits lower electrocatalytic hydrogen production overpotential than CoSe2/g-C3N4, indicating that NiSe2 is benefit for photocatalytic hydrogen production [66]. Experiments on surface hydrophilicity were carried out (Fig. S15) [67]. In Fig. 5d, CN-CoNiSe5 shows a smaller contact angle of 33° than 45.5° of g-C3N4, indicating a more hydrophilic surface of CN-CoNiSe5 brought about by OH groups on the photocatalyst, which will improve water adsorption and subsequent proton reduction [68]. On the basis of the above experimental results, a possible mechanism for hydrogen production was proposed as follows ( Fig. 6): g-C3N4 could generate electrons and holes because of the transfer of excited electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) under irradiation. The excited electrons migrate to the surface of g-C3N4 and then to transition metal selenides immediately, photo-generated charges recombination is reduced. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of NiSe2 and CoSe2 enhances both the exposure of active sites and electron transfer. That leads to higher photochemical transmission efficiency in CN-CoNiSe. The H+ ions accept the electrons from the transition metal selenides to produce hydrogen. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes left behind in the valence band react with TEOA. The photocatalytic hydrogen production on the catalyst is greatly beneficial for the enhanced electron-hole separation, the inhibited photo-generated charges recombination and the prolonged lifetime of charge carriers in CN-CoNiSe. As a consequence, the photocatalytic activities of CN-CoNiSe photocatalysts surpass that of g-C3N4."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, CN-CoNiSe photocatalysts have been successfully developed for hydrogen production from water by calcination under a nitrogen atmosphere with different mass contents of Ni2+ doped ZIF-67 in precursors on the g-C3N4 support. The obtained CN-CoNiSe photocatalysts exhibit efficient and stable properties in hydrogen production reaction process without introducing noble metal. Experimental data confirmed that CN-CoNiSe5 photocatalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (up to 87.4 times as high as that of the pure g-C3N4). The signally increased photocatalytic performance of CN-CoNiSe photocatalysts was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of NiSe2, CoSe2 and g-C3N4, resulting in enhanced charge transfer and separation rate. The new design presented in this study can be extended for the application of g-C3N4 and the prospect is rather considerable."
