0,Introduction,"With the increased demand for sustainable energy sources, fuel cells are attracting much attention as an alternative solution capable of altering the conventional fossil fuel-based energy system due to their high efficiency and clean effluent characteristics [1,2]. To meet such public needs, so far, the fuel cells that can be used for the assorted operating conditions including temperature, fuel and application, have been introduced. Among them, membraneless fuel cells are promising because membrane, which has the worst reliability and limits the structure and shape of device, is not required for the membraneless fuel cells [3–5]. To use these membraneless fuel cells, the electrode should have superior reaction selectivity to alleviate the mixed potential attributed to unseparated fuels. In this regard, enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs) are appropriate. EBCs utilize enzymes as catalysts due to their excellent reaction selectivity [6,7]. However, the use of these catalysts is confined only to medical purposes because their sluggish reaction rate corresponding to the nature of enzymes prevents the generation of high power [8,9]. Another membraneless fuel cell option is hydrogen peroxide fuel cells (HPFCs) that use H2O2 as the fuel for both electrodes. Differently from EBCs, HPFCs use the same H2O2 fuel for both oxidation and reduction reactions, implying that in HPFCs, catalysts imported for both electrodes should have excellent reaction selectivity [10,11]. By this unique concept, when HPFCs are exploited as the airless system, they can be considered as power source in extreme spaces, such as aerospace and deep sea, and their size and shape are flexibly controlled [12,13]. Furthermore, HPFCs can act as a power supply system of portable devices, resolving the critical drawbacks of conventional fuel cells attributed to hydrogen fuel [13,14]. So far, the bulk metal materials, such as Ni, Pt, Ag and Au, were employed as the anodic catalysts of HPFC [15–17]. However, such trials were mostly failed because these bulk metals, especially, Ni was easy to corrode and the corroded Ni induced a poor reliability of fuel cell under the conditions of H2O2 fuel and strong alkaline (or acidic) electrolyte, while the other bulk metals may be quite expensive and show poor performances in HPFCs [10,18]. Therefore, it is important to develop a cheap catalyst with high corrosion resistance to H2O2. Recently, a new anode using Vitamin B12 was suggested to address this problem. Vitamin B12 is a biomaterial that participates in the metabolism of living organisms, and this can act as the catalyst for activating hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction (HPOR) by improving the redox reactivity of Co core ions within Vitamin B12 [19]. The main structure of Vitamin B12 is similar to Co-phthalocyanine (CoPc), but CoPc is more valuable as a HPOR catalyst because the CoPc based catalyst offers better performance through electrochemical activation and the use of axial ligand. However, there are still shortcomings related to its commercial use due to the high extraction cost and the complicated pretreatment procedure that is required [20]. In this study, a new catalyst that uses low cost materials and a simple preparation procedure is suggested. To accomplish this, CoPc acts as the active site for the HPOR, while reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) composite are considered as the supporting materials to link the electrode and CoPc. Although the use of a CoPc based catalyst for the HPOR has been reported previously as the catalyst of sensor for H2O2 sensing, its use as catalyst for the HPFCs has been hardly reported [21,22]. Thus, the main originality of this study to develop membraneless HPFC system using a CoPc based catalyst with the combination of PAA and rGO composite to enhance the immobilization, performance and durability of CoPc. More specifically, with the use of PAA, which acts as an axial ligand to connect with the Co core, it is expected that the current density of the HPOR will be significantly increased [23,24]. Accordingly, the suggested catalyst will likely have a positive impact on improving the performance and durability for the HPOR and membraneless HPFCs. Furthermore, this membraneless HPFC outperforms previously reported HPFCs despite the fact that the HPFC proposed in this study is intended for operation under harsh physiological conditions, indicating that the HPFC is viable for various applications in physiological condition. In summary, to examine the effect of PAA on the performance and durability for HPOR and membraneless HPFC, a new rGO/PAA/CoPc catalyst is suggested and its performance is compared with that of a control catalyst synthesized without PAA (rGO/CoPc). Additionally, the various polymers, such as polyacrylic acid-co-maleic acid (PAAMA), polyvinyl acid (PVA), polyethyleneimine(PEI) and poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA), are assessed as surface modifier of rGO and their performances are compared with that using rGO/PAA/CoPc to verify the axial ligand and stabilizing effects by carboxylic acid group within PAA. The polarization curves of membraneless HPFCs using rGO/PAA/CoPc and rGO/CoPc are also measured to confirm the aforementioned effects."

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Polyacrylic acid (PAA, 50% (w/v) solution) was purchased from Aladdin (China) and Nafion 117 solution, isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.0%), hydrogen peroxide (30% in water), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.0%) were purchased from Samchun Pure Chemical Co., Ltd. (Mogok-dong, Pyeongtaek City, Gyeonggi-do, Korea). Phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.01 mol L-1, pH 7.4) was purchased from Life Technologies. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO, surface area 400–500 m2 g−1) was purchased from Standard Graphene (Ulsan, Korea)."
3,Fabrication of catalysts,"2.2 Fabrication of catalysts rGO/CoPc was fabricated through a π- π bond between rGO and CoPc. For the synthesis, 10 mg of rGO was mixed with 5 mL of a CoPc solution (1 mmolL−1 dissolved in DMF and TFA) and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the surplus of CoPc was removed by washing with DMF. To fabricate the rGO/PAA/CoPc, 10 mg of rGO was mixed with 5 mL of a PAA solution (5 mgmL−1 in water). This mixture was then sonicated for 10 min and stirred for 2 h. Excessive PAA was removed by washing with deionized (DI) water (rGO/PAA). The rGO/PAA was then immersed in the CoPc solution for 2 h and the surplus of CoPc was removed by washing with DMF. In addition, rGO/polymer (PAAMA, PVA, PEI and PDDA)/CoPc catalysts were fabricated with the same method used to fabricate rGO/PAA/CoPc. The polymer concentration was 5 mgmL−1 in water. [CNT/PEI]/hemin was synthesized following the reported method [25]. Briefly, 10 mL of PEI solution (2.5 mgmL−1 in DI water) was injected into 10 mg of CNT and stirred for 2 h, and then centrifuged for 7 min. After that, 1 mL of hemin solution (5 mgmL−1 in DMF) was mixed with centrifuged CNT/PEI and stirred for 2 h."
4,Electrochemical characterizations,"2.3 Electrochemical characterizations Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and amperometric response experiments were conducted in a three electrode cell using a Bio-Logic SP-240 electrochemical workstation. The synthesized catalysts were coated onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, diameter of 5 mm), which was then used as the working electrode. Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (sat. in 3.0 M NaCl) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. For loading of the catalysts, 10 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded on the GCE and then dried 30 min. After drying, 4 μL of 0.5 wt% Nafion solution was loaded for 10 min to prevent leaching out of catalyst. The CV and amperometric response experiments were carried out in a 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4), with high-purity N2 gas injected into the electrolyte solution to maintain a specific atmosphere. To measure the polarization curves of the HPFC, a flow type membraneless fuel cell was designed [19,26]. As the fuel, 0.1 M H2O2 was dissolved in 0.01 M PBS while purging with N2, and the fuel was circulated from an external bottle at a flow rate of 0.1 mLmin-1."
5,Optical and chemical characterizations,"2.4 Optical and chemical characterizations Microstructure analysis of all samples were conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The samples were analyzed with a high-vacuum SEM microscope (Inspect F, FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, United States) equipped with an EDS module capable of elemental microanalysis. To confirm the coordinate bond with Co core within CoPc and PAA, absorption spectra of CoPc solution (0.1 mmolL−1 in DMF and TFA) and CoPc + PAA mixture was performed using UV–Vis spectrometer. A CoPc + PAA mixture was mixed with 5 mL of CoPc solution (0.1 mmolL−1 in DMF and TFA) and 20 mg of PAA."
6,Results and discussion,
7,The effect of PAA on the immobilization of CoPc,"3.1 The effect of PAA on the immobilization of CoPc To evaluate the effect of PAA on the immobilization of CoPc, SEM and EDS analysis are performed (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). In terms of SEM images, there were no clear differences between rGO/CoPc and rGO/PAA/CoPc (Fig. 1). However, the atomic percentage of Co within rGO/PAA/CoPc increased twice more than that within rGO/CoPc. This means that CoPc molecules are seized more tightly on the surface of rGO when PAA is adopted, and this confirms that PAA is an effective adhesive to immobilize CoPc molecules onto rGO surface. In addition, this highlights two main effects of PAA. First, with the use of PAA, (i) physical entrapment occurs due to the long chain of PAA, and (ii) a coordinate bond arises between the oxygen of PAA and the Co core within CoPc. Specifically, the polymeric network of PAA plays a crucial role in capturing CoPc molecules, and this prevents the leaching out of CoPc molecules from the rGO surface. In addition, the oxygen atoms contained in the carboxylic acid group within PAA can act as ligands to connect to the Co core within the CoPc [6,24,27]. Fig. 2 also supports the role of axial ligand in rGO/PAA/CoPc. Both spectra have significant Q band peaks at near 670 and 610 nm, representing the π-π* transition (transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)), with the Soret band (B band) near 350 nm representing electron dipole movement [28,29]. The intensity of three peaks in the two spectra appears to be mostly constant, meaning that the Co cores in two samples are in the Co2+ state. However, the intensity of two other broad peaks observed at 440 and 540 nm is clearly higher in the CoPc and PAA mixture. Therefore, these peaks are evidence showing the formation of a charge transfer band between the metal and the ligand, indicating that the Co cores in the two samples are coordinated differently with the other materials [30]. This also explains that PAA acts as a ligand for the connection with the CoPc core, and it is anticipated that rGO/PAA/CoPc will show different electrochemical behaviors from rGO/CoPc due to the effect of PAA."
8,Electrochemical behaviors,"3.2 Electrochemical behaviors To investigate the HPOR activity of the catalysts, the CV curves of rGO/CoPc and rGO/PAA/CoPc were measured (Fig. 3 ). In rGO/CoPc, anodic current was generated after 0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and increased smoothly to 0.6 V in a 5 mmolL−1 H2O2 solution, while the current density reached 162.4 μAcm−2 at 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Regarding the onset potential, that of rGO/PAA/CoPc was approximately 0.03 V, similar to that of rGO/CoPc. However, in rGO/PAA/CoPc, a clear peak close to 0.35 V was observed, and the current density at 0.4 V (433.9 μAcm−2) was 2.7 times higher than that of rGO/CoPc as the amount of CoPc was increased by nearly double. This implies that there is another HPOR pathway promoted by PAA at approximately 0.35 V, and as the other HPOR pathway, the Co(II)/Co(III) redox reaction whose half-wave potential peak is observed at approximately 0.4 V at a neutral pH is plausible [31,32]. Taken together, these findings suggest that the anodic current observed after 0.03 V is produced by the redox reaction of Co(I)/Co(II) (HPOR I-II), which is known as a normal reaction pathway for the HPOR when CoPc-based catalysts are used [33,34], whereas the anodic current observed at 0.35 V is attributed to the redox reaction of Co(II)/Co(III) (HPOR II-III) (Fig. 4 ). This is in good agreement with a recent report that described the reaction mechanism of the HPOR using vitamin B12 (cobalamin), the structure of which is similar to that of CoPc [19]. According to that study, the redox reaction of Co(II)/Co(III) can trigger the HPOR at approximately 0.35 V in a physiological condition, as shown in Fig. 3b, confirming that PAA is an excellent promoter that facilitates the catalytic activity of CoPc for the HPOR II-III pathway. To evaluate the effect of PAA on the reaction route of HPOR further, four catalysts are synthesized using different polymers as a surface modifier of rGO and the corresponding CV curves for the HPOR are measured (Fig. 4). According to Fig. 4, surprisingly, the catalysts using PAAMA and PVA (rGO/PAAMA/CoPc and rGO/PVA/CoPc, Fig. 4a and b), which have a structure similar to that of PAA, showed a similar clear peak at approximately 0.35 V with high current densities (346.8 and 228.7 μAcm−2). In contrast, there was no distinct peak in the catalysts using PEI and PDDA (rGO/PEI/CoPc and rGO/PDDA/CoPc, Fig. 4c and d), although their current densities were improved somewhat more (200.7 and 258.7 μAcm−2) than that of rGO/CoPc. These results demonstrate that the catalytic activity for the HPOR is enhanced by the physical entrapment between the polymeric surface modifier and the CoPc moiety. However, only carboxylic groups, which contain abundant oxygen atoms, can promote the HPOR II-III pathway of CoPc, as shown in rGO/PAA/CoPc. In short, oxygen-based functional groups of surface modifiers can affect the reaction mechanism of the catalysts. The expected HPOR reaction mechanism of rGO/PAA/CoPc is illustrated in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5, in CoPc moiety that is physically entrapped for HPOR I-II pathway (Fig. 5a), Co2+ core ions are reduced to Co+ ions by H2O2, then these are oxidized to Co2+ ions with the production of anodic current. Co3+ core ions are then reduced again to Co2+ ions by H2O2 due to the role as axial ligand of carboxylic acid group within PAA [35,36]. However, when the oxygen axial ligand is coordinated (Fig. 5b, HPOR II-III), Co2+ ions are firstly oxidized to Co3+ state with the generation of anodic current, then Co3+ core ions are back to Co2+ ions by H2O2 due to the axial ligand. Moreover, it is known that electron-donating ligand such as carboxylic acid group can shift the redox potential of complexes more negatively, and the uncoordinated free carboxylic acid group can enhance the catalytic activity of complexes by stabilizing the intermediates through the formation of hydrogen bond [36–39]. With that, rGO/CoPc is only controlled by HPOR I-II pathway, whereas rGO/PAA/CoPc is handled by both HPOR I-II and HPOR II-III pathways within the given potential range, and this induces a better activity for HPOR."
9,The performance of rGO/PAA/CoPc catalyst for HPFC,"3.3 The performance of rGO/PAA/CoPc catalyst for HPFC The major concern expected during the operation of a HPFC is the effect of H2O2 on the performance of the HPFC because H2O2 acts as a potent oxidizer, corroding the components of the HPFC, especially the electrode. Thus, it is crucial to investigate whether the suggested electrode containing catalysts works properly [10,18]. For evaluating this, the amperometric response of rGO/PAA/CoPc is measured and compared with that of bulk Ni electrode, which is normally utilized as an anodic catalyst in HPFCs (Fig. 6 ). As shown in Fig. 6, after 2 h of operation, the decreased current density rates of the HPOR catalyzed by bulk Ni and rGO/CoPc were 30.6 and 24.7%, respectively, whereas rGO/PAA/CoPc retained 90.0% of its initial value. This implies the conventional bulk Ni and rGO/CoPc are considerably vulnerable to corrosion by H2O2, whereas the suggested rGO/PAA/CoPc has a strong resistance to the corrosive H2O2 due to the CoPc moiety that is tightly immobilized by PAA surface modifier. Next, the maximum power density (MPD) is measured to evaluate the performance of catalysts in an actual driving condition. The flow cell type membraneless HPFC kit is utilized for the measurement, and carbon nanotube that immobilized by hemin and polyethyleneimine composite ([CNT/PEI]/Hemin) is used as the cathodic catalyst [19,25,26]. All the tests are conducted in physiological condition (pH 7.4) with a low H2O2 concentration of 0.1 mol L-1 (Fig. 7 ). As shown in Fig. 7, HPFC using rGO/CoPc based anode showed open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.254 ± 0.006 V and MPD of 38.3 ± 0.20 μWcm−2. However, HPFC using rGO/PAA/CoPc based anode showed 1.9 times higher MPD (72.1 ± 2.68 μWcm−2) and similar OCV (0.260 ± 0.006 V). These indicate the performance of flow type membraneless HPFC including rGO/PAA/CoPc is dependent on the activity of anodic reaction, and rGO/PAA/CoPc plays a crucial role in determining the performance of HPFC. This MPD is noticeably better than those in previously published results pertaining to HPFCs, despite the fact that the HPFC in this case is operated under a harsh physiological condition. For example, the MPD and OCV of an HPFC using Ni and Prussian blue catalysts operated under an acidic condition (pH 3, 0.3 mol L-1 H2O2) were 60 μW cm−2 and 0.44 V, while those of an HPFC using Ni oxide and Ag oxide operated under an alkaline condition (0.2 mol L-1 KOH, 0.05 mol L-1 H2O2) was 28.7 μW cm−2 and 0.1 V. Furthermore, in our previous report, when CNT/vitamin B12 and CNT/hemin were considered as anodic and cathodic catalysts, under a physiological condition (0.01 mol L-1 PBS (pH 7.4), 0.1 mol L-1 H2O2), the MPD and OCV of the HPFC were 0.233 V and 53.8 μW cm−2 [15,16,19]. This supports the contention that the proposed HPFC structure and catalyst are excellent options for use in public applications under physiological conditions."
10,Conclusions,"A new rGO/PAA/CoPc catalyst developed for use as the anode of a flow type membraneless HPFC that showed excellent performance and durability was fabricated using low-cost materials and a facile process. For doing that, CoPc was immobilized onto rGO with the help of PAA as a surface modifier. The CoPc moiety containing PAA could be tightly immobilized for three reasons, such as the formation of physical entrapment, the formation of an axial ligand by the carboxylic acid group, and the stabilization of intermediates. An EDS analysis demonstrated that the amount of CoPc immobilized by the use of PAA (rGO/PAA/CoPc) was twice than that of CoPc immobilized without PAA (rGO/CoPc). This occurs because when the PAA is not used, rGO and CoPc are weakly connected by means of π-π conjugation. In addition, a UV–Vis analysis proved that PAA acted as an axial ligand to form a coordinate bond with the Co core within CoPc. These effects activated HPOR II-III pathway as well as HPOR I-II pathway. Accordingly, when the CV curve of rGO/PAA/CoPc was measured, a significant peak was observed at 0.35 V, and the current density for the HPOR observed at 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was 2.7 times higher than that measured in rGO/CoPc. In contrast, the HPOR catalyzed by rGO/CoPc was only associated with HPOR I-II pathway. The effect of PAA was confirmed by comparisons with other surface modifiers, specifically PAAMA, PVA, PEI and PDDA. According to these measurements, the carboxylic acid group included in rGO/PAA/CoPc prompted an increase in the catalytic activity. Even in an amperometric response test, rGO/PAA/CoPc retained 90.0% of its initial HPOR current density for 2 h, whereas that of the Ni bulk normally used as a catalyst material in HPFCs decreased by 30.6%. This implies that rGO/PAA/CoPc can function as an alternative to bulk metal-based anodes to alleviate their poor reliability in HPFCs. Finally, the performances of HPFCs were measured to verify the outcome of rGO/PAA/CoPc under actual driving circumstances. A flow type membraneless HPFCs using rGO/PAA/CoPc and [CNT/PEI]/hemin as anodic and cathodic catalysts showed superior MPD (72.1 ± 2.68 μW cm−2), whereas the corresponding outcomes with rGO/CoPc and [CNT/PEI]/hemin were only 38.3 ± 0.20 μW cm−2 with a low concentration of H2O2 (0.1 mol L-1) under a physiological condition (pH 7.4). These results taken together imply that the proposed HPFC structure and catalyst are appropriate for the use in public applications operated under physiological conditions."
