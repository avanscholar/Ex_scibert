0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is regarded as a clean and high gravimetric density energy source to replace traditional fossil fuels [1–3]. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in electrochemical water splitting is one of the promising ways to economically produce high-purity hydrogen. Currently, the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for hydrogen production is composed of platinum (Pt)-based catalysts and it has several drawbacks such as high-cost, limited reserves, and poor electrochemical stability. Even though non-noble metal materials have been widely explored as enhanced catalysts for hydrogen production, the greatest challenge for the use of non-noble metal materials so far is that their HER activities still underperform Pt-based catalysts and they are susceptible to debase stability in a wide pH range [4,5]. In view of the inevitable local pH change of the electrolyte near the electrode surface during the prolonged electrolysis process, the ideal catalyst should perform equally well in different pH conditions for energy-efficient water splitting. Though there has been some progress in recent years, the development of cost-effective catalysts with long-term stability and pH tolerance still remains challenging. To date owing to their Pt-like catalytic properties, ruthenium (Ru)-based compounds, such as Ru/C3N4/C, Ru@C2N, and RuP2/NPC have recently attention as promising electrocatalysts with efficient electrochemical activities for hydrogenation reactions [6–8]. Especially, Ru has similar electronic features with Pt and thus exhibits promising potential in electrocatalytic water splitting due to a suitable hydrogen adsorption/desorption energy balance. The reported Ru-based catalysts, however, have still far from satisfactory at wide pH in terms of undesirable aggregation or inevitable active-sites decay during the electrochemical process. From the viewpoint of the substrate to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability, a two-dimensional (2D) graphitic substrate can provide great opportunities for enhancing the electrochemical performances from rationally engineering [9–13]. From the numerous researches about the graphitic-based substrate, it is well-known that substitution of heteroatoms could lead to the activation of graphitic surface for electrochemical reactions and edge-sites of graphitic heteroatom exhibited much superior (electro)catalytic properties than those of basal carbons [14–17]. Furthermore, the modification of the edge sites induces favorable local electronic structure toward electrochemical activity and high doping ratio of substitution. Encouraged by this consideration, in this work, we report Ru nanoparticles anchored at edge-selectively nitrogenated graphitic nanoplatelets (Ru-ENG) via physicochemical radicalization process. The edge-selectively nitrogenated graphitic nanoplatelets (ENG) exposed to an abundant anchoring edge-sites for Ru metal without severe damages on the carbon basal plane, leading to superior conductivities and electrochemical activities for HER. A series of practical experiments, XAFS, XPS, and DFT calculations suggested that enhancement of HER in universal-pH media was attributed to the spontaneous electron re-construction between N of edge-site and ruthenium particles (Ru–N) in Ru-ENG catalyst. In addition, the active edge sites in both of armchair (AC)- and zigzag (ZZ)-ENG lead to favorable hydrogen binding energy (-ΔEbind, H2) and the water decomposition energy (-ΔErxn, H2O) of the icosahedron cluster, Ru13, in Ru-ENG. With these unique advantages, the Ru-ENG catalyst exhibited faster reaction kinetics with lower Tafel slope and higher turnover frequency (TOF) than those of benchmark Pt/C catalyst in universal-pH conditions. In the application of water-splitting, the Ru-ENG electrode exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activities for HER over 1,500 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2, which is far superior and stable performance compared to the benchmark Pt/C and other reported electrodes. This physicochemical approach of edge-selectively hetero-atom substitution for HER electrocatalyst offers great potential to be used as the industrial viability of electrochemical HER in various pH-conditions."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Synthesis of ENG [18],"2.1 Synthesis of ENG [18] ENG was synthesized by the ball-milling process using the pristine graphite flake in the ball-mill machine (Pulverisette 6, Fritsch) in the presence of nitrogen (N2). The stainless-steel balls (500.0 g, diameter 5 mm) and the pristine graphite (5.0 g, Alfa Aesar, natural graphite, 100 mesh (<150 mm), 99.9995% metals basis, Lot#14735) were put into a stainless-steel ball-mill capsule (500 mL). After five charging-discharging cycles with N2, the capsule was sealed and fully charged with N2 (8 bar of cylinder pressure). It was placed on the planetary ball-mill instrument and operated at 500 rpm for 48 h. The product was Soxhlet extracted with methanol and 1 M aq. HCl solution to remove impurities. The final product (ENG) was freeze-dried at −120 °C under reduced pressure (0.05 mmHg) for 48 h."
3,Synthesis of Ru-ENG,"2.2 Synthesis of Ru-ENG ENG (1.5 g) was dispersed in de-ionized (DI) water (1 L) with sonication for 1 h. RuCl3∙H2O (0.5 g) and trisodium citrate (0.9 g) was dissolved in DI water (0.4 L). The two solutions were mixed and vigorously stirred for 24 h. And then, NaBH4 (0.3 M aq. Solution, 0.25 L) was slowly added and stirred for 12 h under the room temperature. The obtained precipitate was filtered via vacuum filtration using polytetrafluoroethylene (0.5 μm) membrane. The black powder was washed sufficiently with DI water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. After drying, the powder was annealed at 600, 700, and 800 °C for 3 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1."
4,Structural characterization,"2.3 Structural characterization The crystal structures of Ru-ENG catalyst were conducted by using a high-resolution TEM (JEOL, JEM-2100F). The phase identification of Ru-ENG was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Bruker diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation) with a scanning rate of 1° min−1 in the 2 θ range of 10–80°. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in air at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer Q200 TA Instrument. The surface area of sample was calculated by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method on BELSORP-mini. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were conducted on a Thermo Fisher Kα X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (UK)."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Half-cell measurements were conducted in the typical three-electrode configuration using a graphite rod and Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl filled) as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The rotating disk electrode (RDE) was conducted as a working electrode in RRDE-3A (ALS Co.). Each catalyst was prepared to ink solution by dispersing 10 mg of the catalyst in 1 mL solution (ethanol: isopropyl alcohol = 1:1) with 5 mg Nafion (Sigma-Aldrich), volumetric ratio). Then, HER profiles were investigated in N2-saturated 1 M KOH aqueous solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 by drop-coating 5 μL of each catalyst ink onto glassy carbon disk electrode, where the area is 0.13 cm2. A calibration in reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was experimentally determined at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in H2-saturated each solution, where the platinum wire was used as the working and counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. All half-cell profiles were iR compensated by measuring the resistance of the solutions. Accelerated stability measurements were conducted with continuous potential cycling from −0.35 V to 0.15 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. All electrochemical tests were carried out using Biologic VMP3. The underpotential deposition (UPD) of copper on Pt and Ru was conducted to calculate the active sites of each catalyst. The number of active sites (n) was qualified based on the UPD copper stripping charge (Qcu, Cuupd → Cu2+ + 2e−) as follow: n = Qcu/2F where F is the Faraday constant (C mol−1). The turnover frequency (TOF, s−1) was calculated with the following equation: TOF = I/(2Fn) Where I is the current (A) from LSV measurements for HER, F is the Faraday constant (C mol−1), n is the number of active sites (mol) from UPD measurements. The ½ value is attributed to two electrons required to evolve one hydrogen molecule. The water electrolysis tests were proceeded in three-electrode configuration using Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The cathode and anode were prepared by electro-spraying the prepared catalyst ink onto Ni mesh as a current collector with a catalyst loading density of 1 mg cm−2. The measurements were proceeded in deaerated 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The current density was normalized with the geometric area of the catalyst. All electrochemical tests were conducted using Biologic VMP3. The aqueous Zn–CO2 system is fabricated with H-type cell. The electrochemical system is fabricated of Zinc metal/alkaline electrolyte (6 M KOH)/membrane (Nafion)/aqueous electrolyte (CO2 saturated 1 M KOH)/cathode. The cathode was prepared by drop-coating on the carbon paper, TGP-H-090 (Toray carbon paper). The loading density of each electrocatalyst was 2 mg cm−2 using ink solution."
6,Computational details,"2.5 Computational details To investigate the stable configuration of Ru-ENG and its excellent HER performance, we conducted theoretical molecular simulations comprising of simulated annealing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. 2.5.1 Simulated annealing Monte Carlo (MC) In order to observe physical adsorption of Ru-precursor to the ENG, MC simulations with simulated annealing method were carried out using the Adsorption program [19]. We considered ENG with N2-terminated square graphene flake with the size of ~40 × 37 Å2. Due to the large size of the ENG model, the structure of ENG flake model was optimized via. self-consistency-charge density functional based tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) calculation with Slater-Koster library from the parameter set ‘3ob’ [20,21]. Partial atomic charges obtained from DFTB were employed for the coulombic interactions in further MC simulations. Considering the experimental synthesis procedure, precursor of Ru (i.e., RuCl3) was treated as ionic compound, thus we modeled Ru3+ and Cl− ions with 1:3 ratio. Non-bonding potential energy parameters between ENG and precursor ions were described by DREIDING forcefield [22]. In the MC simulation, the simulated annealing algorithm with 5 × 106 MC steps for five consecutive annealing cycles was used for the screening of stable adsorption sites in the ENG model. The number of adsorbing Ru precursor was set to 10, 20, and 30 RuCl3 pairs to observe adsorption process. 2.5.2 Density functional theory (DFT) All DFT calculations were conducted with CASTEP program [23]. In the DFT calculation, ENG was considered as a single layer N2-terminated graphene nanoribbon. Considering that ENG was made by breaking graphite through ball-milling process, ENG was treated to be composed of many boundaries, thus two representative edges (i.e., zigzag and armchair) were adopted in the ENG nanoribbon models. For the adsorbed Ru particle to the ENG nanoribbon, we considered two sizes of Ru nanoclusters (i.e., tetrahedral Ru4 and icosahedral Ru13). We used Perdew-Burke-Ermzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional [24] of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The effect of core electrons was considered with ultrasoft pseudopotential [25]. Semi-empirical dispersion correction method of Tkatchenko-Scheffler [26] was applied for the consideration of van der Waals interactions. The convergence criteria of maximum force and displacement were set to 0.03 eV/Å, and 0.001 Å, respectively, and that of single atom energy was 1.0 × 10−5 eV/atom. The energy cut-off values of all calculations were set to be 340 eV. The Brillouin-zone was sampled by Monkhorst-Pack scheme as 1 × 2 × 1 K-point meshes for the periodicity of ENG nanoribbon."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural characterization,"3.1 Structural characterization As shown in schematic illustration (Fig. 1 ), the physicochemical radicalization process induces a direct nitrogen fixation at the physically broken edges of graphitic frameworks. The cleavage of graphitic C–C bonds by ball-milling method created active radical species to react with nitrogen to form C–N bonds along the edges. Thermodynamically, the preferred edge formation of ENG is to maintain the aromatic configuration from reaction with nitrogen. With an exothermic (spontaneous) reaction from nitrogenation at broken edges, the zigzag-shaped (5-membered pyrazole ring) and armchair-shaped (6-membered pyridazine ring) ENG were produced with calculated binding energies (ΔE) for −2.5 eV/N2 and -1.96 eV/N2, respectively [18]. Importantly, the edge-selective substitution of N2 suggested that the π states on the basal plane of graphitic nanoplatelets are well preserved including the nitrogen pz-orbital in conjugated networks with high nitrogen content at the edge sites. With abundant nitrogen groups, the Ru ions can be easily formed the N–Ru bonds along with the edge sites of zigzag-ENG (ZZ-ENG) and armchair-ENG (AC-ENG). The formation of Ru-ENG was further investigated theoretically using simulated annealing Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Fig. S1 shows the distribution of Ru3+ ions adsorbed to the ENG flake model where the red dots represent favorable adsorption sites for Ru3+ ion. Due to the negatively charged nitrogen atoms, Ru3+ ions were favorably adsorbed near the edge of ENG flake. While the number of attached Ru ions was increased from 10 to 30, the distribution became broader, nonetheless, it still exhibited dominant adsorption of Ru3+ ions at the edge site. Subsequently, the Ru metal nanoparticles were preferred formed at the edge of ENG with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). To investigate the structural stability of the Ru-adsorbed ENG catalyst, the binding energies of the Ru particle on the ENG nanoribbon were compared via DFT calculation (Fig. S2). According to the binding strength, attachment of Ru particle to the edge of ENG formed strong chemical bonds (about 4.9–7.52 eV) regardless of the size of Ru particle in both of Ru-ZZ ENG and Ru-AC ENG. By the formation of a chemical bond, a certain amount of electron was transferred from Ru particle to ENG, resulting in positively charged Ru atoms. Note that the charge transfer was also observed in the system in both of Ru-ZZ ENG and Ru-AC ENG. The obtained product Ru-ENG catalyst was further annealed under an argon atmosphere at different temperatures to enhance the crystallinity of Ru nanoparticles. The annealing temperature was optimized according to the hydrogen evolution performance (Fig. S3) of the catalyst. The electrochemical effective surface area (ECSA) also confirmed the optimized annealing temperature, which was evaluated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl, 34.7 mF cm−2) at an annealing temperature of 700 °C (Fig. S4) [27,28]. The synthetic processes are described in detail in the Experimental Section. The crystal structure of Ru-ENG was identified with X-ray diffraction (XRD). In Fig. 2 a, the indicated peaks at a 38.4°, 42.1°, 44.0°, 58.3°, 69.4°, and 78.4° can be attributed to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103) plane of hexagonal Ru (JCPDS 06–663), while the broadened peak at 25.6° belongs to the (002) plane of the graphitic layer in Ru-ENG catalyst. (Fig. S5). The average particle size of Ru nanoparticles for Ru-ENG was determined to be 1.3 nm by using the Scherrer equation. For an investigation of specific surface area, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was conducted using Ru-ENG and ENG substrate. The specific surface area of Ru-ENG (250.91 m2 g−1) was almost 1.4 times higher than that of ENG substrate (179.04 m2 g−1) (Fig. 2b and Fig. S6). The result suggests that the self-grown of Ru nanoparticles occurs at the edges, which could provide additional physicochemical adsorption sites leading catalytic active sites. The mesoporous pores configuration (pore diameter of 7.29 nm) was also observed from the Ru-ENG catalyst. This mesoporous-pore-sized catalyst with a large surface area possibly leads to the effective mass transfer for the efficient electrochemical process [29,30]. The chemical composition and bonding nature of Ru-ENG were further confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2c, the noticeable peak around 284.6 eV belongs to the C–C bond in ENG substrate, while the peak around at 280.4 eV is associated with the zero valence state of the Ru species in Ru-ENG. Moreover, survey spectra show four dominant peaks corresponding to the C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Ru 3p component, respectively (Fig. S7). The high-resolution XPS spectra (indicated that the aromatic C–N in 5-membered pyrazole (pyrrolic-N) and 6-membered pyridazine (pyridinic-N) rings are the dominant N components in ENG, while the oxygen is mostly attributable to the present amount of physically absorbed oxygen from the air at the non-nitrogenated residual activated carbon sites [18,31]. The Ru0 was further confirmed by the peaks at about 462.2 and 484.6 eV, corresponding to Ru 3p3/2 and Ru 3p1/2 of Ru0, respectively. The Ru content in the Ru-ENG catalyst is determined to be about 4.21 wt% by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement (Fig. S8) in air condition, which is a relatively low amount of Ru compared to previous researches [7,8]. The morphology structure of the Ru-ENG was studied with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Fig. S9) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In Fig. 2d, the Ru nanoflakes (average diameter 1.1 ± 0.5 nm) are uniformly distributed which well matches the average particle size (~1.1 nm) calculated from the XRD profiles. The Ru nanoparticles anchored onto the ENG substrate without any noticeable aggregation can also contribute to the increase of the overall surface area of the Ru-ENG structure. The high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 2e) and corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) patterns (Fig. 2f) of Ru nanoparticle (~2 nm) were presented. The corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern of individual Ru particle viewed along the <100> zone axis is which clearly reveals the crystal structure. The d-spacing of the crystal lattices is 0.230 and 0.211 nm can be assigned to the (010) and (002) planes of the hexagonal Ru viewed along the <100> zone axis. Fig. 2g showed a scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) element mapping images, demonstrating the presence of the associated elements (C, N, and Ru) in Ru-ENG. The distribution ruthenium throughout the nitrogen doping can attribute to efficient catalytic activity and improved electrochemical performances."
9,Half-cell configured electrochemical analysis,"3.2 Half-cell configured electrochemical analysis HER catalytic activities of ENG, Ru-ENG, and benchmark Pt/C catalyst were sensitively evaluated using a three-electrode configuration in various pH conditions. For detailed electrochemical analysis, the reference electrode (KCl saturated Ag/AgCl) was calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in high purity hydrogen saturated electrolyte with a Pt wire as the working electrode (Fig. S10). Fig. 3 a shows representative polarization curves of each electrocatalyst in N2-saturated 1 M KOH. The Ru-ENG catalyst delivers remarkable HER activity with almost the same onset potential in comparison with commercial Pt/C, and a sharp increase in current density as increasing overpotential. Notably, the overpotential of Ru-ENG catalyst at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 47 mV which is an even lower value than that of benchmarked Pt/C (57 mV) and ENG substrate (719 mV). The HER performance of the Ru-ENG catalyst is also confirmed with a relatively small Tafel slope of 32 mV dec.−1 comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (40 mV dec.−1) in Fig. 3b. Such an exhibited Tafel value of commercial Pt/C suggested that the HER on Pt surface in Pt/C process through the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism and the electrochemical desorption process could be the rate-determining step (RDS) at low overpotential region [3,32,33]. In the case of Ru-ENG, the Tafel slope of the catalyst decreased to 32 mV dec.−1 in the alkaline media, proving Ru-ENG had a faster reaction pathway than commercial Pt/C. Charge-transfer resistance (Rct) values of Ru-ENG, and commercial Pt/C catalyst were also conducted at various potential range (−0.05 V, −0.1 V, and −0.15 V vs. RHE; Fig. S11). The Ru-ENG catalyst showed the smaller value of Rct than that of commercial Pt/C and ENG substrate in various overpotential range. The Rct values are related to the electrocatalytic kinetics at the electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface, and a smaller value indicates a faster electron transfer capacity [34]. The lower value of Rct of Ru-ENG catalyst than that of Pt/C indicated that the faster HER reaction kinetics occurred on the surface of Ru particles on Ru-ENG, which is corresponding with Tafel analysis. To further assess the information about the intrinsic HER kinetics, we have calculated the turnover frequency (TOF) as a function of overpotentials (Fig. 3c). TOF value refers to the rate of the H2 molecules evolved per electrochemically active surface site. The TOF values for each active site of Ru-ENG and Pt/C were calculated based on the estimated numbers of active sites results from the copper underpotential UPD measurements (Figs. S12–13). From the results of Cu-UPD measurements, the number of active sites of Ru-ENG and commercial Pt/C is determined to be 0.578 × 10−3 g−1 and 0.475 × 10−3 g−1, respectively. With the above the intrinsic electrochemical properties of each catalyst, the Ru-ENG catalyst exhibited a relatively higher TOF value (0.84, 3.65H2 s−1 at overpotential of 20 mV and 45 mV, respectively) than commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution, indicating the intrinsic activity of Ru-ENG was superior to the Pt activity towards HER. This notable capacity of Ru-ENG was again elucidated with other recently reported HER electrocatalyst (including such as Ru/NC, Mo2C, Ru/C3N4/C, CoMoS4, Au/C, Ru/C, Co-NG, NiPX, and NiMo) [5,35–39]. Particularly, the Ru-ENG electrocatalyst delivers high TOF value of the whole range of overpotential, which is evidently larger than that of some well-known HER catalysts (Table S1). HER electrocatalysts working in neutral and acidic media are also investigated to a versatile hydrogen economy. The Ru-ENG catalyst was further explored in neutral (1 M KHCO3) and acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) electrolytes and the polarization curves of the Ru-ENG catalyst still followed the same activity trends with alkaline media even though different HER pathways are adopted in different pH-condition. In 1 M KHCO3 solution (Fig. 3d–f), the Ru-ENG catalyst achieves the small overpotential with ŋ overpotential of 221 and 264 mV at a current density of both 10 mA and 20 mA cm−2, respectively, which is even lower than that of commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the Ru-ENG catalyst also exhibited a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec.−1 and comparable TOF values (4.88H2 s−1 at 0.25 V; 8.15H2 s−1 at 0.3 V) with commercial Pt/C, suggesting a superior activity over the commercial Pt/C (Tafel slope: 45 mV dec.−1). In acidic conditions (Fig. 3g–i), it can be found that the almost same onset potential for HER of Ru-ENG catalyst compared to Pt/C, and the Tafel slope of Ru-ENG (28.9 mV dec.−1 is slightly lower than that of Pt/C (30.8 mV dec.−1). The results of the Tafel slope suggested that the corresponding HER abides by a Volmer-Tafel mechanism and the recombination step is the rate-determining step of both of Ru-ENG and Pt/C in acidic media. Compared to the Pt/C (0.61H2 s−1) in Fig. 3i, the TOF value of the Ru-ENG at 20 mV was 0.75H2 s−1 suggesting the superior activity of the Ru-ENG for HER even in acidic condition. It is well known that the overall catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst is generally related by the number of active sites. To assess the intrinsic activity of Ru-ENG catalyst, it is necessary to eliminate the contribution of surface areas such as real catalyst surface area or ECSA. As shown in Figs. S14 and S15, the specific activity (SA) of Ru-ENG is comparable or even higher than that of Pt/C and ENG in universal pH conditions, indicating the excellent intrinsic activities of Ru-ENG for HER. Electrochemical durability is also a vital criterion to asses the property of an electrocatalyst for the practical application. To evaluate the stability of the Ru-ENG catalyst, accelerated degradation studies were performed in all pH conditions. The electrocatalytic stability of Ru-ENG and Pt/C was evaluated using 10,000 continuous cyclic voltammograms under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. S16, after 10,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, the polarization curves of Pt/C catalyst were negatively shifted by 14, 65, and 21 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KHCO3, 1 M KOH solution, respectively. However, the Ru-ENG catalyst showed much higher electrochemical stability through the movement of 9, 43, and 7.6 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KHCO3, 1 M KOH solution in the same conditions. Therefore, it is worthwhile to note that the Ru-ENG catalyst showed much better electrochemical performance and stability compared to commercial Pt/C in universal pH conditions. Additionally, the price based activity (PA) of Ru-ENG catalyst and commercial Pt/C is conducted considering the difference in their price (Fig. S17 and Table S2). In various pH conditions, the price activity of the Ru-ENG catalyst showed also much better than that of Pt/C catalyst at the same current density, indicating its advantageous for practical application even with high-current density."
10,HER enhancement mechanism,"3.3 HER enhancement mechanism X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was conducted to validate the local atomic and electronic structures of Ru-ENG catalyst. The Ru K-edge XANES was investigated with RuO2/C, Ru foil, and RuO2 as the references (Fig. 4 a). The positioning of the adsorption edge reflects the valence state of Ru. The position and the line shapes of the main peak in the Ru K-edge XANES spectra of Ru-ENG were analogous to that of Ru foil (Ru0), whereas RuO2 and RuO2 loaded on the carbon substrate (RuO2/C) indicate the reference of Ru4+ valence state. Interestingly, the Ru in Ru-ENG catalyst exhibited metallic electron configuration but was slightly shifted to higher energy than that of the Ru foil reference. The slightly reduced electron density of Ru in Ru-ENG might be attributed to the strong interaction between Ru metal and ENG substrate. The Fourier-transformed (FT) k3-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum was also presented in Fig. 4b. In EXAFS analysis, Ru–C(O) scattering peak located at around 1.4 Å, and Ru–Ru scattering peak located at around 2.3 Å. The intensity of the scattering peak is related to the coordination number. Therefore, the lower intensity of Ru–Ru in Ru-ENG catalyst than that of Ru foil indicated that unsaturated coordination of Ru–Ru in Ru-ENG in comparison with Ru foil. The reduced coordination number of Ru–Ru in Ru-ENG is attributed from the interaction between Ru metal and nitrogenated edge sites (Ru–N), suggesting that the Ru metal in Ru-ENG is strongly bonded with the nitrogen on the selectively edge-exposed substrate. To identify the electron contribution of Ru and ENG substrate, high-resolution XPS spectra of the N 1s in ENG, and Ru-ENG was further investigated (Fig. 4c). In comparison with N 1s in ENG substrate, both pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N peaks in Ru-ENG were slightly shifted to a lower binding energy region after metal adsorption. The lower binding energy is expected to electron transfer from Ru metal to ENG substrate, which is also well corresponding with XAFS measurements and chemical bonding simulations (Fig. S2). These results reveal that nitrogenated edge sites lead specific interaction with the surface of the Ru nanoparticles with inducing the Ru–N bonding, which enhances the catalytic activities and structural stability of Ru-ENG. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were simulated to theoretically investigate the high HER activity of Ru in nitrogen-doped graphite carbon (Fig. S18). As shown in Fig. S2, the electronic configuration of Ru-ENG was demonstrated that high charge transfer was observed from Ru nanoparticles to the edge of the ENG substrate. DFT calculations were further employed for the investigation of superior HER performance of the Ru-ENG under the alkaline condition. One of the most important factors in HER is the formation of bonds between catalyst (i.e., Ru surface in this study) and hydrogen. In order to facilitate the formation of metal-hydrogen bonds under alkaline conditions, adsorption of water molecules and its dissociation reaction should favorably occur as the Volmer reaction step. In Fig. 4d, the whole chemical- and electrochemical-processes were presented from the synthesis to the hydrogen production of Ru-ENG catalyst (e.g., Ru13-AC ENG) in alkaline media. Firstly, for the investigation of HER activities, we have compared the binding of water and decomposition energy of the adsorbed water on the particle surface (Fig. 4e, Figs. S19–S20). As for water (H2O) adsorption, while Pt cluster exhibited a slightly better adsorption activity of water than that of Ru cluster, the presence of ENG significantly contributed to the improved water binding energy on Ru cluster surface. Besides, decomposition of water (H2O → H+ + OH−) on Ru was significantly preferred compared to the Pt cluster, and Ru-ENG also had better reactivity over the Pt cluster. It was worth to note that in the icosahedron cluster (i.e., Ru13), water decomposition performance of Ru-ENG became better than pure Ru cluster, in contrast to the previously reported similar work that Ru on nitrogen-doped graphene basal plane system (Ru@C2N) performed slightly worse compared to pure Ru cluster [40]. Additionally, in acidic conditions, HER process is favorable only if the strength of metal-hydrogen bonds should be neither too strong nor too weak. The binding energies (-ΔEbind, H2) of H2 to the Ru-ENG with the pure metal clusters of Ru and Pt were also investigated in Fig. 4e. The binding energy of H+ atoms showed that binding interaction to the Ru metal cluster was comparable with the Pt cluster, regardless of the size of the metal cluster (Fig. S21). The introduction of ENG to the Ru metal cluster allowed for favorable hydrogen of Ru metal cluster comparable with Pt metal cluster. Thus, we theoretically anticipated that Ru metal particles on the edge of nitrogen-doped graphene could be more effective for HER performance in both acidic and alkaline conditions."
11,Evaluation of electrochemical activities in practical applications,"3.4 Evaluation of electrochemical activities in practical applications For practical application, the water-splitting system was conducted to evaluate the electrochemical performances and stability of the developed Ru-ENG catalyst. The water-splitting system was conducted with a three-electrode configuration (vs. Ag/AgCl) adopting Iridium oxide (IrO2) for an anode, which is commonly used as a referencing OER electrode. At the photograph of water-splitting in Fig. 5 a, the hydrogen (H2) gas and oxygen (O2) gas was actively generated at the cathode and anode side, respectively. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots in Fig. 5b showed the water-splitting electrochemical performance at various current densities from 0 to 300 mA cm−2. To distinguish the detailed electrochemical analysis in water-splitting measurement, the polarization curves were separated to the obtained cell potentials (Ecell = Eanode - Ecathode), Eanode (OER), and Ecathode (HER). Noticeably, to achieve a current density of 300 mA cm−2, the Ru-ENG electrode needs low overpotential as −1.39 V vs. Ag/AgCl in Ecathode, which is significantly lower overpotential than that of state-of-the-art catalyst, Pt/C electrode (−1.46 V). As shown in Fig. 5c, the LSV measurement of each catalyst was presented after the chrono-potentiometric test at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. The benchmark Pt/C electrode showed the dramatic degradation of hydrogen evolution properties after a consecutive operation for 350 h at 100 mA cm−2. The Ru-ENG electrode, however, presented the highly active electrochemical properties for HER even after a consecutive operation for 1,500 h at the same condition with Pt/C electrode. These results indicate the structural and electrochemical stability of Ru-ENG, which is well-matched with the half-cell measurements. Fig. 5d presented consecutive chronopotentiometry profiles at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 of each catalyst. The Pt/C electrode showed continuous degradation over 370 h leading the cell failure. In contrast, the Ru-ENG electrode exhibited a remarkably stable operating condition over 1,500 h without an observable change in electrochemical performance, demonstrating its exceptional durability in HER, even at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2. Fig. S22 showed SEM images of the Ru-ENG electrode after 1,500 h of the water splitting test, clogging or electro-chemical/physical damage was not observed on the catalyst after the test. After the long-term stability test, the morphology of the Ru-ENG catalyst showed well-dispersed Ru nanoparticles on the ENG substrate without any significant aggregation of Ru particles (Figs. S23 and S24). Furthermore, in Fig. S25, we have investigated the electric configuration of Ru-ENG catalyst before and after stability test. Both pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N peak in Ru-ENG were maintained after long-term stability test, indicating the Ru metal in Ru-ENG is strongly bonded with the nitrogen on the ENG substrate after the electrochemical reaction. Meanwhile, an U-tube type cell was utilized to avoid gas mixing to determine the amount of H2/O2, which indicates the faraday efficiency (FE) of over 98% and a molar artio being close to 2:1 between H2 and O2 gas (Fig. S26). The electrochemical performance and stability of Ru-ENG catalyst were summarized in Fig. 5e, which is compared with the representative water-splitting catalysts reported to date. Impressively, when Ru-ENG electrode was applied to the water-splitting system, the initiation potential was observed at 1.42 V, and the proposed electrode exhibited excellent water electrolysis stability over 1,500 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2, which is far superior and stable performance compared to the benchmark Pt/C and other reported electrodes. Additionally, the electrochemical performance of Ru-ENG and commercial Pt/C catalyst was evaluated using aqueous Zn–CO2 system (Fig. 5f), which can indirectly utilize CO2 gas from HER process [41–43] (Illustrated in Fig. S27). For efficient utilization of CO2, the fast and efficient hydrogen evolution reaction should be obtained in neutral condition. During the operating process, the low-overpotential HER occurs on the cathode driven by anodic Zn oxidation as shown in Fig. 5g. The Ru-ENG electrode exhibited a higher maximum current density as 50.7 mA cm−2 than that of commercial Pt/C (42.3 mA cm−2). The larger maximum current density of Ru-ENG is caused by the better performance of the cathodic HER profile than that of commercial Pt/C (bottom part in Fig. 5g). In Fig. 5h, to further investigate the electrochemical stability of each sample the chrono-potentiometric profiles on aqueous Zn–CO2 system were conducted at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. The commercial Pt/C catalyst showed continuous degradation over 500 m whereas the Ru-ENG exhibited in plateau without significant degradation, indicating similar trends with the water-splitting system. Consequently, these electrochemical results implied that the rationally engineered Ru-ENG catalyst has great potential to be utilized for scale-up industrial implementation of hydrogen production as a pH-independent electrocatalyst for HER with high efficiency and low cost."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we have reported rationally anchored Ru nanoparticles at edge-selectively nitrogenated graphitic nanoplatelets (Ru-ENG) via physicochemical ball-milling method. The edge-selectively nitrogenated graphitic nanoplatelets (ENG) exposed to an abundant anchoring edge-sites for Ru metal without severe damages on the carbon basal plane, which leads to superior conductivities and electrochemical activities for HER. The specific interaction of Ru–N bonds in both of armchair-ENG and zigzag-ENG substrate leads to favorable hydrogen evolution activities of icosahedron cluster Ru in Ru-ENG with lower Tafel slopes and higher turnover frequencies (TOF) than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in universal pH conditions. In practical applications with a water-splitting and aqueous Zn–CO2 system, the Ru-ENG electrocatalyst exhibited superior long-term consecutive stability and remarkable hydrogen evolution activities. This work provides a potentially powerful approach for the design of rationally selective heteroatom substitution with other active metals as a promising HER candidate regardless of pH condition."
