0,Introduction,"The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major contributor to rising global surface temperature and climate change [1,2]. The transport sector is responsible for around a quarter of the total global GHG emissions [3], and for more than 25% in the EU in 2015 [4]. As the world’s governments strive to meet the ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement, decarbonization of the transport sector will present particular challenges [5]. Decarbonization of the transport sector can be achieved by reducing energy consumption, or by decarbonizing supply, or both. A promising decarbonization alternative is electrification with low-carbon electricity. However, the aviation-, maritime-, and heavy transport segments will remain expensive to electrify, and will thus rely on hydrocarbon fuels also in the foreseeable future. For the transport sector, mainly liquid hydrocarbon fuels are of interest, primarily because liquid biofuels can be co-processed and distributed in the existing fuel distribution infrastructure. Current biofuel production is dominated by first generation ethanol with a global capacity of 120 Mt/a. This represents about 4% of the world’s road transport fuel demand [6]. In Europe, attention has shifted towards more advanced biofuels derived from non-edible lignocellulosic residues and wastes, as these fuels can potentially provide significant fuel volumes low in greenhouse gas emissions while avoiding many concerns associated with first-generation biofuels [7]. The commercialisation of advanced biofuels has been slow, however, and a twenty-five-fold scale-up in production would be necessary between 2020 and 2025 in order to achieve the 1.6 EJ biofuel contribution required in the IEA 2°C scenario in 2025 [8]. Large-scale deployment of advanced biofuel technologies leads to large-scale demand for biomass, and this could raise concerns about resource availability and sustainability. To minimise such concerns, the use of biomass resources and the land used for bioenergy purposes should be as efficient as possible. The use of biomass resources can be measured in terms of energy efficiency of biomass conversion, while the land use aspect can be measured in terms of carbon efficiency. Bio-oil consists of large molecules and is rich in water and oxygenated compounds [9–11]. As a result, raw bio-oil is not suitable for direct replacement of or blending with mineral gasoline or diesel fractions. Instead, using bio-oil for transport fuel purposes requires subsequent processing. Direct biomass liquefaction via pyrolysis with subsequent upgrading of bio-oil to hydrocarbon fuels for transport has been assessed by Jones et al. [11–13], Elliott [14,15], Elliott et al. [16]; Wright et al. [17]; Dutta et al. [18]; and Tews et al. [19]. Fast pyrolysis bio-oil production has been demonstrated at commercial scale [20], while upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oil into transport fuel has so far been demonstrated at laboratory scale [21]. In fast pyrolysis, a high feedstock to product mass yield can be achieved. However, the amount of feedstock carbon that ends up in the bio-oil product is low (±50 wt-%), and the rest is vented from the process as CO2. Tews et al. [19] reported an overall efficiency of gasoline and diesel production though thermal fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading based on hydrodeoxygenation (also called hydrotreating) of 54.4%. In an attempt to improve the bio-oil quality and stability, catalytic pyrolysis has gained increased interest [18,22–27]. Catalytic fast pyrolysis produces a bio-oil lower in oxygenated compounds, which increases fuel quality and bio-oil stability. However, catalytic pyrolysis generates a lower bio-oil yield compared to thermal fast pyrolysis (∼26–27 wt-%) [22,25,28–32]. Catalytic pyrolysis can be either done in-situ (inside the pyrolysis reactor bed) or ex-situ (catalytic reforming of the pyrolysis vapours immediately after the reactor) [18,32]. In this study, we carry out a technical investigation based on mass and energy balances of forest residue-based thermal fast pyrolysis (TFP) and catalytic pyrolysis (CAT) for liquid biofuel production. Co-production of biofuels and heat is assumed to maximise overall energy efficiency. We also examine two additional pyrolysis concepts where the carbon conversion is maximised by producing synthetic natural gas (SNG, biomethane) from the bio-oil production process off-gases and electrolytic hydrogen. A recent study by Hannula [33] showed that the carbon efficiency of biofuel production from biomass gasification can be significantly improved by adding external hydrogen to the gasification plant to produce SNG from process gases. In this paper, we carry out a similar, technical investigation for fast pyrolysis technologies. In this context, the additional boost to the carbon efficiency is achieved through catalytic methanation of process off-gases using additional hydrogen from water electrolysis based on low-carbon electricity. To our best knowledge, this work is the first detailed investigation on this topic."
1,Methods and concepts,"We evaluate the performance of four different biorefinery configurations that convert wood into bio-oil, non-condensable gas (NCG), char and water through pyrolysis, followed by upgrading of bio-oil into gasoline and diesel fractions. Two thermal fast pyrolysis (TFP) concepts (also known as conventional fast pyrolysis) and two catalytic fast pyrolysis (CAT) concepts are evaluated: • TFP: Thermal fast pyrolysis with bio-oil upgrading to gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbons (base case) • TFP+: Thermal fast pyrolysis with bio-oil upgrading to gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbons, and production of SNG from process gases (hydrogen enhanced case) • CAT: Catalytic pyrolysis with bio-oil upgrading to gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbons (base case) • CAT+: Catalytic fast pyrolysis with bio-oil upgrading to gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbons, and production of SNG from process gases (hydrogen enhanced case) The base case includes only pyrolysis, bio-oil upgrading, a hydrogen plant, and a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. In the enhanced hydrogen cases, non-condensable (NC) off-gases from the pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading (hydrotreatment) processes are reformed and catalytically converted to SNG. All examined biorefinery configurations are modelled with the Aspen Plus® process simulation software to obtain mass, energy and carbon balances. A brief process description is presented in Section 2.1 and the examined case configurations are described in Section 2.2. The battery limit for the studied configurations is at the biorefinery gate as illustrated in Figs. 1–2 ."
2,Process modelling,"2.1 Process modelling The following sections give a brief description of the process modelling in Aspen Plus, including feedstock specification, component selection, and physical property methods selection. For further reading on technical process modelling aspects, feedstock specification, component selection and physical property method selection, please refer to Ref. [34]; where the process modelling of a wood-based fast pyrolysis process in Aspen Plus has been described in detail. Ref. [34] comprises the basis for the summary given in this section. 2.1.1 Feedstock specification All examined plants are dimensioned to convert 2000 dry metric tonnes of forest residues per day (tpd) to biofuel. This corresponds to a fast pyrolysis bio-oil production of around 1400 tpd. The operational time for the biorefineries is 8000 h/a. The feedstock is defined as a non-conventional solid component in Aspen Plus, and the ultimate and proximate analyses for property specifications are given in Table 1 . The ultimate and proximate analyses are based on in-house analyses from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. 2.1.2 Component selection There is no component in the Aspen Plus databases for fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO). Furthermore, FPBO consists of hundreds of different components, with varying chemical and thermodynamic properties. Up to 40 wt-% of the components in FPBO can be identified by standard analyses. The remaining share is analysed as compound groups by solvent fractionation. The pyrolysis reactor was modelled as a yield reactor, where the user specifies the reactor yield. To represent the bio-oil (organic fraction of pyrolysis reaction products) in the Aspen Plus model, model components were used. Model components are conventional components identified by chemical analyses of FPBO. FPBO comprises of some major component groups, or chemical groups, including organic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, phenolic components, sugar derivatives, furans, extractives, and lignin components, in addition to some trace elements like sulfur and nitrogen. One to two model components were defined for each of the above-mentioned chemical component groups, together comprising the forest residue-based FPBO. The identification and selection of components for non-condensable gases are based on in-house analyses from a fast pyrolysis Process Development Unit at the VTT Technical Research Centre. The composition of the non-condensable gases is given in Appendix B, Table B4. 2.1.3 Physical property method The wide range of components involved in a biomass-based fast pyrolysis process makes it challenging to define one Aspen Plus property method that is able to correctly represent each single component in terms of thermodynamic and transport properties. Aspen Plus offers two main physical property methods; the activity coefficient method or the equation of state. The FPBO is a highly non-ideal mixture of organic components, and the mixture is prone to secondary reactions and polymerization within the reactor and condensation system. Consequently, the activity coefficient method was chosen, as this method favours non-ideal mixtures. Non-condensable gases were defined as super-critical components, and the activity coefficient method is also applicable for processes based on Henry’s Law. The physical property method selected was UNIQUAC."
3,Case configurations,"2.2 Case configurations 2.2.1 Base cases TFP and CAT Forest residue feedstock is pyrolysed into thermal or catalytic bio-oil, followed by upgrading to gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbon fractions by hydro-deoxygenation (HDO), also called hydrotreatment. Hydrogen for the HDO is produced from non-condensable process gases from pyrolysis and HDO via reforming in a hydrogen plant. Excess non-condensable gases not needed for hydrogen production are combusted in the combined heat and power (CHP) plant. Also pyrolysis by-products char (TFP and CAT) and aqueous phase (CAT) are combusted in the CHP. The CHP provides the biofuel production process with the heat and electricity required by the biorefinery processes. In the TFP case, the char and excess non-condensable off-gases are not sufficient to produce the required heat for the biorefinery processes, and additional fuel (forest residue) to the CHP boiler is needed. Electricity that is not utilized onsite is exported to the grid, while excess heat is exported to the district heating network. A simplified process block flow diagram, including the battery limit of the assessments is illustrated in Fig. 1. 2.2.2 Enhanced hydrogen cases TFP+ and CAT+ The pre-treatment, thermal/catalytic pyrolysis, CHP, and HDO steps as described in section 2.2.1 are unaltered in the enhanced hydrogen cases TFP+ and CAT+. However, in the enhanced hydrogen cases, non-condensable gases from pyrolysis and HDO are reformed to synthesis gas (syngas) instead. The resulting syngas is cooled down, dried and converted to synthetic natural gas via catalytic methanation. The hydrogen required for the methanation process is produced by low-carbon water electrolysis. The electrolyser also produces hydrogen for the bio-oil HDO unit, and consequently there is no need for the hydrogen plant featured in the base cases. By-product oxygen from the electrolysis is used for partial oxidation in the reformer, and surplus oxygen can be sold as a co-product along with biofuel, electricity and heat. Heat from the methanation process is used to generate steam from CHP condensate, which is fed back to the CHP steam turbine. Co-product hot water from methanation and electrolysis is exported to regional district heating systems. A simplified process block flow diagram is illustrated in Fig. 2."
4,Process description,"2.3 Process description Unit processes featured in the biorefinery concepts are described in the subsequent sections. Simplified flow diagrams for individual process sections are illustrated in Figures A1 to A5 in Appendix A. The main process parameter assumptions, used in Aspen models, are listed in Table A1 in Appendix A. 2.3.1 Thermal fast pyrolysis (TFP) Forest residue is delivered to the biorefinery gate as wood chips at 50 wt-% moisture (as received). To minimise bio-oil water content, and thus the risk of phase separation of the product, the wood chips are dried to 8 wt-% in a conventional belt dryer. The heat demand for the dryer is supplied by a mixture of steam and hot water from the CHP plant. Additionally, heat from bio-oil condensation is also used in the feedstock dryer. Dried chips are ground to a particle size of <5 mm. The dry and ground feedstock is then fed to an atmospheric circulating fluidized bed (CFB) pyrolysis reactor where it is rapidly heated to 520 °C in the absence of oxygen. Heat to the pyrolysis reactor is provided by the CHP plant. Hot sand operates as a heat transfer medium between the CHP and the pyrolysis reactor. The decomposition products from the pyrolysis reaction include organic vapours, non-condensable gases, pyrolytic water and char. Organic vapours exiting the pyrolysis reactor are quickly condensed to 35 °C in a counter-current quenching tower to avoid secondary reactions and polymerization of the bio-oil. Condensed bio-oil is used as quenching medium in the condensation unit. The organic yield is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the pyrolysis feedstock, and in particular on its ash content. This is because ash acts as a catalyst during the fast pyrolysis reaction, having an inverse correlation with the organic bio-oil yield [35,36]. Char and sand from the pyrolysis reactor are separated by cyclones and fed to the CHP boiler where char is combusted and sand reheated. Non-condensable gases are partly recirculated to the pyrolysis reactor as fluidizing medium. The remaining non-condensable gases can either be combusted in the CHP to produce more steam and heat, or used as feedstock for hydrogen production (base cases), or as feedstock for SNG (enhanced hydrogen cases). A detailed description of the fast pyrolysis process and modelling of wood pyrolysis in Aspen is available from Onarheim et al. [34]. 2.3.2 Catalytic pyrolysis (CAT) The catalytic pyrolysis process is similar to the thermal fast pyrolysis as described in section 2.2.1, with the exception that the sand bed in the fluidized reactor is replaced with a catalyst. Consequently, the bed material has a dual function in the catalytic concepts, operating both as a heat carrier and as a catalyst at the same time. Upon contact with the biomass particles, the catalyst will form coke that adheres to the catalyst surface and eventually deactivates its catalytic properties. In a CFB pyrolysis reactor, the catalyst is continuously regenerated in the CHP boiler where the coke deposits are oxidized and the catalyst reheated by heat from the combustion reactions of coke, char and non-condensable gas [22]. The catalyst is sensitive to high temperatures, however, and part of the cooled CHP flue gases are recirculated to the boiler to control the boiler temperature to a window between 600 and 650 °C. Catalytic organic vapours undergo phase separation into an oil fraction and an aqueous fraction. The water content of the oil phase and the aqueous phase is around 9–11 wt-% and 60–70 wt-%, respectively, while the oxygen content of the oil fraction is around 22–24 wt-% compared to 40 wt-% for thermal fast pyrolysis bio-oil [22]. The aqueous phase, containing more than 30 wt-% organic compounds, is combusted in the CHP boiler. As a result, the catalytic fast pyrolysis-based biorefinery is self-sufficient in terms of heat and electricity and no additional boiler fuel (like in the TFP case) is required. Although catalytic fast pyrolysis produces a higher quality bio-oil, and has a higher carbon yield in the oil phase, the overall organic yield in the oil phase is lower (∼49 wt-%) than for thermal fast pyrolysis (75 wt-%, wet basis). On the other hand, the energy content of catalytic bio-oil (30.4 MJ/kg) is higher compared to thermal fast pyrolysis bio-oil (22.2 MJ/kg) [22]. In this work, in-situ catalytic pyrolysis based on a spray-dried HZSM-5 catalyst is assessed. We use pyrolysis yields for thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of forest residue as analysed based on pilot test runs in a 0.5 t/h process development unit at VTT Technical research Centre of Finland. The yields are listed in Table 2 . 2.3.3 Bio-oil hydro-deoxygenation Catalytic hydrotreatment, or hydro-deoxygenation (HDO), of bio-oil minimizes the presence of oxygenated compounds through hydrodeoxygenation and decarboxylation. The molecular weight of the hydrocarbon components is also reduced to a range more suitable for liquid fuels. The final quality of the bio-oil depends strongly on type of catalyst used, reactor configuration and hydrotreatment conditions [11,13,14,19]. Cooled bio-oil is first pressurized to 140 bar and mixed with high-pressure excess hydrogen recirculated from the hydrotreatment reactor. The high-pressure bio-oil/hydrogen mixture is preheated to 165°C by heat recovered from the hydrotreatment product. The hydrotreatment system is a continuous-flow, fixed bed reactor packed with catalysts. Due to the reactive nature and thermal instability of pyrolysis bio-oil, single-stage hydrotreatment has proved challenging, producing a heavy-molecule, tar-like product as reported in Jones et al. [11]. As a consequence, the hydrotreatment should be performed in several subsequent stages, allowing for an increase in process severity that results less destructive [11,13,14,19]. Jones et al. [11] reported modelling results based on laboratory hydrotreatment tests performed in three individual, subsequent stages; stabilization, hydrotreatment stage 1 and hydrotreatment stage 2. Through the hydrotreatment reactions in Equations (1) and (2), the oxygen level in the unstable oxygenated bio-oil is reduced to below 1–2 wt-%. (1) C n C O O H → C a t a l y s t / 3 H 2 C n + 1 + 2 H 2 O Hydrodeoxygenation (2) C n C O O H → C a t a l y s t / H 2 C n + C O 2 Decarboxylation For modelling purposes, the stabilizing stage and the dual-stage hydrotreatment was modelled as one individual stage using a yield reactor allowing to specify the reactor output based on results reported by Jones et al. [12,13], Zhu et al. [37], and Tews et al. [19]. Catalysts used in the hydrotreatment process are Ru/C during the stabilization stage, sulphide Ru/C for hydrotreatment stage 1, and sulphide NiMo for hydrotreatment stage 2 [19]. The hydrotreatment products include a liquid upgraded bio-oil fraction (stable hydrocarbon (HC) oil phase), water and non-condensable gases such as methane, ethane, propane and butane in addition to carbon dioxide and excess hydrogen. Water is separated, and surplus hydrogen is separated and recycled back to the reactor. Make-up hydrogen is sourced from a hydrogen plant (base cases), or from an electrolyser (enhanced hydrogen cases). The stabilized hydrocarbon oil is distilled into gasoline fractions, diesel fractions and a heavy hydrocarbon fraction. The gasoline and diesel fractions can be blended with mineral oil products. The heavy hydrocarbons can be cracked further in a hydrocracker. Waste water from the hydrotreatment unit typically contains less than 2 wt-% organic compounds, and can be treated by anaerobic digestion [11,13,19]. A potential waste water treatment plant was assumed for the evaluated concepts, but not modelled. Therefore, no organics were assumed in the waste water for this work. Purified waste water is used as feedwater make-up for the CHP boiler and for steam production in the hydrogen plant. 2.3.4 Hydrogen plant For the base cases, hydrogen for the hydrotreatment unit is produced in an integrated hydrogen plant based on direct steam reforming (no external burner). Non-condensable gases from the pyrolysis and hydrotreatment units are used as reformer feedstock. Excess non-condensable off-gas (not used in the hydrogen plant either as feedstock or fuel for the reformer) is sent to the CHP plant for combustion. The reformer feed gas is pre-heated to 320°C and mixed with steam at 320°C. The mixture is further heated to 850°C using heat recovered from cooling the produced syngas. From the reformer, the syngas is sent to a shift reactor where it is converted mainly to a mixture of hydrogen and CO2. Water is condensed from the syngas, and the syngas is compressed to 20 bar prior to extracting the hydrogen using a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit. The separation efficiency of the PSA is 80%. PSA off-gases are used as fuel for the steam reformer. 2.3.5 Combined heat and power (CHP) plant The co-generation (CHP) plant provides both electricity and heat for the pyrolysis plant. The CHP consists of a boiler, a steam cycle and a generator. The boiler is a fluidized-bed reactor using sand or catalyst (depending on TFP or CAT configuration, respectively) as bed material. The bed material is fluidized with pre-heated combustion air. The boiler is fuelled with char and potentially also with non-condensable gases from the biorefinery processes, depending on the concept configuration. In the case of catalytic pyrolysis, the aqueous phase generated during pyrolysis is also combusted in the boiler. In the TFP design, char and excess non-condensable off-gases are not sufficient to produce all the required heat and electricity for the overall biorefinery. The reason is that the non-condensable gases are mostly used as feedstock in the hydrogen plant. Additional boiler fuel is therefore needed. The boiler operates with the same forest residue feedstock as the pyrolysis processes, but without the need for grinding and drying as described in section 2.3.1 The CHP boilers are sized according to by-product combustion rates, except for the TFP case where the boiler is sized according to the heat requirement of the overall biorefinery. Thus, in the TFP case, excess heat from the CHP is kept at an operational minimum. In the CAT design, additional boiler fuel is not needed, because the aqueous phase has, together with the char, sufficient capacity to provide the overall heat and electricity requirements. Hot flue gas from the boiler is used to vaporize water and superheat steam. The steam cycle has been modelled as a three-stage turbine island, consisting of high pressure (HP), intermediate pressure (IP) and low pressure (LP) turbine sections. The isentropic efficiencies of the turbine stages were calculated based on volumetric flow through each stage at a given time and taking into account condensation at the turbine surface according to Eq. (3) [38]: (3) η s = 0.024 l n ( q 1 + q 2 2 ) + 0.75 − ( 2 − x 1 − x 2 ) 2 where q 1 and q 2 represent the actual volumetric flow of steam at turbine inlet and outlet, respectively, and x1 and x2 represent the mass fractions of steam to total flow at turbine inlet and outlet, respectively. Heat at the end of the LP section is condensed and used for district heating production. Condensed steam is recycled back to the boiler for superheating. Waste water from the bio-oil hydrotreatment unit is used as feed water make-up after treatment in the onsite waste water treatment plant. In order to preserve the catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis cases, a portion of the flue gas was recycled back to the boiler in order to control furnace temperature. 2.3.6 Synthetic natural gas (SNG) production The SNG is produced mainly from biorefinery non-condensable off-gases, while additional hydrogen is provided by water electrolysis. The fast pyrolysis non-condensable off-gases consist mainly of CO and CO2, while the non-condensable off-gases from FPBO upgrading consist mainly of CO2 and CH4. Following reforming, the produced syngas is converted catalytically to methane according to reactions in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5): (4) CO + 3H2 = CH4 + H2O (5) CO2 + 4H2 = CH4 + 2H2O A conventional alkaline electrolyser (AEL) has been assumed, with an average nominal stack efficiency (LHV) of 65% as suggested in Buttler and Spliethoff [39]. The water electrolysis process is assumed to be powered by low-carbon electricity. Water is first pumped to the electrolyser pressure at 20 bar. The electrolysis temperature is 90°C in order to allow for district heat production. District heat production from the electrolysis is assumed at 35% efficiency. A detailed description of SNG modelling in Aspen is available in Hannula [33]."
5,Performance analysis,"2.4 Performance analysis We evaluate the examined biorefineries based on their mass, energy and carbon balances derived from the Aspen model simulations. All investigated biorefinery configurations are self-sufficient in terms of heat except the TFP case, but the enhanced hydrogen cases, on the other hand, rely on an external hydrogen source. The following metrics are calculated to assist the investigation: 1. First-law efficiency from biomass to biofuel (gasoline, diesel, heavy hydrocarbons and SNG) in Eq. (6): (6) η b i o f u e l = ( Σ Q b i o f u e l Q f e e d s t o c k + P n e t ) , where ΣQ biofuel is the total biofuel output in MW (LHV), Q feedstock is feedstock to the pyrolysis plant in MW (LHV, wet), including boiler feedstock in MW (LHV, wet) for the TFP case, and P net is the net electricity requirement (MW) of the process (electricity use minus own production). 2. The overall efficiency according to Eq. (7): (7) η o v e r a l l = ( Σ Q b i o f u e l + D H n e t Q f e e d s t o c k + P n e t ) , where DH net is the net district heat (MW) output (heat output minus own use). Only excess heat, or heat at temperatures above 85°C (temperature level of district heat output) is taken into account. The recovery of waste heat is assumed to provide the required low-temperature utilities. 3. Carbon efficiency according to Eq. (8): (8) η c a r b o n = ( C b i o f u e l C f e e d s t o c k ) , where C biofuel is the total carbon mass flow (kg/s) in all the biofuel products, and C feedstock is the total carbon mass flow (kg/s) in the pyrolysis (and additional boiler) feedstock. 4. Efficiency of hydrogen enhancement according to Eq. (9): (9) η e n h a n c e m e n t = ( Q S N G Δ P n e t ) , where QSNG is the total SNG output in MW (LHV) and ΔPnet is the difference in net electricity requirement between the enhanced and non-enhanced process configuration."
6,Results,"Mass and energy balances were simulated for four different biorefinery configurations; thermal fast pyrolysis or catalytic pyrolysis followed by hydrotreatment into diesel and gasoline fractions (TFP and CAT), and thermal fast pyrolysis or catalytic pyrolysis with SNG production using external hydrogen source to boost carbon efficiency (TFP+ and CAT+). The total pyrolysis feedstock feed to all evaluated concepts was 2000 metric tonnes per day dried feed (8.0 wt-% moisture), which corresponds to 387.5 MW (LHV) wet forest residues (50 wt-% moisture). In addition, the TFP concept required 20.2 MW (LHV) supplementary boiler fuel. Only main results are presented in this section, while process layouts, detailed mass, energy and carbon balances, and electricity, district heating and steam balances are presented in Appendices A, B, C and D. Main simulation results are presented in Table 3 . Total biofuel production is 226.2 MW and 162.0 MW for TFP and CAT, respectively. The significant difference is explained by the lower organic vapour yield from the catalytic pyrolysis process compared to thermal fast pyrolysis. As a result, more of the feedstock carbon ends up in the gas and aqueous phase, which are combusted in the CHP and subsequently vented as CO2. In the enhanced hydrogen cases TFP+ and CAT+, the total biofuel output increases considerably. For the TFP + case the biofuel output is almost doubled, to 412.9 MW, while for the CAT + case the total biofuel production is more than doubled, to 399.1 MW. The higher increase in biofuel production from CAT to CAT+ (compared to going from TFP to TFP+) is again explained by the higher share of feedstock carbon ending up as gas in catalytic pyrolysis. We also calculate the efficiency of enhancing biofuel production with electrical energy via hydrogen, ηenhancement. These are 60.3% for the TFP+ and 69.6% for the CAT + case. The share of boiler feedstock types is illustrated in Figure C1 in Appendix C. For all examined biorefinery concepts, char constitutes the main CHP boiler fuel, followed by non-condensable gas. For the TFP case, however, the pyrolytic conversion of feedstock to organic yield is high, which means the yield of char and non-condensable gas is lower. Combined with a lower gas yield from the hydrotreatment compared to the CAT case, the total gas and char yields are not sufficient to fuel the entire biorefinery. In the hydrogen enhanced cases the non-condensable gas is used as feedstock for making syngas, thus lowering the total fuel flow to the CHP. On the other hand, condensate from the CHP is used as cooling medium in the methanation process. The resulting steam generated during methanation is fed back to the CHP steam cycle. Steam fed back to the CHP is 42.6 MW and 55.8 MW for the TFP+ and CAT + concepts, respectively. This amount of added steam is sufficient to support the operation of the biorefinery, and no additional boiler fuel is needed in the enhanced cases. A consequence of less non-condensable gas being combusted in the CHP in the enhanced hydrogen cases is lower electricity and district heating production. Steam is also produced in the hydrogen plant (base cases), but this steam is consumed in the reformer. The CHP boiler is sized according to the flows of char, aqueous phase and excess non-condensable gas from the pyrolysis processes. For the TFP case, where additional boiler fuel is required, excess district heating production was kept to an operational minimum, resulting in a district heating production of negligible 3.4 MWth. This district heating is too low to be considered for export to regional district heating networks, but was still included in the efficiency calculations. District heating is also produced during methanation and in the electrolyser unit. The district heating balance is presented in Table B3 in Appendix B, and the allocation of district heating production from the different process units is illustrated in Figure C2 in Appendix C. The total biorefinery output is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The oxygen content of the raw bio-oils is 37.7 wt-% and 16.6 wt-% for TFP and CAT bio-oils, respectively. Similarly, the moisture content is 28.7 wt-% and 5.5 wt-%, for TFP and CAT bio-oils, respectively. The catalytic bio-oil oxygen and moisture contents are lower than what has been reported as typical levels in literature (see section 2.3.2. The reason is the choice of model compounds to represent the bio-oil fraction in the simulation model. Please refer to Onarheim et al. [34] for a detailed description on the selection of model components for process modelling in Aspen Plus. The performance metrics related to overall production of biofuel and heat (η overall ), biofuel production (η biofuel ), and carbon efficiency (η carbon ) are summarized in Table 3. The biofuel production performance (η biofuel ) is in line with previously reported assessments as described in Sections 1 and 2. The highest performance of biofuel production is realized with the TFP+ concept being 60.7%. The corresponding performance of the CAT+ concept is slightly lower at 58.0%. The base cases, producing less biofuel with the same amount of biomass feedstock, perform significantly poorer at 55.5% (TFP) and at 41.8% (CAT). The best overall biorefinery performance (η overall ), where net electricity and district heating production have been taken into account in addition to biofuel production, is realized by the CAT+ case at 67.2%, closely followed by the TFP+ case at 65.1%. The base cases reach overall efficiencies of 56.3% (TFP) and 54.0% (CAT). The overall and biofuel efficiencies of the catalytic pyrolysis concepts score similarly, and partly even better than the thermal fast pyrolysis concepts, despite the lower organic yield from catalytic pyrolysis. The reason is that part of the organic yield is diverted to the aqueous phase instead of to the organic phase (bio-oil). In addition, the catalytic pyrolysis reaction produce more non-condensable gas at the expense of organic yield. Consequently, the loss in biofuels refined from the bio-oil is compensated by a higher rate of SNG production in the CAT+ case. The same trend is seen in the carbon efficiency as well, where the CAT case reaches a very low efficiency at 28.9% compared to the TFP case at 40.5% because of the low catalytic conversion of feedstock to organic vapours in the pyrolysis process. This ratio is somewhat improved when taking into account SNG production and comparing the TFP+ and CAT+ cases at 66.3% and 58.6%, respectively. The carbon flows of the biorefinery configurations are illustrated in Fig. 4 . For the base cases, around 2/3 of the carbon from the feedstock ends up in the CHP flue gas as CO2. In the hydrogen enhanced cases the amount of carbon vented as CO2 is reduced to 56–59% compared to the base cases. The reduction in CO2 emissions from TFP to TFP + amounts to 368.1 kt/a, and the corresponding reduction in CO2 emissions from CAT to CAT+ is 388.3 kt/a. These CO2 emissions include only emissions inside the biorefinery plant gates, as up-and downstream CO2 emissions related to feedstock harvesting, transport, electricity generation, and the subsequent use of biorefinery products have not been taken into consideration."
7,Discussion,"The thermal fast pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis processes are typically self-sustained in terms of heat and electricity, and depending on feedstock and configuration, the processes even produce excess heat and electricity that can be exported to the national electricity grid and local district heating networks. The hydrogen enhanced designs, however, require significant input of electricity for the electrolyser (0.6–0.7 MJ/MJ feedstock). A major aspect when assessing these enhanced hydrogen concepts is the carbon intensity of the imported electricity, as electrical emissions govern the overall carbon emissions of the process [40]. Consequently, it is crucial that electricity used for the electrolyser is based on a low-carbon source. Low-cost, low-carbon electricity must be constantly available regardless of seasonal or weather fluctuations [41]. This could be prohibitive to continuous hydrogen boosting in some regions. Important quality properties for fast pyrolysis bio-oil as a transport biofuel are water and oxygen content. The thermal fast pyrolysis bio-oil, although providing a higher organic yield than catalytic pyrolysis, has a significantly higher water and oxygen content compared to the catalytic pyrolysis bio-oil. This trade-off correlation of quality versus quantity is clearly seen in Table 3, although interpretations of results must take into account the use of model compounds to represent the organic yield fraction. In essence, catalytic pyrolysis improves the quality as primarily intended, and thus the stability and applicability of the bio-oil with regards to biofuels. However, as a result of catalyst properties and their effect on the pyrolysis reactions, the total yield decreases compared to thermal fast pyrolysis. In addition, as catalytic bio-oil undergoes phase separation, a significant share of the organic components end up in the aqueous phase, further reducing the final bio-oil yield of catalytic pyrolysis. Table 4 presents case-specific savings in biomass feedstock for the two enhanced hydrogen cases. With a lower heating value of 8.4 MJ/kg for the forest residue feedstock, the additional biofuel produced by the enhanced hydrogen cases (186.7 MW and 237.1 MW SNG for TFP+ and CAT+, respectively) translates into a corresponding biomass resource flow of 642.5 kt/a and 815.9 kt/a. Assuming a density of 0.4 tonnes forest residue per cubic metre, this again translates into a biomass resource saving potential of 1.6 million m3/a and 2.0 million m3/a for the TFP+ and CAT+ cases, respectively, for the evaluated 2000 dry tpd (1400 kt/a wet feedstock) biorefineries. The IEA’s 2°C scenario projects 26 EJ/a need for biofuels by 2050. If all of it would be produced via pyrolysis-based biorefineries as presented in this work, the base cases would require 46.9 EJ/a (TFP) and 62.2 EJ/a (CAT) of biomass resources, while the enhanced hydrogen cases would only require 24.4 EJ/a (TFP+) and 25.2 EJ/a (CAT). This would lead to savings in biomass resources of 22.5 EJ/a (TFP+) and 36.9 EJ/a (CAT+). As already mentioned, the flipside of the coin is the significant requirement of low-carbon electricity needed to produce hydrogen for the enhanced hydrogen concepts. This additional electricity demand amounts to 20.1 EJ/a (5571 TWh/a) and 22.0 EJ/a (6106 TWh/a) for the TFP+ and CAT+ cases, respectively (assuming an alkaline water electrolysis operating at 65% (LHV) system efficiency). Ultimately, the attractiveness of the hydrogen enhanced biorefineries comes down to the cost and availability of biomass versus low-carbon electricity as the efficiency of converting electricity into fuel is around 50%, or the same as for converting biomass into fuel via pyrolysis. Fig. 5 illustrates the amount of resources required to produce 100 MW (LHV) biofuel output (gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbons from pyrolysis, and SNG in the enhanced hydrogen cases). As stated above, the enhanced hydrogen cases use significantly less biomass for generating the same amount of biofuel. However, the trade-off is a very significant need for electricity to drive hydrogen production. Still, the total energy input (biomass + electricity) is lower for the hydrogen enhanced cases than for the base cases. The next step in this work would be to evaluate the economic efficiency and greenhouse gas balance of the processes. An economic analysis of this type of processes would be of practical interest. However, this is a substantial undertaking, and goes beyond the main scope of this work which was to examine how hydrogen enhancement could be applied to pyrolysis and how it would impact mass and energy balances."
8,Conclusions,"A detailed investigation of the impact of enhancing biofuel production with hydrogen in pyrolysis-based biorefineries has been presented. The results show that the use of electrolytic hydrogen has potential to reduce the need for biomass resources by 48.2% and 61.2% for the thermal fast pyrolysis and catalytic fast pyrolysis, respectively. The improved biomass resource (carbon) efficiency of the hydrogen enhanced biorefinery designs would free up more biomass resources for competing utilization purposes. The hydrogen enhanced concepts would require 22.5 EJ/a or 36.9 EJ/a less of biomass to produce the 26 EJ/a of biofuels by 2050, as projected in the IEA’s 2°C scenario. The significant trade-off to the improved carbon efficiency is the additional input of electricity required for producing the hydrogen, which amounts to 20.1 EJ/a (5571 TWh/a) and 22.0 EJ/a (6106 TWh/a) for TFP+ and CAT+, respectively."
