0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy is very attractive as an alternative energy source in terms of easy storage and transport. Regarding global warming due to the greenhouse effect, if hydrogen production without CO2 emission is achieved, it would be invaluable even if its running costs are somewhat higher than those for natural gas pyrolysis that emits CO2 gas [1,2]. Many efforts have been made in the field of nuclear energy to apply nuclear heat for producing hydrogen by thermochemical processes without CO2 emission [3–5]. Most of these production processes employ sulfuric acid decomposition at high temperature that inevitably induces corrosive conditions, which demand corrosion-resistive components for the reaction vessels [4]. In radiation chemistry, however, the γ -radiolysis of water as well as of aqueous solutions can produce hydrogen at room temperature without CO2 emission. The reaction mechanisms to form the product H2 have been well understood, and the yields of hydrogen formed and the kinetics of its precursors have been studied in detail [6–10]. Nevertheless, the pursuit of suitable solutions that effectively produce hydrogen is useful for achieving a lower cost hydrogen production system which causes neither CO2 emission nor deterioration of component. For this purpose we have been interested in heterogeneous systems consisting of a mixture of solid and aqueous solutions with an expectation that chemical reactions including hydrogen formation may be enhanced due to the presence of solids. When solids exist in solutions, exited electrons produced from the solids under γ -irradiation are added to those from the solutions. Although the mechanism of hydrogen formation from heterogeneous systems has not been clearly understood, the enhancement in the yield of hydrogen may be ascribed, at least qualitatively, to the enhancement of excited electron yields. It is known that electrons, which act as a reducing agent, contribute to the formation of H2 gas [6–9]. In fact there have been reports of the enhanced H2 formation as well as of reduction of ions due to the coexistence of solids and water [11–17]. In this experiment, we investigate the effect of aqueous H2SO4 solutions admixed with solids in 60Co γ -radiolysis on hydrogen production. This is done in order to find the experimental conditions for enhanced hydrogen yields from the viewpoint of a future use of high-level radioactive wastes (HLWs) for efficient hydrogen production. It is noteworthy that 137Cs, which is the dominant γ -source of HLWs, can be used as a γ -source for this experiment, and its use promotes a new aspect of HLWs applications for hydrogen production."
1,Experiment,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Each of the oxides— α -Al2O3, TiO2 (anatase), ZrO2, SiO2 (quartz) and SiO 2 · n H 2 O (silica gel)—was used as a material to be added to an aqueous H2SO4 solution to obtain a heterogeneous system. All oxides were purchased as powder, and their specific surface areas and average powder sizes are listed in Table 1 . These materials were selected not only for being corrosion-resistive in sulfuric acid solution but also for their stability under γ -irradiation. Since their energy band gaps ( E g ) were as wide as 7.0–9.9eV for Al2O3, 2.9–3.75eV for TiO2, 4.9eV for ZrO2 and 8.0–11.0eV for SiO2 [18], the photolysis of water containing most of these oxides was unlikely to produce hydrogen gas. This is because electrons are hardly excited from a valence band to a conduction band by visible or near UV light radiation in these oxides [19]. On the other hand, we can expect that γ -radiation can produce excited electrons associated with enhanced hydrogen formation. In addition, the high penetration capability of γ -radiation can increase the reaction volume as compared to photolysis in any experimental conditions, which would result in increasing the total volume of hydrogen gas produced."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation Samples for γ -irradiation were composed of aqueous H2SO4 solution, oxide and air space: a certain amount of oxide powder was added to a 2ml aqueous H2SO4 solution in a vial of about 5ml, and the mouth of the vial was sealed by screwing a cap with a septum of PTFE/silicone. The air space of the vial (about 3ml in volume) was not in general converted into N2 gas prior to γ -irradiation, but was bubbled with N2 gas for deaeration when CH3OH was added to dilute H2SO4 solutions or 100% CH3OH solutions. The maximum amount of oxide added in a 2ml solution depended on the bulk density of the oxide powder in 0.4M H2SO4 solution as listed in Table 1: for instance, 70wt% was possible in the case of ZrO2 powder, 50wt% for α -Al2O3 powder, 50wt% for SiO 2 · n H 2 O powder and 33wt% for TiO2 powder. Water purified by distillation and deionization, whose electric conductance was nominally < 0.05 μ S , was used for water radiolysis experiment as well as for dilution of 98wt% H2SO4 solution to obtain a certain aqueous H2SO4 concentration. The prepared concentration ranged from 0.2 to 4M prior to addition of oxide powder. The measured pH of the purified water, which was exposed to air, was 5.8 prior to γ -radiolysis due to absorption of CO2 in air and shifted to 6.9 after γ -radiolysis probably because of reduction induced by hydrated electrons ( e aq - ) originated from γ -irradiation [6]."
4,γ -ray irradiation,"2.3 γ -ray irradiation Irradiation of γ -rays at ambient temperature for low dose experiments ( < 10 kGy ) was performed using a 60Co γ -source at JAEA-Tokai with a dose rate of about 1kGy/h, while for high dose experiments ( > 10 kGy ) a 60Co γ -source at JAEA-Takasaki with a dose rate of 10–30kGy/h was used. Here, the value of 1kGy is equivalent to the energy of 1kJ absorbed in a mass of 1kg. Our experiments were mainly intended to show the qualitative tendencies of heterogeneous effects in a fairly wide range of combinations of oxides and aqueous sulfuric solutions under a simple experimental setup: each of the 10 vials was positioned at a similar distance without stirring the solutions, which allowed us to obtain a lot of data quickly. Chemical dosimeters of both aqueous dichromate and ceric sulfate systems were used for < 10 kGy [6]. For > 10 kGy cellulose triacetate (CTA) films of Fuji FTR-125 were used for dose measurements [20]. The films were set both in front and behind a selected vial positioned at a certain distance from the 60Co γ -source, and their average value was used not only for the absorbed dose of the vial but also for those of other vials positioned at a similar distance from the 60Co γ -source. The absorbed doses, measured with CTA films, were not corrected for either sulfuric acid or oxide constituents in the aqueous solutions because the difference in mass energy absorption coefficients among substances of H2O, H2SO4, TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2 does not exceed 15% [6]. Moreover, the absorbed dose ratio of water to CTA film was estimated to be about 1.07 [21]. Consequently we used the doses of CTA films not only for water but also for aqueous H2SO4 solutions and heterogeneous systems. In addition, we simply regarded 1kGy of absorbed energy as 1J of energy absorbed in a volume of 1 ml without any corrections for all solutions used in this experiment."
5,Measurement of hydrogen production,"2.4 Measurement of hydrogen production The H2 gas produced and released in the air space of a vial was measured with gas chromatography (Shimazu Corp. GC-8A) equipped with a GC stainless steel column (6 m SHINCARBON ST, Shimazu) under a non-flow condition. The gas measurement was not carried out during γ -irradiation but done in one or two days after the irradiation due to the experimental conditions. Both injection and detector temperatures were set to 100°C for thermal conductivity measurements of H2, N2 and O2 gases. High purity Ar gas, which has a higher sensitivity for the detection of H2 gas compared with that for N2 or O2 gas, was employed as the carrier gas with a flow rate of about 30 ml/min. The column temperature was set at 80°C. We sampled 0.2ml gas in the air space of a vial and injected it into the GC with a Hamilton-type air-tight syringe. The total number of H2 molecules in the air space of the vial was evaluated by taking account of the total volume of the air space. The calibration of the H2 signal of gas chromatography was performed using standard gases composed of a mixture of argon and hydrogen. As mentioned above, the gas chromatography using Ar gas flow is not sensitive to N2 and O2, which hindered the precise analysis of O2 production. Of course, oxygen would have had some influence on the reaction processes, but our experimental results concerning H2 production did not show much difference for both deaerated solutions with N2 gas and non-deaerated ones."
6,Results and discussion,"An example of measured data for TiO2 powder in 0.4M H2SO4 solution is shown in Fig. 1 , where the GC signals of H2, O2 and N2 gases were clearly observed when it was irradiated with 60Co γ -rays, whereas no H2 signal was observed in the absence of irradiation. Other oxides such as Al2O3, SiO 2 · n H 2 O also gave no H2 signal in the case of non-irradiation. Figs. 2 and 3 show the dose dependence of the amounts of H2 produced in aqueous 0.4M H2SO4 solutions containing 33wt% oxide powder irradiated up to absorbed doses of 18 and 55kGy, respectively. Since the amounts of produced H2 increased proportionally with increasing solution volume, they were normalized to those for 1ml solution. As shown in Fig. 2, the obtained H2 production proportionally increased with increasing dose in the low dose region ( < 18 kGy ). The 0.4M H2SO4 solutions containing an oxide powder had H2 production rates larger than those without any, and water containing an oxide also had a higher rate of H2 production than just pure water. It is noteworthy that the amount of hydrogen produced in 0.4M H2SO4 solution was higher than that in pure water. Fig. 3 shows that the H2 production increased with increasing dose approximately up to 55kGy and exhibited tendencies similar to those in Fig. 2 even if the scatter of data increased with increasing absorbed dose. These experimental results clearly show that the effect of the addition of oxides on H2 production is substantial in the γ -radiolysis of aqueous solutions, which may be ascribed to the increase in electrons originated from secondary electrons as well as excitation. In the energy of 60Co γ -radiation, secondary electrons are produced mainly from the Compton effect in solids [9]. The experimental results in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that the effect of sulfuric acid solution is effective in both heterogeneous ( liquid + solid ) and homogeneous (liquid alone) systems. Here, we estimate G values of the final product H2, G f ( H 2 ) , which are the number of H2 molecules produced when 100eV is absorbed in a solution. The final product yields of H2 expressed in the unit of μ mol H 2 / ml / kGy were obtained from dividing the amounts of the H2 production shown in Figs. 2 and 3 by their absorbed doses. The conversion factor from the final product yields to the G f ( H 2 ) values is 9.65 (molecules/100eV) for 1 μ mol H 2 / ml / kGy , which is equivalent to 1 μ mol H 2 / J in the case of water. We used this factor for all solutions containing oxides in this study. The averaged G f ( H 2 ) obtained from the results of Figs. 2 and 3 are shown in Table 2 . It should be mentioned that the G f ( H 2 ) for pure water obtained here is fairly small compared with the primary yield of H2, G ( H 2 ) , namely 0.45–0.47, which is obtained at about 10 - 7 s after γ -irradiation [6,9]. The main reason for this difference could be that the present G f ( H 2 ) values were obtained by measuring H2 molecules that diffused from the liquid to the air space. The number of H2 molecules diffused out should be invariably reduced from that of the primary H2 molecules formed in the liquid under γ -irradiation. This is because the dissociation of H2 molecules occurs during diffusion due to the formation of H2O from the reverse reaction between H2 molecules and OH radicals in the liquid. From the viewpoint of the industrial application of hydrogen gas production by this method, the present G f ( H 2 ) values appears to be noted for the estimation of hydrogen production. To increase the final product yields of H2, OH radicals should be scavenged as discussed later so that most of the H2 molecules can be released into the air space and increase the final product H2 due to negligible H2 gas solubility in water: The molar fraction solubility of H2 in H2O is 1.46 × 10 - 5 at 298K [22]. To study the effect of oxide concentration on the final product yields of H2, we measured H2 production with changing oxide concentration in 0.4M H2SO4 aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 4 , the amounts of oxide admixture have a strong effect on the measured final product yields of H2, which generally increased with increasing oxide concentration. In the case of ZrO2 powder the yield exhibited a small increase up to oxide concentration of 33wt% but continued to increase up to 60wt% and then decreased over 70wt%. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the maximum amount of oxide added in solution depended on its bulk density. The ZrO2 powder with a higher bulk density seems to need more powder volume to obtain a yield similar to those of other oxides. The above results suggest that higher H2 production yield can be obtained by increasing the number of powder particles fully in contact with and/or covered with aqueous sulfuric acid solution. The increase of oxide powder in the solution increases not only the contact area between the oxide surface and the solution but also the radiation energy transfer from solid to solution to produce excited electrons that play an important role in both reduction of H + ion and production of H2 molecules as discussed later. Concerning the role of chemisorbed water on oxide surface in order to enhance H2 production yields, the discussion has been made from a viewpoint of the energy transfer from the oxide to water, for example, by an exciton model [12–15]. It has been pointed out that it is not the primary surface area of the nanopowder oxides but the agglomerated surface area which contributed to the increased H2 production [16]. The water and metal systems were also studied from a viewpoint of secondary electron emission from metals [17]. Concerning the effect of specific surface area on the final product yields of H2, oxides with larger specific surface area did not necessarily have larger yields, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, where Al2O3 powder with a smaller specific surface area took yields similar to those of silica gel SiO 2 · n H 2 O . Therefore, the reason why silica gel took the final product yields of H2 larger than quartz type SiO2 in Fig. 4 is still open to question: What is the dominant factor—the specific surface area, the structure of solid or the effect of nH2O? Concerning the effect of H2SO4 concentration on final product yields of H2, Fig. 5 shows that the yields increased with increasing H2SO4 concentration in a solution containing Al2O3 powder of 0.2g (9.1wt%) or ZrO2 powder of 1g (33wt%). A similar tendency was observed for aqueous H2SO4 solution without oxide. On the other hand when the amounts of their oxides increased, the maximum peaks appeared around 0.4–1M. Similar peaks were also observed in TiO2 and SiO 2 · n H 2 O powders. These results exhibit that a certain amount of oxide is necessary for the appearance of the maximum peak in H2SO4 concentration dependence, and suggest that the interface between oxide surface and solution plays an important role in H2 formation. The increase in the yields of H2 from pure water to 1M H2SO4 solution would be related to the increase of H + ion concentration around the interface where the attraction of the positive hydrogen ion toward the oxide surface can be expected in the potential between oxide surface and near-surface solution. The increase of H + concentration could eventually increase the production yield of H2 as discussed later. The decrease in the yields with increasing acidity from 2 to 4M can be correlated with the charge effects of concentrated H + ions [23]. Let us discuss here the reaction schemes in the radiolysis of an aqueous H2SO4 solution. It is known that the following reaction scheme contributes to the production of hydrogen atoms at pH < 3 [6,7,9,24]: (1) e aq - + H 3 O + ( or H + ) → H . In addition to Eq. (1), since HSO 4 - is a dominant species in the present sulfuric acid concentration range (0–4M) [24], the following reaction scheme in an aqueous H2SO4 solution is favorable for scavenging of OH radicals produced from water dissociation during γ -irradiation [25,26]: (2) OH + HSO 4 - → SO 4 - + H 2 O . Since OH radicals act as scavenging e aq - or H and eventually form OH - or H2O, the decrease of the OH radical concentration results in an increase in the concentration of H atoms in the solution, which leads to an increase in Hz production rate. Other possibilities of producing H atoms are the direct dissociation of HSO 4 - and SO 4 2 - in concentrated sulfuric acid solutions [24,26,27]: (3) HSO 4 - HSO 4 + e - → SO 4 - + H , (4) SO 4 2 - SO 4 - + e - → H + SO 4 - + H . Eqs. (3) and (4) can also increase the Hz concentration. Our results of H2SO4 aqueous solution alone, as shown in Fig. 5, exhibit that the measured final product yields of H2 increased with increasing acidity at least up to 3M. According to published literature [6–9], however, the higher H concentration obtained at pH < 3 did not necessarily contribute to the increase in the primary yield of H2, G ( H 2 ) . As mentioned previously, we measured the amount of H2 gas released into air space in one or two days after γ -irradiation. These experimental conditions may also affect the differences between the H2 primary yields and our final product yield of H2. Let us discuss here the effect of CH3OH addition to aqueous solutions on H2 production. As mentioned above, it is essential to scavenge produced OH radicals for increasing Hz concentration. The OH radicals can be scavenged due to their reaction with CH3OH as (5) OH + CH 3 OH → H 2 O + CH 2 OH . It is also known that the following reaction produces H2 molecules [6,9]: (6) H + CH 3 OH → H 2 + CH 2 OH . From the viewpoint of hydrogen economy, the hydrogen production system should be as simple as possible. We estimated the necessary amount of CH3OH addition, of which a smaller value is preferable. Then we selected 1% CH3OH addition to water as well as to 0.4M H2SO4 solution for effective scavenging OH radicals: 20 μ l CH3OH in 2 ml aqueous solution. The estimation procedure is as follows: in Eqs. (5) and (6) the rate constants are about 9.7 × 10 8 and 2.6 × 10 6 l / mol / s , respectively, [28]. Since the concentration of 20 μ l CH3OH ( ρ CH 3 OH = 0.79 kg / l ) in 2ml aqueous solution is equivalent to 0.25mol/l, their reaction rates are about 2.4 × 10 8 and 6.5 × 10 5 s - 1 , respectively. Concerning the scavenging of OH radicals, the reaction rate of Eq. (2) is estimated about 1.9 × 10 5 s - 1 for 0.4M H2SO4 where the rate constant is 4.7 × 10 5 l / mol / s [27]. Therefore, the scavenging power of 1% CH3OH is quite effective compared with that of HSO 4 - , and 1% CH3OH concentration is sufficient for scavenging OH radicals. As shown in Fig. 6 , the experimental results of the effect of CH3OH addition clearly exhibit the enhancement of the final product yields of H2. The yields decreased in descending order: Oxide+0.4M H2SO4 + 1 % CH3OH > Oxide + 100% CH3OH > Oxide + 0.4 M H2SO4 when oxide was contained, whereas 0.4M H2SO4 + 1 % CH3OH > 100% CH3OH > pure water + 1 % CH3OH > 0.4M H2SO4 > pure water when oxide was not contained. The G f ( H 2 ) values obtained from the results of Fig. 6 are listed in Table 3 for the samples of SiO2 · n H2O (0.4M H2SO4 + 1 % CH3OH), Al2O3 (0.4M H2SO4 + 1 % CH3OH), 0.4M H2SO4 + 1 % CH3OH, water + 1 % CH3OH and 100% CH3OH. It is known that the primary yield of H2, G ( H 2 ) , is 5.6 (molecules/100eV) in 100% CH3OH solution, which is about 10 times larger than that in water [6]. The result of the G f ( H 2 ) in this study was 3.4 in 100% CH3OH, which is reasonable from the viewpoint of our experimental setup as already described. It is noteworthy that whether oxide exists or not, the addition of 1% CH3OH to an aqueous H2SO4 solution produces H2 yield larger than the 100% CH3OH solution or pure water+1% CH3OH. This suggests that the effects of H2SO4, pure water and CH3OH are mutually cooperative in increasing the final product of H2 molecules. Finally, it should be noted that since the present solutions were not stirred, the oxide concentrations did not represent homogenized solutions but ratios of oxide weight to solution weight. If these solutions were stirred, a much smaller amount of added powder may effectively enhance the H2 production by increasing the wettability of fine powder particle to aqueous H2SO4 solution as well as due to easy release of H2 molecules from liquid to air space. However, for the future application of this method to the case of 137Cs γ -rays radiation in HLWs in disposal sites, non-stirring systems will be favorable in view of the system's simplicity and the running cost. The total amount of H2 produced can be easily increased by increasing the volume of solution in this system, which is achievable due to the high penetration of γ -radiation. It would not be difficult to realize it by means of either increasing the volume of each solution in a sub-system or the number of sub-systems comprising the total system. Of course it is necessary to extract hydrogen gas from air through hydrogen separator and to pressurize it into, for example, metal alloys for hydrogen storage."
7,Conclusion,"The measured final product yields of H2 in 60Co γ -radiolysis for aqueous H2SO4 solutions containing oxide powder have clearly exhibited enhanced H2 yields compared with those without oxides due to the contribution of electrons originated from oxides. This enhancement was stimulated by increasing the amount of oxide powder up to a certain level depending on the bulk density of the powder. The yields depended on the H2SO4 concentration of the aqueous solution and had a maximum around 0.4–1M only when the amount of oxide powder was large enough. These results suggest that the oxide surface and/or near surface in the heterogeneous systems would play a key role in increasing H2 production in γ -radiolysis of aqueous H2SO4 solution. All solutions examined in this study exhibited strongly enhanced final production yields of H2 by adding 1vol% CH3OH. The yields of aqueous H2SO4 solutions added with 1vol% CH3OH surpassed that of 100% CH3OH solution. Therefore, the coexistence of water, sulfuric acid and alcohol was quite effective for increasing the final product H2 gas in γ -radiolysis."
