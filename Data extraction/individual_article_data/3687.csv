0,Introduction,"Development of efficient fuel reforming technologies (steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX), and autothermal reforming (ATR)) is generally deemed to be the most promising route towards near-and mid-term diversification of the available energy sources and establishment of the so-called hydrogen economy (Holladay et al., 2009; Navarro et al., 2007; Rostrup-Nielsen and Nielsen, 2004; Trimm and Onsan, 2001). Aside from large-scale hydrogen utilization, as a clean power source down the line, fuel reforming can evolve into a major technology for production of a number of chemicals and other fuels, such as sulfur-free synthetic diesel, syncrude and methanol in gas-to-liquid (GTL) processes (Keshav and Basu, 2007; Rostrup-Nielsen, 2005; Tonkovich et al., 2008). The choice of reforming fuel depends on various factors, such as the type of application, the fuel availability locally, the existing infrastructure, and the cost of fuel production and its environmental footprint. More specifically, for portable applications (e.g., laptops) using fuel cells, liquid fuels or fuels than can easily be liquefied and transported, such as LPG, methanol, ethanol, and ammonia are possible candidates. In transportation, the aforementioned alcohols can also be used for onboard hydrogen production; however, the already existing infrastructure for gasoline may be the decisive factor. A possibly existing natural gas (NG) grid may promote this fuel for hydrogen production and electricity generation. Utilization of NG in remote and offshore locations is expected to increase. In certain rural areas, on the other hand, bio-ethanol, produced locally via enzymatic fermentation of biomass derivatives, may be the choice in covering local energy needs (e.g., farms). These different fuels are reformed at different rates and different temperatures in the gas or aqueous phase. This brings about new challenges in the design and operation of the fuel processing systems. Microreactor technology (sub-millimeter characteristic length scale) has been investigated over the last years as a “vehicle” to bring the reforming technologies to commercialization for applications ranging from portable systems, in which the reactor size is limited by the application size, to transportation and decentralized stationary systems (Anxionnaz et al., 2008; Holladay et al., 2004b; Mills et al., 2007; Norton et al., 2005; Shah and Besser, 2007; Tonkovich et al., 2005, 2004; Vlachos, 2009). Microreactors exhibit much higher heat and mass transport rates than conventional reactors, enabling downscaling of chemical processes. In previous work (Stefanidis and Vlachos, 2008a, 2008b; Stefanidis et al., 2009), we explored the feasibility and various design concepts of high-temperature methane SR in microscale catalytic plate reactors using fundamental chemistry models. Depending on the application, low-temperature alcohol reforming can be another attractive option, as mentioned above. Systematic experimental work on thermally coupled methanol combustion–reforming systems at microscales has been performed by Holladay et al. (2004a, 2002). Very recently Arzamendi et al. (2009) presented an interesting CFD modeling study. They investigated the effect of combustible and reforming stream flow rates at three microchannel gap sizes as well as different flow configurations. Open questions include whether low temperature reforming, which leads to low temperature exhaust streams, can be more efficient than high temperature reforming and how to design and operate these systems for short contact time operation. In this work, we perform an extensive parametric study for coupled methanol combustion–reforming in catalytic plate microreactors to identify operating regimes, where complete conversions of the combustible and reforming fuels are attained while avoiding possible overheating. A reaction zone analysis is performed and the roles of flow confinement and the wall material are analyzed. In addition, we simulate methane as an operating fuel (for combustion and reforming) under comparable conditions, in order to contrast low vs. high temperature combustion/reforming processes in terms of throughputs, power output, power and thermal efficiency as well as hot spot formation."
1,Model description,
2,Multifunctional device model,"2.1 Multifunctional device model We simulate a multifunctional catalytic plate microreactor shown in Fig. 1 combining three operations: catalytic combustion, catalytic reforming, and heat exchange between the former processes through a solid wall. Co-current flow configuration is modeled, which has been found to improve the thermal coupling between the two reactors and temperature uniformity, as opposed to counter-current flow configuration (Deshmukh and Vlachos, 2005a, 2005b). In the low temperature process, methanol combustion on Cu in one channel is thermally coupled with methanol SR on Pd in the other channel. In the high temperature process, methane catalytic combustion on Pt in one channel is thermally coupled with methane SR along with water–gas shift (WGS) on Rh in the other channel. The inlet methanol/air equivalence ratio in the combustion channel is set to 0.8. The inlet methane/air equivalence ratio is ∼0.88. Using these inlet compositions, the heat release upon complete combustion is the same for the two fuels at equal combustible mixture inlet velocities. The choice of equal heat inputs was dictated by our previous work, which showed that this leads to more meaningful comparison of different systems (Stefanidis and Vlachos, 2008b). The other nominal operating conditions along with the microreactor dimensions are quoted in Table 1 . We use a pseudo-2D reactor model as in previous works. In brief, the model consists of the mass and the energy balances for the gas and the solid phase (Kaisare et al., 2009; Stefanidis et al., 2009). The equations are written in the axial direction; transverse heat and mass fluxes between the bulk and the wall are accounted for through lumped transport coefficients, which depend on the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. In previous work (Kaisare et al., 2008; Stefanidis et al., 2008), we found that average, constant values of 4 and 3.8 for the Nu and Sh number, respectively, result in good quantitative agreement between our pseudo-2D code and the commercial CFD code FLUENT 6.2. (2004). The grid in the axial direction consists of 500 equally spaced nodes. The differential algebraic equation system is solved using the DASPK package (Petzold, 1983)."
3,Kinetic models,
4,Coupled methane reforming–combustion,"3.1 Coupled methane reforming–combustion Methane SR and WGS on Rh are represented by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively: (1) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 (2) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 These reactions are modeled using single-step rate expressions presented in Maestri et al. (2008). These have been derived through a posteriori reduction of the detailed microkinetic model of Maestri et al. (2009), which is an updated version of the original model of Mhadeshwar and Vlachos (2005). The lumped kinetic parameters in the reduced model are linked to the kinetic parameters of the microkinetic model and no a-priori assumptions with regard to the chemical pathways and the rate determining step are postulated. Methane catalytic combustion on Pt is represented by (3) CH 4 + 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O It is modeled using the single-step rate expression developed in Deshmukh and Vlachos (2007). This is also a product of a posteriori reduction of a detailed microkinetic model (Mhadeshwar, 2005). An activation energy of 10kcal/mol is used for the dissociative adsorption of methane on Pt, which is identified (via sensitivity analysis) as the rate determining step of the process."
5,Coupled methanol reforming–combustion,"3.2 Coupled methanol reforming–combustion Methanol SR on Pd/ZnO is expressed by (4) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2 The rate of Eq. (4) is modeled using the empirical power-law type of reaction rate expression from (Cao et al., 2004) (Eq. (5)) (5) - R C H 3 OH ( mmol / kg cat / s ) = 2.9047 × 1 0 10 e - 94800 / RT p MeOH 0.715 p H 2 O 0.088 , p i ( kPa ) The above is the rate of disappearance of methanol. CO2 and H2 are considered as the only products since only a small amount of CO (<2%) is formed under low temperature operation (Reuse et al., 2004). Methanol catalytic combustion on CuO/ZnO is expressed by (6) CH 3 OH + 1.5 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O The rate of Eq. (6) is modeled using also a power-law empirical reaction rate expression (Reitz et al., 2000) (7) - R C H 3 OH ( mol / g cat / min ) = 6 × 1 0 8 e - 115000 / RT p MeOH 0.18 p O 2 0.18 P H 2 O 0.14 , p i ( kPa ) Eq. (7) essentially represents the rate of methanol oxidation in the presence of steam in the methanol autothermal reforming process."
6,Catalyst loadings,"3.3 Catalyst loadings Meaningful comparison of the two processes (methanol vs. methane combustion/reforming) efficiency-wise requires comparable catalyst loadings. Therefore, equal catalyst loadings of 1.5mg/cm2 reactor and 2.5mg/cm2 reactor for combustion and reforming, respectively, are considered in the simulations (Casanovas et al., 2008). Assuming a metal surface area of 4m2/g, the loadings above correspond to catalyst/geometric surface areas of 60 and 100 for combustion and reforming, respectively. In our previous works involving methane reforming and propane combustion (Stefanidis and Vlachos, 2008a; Stefanidis et al., 2009), the corresponding nominal values were set to 1.7 and 1. Consequently, this work has been done with high catalyst loading as compared to our previous studies. The temperatures involved in SR and catalytic combustion of methane lead to sintering and thus, the older surface areas used may be more realistic for practical applications."
7,Methane vs. methanol reforming,
8,Reaction zone analysis,"4.1 Reaction zone analysis Fig. 2 (a) shows the methanol mass fraction profiles in the combustion and reforming channels at combustible and reforming velocities of 3 and 9.75m/s, respectively. Methanol combustion is very fast and reaches completion in <1cm from the entrance. On the other hand, methanol reforming is slower and reaches 99% conversion at the outlet. This is the breakthrough limit, defined herein as the reforming velocity at which 99% conversion of the reforming fuel is achieved for complete combustible conversion (in the adjacent channel) at a certain combustible velocity. For reforming velocities higher than the breakthrough one, the reforming fuel needs more energy flux than available from the combustible stream. Consequently, the conversion (of the reforming fuel) is incomplete. In contrast, for reforming velocities lower than the breakthrough one, the amount of combustible always suffices for complete conversion of the reforming fuel but temperatures become high and some of the combustible fuel is wasted. Previous work indicates that the breakthrough operating line (locus of points as a parameter, such as the combustible flow rate, varies) is an excellent design target (Kaisare et al., 2009; Stefanidis et al., 2009). As a result, in this work we trace mainly this operating line. Fig. 2(b) shows the combustion, reforming and wall temperature profiles at the breakthrough limit. The bulk gas temperatures in the two channels increase sharply, due to fast combustion near the entrance, up to a maximum value (note that at this scale, the temperatures of the two channels are indistinguishable). Past the peak temperature, the two channels and the wall are in thermal equilibrium (no transverse temperature gradients are observed) and the temperature decreases axially up to the outlet due to the endothermic reforming reaction (heat sink). Fig. 3 (a) and (b) are the counterparts of Fig. 2(a) and (b) in the case of coupled methane combustion–reforming at high temperature. Methane combustion at high temperatures is completed very fast like methanol (compare Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 2(a)). Due to the high catalyst loading, methane conversion in the reforming channel reaches ∼99%, within 1cm from the entrance. At this point the process is at equilibrium, as inferred from the composition of the products. Fig. 3(b) shows that the bulk gas temperatures in the two channels increase sharply in the reaction zones and reach a maximum of ∼1063K within ∼0.5cm from the inlet. Past this point, the net reaction rates are approximately zero and the bulk and wall temperatures remain constant as expected. Due to very narrow reaction zones and the high wall conductivity of 100W/m/K, the wall temperature profile remains nearly flat all along the reactor."
9,"Throughputs, power output and contact times","Fig. 4 is a comparison of the two processes at the loci of breakthrough points for different combustible velocities. The comparison is in terms of throughputs, represented via the ratio of reforming/combustible inlet velocities, and the power output, in the form of hydrogen (the energy content of CO is not accounted for in this calculation). It is remarked that a reactor width of 1cm is assumed to compute the flow rates required for the calculation of the power output from the microdevice. Fig. 4(a) shows that on the basis of equal heat input (equal inlet velocities of methane and methanol combustible mixtures with suitably balanced compositions), more than four times (∼4.1–5) higher methanol inlet velocities can be processed compared to methane or, equivalently, more than four times methanol moles are converted. This is reasonable given that the ratio of heats of reforming reactions between methane and methanol is ∼4.2 (=206/49kJ/mol) at 300K. Along the breakthrough line, the ratio of reforming to the combustible flow velocities varies only slightly. More importantly, this ratio can easily be estimated from an overall energy balance (Stefanidis et al., 2009). Fig. 4(b) shows that the amount of power produced in methanol reforming, calculated based on the lower heating value (LHV) of hydrogen at 300K, is ∼3.8–4.6 times more than in methane reforming. This range is lower than that of methanol to methane (reforming mixture) inlet velocities (∼4.1–5) discussed above, because the WGS reaction in the methane reforming (Eq. (2)) pushes the hydrogen molar yield per mol of converted methane to be higher than 3 (for steam-rich mixtures). The latter is the value dictated by the reforming reaction stoichiometries (Eqs. (1) and (4)). Importantly, Fig. 4(b) indicates that a single device can be used to produce variable power (over a range) by simply dialing in the combustible flow rate and changing proportionally the reforming flow rate (according to Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4 corresponds to a wall conductivity of 100W/m/K. However, the results herein are only slightly different for moderate and low conductivity materials (not shown). A more detailed discussion on the role of the wall material in hot spot formation and temperature gradients in the wall follows in the next section. A comparison of the two processes in terms of contact time ( t c ) (herein defined as t c = ∫ 0 l active dz / u local , i.e., in the active part of the reactor—up to 99% conversion), at the breakthrough points of Fig. 4, reveals that t c ∼ 1 ms for methane reforming and t c ∼ 2 - 12 ms for methanol reforming. This shows that not only high-temperature methane reforming but also low-temperature methanol reforming can stably be operated at microscales, over a wide operating velocity window, at contact times ranging from as low as a couple of milliseconds to (possibly) a couple of tens of milliseconds (at lower temperatures and catalyst loadings than those considered here)."
10,Effect of wall material,"Fig. 5 (a) shows the maximum reactor temperature (always located at the wall) vs. wall conductivity at three breakthrough points, corresponding to combustible (methane and methanol) mixture inlet velocities of 1, 3 and 6m/s (first, third and sixth point from the left in Fig. 4). Three wall conductivities of 3, 15 and 100W/m/K are considered. The first one represents low conductivity ceramics, such as silica or cordierite; the second one represents stainless steel, and the third one, metals or high conductivity ceramics, such as silicon carbide. Fig. 5(a) shows that the maximum temperature increases with decreasing wall conductivity in the case of methanol, but appears almost insensitive in the case of methane; in fact, it increases only by a few degrees (not visible due to the scale). The latter is due to the better combustion and reforming zone overlap in the case of methane caused from high catalyst loading. On the contrary, at low temperatures, methanol combustion is accomplished fast but the methanol reforming zone spans the entire reactor length at breakthrough. Consequently, in the former (methane) case, reforming acts more competitively, as a heat removal mechanism, to axial heat conduction, thus alleviating its effect on the maximum temperature. The effect of wall conductivity on the maximum temperature in methane reforming at low catalyst loading is somewhat more pronounced (c.a. Stefanidis et al., 2009, Fig. 8). Fig. 5(b) shows the maximum temperature difference along the wall vs. wall conductivity at the same breakthrough limits as in Fig. 5(a). A descending trend in the maximum axial temperature difference with increasing wall conductivity is observed for both methanol and methane at all velocities studied. Clearly, low conductivity materials promote axial temperature differences for both fuels up to 150K in the examined velocity range. This temperature difference, however, is considerably lower than what is observed in methane reforming at low catalyst loading (Stefanidis et al., 2009, Fig. 8). This is again due to improved reaction zone overlap in the present case. Altogether, low conductivity materials (i.e., ceramics) are detrimental in terms of hot spot formation and axial temperature gradients both for low and high temperature reforming. However, improved combustion and reforming zone overlap, via an appropriate choice of the reforming catalyst loading and gap sizes, can mitigate the problem. A general strategy to achieve this will be presented in future work."
11,Effect of device gap sizes,"Figs. 6 and 7 depict the role of combustion and reforming channel gap sizes, respectively. Fig. 6(a) shows the conversion of combustible (methane or methanol) vs. normalized combustion channel gap size. The combustible stream flow rate is kept constant (and thus, u 1 inlet · d 1 = constant ) at that of the breakthrough limit for the nominal gap size ( d 1 o = 0.03 cm ) at two inlet combustion velocities of 3m/s (open symbols) and 6m/s (filled symbols). To assist the analysis, we use the concept of transverse Damkholer number, D a t , which is defined as the local transverse diffusion vs. reaction time scale: (8) D a t = τ diff . τ reac . = d 1 2 / 4 D f C f / ( r cat a ^ g ) where D f is the diffusivity of the fuel, C f is the concentration of the fuel, a ^ g is the surface to volume ratio and r cat is the catalytic reaction rate (including the catalyst loading). Fig. 6(a) shows that both methane and methanol conversion in the combustion channel are insensitive to the gap size. Methane combustion is strongly transport (transverse diffusion) controlled for gap sizes higher than twice the nominal one ( D a t > 10 ) . Methanol combustion is either strongly transport controlled or more transport than reaction controlled ( 1 < D a t < 10 ) , depending on the position in the reactor. The insensitivity of combustible conversion to the gap size, despite the significant transport effects, is due to the residence time ∫ 0 l reactor dz / u local being sufficiently long to achieve complete conversion. Fig. 6(b) shows the conversion of the reforming fuel vs. normalized combustion channel gap size. Like above, methane conversion is not sensitive to the gap size variation. Due to the high catalyst loading, the effective rate of the reforming process is determined by both transport and reaction ( D a t ∼ 0.1 - 0.6 ) . However, the residence time is always quite longer than the reaction time scale (data not shown). Methanol conversion in the reforming channel is slightly more sensitive to the combustion channel gap size for d 1 / d 1 o ≥ 4 and higher inlet velocities (6m/s). Nevertheless, it still remains close to completion. For the velocity range studied, methanol reforming is either strongly reaction controlled ( D a t < 0.1 ) or more reaction than transport controlled ( 0.1 < D a t < 1 ) . At high velocities, the residence time becomes comparable or shorter than the reaction time scale resulting in breakthrough. For example, the residence time of the methanol stream for d 1 / d 1 o = 6 and an inlet velocity of 6m/s (rightmost filled diamond) is ∼2ms vs. ∼8ms that is the maximum reaction time scale in the reactor. In design, one should ensure sufficiently long residence times for the faster flow rates. Fig. 6(c) shows that the maximum wall temperature of the methane combustion–reforming system does not change with increasing gap size. In Fig. 3(a) (nominal gap sizes), it was shown that the two reaction zones overlap well at a combustible velocity of 3m/s. As the gap size increases, the combustion zone becomes wider due to slower transverse diffusion and this widens the reforming zone too. However, the two zones overlap well at high velocities as well and, as a result, the peak temperature just moves downstream without changing significantly (only by a few degrees). On the other hand, the methanol combustion and reforming zones are not well matched (narrow combustion zone vs. reactor-wide reforming zone; Fig. 2(a) at nominal gap sizes). In this case, the wider combustion zone when increasing the gap size (due to diffusion limitations) improves the degree of overlap with the reforming zone and the maximum temperature decreases, even though the reforming fuel conversion might drop at high velocities and gap sizes (e.g., rightmost filled diamond in Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 7 is the counter part of Fig. 6 for varying the reforming channel gap size. The reforming stream flow rate is kept constant (and thus, u 2 inlet · d 2 = constant ) at that of the breakthrough limit for the nominal gap size ( d 2 o = 0.02 cm ) and an inlet combustion velocity of 3m/s (open symbols) or 6m/s (filled symbols). Fig. 7(a) shows that complete combustible (methane or methanol) conversion is obtained for all reforming gap sizes. Examination of the reaction zones has shown that the combustion zone moves upstream only slightly with increasing reforming gap (the heat sink near the entrance decreases) and in all cases combustion is complete within ∼1cm from the entrance (not shown). Fig. 7(b) shows that practically complete (>98%) (near equilibrium) methane conversion in the reforming channel is achieved for all gap sizes. For d 2 = d 2 o , 0.1 < D a t < 1 , whereas for higher gap sizes (e.g., d 2 / d 2 o ≥ 4 ), methane reforming becomes more diffusion controlled ( 1 < D a t < 10 ) or strongly diffusion controlled ( D a t > 10 ) , depending on the position in the reaction zone. However, even for the highest gap and inlet velocity studied ( d 2 / d 2 o = 6 , 6m/s), the maximum diffusion time scale (∼7ms) is a lot smaller than the residence time (∼32ms). Consequently, for all gaps studied, the equilibrium methane conversion in the reforming channel is attained within the first third of the reactor length. Methanol conversion in the reforming channel drops almost linearly with increasing gap size due to residence time limitations. The analysis above on diffusion vs. reaction control for methane, based on D a t , qualitatively holds for methanol too, although diffusion limitations appear more dominant. For d 2 / d 2 o = 6 and an inlet velocity of 6m/s (rightmost filled diamond point), methanol reforming along the reactor is partly in the diffusion controlled regime ( D a t > 10 ) and partly in the diffusion-reaction controlled regime ( 1 < D a t < 10 ) . The maximum computed diffusion time scale is comparable to the residence time (∼16ms vs. ∼13.5ms, respectively) and breakthrough is observed. Fig. 7(c) shows that the maximum wall temperature of the methane reforming–combustion system does not practically change with the gap size because both processes are completed fast in the front part of the reactor and the reaction zones overlap well. In contrast, the methanol combustion and reforming zones are not well matched for the chosen nominal gap sizes and catalyst loadings (see Fig. 2(a) at nominal gap sizes). When increasing the reforming gap size, diffusion limitations push the reforming zone downstream thus lowering the degree of overlap even more (i.e., the amount of methanol converted within the combustion zone decreases). This reaction zone segregation, compounded by the decrease in the reforming fuel conversion (Fig. 7(b)) (as a secondary effect), result in higher maximum wall temperatures. This effect is opposite from that observed when increasing the combustion channel gap size in Fig. 6(c). In summary, low temperature (methanol) reforming is more sensitive to the reforming and combustion channel gap sizes due to residence time limitations. Nonetheless, both low and high temperature reforming can be operated at very high conversions, over a range of microscale gap sizes provided that the catalyst loadings in the two channels, the operating velocities as well as the reactor length are chosen such that the local time scales of the effective rate of fuel consumption (determined by transverse diffusion, reaction or both) are sufficiently lower than the residence time."
12,Power and thermal efficiencies,"Fig. 8 (a) presents the power efficiency (PE) of the two systems at the breakthrough limit. This is defined as the power output calculated based on the LHV of hydrogen vs. the power input based on the LHV of the reforming and combustion fuels, all computed at 300K (9) PE = Q ˙ H 2 · LH V H 2 Q ˙ fuel , ref . · LH V fuel , ref . + Q ˙ fuel , comb . · LH V fuel , comb . Q ˙ : molar flow rate PE is >90% for methanol reforming and ∼60% for methane reforming and remains fairly constant when varying flow rates along the breakthrough line. Eq. (9) does not take into account the heat required to vaporize: (a) the fuel (methanol) in the endothermic and exothermic streams and (b) the water in the endothermic stream. Considering the heats of vaporization of water and methanol and the operating conditions along the breakthrough line, we find that the heat required to vaporize the reactants in the system amounts to ∼15% and 5% of the denominator value in Eq. (9) for methanol and methane, respectively; the difference is due to the higher methanol reforming stream flow rates at breakthrough. Given the values above, the higher heat duty required to vaporize the reactants in methanol systems does not change the picture of much higher PEs obtained with this fuel. The higher PE for methanol is mainly due to its high CO2:CO ratio (herein taken to be infinity); in contrast, in methane reforming at high temperatures, equilibrium reduces the contribution of WGS and CO dominates over CO2. Fig. 8(b) compares the thermal efficiencies (TE), defined as the amount of heat converted to chemical energy in the reforming channel vs. the heat release due to combustion in the adjacent channel. (10) TE = ( H prod . ( T inlet ) - H reac . ( T inlet ) ) ref . | ( H prod . ( T inlet ) - H reac . ( T inlet ) ) | comb . H : mixture enthalpy of formation The subscripts “prod.” and “reac.” refer to products and reactants, respectively, and “comb.” and “ref.” to the combustion and reforming channels, respectively. Eq. (9) can also be regarded (and has been used in the literature, e.g. (Holladay et al., 2004a)) as thermal efficiency under the generic convention that it represents the ratio of “what we get” (numerator in Eq. (9)) over “what we pay for” (denominator in Eq. (9)). Eq. (9) alone is not a convenient metric to assess the effect of heat loss (through the solid walls and the exiting streams) on the efficiency, because heat loss is naturally perceived as a fraction of the heat source (heat release due to combustion) only; the latter can be a small or a large contribution to the denominator of Eq. (9). To shed light to this nuance and understand the role of heat losses, which is key in developing an efficient heat recuperation strategy, we adopt herein the two conventions of PE and TE in Eqs. (9) and (10), respectively, whose relation is discussed later. Fig. 8(b) shows that TE is higher for low temperature reforming (methanol) with the differences being more pronounced at low velocities at which the outlet temperatures are lower. These findings hold for all conductivity materials (not shown). At high velocities, the TEs become comparable although the outlet temperatures (common in both channels) are still considerably lower in methanol reforming and the heat input from the combustion channel is the same in both cases (at equal combustible mixture velocities and the selected equivalence ratios, Table 1). This is due to the considerably higher methanol mixture flow rates (as opposed to methane) at breakthrough, which result in increased excess enthalpy of the reformate. Interestingly, despite the comparable TEs, the methanol PE is ∼30% higher at 6m/s (∼91% vs. ∼60%, Fig. 8(a)). To understand this, it is useful to derive an expression for PE as a function of TE. To this end, TE, which is defined in Eq. (10), is approximated as (11) TE = Q ˙ fuel , ref . · x ref . · Δ H ref . ( 300 K ) Q ˙ fuel , comb . · x comb . · LH V fuel , comb . ( 300 K ) In Eq. (11), the WGS reaction in methane reforming is neglected (along the (solid) breakthrough line (Figs. 4 and 8), the contribution of WGS to hydrogen production is ∼7%). The power output in terms of hydrogen can be written as (12) P W = Q ˙ H 2 · LH V H 2 = ( ν H 2 / ν fuel , ref . ) · x ref . · Q ˙ fuel , ref . · LH V H 2 where ν H 2 / ν fuel , ref . is the ratio of the stoichiometric coefficient of hydrogen to that of the reforming fuel in the reforming reaction. Substitution of Eqs. (11) and (12) into Eq. (9) yields (13) PE = ( ν H 2 / ν fuel , ref . ) · x ref . · Q ˙ fuel , ref . · LH V H 2 Q ˙ fuel , ref . · LH V fuel , ref . + Q ˙ fuel , ref . · x ref . · Δ H ref . TE · x comb . which can be simplified to (14) PE = 3 · TE · LH V H 2 TE · LH V fuel , ref . + Δ H ref . when complete conversion in both streams is assumed. The value of 3 in the numerator is the ratio of the stoichiometric coefficient of hydrogen to that of methane or methanol in the reforming reaction. Eq. (13) is a general equation applicable to any fuel. Eq. (14) is plotted in Fig. 9 for methane and methanol. The line for ammonia, which is another possible reforming fuel, is also provided for comparison. The line labeled methane* represents the theoretical limit, where all CO formed is converted to CO2 via the WGS reaction. This limit, which will be discussed last, is expressed in the following overall chemical reaction, which is a linear combination of the SR and WGS overall reactions (note that ν H 2 / ν fuel , ref . is 4 here): (15) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O = CO 2 + 4 H 2 Fig. 9 shows that PE increases with increasing TE up to a theoretical maximum. This implies that the higher the TE, the less important the effect of heat losses on PE, which explains the decreasing slope of all lines in Fig. 9 as TE increases. The PE theoretical maximum is 100% for methanol (and ammonia) and ∼72% for methane (both at TE=100%) because the LHV of carbon monoxide (product) is not accounted for. This partially explains the significant differences in PEs of methanol and methane shown in Fig. 8(a). Furthermore, methanol is less sensitive to TE than methane. Examination of the derivative of power efficiency with respect to TE (dPE/dTE based on Eq. (14)) shows that the PE drop with decreasing TE is always lower in the case of methanol for TEs>20% (not shown). For example, when TE drops from 100% to 40% then, the methanol PE drops ∼9 percentile units as compared to ∼17 percentile units for methane (Fig. 9). The comparison between methane and methanol so far concerns the efficiencies obtained from the reforming reactors. As already discussed, in high temperature methane reforming, the contribution of the equilibrated WGS to H2 production is limited, whereas in low temperature methanol reforming, the WGS equilibrium is shifted to the products side and most of CO is converted to CO2. The dashed-dotted line, methane*, conceptually represents the efficiency from an integral unit combining a SR reactor followed by a WGS reactor, where all CO is converted to CO2. Use of Eq. (15) ( Δ H = 165 kJ / mol vs. Δ H C H 4 , ref . = 206 kJ / mol ) implies thermal integration of the SR and the WGS reactors so that the heat release by the exothermic WGS is absorbed somehow by the endothermic SR (note that the methane SR operates at a much higher temperature than the WGS reactors). Fig. 9 shows that the maximum PE in this case is 100%, as expected, in the absence of heat losses. However, the methane* system is clearly more sensitive to heat losses than methanol for TEs>10% (dashed-dotted line lower than the dotted line). It is also noted that, in reality, keeping the thermal efficiency of an integrated methane SR/WGS system as high as that of methanol will be challenging due to the temperatures of the two processes (SR and WGS) being different. This entails that the thermal integration should be done in such a way so that the heat sucked from the reforming products, in order to reach the WGS reactor temperature should be recycled back into the reactants and not lost to the surroundings. All in all, low temperature reforming favors higher PEs due to: (1) low or negligible carbon monoxide formation; (2) higher thermal efficiencies (under present conditions, Fig. 8(b)); and (3) the lower sensitivity to TE drop. In general, TE can be increased: (1) by decreasing the reforming mixture throughput at constant conversion (under non-equilibrium conditions) due to the lower operating temperature (see Fig. 8(b)-open symbols); (2) by decreasing the excess steam in the feed; and (3) by decreasing the heat losses through solid boundaries and the excess enthalpy in the products (insulation effect and a heat recuperation/regeneration strategy). In practical terms, this analysis indicates that even a small gain in TE in stand-alone microdevices via improved heat recuperation will result in significantly higher PE. More specifically, according to Holladay et al. (2004a), an optimized microscale methanol processor (combined combustor–reformer–heat exchanger–vaporizer) for sub-watt power generation was operated with PE (therein called thermal efficiency) of maximum 33% at nearly complete methanol conversion due to significant heat losses to ambient. This value is in the low efficiency branch of the methanol line in Fig. 9, where PE increases sharply with increasing TE. Therefore, improving heat recuperation is highly desirable. On the other hand, large microreactor stacks of a few hundreds of microchannels (targeting power production in the order of a few tens of kW) can be nearly adiabatic. Then, thermal efficiencies of higher than 40%, as those reported in this work, are feasible. Under, these conditions (moderate and high efficiency branch) a heat recuperation strategy may not be as beneficial, as the PE is less sensitive to TE (Fig. 9). For example (conversing the argument made a few lines above): an increase in TE by 60 percentile units (from 40% to 100%) results in a PE increase of only ∼9 percentile units."
13,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production from a multifunctional microdevice consisting of thermally coupled catalytic plate combustion and reforming microreactors was simulated for methane and methanol reforming, as representatives of a high and a low temperature process, respectively. Both systems could operate at very short contact times (as low as a few milliseconds) over a wide range of combustible and reforming mixture inlet velocities. The breakthrough line is a good operating line for all reforming fuels. Variable power output, in the order of tens or even hundreds of Watts (from a single microreformer), is feasible by simply tuning the flow rates. For hydrogen production for portable devices, methanol has the advantage of producing mainly CO2, avoiding the need for WGS reactors. Furthermore, it has ∼465 times higher volumetric energy density compared to methane (∼16.75 vs. 0.036kJ/cm3, respectively), due to being a liquid. At the same time, its mass based hydrogen density is just half that of methane (0.125 vs. 0.25g H2/g of fuel, respectively). Methanol reforming is expected to yield higher power output compared to methane (at equal heat input) due to the considerably lower heat of reaction (note that ν H 2 / ν fuel , ref . is the same for both fuels). Indeed, when operating the microdevice along the breakthrough line, more than four times methanol moles are converted (compared to methane). Interestingly, the low temperature operation of methanol along the breakthrough line does not significantly decrease the fraction of heat that leaves the system in product excess enthalpy, despite the outlet temperature being significantly lower in the methanol than in the methane case. This is due to the considerably higher methanol stream flow rates at breakthrough, which result in increased excess enthalpy of the reformate. On the other hand, more than 90% power efficiency is attainable with methanol vs. only 60% for methane (under the studied conditions) due to the significant fraction of CO that is not shifted to CO2 at methane operating temperatures. Low conductivity materials are detrimental in terms of hot spot formation and axial wall temperature gradients both for low and high temperature reforming. However, good reaction zone overlap, via matching the combustion and reforming process time scales, can alleviate this problem. This can be achieved through proper selection of catalyst loadings and gap sizes. A general strategy for this will be presented in a forthcoming publication."
