0,Introduction,"Syngas is an important intermediate for manufacturing clean hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. Syngas can be obtained from natural gas via steam reforming or partial oxidation or from coal and biomass via gasification. Depending on the catalyst and operating conditions, carbon monoxide hydrogenation can result in a wide range of products: methane, long-chain hydrocarbons, light olefins, methanol or higher alcohols. Previous reports suggest that bimetallic mixed copper cobalt catalysts might have structure and catalytic performance very different from cobalt and copper monometallic counterparts. The structure and properties of coprecipitated Co–Cu-based catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis have been described in a large number of patents and papers [1–5]. Insufficient stability and difficult reproducibility are major difficulties which hinder utilization of copper–cobalt catalysts prepared via co-precipitation at larger industrial scale [6]. Our recent work [7] has addressed the structure of alumina supported copper–cobalt catalysts prepared via impregnation and their catalytic performance in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Formation of copper–cobalt mixed phases in both oxidized and reduced states was identified in these catalysts by a combination of characterization techniques. The reaction rate and selectivity were strongly modified after addition of even small amounts of copper to cobalt catalysts. Copper–cobalt bimetallic particles seem to be involved in alcohol synthesis over these catalysts. Despite varying the Cu/Co ratio in a wide range, the selectivity to higher alcohols on supported copper–cobalt bimetallic particles was, however, rather limited. Catalytic support is an important parameter for the design of efficient catalysts. The choice of support for carbon monoxide hydrogenation catalysts is dictated by several considerations including dispersion effects, electronic modification and metal support interaction [8]. The support texture and surface acidity have significant influence on main active metal dispersion, reducibility, catalytic performance as well as on the interaction between metal and support. As reported by Reuel and Bartholomew [9], with 10wt.% Co supported catalysts, an increase in specific activity in carbon monoxide hydrogenation depends on the nature of the support in the following order: MgO<Carbon<SiO2 <Al2O3 <TiO2. The strength of metal–support interaction increases in the order SiO2 <Al2O3 <TiO2. Ideally, optimal catalysts should be prepared by achieving high dispersion of highly reducible metal species at metal loadings as high as possible. For Al2O3 and particularly TiO2 supports, the strong metal–support interaction leads to high dispersions [10,11], but also favors the formation of non-reducible aluminates and titanates, respectively, resulting in a low density of reduced metal surface sites. In the case of SiO2, a weaker interaction of metal with the support favors the reducibility of metal oxides but at the same time promotes agglomeration of metal particles during the thermal activation (calcination–reduction) treatments leading to a low dispersion. In addition, catalyst support can be directly involved in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Recently, Davis et al. [12,13] have suggested a pathway for the formation of alcohols on cobalt catalysts, in which chain growth proceeds on cobalt sites, while chain termination occurs at the metal-oxide junction and involves bridging OH groups on partially reduced ceria. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted increasing attention as novel catalyst supports due to their well-defined structure in terms of inner hollow cavities, graphene layers with semiconducting or metallic characteristics, and a tubular morphology [14]. Theoretical studies reveal that deviation of the graphene layers from planarity causes the electron density to shift from the concave inner to the convex outer surface [15–17], leading to an electron-deficient interior surface and electron-enriched exterior surface. This should influence the structure and electronic properties of substances in contact with either surface. This effect is envisioned with potentials for CNT applications in many fields such as magnetic materials, gas sensors, field emission and catalytic materials. Several successful applications were reported [18–21]. Various promoters such as alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals (Li, Na, K, Mg, etc.) [22], transition metal oxides (ZrO2, MnO, FeOx, etc.) [23,24] and rare metal oxides (La2O3 and CeO2) [25–27] have been used in order to obtain higher reaction rate, higher C2+ alcohols yields and lower selectivity to methane and other light hydrocarbons. Numerous studies have shown that introduction of a promoting metal may have a significant impact on the structure and dispersion of active species, reaction rate and products selectivity. The promoting metal is typically introduced via co-impregnation or subsequent impregnation. Introduction of efficient promoting metals could result in the following phenomena [28]: an easier reduction of metal oxide particles, formation of bimetallic particles and alloys, a lower fraction of barely reducible mixed oxides, enhancement of metal dispersion, inhibition of catalyst deactivation, appearance of additional sites of hydrogen activation, and an increase in the intrinsic reactivity of surface sites. Iron is a well-known catalyst for carbon monoxide hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. Differently to cobalt catalysts, it promotes hydrocarbon chain growth under a wide range of operating conditions (temperature, H2, and CO pressures) [28]. It could be expected that its introduction to copper cobalt catalysts would enhance selectivity to higher alcohols. Addition of oxide promoters could also modify the catalyst texture and porosity, reduce formation of hardly reducible cobalt mixed oxides, increase cobalt dispersion, reducibility and fraction of different metal crystalline phases, enhance mechanical and attrition resistance of cobalt copper catalyst, and improve the chemical stability of the support [28]. Zirconium oxide has been proposed as a promoter for cobalt catalysts supported on several oxide supports in several papers and patents. Zirconia could affect both reaction rate and selectivity to the desired products. This could be due to the formation of the highly reducible cobalt oxide species derived from the mild Co–ZrO2 interaction [24]. Several investigations on cobalt–rare earth oxide catalysts have been reported. Jiao et al. [29] reported improved activity and alcohol selectivity over 0.5wt.% La doped 15Co/AC sample. Alkali and alkali-earth cations are common promoters for carbon monoxide hydrogenation catalysts. Promotion of cobalt and copper catalysts with alkali and alkali-earth metals has been a subject of a number of publications [30]. The presence of these metals may affect both reaction rate and selectivity to ethanol and higher alcohols [31–34]. Potassium and magnesium are among the most efficient alkali and alkali-earth promoters. Previously it was also shown [35–39] that addition of alkali metals to Cu/ZnO methanol synthesis catalyst greatly increased the selectivity for higher alcohols. Sheffer and King [35] suggested that potassium promoted copper catalysts by stabilizing the Cu+ species, which provided active sites for methanol synthesis. Iron Fischer–Tropsch catalysts usually convert syngas with relatively low H2/CO ratio [40]. Promotion of iron catalysts with alkali and alkali-earth ions is an efficient method to control the rate of Fischer–Tropsch and water–gas shift reactions [41,42] and thus, the reaction selectivity and hydrocarbon productivity [43,44]. Alkali promoter can increase the CO dissociative adsorption rate [45,46], resulting in an increase in the surface coverage of dissociated CO and thus lead to higher olefin selectivities. Addition of alkali and alkali-earth ions to cobalt catalysts usually results in a more difficult reducibility of cobalt oxide, lower FT reaction rates [44,47]. Alkali and alkali-earth promoters also reduce the fraction of mixed oxide such as cobalt aluminate [48]. CH4 selectivity decreases, however, while CO2 and C5+ hydrocarbon selectivities increase with higher alkali ions contents [47]. This paper focuses on the effect of support and promotion with different elements (K, Mg, Zr, and Fe) on the structure and catalytic performance of copper cobalt catalysts in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. The characterization results are discussed alongside with the catalytic data obtained using a laboratory fixed bed reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The supported Cu–Co catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness co-impregnation of γ-Al2O3 (Puralox SCCA 5/170 from Sasol, Germany), SiO2 (Fuji silysia, Q-10), and o-CNT (Chengdu Limited Company of Organic Chemistry in China) using aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate and copper nitrate. The carbon nanotubes were purified by 65% HNO3 at 393K for 14h. Co–Cu catalysts promoted with K, Mg, Zr, Fe were prepared by incipient wetness co-impregnation of γ-Al2O3 using aqueous solution of either potassium nitrate or magnesium nitrate, zirconium nitrate, iron nitrate together with cobalt nitrate and copper nitrate. Co-impregnation was used instead of sequential impregnation, because it might provide better metal dispersion and higher alcohol yields [49]. The catalysts ware labeled as xMyCuzCo/support, where x, y and z stand for promoter metal, copper and cobalt weight contents in the catalysts. In addition to the catalysts prepared via impregnation, the 10Cu10CoAlO x catalyst was prepared via coprecipitation using aqueous mixture solution containing cobalt, copper and aluminum nitrate. The precipitation was performed with diluted ammonia solution. The procedure was inspired from previous reports [1–5]. The precipitate was washed with deionized water for several times until the wash solution reacted a neutral pH; the precipitate was then aged at room temperature for 24h. All the catalysts were dried at room temperature for at least 4h and then calcined in air (160mL/min) at 373K for 2h and at 623K for 5h (heating rate of 1Kmin−1)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 N2 adsorption The surface areas of the catalysts were measured by a standard BET procedure using N2 adsorption at 77K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. Prior to the adsorption measurements, the samples were outgassed for 5h at 423K. N2 isotherms were obtained in both adsorption and desorption modes. The surface areas of supports and catalysts were determined by the BET method. The total pore volume (TPV) was calculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure (p/p 0) close to unity, where p and p 0 are the measured and equilibrium pressures, respectively. Pore size distribution curves were established from the desorption branches of the isotherms using the BJH model [50]. 2.2.2 XRD characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation. The average sizes of cobalt and copper oxide crystallites were calculated using the Co3O4 or CuCo2O4 (311) diffraction peaks at 2θ =36.96° and the CuO (111) diffraction peak at 2θ =35.5°, respectively according to the Scherrer equation [51]. The in situ XRD patterns were measured during catalyst reduction in hydrogen (3%H2 in Ar). The experiments were conducted by passing pure H2 through the catalyst while increasing the temperature at a linear rate. The evolution of crystalline phases of samples was monitored in situ by Siemens D5000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation during the reduction. After reduction, XRD was also carried out at room temperature. 2.2.3 NH3–TPD characterization NH3–temperature-program-desorption (NH3–TPD) were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChemII 2920 instrument connected to a ThermoStar GSD301 T2 mass spectrometer. Typically, the sample (0.2g) was first pretreated in a quartz reactor with a He gas flow at 623K for 60min, followed by purging with high-purity He, the adsorption of NH3 was performed in the mixture (10vol.% NH3 in He) at 373K for 60min, and the remaining or weakly adsorbed NH3 was purged by high-purity He. TPD was performed in helium flow by raising the temperature to 973K at a rate of 10K/min. The desorbed molecules were detected with the Mass Spectrometer by monitoring the signal with m/e =17(NH3). 2.2.4 H2–TPR characterization The reducibility of the catalysts was studied by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The TPR was carried out by AutoChem II 2920 apparatus from Micromeritics using 0.05g of the sample in 5vol.% H2/Ar stream (50cm3 min−1). The temperature was increased from room temperature to 1173K at a rate of 3Kmin−1. 2.2.5 XPS characterization Surface analyses were performed using a VG ESCALAB 220XL X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) equipped with MgKα (1253.6eV) non-monochromatized source which was used for excitation with a 300W-applied power. The analyzer was operated in a constant pass energy mode (E pass =40eV). Binding energies were referenced to the Al2p core level (74.6eV) of the support. The vacuum level during experiments was better than 10−7 Pa. The powdered catalyst was pressed as a thin pellet onto a steel block. The reproducibility was −0.2eV for the Co2p binding energy. 2.2.6 TEM characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a TECNA microscope operating at a voltage of 200kV. The sample powder was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and deposited on a copper grid prior to the measurements. 2.2.7 In situ magnetic measurements The in situ magnetic measurements were performed using a Foner vibrating-sample magnetometer [52,53]. The magnetometer is fitted with a continuous flow quartz microreactor equipped with a built-in Pt–PtRh thermocouple. The experiments were conducted by passing pure H2 through the catalyst while increasing the temperature from 293 to 773K at a rate of 5Kmin−1; then it was kept constant at 773K. The sample amount for all measurements was around 20mg. The appearance of ferromagnetic species in the samples was monitored in situ by a continuous increase in magnetization during the reduction."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction Carbon monoxide hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a fixed bed stainless steel tubular microreactor (d int. =13.1mm). The average catalyst grain diameter was 100μm. The values of the Weisz modulus (<10−3) indicate the absence of intraparticle mass transfer limitations [7]. The thermocouple was put inside the reactor in direct contact with the catalyst, so that the thermocouple measurement could reflect the temperature of the catalyst bed. No temperature spike or temperature swings were observed during steady state reactor operation. The samples were reduced in hydrogen flow (50cm3 min−1) at 673K for 5h. Then, the reactor was cooled to 453K. After purging with Ar flow for 1h, the premixed syngas with a molar ratio of H2/CO=2 was gradually introduced to the catalyst. Carbon monoxide contained 5% of nitrogen, which was used as an internal standard for calculating carbon monoxide conversion. The pressure was gradually raised to 20bar. Then, the temperature was slowly increased to 523K. The gaseous products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. Analysis of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 was performed using a packed CTR-1 column and a thermal conductivity detector. Gaseous hydrocarbons (C1–C7) were separated in a capillary Poraplot Q column and analyzed by a flame-ionization detector. The liquid products were collected in the trap (kept at 283K) and analyzed offline by gas-chromatography. The reaction was conducted for at least 48h to avoid the interference of initial transient effects on catalytic performance. Catalyst deactivation was negligible during the catalytic tests."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of the support on the structure of cobalt–copper catalysts,"3.1 Effect of the support on the structure of cobalt–copper catalysts 3.1.1 Catalyst texture The information about the texture of copper–cobalt catalysts is shown in Table 1 . The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of SiO2, Al2O3, carbon nanotubes supported and coprecipitated copper–cobalt catalysts shown in Fig. 1 a. Cu–Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the type (I+II) isotherms [56] with a regular type-H (I) hysteresis loop at relative pressures (p/p 0) of 0.6–0.9 due to the N2 capillary condensation in cylindrical channels [54,55]. SiO2 and CNT supported Cu–Co-based catalysts show the same type of N2-sorption isotherms with a higher type-H (I) hysteresis loop at relative pressures (p/p 0) of 0.7–1.0 but a wider interval between two closed points. It implies that these samples have more regular cylindrical channels and larger pore size (13.5 and 14.8nm respectively). 10Cu10CoAlO x catalyst prepared via coprecipitation exhibited the type (I) isotherms with a regular type-H (II) hysteresis loop [56] at relative pressures (p/p 0) of 0.4–0.8. Such wide hysteresis loops were characteristic of the percolation effect which could be explained by the formation of the “ink-bottle” type pores in these samples [57]. The BET surface area and pore volume of 10Cu10CoAlO x catalyst prepared via coprecipitation determined by the BJH method were 134.0m2 g−1 and 0.29cm3 g−1, respectively (Table 1). The pore size distribution evaluated from the desorption branch by the BJH method showed a maximum at 3.7nm (Fig. 1b) and the calculation gave an average pore diameter of 4.0nm. By contrast, the surface area and pore volume of 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using co-impregnation have similar surface area (117.0m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.31cm3 g−1) while the larger pore sized (average pore diameter=8.0nm) (Table 1) 10Cu10Co/SiO2 and 10Cu10Co/CNT catalysts possess surface area of 211–233m2 g−1 (Table 1), larger pores volume and larger pore size. As shown in Table 1, the diameters of metal species are consistent with the pore size in supported catalysts. Thus, for support comparison, the supports in this work were chosen so that their BET surface areas were in the range of 120 and 230m2 g−1. 3.1.2 XRD characterization The XRD patterns (Fig. 2 ) of 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalyst suggest the presence of Al2O3, Co3O4 and possibly CuCo2O4. Interestingly, no distinct XRD CuO peaks were observed even at relatively high copper content (10wt.%). Previous work [7] showed formation of mixed copper–cobalt oxide species in calcined alumina supported copper–cobalt catalysts. XRD patterns of 10Cu10Co/SiO2 show the presence of both Co3O4 (10.7nm) and CuO (34.9nm). Calcined 10Cu10Co/CNT displays CuO and CoO XRD characteristic peaks (Fig. 2). Formation of distinct copper and cobalt phases indicates a weaker interaction between copper and cobalt in these two samples. In addition, carbon nanotubes seem to stabilize the CoO phase, which is usually unstable under ambient conditions. Note that stabilization of CoO in CNT is not a particle size effect. Indeed, cobalt oxide species form relatively larger particles in carbon nanotubes (17.7nm). The most stable cobalt oxide phase for larger cobalt particles under ambient conditions is Co3O4 and not CoO. The XRD patterns of calcined 10Cu10CoAlO x catalyst prepared via coprecipitation (Fig. 2) display several peaks which could be attributed to the CoAl2O4, CuAl2O4 or CuCo2O4 spinels. Because of similar cubic framework and almost identical unit cell parameters (a Co3O4 =8.177 [58], a CuAl2O4 =8.123Å and a CuCo2O4 =8.122Å [59]), they are difficult to separate using XRD. No Al2O3 peaks were observed in 10Cu10CoAlO x catalyst prepared by coprecipitation. 3.1.3 TEM images The EFTEM and TEM photographs of 10Cu10Co/CNT and 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . Comparison of the results obtained for alumina and carbon nanotubes supported catalysts suggests more uniform repartition of metal phases in alumina than in carbon nanotubes (Fig. 3b). In carbon nanotubes supported CuCo catalyst, larger cobalt oxide particles, probably CoO (d >20nm) were detected, while CuO forms smaller particles. The large size of cobalt oxide crystallites is consistent with XRD data (Table 1). The distance between the two adjacent planes, d, was in CuO 0.25nm respectively, far smaller than the spacing of 111 planes in Co3O4 and CuCo2O4 (0.47nm). The energy-filtered TEM micrographs (Fig. 3) of 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalyst indicate uniform chemical distribution of cobalt and copper. It appears that Cu particles are situated on the surface of Co particles. Unfortunately, because of similar crystalline structure Co3O4 and mixed CuCo2O4 spinels cannot be clearly identified and distinguished from each other from interplanar spacing. This also confirms that Co3O4 and CuCo mixed spinels could be major cobalt phases in the calcined alumina supported catalysts. The presence of small CuO particles with larger copper oxide crystallites simultaneously in this catalyst was identified by d(111) spacing of 0.25nm [60,61]. The catalytic performance data for copper–cobalt catalysts supported on alumina, silica and CNT are discussed in Section 3.3. Alumina supported copper cobalt catalysts were selected for further investigation of promotion effects from the catalyst structural differences on catalytic performance, because they exhibited higher metal dispersion (Table 1) and more noticeable interaction between copper and cobalt. Previous report [7] suggests formation of copper–cobalt mixed oxides in the calcined alumina supported samples and copper–cobalt bimetallic particles in the reduced state."
7,Promoted alumina supported Cu–Co catalysts,"3.2 Promoted alumina supported Cu–Co catalysts 3.2.1 XRD characterization The XRD patterns of unpromoted and promoted Cu–Co catalysts (Fig. 4 ) display characteristic peaks which might be ascribed to Co3O4, CuCo2O4 and Al2O3. The particle sizes of the cobalt oxide (or CoCu mixed oxide) were calculated using the diffraction peak at 2θ =36.8° according to the Scherrer equation [51]. The cobalt oxides particle size in 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalyst was 9.6nm, and changes slightly after promotion with Mg, K, Zr or Fe (Table 2 ). Only a slight decrease in the oxide particle size was observed in the catalysts promoted with iron and zirconium, while, the oxide particles were larger in Mg and K-promoted catalysts. This suggests that addition of a small amount of the promoting agents only marginally affects the nucleation and growth of cobalt and copper oxide phases. 3.2.2 NH3–TPD characterization of calcined catalysts We used NH3–TPD to study the acidity of the promoted copper cobalt catalysts (Fig. 5 ). The unpromoted Cu–Co catalysts exhibited two NH3 desorption peaks at 450K and 750K, respectively, to weak adsorption and strong adsorption of NH3 on the catalyst surface. Generally, the weak adsorption peak at low temperature region (450K) is due to weak acid sites or hydrogen bonding to the hydroxyl groups of the surface, while the strong adsorption peak at higher temperature region (750K) is due to strong acid sites. As depicted in Table 2, the integral areas of NH3–TPD peaks give information on the concentrations of acid sites in the catalysts. The acidity of Fe or Zr promoted Co–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts was found to be higher than that of catalysts promoted by K or Mg. The concentration of acid sites in Fe promoted catalysts is 1.16 times higher than that of unpromoted catalyst, while K promoted catalysts hold 0.76 times less. Promotion Cu–Co catalysts with Mg and Zr has less of an impact on NH3 desorption area. This indicates that the presence of alkaline metal decreases the acidity of Cu–Co catalyst while the transition metals, and especially Fe, enhance the acidic properties. 3.2.3 Reduction 3.2.3.1 TPR characterization Temperature programmed reduction was used to determine the reducibility of the promoted copper cobalt catalysts. The H2–TPR profiles of 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 (Fig. 6 ) display a broad reduction peak consisting of several overlapping peaks with maxima at 493K. Interestingly, TPR profiles of Cu–Co catalysts are much different from those observed for monometallic cobalt and copper catalysts, a strong interaction between copper and cobalt which could lead to formation of mixed oxides was considered in the bimetallic catalysts. It is reasonable to suppose that the H2–TPR profiles could be attributed to the reduction of both cobalt and copper oxide species and mixed oxides. When a small quantity of alkaline or alkaline-earth metals (e.g. Mg and K) is added to the copper–cobalt catalyst, the reduction maximum shifted towards higher temperatures similar to the results obtained previously for cobalt catalysts [47]. For K modified catalysts, the H2–TPR profiles show another distinct shoulder peak in the lower temperature region which is notably separated from main peaks. Note that TPR does not provide direct information about attribution of hydrogen consumption peaks to different copper and cobalt reduction steps. The assignment of TPR peaks is discussed further in the manuscript alongside with in situ characterization results obtained by XRD and magnetic method. Promotion with iron and zirconium enhances catalyst reduction because, as shown in Fig. 6, the first reduction peak in the TPR profiles of 1Fe10Cu10Co/Al2O3 and 1Zr10Cu10Co/Al2O3 shifts to lower temperature. The metal reduction degree calculated from the hydrogen consumption peak area in the temperature region from 373K to 673K for the promoted catalyst is shown in Table 2. It is more significant for the Fe-promoted catalyst than for the K-promoted counterpart. 3.2.3.2 In situ magnetic measurements The reduction of promoted copper cobalt catalysts was also investigated by using the in situ magnetic method. Note that, in contrast to the conventional TPR, the magnetic method provides information about the presence of ferromagnetic phases while reduction of metal oxides which does not result in formation of ferromagnetic phase might be undetectable by this technique. Fig. 7 shows the magnetization curves of unpromoted catalyst and Fe, K promoted Cu–Co counterparts. In agreement with TPR data shown in Fig. 6, slight changes on catalyst promotion suggest relatively small effects of promoter on the metal reducibility and formation of ferromagnetic metallic phases. Promotion of Cu–Co catalyst with iron results in a slight decrease in the temperature of the emergence of ferromagnetic phases. This observation is consistent with TPR measurements, which also indicate slightly easier catalyst reducibility in the presence of small amounts of iron. The magnetization curves of K–Cu–Co catalyst show a slight decrease in the concentration of the ferromagnetic phase, while TPR profiles show a higher temperature reduction peak with a shoulder. 3.2.3.3 In situ XRD characterization Reduction of metal oxides in the promoted copper–cobalt catalysts was also studied by in situ XRD. During the XRD experiments, catalyst reduction was performed in the in situ XRD cell in a flow of 3%H2/Ar under increasing temperature with 3K/min. The XRD patterns of calcined 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 (Fig. 8 a) display characteristic peaks ascribed to Co3O4 or CuCo2O4 and Al2O3. CuCo2O4 is a mixed oxide with spinel structure in which Cu2+ ions are located in a tetrahedral environment and Co3+ ions are in octahedral coordination [11]. These diffraction peaks are also observed by in situ XRD during hydrogen treatment at lower temperatures (<423K). After catalyst treatment in hydrogen at 473K the patterns show characteristic peaks of CoO which suggest partial reduction of Co3O4. Heating catalysts at higher temperatures results in the appearance of XRD peaks attributed to metallic species (>523K). These characteristic peaks are located at 43.8° and 50.9°. Note that these peaks are situated between metallic Cu (2θ[111]=43.3°, 2θ[200]=50.4°) [12] and Co (2θ[111]=45.9°, 2θ[200]=53.5° [13]) and could be possibly attributed to the formation of bimetallic cobalt and copper particles. For 1Fe10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 8b), the reduction proceeds similarly to the unpromoted catalyst. No iron characteristic peaks were detected due to the low concentration of Fe oxides in the sample. The characteristic peak of the metallic cobalt phase [111] was broader than that of unpromoted catalysts and shifts to 43.7° which also indicates smaller metal particle size – in other words, a higher metal dispersion in the catalysts promoted by iron and formation of copper–cobalt bimetallic particles. Smaller sizes of copper–cobalt bimetallic particles in the reduced Fe-promoted catalyst are in agreement with higher metal oxide dispersions in the calcined precursor measured by ex situ XRD compared to the unpromoted counterpart (Table 2). The in situ XRD and magnetic data allow a more accurate interpretation of TPR data (Fig. 6). Indeed, the shoulders at 450–500K seems to be attributed to the partial reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and CuO to Cu2O respectively, while the most intense peaks at 480–500K are like to be attributed to the formation of cobalt and copper metal phases. 3.2.3.4 XPS characterization Additional information about metal species in the promoted catalysts was obtained from XPS experiments. The XPS spectra of metal-modified CuCo samples after reduction (Fig. 9 ) show that the Co3O4 is reduced to metallic Co with different reduction degree depending on the promoting metals. XPS also suggests that copper is usually reduced completely in the bimetallic catalysts. The proportion of surface metallic cobalt in catalysts after in situ-reduction at 673K follows the order as Fe>Zr>Mg>K. This observation is consistent with the reduction extent calculated from the TPR results and estimated from the in situ magnetic measurements."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.3 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance data of the catalyst prepared by coprecipitation and impregnation are shown in Tables 3 and 4 . The catalytic performance was evaluated after 48h of the reaction after stabilization of catalytic activity. Light hydrocarbons and alcohols were the major reaction products, and only very low selectivity to CO2 was observed under the reaction conditions. 10Cu10CoAlO x catalyst prepared via coprecipitation exhibited lower carbon monoxide conversion activity and produced mostly hydrocarbons, and especially C5–7 hydrocarbons; methanol was the major carbon oxygenated product with small concentrations of higher alcohols. The carbon monoxide hydrogenation activity of the supported catalysts was much higher under the same reaction conditions. SiO2 supported Cu–Co catalyst showed higher selectivity to higher alcohols (ethanol and C3+ alcohols) than co-precipitated catalyst. CNT supported Cu–Co catalyst showed higher selectivity to methane and methanol. With the same carbon monoxide conversion, Al2O3 supported Co–Cu catalysts exhibited much higher alcohol selectivity than those supported on carbon nanotubes or silica (Table 3 ). On the other hand, major oxygenated products on 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 were ethanol and higher alcohols (Table 4). This is consistent with the suggestion regarding the role of bimetallic copper cobalt particles in these reactions. Copper cobalt particles were detected in these catalysts by EXAFS and in situ magnetic methods [7]. In other supports, the interaction between copper and cobalt was smaller; separate distinct copper oxide and cobalt oxide phases were clearly identified from XRD patterns. The results of CO hydrogenation over unpromoted and promoted Cu–Co catalysts are presented in Table 5 . Table 6 shows light hydrocarbons selectivity and detailed alcohol distributions under the same experimental conditions. The methane selectivity on CuCo catalysts under our test conditions was higher than 30%, with exception of the iron promoted catalyst, and no C7+ hydrocarbons were detected. Ethanol and methanol were major oxygenated products, while only small amounts of C3+ alcohols were found (Table 6). Note that K, Mg, Zr and Fe produced different effects on catalytic performance for Cu–Co/Al2O3. Promotion with small amounts of iron leads to nearly a three-fold increase in the alcohol yield, while the alcohol selectivity was risen to 18%, resulting in alcohol yield increase from 18.1 to 64.3 mg g cat - 1 h - 1 . On the other hand, the presence of iron results in higher production of CO2 formed from the water gas shift reaction which can be possibly catalyzed by iron species. The effect of zirconium on alcohols selectivity is less significant than that of iron on the reaction rate. K and Mg bring about a nearly negative effect on the catalytic activity and alcohol selectivity (Table 5)."
9,Influence of support and promotion on the structure and catalytic performance of copper cobalt catalysts in carbon monoxide hydrogenation,"3.4 Influence of support and promotion on the structure and catalytic performance of copper cobalt catalysts in carbon monoxide hydrogenation The characterization and catalytic studies show that the structure and catalytic performance of Cu–Co catalysts are strongly affected by the support and promoters. Calcined 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalysts contain Co3O4 with the presence of mixed CuCo2O4 crystallites. 10Cu10CoAlO x catalysts prepared by coprecipitation contained (in addition to cobalt–copper mixed oxides) barely reducible mixed CoAl2O4 and CuAl2O4 spinel. Distinct Co3O4 spinel and CuO crystallites were present in silica supported catalysts. CNT supported catalysts also showed the presence of copper and cobalt separate phases such as CoO and CuO. XRD showed the presence of larger (Table 1) cobalt oxide species in silica and CNT supported catalysts than in alumina supported counterparts. Less uniform copper–cobalt repartition was uncovered in the catalysts supported by carbon nanotubes than that of alumina supported Cu–Co catalyst. This suggests that the support can affect both metal dispersion and phase composition in copper–cobalt catalysts. Because of significant concentration of barely reducible cobalt and copper aluminates, the catalysts prepared by coprecipitation showed rather low activity in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. With the supported catalysts, the overall carbon monoxide activity was only slightly affected by the type of support (Table 3), while selectivity to higher alcohols was more significant with alumina supported catalysts. 10Cu10Co/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit higher selectivity to C2+ alcohols and lower selectivity to light hydrocarbons than the catalysts supported on other supports. In agreement with previous reports [7,62–64], formation of higher alcohols seems to involve bimetallic copper–cobalt particles. The bimetallic copper–cobalt particles seem to be enriched with copper atoms on the outer surface [7]. There a general consensus in the literature [63,64] that synthesis of higher alcohol requires a synergy between copper and cobalt sites. Both copper–cobalt metallic species provide sites for hydrogen dissociation. Carbon monoxide adsorbs on copper atoms in the molecular form, while carbon monoxide dissociation usually occurs on cobalt metal sites at the reaction temperatures. Cobalt sites are required for carbon monoxide dissociation, chain growth and hydrogenation, while copper atoms catalyze carbon monoxide insertion into the growing carbon chain which leads to the formation of higher alcohols. Because of the formation of hardly reducible aluminates, the co-precipitated catalyst showed lower activity in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. The Cu–Co catalysts supported on SiO2 and CNT exhibited similar carbon monoxide hydrogenation reaction rates but slightly lower selectivity to alcohols (Table 3). Methanol was the major alcohol product over 10Cu10Co/CNT catalyst. Heterogeneous repartition of copper and cobalt in carbon nanotubes seems to be not very favorable for the formation of mixed bimetallic species and leads to higher selectivity to methanol. In contrast to the results obtained by Davis et al. [12,13] for ceria promoted cobalt catalysts, we did not find any evidence showing that silica, alumina or carbon nanotube supports are directly involved in alcohols synthesis. Indeed, oxygen and hydroxyl species in ceria are much more reactive in the reducing atmosphere than in silica and alumina. No significant concentration of hydroxyl groups is expected in CNT supported catalysts after treatment with hydrogen at 673K for 5h in the presence of metallic cobalt species. In addition to support effects, catalyst promotion strongly affects catalytic performance in carbon monoxide hydrogenation and selectivity to higher alcohols. Characterization results suggest that iron addition enhances both cobalt reducibility and to some extent cobalt dispersion in the bimetallic Cu–Co catalysts. H2–TPR, XPS, in situ magnetic and in situ XRD measurements show a much easier reduction of cobalt in the presence of iron (Figs. 6–8, Table 2). Cobalt–copper bimetallic nanoparticles in the promoted catalysts were identified using in situ XRD. In addition, the iron-promoted catalyst can contain iron metallic species which could be involved in carbon monoxide hydrogenation, carbon monoxide insertion and hydrocarbon chain growth. The catalytic results on promotion of copper–cobalt catalysts are consistent with previous data on iron promotion on the activity of CuMnZnO and CuMnZr catalyst [65–67] prepared by coprecipitation. The results obtained in this work showed nearly a three-fold increase in CO conversion rate after promotion of copper cobalt alumina supported catalysts with a small amount of iron. These observations suggest that carbon monoxide hydrogenation over Fe–Cu–Co catalysts proceeds on Cu–Co bimetallic particles which could be possibly enriched with iron atoms. Promotion with K and Mg seems to be inhibiting on carbon monoxide hydrogenation rate and alcohols yield, while promotion with Zr slightly increases alcohol productivity. This is in agreement with lower FT reaction rate observed previously [47] on alkali promoted cobalt catalysts. In addition, it seems that some catalyst acidity could favor to some extent alcohol productivity during carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Higher alcohol selectivity was observed on Fe and Zr promoted catalysts, while addition of basic cations (K and Mg) reduces alcohol selectivity over alumina supported copper–cobalt catalysts."
10,Conclusion,"Catalytic supports and promotion with K, Mg, Zr and Fe affect the structure and catalytic performance of copper–cobalt catalysts for carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Comparison of the supports suggests that highly dispersed mixed copper cobalt bimetallic species can be obtained in alumina supported catalysts. The presence of bimetallic particles in alumina supported catalysts leads to higher selectivity to C2+ alcohols compared to other catalytic supports. Preparation of bimetallic copper cobalt catalysts by coprecipitation leads to the formation of barely reducible metal aluminates and a lower catalytic activity in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Promotion with small amounts of iron has an important positive effect on the catalytic performance. Iron enhances to some extent metal dispersion and improves catalyst reducibility with possible formation of additional active sites for carbon monoxide hydrogenation, chain growth and carbon monoxide insertion. The catalytic results have shown a dramatic increase in carbon monoxide hydrogenation rate and a three-fold increase in ethanol productivity after addition of even small amounts of iron to the supported Cu–Co catalysts."
