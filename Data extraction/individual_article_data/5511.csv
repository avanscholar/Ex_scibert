0,Introduction,"Water pollution is a growing crisis all over the world and most nations suffer from a lack of availability of clean water. Water bodies have been contaminated by several hazardous organic chemicals that are discharged from industries as effluent [1]. In order to effectively address this problem, researchers have proposed several techniques namely membrane filtration, osmosis, catalyst oxidation and electrocoagulation [2]. However, the proposed methods cannot be scaled to meet real-time requirements [3]. On the other hand, advanced oxidation technology (AOP) is among the recommended waste water treatment method that has gained relevance [4]. The AOPS process generates hydroxyl (OH·) and sulfate (SO4·-) free radicals which degrade harmful pollutants. These free radicals have sufficient oxidation potential to destroy strong organic pollutants [5]. Amidst the free radicals, SO4·- has a high oxidation stability between 2.5 and 3.1 V, whereas OH has an oxidation stability between 1.8 and 2.7 V. Therefore, it can be deduced that sulfate-based radicals are far better than hydroxyl radicals in efficiently demolishing organic pollutants [6]. Generally, OH radicals are produced from the activation of H2O2 [7]. On the other hand, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) / persulfate (PS) activation produce SO4·- and SO5·- radicals. However, PMS and PS are only stable in aqueous solution, which renders the mineralization of organic compounds to be a slow process [8,9]. To accelerate the reaction speed, PMS should be activated utilizing an external force. Previously, PMS activation was accomplished by heating, ultraviolet irradiation, using ultrasound agitation, and the use of base and transition metals [10]. Among the above techniques, uses of transition metals have been shown to be economically cheap and efficient [11]. Transition metals such as Co, Mn, Fe and Cu are recommended to be good activators [12]. However these metals have adverse effects on the human body, such as dissolved Co causing health problems, and have limitations in recycling. Likewise, the utility of Fe is hindered by high costs, thermodynamic instability and pH dependency, which prevents the use of this material on an industrial scale. In addition to this, all types of transition metals have a tendency to leach [13]. Copper selenide exists in various compositions with different phases such as CuSe, Cu2Se, CuSe2, Cu3Se2, Cu7Se4 and Cu2(1-x)Se, which have orthorhombic, monoclinic, cubic, tetragonal and hexagonal geometries, respectively [14]. Furthermore, copper selenide can be prepared in the form of diverse nanostructures including wires, spheres, nanorods and hexagonal nanopowders [15]. In this context, it must be mentioned that Cu2Se is a transition metal chalcogenide which has wide industrial applications such as photocatalysis, supercapacitor fabrication, thermoelectric and Fenton type catalyst development [16]. The film of Cu2Se hexagonal nanoplates used in photocatalysis and its photocatalytic efficiency was enhanced through the addition of H2O2. The system behaves as a Fenton-like catalyst. Moreover, the Cu+ ions react with the H2O2 to produce OH radical [17]. This in turn amplifies the effectiveness of the reaction. Previous research studies employed FeS for activating PMS, where the mediating atom was S [13]. Also, S(II) can serve as an electron donor. In the prepared Cu2Se catalyst, Se also has similar properties as S. Therefore, the PMS activation can be improved by the addition of Se. Moreover, hierarchical structures are receiving more attention due to several advantages such as high surface area, which can improve the reaction significantly [18]. Currently, no research has reported employing Cu2Se nanostructured film for PMS activation. The growing global economy needs alternative, sustainable, renewable energy sources of energy to control greenhouse gas emissions and the fluctuations in availability of fossil fuels. In this regard, Hydrogen (H2) is the safest renewable and non-polluting energy source and is considered as a viable alternative for conventional fossil fuels. Hydrogen is an attractive renewable energy source generated from non-carbon sources and can be synthesized through the electrolysis of water utilizing different approaches [19]. Among the available approaches, electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction from water electrolysis is the most economical [20]. Numerous catalysts were examined for their utility in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) such as Pt, Fe2O3, Co3S4, g-C3N4 and so on [21]. Among them, Pt showed low over potential in the HER reaction, but is a scarce element and is very expensive. Therefore, Pt cannot be employed in the HER reaction on an industrial scale [22]. Apart from Pt, other materials exhibit less efficiency due to their inherent physical properties. Due to these limitations, the design of cost effect catalysts from abundant raw material sources is highly desirable. In this regard, transition metal chalcogenides such as MoS2, WS2, CdS, CuS, Cu2Se and MoSe2 are potential candidates for H2 production [23]. In chalcogenides, 2D transition metals have the reactive sites edge of the plane. The reactive sites in chalcogenides play an important role in H2 production. In this study, we have prepared a Cu2Se nanostructure film using the hydrothermal approach. Activation of PMS was performed under varying PMS concentrations and different pH range. Radical participation was further analyzed by scavenging studies. Furthermore, the Cu2Se nanostructured film was utilized for four consecutive cycles proving its reusage. The dye degradation pathway was analyzed utilizing mass spectroscopy technique. After this process, HER activation was studied in an acidic medium."
1,Materials methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the precursor materials such as Copper foil (Cu), Sodium selenide (Na2Se), Reactive red 120 (RR120), 4-Nitrophenol (C6H5NO3), Methanol (CH3OH), Potassium peroxymonosulfate (2KHSO5·KHSO4·K2SO4), Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and Tert butyl alcohol (C4H10O) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd India. All the chemical and reactants used were of analytical grade and used without any purification. All the reactions were carried out with double distilled water (DDW)."
3,Synthesis of Cu2Se nanostructure on Cu foil,"2.2 Synthesis of Cu2Se nanostructure on Cu foil Hierarchical Cu2Se nanostructure film was grown on a copper substrate in the presence of Na2Se (30 mmol) through a one pot hydrothermal technique. A piece of copper foil (2 × 2 cm) was pretreated with diluted HCl to remove the external impurities and natural oxides. Pretreated Cu foil was placed in a Teflon autoclave and required amount of Na2Se aqueous solution and NaBH4 (1.5 g) were added. In this work, Cu serves as a substrate as well as the Cu source for the reaction. The well-sealed autoclave was kept at 180 °C for a duration of 24 h. After the completion of the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The black color film was taken out from the reactor and washed with the required amount of ethanol and water to remove the unreacted product. Finally, the black Cu2Se uniform film was dried in a hot air oven at 80 °C for 12 h."
4,Physical characterization,2.3 Physical characterization Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was carried to study the structural aspects and orientation of the film. A Shimadzu instrument model: (XRD 6000 with Cu Kα radiation) in the range of 20–70° and with a standard scanning speed was employed. Surface micrograph and EDX color mapping of the hierarchical Cu2Se nanostructure film was carried out using an instrument JEOL-SEM 6390 (Japan). The microstructural formation of Cu2Se film was characterized using HRTEM (FEI Quanta FEG 200). Pollutant absorbance intensity was analyzed using the UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Model: JASCO V-670). Fragmentation pathway analysis of the dye molecules were carried out using LC-Mass spectroscopy (Model: Agilent G6125BW-LC/MS).
5,Catalytic efficiency and analysis,"2.4 Catalytic efficiency and analysis Stock solutions of dye RR120 (1 × 10−3 M), PMS (1 × 10−5 M) and 4-Nitrophenol (C6H5NO3 ) (1 × 10−3 M) were prepared in DDW. The required volume of RR120 or 4-Nitrophenol solution was taken from the prepared stock solution into a 250 ml beaker. The reaction pH was altered by the addition of dilute NaOH and HCl. The prepared Cu2Se nanostructure film was placed into the reaction vessel. To induce the reaction, the PMS solution was added into the reaction vessel. The vessel was covered by aluminum foil to avoid the interference of day light. Samples from the reaction mixture were withdrawn at different time intervals and copious amounts of menthol were added to hinder the reaction. To estimate the degradation efficiency, the reaction mixture absorbance was analyzed with a UV spectrophotometer (Model: JASCO V-670) with maximum absorbance wavelength. The study on the role of free radicals was carried out using radical scavengers like methanol and tert‑butyl alcohol. To examine the reusability of the Cu2Se nanostructure film, four consecutive experimental runs were conducted. At end of each reaction, the film was washed with water and dried at 50 °C for 12 h before using it in the next run."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements As synthesized Cu2Se and pure Cu foil HER activation studied by 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with the Pt and Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) were used for the counter and reference electrode. All the electrochemical measurements were carried out in the three-electrode system using a CHI660-D electrochemical workstation. To determine the HER activity of Cu2Se and Cu foil, the CV characteristics were carried out in the scan rate of 0.5 mV/s. Before, to start the reaction the electrolyte was constantly purged by N2 gas for 30 min. The reversible hydrogen electrode was used for calibrating all potential values. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out in the same instrument. The equation used to converse the measured potential to RHE is given below, (1) E ( RHE ) = E Ag / AgCl + 0.059 pH + E Ag / AgCl o Where E Ag / Agcl o = 0.197 V at 25 °C and 0.5 M H2SO4 pH = 0."
7,Result and discussion,"Hydrothermally prepared Cu2Se hierarchical nanostructures film was analyzed by the XRD technique. Fig. 1 represents the XRD pattern of the prepared Cu2Se nanostructures film. Well-defined diffraction peaks were observed at 26.7, 44.8 and 53° which matched well with the pure Cu2Se phase JCPDS NO (65-2982).The diffraction peaks can be assigned to the following miller indices planes (111), (220) and (222) [24]. For comparison pure Cu foil XRD analysis was performed and is shown in Fig. 1. No other impurity phase was observed which reflected the high purity of the prepared material. The hydrothermal selenization reaction induced Cu2Se the formation of the nanostructures film. Kirkendall effect plays the major role in Cu2Se nanostructures formation [25]. Furthermore, to acquire information about the morphology of Cu2Se, scanning electron microscopy technique was employed. Fig. 2 (a)–(d) shows the micrograph images of Cu2Se nanostructures film. In Fig. 2(a) and (b) low and high magnification of Cu2Se, is shown where hierarchical like structure could be observed. Moreover the hierarchical microstructure is composed of numerous nanosheet with high density and with a high degree of uniformity. Fig. 3 (a) illustrates the EDAX spectra of Cu2Se nanostructures film. In which the EDAX shows the presence of Cu and Se metals. EDAX color mapping of the prepared Cu2Se nanostructures film is shown in Fig. 3(b)–(d). From the figure, the homogeneous distribution of the elements throughout the film is understood. The HRTEM analysis provides the further microstructural information about the formation of Cu2Se. Fig. 4 (a) shows the distance between adjacent lattice places spacing was 0.219 nm. The SAED pattern was taken from the inside edge of the Cu2Se particle. The Fig. 4(b) shows the several indexed dots to the (220) (311) (331) and (420) planes of the cubic crystalline structure. Fig. 4(b) represents the selected area electron diffraction pattern and high resolution TEM of the Cu2Se particle. The SAED and TEM results indicates the formation of Cu2Se from the copper foil along the (111) direction. Fig. 5 (a) and (b) represent the deconvolution and fitting XPS spectra of Cu2Se film. The three peaks observed in Fig. 5(a) corresponds to Cu2Se (Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p5/2), and Cu2O respectively. Fig. 5(b) illustrates the high resolution Se 3d XPS spectrum, in which two disguised peaks observed corresponds to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2. The presence of oxygen indicates the film has some absorbed moisture on the surface."
8,PMS activation and organic pollutant degradation,"3.1 PMS activation and organic pollutant degradation The PMS activation was studied through the degradation of RR120 dye at different conditions. Fig. 6 (a) depicts the UV absorbance spectra of RR120 degradation through PMS activation by the Cu2Se nanostructures film. The absorbance maximum decreased with increasing reaction time. Fig. 6(b) shows the plot of RR120 concentration with respect to reaction time. Obviously, lesser amount of degradation was observed in the presence of PMS and Cu2Se nanostructures film alone. It is ensure that either PMS and Cu2Se alone cannot degraded RR120. On the other hand, in the presence of both PMS and Cu2Se nanostructures film, the degradation of RR120 was rapid and reached complete degradation in 2 h. These results indicate that the PMS could be effectively activated by the Cu2Se nanostructures film. Further, scavenging studies were carried out to determine the radical species involved in the catalytic reaction, so that the reaction pathway could be understood. Previous research has shown that during the activation of PMS, sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals are normally produced [26]. Two different scavengers namely menthol and tert-butyl alcohol were used in the study. It is well known that TBA serves as an effective scavenger of ·OH. Methanol is a better trapping agent for ·OH and SO4·-. Fig. 6(c) represents the RR120 concentration changes ratio during the degradation with different scavengers. Under natural conditions, the quenching effect of methanol was slightly higher than the TBA quencher. This result clearly showed that, the degradation of RR120 was chiefly accomplished by the SO4 radical rather than the OH radical. The possible PMS reaction mechanism is given below. (2) HSO 5 − → Cu ( I ) SO 4 • − + O H − (3) SO 4 • − + H 2 O → SO 4 2 − + O H − (4) ( Cu ⟷ I Se ⟷ I Cu ) + HSO 5 − → ( Cu − Se − Cu ) − OS O 3 + O H − (5) ( Cu − Se − Cu ) − OS O 3 → ( Cu ⟷ I Se ⟷ I Cu ) + SO 4 • − Recycling of the catalyst is a very important factor in PMS activation. To understand the stability of the Cu2Se nanostructure film, the film was repeatedly used in four consecutive cycles. From Fig. 6(d), the degradation efficiency of RR120 is found to be 99.5, 82.2, 79.8 and 61.2% for the four cycles. This observation indicates that, the Cu2Se nanostructures film helps the PMS activation even at the 4th cycle of usage. The effect of PMS concentration on the RR120 dye degradation was also analyzed and is shown in Fig. 7 (a). The degradation efficiency of RR120 increased with respect to time for all the PMS concentration. However, while increasing the amount of PMS concentration, the degradation efficiency was amplified. This may be ascribed to the production of more free radicals in the presence of Cu2Se nanostructures film [27]. The production of more number of radicals quickly destroys the RR120 dye molecule in the aqueous solution. The degradation reaction was further conducted at different pH, because PMS activation by metals strongly depends on the reaction pH [28]. To analyze the pH dependency the reaction was carried out under four different pH. Fig. 7(b) shows the RR120 degradation reaction pseudo first order rate constant (k) under different pH conditions. In an acidic pH the RR120 degradation reaction rate constant was low compared with rate constant measured at other pH. When increasing the pH of the reaction in the RR120 degradation the rate constant also increased. The degradation rate constant was very high at pH 10. However, beyond pH 10 there was little change in the rate constant. The pH dependency of the reaction indicates that the PMS activation could be carried out over a wide pH range using the Cu2Se nanostructure film. We further studied the PMS activation ability of the Cu2Se nanostructure film in the degradation of an organic pollutant like 4-Nitrophenol. Fig. 7(c) shows the UV absorbance spectra of 4-Nitrophenol degradation by the activation of PMS using the Cu2Se nanostructure film. The 4-Nitrophenol maximum absorbance intensity was nearly suppressed after a time duration of 3 h in the presence of PMS and Cu2Se nanostructure film. Fig. 7(d) represents the plot of C/Co vs reaction time plot for the 4-Nitrophenol degradation. The 4-Nitrophenol degradation efficiency reached 80% in a time span of 3 h. After reusage, the structural stability of Cu2Se nanostructure films was analyzed by XRD and is shown in Fig. 8 . No obvious peak shift was observed in the fresh and recycled Cu2Se nanostructure film. The total study indicates that the PMS could be effectively activated using the Cu2Se nanostructure film, which was very stable for repeated use. The oxidation degradation pathway of RR120 by Cu2Se nanostructure films was investigated by intermediated product detection through MS. The reactive red 120 (m/z = 1337) was degraded by the attack of sulfate radicals in to fragments like (m/z = 376) and (m/z = 201). These molecules are further decomposed to form 2-naphthol (m/z = 144). Furthermore, the degradation involves a ring opening process to form aliphatic compounds likemuconic acid (m/z = 142). Finally these intermediates are degraded to carbon dioxide and water in the mineralization reaction. Based on the MS result a possible mechanism is proposed as given in Fig. 9 . To determine the HER activity of the prepared Cu2Se catalyst and Cu foil CV characteristics was analyzed by three electrode system using 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The polarization curve was measured for Cu2Se and Cu foil in the scan rate of 0.5 mV/s. The CV curve of the Cu2Se showed no oxidation and reduction peaks. During the synthesis of Cu2Se, the copper foil was completely covered by selenium in the selenization process. This indicates the copper sites are protected by selenium on the surface. For comparison, pure Cu foil electrochemical HER activity was studied. The HER activity of the Cu and Cu2Se film was given in Fig. 10 (a). The Cu foil shows higher over potential which indicating lower electrocatalytic performance for HER activity than Cu2Se. The over potential at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 was found to be −0.62 V and −0.32 V for Cu and Cu2Se respectively. The Cu2Se get less over potential than Cu foil due to the presence of selenium on the copper sites. The current density of the polarization curve was observed to be 0.38 j A/cm2 and 1.71 j A/cm2 for Cu and Cu2Se respectively. After the 500 cycle, the Cu2Se film was not affected any efficiency lose. Its electro catalytic performance was observed in 1.63 j A/cm2. Furthermore, to understanding for H2 evolution study, the EIS measurement was carried out. The EIS analysis was also carried out in a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 KHz. Fig. 10(b) shows the Nyquist plot of the EIS for Cu foil and Cu2Se. Generally, lower charge resistance shows the maximum HER activity. The Cu foil exhibited very higher charge transfer resistance on the other hand, the charge transfer resistance was very lowest for Cu2Se than Cu foil. The smallest arc indicates the excellent electron transfer ability and the Cu2Se film was having efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution catalyst. Tafel slope of the HER activity of copper and Cu2Se were fitted with tafel equation. The obtained tafel slope of the copper and Cu2Se were 142 and 89 mV/dec which was shown in Fig. 10(c). The Cu2Se tafel slope was much lower than copper and also reported MoS2 nanosheet [29,30]."
9,Conclusion,"Vertically aligned hierarchical nanostructure thin film of Cu2Se was successfully prepared through facile hydrothermal method. The Cu2Se nanostructures film exhibited excellent activation for PMS, when employed for the degradation of RR120 dye and 4-Nitrophenol.The efficiency of the reaction was much higher under base pH condition. The degradation reaction followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics which depended on pH. The scavenger study confirmed that the degradation reaction was predominantly accelerated by SO4 radical rather than the OH radical. The efficiency was found to be 99.5, 82.2, 79.8 and 61.2% for the four consecutive experimental runs using the catalyst. There were no considerable structural distortions observed in the Cu2Se nanostructures film even after its reuse. The Cu2Se film exhibited higher electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution than pure Copper foil with stable acid medium. The high charge transfer efficacy represents an increase in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity."
