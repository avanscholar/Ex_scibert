0,Introduction,"With the growing interest in fighting against global warming and carbon dioxide emissions, researchers are looking to replace fossil fuels by renewable energy sources. Biomass is one of these energy sources that can serve as a fossil fuel alternation [1]. Gasification of biomass is an attractive alternative for the production of synthesis gas. A number of researchers have investigated the potential of biomass gasification for the production of synthesis gas [2]. Biomass gasification is a thermochemical process that converts biomass into producer gas containing gaseous species [3,4]. CO2 is a by-product in the gasification which can be absorbed by solid sorbents such as CaO to form CaCO3 at high temperature [5,6]. Furthermore, CO2 capture by CaO can increase the H2 content [5,7,8]. However, there are some major issues associated with the CaO catalyst. Probably the best investigated problem is loss of sorbent activity with increasing reaction cycles [9], which is mainly due to the loss of specific surface area and pore volume caused by CaO sintering [10]. Consequently it is quite important to develop highly reactive CaO sorbents that have stable volumetric performance over multiple cycles. In several works, CaO sorbents have been examined to improve the catalytic activity with the incorporation of Fe2O3 [11–13]. Moreover, some researchers have worked to enhance the cyclic stability of CaO by doping the ZrO2 [14–16] or CeO2 [17,18]. Fe/CaO catalysts have been reported to be useful for the improvement of H2 yield and decomposition of tar [11]. Consequently, the deactivation of CaO could be avoided by decomposition of tar in biomass gasification [19]. Huang et al. [20] have investigated the performance of Fe/CaO catalyst in biomass gasification. It was revealed that CaO was easily deactivated by biomass tar. So, the addition of Fe on CaO prevented CaO deactivation by tar, thus promoting biomass gasification and hydrogen production. Furthermore, CaO suffers from cyclic instability in the presence coke and sintering. It is reported that incorporation of zirconia in the Ca-based sorbents improves the stability of sorbents [21]. Koirala et al. [22] developed a series of CaO-based sorbents by a wide range of zirconia loadings. They concluded that the Zr/Ca sorbent with the optimum molar ratio is the best choice due to its excellent and stable performance. Wang et al. [23] doped different amounts of CeO2 with CaO-based sorbents. The sorbent with optimum ratio of Ca/Ce showed an excellent absorption capacity and remarkable cycle durability. Lu et al. [17] used a wide range of refractory dopants (Si, Ti, Cr, Co, Zr, and Ce) to develop sorbents with excellent mechanical strength. Among all of the doped CaO sorbents, Zr-doped CaO was found to show the optimal CO2-capture performance under similar operating conditions. In previous research works, researchers have either incorporated the iron oxide in CaO [11–13] to improve the catalytic activity or added ZrO2 [14–16] and CeO2 [17,18] to maintains the cyclic stability by preventing the thermal sintering. However, the combined effect for the incorporation of both ZrO2/CeO2 and Fe2O3 on CaO performance is still lacking. Furthermore, the catalysts are required to have an excellent catalytic performance for H2 production with sufficient cyclic stability during repeated cycles of gasification and regeneration. Therefore, CaO was modified by incorporation of zirconium/cerium and iron oxide on CaO in different loading ratio using the impregnation method. To the best of our knowledge, the synergistic effects of ZrO2/CeO2 and Fe2O3 on CaO catalyst performance have not been studied yet. In our previous research work [24], cellulose and lignin were gasified in order to evaluate and compare their gas products and also understand their gasification processes in presence of CaO. Based on the observed results, lignin component was found to be significant for hydrogen-rich syngas production as compared to cellulose. Therefore, lignin was selected in this research work. Furthermore, the purpose for the selection of lignin was to avoid the influence of biomass minerals on selected catalysts. Experimental studies about gasification of lignin by other researchers are well discussed in our previous research work [24]. Lignin is a complex racemic polymer and is composed of p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl and syringil units; an example of a lignin structure. Since only the lignin fraction of the biomass is aromatic in nature, lignin represents a potential precursor for PAH formation. Three hydroxycinnamyl alcohols considered precursors of lignin, which only differ in their degree of methoxylation [25]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Alkaline lignin was used as a biomass component, which was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. The ultimate and proximate analysis of lignin is discussed in the previous paper [24] as shown in Table 1 ."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts The calcination of calcium oxide (CaO) was carried out at 950 °C for 3 h before it was utilized. First, the Zirconium nitrate (Zr(NO3)4.5H2O) was dissolved in the right amount of ethanol solution. Then, Fe(NO3)3.9H2O and CaO were mixed with the solution and stirred to achieve a suspension at atmospheric temperature. A magnetic stirrer was used to maintain the suspension at 70 °C until all the liquid had evaporated, after which the mixture was dried in an oven for 12 h at 110 °C. Finally, the calcination of samples was carried out for 3 h at 700 °C then the samples were crushed and sieved to the designated particle size. The weight ratio of CaO in each modified catalysts were 85% and remaining were mixed up with ZrO2 and Fe2O3 with the variable amount as shown in Table 2 .For Ce–Fe/CaO catalysts, the same impregnation method was used as described above. In previous works [26,27], researchers have found that the 5% addition of Fe in CaO displayed the best catalytic activity, therefore, this optimum ratio of Fe/CaO was also prepared in this research work to compare its performance with Zr–Fe/CaO and Ce–Fe/CaO catalysts for hydrogen production. Fe/CaO catalyst was prepared by the same impregnation method as discussed above with the addition of 5% of Fe(NO3)3.9H2O in calcined CaO. The catalyst with Fe/CaO weight ratio was named as 5Fe/CaO."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup The experimental gasification system (Fig. 1 ) consists of a laboratory-scale batch fluidized bed reactor (length = 600 mm, i.d. = 20 mm), temperature controller, steam generation, gas supply system, a syngas collecting system and other auxiliary facilities. N2was used as the carrier gas (0.5 ml/min), and distilled water (0.2L/min) was used for steam generation. The flue gas produced by the gasification process, leaving the upper part of the reactor, cooled, dried, and was collected by gas bags. The flue gases were collected at 5-min intervals in gas bags and the H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 concentrations were inspected using a gas analyzer (MRU VARIO PLUS). The selected feeding materials (5 g of sample per test) were gasified at a temperature of 700 °C with a CaO/biomass ratio of 1.0and particle sizes of selected feedstock was 50 μm–100 μm. The resulting solid residues were collected at the bottom of the furnace. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, EDX, TGA and SEM analysis of the solid products were carried out to evaluate main compounds and examine the catalytic performance of catalysts. After the experiment, the carbon content was calculated as: the solid residue mixture after each test was calcined under N2 atmosphere at 900 °C for 2 h, and the weight loss was caused by the CO2 release from the calcium oxide sorbent. Then, the residue was calcined under air atmosphere at 900 °C for 2 h, and the weight loss was caused by the CO2 release from the residual char. The carbon weight ratio of condensable products can be calculated by the subtraction method in the percentage of carbon weight. It is essential to point out that the carbon in char residue involves unconverted char and additional CO2 adsorbed by CaO carbonation reaction. The experiments were repeated for three times and the average values were adopted for more reliable results. 2.3.1 Product analyses The concentration of CO2, CO, H2, and CH4 was measured by a gas analyzer. The total gas productionYGas is calculated as: (1) Y G a s = Q N 2 1 − X C O 2 − X C O − X H 2 − X C H 4 where Q N 2 is the N2 volume, X C O 2 is the CO2 volume fraction of the total gas, X C O is the CO volume fraction of the total gas, X H 2 is the H2 volume fraction of the total gas, and X C H 4 is the CH4 volume fraction of the total gas. Each product gas yield Yi is calculated as: (2) Y i = Y G a s × X i where X i is the different gas volume fraction of the total gas, i refers to CO2, CO, H2, and CH4."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The XRD analysis of fresh CaO catalysts modified with Fe/ZrO2, Fe/CeO2, and Fe2O3 is shown in Fig. 2 (a)-(c), respectively. The XRD pattern of Zr–Fe/CaO catalysts demonstrated the existence of five different crystal phases: CaO, Ca(OH)2, CaZrO3, Fe2O3,and Ca2Fe2O5. The intensities of the XRD peaks, attributed to CaO, Ca(OH)2 and CaZrO3 phases, are comparable whereas the intensity of the corresponding Fe2O3 and Ca2Fe2O5 peaks are quite low in all three catalysts. Furthermore, the intensities of CaZrO3 phases increased when ZrO2 was added. The results show that ZrO2 reacts with CaO to form CaZrO3 phase, and more CaZrO3 phases were formed with the increase of ZrO2 content. Moreover, apart from the formation of CaZrO3 phase, Ca2Fe2O5 was also formed in 2# Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst which is considered for tar cracking and thus prevent the deactivation of CaO. The main peak corresponds to CaO, CeO2, Fe2O3,and Ca2Fe2O5, and the strength of CaO is dominant to other compounds in Ce–Fe/CaO catalysts as shown in Fig. 2(b). However, the XRD plot shows obvious diffraction peaks of Ca2Fe2O5 for the 5Fe/CaO catalyst in Fig. 2(c), which is completely different from those of Zr–Fe/CaO and Ce–Fe/CaO. The results show that Fe reacted with CaO to form a Ca2Fe2O5 phase. In addition, the diffraction peaks of Ca2Fe2O5 for zirconium and cerium-doped Fe/CaO catalyst was much shorter and broader than that of 5Fe/CaO. It might be concluded that Fe mass was incorporated into the ZrO2 and CeO2 lattice, both the layers of ZrO2 and CeO2 covered the catalyst surface and hindered the interaction between the Fe–CaO, which induced the small crystallite size of Ca2Fe2O5 in both Zr–Fe/CaO and Ce–Fe/CaO catalysts."
7,Effect of elements loading content,"3.2 Effect of elements loading content Fig. 3 displays the gas concentration and cumulative hydrogen yield of the lignin gasification at 700 °C in 75 min. Fig. 3(a)-(c) respectively represent the zirconium added catalysts: (a) 1# Zr–Fe/CaO, (b) 2# Zr–Fe/CaO, (c) 3# Zr–Fe/CaO and Fig. 3 (d)-(f) respectively, represent the cerium doped catalysts (d) 1# Ce–Fe/CaO, (e) 2# Ce–Fe/CaO, and (f) 3# Ce–Fe/CaO. The hydrogen concentration decreases, as time increases. On the contrary, the concentration of CO2shows an increasing trend. When the gasification time is more than 10 min, the syngas is mainly composed of CO2 and H2 with very less concentrations of CO and CH4.Initially, the CO2 concentration is relatively low due to the absorption of CO2 by the catalyst and then gradually increases over time. The hydrogen concentration increased in the first 13 min of the process and then indicated a decreasing trend. Some important reactions related to the use of CaO in biomass steam gasification are listed in Table 3 . The hydrogen productions from 1# Zr–Fe/CaO, 2# Zr–Fe/CaOand 3# Zr–Fe/CaO were 44.49, 47.96, and 42.91 mol/kg, respectively. While, 1# Ce–Fe/CaO, 2# Ce–Fe/CaOand 3# Ce–Fe/CaO displayed the 42.83, 36.88 and 36.08 mol/kg of hydrogen, respectively. The XRD results (Fig. 2) revealed that no mixed or compound oxide phase was formed in the case of CaO–CeO2, Fe–CeO2, and Fe–ZrO2 catalysts. However, the compounds of CaZrO3 phases were observed in the case of CaO–ZrO2. These differences in properties over Zr–Fe/CaO and Ce–Fe/CaO catalyst may be responsible for variations in catalytic activities for hydrogen production. In terms of catalytic activity, zirconium added catalysts revealed a comparably excellent performance for hydrogen production as compared to cerium doped catalysts. Among the Ce–Fe/CaO and Zr–Fe/CaO catalysts used, 1# Ce–Fe/CaO and 2# Zr–Fe/CaO showed the highest catalytic performance, respectively, which can be attributed to the tar cracking ability ofCa2Fe2O5.Therefore, these two catalysts were chosen to give a further investigation of product distributions and CO2 absorption and desorption test in comparison with pure CaO and 5Fe/CaO catalysts. As reported by the Sun et al. [26] that Ca2Fe2O5 is efficient in the decomposition of polyaromatic tar during the biomass gasification, resulting in producing more gas yield. However, Huang et al. [20] revealed that the use of the only Ca2Fe2O5 for biomass gasification is ineffective, and a synergistic effect between Ca2Fe2O5 and CaO in the catalyst must exist to enhance the syngas production and tar removal. The performance of catalysts on product distribution (gas, liquid, and char) is shown in Table .4 . Comparing the gas composition obtained with a pure CaO catalyst at the same conditions, it is evident that the yields of H2, CH4, and CO2 were lower, while the liquid and solid products higher, indicating the lower carbon conversion as compared to modified catalysts. An evident difference in the results is found when the Fe2O3 was added to the catalyst. The gas yield increased from 64 to 66%, while the liquid and solidyields decreased by 1%. The amount of liquid product decreased, when Fe2O3 is loaded onto the CaO surface, indicating that the Fe reacts with the tar, which leads to the conversion of the tar into H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and other light hydrocarbons [20]. Product distribution with gas composition using 2# Zr–Fe/CaO and 1# Ce–Fe/CaO catalysts were also compared to 5Fe/CaO catalyst at the same conditions to show what extent the H2 produced by the addition of ZrO2and CeO2can share in changing gas yield and its composition. The experimental observations showed that 2# Zr–Fe/CaO is more suitable for hydrogen production than other catalysts. In the presence of this catalyst, the char product decreased compared to the products with pure and other modified catalysts, which indicates that gasification reaction of char is improved and produced more gas yield with less residual char. The experimental results clearly show that 2# Zr–Fe/CaO displayed considerably higher H2 yield with less residual char than from tests performed with 1# Ce–Fe/CaO and 5Fe/CaO catalysts. It is ranked in order of the H2 productions: 2# Zr–Fe/CaO> 5Fe/CaO > Ce–Fe/CaO > CaO. As shown in Fig. 2, when zirconium and iron oxide were loaded on the CaO, the CaZrO3 and Fe2O3 phases were formed. Oxygen vacancies in the former phases greatly preferred the water adsorption, which provides favorable conditions for carbon gasification and water gas shift reactions [29], resulting in higher production of H2. Hence, the addition of ZrO2 on Fe/CaO seems to play a positive role in hydrogen formation during the process, which is probably as a consequence of the stabilization of the CaO particles from sintering [30] and enhancement of the catalytic activity of Fe catalyst [31]. Also, ZrO2 as a catalyst provides a high conversion of the feedstock product having high hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio in the product gas [32]. The properties mentioned above of in ZrO2 prove the fact that the catalytic activity of Zr–Fe/CaO is better than other catalysts."
8,Characterization of gasified residues,"The XRD, EDX, TGA and SEM analyses were performed in view of phase composition, element distribution and morphology of the catalysts, in order to attain a better understanding of the physical and chemical evolution mechanism of used catalysts. As discussed in previous sections thatCeO2 modified Fe/CaO catalyst exhibited poor catalytic performance. Therefore this catalyst is not considered in this section for further investigation."
9,SEM,"4.1 SEM The differences in particle morphologies are visible in the SEM images of the used 5Fe/CaO and 2#Zr–Fe/CaO.Fig. 4 (a) shows that particles have been accumulated into larger particles and several large pores and cracks can be seen on used 5Fe/CaO, indicating an obvious sintering of crystallinity. However, these cracks were not observed on the used 2#Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst, and no significant sintering occurred. Consequently, enhancement in sintering-resistance could prevent the decrease in pore volume of the catalyst. It implies that ZrO2 can significantly inhibit the sintering and improve the thermal stability of the catalyst. This finding is in agreement with the results of another researcher [33]. Sintering is considered as one of the biggest issues in loss of catalyst active surface due to crystallite growth which leads to the degradation of the catalyst. If the catalyst is highly sintered, the recovery of activity upon regeneration is likely to be a major challenge for the cyclic stability of the CaO catalyst in the gasification process. Since the catalysts are required to have a good catalytic performance for H2 production with catalytic stability in repeated cycles of gasification. SEM images clearly indicate that catalyst did not sinter when ZrO2was loaded on Fe/CaO catalyst, while CaO sintered when the addition of only Fe element modified it. This observation implies that the addition of Fe2O3 can only increase the catalytic activity for hydrogen production, but it is not suitable when the catalyst is needed in the repeated cycle due to degradation of the catalyst caused by sintering. However, as described above, ZrO2-modified Fe/CaO is suitable for achieving a good balance between catalytic activities and sintering inhibition. The addition of ZrO2 effectively prevents the agglomeration and sintering of CaO crystallites, which in any case, would be more suitable for utilization in multiple cycles."
10,EDX,"4.2 EDX The characterizations of an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) for testing the performance of used catalysts areshown in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), all the elements were distributed relatively uniformly on the surface of particles. The much dark color of the Ca elemental mapping illustrated the higher mole concentration of Ca compared to Zr and Fe elements over the both used catalysts. The carbon mapping is entirely different as can be seen in Fig. 5 (a) & (b). For the 2# Zr–Fe/CaO in Fig. 5(a), the isolated regions enriched with C are identified. However, it is observed that carbon is uniformly distributed over the used 5Fe/CaO catalyst and that detected segregation is lower than used 2# Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst. Furthermore, the darkcolor of the C mapping illustrated the higher concentration of carbon over 5Fe/CaO catalyst, indicating that the coke on the 5Fe/CaO has a higher degree of aromatization than the coke on the 2# Zr–Fe/CaO, and the formation of the aromatic ring structure is more abundant [34]. The formed carbon can be encapsulated on the surface of the catalyst, resulting in the creation of carbon whiskers, which can lift crystallites from the surface of the catalyst, leading to sintering [35]. This observation is in accordance with the characterization results of scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) of used 5Fe/CaO catalyst(shown in Fig. 4).The carbon deposition is a common problem for the deactivation of catalysts in the gasification process. The catalyst with the addition of the specific molar composition of ZrO could exhibitexcellent activity and low carbon deposition."
11,TG and DTG analysis of coke,"4.3 TG and DTG analysis of coke The TGA data provided with mass loss profiles of catalysts with respect to temperature in air atmosphere was presented in Fig. 6 (a) & (b). The data pertaining to mass loss profiles were utilized to determine the coke formation on the used catalysts. Weight losses were about 11.4% and 10.3% for 2#Zr–Fe/CaO and 5Fe/CaO respectively and their weightlessness section was in the range of 20–480 °C. The more loss of weight from 2#Zr–Fe/CaO could be due to the removal of moisture over 100 °C. Nevertheless, there was a significant weight decrease at 900 °C for both the used catalysts. When the temperature was 480°C–900 °C, then 25.4% and 34.0% of weight losses were observed for 2#Zr–Fe/CaO and 5Fe/CaO respectively, indicating that more coke was formed over the surface of 5Fe/CaO than that of 2#Zr–Fe/CaO. Moreover, From Fig. 6, it can be observed that the DTG curves of both used catalytic show two distinct peaks in the major weight-loss stage. For both used catalysts, first peak is appeared at around 400–500 °C. The feeding materials were mixture of spent catalyst and lignin residue. So, mass loss during first peak could be attributed to the decomposition of the residual lignin and char. Vamvuka et al. [36] have also confirmed that mass loss at around 400–550 °C corresponds to the decomposition of the remaining lignin and combustion of the residual volatiles and char. Residue lignin presents in both the spent catalysts, therefore, there is no much difference in first peak of DTG curves. Furthermore, according to the XRD results in Fig. 7 , abundant CaCO3 existed in the used 5Fe/CaO catalyst, so the mass loss occurred at 700 °C might be also related with the decomposition of CaCO3, which could also contribute to the mass loss profiles. Although, some researchers have revealed that ZrO2 plays a fundamental role in minimizing the coke formation. Therdthianwong et al. [37] have investigated the promoting effect of ZrO2 addition on Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for H2 gas production from CH4/CO2 reforming reactions. They have reported that ZrO2 can enhance dissociation of CO2 forming oxygen intermediates near the contact between ZrO2 and nickel, wherein the deposited coke is subsequently gasified. Pompeo et al. [38] have concluded that the formation of carbon is a regulating factor for the stability of the active phase, and the presence of ZrO2 plays a fundamental role in minimizing this process. Consequently, the properties of ZrO2 may be an improvement in metal dispersibility, a decrease in sintering, an increase in thermal stability, and an increase in oxygen storage capacity, in this way contributing to gasification of carbon formed during reforming [39]."
12,XRD,"4.4 XRD Fig. 7 shows the XRD results of the used 5Fe/CaO and 2# Zr–Fe/CaOcatalysts reacted under the same operating operations. The used 5Fe/CaO and 2# Zr–Fe/CaO catalysts clearly contained CaCO3 crystals, which indicated that the carbonation reaction occurred in the catalytic process. XRD analysis identified those crystalline phases of iron as magnetite (Fe3O4) and at lower extent of hematite (Fe2O3), accompanied with complete exclusion of Ca2Fe2O5 crystals in used 5Fe/CaO catalyst. It could be inferred that the Ca2Fe2O5 reacted with CO2 and decomposed into Fe2O3, which could be further reduced to Fe3O4 by reaction (R13) (12) C a 2 F e 2 O 5 + 2 C O 2 → 2 C a C O 3 + F e 2 O 3 (13) 3 F e 2 O 3 + H 2 → F e 3 O 4 + H 2 O Furthermore, it was reported in the literature [40] that the formation of Fe3O4is mainly attributed to the in situ partial reductions of Fe3+ in Ca2Fe2O5 by the generated syngas. Although Ca2Fe2O5 phase plays an important role in the catalytic cracking of tar and promoting the functions of CaO during biomass gasification process [41], the complete exclusion of Ca2Fe2O5 crystals from used 5Fe/CaO catalyst can restrict the use of this catalyst from multiple cycles. For 2# Zr–Fe/CaO, the Ca2Fe2O5 phase is detected before and after the catalytic test, and no Fe3O4 phase is observed. The presence of ZrO2 stabilized Ca2Fe2O5 and Fe2O3, which enables its utilization for multiple cycles. Therefore, 2#Zr–Fe/CaO was selected to give a further analysis of its cyclic stability."
13,Cyclic stability of the 2#Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst,"Cyclic experiments were carried out to investigate the cyclic performances of the 2# Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst. At the end of the cycle test, the solid residue was mixed with 5 g of lignin, and the mixture was used as a raw material for the next cycle (gasification-regeneration). As shown, in Fig. 8 (a), the concentration of CO2 shows an increasing trend with the cycles. The hydrogen concentration was higher in the first cycle and then presented a downward trend. Increasing the cycles from 1 to 5, the average volumetric composition of hydrogen decreased from 73.89% to 69.24%, but by increasing the cycle to 10, a further decreased was noted (to 68.68%). The rise of concentration of CO2was observed from 22.65 to 25.68% when the gasification cycle increased from 1 to 10. The continued rise of CO2 level concerning cycles would be due to formations of CaCO3 layers on the catalyst, resulting in a reduction of carbonation reactions. This observation implies that CO2 reacted with CaO to form a CaCO3 phase, and with increasing CO2 gas, more CaCO3 phases were formed, which results in the decrease of carbonation conversion during the later cycles. Consequently, there could be a higher concentration of CO2. The CaO component can play an essential role in the absorption of CO2 during the gasification process, which can effectively shift the chemical reaction equilibrium of water-gas shift reaction, thereby converting CO into H2. The cumulative hydrogen yields for the ten cycles are presented in Fig. 8 (b). It is observed that the regenerated 2#Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst show a high impact on hydrogen production with the number of cycles. It can be seen from Fig. 8 (b) that catalyst showed obvious catalytic activities and gave a nearly constant rate of hydrogen generation in all ten cycles, indicating stable catalytic activity of the catalysts which could be due to the interaction of ZrO2 with Fe and CaO. It can be seen that the H2 yields came to a steady state after two cycles, which can be attributed to the synergy effect between Fe2O3 and ZrO2. However, there was a noticeable loss in H2 yield, which decreased by 2.67 and 1.55% from the first to the second and second to tenth cycles, respectively. The hydrogen yields reached 38.30, 37.09, and 36.70 mol/kg in the 1st, 5th, and 10thcyclic experiment, respectively; indicating better catalyst cyclic stability which is consistent with the SEM results which clearly showed that ZrO2 modified Fe/CaO catalyst exhibited better resistance to sintering than a Fe/CaO catalyst. Furthermore, the addition of ZrO2 could prevent the particle agglomeration and sintering as observed in the used catalyst by SEM, which is believed to be the leading cause of the improvement in the catalyst stability. Table 5 shows the standard deviation values of syngas composition for 10 cycles. Crystallite structures of the 2# Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst that was used in multiple cycles were investigated by powder XRD diffraction as shown in Fig. 9 . The used 2# Zr–Fe/CaO clearly contained CaCO3, CaO, CaZrO3, Ca2Fe2O5 and Fe2O3 crystals in the first cycle, 3rd, 5th and 10th cycles, respectively. The detected peaks of CaO are due to the regeneration process of the used catalyst. However, when the catalyst used for 3rd, 5th and 10thtime, the diffraction peaks of Fe3O4appeared, indicating that partial reduction of Fe2O3 in Fe3O4 did happen. However, the diffraction peaks of Ca2Fe2O5 remained the same in all cycles, indicating the stability of the catalyst, which is in agreement with the cyclic experimental results of the used catalyst and showed that the crystalline phases of iron in the presence of ZrO2 were less reducible. As a result, the syngas composition in multiple cycles relatively stabilized."
14,Conclusion,"Lignin steam gasification experiments have been carried out using the Zr and Ce modified -Fe/CaO catalysts to investigate the additive effect of zirconium and cerium on Fe/CaO catalyst. Catalysts were prepared using the impregnation method with different loading ratio of Fe/ZrO2 and Fe/CeO2 for Zr–Fe/CaO and Ce–Fe/CaO catalysts, respectively. Then, optimum ratios of both catalystswere compared with Fe/CaO that was also prepared by the same preparation method with the addition of 5% of Fe to CaO, which has been found the optimum ratio in previously published literature. Results are summarized as follow: 1 Among the Ce–Fe/CaO and Zr–Fe/CaO catalysts used, 1# Ce–Fe/CaO and 2# Zr–Fe/CaO showed the highest catalytic performance, respectively. In addition, 2# Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst gave a nearlyconstant rate of hydrogen generation in multiple cycles, indicating stable catalytic activity of the catalyst. 2 The XRD results revealed that no mixed or compound oxide phase was formed in the case of CaO–CeO2, Fe–CeO2, and Fe–ZrO2 catalysts. However, compounds of CaZrO3 phases were observed in the case of CaO–ZrO2. 3 The significant improvement over a CaO catalyst by adding the appropriate amounts of ZrO2 and Fe2O3 is encouraging towards the gasification products. 2# Zr–Fe/CaO catalyst exhibited higher performance in the steam gasification of lignin than Ce–Fe/CaO and 5Fe/CaO, especially, in terms of hydrogen production, biomass conversion. 4 SEM images indicated that more and larger cracks were formed in 5Fe/CaO, showingobvious sintering of crystallinity and no crack was noticeable in ZrO2 modified catalyst after gasification. 5 The characterization results of the used catalysts showed that the coke formation over the 5Fe/CaO was more significant than that over the Zr modified Fe/CaO catalyst. Furthermore, the latter catalyst showed higher resistance to sintering with no complete exclusion of Ca2Fe2O5 crystals in the used catalyst. 6 Hence, it is concluded that doping of ZrO2 on Fe/CaO is of interest to improve the stability of CaO sorbent and H2 production."
