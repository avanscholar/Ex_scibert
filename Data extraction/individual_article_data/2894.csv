0,Introduction,"The continuous advancement and development of nowadays society, while benefiting mankind, have left two huge hidden dangers to the planet, namely the irreversible pollution of the environment and the accelerated consumption of non-renewable energy [1–3]. It is imperative to explore an efficient, non-polluting energy source. Since Honda and Fujishima [4] discovered the water photolysis assisted with TiO2 semiconductor, solar-drived hydrogen evolution has become the hottest domain [5–9]. Among the past decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted into exploiting inexhaustible sunlight and substantial water to promote hydrogen energy production [10–13]. Semiconductor photocatalysts for solar-drived water splitting hydrogen evolution are substantially investigated and reported now [14,15]. Tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) is recognized as a promising semiconductor photocatalyst whereby its light corrosion resistance, favorable optical absorptivity, high chemical durability and low cost [16,17]. Nevertheless, the large band gap energy (4.0 eV) of Ta2O5 greatly limits the absorption of visible light and the ability to catalyze photolysis of water. In addition, its fast photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination rate is also a major injury to their application in photocatalysis [18]. Considering the intrinsic properties of Ta2O5, many methods have been applied to modify it to improve its photocatalytic activity, such as element doping [19], loading noble metal cocatalyst [20] and constructing heterostructures [21] or homogeneous structures [22], etc. Recently, defect engineering has attracted attention as an available means of providing abundant active sites and tunning optical properties for semiconductors. Within the forbidden gap, defect levels are induced by the existence of oxygen vacancies [23]. Excited electrons are believed to transport by dynamic trapping and escaping continually by defect levels according to the Poole-Frenkel conduction mechanism [24]. Oxygen deficient gray Ta2O5 nanowires with enhanced solar light absorption and a narrowing bandgap were synthesized by Zhang and Huang et al. [25]. The gray Ta2O5 proved to be very active in photocatalytic contamination removal and hydrogen production compared to the pristine Ta2O5. Zhao et al. demonstrated that ultrafine Ta2O5 nanoparticles containing abundant oxygen vacancies exhibited outstanding catalytic performance for non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries [26]. The above reports enlighten us to develop a Ta2O5 photocatalyst with abundant oxygen defects to enhance its photocatalytic performance. Besides, Guo et al. [27] calculated the behavior of the O vacancies in crystalline and amorphous Ta2O5 by first principle methods. They found that amorphous Ta2O5 has different coordination of oxygen sites from crystalline Ta2O5. However, the electronic structure and the formation energy of oxygen vacancy are parallel in two phases. Considering its simpler fabrication process, amorphous Ta2O5 is more desirable in application. In this work, an oxygen-deficient amorphous Ta2O5 nanoparticle photocatalyst has been synthesized by a solvothermal method and subsequent heat treatment. Results illustrate that the as-obtained Ta2O5 nanoparticles present superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency compared with primitive Ta2O5 nanoparticles, and the magnitude of enhanced optical performance varies with oxygen deficiency content. It is likely that the introduction of oxygen defects in Ta2O5 forms a defect energy level between valence band and conduction band, broadening the optical absorption spectrum and reducing the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, which leads to the enhance of photocatalytic activity."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Ta2O5 (AR), H2PtCI6·6H2O (99.5%), benzyl alcohol (AR) and TaCl5 (AR) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd and directly used. Deionized water was used in the whole procession of the experiment."
3,Synthesis of Ta2O5 samples,"2.2 Synthesis of Ta2O5 samples 0.244 g of TaCl5 powder was dispersed in 24.5 mL of benzyl alcohol in a 50 mL open beaker. The homogeneous mixture was subsequently transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave after homogeneous dispersion of ultrasonic treatment for 20 min and mixing processing for 30 min. The autoclave was kept at 220 °C for 72 h in an oven and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The white precipitate was observed at the bottom of the autoclave and was separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 4 min. The obtained precipitate was washed several times by deionized water and ethyl alcohol. After drying at 60 °C, the powder production was collected for further use."
4,Fabrication of oxygen-deficient Ta2O5 samples,"2.3 Fabrication of oxygen-deficient Ta2O5 samples 0.25 g of as-prepared Ta2O5 powder was calcined at 350, 400 and 450 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in an atmosphere of continuously flowing Ar, respectively. The resultant samples annealed at 350, 400, 450 °C were denoted as Ta2O5-350, Ta2O5-400, Ta2O5-450, respectively. The sample without annealing was recorded as Ta2O5."
5,Loading cocatalysts,"2.4 Loading cocatalysts 0.15 g of as-prepared sample was dispersed in 2 mL H2PtCI6·6H2O aqueous solution (Concentration: 0.6 mg mL−1) with ultrasonication for 5 min and then dried in a water bath at 80 °C. The dried sample was ground into uniform powder. Then the powder was annealed in a tube furnace at 350 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a mixed atmosphere of 95% argon and 5% H2. The resultant product was supported with platinum-assisted catalyst. The Ta2O5-400, Ta2O5-450, Ta2O5 samples were treated under the same condition as before in order to be supported with platinum-assisted catalyst. For comparison, Pt also deposited on commercial Ta2O5 under the same condition."
6,Photocatalytic activity measurement,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity measurement The photocatalytic H2 production test was performed in an airtight gas circulation system Labsolar with an external 300 W Xenon lamp source. In detail, 50 mg of photocatalyst was added into a clean external-irradiation photoreactor and 50 mL Na2SO3 (0.25 M) and Na2S (0.35 M) mixed aqueous solution were added. Then the mixture was ultrasonic for 5 min. The reactor was then sealed with vacuum grease, sealing ring and transparent quartz cover, and fixed with Labsolar in order to circulate the gas produced by the reaction inside. The solution inside the reactor was constantly stirred at 10 °C and irradiated by an external 300 W xenon lamp source. The whole test lasted for 5 h. The gas chromatograph was used to detect the amount of H2 produced from the reactor."
7,Characterizations,"2.6 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2550 X-ray diffractometer, Rigaku Corporation) was performed with Cu Kα radiation from a scan angle of double theta of 10–80° in order to investigate the crystallinity and crystalline phases of the samples. The morphology of the samples was collected using transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Helios NanoLab G3 UC, FEI). The element states of the samples were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-ALPHA, Thermo Fisher). The ultraviolet and visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS) ranging from 200 to 1100 nm were obtained by a Thermo Fisher Evolution 220 spectrophotometer. The spectra of electron spin resonance (ESR) were obtained by a ESR spectrometer (EMXmicro-6/1/P/L, Karlsruhe, Germany). All the testing experiments were operated at ambient temperature."
8,Results and discussion,"The surface composition for all samples was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It can be seen from Fig. 1 a that the well-defined peaks located at binding energy of 27.61 and 25.78 eV can be respectively assigned to Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 [28], which indicates that Ta (V) is the dominant oxidation state of the Ta2O5 sample [29]. While comparing binding energy of calcined Ta2O5 samples, Ta 4f peaks shift toward higher energy as observed in sequence of Ta2O5-400, Ta2O5-450 and Ta2O5-350, indicating a decreased content of oxygen deficiency successively [30]. Fig. 1b exhibits the high-resolution O 1s spectra of Ta2O5. Wherein, the O 1s peak in these samples can be devided into two peaks, the binding energy at 530.12 eV corresponds to the Ta–O species while the other at 531.81 eV is ascribed to oxygen defects in the matrix of Ta2O5 [31]. The O defect peak of Ta2O5-400 shifts towards lower binding energy in comparison to that of Ta2O5-350 and Ta2O5-450, which signifies the content of oxygen deficient increasing. Moreover, the high energy component proportion of Ta2O5-400 seems higher than that of Ta2O5-350 and Ta2O5-450, confirming the increasing ratio of oxygen deficiency [30]. The micro-morphological characteristics of Ta2O5, Ta2O5-350, Ta2O5-400 and Ta2O5-450 are revealed by scanning electron microscopy, as shown in Fig. 2 . As depicted in the SEM pictures, the pristine Ta2O5 sample appears as small particles of irregular shape with a size of about several nanometers, which proves that Ta2O5 nanoparticles have been successfully prepared (Fig. 2a). The agglomeration of Ta2O5 appears with the annealing temperature increasing. There is no obvious crystal outline observed in Fig. 2b, c and d, indicating that the annealing temperature is too mild to crystalize Ta2O5 nanoparticles, thus presenting amorphous state. The XRD pattern (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1) also manifests the amorphous state for all samples, while only two weak broad peaks are observed at around 25° and 55° [32]. Fig. 2e and g presenting the TEM images of Ta2O5 and Ta2O5-400, confirm that the samples are several nanometers with agglomerations, which is consistent with SEM images. The high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 2f and h) further verify that both the two samples are composed of nano-particles with the diameter at several nanometers. Moreover, few lattice fringes can be observed in both samples, indicating the formation of few crystalline nuclei in the amorphous matrix, which may result from the sample suffering high-energy electron beam in the TEM chamber in high speed. The hydrogen production amounts of Ta2O5 samples were measured for 5 h under simulated sunlight irradiation, and that of commercial Ta2O5 was also tested for comparison, as shown in Fig. 3 a. The hydrogen production rates of Ta2O5, Ta2O5-350, Ta2O5-400 and Ta2O5-450 are evaluated to be 2.95, 4.77, 10.67 and 3.14 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. In addition, the hydrogen production rate of commercial Ta2O5 is 3.82 μmol g−1 h−1. From Fig. 3b, it can be seen that the hydrogen production rate of Ta2O5-450 samples is similar to that of pristine samples, both at a relatively low level, and even slightly lower than that of commercial Ta2O5. The hydrogen production performance of Ta2O5-350 and Ta2O5-400 samples is obviously improved, especially the Ta2O5-400 samples, which shows the optimal hydrogen production performance. The result elucidates that just the right amount of oxygen defects in the Ta2O5 sample can be used as a sunlight active carrier of rapid migration channel to reduce recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs as well as improve the mobility of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the annealing treatment at higher temperature may cause excessive oxygen defects in the samples, and some oxygen defects instead become the recombination center of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, making the Ta2O5-450 sample exhibit sluggish hydrogen production performance. To expound the superiority of Ta2O5-400, optical performance and electrochemical properties of four Ta2O5 samples with different treatment are measured and compared. Generally, the shape of the electrochemical impedance spectrum is a semicircle, and the diameter of the semicircle can directly reveal the charge transfer resistance, so the electron conduction efficiency can be qualitatively analyzed by the impedance line [33]. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the diameter of the semicircle of Ta2O5-400 is the smallest, suggesting the obvious strengthened interfacial charge transport on the surface of Ta2O5-400. The pristine Ta2O5 sample with the largest diameter exhibits correspondingly the largest charge transfer resistance. Electron migration efficiency is generally inversely related to equivalent resistance. This is exactly in line with the results of the previous photocatalytic hydrogen production tests. The photocurrent density can directly elucidate the separation property of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. As depicted in Fig. 4b, pristine Ta2O5 samples obviously exhibit the lowest photocurrent intensity, whose average photocurrent is about 1.2 × 10−8 A cm2. As expected, the photocurrent responses of the annealing Ta2O5 samples are optimized in comparison to pristine Ta2O5, especially Ta2O5-400, the average photocurrent of which reaches about 1.65 × 10−8 A cm2, owing to the oxygen defect structure generated by annealing at high temperature. It demonstrates that the appearance of oxygen defects promotes the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. As can be depicted from Fig. 4c, all of the samples exhibit a characteristic absorption band in the strong ultraviolet range and a second absorption band in the visible range. The pristine Ta2O5 exhibits very low light absorption in the near-ultraviolet and visible-light segments in the range of 310 nm–800 nm, while the light absorption rate of the annealing Ta2O5 in this band is significantly improved, among which the Ta2O5-450 sample has the highest light absorption rate and exhibits a very high light absorption rate in the near-ultraviolet and visible-light segments. Ta2O5-400 sample has the second light absorption rate. Wei D. Lu and Emmanouil Kioupakis et al. used first-principles computational methods based on hybrid density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties of oxygen defects in amorphous Ta2O5, and the results indicated that experimentally observed but as-yet unidentified defect states in Ta2O5 can be attributed to neutral oxygen vacancies [34]. The electron spin resonance (ESR) was performed to further confirm the presence of oxygen vacancy for calcined Ta2O5. For comparison, we selected Ta2O5-400 and pristine Ta2O5 for ESR testing, as shown in Fig. 4d. It presents a resonance at g = 1.94 in the spectrum of Ta2O5-400, which is attributed to oxygen vacancies [35]. Meanwhile, there is no resonance signal detected for pristine Ta2O5, signifying that few oxygen vacancies exists in pristine Ta2O5. Therefore, the oxygen defects in Ta2O5 is believed to be oxygen vacancy. In Fig. S2, the slope of the longest straight-line portion of the Mott-Schottky curve for the pristine Ta2O5 sample, Ta2O5-350, Ta2O5-400 and Ta2O5-450 samples is positive, so all the four samples are n-type semiconductors. The longest straight-line portion of the MS curve extends to intersect the abscissa axis, unveiling that the flat-band potentials Vfb of the pristine Ta2O5 sample, Ta2O5-350, Ta2O5-400, and Ta2O5-450 samples are −0.54 eV, −0.45 eV, −0.41 eV and −0.64 eV. It is evident that the flat band potential of Ta2O5 nanoparticles slightly shifts to the positive direction when introducing a certain amount of oxygen defects."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, amorphous Ta2O5 nanoparticles modified by oxygen-defect structure is successfully manufactured by annealing solvothermal-prepared Ta2O5 at different high temperature in Ar atmosphere. The hydrogen evolution rate of modified Ta2O5 nanoparticles annealed at 350, 400 and 450 °C turn out to be 1.62, 3.62 and 1.06 times higher than that of the primitive Ta2O5 nanoparticles. Therein, the highest hydrogen evolution rate is 10.67 μmol g−1 h−1 of Ta2O5-400. The improvement of photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the presence of oxygen defects forming a defect energy level between valence band and conduction band, which broadens the optical absorption spectrum and promotes the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers."
