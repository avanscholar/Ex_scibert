0,Introduction,"Due to the fast depletion of fossil resource and great demand of chemicals, biomass is expected to become an increasingly important feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals [1]. In particular, the inedible lignocellulose is an important renewable alternative, because it can provide furanic aldehydes (furfural or 5-hydroxymethyl furfural) after chemical conversions [2,3]. Furanic aldehydes are considered as the prospective platform compounds, and can be converted into some products such as furfuryl alcohol, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan, cyclopentanone, 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone and so on. [4–6] Among them, cyclopentanone compounds (cyclopentanone or 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone) contain a five-membered ring and carbonyl group. A multifunctional chemical intermediate has been widely utilized as a raw material to produce pharmaceuticals, insecticides, rubber and high-density fuel [7]. Conventionally, the production of cyclopentanone is mainly based on cyclization of petroleum-derived adipic acid or adipic esters, and there is no industrial synthesis path of the 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone. Recently, to provide an alternative path and extend the utilization of biomass, the production of cyclopentanone compounds from furanic aldehydes has attracted a wide attention. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of furanic aldehydes to cyclopentanone compounds can be catalyzed by the supported noble or non-noble metals bifunctional catalysts under hydrogenation conditions. In the transformation process, furanic aldehydes can be transformed to cyclopentanone compounds through several CO hydrogenation, furan ring hydrolysis, CC hydrogenation, intramolecular aldol condensation and dehydration reactions [8]. Although some efforts have been devoted to developing active non-noble metals for hydrogenation steps, efficient catalyst acid supports for hydrolysis, intramolecular aldol condensation, and dehydration steps still need to be studied [9–12]. For example, carbon supported Pt, Ru, Pd-Cu and Ni catalysts have been found to be successful to catalyze the reaction of furfural [10,13–15]. However, the reaction condition is comparatively severe (160–190 °C), since the hydrolysis is hardly occurred with a weak acidic support [15]. Subsequently, some acidic metal oxides (such as TiO2, Co3O4, Al2O3 and ZrO2) and acidic molecular sieves (such as HY, HZSM-5 and SBA-15) have been used as the support [9,11,10–12,16–18]. Whereas, a support with strong acidity (such as Ta2O5 and Nb2O5) is needed for the 5-hydroxymethyl furfural reaction, since the hydrogenation intermediate 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan has a electron withdrawing hydroxymethyl group and is hard to hydrolyze [19–21]. Unfortunately, the synthesis efficiency is always unsatisfactory, because a large amount of low-value humins are generated catalyzed by this kind of catalysts. It is found that Lewis acid has a crucial effect in the reaction by promoting the hydrolysis and intramolecular aldol condensation steps, whereas Brønsted acid easily promotes the intermolecular CC reaction of intermediates, leading to the production of humins [22]. The catalytic performance of these traditional supports can be ascribed to the low density of Lewis acid sites and the existence of Brønsted acid sites. Hence, developing a suitable support for the bifunctional catalyst is the key for highly efficient synthesis of cyclopentanone compounds. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with modular assembly structure, high surface area, tailorable pore and structural versatility show a good application potential in the fields of gas storage, separation, catalysis, sensing, drug delivery and proton conductivity [23–28]. In particular, MIL-series MOFs with carboxylic-acid-based ligands, show a promise for the future application owing to their greater chemical variety, better chemical stability and larger pore size [29–31]. These MOF materials have been widely reported as heterogeneous catalysts on the basis of Lewis acid sites, which are offered by unsaturated metal centers [32]. Moreover, the tuned cages or channels allow them to host or support metal nanoparticles as an bifunctional catalyst by changing the organic linkers. In fact, the stable and pure Lewis acid catalyst (Ru/Cr-MIL-101) has a considerable yield in the furfural reaction. However, it cannot convert 5-hydroxymethyl furfural to 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone, since the acidity of the unsaturated coordination of Cr3+ in the MOF is weak and it cannot induce the hydrolysis of furan ring [33]. According to previous reports, the activity of MOF is usually tuned by the metal oxophilicity in many reactions involving oxygen-containing compounds [34–36]. For example, Fe-based MOF with higher metal oxophilicity always have a higher activity than Cr-based MOF, although their topology structures are same. Meanwhile, the effect of noble metal types on the selectivity for the hydrogenation ring-arrangement reactions have not been systematically explored. Therefore, a series of noble metals (Pt, Ru, Pd and Au) supported on MIL series MOF with metal and topology structure are synthesized via the impregnation method in this study. The role of noble metal types as well as supports has been investigated respectively, and the reaction conditions have been optimized. Attributed to the smaller particle size of Pd and higher oxophilicity of Fe3+, the conversion rate of furfural and selectivity of cyclopentanone over Pd/Fe-MIL-100 are higher than 99.0% and 93.1%, respectively. Moreover, it also has a high activity for the conversion of 5-hydromethyl furfural, and the yield of 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone is 85.4%. M/MIL-MOF is very stable and performs steady with a little decrease in the yield after 5 runs. It seems that the catalysis by MOFs will represent a promising route for the bifunctional catalysis including the step of Lewis acid catalysis."

All chemicals were used without further purification. Cr-MIL-101 was synthesized according to our previous study [7]."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts Fe-MIL-101 and Fe-MIL-100 were prepared by following the previously reported procedures [36,37]. For the synthesis of MIL-101, FeCl3·6H2O (2.45 mmol) and H2BDC (1.24 mmol) were dissolved in 30 ml DMF and heated at 110 °C for 20 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The resulting brown solid was firstly filtered off and purified by using DMF, ethanol and water, then dried overnight at 150 °C. For the synthesis of Fe-MIL-100, iron powder (4.9 mmol), H3BTC (3.27 mmol), hydrofluoric acid (4 mmol) and nitric acid (2.78 mmol) were mixed in water (20 ml), and heated for 12 h at 150 °C. The synthesized Fe-MIL-100 was further purified with water and ethanol, then dried overnight in a 100 °C vacuum drying oven. M/MOF (M = Ru, Pt, Pd, Au) catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. Typically, 1 g MIL-MOFS and 0.084 g PdCl2/ 0.103 g RuCl3/ 0.133 g H2PtCl6·6H2O/ 0.1 g HAuCl4·3H2O (the noble metal loading is 5 wt%) were added to 10 mL water. The mixture was stirred for 2 h, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7, then 0.5 g of NaBH4 was added. The stirring was continued for 30 min. The resultant solid catalyst was filtered and dried in an oven at 100 °C. Before catalytic reaction, all MOF catalysts were activated in vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h."
4,Catalyst characterizations,"2.3 Catalyst characterizations The crystal structures were characterized with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. X-Ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) data were gained by an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al anode X-ray gun. The pore textural properties were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption at −196 °C on an ASAP 2046 surface analyzer. The specific surface area and mesopore size distribution were calculated by the BET and DFT methods, respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra was recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on a Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer using KBr pellets. Elemental analysis was carried out using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry on a PerkinElmer Optima 8000 spectrometer. The microstructure was obtained by a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope. The thermal stabilities were analyzed by TGA measurements on a NETZSCH-STA 2500 in N2 atmosphere. Acid properties were analyzed by the infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine using a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer. For the IR analysis, self-supported wafers (10 mg/cm2) were degassed for 1 h under vacuum at 200 °C, then the adsorption of pyridine proceeded at 60 °C for 30 min. followed by desorption at 100 °C and 200 °C for 20 min, and the transmission spectra were recorded."
5,Catalytic reactions,"2.4 Catalytic reactions In a typical experimental run, a mixture of furanic aldehydes (10.4 mmol), water (40 mL) and 0.1 g catalyst was stirred in a 100 mL batch autoclave (Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., LTD), then reacted under a specific temperature and H2 pressure. The mixture was periodically sampled and a certain amount of N,N-dimethyl formamide was added as an internal standard substance. Then, the products were extracted by ethyl acetate. The compositions were identified by an Agilent 6890 N GC/5973 MS detector and determined by Trace 1300 gas chromatograph equipped with FID detector and a TG-WAXMS capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The reported data were the mean values of three trials with small error bars."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural characteristics of M/MIL-MOFS,"3.1 Structural characteristics of M/MIL-MOFS ICP analysis results show the content of noble metal in M/MIL-MOFS is consistent with the added content of noble metal precursor under the synthesis condition. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of M/MIL-MOFS. The characteristic peaks attributed to the MIL-MOFS are all in accordance with the reported data in the literature, confirming that the successful formation of MIL series MOF [36–38]. Cr-MIL-101 and Fe-MIL-101 have the same diffraction patterns, whereas Fe-MIL-100 has a different one, indicating the space topology structure is not related to types of metal ions, but to the ligand. Meanwhile, after the incorporation of noble metal nanoparticles, the XRD pattern is matched well with both of noble metal nanoparticles and MOF. The diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 38.6°, 44.0° are assigned to the (100), (101) planes of the standard card of Ru. The peaks at 39.7°, 46.2° are attributed to the (111), (200) planes of Pt. The characteristic peaks of Pd (111), (200) planes are observed at 2θ = 40.1°, 46.6° and the Au (111), (200) planes are located at 2θ = 38.5°, 44.8°. The integrity of the characteristic peaks of MIL-MOFs is retained and it is not affected by the introduction of metal nanoparticles [39–43]. As shown in Figure S1, the deconvolution of high resolution Ru 3p XPS spectrum of the Ru/Fe-MIL-100 sample gives a distinctive peak at 463.6 and 485.7 eV that can readily be assigned to Ru(0). The peak observed at 468 eV reveals the presence of Ru(IV) oxidation state on the metal surface. For Pt/Fe-MIL-100, the stronger peaks at 71.1 eV and 74.6 eV for Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 are belonged to metallic Pt(0). The other doublet at 72.3 eV and 75.8 eV could be assigned to Pt(II). The binding energy peaks appear at 334.9 eV and 341 eV for Pd/MIL-MOFs, these peaks should be attributed to Pd(0). In addition, two binding energy peaks at 338.5 eV and 344 eV are ascribed to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of Pd(II). There are kinds peaks of Au species which could be identified, Au(0) (84 eV, 87.7 eV) and Au(I) (86 eV, 88.8 eV) [39–42]. Besides Pd, the amount of oxidation states of other noble metals (Ru, Pt, Au) is very low. Although Pd particles have a large proportion of Pd(II), it is easily reduced to Pd(0) under subsequent reaction conditions (150 °C, 4 MPa H2) [14]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of MIL-MOFs and M/MIL-MOFs are identified, which have the type IV isotherm and can be used to prove their mesoporous structures (Fig. 2 A and B). The BET surface areas of Fe-MIL-101 and Cr-MIL-101 are 1708 and 3226 m2/g, respectively. The pore-size distribution centers at 1.17, 1.48, 2.16 and 2.73 nm in Fig. 2C should be corresponding to the two types of windows and cages of MIL-101. But Fe-MIL-100 has a more compacted structure with BET surface areas of 841 m2/g, and a smaller pore size distributed in 1.72 and 2.16 nm. It should be corresponding to the two smaller topological cages of Fe-MIL-100 (Fig. 2D) [7]. After the introduction of nanoparticles, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size are substantially reduced for all samples. It is worth mentioning that the volume of same cage and large cage (cage void) of all samples decrease equally with an increase in the introduced amount of nanoparticles, indicating nanoparticles are evenly encapsulated in two types of cages (Table 1 ). TEM images and the particle size distributions of the M/Fe-MIL-100 (M = Ru, Pt, Pd, Au) are shown in Fig. 3 . It clearly manifests that the noble metals clusters are uniformly dispersed in the void cage of MOF. Meanwhile, the noble nanoparticles possess basic sizes with an average of 5–8 nm on the external surface of MOF. Pyridine-adsorbed FTIR spectra were widely used to probe the acid sites (Fig. S2). Generally, the wavenumber range in the 1400-1650 cm−1 allow to determine the Lewis acid strength. However, it is not accessible in the case of MILs-MOF due to the very strong bands due to carboxylate and ring vibrations. Some adsorption peaks are observed at 1015, 1044, and 1071 cm-1, which are assigned to the ν 1, ν 12 and ν 18a modes of the pyridine chemisorbed on Lewis acid sites of MOF [44,45]. Notably, the area of these peaks is large for the sample treated at 100 °C (Fig. 4 ). However, at higher adsorption temperature (200 °C), the signal of Fe-based catalysts is higher than that of Cr-based, showing a stronger Lewis acidity of coordinated unsaturated Fe3+. As shown in Figure S3, the thermal stability data of the Fe-MIL-100 and Fe-MIL-101 shows the weight loss below 200 °C can be attributed to the removal of crystal and non-crystal water. Subsequently, the significant weight loss of Fe-MIL-100 and Fe-MIL-101 are observed from 300 to 500 °C owing to the decomposition of ligands. The MOF catalysts retain their structure at 300 °C, indicating that they have a great stability under the hydrogenative ring-rearrangement reaction conditions."
8,Hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of furfural to cyclopentanone,"3.2 Hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of furfural to cyclopentanone As aforementioned, furfural (FFA) is sequentially converted to furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2-pentene-1,4-dione (PED), 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone (HCPEO), 3-hydroxycyclopentanone (HCPO) and cyclopentanone (CPO) via hydrogenation, hydrolysis, intramolecular aldol condensation, dehydration and hydrogenation reactions. These products were identified by GC–MS (Fig. S4 A–D). Beside these compounds, these reactions can generate some by-products including tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and humins through furan ring hydrogenation and intermolecular CC reactions, respectively (Fig. 4A). Figures S5 compares the concentration of reactants, intermediates and products with reaction time over Pd/Cr-MIL-101, Pd/Fe-MIL-101 and Pd/Fe-MIL-100 under the same reaction condition. Over all catalysts, the concentration of HCPEO and HCPO, PED are difficult to be detected, indicating the dehydration and hydrogenation occurr very quickly. A large amount of FFA and FA indicates the CO hydrogenation and hydrolysis reactions are the controllable steps. Different from previous studies on supports including BrØnsted acid, all samples with pure Lewis acid MOF show a lower than 2.0% selectivity for humins [15–21]. Although Pd/Fe-MIL-100 has the lowest surface area, it has three advantages on activity and selectivity compared with Pd/Fe-MIL-101 and Pd/Cr-MIL-101. Firstly, it shows 99% conversion of FFA after 6 h, which is higher than those over Pd/Fe-MIL-101 (63.0%) and Pd/Cr-MIL-101 (60.5%). Secondly, the hydrolysis ability for FFA is strong and the selectivity of CPO is 93.1% after 6 h, which is quite higher than that of Pd/Cr-MIL-101 (71.2%). Thirdly, the formation of THFA is completely inhibited with a selectivity of 1.7% due to a low concentration of intermediate FFA. As a result, Pd/Fe-MIL-100 shows the highest yield of 92.2% for CPO (Fig. 5 ). To further elaborate the excellent performance of Pd/MIL-100, kinetic studies on the hydrogenation step of FFA and hydrolysis step of FA are carried out. It is found that the plot of ln(C/C0) of FFA vs. time is a straight line, which reveals the hydrogenation step of FFA is followed by the quasi first-order kinetics (Fig. 4B). The kinetic parameters over Pd/Fe-MIL-100 are obviously higher than those over Pd/Fe-MIL-101 and Pd/Cr-MIL-101. Because a more compacted structure of MOF will promote the introduction of smaller Pd nanoparticles, which will enable the accessibility of FFA to the hydrogenation active sites. For the hydrolysis study, the reaction is conducted without hydrogen in order to eliminate the influence of furan ring hydrogenation. Fe-MIL-101 and Pd/Fe-MIL-101 has the higher kinetic parameters than Fe-MIL-100 and Pd/Fe-MIL-100, since their larger surface area can increase the accessibility of acid sites to FA. Whereas Cr-MIL-101 and Pd/Cr-MIL-101 have a weak hydrolysis performance, because the unsaturated Cr3+ has a weaker oxophilicity than Fe3+ (Fig. 4C). The acid site adsorbing the oxygen atom is the key step for the hydrolysis of furan alcohol and a better oxophilicity acid site will be benefit for this step. These results clearly demonstrate that the excellent catalytic efficiency of Pd/MIL-100 can be ascribed to the highest hydrogenation activity and the considerable hydrolysis activity. Subsequently, several other noble metals (Ru, Pt, Pd and Au) supported on Fe-MIL-100 are investigated. As the widely recognized effectiveness of these metals in hydrogenation reactions, Ru, Pt, Pd catalysts possess a high conversion of 97.8%, 98.1%, and 99.0% for FFA, respectively, which are all higher than the conversion of 91.3% over Au catalyst (as shown in Fig. 5) [46]. However, it is interesting to find that the Ru/Fe-MIL-100 and Pt/Fe-MIL-100 only show a small selectivity for CPO (36.2% and 20.1%) and a large amount of intermediates FA (61.8% and 73.9%), despite that their specific surface areas are much larger than that of Pd/Fe-MIL-100 and Au/Fe-MIL-100 (Fig. 2D). The hydrolysis step of FA kinetic studies indicate that the introduction of nanoparticles will decrease the activity of Fe-MIL-100. Because the solvent is water and the interaction of water with noble metals may affect the hydrolysis activity. In previous report, it is found that the adsorption energy of water on noble metals are in the orders of Rh > Ru > Pt > Pd > Au [47], which is consistent with the results of hydrolysis reaction in this study. The adsorption on noble metals may restrain water react with FA on the Lewis acid site and reduce the hydrolysis activity. The results show that Pd/Fe-MIL-100 has a high hydrogenation and considerable hydrolysis activity, which indicates that it has the best comprehensive performance. At last, the reaction conditions such as the loading amount of Pd, reaction temperature and H2 pressure are optimized. The activity is increased with the amount of Pd active sites, however, when the loading amount of Pd is further increased to 6 wt%, it will incur the hydrogenation of furan ring. Thus, the 5 wt%Pd/Fe-MIL-100 sample shows the highest catalytic yield of CPO (Figure S6). When the reaction temperature is decreased to 130 °C, only 30% of FFA is transformed, while the main product is FA and no CPO is detected. However, when the reaction temperature is higher than 160 °C, the yield of CPO begins to decrease, and some products and derivatives of intermolecular aldol condensation reaction of CPO are generated at high temperatures [7,8]. (Fig. S7) An increase in H2 pressure can lead to an enhancement in FFA conversion. However, a higher selectivity to over-hydrogenated THFA is observed at H2 pressures over 4.0 MPa (Fig. S8)."
9,Hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural to 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone,"3.3 Hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural to 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone Similar to furfural, hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) is considered to proceed through CO hydrogenation, hydrolysis, CC hydrogenation, intramolecular aldol condensation, dehydration and CC hydrogenation reactions (Fig. 6 A Fig. S4 E–H). The product distribution is also measured in the HMF hydrogenative ring-rearrangement reaction using Pd/Fe-MIL-100 as a catalyst (Fig. 6B). 1-Hydroxy-3-hexene-2,5-dione (HHED) and 4-hydroxy-4-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclopentanone (HHCPN) are not detected, indicating that the reaction steps are very fast. Compared with the furfural conversion, it is notable that more than 20.8% yield of 1-hydroxyl-2,5-hexanedione (HHD) is detected after 12 h, since the hydroxymethyl group can transfer electron to the carbonyl group. It will decrease the positive charge carbocation from HHD and reduce the reactivity of intramolecular aldol condensation reaction [48]. Fig. S9 compares the time-dependent product distribution of Pd/Cr-MIL-101, Pd/Fe-MIL-101 and Pd/Fe-MIL-100. Pd supported on Cr-MIL-101 and Fe-MIL-101 have a lower activity than that of Fe-MIL-100 based on its low dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. More importantly, Cr-MIL-101 cannot convert the hydrolysis of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHF), and a large amount of hydrogenation product 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (THBHF) is generated. Conversely, Fe-MIL-100 and Fe-MIL-101 with a strong oxophilicity show a high hydrolysis activity. The BHF is rapid consumed and the amount of byproduct THBHF is decreased. All noble metals (Ru, Pt, Pd and Au) supported on Fe-MIL-100 show a high activity on the hydrogenation reactions with above 80% conversion of HMF after 12 h. Meanwhile, due to the weak hydrolysis activity of Ru and Pt catalyst, about 30% yield of BHF is maintained, and above 5% yield of hydrogenation by-product THBHF is generated. While Pd and Au catalysts can completely prevent the side reaction, and they have high hydrolysis performance with selectivity of HCPN higher than 60%. At last, the yields of HHD and HCPN can increase to 20.2% and 75.6% after reacting 12 h, respectively. For a prolong reaction time to 24 h, the conversion over Pd/Fe-MIL-100 is 99.9% with the 85.5% selectivity for HCPN."
10,Catalyst stability and recycling,"3.4 Catalyst stability and recycling A rapid, hot-catalyst filtration test is performed (Figure S10). After the removal of Pd/Fe-MIL-100, no further conversion of FFA and FA in the filtrate demonstrates the true heterogeneous catalysis and suggests the stability of noble particles and MOF, respectively. Meanwhile, the recycling of Pd/Fe-MIL-100 is further evaluated in the hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of furfural. The catalyst is centrifuged after the reaction, washed with water, and then used for the next run. As shown in Fig. 7 , after 5 runs, the conversion and selectivity are maintained above 90% in the five runs, no significant decrease is found in conversion yield as compared to the first reaction run. The XRD, FTIR and N2 adsorption results of the used catalysts suggest the structure of the used catalysts basically be remained and has not change after five reaction runs (Figure S11, S12, S13). TEM and ICP analysis results show the stable chemical composition and no further agglomeration of Pd (Figure S14, Table S1). There is a great proof that Pd/Fe-MIL-100 can be used as a stable catalyst under the present reaction conditions."
11,Conclusions,"Noble metal nanoparticles have been uniformly supported on MIL-MOFs with different spatial configurations and different MOF coordination metals. Among the supports and noble metal discussed in this work, the Pd/Fe-MIL-100 catalyst with a higher oxophilicity and small nanoparticles dispersion shows the high activity of hydrogenation of furanic aldehydes and hydrolysis of furan ring steps. Moreover, the reaction conditions are optimized. As a result, a complete conversion of FFA and 92.2% yield of cyclopentanone is obtained at 150 °C and after 6 h. Meanwhile, hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural over Pd/Fe-MIL-100, a conversion rate of 99.9%, and a 85.4% selectivity of 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone were achieved at 150 °C and after 24 h. In addition, the catalysts are easily recyclable and without any obvious noble metals leaching and MOF structure degradation. The outcomes in this study can contribute to the development of the biomass-derived cyclopentanone compounds for a sustainable future."
