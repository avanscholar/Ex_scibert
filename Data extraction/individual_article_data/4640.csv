0,Introduction,"Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are smart materials that can change their macroscopic properties such as shape and color with the effect of external stimuli (such as heat, light, magnetic field, electrical field, pH) and return from their temporary shape to their permanent shape when the stimulating effect is eliminated. Shape memory polymers were first identified with a patent issued by L.B.Vernon in 1941 [1]. In his study, it has been reported that methacrylate acid ester resin which is used as an artificial dental material, has an elastic memory. So it can be reinstated by heat treatment. A suitable molecular weight, connection points, and functional groups sensitive to external influence or structures sensitive to external factors are required for shape memory formation in polymers. However, the materials must have an elastic deformation capacity. It is necessary to characterize the limits, capacities, and usage possibilities of the SMPs [2]. In order to achieve the shape memory effect (SME) in shape memory polymers, there are basically two requirements. One of them is that the polymer has a stable mesh structure, and the other is that the polymer has the key points that allow the polymer to change its shape with a certain stimulant and can be restored when the effect is removed. Some factors such as the stable structure of the polymer network, the interaction of macromolecules, physical-chemical crosslink type, ratio, density determine the original shape of the polymer. The key points in the polymer structure enable the reversible shape change to occur, that is, the formation of the temporary shape. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , this process can happen with different mechanisms. Stimulating factors such as moisture, water/solvent, ion interaction, pressure, light, pH exchange are used to achieve these effects [3]. The main advantage of shape memory polymers is that they are light and inexpensive. However, compared to shape memory alloys and shape memory ceramics, SMPs have unique properties such as low density, easy to produce, high biodegradability and easily adaptable glass transition temperature. For this reason, there have been studies on the shape memory of polymers since the 1980s and an increase in research has been observed in the last few years [4]. While the elongation and shape memory is quite good in the SMP, the tension and load memory is low. That is, under the same elongation effect, the maximum tension in the stress-strain graph decreases at the end of each cycle. In order to overcome such disadvantages, shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) are produced. Special characteristic features such as high toughness and high impact resistance are provided to the polymer by adding fillers. In addition to SMPCs, SMPs that can take different shapes with different functions, electroactive SMPs, self-healing SMPs, SMP foams are among the recently developed structures. Today, applications such as biomedical, aviation, textile, automotive, spacecraft, and submarine are among the main applications of SMP and SMPC [5,6]. In this study, nanocomposite materials with poly (vinyl alcohol) matrix were produced using rGO and GO fillers, each in two different ratios (PVA/GO=100/0.01, 100/0.02; PVA/rGO=100/0.01, 100/0.02). The thermal, structural, chemical characterization, and surface morphology of the synthesized shape memory nanocomposites were investigated. In addition, the shape memory properties of the materials were examined by the bending test."
1,Material and method,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Graphite powder, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) for GO synthesis by Hummers method; Hydrazine hydrate for rGO synthesis produced by reduction of graphene oxide; PVA powder and glutaraldehyde for polymer production were obtained from Merck firm."
3,Synthesis of Shape Memory Poly (Vinyl Alcohol) Polymer,"2.2 Synthesis of Shape Memory Poly (Vinyl Alcohol) Polymer For the synthesis of the shape memory poly (vinyl alcohol) polymer, 8 g of poly (vinyl alcohol) powder and 92 ml of deionized water (DiH2O) were added to the beaker and mixed for 4 hours in a magnetic stirrer at 98°C. The pH of the obtained solution was adjusted to 4 with hydrochloric acid (HCl). Then 1 ml of glutaraldehyde was added to the mixture and mixing was continued for 1 hour. Finally, the obtained PVA solution was poured into Petri dishes and left to dry for 36 hours at room temperature [7]. The image of the synthesized shape memory poly (vinyl alcohol) polymer is given in Fig. 2 ."
4,Synthesis of Graphene Oxide (GO),"2.3 Synthesis of Graphene Oxide (GO) The synthesis of graphene oxide realized by the Hummers method was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, natural (or almost natural) 1 g of graphite powder, 1 g of sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99%) and 48 ml of 98% concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were added to the beaker in the ice bath and were mixed for 1 hour in a magnetic stirrer. 6 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was added to this mixture, gradually. The mixture was mixed for 90 minutes in the ice bath first and then for 2 hours at 35°C in the water bath. In the second stage of the synthesis process, 40 ml of deionized water was added dropwise to the mixture. In this way, the mixture was left in the magnetic stirrer for 1 more hour. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%): deionized water solution (1:10) was added to the mixture. The obtained mixture was stirred for 90 minutes after the temperature was raised to 90°C. At this time, the color of the mixture was observed to change from brown to yellow. Then the mixture was centrifuged and filtered. The filtration process continued with hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%): deionized water solution (1:10) until pH = 7. The material synthesized after this process was dried in an oven at 50°C for 48 hours [8]. The image of the obtained GO material is given in Fig. 3 ."
5,Synthesis of Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO),"2.4 Synthesis of Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) In rGO synthesis, 0.01 g of the graphene oxide nanomaterial produced by the Hummers method and 1 ml of hydrazine hydrate (H6N2O) chemical were mixed in a magnetic stirrer for 1 hour. The mixing was done at room temperature. The resulting solution was dried in the oven for 48 hours at 50°C. The image of the obtained rGO material after these processes is given in Fig. 4 ."
6,Synthesis of Shape Memory Nanocomposites,"2.5 Synthesis of Shape Memory Nanocomposites For the production of nanocomposite materials with shape memory feature, GO synthesized by the Hummers method was added to the prepared PVA solution (100 ml) in two different amounts (0.01 and 0.02 g). The resulting mixture was stirred in an ultrasonic mixer for 1 hour. Finally, the obtained homogeneous mixture was left at room temperature for 48 hours to dry. The same processes were also carried out for the production of rGO-added nanocomposite materials. The images of synthesized nanocomposite materials after this process are given in Fig. 5 ."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Thermal Analysis (DSC, TGA)","3.1 Thermal Analysis (DSC, TGA) Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) is one of the techniques commonly used in thermal analysis. With DSC measurement, properties of materials such as heat capacities, phase change, thermal expansion, oxidation, glass transition temperatures, thermal stability can be determined. Glass transition temperature (Tg) is an important feature for all polymers as it determines the mechanical behavior of the material. In the DSC analysis, the sudden increase in heat capacity occurring in the heat exchange curve reveals the glass transition temperature (Tg). The glass transition temperature is a second-degree transition and there is no enthalpy related to the transition [9]. DSC analysis was performed at 25-280°C temperature range and a heating rate of 10°C/min by taking the amounts of materials given in Table 1 . Thermal parameters (Tg, Tm, and ΔHm) of shape memory materials were obtained using the DSC-60A model, Shimadzu brand differential scanning calorimeter, and were recorded in Table 1. The obtained DSC curves are given in Fig. 6 . As the GO nanomaterial was included in the PVA matrix, the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased from 81.10°C to 106.50°C. With the addition of the rGO nanomaterial, this value increased up to 101.15°C. The limitation of the mobility of PVA chains with rGO and GO layers is thought to cause this value to increase. Therefore, it can be said that a strong interface interaction occurs between the rGO/GO nanomaterials and the PVA matrix [10]. In PVA/GO and PVA/rGO nanocomposites, it has been determined that the Tm decreases as the filler concentration increases. The reason why this value is in a decreasing trend is related to the irregular ordering of the PVA chains damaged by the rGO and GO layers [11]. The Shimadzu brand, DTG-60AH model thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) device was used to observe the changes caused by the effect of heat in the produced materials. Thermograms obtained by heating from 25 °C to 500 °C in argon gas environment at 10 °C/min heating rate are given in Fig. 7 . 9-10 mg samples were taken from the produced materials. When TGA thermograms are examined, a three-stage degradation curve is observed for each material. The first mass loss is due to the removal of moisture formed by physically entrapped water molecules in the polymer [12]. Mass loss of 6.26%, 4.97%, 6.75%, 6.31% and 7.32% was experienced in this region for PVA, PVA/GO (100/0.01), PVA/GO (100/0.02), PVA/rGO (100/0.01) and PVA/rGO (100/0.02) materials, respectively. The second and largest mass loss seen in thermogram curves is directly related to the degradation of the PVA structure [13]. In this region where the main and side chains in the PVA structure are separated from each other, a mass loss of 34-50% was observed [14]. Third region mass loss is due to the fragmentation of the PVA main chain [15]. In this region, a mass loss of 30-40% was observed [14]."
9,XRD Analysis,"3.3 XRD Analysis Bruker brand, D8 Advance model X-ray diffractometer device was used to determine the distance between layers and crystallite properties of synthesized nanomaterials and polymeric nanocomposites. The 2θ values of the characteristic peaks belonging to the (001), (100) planes that are in the GO structure, and (101) plane that is in the PVA structure are shown on the graph given in Fig. 8 [16-19]. While the diffraction peak of the (001) plane showed a sharp increase for GO, this value was determined with less density for rGO nanomaterial. The distance between planes of this diffraction peak was calculated as d=0.786 nm for GO and d=0.410 nm for rGO [8]. The fact that this distance between rGO layers is smaller than the distance between GO layers is due to the removal of functional groups such as COOH, CO, OH, H2O in the structure of GO after the reduction process [20,21]. The distance between planes (d) of the characteristic peak of the PVA polymer was determined as 0.454 nm [7]. This value is 0.465, 0.452, 0.460 and 0.448 for PVA/GO (100/0.01), PVA/GO (100/0.02), PVA/rGO (100/0.01) and PVA/rGO (100/0.02) materials, respectively. With the inclusion of GO and rGO nanomaterials in the PVA matrix, it is seen that the characteristic peak of the nanomaterials disappears completely and a single peak is formed. This result implies that the GO and rGO particles are homogeneously distributed in the PVA matrix. The splaying and sharpening of characteristic peaks with the addition of GO and rGO shows that the crystallinity increases [22]. In addition, the crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer formula given in Equation 1 with the data obtained from the XRD analysis of all the produced materials [23]. (1) D = 0.9 λ Bcos θ where D is the crystallite size of the nanocomposite materials, λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation (1.5406 Å), B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) intensity expressed in radians and θ is the diffraction angle. The crystallite size of GO, rGO, PVA, PVA/GO (100/0.01), PVA/GO (100/0.02), PVA/rGO (100/0.01) and PVA/rGO (100/0.02) materials calculated according to Equation 1 are 12.81, 11.57, 6.93, 10.84, 12.40, 8.61 and 11.44 nm, respectively. This result confirms the reason why the peaks in Fig. 8 become splay and sharp as the fillers are added to the PVA matrix."
10,FT-IR Analysis,"3.4 FT-IR Analysis For the chemical characterization of the obtained nanomaterials and nanocomposites and analysis of functional groups in their structures, a Thermo Scientific brand, ID5 ATR model, FT-IR device with sample holder was used. IR spectrums that are given in Fig. 9 were analyzed in the range of 550-4000 cm−1. As mentioned in our previous study, carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, epoxy, and alkoxy functional groups were observed in the FT-IR spectrum of the GO nanomaterial [8]. The peaks at around 1227 cm−1, 1733 cm−1, and 3202 cm−1 wavenumbers seen in the FT-IR spectrum of the GO nanomaterial fell in the spectrum of the rGO nanomaterial and the intensity of these peaks decreased. This result indicates that the density of oxygen-containing functional groups in the structure of the GO nanomaterial is reduced due to the reduction process. However, it was determined that the oxygen-containing groups in the GO structure still exist in the rGO structure. The stretching vibration of the CC bond observed at around 1614 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of rGO is stronger than the peak of GO observed at 1626 cm−1. This indicates that the sp2 cage has improved [24]. The peak seen at the 1711 cm−1 characteristic band belongs to the CO bond. It expresses the stretching vibrations of the strong and broadband –OH bond seen at 3164 cm−1 and the C–H bond, which is one of the peak alkyl groups seen at 2903 cm−1 [25,26]. In addition, C–O stretching belonging to epoxy groups is observed at 1226 cm−1, and C–O stretching belonging to alkoxy groups is observed at 1027 cm−1 in rGO structure [27,28]. All these results show that rGO was successfully obtained after the reduction reaction. If the FT-IR spectrum of PVA is compared with the spectra of PVA / GO and PVA / rGO composites, it is concluded that the obtained curves as a result of the analysis are similar to each other. The obtained characteristic peaks for PVA were detected in almost the same wavenumber for PVA/GO and PVA/rGO nanocomposites [7]. This shows that GO and rGO filling materials do not damage the PVA structure. While the –OH stretching vibration of the PVA polymer was at 3270 cm−1 wavenumber, this peak decreased up to 3265 cm−1 wavenumber with the addition of GO and decreased up to 3260 cm−1 wavenumber with the addition of rGO nanomaterial. In addition, it was observed that the intensity of these peaks decreased in direct proportion with the GO and rGO contribution. This indicates that hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups in PVA chains decreases [29]. Meanwhile, in the FT-IR spectrum, the CO stretching vibration of the composites was detected at a higher intensity than the CO stretching vibration observed in the PVA polymer. This value occurred in the PVA structure at 1730 cm−1 wavenumber and it was observed in the structures of PVA/GO (100/0.01), PVA/GO (100/0.02), PVA/rGO (100/0.01), and PVA/rGO (100/0.02) composites at 1726, 1711, 1727 and 1715 cm−1, respectively. This result indicates that hydrogen bonding between CO and –OH has been established. In other words, the presence of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group in PVA and oxygen-containing functional groups remaining in the structure of nanomaterials can be mentioned [30,31]. The peak seen at approximately 1080 cm−1 for PVA/GO and PVA/rGO composites expresses the stretching vibration of the C–O group [26]. In addition, in the FT-IR spectra of shape memory polymeric materials, the stretching vibration of the C=C bond is in the range of 1630-1650 cm−1, the bending band of PVA is in the range of 1410-1415 cm−1 and finally, the CH bending band is in the range of 1310-1370 cm−1 [32,33]. All these results prove the existence of strong interfacial interaction between fillers and the PVA matrix."
11,SEM/EDX Analysis,"3.5 SEM/EDX Analysis Zeiss brand, EVO MA10 model scanning electron microscope was used to examine the surface morphology of the synthesized materials. In addition, the determination of the chemical composition of these materials and the verification of the chemical composition elements were carried out by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The obtained SEM/EDX analysis results are given in Fig. 10 . When the surface image of GO is examined, it is seen that the GO layers are stacked together. This image is consistent with the image of the GO nanomaterial given in the literature [34,35]. When the SEM image of rGO is examined, a wrinkled structure is observed, proving that the oxygen has moved away from the structure [36]. In the EDX results, it was determined that GO had 39.47% (at.%) Oxygen and rGO had 43.20% (at.%) Oxygen element with 16.2% error rate. Although this result is beyond our expectations, when SEM images, FT-IR spectra and XRD patterns are evaluated together, it can be said that rGO was obtained from the GO nanomaterial by a partially successful reduction reaction. As mentioned in our previous study, the SEM/EDX analysis results of PVA are consistent with the literature [7,37,38]. Pure PVA polymer is quite transparent in nature as seen in Fig. 10 because its spectrum does not show any peak in the visible region [39]. With the addition of GO and rGO nanomaterials to the PVA matrix, the transparent PVA polymer turned slightly brownish in color. And as the amount of these nanomaterials added increased, the transparency of the PVA layers decreased further. Although slight roughness is seen on their surfaces, SEM images of PVA/GO and PVA/rGO nanocomposites prove the existence of a homogeneous distribution between matrix and filler [40]. Besides, according to the results of EDX analysis, it was determined that as the filler was added to the PVA material, the carbon ratio (wt.% and at.%) decreased and the oxygen ratio (wt.% and at.%) increased."
12,Shape Memory Performance,"3.6 Shape Memory Performance Shape memory properties of polymeric nanocomposites were examined by the bending test. The melting points of the materials were taken into consideration as the transition temperature. Since the melting point of each material is different, a single transition temperature was determined to compare the shape memory performance of the samples with each other. This temperature was chosen as 50 °C, taking into account the ambient temperature. In this test, firstly the cut materials in 1 × 5 cm dimensions were doubled and cooled from 50°C to 5°C for 5 minutes under force. The angle measured at the time the force is applied to the materials, θmax, was taken as 180° due to the doubling of the materials. Then the force applied to the materials was removed. In this case, θmax had changed and took a value slightly less than 180°. This angle was measured for each material and recorded as θconstant. Finally, the materials that fixed their temporary shapes were heated to the transition temperature and the steps of returning to their initial (permanent) shapes were observed. The measured angle values during the test are shown schematically in Fig. 11 . The shape fixity (Rf) and the shape recovery (Rr) rates were calculated using Equations 2 and 3 [41]. (2) R f = θ constant θ max x 100 (3) R r = θ constant − θ end θ constant x 100 Since it is known that the measurements taken in the laboratory environment lack perfect precision, 5 times the shape memory test was applied for each material and the obtained data were recorded. These data provide information about the actual value you are trying to measure [43]. The shape fixity and the shape recovery rates drawn for each material using error bars representing the general distribution of the data are given in Fig. 12 a and 12b, respectively. Besides, the obtained parameters as a result of the test are recorded in Table 2 . As seen in Table 2, the Rf and the Rr ratios of each material tend to decrease with each passing cycle. This situation is associated with the fatigue and deterioration of the material deformed in each cycle. While the shape recovery and the shape fixity rates of the PVA polymer were expected to be the lowest, it was observed that only the shape recovery rate was the lowest. However, when Table 2 is examined, the standard error of the PVA/GO (100/0.02) sample in the shape fixity measurement is at the highest value. This result confirms our expectations. In general, it can be said that shape recovery and shape fixity rates increases as the amount of filler increases in nanocomposite materials. This means that the added fillers improve the shape memory property of the PVA polymer. Also, as the amount of additives increased, the shape memory test was completed in a shorter time. The first cycle of the shape memory test of each material is picturized two seconds apart and is given in Fig. 13 . For example, 10 pictures given for the first cycle of the shape memory test applied to the PVA polymer mean that the process took 20 seconds."
13,Conclusions,"PVA is a water-soluble polymer that is used as a matrix in composite materials, reacts easily with cross-linked materials. Thanks to their superior mechanical properties, shape memory composite materials with PVA matrix are used in extensive research and in various industrial fields [44,45]. For this reason, we used PVA as a matrix in the nanocomposite materials we produced in this study. Four shape memory nanocomposite materials were produced by using two different nanomaterials (GO and rGO) as fillers in two different proportions. Each produced material was characterized to determine how the fillers added to the PVA matrix affect some properties of the polymer such as thermal, structural and shape memory. According to the DSC curve of the undoped PVA sample, a sharp endothermic peak at 197°C and a broad endothermic peak at 81°C was observed, corresponding to the melting temperature and glass transition temperature, respectively. The Tg value appears to rise when the PVA sample is doped, as evidence to the presence of a strong interface interaction between the nanomaterials and the PVA matrix. The material with the highest Tg value was determined as PVA/GO (100/0.02) nanocomposite. The increase in the rates of mass loss seen in the second stage of the TGA curves confirms the Tm values determined in the DSC curves. This value tended to decrease as the amount of filler increased. It was determined that the material with the lowest Tm value among nanocomposite materials was again PVA/GO (100/0.02) material. In addition, it is clearly seen from the TGA curves of the produced materials that the thermal stability increases as the amount of filler increases. All these obtained results about thermal characterization are compatible with each other and with the literature [12–15,46–48]. XRD analysis was carried out to investigate the crystallite properties of the produced shape memory materials. As a result of this analysis, sharp peaks were obtained and thus the crystallite size of each material was calculated. It was determined that the material with the highest crystallite size with 12.40 nm was PVA/GO (100/0.02) shape memory nanocomposite. In addition, the absence of characteristic peaks of fillers in XRD patterns of nanocomposite materials indicates that GO and rGO nanomaterials are homogeneously distributed in the PVA matrix. According to FT-IR measurement results; sharp peaks between 1000-1200 cm−1 and wide peaks between 3000-3500 cm−1 are characteristic of the PVA and these peak values correspond to C–O and –OH stretching bands, respectively [49]. It is seen that these values are in accordance with the literature. Besides, the characteristic peaks of PVA were observed at almost the same wavelength in the FT-IR spectra of nanocomposite materials too, indicating that a strong interface interaction occurs between the fillers and the matrix. A homogeneous distribution was observed between PVA and rGO/GO nanomaterials in the SEM images of shape memory nanocomposites. According to the EDX results, it was determined that as the amount of filler in the nanocomposite material increases, the Oxygen ratio tends to increase. The most important factors affecting the shape memory properties of polymers are soft zone length, hard zone content, crystallinity, transition temperature, and crosslink density [50-52]. When the shape memory test results were evaluated, it was observed that the material with the highest Rr value was PVA/GO (100/0.02). The high degree of hydrogen bonding structure and high crystallinity value positively affected the shape recovery property of this material. As a result, it has been determined that the shape fixity and the shape recovery ratios of all synthesized shape memory polymeric nanocomposites are above 95%. Therefore, it can be said that these materials are suitable for the production of shape memory featured materials and can be used in various industrial fields."
