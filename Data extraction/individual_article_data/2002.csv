0,Introduction,"At present, the excessive utilization of fossil fuels consequently causes global climate change because of the emission of greenhouse pollutants, including CO x , NO x , SO x , C x H y , soot, ash, droplets of tars, and other organic compounds, which are released into the atmosphere as a result of their combustion [1,2]. With regards to energy security and the global environment, the use of hydrogen is a potential way to reduce the greenhouse effect, and hydrogen is considered to be the major energy carrier for the future because of its high conversion capability, recyclability, and non-polluting nature [3]. It has a high energy content of 122kJ/g, which is 2.75 times greater than those of hydrocarbon fuels. Moreover, it produces only water as its end-product when it burns [4,5]. Hydrogen can be produced from different raw materials, including fossil fuels, biomass, and water. Particularly, hydrogen production by biological processes is of great interest because they can be operated at ambient temperatures and pressures, leading to lowering energy consumption and becoming more environmentally friendly [6]. Biological hydrogen production can be achieved by using anaerobic (dark fermentation) and photosynthetic (photo-fermentation) processes with carbohydrate-rich biomass as a renewable resource. For the anaerobic fermentation, the first step is the enzymatic hydrolysis of high molecular weight organics to water-soluble organics, and the simple organics are further fermented in the second step to produce volatile fatty acids (VFA), hydrogen, and carbon dioxide [5]. The anaerobic fermentation is more advantageous than the photo-fermentation since it does not depend on energy provided by sunlight, resulting in a high constant hydrogen generation rate throughout the day and night [7]. Hence, the mass production of hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation using high-strength wastewaters as the substrate has been attracting considerable attention. The use of wastewaters as the substrate for hydrogen production with current anaerobic treatment technology is an effective way of producing clean energy from renewable resources in a sustainable approach. This provides dual benefits for the direct wastewater treatment along with the sustainable bio-energy production [6]. Thailand is the world's largest exporter of cassava starch [8], and about 2.5 million tons of starch were exported in 2009 [9]. In the starch production process, 1kg of fresh cassava root yields about 0.2kg of starch, 0.4–0.9kg of residue, and about 5–7liters of wastewater [10]. Cassava wastewater is a carbohydrate-rich starch waste, and has a very high chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total solids [11]. It has already been proved to have high potential for hydrogen production from starch wastewaters via anaerobic fermentation by using batch reactor, repeated-batch reactor, anaerobic contact reactor, upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, and agitated granular sludge bed (AGSB) reactor [12–24]. However, to our knowledge, there has been only one work reporting the use of an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) for treating a cassava waste, i.e. cassava stillage, for biogas production [25], and also, hydrogen production from real industry-derived cassava wastewater by using an ASBR has not yet been reported. The ASBR process has several advantages compared to other processes since it is easy to control, has high flexibility, and has a relatively low investment cost. This is because the ASBR does not require a separate clarifier [26]. In this work, the effects of number of cycles per day, COD loading rate, and COD:N ratio on the biological hydrogen production from cassava wastewater using anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) were investigated to obtain the optimum conditions that provide maximum hydrogen production. The correlation between the composition of organic acids produced and the process performance in hydrogen production was also investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Anaerobic seed sludge preparation,"2.1 Anaerobic seed sludge preparation The anaerobic sludge sample obtained from the first anaerobic pond treating a cassava wastewater (Sahamitr Tapioca Chonburi Ltd., Part., Chonburi, Thailand) was first concentrated by sedimentation, and the concentrated sludge was ground and filtered through a 1mm sieve to remove debris and large sand particles. After that, it was pretreated by boiling at 95°C for 15min to eradicate the methane-producing bacteria (or hydrogen consumers) and to enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria [27]. The heat-treated sludge was then used to start up the studied anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) units."
3,Feed preparation,"2.2 Feed preparation The cassava wastewater obtained from a cassava starch production plant (Sahamitr Tapioca Chonburi Ltd., Part., Chonburi, Thailand) was filtered through a 0.2μm sieve to remove any large solid particles before use. The cassava wastewater, having a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of around 20,000mg/l or slightly higher, was then freshly prepared to obtain the same constant feed COD of 20,000mg/l throughout the experiments. The cassava wastewater has an original COD-to-nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio of 100:0.7–1.9:2.3–3.9, suggesting that it does not have enough nitrogen for the anaerobic decomposition, but the phosphorus content is sufficient for bacterial growth; therefore, phosphorus supplementation was not required. NH4HCO3, as the nitrogen source, was added to the cassava wastewater to obtain different COD:N ratios: 100:2.2 (stoichiometric ratio) [12], 100:3.3 (50% excess of nitrogen), and 100:4.4 (100% excess of nitrogen), in the second part of the experiments in order to study the effect of nitrogen supplementation."
4,Bioreactor operation,"2.3 Bioreactor operation Each of two identical anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) was constructed from PVC in order to inhibit the activity of photosynthetic bacteria. The reactor had an inner diameter of 13cm and a height of 30cm. The reactor was operated with a working volume of 4 liters. Four sampling ports were installed along the height of the column in order to vary the withdrawal volume. A schematic of the studied ASBR unit used in this work is shown in Fig. 1 . An ASBR operation is composed of four sequential steps: feed, react, settle, and decant. The time used for each step is controlled by timers, which allow the pump to feed the wastewater into the top of the reactor during the feeding step. Afterwards, in this present work, the liquid in reactor was homogeneously mixed by using a magnetic stirrer at 400rpm during the reacting step. The system temperature was controlled by using a thermocouple and a heater that were installed inside the reactor. The pH of the mixed solution was controlled automatically by using a pH controller with a 1M NaOH solution via a diaphragm pump. The ASBR system was operated at high COD loading rates, corresponding to short hydraulic retention times (HRT) in order to minimize hydrogen consumption by methanogenic bacteria [28]. Two series of experiments were consecutively conducted to investigate the effects of the number of cycles per day and the COD:N ratio on the biohydrogen production. In the first series, cycle times of 4 and 6h corresponding to 6 and 4 cycles per day, respectively, were selected based on a practical range of possible operation cycles in a single day. The operation times of the four steps (i.e. feed, react, settle, and decant) for the ASBR operation in the present work are shown in Table 1 . The feed and decant flow rates were varied at a constant feed COD of 20,000mg/l, depending on the number of cycles per day. Therefore, the COD loading rate was varied according to the following equation: (1) COD loading rate, kg/m 3 d = ( Feed COD, mg/l ) ( Feed flow rate, l/d ) ( 1000 ) ( Working volume,l ) Table 2 summarizes the conditions for investigating the effects of number of cycles per day and COD loading rate. For the 4 cycles per day, the COD loading rate was adjusted at 10, 15, 20, and 25kg/m3d, with 5kg/m3d increments, whereas for the 6 cycles per day, the COD loading rate was adjusted at 15, 22.5, 30, and 37.5kg/m3d, with 7.5kg/m3d increments. Fang and Liu [29] found that the optimum pH for hydrogen production was observed at a pH value of 5.5. Hence, the system pH in this present work was controlled at this value by using the pH controller, with a 1M NaOH solution. The operating temperature was controlled at a mesophilic condition of 37°C. In the second series, the optimum conditions obtained in the first series were used to operate the ASBR units to investigate the effect of nitrogen supplementation by varying the feed COD:N ratio: 100:2.2 (stoichiometric ratio), 100:3.3 (50% excess of nitrogen), and 100:4.4 (100% excess of nitrogen). The system pH was also controlled at 5.5, and the operating temperature was also maintained at 37°C."
5,Measurements and analytical methods,"2.4 Measurements and analytical methods The gas production rate of each ASBR unit was measured using a wet gas meter. The composition of the produced gas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (AutoSystem GC, PerkinElmer) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a stainless-steel HayeSep D 100/120 mesh packed column (Alltech). The total amount of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the feed and effluent samples was determined by the distillation and titration method [30]. The organic acid composition of the distilled samples was analyzed by another gas chromatograph (PR2100, Perichrom) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-WAXetr capillary column (J & W Scientific). The MLVSS (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids) used to represent the microbial concentration in the ASBR units at steady state was measured according to the standard methods [30]. The COD in the feed or effluent sample was determined by the dichromate method using a COD analyzer (DR 2700, HACH). The total nitrogen in the feed solutions was determined by the TNT persulfate digestion method. For each studied condition, the ASBR system was operated about 10d to reach steady state before taking the data. The steady state condition was justified when the gas production rate and effluent COD were invariant. The experimental data taken at steady state from at least a few runs were averaged and used to assess the process performance of the studied ASBR system."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of COD loading rate and cycle time,"3.1 Effects of COD loading rate and cycle time The variation of COD removal efficiency with the COD loading rate and the number of cycles per day is depicted in Fig. 2a. For any given cycles per day, the COD removal increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached a maximum. After that, it decreased with further increasing COD loading rate. The COD removal efficiency reached the maximum of 67% at a COD loading rate of 20 and 30kg/m3d for 4 and 6 cycles per day, respectively. The results also suggest that the cassava wastewater is easily degraded anaerobically. The gas production rate at different COD loading rates for both 4 and 6 cycles per day is shown in Fig. 2b. For the system with 4 cycles per day, the gas production rate was nearly constant when the COD loading rate increased from 10 to 20kg/m3d. After that, it decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 20 to 25kg/m3d. When the system was operated at 6 cycles per day, the gas production rate rapidly increased with increasing COD loading rate from 15 to 30kg/m3d, but it significantly decreased at a COD loading rate of 37.5kg/m3d. The decrease in gas production rate at high COD loading rates was observed in both the 4 and 6 cycles per day systems. The comparative results at different COD loading rates for 4 and 6 cycles per day showed that the gas production rate for the system with 6 cycles per day was much higher than that for the system with 4 cycles per day. This is possibly because the more cycles per day there are, the higher the uniform distribution of organic concentration in the bioreactor, leading to the higher gas production rate. The composition of the produced gas at different COD loading rates for 4 and 6 cycles per day is shown in Fig. 2c. For the system with 4 cycles per day, the percentage of hydrogen in the produced gas increased with increasing COD loading rate from 0.4% at a COD loading rate of 10kg/m3d to 37.3% at a COD loading rate of 20kg/m3d. After that, it dropped to 30.8% at a COD loading rate of 25kg/m3d because of the negative effect of toxicity from volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation, which will be discussed later. Methane was detected at low COD loading rates in the range of 10–15kg/m3d for 4 cycles per day since the methanogens in the bioreactor can use both hydrogen and organic acids to form methane. As expected, the methane content was found to decrease dramatically with increasing COD loading rate. It approached zero level when the COD loading rate increased to be higher than 20kg/m3d. This is because the system contained a higher VFA concentration at a higher COD loading rate, which will be further discussed later. At 6 cycles per day, the percentages of hydrogen and methane exhibited almost the same trend as those for the system with 4 cycles per day, but slightly shifted to higher COD loading rates. For a maximum hydrogen content, the system operated at 6 cycles per day possessed a higher optimum COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d, which was higher than that of the system operated at 4 cycles per day (20kg/m3d). The present results agree well with the work of Chen et al. [31]. They found that the highest hydrogen content in the produced gas from a synthetic sucrose-containing wastewater was obtained when their studied ASBR was operated at 6 cycles per day. The percentage of carbon dioxide slightly varied with COD loading rate, and it was found to have an opposite trend to the hydrogen content for both cycle times. In the case of 6 cycles per day, it reached the minimum value of 58.6% at the same COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d. In a comparison between the two cycle times, the system with 6 cycles per day provided a higher optimum COD loading rate (30kg/m3d) than that with 4 cycles per day (of which 20kg/m3d was considered an optimum value). The microbial concentrations in the bioreactor in terms of MLVSS for both 4 and 6 cycles per day operations are shown in Fig. 2d. The MLVSS decreased with increasing COD loading rate at both 4 and 6 cycles per day. The results suggest that an increase in COD loading rate leads to increasing microbial washout from the system because of the increasing toxicity of VFA accumulation, which will be discussed later. Interestingly, for any given COD loading rate, the system with 6 cycles per day possessed a higher microbial concentration than that with 4 cycles per day. This is a reason why the system with higher cycles per day exhibited a better process performance. The dependence of the total VFA concentration in the ASBR on both COD loading rate and cycle time is depicted in Fig. 3a. The total VFA concentration in the ASBR increased substantially with increasing COD loading rate for both 4 and 6 cycles per day. The highest VFA concentrations were obtained at the highest COD loading rates of 25 and 37.5kg/m3d for the 4 and 6 cycles per day, respectively. The compositions of VFA at different COD loading rates and cycle times are shown in Fig. 3b and c. It can be noticed that the compositions of VFA varied markedly with an increase in COD loading rate for both 4 and 6 cycles per day. For both cycle times, at any given COD loading rate, the organic acid composition was in the following order: butyric acid>valeric acid>acetic acid>propionic acid. Expectedly, propionic acid (HPr) could be observed throughout the experiments, with lesser amounts than the other organic acids. The HPr concentration increased from 73mg/l at a COD loading rate of 10kg/m3d to 360mg/l at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3d for the 4 cycles per day operation. After that, it was nearly constant when the COD loading rate increased from 15 to 25kg/m3d; whereas, it continuously increased with increasing COD loading rate for the 6 cycles per day operation. It is reported that propionate fermentation is easily carried out either by hydrogen-producing bacteria or by other microbial populations [32,33]. The valeric acid (HVa) concentration rapidly increased from 185mg/l at a COD loading rate of 10kg/m3d to 840mg/l at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3d, and afterwards it gradually increased to 1280mg/l at a COD loading rate of 25kg/m3d for the 4 cycles per day. For the system with 6 cycles per day, the HVa concentration profile showed the same trend as the HPr and butyric acid (HBu) concentration profiles. The acetic acid (HAc) concentration also increased from 380 to 870mg/l for the 6 cycles per day. However, for the 4 cycles per day, it initially increased from 155 to 734mg/l when increasing the COD loading rate from 10 to 15kg/m3d, but it slightly decreased to 473mg/l with further increasing the COD loading rate to 25kg/m3d. For both 4 and 6 cycles per day, the HBu concentration changed most remarkably with increasing COD loading rate, compared to the others. For the 4 cycles per day, a rapid increase in HBu concentration from 533mg/l at a COD loading rate of 10kg/m3d to 2110mg/l at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3d was observed, followed by a further increase to 3730mg/l at a COD loading rate of 25kg/m3d; however, it even more significantly increased with increasing COD loading rate for the 6 cycles per day. The results showed that HBu was the major product for both the 4 and 6 cycles per day systems using cassava wastewater as the substrate. It has been reported that a system with high VFA concentrations might lead to the production of alcohols. Under the studied conditions, ethanol (EtOH) was found throughout the experiments in the least amount (less than 10mg/l), and the EtOH concentration decreased with increasing COD loading rate or number of cycles per day, suggesting that at a higher COD loading rate, the organics in the cassava wastewater are converted predominantly to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with organic acids as the main products [34]. The higher the COD loading rate, the higher the contents of higher molecular-weight organic acids. The hydrogen production rate calculated from the gas production rate and the gas composition as a function of COD loading rate and cycle time is shown in Fig. 4a. For both 4 and 6 cycles per day, the hydrogen production rate was low at a low COD loading rate due to a low hydrogen percentage in the produced gas and a low gas production rate. It increased with increasing COD loading rate, reached a maximum, and afterwards decreased at a very high COD loading rate. The results can be explained in that at low COD loading rates, an increase in COD loading rate simply increases the amount of organics available for the microbes to convert to hydrogen. However, at high COD loading rates, a decrease in hydrogen production rate is due to the toxicity of VFA accumulation. At a cycle time of 6 cycles per day, the hydrogen production rate reached as high as 0.63 l/h at a COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d. It can be rapidly increased by 56% when compared with the highest hydrogen production rate of 0.28l/h at a COD loading rate of 20kg/m3d for the system with 4 cycles per day. As discussed above, the number of cycles per day, or cycle time, has a strong impact on the hydrogen production performance of the ASBR. From the results, the greater number of cycles per day can increase the production rate of hydrogen. The reason for this increase in the hydrogen production rate is that an increase in the number of cycles per day can cause less variation in the ASBR conditions. As a result, the microbes can grow more efficiently, as shown by the higher microbial concentration (MLVSS) for the 6 cycles per day operation as compared to that for the 4 cycles per day operation (Fig. 2d). The specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) is also used to express the hydrogen production ability of the bacteria under the studied conditions of the ASBR system. Fig. 4b shows the effects of COD loading rate and cycle time on the SHPR. The maximum SHPR of 388ml H2/g VSS d (or 3800ml H2/l d) was obtained at a COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d for the 6 cycles per day operation since the maximum gas production rate and hydrogen percentage in the produced gas were achieved at these conditions (Fig. 2b and c). The hydrogen yield is a measure of the capability of the microorganisms to convert organics (in terms of COD) to hydrogen gas. The effects of COD loading rate and cycle time on hydrogen yield are shown in Fig. 4c and d. For both 4 and 6 cycles per day, there was a similar trend of the hydrogen yield. Firstly, it increased when the COD loading rate was varied from 10–15kg/m3d to 15–22.5kg/m3d, and then decreased as the COD loading rate was over 20 and 30kg/m3d for the 4 and 6 cycles per day systems, respectively. By comparing the results of the two cycle times, the optimum hydrogen yield (125mlH2/gCOD applied or 186mlH2/gCOD removed) at a COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d for the 6 cycles per day operation was higher than that (95mlH2/gCOD applied or 170mlH2/gCOD removed) at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3d for the 4 cycles per day operation. From the results, a COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d and a cycle time of 6 cycles per day, which are considered to be the optimum conditions for the maximum hydrogen production rate, the maximum SHPR, and the maximum hydrogen yield, were selected for further investigation. From the present results as shown in Figs. 2–4, the correlation between the total VFA and the hydrogen production efficiency in terms of hydrogen production rate, specific hydrogen production rates, and hydrogen yields can be used to operate and control this type of bioreactor (ASBR) for hydrogen production. To maximize the hydrogen production from cassava wastewater using the ASBR with pH control at 5.5, the system should be operated to obtain an optimum total VFA of about 7500mg/l as acetic acid, and this optimum total VFA can be used as a process indicator for hydrogen production for this type of wastewater."
8,Effect of COD:N ratio,"3.2 Effect of COD:N ratio A proper COD:N ratio for mixed microflora metabolism is necessary to maximize anaerobic hydrogen production from organic wastewater [35]. Therefore, the effect of COD:N ratio was further investigated in this work in order to maximize the biohydrogen production from the cassava wastewater. The effect of COD:N ratio on the COD removal efficiency at a COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d and a cycle time of 6 cycles per day is shown in Fig. 5a. The COD removal efficiency slightly decreased with increasing COD:N ratio. A COD removal efficiency of 54% was obtained at the stoichiometric COD:N ratio of 100:2.2. It was somewhat lower than that of the system without nitrogen supplementation (raw cassava wastewater). A possible reason is that the excess nitrogen can alter the biodegradation mechanism as indicated by the increase in VFA, which will be discussed later. For the systems with nitrogen supplementation, the gas production rate slightly decreased with increasing COD:N ratio, from 2.3l/h at a COD:N ratio of 100:2.2 to 2.1l/h at a COD:N ratio of 100:4.4, as shown in Fig. 5b. A possible reason is the accumulation of excess ammonium derived from the added nitrogen source in the wastewater since a high ammonium concentration can cause toxicity problems [36]. Interestingly, the maximum gas production rate was found at the stoichiometric COD:N ratio of 100:2.2, which was much higher than that of the system without nitrogen supplementation. This clearly indicates that nutrient supplementation is necessary for acedogenic fermentation [37]. Fig. 5c shows the effect of nitrogen supplementation on produced gas composition. From the results, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were still the main components in the produced gas. Methane was detected at very low levels under the studied conditions. For the systems with nitrogen supplementation, the hydrogen content decreased significantly with increasing COD:N ratio, from 40.6% at a COD:N ratio of 100:2.2–27.2% at a COD:N ratio of 100:4.4, whereas the carbon dioxide content increased almost proportionally. One possible reason is that the NH4HCO3 used as the nitrogen source has a carbonate group in the molecule, which can be converted to form carbon dioxide in the produced gas [36]. Another possible reason is that the metabolic pathway of microorganism shifts to the formation of more organic acids and ethanol that tend to induce more carbon dioxide production in the produced gas, as shown next in Fig. 6 . The maximum hydrogen percentage was obtained at a COD:N ratio of 100:2.2, which was almost the same as that of the system without nitrogen supplementation. Fig. 5d shows the microbial concentration in the bioreactor in terms of MLVSS at different COD:N ratios. The MLVSS varied insignificantly in the range of 8000–12,000mg/l under the studied conditions. The highest MLVSS was obtained at the condition with extremely excess nitrogen supplementation at the COD:N ratio of 100:4.4. This is possibly because the excess nitrogen concentration in the media shifts the microbial metabolism to the cell growth rather than to the gas production (Fig. 5b). The relationship between the total VFA concentration and the COD:N ratio is shown in Fig. 6a. The total VFA concentration increased significantly with increasing COD:N ratio, from 5450mg/l at a COD:N ratio of of 100:2.2 to 15,570mg/l at a COD:N ratio of 100:4.4. The obtained results agree well with the results of Liu and Shen [38]. They reported that the increase in nitrogen concentration caused the increase in VFA production in the liquid media. The increase in total VFA concentration directly leads to the decrease in hydrogen production, as shown next in Fig. 7 . The total VFA concentration at the optimum COD:N ratio of 100:2.2 was also found to be lower than that of the system without nitrogen supplementation. Fig. 6b depicts the effect of nitrogen supplementation on VFA composition. When the COD:N ratio increased, the HPr, HBu, and HVa concentrations increased, while the HAc concentration decreased. The HBu was the predominant VFA product (1100–3850mg/l), followed by HVa (170–2580mg/l), HAc (329–544mg/l), and HPr (46–420mg/l). The increase in HBu production accompanying the decrease in HAc production when changing the COD:N ratio from 100:2.2 to 100:4.4 implies that the HAc fermentation via Eq. (2) gradually shifted to the HBu fermentation via Eq. (3) [39]. This leads to the observed decrease in hydrogen composition at a higher COD:N ratio (Fig. 5c). (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 ( Glucose ) + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH ( Acetic acid ) + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 ( Glucose ) → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH ( Butyric acid ) + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 In addition, the increase in HPr production via Eq. (4) [39], the increase in HVa production via Eqs. (5) and (6) [40], and the increase in EtOH production via Eq. (7) [41] at a higher COD:N ratio resulted in the decrease in hydrogen composition and the increase in carbon dioxide composition (Fig. 5c). (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 ( Glucose ) + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH ( Propionic acid ) + 2 H 2 O (5) CH 3 CH 2 COOH ( Propionic acid ) + CH 3 COOH ( Acetic acid ) + 2 H 2 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 COOH ( Valeric acid ) + 2 H 2 O (6) CH 3 CH 2 COOH ( Propionic acid ) + 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 COOH ( Valeric acid ) + 4 H 2 O (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 → ( Glucose ) 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH ( Ethanol ) + 2 CO 2 Therefore, for improving biohydrogen production, the production of HPr, HVa, and EtOH should be minimized or inhibited. At the COD:N ratio of 100:2.2, the lowest HPr and HVa concentrations with zero-level EtOH concentration were experimentally found (Fig. 6b), accompanying the maximum SHPR of 524ml H2/g VSS d (5676mlH2/ld) and the highest hydrogen yield of 438mlH2/gCOD removed (Fig. 7). Moreover, apart from the high carbon dioxide composition in the produced gas, partially via EtOH fermentation, the negative effect of EtOH, a kind of reduced product, is possibly because it consumes a large amount of free electrons that are required to form hydrogen [19]. The variation of hydrogen production rate at different COD:N ratios is shown in Fig. 7a. At a COD:N ratio of 100:2.2, the highest hydrogen production rate of 0.95l/h was achieved since the highest gas production rate (Fig. 5b) and the highest hydrogen composition in the produced gas (Fig. 5c) were obtained. When the COD:N ratio increased, the hydrogen production rate decreased. A possible cause may be the same as explained above for the produced gas composition and the gas production rate. As compared to the system without nutrient supplementation, the hydrogen production rate was greatly enhanced, possibly because the nutrient supplementation increases the bacterial diversity in the bioreactor; in particular, the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria [42]. The effect of nitrogen supplementation on the SHPR is shown in Fig. 7b. The COD:N ratio had a significant influence on the SHPR. A maximum SHPR of 524mlH2/gVSSd (5680mlH2/ld) was obtained at a COD:N ratio of 100:2.2 because of the high hydrogen production rate (Fig. 7a). The nitrogen content also had a strong effect on the hydrogen yields. The hydrogen yield increased from 186mlH2/gCOD removed (125mlH2/gCOD applied) for the system without nitrogen supplementation to 438mlH2/gCOD removed (235ml H2/g COD applied) for the system with nitrogen supplementation at a COD:N ratio of 100:2.2, as shown in Fig. 7c and d, respectively; and this was the maximum hydrogen yield obtained in this work."
9,Conclusions,"This work investigated the effects of operating parameters on biohydrogen production from cassava wastewater using anaerobic sequencing batch reactors. Without nitrogen supplementation, the systems operated under a COD loading rate of 30kg/m3d and 6 cycles per day gave a maximum specific hydrogen production rate of 388ml H2/gVSSd and a maximum hydrogen yield of 186mlH2/gCOD removed. However, when the wastewater was nitrogen-supplemented, the theoretical COD:N ratio of 100:2.2 was found to provide a maximum specific hydrogen production rate of 524ml H2/gVSSd and hydrogen yield of 438mlH2/gCOD removed. An excess nitrogen was found to promote higher organic acids and ethanol production, leading to a decreased hydrogen production efficiency."
