0,Introduction,"Metal oxides are widely used in various branches of industry and in everyday life. They find application in construction, ceramics and glass industries, environmental protection, as well as in jewellery and dental prosthetics [1–9]. However, in many cases, usage of metal oxides is problematical, especially in the case of too small specific surface area of a solid or inadequate stability of its suspension. In such situations, it is desirable to modify the solid surface. It can be performed using a variety of techniques. Currently its modification is made using, among others, plasma [10–12], by attachment of functional groups or adsorption of different low- and high-molecular compounds [13–20]. Owning to the appropriate modification, there are obtained solids with the properties desired in various technological processes [21–24]. Mixed oxide Cu x O y –SiO2 is a solid obtained by modification of silica surface by copper oxide. This latter is used in chemical industry as pigments for ceramics, plastics and glass, and for preparing ink. In recent years, this substance is increasingly applied for the production of solar panels. Furthermore, it is used in photography, as well as medicine and pharmacy. Prepared mixed oxide Cu x O y –SiO2 was characterized by very large surface area, as well as the presence of pores with large volumes. Thus, this substance can be used as adsorbents in many technological processes. It is worth noting that there are also other possibilities for the use of mixed oxides, including fillers, colourants or catalysts [25,26]. To assess the possibility of using this mixed oxide in some industries, in the present study the mechanism of adsorption of poly(vinyl alcohol) – PVA on the surface of Cu x O y –SiO2 was investigated. The choice of a macromolecular compound was imposed by its extensive use in industry in the production of adhesives, coatings, medicines, paints, oils, fibres and hydrogels [27–29]. Polyvinyl alcohol finds also a wide practical application in food industry as an agent to retain satisfactory taste, texture and quality of the food [30]. The experimental work aimed at determination of the surface charge density of mixed oxides without and with PVA, adsorbed amount of polymer, as well as the value of zeta potential of solid particles in the absence and presence of PVA. Based on these results, more probable mechanism of poly(vinyl alcohol) adsorption on the mixed oxide surface was proposed. Different structure and surface properties of the mixed oxides in comparison to the adsorbents including single oxides, can change nature of interactions between the macromolecules and the solid surface. As a result, the stability of such systems can change dramatically. Thus, one can influence the binding mechanism of macromolecular compound by the modification of the adsorption process conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In this study three mixed oxides, consisting of silica (SiO2) and copper oxide (Cu x O y ), were used as adsorbents. They were characterized by different Cu x O y contents, i.e. 0.2; 1 and 3mmol/g SiO2 and they were designated as: 02 Cu-SiO2; 1 Cu-SiO2 and 3 Cu-SiO2, respectively. The solid BET surface area and average pore volume were obtained by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption method (Micrometritics ASAP 2405 analyzer). The characteristics of applied solids were placed in Table 1 . All adsorbents were prepared at the Institute of Surface Chemistry of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kiev. Nanocomposites with nanosilica and grafted copper oxide were prepared using copper acetate – Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O and nanosilica A-380 (Degussa). The dispersion of silica in aqueous solution of metal acetate was treated at 600°C. Poly(vinyl alcohol) – PVA (Fluka), with weight average molecular weight of 100kDa, was applied as an adsorbate. This is a thermoplastic polymer which is obtained by hydrolysis of the polymeric vinyl esters, e.g. poly(vinyl acetate) in methanol solution (alkaline or acidic), according to the reaction: (1) The monomer of poly(vinyl alcohol) – vinyl alcohol is very unstable and immediately undergoes isomerization to acetaldehyde. For this reason PVA is not prepared by polymerization of the corresponding monomer, and in polymerization process of vinyl acetate. The hydrolysis degree of PVA used in the experimental work was 86%. This means that 14% of the acetate groups (OCOCH3) in the macromolecules of poly(vinyl acetate) do not hydrolyze to hydroxyl ones (OH). Poly(vinyl alcohol) is classified as a nonionic polymer. However, due to the formation of the resonant structure, the macromolecule can assume a negative charge. CH bonds located at α positions relative to acetate groups are characterized by acidic properties. The proton derived from the CH2 group, adjacent to the segment containing acetate groups, can undergo dissociation. The occurrence of the resonance phenomenon generated a negative electric charge, which can also focus on the carbonyl oxygen of the acetate group. Such behaviour is presented in the reaction below. (2) All measurements were performed at 25°C in the pH range 3–10, using a solution of NaCl with the concentration of 0.01mol/dm3 as the supporting electrolyte."
3,Apparatus,"2.2 Apparatus For potentiometric titration, a set consisting of: thermostated Teflon vassel, glass and calomel electrodes (Beckman Instruments), pH-meter PHM 240 (Radiometer), laboratory mixers, thermostat RE 204 (Lauda), automatic microburette Dosimat 765 (Metrohm) and computer, was applied. Titrations were performed using the software “titr_v3” authored by Prof. W. Janusz. The solid surface charge density was numerically calculated. Determination of the polymer concentration in the solution was carried out using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer Cary 100 (Varian). The measurement of zeta potential of mixed oxides particles was made using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments). The pH values of the examined system were adjusted using a pH-meter (Beckman Instruments). Suspensions were sonicated applying an ultrasonicator XL 2020 (Misonix) and shaken using a shaker Unimax 1010 (Heidolph) with the attached heating module (type Incubator 1000). The solids after adsorption process were centrifuged using a microcentrifuge type 223e (MPW Med. Instruments)."
4,Methods,"2.3 Methods The amount of PVA adsorbed on the surface of the mixed oxides was determined by the decrease in polymer concentration in the solution after the adsorption process. Polymer concentration was determined using the PVA reaction with H3BO3 and I2 solutions [31]. The intensity of the obtained green colour was measured using spectrophotometric method (Fig. 1 ). First, the series of PVA solutions with the concentrations ranging from 10 to 300ppm was prepared. Then, to each of them 0.07 or 0.08g of the solid (depending on its specific surface area) was added and the appropriate pH (3, 6, 9±0.1) was adjusted. The adsorption process was carried out under the conditions of continuous shaking for approx. 20h (i.e. until the system equilibrium was reached). After this, the samples were centrifuged and the concentration of PVA in the solution was determined. A single adsorption result was the arithmetic average of three measurements. Potentiometric titration started with the preparation of 50cm3 of supporting electrolyte solution and its addition into the thermostatted vessel. Then, 0.2cm3 of HCl solution (with the concentration 0.1mol/dm3) was added, obtaining the suspension pH equal approx. 3.5. Such prepared solution was titrated with NaOH (0.1mol/dm3). As a result, the electrolyte curve (reference curve), showing the changes of pH versus volume of added base, was obtained. Analogous potentiometric titration was performed in the mixed oxide systems: Cu x O y –SiO2/electrolyte solution and Cu x O y –SiO2/electrolyte/PVA solution. The mass of applied solids was established in such a way that its contents in the vessel provide a specific surface area approx. 20m2/g. The polymer concentration in the system was 100ppm. The electrokinetic potential of mixed oxide particles was measured with and without adsorbed poly(vinyl alcohol). Suspensions were prepared by adding 0.008g of the solid to 50cm3 of the electrolyte or polymer solution (100ppm). After the suspension sonication (5min), the solution was poured into 10cm3 Erlenmayer flasks. Then, the appropriate pH (in the range 3–9) was adjusted. The ζ potential of such prepared suspension was measured using the dip cell. The single result was the arithmetic average of five measurements."
5,Results and discussion,"Figs. 2–4 present the adsorption isotherms of poly(vinyl alcohol) on the Cu x O y –SiO2 surface (for different Cu content). Based on the obtained results one can state that the solution pH is a parameter largely affecting the amount of the adsorbed poly(vinyl alcohol) on the surface mixed oxide. The lowest adsorption level is observed at pH 3, whereas the highest at pH 9. Thus, the amount of adsorbed polymer macromolecules increases with the increasing solution pH. This relationship is observed for all examined solids containing copper. This is result of the polymer chains conformation adopted under specified conditions. As mentioned earlier, the macromolecules of poly(vinyl alcohol) contain a certain amount of acetate groups (14%). By creating a resonance structure they can be a source of the negative charge of polymer chains. Despite their small content in the macromolecules they have a strong influence on the structure of adsorbed PVA. With the pH increase contribution of charged acetate groups gradually increases, resulting in greater extension of polymer chains. The degree of PVA macromolecules stretching directly affects the adsorption of PVA on the surface of mixed oxides. At pH 3 PVA chains have the most coiled conformation. This means that they form loop and tail structures of the minimal length on the adsorbent surface. Such conformation of the adsorbed PVA chains causes that the individual macromolecule occupies a large part of the solid surface. This leads to the blockade of solid active sites for the other polymer chains. This is manifested by the lowest adsorption of PVA on the surface of solid particles at pH 3. It is worth noting that under these conditions there is the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged adsorbent (pHpzc in the range 7.2–7.9) and the adsorbate macromolecules (slightly negatively charged). The obtained results showed that at pH 6 the intermediate values of polymer adsorbed amounts are observed. It is associated with a more extended conformation of macromolecules than that at pH 3, which results from a larger number of repelling segment containing negatively charged acetate groups. The above structure of the PVA chains is equivalent to the larger length of their loops and tails formed in the adsorption layer on the solid surface. In addition, under these conditions, the single polymer chains occupy a much smaller part of the mixed oxide surface compared to pH 3, allowing a greater number of macromolecules to be adsorbed. Moreover, at pH 6 the electrostatic adsorbent–adsorbate attraction is still present in the system. However, it is weaker than at pH 3 due to the lower positive charge of the mixed oxide surface. At pH 9, practically all acetate groups in the PVA chains are ionized, so that electrostatic repulsion of the charged polymer segment is the strongest. As a result, PVA macromolecules adopt the most extended conformation. The formed loop and tail structures have a maximal length and a single macromolecule occupies the smallest portion of the solid surface. As a result, the greatest number of PVA macromolecules can be adsorbed on the Cu x O y –SiO2 surface at pH 9. It should be also noted that under such conditions, both the polymer and the solid are negatively charged. However, such effect does not prevent adsorption of PVA on the surface of the mixed oxide, as nonionic polymers adsorption proceeds primarily through the formation of hydrogen bonds [32]. It is also observed that the PVA adsorption on the surface of the mixed oxide increases with the rise of copper content in the solid structure. The smallest PVA adsorbed amount occurs on the surface of the mixed oxide 02 Cu-SiO2 and the highest – for the 3 Cu-SiO2. This relationship is observed for all examined solution pH values. Fig. 5 presents the adsorbed amounts of the polymer on the surface of mixed oxides differing with Cu content at pH 6 (for PVA concentration equal to 100ppm). The increase in PVA adsorption with the rise of metal (Cu) content on the surface of the mixed oxide results in the increase of active sites number, with which the polymeric chains can interact. In aqueous solution metal atoms form hydroxides. These hydroxyl groups are involved in hydrogen bond formation between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. Simultaneously, metal hydroxides can join proton forming positive groups, which electrostatically attract negative PVA macromolecules. A higher content of metal in the structure of the mixed oxide is equivalent to a greater number of formed hydrogen bonds and a greater number of solid sites involved in the electrostatic attraction with the polymer. This all results in higher PVA adsorption on the surface of the mixed oxide Cu x O y –SiO2 characterized by the greatest Cu content. Potentiometric titration method allows to determine solid surface charge density (σ 0) and pHpzc (pzc – point of zero charge). Knowledge of the solid surface charge density in the absence and presence of the polymer is very useful in explaining a probable adsorption mechanism of the macromolecular compound. In addition, σ 0 is an important parameter of the electrical double layer (edl) formed around solid particles in the electrolyte solution. Figs. 6–8 present the results of potentiometric titrations in the mixed oxide/electrolyte solution (PVA solution) systems. The obtained results showed that the point of zero charge of the Cu x O y –SiO2 surface is in the range of 7.2–7.9. For the mixed oxide 02 Cu-SiO2 its value is approx. 7.2, for 1 Cu-SiO2 - approx. 7.6, whereas for the 3 Cu-SiO2 – approx. 7.9. It means that the higher the copper content in the solid is, the more alkaline is pH at which solid surface charge is zero. Thus, a greater number of positively charged CuOH2 + are formed on the solid surface. Adsorption of poly(vinyl alcohol) on the surface of the mixed oxide practically does not change the surface charge of the solid. This means that the content of acetate groups in the PVA macromolecules (14%) is insufficient to cause noticeable changes in the surface charge density of the adsorbent. Moreover, the lack of distinct changes in σ 0 value of the solid in the polymer presence is confirmation that hydrogen bonds are responsible for the PVA chains adsorption on the Cu x O y –SiO2 surface. The electrokinetic potential (ζ) is, next to the solid surface charge, the second important parameter describing the electric double layer formed at the mixed oxide/electrolyte solution (PVA solution) interface. The results of zeta potential measurements are given in Figs. 9–11 . Based on the analysis of the obtained data, it was found that the ζ potential values of mixed oxide particles are negative in the whole range of examined pH. This means that negative ions of supporting electrolyte (Cl−) predominate in the slipping plane within edl. The higher value of solution pH is, the zeta potential lowering is greater. It is worth noting, that such values of this parameter ensure the presence of electrostatic repulsion between the particles of mixed oxides. The higher is the Cu content in the solid, the lower are the zeta potential values. It is rather obvious because the higher content of CuOH2 + surface groups requires attachment of a greater number of supporting electrolyte counter-ions in the Stern layer of edl. The addition of poly(vinyl alcohol) causes increase in the value of the electrokinetic potential of the solid particles in comparison to that without the polymer. The adsorption of PVA on the Cu x O y –SiO2 surface results in significant increase of zeta potential values which are very similar for all mixed oxides containing copper. Changes in the zeta potential in the presence of macromolecular compound may be caused by three different effects involving: (a) the presence of the charges (coming from the polymer dissociated functional groups) in the by-surface layer of the solid, (b) the shift of the slipping plane by the macromolecules adsorbed on the metal oxide surface, (c) the displacement of the counter-ions from the slipping plane layer as a result of the polymer adsorption [33]. The displacement of the negative electrolyte ions from the slipping plane by the loop and tail structures of the adsorbed polymer chains can be mainly responsible for the observed behaviour of colloidal system. On the other hand, the effect of the slipping plane shift due to the polymer adsorption can be present. It causes the zeta potential lowering. Nevertheless, in the summary these effects overlap and give similar dependencies of zeta potential changes in the all examined systems containing PVA."
6,Conclusions,"Poly(vinyl alcohol) – PVA macromolecules adsorb on the surface of the mixed oxide Cu x O y –SiO2 in the whole range of examined pH (3–10). However, the amount of the adsorbed polymer increases with the increasing pH. This is related to the specific conformation of the adsorbed PVA macromolecules assumed under given conditions. At pH 3 the structure of polymeric adsorption layer is rather flat (slight solid-PVA electrostatic attraction, blockade of solid active sites by polymeric coils – low PVA adsorption). In turn at pH 9 a thicker adsorption layer is formed (solid-polymer repulsion, greater packing of adsorbed macromolecules on the surface unit – increase of PVA adsorption level). The amount of PVA adsorption increases with the rise of copper content on the mixed oxide surface. This is caused by a greater number of possible connections between the polymer segments and the solid surface group containing Cu atoms. Cu x O y –SiO2 oxides differing with the Cu content have different surface properties. The value of their pHpzc points increases from 7.2 to 7.9 with the increase of copper content. Adsorption of poly(vinyl alcohol) does not change the surface charge density of mixed oxides. The zeta potential of Cu x O y –SiO2 particles is negative in the whole range of studied pH. The PVA addition results in significant increase of the zeta potential values, regardless of the Cu x O y –SiO2 oxide type."
