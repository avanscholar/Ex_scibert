0,Introduction,"Using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as photocatalytic materials is promising in the field of energy and environmental sciences. Its novel photocatalytic properties, excellent thermal and chemical stability, low price, high specific surface area, environmentally friendliness, and simple preparation allow it for a wide range of applications. Presently, not only TiO2 photocatalyst can degrade organic pollutants [1-3] in water, it is also antibacterial [4,5]. It also shows a broad application in green energy. TiO2 photocatalyst has the ability to produce hydrogen by splitting water [6-10], to conduct the CO2 reduction [11-13], to perform photocatalytic nitrogen fixation [14], etc. Various methods have been developed to synthesize TiO2 photocatalysts. For instance, the sol-gel method can prepare nano-grade photocatalyst particles. The sol-gel process requires the gelation and calcination process. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 highly depends on the heterojunction structure, morphology, crystal structure, size, orientation, etc. Although the high calcination temperature of the sol-gel method can obtain a high crystallization structure, it will also result in a high aggregation rate. Besides, the calcination environment for the sol-gel method is commonly in a specific atmosphere, which can damage equipment easily [15,16]. Nowadays, a lot of highly efficient photocatalysts have been designed, which typically require complicated synthesis steps. To have minimal steps for the synthesis process is commonly a necessary condition for commercialization. The goal is to obtain large-scale of the desired amount of product while being cost-effective. Hydrothermal synthesis, which utilizes high temperature and high pressure, makes it an easy way to synthesize highly-crystalline one-dimensional TiO2. Following this route, the disordered TiO2 powder can be transformed into nanofibers (NFs) under specific conditions [17]. The stirring inside the autoclave destroys the network structure of TiO2 during the structure-forming processes and forms a parallel arranged structure. Directional rotation makes TiO2 grow in a fixed direction, and thus the stirring force allows TiO2 to self-assemble into nanotubes [18-21]. Another feature that makes the hydrothermal method a promising method for large scale TiO2 production process is that it does not require complicated steps to obtain the semi-finished products of TiO2 in a batch reactor. In this work, we demonstrate a large scale of TiO2 NFs by precisely designing the autoclave. Introducing metal into TiO2 can induced surface plasma resonance (SPR) effects to enhance absorption in the visible light spectrum [22, 23]. The wide bandgap of TiO2 restricts its absorption in the visible light region. Therefore, nanoscale metal particles (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt) are commonly loaded onto TiO2 surface. The interaction between the incident light and metal particles results in resonant oscillation of the electrons and thus shows a wide range of absorption in the visible region [24-27]. Besides, Schottky barrier also appears at the metal/semiconductor heterogeneous junction. As an electron trap, it can prevent the recombination of electron holes effectively [28,29-31]. Among various metal materials, silver is the most promising candidate for loading on TiO2 due to its SPR effect and cost-effectiveness compared to other metals that have SPR effect (e.g., Au). As more particles are exposed to light, the heat-induced energy will excite the electrons. The Gibbs free energy of the reaction step will decrease, and the total Gibbs free energy will also decrease, which will increase the activity of the photocatalyst significantly [32-34]. In this study, we demonstrated a one-pot hydrothermal method with a scaling-up reactor to prepare Ag-doped TiO2 NFs, further illustrating the schematic for silver surface precipitation. To find out the optimal synthesis condition using the designed Teflon-lined reactor, the reaction temperature, silver doping concentration, and calcination temperature were discussed. For the observation, including the optical properties, morphologies, and microstructures, we observed that silver/silver oxide NPs precipitated on TiO2 NFs after hydrothermal reaction and calcination in air, but vanished gradually as the temperature rose to 700 °C. The fiber-like morphology also deformed. The surface precipitation effects of Ag dopants dominated their photodegradation and hydrogen production rate due to the construction heterostructure of Ag NPs and TiO2 NFs. The detection of reactive oxygen species was performed, further identifying the possible mechanism of charge transport. Finally, the mass production of the one-step hydrothermal method is promising for commercialization in the future."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of photocatalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of photocatalysts Ag-doped TiO2 NFs were prepared by the hydrothermal method and calcined in the air. 25.0 g anatase TiO2 powder (Acros, 98+%) and silver nitrate (AgNO3, CHONEYE) were mixed in 625.0 ml of 10.0 M NaOH (Fisher Scientific, >97%) aqueous solution in the 1000 cm3 self-designed Teflon-lined autoclave. The detailed dimension was as shown in Fig. S1. The doping concentration of silver were set at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mol%. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, the mixture solution was heated to 150, 160, and 170 °C for 24 h. Ag-doped sodium titanate NFs were washed by diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl, Acros, 37%) to exchange sodium ions for protons. Then, Ag-doped hydrogen titanate NFs was washed with distilled water until neutralized, and then collected by filtration. Finally, the sample was dried at 80 °C in the oven. After calcination at 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C, various Ag-doped TiO2 NFs were obtained."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization The crystal structures of the various Ag-doped TiO2 NFs were characterized by the X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker, D2 phaser with Xflash 430, USA) using Cu Kα radiation at 30.0 kV and 300.0 mA. XRD patterns were recorded from 2θ between 10 and 70 with a 0.01° step at 0.05° s − 1. The magnified X-ray spectra were obtained by using synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy (λ~1.025 Å) on beamline 13A1 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan. The morphology and element analysis was investigated by the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, model SU8010, Hitachi, Japan equipped with EDS, XFlash Detector 5030, Bruker, USA). The microstructure of various Ag-doped TiO2 was observed by using the spherical-aberration corrected field-emission transmission electron microscope (JEM-ARM200FTH, JEOL, Japan). The surface features were analyzed by surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics, USA). The UV–VIS diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence spectra were measured by UV–VIS spectrophotometer (V-650, JASCO, Japan) and photoluminescence spectrophotometer (PDLH-440–25, DongWoo Optron Co. Ltd., South Korea) with an excitation of 266 nm laser. X-ray Photoelectron spectrometer with an X-ray source of Al Kα (K-alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to analyze the chemical state and composition of silver dopants."
4,Photocatalytic experiment,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiment In the photodegradation experiment of methyl orange (C6H4(OH)2, Acros, 99.5%), 20.0 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in the 1.0 ppm of methyl orange aqueous. Afterward, the mixture was further stirred for 60 min in the dark to diminish the error of surface adsorption. The initial temperature in the suspension was controlled at room temperature, and the pH value was monitored at around 7. Then, the suspension was irradiated to two visible lamps (Goodly, F8T5/D 8 W) at ambient conditions under continuously stirring. The distance of lamps-to-reactor was about 5.0 cm. After centrifuging for 15 min at 5000 rpm, the absorption spectrum of the retained dye in the supernatant was recorded by UV–VIS spectrophotometer (V-730, JASCO, Japan) in the 250–600 nm. For the detection of reactive oxygen species, p-benzoquinone (Acros, 99%), ammonia oxalate (VETEC, 98%), and tert‑Butyl alcohol (J.T.Baker, ≥ 99.0%) were used as scavengers in the photodegradation of 1.0 ppm methyl orange to capture the superoxide radicals, holes, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was assessed by following our previous study [35]. 50.0 mg of the photocatalyst was suspended in the 2.0 L mixture of equivolume ethanol and water. Subsequently, the real-time hydrogen production was conducted in a homemade hydrogen detection system with six pieces of UV lamps around the quartz-made reactor. High purity N2 gas is used as a carrier gas, and purged with a flow rate of 400 ml•min−1 into the reactor for passing H2 out. All measurement is undergone at 25 °C and neutral aqueous."
5,Results and discussion,"To demonstrate the feasibility of amplified hydrothermal synthesis for Ag-doped TiO2 NFs, we extended our study to a scale-up one-step chemical route on the preparation of Ag/TiO2 NFs with enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of stubborn organic pollutants in water. Herein, a new batch reactor for the hydrothermal reaction in alkaline was produced. Based on the traditional model of autoclave, which was just 100 cm3 ( Fig. 1 (a)), we designed a new reactor contains 1000 cm3-grade of Teflon-liner and an autoclave made by stainless steel, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The as-designed reactor possesses regular demands such as high-pressure resistance, thermal conductivity, base, and acid resistance. Moreover, it is expected to produce a 10-time amount yield compared to the traditional reactor, which is only 2.5 gs of products. To promote and achieve the hydrothermal reaction's high yield, we set the filling factor to 65%, which was consistent with the traditional one. Compared to the products made by the conventional reactor, the amount of product by using the 1000cm3-grade autoclave was increased massively, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1 . The filling factor determines the remaining space in the Teflon liner for vapor, dominating the critical condition. At the same time, reaction temperature helps to raise pressure from regular to high pressure, promoting the reaction activity of alkaline. Thus, the parameters optimization for the TiO2 NFs synthesis proceeded for further study. To precisely control the morphology and the crystal phase of TiO2 NFs, the reaction temperature and the concentration of the Ag dopant were both critical factors. According to the photodegradation of methyl orange under visible irradiation by Ag/TiO2 NFs with various doping levels, Ag doping can enhance the photocatalytic activity effectively. ( Fig. 2 (a)) The optimal Ag doping levels for photocatalysis was 5.0 mol%. The photocatalytic degradation rate of 5.0 mol% Ag/TiO2 NFs was about five times higher than that of pristine TiO2. The excess doping (>10.0 mol%) level reduced the photocatalytic performance beyond the microstructural contribution, leading to a decrease of photodegradation performance. Besides, we synthesized 5.0 mol%-Ag/TiO2 NFs at various temperatures of 150, 160, and 170 °C ( Fig. 2 (b)). The photocatalytic performance of 5.0 mol%-Ag/TiO2 NFs was superior to the commercial AEROXIDE® TiO2 P25. For the Ag/TiO2 NFs with the reaction temperature of 160 °C, it presented the highest photodegradation performance. Therefore, the optimal reaction temperature was set at 160 °C. The as-prepared 5.0 mol%-Ag/TiO2 NFs synthesized at 160 °C exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange. To better understand the calcination effect on Ag/TiO2 NFs, we further calcined the Ag/TiO2 NFs at various temperatures in the air atmosphere ranging from 500 °C to 1000 °C. Among various Ag/TiO2 NFs, Ag/TiO2–600 presented excellent photocatalytic activity toward the methyl orange degradation, even higher than commercial P25 TiO2 ( Fig. 2 (c)). Its reaction rate constant also showed several times higher than that of commercial P25 TiO2, and Ag loaded P25 in the photodegradation, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2. It was attributed that the nanofiber form facilitated the charge transfer and separation. The consistent results are also observed in our previous study, indicating pristine TiO2 nanofiber showed greater activity than that of P25. Therefore, we chose 600 °C as the optimal calcination temperature. The calcination process might dominate the relationship between the Ag/TiO2 formation and photocatalytic activities [36, 37]. To explore the formation of Ag/TiO2 NFs, we studied their crystal structures by X-ray diffractometer. Fig. 3 (a) shows XRD patterns of anatase TiO2 NPs, Ag/TiO2 NFs before (Ag-doped sodium titanate, Ag/Na2Ti3O7) and after acid washing (Ag-doped hydrogen titanate, Ag/H2Ti3O7). The poor crystallized structure implied that sodium ion leads to the phase transition with a high degree of disorder. Washing the sodium titanate with HCl for proton exchange promoted the formation of hydrogen titanate. Meanwhile, the characteristic peak corresponding to AgCl (JCPDS No. 85–1355) was detected. During the proton exchange treatment in HCl solution, it also resulted in the transformation of Ag into AgCl. After the calcination process with calcination temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000 °C, the Ag/H2Ti3O7 was totally transformed into anatase TiO2 (≤ 900 °C). The peaks are attributed to the reflections from (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1), (2 0 4), (1 1 6), (2 2 0), and (2 1 5) planes of anatase phase TiO2 according to JCPDS No. 00–021–1272. As calcination temperature reached 1000 °C, the diffraction peaks of rutile phase TiO2 were observed. They are assigned to the reflections of (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (1 1 1), (2 1 1), and (2 2 0) plane according to JCPDS No. 21–1276 ( Fig. 3 (b)). Besides, all the AgCl has transformed into the Ag2O, corresponding to the characteristic peak at 2θ of 32.3°. The high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction enabled us to understand the increased crystalline of anatase and the transformation of AgCl to Ag2O ( Fig. 3 (c)) clearly, which is consistent with XPS confirmation. With increasing calcination temperatures, the peak intensities of TiO2 increased. It was accompanied by the decreasing peak intensities of Ag2O, which eventually vanished when the calcination temperature reached 900 °C and above. We speculated that the reduction of the Ag was due to sublimation at high temperatures. Furthermore, we compared the 2θ of (101) plane of anatase TiO2 to discover the Ag doping effect on various Ag/TiO2, reported in Fig. S3 and Table S1. Compared to pristine TiO2, Ag/TiO2–600 and Ag/TiO2–700 shifted to a low angle of about 25.46° Based on Bragg's law (nλ = 2d • sinθ), the 2θ reduces, meaning d-spacing increases. It is attributed to the larger ionic radius of Ag+ (129 pm) than that of Ti4+ (74.5 pm) and also proved the Ag doping effect occurred in various Ag/TiO2. The surface features of photocatalyst, including specific surface area, pore size, and volume distribution, are important factors related to the photocatalytic reaction. Herein, we quantified their surface feature by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The as-synthesized Ag/TiO2 NFs showed the typical type IV of IUPAC isotherm (Fig. S4). The main features of the Type IV isotherm are the hysteresis loop of adsorption and desorption, which is associated with capillary condensation. This phenomenon reflects a vapor-liquid phase transition in a limited-volume system. It also indicates that all of the Ag/TiO2 NFs are porous surface structures. We summarized the specific surface area, average pore size, pore volume for various Ag/TiO2 NFs, and plotted them in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . With the increasing calcination temperature, the specific surface area decreased, followed by the lowered pore size and volume. It was attributed to the agglomeration of TiO2 NFs and pore collapse with excessive sintering. The relationship between the morphology and optical properties was uncertain. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of Ag/TiO2 were shown in Fig. 5 (a). Ag/TiO2–500 and Ag/TiO2–600 showed broad and intense absorption in the visible band. With higher calcination temperatures, the broad absorption gradually decreased. The significant enhancement of absorption is assumed to the surface plasma resonance of the silver nanoparticles. The localized electrons on the silver nanoparticles coupled with an incident electromagnetic wave and further strengthened the absorption of visible light. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to recognize the photogenerated carriers utilization efficiency ( Fig. 5 (b)). Among these materials, Ag/TiO2–600 showed the lowest PL intensity, suggesting that the heterojunction between nanofibers and silver NPs contributed to the effective transfer of electron and inhibited recombination. Based on the in-depth investigation, we assumed that the influence on Ag2O significantly depended on the calcination temperature. Next, we examined the surface feature of Ag/TiO2 with various calcination temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 1000 °C. The FE-SEM images are shown in Fig. 6 . The morphology of Ag/TiO2 NFs presented fibrous and retained their morphology when calcined at 500 °C ( Fig. 6 (a)) and 600 °C ( Fig. 6 (b)). After further raising the calcination temperature to 700 °C ( Fig. 6 (c)) and 800 °C ( Fig. 6 (d)), Ag/TiO2 became necked and deformed as nanorods. When the temperature reached 900 °C and above, it contributed to the fibers sintering and agglomerating as bulk. ( Fig. 6 (e-f)) To clarify the stepwise formation of Ag/TiO2 NFs, we further observed the microstructure by TEM. Fig. 7 (a) shows the morphology of Ag/Na2Ti3O7 after 6 h of hydrothermal reaction. Numerous sticks and plates aggregated and assembled a hollow morphology. It can be assumed that the nanotube formed in this stage due to low contrast and high brightness in the core region. Besides, several nanoparticles loaded on the surface were observed. Fig. 7 (b) shows the morphology of Ag/Na2Ti3O7 after the hydrothermal process and subsequently washed with deionized water. It is noted that a solid nanofiber formed, and plenty of Ag NPs loaded. With a diluted hydrochloric acid treatment to exchange sodium ions for protons, the structure of solid fiber was not destroyed after the replacement of the protons, but Ag NPs vanished. It was attributed to the reaction of Ag ion and HCl, which further produced AgCl on the surface. When Ag/H2Ti3O7 was calcined at 600 °C, as shown in Fig. 7 (c), it transformed into the anatase phase and became densely ordered, revealing high crystallinity. The microstructure of Ag/TiO2 was explored by HRTEM and STEM-HAADF as shown in Fig. 7 (d-e). Numerous Ag NPs with an average diameter of 5.0 nm precipitated on the surface of TiO2 NFs and embedded into the TiO2 NFs core randomly. For the HRTEM image and the related energy dispersive X-ray spectra as shown in Fig. 7 (f-i), the silver distribution is identical to the corresponding HRTEM image. It is ascertained that the as-proposed procedure combined with hydrothermal synthesis and air-treated calcination produces highly characterized Ag loaded TiO2 NFs without the need for any post-treatment. Based on the detailed investigation, we proposed a possible formation route of Ag/TiO2 NFs by the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis ( Fig. 8 ). As the commercial anatase TiO2 particles were dissolved in 10.0 M NaOH, the Ti-O-Ti bonds were attacked by highly reactive hydroxide ions and assembled the octahedral Ti(OH)6 2−. It constructed a plate form and subsequently incorporated with the positively charged sodium ions to generate sodium titanate. On the other hand, silver nitrate rapidly reacted with NaOH, further producing the unstable black silver hydroxide. In the critical hydrothermal condition, silver hydroxide dissociated to silver oxide and H2O. With the mild stirring, silver oxide and sodium titanate assembled along with the same direction of rotation and scrolled like a bundle of rods. Silver oxide might distribute randomly around the fiber. Afterward, pieces of Ti(OH)6 2− fragments filled the hollow channel of the tube and create a solid fiber due to the decrease in surface energy. With diluted HCl treatment in the washing procedure, Ag+ reacted with Cl− to form AgCl, and nanoparticles vanished. During the 12 h calcination in the air atmosphere, hydrogen titanate transformed into anatase TiO2. The H2O and Cl ions released, further leaving Ag NPs on the surface. Finally, the heterostructured Ag/TiO2 NFs formed. To confirm the distribution of silver in the nanofibers, we analyzed the elemental composition by element dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In Table 3 , the Ag composition increased as calcination temperature rose to 700 °C. When the calcination temperature reached 800 °C and higher, Ag vanished apparently. The EDS analysis showed that the silver concentration of Ag/TiO2 NFs was lower than 5.00 mol%, indicating that Ag ions might have leached during acid washing and then were washed away. However, the elemental composition detected by XPS showed higher than the theoretical value. Knowing the shallow detection depth of XPS between 20 and 30 nm, it indicated the appearance of silver on the surface after the calcination. Notably, the molar ratio of silver was several times more than 5.00 mol% when the calcination temperatures were set at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C. Meanwhile, base on XRD analysis, the Ag doping effect was discovered and verified the slight silver dopants presented in the TiO2 lattice. Due to the concentration gradient of silver dopants, we proposed that silver dopants gradually diffused to the surface of TiO2 NFs and precipitated silver nanoparticles during the calcination. Upon reaching 800 °C, the silver nanoparticles were oxidized and further decomposed. Furthermore, the corresponding chemical state investigation was reported in Fig. S5. To distinguish the chemical state influenced by calcination, we calculated the proportion of silver (Ag0) and silver oxide (Ag+ and Ag2+), as summarized in Table 4 . Identically, the metallic Ag content decreased as calcination temperature rose due to oxidation. While the content of Ag2O increased, AgO was nearly nonexistent. As the temperature rose higher than 800 °C, all of the silver content almost diminished. It could be assumed that Ag NPs oxidized to Ag2O NPs during the calcination process and decomposed partially due to the low thermal stability of Ag2O in the air atmosphere. For the possible photodegradation mechanisms, we investigated the derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) by incorporating various scavengers in photodegradation. The three kinds of scavengers, including tert‑Butyl alcohol (TBA), ammonium oxalate (AO), and p-benzoquinone (p-BQ), were utilized to trap the photogenerated hydroxyl radical (•OH), hole (h +), and superoxide anion radical (•O2 −), respectively. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), it was found that in photodegradation test by using, the efficiencies of photodegradation methyl orange toward AO and TBA were consistent with that of non-sacrificial reagents. While adding p-BQ inhibited the superoxide radical (•O2 −), the photodegradation efficiency decreased significantly. Instead of hydroxyl radical and holes, superoxides radical was the primary active species in the photocatalytic reaction. Based on these experimental results, we speculated the possible reaction mechanism ( Fig. 9 (b)). Incorporated with plasmonic metals are beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction due to strong surface plasma resonance. It usually induces two physical effects, local electrical field enhancement and hot electron injection [38, 39]. We believed that the strong surface plasma resonance occurred on the Ag under visible irradiation. It led to hot electron injection, dominating the photocatalytic activity of Ag/TiO2 due to the TiO2 being inactive under visible irradiation [40-42]. As the SPR induced-electrons on Ag possessed sufficient energy overcoming the Schottky barrier, it is possible to inject into TiO2 and silver oxide and conduct the reduction reaction. To balance the leaving nagetive charge, oxidation occurred on the Ag, generate protons and hydroxyl radicals (h + and •OH). Then, the hydroxyl radicals produced oxygen (O2) to each other. After that, oxygen is reduced by electrons to produce superoxide radicals (•O2 −). Lastly, superoxide radicals reacted with methyl orange and degraded it to harmless products. The possible chemical reaction equation and pathway of photodegradation are depicted as below. (1) Ag + h ν ( visible ) → SPR e Ag − + h Ag + (2) h Ag + + H 2 O → H + + • OH (3) •OH+ •OH → O2 +2H+ (4) e Ag − → i n j e c t i o n e TiO 2 − (5) e TiO 2 − + O 2 • O 2 − and / or e TiO 2 − + 2 H + → H 2 (6) • O 2 − + organic dye → harmless products The photocatalytic hydrogen production was reported in Fig. 10 (a). The production rate of various Ag/TiO2 NFs depended on the Ag NPs loading amount on TiO2 NFs due to the cooperative heterostructure for electron migration. From the EDS and XPS results, silver content decreased dramatically as calcination temperature rose to higher than 800 °C. This caused Ag/TiO2–800, Ag/TiO2–900, and Ag/TiO2–1000 to be nearly non-active in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Among them, Ag/TiO2–600 demonstrated the highest production rate at near 250.0 mmol/g under 1 h of illumination ( Fig. 10 (b)). All of these results demonstrate that the Ag/TiO2 synthesized by the scaling-up hydrothermal method in this study shows a strong asset to environmental sustainability and completive to other silver-based TiO2 photocatalysts (Table S3) [43-47]. Our work ensures the Ag/TiO2 with acceptable stability (Fig. S6) has the capability of forming ROS which is indispensable for complete decomposition of the target pollutants and possesses the high potential of hydrogen evolution."
