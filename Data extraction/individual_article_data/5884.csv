0,Introduction,"Wearable computing device technologies have progressed rapidly due to increased interest in broadening the Internet of Things (IoT) fields and mobile computing products [1,2]. IoT technology refers to the linkages between many of the objects that are related to our daily lives or businesses and internet-accessing technologies [3–6]. In addition, the tremendous interest in combining wearable technologies and IoT has meant that the fabric for wearable devices, which is called “electronic textile,” “e-textile” or “smart textile” has been researched widely [7–9]. Wearable devices have advanced in a diverse manner using e-textiles, into areas such as devices that detect vital signs, recognize physical activity, and electronic devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, and solar cells [10–13]. Furthermore, the sensors that can be applied in wearable devices have improved, including many types of detection materials such as pressure, temperature, ultra violet light, and humidity [14–20]. Their usefulness and convenience have meant that these sensors perform a significant role in industrial fields, laboratories, homes, and elsewhere, and are regarded as ubiquitous systems [21–23]. Besides, humidity sensing has been incorporated with other heating systems to sustain pleasant in- and outdoor environments. Currently, a broad range of materials from polymers to metal oxides have been appraised for their moisture sensing capabilities [24–26]. Particularly in case of polymers, there are two types of mechanism, capacitive type and resistive type, for which the capacitance and resistance value is changed respectively by the structure [25]. Furthermore, both types are operated by the adsorption of water molecules at micropores on the surface. After a volume of the micropores is adsorbed, either the capacitance is increased or the resistance is decreased for highly humid conditions [27,28]. Moreover, polyvinyl alcohol;1; (PVA) has been mainly used as a dielectric material, membrane, or adhesive because of its high solubility in water [29–31]. Since this can be performed with both resistive and capacitive properties in relative humidity sensing, this substance has the advantage of accumulation for an RH sensor wherever and whenever such a sensor is used [32,33]. In this paper, our research group fabricated a wearable resistive-type RH sensor based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by simple production processes. The substrate was a PET monofilament that had cylindrical shape and consisted of only one stand. Since this wearable device was made for clothes, the cylinder substrate was more applicable for textiles than rectangular surfaces. In addition, the surfaces of yarn and cotton were too rough to deposit the metal thin film smoothly because the single yarn and cotton were twisted in a bundle. The conductive layer could be metalized uniformly on the surface because this polymer substrate was single fiber. Therefore, this PET fiber satisfied both the cylindrical aspect for outfits and even metal film deposition by applying a special revolving machine [6]. Furthermore, as the exposed site for the sensing area was created on the PVA layer, the mechanism was inspected with FT-IR spectra and scheme. The structure was investigated through SEM imaging and by measuring the resistance in increased moisture conditions; the effects of dip-coating speed and coating times were demonstrated via the parameters of α and β, which were induced by Ohm’s law. Repetitive bending tests were carried out with various numbers of bending times and degrees of bending curvature to determine the durability of the wearable device."
1,Experimental section,"As can be seen in Fig. 1 (a), a cylindrical humidity sensor was fabricated on single fiber PET. Its structure consisted of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer in the middle section as a sensing material with a length of 30mm and copper (Cu) thin films for electrodes on both sides of the sensing area. In Fig. 1(b), the center section, which was darker, was covered with PVA and both sides of the polymer were copper electrodes, which were brighter because they were metal material. In addition, the substrate was confirmed as having a cylindrical shape. This substrate was a flexible organic monofilament that was 60mm long and had a 300μm diameter. In addition, the fiber was single fiber, rather than a bunch of fibers such as yarns or cotton. Before manufacturing the sensor, the coiled PET fiber was linearized on a hot plate at 100°C for one hour. The fiber was then rinsed by methanol and ethanol individually for 10min at room temperature. After that, the sensing material PVA was coated on the fiber by dip-coating at one of several speeds. The PVA solution that was used in the dip-coating process was prepared by dissolving PVA powder (Alfa Aesar, 98–99% hydrolyzed, medium molecular weight, 57,000–66,000 MW) 12g in 200ml of distilled water until the solution became transparent. The Cu thin film used for the electrodes was deposited on the PET fiber via RF magnetic sputtering with 840nm uniform thickness. Our research group designed a rotating device in which the rotating speed was a steady 0.73 rotations per second (rps) to ensure even deposition on the surface. Furthermore, Cu sputtering was carried out at 3.15×10−2 torr working pressure and 85mm working distance for 10min at 50W working power. In addition, the PVA solution was inspected by FTIR spectra to investigate the hydroxyl group as the sensor’s sensing function, as presented in Fig. 2 . The concentration of PVA in the solution was significantly low at 6%, so the spectra data contained a tremendous −OH stretch at 3369.66cm−1, which was caused by combining D.I water and PVA, a CO stretch at 1640.82cm−1, and a tiny COH stretch at 1155.17cm−1. In addition, the log value of the resistance was obtained by the current (I) versus voltage (V) graph, which was measured using a Keithley 6517 in an oven, where humidity was controlled by employing a humidifier and an automatic hygrometer. The resistance was then calculated by the following Eq. (1), known as Ohm’s law [34]. (1) V=IR The applied voltage range was −0.5–0.5V, since this device was for wearable things that required a low consumption of electric power. Moreover, to investigate the suitability and durability of wearable devices made of such material, repetitive bending tests were performed by stretching and constringing the humidity sensor using a bending machine with a regular speed of 40mm/s."
2,Results and discussion,
3,The corresponding factors α and β,"3.1 The corresponding factors α and β As shown in Fig. 3 , all samples were fabricated with the same exposed length (30mm) but different dip coating speeds (1mm/s, 2.5mm/s, 3.5mm/s, and 5mm/s) on the PET single fiber, and while the relative humidity was increasing, the resistance value of every specimen decreased commonly. In detail, the starting value, which meant the resistance at 60%RH, differed from approximately 3518.1 MΩ for the 1mm/s sample to 286.8 MΩ for the 2.5mm/s sample. However, in the cases of the 1mm/s and 2.5mm/s samples, the value dropped to approximately 27.5 MΩ at 90%RH. In addition, for the 3.5mm/s and 5mm/s treatments, the respective resistances were reduced from approximately 111.5 MΩ at 60%RH to 8.7 MΩ at 90%RH and from 41.2MΩ at 60%RH to 13.9 MΩ at 90%RH. The sensing mechanism of PVA is indicated in Fig. 4 . The hydroxyl groups in PVA were continuously connected via water molecules, and multilayer hydrogen bonds were constructed. Finally, the Grotthuss chain theory that explained the orderly movement of hydrogen ions was dominant, therefore the conductance was increased. Furthermore, the results show that when the dip coating speed slowed, the initial value was elevated. The sinking and withdrawing speeds became faster during dip coating, and the thickness of films such as the polymer varnish was shallower [35]. The effect of PVA layer thickness can be proven by expressing the resistance as (2) R = ρl/A (Ω). In Eq. (2), ρ represents the resistivity, A is the cross-section area of the sensor, and l is the length of the sensing material, which is 30mm in this work. In addition, the relationship between the resistivity and conductivity was reciprocal, as presented in Eq. (3) [36]. (3) ρ = 1 / σ The conductivity could be written as (4) σ = σ 0 e x p ( − E / k T ) where σ 0 is the conductivity at absolute zero temperature and E is the energy of activation, which is related to the adsorbed water quantity, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the experimental temperature, which was room temperature [37]. The log value was taken for all equations to fit the resistance to the natural logarithmic term, and the relationship between the resistance, activation energy, and thickness was then induced by integrating Eqs. (2), (3), and (4). l n R = l n ρ + l n l − l n A l n R − l n l = − ln ( 1 / ρ ) − l n A = − l n σ − l n A = − l n { σ 0 exp ( − E / k T ) } − l n A (5) ln (R/l)=−ln{Aσ 0 exp(−E/kT)}=(E/kT)−ln(Aσ 0) As shown in Eq. (5), the resistance per length was affected by the activation energy and the cross-section area. However, the activation energy was associated with the adsorbed water amount, which was influenced by the relative humidity level. Thus, the equation of resistance per length could be expressed by the relative humidity as follows. (6) l n ( R / l ) = α x + β In Eq. (6), x is the relative humidity level, α represents the constant that was implicit in the activation energy and temperature, and β is the term − ln ( A σ 0 ) . The corresponding factors α and β can be obtained from the trend line of the graph that plots the natural logarithmic resistance per length by the relative humidity, which fit a linear function. As shown in Fig. 5 , the value of α increased from −0.16 in the 1mm/s sample to −0.03 in the 5mm/s sample as the dip coating speed increased. Meanwhile, factor β reduced from 29.37 for the 1mm/s sample to 18.44 for the 5mm/s sample. The proportional relationship between α and the energy of activation meant that it could induce the situation where more activation energy was required when the dip coating speed was quicker. However, the radius of the PVA layer, which could be derived from the thickness, was increased for a quicker speed since β was inverse to the cross-section area A according to β = − ln ( A σ 0 ) . Moreover, the thickness of the PVA film was affected by the number of dip coats. Thus, Fig. 6 (a) presents a graph of the resistance versus the relative humidity according to the coating time. The “1 time” sample was dip-coated once at 5mm/s, but for a multiple-coat process, the samples were treated by soft baking after each individual dip coat and were then re-coated. The twice-coated specimen was coated at the same speed (5mm/s) and baked twice. In the case where the specimen was coated three times, the application speeds were 5mm/s for the first and second coat and 3mm/s for the third. The sample coated four times was dipped at 5mm/s for the first to the third coat and then at 3mm/s for the final coat. The resistance value for all samples at 60%RH was approximately 40.0MΩ, but the value differed after 70%RH. In detail, the resistance was decreased down to approximately 13.9MΩ in the once-dipped case, and approximately 9.8MΩ for the twice-dipped specimen. The magnitude for the three- and four-coats samples were respectively reduced to approximately 7.6MΩ and 6.4MΩ. Thus, the resistance magnitude decreased as the coating layers increased because the PVA film was becoming thicker when the number of coats increased. In addition, the activation energy was investigated by plotting the resistance per length versus the relative humidity. Parameter α was obtained from Eq. (5), as in Fig. 6(b). It can be shown that the factor value decreased as the number of coats increased. Furthermore, since the relationship between α and the activation energy was proportional, as revealed in Eqs. (4) and (5), the sample with one coat required the most energy for 60–90%RH."
4,Durability test as wearable device,"3.2 Durability test as wearable device Repetitive bending tests were performed for various numbers of bending times to determine the durability of the humidity sensor. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the samples that were fabricated with a one coat and a dip coating speed of 5mm/s were applied to different repeated bending times: as-prepared (i.e. was not bent), 50 times, 100 times, and 500 times. The resistance value for all samples was reduced when the relative humidity became higher. In more detail, the resistance to the bending times of the 50 and 500 specimens was decreased from approximately 13.0MΩ to 6.7MΩ and from approximately 10.4MΩ to 3.8MΩ respectively. However, the magnitude of the sample bent 100 times was maintained at approximately 12.6MΩ. In general, the resistance value of any sample underwent a repetitive bending test was diminished. This was particularly the case for the samples bent 500 times, which dropped the most. Thus, the sensor conductance rose through the repetitive bending test; this phenomenon could have been caused by the breaking of the PVA nanostructure. As presented in Fig. 7(b), the β factor was acquired by fitting the graph to Eq. (5), and since the samples were fabricated with the same dip coating speed, they had the thickness of the PVA thin film in common. Therefore, β referred to the inverse relation with σ 0, and β was reduced as the number of bending repetitions increased. In addition, this indicated that both the conductivity at absolute zero and the conductance were larger for greater bending iterations due to nanostructure variation. Moreover, the effect of various curvatures was examined by regulating the shrinkage length in Fig. 8 (a). The samples were not only dip coated once at 5mm/s, but also bent at least 50 times. Apart for the as-prepared samples that were not bent, the natural logarithmic resistance values of the other specimens declined from approximately 18–16. In detail, the natural logarithm of resistance values of the 3.65mm and 11.2mm cases were altered around from 18 at 60%RH to 16 at 90%RH, but the 5.2mm sample maintained about 17.4 until 90%RH. The natural logarithmic resistance at 60%RH was smaller than for the as-prepared sample. In other words, the conductance of the bended specimens was developed. However, while the resistance variation for both the 3.65mm and 11.2mm samples was approximately 2.0 and the 5.2mm sample had not changed for 60–90%RH, the variation was approximately 7.6 for the as-prepared sample. Therefore, the α and β factors are presented in Fig. 8(b), which distinctly shows the reverse correlation between α and β. In addition, since the α value of the as-prepared sample was distinctly smaller than that of the others, the as-prepared sample demanded a lesser activation energy, and from the β factor, it could be said that the conductivity at absolute zero of the as-prepared sample was larger than for the specimens that had been bent."
5,Conclusion,"We the studied properties of a novel resistive-type humidity sensor for wearable computing devices. The value of the resistance decreased from 3518.1MΩ at 60%RH to 27.5MΩ at 90%RH because a Grotthuss chain reaction was formed prominently in a highly moist atmosphere. Furthermore, we proved the effect of the thickness and the variation of conductance or activation energy mathematically by applying new corresponding parameters α and β. The α value was increased from −0.16 to −0.03 by altering the dip-coating speed, but the β factor was reduced from 29.37 to 18.44 by increasing the thickness of the PVA layer. Furthermore, the parameters α and β were inspected with regard to changing the number of coats. Moreover, to investigate the sensor durability, repetitive bending tests were performed for different iterations and radii. Overall, this PVA-based RH sensor has applicability in wearable devices due to its simple fabrication process and highly enhanced performance."
