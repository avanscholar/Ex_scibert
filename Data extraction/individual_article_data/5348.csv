0,Introduction,"Currently, hydrogen energy is one of the attractive measures for solving the energy supply security and the greenhouse gas reduction. Hydrogen (H2) can efficiently provide electricity by using fuel cells or motive power by hydrogen-fuel engine. And in the process of combustion, it produces only water without any other contaminants [1]. As one kind of secondary energy, H2 should be produced from renewable resources and natural energy to realize sustainable development [2,3]. Photocatalytic water splitting (H2O → H2 + 1/2O2) is one of the ideal methods, since hydrogen can be produced from water by using solar energy. Worth mentioning is the work of Fujishima and Honda [4] in 1972, describing photocatalytic water splitting in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell using a semiconductor electrode. This work has been the point of reference for many later research efforts [5–9]. For the photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen, it is necessary to apply conditions of absence of oxygen [10,11]. Under anaerobic conditions, the potential difference between the two electrodes supplied by photocatalysis is too weak to make the production of hydrogen occur spontaneously [12,13]. An external voltage was required to improve the electromotive force driving electrons from the anode to the cathode and reduce protons for the generation of hydrogen [14], which was unavoidable to increase cost. Besides, one of the characteristics of the photocatalytic oxidation is that they are not selective. Any organic substance is a potential target for photodegradation. In this sense, the production of hydrogen through photocatalytic degradation of organic substance becomes an attractive project on account of its environmental benefit: waste material can be cleaned and solar radiation can be converted into useful forms of energy [10]. Not all organic substances offer the same energy output and thus high concentrations (more than 20 vol%) of ethanol were generally used as research objects [10,15]. However, the ethanol content in practical waste water was usually lower than 5 vol%. And the alcohol waste liquid contained high chroma and many other organic matters, such as various alcohols, sugars and organic acids. According to incomplete statistics, hundreds of millions of tons of alcohol waste water were discharged per year in China alone. How to directly utilize these effluents has caused of concern. For a conventional photocatalytic reactor, the photoanode is completely immersed in solution, the radiation has to pass through the wall of the reactor and sample solution before it reaches the photoanode surface [16–18], causing significant loss of radiation power and, consequently, low treatment efficiency (i.e. according to our previous study, the decolorization efficiency of 80 mg L−1 Rhodamine B in a conventional reactor was only about 14% within 1 h) [19]. To improve the light utilization, Anderson et al. [20,21] reported a corrugated-plate photocatalytic reactor; however, this structure did not avoid the loss of irradiation power by solution absorption. Based on our previous studies [19,22–24], we constructed a photo-powered poly-generation system (PPS) in this paper to directly utilize these alcohol effluents for the high efficient poly-generation of hydrogen and electric current. This particular device runs entirely on light energy and chemical energy of substrate without external voltage. The performance measurements and optimization experiments were all investigated with a series of pure ethanol concentration (10−4–1 mol L−1). With the simulated ethanol waste liquid as photocatalytic substrate in this PPS, the poly-generation efficiency of electricity and hydrogen were compared with that of the conventional submerged reactor."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Titanium plates (99.6% purity, 1.2 mm thickness) were purchased from Shanghai Hongtai Metal Production Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) to be used as matrices material of electrode. Tetrabutyl titanate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) was used as the precursor for preparing titanium dioxide colloidal suspensions. The perfluorinated ion exchange membrane (Nepem-115) was purchased from BEST Industry &Trade Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China). Round platinum disk plates (diameter 80 mm, bright platinum plating on titanium substrate, 2 μm plating thickness) were purchased from Suzhou Borui Industrial Material Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China). All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used as received without further purification."
3,Preparation of photoanode and cathode,"2.2 Preparation of photoanode and cathode The purchased titanium plates were cut into round disk (diameter 100 mm) and rubbed with various sandpapers. The round titanium disk plates were ultrasonically cleaned and degreased in acetone and ethanol successively, followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying in an air stream. Nanocrystalline titania (TiO2) film were deposited on the preprocessed round titanium disk plates by using a home-made paste, which was prepared according the recipe given in Ref. [19]. Three layers of titania were applied giving a uniform film and then the film was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h. The characterization of TiO2 film round disk electrode has been reported in our previous work [19]. Cathode electrodes were based on the commercial round platinum disk plates (titanium plated with platinum, diameter 80 mm). The cathodic polarization was performed in a two-electrode configuration with the commercial platinum disk plate as the working electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode, in the electrolyte solution containing 30 g L−1 H2PtCl6 and 2–5 g L−1 Pb(CH2COOH)2 under a constant current density (10–40 mA cm−2) at approximately 25 °C for 20 min. The as prepared Pt-black/Pt electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in the air."
4,Construction of the PPS,"2.3 Construction of the PPS The PPS was a plexiglass reactor with two compartments, schematically shown in Fig. 1 a. A perfluorinated ion exchange membrane was placed between the two chambers to provide a path for proton conduction. The anode compartment was open to atmosphere and the cathode compartment was tightly sealed with silicone stopper to supply channels for electrode leads and gas inlet–outlet. The prepared TiO2 film round disk electrode was used as photoanode and the cathode was a Pt-black/Pt electrode. In order to establish a chemical bias, two compartments contained different electrolytes with various pH values and each compartment carried about 250 mL of electrolyte. An 11 W mercury lamp was placed in the anode compartment (Fig. 1). The radiation intensity on the photoanode was maintained at about 15 mW cm−2. This TiO2 film round disk electrode was rotated at a controlled speed, driven by a motor (Outai Transmission Electromechanical Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). Oxygen of the cathode compartment was completely removed by purging the chamber with pure N2 gas (99.9%) for 20 min before performing experiments. The cell and lamp were placed in a wooden box to avoid the influence of natural light and provide protection for the operator. The top of the box can be opened for sampling."
5,The poly-generation of H2 and current flow,"2.4 The poly-generation of H2 and current flow The constructed PPS could work with many other substances but in this paper low concentration of EtOH was presently used as a model fuel. If not otherwise specifically mentioned, the TiO2 photoanode was kept in contact with a mixed solution containing 2 mol L−1 NaOH, 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 and 1 mol L−1 EtOH. The cathode was immersed in a 1 mol L−1 H2SO4–0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution. The TiO2 film disk electrode rotated at 90 rpm and the experimental temperature was set at 25 °C. The poly-generation of H2 and current flow were determined as a function of time of irradiation. Effects of experimental parameters such as pH of anolyte, experimental temperature, concentration of pure EtOH and rotate speed were investigated. The comparative experiments were performed by using various simulated ethanol waste liquid."
6,Analysis,"2.5 Analysis The electrochemical measurement of the constructed PPS was plotted using an Autolab 4.9 (Metrohm, Switzerland) system, which employed the TiO2 film electrode as the working electrode, a Pt-black/Pt as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. In the poly-generation of H2 and electricity, electric current and voltage difference between anode and cathode were detected through a multimeter (VICTOR, VC890D, Shanghai Tongqin Trading Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The evolutions of H2 at the cathode were measured using a gas chromatographer (GC, Shimadzu 14B). Calibration of the GC signal was accomplished with the use of various concentrations of standard H2 in N2. A calibration curve constructed with the areas of the corresponding GC peaks was used in the calculation of the produced H2 concentration."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Electrochemical characterization of the constructed PPS,"3.1 Electrochemical characterization of the constructed PPS It was first necessary to optimize the cell by optimizing the electrolyte composition. Table 1 presents the values of open circuit voltage (V oc) and short circuit current density (J sc) measured by using various electrolyte compositions under UV illumination. According to the report of Bak et al. [11], the voltage imposed by the chemical bias is determined at room temperature by the pH difference between the two electrolytes (ΔV = 0.059ΔpH). A similar variation tendency was obtained by us, that was the acidity-alkalinity difference between anolyte and catholyte exercised a great influence on V oc values. When the catholyte was set as 1.0 mol L−1 H2SO4, the open circuit voltage and the current density were all increased with the increase of the alkalinity of the anolyte. When the concentration of NaOH increased from 0.02 mol L−1 to 0.2 mol L−1, the changes of V oc and current density were not obvious. While with 2 mol L−1 NaOH as anolyte, the V oc and current density were all significantly improved. Moreover, under the same conditions, V oc values were much higher when EtOH was added in the anode compartment. The presence of EtOH offered a significant improvement in current density, as can be seen both in Table 1 and Fig. 2 a. The possible explanation was that according to C2H5OH + h + → CH3CHO + H+, photocatalytic decomposition of EtOH consumes the holes and creates ionic species, which justify current increase [25]. Fig. 2a shows current–voltage characteristics in the absence and presence of EtOH under illumination. The current with no illumination (dark current) approached zero. The photocurrent density in the absence of EtOH was 0.972 mA cm−2 and this value could be raised by about 20% when just a tiny amount of EtOH was added in the anolyte. With the increase of EtOH concentration, there was an exponential relationship between current density and the initial concentration of EtOH (Fig. 2b). According to the principle of photocatalytic oxidation (TiO2 + hv → h+ + e−, C2H5OH + 2h+ → CH3CHO + 2H+), the photocurrent is directly related to photocatalytic degradation rate [26]. TiO2/UV photocatalytic reaction rate constants of various organic compounds have exponent relation to the initial substrate concentration [27–29]. One can infer that the photocurrent exhibits an exponential function of the initial substrate (i.e. EtOH) concentration (as demonstrated by Fig. 2b). Another important feature of Fig. 2a was the difference in the V oc in the absence and presence of ethanol. Compared with the V oc obtained in the absence of ethanol, an increase of about 0.36 V was observed in the presence of EtOH. This additional 0.36 V is added to the anodic potential thus increasing current flow. In reality, the photocatalytic oxidation of EtOH (i.e. C2H5OH → CH3CHO + H2) involves a Gibbs free energy change of 40.8 kJ mol−1, while the corresponding value for oxidation of water (i.e. H2O → H2 + 1/2O2) is 237.14 kJ mol−1 [30,31]. It indicated that EtOH has the higher reactivity than that of water, and the results obtained by us proved this point once again. The fill factor (FF) was calculated by the formula: FF = (JV)max/J sc V oc, where J sc and V oc were 1.36 mA cm−2 and 1.30 V, respectively, in the case of 1 mol L−1 EtOH (Fig. 2c). (JV)max was equal to 0.733 mW cm−2, therefore, FF = 0.41. The overall efficiency η can be calculated by plotting JV curves under reverse bias: η = (JV)max/P, where P was power density of the incident radiation, i.e. 15 mW cm−2, in the present case. Therefore, the corresponding η value was 4.9%. The obtained values of Fig. 2 simply demonstrated the performance of the constructed PPS cell and the large capacity of EtOH to act as a sacrificial agent (reductive agent) leading to the efficient holes retaining and effective electron–hole separation. Thus it is much more efficient to oxidize EtOH than to oxidize water, which is the same as the previous reports [32–34]."
9,Optimization of experimental parameters on H2 generation rate,"3.2 Optimization of experimental parameters on H2 generation rate The purpose of the present work was to construct and optimize a photo-powered poly-generation system that consumes simulated ethanol waste liquid under photocatalytic conditions for the simultaneous production of electricity and H2. 3.2.1 Effect of the rotating speed of the TiO2 film round disk electrode As shown as Fig. 3 a, the H2 generation rate continuously increased with the increase of the rotating speed from 0 to 90 rpm. A little decrease was observed at a rotating speed of 100 rpm. The explanation is that the rotating speed of the disk electrode is important for the velocity of mass transfer and the thickness of aqueous film on the anode surface. The mass transfer rate increases with increasing rotation rate in a certain range and then reaches equilibration [35–37]. The thickness of aqueous film increases with increasing rotation rate, reported by Zeevalkink et al. [38]. Within the limited thickness of aqueous film and the fixed light intensity, oxidation rate of EtOH increases with increasing thickness due to enhanced opportunity of EtOH interaction with photocatalyst [19]. When the aqueous film is thick enough to obstruct radiation from the light source to the surface of TiO2, the oxidation rate of EtOH may reduced, which leads to the decrease of H2 generation rate. Therefore, 90 rpm was chosen as the optimum electrode rotating speed. 3.2.2 Effect of the pH of anolyte According to the previous research of Antoniadou M and Lianos P [15], if the photocatalytic cell is a two-compartment reactor with an ion transfer membrane to provide a path for ion conduction between the two chambers, then it is possible to use two different electrolytes of different pH values in the two compartments [36]. The pH of solution is one of the factors known to influence the degradation rate of organic compounds in the photocatalytic process. Under acidic anolyte conditions, the surface of the nano material was positively charged and was favorable for the degradation of negatively charged donors [22–24]. Nevertheless, the high alkalinity of anolyte could supply a potential difference to make the production of hydrogen occur spontaneously [11]. Taking into consideration of these two aspects, the influence of different pH levels (from 2 to 14) on the performance of the constructed PPS were investigated and demonstrated in Fig. 3b. The H2 generation rates of the present system increased slightly when the reaction solution pH below 12, and then improved steeply. This illustrates that the high concentration of NaOH in the anode compartment is beneficial to produce H2 and the potential difference of two electrodes plays a primary role in the generation of hydrogen. To ensure the efficient production of H2, a solution containing 2 mol L−1 NaOH, 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 and 1 mol L−1 EtOH was selected as anolyte for the other parameters experiments. 3.2.3 Effects of the temperature and the initial concentration of ethanol As shown in Fig. 3c, the H2 generation rate increased with the increase of temperature of the system. According to the collision theory and kinetic theory of gases, the molecular collision probability increases with increasing temperature as the molecular speed becomes greater [39,40]. And then, the reaction rates of photocatalytic oxidation and proton reduction also increase with temperature. Nevertheless, heating can accelerate the volatilization of EtOH. All things considered, the temperature of system was set at 25 °C for the following experiments. In this work, we selected EtOH as an electron donor and investigated the effects of the low initial concentrations (10−4, 10−3, 10−2, 10−1, 0.5 and 1.0 mol L−1) on photocatalytic hydrogen generation. In Fig. 3d, with the increase of the initial concentration, the generation rate of H2 increased sharply and then slowed down. It can be explained by the fact that decomposition of small quantities of EtOH was very efficient in the presence of nanocrystalline titania but when the quantity of EtOH became relatively large, the system reached saturation [41]. In addition, there was also an exponential relationship between H2 generation rates and EtOH initial concentrations. This was in accord with the results of photocurrent density (Fig. 2). The principle of photocatalytic generation of H2 is shown in Fig. 1a, upon UV irradiation, the photogenerated holes were used to oxidize substrates and the electrons were transferred to the cathode surface by external circuit for the reduction of protons (2H+ + 2e− → H2). Hence, the generation of hydrogen is directly related to the generated photocurrent."
10,Current flow and H2 production in the absence and presence of EtOH,"3.3 Current flow and H2 production in the absence and presence of EtOH Fig. 4 presents the poly-generation of H2 and current flow in the absence and presence of EtOH (Fig. 4a). Whether with EtOH, the electric current remained roughly stable in the experimental period. When ethanol was added in the anode compartment, the hydrogen quantities and the electric current were all increased accordingly. These illustrated that photocatalytic decomposition of EtOH took place and the hydrogen evolution rate was justified a leap. Besides, there is a direct correlation between the hydrogen quantity and the current flow. It was obvious that the addition of electron donors, i.e. EtOH, could effectively reduce the chances of electron–hole recombination. The result was similar with the report of Antoniadou et al. [25]. In the experimental period, the current flow and the H2 production rate were relatively stable that could be used to calculate conversion efficiency. In Fig. 4a, since two electrons were necessary to reduce two hydrogen ions and produce one hydrogen molecule, for 7.4 mA corresponded to a flow of 4.62 × 1016 electrons/s and 2.31 × 1016 hydrogen molecules were expected per second. For the generation rate 42.51 μL H2/min it was derived that about 1.90 × 1016 hydrogen molecules were detected per second. About 82.2% of hydrogen molecules were actually detected. The quantity of expected hydrogen molecules per second in the presence of EtOH, for 14.3 mA, was 4.46 × 1016 hydrogen molecules per second. The actually measured number, for a rate of 90.59 μL H2/min, was 4.04 × 1016 hydrogen molecules per second, i.e. 90.6% of the expected. Once again, the measured quantities reasonably fitted each other and such discrepancy was reasonable [42]. Moreover, the electric power output of this constructed PPS was presented in Fig. 4b. Without EtOH, the electrical power output was relatively low and stable in the experimental period. While, the addition of EtOH improved the electrical power output of the PPS, and the value decreased with the time indicating that the EtOH was photocatalytic decomposed gradually with time. These results illustrated that the PPS constructed in this paper could run entirely on light energy and chemical energy of substrate without external voltage, and generate hydrogen energy and electrical energy simultaneously."
11,Comparison of the poly-generation performance between the PPS and the submerged reactor,"3.4 Comparison of the poly-generation performance between the PPS and the submerged reactor To evaluate the poly-generation efficiencies, a conventional submerged reactor was employed to compare with the proposed PPS. As was shown in Fig. 1b, in the constructed PPS, only the upper half of the electrode disk in open air was irradiated (effective illumination surface area 45 cm2) and the lower part of the electrode was blocked; while in the conventional submerged reactor, only the submerged half of the electrode (effective illumination surface area 32 cm2) was exposed to irradiation and the upper half was blocked. Both the constructed PPS and the conventional submerged reactor were switched by rotating to ensure that the energy consumptions of the two reactors were identical. This setting is conducive to compare the efficiency of the two reactors under the same input. The unit surface area production efficiency of both the H2 and electricity were calculated to compare these two reaction systems. In the contrastive research between the PPS and the conventional submerged reactor, we selected three different solutions as study objects: ethanol aqueous solution with concentration of 0.1 mol L−1, 5.0 vol% Chinese rice wine (ethanol content at about 0.1 mol L−1), and the mixture solution of Rhodamine B and ethanol (composition concentrations was 50 mg L−1 RB and 0.1 mol L−1 EtOH). Chinese rice wine, also called as yellow wine, is a type of Chinese beverage brewed directly from glutinous rice with Wheat Qu [43]. Because of the unique craft handed down from generations, rice wine often presents characteristics of bright brown color, subtle sweet aroma and low alcohol content [44]. The ingredients and color of rice wine were similar to those of the waste water from alcoholic fermentation. In this instance, the Chinese rice wine aqueous solution was used to simulate the practical alcohol waste water. Rhodamine B was one of the cationic dyes with strong absorbance in the UV and visible range [19]. The addition of Rhodamine B in ethanol solution was to imitate the comprehensive sewage with high chroma. As shown in Fig. 5 , the H2 production sharply increased in a linear fashion with time and the current density obtained were relatively stable in these two systems. Whatever substrate solution were employed, the accumulation of H2 and the current flow detected in the novel PPS were all much higher than that of the conventional submerged reactor in the experimental period. This is due to the fact that in the conventional reactor, the radiation has to pass through the sample solution before it reaches the photoanode surface [16–18]. All sample solutions have the ultraviolet light absorbing ability even if the colorless ethanol aqueous solution, causing significant loss of radiation power in the submerged reactor. But the constructed PPS could effectively overcome this. The rotation of the round disk photoanode made the upper part of electrode coated with a micrometre-scale aqueous film, which was exposed to the UV radiation. This structure reduced path length of irradiation light in the solution and minimized the irradiation light absorption by the solution. In the constructed PPS, the evolution of H2 obtained by using Chinese rice wine solution had the similar variation trend as that of the pure ethanol solution, with just the slightest decrease. The 5.0 vol% Chinese rice wine solution contained about 0.1 mol L−1 EtOH and was rendered in pale yellow. Precisely because of the color, the transmittance of UV irradiation (254 nm) for 5.0 vol% Chinese rice wine were only 2.5%, 0.55% and 0.13% when the thickness of solution was 1 cm, 2 cm and 3 cm, respectively. Due to the structure of micrometre-scale aqueous film, the color of the substrate solution exercises a little influence on the performance of the PPS. While in the submerged reactor, no H2 but a tiny amount of current was detected when the Chinese rice wine existed (Fig. 5b). We were not surprised by this observation, the Chinese rice wine solution effectively absorbed the UV radiation and the photocurrent was weak enough to obstruct the evolution of hydrogen in the submerged reactor. When the mixture solution of EtOH and RB were employed in the constructed PPS, the generation amount of hydrogen was about 36% lower than the data obtained by using the pure 0.1 mol L−1 EtOH. Meanwhile, the color of the mixture solution faded with time, indicating that RB was degraded by photocatalytic oxidation in this experimental process. As mentioned, photocatalytic decomposition showed no significant specificity and selectivity for substrates [10]. Besides, not all organic substances possess the same reaction rate in the photocatalytic degradation. Because of the complex molecular structure, the RB degradation rate is lower than that of ethanol and thus the photocatalytic degradation of RB may interfere with the photocatalytic reaction of EtOH. In the circumstances, the discrepancy of results was reasonable. Furthermore, this data was more than five times than that of the conventional submerged reactor, proven once again that the PPS effectively reduced the absorption of light by RB solution and improved the photocatalytic efficiency. In a word, the results shown in Fig. 5 clearly illustrate that the constructed PPS is superior to the submerged reactor in overall performance."
12,Conclusion,"This study constructed a photo-powered poly-generation system (PPS) that photodegraded the simulated ethanol waste liquid to produce hydrogen energy and electrical energy synchronously. The poly-generation performance of this PPS was measured and optimized by using low concentration of pure ethanol solution. Compared with conventional submerged reactor by using various simulated ethanol waste liquid, the poly-generation of hydrogen and the current flow obtained in the constructed PPS were all relatively stable in experimental period and much higher than that of the submerged reactor. In the novel PPS, the H2 production obtained in 5.0 vol% Chinese rice wine was close to that of pure EtOH solution, while no H2 was detected in the submerged reactor. The PPS could effectively reduce the absorption of light by solution and improve the poly-generation performance of hydrogen and electricity when utilizing the alcohol effluents with high chroma. Consequently, the appealing PPS constructed in this paper will have promising applications in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production and provide an eco-friendly way to turn waste into treasure."
