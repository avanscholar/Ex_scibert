0,Introduction,"Considering the increasing energy demand depleting fossil fuel and its detrimental effect of utilization on the environment, it is urgent to find alternative energy sources that are environmentally friendly and renewable. H2 as a clean, renewable and efficiency energy satisfies the above requirements. Among the hydrogen production methods, the most promising method seems to be dark fermentation from organic wastes since it combines the hydrogen generation with waste treatment (Kotay and Das, 2008; Lo et al., 2008). However, the fermentative hydrogen production is a complex process and is greatly influenced by many factors (Ginkel et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, the optimization of fermentation conditions, particularly nutritional, and environmental parameters play an important role in developing bioprocesses and improving performance of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a standard, well established mathematical optimization procedure, which has been successfully employed for optimization in some bioprocesses (Ko et al., 2009; Ferreira et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). However, the statistical optimization procedure has been reported in the study of hydrogen production only recently. For instance, Guo et al. (2009) evaluated the effects of nutrition components on hydrogen production by Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 using Plackett–Burman design and Box-Behnken design. Jo et al. (2008) also used Box-Behnken design to assess the key processes of glucose, pH and temperature on hydrogen production by Enterobacter aerogenes. Nevertheless, all of these studies were carried out at mesophilic conditions except only one report available for optimization of mix culture process under thermophilic condition by Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge (O-Thong et al., 2008). Recently, hydrogen production under thermophilic condition has been received considerable attention. Compared with mesophiles, the significant advantages of thermophiles exhibited in the hydrogen production, such as increasing hydrogen production rate, improving mass transfer, suppressing H2-consuming bacteria, and utilizing numerous substrates, especially complex carbohydrates (van Niel et al., 2002; Nguyen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008). Among thermophilic bacteria, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum is frequently found in hydrogen-producing bacterial consortia and is also very effective in producing H2 from organic substrates, hence, it is significant to reveal hydrogen production characteristics of T. thermosaccharolyticum to maintain or enhance hydrogen production performance (Liu et al., 2003; Shin et al., 2005; O-Thong et al., 2007). However, there is so far no report in the literature to date regarding the statistical optimization of process parameters on hydrogen production by pure T. thermosaccharolyticum species. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of nutrition components on hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16. The Plackett–Burman design combined a response surface methodology (RSM) of central composite design (CCD) were employed to determine the optimal medium condition for maximizing hydrogen yield."
1,Methods,
2,Microorganism and media,"2.1 Microorganism and media The microorganism T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 (EU563362 in GenBank and EMBL) was isolated by Ren et al. (2008). It was grown in a basal medium containing (L−1): 1.0g NH4Cl, 1.5g K2HPO4, 0.75g KH2PO4, 0.5g MgCl2·6H2O, 1.0g NaCl, 0.2g KCl, 0.5g cysteine-HCl, 2.0g yeast extract, 2.0g tryptone, 10g xylose, and 1ml trace element solution and lml vitamin solution (Wolin et al., 1963). The strain at its exponential-growth phase was used as the inoculum."
3,Experimental design and optimization,"2.2 Experimental design and optimization 2.2.1 Plackett–Burman design Plackett–Burman design was introduced as a first optimization step to determine factors that significantly influenced hydrogen production. The technique is based on the first order model: (1) Y = β 0 + ∑ β i X i where Y is the response (hydrogen production yield), β 0 is the model intercept, and β i is the linear coefficient and X 1 is the level of the independent variable. Nine medium components: MgCl2, NaCl, Phosphate buffer (K2HPO4–KH2PO4, pH 6.8), NH4Cl, yeast extract, tryptone, xylose, vitamin solution, and trace element solution were examined to investigate the key ingredients significantly affecting the production of hydrogen. Based on Plackett–Burman design (PBD), each variable was examined in two levels: −1 for low level and +1 for high level. In this study, nine assigned variables were screened in 12 experimental designs. The factors significant at 95% level (P<0.05) were considered to have significant effect on hydrogen production and thus used for further optimization by central composite design (CCD). Table 1 illustrates the levels of each factor used in the experimental design, whereas, Table 2 shows the design matrix. 2.2.2 Central composite design Based on the results of the PBD, the experiment was further expanded to a CCD. The significant factors identified from PBD, xylose (X 2), phosphate buffer (X 4), yeast extract (X 7), were chosen as critical factors. A 23 CCD with six replicates at the center point leading to 20 experiments was employed to optimize medium components for improving hydrogen yield. For statistical calculation, the relation between the coded values and actual values are described as follows: (2) X i = ( A i - A 0 ) / Δ A i where X i is the coded value of the independent variable, A i is the actual value of independent variable, A 0 is the actual value of the A i at the center point, and ΔA i is the step change of independent variable. The range and levels of the variables investigated are shown in Table 3 . The hydrogen yield (HY) was taken as the dependent variables or responses of the design experiments. For predicting the optimal point, a second-order polynomial function was fitted to correlate relationship between independent variables and response. Quadratic equation for the independent variables was expressed as follows: (3) Y = β 0 + β 2 X 2 + β 4 X 4 + β 7 X 7 + β 22 X 2 2 + β 44 X 4 2 + β 77 X 7 2 + β 24 X 2 X 4 + β 27 X 2 X 7 + β 47 X 4 X 7 where Y represents the predicted response; β 0 is the interception coefficient; β 2, β 4, and β 7 are the linear coefficients; β 22, β 44, and β 77 are the quadratic coefficients; β 24, β 27, and β 47 are the interactive coefficients; and X 2, X 4, and X7 represent the independent variables studied. The Design Expert (Version 7.4.1.0, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA) and STATISTICA Version 7.0 (Statsoft, USA) software were used for regression and graphical analyzes of the data obtained. All experimental designs were randomized. Experiments were performed in triplicate and mean values were applied."
4,Fermentation test,2.3 Fermentation test All experiments were carried out in 100ml glass serum bottles with working volume of 50ml comprised of 48ml medium and 2ml of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 at its exponential-growth phase. The serum bottles were incubated at 60°C and shaken at 150rpm. The volume of biogas was measured by plunger displacement method. All treatments were carried out in triplicate to check data reproducibility.
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The residual xylose was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography (LC-10A, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID-10A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and an HPX-87P column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using a mixture of acetonitrile and deionized water (ratio 85:15) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. The volatile fatty acids and alcohols were detected by GC (4890D, Agilent Cooperation, USA) equipped with a hydrogen flame-ionization detector and a 2.0m stainless steel column packed with GDX103 (60/80mesh). The gas samples were measured by GC (GC-SC2, Shanghai Analytical Apparatus, Shanghai, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2.0m stainless steel column packed with TDS-01 (60/80mesh) and N2 at a flow rate of 70ml/min as the carrier gas."
6,Kinetic modeling,"2.5 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of hydrogen produced in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (4) H = P exp - exp R m e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (ml), P is the hydrogen production potential (ml), λ is the lag phase time (h), Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h), t is the incubation time (h), and e is 2.72."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Screening of significant factors affecting hydrogen production,"3.1 Screening of significant factors affecting hydrogen production PBD was used as a screening method to determine which factors of MgCl2, NaCl, Phosphate buffer (K2HPO4–KH2PO4, pH 6.8), NH4Cl, yeast extract, tryptone, xylose, vitamin solution, and trace element solution significantly affect hydrogen production. The experimental design and corresponding hydrogen production (Ps) are shown in Table 2. ANOVA was employed for the determination of significant variables. The effect of each variable on hydrogen production (Ps) was determined by the difference between the average of measurements made at the high level and the low level of the factor. The negative sign shows that the shift of the variable from the low level to the high level produced a decrease in hydrogen production, while the positive sign means that this change increased such response. From the regression analysis in Table 1, it was found that xylose, phosphate buffer, yeast extract, tryptone, vitamin solution, and NH4Cl displayed a positive effect for hydrogen production, whereas NaCl, MgCl2, and trace element solution had a negative effect on hydrogen production. The variables with confidence levels above 95% were considered as influencing hydrogen production significantly. Among variables, xylose, phosphate buffer, and yeast extract had confidence levels above 95% and hence considered to be significant. Whereas, variables tryptone, vitamin solution, NH4Cl, NaCl, MgCl2, and trace element solution having confidence levels below 95% were considered insignificant, which would not be included in the next optimization experiments."
9,Optimization of the key culture conditions for hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16,"3.2 Optimization of the key culture conditions for hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 Based on the results of initial PBD, the concentration of xylose (X 2), phosphate (X 4), and yeast extract (X 7) were further optimized using a CCD. Experimental design and results were shown in Table 3. By applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental data, a second-order polynomial equation was obtained to describe the correlation between the significant variables and the hydrogen yield in terms of decoded values (Eq. 5). (5) Y = 2.30 - 0.26 X 2 + 0.20 X 4 + 0.064 X 7 + 0.10 X 2 X 4 + 0.021 X 2 X 7 - 0.014 X 4 X 7 - 0.19 X 2 2 - 0.17 X 4 2 - 0.057 X 7 2 where Y is the predicted hydrogen yield X2, X4, and X7 are the coded values of concentrations of xylose, phosphate buffer, and yeast extract, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the significance of the fit of the second-order polynomial equation for the hydrogen yield as shown in Table 4 . The F-value, represents the likelihood of two different groups being statistically different was 43.09 which implies that the model was significant because value of ‘Prob>F’ less than 0.05 are considered to be significant. In addition, the models did not show lack-of-fit and presented a high determination coefficient (R2 =0.975), explaining 97.5% of the variability in the responses. Therefore, Eq. (5) properly described the hydrogen yield in this study. From equation of Eq. (5), the optimal values of X 2, X 4, and X7 in the coded units were found to be −0.553, 0.408, and 0.409, respectively. Correspondingly, we can obtain the maximum point of the models, which were 12.24g/L xylose, 0.170M phosphate buffer, and 4.11g/L yeast extract, respectively. The maximum predicted value of hydrogen yield obtained was 2.39mol/mol xylose. Fig. 1–3 show the response surface plots and corresponding contour plots based on Eq. (5) with one variable being kept constant at its optimum level and varying the other two variables within the experimental range. As can be seen from Fig. 1–3, the response surface of HY showed a clear peak, indicating that the optimum conditions were inside the design boundary well. HY increased with increasing xylose, phosphate buffer, and yeast extract to optimum conditions and then decreased with a further increase. This result indicates that xylose, phosphate buffer, and yeast extract all had an individual significant influence on HY. In addition, the angle of inclination of the principal axis was evidently towards either phosphate buffer or yeast extract in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, respectively, and this indicated that the positive effect of increased phosphate buffer and yeast extract levels on HY was more pronounced as xylose concentration increased."
10,Validation of the model,"3.3 Validation of the model In order to confirm the validity of the statistical experimental strategy and to acquire a better understanding of hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16, the repeated experiments under optimal conditions were carried out. According to the results of the statistical design, the optimized and economical medium was prepared as follows (per liter): 12.24g xylose, 1g NaCl, 1g NH4Cl, 0.5g MgCl2, 2g tryptone, 4.11g yeast extract, 0.170M K2HPO4–KH2PO4 buffer, 0.5g L-cysteine, and 0.5ml trace element solution and 0.5ml vitamin solution, initial pH 6.8. Under the above optimized conditions, a value of 2.37mol H2/mol xylose was obtained based on xylose consumption. The main end metabolic products were acetate and butyrate in triplicate tests. The excellent correlation between predicted and measured values verifies the model validation and existence of an optimal point. A comparison of hydrogen yield for thermophilic fermentation under optimized condition including hydrogen-producing bacteria T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 fermentation with and without optimum medium components values are given in Table 5 . The hydrogen yield obtained of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was higher than those of other reports. Moreover, the maximum hydrogen yield of 2.37mol/mol xylose achieved after medium optimization was 8.2% higher than the results obtained by previous study without optimization. This further confirms that the RSM analysis is a useful technique to optimize the hydrogen production process and improve hydrogen yield by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16."
11,Conclusions,"The present study focused on the optimization of medium components for enhancing hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 using the statistical methodology. Based on the Plackett–Burman design and Central composite design, the maximum hydrogen yield of 2.37mol/mol xylose was obtained which compared well to the predicated hydrogen yield of 2.39mol/mol xylose. The high correlation between the predicted and observed values indicated the validity of the model. This result suggested that statistical design methodology offers an efficient and feasible approach for optimization of fermentation parameters and therefore improve hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16."
