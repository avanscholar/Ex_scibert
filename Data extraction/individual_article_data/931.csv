0,Introduction,"Oleyl alcohol (cis-9-Octadecen-1-ol, CAS no. 143–28-2) is an unsaturated long chain alcohol (C-18 chain) and a clear liquid mostly used in cosmetic applications. Oleyl alcohol is used in liquid–liquid extraction processes, and to make liquid membranes [1,2]. A detailed structure of pure liquid form of this long chain unsaturated alcohol is not reported till date, except phase behavior in mixed solvent environments and in lipid membrane simulations [3,4]. We have applied the 3-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) molecular solvation theory with the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closure relation to understand the structure of pure oleyl alcohol. In the absence of experimental structural data on the liquid state, we have compared our findings with those obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Further, we have used excess chemical potentials of fourteen solutes in oleyl alcohol and in water to build a quantitative model for predicting molecular partitioning between oleyl alcohol and water media. The 3D-RISM theory was founded in the works of Chandler and coworkers [5,6]. The mathematical derivations underlying the theory were reported elsewhere [7–9]. Briefly, the total correlation function hγ of solvent sites in 3D is related to the 3D direct correlation function cγ and site-site bulk susceptibility function χ for solvent site γ around a solute of arbitrary shape at position r as: h γ ( r ) = ∑ α ∫ d r ' c α ( r - r ' ) χ α γ ( r ' ) A mathematical function, known as a closure relation, is required to integrate the infinite interaction diagrams generated from the 3D-RISM equation. One of the most used closure relations is the Kovalenko-Hirata closure which was successfully applied in different domains of molecular simulation techniques [10]. The excess chemical potential μ, and thus the solvation free energy, is obtained from the analytical form of the KH closure via the equation: μ solv = ∑ γ ∫ V d r Φ γ ( r ) Φ γ ( r ) = ρ γ k B T 1 2 h γ 2 ( r ) Θ ( - h γ ( r ) ) - c γ ( r ) - 1 2 h γ ( r ) c γ ( r ) The Θγ(r) is the Heaviside step function. Important thermodynamic parameters are derived from the excess chemical potential for solute sites u and solvent sites v, at a temperature T, as: Δ μ = Δ ε uv + Δ ε vv - T Δ S V One of the drawbacks of the 3D-RISM theory is that the calculated internal pressures are wrong, and hence the absolute number of excess chemical potential showed significant deviations from experimental solvation free energies, although the trends are reproduced correctly [11]. Several correction schemes were developed to make 3D-RISM computed solvation free energies close to absolute solvation free energy. In this manuscript, we have used the Gaussian fluctuation (GF) excess chemical potentials (μ GF) to calculate partition coefficients, without any correction schemes."
1,Computational methods and database,"The oleyl alcohol geometry was optimized at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level of theory using the Gaussian16 quantum chemical software [12–15]. The optimized structure was verified as true minimum by using the vibrational analysis and was used in the RISM calculation. The solvent susceptibility function of pure oleyl alcohol is computed using the extended-RISM (X-RISM) formalism at 298 K. The van der Waals parameters for atomic sites of oleyl alcohols were represented using the united atom TraPPE (Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria) force field [16–18]. The choice of a united atom model is made to reduce the number of solvent sites in order to achieve a better computational performance and computing algorithm convergence. The hydroxyl hydrogen atom is provided with non-zero σ and ε parameters [19]. To reduce computational demand, sites with similar charges and van der Waals parameters were counted as equivalent sites with multiplicity of n (n being the number of such equivalent cites). The force field parameters are provided in Table 1 . The oleyl alcohol/water partition coefficient (LogPOl-W) data was collected from the work of Collander [20]. The lowest energy conformation of the solutes, obtained using the MMFF94 force field, was used for parametrization [21,22]. The solutes are parameterized using the GAFF forcefield with AM1-BCC charges, and also with the UFF parameters with AM1 charges, for comparison purposes [23–26]. For the excess chemical potential in water, a modified SPC water model was used for bulk susceptibility calculations [27]. The 3D-RISM-KH calculations were performed on a uniform cubic 3D-grid of 128 × 128 × 128 points in the box of size 64 × 64 × 64 Å3 representing a solute with a few solvation layers with convergence accuracy set to 10−5 of the modified direct inversion in the iterative subspace (MDIIS) solver. All the RISM calculations were performed using our in-house code, a working version of which is available in the AMBERTOOLS package. The MD simulations of liquid oleyl alcohol were performed using the GROMACS package [28]. The modified GROMOS96 united atom topology of oleyl alcohol was used for liquid simulation [29,30]. The solvent box of pure oleyl alcohol was composed of 512 molecules, and was subjected to 1 ns NVT and NPT equilibration without any constraints under periodic boundary conditions. The target temperature was set to 298.15 K and target pressure to 1 bar using Berendsen thermostat. The temperature and density profiles were used to judge the adequacy of the equilibration steps. The final production run was 10 ns long. All the radial distribution functions were calculated using the built-in GROMACS utilities. The QSAR modeling was done using the 2D molecular descriptors and 3D-RISM-KH computed excess chemical potentials. The 2D molecular descriptor calculations were generated by using the PaDEL descriptor package [31]. The performance of predictive modeling was assessed using the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and root mean square deviation (RMSD) values. The RMSE is calculated as: R M S D = ∑ 1 N ( x e x p e r i m e n t - x t h e o r y ) N , where N is the number of non-missing data points, x experiment is the experimental partition coefficient, and x theory is the computed partition coefficient. The combined workflow is provided Fig. 1 ."
2,Results and discussion,"The NVT and NPT equilibration of the oleyl alcohol solvent box resulted in a stable system at 298 K of density of ~ 0.84 g/cm3 (experimental density: 0.8489 g/cm3 at 20 °C). The radial distributions of different sites yielded some interesting observations for intermolecular separations. The hydroxyl hydrogens had first maximum at 2.8 Å and a broad peak around 10 Å. The first maxima for the oxygen atoms was shifted to ~ 3.2 Å with shoulders, and a broad peak was observed after 8 Å. The intermolecular separation of the hydroxyl oxygen and hydrogen atoms has maxima at 3.7 Å and 8.5 Å. Evidently, the polar hydroxyl part of the oleyl alcohol is arranged in an ordered fashion. The radial distribution functions for the carbon sites point to a less ordered arrangement, with less tightly packed than the polar ends. For example, the intermolecular separations for the unsaturated centers were located at 3.5 Å and ~ 8 Å. The solvent susceptibility calculations for the liquid oleyl alcohol were attempted with various combination of united atom force field parameters and quantum chemical charges. However, the AMBER and OPLS united atom parameters with the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ atomic charges resulted in negative compressibility of the liquid phase, which was indicative of unphysical nature of the conserved susceptibility function. The TraPPE parameters with modified parameters for hydroxyl hydrogen provided a physical solution for susceptibility function. Hence, for all the 3D-RISM-KH calculations in the oleyl alcohol medium, solvent susceptibility obtained with the TraPPE parameters was used. The partial distribution functions calculated using the X-RISM formalism with the TraPPE force field parameters are in a qualitative agreement with those computed via the MD simulation with the modified gromos96 force field for O⋅⋅⋅O and C[H3] ⋅⋅⋅C[H3] centers, although differences were noted in terms of the positions of the maxima for other atomic centers. The X-RISM-KH calculations provide an ordered structure of the oleyl alcohol, as evident from the partial distribution function plot of the carbon centers with well-defined maxima. These distribution functions are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 2 (Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials). The differences in the partial distribution functions between the MD simulations with the modified GROMOS force field and the extended-RISM-KH calculations with the TraPPE parameters can be attributed to several factors. The united atom GROMOS (G54A7) force field has finite charges for all the carbon and hydrogen (hydroxyl and alkene) atoms in the united atom model. In the TraPPE force field, the charges for all the atoms, except CH2, O, and H of the alcohol unit, have zero charges assigned. The TraPPE force field does not provide parameters for individual hydrogen atoms. This increases the number of distinct sites in oleyl alcohol in the MD simulation, compared to the RISM calculations reported here. Thus, a finer structure is observed in the radial distribution functions from the MD simulations in comparison to the RISM data. Secondly, the RISM-KH theory is known to shift the maxima of the distribution function while broadening the peak. In the absence of experimental data to verify structural aspects of liquid oleyl alcohol, it is thus difficult to comment on the absolute accuracy of the MD or RISM simulation for this molecule. The experimental molecular partitioning coefficients between oleyl alcohol and water for fourteen compounds were used to build a predictive QSAR model using excess chemical potentials of the solutes computed in the oleyl alcohol and water media. Some 2D-molecular descriptors were also incorporated in the QSAR model building process. The atomic polarity indices (bpol) have a decent correlation with the target molecular permeability as well as the topological polar surface area (TopoPSA) [32]. The 3D-RISM-KH computed excess chemical potentials in water and oleyl alcohol were used as other descriptors in model building. The excess chemical potentials in water have a weak correlation with the LogPOl-W. The correlations of different descriptors with target partition function is provided in supplementary materials. The multiple linear regression (MLR) model for QSAR prediction has the functional form: LogPOl-W = a0 + a1 × bpol + a2 × μGF W + a3 × μGF Ol + a4 × TopoPSA LogP Ol - W = a 0 + a 1 × bpol + a 2 × μ GF W + a 3 × μ GF Ol + a 4 × TopoPSA The performance of the model against fourteen experimental data points, with the GAFF parameters of the solutes, are: a0 = -0.2926, a1 = -0.21, a2 = 0.25, a3 = -0.15, a4 = -0.06, R2 = 0.56. Here, ai are the coefficients obtained from MLR analysis. Replacing the GAFF solute parameters with the UFF parameters yielded a similar performance. The computed and experimental oleyl alcohol-water partition coefficients and molecular descriptors used in the calculations are provided in Table 3 . Thus, the choice of force field parameters for solutes did not show any effect on the overall predictive performance of the QSAR model, as evident from the RMSD values of prediction (~0.48 units for both the GAFF and UFF parameters)."
3,Conclusion,"In this report, we have used the 3D-RISM-KH molecular solvation theory to understand the liquid state of oleyl alcohol. A united atom model of oleyl alcohol is used for this purpose. The RISM calculated partial distribution functions showed a qualitative agreement with the radial distribution functions computed using MD simulations. The solvent susceptibility function of oleyl alcohol obtained from the X-RISM-KH calculations with the united atom TraPPE parameters for heavy atoms and modified hydroxyl hydrogen parameters were used to calculate GF-excess chemical potentials of fourteen solutes to build a QSAR model of oleyl alcohol/water molecular partition coefficients. The model for partition function calculation performed reasonably well irrespective of the choice of force field parameters for the solute molecules. In the absence of experimental data on the structure of liquid oleyl alcohol, one has to be careful in drawing conclusions on the accuracy of the MD or RISM-KH calculations for oleyl alcohol. The molecular partitioning predictions using the new QSAR model reported here are calibrated against a relatively small data set of organic acids. Extension of this model to compounds with other functionalities should be done cautiously via prior benchmarking with additional experimental data, if available."
