0,Introduction,"Recently, the electrochemical reforming (i.e., electrolysis) of hydrocarbon fuels (such as carboxylic acids and alcohols) aqueous solution has attracted increasing interest, which not only effectively produces high-purity hydrogen but also dramatically reduces the overall electrolysis voltage of traditional water electrolysis (WE) [1–3]. Formic acid, as a safe and efficient hydrogen carrier, has the advantages of low price, non-toxicity, high stability, high hydrogen content (4.4 wt%), and convenient transportation [4–8]. Thus, the electrochemical reforming of formic acid is one of the most popular method in renewable synthesis technology due to its advantages of promising energy-saving and economic [9–11]. Therefore, the design of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for both the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is a fascinating project. For both FAOR and HER, Pt-based nanomaterials are most stable and effective electrocatalyst in acidic media [12–16]. Although Pt nanomaterials exhibit excellent activity for the FAOR, the FAOR at Pt surface follows the dehydration pathway, which generates CO-like intermediates during FAOR [17,18]. CO-like intermediates easily absorb the surface of Pt (i.e., and poisoning effect), which radically decreases the FAOR activity of Pt nanomaterials. Thus, developing an effective method to facilitate the dehydrogenation pathway of the FAOR is a key point to improve the electrochemical performance of Pt nanomaterials. So far, various bimetallic or multimetallic Pt-based nanomaterials such as PtPd, PtAu, PtCu, PtCo, PtMn, PtNi, PtRhAu have been prepared to promote the electrocatalytic activity of Pt due to the electronic effect and ensemble effect, which can effectively facilitate the dehydrogenation pathway of the FAOR [19–23]. Besides chemical component, morphology and metal-organic interface property of precious metal nanomaterials also strongly affect their electrocatalytic performance [24–28]. Among various morphologies, the nanodendrites (NDs) with highly branched architecture generally reveal enhanced electroactivity for various important electrocatalytic reactions compared to spherical nanocrystals because of their numerous low-coordination atoms with high activity at steps and corners, large real surface area, particular porous and interconnected architecture [29–37]. For example, Prof. Liu synthesized ultrathin Pt NDs using surfactant-directed synthesis strategy, which revealed enhanced HER performance in acidic solution compared to commercial Pt/C nanocatalyst [30]. Our group synthesized Pt1Rh1 NDs using a simple one-pot solution-reduction method, which revealed ~8-fold activity increasement for ethanol electrooxidation relative to commercial Pt nanocrystals due to their especial dendritic morphology and optimal chemical component [31]. In the past, many researchers believed that the clean surface is necessary for high electroactivity of precious metal nanomaterials. However, recently numerous investigations have demonstrated that chemical functionalization of precious metal nanomaterials can also improve their electroactivity and selectivity [38–45]. For example, Prof. Erlebache synthesized nanoporous Ni-Pt alloy functionalized with a hydrophobic and high-oxygen-solubility organic molecules (ionic liquid), which exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction because the NiPt-ionic liquid interface achieved biased oxygen confinement (increased interfacial oxygen concentration) [44]. Prof. Yoo and Prof. Kim fabricated the Pt-zwitterionic l-cysteine interface, which effectively controlled the adsorption behaviours of spectator species on Pt surfaces by non-covalent interactions, resulting in enhanced electroactivity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes for the oxygen reduction reaction [45]. Our groups synthesized polyamine functionalized Au@Pd core−shell nanowires using seeded growth method, which revealed excellent selectivity for oxygen reduction reaction in the presence of alcohol because the loose-packed polyamine layer on Pd surface can work as barrier nanosieves to impede the access of alcohol molecules to Pd sites [43]. Thus, we may further optimize the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of Pt NDs by rationally designing the metal-organic interface. Herein, we developed an extremely simple precipitation-reduction method to successfully synthesize Pt NDs on carbon cloth (CC) (denoted as Pt-NDs/CC). Furthermore, Pt-NDs on CC were modified by polyethylenimine (PEI, Scheme S1A) and 1, 10-phenanthroline monohydrate (PM, Scheme S1B) to obtain PEI-functionalized Pt-NDs/CC (denoted as PEI@Pt-NDs/CC) and PM-functionalized Pt-NDs/CC (denoted as PM@Pt-NDs/CC), respectively. PM@Pt-NDs/CC and PEI@Pt-NDs/CC show enhanced FAOR and HER activity compared to Pt-NDs/CC, respectively. After using PM@Pt-NDs/CC as anodic electrocatalyst and PEI@Pt-NDs/CC as cathodic electrocatalyst to construct a two-electrode PM@Pt-NDs/CC||PEI@Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer for electrochemical reforming of formic acid, which only requires 0.45 V electrolysis voltage for high-purity hydrogen production."

Carbon cloth (CC) was obtained from Ce Tech Co., Ltd. The commercial Pt nanoparticles (denoted as Pt-NPs-JM) were obtained from Johnson Matthey Corporation."
3,"Synthesis of Pt-NDs/CC, Pm@Pt-NDs/CC and PEI@Pt-NDs/CC","2.2 Synthesis of Pt-NDs/CC, Pm@Pt-NDs/CC and PEI@Pt-NDs/CC Un-functionalized Pt-NDs on CC substrate (denoted as Pt-NDs/CC) was prepared by immersing the dried CC substrate into the solution of 0.1 M K2PtCl4. Then the CC substrate absorbed K2PtCl4 was put into the glass reactor, 5 mL C2H5OH was added into this glass reactor. After heating for 2 h at 50 °C, Pt-NDs/CC was obtained. The mass loading of Pt-NDs on CC is about 0.8 mg cm−2. The PM-functionalized and PEI-functionalized Pt-NDs/CC (denoted as PM@Pt-NDs/CC and PEI@Pt-NDs/CC) were obtained by dipping Pt-NDs/CC in 0.01 M PM and 0.1 M PEI solutions for 2 h, followed by water scrubbing, respectively."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical tests were carried out in typical three/two-electrode system by CHI 660E electrochemistry workstation using saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, graphite rod (5 mm diameter) as the counter electrode and PM@Pt-NDs/CC, PEI@Pt-NDs/CC, Pt-NDs/CC or Pt-NPs-JM/CC as the working electrode. Herein, Pt-NPs-JM/CC was prepared using electrocatalyst ink method. Specifically, Pt-NPs-JM ink was prepared via ultrasonic dispersion of 2 mg of Pt-NPs-JM in 1 mL of water. Then, 100 μL of Pt-NPs-JM ink was dripped onto the CC substrate surface and dried."
5,Instruments,"2.4 Instruments Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping were captured use a TECNAI G2 F20 transmission electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX mapping of SEM were measured by SU-8020 instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) pattern were collected by AXIS ULTRA spectrometer and DX-2700 X-ray diffractometer, respectively. The component of production was recorded on Quanta 200 technique. Zeta potential of sample was measured using Nano ZS90."
6,Molecular dynamics simulation,"2.5 Molecular dynamics simulation Molecular dynamics simulations were executed to reveal the adsorption mechanism of PEI and PM polymers on Pt (111) surface. The systems were built by putting PEI and PM polymers, in random orientation, above a four-layer, 10 × 10 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack grid. During simulation, atoms on Pt (111) layers were frozen. All the Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the Materials Studio package."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and characterization of Pt-NDs/CC,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Pt-NDs/CC Initially, we observed that K2PtCl4 can rapidly crystallize to generate orange K2PtCl4 precipitates after adding K2PtCl4 aqueous solution into ethanol solvent at room temperature (Fig. S1A). After elevating temperature to 50 °C, K2PtCl4 precipitate can be reduced by ethanol to generate black Pt precipitates within 2 h (Fig. S1B). Thus, we used the extremely simple precipitation−reduction method to synthesize surfactant-free Pt-NDs/CC (see details in Experimental). The chemical component and crystallographic texture of Pt-NDs/CC were first analyzed by EDX analysis and XRD measurement. Only Pt and C elements are observed at EDX spectrum (Fig. S2). XRD diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 39.7°, 46.2°, 67.4°, and 81.2° are assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes (Fig. 1 A), which match well the standard reflections of face-centered cubic Pt (JCPDS No. 04−0802). The morphologies of CC and Pt-NDs/CC were measured by SEM. Compared with the smooth surface of initial CC (Fig. S3), the surface of Pt-NDs/CC is rough (Fig. 1B), indicating the growth of Pt on CC substrate. The in-situ growth approach can significantly increase the adhesion of Pt-NDs on CC substrate, which can avoid the use of binders and prevent the exfoliation of Pt-NDs. To further observe the morphology of Pt-NDs on CC substrate, TEM) and HRTEM characterizations were performed. TEM image shows Pt nanocrystals have dendritic-like structure (Fig. 1C), which will accelerate the mass transfer during the electrochemical reactions. HRTEM image exhibits the regular lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.225 nm, corresponding to Pt (111) planes (Fig. 1D). XPS measurement was performed to analyze the surface component and oxidation state of Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. 1E). XPS spectrum of Pt shows two peaks, which directly corresponds to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2, respectively. Pt 4f XPS spectrum can be further fitted into four peaks by Gaussian fitting method, corresponding to Pt0 and PtII. According to peak area, the ratio of Pt0 is 90.1%, indicating the high reduction ratio in our experiment. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to measure electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Pt-NDs/CC and commercial Pt-NPs-JM by integrating their hydrogen adsorption-desorption charges (Fig. 1E). The ECSA of Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC are calculated to be 40.3 m2 g−1 Pt, 2.23 times bigger than that of Pt-NPs-JM/CC (18.1 m2 g−1 Pt), originating from smaller size of Pt nanoparticles subunit in Pt-NDs."
9,Synthesis and characterization of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and PM@Pt-NDs/CC,"3.2 Synthesis and characterization of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and PM@Pt-NDs/CC The PEI and PM functionalization of Pt-NDs/CC were completed by dipping Pt-NDs/CC into PEI and PM solutions for 2 h, respectively. Generally, –NH2 and –N– groups in organic molecules have strong coordination capability for precious metal. EDX spectra of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. S4A) and PM@Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. S4B) clearly show the existent of N, which is derived from the –NH2 groups in PEI and -N- groups in PM, respectively. This result confirms the successful linkage of PEI and PM on Pt-NDs/CC, indicating that PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and PM@Pt-NDs/CC have been achieved. Meanwhile, both PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and PM@Pt-NDs show the strong N 1s XPS signal, further confirming the linkage of PEI and PM on Pt-NDs/CC surface due to the strong Pt–N interaction (Fig. S5). Indeed, the zeta potential of PEI@Pt-NDs on CC and PM@Pt-NDs on CC are +44 mV and +38 mV whereas the un-functionalized Pt-NDs/CC is ca. –7 mV, which also confirms the binding of PEI and PM on Pt surface, respectively. SEM images and SEM-EDX mapping patterns of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. 2 A) and PM@Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. 2B) clearly show that CC substrate is covered with Pt nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the distribution pattern of N element is very close to that of Pt in two samples, suggesting that Pt-NDs/CC is uniformly modified by the PEI or PM molecules. Both STEM-EDX mapping of PEI@Pt-NDs on CC (Fig. 2C) and PM@Pt-NDs on CC (Fig. 2D) show patterns of Pt and N elemental maps are very similar, suggesting the uniform functionalization of Pt-NDs surface by PEI molecules and PM molecules. XRD patterns of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and PM@Pt-NDs/CC are very similar to that of Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. S6), which indicates that the crystallographic texture of Pt nanocrystals maintains constant after PEI and PM functionalization. Furthermore, TEM images of PEI@Pt-NDs on CC (Fig. 2E) and PM@Pt-NDs on CC (Fig. 2G) show that Pt-NDs retain the dendritic-like morphology after chemical functionalization. HRTEM images of PEI@Pt-NDs on CC (Fig. 2F) and PM@Pt-NDs on CC (Fig. 2H) show that the (111) plane of Pt-NDs also maintain well. Additionally, Pt 4f XPS spectra of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and PM@Pt-NDs/CC are very similar to that of Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. S7), which indicates that the oxidation state of Pt nanocrystals maintains constant after PEI and PM functionalization. The adsorption state of PEI and PM on Pt surface were also studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations image show a loose-packed PEI layer (Fig. 3 A) and loose-packed PM layer (Fig. 3B) on Pt surface due to the Pt-N interaction, respectively. Top views indicate that lots of holes exist in the PEI and PM layers, in which small molecules as reactants can contact with un-functionalized Pt surface freely. The electrochemical measurements further confirm that PEI and PM molecules on Pt surface don't cover completely all Pt active sites. After PEI and PM functionalization, ECSA of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. 3C) and PM@Pt-NDs/CC (Fig. 3D) are calculated to be 26.5 m2 g−1 Pt and 27.8 m2 g−1 Pt, indicating the surface coverage of PEI and PM layers on Pt-NDs/CC are 34.1% and 31.0%, respectively. Such ECSA values confirm that PEI and PM layers on Pt surface are loose-packed, which allows the penetration of reactant freely."
10,HER performance of cathodic PEI@Pt-NDs/CC,"3.3 HER performance of cathodic PEI@Pt-NDs/CC The HER activity of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC was first measured in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte and compared with Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC under the same experimental conditions. All potentials were referred to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves reveal that the onset potential (E onset) of HER at PEI@Pt-NDs/CC is higher than that at Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC (Fig. 4 A). The HER potentials at the current density of 20 mA cm−2 at PEI@Pt-NDs/CC, Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC are about −0.008, −0.013 and −0.033 V, respectively. Obviously, the HER activity of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC is better than those of Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC. In particular, the HER activity of Pt-NDs/CC is significantly higher than that of Pt-NPs-JM, which is attributed to the unique morphological advantages of Pt-NDs/CC, such as dendritic-like structure and highly exposed surface. Compared to Pt-NDs/CC, HER activity enhancement of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC can be ascribed to PEI functionalization. According to the HER reaction mechanism in acidic media, the concentration of interfacial proton at the electrode/solution interface determine the E onset value of HER. Therefore, the proton enrichment at Pt surface will undeniably increase the E onset value of HER. EDX mapping, XPS and zeta potential results have confirmed the presence of PEI layer on PEI@Pt-NDs/CC surface. A great deal of free –NH2 groups from PEI molecules can catch H + from HClO4 electrolyte and then are completely protonated to produce –NH3+ groups, which will enhance the HER performance of Pt-NDs/CC due to proton enrichment at PEI@Pt/electrolyte interface [46,47]. The Tafel slope of the electrocatalyst for HER is a pivotal indicator to evaluate the HER kinetics. Tafel plots can be obtained by the Tafel equation through the LSV curves (Fig. 4B). Tafel slope of HER at PEI@Pt-NDs/CC is 27.2 mV dec− 1, similar to Pt-NDs/CC (33.1 mV dec−1) and Pt-NPs-JM/CC (30.2 mV dec−1), suggesting that all HER at three samples obey the Volmer–Tafel reaction mechanism. Considering the actual application prospect, the electrocatalytic stabilities of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC were evaluated with continuous LSV test. After 1000 LSV runs, PEI@Pt-NDs/CC shows no obviously potential shift in the LSV curve whereas Pt-NPs-JM/CC undergoes a potential shift of 10 mV. After the stability test, PEI@Pt-NDs/CC was further characterized with TEM (Fig. S8). The morphology of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC is well maintained, suggesting the good structural stability. On the one hand, Pt nanomaterials are chemically inert in HClO4 electrolyte, resulting in the good self-stability of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC. On the other hand, the 3D dendritic-like structure can effectively inhibit Ostwald ripening, which endows PEI@Pt-NDs/CC with structural stability. In addition, PEI is relatively stable in both the HClO4 electrolyte and electrochemical environment, which is also responsible for excellent electrocatalytic stability of PEI@Pt-NDs/CC."
11,FAOR performance of anodic PM@Pt-NDs/CC,"3.4 FAOR performance of anodic PM@Pt-NDs/CC The FAOR activity of electrocatalyst was conducted in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte with 0.1 M formic acid using CV technique (Fig. 5 A). There are both two oxidation peaks around 0.6 and 1.0 V at Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC, corresponding to dehydrogenation step and dehydration step, respectively. At the same mass loading amount, the oxidation peak current densities are 10.1/26.4 mA cm−2 for Pt-NDs/CC and 3.6/9.3 mA cm−2 for Pt-NPs-JM/CC at 0.6 and 1.0 V potentials, respectively. Impressively, the FAOR at PM@Pt-NDs/CC is mainly achieved through the dehydrogenation pathway. The current density is 28.5 mA cm−2 at 0.73 V potential, which is 2.8 and 8.1 times bigger than Pt-NDs/CC and Pt-NPs-JM/CC, respectively. The selectivity of PM@Pt-NDs/CC for the FAOR path is highly related to the surface functionalization of PM. On the surface of PM@Pt-NDs/CC, the adsorbed PM molecules can significantly isolate Pt atoms to form discontinuous Pt active sites, thereby controlling the adsorption configuration of formic acid and enhancing the dehydrogenation pathway of FAOR [23,48–50]. Moreover, the FAOR onset potential at PM@Pt-NDs/CC is 0.25 V, lower than those at Pt-NDs/CC (0.42 V) and Pt-NPs-JM/CC (0.43 V). The negative shift in the onset potential implies that the activation energy of FAOR decreases after absorbing PM on Pt-NDs/CC. The FAOR durability of PM@Pt-NDs/CC was investigated by chronoamperometry test (Fig. 5B). Compared with Pt-NPs-JM/CC, PM@Pt-NDs/CC consistently exhibit a higher current density for the FAOR during the 6000 s test, suggesting the outstanding electrochemical stability of PM@Pt-NDs/CC for FAOR. After the long-term stability tests, the TEM characterization show that PM@Pt-NDs/CC maintain their initial morphology (Fig. S9), as a result of the high chemical inertness of Pt nanocrystals under harsh conditions. And SEM images and SEM-EDX mapping patterns of production show N elemental maps are very similar to Pt, suggesting the strong interaction between Pt and N (Fig. S10)."
12,Electrochemical reforming of formic acid,"3.5 Electrochemical reforming of formic acid Taking advantages of the excellent performance of molecular-functionalized Pt-NDs/CC in both HER and FAOR, an electrolyzer cell for formic acid reforming was fabricated. Anode: HCOOH→CO2+2H++2e− Cathode: 2H++2e−→H2 Overall: HCOOH→CO2+H2 Above equations describe how an overall formic acid reforming process reacts on both anode and cathode. The electrolysis of formic acid was carried out in a two-electrode cell, in which cathode cell contained 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte and anode cell contained mixture electrolyte of 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M HCOOH. In order to highlight the advantage of PM@Pt-NDs/CC||PEI@Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer, the other two groups of electrolyzers (Pt-NDs/CC||Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer and Pt-NPs-JM/CC||Pt-NPs-JM/CC) were also fabricated to perform electrolysis of formic acid using LSV technique (Fig. 6 A). PM@Pt-NDs/CC||PEI@Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer only requires total voltage of 0.45 V to obtain current density of 10 mA cm−2. In contrast, Pt-NDs/CC||Pt-NDs/CC need total voltage of 0.78 V to obtain current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6A). This result indicates that PM@Pt-NDs/CC||PEI@Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer can afford higher energy conversion efficiency for formic acid reforming than Pt-NDs/CC||Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer. And this total voltage is also lower than that of Pt-NPs-JM/CC||Pt-NPs-JM/CC electrolyzer (1.02 V), conforming the advantages of PEI/PM functionalization and dendritic-like structure, again. Considering that the purpose of formic acid electrochemical reforming is to produce H2, the performance of traditional Pt-NPs-JM/CC||RuO2/CC WE electrolyzer was also measured. The obtained LSV curve shows that applying a potential of up to 1.59 V can drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, indicating that the energy consumption of traditional WE is much higher than formic acid electrochemical reforming on PM@Pt-NDs/CC||PEI@Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer. Obviously, the electrolysis voltage of formic acid electrochemical reforming is very low in energy consumption relative to that of WE and other small molecule oxidation assisted WE technology (Table 1 ). To evaluate stability and practicality, chronoamperometry measurement of PM@Pt-NDs/CC||PEI@Pt-NDs/CC was performed in an H-typed electrolyzer cell at 0.78 V potential (Fig. 6B). There is minor current decrease within 10 h, further confirming its good stability of Pt-NDs/CC and showing a bright potential for future practical application."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, Pt-NDs/CC was successfully prepared by in situ growth method based on the precipitation-reduction strategy. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of Pt-NDs/CC, the metal-organic interface engineering was applied, in which the surface of Pt-NDs was intentionally modified with PEI or PM. The as-prepared PEI@Pt-NDs/CC and PM@Pt-NDs/CC served as electrocatalysts for HER and FAOR, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the interfacial proton enrichment and the isolation of Pt active sites, respectively. For PM@Pt-NDs/CC||PEI@Pt-NDs/CC electrolyzer, the formic acid electrochemical reforming only required 0.45 V to achieve H2 production, which greatly exceeded that of Pt-JM/CC||RuO2/CC electrolyzer used in traditional WE technique (1.59 V). This work not only achieved the efficient production of H2, but also demonstrated that the rational design of metal−organic interface could efficaciously improve the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of nanocatalysts. Overall, the chemical functionalization of metallic nanocatalyst with organic molecule could effectively contribute to the design of cutting-edge electrocatalytic systems. Of course, the chemical functionalization strategy also faced enormous challenges, which included the good knowledge of electrocatalytic reaction mechanism, comprehensive interface theory, and advanced physicochemical characterization at metal−organic interface."
