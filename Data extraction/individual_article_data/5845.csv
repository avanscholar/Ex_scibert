0,Introduction,"Direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFCs) are electrochemical devices of great interest because of the high energy density and nontoxicity of their reactants, as well as of the possibility of operating at low temperatures, empowering their application in the transportation and portable sectors [1,2]. DBFCs generate electricity by direct oxidation of borohydride ion (BH4 −) and reduction of a gaseous or liquid oxidant. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), a non-hydrocarbon source, is employed as a liquid fuel in the anolyte solution thus avoiding carbon dioxide emissions as it occurs in alcohol-fed fuel cells. Liquid hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is preferred over gaseous oxygen as oxidant in the catholyte solution as its faster reduction kinetics enables higher power density and widens the application of DBFCs to oxygen absent environments (underwater and space) [3–5]. A membrane is essential to separate the fuel cell anodic and cathodic compartments with different electrolyte media and to allow a good ion transport, thus keeping the charge balance in the cell. Anion-exchange membranes (AEM) can easily transport OH− from cathode to anode compartments, but tend to decrease the cell efficiency due to the BH4 − crossover. In contrast, cation exchange membranes (CEM) can limit the BH4 − crossover because of the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged polymer backbone of CEM and negative charge of BH4 − [3]. When a CEM is used, Na+ ion acts as the charge carrier, crossing from anode to cathode compartment. Among CEM, perfluorinated membranes show good ionic conductivity, chemical and mechanical stability [3,5,6]. Nafion® membranes are a type of perfluorinated CEM that is employed in the majority of DBFCs [5,7]. However, Nafion® membranes are made in a complex and expensive process, inhibiting their widespread commercialization [8,9]. Therefore, their replacement by cost-effective polymer membranes is highly desirable [3,5]. Development of fuel cell membranes comprises polymers blending, polymers sulfonation and incorporation of doping agents in the polymer matrix, such as porous inorganic materials and advanced carbon materials with the aim of replacing benchmark Nafion® membranes [9,10]. Non-perfluorinated based polymers, such as poly (benzimidazole) (PBI), poly (ether ether ketone) (PEEK), poly (styrene) (PS) and poly (arylene ether sulfone) (PSU), are among the most studied polymers used to prepare new alternative membranes [9–11]. However, these polymers are usually subjected to several chemical modifications, including sulfonation, requiring the use of several reagents, hazardous organic solvents, temperature and time, which turns the overall process complex, expensive and environmentally harmful. Thereby, from the technological and commercial point of view, it is more desirable to use simpler and cheaper polymers, such as poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), to make polymer blends than developing new complex polymers or modifying commercial membranes [9,12–14]. Moreover, the polymeric membrane, together with the catalysts, is one of the most important components of a DBFC. Thus, if the membrane cost is reduced, it is expected that DBFC systems will be closer to commercialization [3,15]. PVA is a cheap, non-toxic and biodegradable polymer that is recognized by its good film-forming ability, hydrophilicity, chemical stability, holding high density functional OH groups with potential for chemical crosslinking and adhesive properties [9,16,17]. Therefore, PVA is broadly used in industrial, commercial and medical applications. However, the semi-crystalline and rigid nature of PVA limits its ionic conductivity and hence its application as polymer electrolyte for fuel cells. Thus, blending with other polymers or adding doping agents is necessary to overcome this drawback [9,13,16]. For example, blending of PVA with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) is favored through hydrogen interactions between hydroxyl side groups of PVA and ether linkage of PEO chains [18]. PEO is a polymer studied in the preparation of polymer electrolyte systems in the field of energy devices due to its flexibility, low toxicity and ionic conductivity improvement [19,20]. PEO can also solvate lithium salts and be used as crosslinker to improve both chemical and hydrolytic stability [18–21]. Another polymer presenting a good interaction with PVA is the poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), as a result of the anticipated hydrogen bonding formation between the proton-accepting carbonyl moiety of PVP rings and the hydroxyl side groups of PVA [22]. PVP is a non-toxic amorphous material that allows faster ionic mobility compared to other semi-crystalline polymers, whose introduction as a copolymer with PVA seems to enhance the oxidative stability of the obtained membrane [23,24]. However, it has been pointed out that PVA/PVP blends suffer from excessive water swelling [12]. A common strategy for improving the membrane properties (thermal, mechanical, dimensional, oxidative stability, fuel crossover hindering and ionic conductivity) is the introduction of doping agents into polymer matrices to produce composite membranes [8,10,25,26]. Graphene oxide (GO) incorporation into polymer matrices has been particularly attractive for fuel cell applications due to its mechanical strength, large surface area, chemical stability, fuel crossover barrier and electron-insulating environment [10,27]. GO contains hydrophilic oxygenated functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxylic acid and epoxy) and a two-dimensional flat layer suitable for water adsorption and thus for formation of proton conduction channels [8,10,11]. Upon incorporation of GO into a polymer matrix such as PVA, hydrogen bonding can be formed between the hydroxyl groups of PVA chains and the oxygen-containing groups of GO nanosheets [16]. This hydrogen bonding compacts the membrane structure, avoiding excess of water uptake and swelling degree [16,18,27]. Further enhancement of ionic conductivity of composite membranes containing GO is possible through sulfonation of GO. Sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), besides having oxygen-containing groups, holds sulfonic acid groups in GO sheets, increasing the number of ion conducting sites and thus further improving the membranes ionic conductivity [8,28]. Although SGO has been mostly proposed as doping agent on modified/sulfonated PBI and PEEK polymer matrices, the introduction of SGO in PVA-based matrices has been reported to significantly improve its physicochemical properties [29]. Furthermore, membranes containing PVA doped with SGO were successfully prepared using facile techniques (casting) and applied as electrolytes for PEMFCs with competitive performance [29]. These results suggest the SGO doping as a promising alternative to use of complex polymers and multi-step fabrication. Likewise, it is possible to develop composite membranes using PVA and other simple polymers incorporating SGO to achieve enhanced physicochemical properties with interest for DBFC application as well. In this work, both the materials and the overall process for building composite membranes are based on a sustainable approach (simple polymers, easy processing, water as the main solvent and low energy consumption) in order to contribute to a more sustainable and cost-effective DBFC. PVA was chosen as the main polymer of the blend membrane due to its ability to form films with PEO and PVP polymers, for being an available and eco-friendly material. SGO was obtained from expanded graphite (EG) and incorporated as doping agent in different amounts into the new crosslinked polymer to produce novel nanocomposite membranes, assigned as PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO, for testing as a polymer membrane in a laboratory NaBH4–H2O2 DBFC. It is expected that interaction between acidic SGO doping agent, which includes sulfonic acid groups, and the novel acid-base crosslinked polymer can promote the membranes’ mechanical resistance, ionic conductivity, oxidative stability and to hinder the BH4 − fuel crossover, while reducing excessive water uptake, thereby improving the general performance of DBFCs using such membranes."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The following polymers were used as received, without any purification step, to prepare the polymer blend membranes: poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA, average MW: 77,000 g mol−1, degree of hydrolysis: 99%, Qualikems Fine Chem), poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO, average MW: 900,000 g mol−1, Acros Organics) and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, average MW: 29,000 g mol−1, SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH). Glutaraldehyde (GA) (50 wt% in water, Alfa Aesar) and 4-sulfophthalic acid (SPA) (50 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as crosslinkers. Expanded graphite (EG, Sigma-Aldrich), H2SO4 (98 wt%, Spectrum Chemical MFG Corp), KMnO4 (99%, Spectrum Chemical MFG Corp) and sulfanilic acid (99 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to synthesize sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO). The solutions for fuel cell tests were prepared using NaBH4 (98 wt%, Scharlau), NaOH (AkzoNobel), H2O2 (40 wt%, LabChem) and HCl (37 wt%, AnalaR Normapur, VWR Chemicals). All aqueous solutions were prepared using Millipore water."
3,Synthesis of sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO),"2.2 Synthesis of sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) GO was prepared according to Hummers' method with some modifications [30]. Briefly, 5 g of expanded graphite (EG) was added to a round-bottom flask containing 100 mL of H2SO4 (98 wt%) under stirring in an ice-water bath. Then, 15 g of KMnO4 was added very slowly and the reaction mixture kept under continuous stirring until a uniform liquid paste was formed. The flask was removed from the bath and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature until a foam was formed. 400 mL of deionized water was slowly added to the mixture and placed in a water bath at 90 °C for 1 h, generating a yellow suspension. The suspension was ultrasonicated for GO dispersion. It was next filtered and subjected to repeated runs of washing/centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 2 h per cycle) to separate the unexfoliated graphite. Sulfonation of GO was based on previously reported procedures [31]. Namely, GO was added to sulfanilic acid solution (0.06 M) at 70 °C followed by dropwise addition of sodium nitrite (6 × 10−3 M) under continuous stirring. The mixture was held at 70 °C for several hours, then centrifuged and thoroughly washed with deionized water, and finally dried in vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight."
4,Preparation of crosslinked polymers and SGO-polymer nanocomposite membranes,"2.3 Preparation of crosslinked polymers and SGO-polymer nanocomposite membranes The PVA/PEO/PVP crosslinked polymers composition was set as 84:5:11 wt%. Each polymer was dissolved in a separate beaker. PVA (10 g) was dissolved in deionized water (100 mL) at 90 °C under vigorous stirring. PEO (5 g) was dissolved in a mixture of ethanol/water (20:80 vol%, 100 mL) at 50 °C. PVP (10 g) was dissolved in deionized water (100 mL) under stirring at room temperature. Subsequently, polymer solutions (80 mL of PVA solution, 10 mL of PEO solution, 10 mL of PVP solution) were mixed together under vigorous stirring to make a homogeneous polymer blend. The blend was divided into three portions and aqueous suspension of SGO doping agent was added to two of them in amounts of 1 and 3 wt% in respect to PVA. Then, the mixtures were stirred vigorously for several hours until uniform dispersion of SGO. Crosslinking agents, GA (5 g) and SPA (5 g) were added to the mixtures and stirring was kept for additional 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the mixtures were poured into clean Petri dishes and left to dry at room temperature to allow solvents evaporation (casting method) [19,24]. Depending on the doping agent wt.%, the prepared membranes are marked as PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-1 (1 wt%) and PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 (3 wt%), and the membrane without SGO is referred as PVA/PEO/PVP. Commercial Nafion®117 membrane from DuPont (Wilmington, DE) was used for comparison in fuel cell performance tests."
5,Characterization of SGO and SGO-polymer nanocomposite membranes,"2.4 Characterization of SGO and SGO-polymer nanocomposite membranes 2.4.1 Morphology and structural analysis Morphology and composition of SGO was investigated by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX, JEOL SM 6360 LA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Phi 5300 ESCA) were used to elucidate the structure of SGO. Raman spectroscopy (SENTERRA, Bruker) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Schimadzu-7000, using a CuKα radiation operating at 30 kV and 30 mA and scanning rate of 4° min−1) were employed to differentiate the structure of SGO from the expanded graphite. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Shimadzu FTIR-8400 S) was used to identify the polymers in the blend membranes and the presence of SGO as added doping agent. XRD was also used to characterize membranes under the influence of SGO addition. 2.4.2 Thermal and mechanical analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the membranes was conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer (Shimadzu TGA-50). The samples were heated from 25 °C to 600 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The tensile strength of the membrane is related with the stress applied until membrane breaking. This parameter was measured at room temperature in dry state using Lloyd Instruments LR10k. The measurements were repeated three times for each membrane and the average value is reported. 2.4.3 Contact angle, water uptake and swelling ratio Contact angle between water drop and membrane surface was measured to assess the hydrophilicity of the membranes surface. For this purpose, a contact-angle analyzer (Rame-Hart Instrument Co. model 500-FI) was used. For determination of water uptake (WU) and swelling ratio (SR), dry polymeric membranes samples were cut, weighed and their dimensions were measured. The samples were then immersed in deionized water for 24 h, softly dried with tissue paper and weighed again. The WU and SR of the membranes were calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively, (1) W U ( % ) = W w e t − W d r y W d r y × 100 (2) S R ( % ) = L w e t − L d r y L d r y × 100 where W wet and W dry is the weight of wet and dry membranes, and L wet and L dry is the length of wet and dry membranes, respectively. 2.4.4 Oxidative stability The oxidative stability was tested by measuring the weight loss of the membrane samples (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) in Fenton's reagent (3 wt% H2O2 containing 2 ppm FeSO4) at 68 °C for 24 h [9]. To evaluate the chemical stability of these membranes in practical fuel cell aqueous electrolyte solutions, membranes samples were introduced in solutions simulating the DBFC anolyte (1 M NaBH4 in 4 M NaOH) and catholyte (5 M H2O2 in 1.5 M HCl) during 48 h. 2.4.5 Ion exchange capacity, ionic conductivity and borohydride crossover The measurement of the ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the prepared membranes was done using acid-base titration. First, the samples were placed in 50 mL of 2 M NaCl solution for 48 h to replace the H+ ions by Na+ ions. The solution containing the released H+ ions was then titrated with 0.01 M NaOH solution using phenolphthalein indicator. IEC was calculated from Eq. (3), (3) I E C ( m e q / g ) = V N a O H × C N a O H W d r y where C NaOH, V NaOH, and W dry are the concentration of the NaOH titrant solution, the volume of NaOH consumed, and the weight of the dry membrane sample, respectively. To determine the ionic conductivity of each membrane, resistance measurements were carried out by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique using a PAR 273A potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Inc.) coupled to a SI 1255 HF frequency response analyzer (FRA, Schlumberger Solartron). Before tests, membrane samples were immersed in 4 M NaOH solution at room temperature for 30 min in order to simulate the pH conditions of the fuel compartment of the DBFC [17,31]. The samples were fitted between two stainless steel electrodes and the spectra were acquired at open circuit potential with signal amplitude of 5 mV in frequency range of 100 Hz - 100 kHz. Membranes' resistance is represented by the high-frequency intercept on the real axis of the complex impedance plot. Membranes’ ionic conductivity was determined from resistance according to Eq. (4) [32], (4) σ = d R A where σ is the membrane ionic conductivity (S cm−1), A is the geometric area of the membrane (cm2), d (cm) is its thickness and R (Ω) is the membrane resistance. To determine the permeability of the membranes towards borohydride anion (BH4 −), the membrane samples were fixed vertically in a glass diffusion cell between two reservoirs of 100 mL each. The first reservoir (donor reservoir, A) was filled with 1 M NaBH4 in 4 M NaOH solution (a typical anolyte for the DBFC), and the second reservoir (receptor reservoir, B) was filled with deionized water. BH4 − diffuses from A to B through the membrane due to the concentration difference between the two reservoirs. An inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES, model Prodigy, Teledyne Leeman Labs) monitored the concentration of boron element from the BH4 − ions entering the water reservoir (B). The crossover of BH4 − from A to B as a function of time was calculated by Eq. (5), (5) C B ( t ) = A V B P L C A ( t = t 0 ) ( t − t 0 ) where A is the diffusion area (cm2), L is the membrane thickness (cm), V B is the volume of the receptor reservoir (cm3), C A and C B are the BH4 −concentrations (mol L−1) in the reservoirs A and B, respectively, the interval (t - t 0) is the time of the BH4 − crossover and P is the BH4 − permeability of the membrane (cm2 s−1). The membranes' selectivity (the ratio of ionic conductivity to the BH4 − permeability) was also calculated, as it can provide important information on fuel cell performance. 2.4.6 Fuel cell performance A lab fuel cell was assembled to assess the DBFC performance using the prepared membranes. Prior to the cell performance tests, membranes were stored in 0.5 M NaCl solution for 24 h and then pre-activated in 2 M NaOH for 4 h [33]. A Pt foil (1 cm2 active surface area, Metrohm) was immersed in 100 mL of 1 M NaBH4 in 4 M NaOH anolyte solution. In the cathodic side, a Pt coil (∼5 cm2) was immersed in 100 mL of 5 M H2O2 in 1.5 M HCl solution [34]. The two fuel cell compartments were vertically separated by each one of the tested membranes with an active area of 50 cm2. The fuel cell experiments were run in potentiostatic mode at room conditions."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of SGO,"3.1 Characterization of SGO Fig. 1 a shows the FTIR spectra of EG and SGO materials. EG spectrum displays stretching vibration bands at 1620 cm−1 and around 3419 cm−1 representing CO and –OH groups, respectively [35]. The band appearing at 2337 cm−1 is due to the carbon dioxide. For the SGO, a large band around 3404 cm−1 that is characteristic of stretching vibration of O–H of the carboxylic acid and phenol groups can be detected. The bands at 1705 cm−1 and at 1284 cm−1 can be attributed to the CO of the carboxylic acid and to epoxy groups, respectively [36]. The sulfonic group is represented by the symmetric stretching vibration band at 1068 cm−1 and by the asymmetric stretching band at 1176 cm−1 [36,37]. Hydrogen wagging out-of-plane of the SGO rings also appears at 862 cm−1 [38]. Raman spectroscopy results confirm the successful synthesis of the SGO (Fig. 1b). D band at 1362 cm−1, which indicates the defects of carbon lattice, and G band at 1610 cm−1, that is referred to the in-plane stretching vibration of the sp2 hybridized carbons, are identified for SGO [28]. A higher value of ID/IG obtained for SGO (1.4) compared to that of EG (0.2) indicates the higher lattice disorder induced by the sulfonation of GO [27]. Sulfonation of GO is also evidenced in the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1c. A broad peak appears at 2θ of 26°, indicating partial GO sheets restacking through π−π interaction upon sulfonation of GO [38]. EDX results presented in Table 1 indicate the successful oxidation and sulfonation of EG to SGO. That is confirmed by the XPS analysis of SGO in a wide scan range (Fig. 1d), which shows the absorption peaks of C (285 eV) and O (532 eV), as well as the absorption peak of S (168 eV) corresponding to SO3H. Thus, the present work demonstrates successful preparation of SGO bearing abundant SO3H functional groups. SEM analysis reveals that SGO sheets (Fig. 2 a) obtained from EG are micro sized in X–Y planes and have nanometric thickness (Fig. 2b). For a better elucidation of the SGO sheets, an image obtained from TEM is depicted in Fig. 2c. SGO reveals a wrinkled transparent flake-like morphology that is in accordance with the previous reports [39]."
8,Characterization of membranes,"3.2 Characterization of membranes 3.2.1 Morphology and structural analysis The polymer blend is built from the PVA hydroxyl groups bonded to the PEO and PVP functional groups through hydrogen bonds. The membranes prepared were covalently crosslinked by using glutaraldehyde, with acetal or hemiacetal reactions occurring between the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, and were ionically crosslinked by 4-sulfophthalic acid via dehydration (esterification) between the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups (Fig. 3 ). The linkage between the polymers and oxygen-containing groups from SGO, in which the sulfonic acid groups are included, generates a higher number of ion conducting sites and a better interfacial adhesion due to more hydrogen bonds forming and acid base interaction between sulfonic groups and amine groups of PVP, thus resulting in an increase of the membranes ionic conductivity and mechanical resistance. The morphology of the blend membranes prepared with and without incorporation of SGO was evaluated by SEM analysis (Fig. 4 ). The surface of the blend membrane without SGO contains pores (Fig. 4a) due to the low MW PVP, which was chosen as a pore-forming agent [40]. This PVP of lower viscosity (due to the low MW) will produce more voids and pores, thus leading to higher ionic conductivity [41], in contrast with a flat and smoother surface of the membrane blend containing SGO, as illustrated for PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 (Fig. 4c), which suggests that SGO as doping agent can exert a linkage effect through hydrogen bonding with the polymer blend [18]. Images of the membranes internal structure allow the identification of the defects of the undoped membrane (Fig. 4b), whereas a layered and compact structure provided by SGO can be observed for PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 (Fig. 4d). This feature is of utmost importance for reducing the fuel crossover and water retention, improving the ionic transport and the overall fuel cell performance [37]. The FTIR spectra of undoped and doped membranes show two middle broad bands, Fig. 5 a. The first middle broad band at ca. 1900 cm−1 can be justified as an overlap of bands from hydrogen bonding between –OH of PVA and oxygen functional groups of PEO and PVP [24]. The second middle broad band at ca. 2300 cm−1 is due to the C–H bonds of the polymers [18]. These bands widen in the presence of SGO and with its increasing content. A band around 3700 cm−1 is characteristic of hydroxyl group of PVA polymer as it is the main component in the polymer membrane [19]. Intensity of a band around 1527 cm−1 rises with increasing SGO content and it can be assigned to the interactions between PVP and oxygen-containing groups of the SGO through hydrogen bonding [42]. The absence of the sulfonic group band in the spectra is normally due to the low content of SGO doping agent added to the polymer membrane [43]. XRD patterns of the membranes depicted in Fig. 5b reveal a low crystallinity of the undoped blend membrane that might be due the presence of the three polymers. The two broad peaks at 2θ of 19° and 23° are typical of PVA-PEO and PEO-PVP polymer blends, respectively [18,43]. As expected, SGO incorporation in the blend matrix reduces the crystallinity of the membrane as only one broad peak appears at 2θ of 23° for PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-1 membrane and it is shifted to 19° for PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane. This is an important feature to facilitate ion transport as the increase of amorphous regions usually leads to a higher ionic conductivity [35]. 3.2.2 Thermal and mechanical analysis TGA thermograms of polymer blend membranes with and without SGO are represented in Fig. 5c. The initial weight loss at ∼100 °C (∼5%) can be attributed to the evaporation of moisture or water adsorbed on all membranes [13,44]. The second stage of membranes decomposition occurs in the temperature range 100–244 °C and it is due to the degradation of the oxygen functional groups [45,46]. The third decomposition stage is represented by a noticeable weight loss observed in the temperature range 244–490 °C and it is related to the decomposition of polymers chains [18,44]. It starts at 244 °C for the membrane without SGO with weight loss of ∼70%, while for the membranes containing SGO, it starts later, at 320 °C, with weight loss of ∼60%. This behavior indicates that the presence of SGO improved thermal stability of membranes by hydrogen bonding with PVA/PEO/PVP polymers. The incorporation of SGO generally enhances the mechanical properties of the polymer matrix [47]. As shown in Table 2 , the addition of SGO into the polymer matrix gradually increased the thickness of the membranes and tensile strength increased from 2.7 to 38.3 MPa. The good interaction between characteristic groups of SGO, i.e., hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, and sulfonic, and the functional groups of the polymers through hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds clearly improved the interfacial adhesion in the membranes containing SGO which results in a better breaking resistance when compared to the undoped membrane [16,47,48]. Table 2 also compares the properties of the prepared membranes with those of benchmark Nafion®117 [49]. 3.2.3 Contact angle, water uptake and swelling ratio The behavior of the membranes in contact with water is also illustrated in Table 2. It is known that a surface is considered more hydrophobic when contact angle is ≥ 90° and more hydrophilic when it is < 90°. The membranes hydrophobic character becomes more pronounced with higher thickness, owing to SGO increasing content [50]. Also, as the SGO presence in the membrane matrix increases from 1% to 3%, the water uptake, as well as the swelling ratio of the polymer membranes, are reduced. These features are important as water overload can be avoided while enabling higher ionic conductivity [29]. In other words, the mass gain and dimension enlargement of SGO-containing membranes are lowered as SGO leads to a more compact structure, thus limiting water overload in the polymer matrix channels when compared to membrane without SGO [28,48,51]. 3.2.4 Oxidative stability The chemical stability of the membranes was assessed by several different tests. Remaining weight of membranes towards Fenton's reagent (oxidative stability) is presented in Table 2. Undoped membrane exhibits the lowest oxidation stability. On the other hand, incorporation of SGO results in a clear improvement of membrane resistance to OH and OOH radicals attack. PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane remains almost intact (RW of 99%), showing notably higher stability compared to the undoped membrane, indicating that SGO provides chemical stability to the polymer matrix, protecting it from the oxidizing agents [44,45]. Membranes stability is also evaluated in aqueous solutions commonly used in DBFCs. All the membranes are found to be stable in strongly alkaline NaBH4 solution during 48 h. However, for the same period, only the SGO-doped membranes demonstrate stability in acidic media containing H2O2. The results of the chemical stability tests in simulated DBFC conditions evidence that SGO-containing membranes are suitable for practical DBFC application. 3.2.5 IEC, ionic conductivity and borohydride crossover The measured IEC values are reported in Table 3 and it can be seen that values for SGO-containing membranes are higher (0.15 meq g−1) than that of undoped membrane (0.10 meq g−1), which is an indicator that polymer matrix holds additional exchangeable acidic groups from SGO [38]. This is related to the better ionic conductivity of PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 (27.3 mS cm−1) and PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-1 (24.6 mS cm−1) when compared to the blend membrane without SGO incorporation (13.1 mS cm−1) (Table 3), as sulfonic sites of SGO contribute to a charge increase and thus to a faster ionic conduction in the polymer matrix channels [27,38,48]. The SGO optimum amount in membranes generally ranges between 1 and 5% [28,42,44,47]. In the prepared composite membranes, increasing the SGO content from 1% to 3% does not change significantly the IEC values and slightly improves the ionic conductivity. This suggests that a higher density of functional groups of SGO in PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 present an obstacle for Na+ ions retention and transfer. Thus, the optimum SGO content is assumed to be 3%. Regarding the membrane permeability, it is found that the incorporation of SGO into the polymer blend limits the BH4 − crossover. As can be seen in Table 3, the BH4 − crossover in the undoped PVA/PEO/PVP blend membrane (21 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) decreases upon introduction of SGO into the blend by two orders of magnitude (to 0.18× 10−6 cm2 s−1) for PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane. This permeability value is even lower than that reported for Nafion®117 membrane [52]. The decrease of the BH4 − fuel permeability of the membrane containing SGO can be attributed to the physical action of SGO in narrowing the polymer matrix channels, which reduces the water absorption, and also to the repelling ability against the negatively charged species, such as the BH4 − fuel [48,51,53,54]. Hence, the exceptionally higher selectivity observed for PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 (1.52 × 105 S cm−3 s) in comparison to the undoped membrane (0.006 × 105 S cm−3 s) also indicates that the prepared composite membranes are suitable for borohydride fuel cells [47]. 3.2.6 Fuel cell performance The performance of the best composite membrane (PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3) as polymer electrolyte membrane was tested in a lab-scale DBFC. Nafion®117 membrane sample of the same size was also tested for comparison purposes. It was not possible to test the undoped membrane as it turned too soft to handle after its storage and pre-treatment stages. Thus, it was very difficult to hold the membrane between the anode and cathode compartments, with the risk of potential anolyte and catholyte mixing. This inconvenience is not observed for the SGO-doped membranes, which recalls once again the ability of SGO to reinforce the mechanical properties of the polymer blend. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the DBFC using the PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane was ca. 100 mV lower than that using Nafion®117 (Fig. 6 ). OCV values lower than the value of standard cell voltage of a DBFC operating with acidified catholyte result from the evolution of hydrogen generated by BH4 − hydrolysis at the anode and/or the evolution of oxygen generated by H2O2 decomposition at the cathode side. Possible higher H+/OH− crossover through composite membrane compared to Nafion®117 also results in lower pH gradient in DBFC with composite membrane compared to the one with Nafion and, thus, in lower OCV. Nafion is a cation exchange polymer membrane that possesses a negatively charged polymer backbone and exchangeable cations (e.g., Na+, H+). The negatively charged backbone of Nafion membrane repels the anionic species (such as BH4 − and OH−) in the DBFC system and thus restricts their movements across it. The crossing of BH4 − affects fuel utilization efficiency of a DBFC and that of H+/OH− affects the reduction potential of oxidants [55]. Although the composite membrane is originally made of non-ionic polymers, it becomes a proton exchange membrane upon the addition of SPA (as both ionic crosslinker and sulfonating agent, converting PVA to sulfonated poly (vinyl alcohol) in the polymer blend [56,57]) and of SGO. Sulfonic groups attached to the membrane backbone lead to the increase of ionic conductivity and facilitate cations transfer via Grotthuss-type mechanism, the same through which proton transfer through Nafion®117 membrane occurs [55], although in a higher extent in the latter. As BH4 − undergoes hydrolysis in neutral and acidic media, first DBFCs operated with both alkaline anolyte and catholyte solutions. However, the reduction potential of the oxidant, whether it is O2 or H2O2, is lower in alkaline media than in acidic media (according to Eqs. (6) and (7) [58]), resulting in lower cell voltage of the alkaline DBFC compared to the alkaline-acid DBFC. (6) E(O2) = 1.23–0.059 pH (7) E(H2O2) = 1.78–0.059 pH Hence, performing BH4 − oxidation in alkaline media with O2 (or H2O2) reduction in acidic media is being suggested [59,60]. Still, realization of this idea in practice poses some challenges, as within authors previous work alkaline-acid DBFC was found to be stable for only 6 h [61]. The low stability results from the benchmark Nafion®117 membrane permeability to H+ ions, leading to gradual change of the pH values of the anolyte and catholyte. Besides the inconvenient of BH4 − parasitic hydrolysis, the increase of catholyte pH value also leads to significant decrease of H2O2 reduction potential. As for the herein prepared composite membrane, and despite its lower BH4 − permeability in comparison to Nafion®117, it is believed that the OH− transport through hydrogen bonds across the membrane is the main reason for the lower OCV. As mentioned, Nafion®117 has high repulsion for OH−, as a result of higher number of acidic sites (higher IEC). Thus, the OH− transfer should be higher in the composite membrane, especially with the high concentration of NaOH (4 M) used in the anodic side of the fuel cell. The OH− crossover into the cathodic side leads to a local pH increase, which decreases the reduction potential of H2O2 (Eq. (7)) and consequently decreases the fuel cell voltage. Polarization curves indicate that PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane leads to lower DBFC discharge currents when compared to Nafion®117, possibly due to higher charge density and ionic conductivity of Nafion®117 (according to the data in Table 3) and, to some extent, to the slower transfer of Na+ ions across the PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane, which limits the electrode reactions [3,7]. Nevertheless, the resulting peak power density (Pmax) of DBFC with PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane (65 mW cm−2) is close to that of DBFC with Nafion®117 (81 mW cm−2) and with other commercial membranes previously tested by our group using similar DBFC set-up conditions (<90 mW cm−2) [7]."
9,Conclusions,"Low-cost composite membranes were successfully prepared via easy blending, crosslinking and casting methods employing widely available polymers with low toxicity. It was shown that the introduction of SGO doping agent into the polymer blend plays an important role in improving the membranes properties, such as mechanical stability, ionic conductivity and reduction of water overload. Additionally, oxidative stability and BH4 − crossover hindering was enhanced, especially in the composite membrane with 3% of SGO. In fact, PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 membrane demonstrated a borohydride permeability lower than that reported for Nafion®117, rendering an overall higher selectivity. Peak power density of DBFC with PVA/PEO/PVP-SGO-3 was found to be 65 mW cm−2, which was close to that of DBFC with Nafion®117 (81 mW cm−2) under the same testing conditions. Although further research is needed, such as testing different polymer ratios in the blend, these composite membranes developed on a sustainable chemistry perspective can be efficient polymer electrolyte membranes towards the development of cost-effective DBFCs."
