0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds that exist in many chemical compounds is considered as one of the most valuable and key technologies in biology, chemistry and many industrial processes [1,2]. α,β-unsaturated aldehydes belong to the typical chemical compounds with unsaturated CO and CC bonds, and their selective hydrogenation to unsaturated alcohols has been considered as an essential step in the preparation of various fine chemicals [3]. Since hydrogenation of CC bond is much more favorable than that of CO bond, both thermodynamically and kinetically [4], one has witnessed a great deal of efforts in designing appropriate catalytic systems that promote the selective hydrogenation of CO bond [5,6]. Metal catalysts are often used in hydrogenation reactions. However, the use of metal catalysts still faces many challenges [7,8]. For example, when α,β-unsaturated aldehydes adsorb on metals, competitive adsorption through the CC and CO parts usually occurs [9]. To solve this problem, additives, ligands and functional supports as well are often introduced [10,11]. But still, it is very difficult to predict and control the impact of foreign species on the catalytic reaction behaviors. Besides this, the previously reported selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes process always involves cumbersome operations, addition of a volatile organic solvent, and even employment of H2, which cause chemical pollution and bring about potential danger [12–14]. Therefore, it is highly necessary to develop new catalytic systems for an improved selective hydrogenation of CO bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Comparing to other hydrogenation methods, transfer hydrogenation does not need gaseous H2, thus showing more safety. Moreover, the experimental process is easy to control because the influence of H2 pressure on selectivity is not relevant to transfer hydrogenation [15]. Previous reports have shown that carbonyl compounds can be converted to their corresponding alcohols by transfer hydrogenation reaction over non-precious metal or their oxidized forms heterogeneous catalysts, such as nickel-based catalysts, zirconium-based compounds, Co2O3, and so on [7,16,17]. There are still some problems with these catalytic systems, such as complicated preparation process and the introduction of organic ligands in the catalytic system. As a kind of abundant and important functional materials, Al-based compounds have also been proved to show catalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation reaction [18–20]. In this work, we report on a novel catalytic system, namely, crystalline/amorphous Al/Al2O3 core/shell nanospheres. Such a system has shown an excellent selectivity in transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes when compared to other aluminum-based materials. A detailed characterization of the as- prepared samples has been conducted, and the effects of various experimental parameters on the selectivity of products were systematically investigated, where the nature of the promoted selectivity for transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes was revealed."
1,Experimental,"The synthesis of crystalline/amorphous Al/Al2O3 core/shell nanospheres involved two steps, i.e. the electrical explosion of an aluminum wire and a subsequent automatic oxidation in air. Full experimental details for the synthesis and characterization of Al/Al2O3 core/shell nanospheres, and the catalytic testing procedure applied are described in the Supporting information."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Characterization of the prepared catalytic material,"3.1 Characterization of the prepared catalytic material SEM and TEM images shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (a, b) reveal that the as-prepared catalytic material consists of small spherical particles. Particle size distribution further confirms an average grain size of 100 nm (Fig. S2). A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image was recorded in order to investigate the microstructure of the nanospheres. The HRTEM image shown in Fig. S3 gives a clear crystalline lattice with an interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm that matches well the lattice distance of plane (111) of Al metal [21]. From the enlarged TEM images (Fig. 1b), one can clearly observe the existence of a light gray layer on the surface of nanospheres with a thickness of 3.2 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. S4b). These surface layers did not show any diffraction fringe, suggesting an amorphous feature. In Fig. S5, four diffraction peaks are observed at 2 theta = 38.3, 44.6, 64.9, and 78.0°, which can be assigned, respectively, to the planes (111), (200), (220) and (311) as indicated by the standard data file of metal Al [22]. The broad peak in the enlarged XRD pattern (inset, Fig. S5) illustrates the presence of an amorphous component. All the above described results indicate that Al/Al2O3 nanospheres were likely composed of crystalline Al covered by amorphous Al2O3. The surface structure of the catalytic material was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Full spectrum demonstrates the presence of Al and O elements only (Fig. S6). No other XPS signals were observed except for C (adventitious carbon) at a binding energy of 284.6 eV; the latter one was used to calibrate the charge effect. Al 2p spectrum in Fig. S7 shows two XPS peaks: The first one at 72.3 eV is assigned to Al0, while the second one at 74.6 eV belongs to Al3+ [21,23]. The signal intensity ratio of Al0 to Al3+ is calculated to be 0.39:1 (Table S1), which means that Al3+ is enriched onto the surface of the sample. The presence of enriched Al3+ species is a consequence of the surface passivation for Al nanoparticles from air oxidation at room temperature. Based on these analyses, it can be concluded that the sample has a unique composite structure with a metal Al spherical core and an extremely thin amorphous Al2O3 layer deposited on its surface."
4,Catalytic activity studies,"3.2 Catalytic activity studies 3.2.1 Effect of temperature and reaction time In the present work, we attempted to investigate the possibility of using Al/Al2O3 nanospheres as catalyst for the selective transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. The catalytic performance of Al/Al2O3 nanospheres was evaluated towards the transfer hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) to cinnamyl alcohol (COL). Generally, many experimental factors, such as reaction temperature, time and hydrogen donor could affect catalytic activity. The influence of reaction temperature (120–200 °C) on the transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL and CAL to COL is presented in Fig. S8. The conversion of FAL is 40% at 160 °C for 18 h, but as the temperature is increased to 180 °C and above, the conversion of FAL reaches as high as 99% after 18 h on reaction stream (Fig. S8a). Similarly, for the CAL to COL reaction, increasing the reaction temperature from 160 to 180 °C also greatly improves the conversion from 58 to 99% (Fig. S8b). These observations suggest that when increasing the reaction temperature, the transfer hydrogenation reactions conducted over Al/Al2O3 nanospheres are favoured since transfer hydrogenation is a thermodynamically controlled reaction [24,25]. It should be also noted that neither by-products nor over-hydrogenated products were detected for both reactions. Even at a low reaction temperature of 120 °C, the selectivity could reach as high as 98%, and both FAL to FOL and CAL to COL transfer hydrogenation reactions exhibit a temperature independent selectivity. Time dependent catalytic performance was also studied by varying the reaction time from 6 to 24 h, as shown in Fig. 2 . The conversions of FAL and CAL increased with reaction time. In particular, the conversion rate was as high as 78% at 160 °C after 24 h on reaction stream. At higher temperatures of 180 and 200 °C, the conversion rate reached up to 99% after 18 h on reaction stream. In order to check the over-hydrogenation of FAL and CAL, the reaction time was extended beyond 24 h. It was found that FOL and COL were still the main products. This confirms that CC bond is stable when using Al/Al2O3 nanospheres as catalyst, and that the latter one shows a high performance towards the selective transfer hydrogenation of CO. It is important to state here that the as-prepared Al/Al2O3 catalyst shows an activity behavior superior to many other transition metal catalysts or noble-metal-based catalysts reported earlier, as indicated in Table. S3. 3.2.2 Effect of hydrogen donor (solvent) Alcohols are hydrogen donors, which could affect transfer hydrogenation reactions [26]. Thus, various primary and secondary alcohols were evaluated as hydrogen donors (Fig. 3 ). The transfer hydrogenation reaction with primary alcohols, such as MeOH, EtOH, and 1-BuOH, show poor conversion, suggesting that these are negative hydrogen donors for transfer hydrogenation reaction. Comparatively, secondary alcohols exhibit better performances, and the transfer hydrogenation reaction with 2-BuOH gives a similar result to that with 2-PrOH (the conversions at 99% and the selectivity at 99%). The different activities using primary and secondary alcohols as hydrogen donors could be related to their distinct adsorption properties. To confirm this, an FTIR test before and after reaction was conducted (Fig. S9). When using MeOH as hydrogen donor, the CO stretching vibration [27] at 1105 cm−1 is detected, but the same vibration was not detected when using 2-PrOH as hydrogen donor. It can be thus concluded that primary alcohols show strong adsorption with the catalyst surface, which is unfavorable for the reaction. In addition, competitive experiments were also made using secondary alcohols in the presence of aldehyde, in which 2-PrOH was adopted as hydrogen donor for the selective transfer hydrogenation of furfural in the presence of formaldehyde (0.1 mmol) over Al/Al2O3 catalyst at 180 °C. After reaction for 18 h, the conversion of furfural was only 64%, much lower than that of 99% obtained in the absence of formaldehyde. Based on the above results, the aldehydes produced during the reaction, when using primary alcohols as hydrogen donor, can cause catalyst deactivation, thereby inhibiting the reaction rate. Similar results have been reported for aldehyde hydrogenation reaction using Cu/Ni/Cr-Al2O3 [28]. 3.2.3 Comparisons of different aluminum-based catalysts For comparison, a blank reaction without catalyst was carried out. No FOL was detected (Table 1 , entry 1). In the presence of the commercial aluminum powder, the conversion of FAL was lower than 1% after reaction for 18 h at 180 °C (Table 1, entry 2). The surface of the commercial aluminum powder is usually covered by compact oxidation layers [29], which greatly hinders the reaction. To further explain the influence of aluminum oxide on the reaction, neutral Al2O3, amorphous Al2O3 powder, and 20 nm Al2O3 were also used as catalysts for the same reaction, while keeping other reaction conditions the same (Table 1, entry 3–5). The activities of these Al2O3 samples are much lower than that of the as-prepared Al/Al2O3 nanospheres. When 20 nm Al2O3 is used as the catalyst, the conversion of FAL was only 50%. It is also found that aldol condensation products were the main product, while FOL is not detected. This observation might be related to the surface acidity for 20 nm Al2O3. Al/Al2O3 nanospheres are highly active and selective in transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes when comparing to the above mentioned aluminum-based materials (Table 1, entry 6). This striking observation could be closely related to the structure and composition of the sample. Firstly, the present sample consists of nanoparticles with average particle size of 100 nm, and its surface area is relatively larger than that of the bulk material. Therefore, the presence of surface atoms with larger site activity and concentration would contribute to the overall higher catalytic activity, as reported elsewhere [30]. Furthermore, the special amorphous layer coated on metal nanospheres could explain its better catalytic performance in the transfer hydrogenation reaction. According to the Cabrera–Mott theory, fast outward diffusion of metal ions from the core metal to the outer oxide shell produces excess oxygen vacancies during oxidation of the metal nanoparticle [31]. Thus, one could imagine that an amorphous Al oxide layer onto Al nanospheres has a higher concentration of unsaturated coordination sites compared to the crystalline Al2O3. These unsaturated sites are easy to bond with the reaction substrate, as reported elsewhere [32]. In addition, the core Al metal possesses a high electrical conductivity, while ultrathin Al2O3 (3.2 ± 0.5 nm thickness) does not prohibit electron transfer in the reaction process. Thus, a rapid hydrogenation occurs for transfer hydrogenation reactions. In other words, the synergistic effect between ultrathin amorphous Al2O3 shell with abundant unsaturated sites and the metallic Al core with high electrical conductivity makes a substantial contribution to selective transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. 3.2.4 Transfer hydrogenation of various α,β-unsaturated aldehydes In addition to the transfer hydrogenation of FAL and CAL, a variety of other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes were also studied under the optimized conditions in the presence of Al/Al2O3 nanospheres. The obtained results are summarized in Table S2. Allα,β-unsaturated aldehydes tested showed the selective hydrogenation over the Al/Al2O3 nanospheres catalyst with high selectivity towards the production of corresponding unsaturated alcohols. Moreover, Al/Al2O3 nanospheres also exhibited a good activity for the hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones. These obtained unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates in chemical industry. Therefore, the present catalyst appears to be highly promising towards the industrial production of unsaturated alcohols. 3.2.5 Recyclability of catalyst Fig. S10 compares the transfer hydrogenation of FAL in five cycles using 2-PrOH as H-donor. No considerable change was observed in the conversion of FAL (the conversions ranged from 99% to 97% after 18 h). Moreover, the selectivity towards FOL was always above 99% (Fig. S10), suggesting an excellent reusability of this catalyst. TEM images (Fig. S11a and b) of the current Al/Al2O3 nanospheres after the fifth catalytic cycle did not show obvious changes in their morphology. XRD and XPS results (Fig. S11c and d) demonstrate that the catalyst did not degrade in composition. TG curves of the as-prepared sample and that after transfer hydrogenation reaction (aged sample) showed similar weight change in a temperature range from room temperature to 900 °C (Fig. S12), suggesting that the sample maintains the ultrathin layer of Al2O3. The good stability and reusability for Al/Al2O3 nanospheres is closely related to the in situ oxidization of Al nanospheres that produces ultrathin amorphous Al2O3, which gives a highly structure match. A hot-filtration test was also carried out to verify the heterogeneous nature of the reaction. After removal of the solid catalyst, no reaction proceeded in the filtrate (Fig. S13). These results indicate that the catalytic effect in this system results from Al/Al2O3 nanospheres, but not from the leached metal species."
5,Reaction mechanism,"3.3 Reaction mechanism The present characterization results have demonstrated the formation of crystalline/amorphous Al/Al2O3 core/shell nanospheres. The amorphous oxide shell could provide abundant unsaturated sites, and therefore the mechanism for our system should be somewhat similar from other catalysts, like ZrO2, MgAl oxides, or C3O4 as reported elsewhere [7,33,34]. Namely, the transfer hydrogenation occurs through a six-membered intermediate with 2-propanol and substrate adsorbed on the surface of metal oxides. We propose a possible reaction pathway for transfer hydrogenation reaction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes catalysed by the current core/shell nanospheres. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the interaction of 2-PrOH with (Al3+–O2−) sites onto the catalyst may lead to the dissociation to the corresponding alkoxide. At the meantime, CO in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes could be adsorbed and activated by (Al3+–O2−) sites. Then, hydride might shift through a six-membered cyclic transition state in which both 2-PrOH and the activated CO are directly bonded to the active sites, similar to the second step reported for the catalytic reactions by Sn-beta and Zr-beta zeolites [35]. Eventually, 2-PrOH would be converted into acetone after losing two hydrogen atoms in the reaction process, as followed by the hydrogenation of CO bond that forms C-OH by the attack of the hydrogen atoms."
6,Conclusions,"We report on a new strategy to synthesize Al/Al2O3 core/shell nanospheres, which have a unique composite structure with a crystalline Al core surrounded by an amorphous Al2O3 shell (3.2 ± 0.5 nm thicknesses). The as-obtained sample is efficient for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols, and shows a high stability under reaction conditions. The obtained selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols (such as furfural and cinnamaldehyde) is higher than 99% at full conversion. The synergistic effect between metallic Al core with a high electrical conductivity and ultrathin amorphous Al2O3 shell with abundant unsaturated sites seem to play an important role in promoting the catalytic activity for selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. The strategy used here may pave the way for future developments of crystalline/amorphous composite catalysts for reactions of industrial interest."
