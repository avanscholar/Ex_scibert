0,Introduction,"Chemicals derived from biomass have attracted a considerable interest in the recent years. A wide range of chemicals such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, sorbitol, levulinic acid, and glucaric acid are obtained from agricultural waste. The acid degradation of agricultural waste at higher temperatures produces furfural as a major product which is used as a key intermediate in the preparation of several non-petroleum based chemicals [1–3]. Furfuryl alcohol produced by the hydrogenation of furfural is widely used in fine chemical and polymer industries. The major applications of furfuryl alcohol are the production of thermostatic resins, acid proof bricks, corrosion resistant fiber glass, corrosion resistant polymer concrete and liquid resins for galvanic bath tub. Furfuryl alcohol is also an important intermediate chemical in the synthesis of lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents, plasticizer and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [4–8]. Liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol has been extensively studied with Ni, Co, Ru, Pt and Pd based catalysts [4,5,9]. Baijun et al. [10] reported that the addition of heteropolyacids improves selectivity and conversion profile of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Cu based catalysts are often more preferred for high activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, however it generates a low yield of 2-methyl furan as a by-product [11–13]. Other catalysts such as Raney nickel, amorphous nickel alloys, Cu–Zn mixed oxide with Al, Fe, Mn, Cu–MgO and Pt on different supports have also been used for hydrogenation of furfural [14–16]. Pd based catalysts trigger decarbonylation of furfural to produce furan and also, generate further hydrogenated by-products. However, major disadvantages of these catalysts are that these catalysts promote unwanted side reactions and also, cannot be reused. The Cu–Cr catalyst, at high temperature and pressure, is used in industry for the hydrogenation of furfural with moderate activity and selectivity to produce furfuryl alcohol [17–20]. Rao et al. reported that copper chromite catalyst reduced at 300°C provides 60% furfural conversion and 70% furfuryl alcohol selectivity [21]. Fig. 1 illustrates the formation of furfuryl alcohol and several other byproducts from the hydrogenation of furfural which is dependent on the type of catalyst used. Primary reactions occur by the reduction of CO group or furan ring, whereas the secondary reactions include several by-products such as hydrogenolysis of CO bond, decarbonylation and hydrogenation of furan ring. In addition, formation of a condensation product such as furfuryl ether is also reported in the literature [5,6]. In this study, liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol is reported by using novel Cu:Zn:Cr:Zr based catalysts with elemental molar ratios of 3:2:1:x where x =1–4, respectively. The main objective was to investigate the influence of zirconium metal in this catalyst matrix on the activity and selectivity of the formation of furfuryl alcohol. In addition, various reaction parameters such as catalyst composition, speed of agitation, catalyst loading, hydrogen pressure, furfural concentration, and reaction temperature were studied to optimize the furfural conversion, furfuryl alcohol selectivity, and to determine kinetic parameters for catalysis reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and gases,"2.1 Chemicals and gases The following chemicals were purchased and used without further purification: Furfural (reagent grade, 99.99% purity from VWR, Canada), copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (purity≥99% from VWR, Canada), zinc (II) nitrate hexahydrate (reagent grade, 98% purity from VWR, Canada), chromium nitrate nonahydrate (reagent grade≥98% purity, from VWR, Canada), zirconium nitrate (reagent grade≥98% purity, from VWR, Canada), potassium carbonate (lab grade≥98% from VWR, Canada), furfuryl alcohol (reagent grade≥99% purity from VWR, Canada) and 1-octanol (reagent grade≥99% purity from Sigma–Aldrich). Hydrogen, helium, nitrogen and air with high purity grade, 99.99% were purchased from Praxair, Saskatoon, Canada."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Co-precipitation method was used to prepare the catalysts with different elemental molar ratios. Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 23g), chromium nitrate (Cr(NO3)2·9H2O, 15.4g), zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 18.2g) and zirconium nitrate (Zr(NO3)2·xH2O, 15.3g) were dissolved in 1000mL of distilled water. The solution was precipitated with 1M solution of potassium carbonate with continuous vigorous stirring. Potassium carbonate solution was added till pH of the solution reached the range of 9–10. The precipitate was aged at 70±2°C for 5h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25±2°C, the precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with distilled water till neutral pH. The solid cake was dried at 120±2°C for 12h in an oven. Finally, the solid material was calcined at 650±10°C for 3h to provide 22g of the catalyst Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(3), referred as Cat-C (elemental molar ratios are presented in parenthesis). Following the same procedure and by using zirconium nitrate 5.1g, 10.2g and 20.4g, Cat-A, Cat-B, and Cat-D were prepared with the elemental molar ratios of Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(1), Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(2), and Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(4), respectively. The catalysts Cu:Cr (3:1), Cu:Zn:Cr (3:1:1), Cu:Zn:Cr (3:2:1), and Cu:Zn:Cr (3:3:1) were also prepared as per the above mentioned procedure using the corresponding metal nitrates."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization 2.3.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis All the catalysts were characterized by a large angle X-ray scattering to determine different phases present. The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and a Bruker Smart 6000 CCD detector. The X-ray diffractograms were obtained with a step rate of 0.005° with 300s/step from 10 to 100°. 2.3.2 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms Nitrogen physisorption isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyzer. The catalyst was out-gassed in vacuum at 200°C prior to the analysis until the static pressure remained less than 6.6×10−4 Pa. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the surface area in the range of relative pressures between 0.01 and 0.20Pa. In all cases, the correlation coefficients were above 0.999. All the samples were analyzed in triplicate and the results were within ±2 error range. 2.3.3 FT-IR spectroscopy (FTIR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out by using a PerkinElmer (Wellesley, MA, USA) Spectrum GX instrument equipped with DTGS detector and a KBr beam splitter. The spectrum for each analysis was averaged over 16 scans with a resolution of 4cm−1 by using spectroscopic grade potassium bromide (KBr) in the range of 375–4000cm−1 wave numbers. 2.3.4 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profile of the catalysts was conducted by using a TPD/TPR Quantachrome (USA) instrument for analyzing the nature of reducible metal species present in the samples. For a typical experiment, 100mg sample was taken in a quartz tube and purged with helium at 200°C for 1h to remove impurities on the surface of the sample. The sample was cooled down to the room temperature under flowing helium and the TPR was carried out using 3% H2/N2 (v/v) mixture at a flow rate of 20mL/min. The heating rate was 10°C/min starting from room temperature to 800°C. The TPR profile was recorded using a thermal conductivity detector. 2.3.5 Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) of the catalysts was carried out using a TPD/TPR Quantachrome (USA) instrument for analyzing the acidity present in the catalyst. 100mg of the sample was placed in a quartz tube and purged with helium at 550°C for 1h. The sample was cooled down to the room temperature under flowing helium and saturated with 3wt% NH3 in N2 at a flow rate of 30mL/min for 120min. Physisorbed ammonia was removed by flowing helium at 100°C for 1h. Analysis was carried out by heating the sample at 10°C/min from 100 to 600°C. The TPD profile of the catalysts was recorded using a thermal conductivity detector. 2.3.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The powder samples were grounded in an agate mortar. A few particles were then deposited on 200 mesh copper grids covered with a holey carbon film. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were obtained on a Hitachi-S4700 microscope. 2.3.7 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) The morphological features of the catalysts were studied from electron micrographs obtained with a Philips CM10 (1990) scanning transmission electron microscope. The powder samples were grounded softly in an agate mortar and dispersed in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 1min. A few drops of this suspension were deposited on 200 mesh copper grids. The electron micrographs were recorded on films. The films were developed to get the images. 2.3.8 Inductive coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) The elemental molar ratios of the fresh and regenerated catalysts were measured by ICP-MS. A sample of the catalyst (0.1g) was dissolved in concentrated hydrofluoric acid (48–51%) at a temperature of 100–150°C for two days. After cooling, concentrated HNO3 was added to it to ensure the complete dissolution of the metals. The final solution was prepared by using 0.2N HNO3 acid and analyzed with a mass spectrometer. 2.3.9 CO chemisorption A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Chemisorption system was used to measure the carbon monoxide uptake on the oxide catalysts. Prior to the CO chemisorption measurements, the sample was put under vacuum and backfilled with helium at 35°C and then evacuated at 110°C for 60min. The sample was then heated to 350°C at 10°C/min in the presence of hydrogen and was maintained at 350°C for 2h, and was then cooled to 35°C and evacuated until the static pressure remained less than 1.3–10.5Pa. The chemisorption analysis was performed by passing pulses of CO over the sample to measure total CO uptake at 35°C. The following formula was used to calculate the percentage of metal dispersion of the active metal available for interaction with the adsorbate. % M D i s p = 1 22,414 V × S F C A L C w e i g h t f r a c t i o n o f C u / W A T O M I C , C u where % M Disp is metal dispersion (%), V is volume intercept derived from the best line fit to the volume differences between the selected points of the first analysis and the repeat analysis (cm3/g STP), and SF CALC is the calculated stoichiometry factor. 2.3.10 X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) The copper K-edge XANES of the Cat-C (fresh) and Cat-C (reduced) were recorded in the transmission mode using two nitrogen has filled detectors, at the VESPERS beam line at the Canadian Light Source. The transmission mode of detection was chosen over fluorescence because it measures the absorption near the surface and through the sample. The samples were tightly packed in an absorption holder to avoid pinholes and at a thickness close to one absorption length."
5,Experimental set up and reaction procedure,"2.4 Experimental set up and reaction procedure Experiments were performed in a 300mL stainless steel Parr autoclave. A four bladed pitch turbine impeller was used for agitation. Calculated quantity of the catalyst was reduced at 300±1°C by H2 pressure of 2MPa for 2h. The reactor was cooled to room temperature, then hydrogen gas was released. The calculated quantities of furfural and isopropyl alcohol were charged into the autoclave which was flushed with N2 and further pressurized with H2 gas to the desired pressure. The reaction temperature was raised to the desired value and agitation was started. The total pressure in the reactor was observed to be higher than the set value because of autogenous pressure of the reaction mixture. An initial sample was collected when the temperature in the autoclave reached the desired value and aliquot of 1mL of the sample was collected at an interval of 15min. A constant hydrogen pressure was maintained throughout the reaction. A standard reaction was carried out with using furfural (12.43mL, 0.15mol), isopropyl alcohol (87.57mL), catalyst (1.5g) at 170°C, H2 pressure of 2MPa and agitation speed of 1000rpm. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate for reproducibility of the data and the results were within an error of ±5%."
6,Method of analysis,"2.5 Method of analysis The samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph system (Agilent 7890A) with flame ionizing detector (FID). The stabilwax capillary column with 30m length and 0.25mm inside diameter with 0.5μm film thickness was used. The oven temperature was programmed to begin at 80°C for 4min and ramped to 240°C at 20°C/min with a final hold time of 4min. One microliter of the sample was injected into the column with a split ratio of 10:1. Helium was used as a carrier gas. The conversion of furfural and selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was monitored by analyzing the samples at 30min intervals. The results have an error of ±3% throughout the experiments. The formation of furfuryl alcohol was confirmed by GC–MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The selectivity of furfural alcohol found to be same throughout the progress of the reaction. Eqs. (1)–(3) were used to calculate conversion, product selectivity and yield, respectively. (1) conversion ( % ) = initial moles of furfural − final moles of furfural initial moles of furfural × 100 (2) product selectivity ( % ) = moles of desired product formed total moles of all products formed × 100 (3) yield ( % ) = % conversion ( starting material ) × % selectivity ( desired product )"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts The XRD patterns for the Cat A-D, Cat-C (used), Cat-C (freshly reduced) and Cat-C (regenerated) are presented in Fig. 2 . The presence of CuO was evident from the peaks at 2θ =35°, 38° and 47° [ICDD no. 00-048-1548], ZrO2 at 2θ =28° and 49° [ICDD no. 00-050-1089], ZnO at 2θ =31°, 34°, 47° [ICDD no. 01-070-8070], ZnCr2O4 at 2θ =28° and 38° [ICDD no. 00-022-1107] and Cu at 43.16° and 50.37° [ICDD no. 01-070-3038]. The presence of sharp signals confirmed crystalline structure of the catalysts. The intensity of the ZrO2 peak increased from Cat-A to Cat-D due to an increase in the zirconium metal contents in Cat A–D (Fig. 2). The XRD patterns for used and freshly reduced catalyst show the peaks corresponding to metallic Cu. The crystalline size of metallic Cu calculated by Scherrer equation was found to be 16.9nm. The intense peak observed at 2θ =43° in XRD corresponding to metallic Cu in Cat-C (used) and Cat-C(freshly reduced) was not observed for the regenerated Cat-C, indicating that metallic Cu was converted into CuO during calcination. The BET surface area of Cat A–D, Cat-C (used), Cat-C (freshly reduced) and Cat-C (regenerated) are presented in Table 1 . The BET surface areas of the metal oxide Cat A–D were in the range of 21.0–23.5m2/g. The BET surface area of the used Cat-C was dramatically increased to 38.3m2/g compared to the fresh Cat-C (23.1m2/g). The BET surface area of the freshly reduced Cat-C (39.5m2/g) was found to be very similar to that of the used Cat-C which suggests that the reduction of CuO to metallic copper increases the BET surface area. This was confirmed by XRD (Fig. 2). The regenerated catalyst (24.1m2/g) showed very similar BET surface area to that of the fresh Cat-C confirming that metallic copper is again converted back into CuO by calcination at 650°C. This result was also supported by the XRD data. The FTIR spectra of Cat A-D and pure ZrO2 are shown in Fig. 3 . A broad band in the region of 3500cm−1 could be as a result of moisture absorbed on the catalyst. The IR bands observed at 740 and 541cm−1 are the characteristics peaks of crystalline zirconia [25]. Yadav et al. reported that zirconium hydroxide undergoes transformation to crystalline zirconia during calcination at 650°C [26]. The presence of crystalline zirconia in the catalysts was also observed from the XRD data. The IR band between 700 and 550cm−1 was broad due to an increase in the zirconia content from Cat A–D. This observation also correlates with by XRD data which indicates that the peak intensity at 2θ =29° and 49° increases with an increase in the zirconia content. Fig. 4 shows the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profile of Cat-C (fresh), Cat-C (regenerated), Cat-C (used) and Cat-C (freshly reduced). A single peak observed in the range of 200–400°C for the fresh catalyst was due to the hydrogen consumption for the reduction of copper oxide to metallic copper which was in accordance with the literature report [27]. The shape of the peak was narrow and symmetrical, indicating homogeneous distribution of copper oxide [28]. The TPR profile of the freshly reduced catalyst did not show any peak at 200–400°C which confirms the presence of only metallic Cu in the catalyst Therefore, in the used catalyst, no peak should be observed at this temperature range. However, TPR profile of the used catalyst shows two small peaks at the temperature range of 225–265°C (CuO) and 290–400°C (Cu2O). The presence of a small amount of copper oxides (i.e. CuO and Cu2O) in the used catalyst was believed to be formed due to the oxidation of metallic copper into copper oxides during recovery of the catalyst after first run and drying at 100°C. The TPR profile of the regenerated catalyst shows an additional peak at 340–420°C along with the main peak which is due to the presence of Cu2O. This result shows that during calcination process in the regeneration of the used catalyst, a sequential oxidation process Cu→Cu2O→CuO takes place which is in agreement with the literature report [29]. The presence of metallic copper in the used and freshly reduced catalyst was also supported by the XRD data which shows intense peaks corresponding to metallic copper at 2θ of 43.16° and 50.37° [ICDD no. 01-070-3038]. Acidic strength of Cat A–D was studied by NH3-TPD and compared against ZrO2 (Fig. 5 ). Ammonia is a suitable probe molecule to measure acidity of the catalyst due to its small size and basicity. Ammonia interacts at the acidic sites present in the catalyst. Ammonia desorption temperature is an indicator of the strength of the acidic sites of the catalyst. Fig. 5 shows that most of ammonia was desorbed in the range of 250–350°C, indicating the presence of moderate acidic sites [30]. Cat-C and D demonstrated high ammonia desorption as compared to Cat-A and B, indicating that Cat-C and D possess higher acidity than Cat-A and B. NH3-TPD profile of Cat A–D revealed that the acidity of the catalyst increases with an increase in the zirconia content which influences the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol. The results in Table 3 indicate that the selectivity of furfural alcohol increases with an increase in the Zr content from Cat A–C. Therefore, it is apparent that the selectivity is influenced by the acidity of the catalyst, i.e. selectivity increases as the acidity of the catalyst increases. Bulk elemental molar compositions of Cat-C (fresh) and Cat-C (regenerated) were analyzed by using ICP-MS and the analysis results presented in Table 2 . The results show that the elemental molar ratios of the regenerated catalyst were very similar to the values for the fresh catalyst. SEM micrographs of Cat-C (fresh), Cat-C (used) and Cat-C (regenerated) are represented in Fig. 6 . Very little differences in the morphology and particle size of the used catalyst with respect to the fresh catalyst were observed. This was further explained by the TEM images (Fig. 7 ), CO-chemisorption and XRD profile that indicate the presence of metallic Cu in the used catalyst. The regenerated catalyst has some metal agglomerates due to calcination at 650°C, which converts metallic Cu to CuO and was confirmed by XRD. It was found that the regenerated catalyst retains its external morphology with an average particle size of 3μm after calcination at 650°C. The TEM images of fresh, used and freshly reduced Cat-C are presented in Fig. 7. It shows that the fresh Cat-C has CuO clusters, while used and freshly reduced catalysts have well dispersed metallic Cu. The average particle size for metallic Cu was calculated to be 19nm which was in agreement with the average particle size of metallic Cu obtained from CO-chemisorption studies, i.e. 17nm and XRD, i.e. 16.9nm. CO-chemisorption results for the dispersion of Cu in Cat-A, Cat-B, Cat-C and Cat-D are portrayed in Table 7. It was concluded that the dispersion of copper increased with an increase in Zr loading, i.e. from Cat-A to Cat-D. Cu crystalline size measured by CO-chemisorption for Cat-C was found to be 17nm which was in agreement with the value obtained from XRD and TEM. CO adsorbed on the catalysts was increased from Cat-A to Cat-D, indicating that metallic Cu is more dispersed in Cat-C and Cat-D compared to Cat-A and B. As the composition of other metals such as Cu, Cr and Zn was found to be the same in Cat A–D, except Zr, it was apparent that an increase in Zr loading helps in the dispersion of Cu metal which might be the reason for increase in selectivity for furfuryl alcohol. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) measures the density of the unoccupied states in the final state of a dipolar transition. The copper K edge XANES is a measure of the 1s→4p transition in copper. Oxidized copper (Cu2+) is expected to have the threshold binding at higher energy than the zero valent copper (Cu0). Fig. 8 shows that the absorption energy for the Cat-C (freshly reduced) is 8979eV, indicating the presences of Cu0 state and has the similar absorption energy pattern as that of the copper edge of a copper foil. Cat-C (fresh) has absorption energy at 8984eV that is due to the presence of Cu2+. These results are also in agreement with the XRD data which shows the presence of Cu2+ oxidation state in Cat-C (fresh) as indicated by the presence of CuO and Cu0 oxidation state in Cat-C (freshly reduced) as confirmed by the presence of metallic copper."
9,Efficacy study for various catalysts,"3.2 Efficacy study for various catalysts The catalysts with varying elemental molar ratios such as Cu:Cr (3:1), Cu:Zn:Cr (3:1:1), Cu:Zn:Cr (3:2:1), Cu:Zn:Cr (3:3:1), Cat-A, Cat-B, Cat-C and Cat-D were prepared by co-precipitation method as discussed earlier and used in the hydrogenation of furfural. The reactions were carried out in isopropyl alcohol, since this solvent was reported to be a good solvent for furfural hydrogenation [9,22–24]. We also investigated the need of a solvent by carrying out a reaction without any solvent using Cat-C. The reaction without any solvent yielded only 31% conversion with 80% selectivity, whereas the reaction in isopropyl alcohol increased the conversion of furfural to 100% with 96% selectivity in the formation of furfuryl alcohol. Hydrogenation of furfural catalyzed by Cu:Cr catalyst produces furfuryl alcohol and 2-methyl furan as two major products [21] (Fig. 1). Copper helps to improve the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol [11–13]. Therefore, a novel Cu:Cr catalyst was prepared by increasing the elemental molar ratio of Cu and investigated for selectivity of furfural alcohol. In this study, Cu(3):Cr(1) catalyst provided 75% conversion with 60% selectivity for furfural alcohol. Bruch et al. reported that ZnO has an important role as an enabling support, act as a reservoir for atomic hydrogen and promote hydrogen spillover for the reactions [31]. The role of ZnO is known to increase the dispersion of Cu which improves the performance of the catalyst [32,33]. Therefore, in order to enhance conversion and selectivity of the hydrogenation of furfural to furfural alcohol, Zn was incorporated into the Cu(3):Cr(1) catalyst. As anticipated, addition of Zn with elemental molar ratio of 1 and 2 leads to an improvement in the conversion of furfural from 75% to 83% and 100% and furfuryl alcohol selectivity from 60% to 68% and 70%, respectively. When the elemental molar ratio of Zn was further increased to 3 with respect to Cu(3):Cr(1), the reaction proceeded with 100% conversion, but the selectivity was decreased by 10% (Table 3 ). From these experiments, it was concluded that the Cu:Zn:Cr catalyst with an elemental molar ratio of 3:2:1, respectively was the best catalyst to demonstrate 100% conversion and moderate selectivity (i.e. 70%) for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Zirconium metal is known to enhance acidity of the catalyst, and also increase selectivity of the hydrogenation reaction [34,35]. Therefore, a decision was made to add Zr to the Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1) catalyst with a view to enhance the selectivity of furfural alcohol formation. A series of Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(1–4) were prepared by varying elemental ratio of Zr from 1 to 4 and investigated for their potential for furfural conversion and selectivity of furfural alcohol. The results show that the addition of Zr did not bring any advantage in terms of conversion of furfural as compared to Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1). In all cases, the conversion was 100% irrespective of the elemental molar ratios of Zr. However, addition of Zr to Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1) influenced the selectivity of the formation of furfuryl alcohol significantly. An increase in the selectivity of the reaction was observed with an increase in the elemental molar ratios of Zr from 1 to 3; however no further increase in the selectivity was observed by increasing the elemental molar ratio of Zr from 3 to 4. From this study, Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(3) (Cat C) and Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(4) (Cat D) were found to be the best catalysts for maximum furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol selectivity. The potential of Cat-C and Cat-D to display highest conversion and selectivity is believed from a combined effect of (1) Zn, Cu and Zr metal, (2) the dispersion of Cu; and (3) the acidity of the catalyst. Based on the elemental molar ratio of Zr used in the catalysts and the results of activity and selectivity of the reaction, Cat-C was chosen as the best catalyst for further studies."
10,Optimization studies using Cat-C,"3.3 Optimization studies using Cat-C 3.3.1 Effect of speed of agitation The reactions were carried out in a batch reactor with a speed of agitation in the range of 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400rpm to overcome the influence of external mass transfer resistance between the bulk liquid phase and catalyst surface. The experimental condition for optimization of the speed of agitation is reported in Table 4 . The maximum conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was found to be 91% with the selectivity of 96% at 1000rpm using Cat-C beyond which no change in the conversion and selectivity was observed, indicating that there was no external mass transfer resistance on the overall rate of reaction above 1000rpm (Table 4). This is in consistent with the report of Vaidya and Mahajani [9] that 1000rpm is sufficient to eliminate mass transfer resistance. Thus the speed of agitation was kept at 1000rpm for further experiments for the assessment of the effect of other variable parameters on the reaction. 3.3.2 Effect of catalyst loading The effect of catalyst loading on the reaction was evaluated by varying the catalyst amount in the range from 0.5 to 2.0g. The percentage conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol increased with an increase in the catalyst loading (Fig. 9 ), which was due to a proportional increase in the active site of the catalyst. The selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was not affected by catalyst loading and was found to be in the range of 94–96% in all the cases. Additional hydrogenated product such as 2-methylfuran was not observed in the reaction. Highest conversion of furfural to furfural alcohol was observed with 1.5 and 2g of Cat-C loading. The reaction in the case of 2g catalyst loading was found to be faster compared to a loading of 1.5g; however, no much difference in the total conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was observed. Taking the cost of the catalyst in consideration, 1.5g of catalyst loading was chosen for further optimization studies. 3.3.3 Effects of hydrogen pressure The percentage conversion of furfural and selectivity of furfuryl alcohol were investigated by varying the hydrogen pressure from 1 to 4MPa. Autogeneous pressure of the reaction was generated at 170°C. Total pressure of the reaction was maintained at 2–6MPa with additional hydrogen supply. It was observed that with an increase in the hydrogen pressure, the conversion of furfural increased without affecting selectivity of furfuryl alcohol (Fig. 10 ). The increased solubility of hydrogen in the reaction mixture at increased hydrogen pressure can account for the increased conversion. The conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was very fast at a hydrogen pressure of 3–4MPa using Cat-C. At 2MPa hydrogen pressure, the conversion attained 96% but at a slower rate. For kinetic studies, a slow reaction is preferred over a fast reaction. Therefore, further studies were carried out at 2MPa hydrogen pressure. 3.3.4 Effects of furfural concentration Furfural concentration was varied in the range of 0.75–3.0M to estimate its effect on the conversion and selectivity of furfuryl alcohol by using Cat-C. It was observed that with an increase in the furfural concentration from 0.75 to 3.0M, conversion of furfural was decreased without affecting selectivity of furfuryl alcohol (94–96%) because of availability of less number of active sites to convert furfural to furfuryl alcohol (Fig. 11 ). Highest conversion was achieved by using 0.75 and 1.5M of furfural; however the reaction was very fast at 0.75M. Therefore furfural concentration of 1.5M was chosen for further studies. 3.3.5 Effects of temperature The reactions were carried out using Cat-C with a variation of temperature from 140 to 170°C using 2MPa hydrogen pressure to investigate its effect on the furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol selectivity. During the experiments, the samples were collected periodically and after each sample, the total pressure of the reaction was maintained constant by the addition of extra hydrogen. It was observed that the furfural conversion increased with an increase in the temperature (Fig. 12 ). The percentage selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was in the range of 94–96%. It was assumed that the reaction follows Longmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) type mechanism with the involvement of two similar catalytic sites. A plot of −ln(1− X A ) vs. time (min) gave a straight line that passes through the origin. This confirms that the reaction is pseudo first order with respect to furfural (Fig. 13 ). Rao et al. [7], Vaidya and Mahajani [9] and Sitthisa et al. [13] reported that this reaction follows LHHW type mechanism [7,9,36]. Table 6 shows the rate constants at different temperatures. Arrhenius plot was obtained by correlating ln k vs. 1/T (Fig. 14 ). The value of apparent activation energy was found to be 24.4kcal/mol. This activation energy suggests that the reaction was controlled by the surface reaction. 3.3.6 Catalyst reusability Catalyst recyclability in heterogeneous reactions is very important from the cost point of view. The reusability of Cat-C was carried out by conducting four runs. After each reaction, the catalyst was filtered and refluxed with 100mL of methanol at 60°C and dried at 100°C for 30min. Further, it was calcined at 650±10°C for 3h to remove any adsorbed material from the active sites of the catalyst and also to convert metallic copper into copper oxide which was confirmed by XRD for the regenerated catalyst (Fig. 2). This observation was also supported by TPR analysis (Fig. 4). The XRD and TPR results of fresh, used, regenerated and freshly reduced Cat-C have been discussed in details in Section 3.1. In a batch reaction, there was an inevitable loss of particles during filtration and handling. Hence, the actual amount of catalyst used in the next batch was almost 5% less than the previous batch. The loss of the catalyst was made up with fresh catalyst. Catalyst was reduced with H2 at 300±1°C for 3h prior to use. It was observed that the conversion of furfural decreased by 3–5% and the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was not affected which was in the range of 94–96% (Table 5 ). ICP-MS data revealed that the regenerated Cat-C has a similar elemental composition as of the fresh catalyst (Table 2). The TPR data also supported the reduction profile of the fresh and regenerated catalysts (Fig. 4). Surface area of the used catalyst was higher than the fresh catalyst due to reduction of the catalyst during the reaction. The presence of metallic Cu was confirmed by XRD and XANES, which was also supported by TPR profile of the used catalyst. This justifies that Cat-C catalyst is reusable and has the prospective for industrial applications. 3.3.7 Reaction mechanism The exact mechanistic pathway for the reduction of aldehydic CO of furfural to alcohol is not fully understood. Fig. 15 depicts a suggested mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. It is proposed that hydrogen molecule undergoes dissociative adsorption as hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface. It is assumed that in the first step, the acidity of the catalyst attracts the lone pair of aldehydic oxygen that helps adsorption of furfural on the catalyst surface in a preferred orientation [22]. Hence, the choice of active metal is the key for chemoselective hydrogenation of furfural. Second step involves the addition of hydrogen atom to carbonyl oxygen atom to form hydroxyl alkyl intermediate, which on further addition of hydrogen atom gives furfuryl alcohol. This mechanism was formulated based on the potential energy diagram delineated by Alcala et al. [37] for the hydrogenation of acetone and propanal to their corresponding alcohols."
11,Conclusion,"In the present work, Cu–Cr based catalyst was modified with the addition of Zn and Zr as promoters. It was found that the addition of Zn increases the activity of the catalyst that resulted in 100% conversion of furfural. The selectivity for furfuryl alcohol was increased by addition of Zr in the catalyst matrix. CO chemisorption data shows that an increase in Zr content from Cat-A to Cat-D, not only increased the percentage dispersion but also reduced the crystalline size of the active Cu metal. The particle size of metallic Cu was found to be 16.9nm by XRD, 17nm by CO-chemisorption and 19nm by TEM. NH3-TPD results show that with an increase in the Zr content in the catalyst, acidity of the catalyst increases. It was also found that the Zr loading in the catalyst not only increased the acidity of the catalyst, but also helped in the dispersion of metallic Cu. Elemental molar composition of the regenerated Cat-C was found to be same as that of the fresh Cat-C as per the ICP-MS results, suggesting that this catalyst can be reused for subsequent reactions. XANES analysis confirmed the presence of copper in the oxidation states of Cu0 and Cu2+ in the freshly reduced Cat-C and fresh Cat-C, respectively. The effect of various reaction parameters such as catalyst screening, speed of agitation, catalyst loading, hydrogen pressure, furfural concentration and temperature on the conversion of furfural were carried out to investigate optimized reaction conditions. This study reveals a novel Cu(3):Zn(2):Cr(1):Zr(3) catalyst which demonstrates 100% conversion and 96% chemo-selectivity for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol without forming any significant by-products. The reaction was pseudo-first order with respect to furfural and the apparent activation energy was found to be 24.4kcal/mol. The catalyst was reused for four runs; hence expands its scope for commercial use."
