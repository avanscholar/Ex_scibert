0,Introduction,"Fermentative H 2 production is a special case of acidogenesis in anaerobic digestion (AD). In this process, hydrogenotrophs such as methanogens are severely inhibited while hydrogenogenic acidogens are enriched to convert carbohydrates to H 2 , volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and alcohols. Due to the accumulation of VFAs and alcohols and the inhibition of methanogens, some interesting phenomena emerge. One of these phenomena is formation of high-carbon VFAs such as caproate, valerate and heptanoate. The concentrations of caproate and valerate reported are summarized in Table 1 . Significant amounts of caproate and valerate were always found in several granule-based upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (Yu and Mu, 2006; Zhao and Yu, 2008; Zhao et al., 2008) and also in other granule-based reactors (Lee et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007). Caproate is a unique product of only a few species including Eubacterium alactolyticus, E. biforme, E. limosum and E. pyruvativorans, as well as Clostridium kluyveri, Peptococcus niger and Megasphaera elsdenii (Dworkin et al., 2006). Among all the caproate-producing species mentioned thus far, the spore-forming C. kluyveri appears to be the most possible species resistant to heat treatment or chemical treatment used for the enrichment of H 2 -producing bacteria. Additionally, ethanol produced under acidic environment in fermentative H 2 production only favors the growth of C. kluyveri, while inhibiting the growth of other caproate-producing species, especially M. elsdenii (Dworkin et al., 2006). Caproate formation by C. kluyveri can be simply described by three coupled reactions in Eqs. (1)–(3) (Thauer et al., 1968; Schoberth and Gottschalk, 1969; Seedorf et al., 2008): (1) CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O = CH 3 COO - + H + + 2 H 2 (2) Δ G r 0 ′ = + 9.7 kJ mol - 1 CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 COO - = CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 2 COO - + H 2 O (3) Δ G r 0 ′ = - 38.7 kJ mol - 1 CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 2 COO - = CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 4 COO - + H 2 O Δ G r 0 ′ = + 38.7 kJ mol - 1 Eq. (1) describes the dehydrogenation of one ethanol leading to ATP synthesis via substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) and H 2 formation. Eqs. (2) and (3) describe the dehydrogenation of another ethanol leading to formation of butyrate and caproate from ethanol and acetate and ethanol and butyrate, respectively. The combination of Eqs. (2) and (3) gives Eq. (4) which describes caproate formation via butyrate formation: (4) 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 COO - = CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 4 COO - + 2 H 2 O Δ G r 0 ′ = - 77.5 kJ mol - 1 Valerate is formed in fermentation of ethanol and propionate according to the reaction in Eq. (5) which also has to be coupled with the reaction in Eq. (1): (5) CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 CH 2 COO - = CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 3 COO - + H 2 O Δ G r 0 ′ = - 38.7 kJ mol - 1 A comparison between the Δ G r 0 ′ of Eqs. (2) and (4) shows that the increment in carbon numbers (from butyrate to caproate) gives additional free energy. It implies that caproate formation can be spontaneous since it yields more energy than butyrate formation. Several other pathways (Reactions 1–5 in Table 2 ) were suggested for caproate formation in the fermentative H 2 production (Yu and Mu, 2006; Zhao and Yu, 2008). The argument is that butyrate is the primary source of caproate formation pathways in Reactions 1–3, and H 2 is the electron donor of Reactions 2–4 in Table 2. However, Reaction 1 in Table 2 is unlikely to happen due to its positive Gibbs free energy change of the reaction ( Δ G r 0 ′ ) under the physiological condition (1 atm, pH 7 , 25°C, concentrations: 1 atm if the reactants are gases or 1 M if the reactants are solutes). The major difference between Reactions 2–4 in Table 2 and caproate formation pathways by C. kluyveri is the source of reducing equivalents. In C. kluyveri, NADH 2 ( NADH + H + ) , the major carrier of reducing equivalents, is derived from ethanol dehydrogenation. As for Reactions 2–4 in Table 2, molecular H 2 is directly be utilized. Ethanol would be a much better source of reducing equivalents than H 2 to support high VFA synthesis and biomass growth (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985). Reaction 5 in Table 2 has ethanol and acetate as reactants and is superficially the same as the reaction in Eq. (4). However, Reaction 5 in Table 2 gives a simplified picture and does not accurately describe the observed quantitative relations among the substrates and products because H 2 formation is also observed along with caproate production (Schoberth and Gottschalk, 1969). Its occurrence for exergonic caproate formation has to be energetically coupled with endergonic ethanol dehydrogenation in Eq. (1) (Seedorf et al., 2008). In this study, the secondary fermentation pathways by C. kluyveri were used to explain caproate formation during the fermentative H 2 production. Energetic analysis and thermodynamic efficiency were used to determine caproate formation pathways in an upflow fixed-bed reactor (UFBR). The mutual influence between caproate formation and H 2 production was discussed."
1,Methods,"The UFBR had a working volume of 0.8L with a diameter of 10cm in diameter and a height of 25cm. The cylindrical activated carbon pellets (3mm in diameter and 7mm in length) were used as biofilm carriers with a void ratio of 60–70%. The reactor was operated at 30 ± 1 ° C . Seed sludge ( 45 g - VSS L - 1 and pH 7.8 ) was obtained from the methanogenic reactor of a pilot-scale two-phase AD system established on the campus of the university. The AD system was used to treat food waste collected from the university canteens (Wang et al., 2008). The sludge was first acidified with 1 N HCl to pH 3–4, kept for 24h, and then adjusted to neutral pH by 1N NaOH before heat treatment at 100°C for 2h. The substrate was prepared daily with substrate ( g L - 1 : 20 glucose), buffer ( g L - 1 : 4 NaHCO 3 ) , macronutrients ( g L - 1 : 1.5 NH 4 Cl and 1 NaH 2 PO 4 ), and micronutrients ( mg L - 1 : 22 FeCl 2 · 4 H 2 O, 20 MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O, 10 MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O, 5 CoCl 2 · 4 H 2 O, 6 CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O, 3.5 CuCl 2 · H 2 O, 4.2 ZnCl 2 ,and 4.5 NiCl 2 · 6 H 2 O ) (Ding and Wang, 2008). Five hundred milliliter of the fresh substrate was seeded with 200ml of pretreated sludge circulating through the reactor at HRT of 0.5h for cell cultivation and immobilization. The cultivation cycles were repeated for 20–40 HRT cycles. After successful biomass cultivation, the UFBR was operated at 4.5h HRT for 21d to obtain sufficient biomass before the HRT was decreased stepwise from 4.5 to 2h with a step size of 0.5h. Each HRT was maintained at least for 7d. The UFBR experiment provided empirical data for the calculation of Gibbs free energy changes and thermodynamic efficiencies of caproate formation during fermentative H 2 production. Gas compositions were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) (HP, 5890A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a fused-silica capillary column ( 30 × 0.53 mm ) (Supelco, Carboxen™ 1010 Plot). The operation temperatures were 150, 150, and 200°C for injector, oven, and detector respectively with argon as the carrier gas. COD and VSS were analyzed according to the standard method (APHA, 1998). Carbohydrate was determined using phenol-sulfuric acid assay (Dubois et al., 1956). VFAs and alcohols were determined by another GC (Agilent, 6890) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a fused-silica capillary column (Agilent, DB-FFAP, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μ m ) . Oven temperature was set at 60°C and increased at 20 ° C min - 1 to 120°C, followed by a further increase at 30 ° C min - 1 to 240°C, and maintained for 3min. Temperatures of injector and detector were both 250°C. Helium was the carrier gas at 103kPa. The Gibbs free energy changes of hypothesized reactions were calculated using the equations (Hanselmann, 1991) listed in Table 1 of Appendix. Table A2 lists the standard Gibb free energy of formation ( Δ G f 0 ) of some important organic compounds."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Theoretical aspects and reaction equations,"3.1 Theoretical aspects and reaction equations C. kluyveri ferments ethanol and acetate to form butyrate, caproate, and H 2 , and converts ethanol and butyrate to acetate, caproate, and H 2 . Similarly, it converts ethanol and propionate to acetate, valerate, and H 2 with the production of some butyrate, caproate, and heptanoate. The ethanol dehydrogenation in Eq. (1) produces H 2 as an essential end product and forms ATP via the energy-conserving SLP process. However, its standard free Gibbs energy is positive. Thus, ethanol dehydrogenation is not thermodynamically feasible, and must be coupled to some exergonic condensation of ethanol and VFAs in Eqs. (2)–(5) to make the overall fermentation exergonic (Thauer et al., 1968). However, the mechanisms underlying these couplings remained an enigma until recently. New genetics and biochemical evidence have unraveled a series of coupled redox cycles, catalyzed by two key enzymes, a cytoplasmic butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase complex (Bcd/EtfAB) and a membrane- bound energy-converting NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (RnfA-E) (Herrmann et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008; Seedorf et al., 2008). The discovery of the membrane-associated RnfA-E contravened the previous assumption that bacteria lacked the ability to carry out a second type of energy conservation known as electron transport phosphorylation (ETP). In ETP, the electron carriers are reoxidized by a terminal acceptor, establishing an electrochemical ion gradient ( Δ μ H + ) at the cytoplasmic membrane, which is used for ATP synthesis (Herrmann et al., 2008). Therefore, the 40-year-old notion that ATP is only formed via SLP should be revised. 3.1.1 Caproate formation from ethanol and acetate The fermentation of ethanol and acetate starts with two dehydrogenation steps (Steps A1 and A2 in Table 3 ), catalyzed by NAD-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase (Adh) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald) respectively to form acetyl-CoA via an acetaldehyde intermediate. Acetyl-CoA is diverted into two routes for ATP synthesis. The first route is the classical SLP process (Step B). In this energy conservation process, the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA is transferred to a phosphate group by phosphotransacetylase (Pta) to form acetylphosphate. SLP then occurs where acetate kinase (Ack) phosphorylates ADP to form ATP, along with acetate and H + production. The second ATP synthesis route is the ETP process. This process consists of a series of coupled redox cycles, culminating in the generation of a proton motive force for ATP synthesis. The first redox cycle consists of Steps D and F. Acetyl-CoA enters the redox cycle and reacts with additional acetyl-CoA to form butyryl-CoA (Steps D1–D4). The reaction is catalyzed by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (Thl), NAD- and NADP-dependent 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hbd), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (Crt), and Bcd/EtfAB, and proceeds via acetoacetyl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA as intermediates. NAD ( P ) + and H 2 O are formed as byproducts. Butyryl-CoA subsequently reacts with acetate to form butyrate, along with the regeneration of acetyl-CoA (Step F). The enzyme involved in Step F is acetate CoA-transferase (Cat3). The formation of crotonyl-CoA is an important juncture of the first redox cycle because the exergonic reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA ( E 0 ′ = - 10 mV; Δ G 0 ′ = - 60 kJ mol - 1 ) by NADH ( E 0 ′ = - 320 mV ) is coupled to the second redox cycle (Step C1) which is the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin to reduced ferredoxin ( E 0 ′ = - 410 mV ) . This coupling results in a free energy of Δ G 0 ′ = - 40 kJ mol - 1 and is mediated by the cytoplasmic Bcd/EtfAB enzyme complex, as first proposed by Herrmann et al. (2008). The hypothesis was later confirmed by Li and coworkers. Li et al. (2008) purified Bcd/EtfAB complex from C. kluyveri and demonstrated that the enzyme complex was indeed responsible for catalyzing crotonyl-CoA-dependent reduction of ferredoxin with NADH 2 (Step C1). Ferredoxin is regenerated from reduced ferredoxin via two mechanisms. The first mechanism is a dehydrogenase reaction, catalyzed by ferredoxin-dependent hydrogenase (Hyd). Some of the reduced ferredoxin reduces protons to H 2 ( Δ G 0 ′ = 0 kJ mol - 1 ) (Step C2). The second mechanism is catalyzed by membrane-associated RnfA-E and is also the mechanism where the ETP energy conservation occurs. In this energy-converting mechanism, the remaining reduced ferredoxin is utilized for the recycling of NADH 2 ( Δ G 0 ′ = + 20 kJ mol - 1 ) , along with the production of a proton motive force ( Δ μ H + ) that drives H + across a membrane, creating a proton concentration gradient across the membrane (Step C3). H + diffuses along this gradient back to the cytoplasm through the F o transmembrane domain of ATP synthase (AtpA-I) while ATP synthesis happens concurrently at the F 1 cytoplasmic domain of AtpA-I. For every 4 mol H + that passes through AtpA-I, 1mol of ATP is synthesized. Similarly, caproate is formed from caproyl-CoA through CoA-transferase activity (Step G). Caproyl-CoA is derived from the reductive condensation of acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA (Step E). Hex-2-enoyl-CoA is formed in Step E as intermediate. Its reduction to caproyl-CoA by NADH 2 generates reduced ferredoxin as does the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA in Step D4. The regeneration of ferredoxin from reduced ferredoxin also reduces H + to H 2 and couples the recycling of NADH with ATP synthesis via ETP. For the purpose of simplification, Table 3 does not include detailed information of caproate formation. However, it is worth to note that the reduction of hex-2-enoyl-CoA to caproyl-CoA generates similar amount of energy as per the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA (Seedorf et al., 2008). It implies that the amount of ATP formed via ETP during the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA and during the reduction of hex-2-enoyl-CoA to caproyl-CoA may be the same. 3.1.2 ATP yield The debate on the mechanism of ATP formation has been ongoing since late 1960s. Thauer et al. (1968) firmly believed that ATP was produced exclusively by SLP and not by ETP. Their opinion was supported by Schoberth and Gottschalk (1969) who concluded that, for every 2 mol of H 2 evolved, 1mol of acetyl-CoA became available to the cells for ATP synthesis (i.e., 1mol of ATP per 2 mol of H 2 ). However, Herrmann et al. (2008) clarified this 40-year-old misconception and pointed out that the amount of ATP generated per reaction was underestimated because of the overestimation of biomass yield per ATP ( Y ATP ) by Thauer et al. (1968) and Schoberth and Gottschalk (1969). Since one-third of the cell carbon of C. kluyveri comes from CO 2 and two-thirds come from acetate, Y ATP is certainly less than 9g (dry cell) per mol of ATP previously used (Stouthamer, 1979). It is now known that the actual ATP yield per reaction is in fact the summation of ATP synthesis via SLP and ETP (Herrmann et al., 2008). In this study, it is suggested that the amount of ATP yield per reaction is dependent on the number of ethanol ( m ) consumed. The endergonic oxidation of one mol of ethanol produces 2mol of H 2 , 1 mol of acetate, and 1 mol of ATP via SLP. Thus, the number of ATP produced via ETP is directly proportional to ( m - 1 ) . According to Seedorf et al. (2008), this number equals to 0.3 × ( m - 1 ) . Hence a total of 0.7 + 0.3 m ATP would be generated per reaction. The suggestion made here is based on the fact that the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA and the reduction of hex-2-enoyl-CoA to caproyl-CoA can generate the same amount of energy and yield the same number of ATP via ETP. 3.1.3 Overall reaction equations Schoberth and Gottschalk (1969) gave overall equations for the formation of butyrate and caproate (Eqs. (6) and (7) in Table 2) from ethanol and acetate. In fermentative H 2 production from carbohydrates, butyrate is one of the major products (Table 1). Therefore, C. kluyveri has butyrate as an alternative terminal acceptor for the reducing equivalents during caproate synthesis (Eq. (8) in Table 2). Eq. (6) is obtained by summing up Eq. (1) and k numbers of Eq. (2) while Eq. (8) is a summation of Eq. (1) and k numbers of Eq. (3). Similarly, Eq. (7) is the sum of Eq. (1) and k / 2 numbers of Eq. (4) (k is even numbers in this case). k has to be known in order to set up the overall equations and reflects the distribution of reducing equivalents between higher acids synthesis and H 2 production. In a similar fashion, the overall equation for valerate formation, Eq. (9), can be worked out as: (9) ( k + 1 ) CH 3 CH 2 OH + kCH 3 CH 2 COO - = k CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 2 COO - + CH 3 COO - + H + + 2 H 2 + ( k - 1 ) H 2 O"
4,Thermodynamic efficiency,"3.2 Thermodynamic efficiency Since C. kluyveri has numerous caproate formation pathways, it is difficult to determine the exact pathways involved. Thermodynamic feasibility studies of the possible pathways, by calculating the Gibbs free energy and thermodynamic efficiency, η using Eq. (10) (Thauer et al., 1977), may provide estimations: (10) η = N × Δ G ATP Δ G r where N=number of ATP produced per reaction, Δ G ATP =required energy for synthesis of 1mol ATP, and Δ G r =energy released from the reaction. The various values of the Gibbs free energy changes, under different equilibrium conditions and on the assumption that substrates and products are present at 1atm if the reactants are gases or 1M concentration if the reactants are solutes, are listed in Table 4 for Eqs. (6)–(8) at several k values. ATP yields of Eqs. (6)–(8) are N = 1 + 0.3 k per reaction (since m = k + 1 ). Under the physiological conditions ( pH 7 and 25°C), the energy required for ATP formation is between −40 and - 50 kJ mol - 1 ATP with an average value of - 45 kJ mol - 1 ATP (Thauer et al., 1977). The calculation of the thermodynamic efficiencies by Eq. (10) showed that Eqs. (6) and (8) with k = 5 - 8 and Eq. (7) with k = 6 and 8 have η = 50 to 60%, an optimum range commonly observed in Clostridium species (Thauer et al., 1977; Herrmann et al., 2008). Eqs. (6)–(9) at k = 1 - 4 are thermodynamically not possible under the physiological condition since η is much higher than the upper limit of this optimum range (60 %). Temperature and pH have significant influences on the energies released from reactions. Table 4 also shows the Gibbs free energy changes of reactions corrected by pH ( pH 5.5 ) and temperature (30°C) which are commonly used in fermentative H 2 production. Generally, higher temperature increases free energies released from reactions while lower pH decreases them if protons ( H + ) are the product of reactions."
5,Gibbs free energy and thermodynamic efficiencies under the experimental condition,"3.3 Gibbs free energy and thermodynamic efficiencies under the experimental condition Since acetate, butyrate, and ethanol are the major end products of the fermentative H 2 production while caproate formation is a secondary fermentation, the k values of Eqs. (6)–(8) may be different. The empirical data of UFBR were used to estimate the k values. The H 2 -producing performance of UFBR is shown in Fig. 1 . H 2 gradually increased from 25% at HRT of 4.5h to 45% at HRT of 2 h. The buffering capacity was provided to maintain pH between 5 and 7. The volumetric hydrogen production rate (VHPR) increased with the decrease of HRT. The maximum VHPR found was 14.6 L L - 1 d - 1 at 2h HRT. The VHPR was positively correlated to glucose organic loading rate. At steady states of low HRTs, glucose utilization was 50–80%. The hydrogen yield (HY) was 0.5 - 1.0 mol mol - 1 glucose consumed and biomass yield was about 0.1 g - VSS g - 1 glucose consumed. The concentrations of soluble byproducts are shown in Fig. 2 . Ethanol was the major solvent product while acetate and butyrate were the major VFA products. Propionate (1–3% of total VFAs) was always detected. Valerate concentration (not shown) was very low (<0.5mM), probably due to the low concentration of propionate. Caproate appeared after 30d and gradually became the third major VFA with a concentration of 11–23mM. Its appearance indicated the possible presence of C. kluyveri in the UFBR. After startup, the solvent products represented 50–66% of the total soluble byproducts at HRT of 4.5h. As HRT gradually decreased below 2.5h, VFAs replaced solvent products and became the major byproducts (>60%). The Gibbs free energy changes of Eqs. (6)–(8) were calculated by using the experimental values of pH (in Fig. 1), temperature (30°C), and reactant and product concentrations (in Fig. 2). Thermodynamic efficiencies of Eqs. (6)–(8) after 20 days of UBFR operation were calculated and are shown in Fig. 3 . When butyrate was formed from ethanol and acetate (Eq. 6), in Fig. 3a, η was over 60% for k = 3 , 50–60% for k = 4 - 5 , 40-50% for k = 6 - 7 , and below 40% for k = 8 . When caproate was formed from ethanol and acetate (Eq. 7), in Fig. 3b, η was over 80% for k = 2 (not shown), 50–60% for k = 4 , and 40-50% for k = 6 and 8. When caproate was formed from ethanol and butyrate (Eq. 8), in Fig. 3c: η was over 70% for k = 1 - 2 , 60-70% for k = 3 , 50–60% for k = 4 , and 40-50% for k = 5 - 8 . Overall speaking, when k ⩾ 4 Eqs. (6)–(8) are thermodynamically feasible under the experimental condition. In another words, a minimum of 5mol of ethanol per mol of each reaction of Eqs. (6)–(8) can support the formation of butyrate/caproate by C. kluyveri in the UFBR. The result has one mol less of ethanol for Eqs. (6) and (8) or 2 mol less of ethanol for Eq. (7) than that obtained under the physiological condition. The result also has one mol less of ethanol compared to the typical reaction equation used for the fermentation by C. kluyveri in which 6mol of ethanol and 3mol of acetate produce 2mol of H 2 , 3mol of butyrate, and 1 mol of caproate per mol of reaction (Thauer et al., 1968; Seedorf et al., 2008). If 50–60% is considered as an optimum range for η , Eq. (6) with k = 4 - 5 and Eqs. (7) and (8) with k = 4 would most likely occur in the experiment."
6,Significance of caproate formation in the fermentative H 2 production,"3.4 Significance of caproate formation in the fermentative H 2 production Caproate formation is always accompanied by ethanol. The dual roles of ethanol as a byproduct of fermentative H 2 production and the essential substrate for caproate formation indicate that C. kluyveri can form a syntrophy relationship with ethanol-producing bacteria. The reducing equivalents present in ethanol can be redistributed by C. kluyveri to butyrate/caproate/valerate and H 2 . During caproate formation by C. kluyveri, acetate and butyrate can be either consumed or produced depending on the kind of caproate formation pathways utilized. Eq. (6) indicates the direct production of butyrate while Eqs. (7) and (8) represent the consumption of butyrate, either as an intermediate or from an external source. The fate of acetate is similar: consumed in Eqs. (6) and (7) but produced in Eq. (8). These kinds of cyclic mechanisms may interfere with fermentative H 2 production in which H 2 , acetate, and butyrate are major products. According to Eqs. (6) and (8), fermentative H 2 production is not the only process to produce H 2 , butyrate, and acetate at the same time. As such, butyrate/acetate ratio may not be used as an indicative predictor of hydrogen yield from fermentative H 2 production. This contravenes the suggestion made by Hawkes et al. (2007) in which hydrogen yield can be correlated to butyrate/acetate ratio. H 2 is a common product in Eq. (6). Caproate or valerate formation can contribute to H 2 production by releasing certain amount of reducing equivalents from ethanol. According to the above analysis, Eqs. (7) and (8) with k = 4 are the most possible caproate formation pathways with optimum thermodynamic efficiencies under the experimental condition. H 2 production for Eqs. (7) and (8) were 1 and 0.5 mol mol - 1 caproate formed with k = 4 , respectively. H 2 produced from the caproate pathways was 10 to 20 mmol L - 1 substrate medium, given the fact that the average caproate concentration in the effluent was 20mM in the late stages. Since the average total HY was 1 mol mol - 1 glucose consumed and 100 mmol glucose was consumed for every liter of substrate medium, a total of 100 mmol H 2 L - 1 substrate medium was produced. So the contribution of caproate pathways for H 2 production accounted for 10–20% of total H 2 production from the UFBR. This estimation does not include the H 2 contribution of butyrate formation using Eq. 6. Future studies are needed to differentiate H 2 and butyrate formation between carbohydrate fermentation and ethanol fermentation by C. kluyveri. It should be emphasized that caproate formation by C. kluyveri is a secondary fermentation of ethanol and VFAs in the fermentative H 2 production. In this H 2 production process, ethanol represents reducing equivalents that have not been liberated as hydrogen gas (Hawkes et al., 2007). As main species responsible for fermentative H 2 production, saccharolytic clostridia tend to produce VFAs and H 2 at high pH via acidogenesis and facilitate alcohol production at low pH via solventogenesis. Solventogenesis played a significant role in the UFBR as 40–60% of total metabolite products were ethanol (Fig. 2). It resulted in less H 2 production from the UFBR as the observed H 2 yield was much lower than the theoretical yield of 4mol H 2 mol - 1 glucose. At the same time, ethanol produced from the solventogenesis favored the formation of caproate. Although part of the reducing equivalents from ethanol released as H 2 gas during caproate formation, the overall H 2 yield of the fermentative H 2 production was still low. The misconception in Reactions 2–4 (Table 2) is clarified here in this paper: caproate formation is indeed an H 2 -producing secondary fermentation instead of an H 2 -consuming one. The appearance of caproate in the final products indicated that significant solventogenesis occurred and thus the yield H 2 of the fermentative H 2 production was poor."
7,Conclusions,"A detailed energetic analysis of our experiment demonstrated that caproate can be formed through the secondary fermentation of two substrates, either ethanol and acetate or ethanol and butyrate. The analysis also indicated that caproate formation did not consume H 2 but actually produces H 2 . Co-production of caproate and H 2 was thermodynamically feasible under the experimental condition of the present study and considerably contributed to the overall fermentative H 2 production."
