0,Introduction,"Considering depletion of the finite natural resources and inseparable environmental degradation, the scenario for energy matrix and chemical production should make steps towards more diversified and sustainable sources. With such an approach, there is a growing interest in recycling and valorization of different kinds of wastes and residues to value-added products and energy. The wastes from mining and metallurgical industries are among those, which faced increased production due to the growth in the extraction of ores and minerals and their processing over the past century. The treatment of these wastes has many economic and environmental motives such as the conservation of valuable components that contributes to additional industrial revenues, the reduction of the useless area of landfill sites (associated with decreasing of the environmental protection costs), as well as the reduction of energy requirements for material extraction and processing, which translates in lower atmospheric CO2 emissions [1]. An example of such metallurgical residues is currently produced at the metallurgical complex of Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (RTFT) Company located in Sorel-Tracy, Québec, Canada. In a production process of a high pure titania-rich UpGraded slag (UGS™ titanium slag) from ilmenite ore (FeTiO3) at RTFT, significant amounts of metal oxides called UGS oxides residue (hereinafter labeled as UGSO) are produced during the regeneration of hydrochloric acid used to remove a major part of the leachable cations from an intermediate purified slag. This residue is continuously discarded from the process and disposed off in a mining waste site (P- 84, Sorel-Tracy) without marketable use [2]. It is mainly composed of iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) crystalized in the mixed oxide spinel groups of MgFe2O4 and FeAl2O4 forming a solid solution as Mg(Fe,Al)2O4 (82 wt.%) while the excess of Mg (9 wt.%) appears as free MgO [3]. Traces of other elements (less than 1 wt.%) such as Ca, Mn, V, Ti, Cr, Na, Si and K also exist in this residue [2]. Valorization of UGSO to preserve the valuable elements inside and avoiding accumulation of the large amount of this solid waste with negative effect on the landfill will play an important role in putting the UGS process of RTFT on a more sustainable footing. The application of solid industrial wastes in catalyst preparation is a newly emerging research issue [4]. According to an extensive review published by Bennett et al. [5], the focus of the most published research works on this topic is on solid residues (mainly mining and construction wastes), which contain transition, alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides (e.g., iron, magnesium, aluminum, titanium or silicon oxides) as well as carbonaceous species. These compounds are recognized for their promoting effects and supporting properties, as required for developing effective catalysts for several catalytic reactions. Considering the chemical composition of UGSO, such application could be considered as an attractive resurgence for this residue. In our previous study, we explored the potential of Ni incorporated UGSO (Ni-UGSO) as catalyst for sustainable hydrogen production by steam reforming of glycerol, a waste by-product of the common biodiesel route (10 wt.% of biodiesel amount) [6]. What makes the general concept more appealing lies on the fact that the cost of catalyst is potentially one of the most significant expenses in the catalytic valorization of a waste (like glycerol). Reclaiming a waste material to generate the catalyst in such processes makes therefore the system more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. The catalyst prepared by the incorporation of 12.5 wt.% Ni into UGSO through solid-state impregnation method was evaluated for application in the glycerol steam reforming (GSR) process at specific operating conditions suggested as optimum by thermodynamic analysis (T = 580 °C, P = 1 bar, and S/C = 3). By comparing with a Ni-based commercial steam reforming catalyst, the results were very promising especially in terms of coke formation, the main cause of catalyst deactivation in steam reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons that represents an important drawback in long-term industrial applications. The main reasons for the interesting properties of Ni-UGSO catalyst were suggested to be: (i) the dispersion and anchoring of Ni particles by formation of nickel-iron as well as nickel-magnesium mixed oxides, (ii) the lack of a metallic phase through the formation of Ni-Fe alloys, and (iii) the basic characteristic of UGSO due to the presence of oxides such as MgO, CaO and MnO, which could promote dissociative adsorption of water and water gas shift (WGS) reaction. These results proved the capability of the Ni promoted UGSO to act as a powerful GSR catalyst, offering high opportunities to utilize this industrial waste as a promoter and support for developing efficient, stable, and cost-effective steam reforming catalysts. In the present work, we carried out a more in-depth study by focussing on a thorough investigation of the effect of the catalyst synthesis parameters (namely Ni content and incorporation method) on both physicochemical properties and GSR performance of the Ni-UGSO catalyst, as well as the effect of operating temperature on the product distribution. The aims of this investigation were multiple: (i) promoting the formation of those Ni containing active sites that are more coke-resistant and lead to higher glycerol conversion to gaseous products with a larger H2/CO ratio, (ii) further understanding the reaction mechanism between UGSO and Ni, and (iii) examining the effect of GSR operating temperature that plays an important role in the selectivity to gaseous and liquid products, as well as in the coke formation. To reach these targets, nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR), H2-pulse chemisorption analysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to evaluate the physicochemical properties, i.e., the specific surface area, the type of active metal containing species, metal-support interaction, the catalyst reducibility, metal dispersion, metal particle size distribution and morphology. Coke formation was studied in detail by Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and Raman Spectroscopy (RS). Gas and liquid products were analyzed by gas and high-performance liquid chromatography (GC and HPLC). The results were used to calculate the reaction metrics (e.g., glycerol conversion, H2 yield) and the carbon balance, as well as to investigate the GSR reaction pathway over Ni-UGSO. To discuss the effect of operating temperature on the product distribution for GSR over Ni-UGSO catalyst, special attention was given to the effect of temperature on the GSR reaction network including water gas shift (WGS), Boudouard, CO and CO2 methanation, and reverse WGS reactions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni-incorporated UGSO catalysts were prepared through solid-state and ultrasound assisted wet-impregnation methods (hereinafter referred to as SSI-Ni-UGSO and WI-Ni-UGSO, respectively). For both preparation methods, the as-received UGSO was ground to fine powder and sieved to particle sizes less than 75 μm prior to use. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Fisher, 99.9 %) was used as Ni precursor. The SSI-Ni-UGSO was prepared using a method similar to the one described in our previous work [2]. For this purpose, the required amount of UGSO and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O precursor were ground by hand using an agate mortar at ambient temperature for about 5−10 min. The resultant solid was calcined under air atmosphere at 600 °C for 2 h. Different Ni loadings (mass fractions of 2.5−15 %) were used for preparing the SSI-Ni-UGSO catalysts denoted as SSI-xNi-UGSO, where x refers to Ni/(Ni + UGSO) weight ratio (2.5 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %). To investigate the effect of synthesizing method, SSI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst was also prepared using ultrasound-assisted wet impregnation method and was labeled as WI-5%Ni-UGSO. For the wet impregnation method, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution was added to a suspension of UGSO in distilled water (obtained using an ultrasound probe for 5 min) and the ultrasound aided mixing continued for 60 min. Subsequently, the slurry was oven-dried for 10 h at 80 °C, crushed, and calcined at 600 °C for 2 h under air."
3,Characterization techniques,"2.2 Characterization techniques Characterization methods such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, Nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis associated with BET and BJH methods, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and oxidation (TPO), H2-pulse chemisorption, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy (RS) were used to analyze the structure and texture of the catalyst samples. 2.2.1 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy Elemental analysis was performed by Rigaku ZSX Primus X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer (Rigaku Corporation Tokyo, Japan). 2.2.2 Nitrogen adsorption Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of samples (in the range of 0.05−0.998 P/P 0) were obtained by a Micromeritics Gemini VII instrument at −196 °C (77 K). The samples were degassed under vacuum for 10 min at room temperature and 8 h at 300 °C, before each measurement. The BET multipoint method was used to determine the specific surface area (in the range of 0.05–0.3 P/P 0). Moreover, the total pore volume (calculated at P/P 0 = 0.998), the average pore diameter and the average particle size were also determined. 2.2.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) X-ray diffraction data were acquired with an AERIS X-ray diffractometer. Diffraction patterns were obtained using a Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, generated at 40 kV and 8 mA). Data were collected in the 2Ѳ range of 10−80° with an angular step of 2°/min. PANalytical's X'Pert Highscore software with the International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) library and references were used for data processing. 2.2.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The surface chemical composition and the electronic states of the elements inside fresh and reduced catalysts (reduced with 20 % H2/Ar, at 650 °C for 1.5 h) were analyzed by XPS carried out on a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source at 300 W. Binding energy (BE) scale was calibrated by setting the C-C/C–H C1s signal to a binding energy of 285.0 eV C. Surface compositions of Ni, Fe and Mg were evaluated from integrated areas of the Ni 2p, Fe 3 s/Fe 2p and Mg 2p regions. The CasaXPS software was used for Peak fitting and calculation of relative atomic concentrations. 2.2.5 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) TPR analysis were carried out using Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer. About 30 mg of the sample was loaded into a U-shaped quartz sample tube, and a reductive gas mixture of 10.2 v/v% H2/Ar with a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 was passed through it. The temperature of the furnace around the sample tube increased from ambient temperature to 850 °C with a rate of 10 °C min−1, where it was held for 30 min. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to continuously record the signal for H2 consumption. To protect the TCD detector, a cold trap Dewar flask containing a mixture of 2-propanol and liquid N2 (at -80 °C) was used to remove the water formed during reduction, from the analysis gas. For the quantitative analysis, TCD was calibrated using standards and MicroActive 6.01 software was used. 2.2.6 H2-pulse chemisorption H2 adsorption was measured with the Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer equipped with a TCD detector. Typically, 700 mg of the sample were reduced in 10.2 % H2/Ar flow (50 mLmin−1) at 650 °C for 1.5 h, then purged in Ar (50 mLmin−1) for 1 h and cooled down to 50 °C. When the detection baseline was stable, pulses of 10.2 % H2/Ar (0.5079 mL) were dosed to the catalyst every 4 min up to saturation or 10 dosages. Metal dispersion was calculated by assuming that each Ni atom chemisorb one hydrogen atom. 2.2.7 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) A JEOL JEM 1230 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV was used to examine the morphology of the solid catalysts. Prior to the analysis, the samples were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol using an ultrasonic bath, then deposited onto a copper grid coated with carbon films and finally dried naturally at room temperature. 2.2.8 Raman spectroscopy (RS) The Raman analyses were performed on the Senterra II from Bruker Company, by measuring Raman scattering excited at 532 nm with a low laser-power of 6.25 mW at its surface to avoid burning coke on the samples. An optical microscope (Olympus BX 51, 50× objective) with an integrated high-throughput spectrograph was used. The spectra were recorded in air at room temperature on a 20 nm × 20 nm square area on each sample divided into 9 points of measurements. An acquisition time of 3 s with 5 co-additions was considered. To reduce the fluorescence signal, a photobleaching of 6.25 mW with a duration time of 10 ms was used. The measurement, processing, and evaluation of Raman spectra was done using the OPUS 7.8 - Spectroscopy Software. 2.2.9 In-situ temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) Considering the non-homogeneity of coke formation on the catalyst, an in-situ TPO analysis (in the GSR reactor) was designed to burn the coke formed on the whole catalyst. At the end of the 3 h catalytic experiment, the reactor was held at the reaction temperature for an additional 30 min under an inert atmosphere (Ar 50 mL min−1) to eliminate the non-converted reactants and then the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. Subsequently, the temperature was raised from ambient to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, under an oxidative gas mixture of 28.5 % Air/Argon (total flow of 105 mL min−1) and kept until no CO2 was detected. A MicroGC continuously monitored the CO2 and CO concentrations in the reactor effluent. To calculate the total amount of coke formed on the catalyst, the resulted TPO signals were integrated."
4,Catalytic performance evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation Fig. S1 shows the experimental set-up for evaluating the catalysts performance for glycerol steam reforming process. It consisted of a fixed-bed tubular stainless-steel reactor, with an inner diameter of 11 mm and a length of 40 cm. The initial 18 cm of the reactor top, above the catalyst bed, was considered as evaporating /pre-heating zone for liquid feed (glycerol + water solution). An electric tubular furnace supplied heat for both zones. A programmed temperature controller (Omega, CN-7800) coupled with a k-type thermocouple located inside the catalytic bed. The gas flows (H2 and Ar) were controlled using Omega (FMA-2620A) mass flow controllers with an accuracy of ±0.8 % of full scale. A high-performance liquid chromatography pump was used for continuous feeding of the glycerol and water solution through a capillary tube inside the preheating zone of the reactor. The outlet gas stream of the reactor passed through a cold trap to capture the condensable by-products and then through a Drierite column and a 10-micrometer in-line particulate filter before entering the mass flow meter (Brooks 5850i) to measure the total produced gas flow. A Micro-GC (Agilent Technologies, 3000A) equipped with thermal conductivity detector with two columns, a molecular sieve 5A plot (MS 5A, 10 m × 0.320 mm × 12 μm, Argon as carrier gas) and a Plot U (4 m × 0.32 mm × 30 μm, Helium as carrier gas) was used for on-line analysis of gaseous products. At the end of each test, liquid by-products were analyzed using a combination of gas chromatography (GC; Agilent 7820A, with a 600 μm × 2.2 mm × 2 m glass packed column, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID)) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu SPD-M20A HPLC, with an Agilent Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z column, equipped with a refractive index detector (RID)). 0.5 g catalyst was loaded in the middle of the reactor, on a gridded support covered with quartz wool. Then the reactor and all linings were purged with a stream of argon for 15 min. Prior to the catalytic tests, the catalysts were activated by an in-situ reduction pre-treatment using a stream of 21 % H2/argon (volume basis with a total flow of 64 STP mL min−1) at 650 °C for 1.5 h. Then the reactor was purged with Ar and the temperature was ramped up to the reaction temperature. The GSR tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures ranging from 530 to 730 °C. The reactant feed mixture of glycerol (Caledon, ≥99.5 %) and water (water to glycerol molar ratio of 9:1 (S/C = 3)) was injected into the preheating zone of the reactor. The vaporized stream was mixed with argon, as an inert diluent as well as carrier gas, with a flow rate that was set to achieve a molar ratio of feeding reactant to inert gas (FI) of 1.1. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) at standard temperature and pressure (STP) was calculated to be 10,966 cm3 gcat −1 h−1. Temperature programmed reactions (TPRxn) were performed to study GSR gas phase side reactions over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO. To do that, 0.5 g catalyst was loaded in the reactor and similar reduction pre-treatment (as described above) was considered. The samples were then cooled down to room temperature and the reactant gas began flowing through the reactor. For each reaction, the flow rates of reactant gases (balanced in Ar) were selected based on the components of the dry gas stream obtained by a typical GSR over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO at 630 °C and S/C = 3 (which contains 27 % H2, 10 % CO2, 5 % CO and Ar as balance) with a total flow rate of 0.100 standard liter per minuets (SLPM) that results in a GHSV of 12,000 cm3 gcat −1 h-1 at STP. Indeed, for Boudouard reaction; 5 % CO/Ar, CO methanation; 5 % CO and 27 % H2/Ar; WGS; 5 % CO and 54 % H2O (steam)/Ar, reverse WGS as well as CO2 methanation; 10 % CO2 and 27 % H2/Ar were used. Afterwards, the temperature increased from ambient to 750 °C with a rate of 10 °C min−1 and was held at 750 °C for 30 min. The effluent gas was monitored online each 3 min by Agilent MicroGC."
5,Reaction metrics,"2.4 Reaction metrics For each catalytic test, gas samples were taken online using a MicroGC every 15 min and the measured concentrations for each compound were averaged over the time period of a run. The liquid by-products and coke were analyzed and measured batch-wise at the end of each run. The following reaction metrics were used to evaluate the catalytic performance. • The averaged glycerol total conversion (X t) was calculated using the total moles of glycerol injected as feed (G i) and the moles of glycerol detected in the outlet liquid by-products (G o) for the total period of a test: (1) X t ( % ) = ( G i - G o ) G i × 100 • Glycerol conversion to gaseous products (X g) was calculated on a C atom balance basis: (2) X g ( % ) = m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s 3 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d × 100 • H2 yield (Y H2) was calculated using Eq. (3) by considering 7 moles H2 per mole of glycerol as the maximum possible yield of hydrogen according to the GSR stoichiometry (R1, cf. Table 5): (3) Y H 2 ( % ) = m o l e s o f H 2 p r o d u c e d 7 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d × 100 • The yield of carbon-containing gas product (i.e., CO, CO2 and CH4) (Y i) was calculated on a C atom balance basis: (4) Y i ( % ) = m o l e s o f C i n s p e c i e s i 3 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d × 100 where i stands for CO, CO2 and CH4. • The glycerol conversion to liquid by-products (X L) was calculated on a C atom balance basis (excluding the carbon in non-reacted glycerol): (5) X L % = m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e l i q u i d p r o d u c t s 3 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d × 100 • The yield of the detected compounds (Y i) in the liquid phase was calculated using the same equation used for the gas phase compounds (Eq. (4)), where i stands for glyceraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydroxyacetone (acetol), allyl alcohol, acetone, acetic acid, acrolein, acetaldehyde, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol. • To investigate the product distribution in the liquid phase, the selectivity to each detected compound (S L,i) in this phase was calculated based on the ratio of the moles of carbon in a specified species and the total moles of carbon detected in the liquid phase (excluding the non-reacted glycerol): (6) S L , i % = n i x i ∑ n i x i × 100 where n i corresponds to the total moles of species i produced in the liquid phase, and x i is the corresponding number of C atoms in one mole of species i. • The total amount of carbon deposited as coke was measured by in-situ TPO analysis (as described in §2.2.9) performed at the end of each run. The glycerol conversion to coke (X c) was calculated as: (7) X C % = m o l e s o f C d e p o s i t e d a s c o k e 3 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d × 100 • The average rate of coke formation was calculated as: (8) R C = C d e p o s i t e d a s c o k e ( m g ) c a t a l y s t s u r f a c e a r e a m 2 / g × t i m e o n s t r e a m ( h ) Except where indicated, the carbon balance error for all reported data were less than 5%."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physiochemical properties of fresh catalysts,"3.1 Physiochemical properties of fresh catalysts 3.1.1 Effect of Ni content Four samples of SSI-xNi-UGSO catalysts with different Ni content (x = 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 %) were prepared using solid state impregnation method and calcined at 600 °C in air atmosphere for 2 h. The specific surface area of UGSO decreased from 29.8 to 8.5 m2/g after 2.5 % Ni incorporation followed by calcination (Table 1 ). The main contribution in this detrimental impact of the surface area was attributed to the heat treatment (calcination), which caused almost 60 % reduction from 29.8 to 12.0 m2/g, as well as an average particle size increase from 202 to 499 nm. However, part of this decrease in surface area may also be attributed to pore blockage of UGSO due to Ni incorporation. As can be seen in Table 1, increasing Ni loading from 2.5 % to 15 % did not cause a significant effect on the textural properties of SSI-Ni-UGSO catalysts. Fig. 1 (a–e) compares the X-ray diffractograms of calcined UGSO and those of SSI-xNi-UGSO catalysts with different Ni loadings. The XRD pattern of calcined UGSO (Fig. 1a) confirmed the presence of different magnesium-aluminum-iron mixed oxides (Mg (Fe x Al2- x ) O4) (such as MgFeAlO4 (ICDD file # 00-011-0009), Mg (Fe1.26 Al0.74)O4 (ICDD file # 01-088-0867)), and magnesium iron mixed oxides, MgxFeyO4 (such as Mg1.55 Fe1.6O4 (ICDD file # 01-080-0073)). Magnesium was also detected in the form of free periclase (MgO (ICDD file # 01-071-1176)). According to the XRD analysis, the detected traces of other elements such as Ca, Mn, V, Cr, Si, and K in the UGSO (less than 1 wt.%) are found to be bound in oxides as iron vanadium oxide (FeV2O4, ICDD file # 00-015-0122), magnesium chromium iron oxide (Mg(Cr0.4Fe1.6)O4, ICDD file # 01-071-1253), magnesium manganese aluminum oxide (ICDD file # 01-075-0526), and potassium calcium silicate (K4CaSi3O9 ICDD file # 00-039-1427). Using the Scherrer formula for the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense diffraction line at 2Ɵ = 35.68° in the calcined UGSO sample, the average crystal size of magnesium aluminum iron mixed oxides and magnesium iron mixed oxides was calculated to be 20.75 nm. After incorporating 2.5 % of Ni into UGSO (Fig. 1b), the only Ni-containing species detected by XRD consisted of mixed oxides between nickel and iron, such as Ni0.6Fe2.4O4 (ICDD file # 01-087-2337). There are two possibilities for the formation of nickel and iron mixed oxides; Ni may be replaced for (i) Mg+2 in Mg-iron mixed oxides such as MgxFeyO4 or (ii) with part of Fe+2 in magnetite (Fe (Fe)2O4). Generally, most of spinel ferrites have an inverse spinel crystal structure made up of a close-packed oxygen anion that packed in a face centered cubic (FCC) arrangement. Considering their chemical formula as (A2+)(B3+)2O4, half of the B3+ ions occupy the tetrahedral sites and all A2+ ions with the remaining half of B3+ occupy the octahedral sites [7]. The ionic radii for Ni2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+ are 0.69, 0.71, and 0.77 Å, respectively, for the tetrahedral coordination in a spinel structure [8]. The minor shift in the location of the main diffraction line of Fe-containing spinel phases at 2Ɵ = 35.7° in the calcined UGSO to 2Ɵ = 35.6° for SSI-2.5 % Ni-UGSO, as well as the low decrease in the average crystal size assigned to these peaks from 20.75 nm to 18.55 nm, respectively, are more in line with the partial substitution of Mg+2 (ionic radius =0.71 Å) in Mg containing phases (e.g., magnesium iron mixed oxides) with Ni+2 (ionic radius =0.69 Å). Moreover, the slight increase in the intensity of diffraction lines related to MgO (at 2Ɵ = 42.86°, 62.22° and 74.58°) also confirms the removal of a part of Mg from Mg containing mixed oxides by Ni incorporation and the formation of more MgO phase. As indicated in Fig. 1c, by increasing Ni content to 5 %, the intensity of the diffraction lines related to nickel-iron mixed oxides were amplified, possibly due to the formation of more nickel-iron oxides with higher Ni/Fe ratios, such as NiFe2O4 (ICDD file # 00-003-0875). Moreover, a portion of Ni was also oxidized to a Mg-rich (Mg,Ni)O mixed oxides like (3MgO)(NiO) (ICDD file # 00-003-0996). As suggested by X'Pert Highscore software with a higher probability, increasing the relative amount of Ni to 10 % (Fig. 1d) and 15 % (Fig. 1e) led to the formation of (MgO)(NiO) (ICDD file # 00-003-0999) and Mg0.4Ni0.6O (ICDD file # 00−034-0410), respectively, with higher Ni/Mg ratios, as well as nickel-iron mixed oxides with higher Ni/Fe ratios (such as Ni1.43Fe1.7O4 (ICDD file # 01-080-0072)). However, due to the overlap of the respective XRD diffraction lines of several species existing inside the UGSO and Ni-UGSO catalysts, it was not possible to unambiguously conclude the rearrangement of the crystal structure of UGSO after Ni incorporation. For example, the diffraction lines of Fe-containing spinel phases (i.e., MgFe2O4, Fe3O4, and NiFe2O4) are very close together and the lines labeled for NiO may also be caused by MgO or a solid solution of (Ni,Mg)O. Additional insight into the effect of Ni content on the structural features of SSI-xNi-UGSO catalysts is therefore provided by investigating the reduction behavior of UGSO before and after loading different amounts of Ni using TPR analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , the peaks in the TPR profile of UGSO are related to the H2 consumption due to the reduction of different iron oxides species including MgFeAlO4 (MgO·FeAlO3), Fe3O4 (FeO·Fe2O3), and MgFe2O4 (MgO·Fe2O3), as identified by XRD analysis. The first reduction peak with the maximum at 535 °C can be assigned to the reduction of a part of Fe3+ to Fe2+ (such as hematite to magnetite) [9,10]. The second peak with maximum at 654 °C can be attributed to the reduction of remaining Fe3+ to Fe2+ (such as magnetite conversion to wustite (FeO)). The third broad peak with the maximum at 710 °C can be related to the further reduction of FeO phase to metallic iron (Fe°) [9,10]. As discussed earlier by XRD analysis, depending on the amount of Ni loading, the incorporation of nickel into UGSO can lead to the formation of different Ni containing species (e.g., NixFeyO4 and (Nix,Mgy)O). The simultaneous reduction of these oxides and the existing reducible Fe containing oxides in the UGSO, resulted in broad H2 consumption peaks (Fig. 2). At lower temperatures, the NiO interacting with MgO could be reduced to metallic Ni (Ni°) [11]. The reduction of Ni2+ interacting with iron oxide species, as well as the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ and Fe° will then occur at higher temperatures [12,13]. It has been suggested that during the reduction of NiFe2O4, part of Fe3+ can first be reduced to Fe2+ leading to the formation of Fe3O4 and NiO [14]. In the next step, NiO reduces to Ni°, which can be transformed into NiFe alloys by further reduction of Fe3O4 to Fe° and FeO. Additional FeO reduction will result in Fe° formation [14]. The TPR profiles (Fig. 2) show a slight shift of peak maximum toward lower temperatures by increasing Ni content which could be attributed to a weaker interaction of Ni with UGSO probably due to higher tendency for formation of (Ni,Mg)O mixed oxides with higher Ni/Mg ratios (as suggested by XRD results). As expected, the quantitative analysis of the TPR profiles confirmed a higher amount of H2 uptake by increasing the Ni loading from 5 % to 15 % (9.22 versus 10.79 mmol gcat−1). The effect of Ni content on the metal dispersion was investigated by H2-pulse chemisorption analysis. According to the results presented in Table 1, increasing the amount of Ni content results in a slight decrease in the metal dispersion. The very low H2 adsorption on the SSI-x%Ni-UGSO samples reflects the presence of low amount of metallic phase on the surface of these catalysts, due to the partial coverage of Ni particles with a layer of partially reduced iron oxide species (discussed in detail in §3.2.3). 3.1.2 Effect of synthesizing method Among the different synthesizing methods (e.g., impregnation, sol-gel, and co-precipitation) for preparing the supported metal (oxide) particles, impregnation can be used for incorporating Ni active sites into UGSO structure. The ability of this method for high metal loadings and its practical simplicity can lead to a convenient expedient on an industrial scale. This technique is applied by using a solvent (wet impregnation, WI) or without solvent (solid-state impregnation, SSI). In case of SSI, the production of residues and the need for solvent removal, purification or recycling are avoided. However, by WI method, using a solvent for active metal incorporation may help in a more homogenous and higher metal dispersion. We therefore investigated the effect of the Ni incorporation method on Ni-UGSO physiochemical properties and its subsequent GSR performance. Two samples of 5%Ni-UGSO catalysts were prepared using SSI and WI methods and denoted as SSI-5%Ni-UGSO and WI-5%Ni-UGSO, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the results for the effect of the synthesizing method on the specific surface area, the total pore volume, the average pore diameter, as well as the average particle size of the mentioned catalysts. As can be seen, a higher surface area was obtained using WI (13.1 versus 9.9 m2/g), which could be ascribed to the formation of Ni containing species with lower average particle size (457.1 versus 604.2 nm). Fig. 3 shows the effect of the synthesizing method on the crystal structure of 5%Ni-UGSO catalysts. The X'Pert Highscore software suggested that the diffraction lines in the pattern of WI-5%Ni-UGSO are associated to magnesium iron oxides (MgxFeyO4), such as MgFe+2,3O4 (ICDD file # 00-017-0464), magnesium aluminum iron oxides (Mg(FexAl2-x)O4), such as Mg(FeAl)2O4 (ICDD file # 00-021-0540), MgO (ICDD file # 00-002-1207), NiO (ICDD file # 00-001-1239) and/or a solid solution among them ((Ni,Mg)O). After Ni incorporation, lesser shifts in the position of the main diffraction peaks of Fe/Mg-bearing mixed oxides inside calcined UGSO (2θ = 35.68° and 2θ = 43.3°) were observed in the case of WI method (2θ = 35.66° and 2θ = 43.29°) in comparison with SSI method (2θ = 35.57° and 2θ = 43.23°). This reveals that the substitution of Mg2+ and/or Fe2+ of these phases by Ni2+ in the WI method was insignificant and in a lesser extent (if happened) as compared to the SSI method, which is well in-line with the low possibility suggested (by the software) for the formation of Ni/Fe mixed oxides (such as (Ni,Fe)Fe2O4 (ICDD file # 00-023-1119) inside WI sample. This assertion will be further supported by XPS and TPR analysis results. To shed more lights on the effect of synthesizing method on the chemical composition and the electronic states of the elements, the 5%Ni-UGSO catalysts (WI and SSI) were further characterized by XPS analysis. The respective high-resolution spectra for both catalysts are shown in Fig. S2a–c (Supporting Information) for the Ni 2p, Mg 2p and Fe 2p regions. These species are highlighted because of their expected importance in the catalytic performance. According to Table 3 , which presents the results for XPS binding energies and surface compositions, the surfaces of both catalysts are more enriched with Mg and Ni containing oxides while Fe was barely detectable on the surface. The Ni/Mg and Ni/Fe atomic ratios derived from XPS analysis (Table 3) are considerably higher than those calculated by XRF (∼Ni/Mg = 0.2, Ni/Fe = 0.5). This indicates the higher tendency of Ni for accumulating on the surface of both catalysts, however this tendency is higher in the case of WI sample by comparing the surface Ni/Mg and Ni/Fe ratios for two catalysts (Ni/Mg = 1.3 versus 0.9 and Ni/Fe = 43.5 versus 17.5). The main peak at 855 eV in the Ni 2p3/2 transition of both catalysts (Fig. S2a and Table 3) is almost symmetric and narrower than that of NiO (which has a pronounced shoulder on the high BE side of the main peak [15], suggesting that the state of Ni2+ ions on the surface of these samples is different from NiO. Such characteristic peaks could reflect the interaction of Ni2+ ions with MgO, as reported by Yoshida et al. [15]. In the case of WI sample, this peak may also be attributed to the presence of Ni(OH)2 on the surface of (Ni,Mg)O. The lower Ni/Mg ratio of SSI sample compared with WI (0.9 versus 1.3) indicates that Ni2+ ions diffused more into MgO in SSI catalyst. As can be seen in Fig. S2a, comparing with WI sample, the deconvolution of the peak associated to the Ni 2p orbital in the SSI sample generated two more component peaks at 864.6 ev and 856.6 eV. Therefore, another possible candidate for the chemical states of Ni in the surface of SSI catalyst could be the Ni2+ ions located in the octahedral site bonded to oxygen atoms in NiFe2O4 [16], which confirms the XRD analysis result. The Mg 2p spectrum (Fig. S2b) is detected at binding energy of 49.4 eV (Table 3), providing evidence of the existence of Mg2+ in the (Ni,Mg)O [17,18]. An additional deconvoluted component peaks at 50.8 ev was also found for SSI sample that can be assigned to the binding states of Mg2+ in MgO [18]. This result is also compatible with the findings of XRD analysis. The Fe 2p3/2 peak position at 711.2 ev (for WI) and 710.8 ev (for SSI) as well as the satellite peak at 719 eV (Fig. S2c and Table 3) points toward the presence of Fe+3 which could be assigned to Fe3O4 [19]. A slightly higher binding energy for Fe 2p3/2 peak for WI catalyst may also originated from the presence of Fe3+ ions bonded to hydroxyl [−OH] groups [20]. Considering the XPS results for Ni 2p region of SSI sample, Fe3+ could also exist in NiFe2O4 in SSI catalyst. Generally, due to the facile diffusion of Ni2+ ions into MgO support, in the NiO/MgO system there is a high tendency for the formation of (Ni,Mg)O solid solutions. Using an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 for incorporation of Ni into the UGSO trough WI method will result in the formation of Mg(OH)2. This facilitate the diffusion of Ni2+ ions into MgO by WI method. However, in the case of SSI method, mixing trough grinding reduces the particle size of the precursors which results in the increase of the contact area between reacting solids and the decrease of the diffusion resistance of Ni+2 into Mg and Fe containing oxides. This leads in a deeper diffusion of Ni into MgO as well as the formation of nickel/iron mixed oxides (such as NiFe2O4) resulting in stronger metal-support interactions. Fig. 4 compares the H2‐TPR profiles of the 5%Ni-UGSO catalysts prepared by SSI and WI methods. As can be seen, the peak in the profile related to the WI-5%Ni-UGSO sample (Fig. 4a) is relatively narrower compared to SSI-5%Ni-UGSO, suggesting a more homogeneous distribution in the types of formed nickel containing species by this method. A quantitative analysis of these profiles indicated a higher amount of H2 uptake below 650 °C (which is the temperature for catalyst reduction pre-treatment before GSR reaction) for WI-5%Ni-UGSO (3.4 mmol·gcat−1) in comparison to SSI-5%Ni-UGSO (2.7 mmol·gcat−1). Moreover, the maximum of the peak was observed at lower temperature (710 °C) for the WI prepared catalyst as compared to that prepared through SSI (720 °C). These observations, which are in line with XPS analysis results, suggest the weaker interactions between Ni and the UGSO when prepared by WI rather SSI method. Fig. 5 (a, b) shows the TEM results for 5%Ni-UGSO catalysts prepared by SSI and WI after being reduced in H2 atmosphere (20 % H2/Ar, at 650 °C for 1.5 h). As indicated in the particle size histograms, smaller metallic particles with an average diameter of 19.6 nm were formed after reducing SSI-5%Ni-UGSO in comparison to the reduced WI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst, where metallic particles with an average diameter of 38.1 nm were formed. Moreover, in contrary to our initial hypothesis, using WI method resulted in a less homogenous metallic particle size distribution (a higher standard deviation of 14.6 versus 5.5). Using the average particle size from the TEM results in equation D(%) = 97.1/dnm [21], the metal dispersion on SSI-5%Ni-UGSO and WI-5%Ni-UGSO are calculated to be 5.0 % and 2.5 % respectively. The lower metal dispersion after reduction pre-treatment obtained by WI prepared sample, despite the smaller initial average particle size in the fresh status (Table 2), is another confirmation for a weaker interaction of Ni with UGSO trough WI method."
8,Evaluating catalytic performance for GSR,"3.2 Evaluating catalytic performance for GSR 3.2.1 Non-catalytic GSR reaction Glycerol steam reforming is a complex reaction by which both thermal decomposition and catalytic reactions participate in syngas production through formation of several intermediates. Considering the thermal instability of glycerol, this compound can easily decompose at the elevated temperature of steam reforming process, resulting in olefins (e.g., C2H4, C3H6), CO, H2, CO2, CH4, water, and oxygenate products (acetaldehyde, acrolein) before reaching the catalyst bed [22,23]. Parallel bond-cleavage (CC bond cleavage) and radical-initiated type reactions were reported to be the cause of formation of such products [22,23]. Chiodoa et al. [22] reported that in the glycerol pyrolysis, CH2(OH)CH(OH) and CH2 OH radicals are initially formed as a result of the CC bond dissociation, and then transformed into H2, C2H4, and CH4. To ascertain the extent of pyrolysis phenomena that could contribute to the glycerol steam reforming, a non-catalytic test (blank test) was carried out at 630 °C and S/C molar ratio of 3. As it can be seen in Fig. 6 a, in the absence of catalyst, glycerol significantly decomposes with a total conversion of 97 %, while the conversion to gaseous products is only 48 %, with CO (Y CO = 39 %), H2 (Y H2 = 22 %), CO2 (Y CO2 = 7%), and CH4 (Y CH4 = 2%) as the main components detected (Fig. 6b). The conversion to liquid products was determined to be 19 % (Fig. 6a), while oxygenates such as glyceraldehyde (Y Glyceraldehide = 9.5 %), formaldehyde (Y formaldehyde = 3.1 %), acetol (Y acetol = 3.2 %), and allyl alcohol (Y allyl alcohol = 1.4 %) are the major products identified along with the un-reacted glycerol (Fig. 6c). Other compounds such as acetone, acetic acid, acrolein, acetaldehyde, propylene glycol, and ethanol were also detected with a yield less than 1%. However, it should be noted that considering X L = 19 %, the error in the carbon balance in the case of blank test is about 29 %. This error could be raised to some other liquid by-products have escaped identification/quantification due to their complexity. Therefore, the real conversion to liquid products should be higher than 19 %. The low CO2 yield (Y CO2 = 7%) confirms WGS weak activity and the presence of H2 is attributed to the dehydrogenation reactions, which also results in the formation of glyceraldehyde. As will be discussed in §3.2.2, molecular dehydration could participate in glycerol pyrolysis that leads to production of hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) and acetol (Fig. 7 ). 3-HPA could further convert to acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and allyl alcohol. Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde may also be formed through bond-cleavage and radical-initiated type reaction during glycerol pyrolysis. Acetaldehyde could further decompose to CH4 and CO (CH3CHO → CH4 + CO) [22]. 3.2.2 Effect of Ni content To investigate the influence of Ni content on the Ni-UGSO catalytic performance for GSR, a series of experiments were performed using the prepared SSI-xNi-UGSO catalysts (x varies in the range of 0 (raw UGSO) to 15 %) at 630 °C and S/C molar ratio of 3 for 3 h time-on-stream (TOS). As indicated in Fig. 6a, compared to the non-catalytic reaction (§3.2.1), using UGSO as catalyst does not cause a significant change in glycerol conversion to gaseous and liquid products. However, the product distribution in both phases is notably different. In the gas phase products, using UGSO resulted in the increase of H2/CO and CO2/CO molar ratios from 1.3 to 2.8 and 0.2 to 1.0, respectively. This demonstrates the catalytic ability of iron presents in UGSO to prompt more conversion into syngas during GSR (Path I in Fig. 7), as well as the superior contribution of WGS reaction. Fig. 7 outlines the details about different reaction pathways involved in catalytic GSR. Dehydrogenation (Path I) of glycerol leads to the formation of glyceraldehyde (2, 3-dihydroxy-propanal), while glycerol dehydration (Path II) produces acetol (1-hydroxy-2-propanone) and 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) as key intermediates. From that point, depending on the reaction progress, several gases and condensable by-products could form along with the syngas as the main desired product in this process. The syngas (H2 and CO) production route (Path I) includes successive dehydrogenation (OH and CH bonds cleavage) and decarbonylation (CC bond dissociation) of the glyceraldehyde intermediate [24,25]. Further reaction of the produced CO with water through WGS reaction promotes conversion into H2 [24]. Comparing the detected oxygenate compounds in the liquid phase for UGSO with those of the blank test (Table 4 ), an interesting observation is the increase of the selectivity toward allyl alcohol from 7.4 % to 29.8 %. As can be seen in Fig. 7, if glycerol dehydration originates by central OH group removal, unstable 3-HPA intermediate will form, which can then be easily converted to acrolein by further dehydration [26]. The selective hydrogenation of the double bond in CO (versus CC) of acrolein will lead to allyl alcohol production. The hydrogen needed for this reaction could directly come from in-situ produced molecular H2 and/or be supplied by an alcohol (such as glycerol or any other OH containing species) through a hydrogen transfer mechanism [27]. Generally, catalysts with strong Brønsted acidity are needed for glycerol dehydration. Liu et al. [27] and Tago et al. [28] investigated the catalytic conversion of glycerol over different iron oxide-based catalysts. It has been suggested that in such cases, the required Brønsted acidity could be provided by the surface hydroxyl groups of iron oxide and/or water autoprotolysis on the iron oxide’s surface defects [27]. According to the results presented in Table 4, the selectivity (as defined by Eq. 6) toward acetone also increased from 3.1 % (non-catalytic GSR) to 6.6 % (GSR over UGSO). The reversed aldol condensation reaction on 3-HPA intermediate (Fig. 7) could lead to the formation of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, which might be transformed through oxidation into acetic acid and formic acid [29]. Ketonization of two molecules of carboxylic acids (acetic acid) could further result in ketone (acetone), CO2, and water production [30]. As confirmed by Tago et al. [28], the increase in acetone production may be related to the capability of the lattice oxygen of iron oxides species in UGSO to oxidize the acetaldehyde into acetic acid and then converting it to acetone via ketonization. The decrease in the yield of glyceraldehyde from 9.5 (non-catalytic GSR) to 4.6 % (GSR over UGSO) also confirms the progress on the syngas production pathway over UGSO (Path I in Fig. 7). A complete glycerol total conversion was obtained by incorporating 2.5 wt.% Ni into UGSO (Fig. 6a). Although there was not a substantial improvement in the total conversion, a more significant decomposition to gaseous products occurred, resulting in X g = 88 %. The results also show a noteworthy increase in H2 yield (Y H2 = 57 %), as well as in H2/CO (4.2) and CO2/CO (1.6) molar ratios. Characterization of the liquid phase (Fig. 6c) indicated a conversion to liquid products of as low as 0.4 % with a carbon balance error of ∼11 % (Fig. 6a) . Here, glyceraldehyde appears to be the prominent compound in the liquid phase (S L,Glyceraldehide = 32 %, Table 4). The increase in H2/CO molar ratio achieved by Ni incorporation into UGSO is an evidence for the main contribution of syngas production route (Path I in Fig. 7), which is compatible with the presence of glyceraldehyde as the primary component in the liquid phase by-products. This behavior could be justified based on a more efficient activation and dissociation of CH and CC bonds over Ni compared to Fe [28,31]. Doubling the relative amount of Ni to 5 % caused an increase in the conversion to gaseous products from 88 % to almost 100 %, along with increase in H2 yield from 57 % to 74 % as well as H2/CO and CO2/CO molar ratios from 4.2 to 5.5 and 1.6 to 2.1, respectively. The results presented in Fig. 6a–c show only slight differences in the activity of catalysts with more than 5 % Ni loading. For Ni content ≥5 %, the liquid phase condensate mainly consists of un-reacted water, while traces of acetone and formaldehyde (with yields less than 0.03 %) were the only detected compounds. TPO analysis of the post-reaction catalysts was used to investigate the effect of Ni content on the quantity and nature of the carbonaceous species formed on the used catalysts. The amount of carbon burned during the in-situ TPO (as described in the section §2.2.9) is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 6d. The average rate of carbon formation was calculated using Eq. (8) and the results are presented in the inset of Fig. 6d. For the UGSO sample, the CO2 evolution is initiated at about 310 °C, while the largest part of coke is burned at temperatures higher than 350 °C. The TPO profile in this case is characterized by the presence of two features, a relatively intense peak at about 380 °C and a weaker broad peak between 450 –600 °C. The TPO profiles of Ni containing catalysts exhibit an intense peak in the range of 450−500 °C. The most intense TPO peak of 2.5 % Ni containing sample shifted from 497 °C to 460 °C and 458 °C by increasing Ni loading to 5 % and 10 %, respectively. For 10 % Ni content a shoulder with a maximum at 440 °C could be clearly observed. As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 6d, higher average rate of coke formation was obtained by increasing Ni loading. It has been reported that the oxidation of carbon deposits near metallic particles occurs at lower temperatures since it could be catalyzed by the metal at the metal-support interface, while the carbon with graphitic structure present on the support burns at higher temperatures [32,33]. Moreover, Sánchez-Sánchez et al. [34] indicated that the filamentous coke associated with Ni particles (as explained in §3.2.4) oxidizes in the 300−530 °C temperature region and the oxidation of carbonaceous deposits with different graphitization degrees occurs above 530 °C. According to the in-situ TPO analysis results, the coke for the catalysts containing 2.5−10 wt.% Ni was mostly oxidized in the 400−530 °C temperature range, indicating the predominance of amorphous filamentous type coke formation. 3.2.3 Effect of synthesis method The optimum Ni loading amount (5 wt.%) found in §3.2.2 was used to investigate the effect of Ni incorporation method (SSI and WI) on the GSR performance over Ni-UGSO catalyst (Fig. 8a–d). Despite the presence of more readily reducible Ni containing species in WI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst (§3.1.2), a lower glycerol conversion to gaseous products (89.5 %) and H2 yield (68 %) were obtained compared to SSI-5%Ni-UGSO (Xg = 99.5 % and YH2 = 74.4 %) (Fig. 8a). Regarding the carbon-based gas product distribution (Fig. 8b), the yields of CO and CH4 did not change, while almost 14 % higher CO2 yield was obtained through the SSI method. Fig. 8c shows the in-situ TPO profiles and the average rate of coke formation (inset) for the two post-reaction 5%Ni-UGSO catalysts after 3 h GSR at 630 °C. As indicated in this figure, the average rate of coke formation over WI-5%Ni-UGSO is significantly higher (2.3-fold) compared to SSI-5%Ni-UGSO (1.18 instead of 0.52 mgcoke h−1 (m2/gcat)−1). This result is in line with the higher H2 and CO2 yields of SSI-5%Ni-UGSO, which confirms its superior potential for coke gasification by steam during the reaction. Moreover, the temperature corresponding to the TPO peak shifted from 460 °C (SSI-5%Ni-UGSO) to 540 °C (WI-5%Ni-UGSO), which shows a higher degree of graphitization in the formed coke over WI-5%Ni-UGSO. The two Raman vibrational modes of sp 2-bonded carbon species, centered around 1340–1350 cm−1 (D-band) and 1580−1600 cm-1 (G-band) [35,36] exist in the spectra of both 5%Ni-UGSO catalysts (Fig. 8d). The broadness of these peaks confirms the presence of non-homogenous types of coke, such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, and nanocrystalline graphite [37]. The ratio of the intensity of these peaks (I D/I G) will decrease by increasing the degree of graphitization in the carbon species [38]. According to Fig. 8d, the D and G bands of WI-5%Ni-UGSO are broader than SSI-5%Ni-UGSO, which indicates a higher non-homogeneity in the types of coke formed on the catalyst prepared through WI. Moreover, the I D/I G ratio decreased from 1.3 (SSI-5%Ni-UGSO) to 0.5 (WI-5%Ni-UGSO). Therefore, as suggested by the TPO analysis results, more structured types of coke were formed on the WI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst. To throw more light on the superior GSR performance of SSI-5%Ni-UGSO compared to WI-5%Ni-UGSO, H2 adsorption on both catalysts were measured by H2-pulse chemisorption analysis. According to Table 2, very low metal dispersions were obtained based on the amount of H2 adsorption. These amounts (0.17 % for SSI sample and 0.13 % for WI) are much lower than the metal dispersions calculated based on TEM analysis results (5.0 % for SSI sample and 2.5 % for WI). Interestingly, a similar behavior has been reported for Ni-Fe [39] and Rh-Fe [40,41] catalysts. The very low amount of H2 adsorption on both 5%Ni-UGSO (WI and SSI) samples reflects the low amount of metallic phase on the surface. This indicates that the superior GSR performance of both catalysts is not due to a high metallic active phase dispersion, but to a synergic effect related to the interaction of Ni with the elements inside UGSO (mainly Fe and Mg), which is more effective in the case of catalyst prepared by SSI method. To elucidate this synergy effect, the surface of both reduced catalysts was investigated by XPS analysis. Fig. S3(a–b) shows the Ni 2p3/2 XPS for the reduced catalysts and the changes in the elemental atomic surface ratios after reduction are listed in Table 3. Based on the binding energies near 858 eV and 852 eV (Fig. S3), oxidized and metallic Ni coexist on the surface of both reduced catalysts. However, the component peak related to metallic Ni (at 852.4 eV for WI and 852.95 eV for SSI) is more pronounced for WI sample (the clear shoulder at the lower binding energies). Comparing the surface composition of fresh and reduced catalysts (Table 3), the Ni/Fe atomic ratios considerably decrease from 17.5 to 0.37 and 43.5 to 0.35 for SSI and WI samples, respectively, after the reduction pre-treatment. This finding, along with the absence of metallic Fe (∼707 eV) in the Fe 2p spectra of the reduced catalysts (which mainly consists of Fe2+/Fe3+, i.e., Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 at ca. 725.3 eV and 714.5 eV [42], demonstrate the partial coverage of Ni particles by partially reduced iron oxide species, thus supporting the low H2 adsorption determined by the H2-pulse chemisorption analysis (Table 2). The formation of partially reduced oxides on metals supported on reducible oxides (such as Fe2O3, TiO2, and V2O5), which covers the metal particle after high temperature reduction and suppresses the H2 chemisorption on metals, has been reported in the literature [43,44]. This behavior can occur in the case of strong metal-support interactions. The partially reduced iron oxide species (coordinatively unsaturated ferrous sites [45]), play an important role in supplying oxygen for the gasification of the carbonaceous species (suppression of coke deposition) due to their redox properties [46]. The synergic cooperation observed in the present system (Ni-FexOy) is the cornerstone of the high GSR performance by activating the glycerol on the Ni species and supplying the oxygen atom to the carbonaceous intermediate from neighboring FexOy sites. Furthermore, as discussed in our previous work [2], in the Ni-UGSO catalysts the basic properties of MgO in close contact with Ni could also promote the dissociation of water into hydroxyl groups and help in the gasification of the coke precursors deposited on the catalyst surface. The superior performance of SSI prepared catalyst could be related to (i) a more effective anchoring of Ni due to the formation of (Ni,Mg)O mixed oxides through a more significant Ni diffusion into MgO (as discussed in §3.1.2) and (ii) the formation of nickel-iron mixed oxides (e.g., NiFe2O4). Through the SSI method, the strong interaction of Ni with UGSO hinders the formation of free Ni particles after reduction and causes a more effective cooperation between Ni, Fe, and Mg containing species. In case of WI sample, the only Ni containing species formed on the catalyst surface are (Ni,Mg)O mixed oxides with a weaker interaction of Ni with MgO. This results in the formation of more agglomerated metallic Ni particles after catalyst reduction, which induces more structurally ordered coke formation. 3.2.4 Effect of operating temperature on GSR performance over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO The effect of the reaction temperature (in the range of 530−730 °C) on GSR performance over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO is illustrated in Fig. 9 a–d. From the thermodynamic point of view, WGS is favored at lower temperatures resulting in higher H2 yield, while a higher contribution of glycerol decomposition and a lower coke as well as methane formation are expected at higher temperatures [38,47]. According to the results, almost complete glycerol conversions to gaseous products (Fig. 9a) were obtained for temperatures above 580 °C where the liquid phase condensate consists mainly of un-reacted water. The highest H2 yield (80.7 %), H2/CO (6.7) and CO2/CO (2.4) molar ratios were achieved at 580 °C (Fig. 9a–b), closely approaching the thermodynamic equilibrium values (Y H2 =84.05 %, H2/CO = 9.3, CO2/CO = 3.5), which is consistent with the result of the investigation of the WGS reaction over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO ((§3.2.5, Fig. 10 a). The higher amount of methane formed by increasing temperature (Fig. 9c), which is not in agreement with the thermodynamic prediction, can be justified by the results of methanation reaction over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO (§3.2.5, Fig. 10d). Depending on the catalyst characteristics and reaction conditions, various types of carbonaceous deposits that differ in morphology and reactivity can form [48]. At lower operating temperatures and over catalysts with strong acidic or basic properties, an amorphous film of carbon deposits may encapsulate catalyst active sites, through dehydration and polymerization reactions [49,50]. Another possibility is the formation of amorphous whisker (filamentous) type carbon triggered by the dissolution and diffusion of carbon atoms into the metal catalyst particles to form metal carbides. Nickel and cobalt are known to be susceptible for this kind of coke formation [49]. Further ageing of both encapsulating and filamentous carbon deposits under severe and prolonged reaction conditions may result in graphitic type coke formation [49]. Fig. 9d compares the in-situ TPO profiles and the average rate of coke formation for the used catalysts after GSR for temperature higher than 580 °C where the same glycerol conversion (almost 100 %) were achieved. As can be seen, operating GSR at lower temperature (580 °C) results in higher average rate of coke formation. This coke starts burning at lower temperature range, probably due to the formation of higher amount of amorphous carbon. Using a higher GSR operating temperature (730 °C), a lower amount of more structured coke deposits was formed (Fig. 9d) due to the weaker participation of Boudouard reaction which will be discussed in §3.2.5 (Fig. 10b). 3.2.5 GSR reaction network studies over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst The main overall glycerol steam reforming reaction (R1) consists of glycerol decomposition (R2) and water gas shift reaction (R3) (Table 5 ). However, there are several possibilities for side reactions that contribute to the degradation of H2 purity and affect the product distribution as well as catalyst stability in this process [51]. In this context, for a further understanding and a deeper discussion of the temperature dependency of GSR over Ni-UGSO catalyst, the catalytic activity of SSI-5%Ni-UGSO (as the optimum developed catalyst) was investigated up to 750 °C for some of the most important reactions in the GSR reaction network, including WGS (R3), Boudouard (R4), methanation (R5 and R6), and reverse water gas shift (R-WGS). The related TPRxn profiles are presented in Fig. 10a–d. According to Fig. 10a, the WGS reaction (R3) starts at temperatures above 300 °C with a maximum at 475 °C, indicating the capability of Ni-UGSO to act as a high temperature WGS catalyst. Concerning the Boudouard reaction, the disproportionation of CO into CO2 and carbon (R4) (Fig. 10b) was observed in the temperature interval of 260−710 °C with a maximum CO2 (and consequently carbon) production rate at about 514 °C. Almost no CO2 was detected over 710 °C, which is consistent with the thermodynamic limitation of this reaction in this temperature area [52]. The carbon formation was investigated by an in-situ TPO of the used catalyst (inset of Fig. 10b) and confirms the possibility of different types of coke formation by Boudouard reaction depending on the reaction temperature. The catalytic activity for R-WGS and CO2 methanation (R6) is shown in Fig. 10c. Based on the results, R-WGS occurs above 310 °C, while no methane was detected through the CO2 methanation with H2. Generally, due to considerable kinetic barriers, the eight-electron reduction of C from +4 in CO2 to -4 in CH4 in the presence of H2 is hardly possible [53]. According to R6, the stoichiometric H2/CO2 molar ratio for CO2 methanation is 4, while in the feed selected for this work (§2.3), this ratio is 2.7. The obtained results show that the R-WGS reaction dominates in such conditions compared to CO2 methanation. The results for CO methanation are indicated in Fig. 10d. Based on the thermodynamic analysis in the range of 200–500 °C, the high equilibrium constants of R4, R5, R7, and R8 cause them to play an important role in the CO methanation reaction system [54]. As can be seen in Fig. 10d, the reaction between H2 and CO over SSI-5% Ni-UGSO catalyst led to methane formation above 400 °C, which could be a result of methanation (R5) and inversed methane dry reforming (R7). Moreover, CO2 was also detected in the produced gas stream above 310 °C and reaches a maximum at 470 °C. This can be explained by the contribution of both inversed CH4 dry reforming (R7) and Boudouard (R4) reactions that can easily occur at a H2/CO ratio lower than 3. Thermodynamically, methane formation through methanation should decrease by increasing the temperature due to its exothermic character; however, according to the results, after a decrease between 470 and 580 °C an increase in CH4 production was observed in the range of 580−720 °C. This may be the result of the formation of free Fe° and/or Ni-Fe alloys by further reduction of nickel and iron containing specious at elevated temperatures (discussed by TPR results in §3.1.1) [14], which favors the methanation reaction due to the hydrogenating power of iron [12,55]."
9,Conclusion,"Using the UGSO metallurgical residue to valorize glycerol (a waste by-product of biodiesel production) to produce hydrogen creates a synergy between a metallurgical and a chemical process that suits well with the concepts of industrial ecology and sustainable development. Moreover, it also helps remove the economic and environmental barriers towards industrial development of biodiesel (a renewable source of energy) and leads to the production of H2 as a clean energy carrier and fundamental feedstock for chemical industries. Such an approach in which an industrial waste is used for an environmental application, especially in cases where the use of common products is not economically justified, is categorized at the highest level of sophistication for waste valorization. The present study mainly focussed on the investigation and understanding of the effect of the synthesizing parameters (Ni content and Ni incorporation method) and operating temperature on the gas and liquid products and coke formation. An attempt was also made to study the effect of synthesizing parameters on the reaction between Ni and UGSO, as well as on the physiochemical properties of Ni-UGSO catalyst. The summary of the results of this study is presented as follows: I Comparing with a non-catalytic GSR reaction, the results of using raw UGSO as catalyst clearly confirmed the contribution of UGSO in the WGS reaction, as well as the ability of iron presented in this residue to enhance the syngas production route during the GSR process. II Incorporating Ni into UGSO promoted the syngas production route due to the stronger capability of nickel catalyst for CC and CH bond breaking compared to Fe. The analysis of gas and liquid products over SSI-xNi-UGSO catalysts revealed that at 630 °C and for a Ni content ≥5 %, the liquid phase condensate consists mainly of un-reacted water and an almost complete glycerol conversion to gaseous products were obtained. III Combining XRD and TPR analysis results for investigating the effect of Ni content on samples synthesized by solid-states impregnation method (SSI-xNi-UGSO) indicated the tendency of Ni2+ to first replace Mg2+ in the magnesium-iron mixed oxides (MgxFeyO4) of UGSO to form nickel-iron mixed oxides (NixFeyO4). By increasing the Ni content in the range of 5−15 wt.%, (Nix,Mgy)O mixed oxides can also be formed. The ratios of Ni/Fe and Ni/Mg in these mixed oxides, which are related to the amount of Ni loading, can affect the GSR performance of catalyst especially in terms of coke formation. The best performance was obtained with a catalyst containing 5 wt.% Ni (SSI-5%Ni-UGSO), where nickel-iron mixed oxides with an optimum Ni/Fe ratio (such as NiFe2O4) and Mg-rich nickel-magnesium mixed oxides (such as 3MgO.NiO) were formed. Higher Ni loading resulted in a weaker interaction of Ni with UGSO and probably the formation of (i) (Ni,Mg)O mixed oxides with higher Ni/Mg ratios (e.g., Mg0.4Ni0.6O), which are more susceptible for coke formation, and (ii) nickel-iron mixed oxides with higher Ni/Fe ratios (e.g., Ni1.43Fe1.7O4). IV Comparative studies on Ni-UGSO catalysts prepared by SSI and ultrasound assisted WI methods showed that, for a given amount of Ni loading (5 %), a more intense interaction between Ni and UGSO was attained by using the SSI method, where the matrix of well distributed Mg2+ provided by UGSO could be substituted by Ni2+ through the formation of nickel-iron and nickel-magnesium mixed oxides rather than free NiO. This causes more effective synergetic interactions between Ni and the elements inside UGSO that considerably lowers the coke formation. Moreover, higher glycerol conversion and hydrogen yield were also achieved using SSI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst. On the other hand, XRD, XPS and TPR analysis revealed that by using WI method, Ni did not incorporate into the UGSO structure to a large extent. The only detected Ni containing specious for WI catalyst, is (Ni,Mg)O mixed oxides, where nickel exist preferentially on the surface of MgO. After reduction pre-treatment, the main active site formed on the surface of both catalysts, is Ni particles partly covered with partially reduced iron oxide species (Ni-FexOy). In addition, for WI catalyst, the weaker interaction of Ni with MgO, also resulted in the formation of agglomerated metallic Ni particles that provokes coke formation. In conclusion, Ni-UGSO catalysts with better capability for GSR can be prepared via solvent-free SSI technique that is simpler, more cost effective, and more environmental-friendly comparing with common WI method. This will facilitate execution on industrial scale. V The superior GSR catalytic performance of the optimized SSI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst is not due to a high metallic active phase dispersion but mainly to (i) the synergic effect between Ni and partially reduced iron oxide species on the Ni-FexOy active sites (rather than metallic Ni and/or NiFe alloys) where glycerol is activated on the Ni species and the oxygen atoms are provided to the carbonaceous intermediate from the neighboring FexOy, and (ii) the basic properties of MgO in close contact with Ni, which promotes the dissociation of water into hydroxyl groups and helps to gasify the coke precursors deposited on the catalyst surface. VI The temperature dependency of the reaction network including GSR, WGS, R-WGS, methanation, and Boudouard reaction was also investigated over the optimum developed catalyst (SSI-5%Ni-UGSO) to probe the effect of temperature on the product distribution. For temperatures above 580 °C, almost complete glycerol conversions to gaseous products were obtained over SSI-5%Ni-UGSO catalyst in the selected operating conditions (S/C = 3, FI = 1.1, GHSV = 10,966 cm3 (STP) gcat −1 h−1). The very low amount of coke formed on this catalyst can be almost suppressed via operating at higher temperatures (730 °C) by limiting the Boudouard reaction. However, lower H2/CO and CO2/CO molar ratios as well as higher selectivity to CH4 were the other consequences of high temperature operation. The former is a result of unfavourable condition for WGS reaction at higher temperatures because of its exothermic character, while the latter is probably due to the further reduction of nickel and iron containing specious at elevated temperatures and the formation of Fe° and/or Ni-Fe alloys, which favors the methanation reaction due to the hydrogenating power of iron."
