0,Introduction,"The energy shortage courses serious environmental crisis, which has arouse people’s great concern in exploiting environmental friendly energy sources [1–4]. Hydrogen energy, as one of the cleanest energies in the world, possesses the characteristics of wide availability and high recirculation [5–9]. Hydrogen is an environmental-friendly energy carrier, and its preparation requires a large amount of energy to be consumed while its yields is rather low. As a result, seeking developing a large-scale hydrogen production technology with low cost becomes a common issue among scientists all over the world [10–14]. In 1972 [15], a scientist, Fujishima, first discovered that TiO2 can electrolysis water to hydrogen and oxygen when exposed to ultraviolet light; in 1976 [16], some researchers, including Cary, found that TiO2 under ultraviolet light could break down organic pollutants in water, such as PCBs, all of which draw people’ s more attention into photocatalytic studies. With the further research, it is found that TiO2 materials can only be response to ultraviolet light, which greatly limits its wide application. In recent years, it has been found that C3N4 is a new type of non-metallic photocatalyst response to visible light [17–20]. It has a wide range of synthetic raw materials, e.g. it can be calcined and synthesized from precursors of urea or melamine, high specific surface area and narrow band gap making it is very promising in the field of photocatalysis. In addition, C3N4 molecule with layered structure, due to its π-conjugated electronic structure and sp2-hybridized structure between carbon and nitrogen inside its molecule, makes the material has the characteristics of thermal stability and chemical stability. However, when photocatalysis occurs in C3N4, photo-generated pairs are easy to quickly recombine, which will reduce the photocatalytic efficiency, and limit its further application in the field of photocatalysis. Currently, a series of measures have been taken to modify C3N4, such as metal or non-metallic doping, semiconductor heterojunction, dye sensitization etc [21–31]. Compared with other methods, dye sensitization, as a surface modification technology, can further enhance the utilization efficiency of C3N4 materials to visible light energy, and widen the wavelength range of light absorption. Recently, Domen's team has taken MgPc to dye-sensitize Pt/mpg-C3N4, which enhances absorption performance of C3N4, extends the absorption wavelength to 750 nm, and the quantum efficiency of the material under 660 nm monochromatic light irradiation condition reaches to 0.07 % [32]. Fan’s group synthesized g-C3N4/NixCo1−xS2 photocatalyst which exhibited excellent photocatalytic properties owning to existence of Ni-Co active surface with different active sites and the synergy between Ni and Co inhibits the compounding of electron-cavity pairs [33]. In this paper, we take the advantages of two modification methods, dye sensitization and semiconductor compounding, and on the basis of C3N4, synthesizes a material which can both be applied to photodegradation contaminants and hydrogen production through water photolysis. The synthesis method for CoPc dye is simple, the conjugate 18-π electronic system inside the molecule makes it has good light absorption near infrared region. Under the light, the excited charge in this photosensitizer is transferred from the LUMO energy level to the semiconductor surface, and with the action of oxygen, it can generate a single-line oxygen 1O2 with strong oxidation and can be used to degrade pollutants. The recently discovered ternary sulfur compound SnIn4S8 has the characteristics of direct response to visible light, controllable morphology and high stability. And some researches has been done on the photocatalytic properties of the compound at present. In the recent years, mesoporous g-C3N4 ultrathin nanosheets coupled with QDs self-decorated SnIn4S8 composite and hierarchical network-like g-C3N4/SnIn4S8 have been reported. They exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance compared with pure catalytic that provide the basis for this paper. [34,35] In this paper, CoPc@SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 ternary composite materials were prepared by low temperature co-precipitation and ultrasonic impregnation, such two-step methods. The mutual synergistic reaction among the three kinds of materials and the unique light absorption performance of CoPc near infrared region make the concept can be realized, i.e. the ternary composite products can not only photodegradate pollutants, but also produce hydrogen through water photolysis. The proposal mechanism and enhanced photocatalytic performance were discussed systematically below."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample synthesis,"2.1 Sample synthesis All reagents employed in the paper were obtained from the Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, which were of analytical grade and without further purification. 2 g of melamine and 7 g of ammonium chloride were placed into a 100 mL beaker, kept stirring for 8 h to form a homogeneous mixture. Then transferred into 100 mL of alumina crucible, the dried white melamine powder was further reacted in the muffle furnace, retaining 550 °C around 4 h. After being cooled down, the g-C3N4 was obtained. The SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites were prepared via the low temperature co-precipitation mean as previous literature. Disperse a certain amount of carbon nitride in the ethanol with a clean beaker and then 0.6 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O and 2.4 mmol of InCl3·4H2O were added on the condition of stirring to form the homogeneous liquid. 0.47 g of thioacetamide (TAA) was dissolved in the above alcohol solution, being acted as sulfur source. The solution was then transferred into the round-bottomed flask, being heated at 80 °C for approximate 12 h. Finally, washed and dried to gain SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites. The procedure of bare SnIn4S8 was the same with SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites. The CoPc/SnIn4S8 and CoPc/g-C3N4 composites were synthesized as below. 50 mg of SnIn4S8 or g-C3N4 was kept stiring for 30 min in the ethanol to obtain the homogeneous mixture. CoPc was dissolved in the DMF solvent (0.17 mM). Then, 5 mL of CoPc was added into the SnIn4S8 or g-C3N4 mixture, being stirred for 24 h. The obtained CoPc/SnIn4S8 and CoPc/g-C3N4 products were further centrifuged and dried at 70 °C. CoPc (structure is shown in Fig. 1 ) sensitized SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 sample was synthesized by an ultrasonic impregnation method. At first, a certain amount of SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 was dispersed in the ethanol, kept stirring for 30 min. CoPc was dissolved in the DMF solvent (0.17 mM). Then, it was added into the SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 solution along with and stirred for 24 h. The obtained CoPc@SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 products were further centrifuged and finally dried at 70 °C."
3,Sample characterization,"2.2 Sample characterization The morphological state of as-prepared catalysts was performed on the scanning electron microscope made in German (SUPRA-55, SEM) and the transmission electron microscope (JEOL-2100, TEM, Japan). Fourier transform infrared spectra (IS50, FT-IR, America) was carried out to analyse the structure of molecule. The XRD detection had been characterized by an equipment (D/Max-2500PC, Japan). The Ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (DRS) were employed under the condition of the wavelength ranging from 800 nm to 200 nm (Shimadzu UV-2550). Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evlution, Japan). Moreover, the thermal stability of catalysts was evaluated by employing thermogravimetry and differential thermogravimetry (Labsys Evo/seteram, TG-DTG France). The PL spectrum was conducted by fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse, China). The TOC test was calculated through the Multi N/C 2100. The XPS spectra were measured by ESCALAB 250 XI."
4,Evaluation of photocatalytic activities,"2.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activities Catalytic activities of both CoPc-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites had been measured on a condition of malachite green (MG) solution (35 mg/L, 50 ml) mixed with 25 mg of as-prepared samples. The photocatalytic properties were measured under the Xe lamp irradiation which was 1000 W, simulating the visible-light absorption. The total irradiance with filter was calculated to be 353.67 W m−2 nm−1. After being stirred for 30 min without light irradiation, the mixture obtain the adsorption-desorption equilibrium, followed with 3 mL upper serum taken at the regular interval. And then the consequences of processed solution were all carried out to attain the curve of absorbance by the UV1800PC spectrometer (Shanghai AuCy Instrument). The degradation rate of MG solution would later be gauged via formula: D = (1 − Ct/C0) × 100 %, where Ct and C0 are assigned to the concentration of the malachite green later and prior to the photo-degradation experiment."
5,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production The researches of H2 evolution were conducted in the sealed cylindrical reactor which being equipped with a round transparent shield, under a 300-W Xe lamp (model: PLS-SXE300/300UV) irradiation. During the process of experiment, 10.0 mg of the samples we prepared by the above method were then added into 100 mL aqueous solution with 15 mL triethanolamine by ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, the mixture was irradiated under the 500 W Xe lamp (λ ≥ 430 nm) and the total irradiance with filter was calculated to be 176.83 W m−2 nm−1. The amount of H2 was detected by online TCD, the thermal conductivity detector gas chromatography, under the Ar2 atmosphere at the 30 min interval (GC 7900 Techcomp) or drainage."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 2 indicates the XRD spectrum of obtained photocatalytics are shown in Fig. 2. The typical diffraction peaks can be observed at 27.5° (d = 3.28 Å) and 13.1° (d = 6.78 Å) which were assigned to (002) interlayer-stacking and (100) in-planar structure for g-C3N4 (Fig. 2a). The porous SnIn4S8 possessed the tetragonal symmetry structure with diffraction peaks at two theta of 9.4°, 18.5°, 28.4°, 33.1°, 47.6° and 50.0° which are indexed in (200), (202), (600), (602), (174) and (001) reflections, respectively. Moreover, the different mass ratio of SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 samples revealed similar XRD patterns due to the weaker diffraction signals from SnIn4S8. It is proposed that the preparation of SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 samples inhibit the flower-like morphology synthesis (Fig. 2b) while it retains the strip growing which would be discussed in detail below. Besides, CoPc sensitized SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites display no clear diffraction peaks at two theta of 7.0° due to its low concentration around 2.9‰∼23.4‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C (x‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C means x‰CoPc, mass ratio, sensitizing each equivalent of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites). The intact diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 represent that the incorporation of SnIn4S8 and CoPc takes no influence on its crystalline structure. Fig. 3 presents the SEM images of bare CoPc, g-C3N4, SnIn4S8 and CoPc sensitized SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites. The CoPc dye takes on the strip-like morphology (Fig. 3a) while the pure SnIn4S8 looks like a marigold flower (Fig. 3c). What’s more, the SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites were synthesized under the flaky carbon nitride atmosphere, so the composites are stacked into a larger volume of spherical shape, not the same as flowers. It is clearly showed that thicker layers are consisted of both C3N4 and SnIn4S8 (Fig. 3d). To further verify such conclusion, the TEM analysis was carried out. The result is shown in Fig. 4 . It was found that the carbon nitride exhibits the distinct lamellar structure (Fig. 4a) while pure SnIn4S8 should be marigold-like (Fig. 4b) which is in accordance with the results of SEM. The CoPc sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites displays strips of SnIn4S8 adhere to the surface of g-C3N4 photocatalyst (Fig. 4c). The HRTEM image (Fig. 4d) demonstrates the existence of SnIn4S8 that possessed spacing of the lattice fringes about 0.263 nm coinciding with the previous literature. The EDS analysis were carried out in Fig. 4e, where almost all elements except those from CoPc are on display due to its low concentration of 0.17 mM. The FT-IR results of bare SnIn4S8, g-C3N4, CoPc, SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and CoPc@SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 catalysts are exhibited in Fig. 5 . As to g-C3N4 samples, the characteristic vibration peaks in the region of 1200−1600 cm−1 are on behalf of VC-N of heterocycles. The band at 818 cm−1 is regarded as breathing modes of triazine units [36]. What’s more, the peaks at 749, 1109, 1388 and 1591 cm-1 were recognized as characteristic peaks of CoPc. Especially, the bands located at 1388 and 1591 cm−1 represent stretching vibration of CC and CN, respectively. In the case of all samples, the peaks at 3200–3500 cm−1 could be assigned to adsorption of H2O molecules while concerning CoPc and CoPc-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 samples which are possible to be NH vibration. Both the single sample like g-C3N4 and as-prepared composites display the characteristic peaks for us indicating the successful coexistence in the as-prepared samples. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TG analysis) is accomplished to measure the thermal status and composition of materials, including pure g-C3N4, SnIn4S8, CoPc, 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composites (Fig. R1). It is clearly demonstrate that step pyrolysis of SnIn4S8 at 200 ℃ could be assigned to the elimination of SnS [37] and pyrolysis ranges approximately from approximately 700 ℃ to 800 ℃ representing decomposition the of In2S3 [38]. What’s more, the slight loss at 580 ℃ is supposed to elimination of excess sulfur atoms. When concerned to g-C3N4, it can be seen clearly that the primary region of weight loss ranges from 500 °C till 750 °C. After being heated up to 800 °C, all of the g-C3N4 was nearly broken down. The dramatic weight loss of CoPc dye among the range from 400 to 800 ℃ is contributed from the elimination of aromatic backbone in Pc ring [39–41]. As for 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 sample, and 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composites, their total weight loss was around 75 %, lower than that of laminar g-C3N4. The weight loss at 580 ℃ and hysteresis curve of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 implied the existence of SnIn4S8 constituent. Moreover, 20 % residuum after 750 ℃ were indium atoms and tin atoms, which was same with the 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composites. As to 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4, we calculated the actual weight ratio of SnIn4S8 verse the total composite via the equation below: (1) W = RM 2/M 1 R represents the residuum of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4; M1 is the relative molecular mass of SnIn4S8; M2 means the relative molecular mass of Sn and In atoms. The estimated value was 0.2877, approaching to the original feeding.The last but not least, 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composites brings out the subtle delayed decomposition of CoPc at nearly 780 ℃ due to its trace doping, verifying the existence of CoPc dye. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption curve of SnIn4S8, g-C3N4, 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and 11.6‰CoPc-25/Sn-C is displayed in Fig. 6 a. It can be seen clearly that all catalysts display a typical type IV isothermal and H3-type hysteresis loop, representing that the as-prepared catalysts exhibit a mesoporous structure. Fig. 6b shows that, after being loaded with carbon nitride, the overall catalyst exhibits the pore size distribution of the carrier. The main pore size is concentrated at about 3 nm, which means the carbon nitride is evenly distributed on the SnIn4S8 and obtain a relative well dispersion. As a result, it’s meaningful for the catalyst to expose more active sites and improve the catalytic performance. At the same time, what shown in Table 1 proved that the introduction of carbon nitride can successfully increase the specific surface area, empty volume and pore diameter of the catalyst. What’s more, it significantly solves the disadvantages of catalyst agglomeration and the whole catalyst has more active sites, which is conducive to the reaction. The surface chemical composition and state of samples were investigated by XPS, revealing electron density’s migration [42]. The apparent photo-electron peaks of Sn, In, C, S and N elements are clearly examined (wide-scan XPS spectrum) from the exterior of CoPc@ SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 sample (Fig. 7 a). There are two evident signals (in Fig. 7b) for g-C3N4 at 288.15 eV corresponding to the graphite-like sp3C-C and 284.7 eV ascribed to N-sp2C (NCN) [43]. The curves about N 1s (Fig. 7c) comprises three peaks at 398.6 eV, 399.35 eV and 400.7 eV being attributed to sp2-hybridized nitrogen (CNC), sp3 CN and C N H bonds appeared in the g-C3N4 sample [44], respectively. Two analogical peaks at 494.6 eV and 486.2 eV are found in the Sn 3d spectrum for CoPc-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 7d), shifting towards the lower binding energy by 0.3 eV contrast to that for bare SnIn4S8, which confirmed Sn element mainly takes on the form of Sn4+ chemical state [45]. Fig. 6e exhibits the S 2p spectrum for SnIn4S8 which has two peaks at 161.40 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.55 eV (S 2p1/2) [46]. Meanwhile, the similar peaks at 161.1 eV and 162.25 eV of S 2p spectrum for CoPc-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 are found to shift to lower energy by 0.30 eV, indicating that the electrons tend to flow from g-C3N4 to SnIn4S8. The In 3d spectrum for bare SnIn4S8 in Fig. 6f displays two major peaks assigning to In 3d3/2 (444.85 eV) and In 3d5/2 (452.45 eV) of In(III) in SnIn4S8 [47]. Furthermore, the XPS analysis of Sn 3d, S 2p and In 3d spectra for 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 were displayed in Fig. 7d, e and f respectively. It can be found that the corresponding peaks of Sn 3d for 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 at 494.85 eV and 486.40 eV, which shift to lower energy by 0.05 eV or 0.1 eV as compared with pure SnIn4S8 composite. While they were 0.15 eV and 0.2 eV higher than CoPc-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 sample. Similarly, the results of S 2p and In 3d coincide with Sn 3d. Therefore, an internal electric field between SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4 is in the form of the redistribution of free electrons, transferring from g-C3N4 till SnIn4S8. What is worth mentioning that the CoPc dye sensitized SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 nanocomposites exhibit the lowest binding energy that means free electrons arising from CoPc finally concentrating on the SnIn4S8 rather than transferring from SnIn4S8 to CoPc. The property of photo-absorption and sample’s recombination rate of carriers have been analyzed by DRS and PL tests. We gauge the optical properties and band gaps of as-prepared composites by employing UV-2700 diffuse reflection spectroscopy. Fig. 8 displays the detection curves of bare g-C3N4, SnIn4S8, CoPc dye, SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 hybrids and CoPc@SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites. In Fig. 8a, the pure g-C3N4 showed light absorption wavelength edge at around 420 nm while the bare SnIn4S8 displays edge at 600 nm, the latter exhibiting the wider absorption band range. When doping with SnIn4S8 semiconductor, the composites takes on a slight red-shift implying the higher light utilization efficiency than pure g-C3N4. Apparently, metal phthalocyanine has two ultraviolet characteristic peaks, B band and Q band resulted from the π-π* transition of phthalocyanine molecular ligands and external anthracene rings, correspondingly. In Fig. 8b, after being sensitized by CoPc, the maximal red/near-IR absorption at approximately 680 nm exists for the unique conjugated system of CoPc. Generally, the distinct red-shift of Q band (red/near-IR absorption) is attributed to the enlargement of the conjugated structure of CoPc dye which eventually contributes to the stronger light absorption. Therefore, it can be concluded that the CoPc dye sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites possess the better property of light utilization. Furthermore, the peak of dye sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 hybrids at 610 nm display the lower intensity, resulted from the decrease of phthalocyanine dimer. The last but not least, the SnIn4S8 sample is in possession of the band gap about 1.81 eV while the bare g-C3N4 is gauged to be 2.66 eV (Fig. 8c) according to the follow equations. (1) K/S=(1-R∞) 2 /(2R∞)=F(R∞) (2) [F(R∞)hv] 1/2 =A 2 (hv-Eg) (3) Eg=1240/λ A means Planck’s constant, hv represents the photon energy, λ and F(R∞) represent wavelength and Kubelka-Munk respectively. It can be concluded that the synergetic effect between dye and composites promote the visible-light utilization and then enhance the photocatalytical activity. It’s well known that the PL intensity is on behalf of the recombination of photo-generated carries. In detail, under the conditions of illumination, the striking energy contributes to some electronics transferring from the low energy orbit to the higher one, that is, from the original state to the first or the second excited state. The principle of minimum energy makes the excited atoms restored to the ground state, accompanying with the released energy which would be recognized as the fluorescence. Fig. 9 shows the PL spectra of bare SnIn4S8, g-C3N4, CoPc, 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C (0.5844 mg CoPc sensitized 50 mg of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composite, mass ratio) under the excitation wavelength of about 360 nm. It was found that all as-prepared composites revealed the identical emission regions where the uppermost peak is at 451 nm assigned to n-π* electron migration [48]. Meanwhile, the energy of such peak could be equal to the value of pure laminar carbon nitride (2.7 eV) in relation to the equation: Eg = 1240/λ. There is no doubt that the g-C3N4 has the strongest PL intensity compared with other samples. Among them, SnIn4S8 and CoPc reached to nearly zero for no PL irradiation at such wavelength. What can be noticed clearly is that PL quenching emerges in the 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C samples, demonstrating the existence of the improved electronic transfer property and lower recombination of photo-generated pairs. Hence, it could be proposed that the 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composites possess the highest photocatalytic performance, indicating the successful dye sensitization between CoPc and 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites. The electrochemical analysis of bare SnIn4S8, g-C3N4, 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C film photo-electrodes are recorded in Fig. 10 where the samples are irradiated intermittently with switch light experiments under the 300 W Xe lump for 6 times lasting 360 s. Among them, the 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composite exhibits the outstanding photocurrent activity, 1.5 times as high as the value of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4. Furthermore, 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 sample displays better photocurrent performance than the one of pure SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4, which could be assigned to quicker electron transfer rate and more efficient separation between photo-generated carriers [49,50]. Fig. 11 a displays the hydrogen evolution activity curve of SnIn4S8, CoPc/SnIn4S8, CoPc/g-C3N4, different mass ratio of SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 (Content were 0 %, 5 %, 15 %, 25 %, 30 %) composites and CoPc sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 hybrids. The triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution was used as sacrificial electron donors [51]. It can be seen clearly that the H2 evolution of bare SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4 samples are nearly zero, while 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composite possesses higher H2 evolution value around 470.85 μmol g−1 h−1. Furthermore, 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C takes on the maximum value 636.99 μmol g−1 h−1 which is 1.35 times as high as the value of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4, manifesting its restrained influence on the recombination between photo-generated pairs. The value about different mass ratio of CoPc (2.9‰, 5.8‰, 17.5‰, 23.4‰) sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composite are 385.59, 491.13, 537.71 and 486.93 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. 11b). The 0.5844 mg CoPc sensitized 50 mg of SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4 composites (11.6‰ CoPc/SnIn4S8 and 11.6‰ CoPc/g-C3N4, mass ratio) were synthesized to test the photocatalytic performance around the contrast experiment. The hydrogen evolution value of 11.6‰ CoPc/SnIn4S8 and 11.6‰ CoPc/g-C3N4 were 7.346 μmol g−1 h−1 and 55.8 μmol g−1 h−1, far less than different mass ratio of SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites or dye sensitized ternary system. It could be concluded that not only the synergistic effect during SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4 sample, but also the dye’s sensitization interaction took the vital influence on the photocatalytic activities. Fig. 11c shows the amount of hydrogen production per half hour, where the 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composites are in possession of the fastest growth rate accompanying with linear rise state. It is surprisingly that the 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composites remained 400.78 μmol g−1 h−1 hydrogen production after being carried out for four cycles experiment which represented excellent stability of photocatalyst (Fig.11d). The photocatalytic activities and the optimized ratio of SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 and CoPc-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites are evaluated by the mean of degrading the malachite green (MG), and the consequences have been all displayed in Fig. 12 . We take the absorbance value (617 nm) to calculate the degradation rate in concern of SnIn4S8 and as-prepared samples (Fig. 12a and c). By contrast, the 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites exhibited the well photocatalytic activity whose degradation rate approached to 72 % under 140 min visible-light illumination. Meanwhile, 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composite possessed the highest degradation rate of 86 % when it was irradiated for 100 min, which was 1.19 times as high as the degradation rate of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 sample at the same condition. In addition, the different mass ratio of CoPc sensitizing 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites hold the improved degradation performance, suggesting that CoPc dye could enhance the capacity of electron transfer. The results of kinetic data are displayed in Figs. 11b and 12 d. It can be found that the kinetics of composites abide by the pseudo-first-order guidance which is ascribed to quite low concentration of malachite green aqueous. As for SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 samples, the 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composite takes on the higher kapp value of 0.00801 min−1, 5.68 times larger than the value of pure SnIn4S8. What’s more, 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composite possessed highest kapp value of around 0.02086 min−1, 2.67 times as high as that of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites. It can be concluded that not only the incorporation of SnIn4S8 strengthen the utilization of solar energy but also the CoPc dye accelerate the rate of electron migration. Furthermore, the total organic carbon (TOC) test has been used for detecting the remaining organic after the photocatalytic degradation (Fig. 14a). Obviously, the eventual values of CoPc sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composite own more lower numerical value than that of original MG. Especially, the 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C takes on the lowest results of all samples whose value approaches to zero implying the MG has been broken down into inorganic molecules like CO2 or H2O. For the purpose of verifying the stability of catalyst material, FT-IR, XRD and TEM analyses were carried out, shown in Fig. 13 . it can be seen that the characteristic peaks of 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composite after photocatalytic reactions were the same with that before experiment. It’s no doubt that the bands located at 1388 and 1591 cm−1 which represented stretching vibration of CC and CN respectively, were seen clearly in Fig. 13b. What’s more, the similar morphology verify the stability of CoPc dye sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composite. For the sake of further studying the application mechanism of photocatalysis concerning 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C composite, active specie research is conducted to investigate potential roles of OH, O2 − and h+ which are well-known as three different active species under the photo-degradation detection. In the previous literature, three main scavengers, such as IPA, BQ and MeOH, are brought in the process of MG degradation so as to trap OH, O2 − and h+ [52,53]. Just as seen in Fig. 14b, the introduction of MeOH dramatically decreased the 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C sample’s degradation rate of MG, suggesting the h+ should be the uppermost active specie during the photo-oxidation process. Meanwhile, the addition of BQ could partially inhibit the degradation rate, indicating the O2 − could play as an important contributor as well (Fig. 14c). While the introduction of IPA would nearly has no change in the degradation rate. Therefore, it can be thought that the OH takes no effect on the process of photo-degradation. In Fig. 14d, it can be found that the detected VB values of SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4 were 1.84 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively. HOMO of CoPc was 1.08 eV (Fig. 13d), obtained by valence-band XPS detection. Fig. 15 displays the schematic diagram of energy level about SnIn4S8, g-C3N4 and CoPc. According to the results of VB-XPS and DRS analysis, the VB and CB values of SnIn4S8 are 1.84 eV and −0.41 eV correspondingly [54], 1.31 eV and −1.41 eV of g-C3N4 [55] while the band gap of CoPc was 1.8 eV according to the previous reference [56]. On the basis of the results referred to above, the potential photocatalytic mechanism is presented in Fig. 16 . It can be seen clearly that the photo-generated electrons of photocatalytics, such as SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4, simultaneously transfer from the VB band to the CB band so the holes are left on the VB band. In addition, the CoPc dye changes from the original state to the higher level state when exposed to the visible-light irradiation. On the one hand, the LUMO of CoPc is higher than CB value of g-C3N4 and lower than that of SnIn4S8 sample as well as the CB value of SnIn4S8 less positive than E0 (O2/ O2 −) (−0.046 eV vs NHE), resulting in the electronic carriers inject into the SnIn4S8 surface eventually so that the photo-generated pairs could be separated effectively. Furthermore, when the e− come into contact with oxygen in the air, it turns to O2 − which could break MG down into degradation product like CO2 and H2O. On the other hand, the HOMO of CoPc is lower than the VB values of SnIn4S8 and g-C3N4 bringing out the photo-generated holes being gathered at CoPc taking on the same effect like O2 − on MG virtually. On account of the E0 ( OH/OH−) (2.38 eV vs NHE) is higher than any value of VB or HOMO of samples, there is no OH active specie to be generated that further verify the results of active specie research. What’s more, the mechanism of hydrogen production has been proposed where the transmission path of the photo-electron is described as above. Then the H+ coming from deionized solution combines with the electrons to generate hydrogen while the holes would be trapped by TEOA which could be oxidized after reacting with photo-generated holes so it’s beneficial to the separation of photo-generated pairs. To conclude, the sensitized 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composite could be identified as the electronic transporter and receiver, so that the photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen evolution have been significantly enhanced."
7,Conclusion,"To sum up, a series of SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 hybrids had been synthesized through a low temperature co-precipitation method, and CoPc dye sensitized SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites (CoPc-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4) were obtained by an ultrasonic impregnation method. The 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites possess higher H2 evolution value around 470.85 μmol g−1 h−1. The 11.6‰ CoPc-25/Sn-C has the maximum value 636.99 μmol g−1 h−1 which is 1.35 times as high as the value of 25 %-SnIn4S8/g-C3N4, manifesting the restrained influence on the reunite of photo-excited carriers. The existence of CoPc dye has been verified according to the FT-IR and XPS analysis. What’s more, the dye sensitized SnIn4S8/g-C3N4 composites display the quite well photo-degradation property and increased hydrogen production owing to the higher molecular delocalization and quicker charge-transfer capacity."
