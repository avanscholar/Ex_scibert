0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels depletion and rising concerns on the global warming issue resulted from fossil fuel burning necessitate the development and utilization of sustainable alternative energy resources. Among the renewable fuels investigated, hydrogen (H2) is likely of utmost importance as a versatile energy vector due to its highest energy content per weight (120 MJ/kg) and environmental benignness [1]. Today, H2 is widely used in the food, electronics, refinery, food, electronics, metallurgical-processing industries, etc. [2]. The application of H2 in internal combustion engines and fuel cells also gained substantial significance, credited to its clean emission (no carbon dioxide, CO2 is emitted) [3]. As shown in Fig. 1 , most of the H2 is generated from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas), with approximately 50% of H2 production coming from the steam reforming (SR) of natural gas and other light hydrocarbons [4]. Meanwhile, water electrolysis, which is considered as a promising technology for future H2 production, still suffers from high electricity cost for enhancing H2 yield [5]. For biochemical H2 production, it is still in the development stage due to its high production cost and low efficiency [6]. Thus, a higher attention was given to SR process as an efficient method for H2 production, credited to its high efficiency for H2 production and low environmental problems. Well-established SR has been practiced since 1930 for H2 production [7], where this endothermic reaction takes place when the feedstocks are treated with steam in the presence of catalyst to produce CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and H2 at an elevated temperature above 700 °C. SR is also favorable for liquid biomass to minimize extra cost needed to supply external steam [8]. The feedstocks for SR process are mostly non-renewable hydrocarbon such as natural gas, propane, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas [10]. However, due to the depletion issue of natural fossil fuel reserves and the high dependency of human life to energy, several attempts have been made by researchers to adopt alternative feedstocks over fossil fuels for SR processes [11]. Biomass energy has been regarded as the true surrogate for fossil fuels in energy generation since it facilitates the energy exploitation without encountering climatic, seasonal, and regional constraints. Biomass which can be divided into virgin biomass and biomass-derived waste, can be known as an inexhaustible carbon source as its organic components are derived from plants or animals [8]. Biomass energy possesses advantages such as carbon neutral energy, and lower cost than natural gas, as well as produces low quantity of air pollutants [12]. Therefore, intense efforts have been devoted in evaluating the potential of various liquid biomass and biomass-derived oxygenates for SR process. The main requirements for SR technology’s feedstocks are that they should have a large number of organic molecules and a minimal amount of heavy metals. To date, the liquid biomass feedstocks for SR technology can be classified into industrial effluents, biomass-derived solvents and lipids. The water and land pollutions caused by the direct discharge of these wastes cannot be underestimated and thus the transformation of these low-cost wastes into clean H2 via SR technology is corresponding to the market requirements by replacing a portion of fossil fuels. The utilizations of these biomass-derived feedstocks can make full advantage of their high-water content to produce H2-rich syngas. The stoichiometry of SR reaction for any oxygenated organic compounds can be expressed as Eq. (1). The major obstacle for SR is the catalyst deactivation resulted by coke deposition (C + H2O ↔ CO + H2), thus excess steam is introduced to minimize coke deposition. (1) C n H m O k + (n-k) H2O → nCO + (n + – k) H2 This reaction is regarded as water–gas shift reaction. (WGSR) (Eq. (2)). (2) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 At low temperature, CO methanation takes place whereby a part of the H2 produced reacts with the unreacted CO to yield CH4 (Eq. (3)). (3) CO + 3H2 ↔ CH4 + H2O Eqs. (1) and (2) can be combined to form a global equation as follows: (4) C n H m O k + (2n-k) H2O → nCO2 + (2n-k + ) H2 Over the years, there are a number of review papers reported on steam reforming technology in which majority of the papers focused on single feedstocks only such as methane, [13,14], biomass pyrolysis oil/bio-oil/tar [8,15–17], ethanol [18], methanol [19], butanol [20], glycerol [21,22], etc. They have been ranged from the discussion of catalysis, novel process design, process optimization, operating conditions analysis, thermodynamic analysis, techno-economic analysis, lifecycle analysis, sorption enhancement, carbon deposition behaviour, comparison with other reforming technologies, etc. To date, there is almost no review paper in cumulating and reviewing the state-of-the-art of H2 production from SR over previously reported liquid wastes and biomass-derived oxygenates. In view of this matter, the current states of knowledge on the SR of the liquid wastes and biomass-derived oxygenates are herein summarized, together with their challenges faced and catalogue progress made in recent years. The completion of this review paper can serve as reference material for future improvements and advancements in bio-H2 production using SR technology."
1,Biomass feedstocks for steam reforming reaction,
2,Industrial effluents,"2.1 Industrial effluents In the past, most of the cheese, palm oil, and olive oil factories either discharged their effluents into lakes, rivers, and/or ocean or onto land in the absence of any pretreatments. Regrettably, the direct discharge of these high COD and BOD values wastewaters to the environment contributes to a severe water pollution issue. These wastewater effluents should be treated and utilized properly to avoid posing a health concern to users of surface water resources and the aquatic ecosystem, as well as produce useful products from these pollutants. With regards to the matter, the SR technology was implemented by researchers on these wastewater sources, credited to its high capability in transforming their rich organic content into highly valuable clean H2. Apart from yielding green H2 energy, the treated wastewaters obtained after the SR processes are carbon-free liquids, which can be safely discharge into the environment at proper levels. The main constraint for SR over these high-water content wastewaters is the less practicability of the process, where high energy is required to evaporate the high-water content in wastewaters and less H2 production. Table 1 below summarizes the general characteristics of cheese whey, olive mill and palm oil mill wastewaters. 2.1.1 Cheese whey wastewater Yellowish colour cheese whey wastewater (CWW) obtained by the coprecipitation of milk casein is the main by-product produced during the cheese-making process. Generally, 9 kg of cheese whey is produced from 10 kg of milk used upon the production of 1 kg of cheese, which is corresponding to 5 million tons of whey produced yearly worldwide [28]. The cheese whey is typically made up of 93–94 wt% of water, 0.8–1 wt% minerals, 4.5–6 wt% lactose, 0.05–0.9 wt% lactic acid, 0.6–1.1 wt% proteins, and 0.06–0.5 wt% fats [25,29,30]. This high organic content of cheese whey has BOD and COD values of approximately 600–60,000 g/L and 800–102000 g/L, respectively [31]. In this regard, the conventional cheese whey management can be classified into physicochemical treatments, filtration technologies, and biological treatments. To date, the SR of CWW was only performed by Remón et al. [28,31] by using Ni-based catalysts and lactose as a model compound, where almost carbon-free liquid streams were obtained as the organic components found in the cheese whey had been successfully converted into a H2-rich gas (H2 concentration: 70 vol%, CO2 concentration: 20 vol%, and others: CO and CH4). Besides, they also found that carbon-free liquid streams with complete lactose conversion were obtained regardless of the variation of the reaction temperature from 300 to 600 °C; the significant differences were detected on the composition of the gaseous products. In summary, the SR process of CWW can accomplish H2-rich gas with H2 yield of 16 mol H2/mol lactose [28]. 2.1.2 Olive mill wastewater Olive mill wastewater (OMW) which is a by-product from olive oil milling is mostly concentrated in Mediterranean regions [32]. The composition of OMW is highly contingent on the region of cultivation, the weather conditions during the ripening process of olive, the method of extracting the oil, and the maturation period of the olive [33]. Owing to the presence of long-chain fatty acids, lipids, sugars, and antibacterial phenolic compounds, traditional OMW treatment methods such as aerobic and anaerobic degradation are ineffective [32,34]. This statement can be explained by the high possibility for the lifetime of the bacteria being affected, subsequently resulted in activity deterioration. The high COD and BOD values of OMW were reported to exhibit negative impacts on soil and air quality and resulted in the occurrence of phytotoxicity in the water systems due to the deposition of toxic effluents [9,35,36]. Even though the sludge obtained upon OMW disposal in artificial ponds can be utilized as fertilizer, the resulting soil phytotoxicity and acidification are undesirable for agricultural purposes [37]. Previous studies on steam reforming of OMW [34,37,38] indicated positive impacts of OMW-SR on the suppression of C2-C3 hydrocarbons and methane (CH4). H2 production from SR of OMW has been reported by Casanovas et al. [37], Tosti et al. [32], and Rocha et al. [38]. Casanovas et al. [37] investigated the feasibility of noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru) or Ni over La/CeO2 for OMW-SR under different temperatures (600–800 °C) and space velocities (4500–16,000 h−1). The best performance was demonstrated by Pt-La/CeO2 at 700 °C and 16,000 h−1 with 40 mL of H2/mL of OMW as feedstock. 90–96% reduction of organic carbon from OMW was achieved. Tosti et al. [32] combined the OMW-SR with CH4 in a membrane reformer and high H2 yield (45 g/100 g of TOC fed) was achieved, corresponded to 2.3 kg H2/ton of OMW. Rocha et al. [38] performed thermodynamic analysis for different reactor configurations. Sorption-enhanced membrane reactor (SEMR) was shown to be better than traditional and membrane reactors, with an H2 yield of 13.54% (≈ stoichiometric value) was obtained at 1 bar, water content in the feed of around 60–92 wt%, and 500 °C. Another thermodynamic analysis of [34] was performed to investigate the effects of several variables for the OMW-SR process such as operating temperature, weight content of water in the feed, initial OMW composition, and pressure. The major finding of the analysis was higher H2 yield was achieved at higher water content in the feed and higher reaction temperature. Meanwhile, the coke formation increased with a decrease in the reaction temperature and water content in the feed, while the coke deposition was suppressed when the water content in the feed > 60 wt%. 2.1.3 Palm oil mill effluent The palm oil production has been escalated from 1.86 million tons in 1991 to nearly 64 million tons in 2016, in which Southeast Asia countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand) enjoy flourishing development [39]. Approximately 5.0–7.5 tons of water is needed to produce 1.0 ton of crude palm oil and subsequently 50% of the water is produced as POME wastewater [40]. The dark brownish POME demonstrates BOD of 10,000 – 44,000 mg/L and COD of 15,000 – 100,000 mg/L [41]. To date, >90% of the palm oil mills adopted open ponding to treat hazardous POME; however, this technology requires 66 days of operating process [41] and even emits unpleasant smell and causes greenhouse gases emissions [42]. Owing to the detrimental impacts of the biogas (CH4, and CO2) emitted to the ozone layer and the ability of POME to be recovered as useful biomass-based energy, the production of biogas through biological and chemical methods have been extensively explored and studied [39,43,44]. Indeed, the organic-rich POME waste is also highly potential for SR process to produce clean H2 and this idea was initiated by Ng et al. [45] by using Ni/Al2O3 as the catalyst. The study reported around 93% of COD and BOD removal with H2 selectivity of 51.44% at 600 °C. Cheng et al. [46,47] also attempted the POME-SR by using perovskite catalysts (LaNiO3 and LaCoO3), where they found that net-basic LaCoO3 was less performed as compared to net-acidic LaNiO3 due to the presence of high amount of Lewis base H2O in POME. At optimum process conditions (T = 600 °C, V ̇ POME = 0.09 mL/min, Wcat = 0.3 g, and dcat = 74–105 mm), 86.60 μmol/min and 132.47 μmol/min of H2-rich syngas were yielded for LaCoO3 and LaNiO3, respectively. In parallel with the H2-rich syngas yielded, the COD, BOD, and TSS removals were > 98%. Fig. 2 shows the graphical illustrations of POME-SR over LaNiO3 and LaCoO3 as proposed by Cheng et al. [46,47]. From Fig. 2A, it is illustrated that the reduction of LaNiO3 catalyst by H2 into Ni metal and La2O3 support at 1023 K, followed by carbonatation of La2O3 with CO2 into La2O2CO3 at 773 K, which explains the change of LaNiO3 into La2O2CO3. By generating an intermediate La2O2O3 phase, the La2O3 of reduced LaCoO3 facilitated the reverse Boudouard reaction by stepwise carbonation-decarbonation (Fig. 2B). They also executed thermodynamic analysis on this process, where they concluded that the almost the complete removal of organic components in POME was not solely due to the conversion into syngas, but partly via the thermal decomposition of POME at operating temperature of ≤ 400 °C [48]. At the optimum temperature of 500 °C, H2 yield was around 55,683 mmol H2/mol POME. Table 2 summarizes the previous reported SR reactions of industrial effluents over various kind of catalyst."
3,Solvents and biomass-derived solvents,"2.2 Solvents and biomass-derived solvents From the thermal degradation of the hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin contents in biomass, a complex product that composed of various oxygenates called bio-oil is produced [51]. Bio-oil is a complicated mixture of low and high molecular weight oxygenated compounds, such as aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids, and anhydrosugars [52]. In general, bio-oils exhibits a wide range of applications such as the production of heat, electricity, chemicals production (oxygenates, organic acids, and phenols), transportation fuel, etc [16]. However, expensive and complicated upgrading processes are needed before the usage of low heating value, incomplete volatility and acidity bio-oil for the above-mentioned applications [15]. To address this challenge, SR of bio-oil has been initiated to generate H2 as another feasible future fuel. However, the SR of pure bio-oil is hardly to be discussed due to the wide ranges of components present, significant amount of coke formation and its complex reaction network [53]. Frequently, most of the researchers had modelled the complex bio-oil as a single oxygenated compound for simplicity [54]. Presently, the model compounds of bio-oil that has been proposed for SR are inclusive of acetic acid, acetone, ethanol, ethylene, ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol, kerosene, phenol, toluene, methanol, propane, glucose, etc. There are some researchers also attempted in performing SR by using the pure solvents directly, which were crucial in making comparing with the biomass-derived solvents. To ease the comparison and understanding, the SR of model compounds from bio-oil (biomass-derived solvents) and pure solvents will be discussed together in this section. The catalytic activity of solvents-SR is affected by the operating parameters such as types of catalytic supports, metals used, space hourly space velocity (GHSV), reaction temperature, steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio, pressure, etc. The possible sides reactions occurred includes cracking, methanation, dehydration, dehydrogenation, and WGSR. 2.2.1 Acetone Acetone is a low-cost byproduct of phenol production via cumene peroxidation route, where equimolar of acetone is produced for each mole of phenol formed [55]. It is also an important compound in fermentation-derived butanol as well as intermediate during reforming of acetic acid and ethanol [56]. However, the demand of acetone as solvent is far lower than its production, due to the expanding market of phenol-derived products such as phenolic resins, bisphenol-A for polycarbonates production in this decade [57]. Thus, it is necessary to upgrade acetone to valuable products to cope with the surplus acetone in the market. The attempts of researchers to conduct SR over acetone not only provide an alternative pathway for H2 production, but also able to provide better understanding over the SR of acetic acid and ethanol processes. This is owing to the formation of acetone as intermediate species during the SR of acetic acid and ethanol processes. The overall stoichiometry equation for SR of acetone can be represented by the following equation: (5) CH3COCH3 + 5H2O → 3CO2 + 8H2 Δ 370 kJ/mol Sun et al. [58] evaluated the influence of cobalt (Co) particle size for SR of acetone over Co nanoparticles supported on activated carbon at 400 °C. They realized that the catalytic performance was highly reliant on the water dissociation rate, acetone decomposition rate, and the Co nanoparticles oxidation state. The highest catalytic activity was verified to be at Co particle size of 12.8 nm, as both too small and too large Co nanoparticles were having low oxidation state. From an investigation by González-Gil et al. [59], H2-rich syngas (H2 production ≈ 0.6 and 0.7 mol fraction) was yielded over the catalysts used (Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Rh/Al2O3) at > 527 °C. The introduction of Rh over the nanostructured Al2O3 modified the Ni nanoparticle size, reduced the quantity of coke deposited, and improved the catalytic activity. Another study reported on the adoption of NiCoMgAl mixed oxide catalysts with varying Ni/Co ratio (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0) for acetone-SR at temperature range of 450–550 °C, water/acetone ratio of 4–10 and space–time of 10–24 kg cat.h/kmol acetone [60]. The results obtained demonstrated that all the catalysts exhibited approximately 99% of acetone conversion, where maximum H2 selectivity of ∼ 80% was achieved for NiCoMgAl (Ni/Co ratio: 0.33). Another study by Basu et al. [61] reported on the application of Ni-Co/olivine catalyst for acetone-SR, where 99% acetone conversion and 80% H2 selectivity was obtained. SR of bio-oil by taking acetone as the model component was investigated over Ni-Rh/Al2O3, where the acetone conversion was 53% at reaction temperature of 700 °C [59]. They even found that higher amount of CH4, CO, CO2 as intermediate species were formed during acetone-SR at lower reaction temperature (<500 °C). Reducible (CeO2) and nonreducible (MgAl2O4, ZnO, AC) catalyst supports were tested with and without Co-addition acetone-SR in a work by Davidson et al. [62]. Only ketonization activity was observed over the bare oxide support, while the SR activity was promoted by the addition of Co to the support. All of the Co-containing catalysts had similar selectivities, with 87% CO2, 10% CO, and 3% CH4 as shown in Fig. 3 . A dual-bed (2-bed) catalyst system was applied to improve the stability of the SR catalyst. It was discovered that the 2-bed system displayed significantly enhanced stability and coke deposition was reduced by a factor of 4 when compared to the 1-bed system. The reaction mechanism of acetone-SR was proposed as the reaction is initiated by the acetone decomposition into ketene (C2H2O) and CH4 at temperatures > 500 °C (Eq. (6)) [63], followed by the ketene decomposition or ketene coupling to form ethylene and CO (Eq. (7)) [59]. Through a hydration process, ketene is converted to CH4 via hydration (Eq. (8)). H2 content in the gaseous product is increased via SR of acetone and ketene (Eq. (9), (10)). In overall, the main limitation for acetone-SR is the severe coke deposition problem when the reaction temperature < 650 °C, thus it is essential that the reaction to be carried out at ≥ 650 °C [64]. (6) CH3COCH3 → CH2CO + CH4 (7) CH2CO → ½ C2H4 + CO (8) CH2CO + H2O → CH4 + CO2 (9) CH3COCH3 + 2H2O → CH3COOH + CO + 3H2 (10) CH2CO + H2O ↔ 2CO + 2H2 2.2.2 Acetic acid Biomass derived acetic acid (HAc), one of the primary unwanted and nonfuel constituents in bio-oil (17–30 wt%) [65] can be considered as a safe hydrogen carrier. HAc is produced from bio-oil by fermentation process [66] and its abundant availability provokes its wise utilization for clean H2 production. The thermodynamic analysis on SR of HAc has reported that the high reaction temperature and high water/acetic acid molar ratio are essential for the generation of H2-rich gas [67]. Another thermodynamic study suggested that HAc/steam ratio of 1 to 2 is thermodynamically feasible with for H2 production via HAc-SR [68]. HAc-SR is commonly recognized as a combination of SR and WGS reactions; the overall stoichiometry can be represented by the following equation. (11) CH3COOH + 2H2O → 2CO2 + 4H2 Δ 131.4 kJ/mol HAc-SR was mostly performed by on Ni-based and Co-promoted Ni catalysts by using fixed-bed micro-reactor. The previous research evidenced the superiority of low cost Ni-based catalysts for effective HAc conversion and H2 selectivity [69–71], but they were susceptible to carbon deposition and catalyst deactivation. Pant et al. [66] applied Ni-Co/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst for HAc-SR, where conversion of HAc was 88% and H2 selectivity was 1.18 mol.% at 600 °C and HAc concentration of 15%. Meanwhile, Vagia et al. [72] reported that only 53% of HAc conversion was achieved at 550 °C with Ni/CaO-Al2O3 catalyst. They also postulated that Ni-based catalysts are more prone towards coke formation as compared to noble metal catalyst. Li et al. [73] who investigated the effects of Ni loading on metals distribution, mentioned that the optimal Ni loading of 16 wt% on Ni/ZrO2 was the most selective one and can suppress the coke formation. H2 yield of 15wt.%Ni/La2O3-ZrO2 catalyst was 89.27% at 600 °C, owing to its high BET surface area and optimal Ni loading that are sufficient to accommodate the gaseous reactant [74]. On the other hand, HAc has also been studied as a model compound for the bio-oil. In a work by Bimbela et al. [75], they executed the HAc-SR reaction by using different Ni contents (23, 28 and 33 wt%) and found that 28 wt% Ni content performed the best with 0.118 g H2/g of HAc (66.30 mol.%) was produced at 650 °C. Different Ni loadings (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 wt%) on Ni-Mg-Al hydrotalcite type precursors were studied as well, where 0.4 wt.%NiMg demonstrated the best catalytic performance due to its lowest coke formation and highest H2 yield (1.89 mol H2/mol HAc) [76] as shown in Fig. 4 . 80% of H2 yield was achieved over Cu-Zn/Ca-Al catalyst, credited to the presence of Zn as promoter in enhancing the H2 yield [77]. Meanwhile, Co-based catalysts are also preferable due to its capability to generate high H2 yield by promoting C–C bond rupture at temperatures as low as 400 °C [78]. Davidson et al. [62] verified that the Co addition to the catalytic supports are able to suppress coke deposition during HAc-SR. Ni supported on Ce-Zr is another promising catalyst with improved oxygen mobility of the catalyst to facilitate the redox coupling of Ce3+/Ce4+ [79]. The strong synergetic effect amidst Co and Ni created upon the addition of Co into Ni/La2O3 increased H2 selectivity and decreased the coke deposition as compared to Ni/La2O3 and Co/La2O3 [78]. Hu et al. [80] also used a series of Ni-Co catalysts for HAc-SR and they found that complete acetic acid conversion, H2 selectivity up to 96.3% and stability up to 70 h TOS were achieved at Ni/Co: 0.25/1. According to Choi et al. [81], the addition of promoters (K and La) onto Ni/α-Al2O3 increased their basicity significantly, which facilitated the side reaction of ketonization to form acetone. Meanwhile, Mg introduction enhanced the number of weak basic sites of Ni/α-Al2O3 to promote the SR of acetic acid in the absence of ketonization (100% H2 selectivity at 550 °C). Ni supported on low cost maize stalk ash catalyst was also synthesized for HAc-SR, where 27.1% of H2 yield was obtained at 900 °C [71]. The other low-cost catalyst, Ni/attapulgite clay achieved acetic acid conversion of ∼ 85% and H2 yield of ∼ 82% at 650 °C [82], while the Ni-Ce-Mg/olivine catalyst exhibited ≈100% HAc conversion and H2 yield up to 75% [83]. The plausible reaction mechanism of HAc-SR is shown in Fig. 5 , where the acetic acid is decomposed to COx and CHx at the preliminary stage of the reaction. Thereafter, the CHx is reacted with OH-species to from H2 and CO. The coke formation of the reaction is due to the oligomerization [84] or decomposition of acetic acid. 2.2.3 Ethanol Ethanol can be easily obtained from biomass waste such as agricultural, municipal, forestry waste, etc. via fermentation process, which often known as bioethanol. Even though the carbon emission for bioethanol is low when being adopted as a fuel in internal combustion engines, it is not preferable to be used directly due to the costly processes required for diluting the bioethanol (13 mol H2O/mol C2H5OH is needed) [85]. Besides, the purity of generated bioethanol is low with the presence of other compounds which are difficult to be separated. Therefore, the researchers proposed ethanol SR (ethanol: steam = 6:1) to address the limitations of direct usage of bioethanol, where a higher H2 yield per mole can be obtained as compared to methanol (3:1) or methane (4:1) [86]. Ethanol SR is an endothermic reaction and therefore the major challenge of the process is to minimize the heat energy required [87]. The thermodynamic study verified that the coke formation is favoured at S/C ratio is < 4; graphite carbon and multi-wall carbon nanotubes are formed at temperature less than and>400 °C, respectively [88]. The following equation represent the ideal equation for ethanol SR to produce H2 production, where the optimal steam to carbon ratio was reported to be 9.23 or 15% (by volume) ethanol concentration [89]. (12) C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2 Δ 174 kJ/mol According to the previous findings, H2 amount was low when ethanol SR was supplied with low steam due to the CO and CH4 production and acetaldehyde is produced as by-product due to the ethanol dehydrogenation [89]. To address the challenge of coke deposition, autothermal and oxidative SR of ethanol have been proposed to minimize the formed coke at the catalyst surface [90], but they resulted in lower H2 selectivity. In regard to this matter, researchers have gradually shifted their focus on catalysts modification strategy. There are various types of catalysts have been adopted for ethanol SR, which can be classified into transition metals (Ni, Cu, Co) [91–93], noble metals (Au, Ru, Pt, Pd) [94–97], and the bimetallic metals [98,99] supported on several supports such as Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, etc. However, Ni supported on ZrO2 and γ-Al2O3 supports were evidenced to perform better than Co supported for ethanol SR [100]. In comparison to Ni and Co, Cu-based catalysts led to the formation high amount of side products (acetaldehyde and ethylene) due to ineffectiveness in the of C–C bonds cleavage [101]. In a study, it was found that Pt/Al2O3 demonstrates superiority (90% conversion and 55% H2 selectivity) than Rh/Al2O3 [102]. Ru is prone to coke formation as it provokes the ethane formation via ethanol dehydration [95], whilst Rh possesses high ability in breaking C–C and C–H bonds and less prone to coke deposition [103]. The bimetallic Co-Rh supported on ZrO2 and CeO2 supports are susceptible to coke formation and RWGS compared to monometallic Co catalyst [104]. The similar findings were also evidenced the superiority of bimetallic catalysts than monometallic catalysts [105–108]. The reaction mechanisms of the ethanol SR have been investigated and reported by several researchers. Benito et al. [109] suggested that the ethanol SR process initiates with the adsorption of ethanol over active metal, meanwhile the water is chemisorbed over the catalytic support. Thereafter, the dehydrogenation of ethanol occurs to form hydrogen and acetaldehyde. The decomposition of acetaldehyde leads to the CH4 and CO formations. The obtained CH4 reacts with excess steam to obtain H2 and carbon monoxide. Lastly, WGSR happens and yields H2 and CO2 as the primary end products. Another reaction pathway was reported by Song et al. [110] on the Co/ZrO2 catalyst, where another undesired intermediate, acetone was formed on the catalyst to cause coking and catalyst deactivation and acetone SR may take place to produce H2 [110–112]. The other main limitation for ethanol SR is the production of side product, CH4 yield caused by ethanol decomposition. 2.2.4 Ethylene glycol EG is a significant element for chemical synthesis for multitudinous industrial applications and it is also a renewable and obtainable energy carrier as well as promising bio-oil model compound [113,114]. EG accounts for 35–50% component of pyrolysis of biomass or catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose or cellulosic biomass-derived oxygenates that are mostly considered as a model molecule of larger oxygenated compounds. Previous studies on H2 production from EG can be classified into gas-phase (steam reforming, SR) and liquid-phase reactions (aqueous phase reforming, APR). The reaction rates for APR are low as the reactions take place at mild temperature conditions and EG concentration in feed stream should be low in order to decelerate catalyst deactivation [115]. Meanwhile, the SR reactions can yield higher concentration of H2 as the reactions take place at higher temperatures [116]. Previous works have been attempted an integrated technology to produce EG and H2 simultaneously from cellulose feedstocks, since the H2 needed for catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose could be supplied by SR of EG. Eqn. (12) below represent the SR of EG for H2 production and it has been postulated that the complete decomposition of EG into H2 and CO takes place as the initial step for EG-SR via CHx (x = 1–3) fragments, followed by WGS reaction to produce H2 and CO2. The overall stoichiometry can be represented by the following equation. (13) C6H10O2 + 10H2O → 6CO2 + 15H2 Δ 91 kJ/mol In EG-SR, the S/C ratio is a key factor in affecting the reaction. When the EG concentration increased from 22.3% to 53.4%, the H2 production rate decreased from 1.28 to 0.59 mol/(g.h) at 500 °C, suggesting the EG is consumed by SR and WGSR at high S/C ratio [117]. Previously, the EG-SR often performed on monometallic Ni, Co, Pt, Rh, Pd and bimetallic. Low cost Ni/attapulgite catalyst demonstrated high H2 yield of 89.8%, which can be ascribed to its small Ni nanoparticle sizes and low surface acidity [118]. van Haasterecht et al. [119] found that the catalytic performance and H2 molar selectivities increased in the order: Cu < Ni < Co < Pt. [120] compared the catalytic activities of Ni and Ni-Pt supported hydrotalcite-derived catalysts in EG-SR, where Ni-Pt bimetallic (H2 selectivity = 84.6%) catalyst was highly active and selective to H2 while Ni catalyst (H2 selectivity = 69.5%) was more effective at low temperature off 450 °C. They also found that coke deposition is favoured at high temperatures (>525 °C) due to the thermal decomposition and condensation reactions. 3.75%Ni-1.25%Pt/Al2O3 achieved 60% of EG conversion, 45% H2 selectivity, 27% H2 yield, and 20 h of stability [121]. A previous study reported that the 18%Fe/MgO catalyst demonstrated 99.8% EG conversion and ∼ 77% H2 yield at S/C molar ratio of 5 and temperature of 650 °C [113]. Mei et al. [122] reported that highly active MgAl2O4 supported Rh and Ni catalysts achieved 100% conversion, but only 42% for Co catalyst during EG-SR (1 atm, 500˚C, S/C: 3.3). They also realized that MgAl2O4 support showed better coke resistance than Al2O3 in their investigation on the influence of catalytic supports. In an investigation of transition metals-based catalysts in EG-SR, Davda et al. [123] disclosed that the reforming activity followed the sequence of Pt ≈ Ni > Ru > Rh ≈ Pd > Ir. For the comparison of the supports, Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 (EG conversion : 94% and H2 yield : 67%) performed better than Ni/CeO2-SiO2, ascribed to its large pore volume and surface area [124]. A plausible reaction scheme of EG-SR has been proposed by Li et al. [125], where intermediate species formed from EG dehydrogenation adsorbed over the surface of the metal either by the formation of metal–oxygen and/or metal–carbon bonds. They postulated that strong acidity catalysts are not favorable for the process as they could depletes the H2 generation by producing alkanes. Meanwhile, high O2 storage metal oxides such as CeO2, TiO2 are prone towards WGSR and subsequently enhanced the H2 production. 2.2.5 Glycerol Glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol) is the primary side product (≈10 wt%) obtained from the transesterification process of edible and non-edible, and saponification of vegetable for the biodiesel production [126]. It is forecasted that the glycerol production will keep escalating in parallel with the demand of biodiesel in the future, which is anticipated to reach at up to 2.5 Mt/y in 2020 [127]. This phenomenon will cause an excessive glycerol production and a price drop by two-thirds within a decade [128]. The conventional usage of crude glycerol such as for pharmaceutical and food applications are unable to cope with its surplus quantity, as further purification is needed where the crude glycerol consists of 10–30% impurities (mainly water, free fatty acids, methanol, and salts) [129]. In regard to these matters, the interest of research in valuable conversion of glycerol has been stimulated, as 1 mol of inexpensive glycerol can conceptually produce up to 7 mol of H2 gas via SR technology. The utilization of glycerol for H2 production will not only improve the economics of biodiesel industry, but also address the challenge related to the disposal of the excessive glycerol. Glycerol-SR reaction is an endothermic process that can be expressed as follows, where the process initiates with the glycerol decomposition, followed by WGS reaction. (14) C3H8O3 + 3H2O ↔ 3CO2 + 7H2 Δ 128 kJ/mol The main restriction for glucose-SR is the happening of glucose coking at low and medium temperature (<650 °C), which subsequently lead to the severe catalyst agglomeration. Most of the studies related to glycerol SR were mainly focused Ni, Ir, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru supported catalysts for H2 from SR of glycerol. Adhikari et al. [130] performed glycerol SR process over three metal oxides catalysts (Ni/MgO, Ni/CeO2, and Ni/TiO2), where Ni/CeO2 with the highest surface area (67.0 m2/g) and metal dispersion (6.14%) was the best performed catalyst at optimal operating conditions. The maximum H2 selectivity achieved by Ni/CeO2 was 74.7% at S/C ratio of 12:1, temperature of 600 °C, and feed flow of 0.5 mL/min, while only 38.6% and 28.3% were attained by Ni/MgO and Ni/TiO2 under similar conditions. They also prepared a series of metals (Pt, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir) supported on Al2O3 catalysts for the evaluation via glycerol SR in temperatures ranging from 600 to 900 °C [131]. As compared, Ni/Al2O3 (H2 selectivity: 80%) and Rh-CeO2/Al2O3 (H2 selectivity: 71%) demonstrated the best catalytic activities with glycerol conversion of 94% at 900 °C, S/C ratio of 9:1, and feed flow of 0.15 mL/min. They even found that the increase in S/C ratio increased the H2 selectivity as well but increase in metal loadings did not result in positive impact. The additions of Ce, Mg, Zr and La as promoters on Ni/Al2O3 were found to improve the glycerol conversions and H2 selectivity [132]. Bimetallic 15 wt.%Ni-4 wt%x/SBA-15 (x: Cr, Co, Cu) catalysts synthesized by incipient wetness co-impregnation were adopted for glycerol SR to compare the efficiency of the promoters used [133], where the overall catalytic performance of the catalysts studied are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The Ni-Cr/SBA-15 catalyst manifested superiority in term of reduced coke formation and improved glycerol conversion, H2 selectivity. From the previous studies, the S/C ratio was found to influence the H2 production significantly for glycerol SR, where optimal ratio is essential to achieve high activity, suppress coke, CO formation. Theoretically, a high S/C ratio is required to favour the equilibrium towards the H2 production; too high ratios will increase the overall energy to evaporate the excess water. The common S/C ratio used in glycerol SR ranged from 3/1 to 20/1, where the selection of this ratio is dependent to the other operating conditions of the reaction. Meanwhile, the other concern of glycerol SR is the generation of considerable amount of side products, CO2 and CO. To address this problem, sorption-enhanced glycerol steam reforming (SEGSR) has been proposed as an integrated process to combine both in-situ CO2 adsorption with SR for H2 production. This integrated process is where the glycerol valorization via SESGR and CO2 conversion via catalytic hydrogenation take place in the same reactor. The potential of glycerol for high purity H2 production was confirmed with negligible coke formation [134,135]. 2.2.6 Kerosene Kerosene SR has only been given limited attention as it consists of aromatic hydrocarbons and long carbon chains which are prone to coke formation [136]. Kerosene SR is initiated by kerosene decomposition and followed by WGS to cause further conversion of CO to CO2 and production of higher H2. The exothermic nature of WGSR suggests the reaction is preferable to take place at high H2O/kerosene feed ratios [137]. The kerosene SR reaction can be represented by equation below: (15) C13H28 + 26H2O → 13CO2 + 40H2 The primary concerns of kerosene SR for H2 production are always coke deposition and high content of light hydrocarbons in the product stream, thus catalyst selection is of utmost importance. Grossman et al. [138] indicated that Ni/ZnO catalyst prepared by co-precipitation technique demonstrated high hydrodesulfurization performance for kerosene reaction. The catalytic performance of Ni-La/cordierite catalyst (kerosene conversion: 58.80%, H2 production: 0.622 s−1) improved significantly when small amount of K2O (kerosene conversion: 76.69%, H2 production: 0.84 s−1) was added. Even though non-noble metal catalysts (especially Ni-based catalysts) are highly active for kerosene SR, they exhibited serious catalyst durability problem due to coke formation by a combination of high temperature and high steam concentration [139]. Regarding this matter, Ru-based catalysts are most commonly used for kerosene SR. Suzuki et al. [140] reported almost complete conversion of kerosene into H2-gas gas over a Ru/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst at lower H2O/C ratio (H2O/C = 3.5) at 800 °C. They also found that deactivation of Ru/Al2O3 caused by sulfur poisoning can be improved significantly by Ce addition, subsequently lead to H2 production. Guo et al. [141] synthesized Ru and Ce supported on plate-type γ-Al2O3 support for kerosene SR. They found that H2 reduction was not required for Ru/γ-Al2O3 as high temperature N2 treatment completely decomposed the reducible Ru species. The high temperature calcination of Ru/γ-Al2O3 would lead to shrinking due to the oxidation of ruthenium chloride species and decreased in the metal dispersion over the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, the addition of Ce onto γ-Al2O3 was found to improve the catalyst resistivity to coke formation under a high space velocity. Kaynar et al. [137] verified the bi-metallic Ru-Ni supported on γ-Al2O3 catalyst performed better than mono-metallic Ni or Ru catalysts for kerosene SR. They also postulated that the catalyst stability improved with an increase in H2O/C ratio in the feed stream, where the optimal H2O/C feed ratio was 5.84. 2.2.7 Phenol Phenol is made up of 38% by weight total constituent of unwanted component of pyrolysis oil and can also be obtained from industrial wastewater [142]. It is known as a toxic waste and pollutant for environment due to the negative impacts upon the direct discharge of the phenol-rich tar into the environment, especially in developing countries [143]. Due to the corrosivity of the phenols and phenolic compounds, they cannot be used as fuels [144] but to transform into useful chemicals (cyclohexane, cyclohexanol, and aromatics) by hydrodeoxygenation [145,146]. However, removing the 33–50% water content from the phenolics of pyrolysis oil by chemical and physical methods is cost-ineffective process [147] and transformation of phenol is difficult due to easy condensation issue inside the pipes and devices [148]. Thus, it is desirable to produce H2 from H2-rich and water-soluble phenol and the reaction for phenol SR is represented as below. (16) C6H5OH + 11H2O → 6CO2 + 14H2 Δ 463.65 kJ/mol Metal supported catalysts such as Fe [149], Ni [150], Rh [148], Pt and Pd [151], Co [152] have been used for phenol SR. Previous literature evidenced the phenol conversion increased with the increasing of temperature [54,151,153,154]. Polychronopoulou et al. [153] compared the phenol SR over Rh supported over single metal oxides (ZrO2, CeO2, and MgO) and various mixed metal oxides (Mg-Ce-Zr-O, Mg-Zr-O, and Mg-Ce-O) at 700 °C and S/C of 13.3. Rh/MgO demonstrated the highest H2 product concentrations (11.6 mol.%) and selectivities (91.9%). They also realized that small Rh nanoparticles and high-water concentration (20–40 mol%) are favourable for the reaction. At 750 °C, the phenol conversion and H2 selectivity were attained at 81 % and 59 %, respectively, whilst coke deactivation was resulted when the reaction was conducted at 800 °C due to sintering issue [54]. A comparative study over different Ni-based catalysts (Ni/K-La-ZrO2 and Ni/Ce-ZrO2) for phenol SR has been executed by Güell et al. [150], where highest activity Ni/K-La-ZrO2 deactivated for the WGSR at a largest extent. The lesser coke deposition of Ni/Ce-ZrO2 can be ascribed to its high redox properties. The Ni-Ca-Al-O bi-functional catalyst recorded H2 purity of 98.88% and ∼ 100% phenol conversion [155]. The effects of Ni and Co loadings over ZrO2 has been investigated by Nabgan et al. [142] at 600 °C and C/S ratio of 1:9. 3%Ni1%Co/ZrO2 performed the best (phenol conversion: 53.5%, H2 yield: 50.4%) among the catalysts, owing to its highest basicity and coking resistance. The effect of promoters (Co, Cu, Cr) on Ni/SBA-15 has been investigated by [156], where the ascendency performance by Co and Cr promoted Ni/SBA-15 samples can be credited to the Co and Cr in facilitating the H2O activation and forming very small Ni crystallites, which accounting for strong interaction of metals with the support. The reaction pathway of phenol SR has been proposed by Nabgan et al. [17] over Ni-Co/ZrO2 and the reaction scheme is shown in Fig. 7 . The reaction is started with the phenol molecules dehydrogenation to produce *C3HxO species, followed by the C–C bond cleavage to form *CHyO species. Dehydrogenation of *CHyO species forms *CO, *CO could undergo desorption to produce CO and WGS reaction to form CO2 and H2. 2.2.8 Toluene As one of the most abundant components in bio-oil (14 wt%) [157] and having stable aromatic characteristics [158], toluene is always chosen as the model compound for SR of bio-oil. Indeed, toluene and toluene-containing volatile substances possess a demonstrative addictive potential for humans as the misuse of these substances provokes various biochemical, molecular, and structural alterations in the humans. Therein, the direct disposal of toluene-containing bio-oil to the environment is strongly opposed by the environmentalists and researchers, but preferable to transform the toluene into H2 by SR. Toluene SR can be represented as following equation. (17) C7H8 + 14 H2O → 7CO2 + 18 H2 A series of biochar-supported Ni catalysts were synthesized and firstly explored by Zhang et al. [159] for SR of toluene as a tar model compound at low temperature of 600 °C. They postulated that the reaction is highly dependent on the Ni nanoparticles size, where the superior performance (highest intrinsic activity and best stability) was shown by 5% Ni with the smallest Ni nanoparticle size (4.2 nm). There was another study adopted activated carbon as catalytic support, where the formation of Ni-Co bimetallic structure by 10%Ni-10%Co/activated carbon led to the increase in the surface area, microporous structure, and homogeneous dispersion of the metals [160]. The catalyst demonstrated high toluene conversion and H2 yield at 70% and 69%, respectively. Optimum operating conditions investigation has been executed by Tao et al. [161] over Ni-CeO2/SBA-15. Highest performance (toluene conversion = 98.9%) was achieved at S/C ratio of 3 and 850 °C using the Ni-3%CeO2/SBA-15 catalyst. At 627 °C, > 95% of toluene conversion was achieved by low-cost Ni/lignite insoluble residue catalyst [162]. Mg/olivine supported on different loadings of Ni (active metal) and Ce (promoter) were prepared to investigate the influence of active metals loadings for the catalytic activity in toluene SR. Apart from proving the presence of Ni and Ce suppressed the coke formation, an excellent performance (toluene conversion: 89%, product gas rate: 5.6 L h−1, H2 content: 62.6 mol%) was shown by 3%Ni-1%Ce-1%Mg/olivine. In an investigation of the effect of catalytic supports over toluene SR, Ni/Al2O3 demonstrated higher toluene conversion but lower resistance to deactivation (20–50%) compared to Ni/mayenite catalyst (<10%) at different S/C ratio [163]. As compared to Ni/LaAlO3 and Ni/α-Al2O3 catalysts, Ni/La0.8Sr0.2AlO3 catalysts demonstrated the most excellent catalytic performance (toluene conversion: 97.5%, H2 yield: 43%). Reaction mechanism and kinetic model for toluene SR have been proposed for La0.8Sr0.2Ni0.8Fe0.2O3 perovskite catalyst [164], where the importance of adsorbed O2 species/redox property for toluene SR has been realized. Aldehyde species are produced as intermediate species from the reaction between adsorbed acetylene (C2H2) or methylene (CH2) (from toluene decomposition on metal site) and adsorbed O2 (from H2O activation). 2.2.9 Methanol High energy density methanol has been acknowledged as a sustainable feedstock for high-purity H2 production as it is a readily available source and can be produced from renewable feedstocks [165,166]. Methanol is also preferable for H2 production owing to its high S/C ratio, absence of C–C bonds (low risk of coke formation), low reforming temperature needed (200–300 °C), and safe handling [167,168]. Due to the high toxicity of water-soluble methanol, methanol SR reaction is known to be a very attractive and promising process for H2 production, and it can be described by the following reaction equation. It was postulated that the water molar fraction to be above the stoichiometry to prevent coke formation and the optimal ratio for maximum activity was suggested at water/methanol ratio of 1.5:1 [19]. (18) CH3OH + H2O → CO2 + 3H2 Δ 49.5 kJ/mol Cu-based catalysts are the most widely used for the methanol SR reaction due to their excellent activity, selectivity, ability to produce high H2 and low cost [169]. However, these catalysts tend to produce CO as a side product, low stability and are prone to catalyst deactivation by thermal sintering [170]. Therefore, great efforts have been executed to search for other types of catalysts, introduction of promoters [171–173] and modification of the preparation method [174,175]. Apart from Cu-based catalysts, the methanol SR has also been performed over Ni, Pt, Pt, Ru, Ir, and Co metals supported on various catalytic supports such as SiO2, ZnO, MgO, Al2O3, etc. Among the metals, the most widely used catalyst in this group is the high performance Pd/ZnO. Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated higher long-term stability as compared with commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts with an initial deactivation of 17% [171]. There are several literatures also reported on the ascendency of Pd-based catalyst than other metals (Pt, Ir, Ru, and Ir) by showing higher methanol conversion and lower CO production [176–178]. Au-Ti-Ce/montmorillonite catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance at 350 °C (methanol conversion: 72% and H2 selectivity: 99%) [165] as shown in Fig. 8 . Regarding the effort of modifying the preparation method of catalyst, Jakdetchai et al. [179] modified the impregnation method with 1,3-butanediol during the preparation of Cu-Zn/ FSM-16. The modified Cu-Zn/FSM-16 performed better (absence of Co at 230 °C) as compared to the catalyst synthesized by the conventional wet impregnation method, due to improved Cu dispersion. Yao et al. [180] examined the effect of preparation techniques of Cu/ZrO2 (conventional aqueous coprecipitation, impregnation, and oxalate gel-coprecipitation) over methanol SR. The outcome of the study evidenced the changes in the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance with different preparation methods. The oxalate gel co-precipitation prepared Cu/ZrO2 catalyst with higher Cu dispersions and small crystallite size showed better catalytic activity and improved long-term stability in the methanol SR reaction. [181] synthesized high surface area and high metal dispersion of Cu/ZrO2 by using a reflux treatment. This preparation technique was verified to be more superior than conventional impregnation method as a higher activity and stability catalyst was produced. Frank et al. [182] postulated that methanol SR initiates by the methanol dissociative adsorption over the catalyst surface, while the active sites are crucial for the adsorption of H2 and other intermediates. Another possible reaction mechanism of methanol SR has been described by Zhang et al. [183], where the intermediate species, formaldehyde produced by methanol dehydrogenation is attacked by a methoxy group and form methyl formate as intermediate. Methyl formate then decomposes with –OH groups to methoxy and formate groups. The formate group lastly dehydrogenates to produce H2 and CO2. According to Papavasiliou et al. [184] whom studied the mechanistic pathways over three Cu/MnO2, Cu/CeO2, and Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. It was found that the reaction mechanism over both Cu/MnO and Cu/CeO2 catalysts occurred via a methyl formate intermediate, while the methanol SR over Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst happened via dioxomethylene intermediate. 2.2.10 Propane Propane is a side product of petroleum refining and natural gas processing, which made up of 50.6 mol% of the total composition of liquified petroleum gas [172]. Propane is a promising candidate as a H2 source as it is a gas at standard temperature and pressure and able to produce 10 mol of H2 per mol of propane fed (Eqn. (18)) when excess steam is used in the industrial operations for minimizing the catalyst deactivation [185]. The CO2/H2 ratio of the gaseous product is much lower than partial oxidation process (0.3), suggesting a higher amount of H2 can be obtained from this process [186]. As compared to methane, a higher amount of H2 per unit volume can be produced by propane SR. Propane SR exhibits drawbacks since it requires a high S/C ratio of > 6 to minimize coke formation over the catalyst [186]. The intermediates identified from propane SR are ethylene (C2H4), methane (CH4), and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) molecules. (19) C3H8 + 6H2O → 10H2 + 3CO2 Δ 499 kJ/mol For propane SR, the most commonly studied active metals were Co and Ni-supported on catalytic supports such as MgO, Al2O3, KOH, etc. Noble metals such as Rh, Pt, and Ru were less adopted despite their highly active nature and low coke deposition, due to economic reasons. Many researchers have also postulated the crucial role of promoters with high oxygen transfer capability on metal-based catalysts in rendering high catalytic activity and suppressing the coke formation. In the comparison of catalytic performance of Pd-Cu/Al2O3 catalyst and over a Ni/NiAl2O4 catalyst, Pd based catalyst demonstrated higher selective and coke resistance due to high ability of Pd metal to adsorb olefins forming di- σ -bonded species [187]. A series of Ce-doped Co/Al2O3 catalysts were evaluated by propane SR at 700 °C for 10 h, where 0.85%Co0.15%Ce/Al2O3 catalyst showed almost complete propane conversion and H2 selectivity of about 75% with the least carbon deposition [186]. Bimetallic Ni-Fe supported on γ -Al2O3 (propane conversion: 100%, and H2 selectivity: 86%) was verified to perform better as compared to monometallic Ni/ γ -Al2O3 (H2 selectivity: 79%) at 700 °C due to improved stability and sintering resistance [185]. Kim et al. [185] attempted to introduce Fe to Ni/Al2O3 to increase its catalytic stability, where they found the optimum Ni/Fe ratio was Ni/Fe: 0.8:/0.2. This catalyst achieved the propane conversion of 100% and H2 yield of 83%, due to the reduced catalytic poisoning by CO molecules as they were transformed into CO2 by WGSR. At low operating temperature (200–400 °C), Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 catalyst performed better than Rh/γ-Al2O3 and other Rh/Ce1-xZrxO2 catalysts due to its superior H2O adsorption activity and redox property [188]. These attributes facilitated the steam activation and thereby improved the propane SR activity and its stability for at least 50 h. In a study, pure H2 can be produced from propane by using a compact reformer at moderate operating temperatures of 475–550 °C [189]. Kim et al. [185] also proposed a possible reaction scheme of propane SR over Ni-Fe/ γ -Al2O3 catalyst. Thermal cracking followed by the dehydrogenation of propane over the metallic Ni site form C2H4 and CH4, while CH3CHO is produced by C2H4 oxidation over NiFeO. Thereafter, the thermal cracking of CH3CHO produces CH4 and CO and then they participate in CH4-SR and the CO-WGSR over Ni and FeO, respectively. Finally, the CO2 and H2 are obtained after CO molecules underwent CO-WGSR. To date, there were many SR of solvents and biomass-derived solvents reported in the literature. To ease the comparison, Table 3 have been made to summarize the major findings of the related published literature."
4,Lipids and derivatives,"2.3 Lipids and derivatives SR technology can also be adopted for H2 generation from semi volatile and volatile oxygenated hydrocarbons such as lipids and its derivatives. Lipids are attractive targets for SR technology due to their high energy density and chemical similarity with petroleum-based diesel fuels. The previous report indicated that the waste lipids production (waste vegetable oil, waste lubricating oil, waste cooking oil, waste animal fat residuals from meat animal processing facilities, and sewer trap grease) in the U.S. was>10 billion pounds/year, suggesting a rich source of low-cost feedstocks for renewable fuel and chemicals production [216]. Waste lipids are usually adopted for biodiesel production via transesterification processes (converting triacylglycerols to fatty acid methyl ester), apart from landfilling and other disposal practices [217,218]. Regrettably, the conventional transesterification processes require a high amount of alcohol and high quality triacylglycerols feedstocks free of moisture and free fatty acids to promote saponification and emulsification [219,220]. Thus, researchers have gradually shifted their research direction to H2 production through SR of cooking oils [221–223]. The initiative of this approach was provoked by the rich free fatty acids content of cooking oil, thus beneficial in initiating the cracking reactions during the reaction. In the meantime, biodiesel also demonstrates high potential for H2 production as it consists of high calorific value, shorter carbon chains than original oils, and low viscosity. The wise utilization of increasing supply of biodiesel (forecasted to reach 42 billion litres in 2021) for H2 production will assure a sustainable development of biodiesel industry in the future [224]. 2.3.1 Cooking oils Waste cooking oil is produced in a wide variety of restaurants and subsequently creates its treatment and disposal problem. The reuse of waste cooking oils in large scale can cause some serious health hazards due to the possibly presence of carcinogenic free radicals in the oil [225]. Owing to the similar chemical and physical properties of vegetable oil with diesel, it has been proposed to be used as substitutes over diesel in internal combustion engines. According to a life-cycle analysis, the production of H2 from cooking oils can reduce the NOx and SOx at atmospheric levels, subsequently result in a lesser global warming impact than fossil fuels [226]. Thus, H2 production via SR of waste cooking oil is a promising approach as the feedstock exhibits advantages of low O2 content, low sulfur, high heating value, ease of transportation, aromatic content, and high H2 yield [222,227]. The use of cheap waste cooking oil is also advantageous as there is already a distribution and production infrastructure in place. The most importantly, the SR of cooking oils does not require any fossil fuels, unlike bio-oils generation via the gasification or pyrolysis of biomass for H2 production [223]. A thermodynamics analysis reported the optimum condition of SR of cooking oils for maximum H2 and minimum CH4 yields was approximately at 600–650 °C and S/C ratio of 5–6 [228]. Marquevich et al. [229] performed SR of sunflower oil for H2 production over a commercial Ni-based catalyst at different S/C ratios (3, 6, and 9) and temperature (550–880 °C) at GHSV of 9150 h−1. Apart from the runs performed at the 550 °C and at S/C ratio of 3, all the runs indicated the complete conversion of sunflower oil to H2, CH4, and CO2 and the H2 yield ranged from 72% to 87%. They also compared the sunflower oil-SR over Ni/hydrotalcite material (Ni/Al atom ratio: 2/1) with other commercial catalysts at different S/C ratios (3, 6, and 9) and temperature (500–650 °C) [222]. Hydrotalcite materials which belong to the class of anionic clays are highly active and have good stability. The results demonstrated that a higher H2 formation rate was achieved by Ni/hydrotalcite than commercial catalysts. The inferior performance by commercial catalysts can be related to the higher competitive adsorption between sunflower oil and steam over the active sites of catalysts. In the meantime, chemical looping SR refers to a process that uses both H2O and O2 to react with fuel. In this case, the metal oxide catalyst is reduced by the fuel to pure metal followed by SR over the reduced catalyst to oxidize back the catalyst to its oxide form. The chemical looping SR of waste cooking vegetable oil in the presence of dolomite over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for in-situ CO2 sorption has yielded > 95% purity of hydrogen at 600 °C, 1 atm and S/C ratio of 4 [230]. The optimum reaction conditions were found to be at the S/C molar ratio of 4 and temperature between 600 and 700 °C. No declination in the reactants conversions, H2 purity and carbon products selectivity was found after 6 cycles of reaction at 600 °C. Shotipruk et al. [231] performed SR of three types of free fatty acids (linoleic acids, oleic, and palmitic) and palm fatty acid distilled over different Ce/Zr ratios of Ce/ZrO2 and preparation techniques. In comparison, the Ce/ZrO2 with Ce/Zr ratio of 3/1 and prepared by cationic surfactant-assisted method performed the best and least tendency toward coke deposition, credited to its high surface area and high oxygen vacancy. In terms of catalyst testing, Fig. 9 depicts the selectivities variations of H2 and other gaseous by-product produced over Ce-ZrO2 (Ce/Zr ratio: 3/1) at 1123 K. From the figure, it is illustrated that apart from the major component, H2 yielded from the process, the remaining side gaseous products include CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6. 2.3.2 Biodiesel Biodiesel produced via the transesterification of animal fats or vegetable oil with methanol is a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Biodiesel is renewable, and non-polluting resource with low sulphur content and high energy density. Presently, biodiesel production accounts for 20% of world biofuel production (33 billion litres/year) [126]. Regrettably, H2 production via biodiesel is among the least explored liquid feedstocks. Most of the previous literature reported the H2 production from biodiesel was from ATR of biodiesel for fuel cell applications [232–236]. However, ATR of biodiesel possesses several challenges of catalyst deactivation, low biodiesel conversion, and higher hydrocarbons formation. With regards to these matters, H2 production by mean of SR of biodiesel has been introduced (Eq. (20)) to address the challenges faced by ATR of biodiesel. (20) CnHm + 2nH2O → (m/2 + 2n)H2 + nCO2 Nahar et al. [237] executed the SR of biodiesel at varied operating parameters such as residence time, temperature (600–800 °C), and S/C ratio (2–3) Ni-Ca/Al and Ni-Ce/ZrO2 catalysts at atmospheric pressure. The H2 yield efficiencies achieved for both Ni-Ca/Al and Ni-Ce/ZrO2 catalysts were 91% and 94%, respectively at temperature of 650 °C, S/C of 3 at WHSV of 3.18 h−1. They also evidenced that an increase in S/C ratio led to higher H2 yield and lower carbon deposition, while the introduction of Sn and K negatively impacted the H2 yield. Abatzoglou et al. [238] examined the biodiesel SR in a fixed-bed reactor over Al2O3/YSZ-supported NiAl2O4 spinel catalyst, where complete conversion has been attained at temperature of 725 °C, S/C ratio of 1.9, and GHSV of 5500 h−1. At 725 °C, the conversion decreased with an increase in the S:C ratio along with the GHSV increment. Martin et al. [239] reported a maximum H2 efficiency of 76% for the SR of biodiesel with heat integration at S/C: 3 within the temperature range from 700 to 850 °C. The exact mechanism of biodiesel SR is not completely understood, but it is well- known that C1 compounds are produced at the initial stage of higher apliphatic hydrocarbons-SR by irreversible chemisorption at the catalyts surface [240]. By following this type of mechanism, a methylene group (–CH2-) is formed as the hydrocarbon adsorbs dissociatively at the surface of the metal and undergoes further dehydrogenation. Subsequently, adsorbed O2 and H2 are produced when H2O reacts with metal atoms. Lastly, the –CH species are produced via the dehydrogenation step and then react with adsorbed O2 to form CO [241]. The CO is then converted to CO2 and CH4 via parallel WGSR and methanation reactions. Table 4 presents the important findings obtained from the SR of lipids and derivatives."
5,Conclusion and future prospects,"2.4 Conclusion and future prospects Even though the main feedstock for H2 production is still natural gas nowadays, the attempt of performing SR technology by using alternative renewable feedstocks such as biomass is of great interest owing to the environmental and economic apprehensions. The research endeavors in SR of biomass-derived oxygenates and waste aim for exploiting value-added products, and green H2 that can substitute fossil fuels in the future whilst ameliorating the global warming menace. This review has aimed to present and integrate the previously reported of liquid biomass-derived oxygenates and waste as alternative feedstocks for green H2 production via SR technology. Previous literature indicated that SR processes of liquid biomass oxygenates and waste processes are significantly influenced by the nature of the feedstocks, type of catalysts, reaction conditions, etc. The main detrimental issue of SR technology is always coke precursors formation by dehydrogenation reactions. From a thermodynamic point of view, high reaction temperature and steam/oxygenate ratio are preferable for high H2 production and catalyst stability. Among the feedstock groups discussed in this review, SR of industrial effluents are deemed to be a less practical process due to the extremely high-water content in the industrial wastewater. High energy consumption is required to evaporate the excess water in the feedstocks and thus subsequently increase the overall capital cost of the process. Previous techno-economic analyses have explicated that the cost of green H2 production is highly dependent on the cost of biomass if to be purchased and still impeded by costly production process due to extra processes needed to pre-treat the feedstocks and to increase the purity of H2 produced. These challenges of biomass are required to be addressed before the potential scale-up of these processes can be realized in the near future. To maximize H2 production, future research should be directed in the area of development of more promising catalysts that can improve selectivity toward hydrogen and suppress undesired side reactions. Most importantly, the catalyst must remain active for a sufficient period of time for it to be implemented commercially.
