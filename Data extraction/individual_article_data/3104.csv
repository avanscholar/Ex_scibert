0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is recognized as an emerging new energy carrier and important chemical raw material for the future. Nowadays, most hydrogen that is used for commercial ammonia production and/or petroleum refining, is produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas, naphtha, heavy oil and coal via catalytic reforming and partial oxidation processes. However, the production of hydrogen from these energy sources will aggravate the depletion of fossil fuels and increase the emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere during the production. Currently, biomass as an alternative feedstock for hydrogen production has attracted considerable attention because it is not only renewable but an environmentally- friendly resource [1,2]. Hydrogen can be generated from biomass mainly via two kinds of thermochemical processes, the gasification [3,4] or the flash pyrolysis [5–7] followed by steam reforming of the pyrolysis oil. The pyrolysis oil, known as bio-oil, is a mixture of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, sugars, phenols, guaiacols, syringols, furans, and multifunctional compounds [8], and has the advantages of collection, transportation and storage. Conversion of bio-oil from biomass in large scale can fast improve development of biomass energy utilization [9]. However, the entire bio-oil tends to polymerize, clogging the feedstock inlet because of its complex composition. With the addition of water, the bio-oil can be separated into a hydrophobic lignin-derived fraction and an aqueous (hydrophilic) fraction containing mostly the carbohydrate-derived compounds. Pyrolytic lignin is a valuable material that can be used to generate different chemicals and additives, while the aqueous fraction can be steam reformed to generate hydrogen. This strategy is cost-effective and free of feeding problems. Moreover, the fact that the aqueous phase of bio-oil contains ∼80% water significantly reduces the need to use additional water for the steam reforming reaction [10,11]. Thus, our research focuses on the production of hydrogen via reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil. Steam reforming of bio-oil can be described by the following reaction stoichiometry: (1) C n H m O k + ( n − k ) H 2 O → n CO + ( n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 The above reaction is followed by the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction: (2) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Thus the overall process (complete steam reforming of bio-oil) can be represented as follows: (3) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O → n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 A side effect of these reactions is the carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface. Mechanisms of carbon formation and methods for its minimization have been reported previously [12,13]. Carbon can be decreased by controlling W/B ratio and by enhancing steam adsorption on the catalyst to gasify any carbon or carbon precursors formed on the catalyst surface. Recently, steam reforming of bio-oil components, has been persistently investigated [14–20]. Chornet and co-workers [14,19–20] are the first who investigated the process of steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction, and they have also proposed an integrated process concept of hydrogen production via bio-oil aqueous fraction. They have mainly tested commercial or Ni-based catalysts. Basagiannis and Verykios [15–17] investigated the influence of the metal (noble metals and Ni) and the support type (Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3, MgO/Al2O3) on bio-oil reforming. Xun Hu and Gongxuan Lv [18] found that Ni–Co catalyst is a promising catalyst for bio-oil reforming to generate hydrogen, and at T = 673 K, LHSV = 5.1 h−1, S/C = 7.5:1, the catalyst exhibited high activity and moreover satisfied long-term stability for CO-free hydrogen production. Hydrogen production from catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction coupled with in situ carbon dioxide capture was investigated. Maximum hydrogen yield of 75% was obtained in the presence of calcined dolomite, as hydrogen content was 83% [10]. In addition, a lot of studies on the steam reforming of the model compound of bio-oil were reported [21–25]. Takanabe and co-workers [21–23] investigated steam reforming of acetic acid (a model compound present in bio-oil) over Pt/ZrO2 catalysts. They established the bifunctional mechanism for steam reforming of acetic acid, where both Pt and ZrO2 participate in the reaction. The presence of Pt is essential for the formation of H2 and then H2O is activated on ZrO2 to create supplementary surface hydroxyl groups, which can participate in steam reforming and water-gas shift reactions. Similarly, Yamazaki [24] prepared nanoporous Ru/ZrO2 catalysts by a sol-gel method and a template method for steam reforming of bio-oil. Cyrille Rioche [25] studied the steam reforming of the model compounds of bio-oil such as acetic acid, phenol, acetone and ethanol over Pt, Pd and Rh supported on alumina and a ceria–zirconia sample. They found that the ceria–zirconia materials showed a higher activity than the corresponding alumina samples. In this work, we prepared a series of the Ni/CeO2/ZrO2 catalysts and applied them to the steam reforming reaction of the real bio-oil that was obtained from rice hull by fast pyrolysis. The aim of the present work is to investigate the performance of the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts for hydrogen production by steam reforming bio-oil aqueous fraction and compare it with the commercial nickel-based catalysts (Z417). Effects of the reaction temperature, water-to-bio-oil ratio, and the loaded weight of Ni and Ce on the hydrogen yield and hydrogen selectivity were evaluated."
1,Experimental setup,
2,Bio-oil and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Bio-oil and catalyst preparation The ZrO2 support was prepared by the precipitation method. The aqueous solution of ZrOCl2 was added to a vigorously stirred solution of NH4OH according to the ratio of n(Zr)/n(OH−) at T = 50 °C, pH = 9. The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water, then dried in air at 110 °C for 6 h. Finally, the support precursor was calcined in air at 600 °C for 6 h. A series of Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts with different Ni2+ and Ce4+ concentration were prepared by impregnating ZrO2 powder with Ni(NO3)2·6H2Oand Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, as Ni and Ce precursor, followed by drying at 110 °C for 12 h, calcinating at 800 °C for 6 h and by natural cooling for testing. Bio-oil employed in the experiment was produced from rice hull in an auto-thermal biomass pyrolysis reactor (obtained from Renewable Clean Energy Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China) [10]. The main elemental composition of bio-oil, the organics in its aqueous fraction and hydrophobic fraction are given in Table 1 . Characteristic peaks of bio-oil pyrolysis vapor detected by IR spectrum are shown in Fig. 1 and their corresponding substance or functional groups are listed in Table 2 ."
3,Apparatus and steam reforming tests,"2.2 Apparatus and steam reforming tests The bio-oil aqueous fraction steam reforming experiments were carried out in a continuous flowing system using a fixed-bed reactor made of quartz under atmospheric pressure (Fig. 2 ). The catalyst powder was placed in the middle of the quartz tube, which was heated by the furnace equipped with temperature controller. The calcined catalyst was reduced in situ in 5% H2/N2 stream at 700 °C for 4 h prior to reaction. Bio-oil aqueous fraction was fed into the reactor at a constant rate by a peristaltic pump. The gas exiting from the reactor was cooled and dried before entering gas chromatograph (GC522) for analysis. At the end of the catalytic tests, the catalyst was cooled under N2 stream. The bio-oil aqueous fraction steam reforming performance over a self-made catalyst was studied by measuring hydrogen yield efficiency and the content of product gas. Hydrogen yield efficiency was denoted as Y H 2 , and the content of product gas (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide) was denoted as V%product. Since nitrogen was introduced as carrier gas, measured value of gas component was normalized. Hydrogen content was defined in terms of the moles of hydrogen in per mole of product gas [10,14,15]: (4) V% H 2 = H 2 H 2 + CH 4 + CO + CO 2 × 100 % The calculated method of the content of other product gas was similar to that of H2. According to the reaction (3), the stoichiometric H2 is calculated. Then hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) is calculated as follow [10,14,15]: (5) Y H 2 = H 2 yield stoichiometric H 2 × 100 %"
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effects of reaction temperature,"3.1 Effects of reaction temperature Fig. 3 presented the effects of reaction temperature on the bio-oil steam reforming over the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 (12 wt% Ni, 7.5 wt% Ce) catalyst in the temperature range 450 °C–800 °C. It was found that the reaction temperature had profound effects on the hydrogen yield and contents of the product gas. The hydrogen yield increased obviously with increasing the reaction temperature. The hydrogen yield was just 9.4% at 450 °C, but it reached the highest of 69.7% with the reaction temperature increasing to 800 °C. As shown in Fig. 3, we can find that the content of CO sharply decreased from 20.1% to 6.9% when the reaction temperatures changed from 450 °C to 750 °C. On the contrary, both the content of H2 and CO2 increased with increasing the temperature, and the content of CO2 reached the maximum value of 26.1% at 750 °C. An interesting phenomenon was observed that the CO content reached a maximum value of 20.1%, while the CO2 content reached a minimum value of 19.3% at 550 °C, which may be attributed to the Eq. (2), the reverse water-gas shift reaction [26]. Further increasing the temperature to 800 °C, the CO2 content decreased to 25.0% and the H2 content increased to a maximum value of 61.9%. In the whole reaction temperature range, CH4 content first increased and then decreased. At 700 °C, a maximum CH4 content of 7.7% was obtained which may be attributed to the side reaction (methanation of CO2) which takes place during the steam reforming of bio-oil. Vannice [27] pointed out that Ni showed high activity in the methanation of CO2 (Fig. 4 )."
6,Effects of Ni loading,"3.2 Effects of Ni loading The catalytic performance for the steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction over the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst was evaluated in the temperature range from 450 °C to 800 °C when the Ni loading in the catalyst varied from 5 wt% to 12 wt% and the Ce loading was fixed at 10 wt% as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . The catalysts performed low catalytic activities at temperature below 650 °C, while high hydrogen yield could be obtained above this temperature. The activities of the catalysts were improved with the increase of Ni loading. And moreover, hydrogen yield increased with increasing reaction temperature. As the Ni concentration reached 12 wt% in Ni/CeO2–ZrO2, hydrogen yield reached the highest of 67.8% and hydrogen content was 61.8% at the reforming temperature of 800 °C and W/B = 4.9 (Fig. 5)."
7,Effects of Ce loading,"3.3 Effects of Ce loading Here the Ni loading was fixed at 12 wt% and the Ce loading was varied from 5 wt% to 10 wt% in the catalysts, the catalytic performance of the catalysts for the steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction were evaluated in the temperature range from 450 °C to 800 °C. The addition of Ce loading hardly had effects on the content of the product gases at 800 °C, but it had profound effect on the hydrogen yield as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 . When Ce loading was increased to 7.5 wt%, hydrogen yield reached the highest of 69.7% and hydrogen selectivity was 61.9% at T = 800 °C and W/B = 4.9. The Ce loading above 7.5 wt% resulted in an obvious drop of hydrogen yield. It is well known that an active catalyst for reforming of oxygenate compounds should be effective for cleavage of CC bond and for WGS reaction [18]. Ni had good activity for CC bond cleavage and limited activity for WGS reaction [26,28,29]. ZrO2 acts as an oxygen supplier and steam adsorption enhances the catalytic performance of Ni-based catalysts in the reforming reactions [30,31]. The loading of CeO2 could improve the stability of the Ni-based catalysts because CeO2 has high oxygen storage/release capacity [32] that would lead to better anti-carbon deposition ability of catalysts. Thus, the loading of CeO2 plays an important role on the activity of the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst for the steam reforming of bio-oil (Fig. 7)."
8,Effects of molar water-to-bio-oil ratio (W/B),"3.4 Effects of molar water-to-bio-oil ratio (W/B) Fig. 8 presents the effects of W/B on the reforming reaction. Hydrogen yield and the content of the product gas were depicted as a function of W/B ranging from 3.2 to 5.8. It could be found that W/B had profound effect on the hydrogen yield and the content of the product gas. Hydrogen yield increased from 64.7% to 69.7% while increasing W/B from 3.2 to 4.9. Further increasing W/B to 5.8 resulted in hydrogen yield decrease to 60.8%. At the same tine, CH4 content decreased with increasing W/B from 3.2 to 4.9 and increased slightly while W/B ratio changed from 4.9 to 5.8. In addition, in the given W/B range, H2 content and CO2 content increased with increasing W/B ratio, in contrast, CO content decreased. This phenomenon might be explained by reaction Eqs. (1) and (2). Higher water concentration moves the equilibrium of the reaction (1) and (2) towards the CO2 formation, which resulted in an increase of H2 and CO2 and decreased CO content. However, high W/B also results in the decrease of hydrogen yield because that the adsorption of H2O molecular will occupy the most of the active sites of the catalyst surface [18], which, as a result, lead to the less bio-oil conversion to H2. As shown in Fig. 8, under consideration of hydrogen yield and content, the optimal W/B ratio is 4.9."
9,Comparison of self-prepared catalyst and commercial catalysts,"3.5 Comparison of self-prepared catalyst and commercial catalysts Fig. 9 shows the hydrogen yield affected by the reaction temperature for self-prepared Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 (12 wt% Ni, 7.5 wt% Ce) catalyst and commercial nickel-based catalysts (Z417). As the reaction temperature increased from 450 °C to 800 °C, the hydrogen yields via two kinds of catalysts increased. In the above-mentioned reaction temperature range, the hydrogen yield of self-prepared catalyst was higher than the commercial catalyst, which indicated that the self-prepared catalyst had better catalytic activity. Table 3 shows content of the product gas at the same conditions (T = 800 °C, W/B = 4.9) for the self-prepared Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 (12 wt% Ni, 7.5 wt% Ce) catalyst and commercial nickel-based catalysts (Z417). The H2 content via self-prepared catalyst was higher than the commercial catalyst, in contrast, the content of CO, CH4 and CO2 were lower. The comparison of the long-time stability tests on the Ni/CeO2/ZrO2 and Z417 catalysts for bio-oil steam reforming is shown in Fig. 10 . The two catalysts deactivated at the initial stage. A steady H2 yield of 25% was obtained over Z417 after about 100 min, while a H2 yield of 32% leveled off after the first 50 min of time for the Ni/CeO2/ZrO2 catalyst. From Figs. 9 and 10, we can say that the stabilities and the activity of the self-prepared Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 (12 wt% Ni, 7.5 wt% Ce) catalyst are superior to those of Z417."
10,Conclusion,"Based on the experimental results, the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst had superior catalytic activity for hydrogen production by steam reforming of bio-oil as compared to commercial nickel-based catalyst (Z417). The reaction temperature and W/B had profound effects on the hydrogen yield and content of the product gas. At T = 800 °C and W/B = 4.9, the hydrogen yield and content reached the maximum value of 69.7% and 61.9% respectively in the range of experimental temperature over the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 (12 wt% Ni, 7.5 wt% Ce) catalyst, which were higher than those of the commercial nickel-based catalysts (Z417). Thus, it was a promising catalyst for hydrogen production from bio-oil aqueous fraction steam reforming."
