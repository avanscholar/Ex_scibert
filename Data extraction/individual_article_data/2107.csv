0,Introduction,"Ways to lower the energy consumption of the bioprocess and improve the efficiency of substrate utilization are urgently sought for industrial production of biological hydrogen from various kinds of biomass [1,2]. Experts have conducted many studies aimed at achieving the goal of using less substrate to produce more biological hydrogen in a shorter time. The most commonly used methods include knocking out the key enzyme of a competing metabolic pathway or the negative regulators [3–5], optimizing the fermentation parameters [6], and overexpressing the positive regulators [7–11]. Metabolic engineering has been proved to be an effective way to enhance production of a variety of targets [12,13]. Using this strategy, the carbon and energy flows of hydrogen production can be altered to realize a highly efficient metabolic pathway. Knock-out of particular genes on the chromosome is one of the most commonly used methods of metabolic engineering [5]. Previous studies showed that mutant strains with hycA encoding formate hydrogen lyase repressor, hybO encoding uptake hydrogenase, or ldh encoding lactate dehydrogenase deleted can generate more hydrogen than the wild strain [3,4]. Manipulation of various cofactors has been regarded as an efficacious metabolic engineering means to achieve the expected purpose because they play pivotal roles in extensive metabolic reactions in cells. Against this background, a new concept of “cofactor engineering” was proposed by Berrious-Rivera et al. [14–16]. It is well known that coenzymes often exert important regulating effects on the oxidation–reduction reaction. Cofactor engineering focuses on the control of coenzymes related to the desired production. Therefore, only by enhancing the activity of the target biological reaction can we get a satisfactory result. Generally, the first step in this approach is to ascertain the specific reaction related to the coenzyme in the metabolic pathway. Then, the concentration of the coenzyme or the proportions of different forms of the coenzyme are varied by genetic engineering to regulate the metabolic pathway. A few studies have thus far been done on cofactor engineering, in particular on NAD(P)(H) which, as an important coenzyme, has been attracting increasing attention [10,12,14–18]. Studies have found that two completely different hydrogen production pathways exist in Enterobacter aerogenes. One is the formate hydrogen production pathway, which depends on formate decomposition by formate hydrogen lyase (FHL). Its mechanism is similar to that in Escherichia coli. The other is the NADH-dependent hydrogen production pathway, which involves re-oxidation of NAD [19]. The NADH pathway of hydrogen production in E. aerogenes has been investigated by researchers over the past 30 years. Shigeharu et al. studied the relationship between the yield of hydrogen from glucose in E. aerogenes and the pH of the culture. The thermodynamic analysis suggested that NADH was catalyzed to hydrogen and a membrane-bound hydrogenase participated in this reaction [20]. Analysis of the metabolites formed during hydrogen fermentation by E. aerogenes showed that the yield of H2 generated through the formate pathway can be calculated by the following equation [3]: V h = V e + V a − V f where V h is the amount of hydrogen produced through the formate pathway, V e is the amount of ethanol, V a is the amount of acetate, and V f is the amount of formate. It can be clearly seen from the above equation that V h should not exceed the sum of V e and V a. But previous studies indicated that the total H2 yield was significantly greater than the sum of V e and V a, suggesting that there is another pathway to hydrogen production in E. aerogenes. It was hypothesized that hydrogen was also generated from excess NADH via ferredoxin-NADH oxidoreductase. In order to confirm this hypothesis, researchers disrupted the cells of E. aerogenes and found that NADH supported H2 formation in an extract of E. aerogenes and the hydrogenase was localized to the inside surface of the cell membrane [19]. Hence, two catalytic modules constitute the NADH pathway. An NADH oxidase located in the outer membrane catalyzes NADH to NAD+ and e-. The electrons generated in the first step are then transported to protons by a hydrogenase located in the inner membrane to form hydrogen. The extracellular and intracellular concentrations of NADH and NAD+ and the ratio of [NADH] to [NAD+] can influence the yield of hydrogen in E. aerogenes. This hypothesis was directly supported by the improvement in hydrogen yield upon addition of extracellular NADH and NAD+ to E. aerogenes cultures [21]. Studies were carried out based on this result to enhance the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes, and further demonstrated the presence of a NADH pathway [3,4,8,21–23]. All of the studies showed that the concentrations and ratio of [NADH] to [NAD+] are key factors in hydrogen production of E. aerogenes [13]. Elucidating the mechanism of the NADH pathway was a key breakthrough in establishing the complicated metabolic network of hydrogen production [22]. However, so far, there have been few reports concerning altering the NADH/NAD+ status by genetic modification in E. aerogenes, and the details of this biocatalytic process also need to be further clarified. In this study, the effect of increasing the total intracellular NAD(H) pool on hydrogen production in E. aerogenes was investigated. The nadE gene was cloned and overexpressed in E. aerogenes-O. In addition, the succinate pathway, a competitive pathway of hydrogen production, was inhibited to improve the hydrogen yield by deleting the ppc gene. These two different genetic cofactor manipulation strategies were performed individually or synchronously, and three mutants were obtained. The objectives were to examine the effects of NAD synthetase and PEPC on hydrogen production metabolism, and to analyze the distribution of carbon resources under chemostat and anaerobic batch fermentation. The chemostat experiments were performed and the concentrations of NAD(H/+) and metabolites were determined. Batch fermentations and metabolic analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of multi-gene manipulations on hydrogen production and the mechanism of the synergistic effect of these strategies. Moreover, the total NADH utilization rate and the NADH utilization rate directly related to hydrogen production were analyzed in order to obtain a deeper understanding the effect of availability of NADH on hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Strains, vectors, and culture media","2.1 Strains, vectors, and culture media E. aerogenes CCTCC AB91102 was purchased from the China Center for Type Culture Collection of Wuhan University, Wuhan, P. R. China. The recombined strain AB91102-O was obtained through the method of Zhao HX et al. [3]. The fermentation medium for hydrogen production contained (per liter): glucose, 15 g; tryptone, 4 g; yeast extract, 3 g; AlK(SO4)2, 0.01 g; N(CH2COOH)3, 4 g; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.06 g; H3BO3, 0.02 g; NaCl, 2.5 g; CaCl2, 0.02 g; Na2MoO4, 0.02 g; MnSO4·7H2O, 0.03 g; CoCl2, 0.1 g; K2HPO4, 1 g; MgCl2, 0.5 g. 1 L inoculum medium and screening medium contained tryptone 10 g, yeast extract 5 g, and NaCl 10 g (Luria–Bertani medium, LB). Kanamycin (50 μg/mL) and gentamycin (50 μg/mL) were added to the LB medium to select positive transformants and recombinants. The strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table 1 , and the primers for PCR amplification are listed in Table 2 ."
3,Genetic manipulation,"2.2 Genetic manipulation The disruption of chromosomal genes of E. aerogenes was performed using the Red recombinase system of Datsenko and Wanner [24]. The gentamycin gene aacC1 was cloned from plasmid pJQ200 and ligated into pKD46 to construct pKD46-GM. The recombinant plasmid pKD46-GM was used for promoting the homologous recombination of linear DNA and the target gene. The FRT-flanked Kmr gene was cloned using a pair of primers containing 41 nucleotide homology extensions to the target gene ppc and using plasmid pKD13 as a template. The FLP helper plasmid was used to remove the antibiotic resistance gene. Primer pairs, ppc-H1P1/ppc-H2P4, were used for inactivation of the ppc gene. The coding sequence of the ppc gene was completely knocked out. The PCR verification of the chromosome was used to identify the disruption of the ppc gene by the primer pairs p1/p4 and ppc-U/ppc-L."
4,Overexpression of NAD synthetase,"2.3 Overexpression of NAD synthetase The plasmid pET-28kan was constructed to express homologous protein in E. aerogenes using the modification method of Zheng et al. [25]. The promoter T7 was replaced by the promoter Pkan, which was cloned from the kanamycin resistance gene in the plasmid pET-28a. The promoter Pkan is a constitutive promoter, and a resistance test confirmed the activity of Pkan in E. aerogenes. The gene nadE was integrated into plasmid pET-28kan by the following steps. The gene nadE was amplified by PCR using primers nadE-fw and nadE-rv from the chromosome of E. aerogenes. The EcoR I/Hind III fragment of the nadE gene from the chromosome was inserted into the EcoR I and Hind III site of vector pET-28kan to create pET-28kan-nadE. The nadE gene fragment was placed under the control of Pkan. The plasmid pET-28kan-nadE was first transformed into E. coli Top 10 for amplification. The resultant strain, E. coli/pET-28kan-nadE, was kanamycin (kan) and chloramphenicol (CM) resistant. Then, the amplified plasmid pET-28kan-nadE was electro-transformed into AB91102-O and AB91102-OP to generate AB91102-O/pET-28kan-nadE and AB91102-OP/pET-28kan-nadE, respectively."
5,Anaerobic chemostat experiments,"2.4 Anaerobic chemostat experiments Single colonies of the mutants and the wild strain were cultivated on 5 mL of LB medium with the addition of kanamycin (50 μg/mL) (AB91102-OP/N, AB91102-OC, and AB91102-O/N), gentamycin (50 μg/mL) (AB91102-OP), and ampicillin (50 μg/mL) (wild strain). These pre-cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C and 100 μL of each 5-mL culture were used to inoculate 50 mL of LB in a shake flask with the appropriate antibiotics. These cultures were grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm for 8–10 h, and then were used to inoculate a 3-L anaerobic bioreactor. A 3-L bioreactor (Baoxing Co., Shanghai, China) was used for anaerobic chemostat experiments at a dilution rate of 0.25 h−1. It initially contained 2.0 L of LB medium supplemented with 15 g/L of glucose. To establish anaerobic conditions, the medium was flushed with nitrogen gas through a sterilized filter (Midisart 2000, Sartorius, GER) for 0.5 h after autoclaving. The bioreactor was run for 10 h during the anaerobic batch stage, and then was switched to the continuous culture mode. The working volume, pH, temperature, and agitation were maintained at 1.8 L, 6.5, 37 °C, and 250 rpm, respectively. Samples were taken during the steady-state phase, which was obtained after 5 residence times."
6,Anaerobic batch fermentation experiments,"2.5 Anaerobic batch fermentation experiments The anaerobic batch fermentation experiments were performed using 150-mL bottles fitted with rubber stoppers. Each bottle contained 70 mL of fermentation medium and was inoculated with LB overnight seeding culture at an inoculum size of 10% (v/v). The headspace air and trace amounts of oxygen in the fermentation medium were displaced by nitrogen gas to ensure anaerobic conditions, and the batch fermentations were carried out in a magnetic stirring thermostatic water bath at 37 °C and 250 rpm for 18 h."
7,SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis,"2.6 SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis The recombinant strain AB91102-O/pET-28kan-nadE was cultured overnight in seed medium LB containing two antibiotics (50 μg/mL kanamycin and 40 μg/mL chloramphenicol) in an anaerobic environment. Harvested bacteria were all inoculated into 1 L of LB medium without antibiotics. After 8 h shaking culture, the cells were then centrifuged (12,000× g and 4 °C for 10 min) and lysed in a high-pressure cell disruption system (One Shot Model, Constant systems, UK). The lysates were centrifuged (12,000× g and 4 °C for 10 min) and the supernatants were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was used to confirm the homologous overexpression of the recombinant protein with anti-His tag polyclonal antibody."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods The cell density during cultivation was measured by a spectrophotometer (Mapada UV-1800PC, China) at 600 nm (OD600). Dry cell weight was estimated as DCW (g/L) = 0.337 × OD600 based on previous experiments on this strain. The total volume of the gas produced by the anaerobic shaking flask culture was measured via a measuring bottle and the volume of the 3-L fermentor was measured by the water displacement method. 2.7.1Gas composition The composition of the gas was measured using a gas chromatography system (FULI GC-9750, China) with a packed column (2.0 mml .D. 200 mml, carboxen-1004, 80–100 mesh) and a TCD detector. The working temperatures of the detector and the column were 60 °C and 110 °C, respectively. 2.7.2Metabolites The analyses of glucose, succinate, acetate, formate, 2,3-butanediol, lactate, and ethanol were carried out using a high performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC) (SSI Model 2300-525, USA) equipped with a sulfonated polystyrene divinyl benzene column (BioRad Aminex HPX-87H, USA) and a refractive index detector. 10 mmol/L sulfuric acid was used as the mobile phase. The column temperature was 55 °C and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. 2.7.3NADH/NAD+ assay The steady-state cells were harvested by centrifugation (12,000× g and 4 °C for 10 min) and cell extracts and supernatants were obtained by the same method as in “Materials and methods 2.6”. The Fluorimetric NAD/NADH Assay Kit (Amplite, Tianjin Sungene Biotech Co., Led., China) was used for quantifying NAD/NADH in cell extracts. The fluorescence increase was monitored with a fluorescence plate reader (Flexstation 3, Molecular Devices, USA). All steps were performed under anaerobic conditions. Enzyme activities assay The cells were cultured for 4 h in fermentation medium under anaerobic conditions and harvested by centrifugation (12,000× g and 4 °C for 10 min). Cell extracts and supernatants were obtained by the same method as in “Materials and methods 2.6”. NADH-dependent enzymes catalyzed NADH to NAD+. This approach allows the enzyme activities to be measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of NADH (ε 340 = 6.3 mM−1 cm−1) via a spectrophotometer (Mapada UV-1800PC, China). Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) activity was assayed via a reaction system containing 1.0 mL of 0.1 M imidazol-HCl (pH 6.7), 0.7 mL of 10 mM NADH, 1.5 mL of 0.5 mM acetaldehyde, and 0.3 mL of cell lysate supernatant at 30 °C [5]. The assays of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.127) and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDDH; EC 1.1.1.76) activities were similar to that of ADH, except that 0.5 mM acetaldehyde was substituted by 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM acetoin, respectively. All steps were performed under anaerobic conditions."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Knocking out of ppc gene of E. aerogenes,"3.1 Knocking out of ppc gene of E. aerogenes A pair of PCR degenerate primers (Ea-ppc-fw and Ea-ppc-rv) was designed according to the conserved regions of the ppc gene as published in GenBank. Using the total E. aerogenes CCTCC AB91102 chromosomal DNA as a template, a 2652-bp fragment of full-length ppc gene was successfully obtained by PCR amplification with primer pairs Ea-ppc-fw/Ea-ppc-rv. Subsequent DNA sequencing revealed that the fragment shared significant similarity with the respective ppc genes obtained from various hydrogen-producing bacterial species, such as E. aerogenes KCTC 2190, Klebsiella pneumoniae KCTC 2242, Klebsiella variicola At-22, and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044. PCR products were generated with a pair of 59-nt-long primers that included 39-nt homology extensions and 20-nt priming sequences using pKD13 as a template. The 1.4-Kb PCR products were purified and treated with Dpn I, and then transformed into bacteria carrying the Red helper plasmid. Tens of gentamycin resistance (GmR) transformants were obtained, and then were verified using primer pairs of p1/p4 and Eappc-fw/Eappc-rv with approximately 1.4-Kb PCR products. In contrast, the PCR product was about 2.6 Kb in size when the wild strain chromosome was used as template with primer pair Eappc-fw/Eappc-rv as specific primers. The PCR product of the test primers p1/p4 confirmed the success of homologous recombination, and the positive transformant deleted ppc gene was termed as AB91102-OP. As shown in Table 3 , under anaerobic chemostat fermentation, the concentrations of succinate for AB91102-OP and AB91102-OP/N were 0.017 and 0.012 mol/mol glucose, respectively. These results were much lower than that of the wild strain (0.184 mol/mol glucose). This demonstrated that the ppc gene was completely knocked out of the genome of the wild E. aerogenes strain by the Red recombinase system. It also suggested that the ppc gene was one of the key enzymes of the succinate pathway in E. aerogenes, similar to that of E. coli [10]. However, a small amount of succinate production was observed in the mutant strain, which was probably due to the existence of pck gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), an isoenzyme of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) that also catalyzes the generation of oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate. When the ppc gene was deleted, PEPC activity could be supplemented by PEPCK in the mutant strain, though PEPCK has a much lower specific activity towards oxaloacetate compared with PEPC. In addition, another succinate production pathway in E. aerogenes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), was almost blocked under strictly anaerobic conditions."
11,Overexpression of the NAD synthetase in E. aerogenes,"3.2 Overexpression of the NAD synthetase in E. aerogenes The nadE gene was cloned from E. aerogenes CCTCC AB91102, sub-cloned to the plasmid pET-28kan, and controlled by the kanamycin promoter. The resulting plasmid, pET-28kan-nadE, was further identified by Bgl II/EcoR I double digestion, and confirmed to be successfully constructed for homologous expression of NAD synthetase in AB91102-O. The overexpression of NAD synthetase in AB91102-O was proven by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis."
12,Anaerobic chemostat experiments,"3.3 Anaerobic chemostat experiments Anaerobic chemostat experiments were performed with strains AB91102-OP, AB91102-O/N, AB91102-OP/N, AB91102-OC, and the wild strain to determine the concentrations of NADH and NAD+. The chemostat mode precluded the effects of different specific growth rates of the strains, and the concentrations of NADH and NAD+ could be correctly detected under steady-state conditions. Fig. 1 presents the changes in NADH/NAD+ concentrations and the NADH/NAD+ ratios after knocking out the ppc gene and overexpressing NAD synthetase, individually or synchronously. The results show a sharp increase in the NAD(H) pool when NAD synthetase was overexpressed. The total NADH/NAD+ concentrations of AB91102-ON and AB01102-OP/N increased by 91% and 109%, respectively, with reference to the control strain, AB91102-OC. But the ratios of NADH to NAD+ decreased from 1.11 to 0.83 (AB91102-ON) and 0.94 (AB01102-OP/N). The decreases in the NADH/NAD+ ratios were caused by overexpression of NAD synthetase, which is encoded by nadE gene and directly catalyzes the formation of NAD+. This led to greater increases in the NAD+ levels in comparison to those of NADH. These experiments revealed that overexpression of NAD synthetase improved the total levels of NAD and affected the NADH/NAD+ ratio, while these two parameters were not significantly changed by disrupting the ppc gene. In order to investigate the effect of increasing the total NAD levels on the distribution of the metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations in the anaerobic chemostat cultivations were analyzed (Table 3). The glucose uptake of strain AB91102-O/N increased by more than 31% compared with AB91102-OC, while that of AB91102-OC changed only slightly in comparison to the wild strain. The quantity of NADH produced by glycolysis was positively correlated with the glucose uptake (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, theoretically, the quantities of metabolic intermediates also increased with the increment of NADH induced by overexpression of NAD synthetase. The experimental results showed that the steady-state concentrations of metabolites changed significantly depending on the quantities of glucose uptake. However, the metabolic products per mole of glucose consumed changed only slightly in these experiments. This suggested that the total levels of NAD(H) and the NADH/NAD+ ratio were not determinant factors limiting the metabolite distribution under chemostat conditions. Previous studies showed that the intracellular availability of NADH played a primary role in the distribution of metabolites. The NADH utilization rate in these experiments can be expressed by the following formula [16]: ( NADH ) U /Glu = ( 2 × succinate + lactate + 2 × ethanol + 2 , 3 - butanediol + hydrogen produced by NADH pathway ) /glucose consumed Fig. 1 shows that the (NAHD)U/Glu ratio of these strains changed slightly under chemostat culture conditions. The results explain why the distribution of metabolites did not change significantly upon overexpression of NAD synthetase in these experiments. The metabolic rates and the specific growth rates of the strains were fixed by limiting the nutrients under steady-state conditions. In previous studies, researchers added external NADH to the fermentation medium to increase the intracellular concentration of NADH in E. aerogenes, and the yield of hydrogen decreased under chemostat conditions but increased in batch experiments [21]. Therefore, the effects of increased total levels of the NAD(H) pool under chemostat culture conditions may differ from the results under batch culture conditions. Blockage of the succinate pathway, which consumes NADH, may not only alter the carbon metabolic flux distribution but may also affect the metabolic intermediate reactions involving reduction by NADH owing to the loss of NADH-consuming pathways. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects on hydrogen production of enhancing the concentration of NADH and decreasing NADH consumption to modify carbon flux under batch conditions."
13,Anaerobic batch fermentation experiments,"3.4 Anaerobic batch fermentation experiments Anaerobic batch fermentation experiments were performed with the strains AB91102-OP, AB91102-O/N, AB91102-OP/N, AB91102-OC, and the wild strain in 150-mL anaerobic bottles to investigate the effects on metabolic patterns of knocking out the ppc gene and overexpressing NAD synthetase, individually or synchronously. Fig. 3 shows the glucose consumed, cell densities, and the concentrations of anaerobic metabolites, including hydrogen, succinate, 2,3-butanediol, lactate, formate, acetate, ethanol, CO2, and EtAc. The mechanism of enhanced hydrogen production by the mutants and the synergistic effect of the two strategies were investigated through metabolic analysis. This showed that formate was completely broken down to H2 and CO2 during anaerobic batch fermentation by E. aerogenes. Therefore, hydrogen production from the formate pathway can be expressed by the following formula: Hydrogen from formate pathway = formate consumed = acetate + ethanol (the cleavage of pyruvate produced equimolar formate and acetyl-CoA, which was further converted into acetate or ethanol) (Fig. 2). Therefore, hydrogen production from the formate pathway was positively correlated with the yield of ethanol, and the NADH utilization rate directly related to hydrogen production can be expressed as follows: ( NADH ) UH /Glu = ( hydrogen from NADH pathway ) + 2 × ethanol ) /glucose consumed In order to learn more about the effect of NADH availability on hydrogen production, analysis was carried out on the total NADH utilization rate (see Table 3: (NADH)U/Glu) and the NADH utilization rate directly related to hydrogen production (see Fig. 4 : (NADH)UH/Glu). Overexpression of NAD synthetase led to a significant change in hydrogen yield per mole of glucose consumed, which increased by 66% compared with AB91102-OC. Moreover, significant increases in the concentrations of succinate (22%) and ethanol (93%) as well as decreases in lactate (30%), 2,3-butanediol (14%), and acetate (50%) production were observed (Fig. 3). The metabolic distribution pattern was very different from the chemostat experiments, and the low NADH/NAD+ ratio caused by overexpression of NAD synthetase was usually not considered conducive to hydrogen production [9,13]. The glucose uptake improved by 59% in AB91102-ON, which confirmed that a low NADH/NAD+ ratio could enhance glucose utilization [26]. Therefore, more NAD+ was reduced to NADH and regeneration of NADH was promoted by glycolysis. The extra NADH converted from NAD+ was partly consumed through the hydrogen production pathway to maintain the intracellular redox balance and NAD+ regeneration. The results confirmed that hydrogen produced from the NADH pathway increased significantly in AB91102-ON (Fig. 5 ). A previous study suggested that NAD+ regeneration tended to the faster pathways when reducing equivalents were excessive [16], and the results of these experiments showed that the pathways that need more NADH were promoted when the concentration of NADH increased. Fig. 6 shows that the specific activities of NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDDH) of NAD-synthetase-overexpressed strains were decreased by approximately 60% and 45%, respectively, but the specific activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was increased about 2.8-fold. It is also worth noting that the succinate and ethanol pathways need two NADH molecules but the lactate and 2,3-butanediol pathways need only one NADH molecule in E. aerogenes. Thus, the first two pathways were enhanced in nadE-overexpressed strains. The metabolic analysis results showed that hydrogen from the formate pathway increased by 16% in AB91102-ON (Fig. 5) and the increase in ethanol production explained why hydrogen from the formate pathway increased in NAD-synthetase-overexpressed mutants. On the other hand, the results showed that succinate production decreased by 92% in AB91102-OP compared with AB91102-OC and the wild strain. Meanwhile, this was accompanied by increases in lactate (9%), 2,3-butanediol (60%), acetate (58%), formate (31%, acetate + ethanol; consumed completely), and ethanol (7%) (Fig. 3). Therefore, the carbon flux was altered through repression of the succinate production pathway, resulting in the formation of other products. Simultaneously, the total hydrogen yield increased by 36.2% compared with AB91102-O, and the yield through the formate pathway alone increased by 19.6%. As shown in Fig. 4, it is interesting to note that the (NADH)U/Glu ratio decreased by 5%, but hydrogen produced through the NADH pathway increased by 77.9% in AB91102-OP (Fig. 5). Previous studies showed that enhancing the NADH availability promoted hydrogen production [4,5]. The unusual results of this study may be due to blockage of the succinate pathway, which is a faster NADH-consuming route [16], and a decreased NADH consumption rate, leading to a reduction in total NADH availability. At the same time, regeneration of NAD+ from NADH was limited, and the reduction of NADH consumption enhanced the excess of reducing equivalents and the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Therefore, hydrogen production was consequently improved. It is worth noting that the (NADH)UH/Glu ratio increased by 30.6%. This also suggests that the (NADH)UH/Glu ratio more accurately reflects the effect of NADH on hydrogen production than the total NADH availability (NADH)U/Glu. The maximum yield of 2.89 mol H2/mol glucose (Fig. 3) and 230 mM (Fig. 7 ) was obtained from AB91102-OP/N, suggesting that these three strategies have a positive synergistic effect on hydrogen production. Our previous experiments showed that not all multi-gene manipulations could achieve positive results in enhancing hydrogen production in E. aerogenes. Actually, a low NADH/NAD+ ratio due to overexpression of NAD synthetase and a decrease in NADH availability due to PEPC repression were not conducive to hydrogen production [13]. Although the total hydrogen yield was improved by increasing the glucose uptake and the metabolic fluxes were redirected, these repressive factors still exist in strains AB91102-ON and AB91102-OP. However, combining these two strategies could provide a compensating effect against the repressive factors. Furthermore, blockage of the succinate pathway, which constitutes a competitive branch route for hydrogen production and can be improved by NAD-synthetase-overexpression, would produce a beneficial effect in AB91102-ON and also lead to a redirection of the carbon flux to H2 production."
14,Conclusion,"This paper demonstrates that overexpressing NAD synthetase and knocking out the ppc gene can improve the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes CCTCC AB91102. The two strategies employed together could engender a positive synergistic effect on hydrogen production, and the synergism is due to inactivation of the succinate production pathway, the only beneficial competitive branch route for hydrogen production in NAD synthetase overexpressing strains. Metabolite analysis suggests that overexpression of NAD synthetase can increase the NAD(H) pool and decrease the NADH/NAD+ ratio in chemostat experiments, and a significant increase in NAD+ leads to enhanced glucose uptake in batch experiments. The high efficiency of substrate utilization improved the availability of NADH and is conducive to a high level of hydrogen production. This study contributes to clarifying the mechanism of the complicated NADH hydrogen production pathway metabolic network and benefits future industrialization of the technology."
