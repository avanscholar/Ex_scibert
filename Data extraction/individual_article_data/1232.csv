0,Introduction,"Bacterial infections are the major problems associated with the management of non-healing wounds and the use of medical devices. Bacterial multiplication at the wound surface has been reported to result in a prolonged inflammatory response which delays the collagen synthesis, epithelialisation and cause extensive tissue damage [1]. At the same time, the medical device related bacterial diseases generally include ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, and surgery-associated infections [2]. Common bacterial agents of these infections include the Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3]. Biofilm formation by these organisms alarmingly challenges the treatment regime. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH), more than 80 % of bacterial infections are caused by biofilm formers [4,5]. As this causes a serious threat to the public health, methods to introduce antimicrobial surface and thereby to prevent bacterial attachment is very important. In recent years, polymer-based antimicrobial coatings have been widely studied for its application to prevent microbial infections. Among the polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is preferred, as it is a semi-crystalline, water-soluble, and biodegradable polymer with biocompatible nature. The PVA has been used for food packaging, medical, and other industrial applications [6–8]. Even though, PVA has low mechanical and microbial barrier properties, engineering it with the antimicrobial metabolites like lipopeptides can make the polymer to have an active surface suitable for the biomedical applications. The lipopeptides (LPs) are non-toxic, biocompatible, and highly stable biomolecules with applications in the medical, food, and other sectors [9]. Several companies have reported the use of LPs of surfactin derivatives in various dermatological formulations and also in cosmetics due to their bioactive properties. These are also described to have stimulatory effects on the production of collagen and elastin free radical scavenging and antimicrobial properties. In addition, the LPs have antifungal, antiadhesive, antiviral [10], anticancer and antiparasitic [11] activities. Improvement of mechanical and antimicrobial properties of polymers is an absolute requirement to explore its biomedical applications. For the same, various nanofillers have been widely used, and the nano-engineered polymer surface generated here can expect to have improved properties. Hence, both the antimicrobial efficacy and the material barrier properties can be introduced to the polymer scaffolds through the incorporation of nanoparticles.Among the nanoparticles used for polymer engineering, the zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are unique due to their non-toxic and biocompatible nature. Also, zinc oxide is included under the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) category as per the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [12]. In a previous study, PVA incorporated with the starch/chitosan, and zinc oxide nanoparticles has been reported to provide antibacterial property to the wound dressing material [13]. PVA functionalized with the polydopamine modified ZnONPs and sericin has also been reported to have antimicrobial properties with the potential application in wound dressing and tissue engineering [14]. The blending of sericin, PVA, and ZnONPs has also been reported to result in the generation of cytocompatible antimicrobial sponges [15]. These studies indicate the immense scope with engineering PVA using antimicrobial metabolites and nanoparticles to strengthen its applications in the biomedical sector. In the current study, the PVA based nanocomposite films were prepared by incorporating ZnONPs and LPs and the films were found to have desirable features for biomedical applications."
1,Materials and methods,"Polyvinyl alcohol with a molecular weight of 60,000 to 1, 25,000 Da was purchased from the Himedia, Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, Bengaluru, India. ZnONPs (50 wt. % in water) were procured from the Sigma Aldrich. The Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa used in this study were obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection, Chandigarh, India. The column chromatographically purified and characterized lipopeptides (surfactin and iturin) containing fractions from the large-scale culture of Bacillus subtilis Dcl1 obtained from our previous study was used as the source of lipopeptides (LPs) [16]."
2,Antibacterial activity analysis,"2.1 Antibacterial activity analysis The antibacterial activity of LPs containing extract and ZnONPs against the biofilm-forming S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa was analyzed on Mueller Hinton Agar plates (MHA) by well diffusion method. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) were further determined against the selected bacteria by 96 well microtiter plate assay as per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [17]. For this, 100 μL of Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) was added into the wells of the microtiter plate followed by the addition of 100 μL of LPs or ZnONPs. Then it was serially diluted up to the 10th well and followed by the addition of 100 μL (turbidity adjusted) of selected microorganisms into the wells from 1 to 11. Bacterial suspension in the 11th well served as the positive control whereas the MHB served as the negative control (12th well). It was further incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, 30 μL of resazurin dye was added into each well and further incubated for 2−4 h for the colour change. After the incubation period, those wells with no colour change were scored as above the MIC values. For the determination of the MBC, 10 μL from the wells with concentrations higher than the MIC value was plated directly on to the MHA. The MBC value was determined from the plates where there was no colony formation. The tolerance level of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa against the LPs was also calculated as per the previously reported method [18]."
3,Preparation of nanocomposite films,"2.2 Preparation of nanocomposite films For the preparation of the PVA (P) film, 1.2 g of PVA was dissolved in 40 mL of distilled water followed by the stirring at 80 °C for 4 h. The transparent solution was then poured on to a sterile glass Petri dish. This was further kept for incubation at 60 °C for 8 h in a hot air oven. The dried film was then peeled off and was stored in a neat plastic bag for characterization. PVA-zinc oxide nanoparticles (PZ) film was prepared by adding 100 μL (50 wt. % in water) of ZnONPs into the PVA solution followed by mixing for 30 min. PVA -lipopeptide containing extract (PB) based film was prepared by the addition of 100 μL of LPs extract into the PVA solution. PVA, ZnONPs, and LPs containing (PZB) film was prepared by adding 100 μL of LPs containing extract and 100 μL of ZnONPs into the PVA solution. The solutions obtained in all the cases were casted on sterile glass Petri dishes and processed as described above."
4,Characterization of developed films,
5,Thickness and mechanical properties,"3.1 Thickness and mechanical properties The thickness of the developed films was analyzed by using an electronic micrometer with 1 μm precision. The mechanical properties of the films such as Young’s modulus (YM), tensile strength (TS), and elongation at break (EB) were analyzed by using the Tinius Olsen H50 KT Universal Testing machine following the ASTM D 882 standard [19]."
6,"FT-IR, SEM, UV–vis absorption analysis and TGA","3.2 FT-IR, SEM, UV–vis absorption analysis and TGA The functional groups present in the nanocomposite membranes were determined by using Shimadzu IR Prestige 2 FT-IR Spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR). The measurements were taken in the range of 4000 – 450 cm−1 with a scan rate of 4 cm−1. The surface morphology of films was recorded using the scanning electron microscope (SEM), (Joel JSM 6390 L V, Tokyo, Japan). The films were further characterized by using the UV–vis spectrometer, (Shimadzu UV 2600) in the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm for the confirmation of ZnONPs. The thermal properties of the films were analyzed by using Mettler Thermogravimetric analyzer under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and temperature range of 30–750 °C."
7,Hydro-dynamic analysis of films,"3.3 Hydro-dynamic analysis of films The water absorption capacity (WAC) of the films was analyzed by recording the initial dry weight of 2 × 2 cm2 film samples followed by immersion in tubes containing distilled water (5 mL). After 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 h, the films were taken and wiped to remove the excess water. Then the weight of the sample was taken and the percentage WAC was calculated as per the previous report [19]. For analyzing the film solubility (FS), 2 × 2 cm2 samples were taken and dried for 24 h at 60 °C and the initial dry weight was determined. Then, the films were immersed in 30 mL of distilled water for 24 h followed by weighing after drying for 24 h at 100 °C [20]. The water holding capacity of the films was analyzed by weighing 2 × 2 cm2 films followed by the immersion in distilled water (10 mL). The film samples were removed after 2 min and the weight was noted. For the moisture content analysis, 2 × 2 cm2 films were cut and measured their weight. Then it was dried for 24 h at 105 °C in a hot air oven. After this, dry weight was recorded and from this, the percentage moisture content was calculated."
8,Dressing pH,"3.4 Dressing pH For this, the samples of 2 × 2 cm2 size of P, PB, PZ and PZB films were immersed in normal saline solution separately. After reaching the equilibrium condition, all the film samples were removed from the saline solution and the remaining solution was used to determine the pH using a pH meter [21]."
9,Hemocompatibility test,"3.5 Hemocompatibility test The hemocompatibility of the films was analyzed by immersing the film samples of 1 × 1 cm2 size in a test tube containing 4 mL of 0.9 % saline at 37 °C for 30 min to attain the equilibrium condition. The fresh anticoagulated blood was then prepared by the addition of acid citrate dextrose solution (ACD, 1 mL) into the human blood (9 mL). Then, 200 μL of the diluted blood sample was added into the test tube followed by incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. The positive control (100 % hemolysis) was prepared by the addition of 200 μL of ACD blood into 4 mL of distilled water. While the negative control was prepared by the addition of 200 μL of ACD blood into 4 mL saline solution (0% hemolysis) [22]."
10,Antibacterial activity analysis of nanocomposite films,"3.6 Antibacterial activity analysis of nanocomposite films The antibacterial activity of film samples was analyzed against the S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa by the liquid culture method. Here, circular discs of 20 mm diameter were initially UV sterilized for 15 min. The discs were then immersed in 10 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) in separate tubes. Then, 100 μL of bacterial inoculum (∼108 CFU/mL) was added into each tube followed by the incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. Further, 1 mL of sample was withdrawn from each test tube and serially diluted with Maximum Recovery Diluent Media. This was then finally spread plated on to Tryptic soy agar plates followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h [23]."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Antimicrobial properties of lipopeptides and zinc oxide nanoparticles,"4.1 Antimicrobial properties of lipopeptides and zinc oxide nanoparticles The antimicrobial activity of the LPs against S. aureus has resulted in a zone of inhibition of 20 mm and the same against the K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were 44 and 49 mm respectively (Fig.1 ). The MIC of the LPs was found to be 6.25 μg/μL for S. aureus and 3.125 μg/μL for both the K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. The MBC of LPs was 25 μg/μL for S. aureus and 12.5 μg/μL for both the K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. The observed antibacterial activity could be due to the electrostatic interaction of LPs onto the bacterial membrane with the subsequent disruption of cell membrane [24]. The antibacterial activity of ZnONPs has resulted in a zone of inhibition of 15 mm for S. aureus, 15 mm for K. pneumoniae and 20 mm for P. aeruginosa. The MIC of ZnONPs against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa was 50 μg/μL and the MBC was 100 μg/μL. ZnONPs were previously described as non-toxic antimicrobials with effectiveness against both Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They execute the antimicrobial action by the disruption of the cell membrane. These can also induce the production of reactive oxygen species which could damage the lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and DNA of pathogens [25]. These nanoparticles have also been reported to have inhibitory effect on biofilm of pathogenic bacteria [26]. In the study, the tolerance ratio of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa against the LPs was found to be 4. The same for these organisms against the ZnONPs was 2. A compound can be bacteriostatic, when its MBC/MIC ratio is ≥ 16. When the value is ≤ 4, it can have bactericidal activity. The bactericidal effect of LPs selected in the study could be attributed to the presence of surfactin and iturin compounds. Several studies have already been reported the activity of LPs against the Staphylococcus aureus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium [27–29]."
13,Appearance of nanocomposite films,"4.2 Appearance of nanocomposite films The surface of P film was found to be flexible and transparent as depicted in Fig. 2 . The addition of LPs has caused a decrease in the transparency of membrane without affecting its flexibility and smoothness. With the addition of ZnONPs and ZnONPs with LPs, the transparency of film was found to get decreased without any change in the flexibility and texture. The observed reduction in the transparency of films was also in accordance with the previous result reported for the ZnONPs doped PVA film [30]. Here, the observed changes could be due to the presence of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix."
14,Characterization of films,
15,FT-IR,"5.1 FT-IR From the FT-IR spectra, the intramolecular hydrogen bonding that is responsible for the stretching vibrations of OH groups could be observed at 3277 cm-1 for the P film ( Fig. 3 ). The peak observed at 1417 cm-1 could be attributed to the CH2 vibrations. The stretching vibration of C–H bonds of PVA could be attributed to the peaks at the 920 and 842 cm−1. The peak at 1141 cm−1 corresponded to the CC or CO stretching mode of polymer chain with the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the two neighbouring OH groups and was in good agreement with the previous report [31]. In the PVA neat film, the high intensity band at 2918 cm−1 might be attributed to the CH2 stretching with the shoulder peak at 2852 cm-1 as an indication of the C–H stretching. These peaks in all other films could be observed to be shifted to lower intensity with higher wave number due to the specific interactions. In the case of PB film, the same was shifted to 2941 and 2862 cm−1. For the PZ film, the CH2 stretching was observed at 2939 cm−1 and the C–H stretching at 2862 cm−1. The same for PZB was observed at 2937 and 2858 cm−1. The CO stretching vibrations could be attributed to the peak at 1089 cm-1 for the PVA neat film [32,33]. The intensity of this peak was found to get decreased in the nanoparticles incorporated films such as the PZ and PZB and it might be due to the specific interaction of the nanoparticles with the PVA matrix. The same in the LPs incorporated PB film was observed to get shifted towards a lower wave number of 1087 cm-1. For PB and PZB samples, the peak 3286 cm−1 further indicated the presence of NH stretching of carbon containing compound with lipopeptidic nature [33]. The carbon hydrogen stretching vibrations of lipid acyl chains could be attributed to the peak present in the 2855 to 2957 cm−1 range [34]. From these, the presence of LPs in the PZB film could be confirmed. The decrease in the intensity and the shifting of peak from 1417 cm−1 to 1415 cm−1 as observed with PB, PZ and PZB films when compared with the P film could be due to the decoupling of vibrations caused by the interaction of additives with the PVA matrix. This indicated the specific interactions in the polymer matrix occurred with the addition of ZnONPs and LPs. The spectral peak observed around 702 cm−1 in PZ and PZB films could be attributed to the ZnONPs stretching vibration as per the previous report [35]."
16,SEM,"5.2 SEM The surface morphology of the fabricated films was analyzed by the SEM (Fig.4 ). Here, the P film was found to have a smooth and uniform surface. This was in accordance with the previous report by Mathew et al. [36]. In the PZ and PZB films, the ZnONPs were observed to get finely dispersed without any agglomeration as indicated in the SEM micrograph. This observation was in accordance with the fine dispersion of ZnONPs reported for the PVA/ ZnONPs based nanocomposite films in a previous study [37]. The fine distribution of ZnONPs in the nanocomposite membrane could be due to the proper mixing during the film making process."
17,UV–vis absorption analysis,"5.3 UV–vis absorption analysis In the study, the transparency of the PVA neat film was found to be very high with a T600 value of 86.88 ± 0.8. This value showed a slight decrease in the case of LPs and ZnONPs incorporated PZB film and here the T600 value was 78.90 ± 0.5. The T280 value for the PVA neat film was 66.60 ± 0.7 and the same was found to get decreased to 43.41 ± 0.6 for the PZB film. This could be due to the blocking of light by the nanoparticles without sacrificing the transparency value [38,39]. The absorption peak at 258 nm for the nanoparticles incorporated PZ film confirmed the presence of ZnONPs [40] (Fig.5 ). The PZB film also confirmed the presence of ZnONPs due to the absorption peak observed in the range of 258 nm."
18,TGA,"5.4 TGA The thermal stability of the films developed in the study was also analyzed as depicted in Fig.6 . The first weight loss occurred between 50 and 150 °C in the thermogram of all the films could be ascribed to the loss of the adsorbed water molecules. The nanocomposite membrane showed an increase in the initial decomposition temperature (106 °C) than the neat PVA film (94.09 °C). The incorporation of ZnONPs has previously been suggested to decrease the moisture absorption due to its bonding with the OH groups of PVA [41]. This might have resulted in the decreased moisture absorption by the nanocomposite films and thereby the improved thermal stability. Addition of ZnONPs to the polyvinyl alcohol/pluronic has also been reported to enhance the thermal stability of films [30,42]. Here, the ZnONPs might have restricted the motion of polymer chains to result in the decreased weight loss by acting as the thermal insulator or barrier. This can also expect to be the reason for the delayed decomposition process as described previously [43]. In the study, the second major weight loss was observed at the 250–400 °C range and might be due to the decomposition of the PVA [44]. The third stage decomposition observed in the 450 °C range could be due to the decomposition of ZnONPs. In a previous study, the chitosan/PVA nanocomposites with the incorporated ZnONPs has also been described to have similar result [42]. The observed thermal properties of the films developed in the study suggest its potential to be applied as the antimicrobial coatings."
19,Thickness and mechanical properties of nanocomposite films,"5.5 Thickness and mechanical properties of nanocomposite films The physical interaction and chemical composition of both the polymer and additive can have determining effect on the thickness of nanocomposite films. The thickness of nanocomposite films developed in the study was found to be in the range of 0.1 to 0.16 mm (Table 1 ). The increase in the thickness of films could be due to the presence of additives or nanoparticles in the films [45]. The observed results of the study were in good agreement with previous report [46]. In the study, the tensile strength of PZB film (32 ± 2.1 MPa) was found to get enhanced when compared with that of the neat PVA (11.4 ± 2.5 MPa) and other films. The increased tensile strength observed for the nanocomposite film could be due to the formation of strong intermolecular and ionic interactions between the nanoparticles and PVA matrix [47]. The Young’s modulus for the PVA neat film was 320 ± 3.2 MPa and was enhanced to 1540 ± 3.3 MPa for the PZB film. The addition of ZnONPs and LPs and their specific interactions might be the reasons for the increased Young’s modulus. The increased adhesion of nanofiller with the polymer matrix by strong molecular interactions has previously been suggested to enhance the tensile strength and Young’s modulus [48,49]. The reinforcement of polyvinyl alcohol based films with the ZnONPs has also been demonstrated to increase the tensile strength and Young’s modulus and decrease the elongation at break in the previous studies [50,51]. In the current study, the elongation at break for the P film was 230 % and was decreased to 90.2 % for the PZB film. This could mechanistically be due to the rigid nature of the added nanoparticles which might have immobilized the polymer. The strong interfacial interactions due to the higher surface area and surface energy of nanofillers have also been suggested to enhance the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite films [52]."
20,Hydro-dynamic analysis of films,"5.6 Hydro-dynamic analysis of films For preventing the dehydration of tissues and also for the protection of wound, an ideal wound dressing material should absorb certain level of water [53]. Hence, all the developed films were subjected to water barrier analysis. The moisture content (MC) of the PVA neat film developed in the study was found to be 17.21 %. However, the addition of ZnONPs and LPs was found to cause the reduction of MC to 10 % (Fig. 7 a). The solubility of films also showed a similar trend like that of the MC. The solubility of the nanocomposite film (PZB) was found to be 8.3 % and that of neat PVA was 27.9 % (Fig. 7b). Also, the percentage water absorption capacity of the pure PVA film was 498.8 and it got reduced to 72.4 for the PZB film (Fig. 7c). The WHC percentage of the PVA film was 72.06 % and the same for the PZB film was only 16.61 % (Fig. 7d). The changed water barrier properties of the PZB film could be due to the tortuous pathway generated by the ZnONPs that might have narrowed the pore channels. The resulting increased diffusion path length of the polymer matrix might have contributed to the improved water barrier properties as per the previous report [46]."
21,Dressing pH,"5.7 Dressing pH As the dressing pH accelerates the fibroblast proliferation, it has an important role in the control of infections at the wound site. In the study, the pH of the developed films was found to be in the range of 4.2–6.8 ( Fig. 8 ). When compared with the neutral and alkaline environments, slightly acidic environment is considered to be desirable for the wound dressing material for the better healing. Here, the pH of developed nanocomposite films was in accordance with that of commercially available wound care products [54]."
22,Hemocompatibility analysis,"5.8 Hemocompatibility analysis Due to the electrolytic environment of human vascular system, hemocompatibility of materials used for the clinical application is highly desirable [55]. According to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F 756−00 standard, the wound care materials can be of three types. The materials with percentage hemolysis below 2 are considered to be non- hemolytic, those with a value above 5 are haemolytic and those exhibit values between 2 and 5 are considered as slightly hemolytic. In this study, hemolysis percentage analysis of all the developed films was found to be below 2 ( Fig. 9 ). The results were in good agreement with the percentage hemolysis reported for the chitosan bentonite nanocomposite films [21,56]. Hence, the bionanocomposite developed in the study is highly compatible for clinical applications."
23,Antimicrobial activity of films,"5.9 Antimicrobial activity of films The conductive environment provided by the wounded surface generally promotes the growth of bacteria which delays the wound healing process. Here, the PVA film did not exhibit any antimicrobial activity. The PZ film showed slight decrease in the microbial count than the control PVA film. However, the PB and PZB films showed significant antibacterial activity against the selected bacterial pathogens ( Fig. 10 ). Several studies have already been reported the ability of bionanocomposite films to attack the bacterial membrane resulting in the increased permeability and leakage of cytoplasmic contents [57]. In the current study also, the incorporated LPs might have acted through the above-mentioned mechanisms as observed from the bactericidal result of tolerance test. Many studies have already been reported the antimicrobial properties of polymer based films incorporated with ZnONPs against S. aureus, B. atrophaeus, B. cereus, E. coli, and C. albicans [58–60]. Hence, the developed nanocomposite membrane (PZB) with enhanced antimicrobial, optical, mechanical, thermal and water barrier properties along with the hemocompatible nature could be suitable for the biomedical applications."
24,Conclusion,"The infections by the biofilm forming bacteria can cause severe threat to the public health due to its antimicrobial resistance and hyper-virulence. The study resulted in the development of PVA nanocomposite membrane incorporated with ZnONPs and LPs by the solvent casting method. The developed membranes were characterized by FT-IR, SEM, UV–vis spectroscopy, TGA and mechanical analysis. The lipopeptide incorporated membranes such as the PB and PZB films were found to have enhanced antimicrobial activity against the S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. In addition to this, the developed membranes were also found to be hemocompatible along with pH similar to the skin. Hence by considering all the improved properties, the developed PZB membrane could be a promising material to be applied as an antimicrobial coating for the biomedical applications."
