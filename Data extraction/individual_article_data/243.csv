0,Introduction,"The continuous increase of industrialization and urbanization caused severe environmental pollution while over-exploited fossil fuels caused an energy crisis which became overriding issues all over the world. Organics as health risky pollutants are continuously released to the environment from industrial and agriculture products which have severely polluted the water and environment. Additionally, industrial wastewater is frequently contaminating the freshwater. Thus, industrial and agricultural sources discharge pollutants continuously to freshwater which normally contains extremely toxic, non-degradable and carcinogenic contaminants that may cause accumulative poisoning, nervous system damage and cancer [1,2]. Water pollution fetched by all types of contaminants is a big risk to human health. It causes irreversible hazards to human and aquatic life. So, the world is highly concerned about water pollution and this problem can be controlled by wastewater treatment using low cost and environmentally friendly processing techniques [3–6]. Similarly, hydrogen generation has newly fascinated global interest because of high global energy demand. Since, hydrogen is a clean, recyclable, eco-friendly and generous source of energy, therefore, it received considerable attention. On the other hand, the continuous decrease in fossil fuels and their resources makes vital the research efforts for production and searching of renewable and clean energy. Retorting to global energy demand, researchers have raised efforts for searching renewable energy sources. Hydrogen is the perfect substitution of conventional fossil fuels with zero-emission and is thought out to be an attractive “energy carrier” for extenuating energy crises [7–11]. Therefore, environment-friendly techniques for environmental remediation and hydrogen generation are highly required to find a simple approach for water purification and energy generation. Among different approaches, photocatalysis is a straightforward, efficient, competitive and eco-friendly tool for water purification and hydrogen generation. The high efficiency, specificity, simplicity and selectivity of photocatalysis make it a more attractive and alternative approach to degrade pollutants and generate hydrogen feasibly. Photocatalysis has been largely used as a green and effective way in different fields such as energy generation, photocatalytic degradation of various pollutants, reduction of carbon dioxide, solar cells, storage, and microbial monitoring [12]. Photocatalysis is basically an advanced method where oxidation process takes place at the surface of photocatalyst under light and degrade pollutants in water, produce hydrogen (H2) from water, generate electricity from solar light, and produce fuels by reducing carbon dioxide, and has the ability to resolve aforementioned issues. Photocatalysis is a visible light-driven process where solar light effectively stimulates the separation of electron–hole pairs and boost the oxidation and reduction ability of the photocatalyst. Therefore, effective photocatalysts are required which can easily generate electron–hole pairs upon irradiation of solar light and encourage the catalytic activity toward efficient degradation and hydrogen production with a low cost and greener approach. Recently, scientists are also trying to develop efficient catalysts at a large scale by low cost and simple methods that could be an alternative cheap and effective system toward efficient degradation and hydrogen production with a low cost and greener approach [13–16]. Different metal-based nanocomposites, metal oxides, metal sulfides and doped metal oxides have been prepared in the attempt of searching for an efficient and low-cost photocatalyst at a large scale. Among various developed single-phase metal oxides, TiO2, WO3 and ZnO are active photocatalysts [17–20]. However, these photocatalysts only absorb UV light and inspire photocatalysis in the presence of only UV light. The solar spectrum consists of 5% of UV light and therefore most of the photocatalysts cannot perform well under sun light. However, to get the full benefit of a vast source of available solar light consisting of 46% of visible light, we need to develop an efficient and low-cost photocatalyst that can encourage photocatalysis under visible light. Hence, the development of active solar photocatalyst that can initiate and encourage photocatalysis in the visible regions become an urgent demand for environmentalists to degrade toxic pollutants for living being's safety. For this purpose, several attempts have been made to tune the absorption range of single-phase semiconductor to the visible region of the solar spectrum by doping with various metals and preparing heterostructure metal oxides [21]. Recent research has shown that the dopant and heterojunction can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers, and greatly increase the active sites of photocatalytic reaction on the surface of materials, thus improving the photocatalytic performance of composite photocatalysts [22,23]. Semiconductor nanostructures based solar-driven photocatalyst has fascinated high attentions as effective materials for water splitting as well as photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Fabrication of heterostructure metal oxides is recognized as a potential way of preparing solar photocatalysts which can enhance solar-driven photocatalytic hydrogen generation as well as photocatalytic degradation and these inter-embedded heterostructure photocatalysts exhibit superior photocatalytic property. Normally the addition of metal or metal oxide as a doping agent to other nanomaterials to construct heterostructure enhancing the surface defects of nanomaterials, also swing the optical absorption towards the visible region, trap the excited electrons from a metal oxide, thus slow down or reduce the (e−/h+) recombination and leave the holes for the solar-driven photocatalytic degradation as well as photocatalytic hydrogen generation which perform as a key function in the photocatalytic activities of photocatalysts. Photocatalytic degradation and water splitting largely depends on light absorption, charge transfer, and surface reaction [24,25]. Tin and iron oxides have a wide bandgap and widely used as photocatalysts which exhibit effective photocatalytic activity only under UV light. To overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks of single oxides, Fe was doped with tin oxide (SnO2) to prepare heterostructure photocatalyst by doping technique to swing the optical absorption towards the visible region and increase the photocatalytic activity of SnO2. Since doped heterostructure photocatalysts are recognized as significant materials that absorb in the visible region, promote photocatalytic activity under solar light and this procedure is very effective for the modifications of photocatalysts [26,27]. Herein, we synthesized Fe-SnO2 composite photocatalyst and then utilized it as a heterostructure photocatalyst to investigate its good photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. Fe-SnO2 exhibited excellent performance and showed high efficiency as a photocatalyst for both photocatalytic hydrogen production and photocatalytic removal of pollutants."

Analytic grade potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium sulphide, sodium sulfite, and dyes from BDH Chemicals, Poole, England. All solutions were prepared in deionized water obtained from the departmental Millipore-Q water purification system."
3,Synthesis of Fe-SnO2,"2.2 Synthesis of Fe-SnO2 Iron and tin salts were dissolved in water to prepare 0.1 M solutions of each precursor. Both the solutions were mixed and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, 0.5 M solution of NaOH was slowly added to the mixed metal salt solution which raised the pH of mixed solution to 10. The mixed solution with pH 10 was kept on stirring at 60 °C and after 10 h, the precipitate was washed three times. The washed product was dried in an oven at 50 °C and further calcined at 500 °C."
4,Characterization of Fe-SnO2,"2.3 Characterization of Fe-SnO2 Transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM2100F) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM, JSM7600F, JEOL, Japan) images were taken and analyzed to evaluate the morphology of Fe-SnO2. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) equipped with FESEM was used to determine the elemental composition of the sample. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to assess and recognize the crystal structure of the material. The material composition and functional groups were assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), respectively. Photo-degradation performance of Fe-SnO2 was assessed by analyzing the dye solutions during photodegradation using UV–visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Evolution 300)."
5,Photocatalytic activity toward dyes degradation,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity toward dyes degradation The photocatalytic ability of Fe-SnO2 was investigated toward different dyes. In the beginning, 150 mg of Fe-SnO2 powder was added to 100 mL of 0.065 mM of different dyes in a conical flask. The flask was kept on a stirring plate under sun light. During the course of photocatalytic reaction, 3 mL of dye sample was taken and measured UV–visible spectrum before and after each 5 min interval. The photocatalytic performance of the catalyst toward different dyes was calculated using the following equation [28]: (1) P e r c e n t a g e d e g r a d a t i o n = A o − A t A o × 100 A o represent the initial absorbance of dye at λ max and the A t is the absorbance of dye at an instantaneous interval of time. Equation can also write as follow: (2) P e r c e n t a g e deg r a d a t i o n = C o − C t C o × 100 C o represents the initial concentration while and C t represents concentration at time t (C o = Ao and Ct = At )."
6,Photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen production,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen production The photocatalytic performance of the prepared photocatalyst Fe-SnO2 was carried out in a reaction tube (100 cm3, pyrex) containing 20 mg photocatalyst and 10 mL of various solutions containing water: alcohol (1:1 by volume) mixed solvents such as water:methanol (HM), water:ethanol (HE), water:propanol (HP), KOH and combine solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 (0.1 M and 0.02 M) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out under xenon tubular bulb (400 W) and sunlight (34 °C) irradiation for 2 h. The gas evolved during the reaction was noted every 5 min till 30 min after that from 30 min to 60 min every 10 min and from 1 h to 2 h, reading was taken after every 30 min. Firstly, we tested our catalyst against solvents like HM, HE, HP and a mixture of Na2S and Na2SO3 in artificial light to observe the best possible solvent for the production of the higher amount of gas. Among these solvents, we selected HM and mix solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 for our experiments. We tested these two solvents in the dark as well as in the sunlight to check their productivity. Apart from this, we also tested these solvents in artificial and sunlight without using the photocatalyst. We checked the recyclability of photocatalyst against Na2S and Na2SO3. In comparison to water which was taken in a graduated cylinder to observe the amount of gas production, we replace it with concentrated NaOH (10 M) solution. We also have done some experiments having KOH as a solvent with different concentrations (1.0 M, 0.75 M and 0.10 M) in sunlight with and without the catalyst."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physicochemical characterization of Fe-SnO2,"3.1 Physicochemical characterization of Fe-SnO2 Since heterostructure metal oxides are playing an important performance as photocatalysts, we have selected iron-doped tin heterostructure metal oxide and utilized it as a solar photocatalyst for the catalytic degradation of organic pollutants and production of hydrogen. Therefore, Fe-SnO2 was prepared, characterized and tested as a solar photocatalyst for the degradation of dyes and production of hydrogen and exhibited excellent catalytic behavior toward dyes degradation and hydrogen production. TEM image (Fig. 1 ) shows that Fe-SnO2 has a cube-like structure with a size less than 1 μm. The cube-like structure contains nanosized particles. These nanosized particles get aggregated together to give a cube-like structure. The surface morphology of Fe-SnO2 is further characterized by FESEM. The morphology of the prepared Fe-SnO2 was evaluated from FESEM images which are shown in Fig. 2 . The left side is a low-magnification image while the right side is a high-magnification image. These left and right-side images indicate the cube shape morphology of Fe-SnO2. These cubes are self-possessed of particles. The Fe-SnO2 cubes have an average size of 500 nm while the particles constructed the cubes have an average size of ±25 nm. FESEM images evidently specify that Fe-SnO2 is fundamentally built of nanoparticles having a large surface area which further aggregates and give cubes structure. The composition of Fe-SnO2 was investigated by the EDS spectrum as revealed in Fig. 3 . EDS results confirm the presence of iron, tin and oxygen. The peaks for iron (Fe), tin (Sn), oxygen (O) and platinum (Pt) have appeared in the EDS spectrum. Fe, Sn, O have appeared from Fe-SnO2 while Pt peak appeared due to platinum sputtering used for coating of Fe-SnO2. Therefore, EDS recommended that the prepared material is pure Fe-SnO2 which possesses Fe, Sn, and O where Fe and Sn have a weight % composition of 1:3. The EDS element mapping images in Fig. 4 indicate the uniform distribution of Fe, Sn and O in Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. However, there is a difference in the quantity of each element such as Fe, Sn and O. Sn and O have more dense mapping images as compared to Fe which is due to the presence of high quantities of these elements in Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. The FESEM-EDS elemental mapping shows that all the elements are almost uniformly distributed throughout the whole region, indicating a homogeneous composition achieved in Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. EDS spectrum and mapping showed that the chemical components of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst are Fe, Sn and O. This demonstrated that only Fe, Sn and O exist in Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst without any other impurity. Also, Pt was observed in EDS elemental mapping which came from Pt sputtering. Fig. 5 (a) represents XRD pattern of Fe-SnO2 which indicate the presence of rutile-type crystalline SnO2. The diffraction peaks are well-matched with the literature [7,29–31]. The diffraction peaks pattern of Fe-SnO2 was assigned to the crystalline phase of SnO2 which gives a structure. There are total ten diffraction lines in XRD pattern which appeared at 26.9, 34.7, 38.6, 52.7, 57.8, 62.5, 64.2, 66.1, 72.3, 75.5, and 78.1 which could be indexed to (110), (101), (200), (211), (301), and (321) [7,29–31]. There is no extra peak related to Fe which recommends the intercalation of Fe ions inside the SnO2 crystalline structure possibly substituting Sn ions. The broadness in the SnO2 diffraction lines propose the assimilation of Fe2+ into SnO2 and Fe2+ influenced particular disorder that causes a reduction in crystallite size and changes the compositional heterogeneity. The ionic radius of Fe2+ is smaller than Sn4+ and consequently Fe+2 insert inside SnO2 lattice and cause contraction lattice and peaks broadening. Particle size also affects lattice expansion and the decrease in particle size causes lattice expansion due to the generation of a huge number of defects. Lattice strain and change in crystallite size cause peak broadening [7,29–31]. The line broadening of rutile-type SnO2 without any iron peaks recommend that the prepared material is Fe doped SnO2 (Fe-SnO2). Further ATR-FTIR was analyzed to confirm the functional groups present in Fe-SnO2. ATR-FTIR spectrum (Fig. 5b) exhibits the main peak which confirms the presence of metal oxide group (M = O) at around 538 cm−1. The M = O peak in the ATR-FTIR spectrum at around 538 cm−1 clearly designates the synthesis of Fe-SnO2. Moreover, the ATR-FTIR spectrum of Fe-SnO2 showed O-H stretching and bending peaks. Further, the ATR-FTIR spectrum was matched with the literature and confirm the synthesis of Fe-SnO2 [7,29]. The elemental composition of Fe-SnO2 was realized from XPS analysis. The Fe-SnO2 spectrum showed intense peaks for Sn 3d, Fe 2p and O 1s as shown in high-resolution core-level spectra Fig. 6. Sn 3d peaks appeared at 486.0 eV and 494.6 eV which correspond to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2. Similarly, XPS spectrum showed a peak at 716.1 eV which could be assigned to Fe 2p while the peak appeared at 530.1 eV is responsible for O 1s [7]. Figure 7 shows the UV–visible spectrum of Fe-SnO2 which gives a broad absorption band at 500 nm and the calculated band gap (Eg) is 1.6 eV (Tauc’s equation). The optical property with a narrowed band gap confirms that Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst is optically and photocatalytically active. The photocatalytic activity of a catalyst depends on its band gap and optical property. Since Fe-SnO2 showed narrow band gap and thus Fe-SnO2 will absorb visible light and will apparently enhance visible light response and high photocatalytic activity. Band gap energy of 2.48 eV was calculated for Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst by Eq. (3) using maximum absorption band. (3) E bg = 1240 λ ( eV ) Where E bg and λ is the band gap energy and wavelength (nm) of the Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst, respectively."
9,Photocatalytic activities of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst,"3.2 Photocatalytic activities of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst 3.2.1 Photocatalytic activities toward dyes degradation In recent times, numerous metal oxides-based nanomaterials were exploited as photocatalysts for the catalytic degradation of organic pollutants because of their high catalytic performance achieved through reduction or oxidation process [32]. These catalytic reductions and oxidation processes can be initiated by strong reducing agents like sodium borohydride and solar or UV light, respectively, using metal oxide nanomaterials as catalysts. Previously, different dyes and nitroaromatic compounds have been catalytically reduced and degraded using various metal oxides as nanocatalysts in the presence of either sodium borohydride or light [33,34]. However, in the present study, the catalytic degradation of the organic dyes was successfully performed under sunlight using Fe-SnO2 as a photocatalyst. Here, we selected two anionic CR, and MO dyes and a cationic ArO dye for catalytic degradation in order to investigate the catalytic activity of Fe-SnO2 under solar light. For photodegradation experiments, 0.065 mM solutions of each dye were prepared and 100 mL of the individual dye were charged into a reaction vessel containing 150 mg of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. The reaction vessel was initially kept under dark conditions for enough period of time to reach the adsorption equilibrium. The reaction vessel was then exposed to the visible light for the photodegradation process and the degradation process was started which resulted in the color change of solution. During the reaction period, 3 mL of the aliquot was taken, centrifuged and subjected to the UV–visible spectral measurements. The degradation of dye was evaluated by taking samples after a specific interval of time. The performance of Fe-SnO2 for pollutant degradation was calculated using Eq. (1). First of all, the reaction of CR was performed under dark conditions and the UV–visible spectra are shown in Fig. 8 (a) which clearly shows that the CR spectrum gives a broad peak at 496 nm and a similar broad peak was observed in earlier reports. The chemical structure of CR contains azo functional groups (-N=N-) which give an absorption peak in the UV–visible spectrum at 496 nm. Fig. 8(a) clearly shows that there is no significant loss in the dye concentration in the dark because there is no decrease in the intensity of the broad peak at 496 nm. UV absorption clearly indicates that there is no decrease in the intensity of CR peak at 496 nm and thus it is clarifying that the reaction is dependent on the visible light. Without light, there is no reaction and thus no decrease in the intensity of CR peak. Further, we tested the reaction under solar light without Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. It clearly showed that the CR concentration is not decreasing without nanocatalyst and thus no decrease in the intensity of the broad peak of CR at 496 nm and thus the reaction depends on the nanocatalyst. Without nanocatalyst, there is no reaction and thus no decrease in the intensity of CR peak. In the next experiment, the reaction was tested under solar light in the presence of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst and UV–visible spectra recorded are shown in Fig. 8(b) which clearly shows the reduction in the peak intensity at 496 nm with the passage of time and this decrease in the intensity of the peak at 496 nm was due to photodegradation of the CR molecules by the Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. To study the catalytic activity of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst for different dyes, anionic and cationic dyes such as CR, MO and ArO were selected. Their catalytic degradation reactions were performed in the presence of Fe-SnO2 under solar light (Fig. 8(b-d)). The same procedure was adopted for all the dyes and the results were compared for optimization. The maximum absorbance wavelength for CR, MO and ArO was 496 nm, 461 nm and 465 nm, respectively. UV–visible spectra recorded for each dye clearly indicate that Fe-SnO2 can degrade all the dyes under solar light as the intensities of all dyes peaks decreases with time. The reduction of peak intensity with time indicates photodegradation of the dyes by Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst under solar light. It is clear from the UV–visible spectra (Figs. 8 and 9 ) that the reduction in the CR peak is fast as compared to ArO and MO which indicates that Fe-SnO2 degraded CR most efficiently as compared to other cationic and anionic dyes under solar light. The CR absorption band disappeared in 30 min which indicates that Fe-SnO2 can completely degrade CR under solar light. While the other dyes could not completely degrade even in 60 min. The degradation % of different dyes is plotted in Fig. 9 where CR was degraded to about 95% in 30 min, while 41% and 17% of the photodegradation were achieved for the MO and ArO under visible light conditions, respectively (Fig. 9). The kinetic behavior of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst toward the photodegradation of dyes was studied and followed a pseudo-first-order rate, as given in the equation below: (4) l n C t / C o = l n A t / A o − K t where Ct is the concentration of dye, which is equal to the absorbance value at the designated time and Co is the absorbance at the time (t) = 0. K is the rate constant of the reaction and was measured by the linear fitting of ln Ct/Co versus t. The plot of ln Ct/Co as a function of time of dye by Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst (Fig. 9d). The rate constants for CR, MO and ArO photodegradation by Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst were found to be 0.09293 min−1, 0.00492 min−1 and 0.00316 min−1, respectively. Moreover, it was observed during the experiments that CR was photodegraded up to a high extent by the Fe-SnO2 among the three tested organic pollutant dyes. This behavior suggests that Fe-SnO2 is a more selective and good choice for the degradation of CR. Thus, we selected CR for the detailed study. As the amount of catalyst plays an important role in photocatalysis, therefore, we further extended our experiments towards the degradation of CR by using a different dosage of catalyst. The effect of catalyst concentration on the reaction rate was studied and for the optimization, the reaction was performed using three different amounts (0.5 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL and 1.5 mg/mL) of Fe-SnO2 for the degradation of 0.065 mM aqueous solution of CR pollutant under visible light conditions (Fig. 10 ). It clearly shows that the rate of degradation increases with an increasing amount of catalyst. The intensity of the UV–visible spectra decrease very fast in case of 1.5 mg/mL as compared to 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL. Further, the peak absorption intensity values of CR treated with different amounts of Fe-SnO2 (Fig. 11 ) were plotted against time for comparison because absorption values represent the concentration of the corresponding dye molecules in their aqueous solution. A decrease in concentrations was found and there was a continuous decrease in absorption of CR with respect to time. However, it was observed from Fig. 11 that the degradation of CR treated with 1.5 mg/mL was more efficient under the visible light as compared to 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL of Fe-SnO2. Fig. 11(d) shows that % degradation values (calculated by Eq. (1)) against time. It can be clearly observed that the high removal percentage was observed for CR using 1.5 mg/mL of Fe-SnO2 under the visible light which suggests that amount of Fe-SnO2 plays an important role in the photodegradation of CR pollutant. Fig. 11 clearly indicate that 95% of CR was degraded in 30 min using 1.5 mg/mL while l.0 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL took 40 min and 60 min to degrade 92% of CR dye. CR pollutant degradation took more than 60 min using Fe-SnO2 with a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. However, the time of degradation reduced to 30 min when the amount of catalyst was increased up to 1.5 mg/mL. So, this amount (1.5 mg/mL) was selected for further investigations. Further, the recyclability was investigated and found the outstanding property of Fe-SnO2 in recyclability and reusability for the multiple cycles. 1.5 mg/mL of Fe-SnO2 was initially used and then separated from the reaction media after completion of the reaction. After the filtration and separation, Fe-SnO2 was washed with distilled water, dried in an oven at 50 °C and reused again for the fresh run. Fe-SnO2 was used for three consecutive cycles and for each run, Fe-SnO2 was filtrated, separated, washed, dried and reused. Fig. 12 shows the C/Co (%) and K for three photodegradation cycles of CR pollutant. It is evident from Fig. 12 that CR pollutant was degraded in 30, 60 and 70 min up to 95, 91 and 91% with catalytic rate constant of 0.08748, 0.03903 and 0.03217 min−1 during 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle, respectively. The percentage of reduction of the CR was nearly constant for all the cycles, however, a decrease in the rate of the reaction was observed by the repeated use of the same Fe-SnO2. Similar results have been reported previously which supporting the fact that the reaction rate decreases slightly when utilizing nanocatalysts again and again, but this decrease is negligible. For large scale utilization, a filter was designed by adding Fe-SnO2 in a column like tube and the catalytic efficiency of Fe-SnO2 catalyst was checked in the column as a filter for photocatalytic degradation of CR pollutant. 10 mL of glass column was used and 30 mg of Fe-SnO2 was placed at the top of the cotton which is fixed at the bottom of the column. First, cotton was inserted and fitted at the bottom end of the column and then poured Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst on the top of cotton and filled the column. CR pollutant solution was poured into the tube and passes through the tube column in the presence of sunlight and collected in a beaker. For each run, 10 mL of CR pollutant of 0.065 mM was charged from the top of the column on the Fe-SnO2 packed column. The liquid flow time through the column was recorded by a stopwatch. The spectra of the pouring liquid and filtrate were recorded to determine the extent of photodegradation of CR pollutant. After each pass, the UV–visible was recorded and plotted as shown in Fig. 13 (a). There is a continuous decrease in concentration after passing the CR pollutant through the filter. After several runs, a clean water is obtained. This indicates that Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst can be used as a filter for water purification under sunlight. The targeted CR pollutant was degraded up to more than 95% in the 25th run by using a single pack of Fe-SnO2 catalyst as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, Fe-SnO2 catalyst-packed column could be effectively used for continuous degradation operations by eliminating the recovery process. The flow rate of CR pollutant was high therefore, the filter needs more run to degrade CR completely. But if the flow rate of CR pollutant become slow down, then Fe-SnO2 catalyst-packed column can degrade CR pollutant in one run. The photocatalytic activity of Fe-SnO2 was compared with other reported materials for degradation of dyes, as shown in Table 1 [35–39]. The mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation process of organic pollutant is schematically shown in Scheme 1 . Initially, Fe-SnO2 catalyst get absorb a photon of enough energy and excite an electron from valance band to conduction band and as a result cause generation of electron and positive hole in the conduction band and valance band [40,41]: F e − S n O 2 + h ν → e C B − + h V B + The electron in the excited state i.e in the conduction band cause ionosorption of the physically adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Fe-SnO2. ( O 2 ) a d s + e C B − → O 2 • − While the positive holes produce OH • radicals by neutralizing the hydroxyl group (OH−) to O H • and O 2 − • to H O 2 • . ( H 2 O ↔ O H − + H + ) + h V B + → O H • + H + H + + O 2 − • → H O 2 • Further formation of hydrogen peroxide (transient) and mutation of oxygen takes place. 2 H O 2 • → O 2 + H 2 O 2 Hydrogen peroxide decomposition and reduction of oxygen H 2 O 2 → O H − + O H • OH• cause oxidation of organic pollutants. O H • + R → O H + R • The positive holes also cause oxidation of organic pollutants. R + h V B + → R + • → d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s 3.2.2 Photocatalytic activities toward H2 production In recent times, numerous metal oxides-based nanomaterials were exploited as photocatalysts for H2 production under visible light because of their high catalytic performance in H2 production process. This catalytic process can be initiated by visible light using metal oxide nanomaterials as catalysts. Previously, different hydrogen sources have been used for hydrogen production using various metal oxides as nanocatalysts in the presence of light [42–44]. However, in the present study, the catalytic hydrogen productions were successfully performed under visible light using Fe-SnO2 as a photocatalyst. Here, we selected different water:alcohol mixed solvents such as HM, HE and HP and tested for hydrogen evolution reaction to check the feasibility for direct use of Fe-SnO2 as a photocatalyst in water oxidation under visible light. Fe-SnO2 was highly active and showed greater catalytic activity toward hydrogen productions while investigating the catalytic activity of Fe-SnO2 under visible light. For photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments, 10 mL of each mixed solvent such as HM, HE and HP was charged into a reaction vessel containing 20 mg of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. The reaction vessel was then exposed to the visible light for the photocatalytic hydrogen production process and measured the total gas (hydrogen and other possible gases) produced during the process. Fig. 14 shows the compared results which clearly shows that all the solvents used as a source produced hydrogen where the same procedure was adopted for all the solvents. Gas production recorded for each solvent clearly indicate that Fe-SnO2 can act as an efficient nanocatalyst for gas production from all the solvents under visible light. It is clear from Fig. 14(a) that the gas production in HM is fast as compared to HE and HP which indicates that Fe-SnO2 produced gas from HM most efficiently as compared to other solvents under visible light. The high amount of gas produced (18 mmol/g) from HM indicates that Fe-SnO2 is an efficient catalyst for HM under visible light while the amount of gas produced from HE and HP was lower (12 and 10 mmol/g) even took a long time. Further, a comparative graph is drawn which is shown in Fig. 14 where it was observed during the experiments that HM produces a gas up to high extent by the Fe-SnO2 among the three tested organic solvents. This behavior suggests that Fe-SnO2 is more selective and good choice for the production of H2 from HM. Thus, we selected HM for the detailed study. Further, to optimize the catalytic efficiency of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst for H2 production from HM, the photocatalytic gas production was studied in the presence of Fe-SnO2 under dark. The reaction vessel was kept under dark conditions for enough period of time and found that there is not produced any gas without light. The results of the reaction performed under the dark conditions is shown in Fig. 14(b). The reaction was monitored under dark condition up to 120 min. Fig. 14(b) clearly shows that there is no gas production in the dark and thus it is clarifying that the reaction in depend on the visible light. Without light, there is no reaction and thus no gas production. Further, we tested the reaction under solar light without Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. Fig. 14(b) clearly shows that there is little gas production and thus it is clarifying that the reaction depends on the nanocatalyst. Without nanocatalyst, there is a very slow reaction. In the next experiment, the reaction was tested under sunlight in the presence of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst and the total gas produced is shown in Fig. 14(b) which clearly shows that there is fast production of gas under sunlight as compared to visible light. Thus, the reaction under sunlight was more efficient as compared to visible light using Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. Additionally, in the present study, the catalytic hydrogen productions from KOH was also successfully performed under sunlight using Fe-SnO2 as a photocatalyst. Here, we selected different concentrations of KOH solution and tested for hydrogen evolution reaction in the presence of Fe-SnO2 under sunlight. For photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments, 10 mL of KOH was charged into a reaction vessel containing 20 mg of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. Fe-SnO2 was highly active and showed greater catalytic activity toward hydrogen productions from KOH while investigating the catalytic activity of Fe-SnO2 under solar light. The gas produced by different KOH concentrations are shown in Fig. 15 . It was observed that KOH concentration plays a significant role in the gas production process and the catalytic activity increases with an increase in KOH concentration. The highest amount of gas was produced by using 1.0 M KOH concentration and it was observed that Fe-SnO2 is displaying higher catalytic activity and exhibit excellent performance toward hydrogen production. The total gas achieved from different KOH solutions are 10, 13, 23, 28 mmol/g. Moreover, in the present study, the catalytic hydrogen productions from the combined solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 (0.1 M and 0.02 M) were also successfully performed under sunlight using Fe-SnO2 as a photocatalyst. Here, we selected different combined solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 (0.1 M and 0.02 M) and tested for hydrogen evolution reaction to check the feasibility for direct use of Fe-SnO2 as a photocatalyst under visible and sunlight. Fe-SnO2 was highly active and showed greater catalytic activity toward hydrogen production while investigating the catalytic activity of Fe-SnO2 under visible light. For photocatalytic hydrogen productions experiments, 10 mL of a combined solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 (0.1 M and 0.02 M) was charged into a reaction vessel containing 20 mg of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. The reaction vessel was then exposed to the visible light for the photocatalytic hydrogen production process and measured the total gas produced during the process. Gas production recorded clearly indicates that Fe-SnO2 can act as an efficient nanocatalyst for gas production from the combined solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 (0.1 M and 0.02 M) under visible light. Further, a comparative graph is drawn which is shown in Fig. 15 where it was observed during the experiments that the combined solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 (0.1 M and 0.02 M) produce gas up to a high extent by the Fe-SnO2. This behavior suggests that Fe-SnO2 is an efficient photocatalyst and a good choice for the production of H2. Further, to optimize the catalytic efficiency of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst for H2 production, photocatalytic gas production was studied in the presence of Fe-SnO2 under dark. The reaction vessel was kept under dark conditions for enough period of time and found that there is not produced any gas without light. The results of the reaction performed under the dark conditions are shown in Fig. 15. The reaction was monitored under dark conditions for up to 120 min. Fig. 15 clearly shows that there is no gas production in the dark and thus it is clarifying that the reaction depends on the visible light. Without light, there is no reaction and thus no gas production. Further, we tested the reaction under visible light without Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. Fig. 15 clearly shows that there is little gas production, and thus it is clarifying that the reaction depends on the nanocatalyst. Without nanocatalyst, there is a very slow reaction. In the next experiment, the reaction was tested under sunlight in the presence of Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst and the total gas produced is shown in Fig. 15 which clearly shows that there is fast production of gas under sunlight as compared to visible light. Thus, the reaction under sunlight was more efficient as compared to visible light using Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst. Fig. 15 clearly shows that the gas production rate is high under sunlight as compared to visible light, and thus it is clarifying that the reaction depends on the light intensity. As the amount of catalyst plays an important role in photocatalysis, therefore, we further extended our experiments towards hydrogen production by using different dosages of catalyst. The effect of catalyst amount on the reaction rate was studied and for the optimization, the reaction was performed using four different amounts (15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg and 30 mg) of Fe-SnO2 for the hydrogen production under visible light conditions (Fig. 16). It clearly shows that the rate of gas production increases with an increasing amount of catalyst. The total gas produced with different amount of Fe-SnO2 (Fig. 16) were plotted against time for comparison and an increase in the rate of gas production was found with an increase in the amount of catalyst as it is clear from Fig. 16 that the gas production was more efficient under the sunlight for 30 mg as compared to 15, 20 and 25 mg of Fe-SnO2. This suggests that amount of Fe-SnO2 plays an important role in photocatalytic gas production. Fig. 16 clearly indicates that 13 mmol/g of gas was produced in 10 min using 30 mg while the same amount of gas was produced in 20, 30 and 40 min using 25, 20 and 15 mg of Fe-SnO2 respectively. Thus, the time of gas production was reduced when the amount of catalyst was increased up to 30 mg. The water splitting is schematically shown in Scheme 1. The obtained data were compared with literature and summarize in Table 2 [45–49]."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a facile co-precipitation technique. The successful formation was confirmed by various instrumental techniques. Typically, TEM and FESEM showed the cube structure morphology of the synthesized nanocatalyst while the crystal structure was confirmed by XRD. Further structure characterization and bandgap energy were carried out by XPS, EDS, FTIR and UV–vis spectroscopy. Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst was used for the degradative removal of CR, MO and ArO dyes from their aqueous solutions and H2 production from aqueous solution of ethanol, methanol, propanol, KOH and combine solution of Na2S and Na2SO3. Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst was found to decolorize all the organic pollutants very efficiently, especially CR in aqueous solutions under visible light conditions. Further, Fe-SnO2 is a very efficient nanocatalyst for the production of H2 from methanol and Na2S and Na2SO3. In all the experiments, a small quantity of the Fe-SnO2 nanocatalyst was used by keeping in view the green protocol and optimized different parameters for very efficient removal of dyes removal as well as the production of H2."
