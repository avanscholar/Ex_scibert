0,Introduction,"As a renewable and worldwide available carbon source, biomass has caught considerable attention in the past several decades with the purpose to alleviate the concerns over fossil fuel depletion and associated environmental issues (Dai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Lignocellulosic biomass consisted of three main constituents: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which can be transformed into valuable fuels, platform chemicals, and other biobased products typically through biochemical or thermochemical methods. The biochemical technique has higher conversion efficiency and selectivity toward the desired products, however, it needs a long reaction duration, subsequent purification, and also usually suffers from feedstock specificity issue. By contrast, thermochemical pathways could accept multiple feedstocks and allow the efficient conversion over a relatively shorter duration, which has a lower overall cost and is regarded to be a promising route for biomass waste valorization (Wang et al., 2020b; Nallar and Wong, 2019; Yang et al., 2019). Fast pyrolysis, as one of the thermochemical processes, is a semi-commercially available technique for biomass conversion, and it usually occurs at a temperature of less than 700 °C under the environment of an inert gas. In 2015, Biomass Technology Group (BTG) constructed fast pyrolysis installations in the Netherlands with a designed feeding capacity of 5 t/h, and this unit could produce 22000 t/y of biocrude oil from woody biomass waste (Wang, 2017). However, owing to the diversity of multi-interactions during depolymerization, the biocrude oil/bio-oil produced from biomass fast pyrolysis has intricate compositions usually comprising several hundred compounds, the measured compounds of which include carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, aromatics, phenols and hydrocarbons with a high content of O-containing species that could be commonly identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (Talmadge et al., 2014; Eschenbacher et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020). Furthermore, studies showed that thousands of compound peaks could be observed by two-dimensional gas chromatography with time flight mass spectrometry (2D GC × GC-TOF/MS) detection of biocrude oil (Wang et al., 2020c). As a result, it largely remains a big challenge to commercialize the production of fine biochemicals and high-density biofuels from biomass, although significant researches have been extensively achieved on the basis of biobased model compounds (Prasomsri et al., 2014; Mortensen et al., 2013; Song et al., 2019). The biocrude oil could be divided into an aqueous phase (sugar/carbohydrate fraction) and a water-insoluble fraction by the addition of water. It is generally recognized that the aqueous phase comprising low-boiling acids, aldehydes, ketones, etc. originates from hemi-/cellulose, while the water-insoluble fraction (pyrolytic lignin) composed of phenolic compounds arises from biomass lignin fragment (Yin et al., 2018; Talmadge et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2021). And the aqueous phase is considered very reactive and prone to thermal poly-reaction in combination with the formation of coke/char during the upgrading (Yin et al., 2018; Wildschut et al., 2010), and it is usually applied in the production of fuels and chemicals through biochemical or chemocatalytic methods such as the aqueous phase reforming (APR) process over noble metals (Chen et al., 2015; Román-Leshkov et al., 2007; Alonso et al., 2010). By comparison, the water-insoluble fraction mainly contains the compounds with aromatic framework like phenolic monomers, oligomers, and multimers, which has the simpler composition and more stable properties structurally (Wang et al., 2019). In addition, the biomass lignin has the most abundant aromatic polymers in nature, with the phenolics especially the monomers and dimers derived from which have a tremendous potential application in polymer materials, gasoline additives, and transportation fuels (Chio et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021). Lots of studies including the “lignin-first biorefinery” approach have dedicated to the more generation of highly valuable chemicals especially the monomeric phenols and aromatic hydrocarbons/bio-BTX via biomass catalytic pyrolysis over selective catalysts, which is so-called selective catalysis aiming to boost the production of desired products and remove the oxygen in biocrude oil at the most extent (Renders et al., 2017; Abu-Omar et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015). Zeolites-based catalysts are one of the most broadly investigated materials for biomass catalytic pyrolysis due to their unique and controllable properties such as the topological textures, active sites, and acidity/basicity ratios, etc. (Liu et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2013). However, the formed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), highly reactive aldehydes, and so on could lead to the zeolite catalysts deactivation associated with large amounts of thermal coke deposition that is a very challenging issue causing the blockage of active sites as well as pores, and the oxygen is usually rejected as the H2O that may contribute to the dealumination under high-heat hydrothermal conditions resulting in instability of the catalyst structure even the complete framework collapse (Liu et al., 2014; Luna-Murillo et al., 2021; Iliopoulou et al., 2019). Alternatively, low-cost carbon catalysts that are generally derived from biomass, coal, and sewage sludge, etc., have received increasing attention involving the application in the biomass catalytic conversion especially towards the enhanced harvest of monomeric phenols and oxygen removal with more production of hydrocarbons (Wang et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2018). The modified carbons activated by H3PO4, H2SO4, and NH3, etc. that are often referred to as activated carbons have been investigated in the biomass catalytic conversion for the harvest of valuable biochemicals and gases (Chen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b). Compared to activated carbons, biochar can be regarded as a raw material given that it is not further treated or activated with any chemical or physical processes, so it usually holds lower activities and surface areas, etc. As thus, very few studies pay attention to the catalytic utilization of biochar involved in the thermochemical conversion of carbonaceous residues like biomass and waste plastics. However, raw biochar is still a potential and emerging carbon material for energy storage, conversion, and production, and also has several advantages over other catalysts such as much cheaper and simpler to manufacture, etc. Over the past years, many studies have reported that the biochar enables to provide great venues for catalytic pyrolysis of carbonaceous feedstock like biomass and plastic wastes towards more yield of hydrocarbons, phenolic monomers, and syngas (Zhu et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2016; Park et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021). The current work presents a low-cost and long-life biochar catalyst produced from a quite common agricultural biomass residue-corn stover, and targets to simplify the compositions of biocrude oil from cellulose catalytic pyrolysis by weakening the generation of reactive constituents such as carboxylic acids, saccharides, and furans, also in combination with the promoted formation of hydrogen and structurally more stable monomeric phenols."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials As an agricultural residue, corn stover was collected in a local farm at Pasco city (WA, USA), then ground to the fragments with the size of 2–4 mm. The cellulose powder was provided by Sigma with 50 μm of the particle size. To obtain the quantified content of cresols and phenol in biocrude oil, authentic standards of phenol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99%) and m-cresol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) with different concentrations (1000, 500, 200, 100 ppm) were employed to plot the quantification curves. All the materials and chemicals were used without further treatment."
3,Synthesis and characterizations of biochar,"2.2 Synthesis and characterizations of biochar It was demonstrated that the biochar produced by microwave-assisted pyrolysis was considered to be more reactive featured with surface area, porous volume, and surface functional groups as compared to that from conventional pyrolysis (Wang et al., 2020a). Therefore, the biochar used in the current work was synthesized by microwave-irradiated pyrolysis of corn stover. Typically, a 500 mL three-necked quartz flask filled with 30 g corn stover was first inflated with 500 mL/min N2 for 10 min to remove the inside air. Afterward, the N2 stream was regulated to 100 mL/min to exclude the pyrolytic volatiles during the pyrolysis. The duration of the microwave-irradiated pyrolysis process was 40 min with a 700 W of power set. At last, the biochar could be obtained with a yield of about 24 wt%, and overnight dried in a 90 °C oven, then ready for use. The resulting biochar was characterized by mineral analysis in Central Analytical Lab at the University of Arkansas, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Shimadzu, WSU), and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Tescan VEGA3, FMIC at WSU)."
4,Catalytic performance test and products analysis,"2.3 Catalytic performance test and products analysis The catalytic test of biochar was implemented in a facile quartz tube reactor (20 mm of inner diameter and 600 mm of length) heated with a thermal control furnace (Thermal Fisher Scientific), the schematic of which was available elsewhere (Wang et al., 2020a). The cellulose feed and biochar were first placed into the tube reactor, then purged with N2 at a flow rate of 300 mL/min for 10 min to create an oxygen-free atmosphere. The quartz wool was used to hold and set apart the cellulose and biochar in the fixed places. In order to make the temperature maximally close to the desired one, the biochar padded part was first heated to the pre-set temperature and the cellulose feed bed was subsequently pushed into the furnace to be pyrolyzed. Over the pyrolysis, N2 was used as the carrier to exclude the pyrolysis volatiles with a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The biocrude oil yield was calculated based on cellulose through the mass difference of the condensation system. The yield of a solid product was received by the weight change (coke) of biochar plus the mass of left residue (char) at the cellulose feed bed after pyrolysis. The weight change of biochar was obtained by the mass difference of biochar pre- and post-pyrolysis. The yield of gas was determined via the mass balance of biocrude oil and solid. Each pyrolysis process was lasted for around 10–19 min, which depended on the pyrolysis temperature. The non-condensable gas was collected in a 1L gas bag till it was inflated full, and the release ratio of gas product could be obtained according to the pyrolysis duration and N2 flow rate. The experimental factors including the temperature and biochar to cellulose ratio were determined by central composite design (CCD) that is an effective statistical means especially for the optimization of a multivariable research process, the designed conditions including temperatures and biochar to cellulose ratios which are listed in Table 1 . And this statistical design was implemented by the Design-Expert software package (Jin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). The condensed biocrude oil was analyzed by Agilent 7890A/5975C GC–MS system equipped with a DB-5 capillary column. The GC was firstly kept at 40 °C for 5 min, and then was heated to 280 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and lasted for 5 min. The biocrude oil diluted with ethyl acetate (1 μL) was injected into the GC. The interpretation of detected compounds was achieved through the build-in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) automatic mass spectral search library. A semi-quantitative process based on the area percentages of the chromatograph peaks was used to predict the selectivity of the compound (Ding et al., 2018). Particularly, the main compositions (phenol and cresols) identified in biocrude oil were quantified through the standard curves method. The peak area was represented in the Y-axis of the standard curves, which responded to the concentration shown in the X-axis. The standard curves were defined by injecting the authentic standards with different concentrations into GC/MS. The composition of non-condensable gas was determined by an INFICON 3000 Micro-GC system equipped with two channels of thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). The Molecular Sieve column was loaded in channel A (100 °C), and a Plot U column was installed in channel B (85 °C). The carrier gas of channel A and B was respectively Argon and Helium, which was used to detect H2, CH4, CO and CO2, C2, C3, C4 respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Biochar characterizations,"3.1 Biochar characterizations The functional groups especially the O-containing species could be generated and deposited on biochar during the corn stover pyrolysis. For instance, the bands shift at 1050 and 1700 cm−1 arose from the vibrations of -P-O/-C-O and -C = O groups, which could serve as the acidic sites to intensify the cracking properties of biochar. The ash compounds were not volatilized and would deposit and disperse on biochar. Based on the analysis of the complete minerals profile, the content of Ca, P, K, Fe, Mg, Mn, S, Cu, Zn, Na, and Al was respectively 10175, 8937, 39387, 159, 4831, 209, 1532, 9.3, 43, 677, and 117 ppm, which might combine with other elements forming more active sites such as -P-OH/-P = O, CaO, and -SO3H, etc. (Sun et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Mateo et al., 2020). The SEM image displayed the surface morphology of biochar, and it was observed that the biochar held most of the cell wall framework of corn stover, and numbers of long porous channels were also well created during pyrolysis, which could enlarge the surface area, and provide enough heat transfer regions for pyrolytic volatiles."
7,Cellulose pyrolysis over biochar,"3.2 Cellulose pyrolysis over biochar The thermal shock during pyrolysis enables to break down the chemical bonds and redistribute the carbons in cellulose by generating liquid, solid, and gas products. As listed in Table 1, the temperatures and biochar to cellulose ratios were respectively set to 579, 600, 650, 700, 721 °C, and 1.6, 2, 3, 4, 4.4, which gave rise to different product yields that were diagrammed in Fig. 1 . Regarding the non-catalytic runs, it could be seen that yields of biocrude oil and solid products decreased following the rise of temperature, whereas which was contrary to the gas yield. For example, it yielded 54 wt%, 14 wt%, and 24 wt%, 8 wt% of the biocrude oil and solid respectively for the pyrolysis at 500 °C (Run 28) and 650 °C (Run 30), while the gas yield increased to 68 wt% from 32 wt%. The gas release ratio could further prove the rising yield of gas products, which were around 50 and 280 mL·g-1cellulose-1 respectively in Run 28 and Run 30. The same trend for non-catalytic runs involving the relations between product yield and temperatures could also be observed for catalytic pyrolysis by comparing the product yield from Run 6 (579 °C), Run 16 (600 °C), and Run 4 (650 °C). However, the presence of biochar could lead to a slightly higher yield of biocrude oil and less formation of gas product compared to that in the absence of biochar (Run 4 vs Run 30), indicating that biochar could boost the conversion of some volatiles into liquids. The negative change of biochar weight was found in the whole range of tested runs over fresh biochar (see Table 1). During the control tests of only biochar fed (3 g), about 0.3 g mass loss of biochar was found in Run 31–33, which might arise from the release of adsorbates such as water/steam, and some unstable reactive groups over biochar. Whereas the liquid oil was not observed, indicating the complete microwave-assisted carbonization of corn stover. Over the 10 cycles of reuse evaluation, an slowly escalating trend of coke deposition could be observed from Run 18 to Run 27, which as well caused the rise of solid yield (8–12 wt%) as shown in Fig. 1, but it was only slightly higher than that over fresh biochar (6–9 wt%). This indicated that the biochar had a good resistance against coke deactivation, which might ascribe to the fact that the deposited coke is a kind of carbonaceous residue holding a similar matrix with biochar (Zhang et al., 2019). Also, studies pointed out that the steam/water involved in the pyrolysis system could refresh the active surface area of biochar, and alleviate the deactivation aroused by coke deposition (Liu et al., 2014; Di Stasi et al., 2019). The less inclined to coke formation will reduce the carbon loss during biomass conversion and in turn improve the carbon yield to the final biofuel products. By comparison, many strong acid catalysts such as zeolites used for biomass pyrolysis generally suffer from the rapid deactivation caused by serious coke deposition, which needs to regenerate in the presence of air or oxygen at high temperatures (Jae et al., 2014). Additionally, zeolites with crystalline textures are prone to hydrothermal deactivation even structure collapse at high temperature and humidity, which may result in the permanent deactivation of catalysts. Therefore, several advantages could be marked in terms of these aspects by contrast with conventional zeolites. 3.2.1 The compositions of biocrude oil During non-catalytic pyrolysis, the biocrude oil mainly comprised furans, carbonyls, and anhydro/sugars, which was easily affected by pyrolysis temperatures. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the proportion of furans decreased to 10.1% from 37% with the temperature increased to 650 °C (Run 30) from 500 °C (Run 28). While the selectivity of monomeric phenols went up to 63.2% from 5.1%. Accordingly, the quantified concentration of phenol and cresols rose to about 9 mg/mL from around 1.5 mg/mL. Following the addition of biochar, the compositions of biocrude oil changed significantly. At the biochar to cellulose ratio of 3, and temperature of 650 °C (Run 1, Run 2, Run 4, Run 5, and Run 8), for example, no detectable acids/ketones could be observed, and furans were further catalyzed to monomeric phenols compared to that of Run 30. Meanwhile, the content of phenol and cresols were enhanced to about 15 mg/mL on average contrast with about 9 mg/mL in the absence of biochar. Concerning the conversion of cellulose derivatives to phenols, the “phenol pool” theory was proposed to illustrate the mechanism, in which the oligomerization, decarbonization, and decarboxylation reactions would occur with the formation of monomeric phenols from C5 fractions like furans and ketenes (Zhang et al., 2018a). The steam/water generated in the pyrolysis system could not only serve to attenuate the coke deposition, but also act as the reactant with aromatic intermediates to form phenols, which was demonstrated by the element labeled technique in the pyrolysis of cellulose (Mukarakate et al., 2015). The raw biochar had low acidity, therefore, the phenols could also be generated from the products of the Diels-Alder reaction. Similarly, the aromatic hydrocarbons were usually the dominant products in the presence of the catalysts with strong acidity such as zeolites (Mullen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021). Moreover, the detectable naphthalenes were declined to 8% from 13%, which suggested that biochar enabled to slow down the polymerization of aromatic monomers into oligomers or polymers that probably were the precursors of coke/tar. A number of studies reported that the alkali and alkaline earth metallic species (AAEMs) such as K and Ca concentrated on biochar mattered a lot in suppressing the deactivation caused by tar/coke formation through tar/coke reforming reactions (Park et al., 2019; Shen and Fu, 2018). It was stated that the Ca (10175 ppm), K (39387 ppm), and so on could be the promoters that enabled more generation of O2– from H2O to reduce coke formation (Park et al., 2019). On the one hand, the texture with porous channels of biochar could lengthen the retention time of tar in the thermal regions, which favors the tar cracking into smaller fractions (Li et al., 2020). On the other hand, chemical bonds could be formed between biochar and AAEMs, and these bonds would break and reform repeatedly, which might serve as the ‘cross points’ during tar formation. In the course of these interactions, some coke-like compounds would be formed with a similar biochar matrix, which not only attenuated the tar release but also made up for the carbon loss of biochar given that the biochar could be assumed by steam and dry reforming reactions (Shen and Fu, 2018; Jordan and Akay, 2013). Accordantly, it was demonstrated that removal of most minerals from biochar by acid-washing greatly impaired the catalytic activities of biochar for tar reforming despite the small quantity of minerals (Xiong et al., 2017). During 10 cycles of reuse test (Run 18 to Run 27), the content of monomeric phenols (phenol and cresols) in biocrude oil almost stayed at a stable level but had decreased to an average of about 16 mg/mL compared to that of around 27 mg/mL from over fresh biochar (Run 1–2, Run 4–5, and Run 8). While it remained to yield much less of naphthalenes and reactive acids/ketones by contrast with the non-catalytic run. These indicated that the biochar still held the catalytic activities despite 10 times recycle but its level had dropped down in contrast with the fresh ones. From the SEM images of the biochar after 10 cycles of reuse, it could be seen that the biochar still kept the porous framework. However, the 10 times repeated use had partly damaged the biochar structure and weakened the catalytic performances caused by the loss of active sites, a decrease of surface area, etc., finally leading to the inferior selectivity towards desired products including hydrogen and monomeric phenols. The effects of two variable factors, temperature, and biochar to cellulose ratio, on the compositions of biocrude oil were weighed by the control variates method. As illustrated in Fig. 3 (a), at a fixed temperature of 650 °C, the content of furans went down all the way by rising biochar ratios from 1.6 to 4.4. The concentration of phenol and cresols respectively reached up to around 14 and 12 mg/mL following the biochar ratios increased to 3 from 1.6, then underwent a decline to about 8.5 and 6.5 mg/mL after the biochar ratios further went up to 4.4. Polymerization or excessive cracking could occur over excess biochar, which would generate more heavy molecular compounds like naphthalenes at the expense of monomeric phenols. From Fig. 3(b), when the biochar to cellulose ratio was fixed at 3, escalating formation of naphthalenes was found with the temperature rose gradually to 721 °C. The concentration of cresols was about 12.5 mg/mL at 650 °C, but it started to descend as the temperature was greater than 650 °C, and it was down to about 8.5 mg/mL when the temperature moved up to 721 °C. In the meantime, however, the phenol concentration had a gradual ascent to about 19 mg/mL from 4 mg/mL, which might be generated from cresols through demethylation reaction at high temperatures. 3.2.2 The compositions of gas By contrast with biocrude oil, the non-condensable gas stream from biomass pyrolysis is characterized by relatively pure compounds and highly thermodynamic stability. Consequently, the gas product is actually more of potential value relatively, as the biocrude oil has intricate constitutions, inferior stability, and reactive fractions that result in challenging access to commercial application. Fig. 4 introduced the gas distribution from cellulose catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis. The H2 and CH4 concentrations were enhanced to 48.2 and 11.1 vol% in Run 29 with the gas yield of 58 wt% at 600 °C respectively from 18.3 and 7.9 vol% in Run 28 with the gas yield of 32 wt% at 500 °C. Higher temperature would further crack relatively heavier oxygenated fractions with more formation of CH4 and H2, which could be also confirmed by the reduced content of C4+ in Run 29. In the meantime, the selectivity of CO and CO2 was respectively dropped off to 28.0 and 6.7 vol% in Run 29 from 37.4 and 24.9 vol% in Run 28. As a highly endothermic reaction, dry or CO2 reforming would be strengthened at higher temperatures with the consumption of C n H m giving more yield of CO and H2. Similarly, more heat could be supplied to make the C n H m steam reforming proceed towards the production of CO and H2. In addition, the water gas shift (WGS) reaction was also an important step in biomass pyrolysis. As a moderately exothermic process, low temperatures are conducive to high conversion as the equilibrium constant decreases with the temperature rising. However, reaction kinetics dominate at elevated temperatures despite equilibrium favors the formation of CO2 and H2 at lower temperatures. These could interpret the decline of CO content but it was not sharp as CO2 (Run 28 vs Run 29). For the catalytic runs, it could be found that the biochar addition promoted the generation of H2. At the temperature of 600 °C, for instance, the concentration of H2 was 78.3 vol% in the gas produced over biochar (Run 16, gas yield of 60 wt%), which was significantly increased from 48.2 vol% of the non-catalytic process (Run 29, gas yield of 58 wt%). Whereas the content of CH4 decreased to 5.4 from 11.1 vol% of Run 29. It was reported that the minerals in biochar like Mg (4831 ppm), K (39387 ppm), and Ca (10175 ppm) could enhance the water adsorption over biochar (Kumar et al., 2020), which in turn improved the steam reforming of CH4 and WGS reaction of CO accompanied with the mass production of H2 at the expense of C n H m especially CH4. The Boudouard reaction would also occur to consume a certain proportion of formed CO2 through WGS reaction, which led to only a slight increase of CO2 by comparing catalytic and non-catalytic runs (Run 29 vs Run 16; Run 30 vs Run 1–2, Run 4–5, and Run 8). Carbon steam reaction was also an origin of H2, although it was usually triggered at elevated temperatures like 700 °C or higher. Under high temperatures, the gasification of coke could not only increase the formation of CO and H2, but also refresh the active surface of biochar (Shen and Fu, 2018). The aforementioned reactions involved to produce H2 could in turn account for the significant reduction of reactive species (aqueous phase) in biocrude oil from cellulose catalytic pyrolysis over biochar, as the aqueous phase reforming (APR) pathway had been extensively studied aimed at the production of H2 from biocrude oil (Chen et al., 2015). During the 10 cycles reuse (Run 18 to Run 27 illustrated in Fig. 4), the H2 selectivity tended to decline gradually with the increase of reuse cycles, the range of which located between 66.3 and 76.9 vol% compared to about 78.5 vol% for over fresh biochar, while still greater than that from non-catalytic one (Run 30). Meanwhile, it could be also observed that the content of CH4 and CO appeared an ascending trend with reuse cycles. Additionally, it was found that the gas yield stayed at a stable level of around 65 wt% over the reuse tests, which was similar to that from fresh biochar as a catalyst. Whereas it yielded more solid residue at the expense of biocrude oil. These results could lie in the loss of active sites over biochar especially the minerals-based functional groups, and also the blockage of active sites that arose from the coke deposition. According to the minerals analysis of biochar after 10 cycles of reuse, the content was respectively Ca (11844 ppm), P (8114 ppm), K (36464 ppm), Fe (221 ppm), Mg (5579 ppm), Mn (248 ppm), S (1105 ppm), Cu (13.3 ppm), Zn (50.5 ppm), Na (594 ppm), and Al (140 ppm). By contrast with the fresh biochar, the content of several critical minerals like P, K, and S decreased to 8114, 36464, and 1105 ppm from 8937, 39387, and 1532 ppm, which could result in the loss of active sites over biochar and impair its selectivity especially on hydrogen. While it was found that the repeated use slightly boosted the content of Ca (11844 ppm) and Mg (5579 ppm) over spent biochar compared to Ca (10175 ppm), and Mg (4831 ppm) of fresh biochar. This might be attributed to the consumption of ‘C’ of biochar, which could make the minerals concentrated in biochar. The gas distribution was affected by temperature and biochar to cellulose ratio. As the graphs represented in Fig. 5 (a), with the biochar to cellulose ratio rose to 3 from 1.6, the H2 proportion continuously went up to 78.6 from 72.3 vol%, while the concentration of CH4, CO, and CO2 declined to 5.8, 6.8, and 7.0 vol% respectively from 7.2, 9.3, and 8.5 vol%. Following the further increase of biochar to cellulose ratio, the content of H2, CH4, CO, and CO2, etc. almost kept at a constant level, which might be owing to the limited state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Analogously, the higher temperature was beneficial for the H2 generation but it was a confined response as well. As expressed in Fig. 5(b), the content of H2 moved up with the temperature increased to 650 °C, then underwent the downward status when the temperature was further increased. It was assumed that the fluctuation was related to the fact that some reactions like WGS could be reserved by varying temperatures, and high temperatures made it shift to the backward direction impeding H2 formation, which was also evidenced by the upward selectivity of CH4 and CO."
8,Conclusions,"In this work, catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose was performed over a low-cost, simple, and highly stable biochar catalyst targeted to simplify the compositions of resulting biocrude oil and enhance the generation of H2. The highly reactive oxygen-containing species such as carboxylic acids, furans, aldehydes, ketones in biocrude oil were significantly reduced after the presence of biochar. Meanwhile, it gave more yield to the structurally stable monomeric phenols. At the temperature of 600 °C, around 78 vol% of H2 was achieved in the catalytic process, which was remarkably promoted from that of about 48 vol% in the absence of biochar."
