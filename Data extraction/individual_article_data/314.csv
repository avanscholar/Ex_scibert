0,Introduction,"Hydrogen technology is now been considered as one of the most promising future green energy technologies due to its high energy density and zero carbon emissions, which address the call for carbon neutralization [1]. The utilization of hydrogen has been limited by the generation and transportation of hydrogen, as well as the development of fuel cell technology [2,3]. Hydrogen production is abundant in various processes, such as steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas [4,5], oil refinery [6], chlorate industry [7], and coal gasification [8,9], which, although cheap in price, is contaminated with sulfur compounds or carbon monodioxide, which prohibit from the direct fuel cell use [9]. Electrolyzed water is regarded as an appealing technology because of its high purity and abundance of water [10–12]. However, this technology strongly depends on electricity prices and requires heavy equipment investment [13]. In addition to the common electrolyzed hydrogen production from pure water, applying electric power to electrolyze salt solution (chlor-alkali) is another avenue that generates hydrogen as a byproduct, and produces chlorine and sodium hydroxide as basic industrial materials [13–15]. In comparison with diaphragm and mercury processes, membrane-based electrolysis uses a highly conductive ion exchange membrane (IEM) to separate chlorine and hydrogen is the cleanest and most efficient and economical chlor-alkali technology available today [16,17]. Over the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to improving the energy efficiency of chlor-alkali electrolysis, including using the oxygen-depolarizing cathode (ODC) instead of hydrogen evolution cathode [18,19], and reducing the membrane thickness [20,21]. However, these methods have limitations. For example, ODC technology requires extra energy to purify the produced oxygen [22], and a too thin membrane leads to mechanical failure [20]. The chlor-alkali process consumes energy enormously, which uses approximately 0.6% of global power [14,17]. Therefore, it is desirable to decrease the cell voltage and power consumption to achieve better energy-saving chlor-alkali process [23–25]. To date, the most advanced separator used in membrane-based electrolysis is the sodium perfluorinated ion exchange membrane (SPIEM), which contains a sodium perfluorosulfonic acid layer and a sodium perfluorocarboxylic acid layer, and is reinforced by a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fabric [21,26]. In a membrane cell, the SPIEM allows sodium ions to pass under an electric field, hydrogen and sodium hydroxide are simultaneously formed in the cathodic compartment, and slight modification in collecting and purifying the gas product could afford green hydrogen [14]. However, these fluoropolymers are highly aerophilic in liquid electrolytes [27,28]. As a result, gas products are easily absorbed on the membrane surface, which blocks the contact between the electrolyte and membrane, and increase the ohmic drop. Thus, the overall electrolysis efficiency is decreased. So far, underwater bubble wettability is a major focus on the electrode materials and separators [29–34]. The modification of IEM to manipulate superaerophobicity is the key, which plays an important role in determining the anti-bubble property of IEM during electrolysis operation. Unfortunately, quite limited research can be seen in public, except for few patents that use inert particles coating or mechanical roughening to modify the IEM surface properties [35,36], yet without systematic results and mechanisms. We recently discovered that fabricating a bubble-repellent ZrO2 coating on the surface of the perfluorosulfonic acid membrane can improve the efficiency of electrolysis, addressing the urgent needs in developing new IEM and reseach the strucutre-property relationship. The ZrO2 coating uses ZrO2 particles with a size of about 300 nm, which changes the surface morphology in nano scale and induces new surface properties [37]. However, long practice reveals that the bubble formation during electrolysis process is strongly coupled with surface adsorption and thus surface morphology can be a critical factor to be considered. The surface of IEM should be low in resistance for ion transport, allowing the fast ion transport across the membrane [20,38], and the surface needs to repel bubbles in time, prohibiting ohmic drops and extra overpotentials. The wetting phenomenon of bubbles on a solid surface is essential that a liquid–solid phase being replaced by a vapour–solid phase in liquid [33,39]. Therefore, a good hydrophilic material favored to aerophobicity in liquid. It has been reported that the bubble adhesion behavior (e.g., “ superaerophobic state”) can be tuned through the surface architecture construction [31,40,41]. For example, Yong et al. designed the different topographies (i.e., smooth, micro, nano, and micro-/nanostructures) on silicon surfaces by chemical etching/photolithography techniques. The obtained micro/nanostructured surfaces showed ultralow underwater gas bubble adhesive forces and a high gas bubble contact angle [39]. This was attributed to the discontinuous solid–liquid–vapour three-phase contact line (TPCL) afforded by creating micro/nanostructured surfaces, resulting in low bubble adhesion [42]. Developing new SPIEMs with anti-bubble surfaces and high ion transport efficiency is high efficiency integration of chlor-alkali electrolysis and hydrogen production. Such effort lies in the fundamental understanding of the surface topology and bubble interaction mechanism without perturbing the nanopores in the SPIEM. Multi-length-scaled heterogeneous surface that using materials to selectively repel the gas nuclei and keep a high ion transport efficiency is the approach we take. The hydrophilic ZrO2 particles with different sizes are used due to their corrosion resistance and excellent chemical stability, whose assembly results in a controllable internal cavity size and density on the surface of the SPIEM. Different surface topologies can be obtained due to the size dependent assembly and interaction with the ionomer binder. It is seen that the intermediate nano/micro sized ZrO2 particle coating results in a popcorn-like hierarchical surface (M-Ⅱ), where the gas bubble is hard to stand (adhesive force of 11 μN). In comparison, the “flat” surface (M-Ⅰ) or the “coral-like” surface (M−III) that uses small or giant ZrO2 particles shows a low bubble contact angle in brine, which is inferior in repelling gas bubbles. The new hierarchical SPIEM outperforms the commercial Nafion TM 2030 and pristine SPIEM at high current densities, enabling lower cost production of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. We further examined the fuel cell use of chlor-alkali electrolysis produced hydrogen, which showed high efficiency after simple drying, visualizing an application from a conventional industrial production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zirconia (ZrO2) powder (CZ-5, CZ-3, and CY3Z-PL) was commercially obtained from Saint-Gobain. The sodium perfluorinated ion exchange membrane (SPIEM) (200 ± 5 μm thickness, Na+ form), commercial DMR100 (15 μm ± 2 μm thickness, H+ form), sodium perfluorosulfonic acid polymer (PFSA-Na) (EW 962, Na+ form) and 5A molecular sieve were provided by Shandong Dongyue Shenzhou New Materials Company Ltd, China. Commercial Nafion™ N2030 (Na+ form, Chemours Chemicals Co., Ltd.) was the standard cation exchange membrane used for chlor-alkali electrodialysis. The deoxygenation catalysts (CAS-KR-T01-K) were purchased from Jiangxi Zhongke Kairui Environmental Protection Catalysis Co., Ltd. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chloride (NaCl), isopropanol and ethanol were used as received from Shanghai Aladdin Chemical Reagent Company, China. Ultrapure Milli-Q water was obtained from a Millipore System and used throughout the experiments."
3,Fabrication of the coated membranes,"2.2 Fabrication of the coated membranes Three types of membranes with different surface morphologies and bubble wettabilities were fabricated by a simple coating method. First, a hydroalcoholic solution of PFSA-Na with a concentration of 5% was achieved by our previously described method. After that, 5% PFSA-Na solution, ethanol and ZrO2 powder (properties shown in Table S1) in a ratio of 1:3:1 were mixed and mechanically stirred for 4 h to obtain three different types of homogeneous dispersions. The entire spraying process was carried out on a fully automatic spraying instrument with a constant temperature of 60 °C. A pristine SPIEM with a size of 30 × 30 cm was fixed onto the horizontal sample plate of the spray setup. The ZrO2 coated membranes were prepared with the following optimized spraying parameters: a nozzle height of 15 cm, a flow rate of 30 cc min−1, a carrier gas pressure of 4 bar, and a nozzle moving speed of 25 mm s−1. These processes were repeated several times to produce the desired coated membrane. Then, the coated membrane was transferred to a 110 °C oven for 15 min to remove residual solvent."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The particle size distributions of ZrO2 powder were determined by a Microtrac S3500 particle size analyzer. The morphology and roughness of the as-prepared membranes were characterized via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operated at 10 kV (Quanta 250 FEG, FEI, America) and a ZEISS Smartproof 5 widefield confocal microscope. ZrO2 loading (g m−2) was measured as the difference in dry mass before and after coating, normalized to the surface area of each membrane. The interaction force between the gas bubbles and membrane surface can be evaluated by a high-sensitivity microelectromechanical balance system (Dataphysics DCAT11, Germany), and the under-brine bubble contact angle was investigated via the captive bubble method (KRUSS DSA30, Germany). The volume of the bubble was approximately 4 μL for each test. All experiments were conducted for more than five times. The composition of the hydrogen from the chlor-alkali electrolysis was analyzed using a DWS-ⅡC moisture analyzer (Guangzhou Ruifeng Experimental Equipment Co., Ltd., China) and GC9560 gas chromatography (GC, Shanghai Huaai Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) equipped with a pulsed discharge detector, with helium (99.9999%) as the carrier gas."
5,Electrochemical measurement,"2.4 Electrochemical measurement Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a four-electrode electrochemical cell using a couple of 1 cm2 Pt plates as the working and counter electrodes, and saturated Ag/AgCl electrodes were immersed in luggin capillaries were utilized as reference electrodes. The EIS setup was connected to a Gamry Interface 3000 potentiostat, and measurements were conducted in a 0.7 M NaCl solution at room temperature (25 ℃). All measurements were surveyed in the frequency range of 103 – 10-3 Hz at a rate of 60 measurements frequencies, with an amplitude of 10 mV. The membrane conductivity (σ) can be calculated as: (1) σ = L R m A 0 σ is membrane conductivity (S cm−1), and L is the membrane thickness, A 0 is membrane area (2 cm2)."
6,NaCl transport measurements,"2.5 NaCl transport measurements Salt (e.g., NaCl) permeability (P s) was determined at 30 ℃ by using custom jacketed glass diffusion cells. Prior to NaCl permeability measurements, the membrane sample was placed in Milli-Q water for at least 24 h, and to extract any mobile impurities. Following the extraction step, the sample was then clamped between the two chambers of equal volume. The downstream chamber was initially filled with Milli-Q water, and a conductivity probe (S700 Seven Excellence conductivity, Mettler Toledo Instruments (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., China) was used to track the change in the downstream chamber solution conductivity over time. Subsequently, the upstream chamber was filled with 5 M NaCl solution. The solutions in the two chambers were mixed by mechanical stirring. Ionic conductivity in the downstream solution was converted to NaCl concentration via a calibration curve. The NaCl permeability coefficient, P s, was calculated using equation 2 [43,44]: (2) ln 1- 2 C S t S t C S0 S 0 = - 2A 〈 P s 〉 VL t where c s t s t is the downstream chamber NaCl concentration at time t, c s 0 s 0 is the initial upstream chamber NaCl concentration (5 M), V is the solution volume in each chamber (18 ml), A is the effective area for mass transport (3.14 cm2), and L is the membrane thickness (200 μm). When c s 0 s t ⪡ c s t s 0 , the logarithmic term of equation (2) is expanded in the Taylor series, if the higher-order term is ignored, equation (2) can be simplified to (3) 〈 P s 〉 = C St S t VL tA C S0 S 0"
7,Cell performance,"2.6 Cell performance The potential application of the membranes was evaluated in a homemade chlor-alkali electrolyzer with a 100 cm2 projected electrode area. A commercial RuO2/IrO2-coated Ti-mesh electrode was used as the anode and a Pt-coated Ni-mesh electrode was used as the cathode (Jiangsu Ancan Technology Co., Ltd), which were connected with a DC power supply. The as-prepared membrane sample was sandwiched by the two electrodes. The liquid feed at the anode side was saturated brine with a flow rate of 6 ml min−1 and the Milli-Q water feed at the cathode was controlled at 0.3 ml min−1. The voltage performance of the cells was investigated at different current densities from 1 to 6 KA m−2 at 85 ± 2 ℃, and the corresponding cell voltage drop was recorded by a digital multimeter. The long-term membrane stability test was carried out at 6 KA m−2 for 360 h at 85 ± 2 ℃."
8,Fuel cell,"2.7 Fuel cell The by-product hydrogen used for fuel cell evaluation was produced from a parallel connected stack chlor-alkali membrane cell stack consisting of five individual membrane cells (the details are described in 2.6). Then, hydrogen was passed into a custom-designed tube reactor (diameter = 2 cm, h = 30 cm) containing 40 g of deoxygenation catalyst, the tube reactor was heated by jacketed heaters, and the temperature was set to 60 ℃. Subsequently, hydrogen was passed into a tube reactor (diameter = 3.5 cm, h = 50 cm) containing 320 g of 5A molecular sieve. Last, the hydrogen was further compressed into the gas cylinder by the diaphragm compressor. The fuel cells were examined via a commercial fuel cell test system (Model 890e, Scribner Associate, Inc). The DMR100 membrane was fixed by a pair of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) to make a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The active area of the MEA was 25 cm2 with commercial Pt/C as the catalyst, and the Pt loading at the anode and cathode catalyst was 0.48 mg cm−2. The polarization curves of the MEA in this work were obtained at 75 ℃ with 100% RH, a stoichiometric flow of 1.5/2.5 for H2/air, and a back-pressure of 100 kPa. In situ cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were obtained at a scan rate of 20 mV/s from 0.045 to 1 V. The anode and cathode were purged with H2/N2 at flow rates of 100/200 sccm, respectively, and the cell was kept at 35 ℃ with a 100% RH."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Morphology and surface properties,"3.1 Morphology and surface properties To investigate the effect of membrane surface morphology on the electrolytic performance, we chose the aqueous alcohol dispersions of zirconia with different particle size distributions as the structural material and sodium perfluorosulfonic acid polymer (PFSA-Na) as the binding material to prepare particle emulsions. A ZrO2 layer was spray coated onto the smooth pristine SPIEM (Fig. S1) to formulate surfaces with different morphologies (Fig. 1 ). Three surfaces with different morphologies (M-Ⅰ, M-Ⅱ, and M−III) were constructed. The M-Ⅰ membrane surface was relatively uniform with the zirconia particle sizes ranging from 0.06 −11 μm (Fig. S2a and Table S1). The M-Ⅱ membrane surface was of hierarchical morphology with the zirconia particle size distributions of 0.4–75 μm (Fig. S2b and Table S1). The M−III membrane surface was prepared by using even larger zirconia particles of approximately 10 μm (Fig. S2c and Table S1). Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of M-Ⅰ, M-Ⅱ and M−III by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is seen that the particle size has a profound effect in dictating the ZrO2 layer morphology. Small sized ZrO2 forms a dense packing layer glued by ionomers (M-Ⅰ), which prohibits the anti-bubble and ion transport properties. The M-Ⅱ surface shows a popcorn-like architecture ZrO2 layer topology with a size of several micrometers. This result originates from the large size heterogeneity of the ZrO2 particles that small and large particles would aggregate with neighbors of similar sizes, and vacancies in particle aggregation are filled with ionomers. The particle aggregations then assembled on SPIEM surface, creating hierarchical pores to support electrolyte transport. The M−III surface shows much larger coral-like microstructures due to the large ZrO2 particle size. With similar amounts of dispersions are used in surface layer preparation, clearly uncovered area is seen. The morphology of the different surfaces can also be seen from the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S3), where the M-Ⅰ surface has a rather flatter ZrO2 coating, the M−III surfaces is of “ridge-and-valley” morphology, and the M-Ⅱ surface exhibits a homogeneously wavy ridge-like morphology with moderate surface roughness. The surface roughness of the membranes was studied by the laser scanning confocal microscopy, and the root-mean-square roughness (Sa) values were 0.110 μm, 0.851 μm and 3.829 μm, respectively (Fig. 2 g-i). It should be commented on the hierarchical surface topology of the M-Ⅱ surface. The ionomer binder is of similar chemical nature with SPIEM, and thus, the electrolyte could diffuse through the aggregated particles. There are micropores in-between these aggregates, which are free for electrolyte diffusion to get in contact with pristine SPIEM. Such a treatment leads to good surface coverage of particles and retains a cross-sectional area similar to that in neat SPIEM. Ion transport can thus be maintained at a high level, and the topology serves to reduce the interaction with the as-formed bubbles. An improper ZrO2 particle size leads to either a dense flat or dewetted surface topology, which is adverse for the dual design purpose. In chlor-alkali electrolysis, the wetting behavior of gas bubbles on the submerged membrane surface determines the de-gas properties of the SPIEM. The aerophilic surface would captures the chlorine/hydrogen bubbles in the electrolyte and leads to reductions in ion transport and increase in overpotentials [37,45]. In order to explore the origin of the different electrolysis performance on these membranes, the under-brine bubble adhesion forces as well as under-brine bubble contact angle were characterized. As shown in Fig. 3 a, due to the low surface energy of fluoropolymer [46], the adhesion force of pristine SPIEM to gas bubble in brine is as high as 155 μN, and the gas bubble adheres firmly on the surface even if the membrane was turned upside down (Fig. 3c). Noticeably, after introducing ZrO2 coating, the prepared membranes show improved aerophobicity. The under-brine bubble contact angle (CA) of the M-Ⅱ membrane surface is 156.3° ± 1.3° (Fig. 3c). This superaerophobic property is attributed to the intrinsically hydrophilic ZrO2 particle surfaces and popcorn-like hierarchical micro/nanoporous architecture on which gas bubbles cannot find a stable contact angle [40,41]. Due to the hierarchical rough architecture, which made gas bubbles only touch the edges of the membrane surface and thus cut the continuous TPCL of bubbles on the membrane surface into a more discrete state. Furthermore, the hydrophilic ZrO2 and porous structure could trap liquid to form multi-channeled “liquid reservoirs”, which serves as an intermediate layer upon ion diffusion. The bubble deformation (11μN) of the M-Ⅱ membrane is negligible during gas bubble adhesive force measurement (Fig. 3b), further confirming the discussed results, and the bubble-repellent property significantly surpassed previous report (bubble adhesive force was 72.81 μN, under-brine CA was 151.3°) [37]. Compared to that of M-Ⅱ, the roughness of the M-Ⅰ surface was moderately decreased. Increasing the roughness of the solid surface would lead to a change in the contact state for bubbles, switching from the Wenzel state to the Cassie state. Therefore, the low roughness of M-Ⅰ leads to an increase in the contact area between the gas bubbles and the membrane surface. The under-brine gas bubble contact angle is 150.4° ± 1.6° (Fig. 3c), and a higher gas bubble adhesive force of 19 μN is obtained (Fig. 3a) which is inferior to that of the M-Ⅱ membrane. The M−III surface exhibits a much higher gas bubble adhesive force (61 μN, Fig. 3a), and the gas bubbles are obviously deformed when they are forced to leave the M−III surface (Fig. 3b). This effect is ascribed to the oversized pore structures, which can trap the as formed bubbles and hold them firmly before being pushed. Thus, a continuous and stable TPCL can be formed, and a lower under-brine CA of 143.2° ± 2.3° (Fig. 3c) is obtained. It is also speculated that the large sized particles lead to surface covering of ionomers, which provides extra force to pin bubbles, and thus, the contact angle in M−III is similar to that in pristine SPIEM."
11,Transport of heterogeneous surfaces,"3.2 Transport of heterogeneous surfaces We then investigated the salt transport that influences the electrolysis performance. In general, the salt transport in dense (nonporous) membranes driven by the concentration gradient is dictated by the salt permeability coefficient, which contains contributions from both cations and anions [47,48]. According to the solution diffusion model, the mechanism of salt transport includes the partitioning from the solution into the upstream face of the membrane, diffusion through the membrane toward the concentration gradient, and partitioning from the downstream face of the membrane [49,50]. NaCl permeability properties were measured to calculate the permeability coefficients following equation (3) using a dual-chamber permeation cell at 30 °C. The downstream conductivity as a function of time and the NaCl permeability coefficients for different surface treated membranes are presented in Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b. Compared with pristine SPIEM, the ZrO2 coated membranes exhibit lower downstream conductivity values at comparative time scales. The downstream conductivity value of ZrO2 coated membranes decreased by 26–77% comparing with pristine SPIEM, which is correlated with the effective cross-sectional area of the ZrO2 coated SPIEM. Although the high coverage of the ZrO2 coating, the mesoporous nanostructure is more favorable for NaCl diffusion. When the solid loading of ZrO2 was 9.1–9.3 g/m2, the NaCl permeability coefficients were measured to be 5.19 × 10-5 cm2/s, 9.33 × 10-5 cm2/s and 1.87 × 10-4 cm2/s for the M-Ⅰ, M-Ⅱ and M−III membranes. For the M-Ⅰ, the NaCl permeability coefficients only decrease by 7% when the solid loading of ZrO2 increases from 9.1 g/m2 to 13.2 g/m2. Thus, quite few pore structures exist in M−I and the NaCl diffusion is achieved through the ionic channels of the ionomer binder. The NaCl permeability coefficients of M-Ⅱ decreased by 45% as the loading of ZrO2 increased from 9.3 g/m2 to 13.3 g/m2. Thus, a thicker coating cover the mesopores, which significantly reduces NaCl diffusion. The NaCl permeability coefficients of M−III decreased by 61% when the ZrO2 loading of changed from 9.4 g/m2 to 13.6 g/m2 (Fig. 4b), which is of the same reason with that in M−II. The above-discussed results yield the transport mechanism of ZrO2 coated SPIEMs (Fig. 4c-e). The PFSA-Na polymer is a typical kind of amphiphilic block copolymer that could be self-assemble to form ion transport nano channels that provide the low-rate salt diffusion (Fig. 4f). The mesopores in the ZrO2 layer provide the high-rate salt diffusion. Their combination yields the total diffusion across the ZrO2 coated SPIEMs. Such a treatment optimization aims to balance the transport and de-gas properties, and by manipulating the mesopore size and density, the best performing SPIEM can be obtained. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool to study the complex transport phenomena in IEM systems across membranes of heterogeneous structures [51]. When an electric field is applied to the membrane system, the current in the membrane phase is mainly carried by counterions due to Donnan exclusion, but in the bulk solution phase, it is carried by positive and negative ions [52,53]. The difference in transport numbers of the counterions between the electrolyte solution and membrane phase leads to the formation of an electrical double layer (EDL) and a diffusion boundary layer (DBL) at the interface between the membrane surface and solution. According to reports, EIS can distinguish the contributions of these different layers because different layers have different responses to current signals applied at different frequencies [54]. In the high frequency range, the response comes from purely resistive factors (ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and the membrane). As the frequency decreases, the system behavior is mass transfer occurring at the EDL. At low frequency, the transport in the DBL becomes predominant in the EIS response [55,56]. A schematic of the three different transport layers considered is shown in Fig. 5 a. The influence of the surface topology on ion transport was examined in a four-electrode system with a 0.7 M NaCl solution. Fig. 5b shows the impedance spectra of the SPIEMs, and similar semicircles were observed, indicating that ion transport of the SPIEMs followed a similar mechanism. The equivalent resistance (R)/constant phase element (CPE) circuit of the composite impedance spectra was built to analyze the EIS results and is schematically shown in Fig. 5b, in which Rm+s was defined as a combined solution resistance and membrane resistance resistor (Rm+s), and the membrane resistance (Rm) was obtained by subtracting the solution resistance (Rs = 3.17 Ω) from the EIS measurements without a membrane. Redl and CPEedl represent the ion transport contribution of the electrical double layer formed at the membrane/solution interface, and Rdbl and CPEdbl represent the contribution from transport in the diffusion boundary layers adjacent to the membrane. The fittings are represented by solid lines in Fig. 5b, and the fitting results are listed in Table 1 . The Rm value of the pristine SPIEM was 1.37 Ω, and the Rm values of the coated membranes were 1.96 Ω, 1.90 Ω and 1.78 Ω for M-Ⅰ, M-Ⅱ and M−III, respectively. The increase in membrane resistance is due to the coated ZrO2 layer reducing ion transport, and the amount of increase agrees with the trend of the electrolyte accessible surface. From the M-Ⅰ to M-Ⅱ to M−III, the Rdel values increased from 0.216 Ω to 0.272 Ω and to 0.307 Ω, respectively. The increasing Rdel could stem from the increase in the distribution of charge on the membrane surface as the dewetted surface topology provides a larger contact surface with the electrolyte. The exponent n of the electrical double layer CPEedl is considered an indicator of membrane surface heterogeneity, which is inversely related to surface roughness [55]. The CPEedl exponent n values are 0.519, 0.480, and 0.413 for the M-Ⅰ, M-Ⅱ and M−III samples, respectively, which agrees with the SEM analysis."
12,Electrolysis and fuel cell applications,"3.3 Electrolysis and fuel cell applications The electrolysis applications of pristine SPIEM, M-Ⅰ, M-Ⅱ and M−III membranes were characterized in membrane cells, which were constructed with a commercial Pt-coated Ni-mesh electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (10 × 10 cm−2) and a commercial RuO2/IrO2-coated Ti-mesh electrode for the chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) (10 × 10 cm−2). Fig. 6 a shows the cell voltage against the applied current density for representative samples. With increasing current density, the cell voltage with pristine SPIEM increased faster than that of the M-Ⅰ, M-Ⅱ and M−III membranes. M-Ⅱ with moderate membrane resistance and a superaerophobic interface showed the highest energy efficiency in the electrolysis cell (3.041 V at 6 kA cm−2). This is because the M-Ⅱ with a popcorn-like hierarchical micro/nanoporous structure offers the best trade-off between low membrane resistance and the highest anti-bubble property. In addition, the pristine SPIEM and M-Ⅱ membranes were tested in a prolonged run for 360 h under the same current density of 6 kA cm−2 (Fig. 6b). The cell voltage of M-Ⅱ showed remarkable stability with negligible fluctuation, the SEM image of M-Ⅱ after stability test in Fig. S4 indicates the well-preserving of the morphology, which proved the stability of the ZrO2 coated membrane as expected. The power consumption for producing one ton of 100% NaOH can be calculated through the following equation [57]: (4) D C E n e r g y 100 % N a O H p r o d u c e d = U F D [ kWh t ] where U is the cell voltage (V), F is the Faraday constant for NaOH (1.4923 kg kAh−1), and D is the NaOH current efficiency (%). An increase in power consumption shows a proportional relationship with cell voltage. Fig. 6c shows a comparison of the specific power consumption of the membranes operating at 6 kA m−2. The M-Ⅱ shows the minimum power consumption (2037.8 kWh t−1) for producing one ton of 100% NaOH at 6 kA m−2, which is lower than that of commercial Nafion TM N2030 (2151 kWh t−1), pristine SPIEM (2204 kWh t−1), M−III (2088 kWh t−1), and M-Ⅰ (2061.2 kWh t−1), respectively. This means that M-Ⅱ can achieve a power consumption reduction of 166.2 kWh t−1 compared with that of pristine SPIEM at 6 kA m−2, which is considerably higher than previously reported value (100 kWh t−1) [37]. Furthermore, the cost savings achieved by ZrO2 coated membranes were also estimated. Fig. 6d shows the comparison of electricity costs for chlor-alkali electrolysis, since the minimum thermodynamics decomposition voltage is about 2.2 V, assuming that the electricity price is $ 0.092 USD kWh−1, the theoretical minimum electricity costs for producing one ton of 100% NaOH is about 136.5 USD. The pristine SPIEM exhibit the highest electricity cost of $ 202.77 USD for producing one ton of 100% NaOH at 6 kA m−2. Compared with pristine SPIEM, the cell with M-Ⅱ can save about $ 15.29 USD for producing one ton of 100% NaOH at 6 kA m−2, which is higher than that of M-Ⅰ ($ 13.13 USD) and M−III ($ 10.67 USD), respectively. It is worth noting that the global annual yield of NaOH exceeds 84 million tons, thus, a slight reduction in cell voltage is of great significance to the cost savings of the chlor-alkali industry. The performance of hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis was also measured by a single cell. Prior to measurements, the impurity content (nitrogen, oxygen and moisture) of hydrogen from the chlor-alkali electrolysis was successfully reduced to 261 ppm (Fig. S5 and Table S2) by a simple purification process and further compressed into a high-pressure cylinder. Fig. 7 a shows polarization curves of hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis and commercial high-purity hydrogen at 75 ℃ with 100% RH. The difference is negligible, and both fed hydrogens exhibit excellent performances (power density: 1517 and 1522 mW cm−2 at 3000 mA cm−2 for the hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis and commercial high-purity hydrogen, respectively.), which is due to trace amounts of inert nitrogen having no impact on the catalyst layer and does not cause fuel starvation issues in the dead-ended anodes. This result was further verified by almost overlapping in situ cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves, which are shown in Fig. 7b. These results demonstrate that the hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis could be regarded as a promising low-cost hydrogen candidate for practical fuel cell applications."
13,Conclusions,"In conclusion, a novel SPIEM with a popcorn-like hierarchical micro/nanoporous ZrO2 coating was designed and fabricated for chlor-alkali electrolysis and hydrogen production. Coupled with the coating morphology optimization of technologies (e.g., controllable internal cavity size, density and surface coverage of particles), which shows efficient ion transport, low membrane resistance and ultralow under-brine adhesive superaerophobicity rapidly removed gas bubbles from the membrane surface. Benefitting from this unique property, the membrane exhibits low power consumption (2037.8 kWh t−1), i.e., 166.2 kWh and 113.2 kWh less than pristine SPIEM (2204 kWh t−1) and Nafion TM N2030 (2151 kWh t−1) for producing one ton of 100% NaOH at 6 kA cm−2. Therefore, M-Ⅱ can achieve a lower cost the production for chlor-alkali electrolysis. Meanwhile, the M-Ⅱ membrane also exhibited remarkable stability for 360 h. Moreover, the hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis can be efficiently converted into valuable fuel cell fuels without any expensive processing. These observations provide useful surface morphology guidelines for solving the bubble adhesion problem of other polymer electrolyte membranes."
