0,Introduction,"Since Fujishima and Honda observed the splitting of water at a TiO2 electrode under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation in 1972 [1], the study on photocatalysts used for the utilization of solar energy has attracted much attention. Photocatalytic water splitting can produce clean and recyclable hydrogen, which has been considered as a promising way to solve the global energy and environmental problems [2–6]. For effective H2 production, the band gap energy (Eg) of the photocatalysts should be >1.23eV, which is the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG 0) for water splitting. Besides, the conduction band edge of semiconductor should be more negative than the hydrogen production potential and the valence band edge should be more positive than the oxygen oxidation potential. Among various semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO2 is one of the most important currently photocatalytic materials due to its superior photoreactivity, nontoxicity, long-term stability and low cost [7–9]. Thus, many reports have been published concerning photocatalytic H2 production activities of TiO2 [10–12]. However, the most significant factor that influences the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 is its crystal form [13]. It is well known that the TiO2 crystal usually has three different crystallographic structures: rutile (tetragonal), anatase (tetragonal), and brookite (orthorhombic) [14,15]. The two crystal structures of TiO2, rutile and anatase are commonly used in photocatalysis, while pure brookite is cumbersome to prepare, and amorphous TiO2 has no photocatalytic activity [16–19]. The anatase TiO2 is generally considered to have the highest photocatalytic activity because of its comparatively high density of surface oxygen and low recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs [20–22]. Anatase is known to form at the low temperature (300–550°C), and it will transform to rutile upon heating. The transformation takes place (depending on the primary particle size and the way of preparation) from 600 to 1100°C. Moreover, for the photocatalytic activity, the band gap, between the valence band and conduction band, is also pivotal. The band gap of rutile is 3.0eV and that of anatase is 3.2eV. Rutile is known to have better ultraviolet light response, while anatase is usually of better photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic performance of TiO2 almost always depends not only on the phase composition but also on the morphology, the size and porosity of the particles, their specific surface area, hydrophilicity and concentration of surface hydroxyl groups. However, the wide band gap (3.2eV for anatase) and the low quantum efficiency of anatase and rutile TiO2 limit the practical application of TiO2 photocatalyst. Interestingly, we find that the band gap of rutile TiO2 is 3.0eV, having better ultraviolet light response, while the anatase TiO2 often has better photocatalytic activity. So, combining the anatase TiO2 with rutile TiO2 can improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 photocatalyst, which is similar to coupling TiO2 with other semiconductor materials to reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes of TiO2 [23]. Herein, in this work, we synthesized the anatase and rutile TiO2 of single crystal structure by a facile hydrolysis method and investigated the photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production from water of mixed structure TiO2 (commercial titanium dioxide P25, ST21, ST-31) and single crystal structure TiO2 (prepared anatase and rutile TiO2) under UV light irradiation. Meanwhile, platinum (Pt), as an excellent co-catalyst, is loaded on the different TiO2 samples via a photo-deposition method. The experimental results show that the mixed structure Pt-loaded P25 has the best photocatalytic activity among all the photocatalysts. For the mixed crystal structure TiO2, the synergetic effect of rutile and anatase makes the electrons flow from the conduction band of rutile TiO2 to the conduction band of anatase TiO2, thus the light quantum yield of mixed crystal structure TiO2 is improved. Therefore, hydrogen production efficiency of TiO2 with mixed crystal structure is better than TiO2 with single crystal."
1,Experimental sections,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods The commercial TiO2 materials of P25, ST-21, ST-31 were purchased from Ishihara Sangyo Ltd. All the chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of samples,"2.2 Preparation of samples The anatase TiO2 was synthesized by the hydroylysis method [24]. In a typical preparation, 5.0mL TiCl4 was slowly added to 100mL benzyl alcohol under vigorous stirring at 0°C, the reaction vessel was sealed after 1.0h, and then the mixed solution was kept at 70°C for 3 days under continuous stirring. The precipitate was thoroughly washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried in oven at 60°C for 6h. Finally, the obtained powder was calcined at 450°C for 5h to get the anatase TiO2. The rutile TiO2 particles were synthesized by modifying a “low temperature dissolution–reprecipitation process”, which already described in the literature [25]. Briefly, 5.0mL TiCl4 was slowly added to 200mL distilled water under vigorous stirring at 5°C, and the reaction was kept at low temperature for 2h. Then the mixed solution was sealed and kept at 70°C for 6h under continuous stirring. The obtained dispersion was washed and then dried in oven at 60°C for 6h."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer D/MAX-2200/PC equipped with Cu Kα radiation (40kV, 20mA). The structural information of the samples was measured by Fourier transform spectrophotometer (FT-IR, Vertex 70, Bruker) with KBr as the reference sample. The surface morphology of products was observed using JSM-6701F field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). UV–visible Diffuse Reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of powder samples was carried out at room temperature using a Shimadzu Model 3100 UV–visible spectrophotometer over a wavelength range of 200–800nm. The reflectance spectra were transformed to absorption intensity by using the Kubelka–Munk method. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were collected at 77K on a TriStar II 3020 system."
5,Photocatalytic activity of the samples,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity of the samples The photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a Pyrex photoreactor, which is irradiated by a 500W Xenon lamp (Lancheng XQ-500, China) under vertical condition (as shown in Fig. 1). A quantity of catalyst equivalent to 50mg of (P25, ST-31 ST-21, anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2) was dispersed in 100mL aqueous solution containing 20% methanol as sacrificial reagents of H2-production or 0.05mol/L AgNO3 as sacrificial reagents of O2-production in the Pyrex photoreactor, respectively. Magnetic stirring of the solution was maintained throughout the experiment in order to make the photocatalyst particles disperse well in aqueous solution. The amounts of H2 and O2 evolution were measured by using a gas chromatography (5Å-column) with thermal conductivity detector (Huaai GC9560, China) and Ar as carrier gas."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of different commercial titanium dioxide samples,"3.1 Characterization of different commercial titanium dioxide samples XRD is an effective method to investigate the phase and structure of the samples. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 powder with different kinds. Synthesized TiO2 power with a hydrolysis method using TiCl4 as precursor are respectively crystallized into the pure anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272) and pure rutile TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1276). No characteristic diffraction peaks arising from byproducts are detected. And it can be easily noticed that anatase TiO2 sample is highly crystalline. For different commercial TiO2 (P25, ST-21, ST-31), it can be seen that the ST-31 can be described as the anatase TiO2, while compared with the single crystal anatase TiO2, the ST-31 has lower crystallinity. However, the P25 and ST-21 are mixture structures, and both of them have higher crystallinity than other samples. The P25 is a 80/20 mixture structure of anatase and rutile with clear lines at 25.3° and 39.0° (anatase) and 27.4° and 37.1° (rutile) [26]. For the ST-21 mixture structure, the content of rutile only is 0.01%, the (110) crystal faces of rutile TiO2 has not been shown [27]. The high crystallinity can facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts. Therefore, we infer that the P25 and ST-21 have higher photocatalytic activity than other samples. Meanwhile, the different peak intensity indicates different crystallite sizes. So the crystallite sizes of different samples have been calculated using the Scherrer formula D=Kλ/(β cos θ). Where the K is a constant (0.89), λ is the X-ray wavelength, which is 0.154nm, β is the peak width at half height of different samples. The calculated crystallite sizes of P25, ST-21, ST-31, anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 are 18.86, 18.81, 5.78, 9.86 and 6.06nm, respectively. The FT-IR spectra of the different TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 3. The strong and wide adsorption band is about 518cm−1, which attributes to the vibrations of the Ti–O–Ti framework bonds in TiO2 [28]. The adsorption band at 3431cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration mode of (–OH) or H–O in H2O, and it is the bending vibration mode of O–H bonds in H2O at 1637cm−1. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the commercial TiO2 (P25, ST-31, ST-21), as-prepared anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2. From the SEM images, we find that the overall morphology of all TiO2 samples are aggregated nanoparticles, and the diameter of nanoparticles is less than 200nm. The SEM image of P25 is extremely similar with the ST-21, but the ST-21 sample exists obvious aggregation. However, Fig. 4c and Fig. 4e show that the ST-31 sample and anatase TiO2 are poor distributed and serious aggregation compared with rutile TiO2 (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the BET specific surface areas of all the TiO2 samples are shown in Table 1. The specific surface areas of P25, ST-21, ST-31, anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 are 59.6, 72.4, 248.3, 108.7, 157.9m2/g, respectively. Among them, we can see that the ST-31 sample has larger BET specific surface area than any other samples. For semiconductor materials, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is an efficient method for characterizing the optical absorption property, which is recognized as one of the important factors for photocatalytic activities [29]. Fig. 5 shows the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of P25, ST-21, ST-31, anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 samples. For all the TiO2 samples, they exhibit absorption in the UV light region. Compared with anatase TiO2, the rutile TiO2 has wider absorption range in the UV light region, and the absorption edge is 415nm. The absorption edge of the commercial TiO2 (P25, ST-21, ST-31) are about 410, 391 and 382nm, corresponding to the estimated band gaps of 3.02, 3.17 and 3.24eV, respectively, as shown in Table 1. Adsorption and desorption experiments using N2 were carried out at 77K. Fig. 6 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves (inset) of different TiO2 samples. As shown in Fig. 6, the anatase TiO2 shows that the shape of the isotherm is a type IV isotherm with a type H1 hysteresis loop at high relative pressures region (0.7<P/P 0<0.9) according to the IUPAC classification, which was characteristic of the mesoporous material with cylindrical pore geometry present within the anatase TiO2, and facile connectivity between the pores. This result can be further confirmed by the corresponding pore-size distribution, as shown in the inserted graph of Fig. 6, the pore size distribution curve of the anatase TiO2 exhibits about 20nm pore size distribution, further proving the presence of mesoporous (2–50nm). Additionally, from Fig. 6, we can find that the other samples show that the shape of isotherms is type IV, and the hysteresis loops type is H3 at a relative pressure range of 0.8–1, indicating the presence of mesopores and macropores, which consists of the wide pore size distributions of 25–150nm (see the inset of Fig. 6), further proving the presence of mesopores and macropores. Table 1 gives the BET surface area and pore volume of the different samples. It can be found that the P25 sample has larger pore volume (1.02cm3 g− 1) than that of other samples. Previous studies show that a suitable conformation of pores allows light waves to penetrate deep inside the photocatalysts and leads to high mobility of charge [30–33]. It is speculated that the pore in the P25 sample allows the penetration of light waves, which may greatly promote the photocatalytic activity."
8,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity evaluation Fig. 7 shows the photocatalytic activity of the different samples loaded by 0.3% Pt for hydrogen production from pure water under 500W Xenon lamp irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7, P25 shows the highest photocatalytic activity than other samples. The average H2 evolution rates of P25, ST-21, ST-31, anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 are 95.3, 78.8, 17.8, 32.6 and 26.3μmol/h, respectively. There may be a reason for explaining why the photocatalytic activity of the P25 photocatalyst is higher than that of other samples. This could be caused by the synergistic effect existed between anatase and rutile, which effectively inhibits the recombination of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs of P25 sample. In addition, observed from SEM images, the P25 sample has smaller size. It has been reported that for photocatalysts with small particles or nanoporous structures [34], the distance that the photogenerated electrons and holes have to migrate to the reaction sites on the surface shortens, which benefits the suppression of the electron/hole recombination. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern shows that the P25 sample has higher crystallinity, which also facilitates the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of P25 sample. The sacrificial reagent solutions are often used to improve the photocatalytic activity of materials. In this study, the sacrificial reagents of CH3OH solution and AgNO3 solution are used to improve the H2-production and O2-production abilities of the samples, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the photocatalytic H2 evolution from methanol/water solutions over Pt-loaded different TiO2 samples. The methanol could play a role as a trap holes sacrifice agent to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, so the hydrogen production performance of all samples are significantly improved. It can be seen that the photocatalytic activity of P25 is the highest and the average rate reaches to 750μmol/h, the rutile TiO2 and ST-21 almost are about 720μmol/h, which is because the methanol is easily oxidized in the (110) crystal faces of rutile TiO2, resulting in the better separation of photogenerated electrons and holes of rutile TiO2 in the CH3OH solution. Unfortunately, the H2-production rate of ST-31 is the worst about 280μmol/h because of the surface defects, which can capture the photogenerated electrons and inhibit the photogenerated electrons migrating to the surface of ST-31. Fig. 9 shows the photocatalytic oxygen production performance of P25, ST- 21, ST-31, anatase and rutile TiO2 in the silver nitrate solution, which is a sacrificial agent for capturing the photogenerated electron to hinder the recombination of photogenerated carriers. It can be found that the photocatalytic O2-production activity of TiO2 with mixed crystal structure is higher than the TiO2 of single crystal structure, and the O2-production average rates of P25 and ST-21 are 83μmol/h and 80μmol/h, respectively. The photocatalytic O2-production activity (52μmol/h) of the two kinds of single crystal structure TiO2 (anatase and rutile) is better than ST-31 sample (29μmol/h). Therefore, the sacrificial reagent solutions significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 samples. While the H2/O2 yield rate is not stoichiometric, the reason may be the different charge transfer and the different active sites of hydrogen production and the oxygen production."
9,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism The enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2 with mixed structures could be explained by the mechanism of photoexcitation, as shown in Fig. 10. The photoexcitation in mixed TiO2 is similar with the photoexcitation in coupled semiconductor [35–37], which provides an interesting way to increase the efficiency of photocatalytic process by promoting the charges separation and extending the energy range of photoexcitation. The relative position of the conduction and valence band energy levels of the anatase and rutile TiO2 samples is shown in Fig. 10. Under UV irradiation, the electrons of the two phases TiO2 are excited, due to the presence of small rutile TiO2, electrons rapidly transfer from rutile TiO2 to lower energy anatase TiO2, holes can transfer from anatase TiO2 to rutile TiO2, which leads to a more stable charge separation [38]. When the Pt is loaded on the surface of the mixed TiO2, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of anatase TiO2 migrate to the surface of Pt and then reduce H2O to produce H2. Thus, keeping the smaller electron density can suppress the photogenerated electrons flow from anatase TiO2 (CB) to rutile TiO2 (CB) and promote the electrons flow to anatase TiO2 (CB). The holes in valence band of rutile TiO2 can oxidize H2O to produce O2. This result efficiently separates the photogenerated electrons and holes of mixed TiO2. In addition, observed from SEM images, the P25 and ST-21 samples have smaller sizes. It has been reported that for photocatalysts with small particles or nanoporous structures, the distance that the photogenerated electrons and holes have to migrate to the reaction sites on the surface shortens, which benefits the suppression of the electron/hole recombination. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern shows the P25 and ST-21 samples have higher crystallinity, which also facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of P25 and ST-21 samples. Therefore, compared with the single phase TiO2, P25 and ST-21 mixed crystal structures will show superior photocatalytic performance for water splitting."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully prepared anatase and rutile TiO2 samples by using TiCl4 as precursor, and compared the obtained samples with different commercial TiO2 (P25, ST-21, ST-31) to investigate the photocatalytic performance of different photocatalysts from water splitting. The experimental results indicate that P25 has the best photocatalytic activity among all the TiO2 samples. Most of all, the enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the synergetic effect of rutile and anatase TiO2, which makes the electrons flow from the conduction band of rutile TiO2 to the one of anatase TiO2, restraining the recombination of electrons and holes. Besides, the higher crystallinity and smaller particles of P25 and ST-21 samples also benefit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting the high photocatalytic activity of P25 and ST-21 samples."
