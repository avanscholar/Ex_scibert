0,Introduction,"Clean energy and alternative energy have become major areas of research worldwide for sustainable energy development [1]. With circumstances of global warming and diminishing fossil fuel reserves, the newly developed energy must simultaneously meet the requirements of being environmentally-friendly and renewable. Owing to these restrictions, hydrogen is one of the most promising alternative energy carriers [2]. Therefore, developing and implementing systems for hydrogen production and storage are of high importance. The importance of hydrogen for the future energy economy is listed in the energy development strategy of many developed countries (e.g. the European roadmap for hydrogen and fuel cells of the European Commission [3] and the US Department of Energy “National hydrogen energy roadmap” [4]). According to the European Commission, in the medium to long term (beyond 2020), the main focus should be on developing and implementing systems for hydrogen production from renewable electricity and biomass. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the distributed hydrogen production, i.e. production of hydrogen at points of use, may be the most viable approach for introducing hydrogen as an energy carrier because it does not require a substantial transport and delivery infrastructure or large capital investments as those needed for large central production plants. In this case, such technologies as natural gas reforming, electrolysis, reforming of ethanol and methanol (both from biomass) are pursued. The 2020 targets of the DOE regarding hydrogen production in a distributed scale are lower production costs and higher production efficiency. Recently, another technology has been proposed for hydrogen production [5–27]. This technology uses thermal and non-thermal plasmas. In thermal plasmas (e.g. arc plasma), all the charged species (electrons and ions) and neutral species (atoms, molecules and radicals) are almost in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that the temperatures of the species are the same. Typical gas temperatures of thermal plasmas are several thousand K. On the other hand, the non-thermal plasmas (e.g. corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and surface discharge plasmas) are in the thermodynamic non-equilibrium, in which the electron temperature (several tens of thousands of K) is much higher than the temperatures of the other species mentioned above (i.e. ions and neutrals). The plasmas can be generated at a lower or higher (usually atmospheric) pressure of the working gas. Although for the lower pressure plasmas, such as the radio frequency (RF) or microwave (MW) plasma, an efficient conversion of hydrocarbons with high hydrogen selectivity can be achieved, the low hydrogen production rate and the extra energy requirement for vacuum vessels restrict the practical use of the low pressure method. The atmospheric-pressure plasmas are very attractive for gas treatment because, firstly, the plasma gas temperatures can be relatively high (103–104 K), and secondly, the plasmas are a source of very active ions, radicals and high-energy electrons, which enhance the chemical reaction rates thus enabling expensive and impurity vulnerable catalysts to be avoided. When steam is used as the plasma supporting gas, reductive and oxidative radicals such as H, OH, and O are produced in the plasma, enabling the plasma to be more effective for processing various hydrogen-abundant compounds, among them gaseous (methane, natural gas, biogas, etc.) and liquid (gasoline, heavy oils, alcohols, etc.) fuels. Various atmospheric-pressure plasmas have been used for hydrogen production on an experimental scale in the laboratory. They were plasmas of a gliding arc [5–8], dielectric barrier discharge [9–11], corona discharge [12–14], and microwave discharge [15–27]. This technology uses plasmas for reforming gaseous (e.g. methane, natural gas), liquid (e.g. ethanol, water) and gasified solid (e.g. coal, charcoal) compounds containing hydrogen. They can originate both from fossil fuels and biomass. The microwave plasma sources (MPSs) at atmospheric pressure stand out from other plasma sources offering significant advantages. The role of microwaves is to supply the energy to the plasma generator to create the plasma in gases. MPSs are considered to be more efficient in energy transfer [28]. When properly designed, a high efficiency (almost 100%) of microwave power transfer from the microwave generator to the plasma can be achieved. Since microwave plasma is operated by electricity, a fast response time of high density of electrons and active species, such as ions and free radicals can be achieved. Owing to the electrodeless operation, a high purity plasma can be obtained using microwaves. As a result of this, the use of microwave plasma for gas processing like gas purification and abatement of gaseous pollutants is attractive. The microwave plasma capability, its high reactivity, as well as its high energy density, results in compactness of the plasma reactors. Various designs of MPSs fed through microwave waveguides [29,30], coaxial line components [31,32] and micro-strip lines [33,34] have been developed. In this paper, a methane-based method is presented for the production of hydrogen using atmospheric pressure plasma generated by a waveguide-supplied metal cylinder-based MPS described in Refs. [17,35]. The waveguide MPS can generate the microwave plasma of a power of several kW. Compared to other MPSs, it enables the processing of large volumes (several thousand NL/h) of different gases, also mixtures of CH4, CO2 and water vapour. The waveguide-supplied metal cylinder-based MPS is versatile and offers various processing operations such as pyrolysis, dry reforming, and combined steam reforming that is used for hydrogen production. However, in the case of methane pyrolysis, the soot produced limits the more long-term stable operation of the MPS [35]. The other reforming processes, i.e. the dry reforming and combined steam reforming of methane have been expected to reduce the soot production. Our previous experimental results of microwave plasma dry reforming of methane confirmed this supposition [17]. The objective of this paper was to test the usefulness of the microwave plasma combined steam reforming of methane in mixtures of CH4, CO2 and water vapour for sootless and efficient production of hydrogen, using the same MPS as in Ref. [17]. To our knowledge, the microwave plasma combined steam reforming of methane in mixtures of CH4, CO2 and water vapour has not yet been carried out."
1,Experimental procedures,"The experimental setup, in which the same waveguide-supplied metal cylinder-based MPS (2.45 MHz) as in Refs. [17,35] was used, is presented in Fig. 1 . A calibrated directional coupler and two power meter heads were used with a digital dual-channel microwave power meter to measure incident PI and reflected PR microwave powers at the MPS input. The absorbed microwave power PA was obtained from the subtraction of PR from PI. The operating medium was a mixture of CH4, CO2 and water vapour (H2Ogas steam). The CH4 and CO2 gases as well as the water vapour were introduced into the microwave plasma region in the form of swirls. During the experiments, before their entering to the MPS, CH4, CO2 and H2Ogas were mixed together to form a gaseous mixture (CH4 + CO2 + H2Ogas), which was delivered to the MPS via four swirl forming ducts. The flow rates of CH4 swirl and CO2 swirl were 1500–9000 NL/h and 1200–9000 NL/h, respectively. A steam (H2Ogas) generator with temperature and flow rate control units was used. The steam swirl flow rate was varied in the range 620–3720 NL/h. The working gas composition was measured before entering and after exiting the microwave plasma generator using a SRI 8010C Gas Chromatograph and a Thermo Nicolet 380 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) operating in the range of 1000–4000 cm - 1. Both measuring devices were controlled by software installed on a PC. The output gas from the MPS was passed through a gas-soot separator to capture the soot produced during methane reforming. The output gas analysis was carried out at room temperature. For that purpose, a condenser was also used. The total flow rate of the output gas was measured using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique [36]."
2,Results and discussion,"The methane combined steam reforming is processed through the following reactions: (1) CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2, (2) CH4 + CO2 → 2CO + 2H2, (3) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. In this paper, the efficiency of hydrogen production via the combined steam reforming of methane is described by the following parameters: the hydrogen production rate, the energy yield of hydrogen production, the methane conversion degree and the volume concentration of hydrogen in the outlet gas. The hydrogen production rate in g(H2)/h shows how many grams of hydrogen are produced per unit of time (e.g. per 1 h). The energy yield of hydrogen production in g(H2)/kWh is the hydrogen mass produced using an energy of 1 kWh (it can also be defined as the ratio of the hydrogen production rate to the absorbed microwave power). The methane conversion degree (in %) is given by the ratio of (CH4)converted/(CH4)initial × 100%, where (CH4)initial is the initial mass of CH4, and (CH4)converted is the converted mass of CH4. The above parameters were determined on the basis of measured concentrations of methane and its conversion products. The measurements were repeated several times. The reproducibility of the measurements was good. The hydrogen production rate, the energy yield of hydrogen production, the methane conversion degree and the outlet hydrogen concentration were determined as a function of absorbed microwave power, CO2 swirl flow rate and H2Ogas swirl flow rate. The CH4 swirl flow rate was fixed at 3000 NL/h. Fig. 2 a and Fig. 2b show the hydrogen production rate, the energy yield, the methane conversion degree and hydrogen concentration at the MPS outlet as the function of absorbed microwave power. The absorbed microwave power ranged from 3.5 to 4.5 kW. The flow rates of CH4, CO2, and H2Ogas were 3000 NL/h, 3000 NL/h and 3720 NL/h, respectively. As seen from the figures, the hydrogen production rate, the methane conversion degree and the hydrogen concentration increased, while the energy yield decreased slightly with increasing absorbed microwave power. The increase of the first parameters could be explained by the increase of the electric field in the plasma region with increasing microwave power delivered to the system. This resulted in a growth of heat transfer from plasma to surrounding gas. With increasing microwave power, the plasma column elongation was observed, thus the residence time of the reactants in the plasma region increased. The results on the influence of CO2 flow rate on the hydrogen production rate, energy yield of hydrogen production, methane conversion degree and hydrogen concentration are shown in Fig. 3 a and Fig. 3b. The measurements were carried out at CH4 flow rate of 3000 NL/h, H2Ogas flow rate of 2480 NL/h, and absorbed microwave power of 4.5 kW. The results show that increasing CO2 flow rate resulted in lower values of all the tested parameters. All of them are highest for the lowest CO2 flow rate of 1200 NL/h. It seems that the best results should be obtained in the case of CO2 absence. However, owing to the microwave plasma instability the experiments with lower volume concentration of CO2 could not be performed. Increasing the CO2 flow rate at constant CH4 and H2Ogas flow rates and absorbed microwave power resulted in increasing the total gas flow rate and thus reducing the residence time of the reactants in the plasma region. Moreover, in this case a dilution effect occurs. As a result, the hydrogen volume concentration in the outlet gas is lower owing to the increased amount of the unprocessed CO2 in the outlet gas. The dependencies of the hydrogen production rate, energy yield of hydrogen production, methane conversion degree and hydrogen concentration on H2Ogas flow rate are shown in Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b. In this case, the methane combined steam reforming was performed at constant absorbed microwave power of 4 kW and CH4 and CO2 flow rates of 3000 NL/h each. Based on the results presented in Fig. 4a and b it can be seen that almost all the parameters did not depend on H2Ogas flow rate in the range of 620–3720 NL/h. The hydrogen production rate was 150 g(H2)/h, energy yield 37 g(H2)/kWh, methane conversion degree 2%, and hydrogen concentration at the MPS outlet was 21%. The lack of changes of the hydrogen production efficiency parameters with increasing H2Ogas flow rate suggests that in the tested range of H2Ogas flow rate (620–3720 NL/h), saturation of the tested parameters is observed. If that is so, more significant changes should be observed for lower values of the H2Ogas flow rate. However, more likely is a hypothesis that the contribution of H2Ogas in the hydrogen production is none or negligible. Proof of this explanation is given by thermodynamic modelling of combined steam reforming of methane, the results of which are described further below. The following gaseous products in the outlet gas volume were recorded: 35.6% of H2, 38.2% of CH4, 18.6% of CO2, 2.3% of CO and 0.8% of C2H2 at CH4, CO2 and H2Ogas flow rates of 3000 NL/h, 1200 NL/h and 2480 NL/h, respectively, and at 4.5 kW of absorbed microwave power. In these conditions, the production rate of carbon was estimated to be around 258 g/h. The diagnostics of the output gas composition showed that except for H2 and unprocessed CH4 and CO2, the remaining compounds, including carbon monoxide (CO) and acetylene (C2H2), were registered as gaseous by-products resulting from CH4 conversion in the microwave plasma. Soot deposits were found on the walls of the quartz discharge tube, but in much lower quantities than in the dry reforming [17]. In our experiment, the methane conversion degree varied from about 2% to about 22%, depending on absorbed microwave power and CO2 flow rate. The methane conversion degree increases when absorbed microwave power is increased and decreases with increase of CO2 flow rate. The results of the thermodynamic modelling, described below, suggests that the low methane conversion degree is the result of the weak stirring of the inlet gases in the quartz tube. Ensuring better stirring of the inlet gases in the quartz tube should be more beneficial. This can be achieved by re-designing of the gas inlets of the MPS. At this stage of the work, maximizing the methane conversion is not a priority. When thinking about scaling-up the process, one should be aware of low methane conversion. Recycling of unprocessed methane from the plasma generator outlet to inlet yet another time could be an accurate solution to that problem. The proposal for the recycling system is presented in Chapter 4. The comparison of the present results with the previous ones obtained by us is presented in Table 1 . In the previous experiment also the waveguide-supplied coaxial-line-based MPS was used [17], while in the present experiment the waveguide-supplied metal cylinder-based MPS was used. Table 1 clearly shows that performance of the metal cylinder-based MPS is superior than the coaxial-line-based MPS in terms of the hydrogen production rate and energy yield. Three methods of hydrogen production via methane reforming are considered, namely methane pyrolysis, methane dry reforming and methane combined steam reforming. Although pyrolysis provides the best energy yield, the significant production of soot causes problems for the stable operation of the device. The proposed combined steam reforming of methane results in better energy yield than that of dry reforming, and provides much better operation stability than pyrolysis. The comparison of the energy yield of hydrogen production for different conventional and plasma methods is given in Table 2 . Table 2 shows the results of hydrogen production not only from methane, but also from water electrolysis [4], methanol (CH3OH) [6,9] and ethanol (CH3CH2OH) [9,22]. It can be seen that the highest value of energy yield of hydrogen production was achieved in a plasmatron when a combined method of plasma-catalyst system was used [39]. Our new method presented in this paper offers the highest energy yield of hydrogen production in the catalyst-free plasma reforming methods of methane. In this respect, it is also competitive with other methods presented in Table 2. We have compared the results of our experiment concerning the concentrations of methane and gaseous products at the outlet with those obtained from thermodynamic modelling. For this purpose, the Chemical Workbench 3.1 software by Kintech Ltd., (Moscow, Russia) was used, with its Thermodynamic Equilibrium Reactor model (TER). TER is designed for the calculation of the chemical equilibrium of multi-component homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures. This thermodynamic system is considered as self-contained and closed. In this system, a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved by internal chemical and phase transformations. This means that the system is under mechanical and energetic equilibrium. The TER code uses the common principle of entropy (S) maximum for the calculation of chemical and phase composition. In accordance with this principle, the equilibrium state is characterized by the uniform distribution of thermodynamic parameters in a system volume and the chemical composition corresponds to the maximum of the probability of energy level distribution for macro particles: S = Smax for Mj = const., U = const., and ν = const., where Mj stands for j - chemical elements, U – internal energy function, and ν – specific volume. The principle of maximum entropy allows to calculate practically any thermodynamic equilibrium state. In this work, the simulation at a given input energy in the range 1000–50,000 kJ kg−1 and constant pressure 0.1 MPa was performed. The components of mixtures included in the TER model are: CH4, CH3, CH2, CH, C, CO, CO2, H, H2, OH, H2O, O, O2, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6. The modelling was carried out assuming that all compounds were well stirred. It was found that the modelling of the well mixed operating gas gives values entirely different from the experimental ones. One can suspect that the reason for this discrepancy is weak stirring in the plasma reactor (quartz tube). Indeed, a visualization of the flow using green laser light and fine particles introduced through one of the inlets showed that there is almost no gas mixing in the tube (Fig. 5 ). Thus, the modelling procedure was changed so that for each stream, i.e. methane, carbon dioxide and water vapour, a separate TER calculation was performed. The results of the modelling are presented in Fig. 6 . They refer only to those parts of substrate streams which reacted on their way from the beginning of the high temperature region to the heat exchanger placed after the quartz tube. The question is about the value of input energy for which concentrations of CH4, H2, CO2, CO and C2H2, presented in Fig. 6, should be compared with experimentally measured concentrations. In order to answer this question, a simple analysis of three reactions is sufficient. Firstly, two reactions occur separately in non-mixed streams of CH4 and CO2: (4) CH4 + 75 kJ mol−1 ⇔ C + 2H2, (5) CO2 + 284 kJ mol−1 ⇔ CO + 0.5O2. From the initial and final concentrations of methane and carbon monoxide and their initial flow rates one can calculate that in the reaction (4) from 124 mol of CH4 (3000 l h−1 at 295 K) only 37 mol are decomposed into hydrogen in an hour. At the same time, from 50 mol of CO2 (1200 l h−1 at 295 K) only 14 mol are reduced in the reaction (5) into carbon monoxide. This means that in those reactions, 5 kW of microwave power is absorbed by the plasma, which is equal to 18,987 kJ kg−1. As can be seen in Fig. 6, such input energy is sufficient for decomposition of all methane and carbon dioxide. However, reactions (4) and (5) generate too much CO and too little H2 compared to the measured concentrations. Thus, the third reaction which should be included in the analysis is the water gas shift reaction: (6) CO + H2O ⇔ CO2 + H2 + 41.2 kJ mol−1 Now, the calculated concentrations are: 38.5% CH4, 35.5% H2, 18.9% CO2 and 2.4% CO. Acetylene concentration calculated from the value obtained at the input energy of 18,987 kJ kg−1 (Fig. 6), taking into account dilution in other gaseous products and non-processed gas, is 0.9%. As it is seen, all calculated concentrations are almost the same as those resulted from the experiment. The conclusion from the simple analysis of reactions (4)–(6) is that hydrogen in the presented experiment is not produced via methane steam reforming or partial oxidation but in pyrolysis. Water vapour is involved only in the water gas shift reaction giving a portion of hydrogen. Water vapour works also as a source of heat since the initial temperature was 523 K. Owing to the contact of water vapour with two other streams of CH4 and CO2 initial temperature of gases is probably close to 387 K as the TER model predicts. Unfortunately, the real temperature inside the quartz tube during plasma operation cannot be measured. Thermocouple introduced into the gas streams or attached to the quartz tube significantly affects the electric field distribution and destabilizes the plasma. Another important conclusion from the theoretical analysis is that plasma works as a quickly switchable heat source only. It seems that active species produced in plasma do not play a significant role in the process of methane pyrolysis."
3,Idea of microwave plasma system for hydrogen production,"The results of presented investigations encourage to propose a microwave plasma hybrid system for H2 production, which allows recycling of the unprocessed CH4. The patent [40] was adapted for this purpose, i.e. for combined steam reforming. The main part of the system consists of an atmospheric pressure microwave plasma source (MPS), a soot filter (SF), a de-humidifier (De-h), a high pressure compressor (C) and a membrane separator unit (MSU), as shown in Fig. 7 . In the system, the mass flow controllers (MFCs) ensure the needed flow rates of CH4 and CO2. Steam (H2Ogas) is produced in a vaporizer (V) from liquid water. The membrane separator unit separates pure hydrogen from the gas mixture produced by the microwave plasma. The soot filter protects the separator unit from the soot deposits. Methane unprocessed in the plasma but separated by the separator is returned back to the plasma. Unprocessed CO2 is also returned back to the plasma. The products (soot C, acetylene C2H2, syngas H2 + CO) can be recovered for industrial purposes. If hydrogen is considered as a clean energy carrier, it might be proposed to supply the microwave plasma system with electric power that comes from renewable sources such as wind and sunlight. One might consider the use of this system at an existing geothermal energy source. Then, CO2 emitted by the geothermal source can be used for production of hydrogen in the proposed system."
4,Summary and conclusions,"In this paper, results on the production of hydrogen via combined steam reforming (i.e. with CO2 and water vapour) using the waveguide-supplied metal cylinder-based MPS operating at atmospheric pressure were presented. The best achieved results of hydrogen production rate and energy yield were 192 g(H2)/h and 42.9 g(H2)/kWh, respectively. It was found that the energy yield is a function of the absorbed microwave power and the flow rates of CH4, CO2 and H2Ogas. The energy yield is almost constant with increasing H2Ogas flow rate. It decreases slightly when the absorbed microwave power is increased and increases strongly with an increasing CO2 flow rate. The presented results of our experimental studies contributed to the development of microwave plasma-based technology of hydrogen production. Firstly, they indicated that hydrogen can be efficiently produced using different methane-based processes like pyrolysis [35], dry reforming [17] and combined steam reforming in the microwave plasma. Secondly, the combined steam reforming proposed in this paper is more advantageous than the pyrolysis and dry reforming. This process provides better energy yield than dry reforming, and provides much better stability in operation than pyrolysis. Apart from the comparison of different hydrogen production methods in respect to energy yield of hydrogen production given in Table 2, a direct comparison of the presented method of hydrogen production with existing ones could be made. The conventional steam methane reforming could be such a benchmark. In contrast to the conventional technology, the presented microwave plasma based method of hydrogen production from methane does not use a catalyst and is addressed to small-scale facilities such as fuel stations [41]. The second difference is the method for providing the heat necessary for the endothermic reaction characterizing steam reforming. Industrially, this reaction is carried out using an external heat source or the heat is supplied from the combustion of some of the methane feed gas and requires a relatively long run-up procedure. In the case of plasma reforming of methane, energy is provided by plasma generated using microwaves instantly, without any run-up. The conventional steam methane reforming is typically conducted at pressures up to 25 bar. Such an operating pressure promotes a high methane conversion into hydrogen. In our method, the hydrogen is produced in the atmospheric pressure microwave plasma which explains lower conversion of methane. Bearing in mind that the methane conversion degree is not satisfactory, the hybrid plasma system equipped with a separation unit, where the unprocessed methane is returned back to the plasma, was proposed. Another means of improving our plasma method was concluded from the thermodynamic modelling, the results of which suggest that ensuring better stirring of the inlet gases in the quartz tube should be more beneficial. This can be achieved by re-designing gas inlets of the MPS. At present, the conventional steam methane reforming is one of the most energy efficient ways to produce hydrogen. It has met the US Department of Energy's energy yield requirement foreseen for 2020, which for the industrial acceptable technology should be not less than 60 g(H2)/kWh [4,35]. Today, in the case of our method, the best obtained result of energy yield of hydrogen production is about 43 g(H2)/kWh, but it is still possible to improve the hydrogen production energetic parameters achieved."
