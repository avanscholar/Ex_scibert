0,Introduction,"Climate change, dwindling fossil fuel supplies, health issues resulting from fossil fuel combustion and economic security are the principal factors driving an intense global research effort into developing clean, renewable and CO2-neutral energy sources. Several full-scale biological processing facilities producing biofuels are already in place, and others are currently under development [1,2]. Biofuels are environmentally-friendly, biodegradable and they can be produced from a wide variety of renewable agricultural resources [3]. Among the different biofuels under investigation, H2 is emerging as a strong contender as a fuel of the future because it has a high energy content per unit weight and it produces water when combusted [4]. H2 can be produced from renewable resources and its impact on the environment is negligible [5]. Finally, in comparison to methane, with a heating value of 55 kJ g−1, the value for H2 (142 kJ g−1) is approximately 2.6 times greater [6]. Large-scale H2 production processes, including electrolysis, thermal and reforming technologies, use non-renewable resources such as coal and natural gas. These processes are energy intensive and in some cases, not economical. Thermal and biological methods using renewable feedstocks are currently under development. Recently, widespread attention has been focussed on anaerobic fermentation using mixed culture micro-organisms (“dark fermentation”) for H2 production. This process is attractive because it involves minimal energy input, a wide variety of cheap underutilized feedstock can be used, and microbial inocula can be obtained from industrial and municipal sources. Dark fermentation therefore combines H2 generation (value added product production) with waste utilization [7]. The number of research papers investigating dark H2 production with anaerobic bacteria has been increasing since the 1980's, but the majority of those studies have focused on using pure bacterial strains as biocatalysts [8]. However, a much better prospect for a commercially feasible process is to use mixed culture inocula that are easily obtainable from natural sources and are able to function in the presence of non-sterile feedstocks. Such inocula should be enriched with the genus Clostridium as it is known for higher H2-production [9,10]. Anaerobically digested cultures (ADC) represent one such stable mixed culture inoculant source and have been used in several H2 production studies [11–13]. However, ADC contains not only H2producers but also H2-consumers (e.g., homoacetogens, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, sulfate reducers) and others such as propionate producers and lactic acid bacteria, which results in low H2 yields [14,15]. An ADC is a complex source of mixed microbial cultures which grows in a syntrophic association [16]. In spite of this, most full-scale reactors in waste water treatment plants are operated as ‘‘black-box’’ entities, producing methane, without much information about the composition or function of the mixed microbial cultures [17]. To critically assess the dark H2 production potential of an anaerobic culture sample, and to control the H2-consumers, the mixed microbial community must be characterized for functional composition. Hence, there is a need to explore the community composition of the different wastewater treatment plant cultures through the application of biomolecular techniques to monitor the relative contribution of the relevant groups, H2-producers and H2-consumers, in bioreactor systems. Several recent studies in H2 production focus on the molecular characterization of mixed anaerobic cultures using several small subunit 16S rRNA gene based molecular techniques, cloning and sequencing, ribosomal intergenic space analysis, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and fluorescence in situ hybridization [18–26]. However, none of those studies report the comparison of microbial diversity and functional composition of the mixed microbial community present in different waste water treatment plants. The present study compares microbial diversity in ADC obtained from three waste water treatment facilities, and evaluates their suitability for H2 production. The major industries associated with waste water treatment are brewery, food processing and municipalities in Canada. Hence ADC from baby food processing, brewery and municipal wastewater treatment facilities in Ontario, Canada were selected for this study. T-RFLP is a robust and reproducible sequence diversity characterization method that has been used successfully for comparing mixed microbial communities in H2 production studies [27–29]. However, T-RFLP has some drawbacks, such as complicated profiles making phylogenetic assignments challenging [30]. To avoid such complications, and to explore the potential limitations to T-RFLP, two different analyses (clone library sequencing and T-RFLP) based on the 16S rRNA gene were used for bacterial and Archaeal communities characterization in this study. The microbial diversity data (DNA sequence-based taxonomic affiliations combined with T-RFLP results) of the bacterial communities in the different culture samples are cross-referenced to the experimentally produced gases (H2 and methane) obtained using the three culture samples to seed experimental bioreactors."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Culture samples,"2.1 Culture samples Granular and non-granular mesophilic culture samples were obtained from the following three full-scale bioreactors: a municipal wastewater treatment (CA), a baby food processing wastewater treatment facility (CB), and a brewery wastewater treatment facility (CC). Samples were transported at ambient temperature and stored at 4 °C on arrival at the University of Windsor."
3,DNA extraction,"2.2 DNA extraction A blended culture sample (0.4 mL) was added to a 2 mL sterile tube which contains approximately 250 mg of zirconia/silica beads, 0.4 mL CTAB extraction buffer [2% (wt/vol) CTAB (Sigma) in 1.4 M NaCl with 480 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0] and 0.4 mL of tris buffer saturated phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; pH 8.0). The mixture was subjected to three cycles of freezing (−80 °C) and thawing cycles. Bacterial cells in the sample were lysed by beating for 45 s in a Thermo Savant Bio 101 Fast Prep homogenizer at the 6.5 speed setting. Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clear aqueous supernatant was transferred into a sterile 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube, 2/3 vol of isopropanol was added to the extract, kept at room temperature for 10 min, then the total nucleic acid was precipitated by centrifugation (10,000 × g) at 4 °C for 20 min. 70% (v/v) ice-cold ethanol was used to wash the pelleted nucleic acids, followed by the air dry before re-suspension in 50 μL sterile milliQ water."
4,"PCR, cloning, and sequencing","2.3 PCR, cloning, and sequencing To increase the chance of capturing the 16S rRNA gene signature of all of the major micro-organisms present in the culture samples, PCR was performed using permutations of several primers specific for bacteria and Archaea 16S rRNA genes. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using forward primers B8F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) [31] and GM3F (5′ - AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG - 3′) [32] and reverse primers U1406R (5′ - ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC - 3′) [32] and EUB1492R (5′ – ACGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT - 3′) [33] in all four possible permutations. Similarly, Archaea 16S rRNA genes were amplified with forward primers A2F (5′ – TTCCGGTTGATCCYGCCGGA - 3′) and ARCH20F (5′ – TTCCGGTTGATCCYGCCRG - 3′) [34] with reverse primers U1406R (5′ – ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC - 3′) [35] and Uni1392R (5′ – ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC - 3′) [36]. PCR mixtures (25 μL) containing 10.2 mM Tris buffer, 50 mM KCl, 2% 2.3 mM MgCl2, DMSO, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 5 mg BSA, 0.2 mM of each primer, and 0.5 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) were cycled as follows: 95 °C for 5 min followed by; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57.5 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 4 min, with a final elongation step of 72 °C for 7 min. QIAquick spin columns (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to purify the PCR products. Purified PCR products were then ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and used to transform E. coli JM109 host bacterial cells. Using pGEM-T-specific primers M-13F (5′ – GTAAAACGACGGCCAG - 3′) and M-13R (5′ – CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC - 3′) inserts were amplified in the colonies by colony PCR. PCR mixtures were as described above, and PCR conditions used for the amplification are as follows: 94 °C for 5 min followed by; 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 4 min, for 30 cycles with a 72 °C for 7 min final elongation step. Each clone from library with inserts of the expected length was selected and Big Dye version 3 cycle sequencing reactions (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI3100 PRISM Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) were used to determine the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences. Sequencing reactions used M-13 forward and reverse primers. Sequence editing and contiguous sequence assembly were conducted using CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA)."
5,Sequence analyses,"2.4 Sequence analyses All 16S rRNA gene sequences were checked for chimeras using Bellerophon (an online analysis program at http://foo.maths.uq.edu.au/∼huber/bellerophon.pl) [37]. All sequences were subjected to a BLAST search, and analyzed for taxonomic affinity using RDP Analysis Tools (Ribosomal Database Project-II, Release 9 at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp) and taxonomically assigned according to the RDP classifier [38]. Species richness and diversity statistics were also calculated using FastGroupII, an online tool for the investigation of microbial community biodiversity (http://biome.sdsu.edu/fastgroup/fg_tools.htm) [39], including the Chao, and the Shannon–Wiener diversity index. Chao1 (Schao1 = Sobs+(n1 2/2n2)) is a simple nonparametric estimator of the minimum richness (i.e. number of ribotypes) in a sample, where Sobs is the observed number of ribotypes and n1 and n2 are the number of ribotypes observed either once or twice, respectively [39]. The Shannon-Wiener index brings two quantifiable measures together: species abundance (how evenly distributed the numbers of individual species) and the species richness (number of species within the community) [39]. The Shannon-Wiener species diversity index (H′) typically ranges between 1.5 (low species richness and evenness) and 3.5 (high species evenness and richness) though values beyond these limits may be encountered [40]. The Shannon-Wiener index H′ is calculated using equation (1) where 3.322 = conversion factor from base 10 to base 2, N = total # individuals in all species and N i = # of individuals in each species. (1) H ′ = 3.322 [ log N − ∑ N i ( log N i ) N ] Diversity coverage was calculated using Goods' formula C = [ 1 − ( n / N ) ] × 100 Where ‘N’ is the total number of sequences and ‘n’ is the number of species represented by one clone (single-clone OTUs) [41]. The sequences for the clones from this study were deposited in EMBL with accession numbers FR775399-FR775423, FR832406-FR832418 and FR828702-FR828802."
6,Phylogenetic analyses,"2.5 Phylogenetic analyses To identify bacterial clones affiliated to known H2-producing or consuming organisms and Archaea strains affiliated to methanogens, three phylogenetic trees were constructed with full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences of all OTUs recovered from the three culture samples. The trees also included full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences of several experimentally demonstrated H2-producing or -consuming bacterial strains and Archaea strains downloaded from the Ribosomal Database Project (Release 9; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp). Multiple alignment analyses were performed with CLUSTAL X [42]. Only common 16S rRNA gene regions and parsimony informative sites were included in the analysis. All sequence regions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated, but the sequence was retained for analysis. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [43] with the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates [44]. Branches reproduced in less than 50% of the bootstrap replicates were collapsed. Out of the 140 OTU sequences analysed by 16S rRNA gene analysis, 39 nucleotide sequences closely related to the H2-producers, H2-consumers, methanogens were involved in the tree construction. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [45]."
7,PCR and T-RFLP profiling,"2.6 PCR and T-RFLP profiling Nested PCR of the microbial community 16S rRNA gene was performed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis with the 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) labeled 5′ end of the forward primers. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the B8F (5′ - AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG - 3′) [31] and Eub-539R (5′ – ATCGTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGC - 3′). Similarly, Archaea 16S rRNA genes were amplified with primers Arc-112F (5′ – GCTCAGTAACACGTGG - 3′) and Arc-533R (5′ – TTACCGCGGCGGCTGGCA - 3′). PCR mixtures (25 μL) containing 10.2 mM Tris buffer, 2.3 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 2% DMSO, 5 mg BSA, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 mM of each primer, and 0.5 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) were cycled as follows: 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s, with a final elongation step of 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were purified using QIAquick spin columns (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The purified product (3.0 μL) was digested with 2.5 U of various restriction enzymes (HinfI, HaeIII, HhaI and MspI) in a total volume of 20 μL for 2 h at 37 °C. The restriction enzymes were selected because they produce several short terminal restriction fragments (TRFs; <300 bases) for most bacteria. The restriction digest products (1 μL) were mixed with 3 μL of stop solution (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE), and samples along with size markers (50-700 base pairs, LI-COR, Inc.) were denatured at 95 °C for 2 min followed by rapid chilling on ice. The denatured samples were loaded onto a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel (KBPlus™, LI-Cor, Inc.), and size-separated by electrophoresis (2.5 h at 1500 V, 35 mA, 35 W, 45 °C) using a DNA Analyser (Model 4300L, LI-Cor, Inc). The software Gene ImagIR 4.05 (Scanalytics, Inc., Rockville, MD) was used to estimate the fragment sizes and relative abundances (band intensity)."
8,Phylogenetic assignment of TRFs,2.7 Phylogenetic assignment of TRFs The T-RFLP data generated by the digestion of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes from culture samples were formatted for Phylogenetic Assignment Tool (PAT; https://secure.limnology.wisc.edu/trflp/) and analyzed online using default fragment bin tolerance window settings. Phylogenetic assignment was performed using a modified database consisting of the default database generated from MiCA (http://mica.ibest.uidaho.edu/) plus experimentally determined terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) for micro-organisms identified from the 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis performed here. Clones from this study were subjected to the virtual TRF simulations; lengths of the T-RFs were examined manually and counted. The actual T-RFs lengths obtained from the samples of this study were compared with the predicted T-RFs.
9,Statistical comparison of 16s rRNA gene based T-RFLP and gene clone library analysis,"2.8 Statistical comparison of 16s rRNA gene based T-RFLP and gene clone library analysis Spearman's Rank correlation was used to compare the 16s rRNA based methods (T-RFLP and gene clone library) for all the three different microbial samples (CA, CB and CC). The composition of the microbial communities (percentage of each species in eubacteria and Archaea; Table 1 ) as determined by the two methods were used to estimate the agreement based on the correlation coefficient (r value)."
10,Experimental design for hydrogen and methane production,"2.9 Experimental design for hydrogen and methane production Experiments were conducted with three different cultures CA, CB, CC at an initial pH 7.6 and pH 5.0 using batch reactors (160 mL serum bottles). The batch reactors consisted of 2000 mg L−1 VSS plus 5000 mg L−1 glucose as substrate. The composition of the basal medium used for dilution of culture was adapted from Weigant and Lettinga [46] and Alosta et al. [47], had a pH of 8.2–8.0 and contained the following constituents (mg L−1 of distilled water): NH4HCO3, 70; KCl, 25; (NH4)2SO4, 10; yeast extract, 10; K2HPO4, 14; NaHCO3, 6000; FeCl2.4H2O, 2; MgCl2.4H2O, 9; EDTA, 1; resazurin, 1; CoCl2.6H2O, 0.15; MnCl2.4H2O, 0.5; Na2SeO3, 0.1; ZnCl2, 0.05; (NH4)6MoO7.4H2O, 0.09; NiCl2.6H2O, 0.05; H3BO3, 0.05; and CuCl2.2H2O, 0.03. Bottle preparation was carried out according the procedure explained in Chowdaury et al. [48]. Briefly COY anaerobic chamber under a 70–75% N2/20–25% CO2 atmosphere containing approximately 1% H2, was used for the bottle preparation. Culture and basal a total volume of 50 mL was added to the bottle, then telfon-lined silicone rubber septa and aluminum caps were used to seal the bottles. An orbital shaker (Lab Line Instruments Model 3520, Iowa) was used to agitate the bottles at 200 rpm, 37 ± 1 °C over the duration of the study. 2 mL of 50,000 mg L−1 stock glucose was injected into the bottles by replacing the basal medium on day 0. All the experiments were conducted in triplicate."
11,Gas analysis,"2.10 Gas analysis After the injection of sugars (5000 mg L−1), headspace samples were withdrawn at specified intervals over 4 days and analyzed for H2 and methane. The gas analysis to evaluate H2 and methane production at initial pH 5.0 and pH 7.6 was performed in accordance with previous work reported by Chowdaury et al. [48]. Briefly, H2, methane and CO2 were analysed using gas chromatography (GC) by removing the 25 μL of bottle headspace gas samples. The detection limits for methane and H2 for 25 μL samples were and 0.0064 kPa (10 μL/160 mL bottle) and 0.0032 kPa (5 μL/160 mL bottle), respectively."
12,Results,
13,Sequence analyses,"3.1 Sequence analyses 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on the 74 Archaea and 164 bacterial clones from cultures obtained from the municipal wastewater treatment facility (CA), 50 Archaea and 114 bacterial clones from a baby food plant waste treatment facility (CB), and 17 Archaea and 124 bacterial clones from a brewery wastewater treatment facility (CC). Among them, CA had 9 unique Archaea and 61 bacterial sequences designated as operational taxonomical units (OTUs), CB had 3 Archaea and 25 bacterial OTUs and CC had 2 Archaea and 40 bacterial OTUs. The taxonomic affiliation of the closest relatives based on NCBI's BLAST analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was used to assign each clone to a phylogenetic group. The proportional composition of each group within the three culture samples CA, CB and CC is provided in Table 1. Sequence analyses of the bacterial domain revealed various proportions of several dominant groups in three culture samples. More than 90% of the sequences in each culture sample were affiliated with seven phyla: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Thermotogae, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and uncultured bacteria. Several other phylogenetic groups representing less than 5% of the sequences were present in only two culture samples, including Planctomycetes, which was present in the CA and CC samples. A third group that constituted less than 5% of the clones was present only in one culture sample, including Lentisphaerae (CC) and TMV 7 (CA). Four major groups (Chloroflexi, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes, and δ-Proteobacteria) which were present in all three culture samples accounted for more than 60% of the total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in CB and CC but only 35% in the CA culture sample; the majority (40%) of OTUs in the CA culture could be attributed to uncultured bacteria. The Archaea clones contained sequences representative of the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla; both were present in CA but only the latter was found in CB and CC. The majority (12 out of 14) of the total Archaeal OTUs were Euryarchaeota clones with the remainder representing Crenarchaeota clones, and were present only in the CA culture. Methanomicrobia as the dominant group in all three culture samples under investigation. The two diversity estimates (Chao1 and Shannon-Wiener indices) were used to reflect the total microbial richness and diversity in each culture sample based on the observed OTUs. Both indices showed that the three cultures have substantial richness and well-diversified bacterial communities, whereas an opposite trend was observed for Archaea (Table 2 ). It is no surprise that the species richness estimates for bacteria are much greater than for the Archaea community [49]. The H′ index for the bacterial community was estimated to be 3.67 for CA followed by 3.42 and 3.16 for CC and CB cultures (Table 2). CA showed greater diversity than the CB and CC cultures in the bacteria and Archaea groups (Table 2). This confirms that the microbial communities obtained from the wastewater treatment facility was more diversified than those from the ethanol and food processing cultures. Perhaps this might be due to wider variety of organic chemical substrates treated at the wastewater treatment facility."
14,Comparison of the inferred bacterial and archeal functional groups for the three anaerobic culture samples,"3.2 Comparison of the inferred bacterial and archeal functional groups for the three anaerobic culture samples Although our phylogenetic comparisons of the microbial composition of the three culture samples provide an overview of relative diversity and composition, a functional comparison associated with the bacterial and Archaea species may be of greater value for explaining H2 and methane production differences. Even though assigning function or physiology based on 16S rRNA gene sequences may be biased, our inferred functional assignment is likely robust because the 16S rRNA gene sequences were very closely related (≥95%) to those of cultured, well-characterized microbial species. Two metabolic categories for Archaea and three metabolic categories for bacteria were assigned based on sequence similarity: fermenters, H2-producers and H2 consumers for bacteria; methanogens and sulphur reducers for Archaea. This approach has been used previously: Penner et al. [50], similarly assigned bacterial functional groups based on 16S rRNA in uncultured coal and long-term enrichment cultures. The sequences related to the Bacteroidetes, Anaaerolineae, Clostridiales, Bacilli, Thermotega which are closely related to the H2-producers were classified as H2-producers and fermenters (Fig.1, Table 3 ). The sequences which are closely related to the H2-consumers (Fig. 2 , Table 4 ) such as some of the proteobacteria, unclassified bacteria and candidate division TM7 as recently reported by [51] are capable of CO2 fixation through the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway and are classified as H2-consumers. Some facultative fermenting microbes belonging to the groups Thermotega, Clostridiales and Bacteroidetes may show overlap between H2-producers and H2–consumers due to their behaviour as homoacetogens by consuming H2 [50]. However, during fermentation, H2 consumption by homoacteogens begins only after the levels have accumulated to concentrations near saturation [53,54]. Hence, homoacetogenic action can be avoided by the continuous release of H2 production or by maintaining the low H2 partial pressures. Methanobacteria and Methanomicrobia are a class of Euryarchaeota and were classified under methanogenic bacteria, as they are known to produce methane by utilizing carbon dioxide and H2 [55]. Thermoprotei are classified under Crenarchaeota while Thermoplasmata are placed under Euryarchaeota. Both Thermoprotei and Thermoplasmata were grouped into the sulphur reducers, since Thermoplasmata thrives in acidic and high-temperature environments. Both of these organisms are facultative anaerobes and respire using sulfur plus organic carbon. Thermoprotei is a group of prokaryotes that generally survive in sulfur-rich hot springs and generate energy by metabolizing sulphur. Phylogenetic trees showing how putative H2-producing and H2-consuming OTUs recovered from the three culture samples are affiliated to several experimentally demonstrated H2-producing and H2-consuming bacterial strains are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The representative unique sequences belonging to putative H2-producing bacteria fell into three clusters (clades) affiliated with three phyla (Thermotogae, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Fig. 1). Unique sequences recovered belonging to H2-producing bacteria in the phylum Thermotogae were present in all three culture samples (CA (N = 1), CB (N = 1), and CC (N = 1)). This number was observed to be CA (N = 3), CB (N = 1), and CC (N = 2) for phylum Firmicutes, and CA (N = 2), in phylum Actinobacteria. Likewise, sequences belonging to H2-consuming bacteria fell into six clusters (clades) affiliated with six phyla (Thermotogae, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria; Fig. 2). Phylum Thermotogea representative sequences belonging to H2-consuming species were present in two culture samples; CA (N = 1) and CB (N = 1). The number of recovered sequences were CA (N = 4) and CC (N = 1) for Actinobacteria, CA (N = 1) and CC (N = 1) for Firmicutes. For phylum Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria, H2-consuming bacteria species were present in only CA (N = 1, 1 and 4 respectively). While all the OTUs that cluster with bacterial 16S sequences belonging to authentic H2-producing micro-organisms may be assumed to produce H2, several of these OTUs (CC-29, CA-181, and CA-52; Figs. 1 and 2) also clustered with 16S rRNA sequences of H2-consuming bacteria belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. The phylogenetic tree of Archaea (Fig. 3 ) showed that 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from the three culture samples were related to organisms belonging to phylum Euryarchaeota (containing hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens) and phylum Crenarchaeota that contain sulphur reducers. The 16S rRNA Archaea sequences recovered from the three culture samples are representative of both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic clades. However, more than 80% of the recovered sequences were acetoclastic in both CB and CC culture samples, while this value was less than 40% for CA culture sample."
15,T-RFLP analysis of culture samples,"3.3 T-RFLP analysis of culture samples The 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP and clone library analyses of microbial community structure in the culture samples are summarized in Fig. 4 (a, b, c). Both methods recovered similar dominant species, also predicted similar levels of relative diversity among the three cultures. The agreement between the two methods (T-RFLP and gene clone library) based on the 16s rRNA gene analysis and Spearman's Rank correlation was high: the correlation coefficient (r) values for CA, CB and CC were 0.87, 0.82 and 0.91 respectively. However, in the 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis, α-Proteobacteria was not detected in any of the cultures, whereas in the T-RFLP analysis it was detected in all three samples. In the CB and CC samples, γ-Proteobacteria and Bacilli were detected using T-RFLP; however, they were not detected in the 16S rRNA gene clone library (Fig. 4 a, b and c). The number of deduced OTUs present in the different culture samples estimated using T-RFLP and the 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis is summarized in Fig. 5 . The CA sample contained more OTUs than the CB and CC samples when bacteria- or Archaea-specific primers were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Also, the microbial diversity observed using the T-RFLP method was greater in all the samples when compared to the 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis. Identification of individual putative H2-producing and H2-consuming bacterial species using the two methods is summarized in Tables 3and 4. Some H2-producing and H2-consuming microbial species that were identified using the 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis were not confirmed by the PCR-based T-RFLP analysis. Such discrepancies in fragment length between the predicted and experimental value for a known sequence have been noted by other researchers [56–58]. Of the four restriction enzymes (HinfI, HaeIII, HhaI, and MspI) used in the T-RFLP analysis, the greatest correlation between virtual (theoretical) digested and experimental fragment results were detected with the HhaI and HaeIII enzymes followed by MspI and HinfI (Tables 3 and 4)."
16,Hydrogen and methane production using three culture samples,"3.4 Hydrogen and methane production using three culture samples Six batches of dark fermentation experiments (in triplicate) were performed by inoculating the three samples (CA, CB, and CC) into media at pH 5.0 and pH 7.6. At pH 5.0, CB and CC produced higher H2 yields when compared to CA (Fig. 6 a). This observation is in accordance with the percent H2 producers and consumers shown in Fig. 6b. Similarly, at pH 7.6, CB and CC produced 1.68 ± 0.13 and 1.47 ± 0.11 mol CH4.mol−1 glucose, respectively, whereas for CA the methane yield was 30% less when compared to CB and CC (Fig. 6c). Even though the microbial diversity in CC and CB was lower than the CA, methane and H2 yields were higher CC and CB. The higher methane yield might be due to the presence of a higher percentage of the methanogens (Fig. 6d), which are generally active at pH 7.6 and inactivated at pH values less than 5.0. The higher H2 yield in CB and CC cultures at low pH may be due to the inhibition of the methanogens [59], the presence of a higher percent of active fermenters and H2 producers in CB and CC when compared to CA (Fig. 6d)."
17,Discussion,"The results of the 16S rRNA gene targeted profiling suggested that both obligate (phyla Thermotogae and Firmicutes) and facultative (phylum Actinobacteria) bacteria were the principal H2-producing phyla present in the cultures (included in clades I, II and III; Fig. 1). H2 consumers were more diverse, belonging to six bacterial phyla (Thermotogae, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Protobacteria and Defferibacteres) and two Archaeal phyla (Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota). The predominant H2-consuming bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered were detected in clade IV (which are closely related to homoacetogens such as Eubacterium and Acetobacterium), clade V (closely related to Bacteroidetes), clade VII (Proteobacteria) and clade VIII (uncultured bacteria which are closely related to Desulfovibrio, bacteria which reduces sulphates by consuming the H2). Clade IX which is closely related to the Thermotogae and Treponema primitia is an H2 consuming CO2-reducing homoacetogen [60]. Clade VI (Actinobacteria) is very closely related to the Propioibacteriaceae which as propionate producing bacteria is a major obstacle in methane or H2 producing anaerobic bioreactors. Both the 16S rRNA gene targeted clone profiling and the T-RFLP analyses indicated that the CA culture has a more diverse microbial community than the CB and CC cultures. The CA culture which was sampled from a municipal waste water treatment facility is expected to utilize a wide variety of organic chemicals in comparison to the CB and CC cultures. On the other hand, CB and CC cultures receive a fairly uniform organic feed and the diversity of these cultures is expected to be lower than the CA culture. According to reports by Kocherginskaya et al. [61], and Tajima et al. [62], a change in the organic feed stream can change the diversity of the resulting bacterial community. In this study, the presumptive phylogeny of the 16S rRNA gene based T-RFs were in good agreement with the clone library sequences. The experimental and virtual digest results were also in good agreement. For example, terminal restriction fragments generated by the bacterial PCR with all the enzymes used (HaeIII, HhaI, HinfI and MspI) correlated with the predicted restriction fragments (RFs) of CA-52 and CA-145 (Table 3). Some of the mismatched results with MspI and HinfI in Tables 3 and 4 may be due to the generation of terminal restriction fragments shorter than 50 bp. To avoid the background noise caused by the primer-dimer, bands below 50 bp were not considered for analysis in this study. Alternatively, the differences could be due to the incomplete digestion of the PCR product [30,63]. To overcome these potential limitations, more than one restriction enzyme was used in this study and the results from combining the data sets were used in the phylogenetic assignment. Hydrogen production studies of the three cultures revealed that the CA culture has a relatively low yield compared to the CB and CC cultures (Fig. 6a). To understand the reason behind the variation in the H2 yields among the cultures, their microbial diversity was compared in terms of the relative abundance of inferred fermenters, H2-producers and H2-consumers. The inferred functional microbial classification data were in good agreement with the experimental H2 yields. In CA culture, 28% of the community were H2-consumers, while 28% was made up of fermentors and H2-consumers combined while in the CB and CC cultures, the number of H2 consumers was relatively minimal and maximum for the H2-producers (Fig. 6b). Even though the H2-consumer proportion was elevated in the CA culture, the methane yields were much lower in CA when compared to the CB and CC cultures (Fig. 6c). The low methane yields in the CA culture may be due to the presence of sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). SRBs compete with methanogens (and with syntrophic methanogens) for their common substrates, H2 and acetate [64]. SRBs, hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens consume H2 but only hydrogenotrophic methanogens produce methane directly from H2. In comparison, homoacetogens produce acetate from H2 plus CO2 and acetoclastic methanogens produce methane from acetate. In the case of SRBs, they consume H2 and reduce sulphate. When considering H2 as a substrate, H2-utilizing SRBs out compete hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens because of their lower Km values (higher affinity) [65]. To better understand the variation in the methane production data, the Archaea 16S rRNA gene clone library and the T-RFLP results were examined for the three cultures. Both the 16S rRNA gene based characterization of Archaea for culture CB, identified 100% methanogens (Methanomicrobia), while the CC culture 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed 45% Methanobacteria and 55% Methanomicrobia, with a slight variation in proportions between the two methods (Table 1). However, the CA culture 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed 54% Thermoprotei, 36% Methanomicrobia, and 10% Thermoplasmata (Fig. 6d). Both Methanobacetria and Methanomicrobia are classified under methanogenic Archaea and known to grow on H2 and CO2 with an optimum pH between 6.6 and 7.3 [55]. Thermoprotei are known to use H2 as a source of electrons to reduce sulfur to H2S as the energy source required to synthesize their food from CO2. The low proportion of the methanogens in the CA might be due to the competition of uncultured bacteria closely related to sulphate reducing Desulfovibrio group as shown in the clade VIII in (Fig. 2). In the CB and CC cultures, the methanogen proportion is four fold higher that in the CA culture. This trend is in strong agreement with the lower methane yields observed for CA in comparison to the higher yields in CB and CC (Fig. 6c)."
18,Conclusions,"In this study, we reported the microbial characterization of three different anaerobic cultures and an assessment of their potential for H2 production. This study showed how the H2-consumers, H2-producers and methanogens are distributed in different anaerobic communities and how their composition can play a major role in influencing the of H2 and methane yields. In addition, the microbial community analysis methods based on the 16S rRNA gene (T-RFLP and clone library sequencing) resulted in the identification of similar dominant microbial groups with a Spearman's Rank correlation r value ranging from 0.82 to 0.91. The results obtained confirmed that T-RFLP is a reproducible methodology and robust for the quick determination of variations in mixed microbial cultures in different samples. Overall, our results showed that the selection of the source of mixed anaerobic culture is critical for optimizing H2 and methane production and the choice of culture may explain the failure of some anaerobic bioreactors. Our work describes the role of microbial anaerobic community dynamics and thus, represents an important contribution to the operation of bioreactor technologies used for producing biofuels such as H2."
