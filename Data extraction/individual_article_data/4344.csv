0,Introduction,"While anaerobic digestion of organic wastes mainly aims at methane production, there has been substantial emergence that focuses on more targeted reactions to generate biomaterials of a higher value [1], such as fatty acids, ethanol, and butanol. The produced short-chain fatty acids (acetate (C2) and butyrate (C4)) are important precursors for biofuel production [2–4]. Liquid biofuels (e.g., ethanol and butanol) offer significant advantages in comparison with gas products (H2 and CH4), which include a high energy intensity and easy storage and transportation [4]. Among them, medium-chain fatty acids (e.g., caproate (C6) and caprylate (C8)), which possess a chain of 6–12 carbons and a lower oxygen/carbon ratio than acetate and ethanol, are generally regarded as more valuable industrial commodities and more suitable precursors for liquid biofuels or biochemicals. Therefore, other than a valorisation process, the conversion of organic wastes to fatty acids also represents an important alternative to deal with the growing global energy demand. However, direct and complete biological conversion of organic wastes is difficult due to the significant amount of non-biodegradable matter contained, such as lignin which accounts for 10–35% of the entire biomass [5–7]. The lignin content of biomass could be effectively utilized through gasification, which is commonly practiced for resource recovery and yields synthetic gas (syngas) as a mixture of H2, CO, and CO2. Syngas could then be used further as a feed stock for the production of useful biochemicals such as acetate and butyrate by either chemically-catalysed conversion (e.g., Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis) or biological conversion routes (known as syngas fermentation) [8]. Nevertheless, FT synthesis is still not popularized and widely adopted due to its process complexity and relatively low efficiency. In contrast, biologically-catalysed generation of liquid biofuels or biochemicals via syngas fermentation is more efficient and requires less energy input [9]. Other merits include a higher tolerance for impurities such as sulfur compounds, a wider range of usable H2, CO, and CO2 mixture, and a lower operating temperature and pressure [10]. So far, the production of acetate from syngas (e.g., CO2 and H2) has been well studied [11–13], and the produced acetate could be converted to longer carboxylates such as butyrate and caproate through microbially-mediated chain elongation [14,15]. Chain elongation is achieved through the reverse β-oxidation pathway, which includes acetate elongation to butyrate via acetyl-CoA and butyrate elongation to caproate via butyl-CoA [15,16]. Clostridium kluyveri is the best-known microbe capable of carrying out the well described reverse β-oxidation pathway [16–18]. Chain elongation processes not only add value to the final fermentation products but also improve their downstream processing, which remains a key issue to be addressed for syngas fermentation [1]. Pervaporation, electrodialysis, and solvent based extraction [19] are commonly proposed to refine the mixed products from syngas fermentation, and larger molecular weight products are generally more readily extracted and separated [20]. Chain elongation is therefore highly desired in order to reduce the operational cost associated with syngas fermentation. One of the main challenges that restrict the application of syngas fermentation is the low solubility of hydrogen in the water phase as well as its poor gas-to-liquid mass transfer efficiency and rate [21], which govern the process rate. Mechanical augmentation such as gas circulation and liquid agitation could potentially promote the gas transfer process in fermentation reactors. However, these techniques are usually energy-intensive and faced with scale-up difficulties. The membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) technology is particularly suitable for delivering gas with low solubility (e.g., H2 and CH4), which has been applied to hydrogen-based denitrification [22,23] and methane-based denitrification [24–27], and could be utilized similarly for syngas fermentation. Since the gaseous substrate (i.e., syngas in this case) is supplied directly through gas-permeable and bubbleless membranes, its transfer could be enhanced greatly and controlled flexibly by pressure adjustment. Functional microorganisms could naturally attach to and proliferate on the membrane surface, and the produced fatty acids (e.g., C2, C4, and/or C6) could diffuse to the bulk liquid and be collected afterwards, as delineated in Fig. 1 . The decoupling of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and solid retention time (SRT) ensures a high biomass concentration, which also ensures good resilience of the MBfR to environmental changes. Proving this concept, Zhang et al. [4,13] observed high productions of fatty acids (C2, C4, and/or C6) in the MBfRs fed with syngas containing 60% H2 and 40% CO2. However, more work is of imperative need, in order to render a more comprehensive understanding of this technology as well as to better facilitate its future implementation. Mathematical modeling serves as a useful and reliable tool to probe into emerging technologies and significantly reduces the workload related to process evaluation or optimization. To our knowledge, mathematical model is currently not available to describe syngas fermentation processes for fatty acids production, especially in MBfR systems. Therefore, in this work, we developed and tested a modeling approach which integrates multiple production pathways of fatty acids (i.e., C2, C4, and C6) using reported mixed culture experimental data obtained from a lab-scale MBfR fed with 60% H2 and 40% CO2. With the developed model, the impacts of key process parameters (i.e., gas supply and HRT) on the performance of the MBfR converting H2/CO2 to fatty acids were then investigated. The results of this work are expected to provide useful information for a better understanding and further applications of this MBfR technology for syngas fermentation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Model development,"2.1 Model development Production of both short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids from H2 and CO2 by mixed microbial culture in a hollow-fiber MBfR has previously been demonstrated experimentally [4]. In the MBfR, H2 and CO2 were supplied through gas-permeable membranes, which also served as biofilm support, to the base of the biofilm, as shown in Fig. 1. The hydrogen was for 100% utilized within the biofilms attached on the outer surface of the hollow-fiber membrane. Based on the experimental observations and the known metabolisms, Zhang et al. [4] revealed the production of acetate, butyrate, and caproate from syngas containing 60% H2 and 40% CO2 could be described by Eqs. (1)–(4): (1) 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → C 2 H 3 O 2 - + H + + 2 H 2 O ( at pH 7.0 , Δ G 0 ′ = - 95 kJ mol - 1 ) (2) C 2 H 3 O 2 - + 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → C 4 H 7 O 2 - + 4 H 2 O ( at pH 7.0 , Δ G 0 ′ = - 143 kJ mol - 1 ) (3) 3 C 2 H 3 O 2 - + 2 H + + 4 H 2 → C 6 H 11 O 2 - + 4 H 2 O ( at pH 7.0 , Δ G 0 ′ = - 97 kJ mol - 1 ) (4) C 4 H 7 O 2 - + 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → C 6 H 11 O 2 - + 4 H 2 O ( at pH 7.0 , Δ G 0 ′ = - 143 kJ mol - 1 ) It should be noted that caproate could be elongated from either acetate (Eq. (3)) or butyrate (Eq. (4)) or both. However, the Gibbs free energy of Eq. (4) (−143kJmol−1) is higher than that of Eq. (3) (−97kJmol−1) [4], which means Eq. (4) would be favoured under same condition. This thermodynamic approach has been widely adopted to determine the most significant and feasible pathways involved in chain elongation [14,16,28]. Moreover, sequential chain elongation from acetate to caproate via butyrate has been well studied and clearly defined for Clostridium kluyveri [14,29]. Therefore, for simplicity, chain elongation for caproate production was assumed to only follow Eq. (4) in this work. The biochemical reaction model was therefore developed based on the pathways indicated in Eqs. (1), (2), and (4). The possible ethanol production from CO2 and H2 was not included in the model due to the undetected ethanol concentration in the liquid phase of the experimental MBfR [4]. Given that most of the identified microorganisms dominating the biofilm of the experimental MBfR were affiliated with the genus of Clostridium (57.1%, based on the number of 16S rRNA gene clones) [4], which have been well categorized as capable of producing acetate, butyrate, and/or caproate from H2 and CO2, only one functional microorganism group was considered in the developed model. All with H2 as the electron donor, the three biochemical reactions for fatty acids production (based on Eqs. (1), (2), and (4)) were postulated to have the same yield, which links substrate consumption to biomass growth. This simplified approach could decrease the model complexity and avoid over-parameterisation, and has been well accepted and widely applied to produce reliable results. Referring to Eqs. (1), (2), and (4), the molar H2/CO2 ratio of 3:2 in the syngas of the experimental MBfR meant that CO2 was always in excessive supply, which was confirmed by the accumulated CO2 content in the MBfR headspace [4]. Though an indispensable substrate, CO2 was not included in the model, in view of its non-limiting effect on the fermentation processes. Monod equations were applied to describe the rate of each reaction, with non-competitive inhibition functions incorporated to depict the inhibition effects of non-substrate fatty acids. Eqs. (5)–(7) show the Monod-based process rate equations for acetate (RAc ), butyrate (RBu ), and caproate (RCa ) production, respectively. The stoichiometric relationships between substrates and products were formulated based on the characteristics of each reaction, with continuity checking performed to ensure correct mass balance of all components. The developed model integrates the relationships among four soluble species, i.e., hydrogen (SH 2), acetate (SAc ), butyrate (SBu ), and caproate (SCa ), and two particulate species, i.e., functional biomass (XB ), and inert biomass (XI ). Table 1 lists the definitions, values, units, and sources of all parameters involved, while Table 2 details the stoichiometric and kinetic matrix of the developed model.

3,Experimental data acquisition,"2.2 Experimental data acquisition The experimental data from the MBfR performing syngas fermentation reported by Zhang et al. [4] were used to test the developed model. The MBfR had a working volume of 2.4×10−4 m3 and was inoculated with 4×10−5 m3 mixed culture from a mesophilic methane production reactor. Syngas containing 60% H2 and 40% CO2 was fed constantly at 0.4atm (inlet pressure) through gas-permeable hollow fiber membranes, the total surface area of which was 0.11m2. The MBfR was operated in batch mode with no continuous feeding flow to the bulk liquid during the experiment. The bulk liquid was continuously recirculated at 0.5Lmin−1. To inhibit the existence of methanogenesis, 10mmolL−1 bromoethane sulfonate (BES) was initially added to the MBfR with pH manually controlled at 6.0±0.2 with 2M NaOH. The temperature was maintained at 35±1°C using a water bath. The composition of the bulk liquid is specified in Zhang et al. [4]. During the experiment, liquid samples were periodically taken from the MBfR to detect the cumulative contents of fatty acids and ethanol on a Gas Chromatograph (Agilent 7890, CA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 10m×0.53mm HP-FFAP fused-silica capillary column. The contents of H2, CO2, and CH4 in the headspace of the MBfR were determined on a Gas Chromatograph (Lunan model SP7890, CN) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.5m stainless steel column packed with 5Å molecular sieve. More detailed information about the reactor operation and analytical methods could be found in Zhang et al. [4]."
4,Model testing and simulations,"2.3 Model testing and simulations The model was implemented on the software AQUASIM 2.1d [30] to simulate the MBfR for syngas fermentation. AQUASIM is equipped with functions of simulating the complicated microbial reactions and mass transfer processes in biofilm-based systems, and has been proved capable of modeling real MBfRs [25,27]. The MBfR was configured according to the experimental setup and modeled to consist of a completely mixed gas compartment (representing the membrane lumen operated) and a biofilm compartment (containing the biofilm and bulk liquid). The syngas supply to the biofilm was simulated through a diffusive link which connected the gas compartment to the base of the biofilm. The gaseous concentration of syngas in the gas compartment was jointly regulated by the gas flow rate and the gas pressure applied. The flux of syngas L from the gas to the biofilm matrix compartment through the membrane was modeled using the following equation. (8) L = k S g H - S l where Sg and Sl are the syngas concentrations in the gas and biofilm matrix compartments (gm−3), respectively, k is the overall mass transfer coefficient (md−1), and H is the Henry’s law constant (molm−3 gas/molm−3 liquid) [31]. Due to the reported unavailability of parameters related to chain elongation processes, the parameters associated with butyrate and caproate production, including μBu (maximum uptake rate for butyrate production), μCa (maximum uptake rate for caproate production), KAc (acetate affinity constant), and KBu (butyrate affinity constant), were estimated in this work, while the remaining parameters were directly adopted from Ni et al. [11]. This approach is generally acceptable and widely adopted for modeling research, and the model validity is ensured provided that a good match between experimental data and model predictions is obtained. The four parameter values were estimated through minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the experimental measurements and the model predictions for fatty acids production profiles including acetate, butyrate, and caproate. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to evaluate the uncertainty of the four estimated parameters through generating response profiles of output to changes in parameter values. The tested model was then applied to investigate the impacts of key process parameters (i.e., gas supply and HRT) on the performance of the MBfR converting H2/CO2 to fatty acids. HRT was defined as the average length of time that bulk liquid remained in the MBfR. HRT and syngas supply were varied over wide ranges (HRT: 0.25–8days, syngas supply: 0.0001–0.012m3 d−1) to investigate their effects on the total fatty acids production as well as the relative distribution of each species produced in the steady state of the MBfR. An average biofilm thickness was applied in the model without consideration of its variation with locations. Due to the production of microbial mass and the attachment of biomass particles, the biofilm thickness grew. Detachment of biomass at the biofilm surface to the bulk liquid was also described in the model to achieve the steady-state biofilm thickness. All simulations assumed an initial biofilm thickness of 5μm which was irrelevant to the steady-state biofilm thickness [32] and were run for up to 100days to reach steady state in terms of fatty acids production."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Predicting fatty acids production from H2/CO2 in the MBfR,"3.1 Predicting fatty acids production from H2/CO2 in the MBfR The optimal set of parameter values was estimated using the AQUASIM built-in iterative algorithms, which minimize the residual error between experimental data and model predictions. The estimated values of the four parameters based on the experimental data in this work are presented in Table 1. μBu and μCa were obtained at 6.3 and 3.5gCODg−1 CODd−1, respectively, while KAc and KBu were estimated at 4500 and 2800gCODm−3, respectively. The fits of the model to the experimental data are visualized in Fig. 2 . Upon the commencement of the experiment, acetate appeared and accumulated, resulting in its growing concentration in the bulk liquid. Butyrate was only detected and kept increasing after a significant acetate accumulation. Similarly, the production of caproate only emerged at an apparent butyrate accumulation. The model also captured the undetectable hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase of the experimental MBfR (data not shown). The good agreement between the measured data and model predictions (R2 ⩾0.8) supported the validity of the developed model structure as well as the estimated parameters. Although the data used were limited, the main converting pathways were considered and the model fitting results proved satisfactory. The existing discrepancy between the experimental data and the model predictions (as shown in Fig. 2) could likely be the result of the simplified model structure, i.e., a three-pathway model instead of a four-pathway model. The model could be further improved by including more potential pathways upon the advent of more and better experimental data of the MBfR performing syngas fermentation."
7,Uncertainty analysis of the key model parameters,"3.2 Uncertainty analysis of the key model parameters A mathematical model usually involves a series of equations, input variables, and parameters, which are integrated to characterize processes under investigation. The uncertainty in the inputs are inevitably propagated to the model outputs. Therefore, parameter uncertainty of a model structure is of importance as it indicates which parameter combinations could be estimated under given measurement accuracy. Sensitivity analysis assesses how uncertainty in the outputs of a model can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs and is a useful tool to evaluate whether the values of theoretically identifiable parameters can be reliably obtained from experimental data. By taking into consideration the MBfR settings, an uncertainty analysis would gain a comprehensive understanding of the roles of parameters in the developed model structure. To conduct the uncertainty analysis, the four kinetic parameters (μBu , μCa , KAc , and KBu ) for fatty acids production were changed in the simulations one by one. The output sensitivities of model parameters to the fatty acids production calculated using best-fit parameters are delineated in Fig. 3 . The base value of μBu was 6.3gCODg−1 CODd−1 with a range from 2.3 to 12.3gCODg−1 CODd−1. With the increasing value in μBu , the production of acetate decreased while that of butyrate and caproate increased (Fig.3A). This change was attributed to the fact that more acetate produced was diverted to butyrate production at a higher μBu (see process 2 in Table 2). A higher butyrate concentration also accelerated the concomitant production of caproate, for which butyrate is utilized as the precursor. An opposite trend was observed in terms of the response of fatty acids production to changes in the KAc value (Fig.3B), and such an effect was attributed to the inverse nature between μBu and KAc in regulating the kinetic rate of butyrate production. With the increasing KAc value from 1500 to 7500gCODm−3, the production of butyrate was reduced, which led to less acetate consumption and less caproate formation from butyrate. As a result, the effluent caproate concentration dropped while the acetate production increased. Fig.3C and D demonstrate the output sensitivities of μCa (1.5–7.5gCODg−1 CODd−1) and KBu (1800–7800gCODm−3) to fatty acids production, respectively. An increase in μCa resulted in a higher caproate production rate at the cost of a decreasing production of butyrate (Fig.3C). KBu had an impact on the production of butyrate and caproate in an opposite way (Fig.3D), which was associated with its different role from μCa in determining the kinetic rate of caproate production from butyrate (see process 3 in Table 2). As shown in Fig.3C and D, the acetate production was not significantly affected by changes in either μCa and KBu value."
8,Impacts of operating factors on the MBfR performance,"3.3 Impacts of operating factors on the MBfR performance The development of an MBfR performing effective syngas fermentation processes is highly desirable, because it enables the practical production of valuable biochemicals from waste materials. The model developed was therefore applied to investigate the improvement of the MBfR performance through controlling its syngas (H2 and CO2) supply and HRT. Syngas supply directly determines the availability of substrates for syngas fermentation processes and serves as an important operational parameter of the MBfR. The impact of syngas supply on fatty acids production of the MBfR at HRT of 1day is displayed in Fig.4 A. The total fatty acids production increased while its rate decreased with the increasing syngas supply from 0.0001 to 0.012m3 d−1. The finite biomass and syngas transfer to the biofilm via membranes to great extent limited the syngas conversion capacity of the MBfR, leading to the relatively slow growth in the total fatty acids production at syngas supply of more than 0.008m3 d−1. The distribution of each fatty acid species was also influenced by syngas supply. As shown in Fig.4A, acetate was the dominant product species of syngas fermentation at syngas supply of 0.0001m3 d−1, accounting for 97.8% of total fatty acids produced in terms of COD. This was the result of the competitive advantage of acetate production (process 1 in Table 2) for utilizing H2 over the other two processes (processes 2 and 3 in Table 2) under limited syngas supply assessed, as evidenced by the dominant acetate accumulation rate shown in Fig.4B. Butyrate and caproate were also present in the outflow of the MBfR, taking up 2.1% and 0.1% of the total fatty acids production, respectively. Further increasing syngas supply provided more H2 for processes 2 and 3 (Table 2), resulting in the increasing abundance of butyrate and caproate which reached 14.2% and 4.2%, respectively, at syngas supply of 0.012m3 d−1. This was commensurate with the increasing butyrate and caproate accumulation rates in Fig.4B. Correspondingly, the production of acetate decreased gradually to 81.6% at syngas supply of 0.012m3 d−1. These results revealed the key role played by syngas supply in regulating the syngas fermentation processes. However, single control over syngas supply seemed not sufficient for achieving chain elongation, considering the fact that under the operational conditions studied the majority of the fatty acids produced were still short-chain fatty acids (i.e., acetate and butyrate), irrespective of the strength of syngas supply (see Fig.4A). HRT is another key process parameter commonly used to manage performance of dynamic reactors or systems. Fig.4C shows the relationship between fatty acids production of the MBfR and HRT at steady state. Due to the fixed syngas supply at 0.002m3 d−1, the total production of fatty acids was independent of HRT and remained almost constant at 0.5gCODd−1. However, the distribution of each fatty acid species was significantly affected by HRT. With the increasing HRT from 0.25 to 8days, the fraction of acetate dropped gradually from 96.0% to 47.4% while that of caproate rose consistently from 0.2% to 29.4%. The fraction of butyrate first increased from 3.8% at HRT of 0.25day and then remained about 23.0% at HRT of over 6days. A longer HRT allowed more acetate produced to be further converted to butyrate and caproate, which greatly facilitated chain elongation processes. This was justified by the decreasing acetate accumulation rate and the increasing caproate accumulation rate when prolonging the HRT, as demonstrated in Fig.4D. Based on the trend in Fig.4C, the fraction of caproate was expected to continue increasing at HRT of more than 8days. However, in Zhang et al. [13], acetate represented the major fermentation product with the coexistence of a low butyrate concentration but undetected caproate when the MBfR was operated at HRT of 9days. This was different from our finding and might be ascribed to the different conditions applied (e.g., pH and syngas supply). Moreover, the MBfR in Zhang et al. [13] was not operated long enough to reach steady state, which could be another factor affecting the different reported compositions of fermentation products. To sum up, the MBfR effectively performing mixed culture syngas fermentation could be achieved through controlling syngas supply and HRT using the developed model. From a practical point of view, a high HRT is imperative for chain elongation to produce a higher proportion of medium-chain fatty acids with a higher value (e.g., caproate in this work) while a proper syngas supply should be provided to favour the speciation of syngas fermentation products as well as to fully exploit the conversion capacity of the MBfR. However, the obtained simulations of the MBfR in terms of syngas usage and fatty acids production under different operating conditions (Fig. 4) only reflect the theoretical results at steady state, which require precise process control and might deviate from real applications. Moreover, the predictions might be highly dependent on the pathways considered for fatty acids production. The inclusion of other less favoured production pathways might to some extent affect the results. Though awaiting further experimental validation, the obtained information related to effective operation of the MBfR is expected to offer valuable guidance for operating practical systems taking on syngas fermentation processes and facilitate future experimentation of the MBfR technology for producing valuable biochemicals."
9,Future applications and development of the model,"3.4 Future applications and development of the model This work proposed a modeling approach for mixed culture syngas fermentation in MBfR for the first time. This modeling approach, when integrated with a set of other powerful tools such as molecular approaches, isotopic studies, and measurements of reaction intermediates, will help reveal the detailed mechanisms of mixed culture syngas fermentation. The acquired biokinetics could be coupled with alcohol production from syngas fermentation [33] to yield a comprehensive model that is capable of describing in-situ biofuel production in the MBfR. However, the kinetic parameters in this work were estimated based on limited experimental data and might not be completely applicable to describing MBfRs performing syngas fermentation. Therefore, the validity of the developed model could be ameliorated when more experimental data under different operating conditions become available. It’s worth mentioning that in addition to H2 and CO2, CO represents another primary component of syngas produced via biomass gasification. CO could be converted to acetate, butyrate, and ethanol under anaerobic reducing conditions [34,35], and fatty acids production from syngas containing H2, CO2, and CO has been proposed and proved [36,37]. The developed model in this work could be expanded to include CO as a model substrate upon the advent of experimental MBfRs performing syngas fermentation from the more practical mixture of H2, CO2, and CO. As CO2 was not taken into account as a limiting factor in the stoichiometric matrix as well as the Monod based process rate equations, the developed model could be further improved through the evaluation with scenarios considering different CO2/H2 ratios in the syngas composition."
10,Conclusions,"A new modeling approach integrating multiple production pathways of fatty acids (including acetate, butyrate, and caproate) was developed and tested using reported mixed culture experimental data from a lab-scale MBfR fed with 60% H2 and 40% CO2, with the uncertainty of the key model parameters being evaluated. The results showed that the model well predicted the experimental data with reliable parameter values estimated. A high HRT is imperative for chain elongation to produce a higher proportion of caproate with a higher added value. A proper gas supply should be provided to favour the speciation of biological gas conversion products as well as to fully exploit the conversion capacity of the MBfR."
