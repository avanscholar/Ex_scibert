0,Introduction,"The use of alternative biofuels represents a possibility to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels. A promising alternative fuel that can replace conventional fossil fuels and therefore contribute towards a low carbon economy development is biologically generated hydrogen [1]. Hydrogen has been envisaged as a clean fuel due to its combustion into water as the only reaction product. Furthermore, hydrogen has high energy content per unit weight (122kJ/g) and can be therefore used either in combustion engines or for electricity production through fuel cells [2]. On the other hand, when comparing volumetric densities with other gaseous fuels at normal conditions, hydrogen contains only 3.00 kWh/m3, while this value for methane equals to 9.97 kWh/m3 [3]; extremely low hydrogen volumetric density therefore poses a challenge for its storage. Hydrogen can be produced by several techniques such as thermochemical processes; water electrolysis and various biological processes [4]. Currently; hydrogen is mainly produced by steam reforming of natural gas and water electrolysis that are very energy intensive processes; but can be simply performed. Biological processes of hydrogen production via bio-photolysis; photo-fermentation and dark fermentation have an advantage over previously mentioned methods; due to operation at ambient temperatures and utilization of renewable organic compounds; but they are more sophisticated in design and performance [5]. Microbial fermentative hydrogen production exhibits several advantages over other biological hydrogen production processes; as it enables higher conversion yields and hydrogen evolution rates as well as a wider range of substrate utilization. Further; it requires no light and exhibits a potential for cost-effective hydrogen production [6]. However; hydrogen production at the industrial scale still faces many drawbacks; such as too low hydrogen yields and often unstable hydrogen production during longer operation periods; since evolutionary metabolic pathways of substrate degradation mainly result in the generation of energy-rich compounds; rather than hydrogen synthesis [7]. A maximum of 4mol H2/mol glucose is obtained when acetate is the end product of fermentation; while studies show that for most of the mesophiles; hydrogen yields are limited to 2mol H2/mol glucose. This is due to the fact that under standard conditions; complete oxidation of glucose into hydrogen and carbon dioxide is thermodynamically unfavorable. However; production of molecular hydrogen is important in achieving the redox balance in several fermentations. On the other hand; conversion of glucose into reduced metabolic products is thermodynamically more favorable as generation of ATP during the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and/or alcohols supports microbial growth. For most studies on dark fermentative hydrogen production; batch reactors have been used due to their simple operation and efficient control. However; to realize an industrial application of hydrogen production; continuous-flow bioreactors are recommended. Among them; the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is still the most widely used type of reactor for model studies; since it enables efficient mixing and homogeneity [8]. However; the CSTR is unable to maintain high levels of fermentative microbial biomass at short HRTs as rapidly mixing pattern causes washout of biomass. Therefore; granular type or fixed-bed reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB); anaerobic packed-bed reactor (APBR) and anaerobic fluidized-bed reactors (AFBR) appear to be more convenient. These reactors allow to achieve high cell densities by immobilization and permit the unit to be run at HRTs that are independent of the bacterial growth rate [9,10]. Thus; high hydrogen volumetric flow rates can be achieved with these types of reactors. Furthermore; high biomass densities provide greater resistance to inhibitory substances in the influent and shock loads. Among reactor types with immobilized microbial cells; APBR is characterized by simple configuration and high efficiency of hydrogen production. Moreover; the APBR configuration with microbial biofilm attached to inert carriers appears to result in lower construction and operation costs; since the reactor operates without mechanical agitation and does not require external sedimentation tank to separate the biomass [11]. Although APBR reactors were studied using different support materials for biofilm growth and model as well as real substrates; their application for fermentative hydrogen production requires further investigation [12,13]. Several previous studies on biohydrogen production in APBRs have indicated an influence of different operating conditions on hydrogen yield; however; without a detailed assessment on microbial cell attachment and detachment processes in formed biofilms; although stability of the formed biofilm is crucial for long-term operation of reactors. Moreover; a thorough review of the literature has revealed that dark fermentation studies mostly provide data obtained for the pH range of 5.0-7.0 [14]; with a few studies evaluating the aforementioned process at low pH conditions; although hydrogen production at low pH values could bring added advantage by cost savings for pH adjustments; eliminated pretreatments for restriction or termination of methanogens and provided capability to treat acidic waste. In this context; the main objective of this study was to investigate hydrogen production and microbial biofilm stability at low pH values (4±0.2) for different support materials (Mutag BioChip™; expanded clay and activated carbon) in the APBR reactor system. While assessing biohydrogen production over various support materials; an influence of support materials on the immobilization of hydrogen producing bacteria was investigated as well."
1,Experimental,
2,Seeding sludge,2.1 Seeding sludge The microbial inoculum used in this study was obtained from the anaerobic biogas digester treating waste sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant operating under mesophilic temperature conditions and CSTR mode. The collected sludge was sieved using 90μm mesh (Retsch; S/N 05036692) in order to remove large solid particles; and then stored at 4°C. The characteristics of inoculum used in the present study are summarized in Table 1 . Prior to immobilization process; hydrogen productivity of the seeding sludge was enhanced by acid pretreatment with the following conditions: pH=5.5 for 24h at 37°C.
3,Medium composition,2.2 Medium composition The medium used for H2 production consisted of glucose (5000mg/L) as a carbon source and of inorganic supplements including (mg/L) 125 CH4N2O; 2 NiSO4·6H2O; 5 FeSO4·7H2O; 2 FeCl3·6H2O; 1.5 CoCl2·6H2O; 5 CaCl2·2H2O; 85 KH2PO4; 22K2HPO4 and 50 Na2HPO4·7H2O. The pH value in the range of 4±0.2 was maintained by means of NaHCO3.
4,Support materials,2.3 Support materials The APBRs were packed with three different types of support materials for hydrogen producing bacteria: Mutag BioChip™ (Umwelttechnologie AG; Germany; R1); expanded clay (R2) and activated carbon (Comelt S.p.A.; Italy; R3) with the characteristics presented in Table 2 .
5,Anaerobic packed-bed reactor for H2 production,2.4 Anaerobic packed-bed reactor for H2 production Fig. 1 shows a schematic drawing of the reactor set-up. Initially; reactors were seeded with the acid treated sludge diluted with MQ water in ratio of 1:1 and circulated through the reactor unit for 24h. The reactor and inoculum were initially purged with N2 to assure anaerobic conditions. The procedure of inoculum circulation through reactors has been repeated till the reactor reached steady state. After the steady state was reached; the APBRs with HRT of 3h were continuously fed for 25days with synthetic wastewater containing glucose (5000mg/L); nutrients and sodium bicarbonate using a peristaltic pump. The reactors had a total volume of 230mL and a working volume of 110; 100 and 70mL after packing with Mutag BioChip™; expanded clay and activated carbon; respectively. The glass reactors had the internal diameter of 2.9cm and length of 35cm. The temperature in the APBRs was maintained at 37°C by recirculating heated water from a thermostatic bath over the reactor body. A gas-liquid separator was used at the outlet of the reactor to collect gaseous and soluble products separately. Cumulative production of biogas was measured by flow-through liquid displacement cells. Reactors were connected via a multi-channel automatic valve to a gas chromatograph; which enabled real-time analysis of the discharged gas stream. In order to assess performance of the reactors; glucose conversion; SCFAs; biomass yield; cell mass concentration in the effluent; cumulative volume of produced biogas and its composition were measured.
6,Analytical methods,2.5 Analytical methods Composition of gas phase was determined by means of a micro GC analyzer (Agilent Technologies; model 490) equipped with a TCD detector calibrated for hydrogen; nitrogen; methane; carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. CP-MolSieve 5A column (Agilent) with Ar as a carrier gas was used to analyze hydrogen; nitrogen and methane; while carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide were analyzed using a CP-PoraPLOT U column (Agilent) with He as a carrier gas. The temperature of the injector and column were kept at 80 and 100°C; respectively. Sugars; SCFAs (i.e. malonate; succinate; lactate; formate; acetate; propionate; butyrate; oxalate and valerate) and alcohol (i.e. ethanol) in liquid-phase samples were determined by HPLC technique (Agilent Technologies; model 1260 Infinity) equipped with a cation-exchange Hi-Plex H column (7.7×300mm; 8μm). The column temperature was set to 50°C. The analyses of SCFAs; ethanol and sugars in the fermentation broth were performed using 0.01M H2SO4 as a mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. SCFAs were analyzed by UV detection at 210nm; while concentration of ethanol and glucose were determined by using a RI detector kept at 35°C. TS and vs (to represent microbial biomass concentration) were measured in accordance with ISO 15705:2002–11 and SIST EN 14346:2007 standardized procedures; respectively. Support materials and microbial morphology at the end of immobilization and long-term operation period were examined using Carl Zeiss (SUPRA 35 VP) scanning electron microscope (SEM). For SEM analysis; support materials with attached biofilm were firstly freeze dried; attached to the aluminium sample carrier using conductive carbon tape and pretreated by carbon sputtering. In order to characterize materials for hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity; contact angles (Θ) of support materials were measured using a tensiometer Krüss DSA 20 (Krüss GmbH; Germany) according to the method described elsewhere [15]. Hydrophobicity of bacterial cells was evaluated by measuring their adherence to chloroform drops [16]. Furthermore; surface charge characteristics of the examined support materials were analyzed by point of zero charge measurements [17].
7,Microbial community analysis,2.6 Microbial community analysis Temporal variations of bacterial and archaeal microbial communities were assessed with Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. Before the analysis; all samples were dried in N2 atmosphere and stored at −20°C. Microbial biomass on the examined supports has been mechanically pretreated in order to release microbial biofilm in the suspension. Samples were added to 2mL tubes with sterile zirconium beads of various sizes (0.3g with diameter of 0.1mm and 0.1g with diameter of 0.5mm; Roth). Samples were then immersed into TE buffer and homogenized (3–4min) on a shaker (Vortex Genie2) equipped with the microcentrifuge tube adapter (Mobio Laboratories; Carlsbad; USA). After shaking; 200μL of suspension was used for DNA isolation. Microbial DNA was extracted and purified using Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Mobio Laboratories; Carlsbad; USA). The quantity of the extracted DNA was checked by measuring its absorbance on NanoVue-Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare; UK). Genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR reactions with primers specific for bacteria (fD1 [18] and 926r [19]) and archaea (A109f [20] and Ar915r [21]). PCR mixtures (25μL) contained 1X PCR buffer with KCl; 1.5mM MgCl2; 0.2μM dNTP; 0.3μM of each primer and 0.5U of Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR protocol used for bacteria was: 95°C for 5min; 25 cycles of 95°C for 30s; 55°C for 30s and 72°C for 1min; while PCR protocol used for archaea was: 95°C for 5min; 28 cycles of 95°C for 30s; 52°C for 45s and 72°C for 1.3min. The reactions were subsequently exposed to 72°C for 7min and cooled to 4°C. PCR products were purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche; Switzerland) and quantified using NanoVue-Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare; UK). The purified product (100–150ng) with 10U of two restriction enzymes (BsuRI and Mspl) was digested at 37°C for 16h. The restriction enzymes were inactivated by incubation at 80°C for 20min. Next; the restriction products were purified with the kit mentioned above and 6μL was mixed with 8.5μL HiDi formamide and 0.5μL GeneScan ROX-500 internal size standard (Applied Biosystems; USA) and denaturated at 95°C for 3min followed by rapid cooling on ice. T-RFs were separated by capillary gel electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems; USA) and electropherograms were analyzed by BioNumerics software 5.1 (Applied Maths; Belgium). Pearson’s correlation coefficient and UPGMA clustering method were used to construct the dendrograms.
8,Results and discussion,
9,Immobilization of hydrogen producing bacteria on selected supports,3.1 Immobilization of hydrogen producing bacteria on selected supports Immobilized cell culture systems for fermentative hydrogen production can be operated in batch; fed batch and continuous-flow modes. Although most of the studies for hydrogen production by immobilized systems are evaluated in continuous-flow operation; assessments of microorganism immobilization for use in aforementioned processes are mainly done in (repeated) batch operating mode [22–25]. By considering these facts; one of the aims of this study was to investigate an influence of support materials on the immobilization process of hydrogen producing bacteria. In the given range of operating conditions; the bioreactors exhibited the steady-state operation after 4–5days of immobilization. Fig. 2 shows production of soluble metabolic products and hydrogen production rate during the steady-state period of immobilization process. In R1 reactor system; we observed the highest concentration of soluble metabolic products formed (618mg/L) as well as highest H2 production rate (32.5-35.3NmL/(Lh)). On the other hand; concentrations of soluble metabolic products formed in reactors filled with expanded clay (R2) and activated carbon (R3) were 390 and 438mg/L; while H2 production rates were found to be 29.6-33.5 and 27.4-30.1NmL/(Lh); respectively. Among soluble metabolites formed during the immobilization process; acetic and butyric acid were dominant products in all three cases. However; their molar ratio varied significantly; acetic/butyric acid ratio was the highest for R3 (7.44); followed by R2 (3.35) and R1 (2.14). The obtained results indicate that immobilization support materials affect production of hydrogen and soluble metabolites; because different composition and/or dynamics of microbial communities could develop on examined support materials. The performance of APBRs during immobilization period could be strongly influenced by characteristics of support materials. Surface hydrophobicity has been described as one of the most important factors involved in bacterial adhesion process [26]. The results of contact angle measurements revealed that Θ value for Mutag BioChip™ was 114°; while high porosity of expanded clay and activated carbon (i.e. materials predominantly containing micro- and mesopores) prevented formation of water droplets and subsequent Θ measurements. Therefore; the results of this analysis have shown that Mutag BioChip™ carriers were hydrophobic; while expanded clay and activated carbon were found to be hydrophilic. In regard to cell affinity for different support materials; hydrophobicity index of inoculum was measured. Its value of 69.4 showed hydrophobic nature of present microbial cells in the inoculum; suggesting higher adhesion of bacteria on Mutag BioChip™; as this material was shown to be hydrophobic. Moreover; we assume that better adsorption in R1 was achieved due to numerous macropores on the surface of Mutag BioChip™ (see Fig. 6 a below); as these pores can be one of the crucial parameters affecting binding of microorganisms on the surface. Accordingly to Basile et al. [27]; cell affinity could also be affected by charged functional chemical groups on the surface. As bacterial cells tend to have a net negative charge on the cell wall [28]; their adsorption would be enhanced in the case of positively charged surface. As listed in Table 2; point of zero charge measurements revealed that all the support materials examined were positively charged at the employed experimental conditions; and exhibited therefore similar influence on microbial cells adsorption. An analysis of anaerobic mixed culture on different support materials acquired from experiments at the end of immobilization was conducted using SEM imaging technique. SEM observations showed that mostly micro-shaped bacilli were found on investigated support materials (Fig. 3 ). The characteristic layer of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the form of net-like structure that is a typical component of biofilms; was at the end of immobilization evidently detected only on the surface of Mutag BioChip™ particles.
10,Hydrogen production,3.2 Hydrogen production There was a slight difference in biohydrogen production among tested bioreactors filled with different support particles during 25days long operation period (Table 3 ). The highest hydrogen production rate and yield reached in R1 unit were 16.65mmol H2/(Lh) and 1.80mol H2/mol glucose; respectively. In R2 reactor hydrogen production rate and yield were found to be 15.55mmol H2/(Lh) and 1.74mol H2/mol glucose; while in R3 system hydrogen production rate and yield decreased to 13.65mmol H2/(Lh) and 1.46mol H2/mol glucose. As one can see in Table 3; support materials exhibited no influence on biogas composition; as in all cases H2 content in the biogas was 52.3-53.2 vol.%. Moreover; high hydrogen yields correlated with glucose conversion over 98.0% in all reactors (Table 3; Fig. 4 ). The findings of this study are comparable to the results of Sivagurunathan et al. [29]; who measured 99.6% galactose removal at HRT of 2h with hydrogen yield of 2.25mol H2/mol galactose. Furthermore; Ferraz Júnior et al. [30] obtained similar results with 100% glucose removal at HRT of 8h and hydrogen yield of 2.1mol H2/mol glucose.
11,Production of soluble metabolites,"3.3 Production of soluble metabolites Production of soluble metabolites formed during the dark fermentation process associated with different support materials in the APBRs is depicted in Fig. 4. The steady-state operation in all reactors was observed after approximately 5days of operation; which is attributed to the required time for biofilm development. It appears that acetate and butyrate were the main metabolites during the operation under consideration; suggesting that the primary hydrogen producers in the culture were acetate and butyrate producing bacteria. In R1 reactor; concentrations of acetate and butyrate were in the range of 1033–1246 and 890–1041mg/L; respectively. Similarly; in R2 unit measured values of acetate and butyrate were 947–1091 and 895–1011mg/L; respectively. On the other hand; in R3 reactor which exhibited lower H2 production performance; concentrations of acetate and butyrate were found to be 804–995 and 225–333mg/L; respectively. As SCFAs dominated among soluble metabolites and the production of solvents (e.g.; ethanol) was negligible at low pH value; the production of H2 in the culture was metabolically favored. Finally; production of lactate; formate and propionate which are typical soluble metabolites that lower H2 production; was minor in this study (below 50mg/L). The comparison of hydrogen yield and distribution of general metabolites between studies taken from the literature and this work is presented in Table 4 . As one can see; acetic and butyric acid fermentation usually occurs in the pH range of 5.5-6.5; while the pH range of 4.0-5.5 is typical for ethanol fermentation. In the study of Reis and Silva [31]; dominant metabolic products in the pH range of 4.0-5.0 were acetate (41.8%) and ethanol (38.8%); while Chu et al. [32] reported formation of ethanol (31.0%); acetate (16.9%) and butyrate (46.8%) at pH=5.5. On the other hand; Barros et al. [33] obtained low ethanol production (15.3%); as mainly acetate (45.1%) and butyrate (37.3%) were produced at pH value of 5.5. However; in this study; ethanol production was at selected operational conditions found to be low in all the reactors (5.1-7.9%). Predominance of acid end products during hydrogen production is however known to occur in the acidogenic phase; which decreases the pH value of culture medium. As low pH value disfavors growth of microorganisms; it has been suggested that the uptake of acids (normally accompanied by an increase of pH value) which occurs during solvent producing phase; functions as a detoxification process initiated in response to the accumulation of acid end products [37]. Solvent production is not guaranteed under low pH values and becomes brief and unproductive if pH value decreases below the value of 4.5 before enough acids are formed [38]. This is supported by the study of Shida et al. [36]; where similar results to those obtained in this work are reported. The main soluble metabolites reported were acetate (52.3%) and butyrate (40.1%); with 7.5% of ethanol leading to hydrogen yield of 2.29mol H2/mol glucose at pH value of about 3.8. The findings obtained in this study suggest that high hydrogen yields can be obtained at low pH values. Knowing that low pH values suppress hydrogenase activity; one can speculate that pH value within the biofilm where microbial community is present; is higher than in outer regions where the conditions are acidic [39]. Moreover; the HAc/HBu ratio has been reported as an indicator for efficiency evaluation of hydrogen producing cultures [33,40]. In general; a higher HAc/HBu ratio gives a higher theoretical H2 yield; as hexose fermentation to acetic acid gives 4mol of H2/mol hexose; while fermentation to butyric acid gives 2mol H2/mol hexose (Reactions (1) and (2)): (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 C H 3 C O O H + 2 C O 2 + 4 H 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H + 2 C O 2 + 2 H 2 The obtained HAc/HBu ratios from the APBR reactors are plotted in Fig. 4. HAc/HBu ratios for the reactors packed with Mutag BioChip™, expanded clay and activated carbon were 1.7, 1.6 and 4.8, respectively. These results indicated that butyrate was slightly dominated by acetate production in the case of Mutag BioChip™ (R1) and expanded clay (R2) supports, while in the reactor packed with activated carbon (R3) low production of butyrate compared to acetate was observed. Although the HAc/HBu ratio in the R3 system was found to be the highest among APBRs examined, its hydrogen yield was lower compared to R1 and R2. This could be due to the presence of (i) autotrophic homoacetogenic bacteria that are consuming H2/CO2 (Reaction (3)) or CO and/or (ii) heterotrophic homoacetogenic bacteria that grow on a wide range of sugars, alcohols, methoxylated aromatic compounds and one carbon compounds to form acetate [41]. (3) 4 H 2 + 2 C O 2 → C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 O There are, however, several studies reporting high levels of homoacetogenic bacteria in dark fermentation process: for example, Dinamarca et al. [42] observed that homoacetogenic hydrogen consumption was 4–62mmol H2/(Lsludge day) in heat treated anaerobic mixed culture at 35°C. They also observed that simultaneous hydrogen production and consumption occurred in non-methanogenic fermentation. Moreover, Nie et al. [43] found that the maximum hydrogen consumption in pretreated sludge at 105°C was equal to 1.3mmol/h. Yet Luo et al. [44] reported that 43% of total acetate was produced by homoacetogens with acid-pretreated mesophilic sludge cultivated under 37°C and initial pH=5.5."
12,Effect of different support materials on biofilm formation,"3.4 Effect of different support materials on biofilm formation The accumulation of biofilm that is primarily composed of microbial cells and extra-cellular polymeric substances is the net result of attachment, growth and detachment. Fig. 5 a shows the attached biomass in investigated APBRs. After twelve days of operation, the reactor packed with Mutag BioChip™ (R1) contained the highest amount of adhered biomass (i.e. 0.07g VSS/gsupport). This increased amount of biomass attached is suggested to contribute to higher hydrogen production performance of R1, as there may be a greater quantity of hydrogenogenic bacteria adhered to this support material compared to R2 and R3 reactor systems (with obtained microbial biomass concentrations of 0.04 and 0.03g VSS/gsupport, respectively). The temporal variations of effluent VSS concentrations are illustrated in Fig. 5b. As shown, these values were the highest in R3, followed by R2 and R1. This observed order might be attributed to different generation times of microbial biomass that developed on the support materials. It was also found out that the effluent VSS concentrations in the beginning of experiments were higher in comparison to the later operating stage and that after 12th day the effluent VSS concentrations stabilized; average steady-state values of effluent VSS concentrations in R1, R2 and R3 systems were equal to 0.07, 0.15 and 0.22g VSS/Leffluent, respectively. Table 5 shows that attachment/detachment rates in R1 and R2 units were slightly lower compared to R3 system, being 0.10, 0.12 and 0.16g VSS/d, respectively. Biomass yields calculated as the sum of attached biomass and effluent suspended biomass per unit of glucose consumed, were 0.11, 0.08 and 0.18g VSS/(g glucose consumed) for R1, R2 and R3 reactors, respectively. The inverse relationship between the biomass and hydrogen yields shows that higher biomass yield in R3 unit is associated with growth of non-hydrogen producing bacteria, since hydrogen yield in this reactor system was lower compared to the ones obtained in R1 and R2 units. It is noteworthy to emphasize that the reported biomass yield for hydrogen producing bacteria of 0.1g VSS/(g glucose consumed) [45] is consistent with our results. This clearly reflects higher proportion of non-hydrogen producing bacteria in R3 unit compared to R1 and R2 reactors. Biofilm analysis of samples collected at the end of experiments shows that all support materials examined in this study were appropriate for biomass immobilization and further formation of biofilm. SEM micrographs depicted in Fig. 6 show that the biofilm fully covered the surface and cavities of all support materials, which indicates high biomass retention in APBR reactors. Based on observed biofilm morphologies (Fig. 6) and above-discussed production of acetate and butyrate during the operation phase, the present microorganisms might belong to the genera Clostridium, Enterobacter and Bacillus associated with carbohydrates conversion to hydrogen and organic acids."
13,Microbial analysis,"3.5 Microbial analysis Terminal restriction fragments of 16S rRNA genes were analyzed to evaluate changes in microbial communities developed after 25days of operation compared to initial microbial communities (i.e. inoculum from biogas digester and acid pretreated inoculum used for cell immobilization). Analysis of bacterial community with the T-RFLP method revealed small changes in the structure between initial inoculum and acid pretreated inoculum, as their similarity was 93.0% (Fig. 7 ). Furthermore, their weak band intensity in bacterial as well as in archaeal community showed that microbial activity in these two samples was low. Moreover, bacterial diversity in initial inoculum and acid pretreated inoculum was considerably higher than that after 25days of operation, confirming that the employed operating conditions (pH=4.0±0.2 and HRT=3h) enabled formation of selectively enriched community capable of hydrogen production. Bacterial microbial community developed on the carrier materials after 25days of operation at low pH value and hydraulic retention time of 3h was completely different from initial inoculum and inoculum used for immobilization, since their similarity ranged from 3.1 to 8.2%. Bacterial communities developed on different support materials exhibit high similarity between R1 and R2 reactors (similarity over 92.5%), while similarity of bacterial community in the R3 unit compared to R1 and R2 was found to be lower (84.4%). Quite high similarity values among the bacterial communities allude that different support materials don’t exhibit a major impact on the microbial community structure. Bacterial diversity, assessed by the number of clear T-RFLP bands, was similar in R1 and R2. Markedly lower diversity was observed for bacterial community in R3. Considering the fact that higher hydrogen yields were achieved in R1 (1.80mol H2/mol glucose) and R2 (1.74mol H2/mol glucose) compared to R3 (1.46mol H2/mol glucose), it is suggested that higher bacterial diversity enables higher hydrogen yields. Similar results about the microbial diversity were obtained by Ren et al. [46], where hydrogen production was evaluated for pH ranges of 6.0–6.5, 5.5–6.0 and 4.0–4.5, corresponding to propionate type, ethanol-butyrate type and ethanol type fermentation, respectively. DGGE analysis further showed higher microbial diversity during ethanol type and ethanol-butyrate type fermentations that were accompanied with higher hydrogen production rates. Although in this work taxonomical confirmation of presumptive bacteria such as Clostridium, Bacillus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella was not identified, it is well known that these populations are involved in stable and efficient hydrogen production [29,30]. Analysis of archaeal community revealed similar quantity of archaea in initial inoculum and acid pretreated inoculum as well as lower quantity after 25days of operation in all APBRs, which was accompanied with the fact that archaeal community had much lower abundance than bacterial community. Slightly lower diversity of archaeal community in R1 unit compared to R2 and R3 reactors could be associated with higher hydrogen yield in R1, as archaea could be associated with substrate depletion. As in the case of bacterial community, significant changes at the end of long-term operation were observed also in archaeal community. The similarity of archaeal community in initial inoculum and inoculum used for immobilization compared to archaeal community after 25days of operation was namely 26.6% (Fig. 8 ). There was no methane detected in the biogas formed, which is in agreement with the findings of Han et al. [47], who reported relatively narrow pH range of 5.5–8.2 for methane production and its inhibition at pH values lower than 6. Thus, we could reasonably assume that the employed operating conditions allowed only the development of non-methanogenic archaeal community, or T-RFLP bands were due to inactive archaeal cells or DNA of dead cells that is amplified during T-RFLP analysis."
14,Conclusions,"This study has demonstrated that the examined support materials (Mutag BioChip™, expanded clay and activated carbon) were adequate for cell immobilization and further formation of biofilm containing hydrogenogenic bacteria at low pH values. The results showed that APBRs packed with either Mutag BioChip™ (R1) or expanded clay (R2) achieved higher hydrogen production performance compared to the reactor filled with activated carbon (R3). The hydrogen yield (1.80mol H2/mol glucose), production of HAc (1033–1246mg/L) and HBu (890–1041mg/L) as well as the amount of biomass adhered (0.07g VSS/gsupport) were found to be the highest in R1. Moreover, the biomass detachment rates in R1 were lower than in R2 and R3. The better performance of R1 reactor system might be attributed to the properties of Mutag BioChip™ carrier and used inoculum, as both Mutag BioChip™ and inoculum exhibited hydrophobic characteristics, while the other two supports (expanded clay and activated carbon) were hydrophilic. Moreover, better adsorption in R1 could be achieved due to numerous macropores on the surface of Mutag BioChip™. Finally, in the given range of operating conditions stable performance of APBRs for biohydrogen production (20days) was obtained."
