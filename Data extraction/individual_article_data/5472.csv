0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on cathodes and oxygen evolution reaction on anodes (OER) is a promising pathway to convert sustainable electricity from solar, water and wind into chemical energy [1,2]. However, the typical operating cell voltage for commercial electrolyzers (1.8–2.0 V) is much larger than the theoretical minimum value (1.23 V), resulting in poor electronic efficiency and energy consumption, due to the lack of highly active catalysts. It has been long known that Pt, Ir, and Ru-based catalysts can dramatically reduce the electrolysis overpotentials and speed up the kinetics of HER and OER for high efficiency water splitting [3]. However, the practical implementation of electrocatalyzed hydrogen production is limited by the high costs and natural scarcity of these noble metals [4]. Developing low-cost and noble-metal-free catalysts is becoming the current subject of intense investigation. Based on the “volcano plot” in which the activity of catalysts for HER as a function of the MH bond strength exhibits an ascending branch followed by a descending branch [5], an optimized catalyst based on low-cost transition metals should possess a MH bond strength comparable to that of Pt. Consequently, The multicomponent alloy materials combining Ni (or Co, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr and so on), which binds H weakly, and Mo (or W, Ti, Nb,Ta), which binds H strongly, such as NiTi, NiMo, FeMo, NiMoFe, NiMoCo and NiMoCr [5–9], are expected to have high catalytic activities because of the synergetic effects and partially filled d orbitals for the gain and loss of electrons [10–12]. However, the poor corrosion resistance, originating from the high electrochemical activity of most transition metals, limits their applications as electrocatalysts in acidic and alkaline electrolytes [13,14]. The multiple principle elements alloys, also called high-entropy alloys (HEAs), with a disordered atomic structure possess many appealing properties that are unachievable in traditional alloys [15,16]. Particularly, the high entropy of mixing effect and disordered atomic structure of HEAs offer a simple solid solution and unique properties such as larger lattice distortion, slow diffusion, phase stability and so on, resulting in ultrahigh mechanical strength and corrosion resistance both in acidic and alkaline electrolytes although HEAs are thermodynamically unstable [17–20]. In the last decade, a large number of HEAs with a widely tunable chemical composition, which can satisfy various chemical demands, have been developed [21,22]. Consequently, some unique functions of HEAs are recently found. For example, Yusenko et al. prepared hcp-Ir0.19Os0.22Re0.21Rh0.20Ru0.19 and FCC-Ir0.26Os0.05Pt0.31Rh0.23Ru0.15 sp-HEAs by thermal decomposition of single-source precursors [23], which exhibit pronounced electrocatalytic activity in methanol oxidation. A low-cost AlCoCrTiZn HEA, synthesized by mechanical alloying, displays a prominent efficiency in degradation of the azo dye [24]. It is believed that such excellent catalytic properties of HEAs should be related to the electronic effects associated with the unique atomic structure, or to the synergic effect inherent to HEAs and often referred to as “cocktail effect” [15,25,26]. Combining the metastable characteristics, widely tunable compositions, and high corrosion resistance, it is reasonable to divine that HEAs with optimized surface chemistry are promising candidates as catalytic materials [27–29]. Inspired by the above findings, herein, we take a HEA with optimized surface chemistry (Ni20Fe20Mo10Co35Cr15) [30] as an example to investigate the unique catalytic performance of HEAs for HER. The phase constitution (single-phase or dual-phase) of Ni20Fe20Mo10Co35Cr15 can be easily controlled by annealing treatment, which enable us to investigate the influence of phase transformation on their electrochemical properties. Electrochemical test indicates that HEA with single phase exhibits unusual bulk catalysis with low onset potentials, small Tafel slopes and excellent stability, which are comparable to or even better than that of some nanostructured catalysts and state-of-the-art Pt that is currently used in commercial electrolyzers."
1,Experiment section,
2,Material synthesis,"2.1 Material synthesis Alloy ingots with nominal compositions of Cr15Fe20Co35Ni20Mo10 (at. %) were fabricated by arc-melting under an argon atmosphere, subsequently homogenized in vacuum at 1200 °C for 48 h. The purity of raw metal materials is higher than 99.9%. The homogenized HEA ingots were further hot-rolled at 1100 °C to the sheet with a thickness of 8 mm, then cold-rolled to 2.4 mm with a thickness reduction of 70%, followed by annealing at 800 °C and 1150 °C for 1 h and then air cooling (AC) to room temperature."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization The phase constitutions of the alloys were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructure characterization was performed by JEM 2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Specimens for TEM observation were thinned using mechanical grinding followed by double-jet electropolishing in a solution of 6% perchloric acid, 35% n-butyl alcohol and 59% alcohol at − 30 °C and an applied voltage of 30 V."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements, using a CHI 660D potentiostat, were carried out by a standard three-electrode cell in 0.5 M H2SO4 or 1.0 M KOH solution, with a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All polarization data were acquired with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The reference electrode was calibrated to reversible hydrogen potential (RHE) using platinum electrode for both working and counter electrodes and converted to RHE according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = 0.0591 pH + 0.197). EIS measurements were carried out at different overpotentials with the frequencies ranging from 10−2–105 Hz with alternating current signal amplitude of 20 mV. The electrochemical experiments were conducted using an electrochemical workstation and were performed at room temperature."
5,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns, shown in Fig. 1 , reveal that NiFeMoCoCr HEA annealed at 800 °C for 1 h is composed of FCC phase solid solution and μ phase precipitates while NiFeMoCoCr HEA annealed at 1150 °C for 1 h is simple FCC phase solid solution. Fig. 2 a and b is the typical TEM bright-field (BF) images of the annealed specimens, showing the dual-phase structure (FCC phase + μ phase) in 800 °C-annealed specimen, while single-phase structure in 1150 °C-annealed specimen, which is in a good agreement with the XRD result. The selected area diffraction (SAED) patterns of the precipitate that are taken along the [10–10] zone axis, inserted in Fig. 2a, confirm that the black domains in Fig. 2a correspond to μ phases. Chemical compositions of the μ phase and FCC matrix are analyzed using EDX. The contents of Cr, Fe, Co, Ni and Mo, in μ phases are 15.2, 13.1, 30.7, 8.7 and 32.3 at. %, indicating a significant enrichment of Mo in the μ phases, compared to their contents (15.4, 19.9, 35.6, 19.4 and 9.7 at. %, respectively) in FCC matrix. The electrocatalytic activities of NiFeMoCoCr HEA for HER were evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solutions using a three-electrode system. For comparison, the performances of the dual-phase alloy (μ+FCC) and commercial Pt catalyst were also tested. The representative polarization curves and Tafel plots of these samples in 0.5 M H2SO4 are shown in Fig. 3 a and b. In comparison with the dual-phase alloy counterpart, the HEA with the single phase shows much higher HER activities with an exceptionally low onset potential of ≈44 mV, a small Tafel slope of 41 mV per decade and a low operation overpotential (η) of 281 mV at the current densities (j) of 100 mA cm−2, which is comparable to or even better than that of some reported nanostructured catalysts as listed in Table S1, presenting a high potential as a noble-metal-free catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen production. In addition to the acidic electrolyte, the FCC crystallized NiFeMoCoCr HEA also shows outstanding HER activities in basic solution. As shown in Fig. 3c, the polarization curves recorded from the FCC crystallized NiFeMoCoCr HEA shows a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 172 mV in the basic solution. In contrast, the dual-phase NiFeMoCoCr exhibits lower HER catalytic activities in terms of overpotential and current density. Fig. 3d shows the Tafel plots derived from the polarization curves for the dual-phase and single-phase HEAs, as well as Pt electrodes. The corresponding Tafel slopes are 96, 66 and 49 mV dec−1, respectively. Moreover, the HEA with a low onset overpotential of 65 mV is much better than that of bulk glassy Ni40Fe40P20 [31], and even comparable to those of the well-developed nanostructured catalysts reported in the literature (Table S2, Supporting Information). To evaluate the durability of the HEA electrode in HER testing environment, we tested the FCC crystallized NiFeMoCoCr HEAs in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions at room temperature for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the single-phase HEA offers high current densities (100 mA cm−2) without any loss in activity for approximately 8 h, while the dual-phase HEA (μ+FCC) has a quick drop at the beginning. The colorless of acidic solution, after testing using the HEA, further confirms that HEA is stable in the acidic solution. Fig. 4b shows the HER polarization curves of the as-prepared and long-term tested HEAs. The negligible degeneration of catalytic activities after long-term testing verifies that the FCC crystallized NiFeMoCoCr HEA has excellent electrochemical stability. The XRD pattern and SEM/EDS morphology of HEA after long-term testing also confirm this (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). To better understand the origin of the excellent electrocatalytic performances of HEAs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). The EIS plot of the FCC crystallized NiFeMoCoCr HEA shows low charge transfer resistance (Rct) as compared to that of the dual-phase alloy in the basic solution at the overpotential of 0 mV. The small charge transfer resistance would be mainly related to the electrocatalytically active surface and good electric conductivity of the alloy for facile charge transfer and electron transport during the electrochemical reactions. We speculate that the superior electrocatalytic performances of the HEAs originate not only simply from the metallic nature for good electric conductivity, but also, more importantly, the unique structure (atoms disorder and simple structure). The surface atoms of single-phase FCC HEAs are expected to have much higher coordination numbers than dual-phase (μ+FCC) counterparts because of the relative high atoms disorder. The under coordinated surface atoms synergistically promote the interaction of the electrode with electrolytes, and adsorption of hydrogen, and efficient charge transfer for the HER process. In fact, the obvious difference in catalytic activities between the dual-phase alloy and single-phase HEAs provides straightforward evidence that the single-phase structure with disordered atoms distribution can offer new electrocatalytic activities of HEAs. It is worth noting that the excellent HER activities of the NiFeMoCoCr HEAs are measured from the bulk samples with a low electrochemically active surface area, which is significantly different from all other alloy catalysts that need to be activated by nanostructure or a large surface area. The bulk catalytic performances demonstrate that the catalytic activities are the intrinsic property of the NiFeMoCoCr HEAs, which could originate from the synergistic reaction of elements. The high entropy of mixing effect and disordered atomic structure of HEAs offer a simple solid solution and unique properties. Practically, the bulk catalysis is very valuable because bulk HEAs can be directly used as catalytic electrodes for water splitting without any binder and support. The bulk property also leads to the immunization to the catalysis degradation caused by the coarsening of nanostructured catalysts. The apparent catalytic data of the FCC crystallized NiFeMoCoCr HEAs may not be as good as the best catalysts for HER in the literature if one simply counts the overpotentials and Tafel slops, probably largely because of the lower electrochemically active surface area of the bulk catalyst. However, considering the lower costs in materials and fabrication process as well as bulk catalysis, this HEA catalyst has a much higher potential for practical applications than most nanostructured HER catalysts."
6,Conclusion,"Despite great efforts invoked in the development of noble-metal-free catalysts for HER, the current catalytic materials based on non-noble metal elements are less satisfactory in terms of activity, stability, and materials costs, which calls for further material innovation to realize efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. Economic transition metals and alloys, such as Ni, Co, Mo and Fe, are known to be active catalysts for HER. However, their applications are mainly limited due to their poor chemical stability in acidic and basic electrolytes, which are required for high-efficiency water splitting. Tuning the transition metal alloys into a HEA state with a simple structure and chemistry can significantly enhance the corrosion resistance in harsh electrochemical and chemical environments. More importantly, the stabilized chemical performance does not degrade the catalytic activities of the transition metals toward HER. Although the underlying mechanisms of the improved catalysis and corrosion resistance of the HEAs need further theoretical and experimental investigations, the finding that the unique structure of HEA can effectively improve the catalytic activities and electrochemical stability opens a new application field of HEAs as catalysts for energy and environmental related chemical and electrochemical reactions."
