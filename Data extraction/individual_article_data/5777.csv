0,Introduction,"As a crucial bulk chemical both in industry and our daily life, ethanol (EtOH) has been extensively used as a clean fuel additive, solvent, disinfectant, and industrial intermediate [1–3]. At present, the primary methods for EtOH production are based on the hydrolysis of ethylene and fermentation of agricultural feedstock [4–7]. However, the ethylene hydration is limited by the soaring demand for crude oil-derived ethylene and the dwindling of oil resources [8], and agricultural feedstock fermentation may exacerbate the food crisis and is constrained by the expensive biological processes [5]. Aiming at this situation, synthesis of EtOH via syngas emerges as a promising alternative route, because syngas can be versatilely produced from natural gas, coal, inedible biomass, and even organic wastes [4–9]. Ethanol can be obtained directly and indirectly from syngas [10–14]. The direct route over Rh-based catalysts still suffers from the low conversion and poor ethanol selectivity due to the syngas methanation and carbon-carbon coupling [10–12]. By far, much work has focused on the indirect synthetic processes via hydrogenation of syngas-derived acetate acid (HOAc, by carboxylation of methanol), methyl acetate (MA, by carboxylation of dimethyl ether over MOR-zeolite) and dimethyl oxalate (DMO, Scheme 1 ) [4,13–17]. Nevertheless, the severe corrosion problem and lack of high-performance catalyst restrict the application of HOAc hydrogenation [13,11–14]. Although the industrial demonstration of MA hydrogenation has been successfully realized in China, the lifespan of MOR-zeolite still faces challenge owing to the coke deposition [15,16]. EtOH synthesis from DMO can be carried out under relatively mild conditions, and this process contains two steps including CO oxidative coupling to obtain DMO and subsequent hydrogenation to EtOH [17–20]. Notably, the first step has been scaled up into commercial production in 2010 [20]. Thus, the development and use of qualified catalysts of DMO hydrogenation are the heart for this route. The Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts are frequently used for this reaction owing to its high activity [16,17,21–24]. For example, the traditional Cu/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the ammonia evaporation hydrothermal method offers an 83 % EtOH yield at 280 °C [17] and the Cu/ZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst provides a 97 % EtOH yield at 270 °C [21]. Despite these industrially promising EtOH yields, there are still many catalytic and technical problems to be resolved in the practical applications. The hardest one is that the reaction temperature for the high EtOH selectivity is usually above 270 °C, much higher than the Hüttig temperature of Cu of 134 °C, which makes Cu nanoparticles prone to be sintered [25]. In addition, DMO hydrogenation to EtOH is a strong exothermic reaction (ΔH = -145.93 kJ mol−1), and the common supports (e.g., SiO2, ZrO2 and Al2O3) have poor thermal conductivity, normally generating hotspots in catalyst bed and further accelerating Cu sintering [26–28]. To address this problem, the novel Mo2C/SiO2 and Fe5C2 catalysts are applied to DMO hydrogenation to EtOH, both of which show outstanding catalytic stability [29,30]. However, the Mo2C/SiO2 catalyst easily causes carbon-carbon cleavage to generate large amount of methanol with about 20 % selectivity, and the Fe5C2 catalyst produces undesired budget methyl acetate with about 10 % selectivity. Therefore, it is particularly desirable to render a novel catalyst endowed with high EtOH yield and especially with long-term stability for the DMO-to-EtOH process. DMO hydrogenation to EtOH involves the activation and hydrogenation of CO and CO in ester group to form ethylene glycol followed by hydro-dehydroxylation to form EtOH. Recently, Huang et al. reported a hierarchical FeNi3@graphene catalyst composed of FeNi3 nanoalloys encapsulated by ultrathin graphene shells, and this catalyst was highly efficient to activate the inert CO in CO2 to produce CO with a promising long-term stability for at least 200 h at 250 °C [31]. Moreover, the FeNi3 nanoalloy showed excellent performance in stearic acid hydrogenation to stearic alcohol with 98 % yield [32], indicating that FeNi3 nanoalloy can also effectively activate CO and CO in carboxyl group. Furthermore, theoretical calculations also revealed that the FeNi3 nanoalloy had sufficient ability to activate hydroxyl group in hydro-dehydroxylation reactions [33]. In addition, Li et al. reported that the introduction of FeOx species into a Pt-Al2O3@SBA-15 catalyst significantly improved the selective hydrogenation performance of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol due to the FeOx-assisted adsorption and activation of carbonyl group [34]. Wu et al. claimed that the interaction of bimetallic Pt-Fe alloy and FeOx effectively enhances the hydrogenation of carbonyl group in acetone to isopropanol [35]. The high ability of FeNi3 to activate CO2, carboxyl group, and hydroxyl group with high stability as well as FeOx-assisted adsorption and activation of carbonyl group are unequivocally desirable for DMO hydrogenation to EtOH, and thus we reason that the FeNi3-FeOx nanocomposite catalysts should be expectable for this reaction with promising selectivity and stability. Another critical issue for DMO-to-EtOH catalysts is the high thermal conductivity. Structured catalysts based on the monolithic metal-fibers/foams have aroused ever-growing interests in heterogeneous catalysis due to the inherent outstanding features such as low pressure drop, high thermal conductivity and desired mechanical robustness [36,37]. Particularly, this new structure is opening an opportunity on the development of novel monolithic catalyst with significantly enhanced heat transfer that is desired for suppressing the “hot- or cold-spots” formation in catalytic bed for the strongly exo- or endo-thermic reaction processes. For instance, a monolithic Ni-foam structured Ni-CeO2-Al2O3 nanocomposite catalyst with high heat-transferring was developed, highly active, selective, and particularly stable for the strongly exothermic syngas methanation [38]. A structured catalyst Ag-CuOx/Ni-foam was also tailored for the gas-phase DMO hydrogenation to methyl glycolate (MG), which delivered an almost complete DMO conversion with 92 % MG selectivity and was stable for at least 200 h [39]. The virtues of FeNi3-FeOx nanocomposites and monolithic metallic fiber/foam substrates are evident to meet the demands for the gas-phase DMO hydrogenation to EtOH, but the grand challenge is to seek an effective fabrication strategy to integrate these advantageous pieces into a qualified catalyst for this process. Herein, we report a highly effective and efficient strategy of nano- to macro-engineering of FeNi3-FeOx nanocomposite onto the monolithic Ni-foam, achieving unique combination of high catalytic performance (low-temperature active, highly selective and highly stable) for the DMO-to-EtOH process with high thermal conductivity (enhanced heat transfer) and high permeability (low pressure drop). Initially, the Ni-foam underwent a hydrothermal treatment to create a porous layer of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets on the foam struts. Subsequently, the as-obtained Ni(OH)2/Ni-foam was impregnated with aqueous solution of iron(III) nitrate and calcined in air to produce the NiFe2O4-NiO/Ni-foam catalyst precursor. Finally, by reduction in H2 the NiFe2O4-NiO/Ni-foam could be in situ transformed into FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam catalyst product. The effects of catalyst preparation and reaction conditions on their catalytic performance for the DMO-to-EtOH process were investigated. To unravel the “synthesis-property-performance” relationship of the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam catalyst in the DMO-to-EtOH process, X-ray diffraction (XRD), in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, in-situ Raman spectroscopy, H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) were employed for catalyst characterization, and the activation energy calculations were performed for all reactions involved in EtOH formation (including DMO-to-MG, MG-to-EG (ethylene glycol), EG-to-EtOH, MG-to-MA, and MA-to-EtOH)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni(OH)2/Ni-foam substrate was prepared first. In a typical synthesis, circular Ni-foam chips (8.0 mm diameter) were cut down from a Ni-foam sheet (1.5 mm thick; 100 pores per inch, PPI; Suzhou Taili Material Co., Ltd) and ultrasonically degreased in a 0.01 M NaCO3 aqueous solution for 20 min. Then these circular chips were soaked into a 0.1 M HCl solution at room temperature for another 20 min ultrasonic treatment to remove the surface nickel oxide of Ni-foam struts and washed thoroughly by using deionized water. The as-cleaned Ni-foam chips were transferred into a 120 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave filled with a mixture aqueous solution of 10 mmol L−1 Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99 wt% purity, Aldrich) and 40 mmol L−1 NH4F (99 wt% purity, Aldrich). After hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 6 h, the Ni-foams coated with dark green Ni(OH)2 crystals were rinsed thoroughly by using deionized water and dried in air at 80 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the as-prepared Ni(OH)2/Ni-foam substrates were incipiently impregnated with an aqueous solution containing desired amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99 wt% purity, Aldrich), followed by drying at 80 °C for 12 h and calcining at 350−550 °C for 2 h in air. Finally, the samples were packed layer-up-layer into a quartz tube and reduced in a H2 (99.99 mol% purity) flow at 300−450 °C for 1 h to obtain the catalyst products that are denoted as FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(m/n), where m and n stand for calcination temperature (°C) and reduction temperature (°C), respectively. For comparison, a series of contrastive catalysts, including Ni/SiO2, FeNi3/SiO2, FeOx/SiO2, and FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2, were prepared by the precipitation method. Specifically, taking FeNi3/SiO2 as an example, NiCl2·6H2O (1.79 g; 99 wt% purity, Aldrich), FeCl2 (0.50 g; 99 wt% purity, Aldrich) and polyethylene glycol (0.03 g; average Mn 6000, Aldrich) were dissolved in 60 mL distilled water under electro-magnetic stirring at ambient temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution (Fe/Ni molar rate of 3). The silica sol of 10 g (30 wt% SiO2; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added into the above solution dropwise under vigorous stirring. After that, NaOH solution (50 wt%, Aldrich) was added dropwise until the pH value reached 12 to obtain Ni(OH)2-Fe(OH)2/SiO2, followed by dropwise adding 5 g N2H4 solution (80 wt%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) under vigorous stirring. Finally, the as-obtained mixture was stirred for 12 h for full reduction at room temperature under N2 protection to obtain the contrastive catalyst of FeNi3/SiO2. Notably, Ni/SiO2, FeOx/SiO2 and FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2 (Fe/Ni molar ratio of 2) were also obtained via the same procedures but with tuned Fe/Ni molar ratios and amount of N2H4 solution (not used in the case of FeOx/SiO2). Before the catalytic test, all contrastive catalysts were pre-reduced in H2 at 350 °C for 1 h. The Fe5C2/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnation followed by carbonization in a methanol-H2 mixture [30]. Typically, the SiO2 (1.0 g, Aldrich) was firstly impregnated with 5 mL aqueous solution containing 0.58 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and dried at 110 °C for 12 h. Then, the obtained sample was calcined in air at 400 °C for 6 h followed by reduction in H2 at 380 °C for 4 h to form Fe/SiO2. Finally, the Fe/SiO2 was carbonized in a methanol-H2 mixture (methanol/H2 molar ratio of 20) at 350 °C and 2.5 MPa for 24 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku Ultra IV diffractometer (Japan), using copper Kα radiation (λ =0.1542 nm) at 35 kV and 25 mA in the 2θ scanning range of 20-80° at a scanning rate of 20° min−1. Notably, the content of Fe that exists as FeNi3 in the catalysts was determined based on the following general equations: Fe (wt%) = M Fe M FeNi 3 × K FeNi 3 ×A FeNi 3 K FeNi 3 ×A FeNi 3 + K Ni · A Ni ×100% where MFe and M FeNi 3 are the molar mass of Fe and FeNi3 respectively, and A FeNi 3 and ANi are the peak areas of FeNi3(111) and Ni(111), which can be obtained from Gaussian peak fitting method. The K FeNi 3 and KNi are the relative mass calibration factor of FeNi3 and Ni ( K FeNi 3 : 7.52, JCPDS No. 38-0419; K Ni : 7.44, JCPDS No. 04-0850). The total loading of Fe (i.e., the Fe content exists in FeNi3 and FeOx) was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on a USA Thermo IRIS Intrepid IIXSP ICP spectrometer. The morphology of catalysts was investigated using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 3.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a Tecnai G2 F30 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (USA). Before used to detect in TEM, the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(m/n) catalysts were treated as following: firstly, a piece of catalyst chip was soaked into ethanol (20 mL) in a glass vial (50 mL) under N2 protection for 24 h ultrasonic treatment (300 W) to peel off some FeNi3-FeOx fragments; then the upper liquid (1 mL) consisting of FeNi3-FeOx fragments was transferred into another glass vial and diluted with ethanol; finally, five drops of liquid dripped on the Cu grid. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on a BELSORP-MAX gas adsorption analyzer after the catalysts were degassed under high vacuum at 300 °C for 6 h. Specific surface area (SSA) was determined from N2 adsorption isotherm using standard Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. The pore size distribution was calculated by the Barrett-Jovner-Halenda (BJH) method based on the adsorption isotherm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA system equipped with an in-situ reactor chamber (AXIS SUPRA, UK), using a standard Al Kα X-ray source (300 W) with an analyzer pass energy of 40 eV. The circular catalyst chips (1.5 mm diameter) were pretreated in 10 vol% H2/N2 (20 mL min−1) at target temperature for 1 h in the reactor chamber, and then cooled down to room temperature. After that, the chips were transferred into the measurement chamber without contacting air. The obtained binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV as the reference. The in-situ Raman measurements were carried out using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia) with a 532 nm semiconductor laser as excitation, equipped with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera enabling microanalysis on a sample point. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra were recorded on a Topologic 500 A spectrometer with a proportional counter at room temperature. Moving 57Co(Pd) in a constant acceleration mode was used as the radioactive source. The spectra were fitted with the appropriate superposition of Lorentzian lines using the MössWinn 3.0i computer program. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and NH3 temperature programmed desorption of (NH3-TPD) were performed on a TP5080 multifunctional automatic adsorption instrument (Xianquan Industrial and Trading Co., Ltd., China) with a thermal conductivity detector connected with a MS spectrometer (Proline Dycor, AMETEK Process Instrument, USA). For each H2-TPR experiment, fresh catalyst sample (0.1 g) was pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h in a 5 vol % O2/Ar gas flow. The H2-TPR analyses were carried out in a 10 vol% H2/N2 flow of 20 mL min-1 from room temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. For each trial of NH3-TPD, FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(m/n) catalyst sample of 0.1 g was pretreated in H2 flow at 350 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in a He flow, the catalyst sample was exposed to a 10 vol% NH3/N2 flow for 30 min for saturation adsorption of NH3. The NH3-TPD profiles were collected from room temperature to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 in a He flow of 30 mL min-1. CO pulse adsorption experiments were performed on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorption apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to determine the amount of active sites of our catalysts. The sample of 0.2 g was prereduced with 10 vol% H2/N2 (30 mL min-1) at 350 °C for 1 h, and then cooled down to 50 °C in He. After that, a gas mixture of 10 % CO/He was pulsed to the reactor every 3 min until the response from the detector showed no further uptake."
4,Evaluation of DMO hydrogenation reactions,"2.3 Evaluation of DMO hydrogenation reactions The catalytic performance in DMO hydrogenation was carried out in a stainless-steel fixed-bed tubular reactor (300 mm length by 8 mm inner diameter). Briefly, circular catalyst chips of 0.5 g were packed layer by layer into the tube reactor and activated in a pure H2 flow at the target temperature (300−450 °C) for 1 h. After cooling down to the reaction temperature and raising the H2 pressure to desired value, the DMO methanol solution (13 wt%) was fed into the catalyst bed reactor by passing through a evaporator (200 °C) first. The reaction temperature, molar ratio of H2 to DMO, weight hourly space velocity to DMO (WHSVDMO) and reaction pressure were varied from 180 to 250 °C, 45–180, 0.22 to 1.32 h−1 and 0.5–3.5 MPa, respectively. The liquid effluent was collected by a cold trap (−5 °C) and analyzed on a Shimadzu 2014C gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) with a 30 m HP-INNOWax capillary column (DIMKA). The DMO conversion and products selectivity were calculated based on the following general equations: DMO conversion % = 1- f DMO A DMO, out Σ f i A i,out + f DMO A DMO, out × 100% Selectivity % = f i A i, out Σ f i A i, out × 100% where Ai,out and fi are the chromatographic peak area at the outlet and the relative molar calibration factor of the individual product i (i = MG, ethylene glycol (EG), EtOH, MA, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, butanol, isobutanol, propanol and isopropanol, respectively). The intrinsic activity of the catalysts was quantified by turnover frequency (TOF), which is the total number of DMO molecules transformed into the desired product by one active site (here assuming that one FeNi3 is one active site) per unit time under defined reaction conditions. The amount of FeNi3 active sites (N FeNi3) was calculated based on the following general equations according to Wang et al. [40]. N FeNi 3 = 1 4 × N CO × 4 Fe 0 atom% Ni 0 atom%+ Fe 0 atom% where N co is the chemisorbed CO number determined by CO pulse chemisorption, Fe0 atom% (i.e., surface Fe0 from FeNi3; one surface Fe0 nonresponses a FeNi3 including one Fe0 and three Ni0 atoms) and Ni0 atom% (i.e., surface Ni0 from both FeNi3 and Ni-foam) are determined by XPS. Notably, it is assumed that one FeNi3 can chemisorb 4 CO molecules and one Ni0 atom from Ni-foam can chemisorb 1 CO molecule. In addition, prior to experiments for activation energy calculation, the external diffusion effect on the catalyst performance was ruled out (Fig. S1), and the internal diffusion and heat transfer resistances were also excluded due to the thin catalytic layer and high thermal conductivity of Ni-foam [25,41,42]. Testing experiments for TOF and activation energy calculations were performed at low conversion of below 15 % by controlling the reactant weight hour space velocity."

6,"“Top-down” fabrication, monolithic feature, micromorphology, nanostructure and performance of the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst","3.1 “Top-down” fabrication, monolithic feature, micromorphology, nanostructure and performance of the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst The monolithic Ni-foam substrate has an excellent heat-transferring ability for rapidly dissipating the reaction heat, but its extremely low specific surface area (SSA) is detrimental to highly dispersing the catalytic components. To fabricate a nanostructured catalytic layer with micrometric thickness onto Ni-foam is an effective strategy to make Ni-foam to be an efficient catalyst, and such layer can be endogenously grown onto the Ni-foam surface by taking advantage of its own high chemical activity [36,38,39,43,44]. Fig. 1 A schematically illustrates the “top-down” fabrication strategy for our representative FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst: a uniform and ultrathin porous layer consisting of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (∼30 nm thick; Fig. S2A) is in situ grown onto the Ni-foam struts by a facile hydrothermal process (under optimal hydrothermal conditions: 100 °C, 6 h, 10 mmol L−1 Ni(NO3)·6H2O, 40 mmol L−1 NH4F; see details in Fig. S3), followed by incipiently impregnated with an aqueous solution containing required amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O; after calcined at 550 °C and reduced at 350 °C, the target catalyst can be obtained. The samples collected at different stages of the catalyst preparation were probed by XRD, with the results shown in Fig. 1B,C. After hydrothermal treatment, the formation of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets on Ni-foam is evidenced by the characteristic XRD peaks at 33.2°, 38.6° and 59.3° (JCPDS No. 73-1520; pattern a). After impregnation with iron nitrate and subsequent calcination at 550 °C, the characteristic XRD peaks of NiFe2O4 compound appear at 30.3°, 35.7° and 57.4° (JCPDS No. 74-2081; pattern b) in association with the formation of NiO phase (37.3°, 43.3°, 62.9° and 75.4°, JCPDS No. 04-0835; pattern b). After the reduction of as-obtained NiFe2O4-NiO/Ni-foam in H2 at 350 °C, three asymmetrical XRD peaks are detected (pattern c). Given the similar atomic radius of Fe and Ni, the XRD peaks and lattice distance of FeNi3 are close to these of metallic Ni. In order to distinguish FeNi3 and Ni, this XRD pattern is deconvoluted via a Gaussian peak fitting method, and the peaks observed at 44.3°, 51.5° and 75.9° are attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of FeNi3 (Fig. 1C, red line for FeNi3 (JCPDS No. 38-0419) and blue line for Ni (JCPDS No. 04-0850)). The FeNi3 particle size is estimated to be 18 nm according to Scherrer equation on the basis of its (111) XRD peak, close to that (∼16 nm) observed by TEM (Fig. S2B,C). In this representative catalyst, the overall Fe content is determined to be 12.1 wt% (including the mass of Ni-foam substrate) by ICP-AES (Table S1), and the Fe content existing as FeNi3 is estimated by XRD to be about 10.3 wt%, accounting for 85.1 % of the overall Fe content. Moreover, Fig. 1D,E illustrates a nanoparticle (marked by a green dashed circle), whose lattice fringes give an inter planar distance of 0.204 nm corresponding to FeNi3 (111) plane or Ni (111) plane. However, the HAADF-STEM mappings show a homogeneous distribution of Ni and Fe in this nanoparticle, confirming the formation of FeNi3 instead of Ni (Fig. 1F,G). Furthermore, 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy is a powerful tool to ascertain the chemical state of iron species in catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1H and Table S2, the FeNi3 is identified based on the sextet with hyperfine magnetic field (Hfh) of 29.3 and 27.1 T [45,46]. There is paramagnetic doublet with an isomer shift (IS) of 0.33 mm s-1 and a quadrupole splitting (QS) of 0.93 mm s-1 attributed to the Fe2+ species, and the sextuplet with IS of 0.74 mm s-1, QS of 0.48 mm s-1, and Hfh of 46.5 T is ascribed to Fe3+ species (Fig. 1H) [45,46]. In addition, the Fe2p XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 1I with four deconvoluted peaks: one at 706.5 eV for Fe0 species in FeNi3 [31,47,48], other two at 709.8 and 712.2 eV for the Fe2+ and Fe3+, respectively, and the last one at 719.4 eV for the satellite peak [34,49]. Obviously, the Fe species cannot be fully alloyed with Ni to form FeNi3 during 1 h H2 reduction at 350 °C, while the coexisting FeOx species are enriched on the catalyst surface (the Fe2p3/2 region dominated by Fe2+ and Fe3+ peaks) in the form of extremely small particles or clusters according to Somorjai et al. [49], which is consistent with the fact of no any detectable FeOx XRD peak (Fig. 1B,C). Exactly, the HRTEM image in Fig. S4A shows the existence of clear interface (marked by red dashed line) between FeNi3 and FeOx (for example Fe3O4), and the HAADF-STEM mapping in Fig. S4B,C visually illustrates the Fe-rich but Ni-barren locals (marked by dashed circles: white for Ni, yellow for Fe), further confirming the FeNi3-FeOx nanocomposite structure. In Fig. 1J, the SEM image and the optical photograph (insert) show the three-dimensional open-cell structure composed of interconnected porous framework in the real FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) circular chip. Interestingly, the FeNi3-FeOx nanocomposites mounted on the Ni-foam, with superior mechanical robustness and strong adhesion (Fig. S2D), are still characteristic of nanosheets that disorderedly aligned to form honeycomb-like porous layer with a thickness of about 3 μm (Fig. 1K-M). In consequence, the SSA is increased to 2.4 m2 g-1 for such catalyst from 0.3 m2 g−1 for the pristine Ni-foam. Undoubtedly, our top-down evolutionary approach achieves an effective and efficient engineering of the FeNi3-FeOx composites onto the Ni-foam at “nano-meso-macro” triple-scale levels of structure, making the catalyst development and reaction engineering go hand in hand [36,37]. As is shown in the follow-up sections, formation of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposites on the Ni-foam is paramount for getting superior FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam catalyst, in nature, deriving plentiful interface between FeNi3 nanoalloy and FeOx fragments. The preferred FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst is capable of fully converting DMO with 98 % EtOH selectivity at 230 °C and 2.5 MPa using a WHSVDMO of 0.44 h−1 and a H2/DMO molar ratio of 90. Moreover, the contrastive catalysts of Ni/SiO2, FeOx/SiO2 and Ni(OH)2/Ni-foam (all pre-reduced in H2 at 350 °C prior to reaction) were tested in the DMO-to-EtOH reaction, achieving a quite low EtOH selectivity of less than 2% with a low DMO conversion of no more than 43 % (Table S3 and Fig. S5). The above results indicate that neither Ni nor FeOx is active and selective for the DMO-to-EtOH reaction. But it is expected that the FeNi3/SiO2 contrastive catalyst (confirmed by XRD in Fig. S5) shows markedly improved activity and selectivity, achieving 99.7 % DMO conversion with EtOH/MA selectivity of 77.9 %/14.0 % (Table S3). Specially, once the FeOx is generated in association of FeNi3 formation on the SiO2 support (Fig. S5), the as-obtained FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2 contrastive catalyst become more selective and active in comparison with the FeNi3/SiO2, being capable of almost fully converting DMO with a further improved EtOH selectivity of 86.4 % while leading to a remarkable reduction of MA selectivity to 8.1 %. Nevertheless, the catalytic performance of the FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2 is still inferior to that of our preferred FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst (98 % EtOH selectivity with full DMO conversion under identical reaction conditions). To understand the better catalytic performance of our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst, a series of characterizations (including ICP, XRD, TEM, BET, CO-uptake, and XPS) were employed on the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) as well as the FeNi3/SiO2 and FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2. As shown in Table S4, the Fe total content in all catalysts is almost identical in the range of 12.1–13.1 wt%. In addition, the specific surface area of our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) is much lower than that of FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2, and thus the particle size of FeNi3 alloy for our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) is bigger than that for the FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2 catalyst. Besides, the surface atom contents of Fe0 (attributed to FeNi3) and FeOx for the FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2 and FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalysts are almost identical (Fe0: 12 % vs 9%; FeOx: 44 % vs 44 %). What to be noted is that the low DMO conversion and EtOH selectivity were obtained over the pristine Ni-foam and Ni(OH)2/Ni-foam sample (Table S3), which reveals that the Ni-foam substrate contributes a negligible activity for DMO hydrogenation to EtOH. It is thus rational to infer that the superior catalytic performance of our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst over the FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2 is most likely due to its enhanced heat/mass transfer that is central to the notion of increasing the steady-state volumetric reaction rate. Furthermore, He et al. reported a Fe5C2 catalyst that is obtained by carbonization in a methanol-H2 mixture, and an 89.6 % EtOH yield was achieved at 260 °C and 2.5 MPa using a WHSVDMO of 0.2 h−1 and a H2/DMO molar ratio of 180 [30]. One question naturally arises as to whether Fe5C2 will be formed on our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam during the reaction. To answer this question, the contrastive catalyst of Fe5C2/SiO2 was prepared and tested under our reaction conditions, but a very low DMO conversion of 22.4 % with 53.4 % EtOH selectivity is displayed, much lower than those of our FeNi3-FeOx/SiO2 catalyst (Table S3). Our used catalysts of FeNi3/SiO2, FeOx/SiO2 and FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) after 20 h reaction at 230 °C were probed by XRD, and no characteristic XRD patterns of Fe5C2 were detected (Fig. S5, Fig. 1B,C), indicating that the FeNi3 species and FeOx species could not be converted into Fe5C2 under our reaction conditions. It is thus rational to infer that the FeNi3-FeOx governs the catalyst performance, and Fe5C2 is not the main active species even if it exists in our catalyst."
7,Essential of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposite buildup,"3.2 Essential of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposite buildup 3.2.1 Toward improved activity/selectivity To reveal whether the formation of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposites as illustrated in Fig. 1A is essential for fabricating a superior catalyst, a series of catalyst precursors were prepared by synthesizing Ni(OH)2/Ni-foam (under optimal hydrothermal conditions: 100 °C, 6 h, 10 mmol L−1 Ni(NO3)·6H2O, 40 mmol L−1 NH4F; see details in Fig. S3) followed by impregnating with Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and calcining at temperature ranging from 350 to 550 °C. The corresponding catalysts obtained by reduction in H2 at 350 °C for 1 h, denoted as FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(350/350), -(450/350), and -(550/350), were initially examined in the DMO hydrogenation to EtOH at 230 °C and 2.5 MPa under a H2/DMO molar ratio of 90 and a WHSVDMO of 0.44 h−1, with the results shown in Fig. 2 A. When increasing the calcination temperature from 350 to 550 °C, the EtOH selectivity was remarkably increased from 82.1%–97.5% with full DMO conversion while the formation of intermediate products (MG, MA and EG) was rapidly diminished. In addition, the effect of calcination temperature on the intrinsic catalyst activity was also investigated by measuring the turnover frequency (TOF) at 180 °C against the catalyst calcination temperature, with the results shown in Fig. 2B and Table S5. Clearly, the intrinsic activity of the catalysts is also markedly dependent on the calcination temperature. The TOF for the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst with the calcination temperature of 550 °C is 88.8 h-1, higher than 69.5 h-1 and 50.4 h-1 for the catalysts calcined at 450 °C (FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(450/350)) and 350 °C (FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(350/350)). What needs to be noted here is that further increasing the calcination temperature to 600 °C severely damages the monolithic structure of Ni-foam due to the excessive oxidative corrosion. Taking this issue into account, the calcination temperature is optimized to be 550 °C. Naturally, a question arising is why the calcination temperature makes so huge difference in the catalyst activity/selectivity for the DMO-to-EtOH reaction. To figure out this question, the catalyst precursors calcined respectively at 350, 450 and 550 °C in air, but not subjected to reduction activation with H2 were characterized by XRD, with the patterns shown in Fig. 3 A. Obviously, no any diffraction peak of Fe-containing species except NiO (JCPDS No. 04-0835) and Ni (JCPDS No. 04-0850, from Ni-foam substrate) is detected for the sample calcined at 350 °C, whereas three new weak peaks for the sample calcined at 450 °C are observed at 30.3°, 35.7° and 57.4°, which are well indexed as NiFe2O4 (JCPDS No. 74-2081). Further increasing the calcination temperature to 550 °C strengthens the XRD peaks of the NiFe2O4 as well as NiO. As estimated by XRD [40], the NiFe2O4 compound furnishes a Fe content of about 11.6 % for the sample calcined at 550 °C, which is close to the total Fe content measured by ICP-AES (12.1 %, Table S1), revealing that almost all of the Fe elements are transformed into NiFe2O4 spinel. Moreover, the Raman spectroscopy was employed to further probe the evolution of the compounds formation against the calcination temperature, with the spectra displayed in Fig. 3B. For the sample calcined at 350 °C, an apparent vibration mode at 663 cm−1 for the Fe3O4 is observed, whereas the ones at 482 and 691 cm−1 for the NiFe2O4 [47,50–52] can be evidently observed for the samples calcined at 450 °C and 550 °C with stronger intensity for the latter. Notably, the Fe2+ in Fe3O4 is originated from the reaction of Fe3+ with Ni-foam substrate (Fe3+ + Ni → Fe2+ + Ni2+). Furthermore, all samples show obvious vibration mode for NiO at 560 cm−1 [52]. Clearly, the Raman results are in good agreement with the XRD results. Undoubtedly, the formation of NiFe2O4 spinel (or NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposite) is really improved by elevating the calcination temperature, and most notably, this observation is closely linked with the marked improvement of catalyst activity and selectivity (Fig. 2 and Table S5). 3.2.2 Amount tuning of FeOx around FeNi3 nanoalloys Subsequently, the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(350/350), -(450/350), and -(550/350) catalysts were obtained by reducing these three catalyst precursors in Fig. 3 with H2 at 350 °C for 1 h, and characterized carefully to monitor whether the formation of NiFe2O4 spinel is closely related to the generation of highly active/selective FeNi3-FeOx composite active structure or not. As shown in Fig. 4 A, NiO phase disappear for these three catalysts and FeNi3 phase is detected. In addition, these catalysts deliver compatible diffraction intensities as well as widths at half height of FeNi3 peaks, indicating that the FeNi3 amount and particle size are all similar for these catalysts (Table S1). Moreover, all catalysts present similar SEM surface morphology (Fig. S6A-C), and the TEM images (Fig. S6D-I) confirm their similar FeNi3 size again. Their other physicochemical properties are also identical in terms of Fe content and textural properties (dispersion of FeNi3, SSA, pore volume and mean pore diameter, Table S1). On the basis of above results, clearly, the formation of FeNi3 is not subject to the formation of NiFe2O4 spinel that is governed by the calcination temperature. However, it is still not clear whether the formation of NiFe2O4 spinel is essential for tailoring and tuning the chemical micro-environment around the FeNi3 particles during the reduction of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposites in H2 at 350 °C, which cannot be discerned by above XRD and TEM/SEM measurements but might govern the catalyst activity and selectivity. To verify this conjecture, all three catalysts same as in Fig. 4A were probed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy and in-situ XPS, with the results shown in Fig. 4B-D. Clearly, all catalysts offer the vibration mode of Fe3O4 at band of 663 cm−1 [50–52], and with increasing the calcination temperature from 350 to 550 °C, these bands become stronger, indicating that high calcination temperature favors the formation of FeOx on catalyst surface. Additionally, the Ni2p3/2 region displays three peaks (Fig. 4C): the one at 852.2 eV for Ni0 species in FeNi3 alloy, the one at 855.2 eV for Ni2+ in NiO, and the one at 860.4 eV for satellite peak [47,52]. The signal attributed to Fe2p is dominated by Fe2+ and/or Fe3+ [53,54], revealing that most surface Fe species exist as FeOx (Fig. 4D). As shown in Table 1 , the surface atom content of Ni0 and Ni2+ species for these three catalysts are almost identical (35 %–38 % and 12 %–13 %, respectively), implying that the formation of NiFe2O4 has nothing to do with the Ni species distribution. Interestingly, the surface Fe2+/Fe3+ content shows an upward trend (36 %, 39 %, and 44 %) with the calcination temperature of 350 °C (FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(350/350)), 450 °C (FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(450/350)), and 550 °C (FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350)), whereas the surface Fe0 shows a reverse trend (13 %, 12 %, and 9%). Moreover, the surface atomic ratio of Ni0 to Fe0 upwardly deviates from the 3/1 of FeNi3 with elevating the calcination temperature from 350 to 550 °C (2.92, 3.08, and 3.89; Table 1), in association with a decrease of the surface atomic ratio of Ni (total) to Fe (total) from 1.04 to 0.88. On the basis of above results, we are confident that the adequate formation of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposites at elevated calcination temperature (Fig. 3) facilitates generation of more FeOx segments around the FeNi3 nanoalloys. As illustrated in Fig. 4E, a possible explanation is that the sufficient formation of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposite makes Fe-Ni alloying to form FeNi3 difficult and thereby leaves more FeOx behind. This is because the NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposite have relatively large size of NiFe2O4 (18 nm) and NiO (19 nm), which decreases the sufficient contacting between NiFe2O4 and NiO, thereby offering a high resistance of Ni (from NiO reduction) diffusing into NiFe2O4 particle during the reduction treatment (Fig. 4E). This is also the main cause for the higher Ni/Fe atomic ratio of 3.89 (Table 1) in the case of FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350), likely because of the existence of Ni concentration gradient during outside to inside alloying of the NiFe2O4-derived particle in H2. On the contrary, high dispersion of FeOx (undetectable by XRD) onto 15 nm NiO particles undoubtedly gets Fe alloying with more Ni (form NiO) easily (Fig. 4E), especially in case of the catalyst with a low calcination temperature of 350 °C. Indeed, the H2-TPR profiles show that the reduction peaks of Fe3+-to-Fe2+ and Fe2+-to-Fe0 show a continuous but slight shift to high temperature along with increasing the calcination temperature from 350 °C to 550 °C (Fig. S7). Undoubtedly, the NiFe2O4 formation retards the reduction of Fe3+ and Fe2+ species during 1 h reduction treatment in H2 at 350 °C, and therefore relatively high remnant of FeOx species is not surprising at all. 3.2.3 Enhanced amount of interface between FeNi3 and FeOx Now, it is convincing to conclude that the organization of NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposite onto Ni-foam is essential for getting a superior FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam catalyst for the DMO-to-EtOH process, in nature, being able to endow the reduced catalyst with plentiful interface between FeNi3 nanoalloy and FeOx fragments (Fig. 1B-I). To further confirm this verdict, a series of FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam catalysts, with tuned FeOx contents, were prepared by reducing the NiFe2O4-NiO/Ni-foam (calcined at 550 °C) with H2 at 300−550 °C for 1 h and were characterized using XPS (Table 2 and Fig. S8) and examined in the DMO-to-EtOH reaction (Fig. S9). As shown in Table 2, clearly, the content of surface FeOx species (Fe2++Fe 3+) gradually decreases from 51 % to 32 % with the reduction temperature increasing from 300 to 450 °C; and as expected, the surface atomic ratio of Ni (total) to Fe (total) is increased from 0.78 to 1.13 while the surface atomic ratio of Ni0 to Fe0 gets gradually close to 3/1 of the FeNi3. Although the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/300) catalyst (i.e., reduced at 300 °C) shows the highest surface FeOx content of 51 %, it is inactive for the DMO-to-EtOH reaction (delivering a very low EtOH selectivity of only 8.1 % with a DMO conversion of 49.8 %; Fig. S9A). This is because the reduction temperature of 300 °C is too low to reduce enough NiFe2O4-NiO nanocomposites into FeNi3 (XRD results in Fig. S9B), which is consistent with the extremely low surface Fe0 (from FeNi3) content of only 5% (Table 2). This observation in turn indicates that the FeNi3 alloy is essential for the catalyst performance. When the reduction temperature is at and above 350 °C, the FeNi3 alloy is formed with almost identical diffraction intensity (Fig. S9B), whereas the DMO conversion slightly declines from 100 % to 93.1 % with a sharp drop of EtOH selectivity from 97.5%–72.1% with increasing the reduction temperature from 350 °C to 450 °C (Fig. S9A). In Fig. S10, moreover, the EtOH selectivity over the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(m/n) catalysts were plotted against their surface FeOx contents as listed in Table 1 and Table 2, intuitively showing that the EtOH selectivity is positively correlated with the catalyst surface FeOx contents."
8,Role of FeOx in highly active/selective FeNi3-FeOx nano-structure,"3.3 Role of FeOx in highly active/selective FeNi3-FeOx nano-structure As noted above, the catalyst reduced at 300 °C (i.e., FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/300)) possesses the highest surface FeOx content (Table 2) but not sufficiently forms FeNi3 phase (Fig. S9B), thus delivering very low DMO conversion and EtOH selectivity (Fig. S9A). In addition, the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) and FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/450) catalysts possess size and content similarity of FeNi3 particles (Fig. S9B); but the latter is less active and selective than the former (Fig. S9A), which is closely related to the decrease of surface FeOx content (Fig. S10). In a word, the catalyst activity and selectivity are primarily governed by FeNi3 nanoalloy but can be further improved by FeOx additive with suitable amount, owing to plentiful interface between FeNi3 nanoalloy and FeOx fragments (see 3.2.3. and Fig. 1B-I). Actually, numerous studies have proved that the metal-oxide interface is crucial for the high catalyst performance [55–57]. For instance, the interface between Pt-Fe nanoalloy and FeOx is favorable to adsorb and activate carbonyl group in acetone, thereby effectively enhancing its hydrogenation to isopropanol [35]. Notwithstanding the foregoing advance, the role of FeOx in the highly active and selective FeNi3-FeOx nano-structure is still not clear. It has been generally recognized that the catalyst acidity is an important factor to promote the hydrogenation of ester and hydroxyl groups, originating from their intensified activation via adsorbing and polarizing the oxygen atom in these groups [18,58–61]. For example, Li et al. [18] reported that proper acid sites can facilitate to activate CO and CO bonds in DMO to promote its hydrogenation to EtOH. Therefore, the surface acid property of our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(m/n) catalysts was investigated using NH3-TPD, with the profiles shown in Fig. 5 . Only one wide NH3 desorption peak located at about 160 °C emerges on all catalysts studied, being contributed to the weakly chemisorbed NH3 on FeOx surface [62,63]. With increasing the catalyst calcination temperature from 350 °C to 550 °C (fixing reduction temperature at 350 °C), the peak intensity becomes stronger (Fig. 5A), indicating the enhancement of surface acid sites. For the catalysts calcined at 550 °C followed by H2 reduction with elevating temperature from 350 to 450 °C, the peak intensity becomes weakened (Fig. 5B). The above results in Fig. 5 indicate that the surface acid sites are enhanced by elevating the catalyst calcination temperature but oppositely decreased by elevating the catalyst reduction temperature, which is in positive accord with the increase (or decrease) trend of surface FeOx amount with the increase in the calcination (or reduction) temperature (Table 1 and Table 2). Moreover, kinetic studies of all involved reactions (including DMO-to-MG, MG-to-EG, EG-to-EtOH, MG-to-MA, and MA-to-EtOH, Scheme S1) were carried out on the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(m/350) catalysts, and their apparent activation energy (E a) was calculated with the results shown in in Table 3 and Fig. S11. Notably, the E a for each reaction step decreases in the order of FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) > FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(450/350) > FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(350/350); that is, the higher the acid site amount is (Fig. 5A; i.e., the higher FeOx content, Table 1), the lower the E a will be. Based on above results, it is thus believed that the FeOx plays a role in providing acid sites at FeNi3-FeOx interface to activate the ester groups in DMO as well as the as-formed hydroxyl groups, thereby markedly improving its hydrogenation to EtOH."
9,Reaction pathway for DMO-to-EtOH on FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam,"3.4 Reaction pathway for DMO-to-EtOH on FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam It has been mentioned that the DMO hydrogenation to EtOH occurs through two parallel pathways (Fig. 6 A): (1) DMO hydrogenation to MG followed by MG to EG and EG to EtOH; (2) MG hydrogenation to MA followed by MA further hydrogenation to EtOH. To elucidate which pathway the reaction mainly follows, the intermediate products of MG, EG, and MA were respectively subjected to hydrogenation experiments over the FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350). The reaction rate for each reaction was measured at low conversion by controlling weight hour space velocities, with the results shown in Fig. 6B,C. For the MG hydrogenation, as reaction temperature increases, the reaction rate for the MG-to-MA and that of the MG-to-EG gradually increase, but the former is always higher than the latter in the whole temperature range studied (Fig. 6B), implying that MG tends to be hydrogenated to EG instead of MA. In addition, the reaction rate for the EG-to-EtOH is much higher than that of MA-to-EtOH at each temperature (Fig. 6C), indicating that EG hydrogenation to EtOH is much easier than MA to EtOH. On the basis of above results, we are confident that the DMO-to-EtOH reaction, catalyzed by our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350), mainly follows pathway 1. As shown in Table 3, an E a of 38 kJ mol−1 is attained for the MG-to-EG reaction step in pathway 1, much lower than that (48 kJ mol−1) for the MG-to-MA in pathway 2. Moreover, the EG-to-EtOH reaction in pathway 1 has an E a of 40 kJ mol−1, also much lower than that (55 kJ mol−1) for the MA-to-EtOH in pathway 2. The above results consolidate again that the target EtOH product is preferentially formed via the further hydrogenation of intermediate EG (i.e., pathway 1) instead of MA (i.e., pathway 2) over our catalyst (Fig. 6A)."
10,Catalyst superiority,"3.5 Catalyst superiority Stability is a significant consideration for the heterogeneous catalysts in their practical applications. The long-term DMO-to-EtOH test was carried out over the preferred FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst screened out by optimizing the preparation conditions (to see details in Fig. S3). The testing was initially carried out at 230 °C and 2.5 MPa using a H2/DMO molar ratio of 90 and a WHSVDMO of 0.44 h−1, showing a full DMO conversion with around 98 % EtOH selectivity within first 500 h (Fig. 7 A). To rule out the possibility that the stable catalysis was caused by using excessive catalyst, subsequently, the WHSVDMO was increased to 2.0 h−1 and the H2/DMO molar ratio was decreased to 60 for further testing at a conversion far away from 100 % (Fig. 7B). As shown in Fig. 7B, the DMO conversion of about 58 % with selectivity of 16 % to EtOH, 45 % to MG, 29 % to EG, and 10 % to MA can be obtained and maintained within another 150 h. Finally, such catalyst was tested again under the identical reaction conditions as in Fig.7A. Not surprisingly, that catalyst is still capable of fully converting DMO with 98 % ethanol selectivity within the remaining 50 h (Fig. 7C). Undoubtedly, our FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst shows excellent activity/selectivity maintenance throughout entire 700 h testing. As indicated by SEM/TEM images in Fig. 7D,E, no exfoliation of FeNi3-FeOx layer, no collapse of nanosheets structure, and no sintering of primary FeNi3 nanoparticles (still ∼15 nm) are observed on such used catalyst (Fig. 1J-M). Moreover, the Fe content and textural properties (dispersion of FeNi3, SSA, pore volume and mean pore diameter) of the used catalyst are also the same as those of the fresh catalyst (Table S4). Furthermore, the amount of surface acid sites for the used catalyst (67 mmol/g) are close to that of the fresh catalyst (74 mmol/g, Fig. 7F), indicating that the content of surface FeOx still remains almost unchanged after such long-term test, which can be solidly confirmed by XPS as well (42 % vs 44 %, Fig. 7G). We thus are confident that, on the basis of the above evidences, the well-preserved morphological and structural properties as well as the stable surface FeOx content guarantee the high activity/selectivity for the long-term DMO hydrogenation to EtOH process. To obtain a high EtOH yield above 90 %, the conventional Cu/SiO2 catalyst requires a reaction temperature of at least 270 °C and H2/DMO ratio of at least 150 (Table S7); in contrast, our catalyst achieves a big decrease of the temperature and H2/DMO molar to 220 °C and 90, respectively (Fig. S12). In addition, over the Cu/SiO2 catalyst a series of side-reactions also occur to produce C3-C4 diols (e.g., butanol, isobutanol, propanol, and isopropanol) and ethers (e.g., 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol) [64,65], especially at high temperature (about 23 % diols/ethers selectivity at 290 °C [12]). So the temperature window of the DMO-to-EtOH over Cu/SiO2 is very narrow (less than 20 °C at >90 % EtOH yield). Interestingly, our catalyst gives extremely low selectivity of <0.1 % to C3-C4 diols and ethers even at 250 °C, displaying a wider temperature window (at least 30 °C) for high EtOH selectivity (>90 %) maintenance, which is significantly important in industry because the DMO-to-EtOH always faces a temperature rise in catalyst bed more or less caused by the strong exothermicity (ΔH = -145.93 kJ mol−1) of this reaction. Moreover, recycling large amounts of excess high-pressure H2 is necessary in the DMO hydrogenation processes, and high H2/DMO mole ratio will lead to massive energy consumption and requires high cost industrial devices. Thus, the excellent EtOH yield and long-term stability facilely obtained over our catalyst under mild reaction conditions guarantee a feasible prospect in the industrial application."
11,Conclusions,"A promising Ni-foam-structured FeNi3-FeOx nanocomposite catalyst engineered from nano- to macro-scales with unique combination of high catalytic performance and high thermal conductivity is developed for the strongly exothermic DMO hydrogenation to EtOH reaction. Such catalyst is derived from NiFe2O4-NiO composites structured onto a Ni-foam (100 PPI) followed by reduction in H2. The NiFe2O4-NiO/Ni-foam is obtained by impregnation of self-supported hydrothermal-synthesized Ni(OH)2/Ni-foam with aqueous solution of iron(III) nitrate and calcination treatment. The preferred FeNi3-FeOx/Ni-foam-(550/350) catalyst is obtainable merely by calcining at 550 °C (to form NiFe2O4-NiO composites) and reducing at 350 °C (to transform NiFe2O4-NiO into FeNi3-FeOx), capable of fully converting DMO with 98 % ethanol selectivity at 230 °C and 2.5 MPa using a WHSVDMO of 0.44 h−1 and a H2/DMO molar ratio of 90, and particularly, stable for at least 700 h without any sign of deactivation. To the best of our knowledge, the reaction temperature and H2/DMO molar ratio are lower than those (at least 270 °C and 150) for the conventional Cu/SiO2 catalyst. Moreover, the control experiments reveal that EtOH is formed over our catalyst dominantly through the continuous hydrogenation of intermediate ethylene glycol instead of methyl acetate hydrogenation. In nature, our NiFe2O4-NiO derivation strategy endows the catalyst with plentiful interface between FeNi3 nanoalloy and FeOx fragments (acting as acid sites), achieving the synergistic catalysis to activate ester groups in DMO as well as the as-formed hydroxyl groups, thereby markedly improving its hydrogenation to EtOH."
