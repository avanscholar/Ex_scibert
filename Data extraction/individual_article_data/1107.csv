0,Introduction,"At the end of 2017, 15,364 scientist signatories from 184 countries penned the “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice” [1]. One of these important warnings is the current trajectory of potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels [1,2]. More recently, 415 ppm of atmospheric carbon dioxide level had been broken in May 2019. Fossil fuels cannot be produced at this rate indefinitely [1–4]. To address the challenges of impending global energy needs and worsening environmental problems, great efforts have been devoted to exploiting renewable and clean alternative energy sources [5–15]. Conversion of solar energy into sustainable H2 by photocatalytic splitting of water has been consequently identified as a promising solution to tackle the environmental and energy issues, because photocatalytic H2-evolution can be driven by inexhaustible solar energy under mild reaction conditions [16–20]. However, photocatalytic H2-evolution currently faces many challenging issues for practical application. The most important is the low photocatalytic reaction efficiency [21–23]. To addressing this problem, one solution is developing new photocatalysts to improve reaction rate from kinetics aspect. For example, various composites and cocatalysts were explored to aggrandize separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers (photoexcited holes and electrons) [23–31]. Another way is searching new photocatalytic reaction system for H2 evolution, which is favored thermodynamically as the ΔG < 0, such as the hole-scavenger reaction system (e.g., methanol and Na2S/Na2SO3) [31–33]. However, the current photocatalytic H2-evolution system is still not to meet application requirements. It is known that a reaction is controlled by thermodynamics and kinetics [15]. Thus, simultaneous improving reaction thermodynamics and kinetics may be an ideal approach to enhance photocatalytic H2-evolution efficiency entirely. For example, triple composite CdS/CoP@RGO was reported for photocatalytic dehydrogenation of formic acid into H2 [32]. Biomass and biomass-relevant organic matters were used for photocatalytic H2-evolution [4,34–39]. In these photocatalytic reaction systems, composite photocatalysts could promote charge carriers separation, and organic matters could reduce Gibbs free energy of H2 evolution (e.g., HCOOH → CO2 + H2, ΔGo = -48.8 kJ mol−1; ArCH2OH → ArCHO + H2, ΔGo =28 kJ mol−1; H2O→ 1/2O2 + H2, ΔGo =238 kJ mol−1) [4,38]. Among these, photocatalytic transformation of well-sourced biomass-relevant organic matters into H2 has attracted huge attention [36,35–39]. However, most study focused on H2 energy or organic synthesis, the transformation selectivity of these organic matters or H2 production was ignored. For instance, only 20 % 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was converted into 2,5-diformylfuran over Ni/CdS photocatalyst under blue LED light for 22 h, and the production of H2 was also much lower [36]. Although the conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural could be enhanced to 40 % over ZnxCd1-xS-P (P-doped ZnxCd1−xS with rich S vacancies) photocatalyst under white LED light for 8 h, the selectivity of 2,5-diformylfuran and H2 evolution rate were only 65 % and 419 μmol g-1 h-1 (the dosage of photocatalyst is 1 mg), respectively [37]. Notably, the products and their selectivity are unquestionably important to the eco-environment and practical application. Recently, our group found that alcohols could be efficiently transformed into the corresponding aldehydes or alkanes/ethers with high selectivity by regulating energy band positions of photocatalysts and controlling the reaction conditions [40–43]. Consequently, developing photocatalysts for simultaneous improving thermodynamics and kinetics of H2 evolution and coupling with selective transformation of biomass-relevant organic matters into high-value-added fine chemicals with high selectivity meanwhile generation of H2 may be a new direction and a breach of photocatalysis. For this purpose, herein, noble metal-free 2D/2D-3D NiS/Zn3In2S6 (NiS/ZIS) hierarchical architecture photocatalyst was successfully fabricated by one-step hydrothermal method and was applied for visible-light-driven photocatalytic dehydrogenation of biomass-relevant alcohols into H2 and high-value-added fine chemicals in one reaction system under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 1 , prices of raw material and product are listed in the Supporting Information). 2D-3D Zn3In2S6 (ZIS) hierarchical architecture and 2D NiS were chosen to be primary catalyst and cocatalyst, respectively, which is based on the follow reasons: (1) ZIS is a visible-light response semiconductor, which possesses excellent photoelectric properties, such as forceful visible light absorption with a band-gap of about 2.8 eV, suitable band positions (conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB)) with strong enough redox potentials for alcohols oxidation and H+ reduction, and tunable energy band structure [42–46]. (2) 3D ZIS assembled by 2D ZIS would be conducive to harvesting the induced visible light via multi-layer reflection, separating charge carriers and loading cocatalyst with maximum contact interfaces [47–51]. (3) 2D NiS has metal properties with high electrical conductivity [23–27,52–55]. The work function of NiS (5.5 eV) is so closed to that of Pt (5.65 eV) that can enhance photoelectric conversion efficiency and photocatalytic H2-evolution [38,52]. NiS as cocatalyst could facilitate charge carriers separation and the adsorption-reduction-desorption process of H2 [23–25,27,53,53,54,55]. In addition, 2D/2D heterostructure could provide maximum contact interfaces and reactive sites [45,48–51]. Therefore, 2D/2D-3D NiS/ZIS nanocomposite would exhibit expectable photocatalytic activity for selective photoredox of biomass-relevant alcohols into H2 and fine chemicals in one reaction system under mild reaction conditions. In the study, conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) with high selectivity has been realized via optimizing synthesis condition and the transformation mechanism of HMF has been investigated by several techniques. We believe that the developed conversion process could possess its intrinsic clean and non-carbon features, and it would contribute to the human’s sustainable and green development."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of NiS-modified Zn3In2S6 nanocomposites,"2.1 Preparation of NiS-modified Zn3In2S6 nanocomposites NiS-modified Zn3In2S6 nanocomposites were synthesized by one-step and two-step hydrothermal method, respectively. 2D/2D-3D NiS/Zn3In2S6 hierarchical architecture (NiS/ZIS) was prepared by one-step hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, 0.86 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.58 g InCl3·4H2O, 0.65 g CTAB and 0.91 g CH3CSNH2 were successively dissolved in 70 ml deionized water under continuous stirring. Then, 0.014 g Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and 0.046 g CS(NH2)2 were added into the above mixed solution. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave (Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd.) and heated at 160 °C for 12 h. Finally, the precipitate was washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water for several times and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. The NiS/ZIS composite contained 1 % weight ratio of NiS was obtained. By changing the amount of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and CS(NH2)2, the NiS/Zn3In2S6 composites with 0.1 %, 0.5 %, 1 % and 5 % of NiS were synthesized, and labeled by 0.1 % NiS/ZIS, 0.5 % NiS/ZIS, 1 % NiS/ZIS, and 5 % NiS/ZIS, respectively. For comparison, the pure Zn3In2S6 (denoted as ZIS) and NiS were also prepared by the similar procedure. NiS/Zn3In2S6 composite (NiS-ZIS) was prepared by two-step hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, the as-prepared ZIS (0.62 g) was dispersed into 30 ml deionized water (denoted as suspension A). 0.014 g Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and 0.046 g CS(NH2)2 were dissolved in 30 ml deionized water (denoted as solution B). Then the suspension A is mixed with the solution B. The mixture was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 12 h. The obtained precipitate (1 % NiS-ZIS) was washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water for several times and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven."
3,Evaluation of catalytic activity,"2.2 Evaluation of catalytic activity Photocatalytic H2 evolution was performed in a cylinder-shaped Pyrex vessel connected to a gas circulation system (Labsolar-6A, Perfect Light Co., China). A 300 W Xenon lamp equipped with a 400 nm cut-off filter was used as a visible light source (PLS-SXE300D, Perfect Light Co., China). In a typical experiment, the as-prepared sample (0.1 g) was dispersed into 50 ml HMF aqueous solution (0.1 M). Before light on, the suspension was degassed with high purity nitrogen and stirred for 30 min to attain an adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, the suspension was illuminated under visible light. The produced H2 was detected by using an online gas chromatograph (GC, TianMei 7900, China). The reaction solution was analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Agilent 7890A, America) to obtain the information of the oxidized products of HMF. The details of used materials, characterization, yield and selectivity of the product, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for hydrogen evolution, the utilization rate (RU) of photogenerated electrons participated in H2 evolution to holes participated in DFF production are presented in the Supporting Information."
4,Result and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of individual ZIS, NiS, NiS-ZIS and NiS/ZIS composites. All the diffraction peaks of ZIS could be well indexed to the standard hexagonal phase of Zn3In2S6 (JCPDS No. 65-4003). Moreover, the peaks located at about 26.9°, 28.2°, 46.9°, 55.8° and 75.9° are corresponding to the diffraction of the (011), (102), (110), (1010) and (0114) crystal planes of pure ZIS, respectively. The diffraction peaks of individual NiS displays a mixture of hexagonal (JCPDS No. 02-1280) and rhombohedral (JCPDS No. 12-0041) phases. A similar phenomenon was found on other reported NiS-based composites [25,26]. Compared with ZIS and NiS, the diffraction peaks of NiS-ZIS and NiS/ZIS show in keeping with ZIS, which implies that nickel ions are only located on the surface of ZIS instead of being in ZIS lattice. No NiS diffraction peaks are detected in the XRD patterns of NiS-ZIS and NiS/ZIS composites, indicating ultra-small 2D NiS nanoflakes deposited on the surface of 2D-3D ZIS are highly dispersed or with low content. It is in line with the reported low-dimensional nanocomposite [27,56]. Additionally, the diffraction peaks of all samples are broad, which may be caused by the relatively low-dimensional structures of ZIS nanosheets and NiS nanoflakes. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared ZIS, NiS, NiS-ZIS and NiS/ZIS composites were studied by FESEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2B, pure ZIS displays regular porous microsphere-like shape with a diameter of about 0.5–1.2 μm. These microspheres are comprised of ultrathin nanosheets with smooth surface. It confirms that individual ZIS shows 3D hierarchical structure by self-assembling of 2D nanosheets, which is similar to peony flowers (the inset in Fig. 2A). The d spacing value of 0.23 nm in Fig. 2C corresponds to the (016) crystal plane of the hexagonal Zn3In2S6 (JCPDS No.65–4003). It is in line with the XRD results. The EDS survey spectrum (Fig. 2D) demonstrates that the components of ZIS are zinc (Zn), indium (In) and sulfur (S). The EDS mapping results (Fig. 2E) confirm that these three elements enrich the entire microstructure uniformly. For individual NiS, it could be observed from Fig. 2F and G that the as-prepared NiS is consisted of block-based flakiness and is of irregular nanoflake shape. The d spacing value of 0.30 nm corresponds to the (100) crystal plane of the hexagonal NiS (JCPDS No. 02-1280). Fig. 3 shows the FESEM and TEM images of NiS/ZIS composites. The morphology of 1 % NiS/ZIS is similar to that of individual ZIS. The 2D-3D hierarchical structure including 3D spherical shape and 2D layered nanosheets is quite intact when NiS and ZIS were synthesized in one-step hydrothermal process (Fig. 3A). However, it can be seen that abundant and small nanoflakes dispersed on the surface of ZIS nanosheets (Fig. 3B and C). HRTEM confirms that the small nanoflake is hexagonal NiS (Fig. 3D). The d spacing values of 0.30 nm and 0.23 nm correspond to the (100) and (016) crystal planes of the hexagonal NiS (JCPDS No. 02-1280) and the hexagonal Zn3In2S6 (JCPDS No.65–4003), respectively. Moreover, the EDS survey spectrum of 1 % NiS/ZIS (Fig. 2D) demonstrates that the components of 1 % NiS/ZIS are zinc (Zn), indium (In), sulfur (S) and nickel (Ni), and the EDS mapping results (Fig. 3E) further prove that NiS enrich the entire microstructure of ZIS. The EDS results also show that the content of NiS in 1 % NiS/ZIS is about 0.86 %. When the loaded amount of NiS is 5 % (5 % NiS/ZIS), excessive NiS covered closely on the surface of 2D-3D ZIS hierarchical structure (Fig. 3F and Fig. 3G). 2D-3D ZIS is covered with so plentiful and thick NiS nanoflakes that the role of ZIS could not be emerged, and would result in poor photocatalytic activity. To further determine the surface composition and chemical state of NiS/ZIS, XPS and high-resolution XPS techniques were performed. Firstly, the binding energies of all XPS spectra are corrected with reference to C 1s peak at 284.6 eV (Fig. 4 A). Compared to the survey spectrum of ZIS, besides Zn, In and S elements, Ni is clearly observed over 1 % NiS/ZIS (Fig. 4B). The elements C and O are found, probably resulting from the graphite conductive adhesive and the absorbed gaseous molecules [43]. For pure ZIS, the high-resolution spectra of S 2p at about 161.7 eV and 162.9 eV (Fig. 4C), In 3d at around 445.0 eV and 452.6 eV (Fig. 4D) and Zn 2p at about 1021.9 eV and 1045.0 eV (Fig. 4E) are demonstrated to be sulfide ions (S2−), indium ions (In3+) and zinc ions (Zn2+) of ZIS, respectively [42–44]. Moreover, after correcting the sensitivity factor of the elements, the atomic ratio of S, In and Zn is about 6.4:2:3.2. It is close to the theoretical stoichiometry of Zn3In2S6. Fig. 4F shows high-resolution spectrum of Ni 2p in 1 % NiS/ZIS. Clearly, there are six XPS peaks for Ni (852.7, 855.3, 860.8, 869.9, 872.7 and 879.2 eV). Binding energies at about 869.9 and 852.7 eV can be demonstrated to NiS [23,27]. The peaks at 879.2 and 860.8 eV can be assigned to its satellite peaks, while the other two peaks around 872.7 and 855.3 eV indicate the higher valence state of Ni species [23,27]. It may be caused by that NiS with prolonged air exposure could be oxidized. It is in accordance with other NiS-based composites [23,25–27]. More importantly, compared to individual ZIS, the binding energies of S 2p, In 3d and Zn 2p for NiS/ZIS are obviously shifted to high binding energy (by about 0.1 eV). The slightly positive shifts are mainly derived from the electronic interaction between NiS and ZIS. Therefore, based on the above characterizations, it can be concluded that NiS/ZIS with 2D/2D-3D hierarchical structure could be successfully prepared by the one-step hydrothermal method."
6,Evaluation of photocatalytic performance,"3.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic activities of NiS/ZIS were evaluated by photocatalytic dehydrogenation of biomass-relevant alcohol HMF into high-value-added fine chemical DFF and clear energy H2 under visible light irradiation at room temperature (eq. 1). As shown in Fig. 5 A, the production rates of DFF and H2 over individual ZIS are 3.6 and 2.9 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The selectivity of DFF is about 86.3 % due to formation of trace byproducts such as 2,5-Furandimethanol (DHMF) and 2-formyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA). The production rates of DFF and H2 increase with the increasing of NiS amount and then decrease. The optimized amount of NiS in NiS/ZIS is about 1 % (the actual content demonstrated by ICP-MS is about 0.9 %). Significantly, the production rates of DFF and H2 over 1 % NiS/ZIS are about 129 and 120 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which are about 35.8 and 41.4 times greater than that of pure ZIS. Moreover, the selectivity of DFF over 1 % NiS/ZIS could reach up to about 94.1 %. On the other hand, the control experiments exhibit that there are no DFF and H2 can be detected without photocatalyst or visible-light irradiation. These results indicate that: (1) production of DFF and evolution of H2 are triggered indeed by visible-light-driven photocatalysis; (2) the photocatalytic activities of ZIS for DFF production and H2 evolution can be enhanced simultaneously by depositing NiS as cocatalyst; (3) a cooperative interaction between NiS and ZIS is required to improve the photoredox activities optimally. To further confirm the above results and understand this dual-function photocatalytic reaction over NiS/ZIS nanocomposite, the following design experiments were carried out. Firstly, the reactive activities of 1 % NiS/ZIS for photocatalytic conversion of HMF under different incident lights were performed. As shown in Fig. 5B, the trends of DFF production and H2 evolution over 1 % NiS/ZIS match well with its optical absorption spectrum, demonstrating that the dual-function photocatalytic reaction is truly driven by a photocatalytic process. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 1 % NiS/ZIS for H2 production at 400 nm is about 1.35 %, which is about 67.5 times that of carbon nitride (g-C3N4). Secondly, to further probe into the details of the reaction process and the utilization rate of photoexcited electrons participated in H2 evolution to photogenerated holes participated in DFF production (RU), we have determined a time-online reaction profile with the irradiation time (Fig. 5C). It can be seen that the activities of 1 % NiS/ZIS in terms of yields of DFF and H2 gradually increase with reaction time. The Ru first increases fast with reaction time and then increases slow. At the beginning of the photocatalytic splitting of HMF (1 h), the amount of H2 (10.8 μmol) is lower than that of DFF (13.9 μmol). The RU is only 77.6 %. Then, RU increases fast along with the reaction time (1–3 h). At this stage, oxidation reaction may dominate the reaction. After 3 h, RU increases slowly, implying that the photoredox process is approaching to equilibrium. At this moment, HMF is dehydrogenated into DFF and H+ by consuming of photoinduced holes, and simultaneously protons are evolved into H2 by depleting of photoinduced electrons. At 4 h, RU could reach up to about 93.0 %, suggesting a stoichiometric dual-function photocatalytic reaction would be achieved by extending reaction time. Thirdly, both NiS and oxidative products of Ni (such as Ni2O3 and NiO) can be used as cocatalysts and can enhance the photocatalytic activity of the primary photocatalysts [23–27,57]. To further investigate the role of nickel oxide, NiO/ZIS and Ni2O3/ZIS are both synthesized by the previous report [57]. Their H2-evolution activities are presented in Fig. S1. It can be observed that the activity sequence is as follows: NiO/ZIS > Ni2O3/ZIS > ZIS. It is in line with the previous report [57], in which the order of H2-evolution rate is NiO/CdS > Ni2O3/CdS > CdS. However, compared to NiS/ZIS, the photocatalytic activity of NiS/ZIS is far greater than of NiO/ZIS and Ni2O3/ZIS. These results indicate that the enhanced reactivity of ZIS should be owing to the presence of NiS. Fourthly, NiS as an efficient cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2-evolution has been reported previously [23–27,55], and NiS-based composite photocatalysts were generally prepared by two-step method [23–25,27,55]. 2D NiS nanosheets loaded on the surface of 2D-3D ZIS spherical shape (NiS-ZIS) was prepared by two-step hydrothermal method. On the above XRD analysis, it is known that the diffraction peaks of NiS-ZIS with content of 1 % and 5 % NiS are in accordance with that of ZIS and NiS/ZIS. However, microstructures of NiS-ZIS are different from that of NiS/ZIS. As shown in Figs. S2 and S3, it can be clearly observed that, on 1 % NiS-ZIS, the surface of the ZIS spherical structure is covered by big NiS nanosheets unevenly. When the content of NiS increased to 5 %, the surface of ZIS is thoroughly covered by large and excessive amounts of NiS nanosheets (Fig. S4). Obviously, the intimate contact between NiS and ZIS is seriously diminished by the two-step hydrothermal method. From Fig. 5D, it can be seen that 1 % NiS-ZIS exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than ZIS but much less than 1 % NiS/ZIS. It confirms that NiS is indeed an efficient cocatalyst toward enhance photocatalytic activity of ZIS, and to maximize photocatalytic performance, optimize the interfaces between cocatalyst and photocatalyst is highly necessary. Additionally, the photocatalytic activities of other composites consisted of NiS or Ni2P have also been measured and presented in Fig. S5. It can be found that, compared with individual photocatalysts (g-C3N4 (CN), commercial CdS (CdS-C) and Zn3In2S6 (ZIS)), the photocatalytic activities of 1 % NiS/g-C3N4 (NiS/CN), 1 % NiS/CdS-C and 1 % Ni2P/Zn3In2S6 (Ni2P/ZIS) composites are all significantly enhanced under visible light irradiation. It indicates that NiS and Ni2P are both efficiently cocatalysts for photocatalytic selective transformation of HMF. Notably, 1 % NiS/ZIS composite exhibits the highest photocatalytic activities among these composites, indicating the potential application of noble metal-free NiS/ZIS photocatalyst. On the other hand, in the photocatalytic H2-evolution, noble metal Pt was considered as the most effective cocatalyst because of its high work function and unique physicochemical properties [56,58,59]. However, due to its scarcity and high price, developing noble metal-free and highly efficient cocatalysts has been demonstrated to be imperative [27–31]. Therefore, to better evaluate the photocatalytic activity of NiS/ZIS, 1 % Pt/ZIS has also been prepared. As shown in Fig. 5D, compared to pristine ZIS, 1 % Pt/ZIS shows significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. However, it is still lower than the activity of 1 % NiS/ZIS. The above results further indicate that NiS is an efficient co-catalyst, and noble metal-free NiS/ZIS is a highly efficient photocatalyst for visible-light-driven photocatalytic dehydrogenation of biomass-relevant alcohols into H2 and fine chemicals in one reaction system under mild reaction conditions. For a catalytic reaction, besides highly efficient activity and low input-output ratio, reusability is another important consideration [15,31]. To evaluate reactive stability of NiS/ZIS, the cycle experiments of 1 % NiS/ZIS for photocatalytic conversion of HMF were carried out. As shown in Fig. 6 , the photocatalytic activity of 1 % NiS/ZIS exhibits no noticeable attenuation after reaction for 18 h. However, the photocatalytic activity of individual ZIS shows obvious decay due to the known photocorrosion of metal sulfides. It indicates that photocorrosion of ZIS could be suppressed by cocatalyst NiS. The photostability of NiS/ZIS composite could attribute to effective separation of photoexcited electrons and holes in ZIS by NiS. Obviously, NiS can significantly improve kinetics of the dual-function photocatalytic reaction. In addition, to investigate the contribution of H2 production, pure water splitting into H2 over 1 % NiS/ZIS has been carried out. As shown in Fig. S6, the H2 evolution rate over pure water is about 0.11 μmol g−1 h-1, which is far less than that over HMF aqueous solution (120 μmol g−1 h-1). It indicates that H2 mainly come from HMF in this dual-function reaction system. Obviously, 1 % NiS/ZIS exhibits remarkably enhanced photoactivity in HMF water solution. The H2 evolution rate in HMF water solution is 1090.9 times that in pure water. This is because the evolution of H2 is favored by addition of HMF. That is to say, Gibbs free energy of the reaction can be reduced by introduction of HMF (reaction thermodynamics and kinetics will be discussed below). Notably, the as-prepared NiS/ZIS composite also shows highly photocatalytic activity for photocatalytic splitting of aromatic alcohols (benzyl alcohol (C6H5CH2OH), p-tolylmethanol (MeC6H4CH2OH), p-methoxybenzyl alcohol (MeOC6H4CH2OH), p-chlorobenzyl alcohol (ClC6H4CH2OH)) and furfuryl alcohol (C4H3OCH2OH) to produce H2 and corresponding aldehydes (Figs. S7 and S8). It indicates that this reaction can work on wide substrate scope. It is similar with the previous reports that hole-scavengers, formic acid and benzyl alcohol could improve the reaction thermodynamics and enhance photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution tremendously [32,33,38]. However, there are distinctive differences in these photocatalytic reaction systems. For example, the use of hole-scavengers and formic acid undesirably wastes the energy of holes, increases the system cost and brings along some pollutants such as CO2 [32,33]. Although benzyl alcohol can be photocatalytic transformed into benzaldehyde and H2, benzyl alcohol is environmentally unfriendly, and the price of the product (benzaldehyde) is close to the reactant [60,61]. In the dual-function photocatalytic reaction, photoexcited electrons and holes can be directly utilized for synthesizing renewable energy (H2) and high-value-added fine chemicals (DFF) with carbon neutral. Thus, it can be concluded that the efficiently dual-function photocatalytic reaction system toward selective oxidation of biomass-relevant alcohols into high-value-added fine chemicals and clean energy (H2) along with carbon neutral under mild conditions can be realized on the as-synthesized noble metal-free NiS/ZIS photocatalyst."
7,Mechanism,"3.3 Mechanism It is known that a reaction is determined by thermodynamics and kinetics [15]. Whether a chemical reaction occurs or not depends on thermodynamics, while the rate of the chemical reaction depends on kinetics. So do the photocatalytic redox reactions. During the photocatalysis, light absorption and photo-excitation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) take place when the energy of the induced light matches or exceeds the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst. The photoexcited electrons on the conduction band (CB) have reductive ability, while the photoexcited holes on the valence band (VB) possess oxidizing ability [15]. To drive the photocatalytic redox reactions, the redox potentials of the reactions should match the positions of CB and VB (the redox potentials of photoexcited electrons and holes) [15,38,40,43]. To inspect the thermodynamics feasibility of the photocatalytic reaction system, the energy band structures of the photocatalyst and redox capacity of the goal reaction are studied (Fig. 7 ). As shown in Fig. 7A, the VB potential of ZIS is demonstrated to be about 1.83 eV by valence-band XPS method. The optical band-gap energy (Eg) of ZIS is calculated to be about 2.80 eV from Kubelka-Munk function (Fig. 7B) [38]. Therefore, the semiconductor ZIS can be excited by visible light and the CB potential of ZIS is about -0.97 eV. Moreover, Mott-Schottky plots of 1 % NiS/ZIS are almost identical to that of ZIS (Fig. S9), suggesting that CB and VB levels of ZIS have no obvious change after deposition of NiS. From the cyclic voltammogram of HMF (Fig. 7C), it can be seen that the potential of HMF to DFF is about 1.61 V, and the potential of DFF to oxidized DFF is about 2.03 V. Clearly, the VB of ZIS is more positive than the oxidative potential of HMF/DFF, but negative than the oxidative potential of DFF/oxidized DFF (Fig.7D). It means that the holes photoexcited on the VB of ZIS can oxidize HMF into DFF, but cannot further oxidize DFF. On the other hand, the CB of ZIS is more negative than the reductive potential of H2 evolution. These are important to this dual-function reaction system, which not only verifies the oxidation reaction and reduction reaction are spontaneous (HMF +2 h+ (ZISVB) → DFF + 2H+, ΔGo = -42.46 kJ mol−1; 2H+ + 2e- (ZISCB) → H2, ΔGo = -187.21 kJ mol−1), but also ensures the high selectivity of DFF. It is known that, during the photocatalysis, the reaction rate would be influenced by many factors such as crystalline phase, morphology, surface area, light absorption, charge separation and transportation, etc. Furthermore, the charge separation and transportation has been demonstrated to be the most crucial factor [38,43]. Herein, after deposition of NiS on ZIS, the crystalline phase and morphology of ZIS have no change. Although the specific surface area of 1 % NiS/ZIS (9.8 m2 g−1) is higher than that of individual ZIS (8.1 m2 g−1, Fig. S10), the slightly raised surface area is clearly not proportional to the enhanced photoactivity. From the UV–vis DRS spectra (Fig. 7B), it can be observed that, compared with the absorption spectrum of individual ZIS, NiS/ZIS hybrid exhibits a bit stronger visible-light absorption and a close band-gap energy. It implies that the light absorption could not be the main factor for the enhanced photoactivity. To further investigate the reason for the enhanced photoactivity of NiS/ZIS, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) techniques were carried out to study the charge separation and transportation [27,38–44,62–67]. As shown in Fig. 8 A, 1 % NiS/ZIS exhibits as much 3.9 times higher photocurrent as pure ZIS. The photocurrent is generated by diffusion electrons from the separation of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs [27,38,62,63]. It implies that the loading of NiS has contributed to improving separation and transportation of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs. This can be further confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is widely used to detect separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and transfer resistance across the electrode-electrolyte interfaces [40–43]. As shown in Fig. 8B, 1 % NiS/ZIS shows a smaller arc radius than ZIS. The charge transfer resistances of 1 % NiS/ZIS and ZIS are demonstrated to be about 151 Ω and 195 Ω, respectively. It indicates that efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers and fast transportation of interfacial charge carriers have been happened on NiS/ZIS. The rapid charge transfer over NiS/ZIS has been further confirmed by TRPL (Fig. 8C) [38,66]. Clearly, 1 % NiS/ZIS exhibits longer lifetime (5.21 ns) than ZIS (3.38 ns). On the above analysis, it can be concluded that the separation and transportation of photoexcited charge on ZIS can be promoted by the introduction of NiS. The photoelectrochemical and TRPL tests together strongly demonstrate that NiS can effectively promote the separation and transfer of the photogenerated charges and eventually result in the higher photocatalytic activity of NiS/ZIS than that of ZIS toward simultaneous DFF production and H2 evolution in one reaction system under visible light irradiation. To understand the process of photocatalytic dehydrogenation of HMF over the NiS/ZIS composite, a radical trapping experiment was performed. As shown in Fig. 9 , no EPR signals were detected on the blank tests (performed in the dark or under visible light irradiation without photocatalyst). However, six EPR signals assigned to characteristic peaks of carbon-centered radicals are clearly observed when the reaction system with addition of ZIS or 1 % NiS/ZIS composite under visible light irradiation. It reveals that the carbon-centered radicals are truly triggered by visible-light-driven photocatalysis and are intermediates in the process of photocatalytic transformation of HMF. Moreover, the intensity of the EPR signal over 1 % NiS/ZIS is obviously stronger than that over ZIS, indicating that much more carbon-centered radicals are formed after deposition of NiS on ZIS. This also proves that NiS can effectively promote separation and transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers. It is in line with the above results of photocatalytic activity and PEC test. Fig. 10 shows the mechanism of the enhanced charge separation and transfer over NiS/ZIS. Especially, NiS possesses metallic property with high conductivity and low over-potential of hydrogen evolution as like noble metal Pt [27,52]. Specifically, the work function of NiS (5.5 eV) is so closed to that of Pt (5.65 eV) that could enhance photoelectric conversion efficiency and photocatalytic H2-evolution [52–55]. For example, NiS showed high DSSCs conversion efficiency of 7.33 %, which was comparable to Pt cathode (7.53 %) [52]. Herein, NiS exhibits larger work function (5.5 eV) than ZIS (3.6 eV) (Fig. 10A) [38,52]. When ZIS and NiS are in close contact, barrier layer (also called barrier region) will be built in their contacted interfaces (orange rectangle in Fig. 10B). Consequently, the photoexcited electrons in ZIS with a lower work function spontaneously transfer to NiS with a higher work function across their interfaces (Fig. 10C). In addition, the formed barrier height (1.9 eV) much larger than kBT (0.3 eV, kB and T are Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively), the barrier region can be approximately depletion layer based on rectification theory of semiconductor contact [68,69]. Thus, positive space-charge region can be formed on the interfaces. It will contribute to separation and transfer of photoexcited charges. The holes on the ZIS would be captured by HMF to give DFF and release H+, while the separated electrons would be reacted with H+ on the NiS surface to produce H2 rapidly due to low hydrogen over-potential of NiS. Consequently, a cycle and efficient reaction system toward solar-to-chemical energy conversion of biomass-relevant substrates was run. On the basis of the above results and analysis, possible mechanisms for photocatalytic selective transformation of HMF over NiS/ZIS composite with simultaneous DFF production and H2 evolution under visible light irradiation was proposed, as follows: The primary catalyst ZIS is photoexcited by visible light, resulting in photoexcited electrons on the CB of ZIS and equal numbers of photoexcited holes on the VB of ZIS. The electrons are rapidly transferred from the CB of ZIS to the cocatalyst NiS, leaving the holes in the VB of ZIS. The photoexcited electrons and holes are spatially separated. For the reactant HMF molecule, it is firstly deprotonated to form an alkoxide anion and to release one H+ ion. Then the alkoxide anion reacts with a photoexcited hole to generate one corresponding carbon radical and to give one H+ ion. The formed carbon radical further reacts with one photoexcited hole to produce a DFF molecule. Simultaneously, two H+ ions, deprotonated from HMF, react with two electrons accumulated on the NiS to produce a H2 molecule. In this cooperative and dual-purpose reaction, the selective oxidation reaction consumes one HMF molecule and two holes, and produces one DFF molecule and two protons; the reduction process depletes two electrons and two protons, and produces one H2 molecule. These two spatially isolated reactions could promote charge generation-separation-transportation and consume photoexcited charges to produce high-value-added fine chemicals (e.g., DFF) and renewable energy (H2). Thus, the dual-function photocatalytic reaction system with efficient and green recycling could be established under mild reaction conditions."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, 3D microsphere ZIS assembled by 2D ZIS nanosheets decorated with 2D NiS ultrasmall nanoflakes can be prepared by one-step method, and can be used as an efficient, dual-functional and visible-light-driven photocatalyst toward selective conversion of biomass-relevant alcohols into clean energy (H2) and high-value-added fine chemicals (aldehydes) in one reaction system under mild reaction conditions. This dual-function reaction system not only can enhance reaction kinetics but also can improve thermodynamics of traditional water splitting. The rates of H2 evolution and DFF production for 1 % NiS/ZIS can reach up to 120 and 129 μmol g−1 h−1, around 41.4 and 35.8 times higher than that of pure ZIS, respectively. The DFF selectivity over 1 % NiS/ZIS could be achieved 94.1 %. Moreover, the photocatalytic H2-evolution rate of 1 % NiS/ZIS is about 3.9, 4.6 and 1090.9 times higher than those of 1 % Pt/ZIS, 1 % NiS-ZIS (prepared by the traditional two-step method) and 1 % NiS/ZIS for water splitting, respectively. The PEC and TRPL tests together with theoretical calculation strongly demonstrate that NiS as a cocatalyst can effectively promote the separation and transportation of photoexcited charges. The holes on the ZIS would be captured by HMF to give DFF and release H+, while the separated electrons would be reacted with H+ on the NiS surface to produce H2. Thus, a cycle and efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion of biomass-relevant substrates reaction system was run prosperously. This study not only provides a promising approach to design novel, noble metal-free and efficient visible-light-driven composite photocatalyst, but also supplies a dual-functional, economic, cooperative and sustainable way for utilization of solar energy (photoexcited electrons and holes) to synthesize fine chemicals and H2 under mild reaction conditions."
