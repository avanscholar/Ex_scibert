0,Introduction,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and presents an increasing incidence rate [1–4]. However, surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy only treat the tumors to some extent with many side effects, and the long-term survival rate of HCC patients is still low [5,6]. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop novel methods to overcome the limitations. Recently, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has been widely studied due to its responsiveness to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and is regarded as an alternative to traditional chemotherapy [7–9]. CDT is based on the advanced Fenton reaction or Fenton-like reaction, which uses the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that overexpressed by a tumor and exogenetic Fe(II) ions for the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH) [10,11]. The •OH, one of the most active reactive oxygen species (ROS), can efficiently induce cancer cell death by damaging deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with no repairment [12]. More importantly, the TME-responsive treatment can shrink the scope of toxicity and fix on lesions, as a result of reduced impairment efficiency to normal cells and enhanced therapeutic efficiency to cancer cells [13]. For a better tumor therapy, amounts of Fe-containing nanoparticles have been investigated in the CDT-based anticancer treatment [14,15]. However, insufficient concentrations of H2O2 in the TME have limited efficiency of •OH production, and an efficient Fenton catalytic system is necessary for further application [16,17]. Two-dimensional (2D) layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is extensively used as a catalyst due to its low indirect band-gap (1.2–1.8 eV) [18–20], and it has been used as a co-catalyst for the Fenton reaction to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) through the redox properties of Mo(IV) [21–23]. The acid environment of cancer cells could also accelerate the MoS2/Fe reaction cycle [24–26]. During the co-catalyst reactions, (i) the Mo(IV) exposed at the cross section is oxidized to Mo(VI), while S-Mo-S is destroyed, and Mo(VI) is released from the nanostructure. (ii) The inner Mo(IV) of nanostructure is exposed on the surface and provides active sites for further reaction cycles. (iii) Unsaturated sulfur atoms also detach from the surface of MoS2 and combine with protons to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) [25]. Meanwhile, the H2S, defined as gas-transmitter, is one of the most biologically relevant gas molecules. It has been confirmed to show great anti-tumor effect with selective cytotoxicity to cancer cells [27–29]. Up to now, many sulfide salts (Na2S and NaSH) and H2S donors/compounds have been developed for exogenous H2S-based cancer treatment [30–32]. Hereby, we hypothesize that the combination of MoS2/Fe can produce H2S in cancer cells and show therapeutic effect. Notably, the MoS2 can be degraded in the presence of Fe(III) to improve the elimination of MoS2/Fe-based nanostructures from healthy organs. In this study, gallic acid (GA), a reported Fe(III) ion chelating agent, was modified onto the surface of MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2@GA) [33,34]. In addition, the GA could promote the Fenton catalytic activity of GA-Fe(II) when the ratio of GA and Fe was smaller than 2:1 [11,35,36]. Afterwards, the Fe(III) was fastened on the surface of MoS2@GA by a chelating reaction. A MoS2@GA-Fe-based “Fenton Nanoreactor” was prepared, which has two Fenton reactions (Scheme 1 ): i) an enhanced GA-Fe(II)/GA-Fe(III)-based Fenton reaction and ii) a MoS2/Fe combined reduction. Importantly, the prepared MoS2@GA-Fe has a dual-model imaging ability because of the fact that MoS2 has a good photoacoustic (PA) imaging effect, and Fe(III) can provide the nano-composite with a magnetic resonance (MR) contrast property [37–39]. The MoS2@GA-Fe can accumulate in a tumor area due to its enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [40,41]. The imaging-guided “Fenton Nanoreactor” strategy could effectively eliminate tumors, and its degradation in normal tissues reduces its long-term toxicity in vivo."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Commercial MoS2 powder, Fe(III) chloride anhydrous (FeCl3), 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), and GA were obtained from Aladdin (China). 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were purchased from Hyclone (USA). 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) was obtained from Beyotime Biotechnology (China). Other chemicals materials and detection assays were obtained from Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd."
3,Preparation of MoS2@GA,"2.2 Preparation of MoS2@GA Firstly, MoS2 powder (75 mg) was added into 10 mL NMP and sonicated at 285 W for 90 min [42]. Then, the solution was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant solution was collected. After further centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 60 min, the precipitate was collected and washed with ethyl alcohol. The obtained MoS2 nanosheet was re-dispersed in ultrapure water. Afterward, GA was added to the MoS2 solution (MoS2: GA mass ratio is 1:1) and stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. The MoS2@GA was collected using centrifugation to remove free GA. Finally, the MoS2@GA solution (1 mg/mL) was stored at 4 °C for further use, regarding as the solution A. Meanwhile, the FeCl3 (1 mg/mL) was dispersed in ultrapure water and stored at 4 °C for further use, regarding as the solution B. The MoS2@GA-Fe nanocomposite was obtained by a simply procedure, in which the solution A and solution B was mixed at an equivalent volume, and stirred at 60 °C for 6 h. The MoS2@GA-Fe was then collected using the centrifugation, and re-dispersed in ultrapure water. The morphology and structure of MoS2@GA and MoS2@GA@Fe were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The dynamic light scattering (DLS) and surface zeta-potential of MoS2@GA@Fe were studied using a Nano Particle analyzer (SZ-100, Horiba Scientific). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorbance spectra were recorded using a microplate reader (Thermo). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer."
4,In vitro detection of •OH and H2S generation,"2.3 In vitro detection of •OH and H2S generation The in vitro •OH production was detected using Rhoda nanocomposite B (RhB). To study the Fenton reaction of MoS2@GA-Fe in cancer cells, the simulated TME was designed. Firstly, the MoS2@GA-Fe and GSH (1 mM, pH 6.0) was mixed and reacted for 2 h. Then, the RhB/H2O2 solution (RhB, 10 μM; H2O2, 100 μM) were added to the mixture, and the absorption values at 557 nm were measured after different reaction times. And, the •OH production of MoS2 in TME, FeCl3 in TME, and MoS2@GA-Fe in TME (without GSH) were investigated as control. During the Fenton reaction of MoS2@GA-Fe in TME, the H2S was produced and detected using the H2S detection assay. Briefly, the MoS2@GA-Fe was mixed in PBS (pH 6.0) containing GSH (1 mM) and H2O2 (100 μM). After reacted for 2 h, the nanocomposite was removed using the ultrafiltration centrifugation (1 Kd), and the H2S was then detected. In addition, the H2S production of MoS2@GA-Fe in PBS (pH 7.4) and PBS (pH 6.0) were investigated as control."
5,In vitro cell uptake,"2.4 In vitro cell uptake Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and normal hepatocytes (LO2) cells were selected for in vitro cell studies. The HepG2 cells were seeded into 6-well microplates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well, and cultured for 12 h. The MoS2@GA-Fe was added in the cell at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, and the cells were further incubated for different times. After washed with PBS, the cells were collected for the PA signal study. Meanwhile, the MoS2@GA-Fe was added in the HepG2 cells at concentrations of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 μg/mL. After incubated for another 12 h, the cells were washed with PBS and investigated with Prussian blue iron staining. In addition, the cellular TEM images were studied. The HepG2 cells were incubated with MoS2@GA-Fe for 3 h, and the new culture media was added to replace the MoS2@GA-Fe media. Then, the cells were further incubated for different times and collected for cellular TEM studies."
6,In vitro cytotoxicity study,"2.5 In vitro cytotoxicity study To study the co-catalytic effect of MoS2@GA and Fe(III) in cancer cells, HepG2 cells were seeded into 96-well microplates (1 × 104 cells/well) and cultured for 12 h. The MoS2@GA with different concentrations were firstly incubated with the HepG2 cells for 3 h. After the free MoS2@GA wipe off, the FeCl3 was added to the plates and incubated for 12 h. Finally, the cell viability was detected through MTT assay. For the in vitro cytotoxicity study of our prepared nano-materials, both LO2 and HepG2 cells were seeded into 96-well microplates (1 × 104 cells/well) and cultured for 12 h. The MoS2, MoS2@GA, and MoS2@GA-Fe were then added to the microplates and further cultured for 24 h. Finally, the cell viability was detected using MTT assay. The intracellular ROS production treated with MoS2@GA, or MoS2@GA-Fe were detected using DCFH-DA. Firstly, the LO2 and HepG2 cells were incubated with MoS2@GA, or MoS2@GA-Fe for 24 h. Secondly, the DCFH-DA was added into the plates and incubated for 0.5 h. Finally, the cells were observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Meanwhile, H2S production after treated with MoS2@GA, or MoS2@GA-Fe were also studied using the H2S fluorescence determination kits."
7,In vivo biodistribution,"2.6 In vivo biodistribution All mice experiments were performed under the protocol of the Animal Care and Use Committee (CC/ACUCC) of Xiamen University, China. The mice used in this study were Balb/c nude mice (female, 20 ± 2 g), and supplied by Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. For the establishment of Xenografted tumor models, the HepG2 cells (100 μL, 1 × 107/mL) were subcutaneous inoculated at the right back of mice. When the tumor volume reached ~ 100 mm3, the in vivo biodistribution of MoS2@GA-Fe was studied. The MoS2@GA-Fe (MoS2, 3 mg/kg) was injected into the mice intravenously. The PA imaging of tumor sites were recorded using the Vevo 3100 (Visual Sonics Fuji Film) at 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, and 24 h time points. Meanwhile, the MRI were also recorded using an MR imaging scan (9.4 T). After the mice were sacrificed at 24 h post-injection, the main organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) and tumors were harvested. The inductively coupled plasma atomic mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied to detect the amount of Mo in major organs and tumors. Also, the tissue TEM study of tumor was investigated."
8,In vivo tumor growth inhibition,"2.7 In vivo tumor growth inhibition When the tumors volume reached about ~100 mm3, the mice were intravenous injected with PBS, MoS2, MoS2@GA, and MoS2@GA-Fe (MoS2, 3 mg/kg) at 0, 2, and 4 days. The tumor sizes and mouse body weights were recorded every 2 days. The tumor volume was calculated using the standard formula: tumor volume (V) = length × width2 × 0.5. At 14 days after the first treatment, all the mice were sacrificed, and their main organs and tumors were harvested for the hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining."
9,The biocompatibility assessment of MoS2@GA-Fe,"2.8 The biocompatibility assessment of MoS2@GA-Fe Firstly, the hematolysis assay of MoS2@GA-Fe was investigated. The red blood cells (RBCs) were collected from healthy BALB/c mice and made into corresponding RBC stock solution for future use. Then, the MoS2@GA-Fe (800, 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 µg/mL) was added into RBC stock solution. Besides, the ultrapure water and saline solution (0.9% NaCl) were added to the RBCs, and regarded as positive and negative controls, respectively. After all the samples incubated for 2 h (37 °C), the suspension solutions were centrifuged for 10 min (5000 rpm). Furthermore, PBS and MoS2@GA-Fe (3 mg/kg) were intravenous injected into healthy BALB/c mice at 0, 2, and 4 days. At 14 days after the first injection, the whole blood and serum were collected. The collected samples were applied to the hematological and biochemical analysis. These parameters were as followed: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), red blood cells (RBC), blood platelet (PLT), white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), creatinine (CREA), UREA."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Characterization of MoS2@GA-Fe,"3.1 Characterization of MoS2@GA-Fe MoS2 nanosheets were ultrasonically exfoliated from bulk MoS2 with the addition of NMP. The GA was then modified onto the surface of MoS2 nanosheets via strong π–π stacking between MoS2 and the aromatic groups of GA (Fig. 1 A). The obtained MoS2@GA had a nanosheet structure with an average size of 101 nm (Fig. 1B). The MoS2@GA was investigated with XPS (Fig. S1). The Mo2p peaks at 232.5 and 229.3 eV corresponded to Mo 2p3/2 and Mo 2p5/2. The XPS spectrum of S2p had two peaks at 163.4 and 162.2 eV, and the spectrum of S2s had one peak at 226.5 eV. The XPS spectrum of C 1 s showed three peaks. The peak at 248.8 eV corresponded to the sp3-hybridized C, and the one at 286.1 eV corresponded to the benzene ring. The O 1 s spectrum displayed two peaks: one at 532.6 and one at 531.3 eV. The MoS2@GA-Fe was prepared by a chelation reaction between the GA of MoS2@GA and Fe(III) (Fig. 1A), and the brown solution turned to light brown after the reaction (Fig. S2). The Fe(III) and Mo atoms of MoS2@GA-Fe were detected using ICP-MS assays, and the GA was confirmed by the Folin phenol assay. The MoS2: GA: Fe(III) mass ratio was 1: 0.59: 0.47 (Fig. S3). The prepared MoS2@GA-Fe also presented the nanosheet structure but with a shuttle shape (Fig. 1C). This could be the result of the MoS2/Fe redox reactions at high temperature and the weak edges of MoS2@GA decomposing. The size of the MoS2@GA-Fe was slightly decreased, and the electronegative MoS2@GA become positive after the reaction (Fig. 1D). The XPS spectra of MoS2@GA-Fe were also investigated (Fig. 1E). The spectrum of Mo2p had two peaks at 232.6 and 229.5 eV, that of S2s had one peak at 226.6 eV, and that of S2p had two peaks at 163.5 and 162.4 eV. The Mo2p and S2p peaks slightly shifted, which might be the result of the MoS2/Fe redox reaction. The XPS peak of –COO shifted to 288.7 eV, and the two XPS peaks of Os1 shifted to 533.0 and 531.9 eV, respectively. The Fe2p spectrum showed two peaks at 725.0 and 711.6 eV corresponding to Fe2p1/2 and Fe2p3/2, respectively. Thus, these studies confirmed the interaction between the –COO of MoS2@GA and Fe(III). The UV–vis absorption of MoS2@GA and MoS2@GA-Fe was then investigated. As shown in Fig. 1F, the MoS2@GA-Fe maintained the visible absorption peaks of MoS2@GA with slight blue-shift. The PA property of MoS2@GA-Fe was also studied, [37] and the PA intensity was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1G). Fe(III) was reported to show T 1-weighted MR contrast performance. [12] Therefore, we also verified this aspect of MoS2@GA-Fe using a 9.4-T MR clinical scanner (Fig. 1H), and the r 1 of MoS2@GA-Fe was calculated to be 2.76 mM−1 s−1."
12,TME-responsive property of MoS2@GA-Fe,"3.2 TME-responsive property of MoS2@GA-Fe The TME-responsive reactions of MoS2@GA-Fe were studied in a simulated TME solution (GSH/H2O2, pH 6.0), and an illustration is shown in Fig. 2 A. The MoS2@GA-Fe was degraded in the simulated TME solution, and the nanosheet structure gradually degraded into smaller fragments over time (Fig. 2B-D). The sizes of the nanocomposites became 77.2, 62.4, and 55.0 nm after reactions for 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 2F). The TME-responsive degradation could help the MoS2@GA-Fe fragments perform CDT treatment. When the MoS2@GA-Fe was dispersed in PBS (pH 7.4), it also showed slight degradation due to the weak self-reaction of MoS2/Fe for 24 h (Fig. 2E), and the size showed an obvious decrease after reacted for several days (Fig. S3). These fancy reactions could help the elimination of MoS2@GA-Fe in healthy tissues to ensure high efficiency and low toxicity. The •OH and H2S production of MoS2@GA-Fe was also evaluated in the simulated TME. Firstly, the •OH production was investigated by an RhB degradation assay. As shown in Fig. 2G, the Fe(III) in the simulated TME solution showed •OH production. The result was consistent with previous Fe(III)-based Fenton reaction strategies, in which Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by GSH, and then Fe(II) induces the Fenton reaction in H2O2 (pH 6.0) solution. [12] When the MoS2@GA-Fe was dispersed in H2O2 (pH 6.0), it showed significant •OH production without the addition of GSH. This confirms that Mo(IV) can reduce the Fe(III) to Fe(II) in weak acid conditions and induce the Fenton reaction. Finally, when the MoS2@GA-Fe was dispersed in simulated TME solution, it obtained the highest •OH production. The enhanced “Fenton Nanoreactor” in the simulated TME is based on four factors: (i) the Fenton reaction induced by the Fe(III)/GSH-H2O2 reaction cycle and the addition of GA can help the prooxidative reaction. [35] (ii) The exposed Mo(IV) from MoS2 can reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) and form another Fenton reaction cycle. [24] (iii) The MoS2 is then degraded into fragments, more Mo(IV) sites are exposed on its surface, and the reaction is accelerated over time. (iv) Lastly, the GA-Fe(III) is released into the solution after the degradation, and free GA-Fe(III) can attach to the edge of MoS2 due to electrical adsorption. Thus, the reaction showed a “snowball effect” and accelerated the •OH production. The S-Mo-S bonds were destroyed, and unsaturated S atoms were also exposed on the fracture surface of MoS2 during these reactions. They then bond with H+ in weak acid conditions, producing the toxic H2S (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2H, the MoS2@GA-Fe produced no H2S in PBS (pH 7.4), but it did produce some amount of H2S in PBS (pH 6.0). When the MoS2@GA-Fe was dispersed in the simulated TME solution, the H2S production was higher than in PBS (pH 6.0) due to the reproduced GA-Fe(III) after the Fenton reaction. Therefore, H2S synergizing with •OH could kill tumors effectively and permanently. Overall, these properties suggest that MoS2@GA-Fe could be applied in imaging-guided treatments combining CDT and H2S."
13,In vitro cell study of MoS2@GA-Fe,"3.3 In vitro cell study of MoS2@GA-Fe The human hepatoma HepG2 cells were chosen for the in vitro cell study of our combined strategy, and the human normal liver LO2 cells were used as control. Firstly, MoS2@GA-Fe was incubated with HepG2 cells for different times, and then the cells were collected for further PA investigation. As shown in Fig. 3 A and B, the cells’ PA intensity increased early at 9 h and decreased after that. This could be attributed to the competition between the intracellular accumulation and degradation of MoS2@GA-Fe. Next, cellular uptake was studied by the Perls stain assay according to the specific reaction between Prussian blue and the Fe atoms of MoS2@GA-Fe(III). As shown in Fig. 3C, the Fe content in HepG2 cells increased with time and with the increase in MoS2@GA-Fe(III) concentrations. To confirm the in vitro cell degradation property of MoS2@GA-Fe(III), HepG2 cells were incubated with MoS2@GA-Fe for 3 h and then washed with PBS. The cells were then further incubated for different times for cellular TEM studies (Fig. 3D). After treated for 6 h, the nanocomposite was dispersed in the lysosome. In addition, most of the nanocomposite maintained its large structure, and many small nanostructures were also found, which should be the degraded fragments of MoS2@GA-Fe. With the extension of the incubation time, the nanocomposite gradually broke down into smaller fragments. The degraded fragments could then be released into the cytoplasm, which is beneficial for the combination treatment. To confirm the combination treatment of MoS2@GA and Fe(III), the MoS2@GA was pre-incubated with HepG2 cells, and then FeCl3 was incubated. As shown in Fig. 3E, with the increase of MoS2@GA concentrations, the toxicity effect of Fe(III) was enhanced. When the MoS2@GA concentration was 50 μg/mL, the combination treatment’s efficiency was about four times than that of the pure Fe(III)-based Fenton reaction. When MoS2 or MoS2@GA was incubated with HepG2 cells, it showed a negligible cytotoxicity, whereas when treated with MoS2@GA-Fe, the obvious cytotoxicity was observed in comparison to other groups (Fig. 3F). The cytotoxicity of MoS2@GA-Fe was also studied using normal LO2 hepatocytes and exhibited no obvious cytotoxicity (Fig. S5), indicating that it is safe for normal cells at the concentration examined in this study. In vitro cell imaging of •OH and H2S was next performed. Compared with MoS2@GA-treated HepG2 cells, the MoS2@GA-Fe treated group showed an obvious •OH signal, confirming the CDT effect on cancer cells (Fig. 3G). In addition, the H2S production of MoS2@GA-Fe-treated HepG2 cells was significantly higher than that of the MoS2@GA-treated group (Fig. 3H). In contrast, the MoS2@GA-Fe-treated LO2 cells showed no obvious •OH and H2S generation. Combined with the in vitro study on the MoS2@GA-Fe dispersed in TME simulated solution, the results showed that MoS2@GA-Fe leads to outstanding •OH and H2S production in cancer cells and presents potential for cancer treatment in vivo."
14,In vivo cancer treatments,"3.4 In vivo cancer treatments To study the cancer treatments in vivo, HepG2 cells were inoculated into BALB/c nude mice to establish a tumor-bearing mouse model. The MoS2@GA-Fe was intravenously injected into the mice, and PA imaging was done at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h post-injection. As shown in Fig. 4 A and B, the PA signal of the tumor area was enhanced after the administration of MoS2@GA-Fe, reached a maximum value at 9 h, and was maintained for 24 h. The high accumulation of MoS2@GA-Fe benefited from its unique structure-based EPR effect. T 1-weighted MR imaging was also done after the injection of MoS2@GA-Fe (Fig. 4C and D). The Fe(III)-based MR intensity increased in the early time points and decreased from 9 to 24 h. The mice were sacrificed at 9 h post-injection, and the tumor and main organs were harvested for ICP-MS analysis of Mo. As shown in Fig. 4E, the relative Mo content of the tumor was higher than that of the main organs, indicating preferential tumor accumulation of the MoS2@GA-Fe. The harvested tumor tissue was also analyzed by TEM images and the results showed the enrichment of MoS2@GA-Fe nanostructure in the tumor tissue (Fig. 4F). Thus, these results demonstrated that MoS2@GA-Fe can selectively accumulate in the tumor sites and remain in the tumor sites for a long time. The therapeutic efficiency of the constructed •OH and H2S combined treatment was investigated in vivo by the administration of MoS2@GA-Fe (3 mg/kg) every 2 days for 3 cycles. PBS, MoS2, MoS2@GA were used as controls. The body weights of all groups of mice were recorded every two days, and the results showed no evident changes, implying low systemic toxicity of the nanomedicines (Fig. 4G). According to the observation, PBS and MoS2 treatment almost had no effect on the tumor growth during the time lines (Fig. 4H). Whereas the mice treated with MoS2@GA displayed tumor growth inhibition to an extent, which was partially attributed to the cytotoxicity and anti-angiogenesis effect of the GA. Notably, the tumor growth rate was significantly reduced after treatment with MoS2@GA-Fe. As a result, the tumor sizes were about ~ 1.8 times the preliminary size after 14 days of growth, which is far less than the growth of ~ 11.5 times in the PBS group. After 14 days of treatment, the tumor and main organs were harvested for HE staining. As shown in Fig. S6, large areas of the tumors in the MoS2@GA-Fe groups had necrosis. HE staining of the main organs showed no patent pathological damages (Fig. S7), indicating that the MoS2@GA-Fe had a negligible biotoxicity to these organs. The hemolytic activity of MoS2@GA-Fe was also tested, and no obvious hemolysis effect was found even at a high concentration of up to 300 μg/mL (Fig. S8). Next, the MoS2, MoS2@GA, and MoS2@GA-Fe were injected into healthy mice at 0, 2, and 4 days, and blood samples were collected at 14 days after the first injection. The RBC, PLT, WBC, HGB, ALT, AST, CREA, and UREA parameters were measured (Table S1), and HE staining of the bone marrow was also performed (Fig. S9). All of these results demonstrate that MoS2@GA-Fe had amazing therapeutic effects and great biocompatibility with the ability to eradicate cancer via reasonable utilization of the microenvironment."
15,Conclusion,"In summary, we constructed a stable MoS2@GA-Fe nanoreactor for combined cancer treatment integrating •OH and H2S. The nanoreactor displayed four advantages: i) the Fe(III)/GSH and MoS2/Fe reaction cycles provided highly efficient Fenton reactions to continuously generate a large amount of •OH. ii) Simultaneously, H2S was also produced and showed a toxicity effect to cancer cells. iii) As the MoS2 was degraded, the active sites of Mo(IV) increased, thus providing a “snowball effect” that enhanced the Fenton reaction. iv) The MoS2@GA-Fe can induce self-degradation in a normal environment with no cytotoxic substances, which can help with the elimination of MoS2@GA-Fe in main organs. PA/MR imaging-guided HCC treatment in vivo confirmed that the nanoreactor can obtain excellent treatment efficiency and biosafety. This TME-responsive treatment could be of great significance for the clinical transformation of nanomedicines."
