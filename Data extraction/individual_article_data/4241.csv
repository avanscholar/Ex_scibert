0,Introduction,"In today's world, economic systems are well-established, where goods are produced, used, and discarded. In this linear economy, the flow of products and services has a clear beginning and a clear end. A circular economy works quite differently: products and services are designed in a way that allows their reuse, either in biological or technical cycles. A circular economy aims to redefine growth, focusing on positive society-wide benefits. It entails gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and designing waste out of the system. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic, natural, and social capital [1]. Accordingly, this research aims to increase the economic and productive performance of small- and medium-size enterprises by providing added value to organic waste from their processes, guiding businessmen from this geographical region to increase the use of all sub-products [2]. Orange peels are one of these valuable waste materials discarded from juice industry. Since world citrus production is estimated in more than 120 million tons and a significant fraction is destined to industrialization, land space occupation and pollution with phenolic compounds due to waste dumping are causing widespread concern [3]. Disposal of orange peel waste has become a major problem for many food industries. The production of active carbons from agro-industrial waste such as orange peel (a renewable source) allows the elimination of polluting residues thus carrying out an effective management increasing its added value. Production of activated carbon from biomass can prove advantageous since it can prevent the generation of CO2 by fixing the carbon and since the activated carbon can go into the soil naturally [4]. Activated carbon can be produced by physical, chemical, physiochemical, and microwave-assisted activation using biochar and biomass as a source. This research primarily aims at the evaluation of the operational conditions in the preparation of active carbon from orange peel residue before the manufacture of local industrial juice. In this work, we propose the use of active carbon synthesized from orange peel residue as a support for a bimetallic catalyst to be tested in the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF). The justification of the chosen reaction resides in the fact that there is a worldwide interest in finding and increasing the existing energy alternatives to replace fossil fuels [5,6]. Its high harmful effects and the decrease in reserves encourage research on the development of energy resources from alternative sources. The production of liquid fuels derived from biomass arouses growing widespread interest to reduce dependence on decreasing fossil fuel resources [7,8]. The use of furans as an alternative spark-ignition engine fuel or fuel additive has been assessed in several studies. 2,5-DMF combustion in a spark-ignition (SI) engine has been assessed by Zhong et al. [9], showing similarities between 2,5-DMF and gasoline in their combustion and emission behavior. This highlights the possibility of using 2,5-DMF in current SI engines without major modifications. Emissions of carbonyl compounds during 2,5-DMF combustion were compared to those of gasoline and bio alcohols in a study by Resasco et al. [10]. It was shown that 2,5-DMF has the lowest emissions of carbonyl compounds, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde. Therefore, the catalytic conversion of HMF to 2,5-DMF is a promising and sustainable route in biomass use [11,12]. Since then, many efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of catalytic materials that optimize their production. Selective hydrogenation of HMF to 2,5-DMF involves CO hydrogenation and C–O hydrogenolysis; then 2,5-DMF must be desorbed from the site to leave the surface of the catalyst free for the next cycle [13] and to avoid deep hydrogenation or opening of the furan ring. Hence, designing the appropriate catalyst is central to obtain a site with the adequate capacity to hydrogenate without opening the aromatic ring. In previous works [14] we have demonstrated that the PtIr alloy combines the hydrogenating capacity of Pt and the hydrogenolysis capacity of Ir with a synergistic effect, influencing the catalytic performance of the catalyst. In this work, we propose the use of waste material, specifically, residual orange peel (WOP) as a carbon source for the synthesis of PtIr-supported carbon catalyst. The bimetallic-supported carbon catalyst is used to obtain 2,5-DMF biofuel from HMF biomass derivative."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of the activated carbon support,"2.1 Synthesis of the activated carbon support Oranges (Citrus sinensis) were purchased from a local fruit market, washed to eliminate dust and other residues, and peeled. Orange peels were cut in small pieces and dried at 100 °C overnight. The dried samples were then crushed, milled, and further rinsed with warm water, dried again and finally screen sieved. The precursor material afforded is hereinafter abbreviated as OP. The fraction of particle diameter between 500 and 1000 μm was selected for the preparation of the activated carbon. An OP sample was mixed with a H3PO4 solution with different concentrations 30, 40 or 50 wt %, in different weight ratios of acid/precursor of 3:1 or 6:1, with resting time of 24 h at room temperature and without resting time. Afterwards, the impregnated sample was heated in an electric furnace. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 470 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min and held for 1 h. The choice of temperature agrees with that reported in the literature [15–17]. The highest values of specific area were found at activation temperatures around 450 °C when H3PO4 was used as an activating agent for a lignocellulosic material. One particularly important distinctive character in its chemical mechanism is that phosphoric acid intervenes in the initial stages of the carbonization of the precursor, which begin at lower temperatures. After cooling to room temperature, deionized water was used to remove the excess of acid of the impregnated activated carbon until the pH of the filtered material became neutral. The sample was then dried in an oven to constant weight and the yield was evaluated. The developed activated carbon is hereinafter abbreviated as AC-OP. Table 1 shows the samples description."
3,Synthesis of the bimetallic-supported carbon catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of the bimetallic-supported carbon catalysts The bimetallic catalysts were obtained by wetness co-impregnation using chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6xH2O)) and iridium acetylacetonate (Ir(acac)2) as a source of platinum and iridium, respectively. Loading was 0.5 wt % of Pt and 0.5 wt % of Ir. The solid that showed the best structural and textural properties (by XRD and adsorption/desorption isotherms analysis) was chosen to carry out the impregnation. Those supports were synthesized with an activating acid concentration of 40 and 50%."
4,Characterization of catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts XRD patterns were collected by using a continuous scan mode. The scan speed was 0.02 deg (2 θ)/min in the Philips X'Pert PRO PANalyticaldiffractometer, operating with CuKaX-ray radiation (X-ray generator current and voltage set at 40 mA and 45 kV), using small divergence and scattering slits of 1/32 mm and a goniometer speed of 1.2° (2θ) min−1. The scanning range was set between 0.5° and 5°. The sample was crushed previously and placed in an aluminium sample holder. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C were measured on ASAP 2420 from Micromeritics after degassing the samples at 400 °C, determining textural properties as surface area and pore volume and pore size distribution. Elemental analyses were performed on a Euro EA Elemental Analyser Euro vector.X-ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) were obtained on a MicrotechMultilb 3000 spectrometer, equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser and MgKα (hν = 1253.6 eV) photon source. An estimated error of ±0.1 eV can be assumed for all measurements. Peak intensity was calculated from the respective peak areas after background subtraction and spectrum fitting by a combination of Gaussian/Lorentzian functions. Textural characterization of solids was performed by high-definition transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on JeolJEM-2100F equipment, working at a voltage of 200 kV. The HR micrograph analysis, lattice spacing, First Fourier Transform (FFT), and phase interpretation were done with the Gatan Digital Micrograph software (Gatan Inc.) and the Java version of the Electron Microscope Software (JEM). The SEM and EDX analysis were done in a Jeol JSM 5410 microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). Metal dispersion and particle size were determined by irreversible chemisorption of CO at 35 °C with Micromeritics Chemisorb 2720 apparatus. Samples of the reduced catalysts were further reduced with hydrogen at 350 °C before measuring/determining CO chemisorption. Dispersion was calculated by formula D% = (ns/nt) ∗ 100%, where ns is the number of surface metal atoms and nt is the total number of metal atoms in the sample. The number of surface atoms was determined using the adsorbed volume of CO at STP, considering that the stoichiometry of CO adsorption was one CO molecule interacts with one metal atom. ICP analysis was performed in an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. Thermo Scientific Model iCAP 7400 ICP-OES Duo with Autosampler."
5,Catalytic activity,"2.4 Catalytic activity The hydrogenation of HMF was performed in a 600 mL stirred stainless steel Parr, 4536 series reactors. Before the reaction, the catalyst was reduced to 470 °C for 4 h (temperature ramp of 3 °C/min) in a tubular furnace in a flow of pure hydrogen (50 mL/min). The reactor was sealed and purged with N2. When the reaction temperature was reached (130 °C), the reactor was pressurized with H2 (15 atm). Then, 1.2 mmol of HMF, 150 mg of catalyst, and 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) were added. The selection of an adequate solvent in the hydrogenation of HMF over PtIr-CMK-3 was studied in our previous work [14]. Acetonitrile, THF, and methanol were tested; good results were obtained with a less polar aprotic solvent as THF. We found that polar and protic methanol and aprotic acetonitrile were strongly adsorbed on the catalytic surface, showing competitive behavior with the reactant, and thus becoming a barrier for the diffusion of substrates and products. We have also carried out experiments in the aqueous phase (not published), but the results obtained were very poor. According to Wiesfeld et al. [18], the high reactivity of the formyl group of HMF leads to undesired oligomerization reactions when working in dilute aqueous solutions. To achieve practically interesting yields in water, they protected the formyl group of HMF by acetalization with 1,3-propanediol. For all the above, we have chosen to use THF as a solvent for the reaction under study in this research. The search for conditions where hydrogenation of HMF is not controlled by external mass transfer resistance was done through a series of experiments varying stirring speed rate and keeping the rest of the variables constant. When stirring speed was equal to or greater than 300 rpm, mass transfer resistance was not the controlling step. In the test for internal mass transfer limitations, the diameter of catalyst particles was varied; in diameters of particles lower than approximately 0.8 mm, the internal mass transfer resistance was negligible. From this analysis, the reaction conditions used were 360 rpm and catalyst particle diameter ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 mm. The products were analyzed with a HP 5890 Series II GC and HP-5 capillary column and identified by GC/MS."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts 3.1.1 XRD Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of all samples. Two broad peaks were found at 26 ̊ and 43 ̊ of 2theta, ascribed to (002) and (100) plane of graphite, respectively [19]. The XRD patterns of all activated carbon samples reveal the absence of sharp and strong peaks, indicating the amorphous structure of activated carbons. Elements such as sulfur and phosphorus were also present in AC; yet they were not detected by XRD in view of its trace level presence. They were detected only by EDX. 3.1.2 Adsorption/desorption isotherm analysis The specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of the samples were investigated using the BET and BJH method (Table 2 ). Fig. 2 shows different hysteresis loops for the samples. According to IUPAC classification, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of AC-OP1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 belong to type I (Fig. 2a), suggesting typical characteristics of microporous materials. Isotherms present high gas adsorption at low pressures followed by a wide curve and in some cases, they reach a horizontal saturation plateau at higher relative pressures. On the other hand, the adsorption isotherms of N2 of AC-OP7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 present a type-IV behavior according to IUPAC classification (Fig. 2b), usually associated with narrow slit-shaped pores. These isotherms indicate that the adsorption mechanism is different from that of desorption, a behavior evidenced by the presence of a hysteresis cycle upon reaching medium pressures, a new adsorption process begins derived from capillary condensation in the mesopores of the material. In the adsorption branch, a slope close to saturation is observed, which increases with the increase of the activating agent, hence increasing correlated adsorbent-adsorbate affinity. Contribution in the zone of medium partial pressures, due to the presence of mesoporosity, is responsible for the increase in adsorption capacity. The highest adsorption capacities are found in the curves that are furthest from type I, those with the highest mesoporosity [20,21], in agreement with the hysteresis obtained in the adsorption isotherms of N2 [22]. The best area was obtained for the sample AC-OP11 with 1429 m2/g. According to the mechanism of phosphoric acid activation [23], phosphates and polyphosphate bridges are formed by the reaction of H3PO4 with the organic species. The incorporation of phosphate groups leads to the expansion of the structure, and the pore is formed after removal of acid. As shown in Table 2, the increase in acid concentration improves the formation of mesoporous cavities, increasing material area. Regarding mesopore volume, it has been observed that an increase in the impregnation ratio favors the widening of the micropores by increasing the volume of mesopores of the activated carbons, in agreement with that reported in other studies [21–23]. Table 3 lists the values from the adsorption/desorption isotherms for the bimetallic catalysts using the best AC supports obtained. Here we observe that the mesoporous structure did not change significantly with the incorporation of the metallic nanoparticles. In all cases, the high surface area and mesopore volume were maintained. This indicates that nanoparticles are small and well dispersed around the material. CO chemisorption results indicate good dispersion of metal particles in high area supports, especially in PtIr-AC-OP9 to PtIr-AC-OP12, PtIr-AC-OP11 being the catalyst with the best dispersion and lowest particle size. Table 3 also depicts the results for the used and regenerated PtIr-AC-OP11 catalyst, whose discussion can be found in the reusability section. 3.1.3 SEM Fig. 3 illustrates the morphology of AC-OP11 sample. We can see the typical morphology of activated carbon; its surface presents irregular cavities and fine open pores, confirming that the material synthesis was effectively conducted. The elemental composition of the activated carbon was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) as shown in Table 4 . This has allowed us to investigate the composition of the support through the different conditions of the synthesis. Phosphorous was detected in all samples due to the interaction of the material with the acid. We observed that the presence of P increases with the increase inactivating agent concentration. 3.1.4 TEM Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the PtIr-AC-OP11 sample. We can see the image of the amorphous nature of the sample and the metal nanoparticles of Pt and Ir. 3.1.5 Elemental analysis Table 5 lists the results of the elemental analysis of the activated carbons obtained. Yield was calculated as the wt. % C of the activated carbon obtained/wt. % C of the precursor used x 100. No presence of sulfur has been found in activated carbons, commonly seen in biomass materials, along with low nitrogen ratio [15,24]. The performance obtained for activated carbons is, in general, greater for activated carbons prepared with low and intermediate impregnation ratios. During the carbonization-activation stage, the polymeric structures are decomposed and most of the other elements, in addition to carbon, are released (H, N and O), leaving the structure as rigid as carbon. The activating agent used promotes dehydration, depolymerization, and redistribution of the constituent polymers, as well as the conversion of aliphatic to aromatic groups, increasing the performance of coals versus other options. Yet, higher impregnation ratios lead to greater removal of tars from the coal pores, reducing the yield [25]. To study the reproducibility of the preparation methodology for activated carbons used in this work, we duplicated the synthesis of AC-OP11. The results for the AC-OP11 and AC-OP11bis carbons are shown in Table 6 . 3.1.6 XPS Table 7 shows the XPS results of OP-AC catalysts, the deconvolution results for each peak, and the total percentage of each component in the total spectrum. In all cases, numbers in brackets mean the percentage contribution of each characteristic species. The O1s peaks exhibit binding energies (BE) of 535, 533 and 531 eV ascribed to O–C, OC, O–CO, respectively. The peaks in the elemental survey scan at 284, 286 and 288 eV are attributed to the Sp2-bonded carbon CC, hydroxyl C–O, and carboxyl O–CO bonded carbon, respectively [26]. The presence of these bonds indicates that the surface of the AC prepared by phosphoric acid activation and carbonization at 470 °C has high content of oxygenated functional groups and graphene sheets. According to the literature [27,28], the doublet whose main peak is at the binding energies of 71 eV is assigned to Pt(0), whereas the doublet at the binding energies of 72 eV is assigned to Pt(II). On the other hand, a doublet whose main peak is at 61 eV is assigned to Ir(0) and at 62 eV is assigned to Ir–O [21]. After reduction with hydrogen, the presence of the doublets corresponding to the positions of Pt 4f7/2 and Ir 4f7/2 in all samples and their relevance indicates the success in the reduction of the metallic species. The presence of both peaks reveals the existence of both species on the OP-AC surface. The shift towards a higher BE observed for some samples may result from strong metal-support interaction due to the smaller size of the particles, which would agree with the greater percentage of reduced species. On the other hand, the alloy formation between Pt and Ir leads to the increase of the Pt 4f7/2 core-level BE and to the decrease of BE of Ir 4f7/2 in relation to the BE of pure metals [29]. The best reduction percentages were obtained for IrPt-AC-OP11 and IrPt-AC-OP12 catalysts. Table 7 also shows the XPS results for the used and regenerated PtIr-AC-OP11 catalyst, whose discussion is found in the reusability section. 3.1.7 Catalytic activity From reported studies [30,31], a brief reaction pathway for HDO of HMF to 2,5-DMF is proposed in the scheme of Fig. 5 . In the pathway where the chances of yielding products different from 2,5-DMF are minimized, the oxygen in the carbonyl group of HMF can be activated by hydrogenation sites to BHMF as the primary intermediate. Similarly, oxygen in the hydroxyl groups of BHMF is attacked by an H2 in a site capable of producing hydrogenolysis via MFA. MFA is the key precursor to give 2,5-DMF, which means that HMF is directly or indirectly transformed into MFA during the hydrogenolysis process [31]. According to the experimental results shown in Figs. 6 and 2 ,5-DMF is the dominant product over all catalysts synthesized. However, the best performance was observed for PtIr-AC-OP11 and PtIr-AC-OP12. In all reactions, the presence of MFA and absence of FA as intermediates indicate the selective pathway to 2,5-DMF during the reaction process, minimizing unwanted products such as those obtained by decarbonylation routes. The nature of the metals deposited on the support can affect the hydrogenation activities and selectivity by influencing the surface reactions and the adsorption. These results are associated with the affinity of the reactants for the metals. Due to the presence of the multifunctional groups, HMF can bind to a catalytic surface through its aromatic furan ring or through the carbonyl or hydroxymethyl groups. In this case, the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts showed great improvement due to a synergistic effect. The addition of a second metal may have been effective in adapting the electronic and geometric structures of the nanoparticles. The transfer of electrons between the two metals may have caused the formation of electron-deficient atoms, acting as Lewis adsorption sites for the oxygen atom of the CO bond. The polarized group is therefore easily hydrogenated by hydrogen. In this sense, Y. Nakagawa et al. [32] have shown that the Ir atom on the catalyst surface promotes adsorption at the CO site. On the other hand, according to results of carbon materials for hydrogen storage application, doping of N, B, S, and P heteroatoms can strengthen the interaction energy of hydrogen and carbon by inducing the dipole moment [33]. Baininget al. [34] studied the role of phosphorus for Pd catalysts for styrene hydrogenation. They suggested that phosphorus doping leads to a greater dispersion of Pd, which is beneficial to the reaction proceeding. On the other hand, DFT calculations revealed the favorable interaction of H2 with adjacent B and N atoms, where relief in the angle strain is the driving force for the hydrogenation reaction. Considering that the electronegativity of P is higher than that of B atom, it can be assumed that the interaction of hydrogen molecule will be enhanced further on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). Finally, a strong correlation is found between the reactivity of the metallic active site surface with that of the dispersed systems, which allows predicting the activity and selectivity of noble metal-based catalysts under practical conditions in the liquid and gas phase. The order in which the surface meets hydrogen and HMF is of major importance. When HMF meets a bare surface, it hinders the subsequent dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen and the resulting hydrogenation activity. For this reason, the dispersion of the metallic sites favored, in this case, by the large surface area and the presence of phosphorus in the catalysts with higher yields is particularly important. The efficiency of the PtIr-AC-OP11 catalyst must be understood as a function of highly active and selective bimetallic sites, high surface area, uniform mesopore size, and influence of the neutral and hydrophobic nature of the surface of the activated carbon support. The hydrophobic nature of the carbonaceous support plays a major role in the selectivity of this reaction, as demonstrated in our previous work [14]. There we found that the hydrophobic nature of the mesoporous carbon CMK-3 was key as compared to the catalyst with a siliceous SBA-15 support. The presence of adsorbed water in the catalysts poisons active sites and promotes unwanted reactions. For this reason, it is key affording carbonaceous supports, with high surface area and presence of mesopores obtained in a simple way with agro-industrial waste. In the case of the best catalyst PtIr-AC-OP11, the good activity and selectivity of the desired product 2,5-DMF can be linked to the high hydrogenating capacity of bimetallic sites, the characteristics of the hydrophobic support and the high dispersion achieved on the mesoporous activated carbon support. 3.1.8 Reusability of the catalyst Stability is of great importance for the commercial application of heterogeneous catalysts. The reuse of the PtIr-AC-OP11 catalyst for the selective hydrogenolysis of HMF to 2,5-DMF was tested. Between the first two cycles, the catalyst was recovered in four different ways, as seen in Fig. 7 . When recovering the catalyst only by washing it with water, a significant decrease in catalytic performance was observed during reuse. This could result from the existence of the irreversible adsorption of organic material from the first reaction that blocks the active sites of the catalyst. When the catalyst was recovered by washing it with water and ethanol, the activity suffered fewer drops. In the third case, activity increased less when the catalyst was previously washed and then subjected to a thermal treatment with N2 to remove, gently and in an inert atmosphere, any deposit that could be blocking the active sites, and subsequently reduced with H2 (as described in the experimental section). In this case we can observe a slight decrease in activity, indicating that this procedure is the most suitable for regeneration. BET area and pore volume and size of used PtIr-AC-OP11 are listed in Table 3. In the Table we can observe the values for the used and regenerated PtIr-AC-OP11 catalyst. When the spent catalyst is regenerated by washing with water and ethanol, a significant decrease in area and pore size and volume is observed. This is probably due to the presence of the irreversible adsorbed subproducts blocking the pores. However, when the material is heated in a flow of N2 and then reduced with H2, BET area and pore size increase, indicating the elimination of these compounds. The present study confirms that the structure and porosity of the mesoporous carbon were not modified during the reaction, not even after subsequent heat treatment. The spent catalyst was also characterized by XPS (Table 7). The results indicate that no appreciable leaching of metals occurred after reaction and part of Pt and Ir is still oxidized. To confirm the absence of noble metal leaching, ICP analysis of the solution resulting from the reaction was performed when the fresh catalyst was used. As a result of the analysis, the presence of these metals was not detected. The observed deactivation could be due to an increase in metal particle size, as suggested by the decrease in dispersion and particle size according to the value obtained by CO chemisorption. On the other hand, as in the reaction medium, there is excess H2; the platinum and iridium species could be reduced before reaching the reaction temperature. Fig. 7 shows the results of the reaction using the fresh catalyst without being previously reduced with H2. As can be seen, the activity is lower than that obtained with the pre-reduced catalyst. This may be so since the reaction temperature is not high enough to completely reduce bimetallic particles, as we were able to determine in our previous study [14]. According to the TPR, the reduction temperature of the PtIr bimetallic particles in PtIr/CMK-3 was 190 °C."
8,Conclusion,"In this research we transformed agro-industrial waste into a support catalyst with large surface area and uniform pore size. Carbon activation was carried out through a chemical process varying phosphoric acid concentration and time of contact between the acid and the carbon substrate. The activated carbon with the best properties was obtained using carbonization time of 1 h, temperature of carbonization of 470 °C, and phosphoric acid concentration of 50 wt %. High BET area of 1429 m2/g and mesopores of approximately 5 nm were obtained. The bimetallic PtIr-catalyst prepared with this support showed 100% of HMF conversion and high selectivity, more than 90% to the desired 2,5-DMF product. The presence of phosphorus doping leaded to greater dispersion of bimetallic nanoparticles, beneficial to the reaction pathway. In this case, the presence of MFA and absence of FA indicated the selective pathway to 2,5-DMF, minimizing the undesired decarbonylation routes. Consequently, the high yield obtained can be linked to the high hydrogenating capacity of the bimetallic sites, the characteristics of the hydrophobic support, and the high dispersion of the active sites achieved on the phosphorous doped mesoporous activated carbon support. Reusability studies established the stability of the catalyst after recycling, with a moderate deactivation due to a low growth in the size of metallic particles. We achieved a very high performance of a product with high added value such as 2,5-DMF, changing the mechanism of the reaction towards the selective pathway in the direction of the desired product. In addition, by taking advantage of biomass derivatives as raw materials, this process falls within chemical environmentally friendly processes."
