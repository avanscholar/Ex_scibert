0,Introduction,"Shrinking fossil fuel reserves, the concern of greenhouse gas emission and global climate change, strict regulations for mandatory renewable content in transportation fuels as well as subsidies offered by different governments are some of the reasons for wide exploration of biodiesel production technologies. Transesterification of vegetable oils, animal fats and other lipids (microbial origin) is the core process involved in biodiesel production. During transesterification process, crude glycerol (CG) is generated as a waste by-product, which is around 10% by weight of the biodiesel produced by the process [1]. Considering possible increase in global biodiesel production and the amount of CG produced by the process, there is a need for a sustainable strategy of CG management. Utilization of CG as a feedstock for microbial production of commercially important products could be an interesting option [2]. In this context, production of bio-hydrogen by bioconversion of CG has been evaluated by various researchers [3–5]. Actually, H2 is considered as an ideal renewable energy source for future because it does not produce any greenhouse gas during combustion. In fact, it is the only carbon free fuel to produce only water as combustion by-product as well as it has highest energy content among gaseous fuels of equivalent weight [6]. Similarly, it can be easily fed to fuel cells or internal combustion engines for energy conversion [7]. However, CG is not a pure substrate for hydrogen production and it may contain a range of impurities. Methanol, salt and soap are three of the major impurities present in CG and they might have certain effect on hydrogen production by CG bioconversion [8,9]. In fact, type of substrate and carbon–nitrogen ratio of the media has significant influence on hydrogen production [10]. As the impurities such as methanol and soap could also be utilized as carbon sources, their presence or absence in the media might affect the performance of the process. Moreover, all three impurities might show certain interactions among themselves and these possibilities are yet to be explored for a bio-hydrogen production process. Thus, the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of these three CG impurities on hydrogen production by glycerol bioconversion. The investigation has been carried out using response surface methodological approach and the experimental plan was prepared by using central composite design. Batch bio-hydrogen production experiments were carried out using small scale anaerobic bioreactors by employing Enterobacter aerogenes [11,12]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Crude glycerol (CG) used in the present investigation is a by-product of biodiesel production process which was collected from Rothsay®, Canada. Other chemicals, such as glucose, ethanol, NaOH, HCl, MgSO4 7H2O, sodium periodate, acetone, acetylacetone, bromophenol blue and acetic acid were purchased from Fisher scientific (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Casein peptone and KH2PO4 were supplied by VWR International (Ontario, Canada) and the yeast extract used in the present study was a gift from Lallemand, Canada."
3,Microorganism and inoculum preparation,"2.2 Microorganism and inoculum preparation E. aerogenes NRRL B-407, the microorganism considered for the present investigation was provided by ARS, USDA, USA. It is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium known to produce hydrogen by using a range of organic substrates. The microorganism was grown and maintained in a culture medium composed of glucose (5 g/L), casein peptone (5 g/L), KH2PO4 (2 g/L), MgSO4·7H2O (0.5 g/L) and yeast extract (0.5 g/L) [13]. For the entire investigation, the same growth medium was used to prepare the inocula. For inoculum development, the microorganism was anaerobically grown at 30 ± 1 °C (150 rpm) using a rotary shaker incubator and 5% (v/v) freshly prepared (exponential growth phase) cell suspension was used as inoculum for all the experiments conducted in the present investigation."
4,Saponification of crude glycerol and separation of soap,"2.3 Saponification of crude glycerol and separation of soap The soap used in the present investigation was separated from a CG sample collected from biodiesel production plant. The CG sample was first saponified by a slightly modified method based on the original method reported by Hu et al. [14]. Briefly, 10 g CG was dissolved 100 mL water and the solution was mixed with 100 mL of 50 g/L NaOH-ethanol solution. The mixture was taken in a screw cap bottle and kept in a rotary shaking water bath (90 ± 1 °C/50 rpm) for 1 h. After cooling the mixture to room temperature equal volume of deionized water was added and the soap present in the solution was precipitated by salting out [15] (using 10% w/v NaCl). Precipitated soap was separated from the solution by centrifugation (5000 g for 20 min) and lyophilized for 24 h prior to its application in the investigation. Entire process of soap separation has been shown in Fig. 1 ."
5,Experimental design and hydrogen production experiments,"2.4 Experimental design and hydrogen production experiments As already mentioned, methanol, soap and NaCl are the three impurities of crude glycerol which were evaluated in the present investigation for their role in CG bioconversion and hydrogen production. A central composite design was employed to study their effect using response surface methodology (RSM). In Table 1 , the amount of the impurities which could be present in a CG sample has been summarized based on literature data. Similarly, 10 g/L CG has been found to be optimum for biohydrogen production [16]. Therefore, as presented in Tables 1 and 2 , the minimum concentrations of the impurities that could be present in 10 g/L CG have been considered as the central points of the independent variables (impurities) for present experimental design. Further, the experimental design has been constructed by using Design-Expert®-7 software (Stat-Ease Inc. Minneapolis, MN) and the design has been extended up to +α and −α level (Table 2). Based on the design, 20 different runs of experiments were performed using different combinations of the independent variables (impurities) as presented in Table 3 . Cumulative hydrogen production (mmol/L after 48 h) and percent utilization of glycerol have been considered as the two responses (dependent variables) of the investigations (Table 3). All the experiments were carried out by using 125 mL serum bottles with 50 mL working volume. The experiments were performed using (separate serum bottles) a culture media composed of pure glycerol (5 g/L), casein peptone (1 g/L) and yeast extract (0.05 g/L) with which different concentrations of methanol, soap and NaCl were mixed according to the experimental plan (Table 3). One control experiment was carried out using the same media composition (but devoid of any impurity) and this experiment was not a part of the present experimental design. Further, pH 6 was found to be optimum for H2 production by E. aerogenes [5]. Hence, the pH of the culture media taken in different serum bottles was adjusted to 6 by using 0.1 N NaOH/HCl solutions. Subsequently, the media were sparged with ultrapure N2 gas for 2 min to create anaerobic environment for supporting the growth of the facultative anaerobic bacteria (E. aerogenes). The bottles sparged with N2 were immediately sealed with aluminium crimp seal containing silicone septum (Fisher scientific, Canada) with the help of a hand operated crimper (E-Z Crimper™, VWR International, Ontario, Canada). Sealed bottles were sterilized by autoclaving and cooled to room temperature following which they were inoculated using the inoculum mentioned in previous section (Section 2.2). Inoculation was made through the silicone septum of the crimp seal of the serum bottle by using a sterile syringe fitted with a fine needle. Finally, the bottles were incubated at 30 ± 1 °C by using an orbital incubator shaker maintained at 150 rpm [16]. By using a 5 mL gastight syringe gas samples (1 mL each) were collected from the headspace of the culture bottle and kept in gas sampling vial (Exetainer®, Labco, UK) for gas chromatographic analysis. Similarly, at the end of the fermentation (H2 production process), 1 mL of liquid sample was also collected from each bottle for residual glycerol content analysis."
6,Analytical techniques,"2.5 Analytical techniques 2.5.1 Hydrogen analysis After 48 h of incubation, H2 gas produced in the case of each experiment was collected (as already mentioned in previous section) in gas sampling vial (Exetainer®, Labco, UK) and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Varian 3800, USA) fitted with PoraPLOT Q® column (Agilent technology, USA) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Likewise, the column temperature was fixed at 100 °C and nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with a gas flow rate of 3.5 mL/min and the retention time was 4.5 min. Obtained value was expressed as mmol H2/L media. 2.5.2 Glycerol analysis During hydrogen production process aqueous samples were collected at regular interval (24 h). Glycerol concentration of such samples was measured by using a spectrophotometric method of glycerol analysis proposed by Bondioli et al. (2005) [17]. Briefly (please see the original method for further information), 1 mL of the aqueous sample (after proper dilution with distilled water) was mixed with 1 mL ethanol (47.5% v/v). Further, 1.2 mL each of 0.2 M acetylacetone solution and 10 mM sodium periodate solution (both were prepared by using a 1:1 mixture of 1.6 M acetic acid and 4.0 M ammonium acetate stock solution) were added to the mixture. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was incubated at 70 ± 1 °C for 1 min by using a rotary shaker water bath and immediately cooled to 20 ± 1 °C by using cold water. The samples were maintained at the same temperature (by changing the water, if needed) until the optical density (410 nm) was measured by using an UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Carry 100 Bio®, Varian USA) [18]."
7,Results and discussion,"The results and discussion portion of the present investigation could be divided into two parts based on the two different responses considered in the study. In the first part, the effect of the impurities on hydrogen production has been discussed and the second part deals with glycerol utilization."
8,Effect of the impurities on cumulative H2 production,"3.1 Effect of the impurities on cumulative H2 production The responses (hydrogen production and glycerol utilization) obtained for different runs of experiments carried out using different concentrations of the impurities have been presented in Table 3. Obtained responses of the experiments were analyzed by using the same software (Design-expert®) used for designing of the experiments. Response surface linear model was the suggested model for the response observed in terms of hydrogen production. The ANOVA report for the response surface linear model has been presented in Table 4 . The model was significant for the observed response of hydrogen production with insignificant lack of fit and factor C (soap) was the most significant factor. Similarly, the graphs obtained by analysis of the response for hydrogen production have been presented in Figs. 2–4 . Fig. 2 represents the response obtained as a function of methanol (factor A) concentration. Methanol had a strong negative effect on H2 production and the increase in methanol concentration from 1.3 g/L to 3.3 g/L can result in the decrease in cumulative H2 production. Meanwhile, in an investigation of docosahexaenoic acid production by bioconversion of crude glycerol, Pyle et al. (2008) have mentioned that due to the increase in methanol concentration from 0 to 20 g/L in the culture, media biomass productivity could be decreased from 1.92 ± 0.08 g/L d to 0.94 ± 0.08 g/L d [19]. Therefore, known inhibitory effect of methanol on microbial growth could be the most possible reason of present observation. Likewise, Fig. 3 represents the response of hydrogen production obtained as a function of NaCl (factor B) concentration. By increasing the NaCl concentration from 0.15 g/L to 0.55 g/L, cumulative H2 production could be improved from around 1.3 mmol/L to 1.6 mmol/L. There may be two reasons for such observation. Firstly, NaCl might be helping in maintaining the osmotic balance of the system leading to improved H2 production. Secondly, NaCl may form the salt of organic acids (e.g. sodium acetate with the acetic acid) produced during the process by which it may improve the buffering capacity of the system. As pH change due to organic acid production can significantly inhibit the process, improvement of buffering capacity (due to NaCl) of the media could enhance the hydrogen production. The present observation is strongly supported by a previous study by Ngo et al. (2011) where the authors have reported the beneficial effect of NaCl on H2 production using pre-treated crude glycerol [20]. Thus, it can be concluded that although NaCl is an impurity in CG, its presence in the concentration level tested in the present study has no negative effect on the process. Unlike NaCl, soap (factor C) was found to be inhibitory for hydrogen production. Moreover, as shown in Table 4 it is found to be the most significant factor (p value = 0.0104 < 0.05) to influence the process. Fig. 4 is the graphical representation of the influence of the factor on hydrogen production. As it is clear from the figure, an increase in soap concentration from 1 g/L to 3 g/L can decrease the cumulative hydrogen production by nearly 33% and reduce the production from around 1.8 mmol/L to 1.2 mmol/L. Meanwhile, in an investigation of eicosapentaenoic acid production by bioconversion of biodiesel derived CG Athalye et al. (2009) have shown that even a soap concentration as low as 1 g/L can significantly reduce the biomass as well as the product yield and it supports our findings [21]. Further, possible role of soap molecules in the disruption of microbial cell membranes could be a reason of our observation. Thus, in the concentration ranges tested in the present study, methanol and soap were found to have negative effect on hydrogen production. Therefore, proper pre-treatment of CG for soap and methanol removal could be the best option for improved H2 production."
9,Effect of the impurities on glycerol utilization,"3.2 Effect of the impurities on glycerol utilization Similar to the responses for hydrogen production, glycerol utilization responses obtained for 20 different runs of experiments have been presented in Table 3 and analyzed by Design Expert-7 software. Unlike the data for hydrogen production, response surface linear model could not be fitted to the data obtained for glycerol utilization indicating that the factors might have interaction among themselves. All the graphs generated during the analysis of the data obtained for glycerol utilization have been shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5(a) shows the 3 dimensional response surface indicating the effect of methanol and NaCl (factors A & B) on glycerol utilization. It could be determined that the glycerol utilization has been significantly reduced by initial methanol concentration higher than 2.3 g/L. Similar to other alcohols, methanol could be toxic to bacterial cell either by destroying their cell wall or by altering the functions of intracellular proteins [22]. Hence, reduced glycerol utilization at higher methanol concentration could be attributed to detrimental effect of the alcohol to the process organism. Likewise, maximum glycerol utilization could be observed for initial methanol concentration of around 2 g/L. Alcohol concentration dependent improvement in cell permeability [23] and probable improvement in glycerol uptake rate could be a reason for such response of glycerol utilization. Moreover, at methanol concentration less than 1.5 g/L slight decrease in glycerol utilization has been observed. A possible reason for finding of this kind could be that at relatively low methanol concentration improvement in cell permeability was not sufficient to significantly improve the substrate utilization; on the contrary, at such concentration methanol may compete with the substrate for preferential utilization. However, it is a general assumption and it has to be established by proper investigation. Similarly, from Fig. 5(a) corresponding to the increase in NaCl concentration improvement in glycerol utilization could be observed. Considering NaCl, it is an identical response obtained for both glycerol utilization and hydrogen production which has been discussed in previous section. Likewise, a similar response (increase in glycerol utilization) has been observed (Fig. 5b) when both soap and NaCl concentration have been simultaneously increased to maximum. Further, from Fig. 5(c) it could be summarized that at constant NaCl (0.3 g/L) and relatively low methanol (around 1.8 g/L) concentration, percent utilization of glycerol could be slightly increased by increasing the soap concentration. Meanwhile, surfactant is known to improve the bioavailability of organic substrate [24]; hence, soap mediated improved glycerol utilization could be the most probable reason of present observation. However, unlike the present observation (response 2), as already mentioned, a strong negative effect of soap could be observed for response 1 (hydrogen production) Fig. 4. Thus, it has been noted that by increasing the soap concentration from 1 g/L to 3 g/L glycerol utilization could be slightly improved however corresponding increase in hydrogen production has not been observed. Metabolic shift, a phenomenon commonly observed in fermentative hydrogen production [25] may be a reason for reduced hydrogen production in presence of relatively higher amount of soap. Thus, soap and methanol in the initial concentration ranges investigated in the present study were found to have very strong negative effect on hydrogen production by CG bioconversion process. Further, Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen production profile obtained for a control experiment carried out without the addition of any impurity. Cumulative hydrogen production obtained for the control experiment was higher than all 20 runs of experiment carried out using different concentration of the impurities. Actually, compared to the control experiment (Fig. 6) 21.56–95.31% reduction in cumulative H2 production could be observed in the case of 20 runs of experiments carried out using different concentration of the impurities (Table 3). This observation further confirmed the inhibitory effect of the impurities. Meanwhile, the present investigation was planned considering that 10 g/L CG is optimum for hydrogen production. Therefore, from the responses obtained from the experimental design (Table 3), it could be summarized that hydrogen production could be improved by diluting the CG below 10 g/L. However, it should also be considered that by diluting the CG, the glycerol present in CG will also be diluted and it will have a negative effect on cumulative H2 production of the process. Thus, selective removal of methanol and soap could be the most obvious option for enhanced CG bioconversion. Methanol could be evaporated from a CG sample by increasing the temperature beyond 65 °C [19,26]. Likewise, as it is already described salting out (by adding NaCl) of soap could be an interesting option. Moreover, NaCl has showed beneficial response for hydrogen production as well as it might have a role in improving the buffering capacity (as already discussed good buffering capacity of the media is beneficial for fermentative H2 production) of the process. Hence, by applying NaCl, a combined soap removal and pH management strategy could be developed for enhanced H2 production by CG bioconversion. Presently we are working on this strategy and it will be communicated as a separate report."
10,Conclusions,"Using response surface methodology, role of three different CG impurities (soap, methanol and NaCl) on hydrogen production and glycerol bioconversion has been evaluated. Among these impurities, soap (1–3 g/L) was found to have significant (p value = 0.0104 < 0.05) inhibitory effect on hydrogen production. Likewise, methanol (1.3–3.3 g/L) has also showed similar response in the concentration range considered. Interestingly, for both the impurities, the response for glycerol utilization was not similar to the response obtained hydrogen production (as expected). Co-utilization of the impurities along with glycerol as well as a metabolic shift due to the presence of the impurities was identified as most probable reason for such observation. Meanwhile, NaCl was found to have beneficial effect for both H2 production and glycerol utilization. Based on the observations a novel strategy involving NaCl has been proposed for combined soap removal and buffer capacity improvement of CG based media."
