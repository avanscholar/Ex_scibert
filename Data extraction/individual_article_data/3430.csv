0,Introduction,"In recent years, a continuous increase in the range of applications of composite materials has been observed. Extensive modification possibilities allow obtaining properties that make them competitive with conventional materials used so far. From mechanical properties, polymer composites based on thermoset resins reinforced with continuous fibrous fillers are most often compared to metals and alloys [1]. Thanks to additional various modification methods, thermoset composites can also exhibit favorable thermal, thermomechanical and electrical properties [2–4]. Among lightweight structural composites with significant mechanical strength, materials based on the epoxy matrix are one of the most often produced. Although the most favorable mechanical properties are obtained for thermoset composites reinforced with carbon [5,6] and inorganic fibers, including those made of glass [7,8] and basalt [9] as well as their hybrids [10–12]; for ecological reasons, more attention is paid to the production of materials reinforced with natural plant fibers [13]. While the strength properties of natural fibers significantly differ from the strength of carbon and inorganic fibers, their significantly lower density and manufacturing costs cause the continuous expansion of their range of applications [14,15]. Life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis conducted in so far published studies clearly indicates that the process of producing natural fibers is significantly less energy-consuming than the most commonly used in the glass fiber industry. Non-renewable energy requirements calculated for the whole production process of flax fiber mat and china reed fiber were reported as 9.55 and 3.64 MJ/kg, respectively. For comparison, the non-renewable energy intended for the production of glass fiber mat is 54.7 MJ/kg [16]. The studies published so far have noted numerous applications of natural fibers used as reinforcements for epoxy composites, among which should be mentioned: kenaf [17], sisal [18], jute [19], pineapple leaf [20], silk [21] or hemp [22]. The problem often encountered in the production of polymeric composites is limited adhesion at the polymer-filler interface. In order to increase the adhesion between composite components resulting in the improvement of mechanical properties, various methods of modification are used, including the introduction of compatibilizers [23] or surface modification of the fibers [24,25]. Among the methods of modification, the most commonly used are silanization, mercerization and benzoylation [26]. All these methods significantly affect the chemical structure of the fiber and also cause changes in the filler surface. In the case of lignocellulosic fibers, the chemical treatment most often changes the physical and chemical structure of the fiber connected with reactions with the cellulose hydroxyl (−OH) groups [27]. Silanization is the most often used chemical treatment method applied for modification of the fibrous fillers used for the development of polymer composites [28,29]. The use of appropriately functionalized silane with the chemical structure SiH4 allows for reducing the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the modified filler. In the presence of water, alkoxy groups defeat the hydrolysis process by creating silanols that react with hydroxyl groups located on the surface of the modified material, forming stable covalent bonds. As a result, it leads to limiting the hydrophilicity of the filler and obtaining the effect of reactivity or compatibility with selected polymers, depending on the type of silane functional groups [30,31]. For industrial applications, hydrogen peroxide is often used as a bleaching agent for cellulosic materials. It is also known to use a combination of ozonation and hydrogen peroxide bleaching for linen fabrics [32]. In addition, conventional alkaline treatment methods for fabric cleaning are applied in the textile industry. Treatment of flax fiber methods such as leaching, bleaching and mercerization and their influence on flax/epoxy composites characteristics was described by Cherif et al. [33]. The mercerization and bleaching process improved the mechanical properties and water sorption resistance of the composites. Wang et al. [34] investigated the impact of various fiber surface treatment methods (alkalization, silanization, acetylation and alkaline silanization) on the dynamic mechanical behavior of flax fabrics/epoxy composites under hygrothermal aging. Acetylation has proven to be the most effective method for these materials. Razak et al. proposed in their work the use of hydrogen peroxide for surface modification of kenaf fibers used as a reinforcement of polylactide (PLA) composites [35]. The use of the bleaching process in hydrogen peroxide due to a change in the chemical composition of the fibers allowed the production of composites with increased strength in comparison to a series of materials reinforced with unmodified fibers. This is an indirect effect of removing the natural lignin fibers from the chemical composition and changing the specific surface of the fibers, which affects their wettability by the polymer matrix [35,36]. In recent years, scientists have developed a number of different methods for modifying flax fibers. Wang et al. studied flax fibers grafted with organic nanoclay supported by a silane coupling agent as reinforcement of the epoxy matrix [37]. In turn, as reported by Meenakshi et al., the incorporation of alkali-treated flax fibers into the epoxy resin significantly improved the mechanical properties of the composites [38]. The tensile creep behavior of bio-based epoxy composites reinforced with flax fiber modified by furfuryl alcohol was described by Jia et al. [39]. Whereas, flax fibers treated by supercritical carbon dioxide as a reinforcement for thermoset matrices were the subject of the work of Seghini et al. [40]. Based on the available literature, it can be concluded that there is still a need to improve the surface properties of natural fibers using various methods, such as physical and chemical treatment, adding coupling agents to produce composites with the desired properties [13]. It should be emphasized that this work focuses not only on the use of one method of fiber modification but, importantly, on the effect of the simultaneous use of two treatments. In the research to date, the subject of the use of double surface modification has not been widely researched. The simultaneous use of silanization with immersion in hydrogen peroxide has been reported only for composites reinforced with oil palm mesocarp fiber [41]. This work aims to assess the mechanical, thermomechanical properties and structure of epoxy composites reinforced with locally available flax/cotton fiber fabrics, which have undergone a two-stage modification consisting of the simultaneous use of silanization with immersion in alkaline bleaching with hydrogen peroxide."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and sample preparation,"2.1 Materials and sample preparation The polymeric matrix used in the studies consists of epoxy resin based on bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, Epidian 6 (EP6, epoxy number 0.51−0.54 mol/100 g and viscosity 10 000–15 000 mPa s at 25°) and triethylenetetramine (Z1, amine number min. 1100 mg KOH/g and viscosity 20–30 mPa s at 25°). CIECH Sarzyna S.A produced both ingredients. As a reinforcing filler, flax/cotton woven fabrics with 56:44 flax to cotton ratio with a plain weave, grammage of 160 g/m2 and 5 % shrinkage (Polski Len, Poland) were used."
3,Modification of the flax/cotton fabrics,"2.2 Modification of the flax/cotton fabrics Part of prepared fragments of flax/cotton fabric with a dimension of 300 × 300 mm were subjected to surface modification process using a 6% water solution peroxide. The fabrics were immersed with H2O2 and left for 24 h at the temperature room. After that, the excess water was evaporated in a laboratory drying cabinet at a temperature of 80 °C. The second modification method was salinization. Natural fibers were chemically modified using Sigma Aldrich 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (3-APS). Before silanization fabrics were dried for 24 h at 80 °C. 2 wt% of 3-APS, corresponding to the weight percentage of filler, was hydrolyzed in a mixture of ethanol and water (50:50 v/v) with using ProLab Disperlux mechanical stirrer with a rotational speed of 500 rpm for 3 h. Then, fabrics were immersed in a solution of ethanol-water containing 3-APS and stirred for 3 h, and after that drained and placed on a flat surface and dried at 80 °C for 24 h to evaporate the residual ethanol and water content. In each case, three sheets of fabric with an area of 0.09 m2 were immersed in 2 L of the respective solution. The third series of the fiber modification include two-step chemical treatment, including rinsing in H2O2 and the following silanization. In the further part of the manuscript, composite samples were named in relation to the modification method: LH — unmodified fibers, LHS — silanized fibers, LHO — modified fibers with the hydrogen peroxide, LHOS — two-stage modified fibers."
4,Sample preparation,"2.3 Sample preparation During the investigations, the constant resin-to-curing agent ratio was used of 100:13 by weight. The compositions were prepared by mechanical mixing using ProLAB Disperlux stirrer with a rotational speed of 1000 rpm in time of 3 min under subatmospheric pressure (0.2 bar). Before the manufacturing process, the fabrics were dried using Memmert ULE 500 cabinet dryer for 24 h with a temperature of 50 °C. The triple layer laminates were prepared by hand lay-up method. After the forming process, samples were cured in ambient temperature for 24 h and postured for the next 24 h at 80 °C using Memmert ULE 500 cabinet dryer."
5,Methods,"2.4 Methods The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were realized using a spectrometer Jasco FT/IR-4600, at room temperature (23 °C) in a mode of Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR - FT-IR). A total of 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1 was used in all cases to record the spectra. The color of fabrics subjected to different treatments was evaluated according to the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) through L*a*b* coordinates [42]. In this system, L* is the color lightness (L* = 0 for black and L* = 100 for white), a* is the green(−)/red(+) axis, and b* is the blue(−)/yellow(+) axis. The color was determined by optical spectroscopy using HunterLab Miniscan MS/S-4000S spectrophotometer. The number of samples measured was 15. The total color difference parameter (ΔE*) was calculated according to the following formulation [43]: (1) ΔE* = [(ΔL*)2 + (Δa*)2 + (Δb*)2]0.5 The mechanical behavior of the composites was investigated using static tensile and flexural tests. The tensile and flexural tests were performed in accordance with ISO 527 and ISO 178 standards with a Zwick/Roell Z020 universal testing machine at room temperature. The elastic modulus measurements were conducted at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, while the elongation at the break – at 5 mm/min. Flexural strength measurements were realized with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min during the evaluation of the bending modulus and 1.5 mm/min over the remaining parts of the experiment. The number of samples measured was 10. The hardness of the materials was determined with an ASTM D2583 standard Barcol hardness tester (Barber Colman, GYZJ-934-1). Presented test results are the mean value of 30 measurements taken for each composite series. Drop impact tests were realized using the TQC Impact tester 1890 according to ISO 6272–1:2002 standard. In order to assess the type of damage of the composites to impact energies of 1, 2, 3 and 4 J were applied. For each drop load of each material series, at least 3 trials were realized. The number of samples measured was 5. The impact strength of the unnotched samples was examined by the Charpy method (ISO 179) at 25 °C; the peak load was determined as the maximum force (Fmax). The Zwick/Roell HIT 25 P impact tester with a 5 J hammer was applied for the measurement. The number of samples measured was 10. The dynamic mechanical-thermal analysis (DMTA) was conducted in torsion mode by means of Anton Paar MCR 301 rheometer with a SRF measuring system. Investigations were carried out with a constant frequency of 1 Hz and a strain of 0.01%. The measurements were realized in a 30 °C–140 °C temperature range with a 2 °C/min temperature ramp. The number of samples measured was 3 for each series. The analysis of the structure of epoxy-based composites filled with fibers subjected to different chemical treatment was conducted using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by Zeiss Evo 40 apparatus. Prior to the tests, all specimens were sputtered with a layer of gold. During the analysis, the electron accelerating voltage of 12 kV was applied. Presented SEM images were taken with a magnification of 400× and 3000×."
6,Results and discussion,"In order to assess the effect of fiber modification, their spectroscopic analysis was carried out (Fig. 1 ). Natural fibers such as flax and cotton consist mainly of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and waxes [44]. Modification of the fibers allows them to be cleaned of impurities and waxes as well as to prevent moisture absorption. The advantage of the silanization process is creating chemical bonds with the structure of the fibers, which allows creating a coating that protects against moisture. On the other hand, the treatment of H2O2 fibers removes impurities and pectin and may result in the rough structure of the fibers, which favorably supports their adhesion to the epoxy matrix. All modified fibers showed lower absorbance in 3400 cm−1 the band compared to unmodified fibers. This is due to the reduction of the −OH peak intensity resulting from the breaking of hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the reduction of the number of OH groups may be resulted in due to the reactions that occurred during the two chemical treatments such as the condensation with the hydrolyzed 3-APS [45]. Furthermore, the peak intensity at 1650–1630 cm−1, which allows the moisture content of the fibers to be monitored, was lower for all modified fibers [46,47]. For silanized fibers, there is a visible change in the 1410 cm−1 band corresponding to the Si−CH2 peak. As a result of fabric modification by water solution peroxide for fibers sample LHOS, a reduction in peak intensity was observed at 2920 cm−1 from lignin and at 2850 cm−1 from CH2 symmetrical stretching of wax. Moreover, the chemical structure of epoxy resin reinforced with flax fiber of various types of modification was assessed by the FTIR method. The characteristic spectra of the composites are shown in Fig. 2 . The absorption band in the 3700−3200 cm−1 range corresponds to −OH groups in the epoxy material and hydrogen bonds from carbohydrates and lignin [48]. The result of the silanization of the fibers was not clearly visible on the composites’ spectra because the peaks characteristic of the silane groups coincides with the peaks derived from the epoxy matrix. However, it can be assumed that the increase in peak intensity for LHS and LHOS samples in the wavelength range 1000 cm−1–1200 cm−1 associated with the presence of Si–O–Si bond and 1410 cm−1 from SiCH2 bonds proved the presence of silanol group in composites. The characteristic bands for lignin present in flax fibers should be visible at 1314 cm−1 (OH bending) and 1248 cm−1 (CO stretching acetyl group) wavelengths [49]. In the case of composites reinforced with H2O2 modified fibers, the intensity of the peaks in this range is much lower than for other samples. This may confirm that the lignin content in LHO samples was lower than LHS and LH. In addition, following peaks from the epoxy matrix can be distinguished on the spectra: at 2800−3000 cm−1 from the −CH2 and −CH3 symmetric stretching band; at 1500−1600 cm−1 from the ArCCH stretching band; at 1150–1300 cm−1 from CCOC stretching band, at 1000−1100 cm−1 from COC stretching band and at 800−850 cm−1 from the aromatic ring. Table 1 summarizes the values ​​of measured color L*, a*, b* parameters together with the total color difference ΔE. In addition, the photo of the fabrics after modification is shown in Fig. 3 . The use of hydrogen peroxide caused intense discoloration of the natural fabrics. In the case of LHS sample, a ΔE value was in the range of 2 < ΔE < 3.5 defined as medium color variation, which may be recognized by an inexperienced observer. LHO and LHOS samples may be described as samples with large color variation in reference to LH unmodified fabric, according to ISO 2813 [50]. A similar effect of changing color after bleaching of kenaf fibers was observed by Razak et al. [35]. Fig. 4 shows the results of mechanical tests performed by the method of static tensile and bending for epoxy composites filled with flax and cotton fibers. The application of the fiber surface oxidation process resulted in a slight reduction in composite stiffness. This was observed for both measuring techniques realized in tensile and flexural geometry. In the case of composites containing silanized fibers, higher values ​​of the elasticity modulus determined in the bending test are observed, which may indicate an increase in adhesion between the fiber and the thermoset polymer matrix. In the case of the bending process of fabric-reinforced composites, improper adhesion between the filler and the polymer matrix has a more significant impact on the mechanical properties of materials than in the case of the tensile test. The application of surface modification of natural fibers caused a slight decrease in the mechanical strength assessed in the tensile test of composites compared to the reference sample. The observed phenomenon is probably the result of partial degradation of the mechanical structure of the natural fibers, the bleaching as well as silanization process. This phenomenon resulted directly in the limits of reinforcing the efficiency of the filler in the composite structure. For all composites containing modified fibers, an increase in flexural strength was noted, which is probably due to greater adhesion at the polymer-filler interface. The use of peroxide bleaching allows to remove the hemicellulose [41] and lignin [36] from the fiber, and as an effect of this treatment method, the increase of surface area occurs and facilitating the exposure of reactive hydroxyl groups on the fiber surface. Therefore, the fibers subjected to hydrogen peroxide bleaching before silanization enabling more effective interactions with 3-APS [41]. The rougher surface of the fibers without impurities and noncellulosic parts usually results also in better saturation of the fiber surface by polymer, leading to better physical adhesion in the interfacial region [51]. The elongation at break (εb) values are collectively presented in Table 1. Due to the type of the used polymeric matrix and long reinforcing fibers with the same wave, obtained results are comparable for all tested composite series. Fig. 5 summarizes the mean values ​​of the results of the Barcol hardness measurement for epoxy composites reinforced with natural fibers, which were subjected to various chemical treatment procedures. It can be observed that only in the case of the LHO composite containing fibers treated with hydrogen peroxide, the hardness is lower lowered in comparison to other tested materials. The LH, LHS and LHOS composites showed comparable Barcol hardness values, and the differences between the measured mean values ​​are negligible. The reduced hardness value in the case of the LHO composite may result from the increased amount of reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface of the fibers and their reaction with the amine groups contained in the hardener, which directly translated into the hardness of the epoxy matrix. The photographs of composites after drop test, their impact side and back side were presented in Fig. 6 . The increase in impact force increases the damaged area in the composites. The main defect area was visible around the point of impact for all materials tested. In the case of low impact force, i.e. 2 J, the smallest damage area was observed for LHS and LHO samples. In addition, these composites did not break completely compared to the reference sample. As a result of the application of a higher impact force, i.e. 3 J; 4 J, all tested laminates were damaged on both impact side and back side. This is mainly due to the small thickness of these three-layer composites. The results of the Charpy test are summarized in Table 2 . The impact strength of all tested composites was similar and averaged 9.5 kJ/m2, except for which this value was 10.9 kJ/m2 for LHS. The impact strength of fiber-reinforced composites is influenced by the type and properties of the fibers, as well as the polymer matrix resistance to cracking and adhesion between all components. However, changes in the maximum force value observed during the analysis were noted. For composites reinforced with fiber, which subjected two-step modification, the Fmax value was the highest. This may confirm the beneficial effect of the modification on the adhesion between the fiber and the epoxy matrix. The typical load-time curves of the tested composites are shown in Fig. 7 . Analysis of the shape of the curves suggests that the destruction mechanism was similar in all cases. Fig. 8 presents DMTA curves as a change in storage modulus (G') and damping factor (tanδ) vs. temperature (T). Moreover, detailed thermomechanical parameters, including glass transition temperature (Tg) measured as a peak of tanδ(T) curve as well as the difference between Tg of composites containing modified fibers, obtained based on DMTA are summarized in Table 3 . All DMTA curves showed a single-step drop of the storage modulus in a comparable temperature range, reflecting the glass transition of the epoxy matrix. As the measurement temperature increased, molecular chains segmental movement became easier and epoxy resin α-relaxation followed by a transition to rubbery and a sharp drop in measured storage modulus value [52]. Moreover, the lack of new inflections and increases of the G’ above the glass transition temperature, confirms properly realized curing process [53]. The LH and LHS curves do not differ from each other, both storage modulus and damping factor changes proceed similarly, and the change in value seems to be negligible. In the case of composite samples reinforced with H2O2 modified fibers, significant changes are observed in comparison to the LH reference material. Both the LHO and LHOS composites showed a decrease in the value of the storage module in the temperature range below Tg, more distinct in the case of LHOS composite. It should be emphasized that all materials were subjected to the post-curing process in the same time-temperature conditions, but in the case of the LHO composite, a significant increase in the glass transition temperature was noted. Moreover, tanδ vs. temperature curves of composites containing bleached fibrous fillers showed an extension of the glass-rubber transition. This phenomenon may be related to the effect of heterogeneity in the structure of the epoxy matrix [54]. It may be related to lower cross link-density of the epoxy matrix due to possible chemical interactions between epoxy monomer and amine groups placed on the surface of the filler after salinization with 3-APS. Usually, a higher glass transition temperature may be related to a higher cross-link density of the composites. However, the possibly increased amounts of the hydrogen bonds in the case of LHO sample caused probably reaction between amine curing agent and the fiber surface with improved reactivity. Additional chemical bonds between the polymeric matrix and a filler were created, and the change in curing kinetics of the epoxy resin occurred. Similarly, the effect of the curing behavior changes induced by the addition of surface-treated filler on the epoxy resin was observed in work [55]. Harsh and coworkers discuss the changes in epoxy resin curing kinetics as an effect of silane-treated SiO2 addition. However, the LHO sample reveals the highest tanδ value at the peak, which may be interpreted as improved damping behavior, which suggests looser crosslink in the epoxy bulk. Therefore, it can be supposed that increased molecular chain mobility of the lower cross-linked LHO sample allow samples with improved interfacial adhesion, resulting in improved stiffness in higher temperature range. The use of a two-stage modification ended with silanization resulted in a reduction of the mentioned effect, i.e., Tg decreased to a value comparable to the reference sample and reducing the local tanδ maximum. The brittleness (B) was calculated using the procedure described by Brostow et al. [56] according to the following formula: (2) B = 1/(Ɛb∙E’) where: Ɛb is the elongation at break determined in tensile test measurements, and E’ is the storage modulus determined by dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMTA) at a defined temperature and 1 Hz frequency. It should be stressed that brittleness is a versatile parameter describing the mechanical properties of materials using two different measuring techniques and a different type of load [57]. Therefore, B is associated with the ability to deform the material before breaking, and it is represented by Ɛb as well as E’ or G’, which is related to elasticity and fatigue properties measured in repetitive sinusoidal loading. In so far published studies, it was proved that multi-criteria brittleness evaluation might be applied for qualitative assessment of the composite properties [57–59]. The brittleness values are presented in Table 3. It can be seen that brittleness of all composites containing modified fibers showed higher values than the reference sample. The highest B value was noted for a material subjected to two-step modification. The increased brittleness of LHO composite suggests that both intensive changes in the fiber structure, as well as mentioned changes in the structure of the epoxy matrix, may result in increased brittleness. All of the considered materials exhibit brittle fracture at relatively low strain at break values, which according to the equation is essential (2); therefore, it can be stated that in case of structural materials reinforced with natural long fibers, each surface treatment providing to the reduction of εb and strongly effect calculated brittleness multi-criterial parameter. Figs. 9 and 10 show SEM images of brittle fractured epoxy composites reinforced with unmodified and modified flax/cotton fiber taken using different magnifications. In the case of unmodified composites, the most significant number of natural fibers pulled-out from the matrix can be observed, which is in line with the mechanical and thermomechanical tests carried out. Also, more number of flat and smooth planes at the fractured epoxy matrix surface was observed for the reference sample than for LHO and LHOS samples (Fig. 9) [60]. In the case of the LHOS sample, characterized by the highest interfacial adhesion evaluated indirectly in thermomechanical evaluation, we can observe that the fibers have cracked in the fracture plane, which confirms the effectiveness of the surface modification method used (Fig. 10). Moreover, the surface of the fibers subjected to bleaching (LHO) and both bleaching and silanization process (LHOS) was smoother in comparison to the LH and LHS samples, which is the result of removing the waxy material layers from the fiber surface [60]."
7,Conclusions,"The effectiveness of two fiber modification methods, such as bleaching in hydrogen peroxide, silanization and application of both treatments on thermomechanical properties of epoxy-based composites produced with them, was compared. The bleaching process changes the structure of the fibers and may reduce their pectin and impurities content. In turn, the silanization process creates new groups on the surface of the fibers, which can limit the mobility of the fiber segments and reduce the humidity of the fibers. Therefore, the combination of these two methods of flax/cotton fiber treatment has resulted in epoxy composites with favorable thermomechanical properties. Both improvements in tensile strength and flexural strength were observed for LHOS composites. It should be emphasized that also for these materials, the highest value of glass transition temperature and brittleness was noted. This confirms that the two-step method of modification of flax/cotton fabrics described in the paper, including treatment by hydrogen peroxide and amino silane, is an efficient way to improve the properties of layered structural composites."
