0,Introduction,"In recent years hydrogen production from hydrogen bearing molecules has been a topic of growing research interest for its potential application in fuel cells [1,2]. Hydrogen can be obtained from several sources such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas, liquid propane, and gasified coal. In biomass technologies, bio-ethanol represents the most attractive feedstock because of its relatively high hydrogen content, availability, non-toxicity, and storage and handling safety. In the last few years research in the catalytic generation of hydrogen from ethanol has received much attention and many papers have been published on new catalytic reaction pathways such as steam reforming (SR) [3–8], partial oxidation (POX) [9–12], and auto-thermal reforming (ATR) [13–16] to produce hydrogen from light alcohols. In particular, many papers have been reported on the performances of noble metals during ethanol reforming to produce hydrogen [17–25] through catalytic reforming. The strong endothermicity of this process, however, requires external energy supply to sustain the reaction, which along with the difficulties of development of long-term stable coke resistant catalysts have led to the search for other reforming processes. The exothermic nature of the ethanol partial oxidation reaction looks as a reasonable alternative process for hydrogen production. In this paper, we report results of an investigation of catalysts for ethanol reforming on non-noble metal catalysts. As reported in the literature [26–31] copper based catalysts have been investigated to produce H2 from ethanol. The oxidative reforming reaction produces a wide range of liquid and gaseous products such as H2, CO, CO2, CH4, CH3CHO, CH3COOH, C2H5OC2H5 and catalysts selectivity is a key indicator of catalytic performance. Studies of nickel based catalysts have also been reported in the literature, and although these catalysts have shown high activity, they tend to deactivate due to coke formation [32–35]. The aim of this work is to investigate the use of ZnO and chromia promoters to reduce coke formation and to improve the catalyst activity and hydrogen selectivity. Specifically, we studied the catalytic generation of hydrogen by partial oxidation and decomposition of ethanol over a series of copper-zinc and Cu-chromite catalysts unsupported or supported on alumina prepared by combustion synthesis which can lead to higher surface areas than classical co-precipitation methods. To synthesize nano-size powders with a relatively high surface area, solution combustion synthesis (CS) has been developed [36–38]. In CS method a reactive solution containing the desired catalyst components precursors is prepared by combining an organic fuel, such as glycine, with metal nitrates in their appropriate stoichiometric ratios in a homogeneous aqueous solution. The solution is heated to evaporate excess water, yielding a viscous liquid. Further heating caused the precursor liquid to auto-ignite and results in a self-propagating combustion front. This process is characterized by a fast heating rate (up to 106K/s) and short reaction time (10−3 to 10s). It is also an energy efficient method since the heat of reaction provides the energy required for the material synthesis with reaction temperatures reaching up to 1100–1450°C in very exothermic reactions [39]. The main advantage of this technique is the production of powders with uniform composition, lower residual carbon levels, and smaller particle sizes. The following stoichiometric reaction takes place during the combustion process to yield the metal oxide: (1) M υ ( NO 3 ) υ + 5 9 υ φ NH 2 CH 2 COOH + 5 4 υ ( φ − 1 ) O 2 → M O υ / 2 + 10 9 υ φ CO 2 + 25 18 υ φ H 2 O + 5 φ + 9 18 υ N 2 The ratio between the fuel and oxidizer is expressed by φ, where with φ =1, φ >1, φ <1 indicated a stoichiometric ratio, fuel rich, and fuel lean conditions, respectively. In this study, the copper-chromia based catalysts have been prepared by combustion synthesis by varying the fuel to oxidizer ratio (φ)⋅ The hypothesis of this work is that the CS method will yield more active and selective catalysts based on the potential compositional uniformity of the powders and their larger surface area. The specific objective of this study is to investigate the effect of composition, promoters, and preparative variables on the activity and selectivity of these catalysts during decomposition and the partial oxidation of ethanol under various O2 and C2H5OH ratios (O2:EtOH=0.6–1.5). The results showed that the copper chromite based catalyst is active and selective for ethanol decomposition and oxidative reforming and shows improved resistance to deactivation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts synthesis,"2.1 Catalysts synthesis Three different unsupported copper-chromia catalysts were prepared by combustion synthesis using different fuel to oxidizer ratios (φ). In addition to these un-supported copper-chromia catalysts, a copper-chromia supported on commercial activated gamma alumina and a copper-zinc oxide-alumina catalyst were prepared by impregnating first the porous supports with the reactive solution, then igniting the impregnated powders. The CS of glycine/nitrate solution to yield the copper chromite powders consisted of the following steps. Reagent grade metal nitrates M υ (NO3) υ ·χH2O (M =Cu, Zn, Cr) (Sigma–Aldrich) and glycine (CH5NO2), used as fuel, were dissolved in water. The solution prepared in a beaker, was placed in a hot plate under a hood, and then heated slowly to evaporate excess water, which resulted in a viscous liquid layer. At a certain temperature, the viscous layer self-ignited and underwent self-sustained combustion, producing the solid oxide product. Three different copper chromite catalysts (Cu–Cr=50:50wt%) were prepared by combustion synthesis of a mixture of copper and chromium nitrates in the presence of glycine, using three different fuel oxidizer ratios of φ =0.5 (CuCr-0.5), φ =0.8 (CuCr-0.8) and φ =3 (CuCr-3). The copper chromite supported on alumina (CuO-Cr2O3:Al2O3 =60:20wt%), indicated with the acronym CuCr/Al, was prepared in two different steps: a porous alumina powder (Sigma–Aldrich Brockmann I, standard grade-150 mesh) was at first impregnated with an aqueous mixture of copper nitrate, chromia nitrate and glycine as fuel (φ =0.8). The impregnated alumina was then heated to initiate the combustion reaction that occurred vigorously inside the pore structure of the alumina support. A similar procedure was employed to prepare the catalyst Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 (40:40:20wt%), denoted as CuZn/Al in this case the porous alumina powder was impregnated with an aqueous solution of copper nitrate, zinc nitrate and glycine (φ =0.8). The prepared catalysts were first pressed to 35MPa to form a pellet that was subsequently broken into powders made of small agglomerates, which were sieved to 0.6–1mm particle sizes. The sieved powders were loaded in the reactor and pre-reduced for 2h in pure hydrogen flow of 50cm3/min, keeping constant the temperature at 300°C. Table 1 summarizes the composition of the catalysts studied in this work."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Ex situ characterization methods such as BET, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out as well as in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) and in situ X-ray adsorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). Ex situ techniques are rather standard so only the equipment used is specified below, with more detail devoted to describe the in situ methods used."
4,Ex situ characterization,"2.3 Ex situ characterization BET surface area measurements were carried out in a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 Instrument using nitrogen as the adsorbent gas. Catalyst particles were first outgassed at 473K until the differential pressure fell below 20mmHg/min. The weight of the outgassed sample was precisely measured before calculating the specific surface area. No other pretreatments were carried out prior to BET area measurements. XRD was conducted in a Bruker powders diffractometer. The scans were collected in the range 5–80° (2θ) at a rate of 0.01° (2θ)/s, using Cu Kα radiation The X-ray tube operated at 10kV and 50mA. XPS measurements were carried out in a Kratos XSAM-800 spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source operating at 1486.6eV and a 90° take-off angle for near surface analysis of O 1s, Al 2p, Cr 3d and Cu 2p electronic transitions. Powder catalyst's samples adhered to brass mounts with double-sided carbon tape, were loaded into the analysis chamber. Samples were left to degas for overnight while the vacuum system maintained a pressure less than 1×10−8 Torr. Binding energy values were referenced to the C 1s peak (284.8eV) that resulted from the adventitious contamination layer. The spectra were analyzed using the Casa XPS software package with relative sensitivity factors obtained from the Kratos library. The microstructures of the used catalysts powders were imaged and analyzed using a FIE Field-Emission SEM (Magellean)."
5,In situ characterization,"2.4 In situ characterization XANES measurements using X-ray absorption spectroscopy were carried out at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The measurements were made in transmission mode with ionization chambers optimized for the maximum current with linear response (∼1010 photons detected/s). A cryogenically cooled double-crystal Si (111) monochromator with resolution (ΔE) better than 2.5eV at 8.979 keV (Cu K edge) was used in conjunction with a Rh-coated mirror to minimize the presence of harmonics. The integration time per data point was 1–3s, and three scans were obtained for each processing condition. Standard procedures based on WINXAS97 software were used to extract the XANES. Oxidation states were inferred from XANES data obtained for the following reference compounds: CuO and Cu2O for Cu–O and Cu foil for Cu–Cu while Cr2O3 and CrO3 for Cr–O and Cr foil for Cr–Cr. The sample was pressed into a cylindrical holder with a thickness chosen to give an absorbance (Δμx) of about 1.0 in the Cu edge region. Due to the high density of the Cu based catalysts; the fresh powder was diluted by a factor of 10 with fumed silica prior to being pressed into a wafer. The sample holder was centered in a continuous-flow reactor tube 18in. long and 0.75in. diameter. Fittings at both ends of the tube were covered with polyimide windows, to allow transmission of the X-ray beam, and with gas valves fitted perpendicular to the tube. In addition there were inlets for 2K thermocouples one touching the holder and the other in the bulk of the gas near the holder. The reactor was placed into an electrical furnace, which was controlled and monitored with two thermocouples located inside the reactor tube and one in the furnace assembly. The reactor, with the windows and valve configuration allowed isolation of the reactor from the atmosphere and the ability to flow various reducing, reactant, and oxidizing gas mixtures at elevated temperatures, all while being probed by the X-ray beam, meaning that the catalyst could be monitored under in situ (no reaction) or under operando conditions (with reaction). Spectrum was first recorded with the catalyst in its untreated state at room temperature (in air), thereafter the samples were reduced by heating in pure H2 to a temperature of 300°C and kept at that value for 1h, then cooled to room temperature for XAS scanning. For reaction studies under ethanol decomposition reaction conditions, the temperature was set to the desired value and under a flow of a reaction mixture of 2.2cm3/min of CH3CH2OH in He over the catalyst for 30min. After that, the XANES spectrum was recorded with the aim of evaluating the variation of the oxidation state in air, after reduction, and during the reaction. In each mentioned cases, the scanning was realized at room temperature. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of ethanol on copper based catalysts was obtained in a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer equipped with a DTSG detector and a moving interferometer with a scanner velocity of 2–30kHz, a Mid-IR source and a beam splitter. A weighted quantity of catalyst powder was mixed with fumed silica to reduce the absorption of IR radiation by the black powder characteristic of our samples. The diluted sample was placed in a DRIFT-cell-reactor (Harrick) equipped with CaF2 windows and thermostated heaters, and connected to heated inlets and outlet lines to allow ethanol/He flow into the cell. The samples were pre-treated in situ by heating under helium flow (25cm3/min), then reduced at 300°C in a flow of 20% H2 in He for about 1h. The cell was then rapidly cooled to a preset temperature and ethanol flow was introduced in the cell and contacted with the pretreated sample at three different temperatures 100, 200, 300°C and at atmospheric pressure. Each spectrum was obtained by co-adding 128 scans in the range 4000–370cm−1 frequency range at a resolution of 4cm−1."
6,Activity measurements,"2.5 Activity measurements The partial oxidation of ethanol was conducted in a continuous packed bed quartz tubular reactor of 50cm length, and 10.5mm ID, electrically heated and equipped with temperature and electronic flow controllers. The reactor was charged with 0.4g of the sieved agglomerates (0.6–1mm) fresh catalysts powders The catalyst was reduced in hydrogen flow of about 50cm3/min by heating the bed from room temperature to 300°C at a rate of 4.5°C/min, then holding at 300°C for about 1h. Then the hydrogen flow was switched to a nitrogen flow, of about 38cm3/min, to purge the system from traces of hydrogen as the reactor was cooled to room temperature. Nitrogen was then passed through a bubbler containing ethanol, resulting in a total ethanol flow of about 2.2cm3/min. Oxygen was then added to the ethanol reactant stream to obtain ratios of O2:EtOH=0.6–1.5. The reaction products were analyzed on line by a gas-chromatograph (HP-5890) equipped with two packed columns connected in parallel: a 3.7m Hayesep Q connected to a FID detector for the detection of ethanol, acetaldehyde, methane, carbon dioxide, methane, and a 5m Hayesep DB column connected to a thermo-conductivity detector (TCD) to detect nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide. The carrier gas employed is argon at an inlet pressure of about 60psi. After reduction, and introduction of methanol and oxygen at room temperature, the reaction was conducted by heating the catalytic bed from room temperature to 500°C in about 4h. The conversion and the hydrogen selectivity were calculated as follows: (2) X EtOH = F EtOH in − F EtOH out F EtOH in (3) S H 2 = F H 2 produced 3 ( F EtoOH in − F EtOH out ) The selectivity to acetaldehyde, methane, ethylene, CO and CO2 was determined on the basis of a carbon balance for each component, as follows: (4) S i = mols product i formed n EtOH reacted × n C i n C EtoH = n C i A c i n C EtOH A c EtOH 1 − x EtOH x EtOH where nC i and nCEtOH represent the numbers of carbon atoms in the component i and in the ethanol feed respectively, while Ac i and Ac EtOH are the normalized chromatographic peaks areas. x EtOH represents the conversion while S H 2 represents the hydrogen selectivity. F EtOHin and F EtOHout are the molar flow rates of the ethanol at the inlet and at the outlet of the reactor, respectively. The other main co-products observed during the gas-chromatographic analysis are: water, acetaldehyde and ethylene."

8,Ex situ characterizations,"3.1 Ex situ characterizations The name, composition, glycine/O2 ratio and the BET area of the catalysts prepared by combustion synthesis are summarized in Table 1. In a first phase of this research, different copper-chromia catalysts were prepared by using different glycine/oxidizer ratios (φ). As reported in Table 1 the copper chromite supported on alumina CuCr/Al, prepared by impregnation of copper chromite on alumina and combusted, has the highest surface area, of about 127m2/g, respect to the other prepared catalysts. Copper-chromite (Cu-Cr) catalysts prepared with a φ >1 ratio exhibited a lower surface area possibly due to sintering occurring at high temperature during the combustion synthesis process. The surface area of CuZn/Al, of about 81m2/g, is lower than the CuCr/Al catalyst. This effect is probably due to the effect of the formation of ZnO that probably has a detrimental effect on the overall specific surface area. Fig. 1 shows the XRD diffraction patterns of all the fresh catalysts in oxidized form. The CuCr/Al, CuCr-0.5 and CuCr-0.8 catalysts show several broad diffraction peaks. The peaks at 2θ =33, 36.5° and 41.1 correspond to the cubic spinel CuCrO4 (PDF 34-0507) and CuCr2O4 (PDF 26-0509). The presence of metallic copper Cu in the specie CuCr-3 has been detected and the corresponding peak is located at 2θ =43° (PDF 04-0836). The specie CuO, present in each studied catalysts and in the CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts (not shown), is identified at 2θ =35.6-38 (PDF 48-1548, PDF 65-2309). The peak located at 2θ =42.5°, in the case of CuCrAl, is attributed to Cu2O (PDF 34-1354). Finally at 2θ =69° a characteristic diffraction peak of γ-alumina has been individuated (PDF 04-0880). In the case of Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst, a ZnO phase at 2θ =37° and a spinel of ZnAlO4 at 2θ =32° appears in addition of the CuCr2O4 peaks. Chromia diffraction peaks are located at 2θ =25°, 34°, 38°, 55° [40,41]. As shown in Fig. 1, the diffraction patterns appear broadening that increase with decreasing φ indicative of smaller copper chromite particles size. In particular, CuCr-3.0 shows very well defined diffraction peaks that correspond to the several phases formed after the combustion synthesis at high temperature such as CuO, Cu, Cr2O3, CuCr2O4. The presence of the diffraction peaks attributed to metallic copper on CuCr-3.0, indicates that the catalyst is partially reduced during CS, due to the large value of φ used (φ =3), which results in reduced metal nanoparticles [42]. The sharper peaks on this catalyst are due to sintering occurring at both higher fuel/oxidizer ratio and higher temperatures. By decreasing the fuel to oxidizer ratio from φ =3 to φ =0.8 and finally to φ =0.5 in CuCr catalysts, the combustion reaction is less complete, as a consequence, very large diffraction peaks have been detected confirming the formation of very small dispersed crystallites. In the case of CuCr/Al, broadening is more pronounced due to the higher dispersion of the copper chromite phases on the alumina support. SEM micrographs of the CuCr-0.8, CuCr/Al and CuZn/Al catalysts are shown in Fig. 2A–C respectively. Fig. 2A, displays unsupported CuCr-0.8, showing individual particles of copper chromite of about 200nm. The supported CuCr/Al catalyst (Fig. 2B,) exhibits small particles, presumably of copper chromite, of varying sizes and shapes dispersed on the alumina support in agreement with the XRD and BET results. CuZn/Al (Fig. 2C) shows well defined larger particles supported on alumina although due to the complexities of the various phases present in this case is not clear what phases are displayed in this micrograph. The surface composition, of CuCr-0.5, CuCr-0.8, CuCr-3 and CuZn/Al and CuCr/Al of the fresh catalysts, was studied by XPS. The spectra for Cu and Cr 2p 3/2 photoelectrons are shown in Fig. 3A and B respectively, with the surface composition of the selected as prepared fresh catalysts summarized in Table 2 in terms of the relative % of the various elements present. Fig. 3A shows that CuZn/Al, CuCr-0.8 and CuCr-3.0 exhibit distinct peaks at 933.6eV that correspond to the Cu2+ as in CuO, indicating that the catalyst is in a fully oxidized state. The CuCr-0.5 and CuCr/Al catalysts exhibit a Cu 2p electron binding energy signal at 932.2–932.8eV that was generally attributed to Cu+ located in an octahedral and tetrahedral sites of CuCr2O4 [43]. Moreover, the catalysts CuCr-0.8 and CuCr-3.0 show a Cu satellite peak at 932.2–932.8eV, that corresponds to Cu+. These results show that on the fresh catalytic systems, CuCr-0.8 and CuCr-3.0 a mixture of two oxidation states appears to be present. The binding energy of Cr 2p3/2 transitions of all the catalysts is in the range 576.58–578.7eV attributed to the Cr3+ in Cr2O3 compounds (Fig. 3B), in good agreement with studies by Brooks et al. (577.0eV) [44]. Moreover, Fig. 3B shows a small variation in binding energy of Cr in CuCr-0.5 and CuCr-0.8, with a shoulder at higher binding energy overlapping the main peak (ca. 580eV for Cr 2p3/2) which can be attributed to the Cr6+ present in the specie CuCrO4 [45]. The accepted Zn 2p3/2 electron binding energy for oxidized zinc has been reported near 1021.4eV, which was also observed in ZnO containing catalyst. The main result from these near surface sensitive experiments is that the surfaces have different compositions than the bulk phases detected by XRD. This could occur from several structures, such as one metallic phase or an oxide forming a surface layer on top of copper chromite crystals, for example."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity 3.2.1 Ethanol decomposition According to the literature, the partial oxidation reactions are catalyzed by metals of groups 8–10 of the periodic table, and in particular by nickel, preferred for industrial applications [46]. Early studies on ethanol partial oxidation, however, were carried out over copper-based catalysts [47]. Copper is active and selective to produce mainly acetaldehyde and hydrogen from ethanol, but promoters and supports are necessary to prevent both metal sintering and fouling the surface due to the acetaldehyde adsorption and coke formation. Copper, initially present in the fresh catalysts as oxide, was reduced to metal in a flow of hydrogen for about 3h at 300°C prior to reaction. At first, the best φ ratio necessary to obtain the most active and selective catalyst was identified. Fig. 4A shows the ethanol conversion versus the temperature profiles for CuCr-0.5, CuCr-0.8 and CuCr-3 catalysts, with the corresponding selectivity shown in Fig. 4B. The above experiments were performed in a constant flow of ethanol (2.2cm3/min) diluted in 38cm3/min of nitrogen at atmospheric pressure, by increasing the temperature in the 50–500°C range. In Fig. 4A the conversion for each catalyst at different temperatures is displayed showing that all catalysts exhibit conversions of about 95–100% at high temperatures (450–500°C). At an intermediate temperature of about 250°C the conversion is about 77–80% for CuCr-0.5 and CuCr-0.8 catalysts, but it is only 10% for CuCr-3.0 indicating that increasing φ, results in a lower conversion at intermediate temperatures. The hydrogen selectivity, defined as the ratio of the amount of hydrogen produced to the total amount of hydrogen that can be produced from the reacted ethanol, is different among the three catalysts, as it can be appreciated in Fig. 4B. Up to 100°C hydrogen selectivity is low, due to the formation of CO x and water. As temperature increases, H2 selectivity increases and at 300°C the selectivity ranks as follows: CuCr-0.8 (40%)>CuCr-3.0 (27%) whereas the CuCr-0.5 is nearly unselective for H2 producing mainly acetaldehyde (S AcH =85–90% at 200< T <300°C), as shown in Fig. 4C, along with water, CO x and methane. Methane selectivity at temperature higher than 300°C is of about 27–30% while CO, with a hydrogen selectivity of 23–26%, is formed from acetaldehyde decomposition. Acetaldehyde selectivity, defined on the carbon basis, is about 25–30% for CuCr-3 in the temperature range of 200–300°C. In the same temperature range the acetaldehyde selectivity of CuCr-0.8 is almost the same as CuCr-3 (22–25%). For each catalyst CuCr-0.5, CuCr-0.8 and CuCr-3.0, the acetaldehyde selectivity reaches a maximum and then decreases as temperature increases. At temperatures higher than 300°C, H2 selectivity levels off at about 47% for CuCr-0.8 and 33% for CuCr-3.0 and remains low for CuCr-0.5. The results, in Fig. 4, indicate that the optimum value of φ is 0.8, which was used in subsequent preparations. Several studies have shown good activity for CuO-ZnO and CuCr2O4 catalysts in the ethanol steam reforming reaction [48,49]. The effect of zinc oxide was studied supported on alumina (Fig. 5 ) and found that at 300°C the conversion is about 92% for the supported Zn promoted catalysts CuZn/Al and slightly lower (∼80%) for the supported CuCr/Al catalyst (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows that at 300°C, hydrogen selectivity is higher for the supported CuCr/Al catalysts (48%) while it is about 30% on CuZn/Al. At 500°C, the hydrogen selectivity of the two catalysts is almost the same (40%). As shown in Fig. 4B, the unsupported copper chromite CuCr-O.8 catalyst, has hydrogen selectivity of about 40%, whereas the CuCr-0.5 catalyst exhibits no hydrogen selectivity in the whole temperature range. These results show that Zn promotion while yielding higher selectivity than on CuCr-0.5 is not as effective as Cr promotion on CuCr-0.8, but at high temperature, the CuZn/Al catalyst has as good activity and selectivity than the CuCr-0.8 catalyst. Fig. 5C shows the selectivity to acetaldehyde, the main co-product of reaction, for each of the CuCr-0.8 and CuZn/Al catalysts. Both show a maximum of acetaldehyde selectivity of 70% at 250°C. At temperatures higher than 400°C the main reaction products are CO and CH4 formed from acetaldehyde decomposition. The deactivation resistance of the supported CuCr/Al catalyst was studied as a function of time on stream (Fig. 6). The conversion–temperature profile of the catalyst after used at different time on stream is shown in Fig. 6A. At 300°C, the conversion of the fresh catalysts (R1) and reactor used (R2: after 25h TOS) decreased from 80% to about 51%. After regeneration of the catalyst in oxygen followed by the hydrogen reduction the activity was recovered to about the same value as the fresh catalyst (R3). The selectivities at 300°C (Fig. 6B), however, were about the same for the three cases shown in Fig. 6 . The activity decrease after 25h of operation is due to the formation of coke from the partially dehydrogenated intermediates involved in the decomposition reaction. The results on CuCr/Al are quite different than our previous results on Cu-Ni-Fe promoted multi-component catalysts [42], which show a significant decrease in H2 selectivity with TOS during ethanol decomposition. On CuCr based catalysts, the H2 selectivity remains constant after 25h of TOS which indicates that the sites involved on adsorption of ethanol are altered by coke formation but the concentration of the intermediates leading to their decomposition is not altered during the time on stream studied. The partial oxidation of ethanol previously studied in the above mentioned Cu-Ni-Fe catalysts [42] has the advantage of being exothermic as opposed to the endothermic ethanol decomposition reaction, which requires an additional energy source to sustain the reaction. 3.2.2 Ethanol partial oxidation The use of oxygen, at concentrations lower than the stoichiometric value, decreases the energy requirements and potentially can keep clean the catalyst surface from coke deposition. For this purpose the performances of CuZn/Al, CuCr/Al and CuCr-0.8 was investigated in the 50–500°C temperature range, by using the same amount of catalyst and a mixture of ethanol and oxygen (2.2cm3/min), diluted in 38cm3/min of nitrogen, corresponding to a molar ratio of O2/EtOH=0.6. The results obtained in terms of ethanol conversion, hydrogen and acetaldehyde selectivity vs temperature for these catalysts are reported in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7A shows that at 300°C, CuCr-0.8 exhibits about 96% conversion while both supported CuCr/Al and CuZn/Al have conversions of about 68–70%. H2 selectivity (Fig. 7B) shows that until 200°C, no hydrogen is produced and the main products of reaction are CO2 and water. At 300°C CuZn/Al has a H2 selectivity of 35% versus the 28% obtained for CuCr/Al, whereas CuCr-0.8 has a H2 selectivity of only 10%, indicating that in the presence of oxygen, the reaction pathway on this catalyst favors the total oxidation of ethanol to CO2 and water. At temperature higher than 300°C, the H2 selectivity of CuZn/Al is nearly constant in the 30–35% and 25–28%, for CuCr/Al. It follows that in the presence of oxygen, Zn promotion does not increase that total oxidation of the intermediates leading to CO2 and water, but rather this catalyst, retains sites selective for partial oxidation. Fig. 7C shows the selectivity to acetaldehyde with CuCr-0.8 exhibiting a maximum selectivity to acetaldehyde (95%) at 200°C, which remains in the range 70–80% until 400°C, and then decreases to about 40% at higher temperatures. CuCr/Al reaches a maximum acetaldehyde selectivity of about 65% and then decreases continuously to 40% as temperature increases. CuZn/Al acetaldehyde selectivity reaches a maximum of about 90% at 330°C then decreases to a few % at 500°C due to acetaldehyde decomposition to CO2 and CH4. Further increase of the oxygen concentration to O2/EtOH=1.5 decreases the selectivity for all catalysts even further (not shown) favoring the combustion of hydrogen to water. It follows that the use of a low amount of oxygen O2:EtOH=0.6 should be a good compromise to obtain high activity, decrease catalysts deactivation, and maintain hydrogen selectivity with TOS. The selectivity to hydrogen of (40%) obtained on the three catalysts studied is comparable with the ones obtained for noble metals in the partial oxidation reaction [38,50,51]. The stoichiometric equations of ethanol partial oxidation to hydrogen and the corresponding heats of reaction have been reported are as follows: (5) C2H5OH+0.5O2 →2CO+3H2,ΔH 298°=14.1kJ/mol (6) C2H5OH+3/2O2 →2CO2 +3H2,ΔH 298°=−554.0kJ/mol The above values of ΔH r indicate that by using a small concentration of oxygen it is possible to operate under self-thermal-balanced conditions [51]."
10,In situ characterization,"3.3 In situ characterization Fig. 8A–C shows the in situ DRIFT of ethanol flowing at 2.2cm3/min diluted in nitrogen flow of about 25cm3/min at 100, 200 and 300°C CuCr-3, CuZn/Al and CuCr/Al respectively. The spectra of CuCr-0.5 and CuCr-0.8 even though diluted with fumed silica, exhibit very weak bands difficult to identify due to the low reflectance and high absorption of infrared radiation by the black catalyst powder and hence are not shown. In Fig. 8B and C the spectra is sharper due to the better reflectance provided by the alumina support on CuZn/Al and CuCr/Al. The DRIFT spectra shown in Fig. 8 presented in terms of absorbance units, exhibit a combination of (i) negative peaks and (ii) positive peaks, indicating the disappearance and formation of species as reported by literature results [52]. Most of the observed bands have been assigned on the basis of literature data [52–55]. Blank DRIFT spectra have also been made on the fumed SiO2 used as diluents, at the three different adsorption temperature (100, 2000, 300°C). The spectra in all cases were completely flat. Therefore we can conclude that registered DRIFT spectra reported in Fig. 8 showing weak bands are mainly due to the examined catalysts. The spectra on CuCr-3, CuZn/Al and CuCr/Al show a barely distinguished negative band at 3750cm−1 indicative that the adsorption of ethanol on the catalysts, forming ethoxy species [53]. The broad band from 3600 to 3100cm−1 (νOH) has been assigned to the molecular ethanol loosely adsorbed on the catalysts [50]. The adsorption peak at 1400–1380cm−1 and 1590–1555cm−1 have been attributed to ν sym(COO) and ν assym(COO) ester species (ethylacetate) respectively [54,55]. The adsorption band at 1716–1757cm−1, observed in each spectrum, can be ascribed to νCO vibration of acetaldehyde species (h1 CH3CHO) [56], indicating that further dehydrogenation of ethoxy to acetaldehyde takes place on the catalysts surface. On CuZn/Al this effect is strongly affected by the temperature while on CuCr-3 and CuCr/Al the presence of acetaldehyde adsorbed occurs at relatively low temperature (100°C). The spectrum in Fig. 8A shows a different band, at a wavenumber of about 1750cm−1 related to the formation of acetaldehyde species. Fig. 8C, for CuCr/Al, shows at 300°C, bands due to the formation of surface acetate species υ sym(COO) at 1550cm−1 and characteristic υ(CO) bands corresponding to mono- (υ(CO)=1096cm−1) and bidentate (υ(CO)=1055cm−1) ethoxy species [57–59]. In addition to identification of surface ethoxy species [60], bands at 2800–3000cm−1 corresponding to the CH3 and/or C2H5 groups are also present. In summary, the FTIR results indicates the presence of species which indicates that the ethanol decomposition reaction pathway proceeds through the formation of ethoxy species which dehydrogenate to acetaldehyde and which further decomposes to CO2 and H2, consistent with the selectivity results in Figs. 4–6. Further investigation of the oxidation state under reaction conditions was carried out by in situ and operando XANES. Fig. 9A and B shows the Cu edge XANES spectra of the three different Cu standards: Cu0, Cu+ and Cu2+ and of CuCr-0.5 respectively. Comparison between them permits one to observe the variation of oxidation state of the copper during reduction and ethanol decomposition. As it can be seen, in the CuCr-0.5 catalyst, Cu has initially an oxidation state of Cu2+ in the fresh catalyst exposed to air. After reduction, ethanol decomposition and subsequent exposure to air, the oxidation state of CuCr-0.5 is mainly Cu0. Fig. 9C shows the Cu edge XANES spectra of a CuCr-0.8 catalyst after the reduction and sub sequentially exposure to air. In this case the spectra after reduction and sub sequent exposure of the catalyst to air, do not fit the spectra of either the reduced or oxidized standards indicating that the oxidation state of copper is a mixture of Cu0/Cu1+. CuCr-0.8 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performances during ethanol decomposition and the mixture of two-oxidation state is typically present in the active copper-chromite catalyst and could represent the active phase in the ethanol decomposition reaction. The CuCr/Al catalyst, Fig. 9D, shows a Cu edge XANES profile similar to the ones obtained for the CuCr-0.5 catalyst, i.e. mainly oxidized in the fresh catalyst in air and mainly reduced after reduction, reaction and subsequent exposure to air. The Cu XANES spectrum of CuZn/Al catalyst (not shown) is basically the same as CuCr/Al and CuCr-0.5 showing no major effect of ZnO on the oxidation state of Cu. The Cr edge shows that it is always in Cr3+ oxidation state regardless of the pretreatment and reaction environment."
11,Discussion,"The results presented have shown that the preparation of the catalysts and the reaction environment affects their textural and compositional properties as confirmed by the several ex situ and in situ realized characterizations. This study also demonstrated the effect of the use of different promoters such as ZnO and CuCr2O4/Cr2O3 to increase both the selectivity to hydrogen and the resistance of the active phase to sintering. Moreover, the use of Al2O3 as support favored the increase of the overall surface area and thus presumably the catalyst activity. Ex situ XRD in air shows the presence of several oxide phases including copper chromite, CuO, ZnO and Cr2O3 depending on the fuel/oxidizer and support used. The BET area of the unsupported catalysts varies with the fuel/oxidizer ratio increasing as φ decreases. The highest BET area is obtained in the supported catalyst prepared by impregnation in a high area alumina as in case of CuZn/Al and CuCr/Al. All the catalysts are active for ethanol decomposition at T >250°C, with CuCr-3 the less active, but their selectivity varies with the fuel to oxidizer and the presence of Zn. The unsupported CuCr-0.8 and the supported version CuCr/Al are the most active and selective catalysts. The supported CuCr/Al catalyst, while it deactivates with TOS it maintains its selectivity in a 25h TOS run. The activity can be recovered by re-reduction. Acetaldehyde selectivity reached about 70% at temperature higher than 250°C. This result suggests that at low temperatures the copper based catalysts have the ability to dehydrogenate ethanol without splitting the CC bond, which would lead to the undesirable decomposition of acetaldehyde to CH4 and CO. During ethanol partial oxidation, i.e. in the presence of oxygen, at reaction temperatures lower than 300°C, a maximum acetaldehyde selectivity of 90% can be reached. The use of small amount of oxygen thermodynamically favors the formation of acetaldehyde at lowest temperature and limits coke deposition. At low oxygen content, O2/ETOH=0.6 the most active and selective catalyst is CuZn/Al. The use of in situ characterization has been useful to understand the main behavior of the catalyst during reaction. In situ FTIR shows mainly the presence of several species related to the products detected namely OH−, COO−, CO and CO2 as well as CH3 and C2H2 species. In situ XANES, contrary to ex situ results, indicate that there is a significant difference in oxidation state between the fresh samples and those reduced before, during, and after reaction. The CuCr-0.8 catalyst shows the presence of a mixed C0/Cu1+ phase, whereas the other catalysts show mainly the presence of Cu0 . The stoichiometric reactions involved in ethanol decomposition and the corresponding heats of reaction are as follows: (7) CH3CH2OH(g)→CH3CHO(g)+H2,ΔH =+68.1Kcal/mol (8) CH3CH2OH(g)→C2H4 (g)+H2O,ΔH =+45Kcal/mol (9) CH3CH2OH(g)→1/2CO2 +3/2CH4,ΔH =−74Kcal/mol (10) CH3CH2OH(g)→CO+H2,ΔH =+49Kcal/mol In addition, ethanol and acetaldehyde can undergo further oxidation and decomposition by gas phase or adsorbed oxygen to yield CO2 and water. Methane and CO formation at temperature higher than 300°C and CO is due to acetaldehyde decomposition, in agreement with the work of Luengo et al. [61]. Reactions leading to carbon formation also occur, especially at high temperature. Most of the above products are seen in the gas phase and some as adsorbed species by FTIR, suggesting a reaction pathway involving the formation of partially dehydrogenated intermediates and the breaking of different bonds such as CC, COO, COH and CH bonds requiring different type of sites. There are multiple phases in these catalysts involving several oxidation states so more than one site could be involved in yielding a given product. This is a complex reaction network involving multiple sites that would require detailed kinetic evaluation in each phase to correlate quantitatively activity and selectivity to active sites and material properties. Each of the various characterization methods utilized requires different conditions, like the ex situ XRD versus the more complicated in situ XAS experiments. Each method probes different properties and material volumes giving different results and it is incorrect to extrapolate results obtained with one technique in a certain environment (i.e. ex situ) to another (i.e. in situ) so only qualitative conclusions can be reached. The activity–selectivity of the CuCr-3.0 appears to correlate with the larger crystallite sizes in this catalyst as detected by XRD, SEM, and its low BET area. The presence of Cr2O3 in this catalyst is also consistent with studied showing high decarbonylation activity [45,62,63] on chromia. The excess fuel used in the preparation of CuCr-3.0 led to temperature increases during combustion synthesis that resulted in larger crystallites with fewer selective active sites for ethanol adsorption-formation of ethoxy and acetaldehyde intermediates followed by dehydrogenation. On the opposite side of the activity–selectivity results are those of CuCr-0.5 catalyst, which although active, has low hydrogen selectivity but instead high acetaldehyde selectivity and the highest surface area among the unsupported catalysts. In this case, in situ XANES shows that a reduced Cu phase is present during reaction, which is consistent with the well known selectivity of Cu toward acetaldehyde formation [42,64]. Unfortunately, due to its dark color the FTIR results on this sample are too noisy to show a good correlation with the adsorbed acetyl species. CuCr-0.8 has intermediate properties showing higher selectivity toward hydrogen production and exhibiting a distinct mixture of Cu0 and Cu1+ oxidation states during reaction. Previous in situ studies in our group show that the more selective catalysts for hydrogen production also show a mixture of oxidation states. The CuCr/Al catalyst exhibits similar XANES spectra than the CuCr-0.5 catalyst, whereas one would have expected more similarities with CuCr-0.8 due to its similar synthesis conditions activity–selectivity behavior. The excitation volume of X-ray absorption detected in the XANES spectra is different in unsupported and supported samples because X-rays absorption in the unsupported material reflects more bulk properties whereas in the supported one it reflects more the surface properties because of its higher dispersion on the alumina support. Due to the noisier signal of the results obtained in the bending magnet beam line, EXAFS fits were not reliable to estimate coordination numbers. CuCr/Al, while exhibiting similar oxidation state than the bulk of CuCr-0.5, should have exhibited some Cu1+ sites similar than CuCr-0.8 based on the similar activity selectivity behavior. It follows that such sites are probably located on the surface of the dispersed phase and are not detected by the XANES results. As reported using in situ FTIR studies Zhang at al. [45] show that ethanol is mainly adsorbed on reduced Cu0 phase and then easily dehydrogenated to acetyl species derived from adsorbed acetaldehyde. Colley et al. [64] used TPR-TPD to study a copper chromite catalysts previously reduced in hydrogen flow. After that a 12% C2H5OH/He stream was fed to the reactor. The cracking patterns of the reactant ethanol (C2H5OH) and product ethyl ethanoate (CH3CO2C2H5) together with those of possible intermediates [e.g., CH3CHO, (CH3COC2H5 and crotonaldehyde)] were determined by mass spectrometry, from which details on the elementary steps of reaction on copper/chromia catalysts were deduced. The existence of CuCr2O4 phase might contribute to the dispersion and stabilization of Cu0 phase in Cu-Cr and suppress or limit the catalyst deactivation. Thus Cu-CuCr2O4 are both active phases for the first step of ethanol decomposition to acetaldehyde and esters (ethyl acetate) compounds. The formation of the above mentioned compound was confirmed by in situ DRIFT results obtained on this catalyst. As it is well known, Cu has been found to be a good catalyst in both ethanol dehydrogenation and acetaldehyde hydrogenation and to be inactive for splitting the CC bond. However, Cu suffers from poor stability at high temperatures, where dehydrogenation is thermodynamically favorable. The use of promoters such as chromia and zinc oxide improves the active phase stability. The Zn alkaline oxides had a detrimental effect on the selectivity of reaction, promoting aldol condensation and thus forming undesirable higher hydrocarbons. Moreover, Kanoun et al. [62] have demonstrated that the total surface area decreases with the addition of promoters in this order: Al>Cr>Zr>V>Zn, while metallic copper surface area, which is responsible for the activity of the catalyst decreases with the additives in the following order: Cr>V=Zr>Al>Zn. Cr is thus the best structural promoter and also a good stabilizer. In addition, the chromia sites present in copper chromite catalysts, while useful to limit the sintering of copper particles, are probably active to break the CH and CC bonds of adsorbed ethoxy that further decomposes to form hydrogen, methane, and CO, and consequently the acetaldehyde selectivity decreases as the reaction temperature increases (Fig. 7). These results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature [18,61,65,66], in which is demonstrated that is generally accepted that Ni promotes CC bond scission. Freni and co-workers [35] found that the copper chromite exhibited high activity and selectivity to H2 due to the lower tendency of Cu to re-oxidize during the reaction. These aspects are also demonstrated by our results and the low tendency of metallic copper to re-oxidize during reaction and after exposure to air (150min) (Fig. 9). The XANES spectra of copper chromite catalysts have shown that after reduction and ethanol decomposition the oxidation state of the copper is Cu0 or Cu1+. These active phases have shown a high selectivity to acetaldehyde and hydrogen, as demonstrated in a previously study [42]. On the other hand, the nature of the support affects the performance of the catalyst, especially coke formation. Acidic supports, such as γ-alumina favors ethanol dehydration resulting in the formation of ethylene, which is a coke precursor. Dehydration can be reduced by using basic supports such as ZnO [67–72]. The DRIFT spectra suggest a possible mechanism of involving ethanol adsorption, followed by decomposition to ethoxy intermediate that in a second reaction step could yield aldehydes and acetate, by reaction with adsorbed acetaldehyde species at higher temperature. At temperature higher than 300°C these species decompose to give hydrogen and a series of undesirable reaction products. Chromia has a role of structural promoter and its presence prevents the copper mobility on the catalysts surface [62,63]. As demonstrated by Twigg and Spencer [69], the presence of chromia is fundamental to prevent the copper sintering, while Al2O3 support has an important dispersion effect on copper chromite crystallites, the Cr2O3 has probably a positive effect in avoiding the catalyst deactivation by sintering. As matter of fact, Hughes [70] gave the following increasing order of stability for metals: Ag<Cu<Au<Pd<Fe<Ni<Co<Pt<Rh<Ru<Ir<Os<Re. It is therefore not surprising that copper-based catalysts are more susceptible to thermal sintering than other commonly used metallic catalysts, such as the nickel, iron, palladium and platinum catalysts used in many hydrogen and dehydrogenation reactions. This is also shown by the low Huttig temperature of copper [71], which reflects a relatively low melting point (1063°C), compared with, for example, that of iron (1535°C) and nickel (1455°C). Therefore, copper-based catalysts have to be operated at relatively low temperatures, usually no higher than 300°C [72]. Moreover, the use of chromia as promoter has the effect to decrease deactivation due to C formation, commonly obtained in CuNiFe catalysts in which the selectivity decreased drastically with TOS although the conversion stays nearly constant. The reduction of coke formation is due to the basicity of chromium oxide that could create a good environment to reduce coke deposition principally favored by acidic Bronsted sites [45]. In summary, the picture that emerges from this study is that the active and selective catalysts prepared by CS consist of reduced Cu probably located on the surface of CuCr2O4. Ethanol interacts preferentially with Cu and form ethoxy species that decompose sequentially to the various products observed. The presence of chromia provides structural stability to Cu sites and in addition reduces coke formation while as demonstrated in literature [64,69–72] the catalysts of Cu-ZnO-Al2O3, although have good performances in the hydrogen production, are more susceptible to sintering and to a consequently rapid deactivation."
12,Conclusions,"Active and selective copper-chromite based catalysts for ethanol decomposition and partial oxidation were prepared by using combustion synthesis. The catalysts preparation, the use of zinc or chromia as promoters, and the use supports have a significant effect on the activity and selectivity of the catalysts and the formation of carbon which reduces the catalysts activity. The investigation on the use of an optimum ratio the fuel/oxidizer suggests the possibility, as demonstrated by ex situ characterization, to have catalysts with a particular morphology, oxidation state and specific surface area. All catalysts are active for ethanol decomposition at T >250°C, except for the catalyst prepared by using a high ratio glycine/fuel. On the other hand the catalysts selectivity varies with the fuel to oxidizer and the presence Zn. The unsupported CuCr-0.8 and the supported version CuCr/Al are the most active and selective catalysts. The supported CuCr/Al catalyst, while it deactivates with TOS it maintains its selectivity in a 25h TOS run, but the activity can be recovered by re-reduction. The in situ XAS characterization shows differences in oxidation state between the fresh samples and those reduced before, during, and after reaction. The CuCr-0.8 catalyst shows the presence of a mixed C0/Cu1+ mixture, whereas the other catalysts show mainly the presence of Cu0. The DRIFT investigation suggested the formation of several species adsorbed on the catalyst surface that at higher temperature could decompose by forming coke that deactivates the catalysts. Important is the effect of each components in particular Cu has been found to be a good catalyst in both ethanol dehydrogenation and acetaldehyde hydrogenation and to be incapable of splitting the CC bond. However, Cu suffers from poor stability at high temperatures, where dehydrogenation is thermodynamically favorable. The use of promoters such as chromia and zinc oxide is useful to limit the sintering phenomena and to improve the catalysts stability at high reaction temperature. The use of zinc as promoter has a detrimental effect on the specific surface area of copper while the chromia has the ability to improve the copper surface area to improve the activity and the selectivity of the catalytic systems. The use of Al2O3 induces the formation of CuO-based solid solution and the decrease in particle size of CuO species, thus increasing the conversion of ethanol. The presence of small amounts of oxygen, lower than the stoichiometric, limits coke deposition on the catalysts surface. In conclusion, the partial oxidation of ethanol, i.e. in the presence of oxygen at lower than the stoichiometric values, could be an alternative to the reforming reaction. Moreover, the use of appropriate promoters is fundamental to limit eventually sintering phenomenon and to increase the selectivity to hydrogen. The Cr2O3/CuCr3O4 has been considered the best structural promoter to promote the partial oxidation to hydrogen."
