0,Introduction,"Glycerol, which can be generated as a by-product of biodiesel process from biomass [1] has the significant advantages for hydrogen production. The glycerol-to-hydrogen system could be regarded as nearly CO2 neutral as carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere during glycerol conversion can be absorbed in the growth of biomass. In addition, from thermodynamic point of view, glycerol can be effectively converted into hydrogen [2,3]. Glycerol produces hydrogen through steam reforming (SRG) [4–7], partial oxidation (POG) [8], dry reforming (DRG) [9] and autothermal reforming (ATRG) [10]. POG and ATRG processes have the merit of fast start-up time because of the exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction. However, the steam reforming process provides the higher hydrogen yield and lower side-reactions rate. This steam reforming of glycerol process could be carried out in two steps for PEMFC. The first step involves the steam reforming of glycerol into H2, CO and CO2, followed by converting CO into CO2 via the water gas shift (WGS) reaction. Since the shift reaction is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium as well as requirement of containing trace CO as feed for fuel cell to avoid catalyst poisoning, an additional step has to add to further remove CO by preferential CO oxidation. An alternative route for combining steam reforming of glycerol with CO2 separation (SRGCC) in a single unit operation has advantages of short start-up time and less energy consumption. In this route, CaO is used as adsorbent to remove CO2 from the gas mixture and the catalyst is also utilized for the reforming reaction. Reaction and separation occur simultaneously, and thus the removal of CO2 from the gas phase will impel the equilibrium towards higher H2 yield. The use of CaO for the separation of CO2 has been investigated in the glycerol steam reforming processes. Dou et al. reported that a gas stream containing 95% H2 (dry) could be achieved by using calcined dolomite (mainly CaO) as an adsorbent during glycerol steam reforming [11,12]. Chen et al. studied the effect of temperature, pressure, a steam to glycerol molar ratio, CO2 adsorption fraction and N2 dilution on glycerol steam reforming with CO2 adsorption via thermodynamic calculation. In the reported study, the authors assumed that the percentage of CO2 adsorption was in the range of 0–99%, and then discussed effects of the different CO2 adsorption on the gas composition and coke formation [13]. In this work, effects of CO2 adsorption on glycerol steam reforming were considered to directly depend on the Gibbs free energy minimization instead of the above assumption. The influences of reaction temperature and pressure, H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio and CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio on reaction systems were analyzed to determine optimal conditions to produce H2 for PEMFC. Coke formation and energy efficiencies for reactions were also discussed. The thermodynamic results are compared with the reported experimental data in order to provide a valuable indication for practical application."
1,Modeling and simulation methodology,
2,Description of SRGCC technology,"2.1 Description of SRGCC technology The SRGCC process is shown in Fig. 1 . Glycerol is vaporized, mixed with H2O and heated to reach required inlet temperature of the reactor through the preheater. Then, the gas mixture is fed into the fuel reactor containing CaO and Ru supported catalyst. The hydrogen-rich gas produced is dried and fed directly into a CO pre-oxidation reactor. There is no need for a WGS reactor because of the low concentration of CO in the exit gas of the fuel reactor. After some time, CaCO3 generated from CaO is introduced into the regenerator to revive."
3,Minimization of Gibbs free energy,"2.2 Minimization of Gibbs free energy The minimization of Gibbs free energy is a method used commonly to calculate the equilibrium compositions of the reaction system [14–16]. The corresponding equations are summarized in Table 1 . The total Gibbs free energy of a system is given by the sum of ith species, as shown in Eq. (1). For reaction equilibrium in gas-phase, fi = yiφiP, fi ° = P°, and Gi ° = ΔGfi ° are assumed. By using the Lagrange multiplier method, the minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system without solid ones can be expressed as Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. The vapor–solid phase equilibrium is applied to the Gibbs-energy of carbon, as shown in Eq. (5), besides CaO, Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3. Thus, the minimization function of Gibbs-energy Eq. (6) is obtained by substituting Eq. (1) by Eqs. (3) and (5)."
4,Reactions of SRGCC,"2.3 Reactions of SRGCC The possible reactions of SRGCC can be described by Eqs. (7)–(27), as shown in Table 2 . Glycerol steam reforming reaction can be given as Eq. (7), which is endothermic (ΔH°298.15 = 350.67 kJ mol−1) [8]. Glycerol can also dehydrogenate to glyceraldehyde (C3H6O3) and dehydrate to hydroxyacetone (C3H6O2) according to Eqs. (8) and (9), respectively. The corresponding standard reaction enthalpies are −38.64 and −24.9 kJ mol−1, respectively. A secondary dehydration of them results in 2-oxopropanal (C3H4O2) and acrolein (C3H4O) through Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively [8]. The comparison of the activation energy of 270–300 kJ mol−1 for dehydration with that of 60–90 kJ mol−1 for glycerol conversion into syngas on Pt [17,18] indicates that dehydration is more difficult to proceed than glycerol to syngas. The decomposition of C3H8O3 to syngas by Eq. (12) is endothermic (ΔH°298.15 = 340.2 kJ mol−1) [8]. Moreover, C3H8O3 and 2-oxopropanal (C3H4O2) can also decompose to ethylene (C2H4) through Eq. (13), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) by Eq. (14), followed to convert into CH4 and CO by Eq. (15), respectively. In the same way, C3H6O3, C3H6O2 and C3H4O can decompose to CH4, CO, H2 and H2O. Carbon oxide methanation (Eqs. (16) and (17)), C2H4 hydrogenation (Eq. (18)) and WGS (Eq. (19)) reactions also occur in SRG process. Coke formation may come from C2H4 decomposition (Eq. (20)), methane decomposition (Eq. (21)) and disproportion reactions (Eq. (22)) as well as reductions of carbon oxides (Eqs. (23) and (24)) [4]. In addition, using CaO as an adsorbent to eliminate certain amount of CO2 during glycerol gasification was attempted in a “CO2 acceptor process” through Eq. (25) [11,19,20]. It is also noted that the high pressure steam can result in the formation of Ca(OH)2, according to Eq. (26). The Ca(OH)2 formed can also capture CO2 to form CaCO3 by Eq. (27) [21]. Hydrogen may come from different reaction pathways according to the above discussion. In order to maximize hydrogen production, it is crucial to supply enough H2O and minimize glycerol dehydration and decomposition. In the present procedure, seventeen species in SRGCC were involved in the thermodynamic calculations, including thirteen gaseous species, i.e., glycerol (C3H8O3), water (H2O), hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), 2-oxopropanal (C3H4O2), acrylaldehyde (C3H4O), hydroxyacetone (C3H6O2) and glyceraldehyde (C3H6O3); and four solid ones, carbon (graphite, C), calcium oxide (CaO), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2."
5,Operating conditions in the simulation,"2.4 Operating conditions in the simulation The calculations employing the Gibbs free energy minimization are capable of simulating single-phase or multi-phase of multicomponents in equilibrium. In the simulation, the water-to-glycerol (H2O/C3H8O3) molar ratio, the CaO-to-glycerol (CaO/C3H8O3) molar ratio, reaction temperature and pressure were varied in the range of 0–10, 0–20, 500–1500 K and 1–50 atm, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Equilibrium analysis of reactions,"3.1 Equilibrium analysis of reactions Fig. 2 shows the equilibrium constant K p in part of equations as a function of temperatures, determined from the Van’t Hoff reaction. Eqs. (7), (12) and (13) play a key role in the SRG system due to high equilibrium constants in the temperature range of 500–1500 K. The glycerol decomposition reactions (Eqs. (12) and (13)) can bring about the complete conversion of glycerol in the absence of water [4]. The addition of H2O leads to glycerol steam reforming into a main reaction as well as glycerol decomposition reactions (Eqs. (12) and (13)). Dou et al. also found that, in the absence of catalyst and steam, thermal decomposition of glycerol may achieve 98% conversion above 533 K under N2 flow, while glycerol conversions reach 63%, 95%, 100% and 100% at 673, 773, 873 and 973 K, respectively, under conditions of the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 1 [11]. Thus, high glycerol conversion is dependent on steam reforming and decomposition of glycerol in SRG process. The effects of temperature, the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio, pressure and the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio on products distribution are discussed as follows (Sections 3.2–3.4)."
8,Effects of temperature and water-to-glycerol molar ratio,"3.2 Effects of temperature and water-to-glycerol molar ratio 3.2.1 H2 and CO concentration Fig. 3 illustrates the equilibrium concentration of hydrogen on a dry basis in SRG (a) and SRGCC (b) as a function of water-to-glycerol ratios and temperatures. In SRG process, the H2 concentration increases slowly with the increase of the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio from 0 to 10. At the same time, hydrogen equilibrium concentration also increases with the increase from 500 K to 900 K. This is mainly because steam reforming and decomposition of glycerol (Eqs. (7), (12) and (13)) occur simultaneously with the WGS reaction. However, change of H2 concentration is not prominent above 900 K because of the inhibition of the exothermic WGS reaction. In SRGCC process, the H2 concentration climbs monotonously with the increase in the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio from 0 to 10, but firstly climbs and then sharply drops with the increase of the temperature from 500 K to 1500 K. With the temperature increase from 500 K to 900 K, the increase of H2 concentration is attributed to a compromise among steam reforming and decomposition of glycerol, carbon monoxide methanation (Eq. (16)), WGS (Eq. (19)) and CO2 and H2O adsorption reaction (Eqs. (25) and (26)). When temperature above 900 K, the H2 concentration decreases with the increase of temperature, indicating that the CO2 separation reaction is no longer a dominated procedure because the adsorption reaction of CO2 (Eq. (25)) is an exothermic reaction and inhibited at high temperature. The hydrogen content on a dry basis is over 95% in the temperature range of 800–900 K at H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 4 and 1 atm, which is similar to the experimental results [11]. Fig. 4 illustrates the CO concentration on a dry basis from SRG (a) and SRGCC (b) as a function of the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio and temperature. As temperature above 900 K, the CO concentrations in both SRG and SRGC have the similar tendency. They increase monotonously with the increase of temperature from 900 K to 1500 K. However, the CO concentration in SRGCC is lower than that in SRG at temperature below 900 K. The occurrence of carbon monoxide methanation (Eq. (16)), WGS (Eq. (19)) and CO2 adsorption results in the decreases in CO. Fig. 4 also shows that the CO concentrations decrease with the increase of H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio from 0 to 10. 3.2.2 CO2 and CH4 concentration When hydrogen is used in PEMFC, it can be typically diluted with CO2 and CH4. As a consequence, this dilution decreases the ideal electric potential of the cells and increases the concentration-related losses [22]. As shown in Fig. 5 , there are the similar CO2 concentrations in both SRG and SRGCC at temperatures above 900 K. However, the CO2 concentration in SRGCC is by far the lower than that in SRG at temperatures below 900 K because exothermic carbon monoxide methanation (Eq. (16)) and WGS (Eq. (19)) are intensified by Eq. (25) in SRGCC. Fig. 6 shows CH4 concentration from SRG and SRGCC as a function of temperature and the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio. The equilibrium concentration of CH4 from SRG is lower than that from SRGCC at temperatures below 900 K mainly because H2O more easily reacts with CaO to form Ca(OH)2 (Eq. (26)) as well as carbon monoxide methanation (Eq. (16)), WGS (Eq. (19)) and CO2 separation reaction (Eq. (25)). Thus, CH4 steam reforming inhibited leads to relatively high CH4 concentration. Further increase in temperature results in a decrease of methane. There are similar CH4 concentrations in both SRG and SRGCC at temperatures above 900 K. In fact, methane was found over nickel catalysts in SRG at 923 K experimentally [23]. CH4 is obviously not a desirable product in the case of H2 production, and thus the catalyst should have a sufficient capacity for reforming the produced CH4 into hydrogen. In thermodynamic point of view, operating at temperature 900 K and H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio 4.0 is feasible. 3.2.3 Other thermodynamically plausible products Apart from those species discussed above, C2H4, C2H6, CH3CHO, C3H4O2, C3H4O, C3H6O2 and C3H6O3 were also observed in the experimental studies [8,23,24]. These species are also analyzed in this work. C2H4 and C2H6 appear in the range of 500–1500 K for SRG and SRGCC. Both of them are at ppm level. The concentrations of CH3CHO, C3H4O2, C3H4O, C3H6O2 and C3H6O3 thermodynamically approach zero in the whole investigated temperature range. This result is in agreement with the literature from Lima da Silva and Müller [25]. From the above points, the separation of CO2 in the gaseous phase will benefit generation of hydrogen-rich gas with the less CO. However, the condition required from CO concentration <10 ppm for the PEMFC application is too severe. It can be accomplished with preferential oxidation using a precious metal catalyst [22]."
9,Effects of pressure,"3.3 Effects of pressure The pressure significantly impacts on the equilibrium molar fractions of the system. In this work, it is also investigated for SRG and SRGCC in the range of 1–20 atm at 900 K and the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 4. The effect of pressure on the H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations in SRG and SRGCC is shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . The H2 and CO concentrations decrease, while the CH4 and CO2 concentrations increase with the increase of pressure in SRG, since the increase of pressure accelerates methanation reactions (Eqs. (16) and (17)). In comparison with the results in SRG, the H2 concentration prominently increases and the CO and CO2 concentrations decrease to trace in SRGCC. The addition of CaO influences the equilibrium component through CO2 separation. Hydrogen-rich gas is generated at low pressure in SRGCC. Therefore, pressure has a negative effect on the hydrogen content and the maximum hydrogen concentration is achieved at atmospheric pressure."
10,Effect of CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio,"3.4 Effect of CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio As discussed above, the addition of CaO leads to the equilibrium exit composition with the higher H2 concentration and the lower CO concentration. Both of them are suitable for the operation of the fuel cells, especially PEMFC. In order to further determine the influence of the sorbent-to-fuel molar ratio on the equilibrium, the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio was varied from 0 to 20 at 900 K, the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 4 and 1 atm. The predicted H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations (on a dry basis) as functions of the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio are displayed in Fig. 9 . With the increase in CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio from 0 to 10, the H2 concentration (on a dry basis) sharply rises from 60.64% to 96.80% and both CO and CO2 concentrations decrease correspondingly. A maximum for CH4 is observed. However, the H2, CO CO2 and CH4 concentrations remain relatively steady with the further increase in the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio above 10. In light of the above discussion, the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 10 should be viewed as the optimal conditions based on the thermodynamic calculation. Obviously, there is significant potential for energy savings by minimizing the amount of CaO, while maintaining maximum H2 output and effective CO2 capture is at the expense of energy penalties related to the generation and regeneration of the sorbent. At the lower temperature, the lower hydrogen and higher methane content occur. On the other hand a large amount of CO and CO2 are formed at the higher temperature. The lower H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratios favors CO and CH4 formation, while higher ones lead to remarkable increase of the H2 yield at the expense of larger volume reactor. In addition, hydrogen-rich gas with the less CO can be obtained at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the optimal conditions are the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 4, the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 10 and 900 K at 1 atm in SRGCC. Under these conditions, the H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations on a dry basis are 96.80%, 0.73%, 0.30% and 2.17%, respectively."
11,Coke-formed region and coke-free region,"3.5 Coke-formed region and coke-free region Coke (solid carbon or graphite) formation in the steam reforming of glycerol has shown to be prominent in the experimental studies [7]. Coke formation during the catalytic steam reforming could lead to deactivation of catalysts, resulting in low operation durability and activity loss [23]. It is interesting to determine the reaction conditions eliminating coke in the thermodynamic calculation of SRG and SRGCC. The possible reactions for coke formation are Eqs. (20)–(24) [4]. T C is defined as the critical temperature. 3.5.1 SRG Fig. 10 shows the effects of temperature, the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio and pressure on coke formation boundaries for SRG. The regions above and below T c lines are the coke-free and coke-formed regions, respectively. At 1 atm, coke is absent at temperatures above 558 K and the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio above 4. Obviously, high temperatures and water-to-glycerol ratios inhibit the coke formation. The increase of pressure from 1 atm to 50 atm promotes the coke formation at the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio below 2.3. In contrast, the decrease of pressure favors the coke generation in the water-to-glycerol molar ratio range of 2.3–4.7. In summary, coke generation decreases with the increase of the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio and temperature, while effects of pressure on coke formation depend on the operating temperature and the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio. In order to reduce coke generation, lower pressure should be applied at higher temperature and lower the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio, while higher pressure is feasible in the case of lower temperature and higher H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio. 3.5.2 SRGCC Fig. 11 shows the coke formation boundaries for SRGCC. There are two coke-free regions (I) and one coke-formed region (II) at 1 atm. Coke is absent at temperature above 500 K and water-to-glycerol molar ratio above 1.8. High temperature and H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio inhibit coke formation. With the increase in pressure from 1 atm to 50 atm, a new coke-formed region is formed. Presence of the new coke-formed region at high pressure may be due to a compromise among CO disproportion (Eq. (22)), CO reduction (Eq. (23)), carbon monoxide methanation, WGS and CO2 separation. The addition of water has a significant effect on coke formation despite of the relatively little one on glycerol conversion and hydrogen yield. One can see that the area of coke-formed region in SRGCC is smaller than that in SRG, indicating that the use of CaO suppresses coke formation. In the practical point of view, the operation should be far away from coke-formed region."
12,Effects of reaction conditions on energy conversion efficiencies,"3.6 Effects of reaction conditions on energy conversion efficiencies Fig. 12 shows effects of reaction conditions on energy efficiencies based on higher heating values. Energy conversion efficiencies firstly increase and then decrease with the increase of temperature, while they increase monotonously with the increasing in H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio in SRG and SRGCC. However, SRGCC has higher efficiencies than SRG under the same conditions. Conversion efficiency for glycerol steam reforming is in the range of 70–85% according to Levin and Chahine [26]. These results are in good agreement with the calculation data in this work. Furthermore, Fig. 13 displays effects of pressures on energy efficiencies. Since low pressure benefits hydrogen production, energy efficiencies decrease with the increase of pressure for SRG or SRGCC. However, CO2 adsorption also increases energy efficiencies of glycerol steam reforming correspondingly."
13,Conclusions,"Thermodynamic analysis for SRGCC via Gibbs free minimization method has been carried out to evaluate the effects of reaction temperatures, H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratios, pressures and CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratios on the H2, CO, CO2, CH4 concentrations in equilibrium and coke formation. The addition of CaO to the reactor greatly enhances the hydrogen production and reduces the CO and CO2 concentrations. Concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4, 96.80%, 0.73%, 0.30% and 2.17%, could be achieved at the optimized conditions, i.e., the H2O/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 4, the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio of 10, 900 K and 1 atm. Potential advantage of the combination of glycerol steam reforming and separation of CO2 using CaO for a PEMFC application has a higher hydrogen generation and the WGS reactor is not necessary afterward. Effects of pressure on coke formation depend on the operating temperature and the CaO/C3H8O3 molar ratio in SRG. SRGCC has the smaller coke-formed region than SRG because of CO2 separation. Energy efficiency in SRGCC is higher than that of SRG under the same reaction conditions. It is noteworthy that the thermodynamic equilibrium analysis did not consider any kinetic constraints, such as, concentration and/or temperature gradients occurring in the real process. Nevertheless, the equilibrium calculation provides a useful guide for predicting major species in the system and allows a better understanding of the complex reactions happening in the SRGCC system."
