0,Introduction,"Modern life depends on the use of carbon-containing raw materials for the development of the chemical industry and fuel generation. The replacement of non-renewable fossil fuels to obtain high value-added chemicals through biomass valorization is an interesting alternative. Heterogeneous catalysis is a valuable tool in achieving this objective [1,2]. Lignocellulosic biomass originated mainly from agricultural and forest wastes is considered one of the most auspicious renewable sources of biomass. Lignocellulose consists mainly of three structural components, cellulose (30-50%), hemicellulose (20-40%) and lignin (15-25%). Cellulose is a polysaccharide with crystalline structure formed by D-glucose molecules linearly connected by β−(1,4) glycosidic bonds. Hemicellulose is an amorphous polysaccharide consisting of sugar molecules with 5 (mainly xylose) and 6 carbons, while lignin is a complex polymer composed of aromatic alcohols (monolignols) [3]. The simple hydrolysis of the carbohydrate polymers, cellulose and hemicellulose, releases individual sugar molecules, which can subsequently be hydrogenated to the corresponding sugar alcohols [4]. Glucose is the sugar hydrolysis product of cellulose. On the other hand, the degradation of hemicellulose gives rise to both glucose as well as other five (xylose, arabinose) and six (mannose, galactose, rhamnose) membered sugars (Scheme 1 ). The main product of the hydrogenation of glucose under relatively mild reaction conditions and using typical hydrogenation catalysts is sorbitol [5]. Sorbitol is an important chemical product that is used at industrial scale for the production of vitamin C, cosmetics and other applications [6]. As a sweetener, it replaces sugar in food products. More recently, sorbitol has been considered as a platform molecule for the production of high added-value chemicals and substances, such as isosorbide, 1,4-sorbitan, glycols, lactic acid, H2 for fuel cells and C5-6 hydrocarbons [7]. Although sorbitol can be isolated from fruits, at industrial scale its production is accomplished through the catalytic hydrogenation of glucose [6]. In solution, D-glucose can be found in equilibrium with its cyclic pyranose form. Depending on the reaction conditions, other products such as D-fructose and D-mannose can be generated through Lobry de Bruyn-Alberda van Ekenstein rearrangements and then produce D-mannitol by hydrogenation. Another possible by-product is 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, which can be produced by dehydration of glucose, affecting selectivity to sorbitol. To control the formation of these compounds, high hydrogen pressures, low temperature and ruthenium catalysts are generally used. Furthermore, polyols, such as sorbitol, can further react by hydrogenolytic cleavage of C-O or C-C bonds, leading to the production of alcohols with the same length, but with fewer OH groups or polyols shorter than sugar alcohols (mainly glycerol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, but also tetritols, propanol, lactic acid, ethanol and methanol). Raney-Ni catalysts have attracted great interest for the hydrogenation of glucose, mainly due to its lower cost and higher activity compared to other catalytic systems [8,9]. However, Raney-Ni catalysts frequently undergo deactivation mainly due to leaching of Ni and poisoning of the active surface of the catalyst by the presence of organic species [10–12]. As an alternative to Ni-based catalysts, noble-metals (Pt, Rh, Pd and Ru) have also been studied as active phases in heterogeneous catalysts in the hydrogenation of glucose [13–15]. Among all the proposed active phases, Ru exhibited the best catalytic performance in terms of activity and stability overcoming the issue of leaching of the active phase. Besides, Ru can be dispersed on several supports in order to both decrease the price of the catalysts and improve the hydrogenation performance [16]. Other related extensively studied process is the catalytic hydrogenation of xylose to produce xylitol, a very important platform molecule, which can be transformed into a variety of chemical products [17–19]. Xylitol, a sugar alcohol of five carbon atoms, is found in small amounts in nature [20]. It is an excellent sweetener, similar to sucrose, which sweetens almost twice as much as sorbitol and approximately three times as much as mannitol. Xylitol has other interesting properties such as its anti-carcinogenic activity, while having a wide range of applications in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and synthetic resin industries [21]. The liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation of xylose seems, at a first glance, simple, but the generation of small quantities of byproducts, e.g. xylulose and arabitol, complicates the process, since additional purification of xylitol is then required. In addition, in some cases under severe experimental conditions (high temperatures and alkali concentration) there is the possibility of furfural and xylonic acid formation as byproducts [22,23]. As a contribution to the subject of valorization of lignocellulosic biomass, in the present work, the activity and selectivity of Ru catalysts supported on different materials (γ-alumina, zirconia, zirconia-alumina, phosphated zirconia and phosphated zirconia-alumina) was investigated. More specifically, this paper is focused on the effect of the support. To do this, relatively mild reaction conditions, 90 °C, 1.25 MPa H2 pressure and water as solvent have been selected to evaluate the performance of such catalysts in the conversion of glucose and xylose to sorbitol and xylitol, respectively. As it is well-known, the nature of the solvent can influence the catalytic behavior through various effects, such as the solubility of H2 in the solvent, the polarity of the solvent, the solvent-reagent or solvent-catalyst interaction. Beyond this, and taking into account the probable applications for food, medical, and cosmetic applications of the reaction products, water was selected as a harmless and environmentally friendly solvent. The catalytic results were discussed in the light of the characterization of the catalysts obtained through N2 physisorption, X-Ray Diffraction, Thermogravimetric Analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Temperature-Programmed Reduction and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy."
1,Experimental,
2,Support preparation,"2.1 Support preparation 2.1.1 ZrO2 (Z) and ZrO2-Al2O3 (Z-A) preparation ZrO2 support was prepared by following the method described elsewhere [24]. Zirconyl chloride octahydrate, ZrOCl2·8H2O (SIGMA-ALDRICH, reagent grade 98%), used as ZrO2 precursor was added in Milli Q quality water to form a homogeneous solution. Then, a NH3·H2O (Cicarelli, p.a.) solution, approximately 1 M was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. Once the pH of the solution reached a value of 10 and the formation of a gel was observed, the mixture was aged for 7 days at room temperature. The solid was washed with distilled water until negative test for chloride ions (determined by AgNO3), filtered and dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The material obtained after calcination at 600 °C for 2 h was designated as Z. ZrO2-Al2O3 support was prepared following an analogous procedure, a ZrOCl2·8H2O solution was added onto a γ-Al2O3 (Air Products, surface area 216 m2 g−1; pore volume 0.45 cm3 g−1) suspension, in an appropriate concentration so as to obtain 15 wt.% ZrO2 in the resulting solid. A 15 wt.% ZrO2 deposited on alumina allows obtaining a support that, while developing a surface area suitable for catalysis (166 m2 g-1), has the characteristics of a crystalline phase of ZrO2. Before using it, the obtained support, denoted Z-A, was dried at 105 °C for 24 h and finally calcined at 600 °C for 2 h. 2.1.2 Phosphated zirconia (ZP) and phosphated zirconia-γ-Al2O3 (ZP-A) preparation These supports were prepared also by the sol-gel method. A ZrO2 support was prepared according to the procedure previously described in section 2.1.1. Then, it was impregnated with a H3PO4 solution (Biopack, p.a.) following the procedure proposed by Hernández et al. [25]. The amount of concentrated acid was calculated in order to obtain 20 wt.% of PO4 3- in the resulting support and it was diluted with water (Milli Q quality) to obtain a liquid/solid ratio of 5:1. The system was allowed to stand for 24 h and then it was dried in an oven for another 24 h. Then, the support was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h. This support was designated ZP. For the preparation of the alumina-supported phosphated material, a ZrO2-Al2O3 support was prepared following the steps described in section 2.1.1. Next, the obtained material was impregnated with H3PO4 (Biopack, p.a.), following the same procedure described to obtain the ZP support. The solid, after calcination at 600 °C, was designated ZP-A."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The supported Ru catalysts were obtained by wet impregnation on the four supports with a ruthenium loading of 3 wt.% Ru. For this, the calculated amount of the ruthenium salt, RuCl3.xH2O (Merck), was weighed and dissolved in ultrapure water. A liquid/solid ratio of 5:1 was used to impregnate the support. The system was left at rest for 24 h after which it was dried at 105 °C for 24 h in an oven. Subsequently, the catalysts were reduced using a H2 flow at 300 °C during 2 h to fix the metal to the support. Then, the systems were washed until total elimination of chloride ions (tested with AgNO3). After removing the chlorides, a new reduction was conducted to activate the catalysts. Same conditions were used. The systems were designated as Ru/Z, Ru/ZP, Ru/Z-A and Ru/ZP-A. Also, an alumina-supported Ru catalyst (3 wt.% Ru) was prepared, using a commercial γ-Al2O3 (crushed and sieved to 60-100 mesh and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in order to eliminate volatile impurities). The preparation procedure was the same as the previously described for the other catalysts and the catalyst was designated Ru/A."
4,Characterization of supports and catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of supports and catalysts Textural properties of the supports were determined by N2 physisorption at −196 °C, with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. By means of the BET equation, surface area (SBET) was estimated and the pore volume (VP) was calculated using the adsorption curve of the isotherm at P/P0 = 0.98 (Gurvitsch rule). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out using a SEM 505 Phillips microscope, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy facility. This analysis allowed investigating the morphological characteristics of the Z, Z-A, ZP and ZP-A supports. The micrographs of the solids were obtained after metallization of the samples with a very thin gold layer. The global composition of Z-A was also examined by this technique together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX DX PRIME 10 Microanalysis System). The X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out in a Phillips PW 1390 diffractometer. The monochromatic radiation used in the diffractometer was Cu Kα with a wavelength λ =1.5405 Å. The procedure to obtain the diffractograms consisted of scanning from 2θ = 8° to 2θ = 80°, with a scanning speed of 2°/min for all the samples. The Garvie and Nicholsson method is a semiquantitative method that allows estimating the proportion of monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2) with respect to the tetragonal phase (t-ZrO2), using the following expression: (1) X m = I m − 111 + I m 111 I m − 111 + I m 111 + I t 101 being I m − 111 and I m 111 the line intensities of the (-111) and (111) peaks for the monoclinic phase (m) (at 2θ 28.2° and 31.5°, respectively) and I t 101 is the intensity of the (101) peak for the tetragonal phase (t) of ZrO2, located 2θ = 30.2° [26]. Calculation of the average size of the crystallites was performed by using the formula of Scherrer [27], which relates the width of the diffraction line with the dimensions of the crystal, according to the following equation: (2) τ = 0.9 λ β cos θ where τ is the crystal size, λ is the wavelength of the Cu Kα radiation, β is the full width half maximum and θ is the Bragg diffraction angle. Thermogravimetric (TGA) studies were performed on a Shimadzu TGA-50 apparatus. The heating rate used was 10 °C min−1 and the final temperature was 800 °C. The tests were performed under a He atmosphere (60 cm3 min-1). All prepared catalysts were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a JEOL 100 CX II microscope. The samples were prepared by dispersing each catalyst in distilled water using ultrasound. A drop of the resulting suspension was then applied to the microscope grid covered with a carbon film. The images of the catalysts were captured in order to observe Ru particle size. The diameter of over 200 particles on each sample was measured and it was obtained the mean particle size (dTEM mean volume-area diameter) from the following expression: (3) d T E M = ∑ n i d i 3 n i d i 2 with ni being the number of particles and di the size particle. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies were performed in a laboratory-made apparatus on the catalyst´s precursors. The sample (50 mg) was placed in a 6 mm diameter reactor made of quartz and heated from room temperature until 700 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C min-1. Before running the analysis, the reactor was purged with Ar at 20 °C for 20 min to take away impurities and water present in the catalyst. The feeding was a mixture of 5% H2 in Ar and the flow rate 25 mL min-1. Hydrogen consumption was detected with a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph provided of a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out using a Physical Electronics PHI 5700 spectrometer equipped with a multi-channel detector and a non-monochromatic Al Kα source (300 W, 15 kV and 1486.6 eV). The powder samples were pelletized, and the spectra were recorded in the constant pass energy mode at 29.35 eV. Adventitious carbon (C 1s at 284.8 eV) was taken as internal standard. Acquisition and data analysis were performed with the PHI ACCESS ESCA-V6.0 F software package. The intensity of the signals was estimated integrating each peak, after subtracting the Shirley-type background, and the recorded spectra were fitted using a combination of Lorentzian and Gaussian curves. Ru 3d, Ru 3p, Zr 3d, P 2p, Al 2p and O 1s core-level spectra were recorded."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The aqueous phase hydrogenation of the monosaccharides glucose and xylose was conducted in a high-pressure reactor (Berghof BR-100, 100 cm3) at a temperature of 90 °C and 1.25 MPa of H2 pressure. A mass of 250 mg catalyst was put in the reactor, together with 0.90 g of substrate and 50 mL of water. The progress of the reactions was followed through the analysis of liquid samples by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a DIONEX UltiMate 3000 UHPLC instrument equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector thermostated at 40 °C and an ion exclusion column Phenomenex Rezex RCM Ca+2 Monosaccharide (300 x 7.8 mm) at 80 °C. Deionized water was used as eluent for the analysis, at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The products were identified by comparison with pure standards. The substrate conversion was calculated using the following expression: (4) x % = C 0 − C t C 0 100 where x is the substrate conversion, C 0 its initial molar concentration and C t is the molar concentration at time t (min), both determined chromatographically. The selectivity to product i ( S i ) was determined as indicated by the following equation: (5) S i % = C i t ∑ i = 1 n C i t 100 where C i t is the molar concentration of product i at time t (min). The initial reaction rate (ri , mmol gRu -1 min-1) was defined as the mmoles of substrate consumed, per gram of ruthenium and per min. The ri values were calculated with the slope of the lines obtained in the curves of conversion vs. time considering the data at x ≤10%. The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated with the initial reaction rate and the dispersion of the metallic phase (D)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of supports and catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of supports and catalysts Fig. 1 (a)–(f) shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm at −196 °C for each one of the supports used in this work. The isotherm of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 1 (a)) is of type IV(a), according to the IUPAC classification [28]. This kind of isotherm is characteristic of mesoporous materials, whose adsorption behavior is determined by the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and also by the interactions between the molecules in the condensed state. In Fig. 1 (b) and (c), the isotherms of the Z support prepared in our laboratory are shown. Before calcination, Z support presents a type II isotherm (Fig. 1(b)), resulting from the monolayer-multilayer adsorption without restrictions up to high p/p0 ratios. After its calcination at 600 °C, support Z exhibits a type IV(a) isotherm, like that of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 1 (c)). The ZP support (not shown) also presented type IV(a) isotherm in the N2 physisorption analysis carried out both before its calcination and after calcining the material at 600 °C. The isotherms of the alumina-deposited zirconia support Z-A (Fig. 1 (d) and (e)) and ZP-A (Fig. 1 (f)), are also of type IV. In addition, they are very similar to the isotherm corresponding to the A support (Fig. 1 (a)), which indicates that the surface characteristics of the starting alumina is what dictates the adsorption-desorption behavior of these supports. Table 1 summarizes the textural properties, both for the supports synthesized in the laboratory and for commercial γ-Al2O3. For zirconium oxide, it can be seen that there is a large difference between the surface area of the zirconia hydrogel and the calcined zirconia. Thus, the surface area of the zirconia hydrogel is 330 m2/g, while after calcination, the Z support presented a SBET of 24 m2/g. The calcination at 600 °C leads to the collapse of part of the porous structure of the support. On the other hand, it can also be seen that this process led to an increase in the average pore diameter. This phenomenon could be derived from a change in the morphology of the support, due to the formation of interparticular pores [24]. The commercial γ-Al2O3, on the other hand, has a specific surface area SBET of 216 m2/g. The deposit of zirconia on this alumina produces a decrease in the specific surface area of the latter, most likely by blocking a fraction of its pores. However, the high surface of alumina allows the ZrO2 to disperse, creating supports with a significant BET area, higher than those corresponding to the bulk supports (166 and 178 m2 g-1 for Z-A and ZP-A, respectively versus 24 and 4 m2 g-1 for Z and ZP, respectively). In addition, comparing Z-A with ZP-A, it is appreciated that the introduction of the phosphate ion to the zirconium oxide structure promoted an increase in the specific area. By contrast, the pore volume, which was about 0.43 cm3 g-1 on Z-A support, did not change significantly with the introduction of the phosphate anion (0.50 cm3 g-1). Hence, the presence of phosphate species seems to stabilize the surface area of this support, as reported in the literature [29]. The SEM study allowed investigating the morphological characteristics of the Z, Z-A, ZP and ZP-A supports (Fig. 2 ). Figs. 2 (a) and (b) shows smooth surfaces with a well-defined and low porosity crystal structure for Z and ZP samples, which is consistent with the results of surface area measurements, as shown in Table 1. When dispersing the zirconia and the phosphated zirconia on the alumina, structures of higher porosity are appreciated (Figs. 2 (c) and (d)). Samples of the calcined and uncalcined Z-A support were analyzed by EDS in order to carry out a semi-quantitative analysis. The results showed a percentage of zirconium of approximately 20% before calcining and 17% after calcination of the sample. Taking into account that the L line of the Zr is very close to the M line of Au used to metallize the sample, may be that the content of Zr is being overestimated. So, it could be concluded that the percentage of Zr determined by SEM agrees well with the 15 wt.% with which the Z-A support was prepared. When trying to analyze the ZP-A support in the same way, it was found that the lines of Zr and P were practically totally overlapped and, therefore, the integration was not valid. The study of the structure of the prepared supports was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In Fig. 3 (a), the XRD patterns of Z and Z-A supports are presented. It is well known that when the calcination temperature of zirconia is kept below 300 °C, the X-ray diffraction patterns show an amorphous structure [30]. This result was the one observed for the uncalcined Z support (curve (b)). Crystallization occurs when this material is calcined between 300 °C and 600 °C. In accordance with this, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the calcined Z support (curve (a)) are sharp, indicating the formation of crystalline phases composed of a mixture of monoclinic (m) and tetragonal (t) phases. This was verified by the presence of diffraction signals at 2θ = 28.2, 31.5 and 34.5°, corresponding to the (-111), (111) and (002) planes of the monoclinic phase, respectively and 2θ = 30.5, 35.0, 50.1 and 60.0°, corresponding to the (101), (110), (112) and (211) planes of the tetragonal phase, respectively. X-ray diffraction revealed that Z support used in this paper presented both tetragonal (24%) and monoclinic (76%) phases, as calculated using equation (1). The particle size of the monoclinic phase of the Z support was estimated using the Scherrer equation (equation (2)) resulting in about 12 nm. On the other hand, the Z-A support presented a crystalline structure corresponding to the tetragonal phase of zirconia, although only the most intense line at 2θ = 30.5° could be observed (curve (c), Fig. 3(a)). Regarding the phosphate-modified supports, the ZP sample (curve (a), Fig. 3 (b)) was to a large extent amorphous, presenting only three reflections of very low intensity at 2θ = 20.0, 21.4 and 26.2°, which indicate the presence of a zirconium phosphate phase [31]. With the ZP-A support, an amorphous phase was obtained when analyzed by XRD (curve (c) Fig. 3 (b)). These results agree with literature, in the sense that phosphate species prevents the solid crystallization when added in high loadings [25,32]. Table 2 summarizes the crystalline phases observed by XRD for the calcined solids used as catalytic supports. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DrTGA) was used to study the total mass loss of the precursors of Z and Z-A supports (uncalcined). As shown in Fig. 4 , four weight loss events were observed in the temperature range between 25 and 500 °C. The first three weight losses located between 25 and 250 °C, can be attributed to the loss of physically adsorbed water and terminal hydroxo groups [33]. The fourth stage (250–500 °C) is expected to be originated in the oxolation of OH bridges that starts to develop oxide nuclei and then the growth of these nuclei until they form crystallites of greater size. The weight loss of the phosphated supports (ZP and ZP-A) occurs in similar events as those seen for the non-modified materials, Z and Z-A. It should be mentioned, however, the lower weight loss obtained with respect to that observed in the original hydrogels (Table 2). This behaviour is associated to the high stability of the dopant phosphate anions, which establish stronger bonds with zirconium than those established by the -OH groups. This fact generates a delay or prevents the early formation of the crystalline phases of zirconia and, in addition, leads to solids with a higher specific surface area, in agreement with that observed by XRD and BET [25]. In relation to the ruthenium catalysts prepared using these supports, their physicochemical properties were studied by TEM, TPR and XPS. Figure S1 (Supplementary Information) shows the TEM micrographs of all the prepared catalysts and their respective particle size distribution histograms. From these TEM measurements, the mean size of the metallic particles, dTEM , expressed as the average volume-area diameter (Dva in Table 3 ) were calculated. Using this information, the dispersion of Ru (DRu ) was calculated using equation 6, for all the prepared catalysts [34]: (6) D R u = 0.91 d T E M As expected, the supports with greater surface area allowed obtaining higher dispersion values for the deposited metal and smaller particle sizes. In this sense, the difference between ZP and ZP-A supported catalysts is remarkable. The high surface area of the alumina allowed obtaining a support with a greater final surface area and almost doubling the dispersion of the ruthenium catalyst (16% and 30% for Ru/ZP and Ru/ZP-A, respectively). Such characteristics are beneficial for hydrogenation catalysts. It is worth mentioning the behaviour of the Ru/Z-A system which, despite being prepared on the support having a smaller surface area than Ru/ZP-A, due to having presented the smallest size of metallic particles, gave rise to the system with the highest metallic dispersion. TPR was used to determine the reducibility of the prepared catalysts. The TPR profiles of all the studied catalysts are displayed in Fig. 5 . The diagram of Ru/A catalyst shows a peak of H2 consumption centred around 145 °C, which can be assigned to the reduction of Ru3+ to Ru° in a single stage [35]. The zirconia-supported catalyst (Ru/Z) exhibits a well-defined reduction peak, whose maximum is at 95 °C, while the one supported on Z-A presents a peak of H2 consumption at 130 °C, i.e., at a temperature intermediate between that observed when the metal is deposited on the separated supports. The variation in the reduction temperature of Ru3+ is different according to the degree of interaction of the metal with the different supports used. In the phosphated systems (Ru/ZP and Ru/ZP-A), the consumption peak assigned to the reduction of Ru3+ to Ru° is also observed, but shifted towards higher temperatures, indicating that stronger interactions exist with the support. A second peak ca. 400 °C is also observed, which could be attributed to ruthenium species with a stronger interaction with the support according to the literature [36]. XPS measurements were carried out to obtain information on the surface chemical composition and the oxidation state of the ruthenium on the surface. The Ru 3d, Ru 3p, Zr 3d, P 2p, Al 2p and O 1s core levels spectra were analysed. Table 4 shows the binding energies (BE) of the photoemissions of the studied levels, as well as the deconvoluted signals of Ru 3p and O 1s. For the calculation of the surface ratios as well as for the determination of the oxidation state of the ruthenium, the Ru 3p region was considered since the Ru 3d signal overlaps with that of C 1s. The spectra corresponding to the Ru 3p region of the analyzed catalysts presented a slight asymmetry and the FWHM was greater than 3.3 eV (Fig. 6 ). Therefore, this signal was deconvoluted into several contributions associated with the presence of ruthenium species in different oxidation states, Ru(IV), Ru(III) and Ru(0) [37]. Table 4 shows the contribution of each oxidation state in parentheses. For all the catalysts, the predominant species is Ru(0). It is clearly seen that there is no strong influence of the support on the type of Ru species formed and that the reducing effect of zirconia is the predominant one. This result can be explained taking into account that, during the thermal treatment of the zirconia precursor to obtain the calcined ZrO2, the partial reduction of Zr4+ to Zr3+ occurs. The presence of Zr3+ generates an increase of anionic vacancies in the support, favouring the reducibility of the supported metallic species [38]. The XPS spectra of the catalysts in the Zr 3d core level region showed the Zr 3d 5/2 and Zr 3d 3/2 doublet, located at 182.2 and 184.6 eV, respectively (the spectra are presented in Supplementary Information, Figure S2(a)). Table 4 shows the B.E. of the most intense signal the Zr 3d 5/2 signal, which is present in the spectra of all the studied catalysts. This signal is associated to the presence of Zr(IV) in ZrO2. In the samples with phosphate-modified supports, Ru/ZP and Ru/ZP-A, the Zr 3d 5/2 signal presented a small shift (ca. 0.4 eV) towards higher B.E. values, indicating that the presence of phosphate groups generate a slight energy change in the Zr-O bond. In this same sense, Testa et al. indicate that the presence of electrophilic species such as sulphate or phosphate groups, can modify the electronic density of Zr [39]. Phosphorus-containing samples show the signal associated with the P 2p core level, with B.E. around 134 eV (Figure S2(b)). The B.E. of this broad signal is found in the region where phosphorus species associated with the presence of PO4 3- tetrahedra emit. The fact that the signal is wide may be associated with amorphous compounds, as observed by XRD. Nevertheless, phosphate-containing salts present emissions at lower B.E. (132-133 eV) [40], therefore, the higher B.E. obtained could indicate that phosphorus species are interacting with zirconia. In addition, the B.E. of P 2p in Ru/ZP-A catalyst is slightly higher than that exhibited by Ru/ZP (Table 4), a result that can be attributed to the interaction between P and the other support components, Zr and Al. This explanation agrees with previously published results for alumina-pillared γ-zirconium phosphates [41]. The broad Al 2p signal located at 74.5 eV (Figure S2(c)) is typical of aluminium in Al2O3. Finally, the O 1s signal (Figure S2(d)) in the spectra of the zirconia and phosphated-zirconia supported samples (Ru/Z and Ru/ZP) was deconvoluted in three components, with B.E. around 530, 531, and 532–533 eV which are related to surface oxygen species with different chemical environments. The species with B.E. between 529 and 530 eV, are associated with the presence of lattice oxygen in ZrO2 and those in the 531-533 eV region, are associated with surface oxygen vacancies, oxygen-adsorbed species, surface hydroxyl, adsorbed water molecules, or carbonate species. The relative percentage of each oxygen-containing species is presented in Table 4. This deconvolution could not be carried out in the spectra of Ru/Z-A and Ru/ZP-A catalysts since the dominant signal is that of the oxygen in alumina, located at 532 eV. The results of the surface composition of the catalysts obtained by XPS are gathered in Table 5 . It is noticeable the closer correlation between the nominal and surface ratio for Ru/Z catalyst (0.027 vs. 0.031). The low specific surface area of the Z support (24 m2/g) may explain such similar composition. However, for Ru/ZP catalyst, for which the support presents an even lower surface area (4 m2/g) this behavior is not observed, most probably because phosphate ions block the pores of the zirconia, exposing the metallic phase. When analysing Ru/Zr and Ru(0)/Zr surface ratios, it is observed that the catalysts Ru/Z-A and Ru/ZP-A present a higher concentration of ruthenium on the catalytic surface than Ru/Z and Ru/ZP catalysts, as measured by XPS. Clearly, the significant surface area of Z-A and ZP-A supports favours a higher availability of surface metallic ruthenium. In summary, among all the studied systems, Ru/ZP-A catalyst presented the highest surface concentration of ruthenium. This is a valuable feature when considering its use as catalyst in the hydrogenation of glucose and xylose."
8,Catalytic hydrogenation of glucose,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of glucose The aqueous phase hydrogenation of glucose was evaluated using all the prepared catalysts, Ru/A, Ru/Z, Ru/ZP, Ru/Z-A and Ru/ZP-A (Fig. 7 and Table 6 ). The experimental conditions selected in this work, T=90 °C and a constant H2 pressure of 1.25 MPa, are mild compared to those usually reported in the literature, in an effort to enhance the sustainability of the process [42 and references cited therein]. With constant Ru loading (3 wt.%) and under identical reaction conditions, but changing the support, the activity of the catalysts notably changed. Thus, Ru/ZP-A and Ru/Z-A reached higher conversions than Ru/A, Ru/Z and Ru/ZP catalysts. Two factors seem to play important roles in increasing the activity of the catalysts, the metallic particle size and the characteristics of the support. In this sense, although Ru/Z-A had a higher dispersion (64%, obtained from TEM measurements), Ru/ZP-A reached a higher initial velocity and TOF (Table 6). According to the results obtained by TEM, Ru/Z-A catalyst has smaller ruthenium particles (1.42 nm) than the Ru/ZP-A system (3.08 nm). In the literature, there are several papers that report the effect of the size of the ruthenium particles on the catalytic activity in hydrogenation reactions. Ruppert et al. proposed that Ru particles under 1 nm size would located in the pores of the support and therefore would be less available for the reaction [43]. This phenomenon would explain the results obtained in this work, which are reinforced by the XPS data presented in Table 5. In this table, it can be seen that the Ru(0)/Zr ratio is higher for the Ru/ZP-A than for the Ru/ZA catalyst, indicating the greater exposure of the active phase in the former. On the other hand, it can be seen in Table 3 that both Ru/A and Ru/ZP-A catalysts have similar particle diameter (2.85 nm and 3.08 nm, respectively) and hence, the conversion, initial rate and TOF values are quite higher for Ru/ZP-A catalyst. It can be said that the nature of the support is also playing a role in the catalytic performance. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the degree of catalyst disorder that increases with the addition of phosphorus facilitates the flow of hydrogen during the reaction, as previously published [44,45] In this sense, the amorphous characteristic of the ZP-A support analysed by XRD (Table 2) would agree with this observation. Regarding selectivity (Table 6), sorbitol was obtained as the main product for the five studied catalysts. No products associated with glucose dehydration reactions were observed. This can be explained on the basis of the mild experimental conditions employed in the present work. Lazaridis et al. [3] evaluated the performance of supported ruthenium catalysts at high reaction temperature (180 °C) and observed the appearance of many by-products, such as 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, arabinitol, meso-erythritol, glycerol and 1,2-propanediol. The most active catalyst analysed in the present paper, Ru/ZP-A, gave a selectivity towards sorbitol of 97%, with a small amount of mannitol observed as by-product. Mannitol is the hydrogenation product of fructose, that comes from the keto-enolic equilibrium with glucose. The acidic characteristic of the ZP-A support would favour this isomerization reaction."
9,Catalytic hydrogenation of xylose,"3.3 Catalytic hydrogenation of xylose The experimental conditions under which the tests were performed are the same as those used in the hydrogenation of glucose (T =90 °C, pH2 = 1.25 MPa, mass of xylose = 0.9 g, mass of catalyst =250 mg, water = 50 mL). This mild reaction conditions avoid the formation of xylonic acid, furfural and other by-products [23]. The catalytic results of the xylose hydrogenation for all the Ru catalysts tested in this work are presented in Fig. 8 and Table 7 . As a general trend, the catalysts were more active for the hydrogenation of xylose than for the hydrogenation of glucose. This result is associated with the higher reactivity of the furanic ring of xylose compared to the stability of the six-carbon atoms ring of glucose. Ru/A and Ru/ZP catalysts showed the lowest conversion values, in correspondence with their low degree of metal dispersion. Besides, Ru/Z (dispersion not measured) was the less active catalysts. The activity of the catalysts resulted highly dependent on the support and it could be related to the surface exposed metallic phase. Thus, Ru/ZP-A catalyst being the one with the highest Ru(0)/Zr ratio measured by XPS, 0.68, achieved a 99% conversion of xylose in the reaction time studied. On the other hand, the Ru/Z-A system showed an “anomalous” behaviour (as in the hydrogenation of glucose) for, having a high metal dispersion (64%) and a significant Ru(0)/Zr ratio (0.60 measured by XPS), only achieves a xylose conversion of 57% for the same period. As already mentioned when analysing glucose hydrogenation, this behaviour could be assigned to the fact that the very small ruthenium particles would not be available as active sites for the reaction since they would be located inside the pores of the support. The lower degree of reduction to zero oxidation state of the smaller Ru nanoparticles in Ru/Z-A could be also related with the very small size and higher interaction of these particles with the oxygen atoms of the support. The beneficial effect of phosphorus is another aspect to highlight. When comparing Ru/Z with Ru/ZP and Ru/Z-A with Ru/ZP-A catalysts, it is observed that the phosphated system outperforms the non-phosphated one, in both pairs of catalysts. This can be attributed to an electronic effect of phosphorus on zirconium, as observed by XPS, generating a site of higher Lewis acidity, favouring the activation of the carbonyl group of xylose that will be hydrogenated more quickly to xylitol. In addition, these phosphated catalysts were highly selective to xylitol. It is worth mention the outstanding performance of the Ru/ZP-A catalyst, since it allowed hydrogenating xylose up to 99% conversion with a selectivity to xylitol of 97.5%."
10,Conclusions,"In this paper, it has been shown that the efficiency of Ru catalysts for the hydrogenation of glucose and xylose in water under mild conditions (90 °C and 1.25 MPa H2) strongly depends on the nature of the support used. The best results were obtained when using an alumina-dispersed phosphated zirconia support (ZP-A). XRD, BET and TGA analysis showed that this solid had a high specific surface area with an amorphous character. These features contributed to achieve a support with an excellent performance. Ruthenium active phase impregnated on the prepared supports gave rise to catalysts with different characteristics. It was demonstrated that the catalytic activity (expressed as initial rate and TOF) was strongly correlated with the metallic particle size and the nature of the support. Among the systems studied in this work, Ru/ZP-A catalyst had the best performance both for glucose and xylose hydrogenation between due to a combination of facts: an adequate particle size (3.08 nm), a high surface exposure of the metallic species measured by XPS and a surface disorder due to the addition of phosphorus that enhances the flow of hydrogen during the reaction."
