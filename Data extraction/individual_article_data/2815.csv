0,Introduction,"Achieving 100% selectivity, the ultimate goal of a catalytic reaction, is to produce only one desired product at high turnover rates by reducing undesirable waste products [1,2]. Recent advances in colloidal chemistry enable the study of new catalytic reactions which are influenced by the size, shape, and composition of the nanoparticles and their surface-capping molecules [3–6]. By combining synthetically tailored nanoparticles and in situ characterization techniques, several molecular factors which affect catalytic turnover and selectivity have been shown the factors include the following: surface structure, composition, oxidation state, adsorbate mobility and adsorbate-induced restructuring, reaction intermediate, metal-support interaction, and charge transport [7]. Many studies show that size- and shape-controlled metallic nanoparticles supported onto mesoporous materials are responsible in changing catalytic selectivity [8–11]. The metal-support interaction, which refers to support-induced changes in reaction selectivity of metal nanoparticles, has been shown mostly on 2-dimensional (2-D) nanoparticle arrays on oxide substrates, because the oxide thin films and corresponding 2-D catalysts are easily prepared and characterized providing kinetic differences which invokes different mechanisms [12,13]. Although industrial catalysts are 3-dimensional (3-D) supported metals in a flow reactor, the effect on catalytic performance via the “support effect” is not very well understood. A choice of support is vitally important to improve catalytic selectivity, because a nanoparticle-based catalyst can induce reciprocal electronic or chemical interactions. Recent catalytic studies on hydrogenation reactions of aromatic ring molecules such as furan, pyrrole, and furfural demonstrated that these multipath reactions are “structure sensitive” [14–16], meaning the morphology of metal nanoparticles alters the reaction selectivity. In the hydrogenation reaction of furfural, an important intermediate in biomass conversion to generate biofuels [17] over Pt nanoparticles, the products were determined to form via two distinct reaction pathways: decarbonylation and carbonyl group hydrogenation. Recently, it was shown that on small sized Pt nanoparticles, furan was produced preponderantly by the decarbonylation, while larger particles yielded furfuryl alcohol [16]. As well as size, the shape of Pt nanoparticles affected the product selectivity. For instance, Pt nanooctahedra facilitated to generation of furfuryl alcohol through carbonyl group hydrogenation, whereas Pt nanocubes yielded an equal amount of furan and furfuryl alcohol. As an extension of previous works, herein we synthesized mesoporous oxides of SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 as supports through a soft-templating approach for the preparation of 3-D nanoparticle-based catalysts. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.9nm were loaded into the inner channels of mesoporous materials by the capillary inclusion. The vapor-phase hydrogenation reaction of furfural was conducted in 70torr furfural and 700torr H2 with a balance of He to study the effect of the different supports. For comparison, we also prepared 2-D catalysts composed of Pt nanoparticle monolayers deposited on oxide films and conducted furfural hydrogenation (1torr furfural, 100torr H2, and 659torr He) in a batch mode."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of mesoporous oxides,"2.1 Synthesis of mesoporous oxides All of the mesoporous oxides shown here were prepared through the soft-templating approach by utilizing self-assembled mesostructures of P123 [18]. Pluronic P123 ((EO)20(PO)70(EO)20, EO=ethylene oxide, PO=propylene oxide, Mw=∼5800), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%), aluminum(III) isopropoxide (>98%), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TIPO, >98%), niobium(V) chloride (>99%), tantalum(V) chloride (>99.8%), mesitylene (98%), and ammonium fluoride (>98%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Among mesoporous silicas, mesocellular-type MCF-17 was selected due to its large pore size of >50nm. For this synthesis, mesitylene was used as a pore swelling agent to be incorporated into ordered P123 frameworks [19]. 4g of mesitylene was added into a commercial polypropylene bottle containing 4g of P123, 10mL of concentrated HCl, and 65ml of water under vigorous stirring, and the sealed bottle was heated to 40°C. After being stirred for 2h at 40°C, 9.2mL of TEOS was added and further stirred for 5min. By stopping the magnetic stirring, the quiescent solution was aged at 40°C for 20h. After adding 46mg of NH4F, the bottle was aged hydrothermally at 100°C for 24h. The product was filtered, rinsed with water and ethanol, and calcined in air at 600°C for 6h to generate mesoporous silica MCF-17. For mesoporous Al2O3, 16.3g of aluminum isopropoxide dissolved in 12.8mL of concentrate nitric acid and 40mL of ethanol were added into 8.0g of P123 in 80mL of ethanol and the solution was stirred for 5h. The combined mixture was poured into Petri dishes and placed on a hot plate to allow slow evaporation of solvent at 45°C for 2days. For another 2days, the product was dried thoroughly in an oven at 60°C. After calcination in air at 900 °C for 4h, mesoporous Al2O3 with a γ-phase was obtained [20,21]. Mesoporous TiO2 was synthesized via a modified method of Zhao et al. [22]. For a typical synthesis, 3.6g of concentrated HCl was dropped into 2.0g of P123 and 60g of ethanol with vigorous stirring and the solution was heated to 40°C for 3h. 4.7g of TIPO and 0.8g of TEOS were added to the solution and maintained at 40°C for 5h. The reaction mixture transferred into Petri dishes was heated at 35°C for 2days on a hot plate and dried at 80°C for another 2days in an oven for slow evaporation of solvent. The calcination was performed at 400°C for 4h and 700°C for 4h. For mesoporous Nb2O5 and Ta2O5, metal precursor solutions were prepared separately by dissolving 5.4g of niobium chloride or 7.2g of tantalum chloride into 20mL of ethanol [23,24]. The metal solution was slowly added into 20mL of ethanol containing 2g of P123, and the solution was stirred for 5h. The evaporation steps were same as those of Al2O3. The resulting samples were calcined at 400°C for 4h."
3,Synthesis of PVP-capped Pt nanoparticles,"2.2 Synthesis of PVP-capped Pt nanoparticles PVP-stabilized Pt nanoparticles were synthesized using the established method with some modifications [25,26]. Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·xH2O, >99.9%) and PVP with a molecular weight of 55,000 were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. 0.3g of H2PtCl6·xH2O (0.75mmol) and 0.5g of PVP were added to 35ml of water and 70ml of ethanol in a 250ml three-necked flask, installed with a condenser, and the solution was refluxed around 100°C for 2.5h. The Pt nanoparticles, with 1.9nm of average diameter, were precipitated in the presence of excess acetone by centrifugation and re-dispersed in ethanol or chloroform. When 0.12g of H2PtCl6·xH2O and 0.5g of PVP were reacted in 10ml of ethylene glycol (Fischer Scientific) at 165°C for 1h, 4.6nm sized Pt nanoparticles were obtained."
4,Preparation of Pt nanoparticle catalysts supported on mesoporous oxides as 3-D catalysts,"2.3 Preparation of Pt nanoparticle catalysts supported on mesoporous oxides as 3-D catalysts The colloidal solution of PVP-capped Pt nanoparticles was mixed with mesoporous materials and sonicated for 3h at room temperature by a commercial ultrasonic cleaner (Branson, 1510R-MT, 70W, 42kHz). The precipitants were separated by centrifugation (3000rpm, 20min) and thoroughly washed with acetone and ethanol for 4 times to eliminate surfactant molecules. The supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts were obtained after drying at 80°C overnight."
5,Preparation of oxide films and 2-D Pt nanoparticle catalysts,"2.4 Preparation of oxide films and 2-D Pt nanoparticle catalysts Oxides substrates were prepared by electron beam evaporation [27]. Thin films of Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, and ZrO2 deposited on a SiO2 substrate by the electron beam evaporation were further oxidized to ensure reproducible stoichiometries at 500°C in oxygen. A SiO2 wafer with a thickness of 500nm was thermally grown as the SiO2 substrate. 4.6nm PVP-capped Pt nanoparticles were deposited on oxide films by Langmuir–Blodgett technique as a 2-D catalyst. In detail, a solution of dispersed Pt nanoparticles in chloroform was transferred to the water surface and compressed to form a monolayer by controlling a mobile barrier. Then, an oxide substrate, which was cleaned by Nochromix solution, was pulled out from the water to load a nanoparticle monolayer and dried [28]. Prior to reaction, PVP an organic capping molecule was removed by exposure to UV light in air. Two Hg lamps emitting 184 and 254nm were used as the UV source. They were positioned parallel with a gap of 2.5cm in a clean Al box, and the catalyst sample was placed 1.2cm below the lamps. By this treatment, not only direct photodecomposition of the PVP, but also oxidation of the PVP occurred by UV produced ozone [29]. As UV exposure time increased, photodecomposition of the PVP was enhanced. However, all catalysts shown here were treated for less than 3h under UV irradiation to avoid possible nanoparticle aggregation."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization Structural characterizations of Pt nanoparticles, mesoporous oxides, and corresponding catalysts were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM, a Hitachi H-7650) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 GADDS diffractometer using Co KR radiation (1.79Å)). The average particle diameter of Pt and its distribution histogram were obtained by counting 300 particles on TEM images. Nitrogen physisorption data were obtained on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 analyzer to determine the total surface area and pore volume of the mesoporous materials. Elemental analyses of the catalysts were conducted by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer optical emission spectrometer, Optima 7000 DV)."
7,Catalytic measurements,"2.6 Catalytic measurements As a 3-D model, the vapor-phase furfural hydrogenation reaction was conducted in a tubular plug-flow fixed catalyst bed reactor, which is positioned inside of a tubular three-zone furnace to control the temperature in the range of 25–650°C. 0.1–0.3g of supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts were diluted by quartz and loaded in the reactor bed. The loaded catalysts were reduced in a flow of 50vol.% mixture of H2 and N2 at 20 sccm total flow rate at 260°C for 2h. The liquid furfural was injected using a syringe pump (Kent Scientific) into the flow reactor with a rate of 0.4ml/h, at which furfural was evaporated and mixed with H2 at 20 sccm flow to be adjusted to 1:10 ratio of furfural/H2. Reaction products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (HP 5890 Series II) equipped with a 10m dimethylpolysiloxane (HP-1) capillary column with a flame ionization detector (FID). A detailed description for evaluating catalytic performance using the plug-flow micro reactor system was described in our previous reports [16]. 2-D catalysts composed of Pt nanoparticle monolayers on oxide films were evaluated in a batch mode reactor for furfural hydrogenation. The catalysts were placed in a chamber and heated to 120°C with a BN heater and mixed with 1torr furfural, 100torr H2, and 659torr He by a circulation pump. Products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID. Turnover frequencies (TOF’s) were calculated by the number of Pt active sites determined by ethylene hydrogenation. Experimental details and evaluations including the ethylene hydrogenation and TOF are specified in previous reports [27]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of mesoporous oxides and supported catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of mesoporous oxides and supported catalysts Mesoporous materials with a highly ordered structure were formed by a self-assembled supramolecular structure of a surfactant as a soft template [18]. Self-assembly between inorganic precursors and organic surfactants determines the mesostructures with a high surface area and a periodic arrangement of inner pores. For all of the mesoporous materials shown in this study, Pluronic P123 (poly(ethylene oxide)20-block-poly(propylene oxide)70-block-poly(ethylene oxide)20 triblock copolymer) was used as a soft template to direct the pore structures [30]. Although MCF-17 silica has cellular-type pore structures, through insertion of mesitylene, a pore swelling agent, into the organic frameworks of P123, mesoporous materials of Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 have hexagonally channeled pore structures (Fig. 1 ). One of the distinct features of MCF-17 compared with other nonsiliceous oxides is a condensation step which provides rigid organic polymerization and dense metal oxides via a sol–gel process. While MCF-17 was condensed under hydrothermal reaction in water, nonsiliceous oxides were prepared by a solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) in ethanol. The highly ordered pore structure with a hexagonal channel (p6mm) was determined by slow evaporation of alcoholic solvent from metal–organic mesostructures [18]. Fig. 2 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of mesoporous Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 prepared by the EISA. Although the Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 show broad peaks in the XRD, crystallographic phases of the porous wall of Al2O3 and TiO2 turned out to be highly crystalline γ-phase Al2O3 and anatase TiO2, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the physisorption parameters of the mesoporous materials, including BET surface area, pore size, and pore volume. In the case of TiO2 mesostructures, a small amount of a silica source was added to generate mesostructured TiO2–SiO2 composites with 80/20 of the Ti/Si ratio to enhance their crystallinity and thermal stability [22]. By a synchronous assembly of titanate and silicate precursors with P123, anatase TiO2 nanocrystals were uniformly embedded in the SiO2 walls to form the “bricked-mortar” frameworks, in which the amorphous silica played a role of a glue to link the TiO2 nanocrystals to improve the structural and thermal stability [22]. The size of TiO2 nanocrystals buried in the wall was ca. 6nm in the TEM image, which was accordance with the size measured by the Scherrer equation of the XRD. Pt nanoparticles were synthesized by the polyol process in the presence of PVP [25,26]. A TEM image and the corresponding size distribution histogram in Fig. 3 show that the Pt nanoparticles with a polyhedron shape are uniform in size with a 1.9nm average diameter. For the preparation of supported catalysts, PVP-capped Pt nanoparticles dispersed in ethanol were incorporated into the inner channels of mesoporous materials by low-power sonication (Fig. 4 a). Fig. 4 clearly shows that the Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the pores of mesoporous materials as a 3-D catalyst. The hydrophilic group of the PVP facilitates the loading of nanoparticles into the hydrophilic inner surface of the supports. Excess PVP, the capping molecule, can be removed after repeated washing with polar solvents and further removed during the pretreatment before catalytic reactions. The weight of the Pt metal loading was measured by ICP–OES."
10,Selectivity of furfural hydrogenation by the support effect,"3.2 Selectivity of furfural hydrogenation by the support effect The hydrogenation of furfural was carried out over Pt nanoparticles supported on various mesoporous oxides to study catalytic selectivity by support effects. There are two distinct reaction pathways of the vapor-phase furfural hydrogenation (Scheme 1 ). One pathway is the decarbonylation of the carbonyl group to generate furan, tetrahydrofuran, and propylene. The other is the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to produce furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, and 1,5-pentanediol [16]. Under the experimental conditions in the range of temperature 170–240°C, the reaction, catalyzed by supported Pt catalysts, produced three major products: furan, furfuryl alcohol, and 2-methyl furan (Scheme 1). Although ring hydrogenation as a secondary reaction yielded molecules with a saturated furan ring such as dihydrofuran, tetrahydrofuran, methyltetrahydrofuran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol as well as C1-3 hydrocarbon molecules through cracking of the aromatic ring and subsequent decarbonylation, the concentration of these by-products was determined to be less than 5% of the total reaction products. Previously, it was found that the size of Pt nanoparticles ranging from 1.5 to 7.1nm had a deminant influence on the product distribution obtained by vapor-phase furfural hydrogenation when they were supported on mesoporous silica, MCF-17 [16]. In Fig. 5 a, furan was a dominant product over 1.5nm Pt nanoparticles, while furfuryl alcohol, the hydrogenation product was preferential over larger particles. It is speculated that the nanoparticulate Pt has two different active sites which change in ratio with nanoparticle size and shape to induce either decarbonylation or hydrogenation of the carboxyl group. In Fig. 5b, the product selectivity is shown over 1.9nm sized Pt nanoparticles supported on mesoporous oxides in the temperature ranges of 170–240°C. When MCF-17 was used as a support to load 1.9nm sized Pt nanoparticles, the decarbonylation of furfural to furan was dominant, which is in accordance with the results as shown in Fig. 5a [16]. While the mesoporous silica is regarded as having a neutral surface, acidic oxides of Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 were expected to have synergetic effects between the Pt surface and acid sites of oxide surfaces. In Fig. 5b, when TiO2 and Nb2O5 were used as a support, the selectivity toward furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran via the carbonyl group hydrogenation was increased as much as 15%, while γ-Al2O3 and Ta2O5 were similar to those of MCF-17. In general, γ-Al2O3 is known to have Lewis acid sites on the surface; however, no significant change in selectivity was shown compared to the silica in this study. Interestingly, anatase TiO2 showed the highest selectivity in production of furfuryl alcohol (Table 2 ). It has been exhibited that Pt nanoparticles deposited on a TiO2 substrate as a 2-D catalyst lead to a 50-fold enhancement in the formation of furfuryl alcohol by an acid–base mechanism compared to those of a SiO2 substrate [27]. Sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy revealed the presence of a furfuryl-oxy intermediate on TiO2 during the reaction by a charge transfer interaction. The furfuryl-oxy intermediate as an active adsorbate favored the generation of furfuryl alcohol selectively on TiO2, in which O-vacancies on the surface proven to activate the formation of this intermediate via an electron transfer to the reactant [27]. Various oxide thin films were also prepared to study support effect on furfural hydrogenation. Oxide films of Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, ZrO2, and SiO2 prepared by electron beam evaporation were used as supports. A Langmuir–Blodgett film of 4.6nm Pt nanoparticles as an assembled monolayer was deposited on the oxide substrates as a 2-D catalyst (Fig 6 a). For a metal-support interaction between Pt and oxides, UV-ozone treatment was conducted for 3h to remove PVP capping molecules on the surface of nanoparticles. The furfuraldehyde hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a batch mode with 1torr furfural, 100torr H2 in a background of He at a total pressure of 1atm. In Fig. 6b, all supported 2-D catalysts with the exception of TiO2 exhibited low activity toward furfuryl alcohol as a function of the reaction time, which was in accordance with those of 3-D catalyst. Although the 2-D Pt/TiO2 induced in a huge selective change under batch mode catalysis, it was confirmed that mesoporous TiO2 is also responsible for the selectivity change toward furfuryl alcohol in a 3-D catalytic flow mode system. Based on current results of the vapor-phase furfural hydrogenation reactions, we conclude that the carbonyl group hydrogenation to generate furfuryl alcohol can be induced, as the size of Pt nanoparticles is increased and TiO2 is chosen as a support. The role of Pt/TiO2 is proven to enable H spillover to the active intermediate and therefore to change the product selectivity over not only a 2-D catalyst but also a 3-D supported catalyst."
11,Summary,"Mesoporous oxides of SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 were synthesized having large enough pore size to load Pt nanoparticles for the preparation of 3-D catalysts. Vapor-phase furfural hydrogenation reactions, in a flow mode system, were conducted on 1.9nm sized Pt nanoparticles supported on mesoporous oxides. The two major pathways exhibited in this study were generation of the furan and furfuryl alcohol through decarbonylation and hydrogenation of the carbonyl group, respectively. The mesoporous supports had little influence on the product distribution of furan and furfuryl alcohol formation during furfural hydrogenation, and the size of Pt nanoparticles showed a dominant influence on the product selectivity. Among highly crystalline oxide supports in this study, mesoporous anatase TiO2 showed the highest selectivity in the production of furfuryl alcohol. The same trend was also shown on 2-D Pt/TiO2 catalyst via its acid–base catalysis."
