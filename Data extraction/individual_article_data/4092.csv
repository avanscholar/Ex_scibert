0,Introduction,"Aniline compounds are used as intermediate compounds of agrochemicals, medicines, dyes and other useful compounds and they are derived from corresponding nitrobenzenes through reduction (hydrogenation). Metal catalysts such as nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) had mainly been used for hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes to anilines [1]. However, it is generally difficult to produce anilines having other functional groups such as chloro, bromo and acetyl groups from corresponding nitrobenzenes because metal catalysts simultaneously induce undesirable reactions such as elimination and hydrogenation of these groups. Therefore, other metal reducing reagents such as tin (Sn) [2], zinc (Zn) [3], iron (Fe) [4] and sodium hydrosulfite [5] have been used to produce anilines having reducible groups. These reagents only reduce the nitro group with other reducible groups being preserved. However, methods using these catalysts often produce harmful and undesirable wastes containing metal ions and acids, and an environmentally friendly catalytic process free from metal reducing reagents is therefore desired. A photocatalytic reaction is one of the most promising methods for hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes because it almost satisfies the 12 proposed requirements for green chemistry [6]. We have reported hydrogen gas (H2)-free and precious metal-free photocatalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes to anilines over titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2) in water in the presence of a hole scavenger [7,8]. When alcohol was used as the solvent, alcohol also acted as a hole scavenger [9]. In recent years, hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes has been used as a model reaction to evaluate whether newly developed photocatalysts can be applied for organic conversion or not [10–15]. We have also found that only the nitro group was hydrogenated over a TiO2 photocatalyst and that other reducible groups were preserved, i.e., a TiO2 photocatalyst has a high chemoselectivity in hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes [16–18]. It has been reported that catalytic chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes was achieved over supported gold and silver [19–22]. Since these metal catalysts require a high temperature and high pressure of H2 or carbon monoxide (CO), there is an obvious advantage of a photocatalytic process for hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes from the viewpoints of safety and energy consumption. The next strategy for photocatalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes to anilines is to utilize organic wastes as hydrogen (H) donors (electrons and protons). Photocatalytic degradation of organic wastes, in which organic wastes are oxidized by positive holes in the valence band of photocatalysts, has been extensively studied. The reaction is generally performed in air because active oxygen species (AOS) formed by electron-trapping of oxygen (O2) also contributes to the oxidation of organic wastes. Photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds in air is regarded as their oxidation with O2, in other words, reduction of O2 with organic compounds. Therefore, we reached the idea that organic wastes can be used as H donors (electrons and protons) for photocatalytic hydrogenation. Utilization of industrial wastes as H donors is environmentally and energetically favorable for the following reasons: 1) industrial wastes can be degraded during a photocatalytic reaction free from any removal and detoxifying processes and 2) photocatalytic hydrogenation can be achieved without any H sources (A large quantity of energy is required to produce the H source.). There have been some studies on photocatalytic H2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing of ammonia over various photocatalytic systems [23–27]. Those studies suggest that ammonia is one of the candidates for an H donor for photocatalytic hydrogenation, and photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide using ammonia as a sacrificial reagent has recently been reported [28]. Among various organic wastes, we were interested in methylamine because large amounts of methylamine are used for production of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, surfactants, aggregating agents and solvents and large amounts of wastewater containing methylamine are simultaneously produced. Methylamine dissolved in water is difficult to remove due to its high solubility (1080 g dm−3 at 20 °C). Since most photocatalysts are stable in water and efficiently work in aqueous media, this situation (methylamine in water) is favorable for photocatalytic reactions. In our previous paper, we reported photocatalytic H2 evolution from an aqueous solution of methylamine over metal-loaded TiO2 [23]. As far as we know, there has been no report on photocatalytic reduction of organic compounds utilizing methylamine as an H donor. Herein, we report H2-free hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes to anilines over a noble metal-free TiO2 photocatalyst in the presence of methylamine as an H donor at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure."

2,Chemicals,2.1 Chemicals Various nitrobenzenes and acetonitrile and methylamine with guaranteed reagent grades were used without further purification.
3,Photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzenes in water-acetonitrile suspensions of TiO2 under irradiation of UV light,"2.2 Photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzenes in water-acetonitrile suspensions of TiO2 under irradiation of UV light In a typical run, TiO2 powder (50 mg, MT-150A, Tayca, Osaka) was suspended in a water-acetonitrile solution (90:10) (5 cm3) containing m-nitroaniline (m-NA) (ca. 30 μmol, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka) and methylamine (100 μmol, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) in a test tube. The tube was sealed with a rubber septum under argon (Ar) and then photoirradiated at a wavelength > 300 nm by a high-pressure mercury arc (400 W, Eiko-sha, Osaka) with magnetic stirring at 298 K. After the reaction, the gas phase was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu, Kyoto) equipped with MS-5A columns. After the suspension had been filtered to remove the particles, the amounts of m-NA and the reduced product(s) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (UV-2075Plus detector and PU-2089Plus pump, Jasco, Tokyo) with an Inertsil ODS-3 column at 328 K (eluent: methanol:water = 40:60, flow rate: 0.7 cm3 min−1). The amounts of cationic compounds (methylamine and ammonia) and the amount of an anionic compound (hydrogen carbonate ion) were measured by ion chromatography (IC) (PU-2800 Plus, Jasco, Tokyo) with an IC YS-50 column (Shodex, Tokyo) and an IC NI-424 column (Shodex, Tokyo), respectively."
4,Competitive adsorption of m-NA and methylamine on TiO2 in a water-acetonitrile (90:10) medium,"2.3 Competitive adsorption of m-NA and methylamine on TiO2 in a water-acetonitrile (90:10) medium A TiO2 sample (200 mg) was suspended in 5 cm3 of water-acetonitrile solution containing m-NA (30 μmol) and methylamine (100 μmol) in a test tube, and the test tube was sealed with a rubber septum under argon. The test tube was magnetically stirred in a water bath continuously kept at 298 K for 24 h in the dark. After the suspension had been filtered to remove particles, the amounts of m-NA and methylamine in the liquid phase were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (UV-2075Plus detector and PU-2089Plus pump, Jasco) with an Inertsil ODS-3 column at 328 K (eluent: methanol:water = 40:60, flow rate: 0.7 cm3 min−1) and ion chromatography (IC) (PU-2800 Plus, Jasco) with an IC YS-50 column (Shodex), respectively."

6,Photocatalytic reduction of m-NA in a water-acetonitrile (90:10) suspension of TiO2 in the presence of methylamine,"3.1 Photocatalytic reduction of m-NA in a water-acetonitrile (90:10) suspension of TiO2 in the presence of methylamine Fig. 1 (a) shows time courses of the photocatalytic reduction of m-NA in a water-acetonitrile (90:10) suspension of TiO2 (MT-150A) under irradiation of UV light. The amount of m-NA monotonically decreased after irradiation of UV light, while m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA) was produced with the amount produced corresponding to the amount of m-NA consumed. When m-NA had been completely consumed after 6-h photoirradiation, m-PDA was obtained almost quantitatively. Various blank reactions (Table S1) revealed that TiO2, methylamine and photoirradiation are indispensable for the reduction of m-NA. These results indicate that methylamine works as a hydrogen source for reduction of m-NA to m-PDA over a TiO2 photocatalyst. Formation of m-PDA by six-electron reduction of m-NA is shown in Eq. 1. (1) H2NC6H4NO2 + 6e− + 6H+ → H2NC6H4NH2 + 2H2O. In order to understand the photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA, an indicator, i.e., material balance (MB), calculated by using Eq. (2) is also shown in Fig. 1(a). (2) MB = n( m ‐NA) + n( m ‐PDA) n 0 ( m ‐NA) where n(m-NA) and n(m-PDA) are the amounts of m-NA and m-PDA during the photocatalytic reaction, respectively, and n0(m-NA) is the amount of m-NA before the photocatalytic reaction. The value of MB was slightly smaller than unity in the initial stage and then became close to unity under further photoirradiation. This suggests that an intermediate(s) was formed during the reduction of m-NA to m-PDA. Since reduction of the nitro group to the amino group requires six electrons, two intermediates by two- and four-electron reduction of m-NA, i.e., a nitroso compound and a hydroxyl amine, may be formed during the photocatalytic reaction (Eq. 3). (3) However, these intermediates were not detected under the present conditions, suggesting that these intermediates were strongly adsorbed on the surface of TiO2. Recently, photocatalytic cyanomethylation of aromatic compounds in acetonitrile, in which acetonitrile was activated by positive holes of TiO2 and used as the reacting reagent, has been reported [29]. A value of MB close to unity at the end of the photocatalytic reaction in the present study means that no cyanomethylation of m-NA occurred and that methylamine effectively worked as a hole scavenger. In the photocatalytic decomposition of methylamine in an aqueous suspension of metal-loaded TiO2 [23], H2 was produced according to Eq. 4. (4) CH3NH2 + 3H2O → 3H2 + NH4 + + HCO3 −. Since a TiO2 photocatalyst requires a metal co-catalyst for continuous H2 evolution (reduction of protons with photogenerated electrons; 2H+ + 2e− → H2), no H2 gas was produced in this case, resulting in selective utilization of methylamine as the H donor for the reduction of a nitro group to an amine group. To understand the overall reaction, products formed by oxidation of methylamine were also analyzed and the results are shown in Fig. 1(b). The amount of methylamine monotonously decreased with photoirradiation time, while NH4 + and HCO3 − were observed in the liquid phase with almost the same ratio. Production of NH4 + and HCO3 − was consistent with the result of mineralization of methylamine shown in Eq. 4. However, the decrease in the amount of methylamine and the formation of NH4 + and HCO3 − in the liquid phase did not satisfy the stoichiometry. To reveal the reason for the gap, adsorption of methylamine on various TiO2 samples was evaluated and the results are shown in Figure S1. On MT-150A TiO2, 18 μmol of methylamine was adsorbed. This result means that the estimated amount of methylamine consumed in the photocatalytic reaction shown in Fig. 1(b) was estimated to be 42 μmol (=60 μmol – 18 μmol) and the amount of methylamine consumed under light irradiation was in agreement with yields of NH4 + and HCO3 −. Therefore, hole scavenging by methylamine is shown in Eq. 5. (5) CH3NH2 + 3H2O + 6h+ → 6H+ + NH4 + + HCO3 −. According to Eqs 1 and 5, photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA over TiO2 in the presence of methylamine is totally expressed as Eq. 6. (6) According to Eq. 6, yields of m-PDA and HCO3 − should be the same if the photocatalytic reaction occurred stoichiometrically. To confirm the stoichiometry of this reaction, the ratio of m-PDA to HCO3- (m-PDA/HCO3- ratio) was calculated from data in Fig. 1 and the results are shown at the top of Fig. 1(b). The values of the PDA/HCO3- ratio at the early stage were smaller than unity probably because of the formation of intermediates discussed above. After prolonged reaction time, the value became close to unity due to the decrease in the amount of intermediates. From these results, it can be concluded that the photocatalytic reaction occurred according to the stoichiometry shown in Eq. 6. An action spectrum obtained by using monochromatic light is useful for confirming that an observed reaction occurs by a photoinduced process. To obtain an action spectrum in this reduction system, reduction of m-NA in water-acetonitrile (90:10) suspensions of TiO2 was carried out at 298 K under irradiation of monochromatic visible light from a Xe lamp with a light width of ±15 nm using a multi-wavelength irradiation monochromator (MM-3PK, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd) and the light intensity determined with a spectroradiometer (USR-45D, Ushio Inc.). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at each centered wavelength of light was calculated from the ratio of the amount of PDA and the amount of incident photons by using Eq. 7. (7) A Q E = 6 × a m o u n t o f m ‐ P D A f o r m e d a m o u n t o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 As Fig. 2 shows, AQE measured at each wavelength was in good agreement with the absorption spectrum of TiO2, indicating that the reduction of m-NA in a water-acetonitrile (90:10) suspension was induced by photoabsorption of TiO2. The value of AQE at 320 nm reached 7.2%."
7,Effect of solvent composition in the water-acetonitrile system on photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA over TiO2,"3.2 Effect of solvent composition in the water-acetonitrile system on photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA over TiO2 Results of photocatalytic reduction of m-NA in water-acetonitrile solvents having various ratios are shown in Fig. 3 . In all cases, m-PDA was formed; however, the yields complexly changed and had two peaks. Only a small amount of m-PDA was obtained in acetonitrile. As shown in Eq. 6, this reaction requires water molecules, which is one of the reasons for the low yield of m-PDA under the water-free condition. However, this is not the sole reason because only a small increase in the yield was observed in the water-acetonitrile (10:90) solvent. The yield reached the first peak at 50:50, indicating that water has a positive effect on this reaction. Further increase in the water fraction decreased the yield at 70:30 and 80:20. Interestingly, the yield again increased and showed a peak at 90:10. After the second peak, the yield drastically decreased with further increase in the water fraction. This unique behavior was reproduced. In water, only a small amount of m-PDA was produced. The characteristic results indicate that the reaction medium had a large effect on the photocatalytic reaction and that a ratio of 90:10 is the optimum ratio for this photocatalytic reaction. Solubility of m-NA, methylamine, m-PDA, ammonia (or NH4 +) and CO2 (or HCO3 −) in the reaction medium is probably dependent on the water fraction in the reaction medium, which affects the stability of these compounds in the reaction medium. This means that adsorption of these compounds on the TiO2 surface is greatly affected by the water fraction in the reaction medium. To clarify the unique solvent effect on the photocatalytic reduction of m-NA, competitive adsorption of m-NA and methylamine on TiO2 was examined, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . A large amount of methylamine was adsorbed on TiO2. The amount of methylamine adsorbed decreased with increase in the water fraction in the reaction medium up to the ratio of 50:50 and was almost unchanged in the solvent having a water fraction of 50:50 or more (Fig. 4(a)). In contrast to the simple change in methylamine adsorption, the behavior of m-NA adsorption was unique as shown in Fig. 4(b). Since the behavior of m-NA adsorption was similar to that of the results of photocatalytic reduction of m-NA (Fig. 1), the yield of m-PDA was plotted against the amount of m-NA adsorbed on TiO2. As Fig. 5 shows, a linear correlation was observed between the amount of m-NA adsorbed and the m-PDA yield. This result indicates that the amount of m-NA decided the reduction of m-NA to m-PDA, although the m-NA adsorption was controlled by various factors. The linear correlation also suggests that surface reaction (reduction of m-NA) is the rate determining step. There is a possibility that produced m-PDA acts as the H donor because m-PDA is also one of amines. Since the amount of m-NA was much smaller than that of methyl amine adsorbed (Fig. 4), it is considered that the adsorption amount of m-PDA was also smaller than that of methyl amine and that m-PDA does not work as the H donor in this system. In addition, H donors only work when an electron acceptors are present in the reaction system. As shown in Fig. 1, the amount of m-PDA did not decrease after consumption of m-NA and the values of PDA/HCO3 − were eventually unity, indicating that not m-PDA but methylamine was selectively used as the H donor."
8,Effect of the type of amines on photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA,"3.3 Effect of the type of amines on photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA We checked whether other amines can be used as hole scavengers for the reduction of m-NA to m-PDA over an MT-150A TiO2 photocatalyst under irradiation of UV light. Ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2), dimethylamine ((CH3)2NH) and triethylamine ((CH3CH2)3N) were used as hole scavengers instead of methylamine, and the results are shown in Table 1 . m-PDA was obtained in high yields after appropriate photoirradiation time, indicating that these amines can be used as H donors for the photocatalytic reduction of m-NA over TiO2 (Entries 2–4). Small reaction rates in the presence of ethylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine indicate that decomposition of these amines, especially the ethyl group of amines, was difficult. In contrast to the organic amines, m-NA was not reduced when ammonia was used instead of amines (Entry 5). Production of ammonia (ammonium ion) in the case of methylamine (Fig. 1b) shows that ammonia is not used as a hydrogen source for reduction of m-NA probably due to the high stability of ammonia. When methanol, which is known to be an excellent hole scavenger, was used, m-PDA was produced with a high yield in a short photoirradiation time (Entry 6). The effect of the amount of methylamine on photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA (Figure S2) was also examined, indicating that the reaction rate (m-PDA yield) increased with the increase in the amount of methylamine. According to Eq. 6, the minimum amount of methylamine is equimolar of m-NA. This result also means that the amount of methyl amine can be decreased if necessary."
9,Effects of different kinds of TiO2 on photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA,"3.4 Effects of different kinds of TiO2 on photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA Various commercial TiO2 samples were used for photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA in water-acetonitrile (90:10) solutions containing methylamine, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . The TiO2 samples were Japan Reference Catalysts registered at the Catalysis Society of Japan (JRC-TIO series) and MT-150A TiO2, which was mainly used in this study. In all cases, m-NA was reduced to m-PDA. Among the samples, TiO2 samples having the rutile phase (Entries 7 and 8) produced m-PDA with a high selectivity, whereas TiO2 samples having the anatase phase (Entries 1–6) exhibited smaller m-PDA selectivity. The results suggest that the rutile phase is appropriate for the reduction of m-NA to m-PDA. In photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene in the presence of other hole scavengers, a similar tendency was observed [9]. One of the major differences between anatase-type TiO2 and rutile-type TiO2 is the position of the conduction band (−0.3 V in anatase and 0 V in rutile vs. SHE). Anatase-type TiO2 samples may induce another reductive reaction that cannot be induced by electrons in the conduction band of rutile-type TiO2. A durability test of a (photo)catalyst is very important for its practical applications. To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 after the photocatalytic reduction of m-NA to m-PDA, TiO2 powder was recovered from the reaction mixture with filter paper and washed with distilled water and then used repeatedly for the same reaction. As shown in Entries 9–11 of Table 2, TiO2 showed a high selectivity in the second and third reactions, although the reaction rate slightly decreased."
10,Applicability of photocatalyst reduction of nitrobenzenes with methylamine,"3.5 Applicability of photocatalyst reduction of nitrobenzenes with methylamine Photocatalytic reduction of the nitro group to an amino group utilizing methylamine as an H source was expanded to chemoselective conversion of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) having a reducible chlorine group. Fig. 6 shows time courses of p-CNB and p-chloroaniline (p-CAN) in water-acetonitrile (90:10) suspensions of TiO2 (MT-150A) under irradiation of UV light. The amount of p-CNB monotonically decreased with photoirradiation, while p-CAN as the reduced product of p-CNB was formed with the amount of formed corresponding to the conversion of p-CNB. When p-CNB had been almost completely consumed, p-CAN was obtained almost quantitatively (> 99% yield). The high yield of p-CAN means that only the nitro group was converted to an amine group without elimination of the Cl group. During the UV light irradiation and even after consumption of p-CNB, nitrobenzene (NB) and aniline (AN) were not detected, indicating that a TiO2 photocatalytic system utilizing methylamine as an H donor induced no dechlorination of p-CNB and no subsequent reduction of NB to AN, resulting in almost complete chemoselectivity. In order to check the high activity of TiO2 for reduction of a nitro group to an amine group under irradiation of UV light, various nitrobenzenes were used as substrates and the results are shown in Table 3 . First, NB free from other functional groups was reduced to AN with high levels of conversion and selectivity (Entry 1). As well as m-NA, p-nitroaniline was converted to p-phenylendiamine with high selectivity (Entries 2 and 3). When m- and p-nitroacetophenones were used as substrates, only the nitro group was converted to an amine group with the acetyl group being preserved, resulting in the formation of m- and p-aminoacetophenones (Entries 4 and 5). To reveal the slightly small selectivity (yield) of aminoacetophenones, adsorption experiments of aminoacetophenones was examined, indicating that these compounds were adsorbed on the surface of TiO2. In addition, the color of powder changed to pale yellow. These results indicate that the slightly small selectivity was caused by adsorption of main products on the surface of TiO2. Fig. 6 and Table 3 show the wide scope of a TiO2 photocatalyst for reduction of the nitro group to an amino group utilizing CH3NH2 as an H donor without the use of a protecting process, metal elements and reducing gases such as H2."
11,Conclusions,"This study revealed that methylamine and related compounds worked as H donors for photocatalytic hydrogenation of the nitro groups of nitroanilines and nitrobenzenes having reducible groups under a noble metal-free condition at room temperature. The methyl group of methylamine was oxidized, resulting in the formation of carbonate, while the amino group was preserved as ammonium ions in the reaction media due to the high stability. Stoichiometry of the photocatalytic reaction is expressed as follows: Solvent composition in the water-acetonitrile system had a great effect on photocatalytic hydrogenation of the nitro group. The amount of substrate adsorbed on TiO2 changed depending on the solvent composition, and a linear correlation was observed between the amount of m-nitroaniline adsorbed and the m-phenylenediamine yield."
