0,Introduction,"The quest for the production of direct hydrocarbon fuels from renewable resources has been on the rise, and bio-oils that are produced by fast pyrolysis of biomass are promising intermediates for the production of advanced hydrocarbon biofuels [1]. However, it is well known that fast pyrolysis bio-oil has several undesirable properties, such as high acidity and thermal instability, due primarily to the many oxygenated compounds like acids, phenols, aldehydes, ketones and unsaturated compounds that it comprises. These barriers have limited the effectiveness of various post-process upgrading technologies capable of converting unstable bio-oils to fungible fuels. Hydrodeoxygenation has been the most considered process to upgrade crude bio-oil [2,3]. The thermal instability of pyrolysis oil limits the effectiveness of most hydrodeoxygenation processes. To date, the best performing HDO systems employed for the upgrading of fast pyrolysis oils are those that are performed in multiple stages, in which the first stages usually involve a stabilization step, whereby a mild hydrogenation is performed to decrease the concentration of the most reactive components [4–10]. Reactions that occur in the stabilization steps typically include the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alcohols and the reduction of unsaturated carbon–carbon double bonds found in pyrolysis oils. Doing so provides the bio-oils with a level of thermal stability that improves the performance of the higher temperature second stage processes involving the main HDO reactions. While this multistage approach has been the most viable pyrolysis oil upgrading technology reported in the open literature, catalyst lifetimes that allow for economically feasible performance have not been realized thus far [11–13]. Because of these limitations, there has been great interest in developing processes where oxygen is released from the carbon framework of the biomass during the pyrolysis step. The goal is to produce thermally stable pyrolysis oils which require only a lesser degree of upgrading to be considered as fungible fuels or refinery blendstocks. Two processes that produce stabilized deoxygenated pyrolysis oil are 1) catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) [14–21] over zeolites such as HZSM-5 and 2) tail gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) [1,22,23]. In both of these processes, a large fraction of the remaining oxygen in the pyrolysis oil mixtures is in the form of alkyl phenols. Phenols are weakly acidic and not readily subject to direct deoxygenation due to the relatively strong aromatic C–O bond. We therefore chose to investigate means of upgrading alkyl phenols to their corresponding, more chemically benign, alcohols or deoxygenated products using p-cresol as a model compound. 4-Methylcyclohexanol, 4-methylcyclohexanone, methyl-cyclohexane and toluene or a mixture of all can be efficiently produced from p-cresol when hydrogen is applied as a reductant over carbon and alumina supported Pt, Pd and Ru catalysts under high pressure and high temperature [24]. Non-noble metal catalysts such as Ni–P [25], copper chromite [26], MoP and MoS [27] have been applied as well. Transfer hydrogenation, an in-situ condensed-phase upgrading method using compounds capable of facilitating hydrogen transfer without external use of hydrogen, has been reported in the literature [13–22]. Transfer hydrogenation offers the advantages of avoiding the use of molecular hydrogen (which is often sourced from fossil fuels) and it also offers the possibility of sourcing hydrogen from water-soluble oxygenates that are found in the low value aqueous phases of pyrolysis oil [1,15]. In one report, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of bio-derived compounds such as phenol to more stable and saturated alcohols was carried out using formic acid over a Pd catalyst [28]. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation with alcohols as hydrogen donors has also been investigated under application of different catalysts such as Ni/Fe2O3, Cu/Fe2O3 and Pd/Fe2O3, Ru/C and Raney Ni and Co for bio-derived compounds [29–31]. Organic compounds such as acetic acid and isopropanol as the model hydrogen donors have been used previously in transfer hydrogenation reactions [28–33]. Although complete deoxygenation has proven difficult with transfer hydrogenation processes, it is possible that transfer hydrogen reactions could serve as an alternative to the initial hydrogenation/stabilization step of the upgrading process described above. Furthermore, stable oxygenates may have other uses like improving the combustion properties of fuels [34]. Some oxygenated organics such as ethanol, butanol and biodiesel have been applied as transportation fuel additives for this purpose. The bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst systems are active for both hydrogen production and in-situ transfer hydrogenation, making them good candidates to achieve the desired transfer hydrogenation reactions [35]. Ni–Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst applied for transfer hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol using isopropanol as hydrogen donor. Herein, we report the reduction of p-cresol over Ni–Cu catalyst using transfer hydrogenation, with isopropanol being identified as a good hydrogen donor for this conversion. In addition to p-cresol we also chose to examine furfural as a model compound for expanding the scope of the reduction conditions to include carbonyl to alcohol transformations [29–31] and because furfural is a common component of biomass pyrolysis oils. Furthermore, we report initial testing of the optimized conditions to “regular” (i.e., produced via traditional fast pyrolysis) and TGRP bio-oils."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, γ-Al2O3, activated carbon, p-cresol, furfural and isopropanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (>99.9%). The bio-oils used in this study were obtained from the ARS continuous fluidized bed pyrolysis unit operating at 500°C. Briefly, the ARS pyrolysis system is a bubbling fluidized bed of sand described previously by Boateng et al. [36] that employs a cyclone for char removal, and a series of condensers along with an electrostatic precipitator for pyrolysis liquids collected. This pyrolysis reactor was modified for operation on recycled tail gas by including a regenerative blower with an inlet port connected to the ESP outlet to return ESP tail gases to the fluidized bed plenum upon reheating through an electric heater as previously described [1]."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of model bio-oil compounds and TGRP bio-oils was studied using mono and bimetallic Ni–Cu catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and carbon at 10wt.% metal loading. The metals were loaded by wet impregnation of the support with aqueous solutions of the metal salts Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. The required amounts of metal precursors (4.954g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.801g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dissolved in 8.75mL of deionized water. Then, this aqueous solution was added drop-wise to the suspension of the alumina or carbon supports (8g in 8mL deionized water). The solid suspensions were heated to 80°C until excess water was evaporated. Then, the alumina supported catalysts were calcined in air and carbon supported catalyst was calcined in nitrogen at 500°C for 5h in a porcelain crucible. The catalysts were designated as Ni/Al2O3, Cu/Al2O3, Ni–Cu/Al2O3 and Ni–Cu/C. Catalysts were reduced prior to use as described below."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The metal composition of all catalysts was estimated using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific, iCAP 6300 series, ICP spectrometer). The sample for ICP-OES analysis was prepared in the following procedure. Typically, the desired amount of catalyst (25mg) was dissolved in 2mL of HNO3 and then treated by acid digestion at 130°C for 2h followed by dilution with water to get 5wt.% HNO3. All catalysts were reduced at 320°C for 2h, then characterized using different analytical techniques. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of reduced catalysts were recorded on a Rigaku Miniflex (M/s. Rigaku Corporation, Japan). The X-ray diffractometer operated with Ni filters, Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406A°), scan speed of 2°min−1 and scan range of 2–80° at 30kV and 50mA. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the calcined catalysts are generated using a Micromeritics Autochem AC2920 apparatus. The TPR of catalysts was carried out under a 50mL/min gas flow of 5vol.% hydrogen in argon, at a heating rate of 10°C/min from room temperature to 800°C. The consumption was monitored by a calibrated thermal conductivity detector. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out using a Philips CM12 Transmission Electron Microscope in order to determine the metal particle size of catalysts. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA Q500) in the presence of air in order to find out the carbon content of reduced and spent Al2O3 supported catalysts."
5,Hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation,"2.4 Hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation Transfer hydrogenation was carried out in a 100mL Parr reactor (Parr series 4598, Parr Instrument Company, USA). The reaction pressure and temperature were monitored in a Parr 4848B controller during the reaction. Typically, all the catalysts were activated before the reaction by reducing under hydrogen (15bar) at 320°C for 2h in the reactor. The reactor was then allowed to cool to room temperature before opening the reactor and adding the model compounds/bio-oil solution along with hydrogen donor and any solvent. The system was purged with nitrogen to remove the air from the reactor and pressurized with hydrogen or nitrogen as appropriate. The temperature of the reactor was controlled by a temperature controller, and the stirring speed was maintained at 800rpm for the duration of the reaction. The reaction time was considered started when the reactor reached the desired reaction temperature and continued for 4h. Temperature (for 300°C) was reached after 45–55min. After finishing the reaction time, the reactor was then cooled down to room temperature using cold water. During depressurization a sample gas from the post-run atmosphere was collected in a gas bag to quantify gaseous products from bio-oil. The reaction mixture was then filtered using a 0.45μm filter, in order to separate the catalyst from the product mixture."
6,Product characterization,"2.5 Product characterization The products of all experiments pre- and post-transfer hydrogenation including model compounds and bio-oil were characterized by GC/MS by Shimadzu GC/MS QP-2010 system using a DB-1701 column (60m×0.25mm, 0.25μm). The GC split ratio was set as 30:1, the injector temperature was 250°C, and injection volume of 10μL was used. The temperature program protocol for the oven was 45°C for 4min., followed by heating at 3°C/min to 280°C using helium as a carrier gas. GC/MS analyses of samples were prepared as acetone solutions. The internal standard method was used for quantification of individual compounds (starting materials and products). Response factors relative to the internal standard, fluoranthene, were determined using authentic compounds (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). Pyrolysis oil from switchgrass and oak produced by TGRP were characterized before and after the transfer hydrogenation with isopropanol. The water content of the bio-oils was determined by Karl-Fischer titration using Hydranal titrant composite 5. The total acid number (TAN) was determined using a Mettler T70 autotitrator using 0.1M KOH in isopropanol as the titrant and wet ethanol as the titration solvent. The heating value of bio-oils was measured by using a Leco AC 600 bomb calorimeter. The CHNS analysis was determined using a Thermo EA1112, and oxygen was determined by difference. GC/MS analysis was performed as described above. All analyses were carried out three times, and the average values are provided."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The metal composition from ICP-OES and crystallinity of mono- and bi-metallic Ni and Cu calculated using Debye–Scherrer equation is tabulated in Table 1 . As shown in the table, the crystallinity of nickel is smaller for monometallic Ni than for bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst, with similar results observed for the crystallinity of copper on the Al2O3 support. For the carbon supported catalyst the crystallinity of copper was lower than in those on Al2O3. The higher crystallinity of bimetallic Ni and Cu system is mainly due to the interactions of copper, nickel and alumina phases, possibly indicating the formation of a Ni–Cu alloy eutectic formation. The formation of Ni–Cu alloy has been previously reported by Ardiyanti et al. with δ-Al2O3 supported Ni–Cu catalysts [35]. The obtained XRD patterns of reduced Ni, Cu and Ni–Cu catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The reflections at 2θ=66.7° indicate a well-dispersed alumina phase in all Ni, Cu and Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. In the Ni–Cu/C catalysts, both NiO and CuO were fully reduced to metallic nickel and copper. However, there were very low diffraction peaks for Ni–Cu alloy suggesting that the catalysts might be re-oxidized when they were exposed to air after the reduction and/or that those metal oxide crystallite species might be present either in amorphous form or below 4nm size and could not be identified by the XRD. The formation of Ni–Cu alloy over graphite has been shown elsewhere in recent studies [37,38]. In the present study, the bimetallic Ni–Cu catalysts over alumina and carbon show two additional peaks at 2θ of 45.4 and 50.7° which may indicate the formation of Ni–Cu alloy phase in the reduced catalysts along with mono-metallic copper and nickel phases. This phenomenon was evident as per the TPR profiles (discussed later) that show that the presence of copper oxide does not apparently modify the reduction behavior of the nickel oxide [37]. The reduction behaviors of the supported pre-catalysts were determined with TPR (Fig. 2 ). The TPR profile of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst shows a very broad peak at 400°C and continued up to 600°C with a low intensity peak around 410°C. The low intensity TPR peak almost combined with the major peak (Tmax at 550°C) and was indistinguishable from the main peak, which likely indicates the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) species and the high temperature TPR signal corresponding to the reduction of NiAl2O4 species [37,39,40]. For the monometallic Cu catalyst, three TPR signals are observed Tmax at 200, 250 and 350°C. Likewise, the first two lower temperature TPR signals correspond to a reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and reduction of Cu(I) to Cu(0) species while the high temperature TPR signal indicates the reduction of bulk copper oxide [41]. The TPR curves of the mono- and bi-metallic catalysts differ considerably and show that the bimetallic catalyst is more readily reduced than the monometallic NiO. The TPR response of the bimetallic catalyst also shows two sharp peaks at temperatures below 250°C. This indicates that the reduction of Ni is enhanced with Cu that leads to an easier reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0). A.R. Ardiyanti et al. reported about TPR of Ni–Cu/δ-Al2O3 and observed three different reduction peaks corresponding to three different reduction species [35]. The baseline seems to change with increasing temperature to a certain extent in Ni catalysts which is expected in Ni based catalysts [39,40]. Ni–Cu/C catalyst has three major hydrogen consumption peaks at 190, 380 and 550°C respectively. The low temperature TPR peak corresponds to reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(0). The latter two high temperature TPR peaks indicate the reduction of surface and bulk reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0), respectively [37]. As per the TPR results, the reduction temperature for catalysts appears to be fixed at 320°C. The particle size distribution of reduced (320°C for 2h under a hydrogen pressure of 15bar) mono- and bi-metallic Ni and Cu/Al2O3 (reduced and spent) was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the representative images are shown in Fig. 3 . The reduced mono-and bi-metallic samples show a uniform distribution of particles on the surface of Al2O3 (Fig. 3a–c). As shown from the XRD analysis the nickel particles in the monometallic catalyst have a crystallite size of 3.1nm (Table 1). For the monometallic copper on alumina the crystallite size is 47.3nm. In the bimetallic catalysts the nickel crystallite size (7.1 to 8.0 for Al2O3 and C supports respectively) is smaller than copper crystallite size but larger than monometallic nickel catalysts which confirmed the metal support reactions. The TEM images of all alumina catalysts indicate that most particles are less than 20nm diameter. The carbon supported bimetallic Ni–Cu catalysts show the smallest crystallite size of copper among all catalysts and nickel crystallite size is nearly the same as bimetallic alumina catalysts and these nano-sized compounds are initiated to work on transfer hydrogenation over p-cresol and bio-oil upgrading."
9,Reduction of bio-oil model compounds,"3.2 Reduction of bio-oil model compounds 3.2.1 Aqueous phase reduction of p-cresol using H2 Initially, to compare the activities of the alumina supported mono- and bi-metallic Ni and Cu catalysts, the hydrogenation of p-cresol was conducted using molecular H2 as a reductant. The reduction activities of the catalyst studied herein follow in the order of Ni/Al2O3 >Ni–Cu/Al2O3 >>Cu/Al2O3 (Table 2 ). Both the Ni/Al2O3 and bimetallic Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts provided moderate conversions (about 50mol%) and yields of the reduced products. In this case, the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was slightly more effective than the bimetallic catalyst contributing to total desired product yields of 41mol% and 32mol% respectively. The major product of this reaction, 4-methylcyclohexanol, is produced by hydrogenation of the aromatic ring. Also observed are some methylcyclohexene and methylcyclohexane, products that are likely derived from dehydration and subsequent hydrogenation (in the case of methylcyclohexane) after formation of the 4-methylcyclohexanol. Additionally, a small amount of toluene, which is formed from net hydrogenolysis of the C–O bond without hydrogenation of the aromatic ring, is also observed. However, the results of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–Cu/Al2O3 indicated that the catalysts are active for more HD and less for HDO under hydrogen pressure. The use of monometallic Cu/Al2O3 as the catalyst for aqueous phase reactions resulted in high p-cresol conversion but the production of reduced products was very limited with most of the resultant mixture consisting of unidentifiable products (not shown in the table). The low activity of the Cu catalyst for reduction using H2 was expected. Cu was incorporated to activate the hydrogen donor molecules for the transfer hydrogenation reactions discussed below. Contrasting these results is previously reported work on cresol reduction that has shown that the aqueous phase hydrogenation of p-cresol over non-noble metal catalysts such as bimetallic Ni–Mo/Al2O3, Ni–W/Al2O3 and Co–Mo/Al2O3 is very difficult, with only very low conversions achieved (<3%) [24]. The results of hydrogenation of guaiacol as a bio-oil model compound have shown low yields of reduced products in the presence of water over Ni–Mo/Al2O3 catalyst [42]. Only a recent study conducted by Savage et al. [43] reported effective reduction of o-cresol under more severe reaction conditions (supercritical water at 380°C 305bar H2) over Raney Ni–Cu catalysts. They found the Ni–Cu catalyst to exhibit stability and produce more deoxygenated products. 3.2.2 Transfer hydrogenation 3.2.2.1 Transfer hydrogenation of p-cresol After verifying that the catalysts were active for hydrogenation reactions, the development of the transfer hydrogenation reaction began. Initially, the aqueous phase TH of p-cresol using acetic acid as the hydrogen donor was attempted. Although acetic acid has only been shown to be an effective hydrogen donor in limited cases [32], its use was tested because of its ubiquitous undesired presence in bio-oil and bio-oil aqueous phase byproducts. Unfortunately, these attempts were mostly unsuccessful (data not shown) in water or organic solvents (e.g., methanol or hexane) with the only observable reactions being condensation of cresol with acetic acid (producing 4-methylphenylacetate) or with solvent (producing 4-methylanisole in case of methanol solvent). Therefore the transfer hydrogenation of p-cresol was attempted with a more active hydrogen donor, isopropanol and results are tabulated in Table 3 . The mono- and bi-metallic catalysts were tested along with the Al2O3 support alone as a control. As Table 3 indicates, in neat isopropanol only trace amounts of reduction activity were found in the presence of Al2O3 alone or over Cu/Al2O3; only the condensation of p-cresol with isopropanol was observed yielding 4-isopropoxytoluene. Likewise, reduction of p-cresol does occur over Ni/Al2O3, but excellent yields of the desired products are only achieved over the bimetallic Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. In this case >95% yield of the desired product mixture was achieved, with >80% yield of 4-methylcyclohexanol. We summarize the reactivity of this system with the various catalysts in Scheme 1 . The sequential transformation of p-cresol to the major product, 4-methylcyclohexanol, and its subsequent deoxygenation to 4-methylcyclohexane is also observed over Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–Cu/Al2O3. This is supported by the fact that most hydrodeoxygenation catalysts possess two active sites including a metal center that dissociates hydrogen to catalyze hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis and an acid group (in this case provided by the Al2O3) that performs dehydration. The prevalence of ring hydrogenation products may be explained by the tendency of p-cresol to coordinate to Ni–Cu/Al2O3 through the π-system of the aromatic ring [29]. The trend in catalytic activity as a function of the morphology of Ni particles is a result of the interaction with copper and alumina. In monometallic nickel catalyst, Ni is more easily surface oxidized without the presence of Cu. As shown above, activity is maintained in the monometallic Ni under H2 because of the strong reducing environment, but without H2 it becomes more easily oxidized without the presence of Cu to stabilize the Ni(0) state. This is consistent with our findings that the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is the best performer in terms of activity for the reduction of p-cresol. The Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyzed transfer hydrogenations of p-cresol using isopropanol were then expanded to aqueous environments by investigating the use of water as co-solvent (Table 3). The results indicate that transfer hydrogenation process is still active in the presence of water, but the activity decreases with increasing water concentration. At the highest concentration of water used (1/7 ratio of isopropanol/water) there was about 35% conversion of p-cresol with a 4-methylcyclohexanol yield of about 15%. Interestingly, as the water concentration was increased, the selectivity for the ketone product (4-methylcyclohexanone) increased, resulting in about 16% yield at the highest water loadings. Decreasing the water concentration increases p-cresol conversion and 4-methylcyclohexanol yield with the best results obtained in the absence of water. In this case, >95% of the desired reduction products were achieved with high selectivity for 4-methyl cyclohexanol. Although the yield of the desired mixture was decreased by the presence of significant amounts of water (25% or more of solvent), the significant activity maintained in the presence of water suggests that the process may be useful for use in biomass pyrolysis oils which will contain water even if separated from their aqueous phases in TGRP or CFP processes [1,14,22]. Next we aimed to further optimize the conditions for transfer hydrogenation of p-cresol by examining the role of the catalyst support. For this the Ni–Cu catalyzed reaction was carried out with a more inert support, carbon (Table 3). To elucidate the effect of support, we studied the carbon supported Ni–Cu with commercially available carbon supported noble metal catalysts for comparison. While transfer hydrogenation of p-cresol has been successfully performed over carbon supported noble metal catalysts work on transfer hydrogenation studies of bio-oil model compounds over Ni–Cu catalysts is limited. Compared with the Al2O3, the reduced acidity available on the carbon support did suppress the dehydration activity, leading to higher selectivity for 4-methylcyclohexanol. However, the activity was also decreased; the yield of the entire desired product mixture and 4-methylcyclohexanol itself was higher in the case of the Al2O3 supported catalyst. The present study shows that the Pt/C showed superior activity for reduction of p-cresol compared with Pd/C, Ru/C, Ni–Cu/C, or Ni–Cu/Al2O it also yielded a significant amount of the deoxygenated product 4-methylcyclohexane (about 30mol% yield), decreasing the selectivity for 4-methylcyclohexanol. The Ni–Cu/C outperformed the carbon supported noble metal catalysts in providing the higher p-cresol conversion and higher 4-methylcyclohexanol yield, but the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was superior in producing the highest conversions and yield of the desired reduced mixture. The lower crystallinity of metals and metal–support interactions could be attributed to the different activity and selectivity of the desired product. We do not confirm the exact reason of the activity and study is under progress. The ICP-OES analysis of bimetallic samples showed higher metal content in carbon supported sample than that of alumina catalyst. It is supported to the strong metal–support interactions which lead to the formation of more stable metallic aluminates (Ni Al2O4) those are not soluble using the digestion procedure chosen for ICP analysis. 3.2.3 Transfer hydrogenation of furfural Because furfural is a representative member of a class of compounds known to be a major contributor to bio-oil instability, the utility of the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst to reduce furfural was explored next. However, the conditions that were optimized for p-cresol unfortunately were not effective for reduction of furfural. When reduction of furfural was attempted at 300°C, only an insoluble solid resultant of polymerization was observed [44]. Furthermore, when the reaction temperature was reduced from 300 to 200°C no transfer hydrogenation was observed in neat isopropanol or in an aqueous mixture (Table 4 ). The transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, shown below, was only successful in the presence of neat isopropanol over Ni–Cu/Al2O3 at 200°C. Under this reaction condition, the yield for furfuryl alcohol was high at about 95%. Previous reports have indicated that transfer hydrogenation of furfural over Pd, Cu and Ni on Fe2O3 [29] is difficult; the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 employed in this study was able to perform the reduction but under a limited set of conditions."
10,Upgrading of bio-oils,"3.3 Upgrading of bio-oils Initial testing of the optimized conditions for transfer hydrogenation of p-cresol for upgrading of partially deoxygenated and partially stabilized but alkyl phenol rich bio-oil was done using bio-oil produced via traditional methods and TGRP. “Regular” bio-oils from switchgrass (those produced from traditional fast pyrolysis methods) were treated using the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 and Ni/Cu–C catalyst in neat isopropanol at 300°C and the TGRP bio-oils were treated using Ni/Cu–C. The mass balance from the experiments is shown in Table 5 . The processes each yield about 50% recovery of liquid products, but this is likely underestimated due to loss of volatiles during the removal of isopropanol. This is the major source of the imbalance in the mass recoveries. For the “regular” bio-oils, organic liquid yield was higher and solid formation resulting from the thermal instability of the bio-oil was lower in the case of the C supported catalyst. Therefore, this catalyst was used in further studies involving the TGRP bio-oil. However, even using stabilized TGRP oils, polymerization of the bio-oil is still problematic as evidenced by solid formation. More solids were produced from the reaction of the switchgrass derived TGRP oils than from the oak TGRP derived oils, but the reason for the difference is not readily apparent. The upgraded TGRP oils exhibited higher H/C and lower O/C ratios, higher energy contents and lower acidity (Table 6 ). These observations are likely due to the desired transfer hydrogenation reactions and condensation reactions between components of the bio-oil. Deoxygenation was less prevalent in the “regular” oils despite the fact that they contained more oxygen prior to upgrading. Concentrations of some of the compounds, measured by GC/MS, in the bio-oil mixture before and after upgrading are presented in Table 7 . The acetic acid underwent esterification with the isopropanol to produce isopropyl acetate (found in the resultant aqueous phase), contributing to the reduction in total acid number (TAN) observed. Aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, xylenes) which are found in relatively high concentration in TGRP bio-oil are consumed, likely through hydrogenation of the rings. Interestingly, the alkyl phenols present in the bio-oil actually increased in concentration, even using conditions specifically developed for their conversion. This could be due to the depolymerization of lignin fragments found in the bio-oil into phenolic monomers under the reaction conditions. Direct products of cresol conversion (i.e., methyl cylclohexanols or methylcyclohexones) were only observed in the case of the regular bio-oils using NiCu/Al2O3. These products are not observed in reactions of TGRP bio-oils. The catalyst was characterized after its use for upgrading bio-oil. The TGA analysis of reduced and spent Ni–Cu/Al2O3 along with solid compounds was carried out in the presence of air with the results shown in Fig. 4 . The weight loss and the amount of carbon detected on the reduced catalyst are very low, indicating no decomposition of organic matter or carbon on the fresh catalyst. The TGA of the spent catalyst shows a high degree of decomposition between 450–500°C which indicates that the amount of carbon on the spent catalysts is higher than that of fresh catalysts. The maximum weight loss is about 50wt.% at 476°C, which could be attributed to the oxidation of solid products that are formed in the reaction or the formation of carbon. This carbon formation may suppress the activity of Ni–Cu/Al2O3 in forming hydrogenated products from bio-oil, and may explain the low conversion of the alkyl phenols in the TGRP bio-oil. Although improvements to the properties of the TGRP bio-oils were made, more work is necessary to transfer the results of the model compound study to use in real pyrolysis oil. This is an area of ongoing research. One possibility is to apply the conditions to an alkyl phenol rich fraction of TGRP pyrolysis oil rather than to the whole oil. Separation of TGRP bio-oils via distillation into hydrocarbon and phenolic rich fractions is enabled by their superior thermal stability compared with traditional bio-oils, and this has been recently demonstrated [23]."
11,Conclusions,"A high yielding catalytic system for the reduction of the pyrolysis oil model compounds p-cresol and furfural using transfer hydrogenation from isopropanol is reported. Bimetallic, non-noble metal catalysts Ni–Cu on Al2O3 and C supports were effective catalysts for both model compounds. Greater than 95% yield of a mixture of ring hydrogenation and deoxygenation products with high selectivity for 4-methylcyclohexanol was achieved at 300°C in neat isopropanol. Furfural was reduced to furfuryl alcohol in similarly high yield, but required the use of lower temperatures. TGRP bio-oils were upgraded over Ni–Cu/C catalyst, and the results indicated that the upgraded bio-oils contained a higher level of hydrogen and were partially deoxygenated. The acidity of bio-oils mostly decreased through esterification of acids with isopropanol, and reduction of the alkyl phenols was not observed. Transfer hydrogenation of bio-oil could aid in the stabilization of bio-oils prior to further processing via the reduction of reactive unsaturated carbon–carbon and carbon–oxygen bonds, but further development is still required to achieve these goals."
