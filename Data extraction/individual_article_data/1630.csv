0,Introduction,"Owing to its high energy content and zero emission, hydrogen (H2) is considered as the best alternative to non-renewable fossil fuels, and as a result, large number of research groups are working on the production of H2 and development of suitable energy technology [1,2]. The combustion of hydrogen and oxygen gases in proton exchange membrane fuel-cell generates electricity and water as a clean by-product [3]. At present, non-renewable technology is the major source for H2 production and hence new and renewable energy technologies are in great demand [4]. The emergence of nanoscience and technology offers many avenues to achieve catalytic materials with improved catalytic properties for H2 production and dye degradation under solar light [5,6]. Further, many materials prepared by different chemical methods have been reported for hydrogen storage [7,8]. In spite of the large volume of activities devoted to these strategic areas of research and development, an economically viable process for the production of H2 via photocatalytic water splitting is yet to be established in industrial scale [9]. In the exploration of photocatalysts for hydrogen production, a few semiconductors were found to exhibit enhanced activity under ultraviolet light. However, a substantial improvement in H2 production was reported on the semiconductors when metals or non-metals are doped or semiconductor composites are prepared and studied under visible light or solar light irradiation [10]. Recently, it is proved that composites having metal or metal oxide deposited onto photocatalyst surface show greater potential for H2 generation [11]. The deposited material can act either as a sensitizer or co-catalyst. This type of photocatalysts are important for water splitting applications because the metals or metal oxides could be readily deposited on the surface of the semiconductors and the supported materials do activate the catalyst by light absorption or by minimizing recombination of the generated charge carrier by trapping electrons and thus result in enhanced catalytic performance. In photocatalysis, a co-catalyst supplies more active sites than the pristine semiconductor catalyst when its work function favours the adsorption of protons in the solution thus facilitates enhanced production of H2 [12,13]. There are several composite photocatalysts studied for H2 generation in order to improve hydrogen production efficiency. Specifically, TiO2 based photocatalysts are found to be most suitable and versatile materials for photocatalytic applications. These catalysts have very unique properties such as excellent chemical and photo stability, natural abundance, and matching valence band and conduction band edge potentials for water splitting requirements [2,14–16] etc. Hence, the TiO2 based composites have become the photocatalysts of choice for H2 generation [17,18]. In general, the non-metals and metals are doped to narrow down the band gap of TiO2, such as in nitrogen doped TiO2 [19] and in the metal doped TiO2 composites like Cr, Fe-doped TiO2 [20] and Pt-TiO2 [21] and then the resulted catalysts have been extensively investigated for H2 evolution reactions. Noble metal nanostructures have received a great deal of research attention in the past decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties and they have been extensively applied in industrial processes [22–24]. The noble metal/metal oxide (NM/MO) based nanomaterials find applications in various areas, which include photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, energy conversion, water splitting, waste minimization, CO2 reduction, photovoltaic and electron transfer reaction etc. [25,26]. Among the noble metals, Pt is well studied due to its best co-catalytic activity in photocatalysis [27]. The formation of Schottky barrier between noble metal and metal oxide semiconductor can suppress the recombination of photo-generated charges and this barrier is highly dependent on the work function of the NM (ϕM) and the electron affinity of the MO (X SM) [28]. Normally, the value of ϕM is larger than that of X SM, where X SM is the energy difference between the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the vacuum (Vac) energy. When the NMs and MOs come into contact, the electrons in the MO are transferred to NM until they reach equilibrium. This results in the bending of the CB (i.e. Schottky barrier ϕB). More importantly, this charge redistribution leads to a built-in electric field at the interface, which inhibits the recombination of charge carriers and improves the photocatalytic activity. The first report on photo-electrochemical decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen under ultraviolet light illumination on TiO2 thin-film and Pt counter electrodes with applied bias promoted photocatalytic method to produce hydrogen [29]. A simple experimental protocol for hydrogen production using TiO2 catalyst is dispersion of the suitably modified TiO2 into the aqueous solution consists of sacrificial reagent and a light source. This work inspired the researchers around the globe to use alcohols and industrial organic wastes as sacrificial agents to improve the hydrogen production efficiency. Thereby, an extensive amount of research work has been carried out with Pt-TiO2 based catalysts as shown in Table 1 . Various synthesis techniques, different TiO2 structures such as particles, nanosheets and various sacrificial agents were studied to improve the photocatalytic activity [30]. In this context, herein we report the Pt deposited TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) for photocatalytic H2 generation in the presence of glycerol as hole scavenger, wherein we have achieved highest activity compared to previous reports. We studied the effect of deposition methods (photo-deposition and chemical reduction method) of Pt onto the TNTs on H2 generation activity as well on dye degradation. Interestingly, both photo-deposition and chemical reduction mediated Pt deposition onto TiO2 nanotubes showed similar impact on H2 generation, while the chemical reduction method was found to be more effective for the degradation of the dye compared to photo-deposition method. The XPS studies indicate that there are differences in the oxidation state of Pt deposited on TiO2 nanotubes by the different deposition methods."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents All the chemicals used in the present work are of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6H2O) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), (C6H9NO)n were received from SD Fine Chemicals, India. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), titanium dioxide (TiO2), glycerol (C3H8O3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanol (C2H5OH) were obtained from Merck, India. Double distilled water was used for the synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes and Pt-deposited TNT composite. Battery water was used for photocatalytic experiments."
3,Hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes,"2.2 Hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes Titanium dioxide nanotubes were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment (HT). In a typical synthesis, TiO2 (Merck) particles (2.5 g) were dispersed into 10 M NaOH aqueous solution (200 mL) in Teflon-lined autoclave (capacity 250 mL) and heated at 130 °C for 20 h. After HT, the obtained white precipitate was washed twice with distilled water, 0.1 M HCl, ethanol, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The bright white powder thus obtained was spread into ceramic boat and calcined at 350 °C for 3 h at 2 °C/min. The TiO2 nanotubes obtained after calcination were denoted as TNT."
4,Preparation of Pt/TiO2 nanotubes via photo-deposition method,"2.3 Preparation of Pt/TiO2 nanotubes via photo-deposition method Photo-deposition is one of the important methods that has been widely used to prepare titania supported metal nanoparticles. Unlike other methods, here the toxic templates which may cause severe damage to the environment were not used. Also the present method works at ambient conditions compared to PVD method which need higher temperatures to get the final product. This method is valid when the support is a semiconductor such as titania. Electrons and holes are generated when the semiconductor is irradiated with light of sufficient energy. The photo-generated electrons are highly reductive that they can reduce metal ions into metal NPs which will be simultaneously deposited onto the semiconductor surface. Normally, hole scavengers such as alcohols have to be added to remove the oxidative radicals. Fig. 1 displays the photodeposition of metal nanoparticles on TiO2 surface upon light irradiation. In a typical procedure, 0.05 M H2PtCl6·H2O (0.5 wt%) was added into 5 vol% glycerol: water mixture (50 mL) in a quartz reactor, then 200 mg of TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) were suspended into this solution. Next, the quartz reactor was covered with aluminum foil and air tight with rubber septum and subjected to series of pre-deposition procedures viz., adsorption, evacuation and nitrogen (N2) purging for 30 min. After N2 purging, the gas inside that quartz reactor was tested (0 h) with Gas Chromatograph (GC) in order to ensure inert condition inside the reactor. Then the reactor was irradiated under solar light for 4 h for the deposition of Pt onto the TNT surface. The color of the solution changed from colourless to black during light irradiation. After 4 h of irradiation, the slurry present in the quartz reactor was centrifuged (10,000 rpm/15 min) and the precipitate was washed once with distilled water (50 mL). Finally, the precipitate was dried at 100 °C for 4 h to get Pt deposited TNT. The same procedure was repeated to prepare different wt% of Pt deposited nanotubes by varying volume of Pt precursor solution as 0.1 mL (0.5 wt%), 0.2 mL (1.0 wt%), 0.4 mL (2.0 wt%), and 0.8 mL (3.0 wt%) and labeled as PTP-0.5, PTP-1.0, PTP-2.0, PTP-3.0 respectively."
5,Preparation of Pt/TiO2 nanotubes via chemical reduction method,"2.4 Preparation of Pt/TiO2 nanotubes via chemical reduction method Chemical reduction is one of the important methods to deposit metal nanoparticles on semiconductor photocatalyst. Different reducing agents like NaBH4, LiBH4, N2H4, LiAlH4 etc., are used in the reaction solution for deposition of metals. In this method, conversion of metal ions in to metal takes place, for example, the reduction of Pt (IV) to Pt (0) [31,32]. The schematic representation of chemical reduction of Pt onto the TNTs surface is shown in Fig. 2 . It is noteworthy that in the chemical reduction method, we did not use any toxic templates and processed the materials at ambient temperature and pressure. In typical chemical reduction procedure, 0.05 M H2PtCl6·H2O (0.5 wt%) was taken in 50 mL distilled H2O and stirred for 5 min. Then, 0.2 g of TNT powder was dispersed in to the solution and stirring continued. 0.001 M PVP was added to the above solution, which acts as a capping agent as well as size controlling agent. Then freshly prepared solution of reducing agent, NaBH4 (0.005 M) was added drop wise for the reduction of metal ions, which was confirmed by colour change of the solution from colourless to black. The stirring was continued for 1 h to complete reduction and deposition of metal nanoparticles. Finally, the Pt deposited nanotubes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with distilled H2O, and then the precipitate was dried at 100 °C for 4 h to obtain the Pt-TNT composite catalyst. The same protocol was followed to prepare different wt% (0.5, 1, 2, 3 wt%) Pt-TNT composites by varying the volume of Pt precursor and labeled as PTC-0.5, PTC-1.0, PTC-2.0 and PTC-3.0."
6,Materials characterization,"2.5 Materials characterization Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer was used to record powder X-ray diffraction patters of the catalysts. A JASCO V-670 UV–Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere was used to obtain UV–Vis DRS spectra. FTIR spectra of the neat samples were recorded using Shimadu IR Affinity-1 instrument equipped with attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory. Photoluminescence spectra were collected using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm employing a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Morphology of the catalysts were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) JEOL JSM-IT-500, and SEM-EDS data was obtained by AMETEK instrument. High resolution transmission electron microscopy images were collected using a FEI Tecnai F20 S-Twin instrument at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectrum was obtained using an Axia Ultra (Kratos Analyticals UK) XPS instrument using Al Kα photon having 1486.6 eV energy."
7,Solar photocatalytic H2 generation experiments,"2.6 Solar photocatalytic H2 generation experiments The photocatalytic reaction was performed in 180 mL quartz reactor under natural solar irradiation between 10 AM and 3 PM on sunny days (see Fig. 3 ). The catalyst was suspended in 50 mL of 5% glycerol water mixture at the concentration of 2 g/L, and allowed for adsorption to complete in dark condition. The evacuation of the reactor followed by purging using nitrogen gas was also performed before irradiation. During the photocatalytic experiment, the reaction mixture was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer for homogeneous mixing of the suspension. The gases evolved during the photocatalytic reaction were monitored periodically using an off-line gas chromatograph equipped with TCD detector. In off-line method, sampling was done at regular time interval of 1 h using 250 µL air tight syringes. After injection, the peak appearing at particular retention time corresponding to H2 was identified by injecting H2 standards and comparing the retention time. The area of the peak was converted into moles of hydrogen based on the standards and expressed in mmol·h−1."
8,Photocatalytic dye degradation experiments,"2.7 Photocatalytic dye degradation experiments Methyl orange (MO) was taken as a model pollutant to test the photocatalytic oxidation activity of TNT, PTP-1.0, PTC-1.0 catalysts under solar irradiation (average light intensity 1.10 × 105 lx) between 12 PM and 2 PM. The photocatalytic dye degradation experiments were carried out in a batch reactor (capacity 250 mL) made-up of borosilicate glass. The round-bottom reactor has a sampling port for handling reaction mixture. The thermal evaporation of water in the presence of solar light was minimized by covering the sampling port with rubber septum. The reaction parameters for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants were chosen based on our earlier findings [33]. Prior to the photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg of the catalyst was suspended into 50 mL of MO dye solution (5 × 10−5 mol L−1) at pH 6.5 and magnetically stirred for 30 min in dark to ensure attainment of adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Under solar irradiation, at the periodic time intervals 0–60 min, 3 mL of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and centrifuged. The centrifugation was analysed for optical absorption at 464 nm using Shimadzu UV-1800 UV–Visible spectrophotometer. The progress of photocatalytic degradation of MO was calculated using the following equation: Degradation % = C o - C C o × 100 where Co and C are initial concentration and concentration at a given time respectively. Photolysis experiments were carried out under solar irradiation of MO solution in the absence of catalyst."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Crystal structure and phase analysis,"3.1 Crystal structure and phase analysis X-ray diffraction patterns of pristine TNT and Pt/TNT nanocomposites prepared by photo-deposition method (PTP-0.5 to PTP-3.0), chemical reduction method (PTC-0.5 to PTC-3.0) are shown in Fig. 4 . In PTP and PTC series, the samples with lower wt% of Pt from 0.5 to 2% showed only peaks corresponding to anatase TiO2. The reflections at 2θ = 25.3, 37.8, 48.1, 53.9, 55.1, and 62.7° are indexed to (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) planes of anatase phase (ICDD no: 21-1272). But with higher loading of Pt (3 wt%) the Pt peaks can be detected at 2θ = 39.8 and 46.4° which could be indexed to (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) planes of Pt that belongs to face centred cubic structure [34,35]. The Pt peaks are weak and broad indicating the nanocrystalline nature of the Pt particles. Further, no peak shifts can be observed with Pt loading, which reveals that the Pt is not doped into in the lattice of TiO2, but deposited on the TiO2 surface. Further, it is also found that Pt deposition did not alter the TiO2 crystallite size and it can be concluded that the synthesis method has no impact on crystalline nature of the support. Further the crystallite sizes of the optimized catalysts were calculated by using the following Scherrer formula [36] Average crystallite size D = K λ / β cos θ where β is the breadth of the observed diffraction line at its half intensity maximum, K is the so-called shape factor which usually takes a value of about 0.9, and λ is the wavelength of X-ray source used in XRD. From the above formula the crystallite sizes of PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 were found to be 12.47 and 12.28 nm respectively. These values are similar to the data obtained from TEM images."
11,Morphological studies,"3.2 Morphological studies 3.2.1 SEM analysis Fig. 5 displays the morphology, EDX spectrum and elemental mapping of PTP-1.0 catalyst. The SEM images of different magnifications indicate web like growth of TiO2 nanotubes Fig. 5(a and b). However, the deposited Pt particles could not be seen in SEM images and alternatively, the presence of Pt was confirmed by EDX analysis and elemental mapping, which clearly indicates the existence of Pt, Ti and O as shown in Fig. 5(c–h). Carbon peaks also appeared in EDX spectrum, which could be from carbon grids used for the analysis. 3.2.2 TEM analysis TEM images of TNT, PTC-1.0 and PTP-1.0 catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . The Fig. 6(a) reveals the 1D nanostructure of TiO2 nanotubes whose diameter is about 8–10 nm and length varies from 50 nm to 250 nm. The inset of the Fig. 6(a) shows the inner and outer diameter of the nanotubes as 8.1 and 3.5 nm, respectively. The wall thickness of the tube is about 2.7 nm. These results confirmed the formation of well-structured TiO2 nanotubes. Fig. 6(b) displays the high resolution TEM image of TiO2, where the d-pacing values of the lattice fringes, 0.347 nm reveals the anatase phase of TiO2 nanotubes, which is in agreement with XRD data. TEM images of Pt/TNT catalyst (PTC-1.0) prepared by chemical deposition method are displayed in Fig. 6(c–e). The Fig. 6(c) shows the presence of large number of TiO2 nanotubes arranged randomly and small dark spots over them. The dark spots could be Pt nanoparticles, and they are seen clearly in magnified TEM images (Fig. 6(e)). The size of the Pt nanoparticles vary from 1.3 nm to 2.3 nm, and the average particle size is ca. 1.8 nm. The sizes of the Pt nanoparticles were calculated by using image j software. On the other hand, in the case of PTP-1.0, which was prepared by photo-deposition method, the formation of bigger sized Pt particles can be seen as shown in Fig. 6(f and g). The particle size of Pt in PTP-1.0 ranges from 4 to 10 nm and average particle size was found to be ca. 5.8 nm. From the TEM images, it can be concluded that chemical reduction method results deposition of Pt nanoclusters (1.3–2.3 nm) whereas photo-deposition method results in bigger size (4–10 nm) nanoparticles with agglomeration. The main reason for smaller size of Pt nanoparticles in PTC-1.0 could be the use of capping agent during the synthesis that may control the particle size of Pt nanoparticles and also prevent them from agglomeration. Where as in the case of photo-deposition method (PTP-1.0), it resulted in bigger particles with agglomeration of Pt, since there was no capping agent used."
12,Optical properties analysis,"3.3 Optical properties analysis The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of PTP, PTC and TNT catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . Pristine TNT showed strong absorption at ca. 400 nm, which corresponds to intrinsic band gap absorption of anatase TiO2 which supports the anatase peaks of the XRD data. The Pt loading clearly influenced visible light absorption of TiO2. Compared with pristine TNT, the absorption spectra of Pt deposited TNT samples show an enhanced absorption in the visible-light region. Among PTP samples, except PTP-0.5, all others show increased absorption in visible light region upon increasing Pt loading (Fig. 7(a)). However in PTC samples, only PTC-3.0 shows an extreme change in visible light absorption as shown in Fig. 7(b). The enhancement of visible-light absorption is due to the fact that the incident photon frequency is resonating with the collective excitations of the conduction electrons of noble-metal nanoparticles, called the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [37]. Thus the Pt loading can obviously influence the photocatalytic activity, via increased absorption of light photons. Similar type of results were reported by Yu et al. [21]. Ortega Mendez et al. [38] also observed similar visible light absorption properties for Au/TiO2 catalysts due to SPR effect."
13,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis,"3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis Fig. 8 displays the X-ray photoelectron spectra of PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0. Ti 2p spectra of PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 catalysts designate Ti 2p3/2 peak at 458.4 eV and Ti 2p1/2 at 464 eV indicating titanium in Ti4+ state(Fig. 8(a, b)) [39]. This reveals that synthesis method has not influenced the oxidation state of TiO2. Fig. 8(c, d) show Pt peaks of PTP- 1.0 and PTC-1.0 samples, prepared by photo-deposition and chemical reduction methods respectively. The Pt deposited by photo-deposition method exhibits bands at 70.4 and 74.2 eV corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 components of Pt0 [39,40]. In addition to the Pt peaks discussed above, some other minor peaks can be seen at 68.6, 69.5, 71.7, 73.5, 75.5 and 76.5 eV. These extra peaks can be considered as noise and other disturbances coming out from the instrument, since none of these peaks matched with the standard peaks of Pt0, Pt2+ and Pt4+ except the peak at 75.5 eV which matches with Pt2+. On the other hand, the spectrum of Pt deposited by chemical reduction method consists of peaks corresponding to Pt⁰, Pt2+ and Pt4+ oxidation states. (Fig. 8(d)). The bands around 72.1 and 75.7 eV correspond to Pt2+ and the peaks at 70.6 and 74.1 eV are related to metallic Pt⁰. A peak correlated to Pt4+ can be seen at 72.9 eV [41]. These observations indicate that in photo-deposition method, complete reduction of all Pt ions into metallic Pt happens due to the supply of sufficient number of excited electrons from the photo-excited TNT surface to adsorbed Pt ions. In the case of chemical reduction method, wherein electrons to be supplied from the solution, a partial reduction of Pt takes place due to possibility of formation of multiple layers of Pt ions on the surface of TNT, where the upper Pt layer can only get reduced completely as compared to the Pt ions adsorbed on to TNT surface and hence the formation of Pt2+ and Pt4+ can be seen besides Pt⁰. Similar results were reported in the literature showing that during Pt/TiO2 preparation, partial reduction of Pt takes place [42]. Huang et al. [43] has also reported partial reduction of Pt on TiO2 while Pt/TiO2 was prepared by reduction methods. Hence it can be concluded that the method of reduction might influence the oxidation state of Pt deposited on TiO2 surface. O1s peak (corresponds to O2– state of oxygen) of both PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 appear at 529.6 eV as shown in Fig. 8(e, f), which reveals that the chemical state of oxygen is not affected by the synthesis methods."
14,Photocatalytic activity,"3.5 Photocatalytic activity 3.5.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen production Experimental parameters used in the photocatalytic H2 production studies were fixed based on the earlier report [44]. The photocatalytic H2 production results obtained over the prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . The Pt loading was varied from 0.5 to 3.0 wt% and tested for H2 generation. Obviously Pt loading influenced the photocatalytic H2 evolution. In both PTP and PTC series catalysts with 1.0 wt% Pt loaded TNT exhibited the highest activity as shown in Fig. 9(a). These results reveal that synthesis method does not influence the optimized loading of Pt required for highest photocatalytic activity. Further it could be seen from the results that even though there is a difference in the oxidation state of Pt deposited on TNT by photo-deposition and chemical reduction methods, both PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 showed similar activity. This similarity in the H2 production activity reveals that chemical state of Pt may not greatly affect the H2 generation activity in Pt/TiO2 system. However, one cannot neglect the chance of in situ reduction of Pt2+ and Pt4+ into metallic Pt⁰ in PTC-1.0 catalysts during photocatalytic H2 generation reactions [42]. If the in situ reduction happens instantaneously then one may not able to see the influence of oxidation state of Pt on H2 generation. The improved activity with Pt loading may be due to the effective electron accepter property of Pt. The electrons from conduction band of TiO2 can migrate to Pt nanoparticles and then react with H+ ions produced by oxidation of glycerol, a sacrificial agent, and adsorbed on the catalyst to form H2. Also Pt on TiO2 nanotubes can form Schottky barrier which facilitates electron capture for H2 generation. Beyond the optimized loading, the activity was found to be decreased. This may be because at the lower amount of Pt, the excited charge carriers can undergo fast recombination due to insufficient electron acceptors for reduction reactions, in this case, the recombination rate is higher than the reduction reaction with Pt, hence activity is lower. In higher loading of Pt, the TiO2 nanotubes suffer by hindered harvesting of light energy leading to hindered generation of charge carriers for H2 generation. The activity of the optimized Pt/TNT catalysts was compared with pristine TNT to know the influence of Pt co-catalyst on H2 generation activity. Accordingly, the PTP-1.0, PTC-1.0 show hydrogen generation activity of 173.3 and 172.4 mmol·h−1·g−1 cat, which is about 46 folds higher than TNT, which shows an activity of only 3.7 mmol·h−1·g−1 cat as depicted in Fig. 9(c). The increased activity of the optimized catalysts was due to the effective utilization of photogenerated electrons by the deposited Pt co-catalyst for H2 generation. The recombination of the e−/h+ pairs has been effectively minimized due to the Schottky barrier and thus majority of the electrons are utilized for hydrogen generation and holes are consumed by glycerol present in the medium. Hence, there is less chance for recombination of electrons and holes so that the catalytic activity was enhanced drastically. In addition, catalyst recyclability tests were also performed on the optimized photocatalysts, PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 in order to analyse the stability and the results are plotted in Fig. 9(d) & (e). Recycle experiments were conducted continuously for 7 days. Each experiment was conducted for 4 h under solar light. The 1st cycle of experiment was carried out as per the experimental procedure mentioned elsewhere in the article. After completion of 1st cycle, the reactor was kept in dark and maintained air tight over night at room temperature. Before starting the consecutive reaction cycles, the gaseous products in the reactor were evacuated, purged with nitrogen gas to ensure absence of H2 and O2. Further the gases present in the reactor after nitrogen purging was analyzed for H2 and O2 using gas chromatograph to make sure their absence. The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was retained for seven recycles within the limitations of deviation in experimental conditions. In the case of PTP-1.0, the activity increased gradually for 2nd and 3rd cycles. The exact reason for this change could not be identified. However, one of the possible reasons may be increase in the intensity of the sunlight at those particular days. This shows the stability of the prepared Pt/TNT catalysts under the conditions used for hydrogen production. 3.5.2 Photocatalytic dye degradation Even though the chemical state of Pt in PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 are different, both the catalysts exhibit similar activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production. The probable reason for the similarity in activity may be due to in situ reduction of Pt2+ and Pt4+ into Pt0. In order to probe this further and to know the influence of chemical state of Pt, we chose to perform photocatalytic oxidation/degradation of an organic dye, methyl orange (MO) using the PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 catalysts. In photocatalytic hydrogen generation, both oxidation of the sacrificial agent and reduction of protons are important and it is being performed under inert atmosphere. However, in the case of photocatalytic dye degradation, the reaction is performed in the presence of oxygen and only oxidation of the organic dye by the photo-generated holes and active oxygen species is important. So, the requirement of the nature of the catalyst for dye degradation could be different from that of hydrogen generation. The experimental results of MO degradation over PTP-1.0, PTC-1.0 and TNT are displayed in Fig. 10 . PTC-1.0 showed lowest normalization concentration compared to PTP-1.0 and TNT. Especially, in the first 30 min of irradiation, the difference in normalization concentration was very high between PTC-1.0 and other two catalysts as depicted in Fig. 10(a). Similarly, the percentage of degradation was also very high for PTC-1.0 compared to PTP-1.0 and TNT (Fig. 10(b)). In the first 30 min of irradiation time, under solar light, in the presence of PTC-1.0, 94% degradation was achieved. Whereas PTC-1.0 and TNT, showed only 50.5% and 49% degradation respectively at the same reaction time. Further, recyclability experiments were conducted on PTC-1.0 for 3 cycles during 3 continuous days as shown in Fig. 10(c). Here the degradation percentage is same for first 2 cycles, whereas for 3rd cycle the activity decreased to 60%. This is due to the difference in the light intensity at that particular day. For first two days, the intensity of light was similar, but on the third day, it was cloudy and intensity of sunlight was low. Thus the dye degradation activity was affected. Based on the dye degradation data obtained for the first two days, it is concluded that the PTC-1.0 catalyst is stable. The photographs of degradation of MO dye with TNT, PTP-1.0 and TPC-1.0 are also shown in Fig. 11 for the benefit of the readers. Thus, it is clear that co-existence of Pt⁰, Pt2+, Pt4+ is beneficial for the efficient dye decolourisation instead of having Pt⁰ alone. During oxidation of the dye, upon irradiation, e−/h+ pairs are generated and the holes formed in the valance band will react with the adsorbed dye and tend to oxidize it. At the same time electrons in the conduction band may be utilized by oxidized Pt species for their reduction to Pt⁰. Hence effective charge separation may happen in PTC-1.0 catalyst. In the case of PTP-1.0, since already only Pt⁰ is present, the electrons in the conduction band are not scavenged and hence recombination of e− and h+ may be prevalent leading to suppressed dye degradation. So one can conclude that chemical reduction method is efficient for fine deposition of Pt nanoparticles onto the semiconductor catalyst which have different oxidation states and hence may be suitable for preparation of Pt/TiO2 catalysts useful for photocatalytic oxidation reactions like dye degradation [40]. The active species generally involved in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye over TiO2 photocatalyst have been established in the literature. It is reported that holes, electrons, hydroxyl radicals ( OH), and superoxide radicals (O2 −) are the active species involved in dye degradation and MO oxidation is mainly driven by O2 −, holes and OH radicals [36,45]. Konstantinou et al. [46] reviewed TiO2 assisted photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes and established the active species evolved during degradation process and further discussed the effects of different experimental parameters like pH, oxidant concentrations, light intensity, irradiation time etc., Hence, in this study also we expect that holes, electrons, hydroxyl radicals ( OH), and superoxide radicals (O2 −) are the major active species involved in degradation process. Further, the stability of the catalysts after photocatalytic hydrogen production was studied using few characterization techniques to know the changes happened in crystal structure, optical property and oxidation state. XRD patterns of both fresh and used catalysts are as shown in Fig. 12 (a, b). The diffraction patterns suggest that the crystal structure of the catalysts (PTP-1.0, PTC-1.0) before and after photocatalytic hydrogen generation is similar. The UV–Vis DR spectra of PTP-1.0, PTC-1.0 catalysts are shown in Fig. 12(c, d). The used PTP-1.0 catalyst showed similar absorption as that of fresh catalyst around 400 nm, which reveals that the catalysts is stable after the photocatalytic reaction. The used PTC-1.0 (Fig. 12(d)) showed increased absorption in visible region compared to the fresh one. The reason for this increased absorption may be conversion of Pt2+, Pt4+ into metallic Pt⁰ favouring absorption of more light in the visible region. The FTIR spectrum of used PTP-1.0 is similar to fresh PTP-1.0, which reveals that there is no additional functional groups created or adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 12(e)). In the spectra, OH stretching vibration modes of water molecules can be seen at 3256–3266 cm−1. The peak at 1630 cm−1 is ascribed to the bending vibration of free or absorbed water [47]. The peaks at 1039, 759 cm−1 and below are related to Ti-O-Ti stretching modes. The used PTP-1.0 catalysts showed similar spectra as that of fresh PTP-1.0. But in the used PTC-1.0 catalyst, some new features which resemble that of fresh PTP-1.0 and used PTP-1.0 were seen at 1380 and 1039 cm−1. The reason for this difference may be presence of Pt+2 and Pt+4 in fresh PTC-1.0. In the used PTC1.0, the oxidised Pt species were reduced in to Pt0 as discussed below. The XPS analysis of the used PTP-1.0 showed presence of metallic Pt as that of fresh catalyst even after stability tests as shown in Fig. 12(g,h). The Pt 4f 3/2 and Pt 4f 3/2 bands in the used PTP 1.0 catalysts are observed to be almost similar to that of the Pt 4f peaks of fresh catalyst, thus the PTP-1.0 catalysts is stable after prolonged usage. In the case of comparison between fresh and used PTC catalyst, the used PTC-1.0 showed reduction of Pt+2 and Pt+4 into metallic Pt⁰, (Fig. 12(i,j)) which provides a clear evidence to the proposed mechanism, in situ reduction of ionic Pt into metallic Pt during the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction. 3.5.3 Photoluminescence spectral (PL) analysis In order to analyse charge separation efficiency and electron hole pair recombination rate of the photocatalysts, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded and presented in Fig. 13 . The spectra showed two peaks around 280 nm and 570 nm which are related to TiO2. As expected, TNT showed higher PL intensity than PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 which means that charge carrier recombination is higher in TNT and minimized in the Pt deposited catalysts. Thus the photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity of PTP-1.0 and PTC-1.0 is higher accordingly."
15,Proposed reaction mechanism,"3.6 Proposed reaction mechanism Based on the experimental results, a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed to explain the photocatalytic activities of Pt-TiO2 composites prepared by photo-deposition method and chemical reduction method as depicted in Fig. 14 . First photogenerated charge carries has been generated upon light irradiation as shown in step (i), which can oxidise at VB of TiO2 as mentioned in step (ii) and reduce H+ into H2 as shown in step (iii). As discussed in XPS results, due to difference in oxidation states of Pt, degradation of dye shows varied activity in such a way that the efficiency is higher for the catalyst prepared by chemical reduction method than for the one prepared by photo-deposition method."
16,Conclusions,"In this study, Pt/TiO2 nanotube photocatalysts were prepared via hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes followed by loading of Pt on the tubes by photo-deposition and chemical reduction methods. The TEM results confirm the deposition of 4–10 and 1.3–2.3 nm sized Pt nanoparticles by photo-deposition and chemical reduction methods respectively. The synthesis methods obviously can influence the particle size of the deposited metal. XPS studies reveal that photo-deposition method results only metallic Pt, whereas chemical reduction method results different oxidation states of Pt such as 0, +2 and +4 in Pt/TNT catalysts. Though there is a difference in chemical state of Pt in Pt/TNT catalysts prepared by these two different methods, photocatalytic H2 production activity was found to be almost same on both the catalysts. This similarity in hydrogen production activity is because of in situ reduction of Pt ions into metallic state during photocatalytic hydrogen production, which was clearly evidenced by XPS analysis of the used catalyst. But prominent variation in activity was observed between the two catalysts in the case of dye degradation, wherein the conditions do not allow reduction of Pt ions into Pt metal. Thus it is highlighted in this study that the two Pt deposition methods studied here impact different types of photocatalytic reactions differently. The 1 wt% Pt loaded TiO2 nanotubes showed the highest H2 production and the hydrogen production activity was about 46 folds higher than pristine TiO2 nanotubes. Thus it is clear that Pt nanoparticles greatly enhance H2 generation by catalysing reduction of protons and minimizing charge carrier recombination. Moreover, the catalysts showed excellent stability during continuous H2 generation experiment carried out for seven days under solar light irradiation. Thus Pt/TiO2 nanotubes can be promising catalysts for large scale H2 production."
