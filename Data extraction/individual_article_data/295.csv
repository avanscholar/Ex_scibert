0,Introduction,"Solar driven hydrogen (H2) evolution is a promising approach for the direct conversion of solar energy to chemical energy and has drawn great attention due to the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing environmental issues [1–9]. Photocatalytic water splitting is a well-researched way to achieve this purpose. It is generally believed that in an ideal photocatalytic system, protons are reduced to H2 by the photogenerated electrons on the reductive side and oxygen is produced as the product of water oxidation by the holes on the oxidative side, which is so-called photocatalytic overall water splitting. Unfortunately, in most cases, the rate of total photocatalytic reaction is considerably low due to the fact that the sluggish water oxidation half-reaction does not match well with the reduction side half-reaction [10]. In addition, O2 is not a desirable product during H2 evolution due to the fact that uncontrolled reverse reaction of H2 and O2 on the photocatalyst surface reduces the performance of photocatalytic water splitting [11]. Furthermore, it is well known that H2-O2 is an explosive gaseous mixture, so system safety and gas separation thus should be taken into consideration, which still remains a great challenge in industry. As an alternative way to solve the abovementioned problems, sacrificial reagents, which are oxidized much easier than water, are commonly added in the photocatalytic system to speed up the consumption of photogenerated holes for high-performance photocatalytic H2 evolution [12–16]. However, the oxidation of sacrificial reagents usually involves a complicated pathway and the corresponding products have limited commercial applications. Some systems also release COx (X = 1 or 2), which will be harmful to our environment [17]. Thus, the introduction of sacrificial reagents not only greatly increases the cost but also wastes the energy of the holes [18–21]. To solve this problem, a suitable reaction substrate which can be selectively transferred to high-valued chemical products at desirable rate should be preferred for the oxidative half-reaction. Among various candidates, benzyl alcohol (BA) can meet this requirement. The selective oxidation of BA to benzaldehyde is one of the most important organic reactions due to the fact that the carbonyl derivatives are widely used in industry [22–24]. Traditionally, this transformation is achieved by hazardous, toxic stoichiometric oxidants under stringent conditions such as high pressure and/or high temperature [22,23,25]. Green synthetic routes have been reported, featuring photocatalytic oxidation of BA under air over semiconductors such as TiO2 [26], C3N4 [27], CdS [28], and Bi2MoO6 [25]. However, it should be noted that, no hydrogen was reported to be produced in these systems and molecular oxygen (O2) is essential in these photocatalytic systems for benzaldehyde production. Recent studies pointed out that superoxide radicals produced by the reaction of O2 with the photogenerated electrons on the reductive side serve only as electron and proton acceptors, and do not participate in the BA oxidation process [25,29]. These results indicate that the energy of both electrons and protons from BA are wasted for aerobic BA oxidation reaction. A promising approach to address the issues of the oxidation side is to design a COx-free photocatalytic reaction system for dehydrogenation of BA in which protons from BA are reduced to H2 by the electrons and BA is selectively oxidized to carbonyl compounds by the photogenerated holes. As a result, the photogenerated charge carriers can be fully utilized and so such a photocatalytic approach for H2 evolution will be more practical compared to water splitting with sacrificial reagents in terms of economic sustainability. Herein, we report a novel efficient noble-metal-free photocatalytic system using CdS nanorods (NRs) as the photosensitizer and in-situ photodeposited tiny cobalt nanoparticles as cocatalyst for efficient visible-light driven dehydrogenation of BA for simultaneous H2 evolution and selective benzaldehyde production. Under optimal conditions, the reaction selectivity for benzaldehyde production is as high as 94.4% and this system shows an impressive H2 production activity (848 µmol h−1) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The average apparent quantum yield is 63.2% at 420 nm."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ethylenediamine (99.0%), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 99.5%), thiourea (CH4N2S, 99.0%), cadmium chloride hemipentahydrate (CdCl2·2.5H2O, 99.0%), acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.0%), BA (C7H8O, 99.0%), and benzaldehyde (C7H6O, 99%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar or Aldrich and used without further purification. Millipore water (resistivity: ∼18 MΩ cm) was used when needed. 2.1.1 Synthesis of Co/CdS photocatalysts CdS NRs were synthesized according to our previous reports [30,31]. 10.125 mmol (4.62 g) of CdCl2·2.5H2O and 30.375 mmol (4.62 g) of thiourea (CH4N2S) were dissolved in 60 mL of ethylenediamine. The mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with a volume of 100 ml, sealed, and maintained at 160 °C for 48 h. Then the autoclave was allowed to cool down to room temperature. The resulting yellow solid products were collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and ethanol three times each to remove any residue of organic solvent. The final product was then dried at 60 °C overnight. The Co/CdS composite was prepared by an in-situ photodeposition method. Typically, a certain amount of CoCl2·6H2O was added to a suspension of CdS NRs photocatalysts (5.0 mg) in BA solution and then the suspension was irradiated under visible light. The sample prepared using 0.3 mg/mL CoCl2·6H2O was then centrifuged and stored under argon after the photocatalytic experiments for further physical characterization."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods The crystal diffraction patterns of the photocatalyst samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-TTR III) using graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation of 1.54178 Å, operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. The scanning rate was 10° min−1 from 20° to 80° (2θ). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a JSM-6700F microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected on a JEM-2010 electron microscope, operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (SOLID 3700 UV–vis spectrometer). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on JY Fluorolog-3-Tou fluorescence spectrometer, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded on a PicoHarp 300 (PicoQuant) instrument. The spin trapping experiments were performed in deoxygenated solutions using a JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer at room temperature. The irradiation experiments were carried out with a Xe lamp (500 W, USHIO Optical Modulex SX-U1501XQ) equipped with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm)."
4,Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA,"2.3 Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA The experiments were carried out in a 50 mL round-bottom flask at ambient temperature. A 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used to provide the visible light irradiation. In a typical photocatalytic reaction, the photocatalyst powder sample was dispersed in a 20 mL pure benzyl alcohol or a mixture of benzyl alcohol and acetonitrile depending on the concentration of benzyl alcohol used for the photocatalytic reactions. Before irradiation, the solution was bubbled with high purity nitrogen for 15 min to remove the air. Methane was added in the reactor as the internal standard. The amount of evolved H2 was determined by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a TCD detector. After reaction, the catalyst powders were removed by centrifugation (10 min at 12000 rpm), and the supernatants containing BA and products were injected into GC (JieDao 1690) with a flame-ionization detector using a PEG-20M 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm × 30 m capillary column (GC conditions: front inlet temperature: 280 °C, FID temperature: 300 °C, carrier gas: Ar, oven temperature: first kept at 60 °C for 3 min, and then increased to 230 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min, sample injection volume: 2 μL). Calibration curves were used to determine the yields of benzaldehyde (Fig. S1). Qualitative analysis of catalytic mixture was characterized by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy on a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer at 298 K using CD3CN as solvent. The chemical structures of the products were confirmed by GC–MS (Trace 1300, Thermo scientific). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was measured using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a 420 nm (±5 nm) bandpass cut filter. The light intensity was ca. 7.3 mW/cm2 and the illuminated area for the reactor was about 1.44 cm2. The AQY was calculated based on the following equation: AQY ( % ) = number of reacted electrons number of incident photons × 100 % = number of evolved H 2 molecules × 2 number of incident photons × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis and structural characterizations,"3.1 Synthesis and structural characterizations CdS nanorods decorated with Co nanoparticles (Co/CdS NRs) photocatalyst composites were facilely synthesized by in-situ photodeposition method. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was employed to identify the crystal structure of the samples. As shown in Fig. 1 a, pure CdS nanorods (NRs) and Co/CdS NRs exhibited peaks at 2θ of 24.81°, 26.51°, 28.18°, 36.62°, 47.84°, and 51.82°, which can be assigned to diffraction patterns from the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), and (1 1 2) lattice planes of CdS (JCPDS No. 77-2306), respectively. This observation indicates the structural feature of CdS NRs was well maintained during the photodeposition of Co nanoparticles. In addition, a new diffraction peak emerged at 44.4° for the Co/CdS NRs sample, which can be attributed to the photodeposited cobalt species. Moreover, the EDX spectrum of Co/CdS NRs shows the presence of Cd, S, Co, Au, Cu, and C elements (Fig. 1b), indicating the existence of Co element in the composite photocatalyst. The Cu element was from the Cu grid substrate and Au was sprayed on the sample to increase the conductivity. The morphology of the photocatalyst sample was investigated by TEM, which clearly showed that the Co/CdS sample had a nanorods morphology with a rough surface consisting of a large number of tiny nanoparticles with the average size <2 nm (Figs. 1c and S2). This morphology suggests the successful deposition of Co nanoparticles. Moreover, the HRTEM image of the Co/CdS sample showed a lattice fringe distance of ∼0.246 nm on the surface and ∼0.67 nm in the core, which can be assigned to the (1 1 1) plane of CoO and the (0 0 2) plane of hexagonal CdS, respectively (Fig. 1d). Note that it is the Co nanoparticles rather than CoO that was formed during photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA under inert atmosphere and BA acts as an electron donor to reduce the cobalt precursors. The Co nanoparticles can be easily transferred into CoO upon exposure to air in ambient conditions [32]. To identify the surface chemical compositions and valence states of the composite photocatalyst, the XPS spectra of the Co/CdS composite was measured. The XPS survey scan in Fig. 2 a shows the presence of Cd, S, Co, O, and C elements. The C element at 284.8 eV was used as the reference to correct the binding energies of the other elements. The high resolution XPS spectrum of Cd 3d shows two peaks of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 located at 405.1 eV and 411.9 eV, respectively, which are similar to those seen in previous study (Fig. 2b) [30]. The high resolution XPS data of S 2p exhibits two peaks at 161.5 eV and 162.7 eV, which can be assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 2c). In the high resolution Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2d), two obvious peaks can be observed for Co 2p3/2. One peak, at ∼778.2 eV, belongs to the photodeposited Co0 [33]. The other peak at 781.1 eV can be assigned to CoO [34], which is consistent with the value of spin-orbit splitting of the Co 2p peaks in CoO (ΔE = 16.1 eV)."
7,Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA,"3.2 Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA Photocatalytic experiments were carried out under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) at room temperature. Initially, we investigated the concentration effect of CoCl2 on the rate of H2 evolution during photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA. Fig. 3 a shows the rate of H2 evolution using CdS decorated with Co nanoparticles in 10 vol% BA solution in acetonitrile. It can be observed that in-situ photodeposition of Co nanoparticles on CdS NRs can significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity. The hydrogen evolution rates initially increase with an increased amount of CoCl2 and then reach a plateau with further increasing the concentration of CoCl2. In the absence of CoCl2, trace H2 can be detected. When the concentration of CoCl2 is 0.075 M, the hydrogen evolution rate is 180 µmol h−1. Impressively, when 0.3 M CoCl2 was added into the reaction solution, the rate rapidly increased to 440 µmol h−1. The effect of BA concentration on the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution and benzaldehyde production is shown in Fig. 3b and the detailed results are summarized in Table 1 . In the beginning, the H2 production rate increased with an increasing concentration of BA. In 3 h, the maximum amount of H2 (2545.3 µmol) was obtained in 20 ml solution containing 50 vol% BA. When pure BA was used, the amount of H2 had no significant changes, indicating the concentration of BA is not a limiting factor in this condition. For the oxidation side, the amount of benzaldehyde production follows a similar trend as that of H2 evolution when the concentration of BA is in the range of 0.25–25 vol%. However, when the concentration is higher than 25 vol%, the amount of benzaldehyde decreases. The molar ratio of benzaldehyde and H2 (R) was calculated to evaluate the selectivity for benzaldehyde production from dehydrogenation of BA. Ideally, R should be 1.0 when all BA is consumed on the oxidative side to produce benzaldehyde and the selectivity for benzaldehyde production should be 100%. The experimentally measured R values are summarized in Fig. 3b. The results show that the concentration of BA has a significant effect on the selectivity for benzaldehyde production. Specifically, R values are determined to be 93.9%, 94.4%, 90.6%, 86.3%, 66.8%, and 44.9% in 0.25 vol%, 0.5 vol%, 1.25 vol%, 25 vol%, 50 vol%, and 100 vol% BA solution, respectively. Combined with the H2 evolution data, these results clearly indicate that H2 evolution is well coupled with benzaldehyde production at a relatively low BA concentration, which is further confirmed by 1H NMR results (Fig. S3). However, at a high BA concentration, the production of some other carbonyl compounds will compete with benzaldehyde production as oxidative products, as evidenced by the 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture after visible light irradiation in 50 vol% BA acetonitrile solution (Fig. S4). It should be noted that the selectivity for benzaldehyde production is comparable with the values in the literature for photocatalytic aerobic BA oxidation over TiO2 [35], C3N4 [27], and Au/BiOCl [36] under the similar BA concentration in acetonitrile solution (0.5 vol% BA or 0.1 M). H2 evolution performance in 50 vol% BA acetonitrile solution was also determined under a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm (±5 nm) band-pass filter to investigate the catalytic durability and apparent quantum yield (AQY) (Fig. 3c). The result showed that H2 production rate is quite stable during the evaluation time, producing a nearly linear relationship between the amount of H2 and time for >40 h. The initial average rate in 4 h for H2 production is ∼41.95 µmol h−1·, corresponding to an impressive AQY value of 63.2%. To the best of our knowledge, this is highest efficiency using powdered photocatalysts for visible-light driven H2 evolution from photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA reported to date."
8,The role of cobalt nanoparticles,"3.3 The role of cobalt nanoparticles To investigate the role of Co nanoparticles in the photocatalyst, control experiments were carried out in the absence of CdS NRs or CoCl2 precursor. When pure CdS was employed, trace amount of H2 can be detected after 3 h irradiation, probably due to the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in pure CdS NRs. On the other hand, CoCl2 alone showed no appreciable H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), indicating that CoCl2 is not an active photocatalyst. In addition, platinum (Pt), a well-known noble cocatalyst for H2 evolution, was also loaded onto CdS NRs by photodeposition method, and the corresponding photocatalytic performance for dehydrogenation of BA as well as H2 evolution in water with Pt/CdS were evaluated (Figs. 3d and S5). Impressively, we found that Pt/CdS showed very poor performance for H2 production with a rate of 1.9 µmol h−1 in our present study, indicating that Pt is not a proper cocatalyst to abstract protons for hydrogen production from BA to produce H2 under the tested conditions."
9,Photophysical and ESR studies,"3.4 Photophysical and ESR studies The photophysical properties of the Co/CdS NRs photocatalyst were further studied to explain the dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution. The UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra show that the absorption of Co/CdS NRs is slightly redshifted in the visible region, whereas the band gap absorption remained unchanged (Fig. S6), indicating that the deposition of Co nanoparticles did not change the bandgap of CdS. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of pure CdS NRs shows an intense luminescence band centered at 508 nm and a broad luminescence band at 712 nm under an excitation wavelength of 405 nm (Fig. 4 a), which is consistent with previous reports [31]. The luminescence intensity of Co/CdS NRs is much smaller than that of pure CdS NRs. This phenomenon probably results from efficient electron transfer in the Co/CdS NRs hybrid system from CdS to Co, leading to the spatial separation of electrons and holes. The fast electron transfer process can be further confirmed by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra, as shown in Fig. 4b. The PL intensity of Co/CdS NRs decayed much faster than that of pure CdS NRs, indicating that the composite system has shorter PL lifetimes and faster charge transfer capability than pure CdS NRs. These two features can facilitate photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA to produce more H2 and benzaldehyde. To better understand the photocatalytic process of dehydrogenation of BA, ESR technique using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a trapping regent was used to monitor the reaction intermediates in-situ. The typical ESR spectrum of the catalyst suspension containing BA, under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), is presented in Fig. 5 . The result shows six EPR peaks with similar intensity, which can be assigned to DMPO-carbon centered radical (DMPO-C) formed by trapping with C on DMPO [36]. This observation indicates C induced by the photogenerated holes are the key intermediates for photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA. A quantitative analysis of this spectrum was carried out to determine the g factor and hyperfine coupling constants for the nitroxide nitrogen (aN) and the proton adjacent to nitroxide nitrogen group (aHβ). The result shows that the g factor is 2.0063 with aN = 14.57 and aHβ = 21.58, which match well with the simulated ESR spectra of DMPO-CH(OH)Ph and are also similar to the reported values for DMPO-C in the literature [37]. Based on this detected reactive intermediate, it can be proposed that CH(OH)Ph is the key radical species during photocatalytic process. On the other hand, we noticed that the selectivity for benzaldehyde production is strongly dependent on the concentration of BA in acetonitrile solution. To determine the products, GC–MS analysis was carried out. The mass spectrometry result shows that benzaldehyde (C7H6O+, m/z = 106.05), a certain amount of hydrobenzoin (hemolysis of hydrobenzoin to give C7H7O+, m/z = 107.06), and some unknown species are produced (Fig. S7). In contrast, the mass peaks belonging to hydrobenzoin are very small when the photocatalytic experiment was performed in diluted BA solution (0.5 vol%), which further confirms the high selectivity for benzaldehyde production in this condition. The observed hydrobenzoin is probably formed by the CC coupling reaction between the CH(OH)Ph species."
10,The photocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 The photocatalytic mechanism Based on above results and analysis, we propose a mechanism for photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA over Co/CdS NRs (Scheme 1 ). Under visible light irradiation, CdS NRs absorbs photons and generates electron-hole pairs. In the presence of BA, the photogenerated holes can oxidize BA to produce CH(OH)Ph species. Subsequently, these CH(OH)Ph species are further oxidized by holes to produce benzaldehyde. Meanwhile, when the BA concentration increases, CC homocoupling reaction in these CH(OH)Ph species is evidently competing with benzaldehyde production, leading to the formation of hydrobenzoin. On the reductive side, the protons abstracted from BA were reduced to H2 by the photogenerated electrons. The introduction of Co nanoparticles over CdS significantly enhance the performance of photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA, which can be explained by the following factors: (1) In-situ formation of Co nanoparticles can improve the transfer of photogenerated electrons, thus suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs. (2) Taking into consideration the fact that in-situ photodeposited Pt sample (Pt/CdS) showed negligible effect compared to Co/CdS composite under the same conditions, the unique catalytic activity of Co and the interface between Co nanoparticles and BA are crucial to the efficient dehydrogenation of BA."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have realized efficient photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA for simultaneous H2 evolution and benzaldehyde production over Co/CdS NRs under visible light. We found that the concentrations of BA significantly influence both H2 evolution rate and the selectivity of carbonyl compounds via C mediated mechanism. The best hydrogen evolution performance was achieved in 50 vol% BA acetonitrile solution with an average apparent quantum yield of 63.2% at 420 nm, which is the highest value ever reported for hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA. This present work can provide an effective strategy for creating highly efficient photosynthesis systems using neither noble metal cocatalyst nor sacrificial electron donors."
