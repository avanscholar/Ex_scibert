0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of the global economy, the demand for energy is becoming more intense. Hydrogen is a kind of excellent energy carrier with high energy density and environment-friendly. Therefore, hydrogen is recognized as the most development prospect for future energy [1,2]. For the development and utilization of hydrogen energy, hydrogen production and storage are important research subjects [3–5]. There are many hydrogen production methods such as reforming of natural gas [6], gasification of coal [7] and biomass [8], electrolytic water [9], photolytic water [10]. Comparing with the above methods, hydrogen generation by metal hydrolysis is a very important method, since metals are easy to store and convenient to transport. For example, hydrogen was produced from water by reacting with Mg-based materials [11–13] or Al-based materials [14] etc. Furthermore, Al is an abundant element on the earth with a low-cost, and can react with water to produce 1245 mL of hydrogen per gram Al (at standard state). Meanwhile, the by-products of Al(OH)3 and AlOOH are not harmful to the environment, and they can be recycled through the traditional Al electrolysis process (Hall-Heroult process) [15]. The major obstacle for producing hydrogen by Al-H2O reaction is that a dense oxide layer on the Al surface which can stop the reaction of Al-H2O. To break down the oxide layer, Al reacting directly with alkaline solution was a simple method [16–18]. But alkaline solutions were easy to corrode equipment. Later, researchers found that doped metals [19–24], salts [25–28], oxides [29–33], hydride [34,35] and so on into Al powder also destroyed the oxide layer on the surface of Al particles to improve the activity of Al with water. Fan et al. [36] found that the amount of hydrogen production of Al-In-Zn-NaCl composite reached 1035.0 mL g−1. They thought that the negative potential of Al-In alloy decreased from −1.1 to −1.5 V because of doping Zn, which benefited for activating Al. And doped-NaCl could effectively prevent the alloy agglomeration during ball milling, improve the conductivity of the hydrolytic solution and accelerate the electrochemical corrosion rate of Al. Xu et al. [37] studied the hydrogen production materials of Al-SnCl2. They proved that there was a solid-solid reaction between Al and SnCl2 in the process of ball milling, and the in-situ produced Sn and AlCl3 had stronger activity than the directly doped ones. At the same time, they found the hydrogen performance of Al-SnCl2-Bi ternary composite was further improved and its hydrogen production reached 1049.0 mL g−1 at ambient temperature. In addition, a large number of references [19,33–38,51,52] reported that metal Bi could speed up the reaction of Al with water. An et al. [20] found that introduction of Bi could greatly promote the hydrolysis reaction of Al-Ga-In-Sn. The hydrogen generation yield of Al-Ga-In-Sn-Bi reached to the theoretical yield (about 560 mL 0.5 g−1) from about 100 mL 0.5 g−1 of Al-Ga-In-Sn. Zhao et al. [33] illustrated that metal Bi was produced in situ during ball milling Al-BiOCl, resulting in the conversion yield of Al-BiOCl approaching 91.6%. Xu et al. [37] also demonstrated that Bi can catalyze the Al-H2O reaction according to the density functional theory (DFT). Recently, Wang et al. [38] reported that hydrogen generation material of Al-(Co-Fe-B) was prepared by hand-mixing Al with Co-Fe-B alloy. The experimental results showed that the conversion yield and maximum hydrogen generation rate of Al-(Co-Fe-B) were 50.0% and 3.0 mL g−1 min−1 at 45 °C, respectively. Obviously, doped Co-Fe-B alloy to Al powders could increase the reactivity of Al with H2O. However, its hydrogen releasing rate was too slow to meet the actual requirements. In this work, Ni-Bi-B alloy was synthesized by means of chemical reduction method. A novel Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite was prepared through mechanical ball milling Al, InCl3 and homemade Ni-Bi-B alloy. The performance of hydrogen generation of this material has been systematically studied. Up to know, there is no report on Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) for hydrogen generation. Our experimental results prove Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) compose is an efficient hydrogen generation material."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and apparatus,"2.1 Reagents and apparatus Aluminum powders (Angang Group Aluminum Powder Co., Ltd., mean size of 10 µm, 99% purity), InCl3 (Alfa Aesar, 99% purity), NiCl2⋅6H2O (Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd., 98% purity), BiCl3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99% purity) and NaBH4 (Aladdin, 98% purity) were used as the starting materials. The Al-based composites were prepared by the planetary ball miller (Retsch PM400, Germany)."
3,Preparation of Ni-Bi-B alloy,"2.2 Preparation of Ni-Bi-B alloy The Ni-Bi-B alloy was synthesized through chemical reduction method. The reaction mechanism of Ni-Bi-B prepared through NiCl2, BiCl3 and NaBH4 can be described as the following equations according to literature [38]: (1) B H 4 − + 2 N i 2 + + 4 O H − ⟶ B O 2 − + 2 Ni ↓ + 2 H 2 ↑ + 2 H 2 O (2) B H 4 − + 3 B i 3 + + 4 O H − ⟶ B O 2 − + 3 Bi ↓ + 2 H 2 ↑ + 2 H 2 O (3) 2 B H 4 − + 2 H 2 O ⟶ 2 B ↓ + 2 O H − + 5 H 2 ↑ (4) B H 4 − + 2 H 2 O ⟶ B O 2 − + 4 H 2 ↑ To prepare Ni-Bi-B alloy, NiCl2⋅6H2O (0.5 g) and BiCl3 (0.1–0.7 g) were firstly dissolved in a beaker contained 70 mL distilled water under stirring to obtain solution A. NaBH4 (0.5 g) was dissolved 50 mL distilled water. Then the NaBH4 solution was slowly dropped into the above solution A at stirring condition. After the redox reaction was complete, an obtained black precipitate was filtered; the residue was washed respectively with distilled water three times and anhydrous alcohol three times in time. Finally, the precipitate was dried in the air. The obtained product was named as Ni-Bi-B alloy."
4,Preparation of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite,"2.3 Preparation of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite Al powders, InCl3 and Ni-Bi-B were weighted in different mass ratios and put into a stainless steel milling jars (500 mL) with the steel balls (10 mm in diameter). The ball to powder mass ratio was 60:1. The Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite was prepared by ball milling. The ball milling condition was that 250 rpm of rotation speed and 5 h of ball milling time. In order to prevent samples from oxidation, the samples were handled in a filled Ar glove box (MBraun, Germany)."
5,Hydrogen generation and characterization,"2.4 Hydrogen generation and characterization The hydrogen generation reactions of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composites were carried out in a sealed reactor. The water displacement method was used to obtain the volume of releasing H2. The equipment used to evaluate hydrogen generation performance was the same as our previous published report [39]. Firstly, the composite powder (0.1 g) was placed into a 250 mL reactor in a glove box. Then the reactor was put in thermostatic water bath to keep the temperature constant at 298.15 K. When the system reached equilibrium, 10 mL distilled water with the same temperature was injected into the reactor. The releasing gas flowed through a condenser pipe and drying tube to cool and dry the gas before entering the gas collection bottle. The mass of water displaced was weighed by electronic balance (UX2200H, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) and automatically recorded the mass change by the computer per second. Lastly, the mass of displaced water was converted into the volume of H2 at 298.15 K through measuring the actual temperature of the gas. At the same time, a blank test was carried out and the blank value would be deducted from the measured values. Each experiment was repeated three times at least. The surface area of Ni-Bi-B was determined by the physical adsorption instrument (BET, AUTOSORB-IQ, Quantachrome, USA). The phase structures of Ni-Bi-B, Al-based composites and its by-products of hydrolysis were identified by using Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8-Advance, Germany). The experimental conditions were as 40 kV working voltage, 40 mA current, Cu Kα radiation, 5°∼ 90° scanning range, 10° min−1 scanning speed and 0.01° ∼ 0.02° per step. Meanwhile, the chemical composition of prepared Ni-Bi-B alloy and residue of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) after hydrolysis were also studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). The micro morphology of sample was observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-5600LV, JEOL Ltd., Japan) and a transmission electron microscope as well as selected area electron diffraction pattern (TEM and SADP, Talos F200X, FEI company, USA) and the corresponding elemental mapping of the samples were obtained using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of Ni-Bi-B,"3.1 Characterization of Ni-Bi-B Samples with fixed mass of NaBH4 and NiCl2⋅6H2O, Ni-Bi-B alloys and different contents of BiCl3 (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 g) were marked as Ni-9 wt% Bi-B, Ni-23 wt% Bi-B, Ni-33 wt% Bi-B and Ni-41 wt% Bi-B, respectively. From Fig. 1 , the surface morphology of Ni-Bi-B has undergone great change; that is its surface becomes loose and porous as the BiCl3 mass increasing from 0.1 to 0.3 g, owing to release gas during the process of synthetic reaction (see Eqs. (1)–(4)). When the amount of BiCl3 increases to 0.5 g, the number of pores of Ni-33 wt% Bi-B further increases. However, Ni-41 wt% Bi-B appears a significant agglomeration as the mass of BiCl3 reaches to 0.7 g. This is probably due to the excess BiCl3 does not completely react with NaBH4, resulting in the remaining BiCl3 adheres to the surface of Ni-Bi-B alloy. The specific surface area and pore volume of Ni-Bi-B calculated by BET data (see Table 1 ) increase with increasing the mass of BiCl3; namely, it is from 19.8 m2 g−1 and 0.043 m3 g−1 (for Ni-9 wt% Bi-B) to 32.2 m2 g−1 and 0.169 m3 g−1 (for Ni-33 wt% Bi-B), respectively. However, when continuously increasing BiCl3 to 0.7 g, the specific surface area and pore volume (for Ni-41 wt% Bi-B) decrease to 21.7 m2 g−1 and 0.079 m3 g−1. These results are agreement with above SEM images (Fig. 1). That is Ni-33 wt% Bi-B has the most holes and largest specific surface area. The result implies that the Ni-33 wt% Bi-B maybe have good activity on the reaction of Al-H2O. The phase structures of Ni-Bi-B alloys were characterized by XRD (see Fig. 2 ). From Fig. 2, there are only peaks of Bi on these XRD spectra. To prove the existence of Ni and B in the Ni-Bi-B alloys, the Ni-Bi-B sample was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, see Fig. S1). Fig. S1 demonstrates the sample consists of Ni, Bi, and B elements. Meanwhile, Fig. S1(b) reveals the element Ni exists as Ni0 and Ni2+ [40]. The element Bi occurs as Bi0 and Bi3+ (see Fig S1c) [41,42]; the element B as B0 and B3+ (see Fig S1d) [43] in the Ni-Bi-B sample. These oxide species (such as Ni2+, Bi3+ and B3+) may be formed in the process of Ni-Bi-B alloy prepared, because of oxygen dissolving in NaBH4 solution may oxidize these atoms [41]. These oxidation species, elemental Ni and B cannot however be observed in XRD curve, owing to their amount may be too little. Above analysis results indicate that main compositions of the Ni-Bi-B alloy are elemental Ni, Bi and B."
8,Effect of Ni-Bi-B on the hydrogen generation of Al-InCl3,"3.2 Effect of Ni-Bi-B on the hydrogen generation of Al-InCl3 To study the effect of Ni-Bi-B on hydrogen generation performance of Al-InCl3, Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite was prepared by partially substituted InCl3 with Ni-Bi-B. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics curves of hydrogen evolution for Al-10 wt% InCl3, Al-10 wt% (Ni-33 wt% Bi-B) and Al-5 wt% InCl3-5 wt% (Ni-33 wt% Bi-B) mixtures at room temperature. From Fig. 3, Al-10 wt% (Ni-33 wt% Bi-B) hardly reacts with water, and its hydrogen yield is only 5.8 mL g−1; and the hydrolysis reaction of Al-10 wt% InCl3 proceeds very slowly and only releases 186.9 mL hydrogen per g mixture. After InCl3 is partially replaced Ni-Bi-Bi, it is found that the hydrogen generation rate obviously accelerates and releasing hydrogen amount significantly increase for Al-5 wt% InCl3-5 wt% (Ni-33 wt% Bi-B). Namely, the releasing hydrogen amount and conversion yield of Al-5 wt% InCl3-5 wt% (Ni-33 wt% Bi-B) reach to 1184.5 mL g−1 and 96.7% in 10 min, respectively. The hydrogen production performances are better than that of Mg-Mg2Si in 0.5 M MgCl2 solution (688 mL g−1 and 96.7% in 10 min) [44]. Therefore, it demonstrates there is the synergistic effect of InCl3 and Ni-Bi-B on activation of Al. The hydrogen generation performances of Al-5 wt% InCl3-5 wt% (Ni-x wt% Bi-B) (x = 9, 23, 33 or 41) are summarized in Fig. 4 . The Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composites almost cannot react with water when the x is 9 wt% in Ni-Bi-B. Nevertheless, with increasing x from 9 wt% to 33 wt%, both the conversion yield and maximum hydrogen generation (mHG) rate enhance. For example, the hydrolysis properties of Al-InCl3-(Ni-33 wt% Bi-B) composite are the best, namely its conversion yield and mHG rate achieve 96.7% and 528.0 mL g−1 min−1, respectively. Further increasing x to 41 wt%, the hydrolysis performances begin to decrease. Its conversion yield drops to 93.5%; and mHG rate reduces to 462 mL g−1 min−1. Hereby, Al-InCl3-(Ni-33 wt% Bi-B) composite is selected for further exploration of the hydrolysis properties of the Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B)."
9,Effects of doped content of Ni-Bi-B,"3.3 Effects of doped content of Ni-Bi-B A series of Al-5 wt% InCl3-y wt% (Ni-Bi-B) (y = 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 or 17) composites were prepared, with a fixed InCl3 content of 5 wt% and varied Ni-33 wt% Bi-B content. The effects of Ni-Bi-B contents on the hydrogen production of composites were studied. Table 2 exhibits hydrogen generation performances of the Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite with different amounts of Ni-Bi-B at 298.15 K. According to the Table 2, the conversion yield of the composites all increase firstly and then decrease with increasing the content of Ni-Bi-B. Such as the conversion yield and the mHG rate are only 33.6% and 348.0 g−1 min−1 when the content of y is 3. As the y reaches to 7, its conversion yield reaches 100.0%. And its hydrogen yield and mHG rate reach to 1196.8 mL g−1 and 687.0 mL g−1 min−1, respectively. The mHG rate is higher than those of H-Mg3La (43.8 mL g−1 min−1), H-La2Mg17 (40.1 mL g−1 min−1) [45], H-Mg3CeNi0.1 (276 mL g−1 min−1) [46], H-MgMm (71 mL g−1 min−1) [47] and Mg-10 wt% MoS2 (542 mL g−1 min−1) [48]. But further increasing y to 15 and 17, their conversions reduce to 92.5% and 74.0%, respectively. This is because Ni-Bi-B does not produce hydrogen itself, leading to reduce its hydrogen production performances as its content exceeds a certain value. Therefore, the doped 7 wt% Ni-Bi-B (that is y = 7) is an optimum value for this Al-InCl3 mixture."
10,Effects of InCl3,"3.4 Effects of InCl3 A series of Al-z wt% InCl3-7 wt% (Ni-Bi-B) (z = 3, 5, 8, 10, 13) composites were prepared for investigating effects of different contents of InCl3 by fixing Ni-Bi-B content as 7 wt% and changing InCl3 content. The related results present in Table 3 . According to the Table 3, when InCl3 content increases from 3 wt% to 5 wt%, the conversion yield of the composites increased obviously from 92.2% to 100.0%, and the H2 yield was from 1128.6 mL g−1 to 1196.8 mL g−1, respectively. But, their corresponding mHG rates are only 303.0 and 687.0 mL g−1 min−1. When the content of InCl3 is 8 wt%, the conversion decreases to 92.8%; but its mHG rate reaches to maximum value (2103.0 mL g−1 min−1). Further increasing the content of InCl3 to 10 wt% or 13 wt%, their conversion yields obviously fall; but the mHG rates basically stay the same. The research indicates that doped InCl3 mainly improves the rate of hydrogen generation of the composite. In the light of the previous study [49,50], inorganic salts, as a grinding aid, make the size of Al particles to become small and produce a lot of defects in the milling process. Therefore, doped InCl3 can enhance the activity of aluminum-reaction. However, the InCl3 can't release H2 itself and too much doped content will lead to a lower amount of hydrogen production."
11,Effect of milling time,"3.5 Effect of milling time A series of Al-5 wt% InCl3-7 wt% (Ni-Bi-B) composites were prepared by changing only the milling time (0.5, 1, 3 or 5 h), hydrogen evolution and microstructure were studied. Table 4 summarizes the hydrogen generation performances of Al-5 wt% InCl3-7 wt% (Ni-Bi-B) with different ball milling times. From Table 4, it can be seen that when the ball milling time is 0.5 h, the conversion yield of the material reaches 59.1%, the hydrogen yield and the mHG rate are 707.7 mL g−1 and 1605 mL g−1 min−1, respectively. It indicates that the composite at this time already possesses better hydrolysis performance. For prolonging the ball milling time to 3 h, the conversion yield enhances to 86.0%. Further extending the ball milling to 5 h, the conversion yield reaches to the highest value (100.0%). But the hydrogen generation rate reduces to 687.0 mL g−1 min−1. In order to understand the effect of ball milling time on the hydrolysis of composites, the SEM images of the materials with different ball milling time are presented in Fig. S2. From Fig. S2(a), as milled for 0.5 h, Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite forms large particles with laminar structure, and there are many cracks and defects on these particles surfaces because of cold rolling and tensile fracture during ball milling process. Prolonging ball milling time to 3 h (see Fig. S2c), flaky particles are ground into small pieces. Continuing to extend the milling time to 5 h, the size of particle is decreased obviously (see Fig. S2d), leading to rise the activity of the material. Therefore, with prolonging ball milling time from 0.5 to 5 h, the conversion yield enhances from 51.9% to 100%."
12,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.6 Effect of reaction temperature The hydrolytic properties of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composites were tested at different initial reaction temperatures 273.15, 298.15, 308.15, 318.15 and 338.15 K (see Fig. 5 ). The Aluminum-water reaction is exothermic reaction, so raising reaction temperature is beneficial to improve the performance of hydrogen generation of the composite. With elevating temperature from 273.15 to 298.15 K, the hydrogen yield increased from 987.0 mL g−1 to 1196.8 mL g−1. From Fig. 5(a), when the temperature rises from 273.15 to 338.15 K, the mHG rate steadily rises from 87.0 to 3579.0 mL g−1 min−1. According to the Arrhenius equation, a curve of lnk vs. 1/T based on the mHG rate at different temperatures is presented in Fig. 5(b). The apparent activation energy of the reaction of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite with water is obtained as 22.4 kJ mol−1 based on the Fig. 5. The value is obviously lower than that from the references (see Table 5 ). For a chemical reaction, the lower the activation energy of the reaction, the reactivity of reactant is higher. Therefore, doped Ni-Bi-B and InCl3 effectively improve the reactivity of Al with water by reducing the activation energy of the Al-H2O reaction."
13,Mechanism study,"3.7 Mechanism study In order to study the mechanism of hydrogen generation from the reaction of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite with water, XRD analysis of the composite was carried out before and after reaction. These results are presented in Fig. S3. According to Fig. S3(a), there are the peaks of Al and In in curve a, but no peaks of Ni, Bi, B and InCl3 before reaction. According to the literature [37], the metal In ascribed to be a product after ball milling of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) and the other product is AlCl3. It demonstrates that a solid phase reaction occurs between Al and InCl3 during ball milling process. In order to further study the phase structure of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B), it was characterized by SADP. These results are presented in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6(b), it proves that the phase of metal Bi [104] exists besides the phases of metal Al ([111], [200]) and metal In [110]. But the phases of metal Ni and B are still not observed. Therefore, the TEM-EDS analysis of the Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite was carried out. The results are presented in Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7, the TEM image (left) shows that the composite is grainy. The EDS images of the corresponding particles (upper right for Al, In and Cl−, bottom right for Ni, Bi and B, respectively) prove that the Ni and B do exist in the Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite. And that metal In, Ni and Bi evenly distribute on the surface of the Al particles and B mainly distributes at the boundary of the composite. Therefore, these analysis results show there are various active sites, such as active surface of Al, Al-In (Ni/B or Bi/B) and Al-AlCl3 after ball milling, which are benefit for improving the performance of hydrogen generation of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite. After the reaction of Al with H2O was completed, the residue was analyzed by both SADP and XRD. Figs. 6(d) and S3(b) indicate that the phase of In [110] still exists and the phase of Al(OH)3 ([201], [202]) appears, while the phase of Al disappears in the residue. It makes clear that the reaction of Al with water is almost completed, and In acts as a catalyst in the reaction. For the reason of the phase of Bi disappearing (see Fig. 6), it ascribed to that the Bi is completely covered by a large number of Al(OH)3. The XPS analysis illustrates there are Bi, Ni and B in the residue (see Fig.S4). From Figs. S4(e-g), the XPS spectra of Bi, Ni and B are the same as those of Figs. S1(b-d). It demonstrates that the Ni, Bi and B also act as catalysts, that forms the micro galvanic cells of Al-Ni/B and Al-Bi/B to improve the performances of hydrogen generation of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) according to literature [38]. In a word, hydrogen generation mechanism of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composite can be explained in detail as follows. Firstly, Al particles repeatedly crush to rupture the oxide film on the aluminum surface, some defects and fresh surfaces of high chemical activity are produced under mechanical ball milling process. Secondly, two active products of AlCl3 and In are produced in situ, because a solid phase reaction occurs between InCl3 with Al in ball milling process. Therefore, five active sites of fresh surface/defects, Al-AlCl3, Al-In, Al-Bi/B and Al-Ni/B are produced during the ball milling process. The effects of AlCl3, defects and fresh surfaces are the same as those reported in literature [14,36,37]. And in situ produced In and doped Ni-Bi-B can form micro galvanic cells with Al (such as Al-In [36], Al-Bi/B [19,33,37,38,51] and Al-Ni/B [38]). To sum up, their synergistic effects greatly increase the activity of Al, leading to its conversion yield to 100.0% for Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B)."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) composites have been prepared by ball milling Al powder with InCl3 and homemade Ni-Bi-B alloy. The research shows doped-(Ni-Bi-B) can significantly improve the chemical activity of Al-InCl3 through reducing the apparent activation energy of the reaction of Al-H2O to 22.4 kJ mol−1. And with increasing the mass of BiCl3 in the Ni-Bi-B alloy, the catalytic action of Ni-Bi-B enhances for Al-InCl3. Under optimal conditions, the hydrogen generation yield of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B) achieves to 1196.8 mL g−1, and its conversion yield rises to 100.0% at room temperature. Mechanism study indicates that a solid phase reaction happens to produce in situ AlCl3 and metal In during the ball milling process. Therefore, five active sites of fresh surfaces/defects of Al particles, Al-AlCl3, Al-In, Al-Bi/B and Al-Ni/B are produced. The produced AlCl3 can cut aluminum into smaller particles in the ball milling process, form HCl and releasing dissolution heat as contacting with water; leading to accelerate the hydrogen releasing reaction of Al-H2O. More importantly, the produced In and doped Ni-Bi-B uniformly distributes on the surface of the Al particles and forms multiple micro galvanic cells; further improving the hydrogen generation performance of Al-InCl3-(Ni-Bi-B). In general, the novel hydrogen production material proposed in this paper is hopeful to be applied as hydrogen source to supply hydrogen for fuel cells of portable devices."
