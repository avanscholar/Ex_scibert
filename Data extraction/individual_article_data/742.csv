0,Introduction,"Energy, water and environment are considered the main requirements for sustainability. The demand for energy continuously increases, and it is now estimated that by 2040, the increasing demand for power will result in a 90% rise in the power demand compared to 2018. In addition, more than half-million tons of HCl and NaOH waste per year needs to be treated so that it has a minimum polluting effect on the environment, as reported by the European General Galvanizers Association (EGGA). Electrolysis is among possible solutions for these issues. Hydrogen and chlorine gas can be extracted from HCl through electrolysis. Chaplin (2019) noted that having more than one product during an electrochemical technology will make it more efficient and economical. An electrolysis process that produces hydrogen and chlorine gases plus reducing the wastewater is an example of such process. In addition to that, the produced chlorine can be used in water treatment process. Hydrogen is a promising alternative fuel option and for renewable energy storage. Hydrogen production is sustainable and can be produced using different supplies like brackish water, industrial wastewater, and domestic wastewater. The most mature and commercialized water splitting electrolysis technology is the alkaline electrolysis. Their capital cost is lowest; however, they suffer low partial load range, limited current density, and low operating pressure. Another conventional type of electrolysis is the proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, which is also called the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM). PEM features low membrane thickness that provides high proton conductivity, low gas permeability, compact design, and the possibility of operating at high pressure. Unlike alkaline electrolysis, PEM electrolysis is suitable for intermittent power input and also capable of operation at higher current density. However, the proton exchange provides corrosive acidic environment. The wetted material should, therefore, withstand the harsh acidic environment and the high applied overvoltage at high current densities. Lei et al. (2019) used PEM to maintain variable pH conditions across the cell with hydrogen produced inside an acidic solution, and oxygen evolved under alkaline condition. They reported reduction in energy consumption of about 30% to 35% compared to conventional alkaline processes. Another type of electrolysis is the anion exchange membranes (AEMs) electrolysis. The main difference between alkaline and AEM electrolysis is the use of AEM instead of the conventional diaphragm in alkaline water electrolysis. They combine the benefits of both PEM and alkaline electrolysis. In summary, their ability to work with no corrosive environment and without a noble metal catalyst allows them to have more stability for hydrogen production and low-cost technology (Vincent and Bessarabov, 2018). Vincent and Bessarabov (2018) concluded that “the overall performance of the AEM electrolyzer must be increased to further reduce the total cost of hydrogen production.” Cho et al. (2018) aimed to construct a more durable and high-performance electrolyzer through studying the effects of catholyte feed method and anode binder content on the features of AEM electrolysis. They concluded that dry cathode operation improved the performance of the AEM electrolyzer. Wu and Scott (2012) investigated the use of ionomer to improve the transporting the OH− ion in the catalyst layer of their AEM electrolysis. They reported “good current density performances and promising stability,” but raised concerns about the stability of the ionomer. The ionomer severs as the physical binder and ion conductor transporting the OH− ion in the catalyst layer, playing a vital role in the development of the fuel cell performance (Gao et al., 2017). Park et al. (2019) developed high-performance AEM electrolysis through investigating various parameters. They examined the effects of the fabrication method of the membrane electrode assembly, operating conditions, and membrane electrode assembly parameters. They reported outstanding performance improvement of the electrochemical reactions and achieved current density of 1.15 and 1.5 A cm−2 at 1.8 and 1.9 V. They contributed that mainly to the optimization procedure and the use of the ionomer. Chen et al. (2017) built a reverse electro-electrodialysis (REED) system, which basically uses acid-base industrial waste streams to generate hydrogen. They used anion and cation exchange membranes in the system with acid-base wastes, i.e. HCl, NaCl, and NaOH. They concluded good feasibility of using the produced power from the reverse electrodialysis section to produce hydrogen. However, they noted that this method suffers from inefficient power output resulting in low production rate of hydrogen. A similar concept was presented by Tufa et al. (2018) who combined reverse electrodialysis and alkaline water electrolysis to produce hydrogen using sulfate (SO4 2−)-rich industrial wastewater. Their pilot scale and their lab-scale setups used a series of anion and cation exchange membranes. The maximum hydrogen production rate achieved by the setups was 50 cm3/h·cm2 with 1.85 V/cell, 2.5 M KOH, and 48 °C. They proposed further work targeting assessment of required pre-treatment and investigating other wastewater resources for power generation. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production systems have received significant interest due to the sustainable nature of the process. Integrating hydrogen production with solar energy is a promising direction for a sustainable energy source. However, PEC technology is still in the development stage and faces challenges. PEC cell is based on using semiconductors as electrodes separated by a membrane in a cell immersed in an electrolyte (Ahmed and Dincer, 2019). Acar and Dincer (2017) performed an experimental and thermodynamic investigation on a hybrid chlor-alkali photoelectrochemical hydrogen production system. The system utilizes PEC and electrochemical (through PV cell) processes to maximize the utilization of the solar spectrum. They reported an increase in the current generation and hydrogen production rate with an increase in temperature and light intensity. Cl2 and NaOH were produced as byproducts, while energy and exergy efficiencies decreased with increasing temperatures. Karakilcik et al. (2018) analyzed the performance of a hybrid chlor-alkali reactor assisted by a solar pond and used photoelectrochemical method. PV cells were used to provide the required power to the reactor, and the proposed system produced hydrogen, Cl2, and NaOH. Using heat from the solar pond resulted in increasing hydrogen production and decreasing energy and exergy efficiencies. Vermaas et al. (2015) presented a photo-assisted water splitting device using a bipolar membrane, allowing the cathode to operate in an acidic electrolyte while the photoanode to operate in alkaline conditions. Water splitting achieved at both extreme pH gradients (0–14) as well as mild pH gradients (0–7) yields with current densities of 2–2.5 mA/cm2. Guo et al. (2019) analyzed energy and mass flow in the photocatalytic water splitting process. A comprehensive description of the energy flow and mass flow in photocatalytic water splitting from multiple spatiotemporal scales was provided. Low efficiencies of photocatalytic water splitting were attributed to obstacles in energy flow and mass flow and also to non-coupling and mismatching between the two flows. The study showed that “in addition to the material optimization, the scientific and engineered design of sunlight collection, interfacial reaction, and mass transfer is of great significance.” In a review provided by Ahmed and Dincer (2019) where aspects of PEC design, modeling and simulation, and materials were presented in terms of basics, previous work, current status, and opportunities for future research strategies. It was pointed out that there is a need to increase the solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency from current value of less than 1% for a single PEC electrode to at least 10% through improving PEC design, understanding the basics of each reaction, and better material preparation for the PEC application. PEC should be designed to have maximum exposure to light and to have optimal orientation for the release of produced gases and solar irradiation. They pointed out that both computational simulations and experimental verification are required to have a complete theoretical model and to fully understand the microscopic physics mechanisms of the PEC. In terms of materials, the authors suggested focusing on electronic structure, photoelectrode crystallinity, and interfacial engineering to improve PEC performance. TiO2 is one of the semiconductors used in PEC systems. It was the first semiconductor used by Fujihima and Honda (1972). It attracted a lot of attention recently as a result of its excellent properties like long-term stability, excellent photocatalytic performance, easy accessibility, non-toxicity, and low price. However, its performance is restricted by a faster charge recombination rate that limits its photocatalytic activity and by the fact that it is mainly activated by UV light, which limits the use of a wide range of the solar spectrum (Fajrina and Tahir, 2019). It is worth mentioning that there are electrochemical technologies that are mainly used for removing organic pollutants from wastewater streams using oxidization without hydrogen production. These methods are divided into two categories: direct and indirect electrolysis. In direct electrolysis, the pollutants exchange electrons directly with the anode surface without the involvement of other substances. On the other hand, in indirect electrolysis, organic pollutants exchange electrons with the anode surface through the mediation of some electroactive species acting as intermediaries for electrons between the electrode and the organic compounds. Reviews of electrochemical technologies for removing organic pollutants from wastewater streams are presented by Sirés et al. (2014), Brillas and Martínez-Huitle (2015), Ganiyu et al. (2018), Martínez-Huitle and Panizza (2018). In their latest review of electrochemical technologies, Martínez-Huitle and Panizza (2018) concluded that the future for the applicability of these technologies is bright because their combination with conventional wastewater treatment systems is conceptually feasible. They suggested that close collaboration between engineers and scientists is crucial to ensure the effective application and exploitation of these electrochemical technologies. Further, hydrochloric acid waste, when filtered of impurities, can be recycled to chlorine through chemical or electrochemical processes that have been recently established in the chemical industry (Bechtel et al., 2019). At present, there are two methods implemented to obtain chlorine. The first method is the breakdown of HCl into H2 and Cl2, while the other method utilizes oxygen-consuming cathode to generate chlorine and water. The so-called Bayer-Hoechst-Uhde is considered the main state of the art; its process utilized aqueous HCl (Bechtel et al., 2018). Another process that emerged recently is Dupont and Denora (Eames and Newman, 1995). They utilize gaseous HCl as it results in improved thermodynamics and mass transfer limitations. In both cases, the current production for Cl2 is 99%. One can note, oxygen evolution or electrolysis of water in the concentrated HCl does not take place in this event. This is evident since the concentration of HCl is high (pH = 0). This is well established in the literature through the brine electrolysis, chlor-alkali process electrolysis, sodium chloride electrolysis (Paidar et al., 2016). Whereas the method of utilizing oxygen-consuming cathode (Kuwertz et al., 2013) gives a combined advantage of utilizing gaseous HCl, and the process is thermodynamically spontaneous. This process is fairly new and only presented in recent publications. Although studies in the field of electrochemical wastewater treatment show treatment and decontamination of organic matter from textile and synthetic wastewater through a combination of modified metal oxide electrodes (Brillas and Martínez-Huitle, 2015; Sirés et al., 2014; Subba Rao and Venkatarangaiah, 2014; Zhang et al., 2019), no study is reported that combines both photoelectrochemical hydrogen and chlorine production and spent hydrochloric acid treatment in one unique reactor. Moreover, other related previous studies focused on a single objective type reactor (Ambler and Logan, 2011; Jeremiasse et al., 2010; Kundu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010). In this study, we present a novel photoelectrochemical reactor that incorporates photoelectrochemical techniques for the production of hydrogen and chlorine gas from spent hydrochloric acid generated in the galvanizing industry. Also, we present a unique design of the cathode corrosion-resistant high surface area (3 × the anode) results in good proton and H+ transfer rate while the TiO2 coated photoanode further enhances the charge transfer process and chlorine gas production. The option of having such a system that can treat waste acid and produce hydrogen and chlorine gases efficiently enables integrating the system in the chemical industries for energy recovery while reducing environmental impact."
1,Experimental setup and procedure,"The setup of the photoelectrochemical reactor, fabrication of the coated stainless steel as an anode, preparation of TiO2 sol-gel solution are discussed in detail. Also, the surface characterization method of the coated stainless steel, electrochemical techniques and thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are explained in this section."
2,Photoelectrochemical setup and electrode preparation,"2.1 Photoelectrochemical setup and electrode preparation Stainless steel 316 mesh (Metal supermarket, CAN) with a nominal thickness of 0.378 mm is used as the electrodes. Three stainless steel mesh are cut into a circular shape with a total area of 45.6 cm2. The mesh plates are stacked and rotated 30° along the surface of the first plate to provide high surface area and to collect hydrogen gas from the reactor efficiently, as shown in Fig. 1 . The oxidation half-reaction takes place at the anode: 2Cl − ➔ Cl 2 + 2e − while at the cathode, the half reduction reaction is: 2H + + 2e − ➔ H 2 The electrolyte flows through the first quadrant of the circular endplate plate at the cathode compartment and exits at the second quadrant of the same plate with Cl2. H2 exits at the top of the cathode compartment. Gas diffusion layers and gaskets are used to separate gas-liquid mixture inside the reactor compartments. The novel reactor design all the hydrogen gas to escape from the reactor, and in this way, there is no dead zone left inside the reactor. A quartz glass is installed above the anode compartment of the reactor to pass UV light transmission coming from the sun. The reactor is pressure tested for any leaks or gas mixing between the compartments prior to any testing. 5 M of synthetic HCl (sigma Aldrich, CAN) is used as the electrolyte simulate the acid waste from the galvanizing industry. In order to collect hydrogen and chlorine gases, two burettes are placed upside down, the volume of the HCl is displaced inside the burettes using a syringe. Under hydrogen and chlorine gas production, the gas displaces the volume of the HCl in the burettes, and the change in volume is recorded. The experiments are repeated multiple times, and the reported results have been obtained after 3 sets of experiments, to eliminate any errors and ensure no anomalies occurring for accuracy. For electrochemical implementation techniques, experiments require specific processes/steps to be successful. For instance, at the beginning of the experiment open circuit regime requires the test to run infinitely to establish a reproducible potential, for cyclic voltammogram, the first couple cycles of the experiment are not accurate due to double-layer capacitance and concentration profile at the surface of the electrode; thus 3rd or 4th cycle is reportable. Also, for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the scan rate should be in the interval of 5 to 10 mV/s, and the test should be implemented after an open circuit regime is established with minimal noise, especially when scanning in the range lower than 1 Hz."
3,Preparation of the NPs and coating technique,"2.2 Preparation of the NPs and coating technique Application of optimum coating method for fabrication of photoanode depends on various factors such as energy demand, production volume, flexibility, etc. There are several physical and chemical coating techniques described in the literature, such as spin coating, dip coating, screen printing, physical vapor deposition, chemical bath deposition, chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel method, etc. (Shakeel Ahmad et al., 2017). Since the dip coating process is a well-known, simple, and reliable coating process (Dehghanghadikolaei et al., 2018), TiO2 NPs are deposited on the stainless steel anode plate by using a sol-gel procedure and dip coating method, as explained by Chehade et al. (2018). The sol-gel solution is prepared by adding 25 mL titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP), 5 mL acetic acid, and 3.5 mL nitric acid into 500 m L deionized water under continuous stirring. After that, the solution is heated up to 80 °C for 30 min, and then it is stirred 2 h continuously at a constant temperature. Stainless steel mesh is treated with 1 M H2SO4 for 75 min, and then it is rinsed with deionized water. Finally, it is washed with alcohol and then rinsed deionized water again to remove all the oil, dust, and particles from the surface of the stainless steel plate. The TiO2 NPs are deposited on the cleaned stainless steel plate by immersing the plate into the prepared sol-gel solution and then lifting it with the withdrawal velocity of 10 cm/min via a dip coating device. The coated stainless steel plate is dried at the room temperature then it is annealed at 500 °C for 2 h. The temperature is increased gradually in increments of 15 °C/min to reach 500 °C. After reaching 500 °C the plate kept in the oven at constant temperature for 30 min. It is reported that the TiO2 NPs have shown excellent corrosion resistance when coated on the 316L stainless steel in dark conditions (Shen et al., 2005). Also, the durability of the anodes was enhanced by ten times with the addition of 25 wt% of TiO2 NPs (Kariman and Marshall, 2019). Since these results indicate the high durability of TiO2, only the performance of TiO2 coated stainless steel as an anode, is investigated in this study. The fate and transport of TiO2 NPs might another subject of further studies."
4,Characterization of the coated anode,"2.3 Characterization of the coated anode After the annealing process, a sample (1 cm × 1 cm) was cut off from the coated stainless steel plate to examine the morphology and the crystal structure of the deposited TiO2 nanoparticles. The surface image of the TiO2 coated anode is analyzed by using scanning electron microscope Philips XL 30 SFEG (SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis is conducted by the help of a detector that has 139 eV resolution and 5 mm working distance, mounted on top of the microscope, to view and detect elemental composition, precise spot on the field and coating of the TiO2."
5,Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques,"2.4 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques The electrochemical setup for the proposed reactor consists of the TiO2 coated photoanode as a working electrode (WE), and the cathode as a counter electrode (CE). The TiO2 coated anode is the sample being studied, and it contains a region of interest. Here the Cathode (CE) is 3× the surface area of the working electrode to minimize polarization effects. The Gamry 3000 potentiostat is used to supply the desired voltage or current to the photoelectrochemical reactor for all electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests. All the data obtained is recorded to computer and analyzed by the software. Open circuit potential (OCP) test of the photoelectrochemical is performed under 30 second periods of sunlight chopping to visualize the effect of coated NPs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments are conducted in the standard full reactor set up. The Gamry 3000 potentiostat sends an oscillating AC voltage at frequency range 0.1 to 100,000 Hz on top of a DC biased voltage. The amplitude of the AC signal is usually very small, between 1 mV and 10 mV, and finally, a circuit is built and derived based on the results. Linear and cyclic voltammetry tests are performed by sweeping forward and backward the potential of the TiO2 coated electrode from −0.2 V to 2.5 V under sunlight and without sunlight conditions. The production of hydrogen and chlorine gases is tested by supplying continuous potential difference (1.8 and 2 V) under potentiostatic mode with and without sunlight. Hydrogen and chlorine gases are collected and measured by using water displacement method."
6,Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses,"A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis is performed for the photoelectrochemical reactor in order to examine the system performance and feasibility. The energy and exergy analysis is used as a benchmark to elucidate the role of efficiencies of the reactor. Following are the general balance equations for energy and exergy analysis: Mass balance equation: (1) ∑ i m ̇ i = ∑ e m ̇ e Energy balance equation: (2) Q ̇ i + W ̇ i + ∑ i m i ̇ h i + V i 2 2 + g Z i = Q ̇ e + W ̇ e + ∑ e m ̇ e h e + V e 2 2 + g Z e Entropy balance equation: (3) ∑ i m ̇ i s i + S ̇ gen + ∑ i Q ̇ k T k = ∑ e m ̇ e s e + ∑ e Q ̇ k T k Exergy balance equation: (4) ∑ i m ̇ i ex i + E ̇ x Q + E ̇ x w = ∑ e m ̇ e ex e + E ̇ x w + E ̇ x Q + E ̇ x d The energy efficiency is defined as the ratio of desired products (chlorine and hydrogen gas) produced in the photoelectrochemical reactor to the total amount of useful energy input as follows: (5) η en = n H 2 ̇ ∙ HH V H 2 + n Cl 2 ̇ ∙ h Cl 2 W e ̇ The exergy efficiency is defined as the ratio of the exergy flow rate of chlorine and hydrogen gas to the exergy flow rate supplied to the system as follows: (6) η ex = n H 2 ̇ ∙ ex H 2 + n ̇ Cl 2 ∙ ex Cl 2 W e ̇ The current efficiency of chlorine is defined as the volume of produced chlorine gas to the theoretical chlorine volume that calculated from the average current at an applied potential as follows: (7) η Cl 2 = V Cl 2 experimental I × t × V m a × F The current efficiency of hydrogen is defined as the volume of produced hydrogen gas to the theoretical hydrogen volume that is calculated from the average current at an applied potential as follows: (8) η Cl 2 = V Cl 2 experimental I × t × V m a × F The quantum efficiency is defined as the moles of hydrogen and chlorine gas produced to the total number of reacted incident photons as follows: (9) ∅ = n H 2 + n Cl 2 I r × A membrane T cost rate balance based on exergy rate of a given system is written as (10) ∑ C ̇ in + W ̇ c in + Z ̇ = ∑ C ̇ out + W ̇ c out The cost rate for the photoelectrochemical reactor is defined as (11) C electrical W ̇ electrical + Z ̇ PEC = C H 2 Ex ̇ H 2 + C Cl 2 Ex ̇ Cl 2 The annual investment cost rate of the photoelectrochemical reactor Z ̇ PEC is the total capital investment cost rate over the system operation time defined as follows: (12) Z ̇ PEC = TCC t operation The total capital investment cost is the sum of the capital cost and the operation & maintenance cost calculated in terms of capital recovery factor which accounts for the number of years and the annual interest rate as follows: (13) TCC = CRF CC + OM Here the annual interest rate selected is 10% and a PEC lifetime of 8 years. The capital recovery factor is found based on the following equation: (14) CRF = i 1 + i n 1 + i n − 1 The cost of the PEC reactor based on the material and catalyst purchased is $500.Also, the maintenance cost is selected to be 2.2% of the total cost of the system and is found as follows: (15) OM = CC × OM ratio"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Electrochemical techniques and results,"4.1 Electrochemical techniques and results The photoelectrochemical reactor is tested through various electrochemical techniques. The coated TiO2 photoanode is connected to the working lead along with the blue sense while the cathode electrode is connected to the counter lead along with the reference wire of the Gamry 3000 potentiostat. The synthetic solution was prepared as representing waste HCl (5 M) solution is pumped to the reactor at a flow rate of 300 mL/min. Then the reactor is tested for open circuit potential after resting for 30 min to acquire a steady state. Testing of OCP is commonly done before any other electrochemical technique to obtain information about the nature of the coated electrode/electrolyte (synthetic waste HCl solution) interface, prior to then subjecting the electrode to a specific electrochemical reaction(s). Because the OCP is dependent on many factors such as dissolved oxidant or metal passivity, it is used as an indicator of these conditions for determining reproducibility in specimen preparation. Straka et al. (2008) have determined the extent of the damage of TiO2 coating on stainless steel by measurement of OCP during the deformation of a coated specimen under UV illumination. Fig. 2 shows the results of the OCP under 30 s sunlight chopping intervals. When the reactor is exposed to light, the TiO2 coated anode surface is now polarized anodically by the photons, and the potential of the reactor drops 3 mV indicating a current flow through the working electrode. However, when there is no light, the magnitude of the current passing flowing through the working electrode and counter electrode decrease indicating less anodic dissolution at an OCP of 1.289 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a highly versatile technique for coatings and electrocatalysts. However, the interpretation of EIS data is highly dependent on the electrical circuit model derived and its link to physical reality. In this test, the DC voltage is set to 0 V, while the oscillating AC voltage is set to 5 mV at the frequency range from 100,000 Hz to 0.1 Hz. The photoelectrochemical reactor is subjected to sunlight. Under these conditions, the potentiostat measures both the amplitude and the phase angle of the AC. Here the results of the EIS are fitted/described by the circuit in Fig. 3 (b), where a finite-length Warburg impedance is shown as a low-frequency arc from the Nyquist plot. The phase angle of the Warburg impedance is 45° and is better illustrated/shown in the Bode plot of Fig. 3(a). Also, the constant–phase element (CPE) represents the resistance/capacitance that is spread along with the porous-coated TiO2 electrode/membrane interface which contributes to the RC transmission line effect. Table 1 shows the results of the electrical circuit. The resistance of the HCl electrolyte Ru is 0.723 Ω, which is in the accepted range, while the polarization resistance is 0.00953 Ω. Wang et al. (2014) revealed that the appearance of a capacitive semicircle is a sign of deterioration in the corrosion resistance of titanium. The photonic energy of the concentrated sunlight on the photoelectrochemical reactor with respect to the TiO2 coated anode attributes to the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions. Here, linear and cyclic voltammetry tests are applied. The experimental protocol in order to conduct a linear voltammetry test is simple: the potential of the TiO2 coated photoelectrode is forward within a pre-set voltage regime, and the current is recorded. Fig. 4 shows the results of the linear voltammetry test. The reduction potential under sunlight condition starts at 1.7 V, and the sharp increase in current density from 10 mA/cm2 to 80 mA/cm2 represents the rate of electron transfer and hydrogen, and chlorine production is taking place. The behavior of the photocurrent density with applied overpotential is similar to that of water splitting by TiO2 (Shen et al., 2018). Whereas the results without sunlight are significantly poor. The recorded reduction potential is 2 V, and the maximum current density is 30 mA/cm2 with no signs of hydrogen or chlorine gas production. Also, similar to Linear voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry technique is used to determine and confirm the voltage regime of reduction of HCl, and the extent of reversibility associated with charge transfer and mass transfer. Fig. 5 presents the cyclic voltammetry regime results at 100 mV/s and 200 mV/s, for each given scan rate, the voltage is cycled 10 times, and only the 5th cycle is selected. The reduction potential is 1.7 V, which agrees with the linear voltammetry test results under sunlight condition. The cyclic voltammetry technique applied to the anode shows ideal behavior of the double layer capacitance (CPE) and the quasi-capacitance (qc) behavior of TiO2 that is confirmed in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results in Fig. 3 and is similar of a capacitor and resistance in parallel (Panić et al., 2003). Here, the resistance did not originate from the HCl solution since there is a well-established double-layer behavior, and the concentration of the acid is very high. Thus, this resistance is due to the thin film formed on the anode as confirmed in the EIS results as well as by the sharp redox of TiO2 in the cyclic voltammetry. To assess the electrochemical characteristics of the coated photoanode in the chlorine gas evolution reaction, the HCl pH (−1.1) based on industrially relevant conditions is used whereas the general domain for electrochemical water treatment is neutral pH. According to equations 1 and 2 in Table 2 , a high pH increases the thermodynamic control over to the chlorine gas formation reaction (Dionigi et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). The redox reaction peaks of the titanium species in the presence of proton ions above 0.65 V is due to the chlorine evolution reaction. Note, although the oxygen evolution reaction is thermodynamically favorable over the chlorine evolution reaction, the chlorine evolution reaction involves the exchange of two electrons, while the oxygen evolution reaction requires four electrons. Also, chlorine evolution reaction involves just one intermediate. In light of this fact, the kinetics of the chlorine reaction is much faster than those of the oxygen reaction, and the predominant reaction on the oxide electrocatalyst surface in acidic environments is chlorine evolution reaction (Moradi and Dehghanian, 2014). The investigation of the photoelectrochemical hydrogen and chlorine production is performed outdoors at Clean Energy Research Laboratory. The photoelectrochemical potentiostatic experiments are performed with and without sunlight at an applied reduction potential of 1.8 V and 2 V (based on the results of the linear and cyclic voltammetry). Fig. 6 shows the J-V results. At an applied reduction potential of 1.8 V with and without sunlight, the J-V behavior is parallel. With sunlight at a light intensity of 1800 W/m2 and 1:00 pm EST, the average current density is much higher 13.46 mA/cm2, and the hydrogen production is tripled as observed in Table 3 . Also, at an applied potential of 2 V, with sunlight achieved an average current density of 16.05 mA/cm2 and chlorine gas production of 17 mL. While without sunlight at 2 V, the J-V behavior is not stable. As the reaction proceeds without sunlight, the reactant (waste HCl) is gradually consumed, so the equilibrium potential of the H/H+ redox pair shifts to a more cathodic potential. As a result, the potential suddenly starts to drop again, until a concentration profile establishes again at the electrode surface."
9,Characterization of surface morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles,"4.2 Characterization of surface morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles TiO2 is the most extensively studied transitional metal oxide that has wide band gap. Rutile, Anatase, and Brookite are the well-known crystalline structures of TiO2 with band gaps (Eg) of 3.02, 3.2, and 2.96 eV, respectively (Singh and Dutta, 2018). In order to understand the role of TiO2 surface morphology, the chemical composition of the nanostructured photoanode and their role in quantum efficiency and the performance of the photoelectrochemical reactor for hydrogen and chlorine production, surface characterization and analysis using, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) are used. Fig. 7 (a) shows the EDX-spectrum of a ~2 μm for the nanostructured photoanode, which is heat-treated for 3 h at 550 °C. The calcination time and temperature significantly affect the surface area, morphology porosity, and crystallinity of the TiO2 nanoparticles (Zhu et al., 2007). Here it is clear from the spectrum that the nanoparticles are coated homogeneously on the SS substrate; peaks of oxygen and titanium indicate the formation of TiO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 7(b) shows SEM results of the TiO2 coated photoanode, the homogenous array of holes in the photoanode, where TiO2 presents a nanocrystalline cubic structure. The cubic structure of TiO2 shows higher activity with wavelengths within the main peak of the solar irradiation energy; in this way, more energy can be captured from the sunlight available in the Earth (Mattesini et al., 2004)."
10,The efficiency of the photoelectrochemical reactor,"4.3 The efficiency of the photoelectrochemical reactor The feasibility and performance of the newly developed photoelectrochemical reactor are assessed through energy, exergy, quantum, and current efficiency. The photoactivity of the TiO2 coated anode reached a quantum efficiency of 6.93% at sunlight intensity of 1800 W/m2 and applied the potential of 2 V, as observed in Fig. 8 . This due to the efficient electron transfer and high catalytic activity of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The results of the quantum efficiencies of this study in the field of photocatalysis of hydrogen and chlorine production are compared to other several studies. Jin et al. (2007) used CuO/TiO2 coated anode with an apparent quantum efficiency of 5.1% while Abe et al. (2002) used Pt instead of Cu as Pt/TiO2 photoanode and observed a quantum efficiency of 2%. Here in this study the maximum observed quantum efficiency is 6% while the maximum energy and exergy efficiencies are observed at an applied voltage of 1.8 V under sunlight illumination are 45.55% and 73.75%."
11,Exergoeconomic results of the photoelectrochemical reactor,"4.4 Exergoeconomic results of the photoelectrochemical reactor Every year the galvanizing industry spends vast amounts of money on disposal of waste HCl. The waste HCl is neutralized with NaOH, and produced sludge is sent to landfill. Besides this, the waste HCl contains about 100–130 g/L iron and 60–200 g/L zinc ions that means loss of valuable materials to the environment (Stocks, Wood, and Guy 2005). The exergy cost of the photoelectrochemical reactor varies based on the hydrogen and chlorine cost production rate. Here, the selected annual interest rate is 10%, while the life of the photoelectrochemical reactor is 5 years. The capital recovery cost is found to be 0.187 yr−1 based on the conditions presented in Table 4 . The change in the exergy cost with respect to sunlight illumination shows an improvement due to the photonic energy provided to the surface of the coated TiO2 photoanode. Fig. 9 shows that the lowest exergy cost rate for hydrogen production is observed at 1.7 $/kg with sunlight, and the chlorine production is found to be 0.3 $/kg at an applied voltage of 2 V. On the other hand, the maximum exergy cost rate for hydrogen and chlorine production is observed with no light at an applied voltage of 1.8 V. In a similar study Acar and Dincer (2017) accessed the exergoeconomic of a photoelectrochemical reactor for hydrogen and chlorine production, the cost of hydrogen is found to be 3.64 $/kg at 290 K while the chlorine cost is found to be 0.87 $/kg. The high cost of hydrogen and chlorine is based on the cost of the reactor which included the use of photovoltaic arrays for heat generation. Treatment of waste acid requires more than one advance treatment method, and this results in the high cost of the process. The utilization of solar energy and waste HCl in the photoelectrolysis process with AEM increases system efficiencies and consumes less energy."
12,Conclusions,"TiO2 NPs are successfully deposited on the stainless-steel anode and tested under sunlight. The maximum current density is obtained as 16.05 mA/cm2 under sunlight illumination and an applied potential difference of 2 V. At this point, the hydrogen gas and chlorine gas production rates are calculated as 3 mL/min and 0.5 mL/min, respectively. Also, the maximum energy and exergy efficiencies are observed at an applied voltage of 1.8 V under sunlight illumination are 45.55% and 73.75%. The exergoeconomic results show that the exergy cost of hydrogen and chlorine production of 1.7 $/kg and 0.3 $/kg is lowest at an applied potential of 2 V and with sunlight illumination. It can be concluded that using waste acid as an electrolyte in photoelectrochemical reactor prevents environmental pollution and provides alternative energy sources as hydrogen. Also, the produced chlorine gas is a disinfecting chemical compound that can be utilized in water treatment plants, which is another benefit of the system."
