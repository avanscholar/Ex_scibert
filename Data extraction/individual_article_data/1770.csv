0,Introduction,"The major challenges of clean energy and environmental pollution have led to the development of photocatalysis technologies for energy conversion and degradation of refractory pollutants. Over the years, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a clean and potent oxidant, has become recognized as an ideal fuel cell carrier, acting as a good substitute for H2 [1–3].However, H2O2 is generally produced by anthraquinone oxidation and electrocatalytic reaction route, which is very expensive and has complex synthesis routes [4,5]. In this context, semiconductor photocatalysis is regarded to be a promising technology for producing H2O2 and degrading refractory pollutants. In recent years, carbon-based materials with unique active sites of forming vacancies or introducing functional groups, have been studied extensively for the photocatalytic production of H2O2 instead of using high-cost noble metals [6–8]. For example, Wang et al. [9] reported that nitrogen vacancy carbon nitride was used to produce H2O2 of 1010 μmol·L−1 in 60 min under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). In parallel, a great number of photocatalysts that can efficiently degrade pollutants have been widely explored, such as metal oxides [10–12] and Bi-based photocatalysts [13–15]. For instance, Wang et al. prepared Bi2WO6/Fe3O4/BC with excellent ability to remove ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin [16].In the latest report, multifunctional photocatalysts were gradually studied. Yang et al. developed a facile route to modulate the structure of carbon nitride (CN), which had dual functions (degradation of refractory pollutants and generation of hydrogen peroxide) [17]. Xiong et al. reported a ternary porous reticulate heterostructure, with improved capability to generate H2O2 and degrade pollutants under visible-light irradiation [18]. However, these photocatalysts generally generated low H2O2 yields or had poor degradation performance because of their intrinsically inadequate light harvesting ability and rapid charge carrier recombination. This resulted in their poor photocatalytic performance. There is therefore the need to develop efficient, dual-functional heterostructure composites, with ameliorated the band gap deficit and improved photoinduced charge carrier transfer. BiOX and CdSe photocatalysts have gained much attention owing to their narrow bandgap, chemical stability, abundance, and environmental benignity. However, rapid recombination of photoinduced e- and h+ pairs restricted their applications. Researches have shown that ion doping [11,19] and coupling with semiconductors [20–22] are effective strategies that can be to obtain better photocatalytic performance for the removal of water pollutants. In particular, much attention has been given to the fabrication of Z-scheme heterojunctions due to their outstanding advantages [23]. In Z-scheme heterojunctions, conduction band (CB) electrons at lower potential combine with valence band (VB) holes on the other semiconductor. This helps the holes in one semiconductor to maintain their higher oxidation capability, and the electrons on the other semiconductor to maintain their stronger reduction capability of [15,24,25]. Zhao et al. [25] successfully synthesized Bi4O5Br2/g-C3N4 Z-scheme composites, that produced high H2O2 of 124 μmol·L−1 in 60 min, which was much higher than that of pure Bi4O5Br2 or g-C3N4. Pan et al. [26] fabricated Z-scheme CdS/CQDs/BiOCl heterojunction,whit enhanced photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol. In addition, selenium (Se), in the same group of element with oxygen consisting of different valences (Se2−, Se0, Se2+, Se4+), can bring extra electronic states and facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers [27]. Xie et al. demonstrated that Se of + 4 valence state provided extra electronic states in anatase TiO2 by doping and effectively extending the absorption band to the visible light range [28]. Moreover, the purpose of doping semiconductor nanoparticles could also alter the band structure [29,30]. Therefore, it is inferred that the photocatalytic activity and H2O2-producing capability of photocatalysts can be optimized by incorporating Se heteroatoms into Z-scheme heterojunction materials. This is because Se doping can provide additional oxygen vacancy active sites, which means that where there is a catalytic insert in the BiOBr semiconducting phase, both the defects and the heterojunction exist in the photocatalytic material simultaneously, thereby further enhancing its photocatalytic performance. Ciprofloxacin (CIP), a common fluoroquinolone antibiotic (FQ), is widely employed to fight infections in humans and livestock. It is reported that CIP has been frequently detected in various water matrices [31], and conventional wastewater treatments for CIP, such as physical adsorption, chemical oxidation, biochemical technologies have been inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to generating secondary pollution [16,32,33]. Therefore, improved strategies of removing CIP are required, especially in real water matrix. Herein, we described a simple solvothermal strategy for the preparation of Z-scheme CdSe/Se/BiOBr nano-composites in Se-rich conditions. The composites had dual functions: could produce H2O2 and remove CIP under visible light. Their ability to degrade CIP was further investigated in actual water samples, including deionized water, tap water, Wei River water, factory water, and domestic effluent water. Furthermore, the trapping experiments and electron spin resonance proved the hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and hole (h+) were primary species involved in the process of generating H2O2 and degrading CIP. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report so far on Z-scheme CdSe/Se/BiOBr composites with dual functions, which are to product H2O2 and degrade refractory pollutants."

3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation First, Se-rich CdSe nanospheres were synthesized using a mild solvothermal method. In detail, 0.592 g of Se powder was dispersed in a 10 mL of 16 mM NaBH4 aqueous solution and stirred (500 rpm) for 2 h. In Parallel, 0.147 g of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O was dispersed in 40 mL of water and dissolved completely. Subsequently, the above solutions were mixed together and ultrasonicated for 30 min. Their pH was adjusted to 11.7 by the addition of NH3·H2O and stirred for another 30 min. The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the material was separated, rinsed with water and ethanol several times, and dried overnight at 60 °C. It was labeled as Sample 1. Second, 4.8 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 4.8 mmol KBr were added to mixture A consisting of 28 mL ethylene glycol and 12 mL H2O and stirred (500 rpm) until completely dissolved. Further, some amount of the Sample 1 was added to mixture B consisting of 10 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of water to make the weight ratio of Sample 1: BiOBr to 0.1, 1, 2, and 5 wt%. The corresponding CdSe/Se/BiOBr products were labeled as CSB-0.1, CSB-1, CSB-2, and CSB-5, respectively. Afterwards, the two solutions A and B were mixed by stirring for 1 h (500 rpm) and were heated at 110 °C for 10 h. The solid product was isolated by filtration. Then it was rinsed, and dried."
4,Characterization method and photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.3 Characterization method and photoelectrochemical measurements The crystal phase of the samples was determined in the 2θ range of 5-70° by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a Bruker-D8-Axs diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The micromorphology and inner structures were determined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8000), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2100), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The surface composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Thermo Escalab 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer with Mg Kα radiation. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed using a UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer), with BaSO4 as the reference. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 400 with KBr as the reference. The optical properties and lifetime were explored by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The specific surface area of degassed samples was calculated by multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis according to adsorption isotherms. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and the electron spin resonance (ESR) signals were detected at room temperature in DMPO solution using an ESR spectrometer (Bruker, JES-FA200). The total organic carbon (TOC) of the solution was quantified with a TOC analyzer (TOC-S2017001912, Elementer). The electrochemical properties of the samples were determined using a traditional three-electrode electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany). 0.03 g sample was used as the working electrode after being dispersed in 2 mL ethanol solution. Ag/AgCl and a Pt plate formed the reference and counter electrodes, respectively, and the electrolyte was Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 mol·L−1). The working electrodes with an exposed area of 1 × 1 cm2 were prepared by drop-casting ethanol suspensions of samples onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) slice substrates. Then, they were dried to form a film. Photocurrent response curves were recorded with light on and off, using a 300 W xenon lamp. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using the potentiostatic method (5 mV) from 0.01 to 100 kHz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were also performed at a scan rate of 50 mV·s−1."
5,H2O2 generation,"2.4 H2O2 generation 50 mg CSB was dispersed in deionized water (50 mL) containing 5% HCOOH through O2 bubbling for 30 min to reach an O2 equilibrium environment. Then, the solutions were stirred in the dark for another 30 min to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, 5 W LED lamps were turned on to mimic visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The concentration of H2O2 was analyzed using the potassium titanium (IV) oxalate method, the absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a UV-2900 spectrometer."
6,Photocatalytic degradation,"2.5 Photocatalytic degradation The photocatalytic activity of the materials was evaluated by the degradation of CIP (20 mg·L−1), triclosan (TCS, 30 mg·L−1) and phenol (20 mg·L−1). The reaction was carried out in a jacketed reactor with 5 W LED lights, acting as simulated visible light. The photocatalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in 50 mL of CIP solution, and magnetically stirred in the dark. After irradiation was introduced, 3 mL of the liquid was filtered using a 0.22 μm millipore filter at certain time intervals. The supernatants were analyzed using a UV-2900 spectrometer at the maximum absorption wavelength of 269 nm to determine the CIP concentration. And the maximum absorption wavelength of TCS and phenol were at 280 nm and 270 nm, respectively. The catalysts were collected and rinsed repeatedly with water and ethanol after reaction and dried for cycling experiments."
7,Theoretical calculations,"2.6 Theoretical calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for CdSe and BiOBr, along with the embedding of Se in BiOBr, were conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation function was implemented using generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional was used. A plane wave cut-off energy of 400 eV was used to ensure sufficient precision. All of the atomic positions were fully relaxed until the residual force and the tolerance were smaller than 0.01 eV/Å and 10-6 eV/atom, respectively. For slab calculations, it was essential to passivate the dangling bonds of Cd, Se, and O with pseudo hydrogens of 1.5, 0.5, and 0.33 charges, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The crystal phases and structures of Se, CdSe/Se, BiOBr, and the composites were determined by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1 , two distinct microcrystalline structures of CdSe and Se crystals were combined as CdSe/Se. This included the peaks located at 25.4°, 42.0°, and 49.7°, which could be assigned to the zinc blende structure CdSe (JCPDS No. 88–2346), and the peaks located at 23.5°, 29.7°, 43.6°, and 51.7°, which were attributed to hexagonal Se (JCPDS No. 06–0362). The BiOBr sample was a tetragonal phase (JCPDS 85–0862) structure and had no impurity. As for the CSB samples, almost all of the diffraction peaks were attributed to the BiOBr phase due to the very small amount of CdSe/Se. Nevertheless, a weak peak at 2θ = 29.7° could be observed in the CSB-2 sample, which was attributed to the (101) facet of Se. To characterize the morphology and elemental distribution of the samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out. The CdSe/Se material comprised small particles with diameters of ~ 70 nm with agglomerate tendency (Fig. 2 a). Pure BiOBr had an irregular flower-like structure with a diameter of 6 µm, it was composed of numerous nanosheets with a thickness of ~ 50 nm and a length of ~ 1 µm (Fig. 2b). When CdSe/Se and BiOBr were combined during the hydrothermal process, it resulted in hydrangea-like nanostructures with ~ 2 µm diameters and composed of numerous nanosheets with 30–40 nm thicknesses (Fig. 2c, d). TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CSB-2 powder were shown in Fig. 2e. The corresponding HRTEM image showed three sets of crystal lattice fringe planar spaces of 0.281, 0.235, and 0.301 nm, which corresponded to the (102) plane of BiOBr, (111) plane of CdSe, and (101) plane of Se, respectively. XPS spectra of the BiOBr and CSB-2 heterostructures were shown in Fig. 3 . From the XPS survey spectra in Fig. 3a, the elements Bi, Br, and O from BiOBr could be clearly seen in CSB-2, while the elements Cd and Se from CdSe/Se could be observed in weak peak intensity due to their low concentrations. The surface composition of pristine CdSe/Se and BiOBr and CSB-2 was listed in Table 1 (standard deviations tests of three parallel XPS spectra in Fig. S1, Supporting Information). The C element was attributed to the adventitious carbon from XPS instrument, nonmetal Se was present in the composites. In the high-resolution spectra, the peaks at 164.4 and 159.1 eV (Fig. 3b), corresponding to Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2, respectively, demonstrated that the valency of Bi was + 3 [14]. The Bi (III) peaks in the CSB-2 composite shifted slightly to lower binding energy compared to those in pure BiOBr, which were likely affected by the interactions between CdSe/Se and BiOBr. Similar shifts were observed in the high-resolution spectra of Br (Fig. 3c) [21]. In Fig. 3d, two peaks at 412 and 405.3 eV, were attributed to Cd3d3/2 and Cd3d5/2, respectively. The high-resolution spectra of Se (Fig. 3e) with the binding energies of 53.25 eV and 54.9 eV, confirmed the presence of Se in the composite [34,35]. The O peaks of pristine BiOBr at 529.8 and 532.0 eV in Fig. 3f could be related to the Bi–O and OH, respectively. Upon comparison with BiOBr, CSB-2 could be divided to the third peak at 531.5 eV, due to the introduction of O vacancy. This indicated that the CSB-2 heterostructure had a high concentration of surface OVs [36,37]. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were used to detect the specific surface area (BET) and pore structure of CdSe/Se, BiOBr, and CSB-2. The results were shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1 (Supporting Information), respectively. Both N2 sorption isotherms could be classified as type IV, with an H3 hysteresis loop shape. The specific surface areas of the CdSe/Se, BiOBr, and CSB-2 were 8.751, 12.656, and 21.016 m2·g−1, respectively. A greater surface area would provide more active sites, potentially resulting in higher photocatalytic activity. Additionally, the CSB-2 sample had a different pore structure, with a mean pore diameter of 37.512 nm and a total pore volume of 0.205 cm3·g−1, exhibiting distinct mesoporous features. The mean pore diameters of CdSe/Se and BiOBr were both>50 nm, indicating that they had macropores on their surfaces. The high surface area and mesoporous structure of the CSB-2 sample indicate that it had great promise as an efficient photocatalyst. The optical properties of the samples were investigated through UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4 a. The absorption edge of CdSe/Se was at around 750 nm, and the absorption edge of pure BiOBr was located at 420 nm, indicating that both of them were excited under visible light irradiation. The absorption edge of CSB samples underwent significant red shift due to the introduction of CdSe/Se. Then the band gaps of CdSe/Se and BiOBr were calculated by drawing Tauc plots (Fig. 4b), with the formula mode identical to that in previous results [14]; they were approximately 1.72, and 2.70 eV, respectively [21,27,38,39]. The band structure was determined from the VB XPS spectra (Fig. 4c). The results showed that the VB positions of CdSe/Se and BiOBr were 1.19 and 2.78 eV, respectively. The relative positions of the CBs of CdSe and BiOBr were deduced from Eq. (1); the results revealed that the CBs of CdSe and BiOBr were −0.53 eV and −0.08 eV, respectively. (1) E V B = E C B + E g Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the molecular components of the samples. Wave plots from 4000 to 400 cm−1 were shown in Fig. 4d. The absorption peaks at 1627 cm−1 and 3443 cm−1 were attributed to the deformation of the OH bond; other stretching vibrations were CO at 2361 cm−1 [40]. CSB samples had a similar spectrum to that of BiOBr, and the characteristic stretching vibration of Cd-Se appeared at 624.34 cm−1 [41]. The characteristic peak at ~501 cm−1 was attributed to Bi − O vibrations [20], indicating the successful synthesis of the CSB composites. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is an excellent technique for studying the efficiency of samples to separate charge. Fig. 4e showed the PL spectra of the synthesized samples at an excitation wavelength of 385 nm. An emission peak intensity of CSB samples lower than that of pristine BiOBr implied that the formation of heterojunctions could restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. The transient fluorescence spectra of BiOBr and CSB-2 were given in Fig. 4f. When CdSe/Se was introduced into BiOBr, the average lifetime was lengthened, and the lifetime was calculated using Eq. (2): (2) τ = A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 + A 3 τ 3 2 A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 + A 3 τ 3 where, τ1, τ2, and τ3 are the PL fluorescent lifetimes at specific decay times, and A1, A2, and A3 are the relative pre-exponential factor weights. The relevant values could be found in Table S2 (Supporting Information), and the average lifetimes of BiOBr and CSB-2 were 6.445 and 17.649 ns. Electrochemical characterization is an important tool used to analyze the charge carrier separation and transfer of samples. Transient photocurrent responses were recorded with continuous 20 s on/off light illumination cycles. From Fig. 5 a, it could be seen that CSB-2 exhibited a higher photocurrent intensity than CdSe/Se or BiOBr, This showed that there was enhanced absorption of visible light and more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs in CSB-2. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the photocatalysts were investigated at a scanning rate of 50 mV·s−1 and a range of −0.4 to 0.4 V (Fig. 5b). Obviously, all samples had reversible voltammograms, and the redox potential of the CSB-2 electrode was stronger than that of other electrodes. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 5c) were performed with the size of the semicircle radius indicating the charge transfer efficiency. The CSB-2 sample had the smallest radius on the EIS Nyquist plot. This meant that there was greater photogeneration of carriers with CSB-2 and higher interface electron transfer in this photocatalytic process. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. 5d) showed that CSB-2 had the lowest onset potential, indicating that the photogeneration of electron-hole pair transfer was more efficient within this catalyst."
10,Photocatalytic H2O2 evolution and possible mechanism,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2O2 evolution and possible mechanism The photocatalytic production of H2O2 by the as-prepared samples in Fig. 6 a was examined under visible light irradiation. The H2O2 yield of all samples exhibited a clear, linear increase within 4 h. CSB-2 had the highest production of approximately 142.15 mg·L−1 (about 4180 μmol·L−1) in 4 h, which was ~ 1.6 times of that produced by pure BiOBr and 12 times of that produced by CdSe/Se. The concentrations of H2O2 obtained using CSB-0.1, CSB-1, and CSB-5 were 110.01, 115.23, and 128.02 mg·L−1 (about 3336, 3389, 3765 μmol·L−1) (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). This showed that an excessive load of CdSe/Se could inhibit photocatalytic activity. As a result, the optimal mass ratio of CdSe/Se and BiOBr was found to be 2 wt%. Consequently, the CSB-2 photocatalyst was used for the next experiments. For comparison, the H2O2 produced with different photocatalysts in recent reports were listed in Table 2 . It can be seen that CSB-2 had the higher capability to produce H2O2 than the other photocatalysts listed in the table (comparison only in terms of the type of catalysts and H2O2 yields in unit time). It was mostly superior to Bi-based materials of BiOCl and Bi4O5Br2/g-C3N4 [25,42], suggesting that it might be a promising candidate for the photocatalytic generation of H2O2. Also, the cycle experiments of H2O2 production were carried out over CSB-2 in Fig. 6b. After four runs, the yield of H2O2 produced could still reach 130.42 mg L−1, indicating that CSB-2 acted as a stable photocatalyst for the production of H2O2. The control experiments in Fig. 6c indicated that H2O2 could hardly be detected without a photocatalyst or in the absence of HCOOH. Also, 26.18 mg·L−1 of H2O2 could be generated in the air medium. Therefore, the crucial impact of HCOOH could not be neglected in this H2O2 production system. To further investigate the effect of HCOOH on H2O2, a three-electrode electrochemical workstation, with CSB-2 as the working electrodes, was adopted. As shown in Fig. 6d, after HCOOH was added into the electrolyte, the photocurrent response under illumination was greater than that in a 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution. This indicated that HCOOH captured photogenerated holes very rapidly, and then was immediately oxidized to generated active HCOO• [43], which resulted in the electron accumulation in CB of CSB-2 due to the slow migration process to react with absorbed oxygen, the photocurrent response was increased instantaneously [42]. The decomposition of HCOO• (Eq. (5)) could also increase the photocurrent response. After the near-surface-HCOOH was depleted for several seconds, the photocurrent corresponded to the no-HCOOH added in the CSB-2 process. (3) H C O O - + h + → H C O O · (4) H C O O · → C O 2 + H + + e C B The proposed H2O2 production mechanism was shown in Scheme 1 . The CB potential of CdSe/Se was more negative than the reduction potential of O2/H2O2 (Eθ(O2/H2O2) = +0.68 eV vs NHE). It could reduce O2 to H2O2 through two electron O2 reduction. The generated HCOO• could further react with OH– to form •OH, which was the main route of H2O2 production (Eqs. (5)–(7)): (5) HCOO · + OH - → · OH + HCOO - (6) 2 · O H → H 2 O 2 (7) O 2 + 2 e - + 2 H + → H 2 O 2"
11,Photocatalytic degradation properties and the possible mechanism,"3.3 Photocatalytic degradation properties and the possible mechanism The photocatalytic performances of the samples were evaluated though the photodegradation of CIP (20 mg·L−1) triclosan (TCS, 30 mg·L−1) and phenol (20 mg·L−1). Prior to light irradiation, all suspensions were stirred for 40 min in the dark to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium (Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 7 a, CSB composites with different mass ratios exhibited significant higher photocatalytic efficiency over bare CdSe/Se or BiOBr. The degradation efficiency of CIP was calculated by pseudo-first-order equation (Eq. (8)): (8) ln ( C / C 0 ) = - k t where k is the degradation rate constant, C0 is the initial concentration of CIP, C is the concentration at different times. Fig. 7b showed that the k value of CIP degradation by CSB-2 was 0.1124 min−1, nearly 5.35 times that of pristine BiOBr (0.0217 min−1) and 81.44 times that of pristine CdSe/Se (1.37 × 10−3 min−1). TCS and phenol (Fig. S5 a–d) had similar degradation results. CSB-2 exhibited the largest degradation efficiency for both compounds: 90.1 % and 97.2 % for TCS and phenol, respectively. To evaluate the mineralization of CIP during the reaction process, the total organic carbon (TOC) was detected over pure CdSe/Se, BiOBr, and CSB-2, as shown in Fig. 7c. After 30 min of photodegradation, it could be seen that 79.54% of the TOC was removed, revealing that the CSB-2 photocatalyst had excellent mineralization ability to decompose CIP. Furthermore, the potential environmental risks of photocatalytic CIP effluent were evaluated using E. coli DH5a (Fig. S6). where a 20 mg L−1 CIP solution dramatically inhibited the growth of DH5a. However, the growth of DH5a had a comparable concentration with the control group after CIP was degraded by CSB-2. The concentration was higher than the effluent obtained after CIP was degraded by BiOBr. This showed that antibacterial activity could be efficaciously eradicated via CSB-2 photocatalytic process under visible light irradiation. The cycle stability of the photocatalytic degradation of CIP by CSB-2 was investigated, with the results shown in Fig. 7d. After four cycles of CIP degradation, 86.25% CIP could still be degraded, indicating the high stability of the as-prepared materials. To further investigate the degradation effect in actual water, several natural water constituents were selected to test the degradation of CIP using CSB-2, including deionized water (DI water), tap water, Wei river water, wastewater from a mechanical processing factory, and domestic effluent water from Henan normal university. As shown in Fig. 7e, CIP was quickly degraded in DI water (97.5%). In tap water, CIP degradation was inhibited (87.4%) owing to existing interfering anions (i.e., ammonium and chloride ions) [47]. Furthermore, the degradation rates of CIP were decreased to 79.4%, 71.1%, and 63.8% in Wei river water, mechanical factory water, and domestic water, respectively. This reduced CIP removal rate could be attributed to the presence of organic matter and suspended solids in the water [48], which played competitive roles in the photocatalytic system. Moreover, other soluble anions (such as nitrite ion, chloridion) constituents could reduce the CIP degradation rate and decrease the light absorption of photocatalysts by quenching free radicals, or through the photo shielding effect [47,49]. Overall, although CIP degradation rate in the actual aqueous media was relatively lower than that in DI water, considerable degradation implied that CSB composites were applicable in the treatment of actual wastewater. To identify the main active species used for the degradation of CIP in the CSB-2 photocatalytic process, trapping experiments in the presence of quenchers were performed. Methyl alcohol (MA), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and ammonium oxalate (AO) were utilized to detect the oxidative species of superoxide radicals (•O2 −), hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and holes (h+), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7d, when MA was added, the degradation rate of CIP was slightly suppressed. However, when IPA was added, there was a marked decline in the degradation rate of CIP. CIP degradation was completely inhibited when AO was added. These results confirmed that h+ and •OH played vital roles in the system. ESR spin-trapping using DMPO as the trapping agent was conducted to determine the reactive species over CSB-2. Fig. 8 a and Fig. 8b showed that h+ could oxidize the trapping agent, with stronger signals indicating the presence of redundant trapping agents and lower h+. The spiculate signals gradually decreased along with 10 min illumination, and in comparison to BiOBr signals, the CSB-2 composite signals declined rapidly. This indicated that h+ played a significant role in the heterojunction photocatalytic process. As depicted in Fig. 8c, no DMPO-•OH ESR signal was observed under dark conditions. Notably, stronger characteristic four-line ESR signals were observed for CSB-2 than for pure BiOBr under visible light irradiation. This meant that much more •OH was present in the CSB-2 photocatalytic process. From the high-resolution XPS spectra of O1 s (Fig. 3f) above, the as-synthesized CSB-2 heterostructure had a high concentration of surface OVs. To further substantiate the structure of CSB-2, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of BiOBr and CSB-2 were obtained, as shown in Fig. 8d. All of the samples displayed a single Lorentzian line, and the g value of the sharp signal was 2.002 for CSB-2 owing to the electrons trapped at the OVs. No signal was observed for BiOBr, further confirming that OVs existed in CSB-2. The electronic structure of the semiconductors and the transfer route were also explored by DFT calculations. Unit cells with the following lattice parameters: a = b = c = 0.6007 nm; and a = b = 0.392 nm, c = 0.811 nm, were used to simulate bulk CdSe (111) and BiOBr (102), respectively, as shown in Fig. S7 (Supporting Information) [50,51]. The calculated CdSe band gaps were characteristic of direct inter-band transitions, and the calculated BiOBr band gaps were characteristic of indirect inter-band transitions, at 0.81 and 2.22 eV, respectively (Fig. 9 a, b). They were lower than the experimental values (1.72 eV for CdSe and 2.70 eV for BiOBr). The difference between the two measurements is similar to that in the present study. For example, Chen et al. calculated the Eg of BiOBr as 2.34 eV and its experimental value as 2.88 eV, [51,52]. After a small amount of Se doped into the BiOBr crystal structure decreased the band gap energy, the calculated Eg decreased to 2.09 eV (Fig. 9c). The density of states (DOS) was also calculated to study the elemental orbital contribution of band structures in Fig. 9d–f. The VBMs of CdSe were dominated by a hybrid Se 4p and Cd 4d and 4p hybrid orbital, and the CBM of CdSe by Se 4 s and Cd 5 s hybrid orbital, respectively. In addition, the VBM and the CBM of BiOBr were mainly derived from the O 2p-Br 4p orbital and Bi 6p orbital, respectively. After Se was injected into BiOBr, the Se 4p orbital became dedicated to the VBM of BiOBr in Fig. 9f, which could change the electronic structure and energy position. Next, the work function was analyzed by investigating the charge transfer efficiency at the interface. The values for the primarily exposed CdSe (111) and BiOBr (102) surfaces were determined according to Eq. (9) [53]: (9) Φ = E v a c - E F Here, EF is the Fermi energy and Evac is the electrostatic potential of the vacuum level. As shown in Fig. 9g–i, the values of the work function for CdSe and BiOBr and Se/BiOBr were 6.13 and 3.63 eV and 3.91 eV, respectively. This suggested that electrons could flow from BiOBr and Se/BiOBr to CdSe to achieve aligned Fermi levels, confirming that the pattern of electron transfer corresponded to Z-scheme heterojunctions. A possible photocatalytic mechanism for the CSB heterostructure is proposed, as depicted in Scheme 2 . Under visible light irradiation, optical excitation would occur as follows (Eqs. (10) – (11)): (10) C d S e + h υ → e C B - + h V B + (11) B i O B r + h υ → e C B - + h V B + The first conventional type-II heterojunction was assumed, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of CdSe were transferred to BiOBr, and the holes in the VB of BiOBr moved toward CdSe (Scheme 2a), with H2O molecules near the surface. The holes that theoretically accumulated in the VB of CdSe could not form •OH (Eq. (12)), and the electrons theoretically in the CB of BiOBr could not form •O2 – with dissolved O2 (Eq. (13)). This was inconsistent with the capture experiment [24]. Therefore, this potential mechanism was dismissed. (12) E θ H 2 O / · O H = 2.72 e V v s N H E > E V B C d S e (13) E θ O 2 / · O 2 - = - 0.33 e V v s N H E < E V B B i O B r Based on the above DFT calculations, a second potential mechanism involving Z-scheme heterojunctions which differ from traditional heterojunctions was shown in Scheme 2b. Here, the high redox performance of electrons and holes could be accumulated in the CB of CdSe/Se and the VB of BiOBr, respectively. This occurred with the help of Se that inhibited the recombination of holes and electrons via a Z-scheme process. Further, the above-mentioned migratory electrons could react with H2O2 generated under light irradiation to form •OH. These reactions were consistent with the experimental results (h+ and •OH had the most significant impact on the degradation of pollutants, with a small amount of H2O2 playing a supporting role). This supported the hypothetical Z-scheme mechanism. The reactive radicals were produced via the following pathway (Eqs. (14)–(19)): (14) C d S e + h υ → e C B - + h V B + (15) B i O B r + h υ → e C B - + h V B + (16) e C B - B i O B r + h V B + C d S e → h e a t o r h υ (17) h V B + B i O B r + O H - → · O H (18) H 2 O 2 + h υ → 2 · O H (19) h V B + / · O H + C I P → s m a l l m o l e c u l e s → C O 2 + H 2 O"
12,Conclusion,"In summary, a novel CdSe/Se/BiOBr composite with hydrangea-like structure was successfully fabricated using a hydrothermal process. This composite exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production and CIP degradation compared to pure CdSe/Se and BiOBr. Compared with previous reports on using BiOCl and Bi4O5Br2/g-C3N4 for H2O2 production [25,54], the CSB-2 composite showed improved photocatalytic production of H2O2. Furthermore, it had more excellent performances in degrading pollutants than the same BiOBr-based materials previously reported [14,55]. According to the results of the dual-functional performance, the reasons for the improved photocatalytic performance of CSB composite were threefold. First, the composite photocatalysts could harvest more visible light due to the specific energy band structure. Second, the Z-scheme heterojunction and oxygenvacancies inhibited the recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Finally, more •OH and h+ were generated, which was supported by trapping experiments and ESR spectroscopy. The optimized photocatalyst has great potentials in future solar-driven green synthesis and the removal of refractory organic pollutions from real water bodies."
