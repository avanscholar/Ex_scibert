0,Introduction,"Green renewable energy appliances such as solar cells in the modern era have become an innovation due to their lead in converting solar power to electricity. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are suitable current-stage solar cells to replace early-stage solar cells such as silicon stacked based-solar cells and thin film-based solar cells. DSSCs, also known as Grätzel cells, are small production cost, fabrication friendly, and have great advantage characteristics [1]. These current-generation solar cells more flexible and versatile for varying light requirements. A natural source or artificial light is commonly used for DSSCs measurement. DSSCs have more interest compared to silicon stacked based-solar cells and thin film-based solar cells [2]. Essential basic compartments in the DSSC fabrication: photoanode electrode, gel polymer electrolyte consisting of I–/I3 –, and platinum electrode [3,4]. To obtain the best DSSC performance with high stability, conductance, and no-leakage, the electrolyte should be in gel form to overcome and avoid the liquid and solid electrolyte problems [5,6]. Some research has been conducted on the GPEs containing single iodide salts such as potassium iodide [7], lithium iodide [8], tetrabutyl ammonium iodide [9], and sodium iodide [10], which are applied in DSSC fabrication. In searching the best performance of DSSCs, the blend of small size cation and large size cation has been introduced in the gel polymer electrolytes. The concept of double iodide salts in GPEs has been reported, such as tetrapropyl ammonium iodide-potassium iodide [11], tetrabutyl ammonium iodide-lithium iodide [12], tetrapropyl ammonium iodide-potassium iodide [13], tetrabutyl ammonium iodide-potassium iodide [14], tetrapropyl ammonium iodide-magnesium iodide [15], tetramethyl ammonium iodide-potassium iodide [16] and tetrahexyl ammonium iodide-rubidium iodide [17]. This some examples of double iodide salts combination have enhanced the efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells [18]. However, the double iodide salts system shows low conductivity because iodide salt with a big cation impairs transportation, rendering it sluggish. Even though the ionic conductivity shown by the GPEs containing the double iodide salts is low, but the performance of DSSCs is high. Some researchers have developed the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based gel electrolyte for the DSSCs fabrication [12,19,20]. Even though the DSSCs performance has shown high efficiency, these GPEs are mainly containing polymer blends. However, we want more focus on the limited materials in the electrolyte to reduce the cost of production. In this research, by referring to the idea of a combination of small cation and large cation in the gel polymer electrolyte, the PVA-based GPEs has been utilized containing tetramethyl ammonium iodide (TPAI)–potassium iodide (KI). The TPAI salt consists of TPA+ ion (large size of cation) and I– ion. In contrast, KI salt consists of K+ ion (small size of cation) and I– ion. GPEs in addition to x-ray diffraction and electrical impedance spectroscopy have been identified. A double-layer photoanode has been produced for better electron penetration and improve DSSC efficiency; the first layer is usually made up of smaller-sized TiO2 particles, and the second layer is typically composed of larger-sized TiO2 particles. Double-layer TiO2, with different particle sizes, influences DSSC efficiency due to the improved light harvesting in the photo-anode electrode [21]."
1,Experimental method,
2,Chemicals usage,"2.1 Chemicals usage Various chemicals, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), potassium iodide (KI), and tetrapropyl ammonium iodide (TPAI), were collected from Sigma Aldrich. Aeroxide Company supplied titanium dioxide (TiO2) powders (P90 and P25). Friendemann Schmidt Chemicals supplied dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Solaronix Company supplied the ruthenium N3 dye and platinum (Pt) liquid."
3,Gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) preparation,"2.2 Gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) preparation The gel polymer electrolytes were prepared with a fixed amount of PVA, EC, PC, and DMSO. The amounts of TPAI and KI salts used in the gel polymer electrolyte preparation were varied as referred from Table 1. The polyvinyl alcohol powder was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Simultaneously, the tetrapropyl ammonium iodide and potassium iodide were dissolved in the mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate in another glass container. The polymer solution and TPAI-KI solution were then combined at a constant temperature of 65 °C with continuous stirred. The heating was immediately stopped as soon as the mixture took on into a gel-like form and consistency. The yellowish iodine has been added when the temperature of GPEs reached ~25 °C. The GPE samples (refer Fig. 1) were stored in a sealed desiccator with low moisture and a dark environment for further characterization and dye-sensitized solar cells application. The designation for GPEs containing 100:0, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70, 0:100 (in wt% of TPAI-KI salts) are GP1, GP2, GP3, GP4 and GP5, respectively."
4,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"2.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) X-ray diffraction measurement was set up with an X-ray beam at a wavelength of 1.5406 Å. The diffraction angle, 2θ were setting from 5° to 55°. XRD is a suitable tool to analyze and determine the properties of the GPE, whether there were crystalline or amorphous. The BTX-II Olympus Benchtop model was employed in this research."
5,Impedance and conductivity measurement,"2.4 Impedance and conductivity measurement The impedance of each prepared GPEs was measured by EIS instrument (HIOKI LCR Hi-Tester model). The EIS measurement was carried out by placing GPEs between stainless-steel electrode couples, sandwiched with fixed thickness gels. The impedance of the GPEs has been measured at a variety of temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 100 °C (f range = 1 Hz–100 kHz). Conductivity of prepared GPEs was determined using this formula [7]: (1) σ = t R b A From this equation, t is the thickness of GPEs, R b is the bulk resistance from the intercept between the Nyquist plot and the x-axis. A is the contact area between gel polymer electrolytes and stainless-steel electrode couples."
6,Working electrode (TiO2 -N3 dye) preparation,"2.5 Working electrode (TiO2 -N3 dye) preparation The titanium dioxide (TiO2) was deposited on top of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. Two TiO2 layers were coated on the FTO glass. The first and second layers are the compact and porous layers, respectively. The first layer was prepared by mixing P90 TiO2 (0.5 g) with 2 ml of HNO3 (pH = 1) and grounding for a half-hour in a clean agate mortar until a homogenous slurry was obtained. A drop of the slurry was spin-coated on the FTO glass at 1000 rpm for 5 s and 2300 rpm for 1 min. TiO2 (P90) coated FTO glass was then heated in the furnace for 35 min at 450 °C. The second layer was made by grounding 0.5 g of P25 TiO2 and mixed with 0.1 g of carbowax and 2 ml of HNO3 (pH = 1) in an agate mortar for approximately 30 min. A few surfactants drops (Triton X-100) were added during the grinding process until homogenous slurry was formed. The slurry was then layered on the TiO2 compact layer using the ‘Doctor Blade’ technique. FTO glass with compact and porous layers was sintered at 450 °C in a closed furnace for 35 min. The FTO glass coated with double-layer TiO2 was soaked in N3 Ruthenium (0.3 mM) dye liquid for one day. The soaking process for the working electrode was carried out in a sealed desiccator with low moisture. In the last step of working electrode process, this electrode was cleaned with ethanol to remove unbound TiO2 and dye particles."
7,DSSC assembly and measurement,"2.6 DSSC assembly and measurement Dye-sensitized solar cells were assembly by the squeezing technique in which the gel polymer electrolyte was located between the platinum electrode (as a counter side) and the TiO2-dye electrode (as a working side). The platinum electrode was prepared by layering the silvery platinum liquid on FTO glass. Another electrode was made up of double layers of TiO2 on the active side of fluorine tin oxide glass. Later, this electrode was dripping in Ruthenium dye. Dye-sensitized solar cells were put to the test under white light (Xenon lamp) with an intensity power of 1000 W m−2. The J-V curves were obtained using a source meter (Keithley 2400 model). The fill factor (FF) was obtained from this formula [14]: (2) F F = V max × J max V o c × J s c where short-circuit current density is labeled as J sc (mA cm−2) and open-circuit voltage is labeled as V oc (V). At the maximum point of power output from J-V graph, J max (mA cm−2) is maximum current density and V max (V) is maximum voltage. The calculation of efficiency has determined from this formula [14]: (3) η ( % ) = V o c J s c F F P i n × 100 % Here V oc is the open-circuit voltage, J sc is short-circuit current density, FF is fill factor and P in is the incident light power."
8,Results and discussion,
9,XRD analysis,"3.1 XRD analysis GPEs with TPAI and KI variations revealed the plot of XRD diffraction curves, as represented in Fig. 2. From the Fig. 2, x-ray diffraction curves showed a wide peak at 2θ = 20° [22]. This are recognized to the quasi-crystalline region of the pure PVA. The strong inter-intra molecular hydrogen bonding between the PVA chains which is produce the crystalline structure [23]. The broad peak indicated that the GPEs containing double salts have amorphous properties. In Fig. 2, the improving of the amorphous region is revealed that the increasing of width peak and reducing of the peak intensity (2θ = 15°–25°) [24,25]. The increasing amount of KI in the system, improve the amorphous structure of the GPEs which is implying that the conductivity of GPEs has improved [26]. This phenomenon also due to the presence of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate in GPEs, even though they simultaneously act as a solvent and a plasticizer. All XRD curves were deconvoluted in this XRD analysis using non-linear least squares software to determine the full-width half maximum (FWHM). Table 2 exhibits the FWHM and 2θ values for each GPE. Table 2 shows that the FWHM for the GP1 sample is 0.19, and for the GP2 and GP3 samples, it is 0.20 and 0.21, respectively. Following the GP3 sample, both GP4 and GP5 samples consistent increase their FWHM to 0.22. The FWHM values for all GPEs and the wide peak of XRD curves described that the gel polymer electrolytes are in the amorphous behavior [14]. The conductivity of the GPEs can be improved by adding potassium iodide. The amorphous behavior of GPEs is favorable for ion mobility and enhanced ionic conductivity [26]. The conductivity study section further discusses the relation between GPE amorphousness and conductivity."
10,Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis,"3.2 Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis Fig. 3 displays the Nyquist plot for GPE samples prepared, which it was obtained from impedance measurements at a constant temperature of 25 °C. The Nyquist plot shows a noteworthy, tilted spike, indicating the electrolytes’ high conductivity behavior [7]. The intercept of the tilted spike with x-axis results in the bulk resistance value, it is substituted in Eq. (1) to determine the electrolyte conductivity. Table 3 displays the conductivity at 25 °C for all GPEs with different amount of TPAI-KI. Table 3 shows that an improvement in conductivity from 6.24 × 10−3 S cm−1 to 12.48 × 10−3 S cm−1, confirmed by GPEs consisting of 100 wt% of TPAI (GP1) and 100 wt% of KI (GP5), respectively. The increased conductivity was attributed to an increasing amount of KI salt and decrease of TPAI salt amount in the GPE sample. It was proven that KI salt has more conductivity compared to quaternary ammonium iodide salt. This due that KI salt contains a small cation, K+ ion; in contrast TPAI salt contains a large cation, TPA+ ion [27]. The small cation has a high mobility compared to the large cation with sluggish movement in the GPEs [28]. The GP4 sample, compared to GP2 and GP3 samples, has the highest conductivity of 9.72 × 10−3 S cm−1 in GPEs containing TPAI-KI salts combination. This means that the combination of TPAI-KI salts of GP4 sample contribute the highest conductivity in the GPE system. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between conductivity and various temperature. The conductivity of GPEs increased with the elevated temperature. Fig. 4 shows the Arrhenius relationship in the graph of conductivity versus various temperature. Regression value, R 2 was observed from this graph is approximately 1. The activation energy, E a can be obtained from the Arrhenius relation [14]: (4) σ = σ o e ( − E a k b T ) where the conductivity is labeled as σ, activation energy is labeled as E a , Boltzmann constant is labeled as k b and temperature is labeled as T. The activation energy, E a which defines as the lowest energy required for initiate ionic conduction in the electrolyte. From Table 3, the activation energy, E a was obtained from 0.13 eV to 0.17 eV. GP1 (lowest conductivity) has the highest activation energy, E a of 0.17 eV. The GPE with the highest conductivity (GP5) shows activation energy, E a of 0.13 eV. This implies that the minimum amount of energy is required in the GPE with the highest conductivity [12]. The lowest E a also indicates that free ion mobility requires less energy to travel from one coordination site to another in the segmental polymer because the length between two coordination sites for ion transfer is very closed."
11,Characteristics of the DSSCs,"3.3 Characteristics of the DSSCs Fig. 5 presents the current density versus voltage (J-V) curves for all GPEs. The studied DSSC parameters included short-circuit current density (J sc ) and open-circuit voltage (V oc ). Other important DSSC parameters investigated are fill factor (FF) and efficiency (η). Table 4 shows dye-sensitized solar cell parameters assembly with prepared GPEs. Short-circuit current density, J sc was in the range of 11 to ~14 mA cm−2. The J sc demonstrated an increment in DSSC with GP1 electrolyte from 11.20 mA cm−2 to 14.10 mA cm−2 with GP2 electrolyte. This indicated that potassium iodide’s existence improved charge carrier conductivity in gel polymer electrolyte and improved the J sc [27]. The charge mobility from the dye-excited state to the metal oxide conduction band and from the platinum electrode to the ionized dye was known to induce the J sc of DSSC [28]. As the V oc is average of 0.60 V, the electron injection mobility from dye excited state to TiO2 conduction band is unaffected in all dye-sensitized solar cells device. The persistence V oc specifies that charge carrier density in the electrolyte that maintained both energy levels is the same because the TiO2 conduction band and Fermi level did not change. Thus, the electron injection mobility is maintaining from dye excited state to TiO2 conduction band. Following the GP2 sample, the J sc gradually decreased to ~18% in the GP3, GP4 and GP5 samples. According to Table 4, the fill factor (FF) was obtained in average of 0.61. It verified that all GPEs between the two electrodes made excellent contact and electron transfer occurred without much loss [29]. GP2 sample has the highest DSSCs efficiency, showed a value of 5.51%. However, DSSCs fabricated with GP1 had a low efficiency of 4.10% due to the absence of potassium iodide. Even though GP5 has the highest conductivity value, the DSSC efficiency is lower than DSSC using GP2 sample in the conductivity study. This means that the composition of 70 wt% of TPAI:30 wt% of KI in the GP2 is the best, providing high DSSC efficiency. This phenomenon indicates that the mixed of tetrapropyl ammonium iodide (large cation) and potassium iodide (small cation) enhanced the DSSC performance [30,31]. In addition, the increasing or decreasing of DSSCs efficiency depends on the variation in short-circuit current density, J sc, rather than the total ionic conductivity of the GPE. Hence, the best combination of small-large cation is more critical in achieving the high-performance of DSSCs [30]."
12,Conclusion,"GPEs were produced by dissolving the PVA-EC-PC-DMSO with various TPAI and KI salts. XRD discovered that the gel polymer electrolytes were in an amorphous region. In EIS characterization, GPEs samples showed that the GP4 with 30 wt% of tetrapropyl ammonium iodide and 70 wt% of potassium iodides had the highest conductivity of 9.72 × 10 −3 S cm−1 and activation energy, E a of 0.14 eV. The DSSC employing GP2 had the highest efficiency of 5.51%, improved by 25% compared to the GP1 sample. The highest efficiency was shown by the high short-current density, J sc in GP2 electrolyte, which electrons transfer to the ionized dye from the platinum electrode. Hence, potassium iodide in the gel polymer electrolytes increased the conductivity and dye-sensitized solar cell performance."
