0,Introduction,"Biomass was the first fuel used by human beings and the main one until the middle of the eighteenth century before the first Industrial Revolution. Today it still responds to the main energy needs of rural areas in developing countries [1]. A promising way to used biomass is through high intensity energy vectors like biogas or biofuel (bio-oil). According to the World Energy Council, bioenergy is the main source of renewable energy with 14% out of 18% global renewable in the energy mix [2,3] with a supplied energy in 2016 around 62.5 exajoules (EJ) [4]. Biomass for habitation's heating will be competitive with fossil fuels in the European Union, by 2020 [5] but the low price of traditional oil (especially outside the European Union) has had a detrimental effect on the competitiveness of biofuels for transport, which is a big challenge because its contribution is up to 14% of total world greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [6]. The peak oil, reached in 2005 for conventional oil extraction and in 2050 for all extraction techniques [7], suggests that in the short term there will be a significant change in the difficulty of access to oil fields. This increasing difficulty of extraction and the necessary energy needed will lead to higher prices and may change the competitive relationship [8]. Biomass has the interesting characteristics of having a short regeneration cycle (from hours to hundreds of years). All other resources like carbonaceous materials (hydrocarbons, coals) or minerals (metals, aggregates, cement) are also extracted from nature but are produced through complex processes, deep into earth and through very long (from millions to billions of years) and complex cycles. This short renewal (i.e. renewable) cycle should give biomass a major role in the energy mix. The development of electric vehicles is the current trend to fight against global warming. This solution can be suitable for short distance issues as town mobility, for public transport, or cars shared vehicles. Batteries and vehicle-to-grid can also be options for storage of renewable electricity [9–11]). Nevertheless long distance mobility issues are different. The collateral effects of a complete conversation of a national fleet into electric vehicles must not be neglected. Especially matters linked to the scale effect concerning the consumption of materials related to the electricity production and storage which both require high quantities of mineral resources [12–14]. In these circumstances, and because they are storable, biofuels should be a co-alternative with the electric vehicle to traditional oil in order to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. The development of bio-energies could lead societies towards a transformation, from an economy based on the extraction and refining of fossil resources towards an economy based on an ecosystem rooted in regeneration (of resources, waste and energy). The emergence of bioenergy has been hampered by the environmental, and health problems caused by first-generation biofuels. Competition between land use for food production and liquid biofuels is a major technical and technological challenge for our societies in energy transition and with continuing population growth. The first generation of biofuels was supposed to be blended in existing engines with traditional fuels and could be distributed through existing infrastructure. Agricultural production was from plants containing oil (rapeseed, sunflowers, soya, palm). The second generation uses non-food sources of biomass from agricultural residues, forest waste and non-edible plants. The third generation is made from seaweed and micro-algae which have high production efficiency and can be cultivated out of soils. Second and third-generation uses have, partly initiated paradigm shifts with regeneration of waste (2nd generation) and initiating a new form of exploitation (3rd generation). The development of bioenergy must remain under a certain vigilance. A particular vigilance is needed on the origin of biomass, especially if they come from dedicated crops. Even if micro-algae and seaweeds bring relevant opportunities, the collateral effects of overproduction would be harmful. For this reason, the use of waste (sewage sludge, household and industrial waste) seems to be one of the most promising options. For the same reason, the choice of biomass and processes requires reliable and universal indicators. The economic development of biofuels (including biogas) would require an increase in the efficiency of its production. Biomass characteristics as well as processes are various. Industrial scale up would be encouraged by indicators that enable evaluation of the potential of optimization for the processes or help to define biomass morphologies to be favoured for a desired product. In the context of the Industrial Revolution and the development of steam-engine technology, Carnot [15] has developed its well-known approach of combustion engines and its temperature dependencies. By setting an upper limit to the engine cycle, attention and investments were focused on the thermal optimization of engines and the subsequent industrial development. If the same attention is paid to the theoretical analysis of biomass conversion, upper limits might be identified, allowing then to orient the choice to adequate processes and technologies for a larger scale development of bioenergy. The exploration of theoretical conversions of biomass into biofuels that has been conducted here will contribute to the understanding of conversion efficiency. Biomass conversion is here approached from the first principle of chemical thermodynamics, considering biomass as resources to produce simple energetic vectors (alkanes, alcohols, carbon monoxide and hydrogen). All the energy will be supplied via the contribution of biomass without external input (neither energy nor materials except water and oxygen) for the conversion process. The impact of conversion configurations to material and energy indicators on theoretical conversion will be explored to bring some theoretical information about biomass conversion. The impact of two different biomass, a woody (beech sawdust) and a micro-algae one (spirulina) will be explored as well as the atomic dependence sources and conversion ratio evolution parameters."
1,Biomass conversion processes,"Conversion of biomass is usually carried out in order to increase its energy density and obtain energy vectors easier to handle. First generations of biofuels were made either by transesterification to produce biodiesel and fatty acid methyl esters or by the fermentation to produce ethanol [17]. Second and third generation of biofuels are mainly linked to two families of processes, thermo-chemical and biochemical. Biochemical process includes fermentation and anaerobic digestion which produce biogas (mainly methane, carbon dioxide and traces of other gases). Thermochemical processes consider classical ways as incineration or combustion or more sophisticated oxidation as HydroThermal oxidation (SHTO) and Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) . They mainly produce heat, water and unused gases like CO 2 and other gases (nitrogen oxides, acetaldehyde, carbon monoxide, etc.) depending on reactant and combustion quality. These processes can be used to produce steam for industry or electricity via turbines and co-generation technologies. However these processes are non-material valuation routes. The pyrolysis and gasification (or supercritical water gasification - SCWG) produce a mix of different gases (mainly CO + H2) also called syngas. The thermo-chemical liquefaction also named hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) followed by hydrothermal upgrading (HTU) converts biomass under sub-critical water conditions into valuable products, mainly oil and some gas [18,19]. From mixed gases long carbon chain biofuels can be obtained (diesel, ethanol, etc.) by the Fischer-Tropsch process. The pyrolysis process has the disadvantage of requiring complete drying of biomass. The Fig. 1 summarizes these processes, their products and their final uses. Except the chemical industry which can directly use products, biofuels are the major vector to value biomass. Biofuels are also the main material valuation routes giving them a preferential place as part of a paradigm shift to a regeneration economy. Another way to organize the different biomass recovery processes was proposed by Ferrasse [20] as presented in Fig. 2 . This classification can be established according to the oxygen stoichiometry ratio ( ξ 0 2 ) calculated with respect to the total oxidation of the product. The processes that have ξ 0 2 superior to one produce the oxidation of the biomass yielding oxidized forms of incoming carbon into CO 2 and hydrogen into H 2 O and provide direct heat energy. Low stoichiometry processes ( ξ 0 2 < 1 ) convert incoming material into an energetic valuable vector, solid, liquid or gaseous, according to operating conditions. T c and P c indicate the coordinates of the critical point of water. Experimental and theoretical studies about biomass conversion processes are abundant. From these publications similar energetic and material indictors are used like biomass to fuel efficiency, material balance or energy yields as indicators of efficiency of processes. However, process specifications, operating conditions, biomass characteristics or the boundaries of the systems studied make it difficult or impossible to assess the process, the quality of the conversion and the relationship between the processes. Table 1 summarizes data extracted from different studies of biomass conversion. Data are given as provided by the authors, from their data or have been calculated from them (mentioned by a *). Data from Huang and Zhang [27] are biomass-to-fuel efficiency calculated by authors from different studies (from Refs. [28–38]). Original data of those studies were cited by Huang and Zhang [27] and have been placed in Table 1 below the reference [27]. Sheehan et al. [28] and Hamelinck et al. [29] both study the fermentation of corn stover and use similar indicators (mass ratio). The difference observed in these two studies is significant, η m a t e r i a l = 29.8 % in 28 and η m a t e r i a l = 34.2 % in Ref. [29], so it is necessary but difficult to evaluate where this difference in result comes from based on the difference in processes as they are described (essentially the use of enzymatic hydrolysis steps in Ref. [28]). Similarly Tijmensen et al. [22] and Prins et al. [24] analysed the gasification process of biomass to produce biogas (syngas). The differences between the two energy yields are huge ( η e n e r g y = 80 % for [22] and η e n e r g y = 47.92 % for [24]), and even if processes are different (dolomite tar crackers in Ref. [22] as theoretical model is discussed in Prins et al. [24]) it's hard to evaluate which one is the most relevant or efficient and why. These observations point to limitations of indicators used in process quality assessment or comparison. In particular, they do not make it possible to report on the integration or an addition of matter not explicitly accounted for. These previous observations highlight the possible contributions of objective indicators (boundaries, processes and technical circumstances) from theoretical analysis to proceed to process comparison, evaluation or identification of potential improvements in biomass conversion. In order to study biomass conversion, an ideal and theoretical modelling has been developed. The next section describes the theoretical assumptions that were made, the thermodynamic models that were used and the definition of the indicators that will support the following analysis. The following indicators should yield upper limits for conversions from biomass to energy vectors, considering only biomass and conversion products as income."
2,Material and method,"Two kinds of biomass are used in the conversion analysis. The first one is a dry beech sawdust whose characteristics have been extracted from the database for biomass and waste of the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands [41]. An average of different kinds of beech data is used: a milled beech ( C H 1.498 O 0.666 ), a classic beech from Rettenmayer ( C H 1.602 O 0.771 ) and a beech for torrefaction ( C H 1.256 O 0.663 ) where nitrogen and sulphate were neglected. The second biomass used is a micro-algae named spirulina ( C H 1.86 O 0.59 N 0.13 ), taken from the same database, characteristics originally came from a work of Hirano et al. [21]. Table 2 lists the values used for the study on a carbon basis number of 33, sulphur is neglected. These two biomass illustrates the diversity of morphologies and the impact of this choice. Beech refers to second generation while spirulina refers to third-generation biofuels. Both biomass has specific characteristics in their composition (cellulosic or lipidic) as well as in their production methods."
3,System considered,"3.1 System considered The considered system includes the conversion reaction as well as secondary reactions as the combustion reaction that provides energy to the system. For this supply, the combustion of the biomass or the product(s) of the conversion (alkanes, alcohol, H 2, CO) are considered. These conversions are made from reagents in their standard states to products in their standard states. To make results comparable a reaction of one kilogram of biomass as the input of the system is considered. If biomass is burned then the quantity converted and the quantity burned from the input kilogram (equation (1)). For some of the considered conversion, a hydrogen supply is required. In order to account for the energy needed to provide this hydrogen the process of water dissociation is considered. The energy cost of hydrogen production involved a production efficiency about 30% ( η D i s s L H V = 0.3 ). Consequently 3.33 times more energy is needed than the actual standard enthalpy of reaction in order to provide the equivalent of one mole of hydrogen. The mole of hydrogen costs is 952.76 kJ/mol. Therefore the use of one mole of hydrogen corresponds to use of 55.6 g of beech and 46.8 g of spirulina. This assumption will be discussed in section 4.4.3."
4,Conversion products,"3.2 Conversion products This study aims to set up methodologies and provide initial results for main products encountered in the literature. For each product considered different simple reaction configurations are considered. No products mixes were considered in this study. The first conversion studied is the production of alkanes ( C n H 2 n + 2 ) with dodecane (C 12 H 26) as the longest carbon chain produced, corresponding to conventional products found in liquid hydrocarbons. The conversion of biomass into alcohols ( C n H 2 n + 2 O ) as the second family analysed, with the longest carbon chains here again is dodecanol (C 12 H 26 O). Those products are representative of various compounds and mixture of compounds. Finally, conversions of biomass into hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) are considered. Biomass and products considered in this paper have been inserted in the Van Krevelen diagram in Fig. 3 . This classical representation is used to organize elements depending on the two atomic ratio H C and O C . The impact of the conversion can be visualised as the heating value upgrade by increasing the H C ratio and minimizing the O C ratio."
5,Indicators of performance,"3.3 Indicators of performance As seen previously the measure of the biomass conversion process performances are hardly comparable between studies. Those observations demand universal and simple indicators, references to evaluate systems performances. In this work indicators used to evaluate conversions are the material and energy ratio. The inputs considered calculating those indicators are the biomass and the energies come from biomass or conversion products. Far from providing a complete understanding of biomass conversions, these indicators, applied to ideal theoretical conversions, provide a simple comparison tool by identifying upper theoretical conversion limits for the production of simple elements (H 2 and CO) and product family (alcohols and alkanes). These upper bounds offer an assessment of experimental and industrial processes in the light of objective theoretical metrics. The evaluation will then be more relevant and consistent, providing a comparative process approach. 3.3.1 Material ratio indicator The material ratio is the relation between the quantity of the product obtained and the inlet biomass quantity. It will be calculated by two different ways depending on whether the input biomass or the product is used to supply energy. If only biomass is involved, equation (1) is used to calculate the material ratio. The input biomass quantity considered includes the sum of the mass of biomass of the conversion ( n b i o m a s s c o n v e r s i o n . M b i o m a s s ) and the mass for combustion ( n b i o m a s s b u r n e d . M b i o m a s s ). The quantity of products obtained is represented by n p r o d u c t o b t a i n e d . M p r o d u c t . (1) η m a t e r i a l = n p r o d u c t o b t a i n e d . M p r o d u c t ( n b i o m a s s c o n v e r s i o n + n b i o m a s s b u r n e d ) . M b i o m a s s If the energy supply comes from the combustion of products, equation (2) is used. The product used ( n p r o d u c t b u r n e d ) is deduced from the product obtained ( n p r o d u c t o b t a i n e d ) from the kilogram of biomass converted. (2) η m a t e r i a l = ( n p r o d u c t o b t a i n e d − n p r o d u c t b u r n e d ) . M p r o d u c t n b i o m a s s c o n v e r s i o n . M b i o m a s s Whatever the case, the ratio always have the unit of k g p r o d u c t / k g b i o m a s s . The kilogram of biomass refers to the biomass involved, either in equation (1) or (2). In the previous equations n i and M i respectively refer to the mole number and molar mass of component “i”. 3.3.2 Energy ratio indicator The energy ratio considers the lower heating value (LHV) as a measure of the energy value embodied by the biomass or the product. Similarly to the material ratio, if the biomass is used to supply the energy to the system, equation (3) is used. (3) η e n e r g y = n p r o d u c t o b t a i n e d . L H V p r o d u c t ( n b i o m a s s c o n v e r s i o n + n b i o m a s s b u r n e d ) . L H V b i o m a s s Equation (4) is then used when the product of the conversion supply the energy to the system. (4) η e n e r g y = ( n p r o d u c t o b t a i n e d − n p r o d u c t b u r n e d ) . L H V p r o d u c t n b i o m a s s c o n v e r s i o n . L H V b i o m a s s"
6,Thermo-chemical parameters,"3.4 Thermo-chemical parameters The energy analysis is done following the first law of thermodynamics. The calculations consider products and reagents in their standard states (T = 298 K and P = 1.01325 105 Pa). The amount of heat to be supplied to the system for the reaction(s) is given by the standard enthalpy of reaction ( Δ r H 298 ∘ ) calculated from equation (5). (5) Δ r H 298 ∘ = ∑ i υ i Δ f H 298 i ∘ Where υ i are the stoichiometric coefficients to balance the conversions reactions ( υ i > 0 for a product υ i < 0 for reagent) and Δ f H 298 i ∘ the standard enthalpy of formation of each element involved in the considered reaction. The calculation of the standard enthalpy of reaction gives the amount of energy that it is necessary to supply to the system to carry out the conversion. 3.4.1 Lower heating value The LHV is calculated according to the Boie equation (equation (6)) taken from Proll and Hofbauer [42]. (6) L H V B o i e = 348.35 C + 938.70 H − 108.00 O + 62.80 N + 104.65 S Each capital letter is the mass percent (wt%) of corresponding atoms in the element ant the LHV is expressed in kJ/kg. For the beech sawdust, with its expression C 33 H 48 O 24 , its LHV is: L H V b e e c h = 17 136.61 kJ ╱ kg = 4.76 kWh ╱ kg = 14 201.45 kJ ╱ mol . For the spirulina, with its expression C 33 H 61 O 19 N 4 , its LHV is: L H V s p i r u l i n a = 20 354.84 kJ ╱ kg = 5.65 kWh ╱ kg = 16 647.27 kJ ╱ mol . The same method is used for the alkanes and alcohol, but a modified version of the Boie equation (equation (7)) is used, more appropriated to liquid and gaseous fuel [43]. (7) L H V m o d i f i e d = 349.1 C + 958.3 H − 103.4 O − 15.1 N − 100.5 S The choice of correlation remains open to discussion, but the observation of general trends that will be observed here is not significantly impacted. For the other elements (H 2,CO,C) LHV was extracted from SimuLis® thermodynamic servers 44. The Table 1 in the appendix compares the LHV calculated and the one given in the database. Values for alkanes and alcohols could have been taken from SimuLis® rather than calculated. In order to maintain consistency in the calculation and because the aim is more the observation of trends, they have been calculated as is the case for biomass. 3.4.2 Standard enthalpy of formation For the biomass, calculation of the standard enthalpy of formation ( Δ f H 298 0 ) is needed from the raw expression ( C ξ C H ξ H O ξ O N ξ N ). To calculate the standard enthalpy the oxidation reaction equation (8) is used. (8) C ξ C H ξ H O ξ O N ξ N S ξ S + 1 2 ( 2 ξ C + ξ H 2 − ξ O + 2 ξ N + 2 ξ S ) O 2 → ξ C C O 2 + ξ H 2 H 2 0 + ξ N N O 2 + ξ S S O 2 The standard enthalpy of formation is then given by the following equation: (9) Δ f H C H O N S ∘ = L H V C H O N S + ξ C Δ f H C O 2 ∘ + ξ H 2 Δ f H H 2 0 ∘ + ξ N Δ f H N O 2 ∘ + ξ S Δ f H S O 2 ∘ − 1 2 ( 2 ξ C + ξ H 2 − ξ O + 2 ξ N + 2 ξ S ) Δ f H O 2 ∘ Where Δ f H ∘ ( i ) are the standard enthalpy of formation of the substances “i” in their standard states: P = 101.325 kPa and T = 25 °C or 298.15 K. LHV CHONS is the LHV previously calculated and expressed in kJ/mol, and the water is considered at the liquid state. The standard enthalpies of formations are in kJ/mol. For alkanes ( C n H 2 n + 2 ) and alcohols ( C n H 2 n + 2 O ) standard enthalpy of formation for the main compounds (methane, ethane, propanol, dodecanol, etc.) can be found in tabulation in standard reference database as SimuLis® [44]. The Table A.2 in the appendix provide standard enthalpy of formation."
7,Conversion parameters,"3.5 Conversion parameters Two rules were defined to analyse the biomass conversion. One called Carbon rule and a second one called Hydrogen rule. The difference is related to the limiting reagent element. The biomass is obviously the limiting reagent, but according to its composition ( C ξ C H ξ H O ξ O N ξ N ), different assumptions can be made. 3.5.1 Carbon rules In the carbon rule, the atomic amount of carbon in biomass ( ξ C ) is the limiting reagent. The carbon conversion ratio (equation (10)) is the amount of carbon present in the biomass converted into the valuable product of the reaction, i.e. alkanes, alcohols or carbon monoxide. This rate is considered total when all the carbon in the biomass is converted into the product. It evolves from 0 to 100% in proportion to the production of carbon dioxide during the reaction. (10) C % = n p r o d u c t ξ C p r o d u c t n b i o m a s s ξ C b i o m a s s In equation (10) n biomass , n product respectively refer to the stoichiometric number of moles of biomass and product when the reaction equation is equilibrated. A parameter (β) is used to adjust the production of the CO 2 and so the carbon conversion ratio ( C % ). Equations (11)–(13) are the general reactions considered. (11) Case 1 : n b i o m a s s . C ξ C H ξ H O ξ O N ξ N + H 2 ⇒ n p r o d u c t . P r o d u c t + n H 2 O . H 2 O + β . C O 2 + n N 2 . N 2 (12) Case 2 : n b i o m a s s . C ξ C H ξ H O ξ O N ξ N + O 2 ⇒ n p r o d u c t . P r o d u c t + n H 2 O . H 2 O + β . C O 2 + n N 2 . N 2 (13) Case 3 : n b i o m a s s . C ξ C H ξ H O ξ O N ξ N + O 2 + H 2 ⇒ n p r o d u c t . P r o d u c t + n H 2 O . H 2 O + β . C O 2 + n N 2 . N 2 During the evolution of C % , the oxygen from the biomass ( ξ O ) used to form carbon dioxide CO 2, and water is not sufficient, so O 2 has to be supplied. In the same way, the hydrogen in the biomass ( ξ H ) is not sufficient into some stoichiometry configurations to produce the desired products and also needs to be supplied. The reactions of biomass conversion are exothermic. The hydrogen production is the major energy consuming part of those configurations. The equations (14)–(16) are used for biomass conversion into alkanes for a general biomass C x H y O z N w . The curves on Fig. 4 concerning beech's and the spirulina's conversion and have been obtained from those reactions. Each variable ( C % , n product , n biomass , n C O 2 , n H 2 O , η m a t e r i a l , η e n e r g y , ξ O 2 ) are then calculated. (14) Case 1 : C x H y O z N w + [ n + 1 n ( x − β ) + ( z − 2 β ) − y 2 ] . H 2 ⇒ x − β n . C n H 2 n + 2 + ( z − 2 β ) . H 2 O + β . C O 2 + w 2 . N 2 (15) Case 2 : C x H y O z N w + [ y 4 + β − z 2 − n + 1 n ( x − β ) ] . O 2 ⇒ x − β n . C n H 2 n + 2 + [ y 2 − n + 1 n ( x − β ) ] . H 2 O + β . C O 2 + w 2 . N 2 (16) Case 3 : C x H y O z N w + [ n + 1 n ( x − β ) + α − y 2 ] . H 2 + [ β + α − z 2 ] . O 2 ⇒ x − β n . C n H 2 n + 2 + α . H 2 O + β . C O 2 + w 2 . N 2 On the plotted curves corresponding to the carbon rule, the previous cases will figure by a magenta circle ( Image 1 ) for case 1 (only hydrogen is provided), a green square ( Image 2 ) for case 2 (only oxygen is provided) and a red cross ( Image 3 ) for case 3 (oxygen and hydrogen are provided). The formation of carbon monoxide from biomass was observed in the same condition of carbon conversion ratio evolution (equation (17)). The carbon conversion is dependent on the formation of the carbon dioxide. Oxygen has to be supplied and the reaction is exothermic and thus does not need any heat supply. This reaction is similar to a partial oxidation. (17) C x H y O z N w + 1 2 [ x γ + 1 ( 1 + 2 γ ) + y 2 − z ] . O 2 ⇒ x γ + 1 . C O + γ . x γ + 1 . C O 2 + y 2 . H 2 O + w 2 . N 2 3.5.2 Hydrogen rules In the hydrogen rule, the atomic amount of hydrogen in biomass ( ξ H ) is the limiting reagent. The hydrogen conversion ratio (equation (18)) is the amount of hydrogen present in the biomass converted into the valuable product, i.e. alkanes, alcohols or hydrogen (H 2). (18) H % = n p r o d u c t . ξ H p r o d u c t n b i o m a s s . ξ H b i o m a s s This ratio is considered total when all the hydrogen in the biomass is present into the product. A parameter (α) is used to adjust the water production and hydrogen conversion ratio ( H % ). For the beech the hydrogen conversion ratio ( H % ) evolves from 0% to 99.6% (a small amount of water produced is always considered). For spirulina the hydrogen conversion ratio ( H % ) evolves from 37.7% to 99.6%. The minimum conversion ratio difference are due to the biomass compositions and the H/O ratio (beech: H/O = 2, spirulina: H/O > 2). Different theoretical reactions are considered according to assumptions about capture or supply of oxygen and carbon during conversions. The following equations equations (19)–(23) are the general reactions that illustrate the assumptions made, where the product is either alkanes or alcohol (19) Case 4 : n b i o m a s s .

N 2 The detailed equation below (equations (24)–(27)) are the ones used for biomass conversion into alkanes for a general biomass C x H y O z N w . The curves on Fig. A.1 in the appendix are related to beech and spirulina conversion have been obtained from those reactions. Similar equations have been used for alcohol (×4) and for each biomass. Variable ( C % , n product , n biomass , n C O 2 , n H 2 O , n O 2 ,n C , η m a t e r i a l , η e n e r g y ) are again calculated. (24) Case 4 : C x H y O z N w ⇒ y − 2 α 2 n + 2 .

C O 2 + [ z − α 2 − x + n ( y − 2 α ) 2 n + 2 ] . O 2 + w 2 . N 2 For those conversions the stoichiometry has again a major role. Case 5 corresponds to a composition of biomass ( ξ C , ξ H , ξ O ) that allows an exact distribution of the quantities of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen in the production of the product, water and carbon dioxide. This exceptional case was not observed with the parameters used in this study. The other cases (4,6,7 and 8) are partially realisable depending on the hydrogen conversion ratio, the alkane or alcohol considered as well as the input biomass choice. Case 8 occurs when cases 6 and 4 are not possible. The curves in Fig. A.1 in the appendix, group the energy ratio for the beech and spirulina conversion into alkanes for the cases 7 to 8. The discontinuities on the curves help to visualise the impact of stoichiometry on cases feasibility. The cases 4 and 6 depending on the hydrogen conversion ratio ( H % ) convert the excess carbon of the biomass into CO 2 and/or into carbon. When happening, the elemental carbon is not included in the energy ratio or the mass ratio. The process analysis focuses only on the desired product (alkane or alcohol). Although theoretically, it is possible to draw a parallel with existing technologies for some cases. Case 4 is similar to cracking while case 7 could be fermentation or methanation if the product is CH 4. The case 8 is very specific. The surplus of oxygen that can be integrated to the water, or carbon dioxide is captured in pure oxygen. This case feasibility is available in very few configurations (easier for the spirulina than beech), but this opportunity could be investigated further. The realisable case can be identified on Figs. A.1 and A.2 of the appendix. The hydrogen production from biomass (equation (28)) is also dependent on hydrogen conversion ( H % ). The reaction is exothermic and does not need any heat supply. (28) C x H y O z N w + 1 2 ( 2 x − z + α ) . O 2 ⇒ 1 2 ( y − 2 α ) . H 2 + α . H 2 O + x . C O 2 + w 2 . N 2 3.5.3 Range of control parameters The α parameter varies between 0.1 and a limit value that cancels some elements of the equations (equations (19)–(23)). Its calculation depends on the ratio H/O (for beech: H/O = 2 while for spirulina: H/O > 2). The limit value of α is either equal to “z” the amount of oxygen present in the biomass, or to “ y 2 ” the amount of hydrogen (more exactly dihydrogen). The smaller of these two values is the determining factor. In the case of beech ( C 33 H 48 O 24 ), these two values are equal ( z = y 2 = 24 ) which makes it a special case. In the case of spirulina ( C 33 H 61 O 19 N 4 ), y 2 = 30.5 is the lowest value. The hydrogen conversion rate, therefore, varies between 0% and 99.58% for beech and between 37.7% and 99.67% for spirulina. These rates do not reach 100%, as it is considered that a small amount of water is always produced. The parameter β changes in relation to the amount of carbon present in the biomass ξ C . It will thus vary between β = 0 and β = 33 . Beta is zero when the conversion to carbon is total and the amount of CO 2 produced is zero. When β = 33 , all biomass carbon forms CO 2. Observations on the stoichiometry influences: The impact of the two theoretical choices that have been made ( C % vs H % ) is non-negligible and according to this choice different quantities of products can be expected. If the beech conversion into ethane is observed, for example, according to the carbon rules and when all the carbon is converted ( C % = 100 % ), 598.68 g of ethane can be obtained (from 1 kg of beech). In the hydrogen rules case, when all the hydrogen is converted ( H % = 99.6 % , corresponding to a carbon conversion ratio of 48.3%) 289.06 g of ethane can be obtained. This point of view of the biomass conversion is not well mentioned explicitly in literature. Observing consequences of these two conversion rules ( C % vs H % ) highlights the key role of the reaction path in an efficient production strategy. This aspect of the biomass conversion will be discussed in section 5."
8,Results and discussion,"In all studied cases the combustion of the product provides much smaller energy production than the biomass combustion configuration. In some cases the production is not even sufficient to bring energy to the reaction. Consequently only cases where biomass is used as combustible will be discussed and presented. To analyse the conversion multiple parameters should be considered. The major parameters are the energy ratio such as defined in equation (3) and equation (4), the material ratio equation (1) and equation (2) and the quantity of CO 2 produced. Stoichiometric oxygen ratio ( ξ O 2 ) could also be taken in account to compare with respect to the processes discussed previously (see Fig. 2). The whole mass involved in the process provide information on the extent of the process. On the curves presented in the rest of the study, the horizontal planes correspond to the maximum value of the traced data."
9,Carbon rules,"4.1 Carbon rules 4.1.1 Alkane and alcohol production The curves in Fig. 4 represent the evolution of the energy ratio as a function of the carbon conversion ratio and the different alkanes produced from the conversion of beech and spirulina. Some conversion optimum is clearly identifiable on curves, where two opposite slopes lead to a peak where the energy ratios are maximal. As the conversion ratio increases ( C % > 0 ), the energy ratio increases linearly to the points where the curve is inflected. This point corresponds to the depletion of the quantity of hydrogen available in the biomass to the formation of the alkane. From these points, a supply of hydrogen is necessary which leads to an energy cost represented by the fall of the curves. The decrease of energy ratio will then continue until total conversion of biomass carbon into products where the hydrogen supply is highest. The material ratio follows the same tendencies (Fig. A.3 in appendices). The amount of oxygen for the reaction reduces with increasing carbon conversion ratio. This need is related to the production of water and carbon dioxide that are reduced with the increase of C % . The oxygen requirement is zero for the last third of the conversion ratio ( C % > 66.6 % ) where enough oxygen is present in the biomass. Table 3 summarize optimum values of the energy ratio for the alkanes production. These values correspond to the highest values of the Fig. 4 (peaks). The same behaviour can be observed for the conversion of biomass into alcohol (Fig. 5 ). Table 4 summarizes the optimal value of the energy ratio for alcohol production. The values correspond to the highest points of Fig. 5. Long carbon chains, above C 6 provide a more attractive configuration, with almost equal values. The general trend brings higher ratios for higher carbon conversion rates, although the total conversion is not optimal. For the complete data of the beech conversion see in the appendix the Tables A.3 and A.4 for data concerning spirulina conversion. Those tables summarize for alkanes and alcohol the optimum carbon conversion values with the corresponding energy and material ratios, the CO 2 productions quantities, the stoichiometry proportions of oxygen and the total masses involved. It should be noted that similar trends in the evolution of the optimal carbon conversion ratio for the material ratio and the energy ratio are due to similar evolution of the two indicators with the carbon conversion ratio (Tables A.3 and A.4) and not some authors' interventions. 4.1.2 CO production In the case of the formation of carbon monoxide from biomass a large amount of oxygen has to be supplied, from 40 wt% to 55 wt% of the input flow. The curves in Fig. 6 correspond to evolution of the material and energy ratios as a function of the carbon conversion ratio for the production of CO from beech and spirulina. The energy ratio and material ratio are the highest when the atmosphere is less oxidizing. It corresponds to minimum involved mass with 1.64 kg for the beech and 1.87 kg for the spirulina (the maximum involved mass is about 2.21 kg for the beech and 2.45 for the spirulina). The highest material ratio is observed where the addition of oxygen to the reaction is minimum. This high value (>100%) is due to addition of oxygen to the system which has a high molar mass. When the ratios decreases the oxygen quantity to supply increase. Table 5 summarizes the optimal data for the production of CO from the biomass."
10,Hydrogen rules,"4.2 Hydrogen rules 4.2.1 Alkane and alcohol production Regarding the evolution of the hydrogen conversion ratio, material ratio as well as energy ratio increases nearly linearly. This trend is similar for each case except for case 8 which is close to 100% for the few stoichiometrically possible cases. The curves on the Fig. 7 illustrate the previous observations for the energy ratio evolution as a function of the hydrogen conversion ratio ( H % ) and the different alkanes produced ( C n H 2 n + 2 ) from beech and spirulina for the case 6 previously detailed. The curves on the Figs. A.1 and A.2 in appendix shows similar tendencies respectively for alkanes and alcohol production and for each studied cases. Conversion optimum for alkanes and alcohols production occurs when hydrogen conversion is maximum (99.6%), excepted for cases where the stoichiometry constraint the hydrogen conversion ratio to lower values. Tables A.5 and A.6 in the appendix details those values and provides complete data set (CO 2 emissions, involved masses and ξ O 2 ). It can be observed that spirulina is more advantageous than the beech. Table 6 summarizes the highest energy ratio for each alkane. Table 7 summarizes the highest energy ratio for alcohol production. Some energy ratios are above 100% for case 8, whether it concerns the production of alcohols and alkanes. This small uncertainty in the results is due to the method used to calculate the LHV for biomass. These values are calculated from the Boie's law which is a correlation that approximates the value of the LHV obtained. The uncertainty obtained on the conversion ratios being ±1%, is then consistent with the correlation uncertainty [45]. 4.2.2 H 2 production Concerning production of hydrogen, the curves on Fig. 8 represent energy and material ratios according to the hydrogen conversion ratio evolution for beech and spirulina conversion into hydrogen. The optimum values are summarized in Table 8 . When the oxygen quantity increases the material and energy ratio decrease. The involved mass increases with added oxygen from 1.8 kg to 2.3 kg for the beech and from 1.9 kg to 2.5 kg for spirulina due to the production of water induced by the oxidation. The most efficient cases are for the maximum conversion ratio of hydrogen, where the oxygen supply is minimum and the total masses involved are the least (Fig. 8). The maximum energy ratio is 40.7% which is slightly superior to the energy hydrogen production efficiency of 30% previously considered (section 3.1). This consequence is discussed later (section 5)."
11,Reading the results,"4.3 Reading the results 4.3.1 Overview of preferential products From carbon conversion point of view. When the carbon conversion ratio is 100%, alcohol production is more efficient than alkanes for both beech and spirulina. The production of alkanes becomes more attractive from an energy ratio point of view when the carbon conversion ratio is reduced. When the energy ratio is optimal, alkanes are better or just as productive as alcohols. The differences between alkanes and alcohols are smaller for spirulina than for beech, particularly for carbon chains with carbon content above 5 (from C 5 H 12 to C 12 H 26 and C 5 H 12 O to C 12 H 26 O), where the energy ratio for beech is almost similar to spirulina conversion. From a material ratio point of view, when optimal, alcohols remain more efficient than alkanes for beech and spirulina. From hydrogen conversion point of view. As far as beech conversion is concerned, alkanes are more productive than alcohols for all the configurations and cases (equations (19)–(23)) in terms of the energy ratio. Concerning spirulina, both alkanes and alocools are equally productive, only one is more beneficial productive for the forth case (4) whereas alcohols will be more productive for cases six (6) and seven (7). Finally, in case eight (8), both alcohols as alkanes are as efficient for both biomass. From a material ratio point of view, alcohols offer higher values for both beech and spirulina. If all cases are analysed jointly, from the point of view of energy and material ratios, cases 7 (equation (22)) and case 8 (equation (23)) provides highest values for both alcohols and alkanes as well as for the two biomass considered. After the two previous cases comes case sixth (6) with the production of alkanes (equation (25)). Then come the hydrogen production from the point of view of the energy ratio with an optimum energy ratio of 40.87% for beech and 44.3% for spirulina. The seventh case (7) high value could be explained by the high oxidizing atmosphere. The eighth one deserves attention as it produces high ratios and “capture” oxygen. Even if only few configurations allow it, this reaction pathway might be investigated, by a partial oxygen capture, for example. In the sixth case, carbon is created instead of adding oxygen as in case seventh (7) to convert excess carbon from the biomass. The carbon created can be obtained in soot form, for example. As stated above, this quantity has not been taken into account as a valuable product in this study. Nevertheless, for one kilogram of biomass and when producing methanol, the amount of carbon coproduced can reach 137 g from beech and 144 g from spirulina. 4.3.2 Best biomass for each product The results of the modelling can be analysed from a reverse point of view to identify the best biomass choice according to a defined product: For alkanes production, broadly, the conversion will be more efficient from micro-algae (spirulina) than lignocellulosic biomass (beech) regarding each alkanes independently. The cases seven (7) and eight (8) of the hydrogen configuration bring higher efficiency (energy and material ratios). The case 8 is the most efficient with value equal to 100% but is more sensitive to the stoichiometry of the conversion. For alcohol production spirulina also allows higher energy and material ratios with similar productivity for the carbon conversion configuration for cases seven (7) and eight (8) of hydrogen configuration. The production of carbon monoxide is higher from woody biomass (beech) in terms of energy analysis, but according to the material yield, algae biomass allows higher conversion. The production of hydrogen will be most favourable from algae biomass, both in terms of energy or material analysis. Table 9 summarizes the previous observations. When ratio value is equal to 100%, smaller value has been added. 4.3.2.1 Outcome summary Finally, the modelling results can be summarized as follows. The modelling highlight optimum conversions from the defined biomass to the considered products. For the conversion of beech wood from an energy point of view, alkanes are more efficient than alcohols. The most productive configuration occurs for conditions of the carbon rule (equations (11)–(13)) when the conversion ratio into carbon is not total (Table A.3). Case seventh (7) (equation (22)) for the hydrogen rule, when hydrogen conversion is maximum, gives similar results for high carbon chains (n > 4) for the alkanes and alcohol production. Case eight (8) provides the best energy ratio (100%), but is considered separately because of the very few possible configurations and because of the specificity of the oxygen capture carried out. From a material point of view, carbon monoxide formation is most significant with a ratio of 111.54%, the production of alcohols under the hydrogen rule in Case 7 follows. For spirulina, the most efficient conversion from an energy point of view is also the one carried out under the conditions of the carbon rule (Table A.4) and then case four of the hydrogen rule, both for alkanes and alcohols. Case six (equation (21)) is nearly as efficient. For cases 6 and 7 propane provides an optimum conversion product. From a material point of view, CO production offers high value (113.02%) and alcohols offer equally competitive ratios for the same cases mentioned for beech conversion (the hydrogen rule in Case 7). The modelling results place spirulina as the biomass that allows to achieve better conversion rates. Spirulina is more efficient for the production of alkanes, alcohols or hydrogen. The beech is favourable to the formation of carbon monoxide. These observations reinforce the sustained attention given to the development of seaweed and microalgae studies in process engineering over the last decade (see Refs. [46–48])."
12,Critical points,"4.4 Critical points 4.4.1 CO 2 emission CO 2 production varies between 310 g and 1775 kg according to whether beech or spirulina is processed and depending on the products under consideration. The production of hydrogen from biomass is the product that releases the highest quantities of CO2 because all the carbon present in biomass is contained inside. In opposition the quantity of CO 2 produced in case 4 is very low because only carbon is produced and the amount of CO 2 comes from the combustion required to supply energy. The lowest proportion of hydrogen in lignocellulosic biomass leads to achieve conversion optimum with lower carbon conversion rates than for microalgae and thus convert the excess carbon into CO 2. In summary, from an environmental point of view, according to CO 2 production, long carbon chains have less impact. Spirulina have here also the most favourable place according to this GHG emission. Nevertheless, the impact of the nitrogen content of spirulina and more generally of microalgae do not have to be neglected. Its compositions are much higher than lignocellulosic biomass and may cause environmental issues especially by the production of NH 3 and NO x . In the continuity of this work, and with the objective of providing a tool as close as possible to real processes, future work will be able to complete the model by taking into account these by-products and their thermodynamic impact on optimal ratios. 4.4.2 Total mass implemented The total mass implemented goes from 1 kg to nearly 2 kg. The tendency leads the lowest carbon chain to produce higher quantity implemented mass flow. The case four (4) and the CO and H 2 production involved the highest total mass flow as they are the most endothermic cases, high quantity of oxygen is then needed. 4.4.3 Hydrogen cost analysis Scholar as Holtzapple and Granda [49], Hannula [50] or Sharifzadeh et al. [51] highlighted the relevance of the hydrogen to carbon ratios and the impact of hydrogen cost to the biomass conversion efficiency. A hydrogen production efficiency of 30% was originally considered. Even if this value seems already optimistic, the results obtained for hydrogen production from the biomass studied give respectively 40.7% and 44.16% for beech and spirulina. These production efficiencies are theoretical and do not really correspond to achievable values. However, new modelling has been conducted to understand the impact of hydrogen costs on conversions. These were based on the values previously obtained as well as from a confident value of 50% where hydrogen is supplied from an optimized external source. For the optimal carbon conversion configuration the cost of hydrogen has no influence on the optimal material and energy ratios. This result is because these optimum correspond to stoichiometric compositions where hydrogen is not required. Table 10 summarizes the energy ratio values for the three hydrogen production efficiency considered when the carbon conversion ratio is complete. This is the configuration where the hydrogen requirement is maximum. The impact of the change in efficiency is clearly visible and significant with a 17 to 18 percent point increase."
13,Comparison with biomass conversion data,"4.5 Comparison with biomass conversion data From another technical point of view this study opens a scope of experimental and theoretical investigations to define the most favourable product from one kind of biomass as well as the most favourable biomass from one desired product. The developed method provides theoretical values to be compared with the results of experimental studies or industrial processes. The data previously extracted from the literature were used below and compared with modelling results from this study. The appropriate conversion types for correct comparison were chosen based on basic criteria such as the produced element or the stoichiometric proportion in oxygen ( ξ O 2 ). The data from Sheehan et al. [28] and Hamelinck et al. [29] from fermentation were previously compared. Authors provide respectively 29.8% and 34.2% material ratios for cellulosic (C 6 H 10 O 5) ethanol production. Since these are fermentation studies, they should be compared to case three (3), which is an anaerobic reaction (equation (21)). The exact study's biomass should have been used with the method developed here, but for a first glimpse the beech is close and allows a sufficient evaluation. The theoretical optimal material ratio against which the result of the mentioned study is compared is 29.95% ( H % - case 6 - beech). Sheehan et al. [28] values are just below the theoretical value. On the other hand, Hamelinck et al. [29] obtain a much higher value than obtained theoretically. It is conceivable that their results do not take into account all the reactions or the energy costs involved. Ptasinski [25] studied the gasification of the biomass C H 1.68 O 0.52 N 0.96 S 0.013 into methanol and obtained a material ratio of 34.45% and an energy ratio of 21.29%. Their biomass, expressed with the same carbon basis to the biomass of this study, is C 33 H 56 O 17 N 3 . The gasification process can be compared to carbon conversion (equations (11)–(13)) and the cases 6 (equation (21)) and 7 (equation (22)) of the hydrogen rule with oxygen stoichiometry inferior to one ( ξ O 2 < 1 ). The maximum efficiency corresponds to case seven (7) (equation (22)) where oxygen is added in a small quantity with an energy ratio of 53.87% and a material ratio of 46.2%. Then the carbon rules yield 53.6% for energy and 45.9% for material for a carbon conversion ratio ( C % ) of 36.4%. Finally case 6 has energy ratio of 30.1% and material ratio of 25.82%. Their results are lower than the comparable theoretical results. This result suggests that their processes could be improved, especially since the differences from theoretical results are significant. It is important to note that the differences between material and energy yields are not identical. A gain of 12 points can be expected for the material ratio, while a gain of 32 points for energy ratio leads to expect a large thermal optimization of the process. This leads to the assumption that their evaluation criteria should be investigated in terms of consistency between the material and the energetic aspect in their study. Hirano et al. [21] provides a material ratio of 64% for methanol production by gasification of spirulina followed by a water-gas shift. For the spirulina the theoretical maximum material ratio is 59.6% for the seventh case of the hydrogen rules (equation (22)). Just below the carbon conversion rule (equations (11)–(13)) material ratio is 59.5%. Third case of hydrogen rules (equation (21)) brings the lowest theoretical result with a material ratio of 36.2%. The study material ratio is superior to all of the theoretical results possibly due to partial integration. Table A.7 in the appendix summarizes the previous comparison. Modelling could be enhanced by more advanced features such as product mixture formation and more complex biomass characteristics with consideration of moisture, ash and volatile matter."
14,Conclusions,"The first observation relates to the major role of stoichiometry. It has an influence on the reaction path, illustrated here by the different considerations made on the limiting element (C or H) or the feasibility of the different reactions considered (Cases 1 to 8). It emphasises on the need for an external contribution such as hydrogen, which affect the efficiency because of its energy cost as specified below. Products as well as reaction paths must be linked to the stoichiometry of the reagents (and vice versa). These links have received little attention in the literature. The composition of spirulina for example, where the presence of hydrogen is higher, allows to move the optimum up to higher carbon conversion ratios and higher energetic and material ratios for both alkanes and alcohols. The second observation is related to the impact of the hydrogen production cost to the energy and material ratio increase. For example, a 10-point reduction in the cost of hydrogen production can increase alkane production rates by the same amount. The third observation concerns the analysis of oxygen production considered in the fourth case and the eighth one. With all due regard to the shift from theoretical to experimental, this case could be open for investigation. A fourth observation is related to the best conversion observed. For the case where the carbon conversion ratio is observed, it is worth noting that optimal rates are not achieved for the full-carbon conversion ratio. Even if this is partly related to the stoichiometric problems discussed above and to the contribution of hydrogen, the optimum are reached for conversion ratios around 60–70% of carbon conversion, with exception for low carbon chains where optimal ratios are achieved around 36%–50% of carbon conversion ratio. In the case of hydrogen rules, the maximum conversion ratios allow the best efficiency. For all optimal cases, the reaction occurs with addition of elements, usually oxygen or hydrogen, which reacts with some of the elements (C, O or H) in the biomass to form carbon dioxide or water. Finally, given the results and the analysis and opportunities that such an approach offers, this tool must be developed in order to enable faster, more sophisticated and relevant use taking into account real processes. Nevertheless, the methodology and calculation proposal made, makes possible to identify optimal efficiency for biomass conversions and can already be used as a powerful universal performance indicator."
