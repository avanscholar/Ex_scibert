0,Introduction,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is currently one of the most promising methods for producing hydrogen [1–7]. Among them, the photocathode composed of molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) and monocrystalline silicon (Si) has attracted extensive concern [8–13]. Because Si is an ideal photocathode semiconductor material with a suitable optical band gap (1.1 eV), and it can absorb light with a wavelength of less than 1100 nm in the solar spectrum [14–19]. At the same time, MoSx with the characteristics of cheap and non-toxic, as a hydrogen evolution reaction HER promoter [20–29], can improve the problem of slow reaction kinetics on the Si surface. For example, Jihun Oh et al. developed an efficient Si/MoS2 photocathode by using the ALD method to directly grow MoS2 on the Si surface [30]. Song Jin et al. prepared Si/1T-MoS2 photocathode by CVD [31]. Jinhua Ye et al. prepared Si/a-MoSx photocathode by HF chemical reduction method [32]. These works have shown that the combination of MoSx and Si can construct a photocathode with excellent PEC performance. In addition to the above methods, the electrochemical deposition technology for fabricating Si-MoSx composite photocathode has attracted much attention. Electrodeposition does not require high-temperature and high-energy processes, which avoids damage to semiconductor materials during the fabricating process. However, the Si substrate has poor conductivity, and only a little amount of electrons moves directionally under the force of an electric field. It is difficult to achieve the reduction and deposition of the cathode to obtain MoSx. In order to solve the above problems, the photo-assisted electrodeposition was introduced into the process of fabricating MoSx on the surface of Si. The advantage of this approach is that that a large number of electrons are produced from Si under illumination, and undergo directional movement under the force of an electric field, which can reduce the [MoS4]2- on the Si surface into MoSx in situ. The related works are listed and compared in Table S1. For instance, Phong D. Tran et al. assembled MoS2 on the surface of Si nanowires to form Si-NW/MoS2 photocathode through metal-assisted chemical etching and photo-assisted electrodeposition, which was found to be mechanically robust and stable without MoS2 detachment even under ultrasonication conditions. But the onset potential of the photocathode is only 0 V vs RHE. The reason is that Si was corroded by the aqueous electrolyte during the photo-assisted electrodeposition process, and SiOx was then generated at the interface of Si and MoS2, hindering the interface transmission of photogenerated carriers [33]. In order to prevent the corrosion of the Si surface by the aqueous electrolyte, Michael J. Rose et al. used ionic liquid as the electrolyte to reduce the influence of dissolved oxygen in the solution on the substrate, which improved the onset potential (0.14 V vs RHE) of the Si/MoSx photocathode [34]. However, there is still a large interface resistance at the interface of Si and MoSx. In the field of photo-assisted electrodeposition for Si-MoSx, there are two most effective methods to reduce the interface resistance. One method is based on the buried junction, which is formed by preparing an n-type diffusion layer on the surface of p-Si [35,36]. The other method is based on the metal layer, which is inserted between MoS2 and Si. The buried junction can form a built-in electric field from n→p in the bulk phase of Si, facilitating the outward migration of photogenerated carriers. In addition, the metal interlayer can form a conductive metal silicide in the subsequent annealing process, which reduces the interface resistance of the outward migration of photogenerated carriers between MoS2 and Si. For example, Ib Chorkendorff et al. builted the surface n+p junction of p-Si through phosphorus doping from a gaseous POCl3 at 900 °C, and then the inserted metal (Ti) at the heterogeneous interface of n+p-Si/MoS2 photocathode by magnetron sputtering [37]. The n+p junction and inserted metal layer can improve the transport capability of carriers and enhance the stability, resulting in onset potential of 0.33 V vs RHE. Generally, the inserted metal layer is realized by magnetron sputtering, which requires harsh conditions of high vacuum and expensive equipment. The buried junction is usually realized by high temperature diffusion process, which requires poisonous POCl3 as phosphorus source, and even requires harsh conditions with temperature higher than 900 °C. In this way, it is worth considering how to reduce the interface resistance of Si/MoSx photocathode and improve the photoelectric catalytic efficiency under the green and mild conditions. N-doped carbon (CN) with graphene-like structure can increase conductivity and improve the interface compatibility between Si and MoSx. It can also passivate the surface to reduce the probability of introducing defects during the photo-assisted electrodeposition process, and provide electrodeposition sites for MoSx, thereby improving the stability of the photoelectrode. In addition, the thin CN layer has excellent optical transmittance, which can ensure that most of the light is absorbed by Si to generate photo-generated carriers. Therefore, a green and mild route of two-step wet etching, in situ polymerization and photo-assisted electro-deposition was designed to form bio-inspired photocathode, consisting of monocrystal Si with micro-pyramids and nano-pores (SiPN), conductive N-doped carbon (CN) layer and MoSx catalyst. The SiPN can provide has a large specific surface area and a high light-harvesting ability, contributing to producing more photogenerated carriers. MoSx as a catalyst can collect photogenerated carriers of Si and reduce their recombination, and thus enhance HER activity. The CN layer between MoSx and SiPN can increase conductivity, and improve the transfer of interfacial carriers."

2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials Acetone, chloroform, ethanol, dopamine hydrochloride (DA), potassium hydroxide, trishydroxymethylaminomethane (THAM), sodium molybdate dihydrate, sodium sulfide nonahydrate, isopropyl alcohol hydrochloric acid (37%) are all Analytical pure; all purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.; The reagents are used without special treatment. The Si wafer is monocrystalline Si [P type (100)] purchased from Youyan Semiconductor Materials Co., Ltd."
3,Fabrication of SiPN,"2.2 Fabrication of SiPN Firstly, the Si wafer was cut into 1 cm × 1 cm and ultrasonic cleaned with deionized water for 5 min. Then, the Si wafer was etched to form micro-pyramid Si (SiP) in KOH solution for 30 min at 85 ℃ [38,39]. Subsequently, Ag nanoparticles were deposited on SiP in HF (4.8 M) solution with AgNO3 (5 mM) for 1 min at 25 ℃. Finally, SiP with Ag nanoparticles was etched to form nano-pores (SiPN) in HF (4.8 M) solution with H2O2 (4 mM) for 6 min at 25 ℃ [40]."
4,Fabrication of SiPN/CN,"2.3 Fabrication of SiPN/CN (1) PDA deposition: SiPN was immersed into 30 mL buffer solution of THAM (0.01 mol), which contained DA hydrochloride (0.26 mol). The above solution was then slowly stirred with magnetic force at 30 °C for 100 min to form the PDA coating on SiPN (SiPN/PDA) by in-situ polymerization of DA. (2) PDA carbonization: PDA was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere and was treated by 5% HF for 1 min, to form a nitrogen-doped carbon layer on SiPN (SiPN/CN) [41]."
5,Fabrication of SiPN/CN/MoSx,"2.4 Fabrication of SiPN/CN/MoSx (1) Preparation of sodium tetrathiomolybdate: 0.24 g of sodium molybdate and 0.96 g of sodium sulfide were dissolved into 80 mL of deionized water. Subsequently, 5% of HCl was dropped slowly until the above solution turned black-red. Then, the volume and pH value of the above solution were adjusted to 100 mL and 8. (2) Photo-assisted electrodeposition of MoSx: 50 mL solution of sodium tetrathiomolybdate was taken as the electrolyte. SiPN/CN, platinum (Pt) mesh and Ag/AgCl were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. Thus, MoSx was deposited on SiPN/CN to form SiPN/CN/MoSx by photo-assisted electrodeposition at a constant potential of −1 V vs RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW·cm−2) for 200 s [42]."
6,Fabrication of SiPN/MoSx,"2.5 Fabrication of SiPN/MoSx SiPN/MoSx was fabricated by electrodepositing MoSx on SiPN instead of SiPN/CN, which electrodeposition condition is the same to that in Section 2.4."
7,Characterizations,"2.6 Characterizations The structural characterization of the sample was carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM, SITA HITACHI S-4800 (Japan) and ZEISS GEMINISEM360 (Germany)) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and. The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectrum of the sample was measured by the plus ultraviolet-visible near-infrared spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600, Japan). The photoelectric catalytic hydrogen production was measured by the electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Company CHI660, China). The crystal structure of the sample was determined by the X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker AXS D8, Germany). The valence state and electron transfer tests were performed using the Axis supra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Axis supra, Kratos UK). The amount of hydrogen produced was calibrated using the gas chromatograph (GC, Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument GC9790plus, China). The calcination of the material was carried out by vacuum horizontal tube furnace (Shanghai Shengli Testing Instrument SLG1300–60, China)."
8,Evaluation of photoelectric capability,"2.7 Evaluation of photoelectric capability The photo of the experimental setup for the evaluation of photoelectric capability has been shown in Fig. S7. A 300 W Xenon lamp was used as the excitation light source for the photoelectrochemical measurement experiment of SiPN/CN/MoSx. The power (100 mW·cm−2) of incident light on the sample was accurately maintained, which was measured by a standard power meter. The single-component conductive silver glue and the copper on the back of the Si substrate provided ohmic contact. The entire sample was completely protected with epoxy resin. PEC was tested with SiPN/CN/MoSx, Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively. All PEC tests were conducted in the voltage range of 0.4 to −0.6 V. The scan rate was 10 mV/s, the impedance measurement value was 1 Hz to 100 kHz, and the applied potential was 0 V vs RHE. The measurement was performed in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution so that the pH value was 0.3. The measurement temperature was accurately maintained at 25 °C, and all measured values were calibrated to ERHE = EAg/AgCl + E0 Ag/AgCl + 0.0591 ×pH, E0 Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) = 0.197 V at 25 ℃ using the Nernst equation [43,44]. 0 V vs RHE is equivalent to − 0.215 V vs Ag/AgCl in this article. The incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) values were determined by using the equation: (1) IPCE = hv × ( J light − J dark ) e λ P λ Where h is Planck constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, λ is the light wavelength, J light -J dark is the net photocurrent density, e is the electronic elementary charge and P λ is the incident light flux measured with a power meter. Faradaic efficiency (FE) was calculated using the following equation: (2) F E % = H y d r o g e n e v o l u t i o n m e a s u r e d ( J p h × A × t e / 2 ) / N A × 100 % where J pH is the current density (A·cm−2), A is the area (cm2), t is the time (s), e is the electronic elementary charge (1.602 ×10−19 C), and N A is the Avogadro number (6.02 ×1023 mol−1) [5]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Materials fabrication and surface characterization,"3.1 Materials fabrication and surface characterization The fabrication process of SiPN/CN/MoSx photocathode is shown in Fig. 1. In the first place, the micro-pyramid Si (SiP) was obtained by anisotropy etching in alkali solution. The morphology of SiP is shown in Fig. 2a, with height of 3 µm and smooth sidewalls of 54.7°. The formation of micro-pyramids is due to that the KOH etching rate of Si (111) is ~30 times lower than that of Si (100) [45]. Then, nano-pores were constructed on SiP (SiPN) by metal catalytic etching in HF/H2O2 solution. According to the effective medium theory (EMT) [46,47], the micro-pyramids and nano-pores of SiPN can slow down the change of the refractive index from air to substrate, which helps to reduce the reflection of incident light. Its excellent anti-reflective performance is shown in “3.2 optical properties characterization” and discussed in detail. The morphology of SiPN is shown in Fig. 2b, which diameter and height of nano-pores are 150 and 800 nm, respectively. Subsequently, PDA was assembled on the surface of SiPN. Fig. 2c shows the SEM image of SiPN with PDA, which is derived from the in-situ polymerization of DA with strong adhesion. PDA is uniformly distributed with a particle size of ~10 nm, as shown in Fig. S1. The nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) [48] layer was then grown on SiPN (SiPN/CN) by annealing PDA, which can reduce the contact resistance between Si and MoSx. Its morphology is shown in Fig. 2d, indicating that the CN layer has a relatively uniform distribution on the sidewall surface of the Si nano-pores. Finally, MoSx was assembled on SiPN/CN (SiPN/CN/MoSx) through the photo-assisted electrodeposition technology, which is uniformly distributed, as shown in Fig. 2e. MoSx can collect photo-generated electrons and accelerate the rate of HER reaction. As shown in Fig. 2f with XRD patterns, the sharp peak at 2θ value of 69° is the diffraction peak of monocrystalline Si, and the broad peaks at 2θ value of 27° and 10°, correspond corresponding to the amorphous C and MoSx, respectively. Thus, the SiPN/CN/MoSx photocathode for hydrogen evolution has been successfully fabricated. Fig. 3 is EDS images showing the element distribution of Si, C, N, Mo and S, which indicates the uniform distribution of CN and MoSx on SiPN. In particular, the CN layer is critical to the performance of the SiPN/CN/MoSx photocathode for the following reasons. (1) The inserted CN layer with excellent conductivity can effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons generated by Si to the surface of MoSx, which reduces the recombination probability of photogenerated electrons and holes and improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the SiPN/CN/MoSx electrode. (2) The inserted CN layer with high transmittance (seeing Fig. S2) to incident light can ensure the effective light-absorption of the underlying Si substrate, increasing the number of photogenerated carriers and improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the electrode. (3) The inserted CN layer can improve the interfacial compatibility between Si and MoSx, which prevents MoSx from falling off the electrode. (4) The inserted CN layer can prevent Si from being oxidized by the electrolyte, improving the electrochemical stability of SiPN/CN/MoSx. In order to further prove the distribution of the various components of the SiPN/CN/MoSx photocathode, the SEM image with cross-sectional analysis of the SiPN/CN/MoSx is shown in Fig. S3a. It is obvious that there are two areas on the surface of the Si substrate, namely area Ӏ and area II. According to the assembly sequence of the components in the sample, it is predicted that area Ӏ and area II are the CN layer and the MoSx layer, respectively, and their corresponding average thicknesses are 8.6 nm and 30.9 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. S3b shows the SEM cross-sectional image of the SiPN substrate with only CN layer. To further prove the above prediction, the elemental composition and bonding energy of MoSx layer and CN layer on the surface of the SiPN/CN/MoSx photocathode were respectively analyzed by XPS [49–51] combined with etching process, as shown in Fig. 4a-e. First of all, when the sample is not etched, there are Mo and S elements. Fig. 4b and Table S2 show that four binding energy (BE) peaks located at 229.90, 233.20, 232.50 and 235.60 eV represent Mo 3d5/2 orbital of MoIV, Mo 3d3/2 orbital of MoIV, Mo 3d5/2 orbital of MoVI and Mo 3d3/2 orbital of MoVI, respectively. Fig. 4c and Table S2 show that the BE peaks at 161.80 and 162.50 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of S2-, and the BE peaks at 163.40 and 164.50 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of coordinated S2 2-. Fig. 4c and Table S2 show that the BE peaks at 162.05 and 163.32 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of S2-, which has lower HER activity. And the BE peaks at 163.10 and 164.50 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2, S 2p1/2 orbitals of coordinated S2 2-, which has higher HER activity [49,51]. The above analysis proves that the outer layer is MoSx. In addition, it is found that there is C element at the same time, which was caused by the adsorption of a little amount of CO2 and organic gases in the air on the surface of MoSx. After the sample was etched for 2 min, the C element basically disappeared, and the relevant characteristic peaks of MoSx still existed, further proving that the material in area II is MoSx. After the sample was etched for another 60 min, the Mo and S elements disappeared, but the C and N elements appeared, as shown in Fig. 2a. At the same time, Fig. 4d shows that the BE peaks at 284.00, 284.80, 285.80, 286.60 and 288.60 eV, respectively correspond to the sp2 C–C, sp3 C–C, sp2 C–N, sp3 C–O and sp3 C–N structures in the C 1 s region, respectively. In addition, Fig. 4e shows that the BE peaks at 398.70 and 400.10 eV correspond to the sp3 C–N and sp2 C–N structures in the N 1s region, respectively. The above analysis indicates that the lower part of the MoSx layer was the CN layer, and further verifies the accuracy of the prediction for area I. In summary, the CN layer and MoSx layer were assembled on the SiPN surface in turn."
11,Optical properties characterization,"3.2 Optical properties characterization Fig. 4f shows the reflectance spectrum of SiF/CN/MoSx, SiP/CN/MoSx, SiPN/CN/MoSx and SiPN/MoSx. The reflectance of SiF/CN/MoSx, SiP/CN/MoSx, SiPN/CN/MoSx decreased in turn, as shown in curves (a)-(c). Among them, SiPN/CN/MoSx has the lowest reflectivity, which is less than 6% in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm. This sample showed excellent anti-reflection ability. This is due to that SiPN/CN/MoSx has an excellent anti-reflective structure of micro-pyramid and nano-pores. According to EMT, the sudden change of refractive index from air to the substrate surface is reduced and the optical path of the incident light through the multiple reflections of the micro-nano structure is increased [52,53]. At the same time, curve (d) shows that the reflectivity of SiPN/CN/MoSx is so close to that of SiPN/MoSx, indicating that the CN coating inserted between SiPN and MoSx has not adverse effects on the reflectivity of the sample. In addition, the optical band gap of the sample is calculated by using the classical optical absorption relationship [54–57], as shown in Fig. S4. The mean value of Eg (Si) is 1.12 eV, which is consistent with literature reports [14,16]. Meanwhile, we have utilized the same method to calculate Eg of MoSx, which is about 1.32 eV."
12,Photoelectrochemical behavior and performance,"3.3 Photoelectrochemical behavior and performance SiPN/CN/MoSx as a photocathode is used to research PEC performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW·cm−2). (1) In order to prove the assembly advantage of SiPN/CN/MoSx, the LSVs of SiPN/CN/MoSx, SiPN/MoSx and SiPN are compared, as shown in Fig. 5a. It can be seen that the photocurrent density (10 mA·cm−2) of SiPN/CN/MoSx was 2.2 times and 6.5 times that of SiPN/MoSx and SiPN/CN at 0 V vs RHE. Meanwhile, the onset potential (defined as the potential at −1 mA·cm−2) of SiPN/CN/MoSx has a more positive value than that of SiPN/MoSx and SiPN, reaching 0.23 V vs RHE. On one hand, SiOx may is then generated at the interface of SiPN and MoSX for SiPN/MoSx, because, during cathodic deposition, amorphous SiO2 or H2SiO3 is readily formed on the surface of bare Si by oxidation of the electrolyte, which seriously hinders the migration of electrons to the electrode surface [58]. On the other hand, the improved photoelectric performance of SiPN/CN/MoSx is attributed to that the CN coating facilitates transfer of photogenerated electrons from Si to MoSx. Meanwhile, the HER activity of the photocathode is improved by MoSx. (2) To prove the structural advantage of SiPN/CN/MoSx, the LSVs of SiPN/CN/MoSx, SiF/CN/MoSx and SiP/CN/MoSx are compared, as shown in Fig. 5b. The photocurrent density of SiPN/CN/MoSx is 8.4 and 6.6 times of that of SiF/CN/MoSx and SiP/CN/MoSx at 0 V vs RHE. Because SiPN/CN/MoSx has excellent anti-reflection ability (seeing Fig. 4f), which can capture more incident light, resulting in more photo-generated carriers. More detailed explanations about the relationship between decreasing light-reflection and increasing photocurrent density have been given in Section 2 of Supplementary Information. Fig. 5c and d show that all photocathodes exhibit sensitive photocurrent response corresponding to the OFF/ON lighting cycle. In addition, the optimization of CN coating and MoSx attached is shown in Fig. S5. To better understand the contribution of CN and MoSx to the photo-generated carrier mobility of SiPN/CN/MoSx [57], EIS of SiPN/CN/MoSx, SiPN/CPDA, SiPN/MoSx and SiPN at 0 V vs RHE is compared in 0.5 M H2SO4 under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW·cm−2), as shown in Fig. 6. The Nyquist plots are fitted according to the equivalent circuit models [59,60], where Rs represents the series resistance, Rct2 represents the charge transfer resistance between Si and MoSx, and Rct1 represents the charge transport resistance at the electrode/electrolyte surface. It can be seen from the curve (a) that Rs, Rct1 and Rct2 of SiPN/CN/MoSx are 17.77 Ω, 13.41 Ω and 2.68 Ω, respectively. Comparing curve (a) with curve (b), Rct2 of SiPN/MoSx is 62.28 Ω far higher than that of SiPN/CN/MoSx, indicating that CN coating can effectively reduce the charge transfer resistance between Si and MoSx. Comparing curve (a) with curve (c), Rct1 of SiPN/CN is 301.40 Ω far higher than that of SiPN/CN/MoSx, indicating that MoSx can reduce the charge transfer resistance from the electrode surface to the electrolyte. It is worth noting that the Nyquist plot for the SiPN electrode possesses only one impedance semicircle. The SiPN electrode is composed of only one material, resulting that there is only one charge transfer resistance (Rct1) between the electrode and the electrolyte, and no charge transfer resistance (Rct2) between heterogeneous interfaces inside the electrode. The total resistance (R=Rs +Rct1+Rct2) is given in the Table S3, according to R(SiPN/CN/MoSx)< R(SiPN/MoSx)< R(SiPN/CN)< R(SiPN), further illustrating that CN and MoSx can reduce the charge transfer resistance and increase the HER rate of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The stability is regarded as an important parameter of photoelectrode. The PEC stability of SiPN/CN/MoSx and SiPN/MoSx at 0 V vs RHE in 0.5 MH2SO4 was tested by chronoamperometry, as shown in Fig. 7a. The J-t curve shows that the photocurrent density of SiPN/MoSx is reduced from − 6.01 mA·cm−2 at 1 h to −1.88 mA·cm−2 at 12 h after chronoamperometry test. However, the photocurrent density of SiPN/CN/MoSx is reduced from − 9.64 mA·cm−2 at 1 h to −7.16 mA·cm−2 at 12 h after chronoamperometry test. It is indicating that the stability of SiPN/CN/MoSx is much better than that of SiPN/MoSx. To analyze the reason that the electrochemical stability of SiPN/CN/MoSx is better than that of SiPN/MoSx, the binding energy and morphology of MoSx before and after the chronoamperometry test for 12 h are compared, seeing Fig. 8 and Fig. S6. On the one hand, S2 2- is the active center for HER, which content is proportional to the photocurrent. After the chronoamperometry test for 12 h, as shown in Fig. 8, the atomic ratio of S2 2- to S2- in SiPN/CN/MoSx and SiPN/MoSx decreased by 13% and 24%, respectively. This will cause the photocurrent of SiPN/MoSx to drop much more than that of SiPN/CN/MoSx. On the other hand, the interface compatibility between SiPN and MoSx in SiPN/CN/MoSx is better than that in SiPN/MoSx. In the process of hydrogen escaping from the photoelectrodes, MoSx on the SiPN/CN/MoSx surface was almost unchanged after the chronoamperometry test for 12 h, while the MoSx on the SiPN/MoSx surface was obviously shed, seeing Fig. S6. In addition, the hydrogen generation of the photocathode was measured by gas chromatography. In Fig. 7b, curves (a), (b) and (c) show the time - dependent actual hydrogen productivities of SiPN/CN/MoSx, SiF/CN/MoSx and SiPN/MoSx, respectively. The hydrogen production rate of SiPN/CN/MoSx can reach 152.22 µmol·cm−2·h−1 within 2 h, which is 2.31 times (65.82 µmol·cm−2·h−1) and 2.09 times (72.72 µmol·cm−2·h−1) than that of SiF/CN/MoSx and SiPN/MoSx, respectively. At the same time, the time - dependent theoretical hydrogen productivities of SiPN/CN/MoSx, SiF/CN/MoSx and SiPN/MoSx are presented by curves (d), (e) and (f) in Fig. 7b, respectively. In the PEC system, when the photoelectrode is irradiated by sunlight, the monocrystalline Si can absorb the light of <1000 nm and produce photogenerated carriers. Subsequently, the photogenerated carriers are separated under the built-in electric field and/or applied bias voltage, and then transferred to the MoSx cocatalyst on the electrode surface through the conductive CN layer, which can reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons. It is well known that MoSx is an excellent HER catalyst, which can accelerate the HER reaction rate and reduce the overpotential due to the unsaturated S atoms of edge. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons make H+ in the electrolyte reduce to H2 on the surface of MoSx. At the same time, the photogenerated holes are guided by the external current to the counter electrode (Pt), so that H2O is oxidized to O2. Combining the actual hydrogen production and the theoretical hydrogen production, Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of SiPN/CN/MoSx, SiF/CN/MoSx and SiPN/MoSx are 85.08%, 80.03% and 80.79%, respectively. In order to express the relationship between PEC and the incident wavelength, the IPCE measurement was carried out. Fig. 9 shows the IPCE spectra of SiPN, SiPN/CN, SiPN/MoSx and SiPN/CN/MoSx photoanodes measured with an applied bias potential of 0 V vs RHE in the wavelength region of 350–1000 nm in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The SiPN and SiPN/CN photocathode show very low IPCE values. The SiPN/MoSx photoanode show an IPCE value of 30%. After the insertion of a CN layer, the SiPN/CN/MoSx photoanode shows an enhanced IPCE value of 45%, which is almost 1.5 times than that of the SiPN/MoSx photoanode. A typical PEC procedure is consisted of three steps (i.e. the production of photon-generated carriers, the migration of photon-generated carriers and the redox reaction of photon-generated carriers on the surface of electrodes.). In this system, Si is used for the generation of photon-generated carriers. The MoSx (catalyst) layer, which can provide active sites to adsorb H+/H3O+, is used for the reduction reaction of photon-generated carriers and H+/H3O+. The CN layer is a connective layer for Si and MoSx, and is used to improve the migration efficiency of photon-generated carriers from Si to MoSx. Therefore, the MoSx layer and the CN layer play different roles in the SiPN/CN/MoSx photocathode. As shown in Fig. 9, the IPCE performance of SiPN/CN is worse than SiPN/MoSx. This is because the catalytic performance of CN is much weaker than MoSx, which only little carriers take part in the redox reaction of H+/H3O+. The above phenomenon, in combination with the better IPCE performance of SiPN/CN/MoSx than that of SiPN/MoSx, further illustrates that the major role of CN layer in the electrode is improving the migration efficiency of carriers and reducing the recombination of carriers. In addition, the Mott Schottky curve of the electrode was obtained by electrochemical test and then calculated to determine the Fermi level position (Efb = 0.195 eV vs NHE) of the SiPN/CN/MoSx electrode, as shown in Fig. 10a. Whereafter, the position of the valence band (EVB-NHE (si) = 1.14 eV and EVB-NHE (MoSx) = 0.42 eV) of Si and MoSx was obtained through XPS test and calculation, as shown in Fig. 10b. In addition, according to the diffuse reflection spectra, the optical band gap width (Eg (Si) = 1.12 eV and Eg (MoSx) = 1.32 eV) of Si and MoSx was calculated by the Kubelka-Munk equation. Finally, the conduction band position (ECB-NHE (Si) = −0.70 eV and ECB-NHE (MoSx) = −0.18 eV) of Si and MoSx was calculated according to EVB-NHE and Eg. The detailed derivation process is given in Section 3 of Supplementary Information. According to the EVB-NHE and ECB-NHE position of Si and MoSx, the schematic diagram of charge transfer and separation on the SiPN/CN/MoSx photocathode involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction has been given in Fig. 10c. As the SiPN/CN/MoSx electrode is irradiated by incident light, the photogenerated electrons of Si are transferred to the conduction band of MoSx through CN to carry out the reduction reaction of H+→H2. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes of MoSx are transferred to the valence band of Si and then to the counter electrode (Pt) through the external circuit."
13,Conclusion,"In general, we used a simple method of in-situ polymerization and calcination to insert a stability enhanced and conductive C layer between the light absorber Si and the cocatalyst. That is, a PDA coating is formed by in situ polymerization, and a N-doped C layer is formed subsequently by calcination on the surface of the pyramid nanowires silicon wafer. After using a simple electrodeposition method, TMD is deposited on Si to assemble SiPN/CN/MoSX photoelectrode. The effects of different morphologies and different coatings on the photocatalytic performance were compared from two directions. This study shows that the CN coating acts as a conductive layer, which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the photocathode, thereby promoting the positive transfer of the photoexcited electrons. The N-doped C layer acts as an additional protective layer on the Si photoelectrode to improve the stability of the photocathode in PEC test. The in-situ carbonization of PDA coating on the interface layer between Si and MoSx is an effective and simple method to improve the electrochemical activity and stability of silicon-based photocathode."
