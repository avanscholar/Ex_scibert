0,Introduction,"With increasing concerns on diminishing fossil resources, deteriorating global environment and changing climate, seeking green and sustainable resources for chemicals and liquid fuels production is receiving worldwide attention in recent decades (Chen et al., 2020; Gallezot, 2012; Zhang and Huber, 2018). Among the possible candidates, biomass shows great potential as a clean and renewable carbon-containing source to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals (Konur, 2012; Lucia et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2018). Particularly, the catalytic transformation of renewable biomass resources into various biofuels and valuable chemicals is undoubtedly the most appealing choice (Dong et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2019; Zhang and Chen, 2017; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2018). Furfural (FFR), a derivative from acid degradation of C5 based carbohydrates, is regarded as one of the most important platform chemicals by the US Department of Energy (Climent et al., 2014; Mariscal et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017). Selective hydrogenation is considered as an effective method for the upgrading of FFR into a variety of high value-added chemicals. Furfuryl alcohol (FA), formed by hydrogenation of aldehyde group in FFR, has been recognized as an important versatile compound for the synthesis of a broad range of derivatives such as artificial fibers, resins and methyl furan (Aldosari, 2019; Gupta, 2018; Kunkes, 2008; Lesiak, 2014; Mariscal, 2016; Nakagawa, 2013; Villaverde, 2013; Ye, 2017; Zhang, 2015, 2018; Zhou, 2019). Typically, various mono- or bimetallic catalysts, comprising Cu, Ni, Pd, Ru and Pt, have been applied for FFR hydrogenation in the presence of pressurized pure H2. In this manner, high FFR conversion (~100%) and good product selectivity can be attained after the reaction (Gong et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). Recently, application of transfer hydrogenation in upgrading biomass derived molecules has gained extensive interest. This technique can overcome several obvious drawbacks such as over hydrogenation and use of flammable H2 with high pressure (Li, 2020; Shi, 2019). In this regard, various organic hydrogen donors have been explored, such as lower alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-propanol, and 2-butanol) and formic acid (Flack et al., 2012; Gyngazova et al., 2019). In addition, the lower alcohols are preferable in comparison with formic acid considering long-term corrosiveness. Particularly, 2-propanol ranks in priority for being used as a green hydrogen source with higher yields and selectivity obtained. Meanwhile, a number of transition metal (Cu, Co, Ru, Zr, etc.) catalysts have been employed for the transfer hydrogenation. For instance, Cu–Mg–Al catalysts gave nearly 100% conversion in the liquid-phase transfer hydrogenation of FFR at 150 °C (Villaverde et al., 2015). Hydroxyapatite-encapsulated γ-Fe2O3 acting as magnetic base afforded 91.7% FA yield at a conversion of 96.2% (Fan and Zhang, 2017). Other types of catalysts, such as zeolites, alumina–carbon composite and commercial alumina (Al2O3) also showed good performance in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of FFR via Meerwein − Ponndorf − Verley (MPV) reduction. In comparison, Zr-containing materials such as ZrOCl2, ZrO2, ZrO(OH)x, and Zr-zeolites with abundant acid − base sites are reported to be highly efficient catalysts in the CTH reactions. In essence, the acid − base sites of these Zr-based materials play a critical role in the H-transfer reactions for FA formation. Therefore, oriented regulation of acid/base ratio is a prerequisite for the synthesis of highly active catalysts for the CTH of FFR into FA. In the present work, boron constituent was introduced for the proper adjustment of Brønsted/Lewis (B/L) acid sites and acidity/basicity. A series of boron doped magnetic zirconium catalysts (ZrxByFeO) with different Zr/B molar ratios were synthesized and applied for the CTH of FFR into FA using 2-propanol as hydrogen source and solvent. Comprehensive characterizations of ZrxByFeO catalysts were performed to unveil the specific structural properties. Potential relationship between catalytic activity and acidity/basicity was explored in depth. Meanwhile, kinetic study for FFR-to-FA conversion was conducted as well, in which lower activation energy of 48.3 kJ/mol was achieved over Zr1B3FeO catalyst. The reuse experiments suggested that ZrxByFeO was recyclable with good catalytic activity. Besides, possible reaction mechanism for FFR-to-FA transformation with ZrxByFeO was proposed in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural (FFR, 99%), furfuryl alcohol (FA, 98%), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF, 99%), 2,5-furandimethanol (BHMF, 98%), spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles (99%) were supplied from Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). ZrOCl2·8H2O (98%), (NH4)2B10O16·H2O (99%), ammonia water (25 ~ 28%), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), and other commercially available chemicals were provided from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Notably, FFR was distilled under vacuum before use."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation In a typical procedure, certain amounts of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, ZrOCl2·8H2O and (NH4)2B10O16·H2O with different Zr/B molar ratios (1:1, 1:3, 1:9, 3:1 and 9:1) were dissolved in deionized water and stirred at room temperature for another 6 h. Subsequently, the pH value was adjusted to 12 using concentrated NH3·H2O at room temperature. The obtained mixtures were thoroughly washed with deionized water until the residual Cl- was removed completely. Then the precipitate was dried at 80 °C overnight, followed by calcination in air at 400 °C for 4 h. The resulting sample was named as ZrxByFeO, where x/y represented the Zr/B molar ratio."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The phase composition was identified through X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a Panalytical X’pert Pro diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 40 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Kratos Ultra system equipped with an Al Kα radiation source. The thermal behaviors of fresh and spent catalysts were studied by thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis in nitrogen atmosphere on a Model SDT Q 600 equipment. The textural parameters of ZrxByFeO were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (SI-MP-10, Quantachrome). Before test, the sample was degassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 15 h. The morphology of prepared samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR) analysis was completed on Bruker FT-IR Tensor 27 equipped with BX-5 in situ transmission FT-IR device, to identify acid type and density of ZrxByFeO. The elemental mapping was completed on high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN) with operating voltage of 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorbance spectra were measured on a Nicolet iN10 FT-IR Microscope to identify the functional groups on the ZrxByFeO samples. The measurements of acid density were completed on a Quantachrome ChemStar chemisorption analyzer following an ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) method. For each run, the sample was heated up to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and kept for 0.5 h in a He flow to remove adsorbed impurities. Then the sample was cooled down to 100 °C for the adsorption of NH3. After flushing with He for 1 h to remove physically adsorbed NH3, the TPD data were collected from 100 °C to 900 °C with a ramp of 20 °C/min. CO2-TPD analysis also was carried out in a similar method for obtaining base density, where adsorbed gas NH3 was replaced with CO2. Specific calculation method for obtaining catalyst acidity/basicity was shown below. First, based on pulse chemical adsorption, calibration value (CV) was calculated according to the equation [1]: (1) CV = loop volume × percentage of analytical gas / mean calibration area Then gas adsorption volume was obtained through the following equation [2]: (2) Volume μ L = CV × analytical area Next, molar weight of adsorbed gas was calculated through equation [3]: (3) molar weight of adsorbed gas μ mol = pressure × volume / 0.082 × 293.15 Finally, acidity/basicity of catalyst (denoted as uptake) was obtained according to the equation [4]: (4) Uptake μ mol / g = molar weight of adsorbed gas / mass"
5,Procedure for CTH of FFR into FA,"2.4 Procedure for CTH of FFR into FA In a typical run, catalyst, FFR (1.2 mmol) and 2-propanol (15 mL) were put into a 100 mL stainless steel reactor. The reactor was flushed with N2 for 5 times to remove the residual air and then pressurized to 1 MPa with N2. After the reaction, the liquid products were collected and analyzed by gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and DB-5HT capillary column (30.0 m × 0.32 μm × 0.25 μm). The GC–MS analysis was operated on TRACE 1300 ISQ system equipped with DB-5HT capillary column. The flow rate of carrier gas was 75 mL/min and the injector port operated at 260 °C. The operating conditions were as follows: injector port temperature, 260 °C; column temperature, initial temperature 50 °C (3 min), gradient rate 10 °C/min, 160 °C (1 min), gradient rate 5 °C/min, final temperature 230 °C (3 min). The final products and intermediates were identified according to each MS chart. The formulas for calculating FFR conversion and FA yield were as follows: Conversion mol % = mole of FFR converted / mole of FFR fed × 100 Yield mol % = mole of FA produced / mole of substrate fed × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of boron doped magnetic zirconium catalysts with different molar ratios of Zr/B. Obviously, these catalysts presented similar patterns with symmetric peaks in an angle range from 30° to 80°. The diffraction peaks located at 2θ of ca. 30.3°, 35.7°, 43.4°, 53.9°, 57.4° and 63.1° were indexed to (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) crystalline planes of nano Fe3O4 particles, which matched well with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards file no. 19-0629 (Asuha et al., 2011). Only a weak diffraction peak assigned to tetragonal zirconia at 2θ value of 74.4° with plane (004) was observed, probably due to relatively low Zr loading and good dispersion (Djurado et al., 2000; Kanade et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2018). In the aspect of B constituent, no typical diffraction peaks were detected out, suggesting the high dispersion and amorphous state of B species. The surface chemical state of ZrxByFeO was further investigated by XPS analysis, as depicted in Fig. 2 . The C 1 s, O 1 s, Zr 3d, Fe 2p and B 1 s species were obtained according to the full range XPS spectra (Fig. 2a). As seen from Fig. 2b, the high resolution scan of B 1 s at binding energy of 191.1 eV could be attributed to B–O binding (Yang et al., 2020). Two photoelectron peaks at 182.3 eV and 184.7 eV were assigned to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 separately (Nakahara and Kaneko, 2020). In the case of Fe 2p, the high resolution scans of Fe 2p3/2 at ~ 711 eV and Fe 2p1/2 at ~ 724 eV were clearly shown in Fig. 2d (Jiang et al., 2012). As indicated in Fig. 2f-2j, Fe 2p photoelectron peaks could be resolved into four typical compositions by means of XPS peak differentiation imitating analysis, i.e. Fe(II) 2p3/2, Fe(III) 2p3/2, Fe(II) 2p1/2, Fe(III) 2p1/2, confirming the presence of magnetic nanoparticles Fe3O4. Actually, the binding energy for Fe 2p in the prepared ZrxByFeO did not show significant change with the increase in Zr/B molar ratio, owing to the good stability of commercial Fe3O4. In comparison, Zr/B components were formed via co-precipitation method using corresponding precursors. Zr/B oxides obtained through calcination might show different chemical states, as inferred from the binding energy shift of O 1 s (Fig. 2e). The interaction between Zr–O and B–O might play a vital role in the shift of binding energy, in the case of adjusting the Zr/B molar ratio. Obviously, Zr 3d orbit shifted to low binding energy zone when lowering B doping amount. Fig. 3 gives the SEM images of as-prepared ZrxByFeO catalysts to verify the sample morphology. Three samples with Zr/B molar ratios of 1:3, 3:1 and 9:1 were selected for SEM analysis. Obviously, a number of spherical nanoparticles were formed through coating Zr and B on the surface of nano Fe3O4, followed by aggregating into honeycomb-like structure. As for spent Zr1B3FeO (being used three times), a series of spherical nanoparticles with honeycomb-like structure were found, indicating that the main structures of catalyst remained intact during the recycling experiments. As seen from Fig. 4 , the element mapping images verified the successful coating of B and Zr into Fe3O4 nanosphere, with good dispersion uniformity. The temperature-programmed desorption profiles of desorbed NH3/CO2 on ZrxByFeO catalysts were conducted to obtain the specific values of acidity and basicity. The NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respectively. Table 1 summarizes the calculated acid/base density according to the desorption profiles. It is well known that the existing acid-base pairs plays a crucial role in the MPV reduction of FFR (Ji et al., 1998). For both TPD profiles, plentiful weak and medium acid/base sites corresponding to the desorption temperature range of 150 ~ 300 °C and 350 ~ 600 °C respectively were attained for all the samples, while desorption curves verifying the presence of strong acid/base sites were almost undetectable in high-temperature zone. As seen from Table 1, with increasing B content (lower Zr/B molar ratios), the catalyst acidity could be apparently enhanced to some extent when adjusting Zr/B molar ratio from 9:1 to 1:3, thus resulting in an increased R value (ratio of acidity/basicity). However, high Zr/B molar ratio at 9:1 gave a reduced acidity and basicity. It is inferred that the active acid centers derived from Zr-O frameworks were partly replaced with B-O structural units, which nearly reached equilibrium states in a Zr/B molar ratio of 1:3. With the in-depth research, Py-IR experiments were also carried out to identify the B/L acid amounts in ZrxByFeO samples, with the results shown in Table1. Apparently, L acid centers accounted for a large proportion in the magnetic ZrxByFeO catalysts, instead of B acid centers. It is noteworthy that B/L acid sites detected upon Py-IR method exhibited much lower acidity compared to that from NH3-TPD profiles, probably due to the existence of acidic –OH on catalyst surface (Emeis, 1993). The mesoporosity of as-prepared magnetic ZrxByFeO catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption − desorption isotherms. The BET surface area, total pore volume (T.P.V.) and pore diameter (P.D.) of these samples were listed in Table 1. As observed from Fig. 7 . the as-prepared ZrxByFeO displayed type V isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop. From N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, relatively weak interaction between all the magnetic samples and N2 was found in a low-pressure region (P/P0 range of 0 ~ 0.3). As can be seen from Table 1, excess B doping for the replacement of Zr led to an obvious decrease of BET surface area, particularly for Zr1B3FeO and Zr1B9FeO samples. Zr1B9FeO presented the lowest values regarding BET surface area, total pore volume and pore diameter, which might not benefit the H-transfer reaction of FFR. TG-DTG technique is undertaken to assess the catalyst stability and carbon deposition of recycled samples. As seen from Fig. 8 , fresh Zr1B3FeO showed an initial marginal weight loss of around 5 wt% before being heated to 300 °C, largely ascribable to the thermal removal of physisorbed water and surface hydroxyl groups. Higher treating temperatures (>300 °C) only gave little weight loss (~1%). The carbon deposits on the spent Zr1B3FeO after being used three times was also analyzed through TG-DTG test. In comparison with fresh Zr1B3FeO, an obvious weight loss in a temperature range of 300 ~ 500 °C appeared in the spent sample, probably due to the thermal decomposition of accumulated organic compounds on the catalyst surface. Only ~ 2 wt% residual was formed on the regenerated catalyst according to TG analysis, implying that the magnetic catalyst could still maintain relatively good activity in the recycling experiments. For the FT-IR analysis of fresh and spent Zr1B3FeO (Fig. 9 ), almost all the functional groups and binding bonds were still present in the recycled sample. The very broad intense peak in the range of 3100 ~ 3650 cm−1 was attributed to the O–H stretching frequency. Characteristic peak ranging from 500 ~ 750 cm−1 could be assigned to X–O (X = Zr, B, Fe) bond vibration (Singh et al., 2020). Furthermore, the band appearing at ~ 1380 cm−1 verified the existing of carboxyl C = O derived from adsorbed CO2 (Das and Sarmah, 2015; Spitler et al., 2010). The adsorption band at around 1610 cm−1 might be ascribable to H–O–H bending vibration. Interestingly, peak at 750 cm−1 was observed for the spent Zr1B3FeO, probably due to the presence of functional groups from adsorbed organics."
8,Activity test and kinetic study,"3.2 Activity test and kinetic study The as-prepared ZrxByFeO catalysts were employed for CTH of FFR using 2-propanol as both the solvent and the hydrogen donor. As depicted in Fig. 10 , variation of Zr/B molar ratio from 9:1 to 1:3 gave a FA yield of 63.0 ~ 66.3%, in the meanwhile, over 70% conversion rate also could be attained. It is seen that similar catalytic activities were afforded over these ZrxByFeO catalysts. As Zr/B molar ratio increased to 1:9, significant decline in FA yield and FFR conversion was observed, probably due to the poor porous structure and inappropriate acidity/basicity ratio. As is well known, acidity and basicity are important parameters in the transfer hydrogenation reactions. In this regard, R value, signifying ratio of acidity to basicity, was utilized as a reference index. Potential relationship between R value and catalytic activity was provided in Fig. 11 a and 11b. Under the given reaction conditions, proper increasing R value favored the FFR conversion as well as FA formation. It is to be mentioned that conversion rate reached equilibrium states at R value of ~ 4.8, while the optimal FA yield was balanced at R range of 3.8 ~ 4.0. Thus, it is inferred that the presence of abundant acid-base centers accelerated the transformation of substrate FFR, but only suitable acidity/basicity ratio benefited the selective production of FA. With the in-depth study, the effect of B/L on catalytic activity was also taken into consideration, with the result shown in Fig. 11c and 11d. In this aspect, no more useful information on inner relationship was exploited, because acidity alone could not function as a decisive factor. In addition, as verified by Py-IR analysis, L acid centers constituted the main source of catalyst acidity absolutely, therefore no distinct correlation between B/L and catalytic activity was achieved. Herein, Zr1B3FeO, Zr3B1FeO, and Zr9B1FeO were chosen for conducting the follow-up experiments and kinetic studies. Fig. 12 describes the effect of temperature on FA yield as a function of reaction time over above three catalysts. Four temperatures with an interval of 20 °C, i.e. 110 °C, 130 °C, 150 °C, and 170 °C, were set for performing the H-transfer reaction to produce FA. In the initial stage, elevation of reaction temperature obviously promoted the proceeding of FFR transfer hydrogenation. As reaction time was prolonged, FA yield increased gradually at low temperatures, particularly 110 °C and 130 °C. While for higher reaction temperatures of 150 °C and 170 °C, the corresponding reaction rates were enhanced greatly that gave much more FA in short time period, as confirmed from reaction rate constants (k) in Table 2 and FA yield in Fig. 12. In comparison, Zr3B1FeO and Zr9B1FeO catalysts were much more efficient in FA production than Zr1B3FeO under identical conditions, in which over 90% yield towards FA could be achieved in 1.5 h. It is mentioned that only small amounts of byproducts from FA etherification or FFR acetalization with 2-propanol were formed due to the catalysis function of acid-base centers. Generally, the kinetics for transfer hydrogenation of FFR into FA can be described as a first-order reaction, then reaction rate constants (k) under different conditions are obtained through plotting –ln (1-x) vs time (shown in Fig. 13 ). As indicated in Table 2, reaction rate constants largely depended on the temperature, where k values increased significantly with the rise of temperature. According to the Arrhenius formula, the activation energy (Ea) in CTH of FFR with three ZrxByFeO catalysts was calculated from Fig. 14 . Calculated results demonstrated that Ea for FFR into FA over the selected magnetic catalysts was much lower, in which Ea value of 48.3 kJ/mol, 53.6 kJ/mol, and 50.5 kJ/mol was required for Zr1B3FeO, Zr3B1FeO, and Zr9B1FeO catalyst respectively. Compared with magnetic Zr/Fe catalysts without B modification from our previous work (Table 3 , Run 3, 4 and 5) (Gu et al., 2020), B doped magnetic zirconium catalysts exhibited high efficiency in transfer hydrogenation of FFR to selectively produce FA, in consideration of reaction condition, FA yield and Ea. Additionally, the obtained Ea in the present research was comparable or much lower than those reported in other literatures with similar H-transfer systems using various metallic catalysts such as Pd/Fe2O3 (Scholz et al., 2014), ZrPN (Li et al., 2016), NiFe2O4 (He et al., 2018), Zr-HPAA (Liu et al., 2019), and Cu/NbP (Fang, 2017). Thus, the B doped magnetic ZrxByFeO catalysts in this research showed potential application prospect in terms of catalytic activity, separation and reuse. In addition, the Zr1B3FeO catalyst also revealed good activity in the MPV reaction of HMF to BHMF, where 82.7% HMF conversion rate and 39.6% BHMF yield were achieved at 170 °C for 2 h (conditions: HMF 1.2 mmol, 2-propanol 15 mL, Zr1B3FeO 75 mg, N2 1 MPa, 600 rpm). To further evaluate the catalyst reusability, recycling experiments on the H-transfer reaction of FFR-to-FA were performed with Zr1B3FeO catalyst. Commonly, the used catalyst was separated using magnetic rotor and washed with ethanol and deionized water. Then the catalyst was dried at 105 °C overnight before reuse. From Fig. 15 , the Zr1B3FeO catalyst still maintained good activity for FFR-to-FA after multiple uses, where over 90% catalytic activity was still retained after 4 cycles. Minor decline in FA yield could presumably be ascribable to the adsorbed organic compounds (verified from TG analysis in Fig. 8), which might block the catalyst pore structures and delay the mass transfer. On this basis full contact between substrate FFR and acid-base centers would be restrained to some extent. Hence, future work on the catalyst regeneration remains to be a research priority. On the basis of experimental studies and reported literatures (Chuah et al., 2006; Graves et al., 2006; López-Asensio et al., 2018; Normand et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2018), plausible reaction mechanism for MPV reduction of FFR into FA over B doped magnetic zirconium catalysts in the presence of 2-propanol was presented, as clearly shown in Scheme 1 . As is well known, acid-base centers from as-prepared ZrxByFeO materials are found to play a critical role in FFR transformation in a H-transfer manner. It is noted that zirconium-based materials synthesized via calcination method still contained plentiful acid-base sites (unsaturated Zr4+–O2– pairs), meanwhile, much more L acid sites existed in calcined B2O3 samples. Therefore, two choices involving H-transfer from 2-propanol to aldehyde group of FFR molecule were proposed in the present research. The skeletal structures of active Zr/B species were illustrated as A and B in Scheme 1. Hydrogen source 2-propanol first adsorbed on the active A and B centers to form corresponding metal alkoxides (1) in step 1. Then substrate molecule FFR actively participated in the follow-up steps, in which aldehyde groups combined well with the generated metal alkoxides to form a cyclic six-membered transition state (2) via step 2. Hydrogen transfer proceeded in sequence among active FFR with metal alkoxides for both routes A and B, along with the formations of a series of transition states (3) and (4) in steps 3 and 4. Upon the above concerted processes, an important intermediate (5) was generated through step 5. In the following step 6, one molecule of FA was formed in the first place under the catalysis of acid-base sites (unsaturated Zr4+–O2– pairs) via the release of acetone molecule, along with intermediate (6) produced as well. Next, another 2-propanol molecule took part in the H-transfer reaction by forming intermediate (7) on active B species. As a result, hydrogen transfer process appeared for producing another molecule FA in step 8, with the release of acetone molecule again. Also noteworthy is that each step in the MPV reduction of FFR was reversible, according to the earlier reports (Bui et al., 2013; Cohen et al., 2004)."
9,Conclusions,"A series of B doped magnetic ZrxByFeO catalysts with adjustable acidity/basicity ratios were developed for the selective transfer hydrogenation of biomass-derived FFR into FA using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor and solvent. Proper acidity/basicity ratio in a range of 3.8 ~ 4.0 could obviously facilitate the FA formation in a H-transfer manner. Under optimal conditions, nearly 100% yield of FA could be achieved over Zr9B1FeO catalyst in 2 h. Whereas, Zr1B3FeO gave the lowest activation energy of 48.3 kJ/mol in FFR-to-FA transformation. The B doped magnetic catalysts had considerable activity and stability with the activity comparable with those of the previously reported metallic catalysts. Plausible reaction mechanism involving two main H-transfer paths for transfer hydrogenation of FFR into FA in the presence of acid-base Zr species and acidic B species was described."
