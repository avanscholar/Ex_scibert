0,Introduction,"Polyacrylonitrile fiber (PANF) is a multi-purpose polymer compound, which has good resistance to acids, oxidants and general organic solvents, but poor resistance to alkali [1]. At the same time, polyacrylonitrile has good mechanical strength and a large number of cyano and methyl ester groups are distributed on the surface, which can be used as the carrier of catalyst [2–6]. Based on the above characteristics, polyacrylonitrile has attracted more and more attention. At present, polyacrylonitrile fiber has been used in membrane, composite structure, energy storage and electronic devices and biomedicine [7–10]. In order to get PANF nanocomposites, researchers utilized a variety of technologies to modify the structure of polymer and fiber, which are used in a variety of reactions [11–13], and achieved good results. Heteropolyacid (HPA) is a kind of oxygen-containing polyacid, which is composed of heteroatoms and polyatoms through oxygen atom coordination bridging [14]. It has high redox ability and catalytic activity. It is a new multifunctional green catalyst with good stability [15]. It can be used in homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, and even as phase transfer catalyst. Among them, heteropolyacid compounds of tungsten and molybdenum series were found earlier, which can effectively oxidize a variety of organic compounds in homogeneous or two-phase systems with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant [16]. For example, epoxidation of olefins, oxidation of benzyl alcohol and phenol [17]. It is found that Keggin type phosphotungstic acid has better stability and catalytic oxidation activity than other types of phosphotungstic acid [18]. However, the wide solubility of phosphotungstic acid in solvent makes it difficult to recover after the reaction. Therefore, the immobilization of phosphotungstic acid on solid support has become the focus of research [19–21]. Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) is a kind of living/controlled radical polymerization (CRP) [22]. It is suitable for a wide range of monomers and is very conducive to the polymerization of olefin monomers with special functional groups [23]. In recent years, RAFT polymerization has been widely used to graft various active molecules onto catalyst supports, such as silica, carbon nanotubes, titanium dioxide and so on [24–27], and has been applied in sensors, surface coatings and biochemistry [28–30]. In consideration of only ca. 5% concentration of ester group in fiber for functional modification and based on RAFT polymerization, we combine the advantages of polymer through RAFT polymerization, which not only effectively improves the defect of insufficient functional sites on the fiber [31], but also inherits many advantages of PANF [32]. Thus, an intelligent catalyst supported on PANF was designed for the oxidation of alcohols. The photo-responsive SPA [33]and functional ionic liquid were loaded onto polyacrylonitrile by RAFT polymerization [34], and the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the catalyst were adjusted reversibly by UV light [35]. During the reaction, the catalyst is relatively hydrophobic and can absorb substrates. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was switched to a relatively hydrophilic state by ultraviolet light, and the product was desorbed from the catalyst surface. This process is green and clean, and the catalyst is readily to be recycled."

9,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows morphologies and distribution of PANF, PANF-NH2, PANF-NH2@DDMAT, PANF@SPA&VImBr, PANF@SPA&VImPW, PANF@SPA&VImPW-10. The initial PANF is bright and white (Fig. 1 a). When we ammonolize the methyl ester group on PANF with ethylenediamine (Scheme 1 , step 1), the color of the fiber gradually turns yellow and it's very hydrophilic (Fig. 1 b). Then, the primary amine on ethylenediamine is amidated with the carboxyl group on DDMAT, and DDMAT is loaded on PANF (Scheme 1, step 2). At this time, the color of fiber is slightly deepened and it change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic (Fig. 1 c). After further polymerization of imidazole salt and spiropyran (Scheme 1, step 3), the fiber turns dark yellow (Fig. 1 d), which may be caused by spiropyran loading. Finally, phosphotungstic acid is loaded on the fiber surface by using the principle of ion exchange (Scheme 1, step 4), and the fiber color turns white slightly (Fig. 1 e). In addition, after ten catalytic cycles, the color of the catalyst becomes lighter (Fig. 1 f). In general, it can be seen from the appearance that the catalyst maintains the state of fiber no matter in the synthesis or trial stage. (The mechanical properties test results are displayed in the table.S1) The surface structure of the catalyst was analyzed by infrared spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows Infrared spectrum of PANF-NH2, PANF-NH2@DDMAT, PANF@SPA&VImBr, PANF@SPA&VImPW. After amination of PANF, the absorption peaks of amide bond (1640 cm−1) and amino group (3380 cm−1) appear, and the absorption peaks of methyl carbonyl (1730 cm−1) and cyano (2240 cm−1) are retained (Fig. 2 a). After two-component polymerization (Fig. 2 c), there was a significant unsaturated C–H absorption peak (3100 cm−1), which was attributed to the benzene ring or imidazole group. At the same time, the absorption peak of ester carbonyl group is enhanced (1730 cm−1), which can also explain the successful loading of SPA. After phosphotungstate ion exchange, the infrared spectrum hardly changed (Fig. 2 d), but there were more absorption peaks of 810 cm−1 and 760 cm−1. It is attributed to the stretching vibration of two different W–O–W in WO6 octahedron. In addition, Keggin's characteristic P–O stretching vibration (1080 cm−1) is not well shown in the figure, and may be incorporated into the absorption peak of C–O–C antisymmetric stretching vibration (1100 cm−1). After 10 catalytic cycles, the carbonyl absorption peak of ester increased, while the absorption peak of active neutral phosphotungstic acid was still very obvious. We also characterized the catalyst by XPS. As shown in Fig. 3 a, we can observe the signals of W 4f (37 ev), P 2p (134 ev), Br 3d (69 ev), C 1s (285 eV), N 1s (400 eV) and O 1s (532 eV). Among them, the existence of Br− is caused by incomplete ion exchange. The two peaks of W4f shown in Fig. 2 b correspond to W6 + (W4f7/2 and W4f5/2), and their bonding energies are 36.49 eV and 38.54 eV respectively. This shows that Keggin type phosphotungstic acid anion is successfully modified on the surface of the fiber. By thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermal stability of PANF-NH2, PANF-NH2@DDMAT, PANF@SPA&VImBr, PANF@SPA&VImPW was investigated (Fig. 4 ). The fiber shows good thermal stability below 200 °C. The decomposition mainly occurred at 500–600 °C. It is worth noting that the fiber catalyst grafted with phosphotungstic acid has the most residual mass compared with other modified fibers, mainly because some elements in phosphotungstic acid can't be lost into the air after being oxidized at high temperature. Fig. 5 shows SEM images of PANF, PANF-NH2, PANF-NH2@DDMAT, PANF@SPA &VImBr, PANF@SPA&VImPW. The surface of the original PANF is smooth (Fig. 5 a), and cracks appear on the surface of the fiber after amination (Fig. 5 b). After carrying DDMAT, the crack deepens (Fig. 5 c). After polymerization of SPA and 3-ethyl-1-vinylimidazole bromide, we observed that some cracks were filled up (Fig. 5 d), which proved that the polymerization took place. Finally, after the ion exchange of phosphotungstic acid, obvious particles appear on the surface of the fiber, and cement like substances cover the surface of the fiber (Fig. 5 e). In addition, it is worth noting that after a series of modification, the integrity of the fiber has not been affected. The 13C NMR spectra of PANF@SPA&VImBr are depicted in Fig. 6 .The peak of 25.87 ppm belongs to the main chain of fiber, and the peak of 115.92 ppm belongs to cyano and carbon on some benzene rings. 168.99 ppm is attributed to ester carbonyl and amide carbonyl produced by modification. Finally, 195.86 ppm belongs to carbon sulfur groups and ketone carbonyls produced by side reactions. At the same time, in order to study the loading capacity of catalyst active groups, the content of Br was firstly determined as 0.27 mmol g−1 (Table 1 , entry 1) by ICP. Because the ratio of imidazole to bromine was the same, it can be calculated that the loading capacity of 3-ethyl-1-vinylimidazole bromide was also 0.27 mmol g−1. Then we measured the P content of PANF@SPA&VImPW (Table 1, entry 2), and deduced that the carrying capacity of the active group HxPW12O40 (3−x) - was 0.063 mmol g−1. In addition, combined with the solid-state NMR and ICP test results, we can roughly calculate the carrying capacity of SPA, which was about 0.133 mmol g−1. For the specific process, please refer to the supporting information (Fig. S4). In order to research the catalytic performance of the catalyst, we explored the reaction conditions using benzyl alcohol as model substrate. Firstly, we studied the catalysts with different molar ratios (Table 2 entries 1–3). It was found that the conversion and selectivity increased with the increase of the proportion of imidazole salt. The proportion of phosphotungstic acid in the active center may increase due to the increase of the proportion of imidazole salt. Then we studied the reaction time (Table 2 entries 4–8) and found that the conversion increased with the increase of reaction time. When we increase the reaction time to 8h, the conversion can be increased to 95%, but the selectivity is only 76%. Then we explored the reaction temperature (Table 2 entries 9–11). When the reaction temperature was 70 °C, the selectivity was as high as 94%, but the conversion was only 65%. But as the temperature exceeds 90 °C, it reaches 100 °C, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol continues to increase, while the selectivity of benzaldehyde decreases, which may be the result of the side reaction between the product benzaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide under the catalysis of acid to produce benzoic acid. Then we explored the amount of catalyst (Table 2 entries 12–14). It was found that when the catalyst increased to 30 mg, the conversion was the highest, but the selectivity would be relatively reduced. This may be because of benzaldehyde was further oxidation of benzoic acid catalyst. Therefore, we set the optimum conditions at 90 °C, 6 h reaction time and 20 mg catalyst. In order to further study the catalytic performance of the catalyst on different substrates, we also studied the oxidation performance of the catalyst on 2-phenylethanol, cyclohexanol, phenylethanol, n-hexanol, diphenyl methanol, p-fluorobenzyl alcohol, p-methoxybenzyl alcohol and p-methylbenzyl alcohol. It can be seen from the table that the catalyst has good oxidation capacity for benzyl hydroxyl (Table 3 entries 1, 5, 6, 8), and the conversion rate is more than 70%. However, the oxidation capacity of fatty alcohols and non benzyl alcohols is poor (Table 3 entries 3, 4), less than 6%. It is worth noting that the conversion rate of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol is very high, but there are many side reactions in the reaction process, resulting in a series of impurities. Therefore, its selectivity is very low. Fig. 7 demonstrates the water contact angle of PANF@SPA&VImBr and PANF@SPA&VImPW and the change after UV irradiation. The water contact angle of PANF@SPA&VImBr is 114.8° (Fig. 7 a). Because the surface is covered with spiropyran and some RAFT reagents, the hydrophobicity of PANF@SPA&VImBr is relatively high. The water contact angle changed from 114.8° to 104.7° after UV irradiation for 1 min (Fig. 7 b). The water contact angle of PANF@SPA&VImPW is 107.7° after ion exchange (Fig. 7 c). Compared with PANF@SPA&VImBr, the hydrophilicity is slightly increased, which may be due to the partial hydrolysis of spiropyran during ion exchange. After 1 min of UV irradiation, the water contact angle changes from 107.7° to 96.4° (Fig. 7 d). The results show that spiropyran is successfully supported on the fiber surface and the catalyst has a certain photo-responsiveness. In order to verify that fiber catalyst has, to some extent, the switching property of adsorption and desorption function via UV-light, we designed an experiment to test the light-sensitive behavior of the functionalized fiber. We prepared ethyl acetate solutions of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde respectively. The experimental method refers to the supporting information (Fig. S5). Firstly, the adsorption capacity of the catalyst for benzyl alcohol is investigated. Fig. 8 a and b show the absorbance changes before and after catalyst adsorption. Taking the maximum absorption wavelength of 258 nm (benzene ring absorption peak) as an example, after catalyst adsorption, the absorbance decreased from 0.133 (Fig. 8 a) to 0.113 (Fig. 8 b). Then we investigated the desorption ability of the catalyst to the product. Results as shown in Fig. 8 c and d, taking the maximum absorption wavelength of 255 nm (benzene ring absorption peak) as an example, after UV irradiation and desorption,the absorbance increased from 2.886 (Fig. 8 c) to 3.016 (Fig. 8 d) after UV irradiation. Summary, it can conclude that there is an obvious concentration vibration before and after adsorption and desorption, which can prove that the catalyst has a certain adsorption and desorption ability by tuning the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the catalyst. Thus, mechanism of the oxidation reaction using light-responsive fiber catalyst was proposed (Scheme 2 ). Firstly, because a large number of hydrophobic groups are immobilized on the surface of the crude fiber, a hydrophobic microenvironment is formed on the surface. Benzaldehyde is formed when benzyl alcohol is attacked by the active species {PO4 [WO (O2) 2] 4} 3 − transformed from phosphotungstic acid [36]. Due to the relatively hydrophobic environment on the fiber surface, part of benzaldehyde will be adsorbed, so as to reduce the residence time of the product in the aqueous phase, further reduce the progress of side reactions and improve the selectivity of the reaction. After the reaction, the spiropyran ring is opened by ultraviolet light, resulting in the increase of hydrophilicity of the microenvironment, and the product is eliminated from the reaction solution. After a period of natural light irradiation, spiropyran returns to the ring closing state, and the surface microenvironment returns to the relatively hydrophobic state, which can be directly put into the next reaction. We made a preliminary comparison with other PW based and metal catalysts, such as (PW12)3/MCM-48 [37], PW-NH2-ILSBA-15 [38] and FeAPO-5 [39](Table 4 ). Obviously, the catalytic efficiency of PANF@SPA&VImPW is higher than (PW12)3/MCM-48 and FeAPO-5, and only lower molar ratio is required. It is worth noting that although the catalytic efficiency of PW-NH2-ILSBA-15 is high, up to 83%, it also needs a higher catalyst loading. Moreover, the fiber supported catalyst with phase transfer function can effectively improve the utilizing efficiency of H2O2. In addition, in order to further investigate the recoverability and recycling performance of the catalyst, we enlarged the scale of benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. Fix the fiber catalyst on the stirring paddle (Fig. 9) and let the reaction proceed in a three neck flask. When the reaction is over, irradiate with ultraviolet light and stir at the same time to fully release the product. The reaction solution is separated, and the residue can be directly used for the next cycle. As presented in Fig. 10 , after several cycles, the catalytic yield (79%–70%) and reaction activity of the catalyst remained good. Moreover, we conducted different post-treatment for the first, fifth and ninth cycles, and analyzed the reaction solutions before and after UV irradiation and ethyl acetate extraction (Fig. 10). We found that the yield difference before and after UV irradiation reached 4%–7%. At the same time, after ethyl acetate extraction, the yield could be increased by 1%–2% on the previous basis. Considering the balance between the harmfulness brought by the introduction of organic solvent and product yield, the smart fiber catalyst at the presented operational conditions is the best choice for the oxidation reactions. The results in accordance with Fig. 8 that the catalyst is photo-sensitive and can finely regulate adsorption/desorption performance."
10,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have developed a new phosphotungstic acid functionalized smart polyacrylonitrile catalyst. Because of the introduction of RAFT polymerization, the fiber supported poly (ionic liquid)s have large catalytic active sites. During reaction stage, the catalysts present the property of hydrophobicity, which is beneficial to adsorb organic substrate. When the reaction was completed, the catalysts demonstrate relatively hydrophobic in the presence of ultraviolet light. The less hydrophobic microenvironment facilitates the production desorption from the surface of the catalyst. The switchness between relatively hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the catalyst is reversible. The fiber supported catalysts with ionic moiety could achieve the oxidation products in good to excellent yields in most cases. Amazingly, the whole process, including reaction and work-up stage, is organic solvent-free, indicating its characteristic of environmental benign. In addition, the catalyst could be reused for 10 times without any significant loss of catalytic activity, and be easily scaled up to gram scale through twinning the fiber to the impeller, indicating the potential in the industrial field in the near future."
