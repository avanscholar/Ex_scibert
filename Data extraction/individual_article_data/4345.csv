0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly oxidant with water as its only byproduct; it is extensively used in the chemical industry and for environmental remediation [1]. Currently, H2O2 is industrially synthesized by a multi-step anthraquinone oxidation process, which requires high energy consumption and generates substantial organic waste [2,3]. Furthermore, this process can only be performed in a centralized factory; the subsequent hazardous storage and transportation of H2O2 limit its downstream applications. Substantial efforts, therefore, have been made to develop an efficient and in situ synthesis route for H2O2. Among these, an electrochemical route for H2O2 generation, through the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), has attracted considerable attention because of its environmental friendliness and low energy consumption [4,5]. In particular, efficient on-site electrochemical generation of H2O2 is important for the H2O2-based electro-Fenton (EF) process, which promotes the formation of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) to directly degrade organic pollutants [6,7]. Cathode catalytic material is the key issue for the electrochemical generation of H2O2 [2,3]. In this respect, metal-free, carbon-based materials are of great interest to researchers because they are highly tunable and electrochemically stable under the reaction conditions [2,8]. Typically, 3D carbon-based materials such as carbon/graphite felts or reticulated vitreous carbon have been widely used as cathodes [9–11]. Various functionalization strategies, e.g., surface modification, heteroatom doping, and activity species loading, have been developed to tailor the cathode activity and selectivity for two-electron ORR [9–14]. The physicochemical properties of cathode, such as the intrinsic conductivity, the specific surface area, and the electrochemical activity, are the foundation of efficient H2O2 synthesis. In this regard, the intrinsic properties of these existing carbon-based cathodes are usually moderate, which significantly limit further improvement in the performance of electrochemical H2O2 generation. Thus, development of a novel and versatile carbon-based cathode represents a potential approach in the efficient electrochemical generation of H2O2. Furthermore, identifying catalytic active sites and then modifying the cathode with active species are critical for efficient H2O2 synthesis [15–17]. A representative example is the participation of active oxygen functional groups on oxidized carbon materials in the electrochemical ORR to generate H2O2. These oxygen functional groups are believed to modify the surface properties of carbon materials and even serve as the surface-active sites for the reaction [12,15,18,19]. Several oxygen-containing groups, such as carbonyl, carboxyl, and ether, have been proposed as favorable active sites in the two-electron ORR process [20–23]. Multiple chemical and electrochemical oxidation methods have been adopted to tailor the content of oxygen functional groups on carbon-based cathodes [12,19,21]. However, it is still unclear which species is the crucial factor in the two-electron ORR process, and the modification of cathodes with targeted active functional groups is still challenging. All of these essentially hinder the further design and development of functionalized carbon-based cathodes for the efficient generation of H2O2. Herein, a 3D reduced graphene oxide synthetic fabric (rGOSF) cathode with a hierarchical structure and abundant active sites is fabricated via a wet-fusing assembly of graphene oxide (GO) staple fibers. The oxygen functional groups on the rGOSF cathode are directionally modulated by a multi-step reduction strategy, and their catalytic activity in ORR to H2O2 is quantitatively analyzed. The contribution of carboxyl groups to the two-electron ORR is confirmed by performing a series of comparison experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, carbonyl- and carboxyl-rich functional molecules are selected and co-spun with a GO dispersion to construct a functionalized rGOSF. The obtained carboxyl-modified rGOSF cathode exhibits significantly enhanced two-electron ORR activity. Furthermore, using a homogeneous EF process, the removal efficiency of functionalized rGOSF cathodes on typical aqueous refractory organic pollutants is investigated. The carboxyl-modified rGOSF cathode efficiently removed bisphenol A (BPA), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and rhodamine B (RhB) pollutants."
1,Experimental and computational methods,
2,Preparation of rGOSF and its derivatives,"2.1 Preparation of rGOSF and its derivatives The chemicals and materials used in this study are reported in the Supporting Information. Graphite oxide was synthesized from −100 mesh flake graphite using a modified Hummers method as described in previous works [24,25]. After high-speed centrifugation of the obtained neutral graphite oxide suspension at 9000 rpm for 20 min, the collected surface gel was classified as a single-layer GO dispersion. The statistical average lateral size of GO sheets was ∼15 μm (Fig. S1). A liquid crystal (LC) phase GO dispersion with a concentration of 12 mg mL−1 was obtained by vacuum rotary evaporation of the aforementioned single-layer GO dispersion. Distinctive Schlieren textures were observed for the GO LC dispersion using a polarized optical microscope (Fig. S2). The rGOSF cathode was fabricated by wet-spinning and wet-fusing assembly of GO staple fibers [26,27]. In particular, 8 mL of GO LC aqueous dispersion (12 mg mL−1) was injected into a rotating ethanol coagulation bath using a spinning needle (with an inside diameter of 340 μm). The length of GO gel staple fibers was controlled at ∼15 mm by adjusting the rotating speed of the coagulation bath. To complete the solvents exchange process, the obtained GO gel staple fibers were maintained for 0.5 h, and then vacuum filtered to form a loose filter cake. After drying at room temperature overnight, a GO synthetic fabric (GOSF) with loose and porous structure was obtained. The GOSF was reduced to rGOSF in a mixture of HI and acetic acid (1:1 in volume) at 60 °C for 8 h, and then repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove residual impurities. To fabricate rGOSF with specific oxygen functional groups, secondary thermal or chemical reduction procedures were conducted for the as-constructed HI-treated rGOSF. In the secondary thermal reduction process, rGOSF was annealed to 350 °C or 1000 °C at 5 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere for 1 h, and the obtained sample was marked as rGOSF–350 °C or rGOSF–1000 °C. For the secondary chemical reduction process, rGOSF was treated in an aqueous solution of 30 mL NaBH4 (10 mg mL−1) at 80 °C for 1 h, and then treated in concentrated H2SO4 at 120 °C for 2 h. The obtained sample was marked as rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4. To modify rGOSF with specific oxygen functional groups, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) were selected as the carbonyl- and carboxyl-rich functional molecules, respectively, and then co-spun with GO LC dispersions to develop a functionalized rGOSF. In a typical procedure, to ensure the complete dissolution of PTCDA/PTCA, 0.01 mmol PTCDA/PTCA was added into 8 mL GO LC aqueous dispersion (12 mg mL−1) and stirred for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the mixture was wet-spun and wet-fused after the abovementioned procedure to form carbonyl or carboxyl-modified rGOSF, and the samples were then marked as rGOSF (CO) or rGOSF (O–CO). The physicochemical properties characterization of rGOSF cathodes can be found in the Supporting Information."
3,Electrochemical generation of H2O2,"2.2 Electrochemical generation of H2O2 Electrocatalytic H2O2 generation experiments were performed in a 150 mL undivided reactor with rGOSF (with a diameter of 25 mm) as the cathode, Pt foil (20 mm × 20 mm) as the anode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The distance between the anode and cathode was 30 mm. An aqueous solution of Na2SO4 (50 mM) was used as the supporting electrolyte, and the pH of the electrolyte was adjusted by aqueous solutions of H2SO4 or NaOH. Oxygen gas was fed into the solution at a flow rate of 0.4 L min−1 to generate H2O2. The H2O2 yield was spectrophotometrically determined by the iodide method (more details are reported in the Supporting Information) [28,29], and the unit of mg cm−2 was adopted to better reflects the generation of H2O2 per unit area of carbon-based cathodes. The current efficiency (CE) for H2O2 generation, defined as the number of electrons consumed for H2O2 production to the total number of electrons passed through the cathode, was calculated by Eq. (1) [28]. (1) C E = n F C H 2 O 2 V ∫ 0 t I d t × 100 % where n = 2 is the number of electrons transferred for O2 reduction to H2O2, F is the Faraday constant (96486 C mol−1), C H2O2 is the concentration of H2O2 (mol L−1), V is the electrolyte volume (L), I is the current intensity (A), and t is the reaction time (s). Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE, Pine Instruments, USA) measurements were performed to test the ORR activity of rGO catalysts with different oxygen functional groups. At a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and a rotation speed of 1600 rpm, the two-electron ORR activity of catalysts was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from −1.0 V to 0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in O2-saturated Na2SO4 solution. During the LSV measurement, the Pt ring potential was maintained at 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The H2O2 selectivity was then calculated by Eq. (2) [30], (2) H 2 O 2 ( % ) = 200 × I r / N I d + I r / N where I d is the disk current (mA), I r is the ring current (mA), and N is the collection efficient (0.37). More details about working electrode preparation can be found in the Supporting Information."
4,Pollutant degradation by homogeneous EF process,"2.3 Pollutant degradation by homogeneous EF process The homogeneous EF process was performed in the same apparatus using BPA, SMX, and RhB as model pollutants (initial concentration of 50 mg L−1), and 50 mM of Na2SO4 was added as the supporting electrolyte. The applied potential for the EF process was −1.0 V, the solution pH was adjusted to 3 by an aqueous solution of H2SO4, and 0.2 mM Fe2+ (FeSO4·7H2O) was added to the degradation system as a homogeneous Fenton catalyst. The concentrations of the three model pollutants were analyzed by UV–visible spectrophotometer or high-performance liquid chromatography, and the test conditions are listed in the Supporting Information. The removal efficiencies of BPA, SMX, and RhB were calculated using Eq. (3), (3) η = C 0 − C t C 0 × 100 % where C 0 is the initial concentration of pollutants (50 mg L−1), and C t is the concentration of pollutants when sampling at time t. The degradation of BPA with different cathodes was evaluated using the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant (k). Total organic carbon (TOC) was determined on an Elementar vario TOC analyzer to illustrate mineralization extent during pollutant degradation. Mineralization current efficiency (MCE) was calculated by Eq. (4) [31,32], (4) M C E = n F V Δ ( T O C ) exp 4.32 × 10 7 m I t × 100 % where n = 72 is the number of electrons transferred from the mineralization of BPA, F is the Faraday constant, V is the bulk volume (L), Δ(TOC)exp is the experimental TOC decay (mg L−1), 4.32 × 107 is the conversion factor (3600 s h−1 × 12000 mg mol−1), m = 15 is the number of carbon atoms in BPA, I is applied current (A), and t is the electrolysis time (h)."
5,Computational method,"2.4 Computational method The plane-wave DFT was calculated using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [33]. The electron-ion interactions were presented by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [34], and the Kohn–Sham equation was solved through the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the parametrization of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [35]. The plane wave base energy cutoff of 500 eV was used to achieve tight convergence. While calculating the adsorption behavior, the convergence criteria of energy and force were set as 1 × 10−5 eV/atom and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. For calculations, to avoid periodic interactions, the structure was modeled as one layer and a vacuum region of 15 Å was employed in the Z-direction. To model the oxygen functional groups on the basal plane of the carbon skeleton, a 6 × 5 supercell with a grid of 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack K points was adopted. To model the oxygen functional groups at the edge of the carbon skeleton, a 6 × 5 supercell with a grid of 1 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack K points was used."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Constructing the 3D rGOSF cathodes,"3.1 Constructing the 3D rGOSF cathodes To avoid the physicochemical property restrictions of existing carbon-based cathode materials, 3D graphene non-woven synthetic fabric was used for the first time as the cathode. Fig. 1 a shows the fabrication procedure of the non-woven rGOSF cathode, including the following three primary steps: wet-spinning of GO LC dispersion, wet-fusing assembly of GO staple fibers into fabric, and chemical reduction of GOSF. During wet-spinning of the GO LC dispersion, GO sheets transformed from locally lamellar ordered LC phase to oriented alignment along the resultant fiber axis with the extrusion forces of the spinning pipe [26,36]. The length of staple fibers could be controlled at ∼15 mm by adjusting the rotation speed of the ethanol coagulation bath. To form a non-woven fabric, the gel state of GO fibers can be fused, and strong inter-fiber bonding was generated during filtration and subsequent drying [26,27]. For electron transfer, the wet-fusing assembly of GO fibers effectively avoids the interface resistance, which is vastly different from traditional carbon-based fabric cathodes made with individual fibers (Fig. S3). After chemical reduction, most surface oxygen-containing groups on GOSF were removed and the conjugated π–π structure of graphene sheets was repaired; therefore, the obtained macroscopic material was stable in an aqueous electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 1b, the obtained rGOSF cathode has a diameter of ∼25 mm and a loose and porous macroscopic morphology, comprising 30-μm-sized diameter fibers forming an interconnected network with an inter-fiber distance of ∼200 μm (Fig. 1c and d). Obvious wrinkled microstructures spread on the fiber surface, which could effectively increase the three-phase reaction interface for electrochemical ORR. The inter-fiber network, randomly oriented fibers, and fine wrinkled substructures on the fibers collectively constitute the structural hierarchy of rGOSF from macro-to nanoscale. Furthermore, many fused junctions between fibers were observed, which could provide conductive paths for electrons by eliminating the contact resistance and effectively improve the mechanical strength of the cathode. The specific electrical conductivity of rGOSF is 572 S m−1 (Fig. S4), nearly three times that of commercially available graphite felt electrode (∼200 S m−1). Fig. 1e shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of rGOSF; moreover, the Type IV adsorption behavior could be identified. In the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the steep uptake at low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.1) is indicative of a large number of micropores (<2 nm) within the fibers; however, the hysteresis loop located at 0.4 < P/P0 < 1 demonstrates the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm) [37,38]. The measured Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of rGOSF is 84.5 m2 g−1, higher than that of existing 3D carbon-based cathode materials. To quantify the pore size distribution of rGOSF, nonlocal density function theory (NLDFT) was used to analyze the size distribution of micropores, and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was used to analyze the size distribution of mesopores (Fig. 1f). The results demonstrated the coexistence of micropore and mesopore structures on rGOSF. For the ORR process, micropores could provide abundant catalytic active sites, and mesopores could serve as gas transfer channels to supply oxygen [39,40]. Thus, the hierarchical rGOSF with porous microstructure is a potential active cathode material for electrochemical ORR applications."
8,Identifying active oxygen functional groups for two-electron ORR,"3.2 Identifying active oxygen functional groups for two-electron ORR Previous studies have completely demonstrated the importance of oxygen functional groups for the activity and selectivity of the two-electron ORR route; however, the catalytically active sites on oxidized carbon materials still remain controversial [20–23]. To identify the contribution of specific oxygen functional groups in the two-electron ORR process, a series of rGOSF cathodes with different oxygen functional groups were designed and fabricated based on the secondary reduction strategy as described in Section 2.1. Because different oxygen functional groups have their own thermal decomposition behaviors, differential annealing may be a feasible method to tailor oxygen functional groups. As shown by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of GOSF (Fig. 2 a), the labile C–O functional groups, e.g., hydroxyl, epoxide, and organosulfate, were completely removed as the annealing temperature increased from room temperature to ∼300 °C [41,42]. CO functional groups, i.e., carbonyl and carboxyl, are thermodynamically stable oxygen-containing groups and have higher decomposition temperatures than the C–O functional groups [42,43]. With additional increase of the GOSF annealing temperature, continuous mass loss takes place with small steps from ∼300 °C to 1000 °C, corresponding to the progressive decomposition of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. Thus, by differential annealing treatments, both C–O and CO functional groups could be targeted for removal. The only difference between the thermal decomposition behaviors of GOSF and rGOSF is the mass losses of C–O functional groups, indicating that HI reduction treatment could remove most labile C–O functional groups while effectively retaining CO functional groups. To target the removal of carbonyl or carboxyl groups, NaBH4 and H2SO4 two-step reduction strategy was adopted. As confirmed by Gao et al., NaBH4 reduction almost completely remove the carbonyl groups on the edge and defect sites of GO sheets while effectively retaining the carboxyl groups. In concentrated H2SO4, an additional high-temperature dehydration treatment could completely remove the small residual amount of hydroxyl groups on NaBH4-treated rGOSF (Fig. 2b) [43]. Therefore, the type of oxygen functional groups on rGOSF could be regulated by combinations of the abovementioned reduction methods. Thus, based on the abovementioned multi-step reduction strategy, four types of rGOSF were fabricated, i.e., HI-reduced rGOSF, rGOSF–350 °C, rGOSF–1000 °C, and rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4. The atomic fractions of elemental compositions of these rGOSF cathodes were quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2c). Compared with unreduced GOSF (Fig. S5), HI reduction treatment results in removing multiple C–O functional groups; however, the content of carbonyl and carboxyl groups essentially remains unchanged. After annealing at 350 °C, the atomic fraction of C–O functional groups on rGOSF decreased from 18.22% to 11.84% (with a relative standard deviation of 1.78% and 1.47%, respectively, as shown in Fig. S6), indicating the effective removal of residual C–O functional groups. By increasing the annealing temperature to 1000 °C, the atomic fractions of carbonyl and carboxyl groups demonstrate a substantial decrease. The obtained rGOSF–1000 °C resembles a non-woven pure graphene synthetic fabric without any oxygen functional groups. For NaBH4- and concentrated H2SO4-treated rGOSF, the atomic fractions of C–O functional groups and carbonyl are decreased compared to those of initial rGOSF, indicating the effective deoxygenation and dehydration effects of two-step reduction processes. Furthermore, the atomic fraction of carboxyl groups on rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 demonstrates a slight increase, which can be attributed to the conversion of five- and six-membered lactol rings or the ester of a tertiary alcohol structure to carboxyl groups [43]. Thus, rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 can be considered as a reduced product that only contains carboxyl groups. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the four types of rGOSF also verified the chemical composition evolution during the multistep reduction processes (Fig. 2d). After secondary reduction treatments (rGOSF–350 °C, rGOSF–1000 °C, and rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4), significant decreases in peak intensities can be observed for the C–O vibration (1107 cm−1), C–O–C vibration (1257 cm−1), and C–OH vibration (1400 cm−1), confirming the secondary reduction of the residual C–O functional groups. Furthermore, the CO stretching vibration (1727 cm−1) disappeared for the FTIR spectra of rGOSF–1000 °C, which indicates the efficient removal of CO functional groups. Therefore, using the abovementioned multi-step reduction processes, non-woven rGOSF cathodes with specific oxygen functional groups were successfully fabricated. Because the sp3-C bonds and structural defects of carbon materials were also reported as the active sites for electrochemical ORR to generate H2O2 [10,38], the four types of rGOSF were further characterized by Raman spectroscopy to analyze the evolution of the structural defects during the secondary reduction processes. As shown in Fig. 2e, the samples of rGOSF, rGOSF–350 °C, and rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 have similar defect extent with intensity ratios of D band to G band (ID:IG) in the range of 1.32–1.35. However, rGOSF–1000 °C possesses significantly increased structural defects, with an ID:IG of 1.56, indicating that most of the oxygen functional groups were removed as CO and/or CO2 species and, correspondingly, many structural defects are left in the sample [44,45]. ORR to H2O2 performance of as-constructed rGOSF cathodes with specific oxygen functional groups was evaluated using a three-electrode system in O2-saturated electrolyte (Fig. 3 a and b). Due to the decomposition of H2O2 caused by some parasitic reactions (e.g., spontaneous disproportionation of H2O2 to oxygen), both the H2O2 accumulation rate and current efficiency decrease with reaction time for all rGOSF cathodes. For the HI-reduced rGOSF cathode, the average H2O2 production rate was estimated to be 4.78 mg h−1 cm−2, with a current efficiency of 57.97% in the first hour. Both the H2O2 production rate and current efficiency of the rGOSF cathode were significantly higher than that of traditional 3D carbon-based cathodes (Fig. S7). The primary reason is excellent conductivity and special porous microstructure of non-woven rGOSF, in addition to the completely exposed active sites on the surface of the synthetic fabric [9,15,46]. After annealing at 350 °C, the resultant H2O2 electrogeneration rate and current efficiency were consistent with the initial rGOSF cathode, excluding the catalytic activity of C–O functional groups such as hydroxyl and epoxide on the two-electron ORR route. For the rGOSF–1000 °C cathode, both the electrochemical H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency present considerable attenuation compared with the initial rGOSF, demonstrating that the active species in catalyzing ORR to H2O2 is probably caused by carbonyl or carboxyl groups. Meanwhile, the significantly decreased current efficiency of the rGOSF–1000 °C cathode also demonstrates that the primary active sites come from oxygen functional groups, rather than from the structural defects on rGOSF. To identify the active role of carbonyl and carboxyl groups, the ORR performance of the rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 cathode was investigated. The estimated average H2O2 production rate for the rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 cathode is 5.59 mg h−1 cm−2, with a current efficiency of 63.94% in the first hour, both of which were higher than that of the initial rGOSF. Thus, the removal of carbonyl groups on rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 has no negative effect on the ORR to H2O2, and the catalytic activity of carboxyl groups can be identified. Furthermore, the higher content of carboxyl groups on the rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 cathode contributed to the improved H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency. The improved current efficiency of the rGOSF–NaBH4–H2SO4 cathode also eliminates the adverse effect of increased electrical conductivity on the deterioration of two-electron ORR activity seen for the rGOSF–1000 °C cathode (Fig. S8). The ORR activity of rGO catalysts with specific oxygen functional groups was investigated by measuring the polarization curves with RRDE technique (50 mM Na2SO4, pH∼7); Fig. 3c shows the results. The rGO catalysts have typical sigmoidal polarization curves with rapidly increasing ring currents (top) and disk currents (bottom) until diffusion-limited currents are reached at −0.45 V [47]. With additional decrease of applied potential, the ring currents gradually stabilized while the disk currents continued to increase, indicating the progressive transformation of ORR from the two-electron to four-electron route. As per the disk currents and ring currents of rGO catalysts at different applied potentials, H2O2 selectivity was calculated (Fig. 3d). Both the initial rGO and its 350 °C annealed product possess similar catalytic activity with H2O2 selectivity higher than 61.4% at all applied potentials. After annealing at 1000 °C, the H2O2 selectivity of rGO sharply attenuates, consistent with the H2O2 generation results in Fig. 3a and b. In comparison, NaBH4- and H2SO4-treated rGO catalysts exhibited the highest H2O2 selectivity, with a value higher than 71.6% in the investigated applied potential range, significantly superior to that of rGO and its annealed product. All these results collectively indicate that the active sites for two-electron ORR are derived from carboxyl groups and that the oxygen reduction activity could be modulated by tailoring the content of carboxyl groups on rGO catalysts or oxidized carbon materials."
9,DFT calculations,"3.3 DFT calculations To obtain atomistic insights into the contribution of different oxygen functional groups on the two-electron ORR route, DFT calculation was used to study their catalytic activity. A 2D graphene sheet was developed as the benchmark model and different oxygen functional groups were introduced at different locations on the graphene plane. In particular, a hydroxyl group was introduced on the basal plane of the graphene sheet, and carbonyl and carboxyl groups were introduced at the edge of the graphene sheet with armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) configurations (Fig. 4 a). The blue dashed circles in Fig. 4a show the calculated carbon active sites for the pure graphene sheet and different oxygen functional groups. For the two-electron ORR process, an O2 molecule first adsorbs on the carbon skeleton and then reduces to OOH∗ via a hydrogenation reaction (Eq. (5)). The second electron transfer results in the reduction of OOH∗ and the generation of HO2 − (Eq. (6)) [3,21,22]. (5) O2 + H2O + e– → OOH∗ + OH− (6) OOH∗ + e– → HO2 − Thus, in the two-electron ORR process, the generation and transformation of intermediate OOH∗ play crucial roles. It has been accepted that the catalytic activities of different structures are determined by the adsorption energies of the ORR intermediates to the active sites. Thus, the adsorption energy of OOH∗ (ΔG OOH∗) was selected as the descriptor to reflect the catalytic activity of the pure graphene sheet and different oxygen functional groups [2,5,48]. The limiting potential, U L, defined as the lowest potential at which the reaction steps in Eqs. (5) and (6) are downhill in free energy, was used as the indicator of activity toward ORR to H2O2. The theoretical overpotential is defined as the maximum difference between the limiting potential and the thermodynamic equilibrium potential (U o = 0.7 V). Fig. 4b shows the calculated limiting potential as a function of ΔG OOH∗ for the two-electron ORR process of the pure graphene plane and different oxygen functional groups. In theory, an ideal catalyst structure should have a ΔG OOH∗ of 4.22 (±0.1) eV to minimize the restriction of the oxygen hydrogenation reaction and the OOH∗ reduction reaction. The results in Fig. 4b indicate that the pure graphene sheet and hydroxyl, carbonyl (ZZ and AC), and carboxyl (AC) groups all do not have a significant contribution to the two-electron ORR with the calculated overpotentials all higher than 0.3 V. The carboxyl group (ZZ) yields an overpotential of only 0.07 V, demonstrating its high catalytic activity for the two-electron ORR route. The calculated overpotential of O–CO (ZZ) is comparable with or even lower than that of reported PtHg4 and Ag3Pt, noble metal alloy catalysts [2]. This indicates the potential activity enhancement effect of carboxyl-modified, metal-free, carbon-based cathodes for H2O2 electrosynthesis."
10,Modification of rGOSF with specific active groups for efficient H2O2 generation,"3.4 Modification of rGOSF with specific active groups for efficient H2O2 generation The abundant surface oxygen functional groups and the layer-by-layer assembly structure of rGOSF collectively contribute to the versatility of the novel cathode. To form a functionalized cathode, a typical feature of rGOSF cathodes is that the active species can be modified between the graphene sheets by the dissolution of functional molecules in the GO LC dispersion and wet co-spinning assembly [49]. To confirm the active sites of rGOSF and tailor the electrocatalytic activity of the cathode for ORR to H2O2, PTCDA and PTCA were selected as carbonyl- and carboxyl-rich functional molecules, respectively. By dissolution of PTCDA or PTCA molecules in GO LC dispersion, carbonyl- or carboxyl-functionalized non-woven rGOSF cathodes could be constructed via wet co-spinning (Fig. 5 a and b). Because PTCDA and PTCA molecules form noncovalent bonds with GO sheets to uniformly stack on the surface [50,51], the addition of PTCDA and PTCA has no effect on the LC phase behavior of the GO dispersion or on the microstructure of synthetic fabrics. Surface and cross-section SEM images of PTCDA- and PTCA-modified rGOSF also demonstrate that the addition of a small amount of functional molecules has negligible effects on the microstructure of rGOSF (Fig. S9). XPS results confirmed the effective modification of carbonyl or carboxyl groups on the rGOSF cathode (Fig. 5c and d). For the PTCDA-modified rGOSF (CO), the atomic fraction of carbonyl groups increased by 4.97% (from 6.63% for rGOSF to 11.60% for PTCDA-modified rGOSF). For the PTCA-modified rGOSF (O–CO), the atomic fraction of carboxyl groups increased by 2.95% (from 5.72% for rGOSF to 8.67% for PTCA-modified rGOSF). Raman spectra results of rGOSF (CO) and rGOSF (O–CO) also excluded the introduction of structural defects by PTCDA or PTCA modification (Fig. S10). The electrochemical H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency of initial rGOSF, rGOSF (CO), and rGOSF (O–CO) cathodes were investigated to compare the catalytic activity of specific oxygen functional groups on the two-electron ORR process. For the PTCDA-modified rGOSF (CO), both the H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency were consistent with the initial rGOSF cathode (Fig. 6 a and b), indicating that the addition of carbonyl-rich PTCDA molecules does not enhance catalytic activity of the rGOSF cathode. The performance of the PTCA-modified rGOSF (O–CO) cathode exhibited considerable improvement, and the corresponding H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency in the first hour reached 6.25 mg h−1 cm−2 and 73.0%, respectively. These results show that active sites for the two-electron ORR process can come not only from carboxyl-edged graphene sheets but also from other carbon hexatomic ring functional molecules with a carboxyl-edged zigzag structure. Compared with other examples from literature, the carboxyl-functionalized rGOSF cathode constructed in this study has an obvious advantage in H2O2 yield and current efficiency; Table S1 shows a performance comparison. Note that the PTCA-modified rGOSF (O–CO) cathode is still unstable at high temperature, and decomposition of active oxygen functional groups and deterioration of H2O2 electrosynthesis performance can be observed for the 1000 °C treated cathode (Fig. S11). To investigate the influence of functional molecule content on the chemical composition and two-electron ORR activity of rGOSF, a series of rGOSF with various addition amounts of PTCDA or PTCA were prepared and analyzed, as shown in Fig. S12. The content of carbonyl or carboxyl groups increases with the addition amount of PTCDA or PTCA molecules until a critical addition amount (∼0.010 mmol) is reached. Further increasing the addition amount of functional molecules has no significant enhancement on the content of oxygen functional groups. For the PTCDA-modified rGOSF cathodes, an increase in the content of carbonyl groups has no positive effect on the H2O2 generation and current efficiency. For the PTCA-modified rGOSF cathodes, however, the increase in carboxyl group content corresponds to improvement in the H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency, demonstrating the two-electron ORR activity of the carboxyl groups. Furthermore, for the 0.025 mmol PTCDA-/PTCA-modified rGOSF cathodes, the addition of excessive functional molecules deteriorated the electrical conductivity of rGOSF, resulting in the attenuation of H2O2 accumulation. Applied potential and electrolyte pH are the important parameters that determine electrochemical H2O2 generation and subsequent EF process [52–54]; therefore, the H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency of rGOSF, rGOSF (CO), and rGOSF (O–CO) cathodes under different applied potentials and electrolyte pH values were systematically evaluated; furthermore, the results are shown in Fig. 6c and d. As shown in Fig. 6c, the H2O2 generation rates of the three rGOSF cathodes all increased as the cathode potential decreased from −0.6 V to −1.0 V, where they reached the maximal value. At the cathode potential of −1.2 V, H2O2 generation rate decreased because of both the reduction of H2O2 to H2O and the H2 evolution reaction, which is a side reaction that limits the ORR to H2O2 process [9,55]. Moreover, the four-electron ORR route is favored at high cathodic potentials. The reduction of H2O2 to H2O, the H2 evolution reaction, and four-electron ORR collectively result in the decline of current efficiency as the cathode potential changes from −0.6 V to −1.2 V. Furthermore, at all applied potential, the carboxyl-modified rGOSF (O–CO) cathode maintains a significantly enhanced H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency, demonstrating its high catalytic activity and excellent operation stability of rGOSF (O–CO) for a wide range of cathodic potentials. Fig. 6d shows the effect of electrolyte pH on H2O2 electrogeneration rate and current efficiency of different rGOSF cathodes. H2O2 accumulations for different rGOSF cathodes declined with increased electrolyte pH; thus, lower initial pH is beneficial to higher H2O2 generation, which would be favorable for the homogeneous Fenton reaction [52,53]. In acidic conditions, sufficient hydrogen ions could participate in the H2O2 electrosynthesis reaction, and increased current responses could result in higher electron transfer rates for the ORR process [56]. In an alkaline medium, generated H2O2 predominantly exists in the form of HO2 −, which could catalyze H2O2 decomposition [57]. Furthermore, the current efficiencies of H2O2 generation using different rGOSF cathodes increased with increased electrolyte pH. The primary reason is that, at lower pH, the increased rate of hydrogen ion reduction to H2 is a competitive side reaction to the two-electron ORR process. Note that the H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency of the carbonyl-modified rGOSF (CO) cathode show significant improvements as the electrolyte pH increases to 10 and are comparable to the values of the carboxyl-modified rGOSF (O–CO) cathode. The carbonyl-rich PTCDA molecule could be hydrolyzed in an alkaline medium and convert to the carboxyl-rich PTCA molecule [50,51]; thus, the significantly enhanced H2O2 generation rate and current efficiency of the rGOSF (CO) cathode in an alkaline medium confirms the catalytic activity of carboxyl groups."
11,Degradation of typical organic pollutants via homogeneous EF process,"3.5 Degradation of typical organic pollutants via homogeneous EF process The application of rGOSF and functional molecule-modified rGOSF cathodes for degrading typical organic pollutants was evaluated via the homogeneous EF process. Fig. 7 a shows the removal efficiency of BPA using different rGOSF cathodes. Before degradation experiments, all tested rGOSF cathodes were immersed in BPA with oxygen bubbling for 30 min. The resultant low removal efficiency eliminated the adsorption effect of 3D rGOSF on organic pollutants. In the subsequent EF process, the rGOSF (O–CO) cathode presented the optimal degradation performance for BPA, in which the pollutant was almost fully removed within 30 min (with a removal efficiency of ∼98%), superior to that of as-constructed rGOSF or rGOSF (CO) cathodes. The inset in Fig. 7a suggests that the removal rate of BPA follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to BPA concentrations. The rate constants, obtained in homogeneous EF systems, with different rGOSF cathodes were of the order of rGOSF (O–CO) (0.113 min−1), rGOSF (CO) (0.071 min−1), and initial rGOSF (0.069 min−1). Thus, the modification of rGOSF with carboxyl-rich functional molecule improved the removal rate by 1.64 times. The reusability of the rGOSF (O–CO) cathode was examined by consecutive homogeneous EF tests (Fig. 7b). Note that, even after 10 continuous EF processes, BPA could still be efficiently removed within 30 min, demonstrating excellent cathode reusability. During these 10 continuous cycles, the yields of H2O2 were maintained at a fairly low level (<6 × 10−3 mg cm−2, as shown in Fig. S13), indicating the efficient conversion of H2O2 to active radicals in the homogeneous EF process. Meanwhile, even after 10 EF processes, the chemical composition and microscopic morphology of the rGOSF (O–CO) cathode remains almost unchanged (Fig. S14), verifying the excellent operational stability of the electrode. Fig. 7c shows the TOC removal efficiency and mineralization current efficiency of homogeneous EF systems with different rGOSF cathodes in BPA degradation experiments. The mineralization of BPA is a complex multi-step process involving the degradation of multiple organic intermediate products [58], thus the removal efficiency of TOC is much lower than that of BPA. The TOC removal efficiency of the rGOSF (O–CO) cathode reached 86.5% within 6 h, higher than that of the initial rGOSF (79.4%) and rGOSF (CO) (77.6%). Residual organic matter in the BPA degradation system primarily resulted from short chain aliphatic acids and small molecule organic acids, which have low biological toxicity [58,59]. In particular, mineralization current efficiency obtained in the homogeneous EF process of the rGOSF (O–CO) cathode is 18.57%, which is higher than the values reported for most EF processes [28,60,61]. SMX and RhB were selected as a typical pharmaceutical active compound and dye contaminant, and their removal efficiencies were tested in the homogeneous EF process with different rGOSF cathodes; Fig. 7d shows the results. Consistent with the removal of BPA, the EF system with the rGOSF (O–CO) cathode possessed the optimal removal efficiency for SMX and RhB with corresponding removal times of 50 and 40 min, respectively. These results effectively demonstrate the potential applications of a carboxyl functionalized non-woven rGOSF cathode for removing organic contaminants from wastewater by the EF process."
12,Conclusions,"Note that 3D rGOSF cathodes with targeted active oxygen functional groups were designed and developed for efficient H2O2 generation and the homogeneous EF process, and the major results are as follows: 1. 3D rGOSF cathodes were constructed via wet-spinning and wet-fusing. rGOSF shows hierarchical microstructure and many exposed active sites with potential application prospects for H2O2 generation by electrocatalysis. 2. A series of rGOSF cathodes with specific oxygen functional groups were fabricated by the multi-step reduction strategy. The optimal catalytic active sites for the two-electron ORR route are confirmed as carboxyl groups, and the contribution of C–O functional groups and carbonyl is ruled out. 3. DFT calculations were employed to gain atomistic insights into the contributions of different oxygen functional groups on the two-electron ORR route. The carboxyl group with its zigzag edge structure yields an overpotential of only 0.07 V, demonstrating its high activity for two-electron ORR. 4. Carbonyl- and carboxyl-rich functional molecules were selected and co-spun with GO LC dispersions to develop functionalized rGOSF. The carboxyl-modified rGOSF cathode possesses a significantly enhanced two-electron ORR performance and organic pollutant removal efficiency."
