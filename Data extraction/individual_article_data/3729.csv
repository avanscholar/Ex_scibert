0,Introduction,"Interest on membrane technologies is growing up for the applications of separation processes because of their continuous operation, modularity and reduced costs [1–4]. Metal membranes are studied for the hydrogen separation: in fact, the hydrogen permeates selectively a dense metal wall accordingly to the Sieverts’ law [1,5,6]. Among the metals, Pd and its alloys have been applied for manufacturing hydrogen separators as a consequence of their high membrane permeability towards hydrogen. In practice, several kinds of Pd–Ag membranes have been proposed: hydrogen selectivity and permeability as well as the cost are the main parameters to be taken into account case-by-case for the specific application. Generally, high selectivity is associated to low permeability (and vice versa), while the cost of the membranes is strictly related to the thickness of the precious metal (Pd alloy) layer. Composite membranes consisting of thin metal films coated over porous supports via electroless plating or sputtering have been studied [7–11]: these membranes exhibit hydrogen permeability and selectivity depending on the coverage of the support pores by the Pd alloy layer. Furthermore, dense Pd–Ag permeator tubes have been produced via cold-rolling and diffusion welding of metal sheets [12]. Their thin metal wall (50 μm) can ensure the complete hydrogen selectivity beside high membrane permeability towards hydrogen and acceptable cost: long-term tests have also demonstrated their good chemical and mechanical stability [13]. A very promising application of the membrane technology is the “membrane reactor”, a device in which a catalyzed reaction and a selective addition of reactants or removal of products are simultaneously carried out. In this way, values of reaction conversion beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium could be attained thanks to the so called “shift effect” of the membrane. Particularly, in case of the dehydrogenation reactions the Pd-based membrane reactors permit obtaining hydrogen yields higher than traditional reactors do: in fact, the selective removal of the hydrogen (one of the reaction product) moves the reaction conversion towards the products according to the Le Chatelier’s principle. Membrane reformers have been studied for producing hydrogen via reforming of hydrocarbons and alcohols. The use of dense and thin wall Pd-based membranes with very high hydrogen selectivity and high permeability permits both producing ultra-pure hydrogen and maximizing the shift effect [14,15]. As a main result, the reforming reactions are endothermic processes thermodynamically favoured by operating at high temperature: the use of membranes selective to hydrogen permits attaining reaction conversion higher (or the same conversion) when operating at the same temperature (or at lower temperature) than the traditional reactors [5]. In the last years, the Pd-based membranes and membrane reactors related technologies have mainly been applied for the production of hydrogen which is considered a clean energy vector [16,17]. Nowadays, hydrogen is largely produced from fossil sources such as methane and coal, while the production from renewable feed-stokes like bio-ethanol could rise for the next future [18–20]. All these processes are carried out via reforming reactions which could be performed into Pd-based membrane reactors with advantages in terms of reaction conversion and process efficiency. Particularly, the Pd–Ag membrane tubes have been applied for ultra-pure hydrogen production from reforming of bio-ethanol in the framework of the activities of the project COST ACTION 543 “Research and development of bio-ethanol processing for fuel cells”. Accordingly, this paper describes the recent findings concerning the design and the manufacturing of Pd-based membranes and membrane reactors applied to the ultra-pure hydrogen production via dehydrogenation reactions."
1,Hydrogen/metal interaction,"The interaction of hydrogen with metals and in particular with Pd and its alloys was widely studied [21]. In this work, two practical aspects of the Pd/H system are considered: the hydrogen permeation mass transfer mechanism and the elongation/contraction of hydrogenated metals. In fact, these two phenomena have practical influence on the membrane and membrane reactors performances and have to be taken into account for the design of the membrane modules."
2,Hydrogen permeation,"2.1 Hydrogen permeation The hydrogen transfer through metals involves several processes which include the dissociation of the hydrogen molecules at the gas/metal interface, the adsorption of the hydrogen atoms on the metal surface, the diffusion of hydrogen through the metal lattice accordingly to the Fick’s law, the hydrogen desorption from the metal surface and then the recombination of hydrogen atoms to form the molecules at the metal/gas interface. As a result, the mass transfer mechanism of the hydrogen through a metal dense wall is considered to take place: the “hydrogen permeation”. The flow rate of the hydrogen permeating through the metal membrane is proportional to the hydrogen partial pressure difference and to the permeation area by means of a permeability coefficient Π and inversely proportional to the membrane wall thickness. Generally, the following expression describes the hydrogen permeation: (1) F = Π ( p up n − p down n ) A t where F is the hydrogen permeation flow rate (mol s−1), Π is the membrane permeability towards hydrogen (mol m−1 s−1 Pa−n), pup and pdown are the hydrogen partial pressure at upstream and downstream side, respectively, n is the pressure factor, A is the membrane area (m2) and t the membrane thickness (m). The pressure factor n is ranging between 0.5 and 1: it depends on the operating conditions and mainly on the pressure. When operating at low pressure n is equal to 0.5 and the formula (1) becomes the Sieverts’ law: (2) F = Π ( p up − p down ) A t where the membrane permeability towards hydrogen is now in mol m−1 s−1 Pa−0.5. The permeation is an energy demanding phenomenon, and then the permeability coefficient depends on the temperature by following an Arrhenius’ law: (3) Π = Π 0 e − E a RT where Π0 is the pre-exponential permeability coefficient (mol m−1 s−1 Pa−0,5) and Ea the activation energy (J mol−1), R the gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1) and T (K) the absolute temperature. The metals exhibit a large spreads of permeability values in the temperature range of interest for the membrane reactor applications (200–700 °C) [22,23], as shown in the Fig. 1 . The choice of the metal to be used for the membranes manufacturing has to take into account several properties: one of the most important is the hydrogen embrittlement. As a matter of fact, the hydrogen interaction with the metal involves the uploading of hydrogen atoms into the metal lattice which can significantly expand. As a consequence, surface defects (cracks, pinholes) and loss of selectivity of the membrane can occur: particularly, thermal and hydrogenation cycling of Pd-based membranes may intensify the harmful effects of the metal embrittlement. For this reason, the use of refractory metals (such as Nb, Ta and V) characterized by high permeability values is limited by their high hydrogen solubility and consequent embrittlement. Moreover, these metals are characterized by a high reactivity with the gases which form over their surfaces dense inorganic layers (oxides, nitrides, etc.) then reducing considerably the hydrogen permeation. In practice, the Pd and its alloys are used as material for manufacturing membranes: particularly, the Pd alloy with 23–25% wt. of Ag is commercially available. In fact, such an alloy composition presents the maximum hydrogen permeation and a reduced embrittlement [24,25]. When composite membranes are considered, a permeability coefficient is associated to each membrane layer, while for the overall composite membrane the “permeance” is introduced. It is depending on the permeability coefficients, the thickness and the mass transfer mechanisms of the several membrane layers. For an example, this is the case of a Pd-ceramic membrane, where the permeation through the metal layer follows the Sieverts’ law, while through the porous ceramic support the mass transfer mechanism is ruled by the Darcy or Knudsen laws [26–28]. Accordingly, for a composite membrane the hydrogen permeation flow rate is given by: (4) F = Φ ( p up n − p down n ) A where Ф is the permeance (mol m−2 s−1 Pa−n). Deviation from the Sieverts’ law were described for composite membranes consisting of Pd-based layer over porous supports [29,30]."
3,Thermal expansion of hydrogenated Pd,"2.2 Thermal expansion of hydrogenated Pd As a consequence of the hydrogen uploading, the metal lattice can significantly enlarge with harmful consequences (i.e. possible loss of selectivity of the membranes) in the case of the hydrogen permeators where thermal and hydrogenation cycles involve their embrittlement. Beside the increase of the permeability, the addition of silver to Pd reduces the metal lattice expansion and the loss of ductility. Anyway, from ambient temperature to 400 °C, the hydrogenated Pd–Ag expands 5 times more than the non-hydrogenated material does [24]: the maximum measured elongation of Pd–Ag permeator tubes was found to be about 1.5% [31]."
4,Pd-based membranes,"The industrial applications of Pd-based membranes are limited by the high cost of the precious material (Pd and Pd alloys): consequently, the reduction of the Pd layer thickness was approached by different techniques. Thin Pd-based films have been coated over both ceramic and metallic porous supports using several procedures in order to produce composite membranes. Generally, composite Pd-ceramic membranes consist of three layers: a Pd or Pd alloy film, a ceramic porous support and an intermediate ceramic layer of reduced porosity which improve the adhesion between the metal and the support. An example of such composite membranes is given by P.S. Apte et al. [32]: electroless plating of Pd or Pd alloy was carried out over a bi-layer ceramic porous support. However, as a main drawback, the presence of the intermediate layer in the electroless plated composite membranes reduces significantly the hydrogen permeance. In this view, S. Hou et al. [33] developed a modified electroless plating procedure for producing Pd-ceramic membranes characterized by high hydrogen permeation fluxes. The procedure developed consists of filling the ceramic porous support with Al(OH)3, electroless plating Pd or Pd alloy layer and then removing (also partial) the filler material. Especially, the Al(OH)3 is decomposed to porous Al2O3 in order to maintain open the pores of the substrate and to form free passages for the hydrogen permeation so to maintain high hydrogen permeance. In order to reduce the thermal mismatching between the Pd alloy films and the porous substrate, metal supports (stainless steel, nickel, etc.) were studied. Z. Dardas et al. [34] used a stainless steel porous support and introduced an intermediate ceramic layer of appropriate thermal expansion coefficient. Pd–Ag 23% wt. and Pd–Cu 40% wt. films (thickness less than 10 μm) having a thermal expansion coefficient of 13.9 μm m−1 °C−1 are coated over an intermediate oxide yittria-zirconia porous layer (average porosity 0.1 μm, thickness less than 3 μm and thermal expansion coefficient of 11 μm m−1 °C−1): the substrate is made of porous 446 stainless steel of thermal expansion coefficient 11 μm m−1 °C−1. Beside the effect of overcoming the thermal mismatching, the presence of an intermediate ceramic layer may reduce the intermetallic diffusion (with consequent poisoning) between the stainless porous support and Pd–Ag layer. Particularly, M.E. Ayturk et al. [35] studied a method for producing intermetallic diffusion barrier layers in composite membrane consisting of Pd and Pd–Ag films over porous stainless steel plates. The intermetallic film is made of a porous Pd–Ag layer prepared by the bi-metal multi-layer deposition technique. It is a continuous electroless plating with alternating Pd and Ag baths. The selectivity of the membrane has been ensured by the deposition of a final gas tight Pd layer. Tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the method to increase the operating temperature of the membranes (over 500 °C) and to obtain long-term durability. The use of an intermediate zirconia layer for Pd membrane deposited over porous stainless steel support was studied by S.K. Gade et al. [36]. The effectiveness of these zirconia diffusion barriers has been demonstrated at 400 °C for over 250 h. R. Bredesen and H. Klette [37] invented a method for producing a continuous metal foil (silver, palladium alloys) very thin (<2 μm) to be supported over a porous material. The metal film is deposited over a rotating base member by sputtering or other vaporizing methods: the base member consists of a material (glass, oxides, nitrides) having a low adherence with the coated metal film so that its removal can be easily carried out by chemical, thermal or mechanical treatments. This method permits to produce very thin and defect free metal films: i.e. palladium and palladium alloys for hydrogen separation which can be laid over porous substrates by heat treatments. A composite membrane produced by the above described method was tested by Peters et al. [38]: a 2.2 μm of Pd–Ag film obtained by magnetron sputtering has been coated over a porous stainless steel tube of average pore size 2 μm. Hydrogen permeation tests exhibited at 400 °C a permeance of 6.6 × 10−3 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 and a H2/N2 separation factor of 1400. Alternatively to the use of a porous support, dense Pd–Ag permeator tubes of wall thickness 50–60 μm were produced via cold-rolling and diffusion welding of metal foils [39]. The rolled Pd–Ag 23–25% wt. foils have been welded by operating a thermal treatment at 1000 °C for 1–2 h in a furnace under vacuum or inert gas (Ar, He) atmosphere: the high diffusion of silver atoms into the metal lattice permits to join the metal parts. In Fig. 2 the welding device is shown in detail: the metal foils of reduced thickness are wrapped around an alumina bar and then the limbs of the foil to be joined are constrained through a thermo-mechanical press. It consists of stainless steel sheets closed by a threatened bar made of a metal alloy having a negligible thermal expansion coefficient (i.e., Invar). By increasing the temperature, all materials expand except for the threatened bar which applies the pressure needed to ensure the welding of the Pd–Ag foil. The resulting membrane tubes have a wall thickness of about 50 μm. Such a membrane wall thickness permits to operate at 300–400 °C with a transmembrane pressure of 200–330 kPa: moreover, the metal membrane is dense and defect free thus exhibiting very high hydrogen selectivity beside significant hydrogen permeation fluxes [40]. By operating at temperature of 300–350 °C and low differential transmembrane pressure (200 kPa), hydrogen specific permeation flow-rates of about 3 Nm3 m−2 h−1 are separated while the cost of these Pd-based membranes (based on a Pd price of 10 € g−1) is about 1600 € per Nm3 h−1 of hydrogen production capacity. The diffusion bonding was also applied to the production of membranes made of Pd–Cu 40% wt. [41] which is the composition of the Pd–Cu alloy which exhibits the maximum permeability towards hydrogen. Pd–Cu foils of a thickness of 25–63 μm are welded to a Cu frame by pressing the parts to be joined in a hydrogen atmosphere furnace at about 300 °C for several hours. The procedure can also be applied to connect the Pd–Cu dense membranes to the membrane module through Cu metal frames or to manufacture sandwiched membranes. Another application of producing hydrogen permeation membranes via diffusion welding was developed by N. Iniotakis et al. [42] which enclose a thin Pd alloy foil between two fine-mesh metal fabrics. These membranes are characterized by high permeability towards hydrogen: in fact, the Pd thickness (10–30 μm) can be significantly reduced by the presence of a bi-lateral support. When high temperature applications are foreseen (600 °C), the fabrics are coated by a diffusion-blocking layer (i.e. Ni) in order to avoid the intermetallic diffusion between the Pd alloy and the metal support."
5,Metal membranes with low or no Pd content,"3.1 Metal membranes with low or no Pd content Presently, in order to avoid or reduce the use of Pd several metals such as Nb, V, Ta, Ni and Ti alloys are mainly under study. K. Hashi et al. [43] considered the Ni–Ti alloy with Nb addition by attaining high membrane permeability towards hydrogen while composite membrane consisting of Ta foils covered by vapour deposition with thin Pd films prepared by N.M. Peachey et al. [44] showed permeability values lower than Pd. Ti–Ni alloys with low Pd content (2–9 wt.%) were used by G.F. Tereschenko and co-workers [45] for preparing by rolling stable and highly permeable membranes. These membranes exhibited good performances during both permeation and reaction (dehydrogenation) tests."
6,Pd-based membrane reactors,"The design of Pd-based membrane modules has to address some important issues: - the interaction between hydrogen and Pd produces significant modification of the metal lattice thus producing the expansion (contraction) of the membranes as a consequence of the hydrogen uploading (desorption), - the membrane configuration has to be optimized in order to reduce the size of the membrane modules particularly when scaling up prototype membrane reactors from laboratory to commercial applications. In the membrane reactors, the Pd-based membrane has to be tightly connected to the membrane module in order to guarantee the selective hydrogen separation: however, such a connection has to avoid any mechanical stress to the membrane which could be damaged especially when thin Pd layers are used. In a preferable configuration of the membrane reactors, the catalyst bed is put inside the membrane tube (lumen side), while the hydrogen permeated through the membrane is collected in the shell side of the module: a scheme of such reactors is given in Fig. 3 . The permeator tube ends are tightly fixed to the module (i.e. made of steel or ceramics): the hydrogenated Pd-based tube under thermal cycling elongates or reduces much more than the membrane module shell does. Consequently, the membrane tube is mechanically stressed: a combined compressive and bending stress is applied to the membrane tube, see the scheme of Fig. 4 . At ENEA laboratories, the Pd-based membrane tubes were assembled in a finger-like configuration where the hydrogen separation is carried out in a dead-end flow mode: such a configuration was designed and built for both single [46] and multi-tube [47–49] membrane modules. The permeator tube is fixed to the module only at one end, while the other end is closed and the feed stream enters the membrane lumen via a smaller stainless steel tube put inside the permeator, see the Fig. 5 . Ethanol steam reforming experiments were carried out using a membrane reactor made of a dense Pd–Ag tube of wall thickness 50–60 μm, diameter 10 mm and length about 150 mm. By operating at 450 °C, 200 kPa of lumen (reaction) pressure and recovering hydrogen in the shell side of the membrane module by a nitrogen sweep gas stream at atmospheric pressure hydrogen yields higher than 80% have been attained with a Ru-based catalyst [14,15]. The finger-like permeator tubes assembly was also applied for the manufacturing of multi-tube membrane reactors carrying out the water gas shift reaction. Fig. 6 shows scheme of the membrane module and a view of the 19 Pd–Ag tubes of wall thickness 50–60 μm, diameter 10 mm and length 250 mm [50]. The multi-tube reactor has been assembled in an experimental setup where a two-step process for producing hydrogen from ethanol steam reforming has been tested. The system consists of a traditional reformer operating at high temperature (690–800 °C) and a water gas shift multi-tube membrane reactor, see Fig. 7 . About 3.5 NL min−1 of pure hydrogen have been produced by feeding 500 g h−1 of a water/ethanol mixture of molar ratio 10.5/1 and by recovering the hydrogen through vacuum pumping in the shell side of the membrane module at 400 °C [51]. A multi-tube membrane reactor has also been proposed by Wellington et al. [52] for producing hydrogen via steam reforming: the composite membrane tubes consisted of thin Pd alloy films coated over a two layer porous substrate. E.B. Buxbaum [53] disclosed a tubular membrane reactor consisting of Pd-based membranes (i.e. Pd-coated refractory metals, Pd–Ag, Pd–Cu, porous metals and ceramics): in this device, the thermal integration of a heat source and a reaction catalyst was approached. Again, E.B. Buxbaum [54] studied a hydrogen generator device where a flat plate membrane was proposed in order to both perform the water gas shift reaction and to separate hydrogen. A flat configuration of a membrane reactor was studied also by O. Gorke et al. [55]: this reactor consists of a first zone for the production of heat (i.e via a combustion process), a second one wherein the hydrogen is produced by a catalyzed reaction. A metal membrane selective to hydrogen separates the second compartment from a third one where the hydrogen purified stream is collected, see Fig. 8 . Heat transfer occurs from the first to the second zone in order to sustain the endothermic hydrogen production reaction while hydrogen selective mass transfer through the membrane permits the production of pure hydrogen. A different mechanical design of Pd-based membrane modules was applied to the PERMCAT reactor. This membrane reactor operates the detritiation of plasma exhaust streams of fusion reactors. Such streams contain gases (mainly water and methane) in which hydrogen atoms are substituted by tritium (the mass 3 hydrogen isotope). The stream coming from the plasma is fed into the lumen side of a Pd–Ag tubular membrane reactor over a catalytic bed, while in the shell side a pure hydrogen stream is sent in counter-current mode [31,56]. The hydrogen isotopes permeate through the membrane while on the catalyst the following isotope exchange reactions take place: (5) 2 H 2 + CQ 4 ⇔ CH 4 + 2 Q 2 (6) H 2 + Q 2 O ⇔ H 2 O + Q 2 where Q is generally indicating a hydrogen isotope. The PERMCAT permeator tube (length 500 mm and wall thickness 50 μm) built by ENEA laboratories has tightly been fixed at both ends to the module. In this case, in order to avoid any harmful mechanical stresses, two pre-tensioned stainless steel metal bellows have been inserted between the Pd–Ag tube ends and module [57,58]. The permeator joined to the metal bellows is shorter than the module by about 7.5 mm, which is the assessed maximum elongation of the Pd–Ag tube under hydrogenation (Fig. 9 -A). Then the permeator is connected to the module by applying a traction force T which expands the bellows (Fig. 9-B). During operation, as a consequence of the hydrogenation, the Pd alloy tube expands: its elongation is compensated by the bellows and no compressive stress (at least T = 0) is applied to the thin wall tube (Fig. 9-C)."
7,Recent developments in Pd-based membrane reactors,"4.1 Recent developments in Pd-based membrane reactors The production of hydrogen by reforming of hydrocarbons and alcohols can be carried out in compact reactor systems where the production of heat (as required by the endothermic steam reforming), the catalyzed reaction and the hydrogen separation take simultaneously place. An example of such a membrane reactor was given by Z. Jia et al. [59] which proposed a device with a reaction channel placed between a heating stream channel and a hydrogen channel separated by a metal membrane (Pd, V, Cu or their alloys), as shown in Fig. 10 . An autothermal membrane reactor was proposed by Toshiyuki N. et al. for the production of hydrogen from combined steam reforming and partial oxidation of methane. Usually, in an autothermal reformer, the control of the heat transfer between the combustion and steam reforming reactions permits to maintain the optimum temperature profiles inside the reactor. In particular, temperature peaks which could damage the membrane have to be avoided. Accordingly, the membrane reactor studied by N. Toshiyuki [60] consists of a reaction tube containing the catalyst bed and a permselective membrane tube closed at one end. The hydrogen produced by the methane steam reforming permeates through the membrane while the heat needed to the endothermic reaction is given by the combustion of methane. Especially, in the annulus of the reaction tube a combustion catalyst is present: oxygen (or air) are fed and dosed through small tubes with ports along the flow direction of the reaction in order to control the methane combustion and ensure an optimum temperature profile, see Fig. 11 . A multi-stage membrane reactor was disclosed by E. Gernot and A. Deschamps [61]: this device was proposed for producing pure hydrogen from reaction of steam with hydrocarbon compounds. A series of membranes of Pd or Pd alloys in thin films or laminated sheets separate annular compartments where the catalysts specific for the reforming reactions are placed. Other innovative membrane reactor concepts were studied for producing hydrogen from methane steam reforming [62]. Removable membrane tubes (length 500 mm) obtained by electroless plating or magnetron sputtering of thin Pd-based layer over porous supports are fixed to the membrane module via flexible connections. The catalyst bed (shell side of the membranes) is heated by combustion of fuel with air while the hydrogen produced by the reforming and water gas shift reaction is collected in the membrane lumen by a sweep gas stream. The reforming tests (electroless membranes) showed H2/N2 selectivity better than 2500 above 400 °C while in the water gas shift experiments (sputtered membranes) the permselectivity was about 1000 in long-term tests."
8,Conclusions,"The wide application of metal membranes for producing ultra-pure hydrogen needs to overcome the problems given by the high cost and limited availability of the palladium alloys: recent studies have been aimed at reducing the use of the precious metal or at using alloys cheaper and alternative to Pd ones. However, the fabrication of thin Pd-based films coated over porous (ceramic or metallic) supports has to take into consideration the hydrogenation of Pd which significantly elongates with respect to the support thus involving loss of adhesion and selectivity of the membrane. On the other hand, the study of metals alternative to Pd, mainly refractory metals, has to face the problem of their high hydrogen solubility and embrittlement with consequent poor durability. Other important R&D studies concern the design of the Pd-based membrane reactors: thermal cycling of hydrogenated Pd alloys involves significant elongation/contraction of the membrane tubes that have to be considered in order to ensure a good durability. Furthermore, the Pd membrane reactors design has to be also aimed at optimizing the operating conditions (temperature control, reactants dosing, maximizing the hydrogen permeation, etc.) and, especially for small mobile applications, at reducing sizes and costs. In this view, recent researches are developing compact multi-stage membrane modules where the reaction and permeation kinetics as well the heat transfer are considered in the design. Future developments of membranes and membrane reactors will consider the optimization of the process design. In fact, the introduction of membrane devices into a known process usually improves its performances in terms of reaction yields and energy efficiency even if further improvements could be attained by appropriate membrane reactors studies. Moreover, the membrane reactors are generally optimized under operating conditions (P, T, excess of reagents, etc.) which can be significantly different from those of similar traditional (non membrane) processes. Then, new process design concepts should be developed when membrane technologies are introduced."
