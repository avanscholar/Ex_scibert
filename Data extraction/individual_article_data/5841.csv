0,Introduction,"Converting solar energy into chemical energy (such as H2) with semiconductors by the means of photocatalysis is an appealing and promising solution to address the ever-increasing energy crisis and environmental issues [1–3]. Since the pioneering report on photocatalytic water splitting in 1972, a large number of semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed to enhance the solar-to-chemical (STC) efficiency [4–9]. Despite great progresses have been made, the STC efficiency is still unsatisfactory and further improvement is still needed. A major obstruction of STC efficiency lies in the incongruous photocatalytic systems where the recombination of electrons (e−) and holes (h+) in a semiconductor occurs in picoseconds, while the migration of charge carriers to surface and the reaction at surface take microseconds and milliseconds, respectively [10,11]. Therefore, to achieve high photocatalytic activity, it is crucial to boost surface reactions and further promote photoelectric efficiency. The photoelectric efficiency is associated with the migration and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, which rely on the composition and electronic band structure of a photocatalyst. For an individual semiconductor, the photoelectric efficiency is generally low due to the limited migration and transfer of photogenerated carriers [12]. A constructed heterostructure has been proved to be effective to facilitate the separation and transfer of charge carriers from one semiconductor to the other through the coupled interface [13]. The electron transfer pathways in heterogeneous photocatalysts are categorized into three groups in terms of band alignment, Type-I, Type-II and Z-scheme, among which the Z-scheme transfer is the most efficient in separating charge carriers and enhancing photoelectric efficiency [12]. In addition to the electronic band configuration, the architecture of heterostructures influences the efficiency of photoelectrical conversion as well. It has been suggested that the hetero-nanostructure is more effective in photoelectrical conversion as it offers an extremely high surface area while maintaining an interconnected network to ensure the excellent charge carrier conduction [14–17]. However, the construction of hollow hetero-nanostructures with direct Z-scheme band alignment with usual inorganic semiconductors is still challenging. Hollow nanostructures exhibit the unique advantage of larger exposed surface which effectively accelerates surface reactions [18,19]. For instance, hollow nanospheres show higher photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) and H2 evolution reaction (HER) than the solid counterparts owing to enhanced light harvesting due to multiple scattering/reflection of light and larger specific surface area offering more active sites for surface reactions [20–22]. Compared with hollow spheres, the hollow cubes show further enhanced catalytic activity because of the anisotropic shape of the cubic morphology and more exposed sides and facets as active sites [21]. These advantages exert to the greatest extent in the hollow polyhedrons (HPs) which exhibit efficient photocatalytic performance for HER, CRR, and so on [23,24]. Thus, introducing HPs into a Z-scheme heterostructure can substantially improve photocatalytic activity by virtue of enhanced sunlight harvesting and expedited surface reactions. Recently, metal chalcogenides have attracted wide attention and become an important research topic due to their unique electronic band structure [21,23,24]. As a typical example, cobalt sulfides (CoSx) have the following merits as the photocatalyst: narrow band gap for visible light response, high flat-band potential with strong photoreduction ability, and efficient charge transfer through intermediate sulfur atoms bonded to the metal atoms at interface [21]. Hence, the CoSx-based heterostructures such as Co9S8@ZnIn2S4 and CdS/Co9S8 exhibit excellent performance for photocatalytic H2 production [21,23]. In these heterostructures, the S vacancies in CoSx generally act as active sites and play important roles in adsorbing and activating insert molecules. In contrast, the Co vacancies in Co1-xS for photocatalysis earn less concern, although they are important for advanced electrodes for various batteries, electrocatalysis and supercapacitors in the previously reported studies [25–27]. Herein, a sugar-gourd-shaped direct Z-scheme hollow hetero-nanostructure of Co1-xS HPs skewered on CdS nanowires (NWs) (CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs) is synthesized through a two-step strategy of growing ZIF-67 on CdS NWs followed by a facile sulfidation reaction. The obtained CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs are an efficient visible light-driven photocatalyst for hydrogen production. The H2 production rate of 13.48 mmol g−1 h−1 is achieved with optimized CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs without using any additional co-catalyst. The remarkable photocatalytic activity is attributed to the coupling of CdS NW and Co1-xS HPs, which endows the CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs with broad light spectrum response and large specific surface area to expose abundant sides and facets with active sites. More importantly, the Z-scheme carrier transfer mechanism substantially facilitates the separation of photogenerated e−-h+ pairs, leaving photoexcited electrons in the conduction band (CB) of Co1-xS HPs and thus leading to strong photoreduction ability. This work demonstrates the potential of direct Z-scheme hollow hetero-nanostructure of Co1-xS with Co vacancies as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen production."

2,Material preparation,"2.1 Material preparation Synthesis of CdS NWs: CdS NWs were synthesized via a solvothermal method [28]. Briefly, 0.855 g of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 0.630 g of thiourea were dissolved in 22.5 mL of ethanediamine. The resulting solution was transferred into a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and then kept at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the bright yellow precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times to remove impurities. Finally, the product was dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Synthesis of ZIF-67: 1.313 g of 2-methylimidazolem (2-MI) and 0.582 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 20 mL of methanol, respectively. Then, the solution of 2-MI was quickly poured into the solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O followed by stirring violently for 5 min. The resultant mixed solution was aged for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the purple precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol for several times and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Synthesis of sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/ZIF-67 hybrids: 0.388 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.050 g of CdS NWs were dispersed in 20 mL of methanol with the assistance of sonication for 5 min, and the obtained dark yellow mixture was denoted as solution A. 0.875 g of 2-MI and 20 mL methanol were mixed to obtain solution B. Afterward, solution B was rapidly transferred into solution A under vigorous magnetic stirring for 5 min. The resultant mixed solution was aged for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the precipitates (denoted as CdS/ZIF-67-2) were collected by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol for three times, then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. For comparison, the same method was employed to synthesize CdS/ZIF-67-1 with 0.194 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.438 g 2-MI, and CdS/ZIF-67-3 with 0.582 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.313 g 2-MI. Synthesis of sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs: In a typical procedure, 0.080 g of thioacetamide (TAA) and 0.080 g of the as-prepared sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/ZIF-67-x (x = 1, 2, 3) were dispersed in 27 mL of absolute ethanol with the assistance of sonication for 3 min, and the mixture was transferred into a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 4 h. After cooled to room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times to remove impurities. Finally, the precipitate was dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The products prepared with CdS/ZIF-67-x are in correspondence with CdS/Co1-xS-n (n = 1, 2, 3), which are denoted as CCS-1, CCS-2, and CCS-3 HHNSs, respectively. In addition, the CdS/CoS sample is also prepared using the same method with 0.050 g CdS NWs, 0.0668 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.0172 g TAA, and 27 mL of absolute ethanol. Synthesis of Co1-xS HPs: 0.080 g of ZIF-67 and 0.080 g of TAA were dispersed in 27 mL of ethyl alcohol. Then the solution was transferred into a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 4 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the black precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times to remove impurities, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h."
3,Sample characterizations,"2.2 Sample characterizations The crystal structure and phase purity of the samples were characeterized by Powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) measurements performed with a Philips PW 3040/60 XRD using the Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies were viewed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with the assistance of a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron micro-analyzer. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) mapping analysis were carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K on a surface area and porosimetry analyzer V-Sorb 2800P, with samples degassed in vacuum at 100 °C for 4 h. The surface composition and chemical state of the samples were analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), using an ESCALab MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Mg Kα X-ray as the excitation source. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using a FLS 920 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. The surface photocurrent measurements were carried out at room temperature on a surface photovoltage spectrometer (PLSPS/IPCE1000 Beijing Perfect light technology Co., Ltd.) consisting of a source of monochromatic light with a mechanical chopper (SR 540, Stanford research, Inc.) and a lock-in amplifier. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of the samples were recorded over the range of 200–800 nm with the absorption mode of a Thermo Nicolet Evolution 500 UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment. Raman measurements were performed using a Renishaw inVia RM10000 micro-Raman spectrometer (λ = 514.5 nm)."
4,Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements The Mott-Schottky measurements were performed at different frequencies (200, 500, 800 Hz) with an ac voltage of 10 mV and various applied potentials on a Zennium E station (ZAHNER, Germany) which works with a standard three-electrode cell with 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte solution in a three electrode quartz cell, the glassy carbon electrode covered with photocatalyst as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also carried out in a K3[Fe(CN)6] (5 mM) and KCl (1 M) aqueous solution with the Zennium E station, at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with an ac voltage of 10 mV. Photocurrent measurements under visible-light irradiation were performed at the 0.2 V bias potential vs. SCE on a CHI840C electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, China) with a standard three-electrode configuration using phototcatalyst-precoated fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) (coated area: 1 cm2) as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, SCE as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte. A Xe lamp with a cut-on filter (λ > 420 nm) was employed as the visible light source. 5 mg of sample was add to the mixed solution of 50 μL of ethanol and 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%) under sonication, then 15 μL of mixture ink was pipetted on the surface of a FTO glass to obtain a coating films of 1 × 1 cm2 large."
5,Photocatalytic H2 production measurement,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production measurement Photocatalytic H2 production: The photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was conducted on a Labsolar-III AG system with a Pyrex reaction vessel connected to an online gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies GC-7890B, TCD, Ar carrier). The photocatalytic reaction was evaluated in a gas-closed reactor connecting to a water bath to maintain the reaction temperature at 25 °C. In a typical reaction, 20 mg of photocatalysts was dispersed in 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 20% lactic acid as the sacrificial agents. Before performing the photocatalytic experiments, the reaction vessel was purged with argon and evacuated for at least 30 min to remove dissolved air. The suspension was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (MicroSolar 300, Perfect Light) equipped with an optical filter at 420 nm to cut off the ultraviolet light. The AQE for photocatalytic H2 production: The AQE of photocatalytic H2 production was calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) AQE = N e N p = N H 2 × 4 N p = n H 2 × N A × 4 W × A × t h × ν × 100 % where N e, N p and N A represent the number of reacted electrons, incident photons and generated hydrogen, respectively, n H 2 represents the molar number of generated hydrogen, ν, W, A and t are the incident light frequency, intensity, irradiation area and time, respectively, and N A and h are the Avogadro’s constant and Planck constant, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,"The two-step synthesis strategy of the sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs is shown in Fig. 1 . The CdS NWs are first prepared according to the previously reported method [28], and the selection of CdS as a constituent is motivated by its advantageous properties for photocatalysis, such as a suitable band gap and the adjustable band edge position [29–32]. The ZIF-67 polyhedrons are then synthesized with the presence of CdS NWs, achieving the interesting sugar-gourd-shaped hybrid nanoarchitecture of CdS/ZIF-67, polyhedron structures skewered on the CdS NWs, which is the precursor of CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs (step I). The sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs are finally obtained by a mild sulfidation reaction of CdS/ZIF-67 with TAA at 120 °C for 4 h (step II), where the ZIF-67 polyhedrons are directly transformed into Co1-xS HPs on the CdS NWs. The morphology and phase composition of the sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs were examined by FESEM and TEM in combination with the XRD technique. The FESEM images in Fig. 2 a and b show that the obtained CdS NWs have a size of ca. 50 nm in diameter and ca. 5 μm in length. The mechanical stability of the NW enables the skewering of the ZIF-67 polyhedrons to obtain the sugar-gourd-shaped hybrid structures. As shown in Fig. 2c, the morphology of the as-prepared CdS/ZIF-67 hybrids exhibits the obvious sugar-gourd shape, indicating that the ZIF-67 polyhedrons are successfully skewered on the CdS NWs. The skewered gourds present a polyhedral morphology with a smooth surface and a diameter of ca. 450 nm (Fig. 2d). The XRD pattern shows the product consists of the pure ZIF-67 phase and hexagonal-phase CdS (JCPDS No. 41-1049) (Fig. S1). After sulfidation reaction, the resulting CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs (the mass ratio of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2-MI and CdS NWs is 388: 875: 50, respectively, denoted as CCS-2) maintain the sugar-gourd-shaped morphology (Fig. 2e), whereas the high-magnification FESEM image reveals the rough surface of the CCS-2 HHNSs, especially for the polyhedral gourds (Fig. 2f). Moreover, the cracked gourds indicated by red arrows imply that the solid polyhedrons are directly transformed into hollow structure through this in-situ sulfidation treatment. Fig. 3 a shows the TEM images of the as-prepared CCS-2 HHNSs, which further confirms that all the solid ZIF-67 polyhedrons are completely converted into hollow structures on CdS NWs. Revealed by the high-magnification TEM image (Fig. S2), each HP is composed of numerous fine nanoparticles (ca. 6 nm). The XRD pattern of the CCS-2 HHNSs shows all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the sole hexagonal phase of CdS (Fig. S3), also implying the form of ultrasmall nanocrystals of the Co1-xS HPs [33]. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3b, taken from the side surface of an individual CCS-2 HHNS marked with a yellow ring in Fig. 3a, displays the tight interfacial contract between CdS NW and Co1-xS HP which is expected to favor the charge transfer across the interface. Separated by the interface, the lattice fringes exhibit a spacing of 0.34 nm in the NW, in good agreement with the d value of the (002) plane of hexagonal phase CdS [28], and those spacing of 0.19 and 0.29 nm of the nanoparticles in a HP can be indexed to the (102) and (100) plane of hexagonal phase Co1-xS, respectively (JCPDS No. 42-0826). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3c) clearly reveals the existence of CdS (red) and Co-deficiency Co1-xS (yellow) phases in the product. The STEM-EDS elemental mapping images of individual CCS-2 HHNS signify that the existence and uniform distribution of Cd, S, and Co elements within the HPs and NW, respectively (Fig. 3d-g). These results together demonstrate the successful synthesis of sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm is employed to assess the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the CCS-2 HHNSs (Fig. S4). It is found that the CCS-2 HHNSs possess a surface area of 47.96 m2 g−1, which is high for inorganic nanostructures and can exposes lots of active sites to accelerate surface reactions. Furthermore, the corresponding pore size distribution curve demonstrates the existence of mesopores in the Co1-xS HPs, which can facilitate the mass transfer in heterogeneous catalysis (inset of Fig. S4). Although the limited interfacial contact may impede the photoelectrical efficiency somewhat. Considering the Co1-xS HPs possess many sides and facets with lots of active sites and that the surface reaction is the rate-determined step for photocatalysis, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is expectable. To explore the formation mechanism of the sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs, we investigated the evolution of morphology and structure of the CdS/ZIF-67 hybrids with the reaction time. The FESEM images of the as-prepared CdS/ZIF-67 hybrids obtained at different intervals are shown in Fig. S5. First, some Co2+ ions can be absorbed on the surface of CdS NWs in solution A, offering the nucleation sites for ZIF-67 nanoparticles. Upon the concentration of Co2+ and 2-MI in reaction system is increased, and the nucleation of the ZIF-67 nanoparticles is predominated at the early stage (Fig. S5a). As the concentration of Co2+ and 2-MI gradually decreases with the reaction time, the transformation from the nucleation-dominated to growth-dominated process occurs, accompanied by the formation of some larger ZIF-67 nanoparticles on CdS NWs (Fig. S5b). With reaction time prolonging, the growth of ZIF-67 particles became dominated, corresponding to the irregular polyhedral morphology (Fig. S5c). After 10 min, the concentration of Co2+ and 2-MI in reaction system is low enough, the growth process of ZIF-67 finish with the formation of ZIF-67 polyhedrons skewered on the CdS NWs (Fig. S5d). Finally, the sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs were obtained by a mild sulfidation reaction of CdS/ZIF-67 with TAA at 120 °C for 4 h, where the ZIF-67 polyhedrons were directly transformed into Co1-xS HPs on the CdS NWs. Interestingly, the loading amounts of Co1-xS HPs on an individual CdS NW can be tuned by changing the ratio of ZIF-67 precursor and CdS NWs in the sulfidation treatment. When the ratio is lower than that of CCS-2 HHNSs, the loading content of Co1-xS HPs is reduced and more surface of the CdS NWs (denoted as CCS-1) is exposed (Fig. S6a and b). In contrast, a higher loading of Co1-xS HPs on the CdS NWs can be obtained with the increasing of the ratio of ZIF-67, and therefore less surface of the CdS NWs is exposed accordingly (denoted as CCS-3) (Fig. S6c and d). Using the hetero-nanostructure as a photocatalyst, the sufficient exposure of the surface is significant for enhanced photocatalytic activity in terms of light harvesting and synergistic effect. For comparison, Co1-xS HPs were prepared from ZIF-67 polyhedrons without the presence of CdS NWs (Fig. S6e and f). The composition and constitution of the four samples above are further confirmed by the FESEM-EDS analysis (Fig. S7). Moreover, the ratio of Co and S for all the as-prepared samples are basically unchanged after deducting the proportion of S coordinated with CdS, (about 0.7), indicating the presence of abundant Co vacancies in Co1-xS. To further support the presence of Co vacancies in Co1-xS HPs, Raman spectra of the CCS-2 HHNSs, Co1-xS HPs, and CdS/CoS hybrids are presented in Fig. S8. Compared with CdS/CoS, a redshift and broadening appeared in the vibration modes for the CdS/Co1–xS HHNSs and Co1–xS HPs, further verifying the presence of Co vacancy [34]. The Co vacancies would change local atomic configuration and thus modulate the electronic structure, and act as active sites as well to adsorb and activate inset molecules and facilitate the catalytic processes [34,35]. The electronic band structure of the CCS HHNSs is examined by UV–vis DRS and Mott-Schottky measurements. The UV–vis DRS shows that the CdS NWs only absorb the light of wavelength below about 530 nm (Fig. 4 a), while the Co1-xS HPs exhibit strong full-spectrum absorption due to multiple scattering/reflection of light in the hollow structure. Benefiting from the introduction of Co1-xS HPs, all the CCS HHNSs broaden solar light absorption from the ultraviolent to near infrared region in comparison with CdS NWs, giving a full spectrum response. Such improvement enables the HHNSs to substantially utilize visible light to drive chemical reactions. Moreover, the band gaps (E g) of two semiconductors are determined from the corresponding Tauc plots to be 2.30 eV for CdS NWs and 1.25 eV for Co1-xS HPs (Fig. 4b and c) [36]. Such band configuration makes the two semiconductors meet the primary requirement for constructing a Z-scheme system: E g < 3 eV [37]. The Mott-Schottky plots reveal the derived flat-band potential of the Co1-xS HPs is −0.90 eV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential, more negative than that of CdS (−0.50 eV vs. RHE) (Fig. 4d and e). The CB energy (E CB) of both the semiconductors are determined accordingly. The valence band (VB) energy (E VB) of Co1-xS HPs and CdS NWs were calculated from E CB + E g and located at 0.35 and 1.80 eV (vs. RHE), respectively. The energy band alignment (vs. RHE) is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4f. According to the band configuration of the CCS HHNSs, the interfacial charge transfer takes place in the direct Z-scheme pathway under light irradiation. In addition, low E g indicates high conductivity of Co1-xS HPs relative to CdS NWs. That is, the photoelectrons can be transferred from CdS to Co1-xS, which participates the surface reactions. To elucidate the interfacial charge transfer mechanism in the CSS HHNSs under irradiation, in-situ irradiated XPS is employed to accurately reflect the charge transfer pathway [38,39]. Without light irradiation, the XPS survey spectrum of the as-prepared CCS-2 HHNSs confirms the existence of Cd, Co and S elements in the heterostructures (Fig. S9). The atomic rate of Co and S is determined to be about 0.6 for Co1-xS, lower than that (0.7) by FESEM-EDS, implying most Co vacancies are located at the (sub-)surface of the HPs. The Cd 3d high-resolution spectrum shows two symmetry peaks at 411.9 and 405.2 eV, which correspond to Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, being the signature of Cd2+ (Fig. 5 a) [38]. In contrast, the XPS high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p orbital region displays several asymmetry peaks, which can be deconvoluted into three components: Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 779.1 and 794.2 eV from Co3+, Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 781.2 and 796.3 eV from Co2+, and satellite peaks, respectively (Fig. 5b) [21,40]. The co-existence of Co3+ and Co2+ corresponds to the identification of Co1-xS by the SAED, HRTEM and FESEM-EDS analysis, demonstrating further the existence of Co vacancy. With light irradiation, the CCS-2 HHNSs show similar Cd 3d and Co 2p XPS high-resolution spectra to the samples without irradiation, while some obvious shifts in binding energy can be observed. All Cd 3d peaks are shifted towards higher binding energies (by + 0.2 eV), indicating reduced electron density for CdS NWs. In contrast, all the peaks of Co 2p are shifted to lower binding energy (by −0.1 eV for Co3+, by −0.3 eV for Co2+), signifying the increased electron density on Co1-xS HPs. By contrast, there are hardly change in binding energy observed for the pure CdS NWs and Co1-xS HPs with/without light irradiation, respectively (Fig. S10). Taken together, it can be concluded that the electrons are excited from the VB to CB of CdS under irradiation, and then transfer to Co1-xS across the interface of two semiconductors to combine with h+, confirming the Z-scheme system rather than the type-II transfer pathway. Upon confirming the advantages of the CdS/Co1-xS HHNSs on photocatalysis, we employed the photoreduction reaction of H2O as the model reaction to assess the catalytic activity of the as-prepared HHNSs. The photocatalytic H2 production test was conducted under visible-light irridation in 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 20% lactic acid as the sacrificial agent. Fig. 6 a compares the photocatalytic H2 production activity of CCS-1, CCS-2, and CCS-3 HHNSs, bare Co1-xS HPs, and CdS NWs. Obviously, the photocatalytic H2 production rate of all the as-prepared HHNSs significantly outperforms that of single-component catalysts. In particular, the CCS-2 HHNSs achieve a H2 production rate of 13.48 mmol g−1 h−1, 24-fold higher than that of CdS NWs (0.56 mmol g−1 h−1) (Fig. 6b). The enhanced catalytic activity can be rationalized in terms of high specific surface area, the exposure of lots of sides, facets and Co vacancies on HPs, as well as the Z-scheme transfer pathway of photoexcited charge carriers [21]. However, less or more loading of Co1-xS in the hetero-nanostructure (CCS-1 or CCS-3 HHNSs) would induce negative effects on the photocatalytic activity, resulting in a reduced rate of H2 production. Such reduction may be ascribed to the insufficient exposure of CdS NWs, which impedes the light absorption ability of the HHNSs and thus retards the process of interfacial charge transfer. In addition, we further assess another crucial parameter for photocatalysis, durability. As shown in Fig. 6c, the high H2 production rate is well maintained during four cyclic tests with each run for 5 h. The sample characterizations after cyclic tests show the CCS-2 HHNSs retain the hollow sugar-gourd-shaped morphology (Fig. S11) and unchanged phase composition (Fig. S12a), indicating high structural stability and good reusability. The XPS survey spectra of the CCS-2 NNHSs before and after photocatalytic tests display a similar profile (Fig. S12b). Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d and Co 2p show no obvious shift in binding energy as well (Fig. S12c and d). Taken together, it can be concluded that the CCS-2 HHNSs exhibit the excellent chemical stability in the photocatalytic process. To evaluate the light utilization efficiency, the wavelength-dependent AQEs of the CCS-2 HHNSs are determined by measuring the amount of generated H2 under various monochromatic light irradiation (Fig. 6d). The AQE at 420 nm is determined to be 10.2%, which is also comparable to previously reported photocatalysts (Table S1). To our best knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the superior photocatalytic H2 generation with Co1-xS-based HHNSs which can be a promising candidate for photocatalytic water reduction. To further confirm the Z-scheme transfer mechanism and thus enhanced photocatalytic performance, we performed a series of photoelectrochemical and electrochemical measurements with the as-prepared CCS HHNSs and bare CdS NWs. Fig. 7 a displays the PL spectra of these samples. It is clear that the bare CdS NWs show a strong PL emission at about 520 nm, while combined with Co1-xS HPs, the PL intensity are remarkably reduced for all heterostructures. The reduction suggests the introduction of Co1-xS HPs changes the electron transfer pathway across the interface and thus reduces the recombination kinetics of photogenerated charge carriers [41]. The CCS-2 HHNSs exhibit the weakest PL intensity among three heterostructures, confirming the importance of moderate Co1-xS loading on individual CdS NW for substantially promoting the photoelectrical conversion efficiency. This can be verified further by the surface photocurrent (SPC) response in terms of the light wavelength characterized by surface photocurrent spectrum (Fig. 7b) [42]. All samples only display the SPC signal below about 530 nm, corresponding to the requirement of simultaneous excitation of both semiconductors in the Z-scheme system. However, all the HHNSs display remarkably enhanced SPC as compared with CdS NWs. In particular, the highest value is achieved with the CCS-2 HHNSs, demonstrating the best photoelectrical efficiency. Under visible-light radiation, a similar trend of current density over the four samples is also observed (Fig. 7c). The CCS-2 HHNSs give the highest current density among four samples, suggesting the best separation efficiency of e−-h+ pairs [43]. Moreover, the enhanced photocurrent response can reproducibly increase under each photoirradiation and quickly recover in the dark. Furthermore, we perform the EIS measurements to examine the interfacial charge transfer kinetics [44,45]. The diameter of the semi-circle in a Nyquist plot is proportional to the charge-transfer resistance of a sample, providing valuable information on charge transfer processes. As shown in Fig. 7d, the semi-circular Nyquist plots have the largest diameter for CdS NWs, but display significantly decreased diameters for all the CCS HHNSs especially with the smallest diameter for the CCS-2 sample, implying the charge-transfer barrier is reduced mostly in the HHNSs. In particularly, the fitting results from EIS illustrate the CCS-2 HHNSs possess the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) among all the heterostructures (Table S2), which further confirms the fast electron transfer kinetics and thus efficient separation of photogenerated e−-h+ pairs."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, we have synthesized a sugar-gourd-shaped CdS/Co1-xS HHNS by growing Co-deficiency Co1-xS HPs on CdS NWs as an efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst for H2 production. The loading amount of Co1-xS on an individual CdS NW could be modulated by varying the ratio of ZIF-67 precursor to CdS NWs in sulfidation treatment, and a H2 production rate of 13.48 mmol g−1 h−1 has been achieved with the optimized CCS-2 HHNSs under visible-light irradiation. The unique photocatalytic activity is attributed to the coupling of CdS NWs with Co1-xS HPs, which endows the heterostructure with full spectrum response and large surface area with lots of sides, facets to expose active sites. More importantly, the band structure configuration of the heterostructure efficiently facilitate the separation of photoexcited e−-h+ pairs through the Z-scheme transfer mechanism and lead to strong photoreduction ability due to the lower aligned CB of the Co1-xS HPs. With all these advantages integrated, the CCS HHNSs significantly expedite the photocatalytic H2 production process. This work provides fresh insights into the construction of Z-Scheme unusual hollow nanostructures as efficient photocatalysts by the means of morphology design and electronic structure modulation."
