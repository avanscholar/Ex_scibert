0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and carboxylic acids is of critical importance to fine chemicals production. At industrial scale, the oxidation processes were conducted for decades to oxidize toxic organic solvents by deploying hazardous oxidants at least in stoichiometric amounts [ 1 ]. While the gas-phase oxidation of simple alcohol molecules has been well practiced, the limitations due to requirements for adequate volatility as well as thermal stability of reactants and products, have directed research to liquid catalytic oxidation processes at mild conditions (temperatures <150 °C, low oxygen pressures) [ 2 ]. Benzaldehyde has been extensively used in plastic, pharmaceutical, and agrochemicals industry [ 3 ]. It has been traditionally produced by the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride or vapor/liquid oxidation of toluene [ 4 , 5 ]. At present these processes have little industrial importance and have a major drawback of low conversion to achieve high selectivity. Alternatively, the production through the liquid-phase aerobic catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol by oxygen using solid catalysts, presents an environmentally sustainable alternative route [ 6 ]. Typically, Pd, Pt, and Au metals supported on various metal oxides such as TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and CeO2, have been tested as catalysts, exhibiting promising behavior in terms of both conversion and selectivity [ 7 , 8 ]. For example, Enache et al. synthesized Au-Pd/TiO2, which showed excellent catalytic activity at temperatures between 100 and 160 °C under oxygen pressures in the range of 1–10 bar [ 9 ]. However, the deployment of such catalysts at industrial level is rather unfeasible due to the scarcity and consequently prohibitive cost of noble metals [ 10 ]. In 2001, Son et al. reported the successful catalytic oxidation of alcohols in the liquid phase using MnOx as catalyst and O2 from air as oxidant [ 11 ]. According to the authors, the oxidation could be described by a redox mechanism according to which, Mn4+ reduces to Mn3+ and then it is re-oxidized by O2. The same group further showed that the oxidation followed a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism with the lattice oxygen of the manganese octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) participating in the reaction and being replenished by the fluid-phase O2 [ 12 ]. In fact, one of the crystal phases of MnO2, alpha-phase MnO2, consists of 2 × 2 (4.6 × 4.6 Å) tunnels constructed from double chains of octahedra [MnO6] is a promising catalyst for oxidation reactions [ 13 ]. The tunnel cavity, moderately acidic sites as well as easy release of lattice oxygen of MnO2 have rendered it promising for various applications [ 14 ]. This was confirmed by Su et al. [ 15 ] who showed that among the different manganese oxides, α-MnO2 exhibits a superior catalytic activity in the oxidation of benzyl-alcohol by O2 under microwave radiation. It is believed in general that the Mn oxidation state, local symmetry and active site-support interaction, play a defining role in the catalytic activity. Apart from manganese, cobalt oxides (i.e. Co3O4) have been evaluated in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol [ 16 ]. Co3O4 nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed on activated carbon by Zhu et al. [ 17 ] and showed ~100% benzyl alcohol conversion as well as 87.3% aldehyde selectivity at 80 °C and atmospheric pressure, with the catalyst exhibiting no significant activity loss even after 4 cycles. Octahedral Co3O4 nanocrystals have been utilized by Teng et al. [ 18 ], and the incorporation of nanoparticles on alumina [ 19 ] and hydrotalcite [ 20 ] has resulted in promising results with respect to conversion, selectivity, stability and recyclability. Interestingly, Kamimura et al. [ 21 ] prepared cobalt doped MnO2, which showed up to 89% yield of benzaldehyde at 110 °C under oxygen atmosphere. This verifies, that Co could function as a promoter for the redox behavior of Mn3+/Mn4+ in the presence of oxygen, which is responsible for the conversion of benzyl-alcohol to benzaldehyde. Herein, we report the employment of Co3O4-decorated α-MnO2 nanotubes for the liquid-phase benzyl-alcohol oxidation in the presence of O2. The aim of the study was to exploit the synergy between manganese and cobalt oxides, as well as take advantage of a potentially favorable α-MnO2 morphology, that could significantly boost the oxidation process. Further, the prepared catalysts were thoroughly characterized to enable the elucidation of the oxidation mechanism."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization α-MnO2 nanotubes were prepared hydrothermally via the reduction of KMnO4. A solution of 0.66 g KMnO4, 1.5 mL HCl and 75 mL deionized water (DI-H2O) was stirred at room temperature (RT) to form a homogeneous mixed solution. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 150 °C for 10 h. After it was cooled down naturally to RT, the reaction product was centrifuged and vacuum dried overnight. Following the synthesis of α-MnO2 nanotubes, the decoration with Co3O4 nanoparticles was carried out via a low-temperature hydrothermal method. 5.82 g Co(NO3)3·6H2O (source of Co), 6 g CO(NH2)2 (use as template), 0.5 g α-MnO2 as well as 150 mL DI-H2O and 50 mL CH3CH2OH were added into a solution that was strongly stirred at 80 °C for 2 h. After the process was completed, the product was centrifuged, vacuum dried overnight and finally calcined at 350 °C under air for 2 h with a heating ramp of 2 °C min−1. With the decorating process, Co3O4 was successfully coated on MnO2 nanotubes (represented as Co3O4/MnO2) with a 20 wt%, which was validated by microwave plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (MP-AES) analysis. Materials and characterization details are discussed in supporting information."
3,Catalytic activity test,"2.2 Catalytic activity test In a typical reaction, 1 mmol of benzyl alcohol, 25 mg of Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst (equals to 291 μmoles (62 μmoles Co + 229 μmoles Mn)) and 10 mL of solvent were added to a 50 mL round bottom flask with a reflux condenser. For compassion purpose, we have used 291 μmoles of Mn (equals to 25.32 mg of MnO2) and Co (equals to 51.51 mg of Co3O4) for the same reaction. The oxygen gas was supplied to the reaction system with a 10 mL/min flow rate. The reaction was carried out at different temperatures and times. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by undergoing centrifugation and was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The decoration of Co3O4 nanoparticles on MnO2 nanotubes was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1 shows the morphologies of MnO2 and Co3O4/MnO2 catalysts, confirming that the MnO2 particles possessed a nano-tubular shape. The average length and diameter of the MnO2 nanotubes was calculated 3 ± 2 μm and 60 ± 20 nm, respectively. Fig. 1 clearly shows that the Co3O4 nanoparticles (25 ± 5 nm) were well dispersed on the surface of MnO2 nanotubes. For comparison, pure Co3O4 nanoparticles size was determined from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and shown in Fig. S1. It was found that the average particle sizes of Co3O4 was 30 ± 2 nm. Moreover, the energy dispersive X-Ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping (Fig. S2) confirmed the presence of Mn, Co, and O elements on the surface of Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst. The TEM and high-resolution electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of MnO2 nanotubes are displayed in Fig. S3(a-c), respectively. As it can be observed in Fig. S3a-b, MnO2 comprises of a nanotubular morphology. Further, in Fig. S2c, the calculated lattice d-spacing of 0.69 nm may be attributed to (110) crystal plane of alpha-MnO2 phase [ 22 ]. Fig. 2 shows the TEM, HR-TEM, and fast Fourier transform (FFT) images of hybrid Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst. The Co3O4 nanoparticles were well-dispersed on the surface of MnO2 nanotubes and it was further confirmed that an interface was formed between the Co3O4 nanoparticles and MnO2 nanotubes. The corresponding HR-TEM image displays the interplanar d-spacing values of 0.28 nm and 0.69 nm, which are in good agreement with the (220) and (110) crystal planes of Co3O4 and MnO2 phases, respectively [ 22 , 23 ]. Also, the corresponding FFT image shows the coexistence of MnO2 and Co3O4 phases in the hybrid catalyst. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of MnO2, Co3O4/MnO2, and Co3O4 are shown in Fig. 3 . The diffraction lines appeared for pure MnO2 and Co3O4 catalysts can be attributed to the pure phase of alpha-MnO2 and Co3O4, respectively [ 14 , 24 ]. As expected, for the Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst, there are six peaks at 18.7, 32, 38, 54.3, 59.3 and 66.7° along with MnO2 diffraction peaks, which can be attributed to the Co3O4 phase, indicating the formation of hybrid Co3O4/MnO2. The N2 sorption isotherms of MnO2, Co3O4/MnO2, and Co3O4 catalysts are displayed in Fig. S4. All catalysts manifested a type III isotherm with the surface of pure MnO2 nanotubes being 33.3 m2 g−1. This was decreased to 25.8 m2 g−1 upon the decoration with Co3O4 nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to determine the oxidation states and surface atomic ratios of elements in the developed catalysts. Fig. S5a shows the O 1 s XPS spectra of MnO2, Co3O4/MnO2, and Co3O4 catalysts. The surface atomic ratios of Mn, Co, and O for the catalysts are displayed in Table S2. All catalysts displayed three types of oxygen species that were attributed to lattice oxygen (OA, 529.5˗529.7 eV), surface adsorbed oxygen species (OB, 531.4˗531.9 eV), and oxygen associated with surface hydroxyl or carbonate species (OC, 532.6˗533.7 eV) [ 25 ]. Among the three catalysts, the hybrid Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst showed the highest concentration of surface atomic oxygen (47.14%) species, followed by the pure MnO2 (31%) and Co3O4 (24.32%) catalysts. Many reports have suggested that the presence of these surface-active oxygen species offer facile oxidation reaction sites [ 26 , 27 ]. Hence, the as-prepared Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst could be expected to exhibit an enhanced catalytic performance when compared to its pure counterparts. Fig. S5b shows the Mn 2p spectra of MnO2 and Co3O4/MnO2 catalysts. Pure MnO2 displayed one peak attributable to Mn4+ (642.2 eV), confirming that Mn4+ was the main valance state of manganese in MnO2 [ 28 ]. Mn 2p XPS spectrum of Co3O4/MnO2 was deconvoluted into two components. These could be attributed to Mn4+ (642.0 eV) and Mn3+ (640.2 eV) oxidation states, respectively [ 29 ]. The co-existence of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions means that the oxygen vacancies are generated due to the process of charge compensation in MnO2 lattice [ 30 ]. The Co 2p XPS spectra of Co3O4 and Co3O4/MnO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. S5c. The two peaks appearing at 779.8 eV and 781.7 eV may be attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, indicating in this way that Co ion existed in two different oxidation states (+3 and + 2) [ 29 , 30 ]. It is postulated that the presence of variable oxidation states (Mn4+/Mn3+ and Co3+/Co2+) along with the oxygen deficiency could enhance catalytic performance in Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst. Hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was used to investigate the redox properties of the as-prepared catalysts. H2-TPR patterns of MnO2, Co3O4/MnO2, and Co3O4 catalysts are shown in Fig. S6. Pure MnO2 showed a broad peak, centered at 362 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of MnO2 to MnO with Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 as the intermediates, which was similar with other reported MnO2 systems [ 31 , 32 ]. Besides, pure Co3O4 catalyst exhibits broad peak at 379 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and metallic Co [ 33 ]. Interestingly, the hybrid Co3O4/MnO2 showed the reduction peak of MnO2 at 309 °C, whereas the reduction of cobalt oxide peak in between 350 and 550 °C. The observed low temperature peaks of hybrid Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst compared to its counterparts can be referred to the synergistic interaction between Co3O4 and MnO2."
6,Catalytic activity results,"3.2 Catalytic activity results The catalytic activities of MnO2, Co3O4/MnO2, and Co3O4 were tested in benzyl alcohol oxidation under the presence of O2. Table 1 illustrates the influence of reaction time in regard to various catalysts' performance toward benzyl alcohol oxidation. Initially, the benzyl alcohol was chosen for a model substrate and the oxidation reaction was performed at room temperature for 6 h in the absence of catalysts and solvents. However, no conversion of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol was observed. The same reaction was then conducted under the same conditions except that gaseous O2 was introduced to the reaction at atmospheric pressure. The conversion of benzyl alcohol approached 1.9% with 81% of selectivity. Further, to determine the temperature effect, the reaction was carried out at 100 °C under air, with the product conversion increasing to 4.1%. The reactions using pure MnO2 and Co3O4 as well as Co3O4/MnO2 were carried out in DMF solvent for 6 h at 100 °C in O2. As shown in Table 1, the product conversion was raised to 58, 51, and 89%, respectively, indicating that the conversion and formation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol with Co3O4/α-MnO2 was more efficient than the respective pure catalysts i.e., MnO2 and Co3O4. No additional conversion was observed by increasing the reaction time from 6 to 12 h. Furthermore, it was reported that the polarity and dipole moment of the solvents can play pivotal role in oxidation reaction [ 34 ]. Thus, aprotic polar and non-polar solvents are used to determine the solvent effect on the oxidation reaction. Different solvents like acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane, toluene, and THF were screened out to determine possible effects when using Co3O4/α-MnO2 at 100 °C for a 6 h reaction period. It was observed that the maximum conversion (93%) of benzaldehyde was found in the presence of medium polarity with low dipole moment having 1,4-dioxane, with 99% selectivity. In catalytic reactions, the required amount of catalyst may also play a pivotal role especially on large scale industrial processes. In our study, no significant changes were detected by increasing the catalyst amount from 50 to 100 mg. This indicates that the lowest amount of catalyst loading was enough to carry out the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction under the selected conditions. Furthermore, the effects of functional groups were investigated by introducing various substituents i.e., 4-OMe, 3,4-OMe, 3,4,5-OMe, F, Cl and NO2 under the same reaction conditions (Table 2 ). The conversion increased in the presence of electron donating groups, while it decreased when the electron withdrawing groups were present. Therefore, it can be argued that the electron donating groups such as methoxy favored the oxidation reaction. The repeatability of catalyst was investigated by using the Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst 4 times. In each cycle, the catalyst was washed with 1,4-dioxane and dried at 80 °C and reused for the next cycle. The results reported in Fig. 4 show that the catalyst exhibited 80% conversion and 73% selectivity after 4 cycles. Further, the leaching experiment was conducted by testing the filtered solution for benzyl alcohol oxidation after each cycle. The solution did not show any activity, which confirms that the as-prepared hybrid catalyst was not leached and stable during the reaction. The stability of used Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst was validated by further characterization (XRD and SEM). As shown in Fig. S7, the XRD pattern of used Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst is similar to fresh catalyst, which confirms that the crystallinity of material is not changed. The morphology of Co3O4/MnO2 (Fig. S8a-b) indicates that the nanotubular morphology was not perturbed during the reaction. To further elucidate the reaction mechanism over Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst, XPS analysis was performed. The XPS spectra of the used catalyst was shown in Fig. S5. The calculated surface atomic ratios of Mn4+/Mn3+, Co3+/Co2+, and OB + OC/OA for the used Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst are compared with the fresh catalyst. As shown Table S2, the ratio of Mn4+/Mn3+ decreased after benzyl alcohol oxidation, whereas the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ increased. It indicates that the redox reaction between Mn and Co (Mn4+ + Co2+ ↔ Mn3+ + Co3+) was benefited benzyl alcohol oxidation. Further, the decreased in ratio of OB + OC/OA indicates that the surface oxygen also participated in the reaction process. Based on these results, the plausible reaction mechanism of benzyl alcohol oxidation by Co3O4/MnO2 to benzaldehyde was illustrated by the schematic presented in Fig. 5 . First, the benzyl alcohol molecules are absorbed on the surface of Co3O4/MnO2 due to the presence of abundant surface-active oxygen species. Then, the presence of surface oxygen species leads to the activation of molecular oxygen (O2) due to the redox reaction between Mn and Co. Consequently, the absorbed benzyl alcohol molecules transform into benzaldehyde and H2O by the active oxygen species on Co3O4/MnO2. Moreover, Mn(OH)2 undergoes rapid oxidation in the presence of O2 to give back MnO2 [ 11 ]. Thus, the hybrid catalyst becomes reusable for application in subsequent reaction cycles. During the reaction, the ability to activate O2 is critical for the catalytic activity. As discussed in the characterization section, the hybrid Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst manifested uniform dispersion of Mn, Co, and O elements, oxygen deficiency, good redox behaviour, abundant surface oxygen species, and variable oxidation states (Mn3+/4+ and Co2+/3+), which are all resulted due to the synergistic interaction between Co3O4 and MnO2."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, we have reported that highly dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles on the surface MnO2 nanotubes may act as an efficient catalyst for benzyl alcohol oxidation. The hybrid Co3O4/MnO2 catalyst was able to oxidize different functional groups containing benzyl alcohol with excellent conversion and selectivity efficiency. Moreover, the hybrid catalyst displayed good repeatability and stability after the reaction. The highest catalytic performance was reported in the absence of soft oxidants such as TBHP and H2O2, clearly demonstrating the green nature of the catalyst. The surface oxygen species, better redox behaviour, and variable oxidation states of Co3O4/MnO2 hybrid catalyst, were responsible for its enhanced activity as compared to its pure constituents."
