0,Introduction,"Biohydrogen production by photo- and non-photosynthetic bacteria has been studied extensively [1–7]. In contrast to photolytic production of H 2 , fermentative processes for H 2 production have the advantages of high hydrogen producing rate without illumination and of the capability to convert organic wastes into more valuable energy source [8]. Bacteria capable of generating hydrogen in dark fermentation include species of Enterobacter, Bacillus and Clostridium. Enterobacter aerogenes mutant strain VP-1 with decreased-acetolactate synthase activity showed a high H 2 yield of 1.8mol/mol-glucose with decreased lactate and increased succinate yields [9]. Hydrogen production from damaged wheat grains by Bacillus licheniformis in continuous culture over a 40 days period, achieved low yields [10]. Clostridium thermolacticum growing on lactose obtained hydrogen specific production higher than 5mmol H 2 / ( g cell ) / h [11]. During anaerobic acidogenic fermentations hydrogen is accompanied together with liquid end-products. If one composition in the liquid end-products is changed by one environmental factor, the amount of hydrogen gas was altered consequently. Since H 2 yield is dependent on the fermentation pathway and end-products, hydrogen production by fermentation is highly reliant on the process conditions such as pH [12], hydraulic retention time (HRT), nutrient levels [13,14,7], stirring [15], levels of carbon dioxide [16], shock loads [17], metabolites in liquid phase [18], and gas partial pressure [19], which affect metabolic balance. Since nutrient availability and metabolites accumulation may often result in growth limitation and consequent inhibition of hydrogen production, there is need to obtain the precise quantification of the extent to which each phenomenon contributes to overall growth and hydrogen production behavior. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize precisely the possible role of each nutrient (glucose, soluble proteins and ions) and identified fermentation product on the growth response observed throughout the fermentation of hydrogen-producing fermentative bacterial B49."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbes and culture,"1.1 Microbes and culture The microorganism used in this study was a pure strain of hydrogen-producing bacteria obtained from Research Center of Environmental Biotechnology, Harbin Institute of Technology. It was isolated from anaerobic activated sludge and named hydrogen-producing bacterial strain B49. Based on 16S rDNA complete sequence, HPB B49 is the most similar to Clostridium cellulosi. But their identity is only 94% (AF481148 in EMBL), and B49 could not form spores. B49 was identified as a new bacteria by 16s rDNA. It was cultured under the anaerobic condition of 35 ± 1 ∘ C and initial pH value of 6.0. The bacterium was routinely transferred into a basal medium consisting of (in g/l) 10 glucose, 4 polypepton, 2 beef extract, 1 yeast extract, 4 NaCl, 1.5 K 2 HPO 4 , 0.2 MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.1 FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.5 L-cysteine, trace element solution, 10ml vitamin solution, 10ml 0.2% (W/V) resazurin, 0.5ml. The trace element solution contained (in g/l): MnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.01; ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.05; H 3 BO 3 , 0.01; N ( CH 2 COOH ) 3 , 4.5; CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O , 0.01; Na 2 MoO 4 , 0.01; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.2; AlK ( SO 4 ) 2 , 0.01. The composition of vitamin solution was (in g/l): riboflavin 0.025; citric acid 0.02; folic acid 0.01; para-aminobenzoic acid 0.01. The anaerobic culture technique used was that proposed by Hungate [20] as modified by Bryant [21]."
3,Hydrogen production in batch culture,1.2 Hydrogen production in batch culture An isolated bacterium was cultured in 100ml of basal medium anaerobically at 35°C for 18h. The optical density ( OD 600 nm ) of cells was about 1.14. Five milliliters of the precultured broth was inoculated into an Erlenmeyer flask containing 95ml of basal medium. The experiments were performed under a mesophilic condition of 35 ± 1 ∘ C using a 150ml of Erlenmeyer flask as a batch reactor (Fig. 1 ). The reactors were cultivated in a rotary cell culture rotated at 120rpm to provide release of gas and better contact between nutrients and bacteria. The gas phase was sparged with nitrogen gas.
4,Analytical methods,"1.3 Analytical methods The procedures described in Standard Methods [22] were used to determine pH. The composition in biogas was analyzed by SP-2305 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2-m stainless column packed with Porapak TDS-01 (60/80 mesh). The operational temperatures at the column oven and the detector were both 150°C. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 70ml/min. The cell growth was measured in terms of OD at 600nm. Glucose concentration in culture was determined according to the method of glucose kit. The protein concentration was colorimetrically measured by the method of Markwell with bovine serum albumin as the standard [23]. Polysaccharide was assayed by the method of Gamar-Nourani [24]. Insoluble substances were separated by centrifugation at 5000rpm for 15min. The supernatant was acidified with 6mmol/l HCl for analysis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols and iron. The concentrations of the VFAs were determined using a model GC-122 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and a 2-m stainless (5-mm inside diameter) column packed with Porapak GDX-103 (60/80 mesh). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the column and the detector were 220, 190 and 220°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at flow rate of 50ml/min [8]. Iron and magnesium concentrations were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (Thermo Jarrell Ash) using a wavelength of 238.20 and 279.55nm, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Growth and hydrogen production by HPB B49 on glucose,"2.1 Growth and hydrogen production by HPB B49 on glucose In Fig. 2 (a) the time course of cell growth is shown. With glucose and soluble protein consumed, the cells grew well. The pH value decreased rapidly (Fig. 2(c)) and the liquid end-products from glucose decomposition increased as the bacteria grew (Fig. 2(b)). Acetate and ethanol were the main liquid end-products from glucose degradation. After 19h incubation acetate and ethanol were 2423.14 and 2807.29mg/l, respectively. Lactic acid was less than 4% of the total amount of liquid end-products. Propionate and butyrate were not detected during the incubation. The accumulated volume of hydrogen evolved by HPB B49 is shown in Fig. 2(c). As the cell number increased rapidly in the logarithmic stage, the rate of hydrogen evolution was accelerated. The amount of cumulative hydrogen between pH 4.0 and pH 3.7 was more than 50% of the overall hydrogen production. The glucose and soluble protein consumption curve was consistent with the hydrogen evolution curve and cell growth. This meant that the evolution of hydrogen ran parallel with the decomposition of nutrients and the concentration of metabolites increased. It is interesting to note that little change in liquid end-products was observed. Moreover, the increased quantity of ethanol was similar to that of acetate at low pH. This suggests that the shift of metabolic pathway might not exist. However, it was different from E. aerogens strain E.82005 reported by Tanisho et al. [25]. Below pH 5.8 the change of metabolic pathway from acid production to non-acid production by E. aerogens strain E.82005 was found."
7,Effect of gaseous end-products inhibition on growth and hydrogen production,"2.2 Effect of gaseous end-products inhibition on growth and hydrogen production Hydrogen and carbon dioxide were not only the by-products of acetate and ethanol but also the primary composition in the mixed biogas. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide production was correlated to gas partial pressure. Moreover, hydrogen partial pressure (p H 2 ) and carbon dioxide partial pressure ( pCO 2 ) in the gas phase are one of the key factors affecting hydrogen production. In order to understand their influential behaviors, hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide gas and nitrogen gas, respectively, were used to sparge the headspace of the reactor at the start of the experiments. HPB B49 grew under 101kPa of pH 2 , pCO 2 and pN 2 , respectively. As shown in Table 1 , HPB B49 in the Erlenmeyer flask sparged with hydrogen gas could produce hydrogen under such high hydrogen pressure. The amount of hydrogen evolved was 2100.9ml H 2 / l culture, which was almost equal to that in the Erlenmeyer flask sparged with nitrogen gas. Moreover, the difference in liquid end-products, OD and pH between the two runs was less. In general, hydrogen synthesis pathways are sensitive to H 2 concentrations and are subject to end-product inhibition. As H 2 concentrations increase, H 2 synthesis decreases and metabolic pathways shift to production of more reduced substrates such as lactate, ethanol, etc. [26]. It should be noted that, as a matter of fact, hydrogen partial pressure had no influence on the growth rate and hydrogen production by HPB B49, which is very important for implementation of HPB B49 to commercial engineering. It was also observed from Table 1 that HPB B49 in the Erlenmeyer flask sparged with carbon dioxide gas performed badly compared with that in the Erlenmeyer flask sparged with nitrogen gas. The amount of hydrogen evolved was 1824.6ml H 2 / l culture. These results demonstrated that the presence of carbon dioxide could inhibit the growth and hydrogen production by HPB B49. From the view of hydrogen production mechanism, the NADH pathway is one of the important pathways for hydrogen production. In this pathway hydrogen is evolved by the re-oxidation of NADH [16]. The availability of carbon dioxide determines the production of succinate and formate, which consume NADH, and subsequently decrease the production of hydrogen. For a better understanding the influential behaviors of CO 2 , the inhibitory mechanism will be determined in future studies. Although the influential mechanism of carbon dioxide on the HPB B49 was not clear, and it seemed that unidentified compounds produced during the fermentation might have an important inhibitory effect on the growth, the removal of carbon dioxide is necessary for increasing the hydrogen production due to more availability of NADH."
8,Effect of iron concentration on growth and hydrogen production,"2.3 Effect of iron concentration on growth and hydrogen production The effect of iron on glucose metabolism in HPB B49 is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 . In the case of 10mg/l of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , HPB B49 could consume glucose completely with a hydrogen volume of 1816.3ml H 2 / l culture, a yield of 1666.78mg/l acetate and 2590.72mg/l ethanol. The ratio of ethanol to acetate was 1.55. In the case of 80mg/l of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , HPB B49 also consumed glucose completely and produced 2360.5ml H 2 / l culture of hydrogen, 2055.15mg/l acetate and 2688.58mg/l ethanol. The ration of ethanol to acetate was decreased to 1.31. But the final hydrogen yield and biomass of OD 600 nm increased 30% and 18.6%, respectively (Table 2). During the course of fermentative hydrogen production, the accumulative amount of hydrogen evolved and the concentrations of ethanol and acetate in the case of 80mg/l FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O were higher than those in the case of 10mg/l FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O (Fig. 3(a)). But the increase in ethanol was less, whereas the increase in acetate was more (Fig. 3(b and c)). From these results it was assumed that iron could affect the metabolic pathway and the hydrogen-producing capacity of HPB B49. The effect of iron on metabolism of HPB B49 is similar to that on Clostridium acetobutylicum [27]. The concentration of ethanol was higher than that of acetate at the end of fermentation in both cases. These were different from the liquid end-products of Clostridium cellulolyticum [28], where acetate was the main product, ethanol and lactate were low. The increase in ethanol meant decrease in hydrogen production by C. cellulolyticum. HPB B49 produced high amount of ethanol, but possessed high hydrogen-producing capacity. The reason for these phenomena was because HPB B49 might be a novel genus. The two species of bacteria may have different metabolic pathways. But the components of liquid end-products (ethanol, acetate, lactate) of the two bacteria are same. HPB B49 also produced minor lactate, which was less than 5% total amount of liquid end-products (data not shown). Moreover, based on 16S rDNA complete sequence, HPB B49 is more similar to Clostridium cellulosi. But their identity is only 94% (AF481148 in EMBL), and HPB B49 could not form spores. Briefly, the hydrogen-producing mechanism of HPB B49 needs further study."
9,Effect of magnesium concentration on growth and hydrogen production,"2.4 Effect of magnesium concentration on growth and hydrogen production Ten milligram per liter MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 100mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O and 200mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O were used to investigate the effect of magnesium on glucose metabolism in HPB B49. As given in Table 3 , with the increase in the concentration of magnesium, the amount of hydrogen evolved was enhanced. In the case of 10mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , HPB B49 produced 934.9ml H 2 / l culture. From Fig. 4 it could be seen that HPB B49 consumed 95.7% of magnesium at the fermentation time of 5h. At the end of fermentation residual glucose was 2g/l (Table 3), the OD 600 nm was only 0.46 and the concentrations of ethanol and acetate were low. However, in the other two cases, HPB B49 consumed glucose completely. In the case of 200mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , the amount of hydrogen evolved was 2360.5ml H 2 / l culture, whereas in the case of 100mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O it was 2113.8ml H 2 / l culture. In the case of 100mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O even when glucose consumption was 100%, because of relatively low magnesium concentration, the biomass, the concentrations of ethanol and acetate, and the ration of ethanol to acetate were all less than those in the case of 200mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O . However, the polysaccharide was 2.8mg/l, 12% more than that in 200mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O . It was shown in Fig. 4 that at a fermentation time of 5h only 19.8% of magnesium was consumed in the 200mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , which exceeded the amount demanded for 10mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O . Two hundred milligram per liter MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O could supply enough nutrition for the growth, and the OD 600 nm was up to 1.34. During the course of fermentative hydrogen production, the accumulative amount of hydrogen evolved (Fig. 5 a) was significantly enhanced under the condition of 200mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , whereas under the condition of 10mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O after 15h of incubation the hydrogen production was almost stopped. The concentrations of ethanol and acetate under the condition of 200mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O were higher than those under the condition of 10mg/l MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O (Fig. 5(b and c)). According to literature magnesium ion is an activator of many kinases and synthetases. In cytoplasm there are 10 kinds of enzymes involved in glycolysis, and most of these enzymes need magnesium ion as cofactors such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and enolase, etc. [29]. Magnesium is not only a cofactor of many enzymes but also components of cell wall and cell membrane. From these results it was concluded that shortage of magnesium could affect glycolysis, assimilation and hydrogen-producing capacity."
10,Conclusion,"Hydrogen production had a correlation with cell growth and consumption of glucose and soluble protein. Liquid end-products of fermentation, predominantly ethanol, acetate and in minor amounts lactate, accumulated in the medium. Gaseous end-products comprised hydrogen and carbon dioxides. Growth of the bacterium in fresh media sparged with hydrogen showed that the hydrogen partial pressure in the fermentor had no influence on the growth rate and hydrogen production by HPB B49. While growth of the bacterium in fresh media sparged with carbon dioxide demonstrated that the carbon dioxide partial pressure affected the growth rate and hydrogen production by HPB B49. Iron and magnesium ion could induce metabolic shift and affect the growth and the hydrogen production by HPB B49."
