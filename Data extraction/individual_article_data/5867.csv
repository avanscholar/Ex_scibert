0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels depletion, energy security and global warming have raised great concern for R&D to promote green and sustainable environment. For developing a green environment, the most important issue which needs attention is the reduction in the use of petroleum based fuels, and encourage biomass based fuels or biofuels. Biofuels such as bioethanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen from organic resources have been extensively studied [1]. Among these, biohydrogen is considered as the most clean and suitable energy carrier due to its high energy content and carbon neutral nature. Dark fermentation for hydrogen production from organic waste is seen as a viable technology to solve the energy related issues in the nearby future [2]. However, it is indicated that there are various technological constraints that need to be tackled to develop an economically feasible hydrogen production such as feedstock cost and availability, hydrogen generation rates, seed inoculum selection and reactor operation [1,3]. Of all these, feedstock selection and its further pretreatment are most crucial for the economical hydrogen production process. Biohydrogen production in continuous operation has been mostly investigated with wastewaters and organic rich carbohydrates in pure form such as sucrose, glucose and xylose. There are very few reports of utilizing lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) for biohydrogen production in continuous operation, which is poised to be the most feasible and sustainable future technology [3,4]. Although, the direct conversion of LCB to biohydrogen has been demonstrated by various authors [5,6], the hydrogen yield and the production rates were low. The main reasons could be recalcitrant nature of the lignocellulosic feedstocks and lack of cellulolytic enzymes for breaking the complex lignocellulosic heteropolymer matrix [7,8]. Moreover, raw waste addition to the bioreactor in continuous operation also has several limitations, such as incomplete mixing, clogging in pipes and the disposal issues. Nevertheless, pretreatment of LCB remains the major constrain and limiting factor, and is therefore an essential step to improve the LCB-to-hydrogen production process efficiency [3,9]. Biohydrogen production from LCB is mostly done by separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHP) process, wherein chemical (acid and alkali) or enzymatic mediated pretreatment has been used to obtain the hydrolyzate fraction [10]. Chemically (acid) derived hydrolyzate fraction from birch [11], wheat straw [12], oat straw [13] have been used as a substrate for the biohydrogen production. Recently, combined prehydrolysis by acid pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic saccharification is shown to be an efficient method for maximal sugar recovery [14] and further fermentation. In combined method, acid pretreatment increase the porosity and the crystallinity of the LCB making the enzyme saccharification process easier. Only few studies are reported for biohydrogen production from combined pretreated LCB hydrolyzate by mixed culture [15,19,20]. Pan et al. [15] hydrolyzed corn stalk with combined dilute acid (121°C, autoclave)-enzyme hydrolysis and reported the HY of 209.8mL/gTVS by anaerobic mixed culture. Arreola-Vargas et al. [16] reported HY of 2.3mol/mol hexose and hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.62L/L/d in a trickling bed bioreactor from enzyme-treated hydrolysate. In another study using combined pretreated hydrolyzate a maximum HPR of 5.5L/Ld and HY of 1.9mol/mol sugar is reported [17]. These reports, in general show higher hydrogen production from hydrolyzate prepared by combined method which minimizes the inhibitory compounds formation due to low temperature acid hydrolysis. Besides, the hydrolyzate contains higher fermentable sugar (glucose) owing to enzyme action on the residual cellulosic biomass. In the present study, de-oiled jatropha waste (DJW), a biodiesel industry residue and lignocellulosic in nature has been used as a feedstock for biohydrogen production. Previous studies on DJW have indicated it as a promising feedstock for methane and hydrogen production [18–20]. DJW predominantly contains three components represented as semi-crystalline cellulose, amorphous hemicellulose and lignin [14]. Direct utilization of DJW to hydrogen production is rate-limiting due to the complexity in the nature of DJW; thus proper hydrolysis method is required to recover the maximal sugars for efficient hydrogen production [14]. Being lignocellulosic in nature, DJW is also amenable to mild acid (HCl) hydrolysis for recovery of the sugars like other lignocellulosic wastes [21,22]. And in our previous study enzymatic saccharification of the acid pre-treated de-oiled jatropha waste produced a hydrolyzate having considerable sugar content [14]. The present study was conducted to study the continuous hydrogen production potential of the cello-lignin fraction in DJW. In most cases continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) operation is considered for continuous hydrogen fermentation due to easy operation and low operation cost. However, the main issue with CSTR operation is the cell washout at very short HRTs. This issue has been overcome using the immobilization technique to achieve a stable high rate hydrogen production [23–25]. The main advantages of the immobilized cells CSTR are complete mixing, intimate contact between the substrate and microflora, and effective pH and temperature control. Thus, considering these merits, hydrogen fermentation of the cello-lignin fraction of DJW was evaluated in immobilized cells CSTR to develop a robust and cost-effective process, with an emphasis on the utilization of the cello-lignin fraction (non-hydrolyzed biomass) of lignocellulosic wastes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Inoculum, immobilized cells, and feedstock preparation","2.1 Inoculum, immobilized cells, and feedstock preparation The seed sludge and DJW were obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and a jatropha based biodiesel industry, respectively, located in Taichung, central Taiwan. The characteristics of sludge and DJW are mentioned in our previous study [26]. Heat treatment (95°C for 45min) was employed to inhibit methanogens and subsequently enrich the hydrogen producers which are spore forming bacteria [21,30]. The hybrid immobilized cells were prepared by adding 5% of the heat-treated inoculum to the prepared suspension of sodium-alginate (2%), following the additions of silicon dioxide (1%) for the mechanical strength, chitosan (1%) for the entrapment of the cells, and activated carbon (1%) for the porous nature of the beads, as described elsewhere [27]. The alginate-cell mixture was then extruded into sterile calcium chloride solution (2%) for cell entrapment and immobilized beads formation. The formed beads (5–6mm) were further hardened by stirring the beads in a fresh solution of 2% calcium chloride for 2h. Finally, the beads were washed three times with sterile distilled water and stored for further use. DJW was initially pre-treated with 2% (v/v) HCl as a hydrolysing agent with the solid–liquid ratio of 1:10 (10g DJW: 100mL of 2% HCl). The non-hydrolyzed residue (NHR), rich in cellulose and lignin content was further dried and used as the substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis. The enzymatic hydrolysis conditions followed incubation of 200g/L of NHR with 5% Viscozyme L (Sigma Aldrich) at 50°C, 3h in a water bath. DJW enzyme hydrolysate mainly contains glucose (93%) with small fractions of xylose (7%). The reducing sugar concentration of the enzymatic hydrolyzate of DJW was measured as 24.6±0.3g/L. The elemental analysis (Elemental Analyzer model Vario EL) of UHB showed the elements C, H, N and S as 49.8%, 7.2%, 1.4% and 0.14% dry weight."
3,CSTR start-up and operation,"2.2 CSTR start-up and operation A CSTR with a working volume of 1.0L was used. One fourth of the working volume (250mL) was filled with 10% w/v of the dried immobilized beads (final cell mass concentration of 5gVSS/L). The schematic diagram of the CSTR is shown in Fig. 1 . The start-up of the reactor was in batch mode operation for five days followed by continuous hydrogen fermentation at the HRT range of 48–8h. The initial substrate concentration of the enzyme hydrolysate which has been fed into the reactor as feed was 24.6gRS/L. The reactor was operated at a temperature of 37°C, with mixing rate of 150rpm using a magnetic stirrer. pH was maintained within 5.5–6.0 using 1N NaOH. The HRT was shifted by controlling the feed flow rate when the CSTR achieved a steady state, and the variations in hydrogen gas content and biogas production were within 10%."
4,Analytical procedures,"2.3 Analytical procedures The analytical procedures of Standard Methods of APHA [28] were used to determine pH, total solid (TS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile suspended solids (VSS). The hydrogen and CO2 content were determined by a gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). The liquid samples were analysed for SMP (alcohols and volatile fatty acids) using GC equipped with flame ionization detector (FID). Total sugars were analysed using DNS method [29]. Biogas production was measured using a Tedlar® gas sampling bag with a capacity of 5–20L, depending on the expected biogas production and adjusted to STP [30]. During CSTR operation the monitored parameters were pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), volatile fatty acid (VFA) distribution, and biogas production. The hydrogen production efficiency was evaluated using the hydrogen content in the biogas and HPR. Mass balance was calculated according to Kongjan et al. [12]."
5,Microbial community analysis by PCR-DGGE and FISH,"2.4 Microbial community analysis by PCR-DGGE and FISH Microbial community changes in the CSTR at different HRTs were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. Total genomic DNA from effluent sample collected from the CSTR was extracted by using the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The V6 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes was amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and the PCR product was further subjected to DGGE analysis as per the method described elsewhere [31]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique was followed as per the method reported by Huang et al. [32]."
6,Energy analysis,"2.5 Energy analysis The hydrogen energy production rate (EPR, kJ/L/d) was calculated as: (1) EPR = HPR / 22.4 × HV H 2 where HPR was hydrogen production rate (L/L/d) and HVH2 was heating value of hydrogen (286J/mmol). The hydrogen energy yield (EY, kJ/gVS) was calculated as: (2) EY = HY / 22.4 × HV H 2 where HPR was hydrogen production rate (L/L/d) and HVH2 was heating value of hydrogen (286J/mmol) [23]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Continuous hydrogen production profile of cello-lignin fraction in DJW,"3.1 Continuous hydrogen production profile of cello-lignin fraction in DJW During the start-up period the reactor was operated in batch mode for five days to enrich the hydrogen producers and acclimatize them to the set of conditions for robust performance. The CSTR was then shifted to continuous mode with HRT of 48h with a corresponding flow rate of 20.8mL/h. The hydrogen productivity during the initial period fluctuated probably due to major shifts in microbial community structure and function ensuing change in operation mode. After five days of operation in continuous mode, the hydrogen production gradually showed lesser fluctuations. In the present study, the HRT was changed by controlling the feed flow rate and keeping the feed concentration constant. This strategy has been applied to improve hydrogen production performance in some studies [33,34]. Table 1 and Fig. 2 show the fluctuations in the HPR, BPR, pH and ORP during the CSTR operation at various HRTs. The concentration of hydrogen fluctuated between 53% and 58% throughout the operation period. The BPR gradually increased with shortening of the HRT from 48 to 8h. The hydrogen production performance was stable and improved gradually up to 12h HRT. When the HRT was 8h, there was a drastic drop in the hydrogen production performance, and hence the HRT was restored to 12h HRT in order to bring the reactor to the stable performance. The peak BPR of 6.37L/Ld and HPR of 3.65LH2/Ld were observed at 12h HRT and feed concentration of 24.6g/L. The high HPR could be attributed to high glucose concentration in the enzymatic hydrolyzate of cello-lignin fraction, and earlier studies [7,35] have shown that glucose is the best substrate for high hydrogen production. Besides high glucose concentration in the hydrolyzate, the present study also employed immobilized cells CSTR, which proved advantageous to high rate hydrogen production. The peak HPR in this study is quite higher than other pretreated lignocellulosic feedstocks by mixed cultures in continuous operation (Table 2 ), except the value of the 5.5L/Ld achieved by Zhang et al. [17] which used enzyme-treated corn stalk and pure culture of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 under thermophilic condition. Nevertheless, our study has the advantage of being energy efficient with easy operation due to the use of mixed culture and mesophilic temperature, which further ensures the scale-up feasibility towards commercialization."
9,Fermentation metabolites of cello-lignin fraction in DJW,"3.2 Fermentation metabolites of cello-lignin fraction in DJW At initial stages of the CSTR operation, acetate, butyrate, and ethanol were produced at nearly the same amount; however, at HRT of 12h, butyrate, started to dominate and was the major metabolite in correspondence with enhanced hydrogen production performance. Fig. 3 shows the distribution pattern of the soluble metabolic products formed in the CSTR during its operation at various HRTs. The peak HY of 138mLH2/g reducing sugars was observed when butyrate was the major metabolite. The low and unstable hydrogen production was found to be associated with high propionate production during the initial start-up period (Fig. 3). Formation of propionate (HPr) lowers hydrogen production as it consumes the produced hydrogen for its formation [36,37]. During the steady-state conditions at various HRTs, butyrate, and acetate were major metabolites with low propionate concentration. The concentration of butyrate during the entire operation period was in the range of 2.7–4.6gCOD/L, followed by ethanol and acetate concentrations of 2.3–3.0gCOD/L and 2.3–2.7gCOD/L, respectively. The butyrate to acetate conversion ratio (B/A) ratio has been considered as an useful indicator in dark fermentation, since these volatile fatty acids are observed as the major fraction of the total soluble metabolic products formed during hydrogen production [38]. It has been explained earlier that higher butyrate formation thermodynamically favours the hydrogen production and results in enhanced hydrogen production [32,39]. In the present study, the B/A ratio significantly influenced the HPR and was in the range of 0.46–0.80. The highest B/A ratio (0.8) was observed at 12h HRT, whereas the lowest value of 0.46 was at 48 and 36h HRT. Furthermore, the B/A ratio was found to correlate strongly with HPR, indicating a significant role of butyrate to acetate concentrations ratio on the HPR. In other words, higher B/A ratio is associated with higher HPR, as also reported elsewhere [40–42]. Fig. 4 shows the linear relationship of acetate, butyrate and B/A ratio with HPR. As evident from Fig. 4, acetate showed a non-linear relationship (r 2 =0.44) with HPR, whereas butyrate and B/A ratio showed a linear relationship (r 2 >0.86) with the HPR, and indicated that higher butyrate formation favours high rate hydrogen production from enzyme hydrolyzed cello-lignin fraction in DJW. Table 3 summarizes the fermentation mass (COD) balance for the cello-lignin fraction at 12h HRT. The mass balance analysis was based on the distribution of soluble metabolites, cell biomass, and hydrogen production. The mass balance analysis showed the closure of COD balance at 94% indicating the accuracy of the experimental data and correct interpretation of the reactor performance. The unbalanced 6% COD mass represents the error in the determination methods of soluble metabolites, biogas composition and cell mass [43]."
10,Microbial community composition and shifts with HRT variation,"3.3 Microbial community composition and shifts with HRT variation PCR-DGGE based molecular tool is a routine technique for monitoring hydrogen producing microbial community in continuous operation [44]. In DGGE analysis, each distinct band generally represents a specific population of the microbial community. The samples for the DGGE analysis were taken from the reactor at steady-state of different HRTs. The DGGE banding patterns obtained by using the primer sets Eub968gc/Univ1392r and Chis150fgc/ClostIr are shown in Fig. 5 a and b. Further 16s rRNA sequence analysis of the excised bands and their homologous sequences are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 5. As provided in Table 4, the bacterial communities observed at different HRTs were mainly composed of nine different species of bacteria namely Blautia producta, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium saccharolyticum, Clostridium indolis, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium cocleatum, Serratia proteamaculans, Klebsiella oxytoca and Clostridium baratii. The genera Blautidia, Clostridium and Klebsiella were the major ones observed under the different HRTs. These genera have been previously reported as the efficient hydrogen producers from glucose and xylose by various authors [33,34,45]. The predominant bacterial species were B. producta, C. perfringens and C. saccharolyticum at all HRTs. S. proteamaculans appeared in the reactor at 48h HRT but disappeared with further shortening of HRT. Under conditions of peak HPR of 3.65L/Ld and 12h HRT, seven bacterial species were observed; whereas at 8h HRT only five bacterial species were detected with appearance of C. cocleatum and C. baratii, and disappearance of K. oxytoca and C. butyricum. Previous reports also suggest the appearance and disappearance of bacterial species during HRT shifts, probably due to the wash-out and/or selective enrichment of bacterial species [32,46]. C. butyricum appeared at the HRTs from 48 to 12h, but it disappeared when HRT was down to 8h. C. indolis also had a similar disappearance at low HRT of 8h. The observed drop in hydrogen production performance (HPR 1.97L/Ld and HY 80mLH2/gRSadded) and butyrate concentration (4.6–3.1g/L) at short HRT of 8h was probably due to the wash-out (a phenomenon of the biomass elimination, occurs at higher flow rate of influent and discharge of effluent) of these bacterial populations. Moreover, the shifts in microbial populations at different HRTs had a significant influence on soluble metabolites distribution and hydrogen productivity. In order to determine the morphology and distribution of the hydrogen producing microbial population, FISH technique was employed. FISH technique has been used to study wastewater treatment process [47], hydrogen-producing anaerobic sludge process [48], and detection of hydrogen producing species [49]. The sample used for FISH analysis in our study was taken from the CSTR operation under optimal HRT of 12h. Fig. 6 a shows the images of non-stained, DAPI stained, and group-specific (Clostridia, Eubacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria) Cy3-labelled probe hybridized cells. The distribution pattern of the three major groups namely Clostridia, Eubacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria included in this study is shown in Fig. 6b. The results revealed that 64% of the microbial population belonged to Eubacteria, followed by 13.45% of Clostridia, and 1.4% of Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 6b). About 21.7% of the total population had unidentified species."
11,Energy production and CO2 emission reduction analysis,"3.4 Energy production and CO2 emission reduction analysis Energy production analysis presented in Table 5 revealed that the amount of energy produced from the cello-lignin fraction of DJW is comparatively higher than that of untreated DJW. This is certainly due to the amount of reducing sugars released during the enzymatic hydrolysis of cello-lignin fraction. Nearly two-fold higher in terms of production rate and five times higher in terms of yield were observed from the enzyme-treated cello-lignin fraction. Thus, enzymatic pre-treatment is necessary for the cello-lignin fraction in DJW to enhance the hydrogen production performance. For the development of a hydrogen fermentation process, it is important to evaluate the CO2 reduction efficiency. HPR was taken into account for calculating the amount of energy production and the CO2 emission reduction. A comparative evaluation of the maximum bioenergy yields from bioethanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen production using lignocellulosic residues reveals the maximum energy yield of 167.1GJ/ha/y (Table 6 ) from hydrogen production using cello-lignin fraction of DJW. Table 7 summarizes the CO2 reduction efficiency of our proposed process, which may substitute for the current fossil fuel resources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. By considering the conversion factor of 108 gdrybiomass/ha/year [50], the amount of energy that could be produced from DJW was calculated. Besides, the amount of CO2 which could be replaced by using the bioenergy produced from this process was also evaluated. The calculated efficiency was in the range of 2.88–4.48tons per year which makes cello-lignin fraction in DJW a promising by-product for clean source of energy. The hydrogen fermentation process developed for the cello-lignin fraction in DJW is poised to be feasible on a large scale taking into account the carbon footprint and process efficiency. Furthermore, the electricity generation from the process was calculated as 2.2kW per year, which could be used for the household or industrial purposes."
12,Conclusions,"Enzyme-treated cello-lignin fraction was subjected to hydrogen fermentation in a CSTR at various HRTs. The peak HPR of 3.65LH2/Ld and HY of 150mLH2/g reducing sugars was obtained at the HRT of 12h. When the HRT was further shortened to 8h, there was a drop in the hydrogen productivity, which was restored by increasing the HRT back to 12h. Acetate production showed a non-linear relationship (r 2 =0.44) with HPR, whereas butyrate production and B/A ratio showed a linear relationship (r 2 >0.86) with the HPR. This means that higher butyrate formation favours high rate hydrogen production from cello-lignin fraction of DJW. Microbial analysis revealed that 64% of the microbial population belonged to Eubacteria, followed by 13.45% of Clostridia, and 1.4% of Gammaproteobacteria. The energy production rate and CO2 emission reduction analysis suggested cello-lignin fraction in DJW as a high energy yielding residue, and can produce 2.2kW electricity per year and an annual CO2 emission reduction of 4.48tonnes per year in a coal based power plant."
