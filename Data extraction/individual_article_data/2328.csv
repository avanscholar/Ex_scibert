0,Introduction,"Increased energy demands associated with increased economic activity has resulted in a higher consumption of fossil fuels and environmental contamination. As an energy carrier, hydrogen is an alternative to conventional fossil fuels; furthermore, hydrogen is a valuable raw material for various branches of the chemical industry [1]. A significant amount of research on hydrogen production via dark fermentation has been performed due to high H2 production rates (HPR) and the ability to use pretreatment liquors derived from underutilized agricultural residue [2]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the cassava plant, a tropical root crop originally from the Brazilian Amazon, is the staple food of an estimated 800million people worldwide. The global production of cassava in 2012 was estimated to be 262,585,741tons, with the top producers being Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil, and Thailand [3]. After 1kg of fresh cassava root is peeled, washed, grated and mixed with water during starch production processes, approximately 0.2kg of starch, 0.4–0.9kg of residue, and 5–7L of carbohydrate-rich wastewater are generated [3,4]. The generated wastewater is rich in biodegradable carbohydrates and is potentially useful as a substrate for fermentative hydrogen production. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are members of the autochthonous microbiota of cassava and are responsible for the fermentation of this root; furthermore, LAB reduces cassava toxicity and prevents post-harvest deterioration [5,6]. However, in hydrogen-producing reactors, a few LAB strains may have an inhibitory effect due to their bacteriocins, which are antimicrobial peptides that have a deleterious effect on H2-producing bacteria [7]. Ren et al. [8] evaluated the dynamics of these communities in three continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) that were used for H2 production from molasses wastewater at three pH ranges (4–4.5, 5.5–6, and 6–6.5) and found that the worst H2 yields were obtained for reactors operated at 5.5–6.0. This pH range may favor the growth of Lactococcus sp., an LAB that produces ethanol under some conditions but cannot generate H2. Batch bioreactors have been frequently used in the production of hydrogen from cassava wastewater (CW) [9,10] and for determining the biohydrogen potential. Continuous reactors, such as CSTR [11] and anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) [4], have also been used with CW and have shown the greatest potential for hydrogen production. In our recent studies, we operated an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) to evaluate the effect of the hydraulic retention time (HRT) on fermentative hydrogen gas production from a CW and glucose mixture [12]. The effects of HRTs (10–12h) and different sources of inoculum were reported. From the same sludge in this study, the maximum hydrogen yield (HY) was 0.7mmolg−1 COD (HRT of 10h). However, the methane production was high (5.13L CH4 d−1 L−1), which affected the performance of the reactors. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA showed that 98.2% of the analyzed sequences corresponded to the family Lactobacillaceae, and 76.8% of the clones were affiliated with the genus Lactobacillus sp. Based on the results of this study, it would be necessary to evaluate the effect of lactic bacteria on hydrogen production. A few factors that affect hydrogen production in AFBRs have been studied, such as (a) differing ratios of carbon sources [13], (b) the organic loading rate (OLR) [14], (c) the support material [15], and (d) the upflow velocity [16]. These studies were performed using simple substrates, such as glucose, and real wastewater, such as cheese whey and sugarcane stillage. However, there have been no studies in the literature that have evaluated the influence of LAB on bioreactors with a continuous CW feed, which naturally contains a significant population of LAB. Thus, in the production of hydrogen from CW, this study evaluated the direct effect of LAB and their antimicrobial peptides in AFBRs. The reactors were operated over a diverse range of OLRs under optimum conditions, as determined in a previous study [12]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Hydrogen production from cassava processing wastewater,"2.1 Hydrogen production from cassava processing wastewater This study was performed by using two AFBRs (for a total volume of 770cm3, a reactor height of 80cm and an internal diameter of 3.5cm) for biohydrogen production. Polystyrene was used as a support material for biomass immobilization. The AFBRs were made of acrylic and jacketed with a water bath [12]. The reactor temperature was maintained at 30°C. Anaerobic sludge from a UASB reactor was used for the treatment of swine wastewater. The sludge was subjected to thermal pre-treatment by using a methodology adapted from Kim et al. [17]. The CW feeding substrate was subjected to acid hydrolysis with sulfuric acid and heated at 120°C for 30min before being used in the reactor feeds [12]. In the reactors, the biomass was activated using a mixture of glucose and CW in the influent [14]. The ratios of the carbon sources were varied by changes in the OLRs as shown in Table 1 . The operation was continuous for 160d. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 with NaOH. Nitrogen was injected to remove trace oxygen from the liquid and headspace. The start-up conditions of the AFBRs were described in a previous study [12]."
3,Isolation of lactic acid bacteria and the evaluation of antimicrobial peptide production (bacteriocins),"2.2 Isolation of lactic acid bacteria and the evaluation of antimicrobial peptide production (bacteriocins) At least 50mL of the effluents was collected in sterile tubes at each operational phase change. Additionally, samples of the biomass that adhered to polystyrene were collected at the end of operational phase 5. All samples were immediately stored on ice and processed. The isolation of LAB from the effluent and biomass samples was performed using De Man Rogosa-Sharpe agar plates (MRS; Oxoid, UK). At least 25g of the biomass that adhered to the support was transferred to 50-mL sterile flasks and washed (five times) with 20mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent cells were resuspended by vortexing the samples five times in 10mL PBS [18]. The suspended cells then underwent serial dilution with peptone water (0.1% w/v). One hundred microliters of the serial dilutions were spread-plated on the surface of the MRS agar and incubated at 30°C for 72h under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroGen, Oxoid) [19]. Plates containing between 25 and 250 colonies were selected for the enumeration of the LAB, and the colonies underwent phenotypic tests (Gram staining and catalase testing corresponded to the square root of the total CFUs per plate). The counts were reported as CFU per milliliter of sample (CFU mL−1), as previously reported in Crispim et al. [21]. Typical gram-positive and catalase-negative cocci [20] were transferred to MRS broth (Oxoid, UK) supplemented with 20% v/v glycerol and stored at 80°C for later molecular identification. After isolation and purification, 20μL aliquots of each LAB strain were evaluated for the ability to produce bacteriocin in trypticase soy agar with 0.6% w/v yeast extract (TSAYE) (Oxoid, UK) under anaerobic conditions by using the indicator microorganisms Lactobacillus sakei ATCC 15521 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 [22]. After anaerobic incubation, the presence of a clear inhibition zone around the colonies was considered positive [22]. Tests were performed in independent duplicates."
4,Molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria,"2.3 Molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria The protocol of Griffiths et al. [23] was used to obtain the genomic DNA of the presumptive LAB. The DNA was quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to amplify the genes encoding the 16S rRNA sequence. The universal primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGCTCAG) and 1492 R (5′-CTACGGCTACCTTGTTACGA) were used to amplify the genes encoding the 16S rRNA sequence, according to Liu et al. [24]. In brief, each reaction mixture (50μL) contained 1× PCR buffer, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM dNTP mixture, 25pmol of each primer, 0.625U Taq polymerase, and 60ng DNA template. The amplification conditions were 94°C for 5min, followed by 30 denaturation cycles at 94°C for 1min, annealing at 50°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 1min 45 s. A final extension step was conducted at 72°C for 10min. The PCR products were confirmed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels stained with Blue Green Loading Dye I (LGC Biotecnologia) in a 1× TAE buffer. The gels were visualized on a UV transilluminator and photographed with a molecular imaging system (Loccus Biotecnologia, Brazil). The 1468 base pair fragment was then sequenced by Macrogen, Inc. (Seoul, Korea). A BLAST analysis was performed with the 16S rRNA gene sequences of all 39 isolates (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast)."
5,Phylogenetic analysis,2.4 Phylogenetic analysis All sequences were edited and trimmed to remove low-quality regions and were then aligned by ClustalX. A phylogenetic tree for the representative LAB of each reactor was constructed by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 6.0 software [25] based on 1000 random resamplings. Thirty-nine sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KR051138 to KR051176.
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The biogas content was measured by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2010). Argon was used as a carrier gas, and a Carboxen Plot 1010 column (30m×0:53mm id) was employed. The biogas production was measured with a Ritter milligas counter (Type: MGC-1) instrument. The concentrations of acids and alcohols were determined by liquid chromatography (HPLC Shimadzu) with a pump (LC-10ADVP), auto sampler (SIL-20A HT), column oven (CTO-20A) at 43°C, index detector refraction (RID-10A), controller (SCL-10AVP) system and Aminex HPX-87H column (300mm, 7.8mm, BioRad). The pH and COD were analyzed in accordance with the APHA [26]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Continuous hydrogen production from cassava processing wastewater with different OLRs,"3.1 Continuous hydrogen production from cassava processing wastewater with different OLRs Continuous hydrogen production from CW was conducted. The resulting hydrogen yields (HY), biogas content, hydrogen production rate (HPR) and methane production rate (MPR) are shown in Fig. 1 . In AFBR1, the H2 content of the biogas ranged from 4% to 16% and reached a maximum during phase 4 (an OLR of 10kg CODm−3 d−1). In phases 4 and 5, methane was detected in the biogas at 2% and 8%, respectively. Regarding the HPR, the increase in the OLR from 4 to 10kg CODm−3 d−1 resulted in an increase from 0.3 to 1.66L H2 d−1 L−1. At an OLR of 12kg CODm−3 d−1, the HPR decreased to 0.7L H2 d−1 L−1 due to the production of methane (0.4L CH4 d−1 L−1). The total replacement of glucose with CW increased the HY from 0.5 to 1.3mmolg−1 COD from phases 1 to 2. As the only carbon source, the HY maximum of the CW feed was 2.0mmolg−1 COD in phase 4 (10kg CODm−3 d−1). Thus, the OLR of 10kg CODm−3 d−1 was considered the optimal OLR. In AFBR2, the hydrogen content in the biogas ranged from 1% to 25% and reached its maximum in phases 2 (25%) and 3 (14%). As in AFBR1, methane was detected in the biogas but at 14% and 27% at phases 4 and 5, respectively. The reduction of the OLR from 30 to 14kg CODm−3 d−1 (phases 1 and 2, 50% glucose and 50% CW) resulted in an increased HPR from 0.12 to 2.1L H2 d−1 L−1. In the pure CW feed phase (phase 3), the increased OLR resulted in a drop in the HPR (1.1–0.03LH2 d−1 L−1), showing that the different operational strategies of the reactors resulted in different behaviors. The MPR values were 0.9L CH4 d−1 L−1 (phase 4) and 1.5L CH4 d−1 L−1 (phase 5). The maximum HY of 1.53mmolg−1 COD was obtained in phase 2, which used a feed mixture of 50% glucose and 50% CW. For pure CW feeds (phases 3, 4 and 5), the increased OLR (14–22kgCODm−3 d−1) resulted in a drop in the HY from 0.8 to 0.01mmolg−1 COD. This indicated that the highest OLRs also inhibited the hydrogen production in this reactor. The increased CH4 concentration (from 2% to 27%) in the biogas generated over two phases (phases 4 and 5) may be related to the presence of methanogenic archaea within the process. These archaea could survive and adapt to produce methane at a low pH. According to our previous study, acid-tolerant methanogens (Methanobacterium) are able to survive at an acidic pH of 4–4.5 [12]. In AFBR1, a relation between the HY and the OLR was not verified. During the exclusive use of CW (phases 2 and 3), the increased OLR did not change the HY. In phase 4, an OLR of 10kg CODm−3 d−1 resulted in a maximum HY of 2mmolg−1 COD. At this OLR, the HY decreased by 0.7mmolg−1 COD. This same behavior was observed by Thanwised et al. [27]. The authors evaluated the effect of the OLR (16–130kg CODm−3 d−1) on hydrogen production from tapioca wastewater. In the first phase, the authors applied an OLR of 16kgCODm−3 d−1, resulting in an HY of 0.4mmolg−1 COD. As the OLR increased to 22kgCODm−3 d−1, the HY remained stable at 0.5mmolg−1 COD. The optimal OLR was 31kg CODm−3 d−1 with a maximum value of HY (0.74mmolg−1 COD). At this OLR, the HY decreased to 0.22mmolg−1 COD. These authors associated the decrease in the hydrogen yield with other metabolic pathways in which fermentation was used to produce other products, such as ethanol and acetic and butyric acids, which competed with hydrogen. Under a different operating strategy, AFBR2 had a different behavior, and the highest HY (1.5mmolg−1 COD) was obtained at the lowest OLR (14kgCODm−3 d−1). Aktusu et al. [28] evaluated the effect of starch substrate concentration on H2 production. The increase in the OLR from 15 to 60kg CODm−3 d−1 resulted in a drop of 60% in the HY, which was the same behavior as that observed in the AFBR2 reactor. The results of microbial conversions of real wastewater through biohydrogen fermentation processes and the various organic loads that were applied in prior studies are compared with the results found in this study in Table 2 . For the studies on complex wastewater, such as from olive mills [29], cheese whey [30], glucose and CW [12], and sugarcane stillage [14], the HPR ranged from 0.048 to 8.16LH2 d−1 L−1. HY values ranging from 0.54 to 3.21mmolg−1 COD were obtained. Even under different operating conditions and various sources of real wastewater, this study confirmed the results in the literature. We obtained HY values that were 2.9 times greater than in our previous studies [12]. Additionally, the methane production was 5.8 times lower in the present study. These significant improvements were likely attributed to the application of different operating strategies."
9,Volatile fatty acids,"3.2 Volatile fatty acids A microbial consortium used as the inoculum in the biohydrogen fermentative process enabled the combination of metabolic pathways to facilitate the processing of complex substrates. However, the H2 yields remained low because of the simultaneous production of diverse metabolites and competitor microorganisms, such as lactic acid bacteria and their antimicrobial peptides [7,27,33]. Ethanol, lactic acid, methanol, butyric acid, propionic acid and acetic acid were detected as major soluble metabolites (Fig. 2 ). In AFBR1, ethanol and methanol were stable for phases 1 through 4 at 35% to 40% and 14% to 17%, respectively, but decreased to 15% and 8% in phase 5. This decrease also reflected the decrease in HY (Fig. 2A). Moreover, in phase 5, the phase with the highest applied OLR (12kg CODm−3 d−1), the presence of valeric acid was observed (18%), which affected the performance. Lactic acid was found only in phase 1 at 8%. The acetic acid levels (12–30%) were similar to the butyric acid levels (12–24%). Propionic acid was detected in amounts lower than 14%. For phases 1 through 4, the ethanol/acetate metabolic pathway dominated, with a 65% ethanol and acetate fraction, which represented all soluble metabolites (SMP). With respect to AFBR2 (Fig. 2B), after the reduction in the OLR (phase 1 through phase 2), there was an increase from 19% to 54% and 0.6% to 11% in ethanol and butyric acid levels, respectively. There were also decreases from 46% to 23% and from 19% to 2% for lactic acid and propionic acid levels, respectively. For the pure CW feed (phase 3), there was a decrease in ethanol levels from 54% to 34% and an increase from 9% to 17% in acetic acid levels and from 10% to 20% in butyric acid levels. In phases 4 and 5, the lactic acid and ethanol concentrations were negligible, and valeric acid was detected (14–19%). For both reactors, the presence of valeric acid was detected even with different operating strategies. According to Saady [34], valeric acid may decrease the hydrogen yield during fermentation in the dark when using a mixed culture. Based on that study, Eqs. (1) and (2) show the formation of valeric acid due to hydrogen consumption, thus justifying the lowest values of HY in phase 5 for AFBR1 (0.7mmolg−1 COD) and phases 4 and 5 for AFBR2 (0.2 and 0.01mmolg−1 COD). (1) CH 3 CH 2 COO - + 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 → CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 3 COO - + 4 H 2 O (2) 3 CH 3 COO - + 3 H 2 + 2 H + → CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 4 COO - + 4 H 2 O There was a predominant fermentation process that produced ethanol during phases 1–4 in AFBR1 and phases 1–3 in AFBR2. From 1mol glucose, it is possible to produce 2mol hydrogen and 1mol ethanol [35]. This indicated that the highest HY for both reactors corresponded with higher ethanol production values. The reduced alcohol levels in phase 4 in AFBR1 and phases 4 and 5 in AFBR2 may be justified because of the conversion of ethanol and methanol to methane, as shown in Eqs. (3) and (4) [34]. (3) 4 CH 3 OH → 3 CH 4 + CO 2 + 2 H 2 O (4) 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + CO 2 → CH 4 + 2 CHCOOH A few strains of Clostridium sp. are able to produce methanol as a major end product during growth on pectin medium [36]. This finding suggests that the high methanol values observed in this study were attributed to the presence of Clostridium sp. in wastewater rich in starch [37]. Regarding the absence lack of lactic acid in AFBR1 (phases 2–5) and AFBR2 (phase 5), this acid was likely an intermediate product during the formation of other products (Fig. 2C and D). Lactic acid may further be metabolized by various bacterial species to form acetic acid, ethanol, CO2 and even H2 under anaerobic conditions [34], which could in part explain the observed amounts of the main metabolites in the reactors. According to Woods [38], lactate is the preferred substrate for propionate-forming bacteria (Eq. (5)). Moreover, Saady [34] concluded that acetogenic bacteria can synthesize acetate during heterotrophic growth on a variety of substrates. Stoichiometrically, syntrophic acetogens form 1mol acetic acid during their growth on 1mol lactic acid and produce 2mol H2 (Eq. (6)) [34] as follows: (5) 3 CH 3 CH ( OH ) COOH → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + CH 3 COOH + CO 2 (6) CH 3 CHOHCOOH + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + HCO - + 2 H 2 The acid production profiles in AFBR2 reveals a progressive increase in butyric acid during the operational phases (from 0.6% to 36.7%), accompanied by a concomitant reduction in lactic acid (from 46.4% to 0%). Louis and Flint [39] previously showed that lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria may be used by a few strictly anaerobic butyrate-producing bacteria (clostridial cluster XIV) in the production of high concentrations of butyric acid."
10,Lactic acid bacteria involved in the fermentation of CW,"3.3 Lactic acid bacteria involved in the fermentation of CW During the operational phases of both AFBRs, 66 colonies of lactic acid bacteria were obtained from ten samples of effluents with one sample from raw cassava wastewater and two samples from the biomasses of the reactors. After gram-staining and catalase testing, 47 strains were retained for study, with 39 positively confirmed as lactic acid bacteria (25 from effluent samples, 3 from CW and 11 from biomass). Lactic acid bacteria are gram-positive and produce lactic acid as the main product of carbohydrate fermentation. The analysis of the inoculum used in the fermentative reactors did not result in the isolation of lactic acid bacteria. However, two strains of Bacillus coagulans (data not shown) did not persist in the reactor throughout the fermentation process. B. coagulans forms endospores, and although not classified as an LAB, B. coagulans can produce lactic acid from the fermentation of carbohydrates. There are reports of the use of B. coagulans as a growth promoter and in probiotic cultures in swine farms [40]. Elevated LAB counts were found in the effluent samples of both AFBRs with few differences in abundance throughout the operational phases (Fig. 3 ). This indicated that LAB persisted in the anaerobic reactors throughout the operational phases. The LAB counts in AFBR1 ranged between 2.8×107 and 1.9×108 CFUmL−1. Using a different operational strategy, the AFBR2 with an increased organic loading rate (14–30kgCODm−3 d−1) resulted in LAB counts less than the count for AFBR1, with values ranging from 1.0×101 to 1.2×108 CFUmL−1. The low counts of LAB found at a few points and even the absence of colonies found in the effluent of AFBR2 phases 4 and 5 may be related to the excessively high concentration of substrates, resulting in a stressful environment for some LAB genera [41]. Additionally, it is shown (Fig. 3B) that in the absence of LAB in the effluent samples from phases 4 and 5 of AFBR2, the lactic acid percentage and ethanol concentration exhibited significant reductions. The presence of LAB in phase 5 of AFBR2 was related to the counts found on the analyzed biomass. The raw CW that was used as a substrate in both reactors had an LAB count of 1.1×108 CFUmL−1. The biomass samples analyzed at the end of operational phase 5 had LAB counts of 8.9×108 and 1.5×109 CFUmL−1. The LAB counts in cassava roots were previously reported to range from 106 to 109 CFUg−1 [5,21]. The distribution of the LAB genera correlated with the operational conditions shown in Table 3 . Both reactors presented a considerable heterogeneity of species under the evaluated conditions. There was a prevalence of heterofermentative LAB and a concomitant high diversity of facultative heterofermentative Lactobacilli species, i.e., L. harbinensis, L. perolens, L. casei and L. parabuchneri, with lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol and even CO2 as the major fermentation products [42]. AFBR1, which was operated with a substrate concentration ranging from 2000 to 5000mg CODL−1 and an HRT of 12h up to phase 4 and 10h during the end phase 5, had Lactobacillus sp. (45.4%) as the most prevalent genus, followed by Lactococcus lactis (31.8%), Bifidobacterium subtile (13.6%) and Leuconostoc citreum (9.1%). In AFBR2, which operated with an increasing substrate concentration of 7000–15,000mgL−1, an HRT of 12h and 100% CW (phase 3), Lactobacillus sp. was the predominant bacteria (78.6%), followed by L. citreum (7.14%), Lactococcus sp. (7.14%) and Bifidobacterium (7.14%). These results suggest that the low OLR (4–12kgCODm−3 d−1) of AFBR1 may have allowed for a more equilibrated distribution of the LAB (general profile). Fructobacillus fructosus and Lactobacillus fermentum were the LAB that were identified in the raw substrate of cassava wastewater. F. fructosus is an unusual LAB that does not tolerate strict anaerobic conditions [43], justifying its absence in the effluent samples of both reactors. Moreover, L. fermentum could not maintain its viability during the operation of the AFBRs. A similar result was reported by Huch et al. [44], who showed that even though L. fermentum BFE 6620 was inoculated at a high number, it failed to establish itself as a dominant part of the cassava fermentation, which was in turn was dominated by Lactobacillus plantarum. L. plantarum is a facultative, heterofermentative LAB that has a competitive advantage in its ability to utilize complex sugars [45]. Many studies that have evaluated the microbiota responsible for the fermentation of cassava have highlighted the elevated prevalence of LAB. Crispim et al. [21] evaluated the microbiota of cassava root during its spontaneous submerged fermentation to produce a typical Brazilian staple food, and they found a predominance of Lactobacillus spp. throughout the process. Carvalho et al. [5] reported that Lactobacillus spp. was the prevalent LAB over 36d of cassava fermentation in small factories in Minas Gerais, Brazil. In the same way, Lacerda et al. [6] evaluated the microbiological characteristics of cassava starch and found L. plantarum and L. fermentum ranging from 106 to 109 CFUg−1 and small amounts of L. perolans and L. brevis. Crispim et al. [21] affirmed that the elevated prevalence of lactic acid bacteria in cassava fermentation is extremely important because LAB favor the removal of toxic compounds found in the cassava plant (e.g., cyanide) and are responsible for the production of antimicrobial compounds. The second most prevalent LAB genus found in AFBR2 was Lactococcus sp., a homofermentative LAB that produces lactic acid as the main product of glucose fermentation under certain conditions [46]. However, under acidic conditions, Lactococcus lactics may induce the citrate metabolic pathway and increase levels of pyruvate intermediates, α-acetolactate and acetate to reduce the deleterious effect of the acidic environment [47]. Moreover, the notable production of acetic acid found in both AFBRs may be justified by the presence of Bifidobacterium sp. and Leuconostoc. These LAB genera possess a heterofermentative metabolism, primarily producing acetic and lactic acids [48]. No direct association between Bifidobacterium sp. and biohydrogen production was found. The identification of this genus may be justified by the presence of enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates derived from the plant diet of polysaccharides [49]. CW is among the vegetables that contain significant amounts of complex carbohydrates. The phylogenetic tree for the lactic acid bacteria that were isolated from both AFBRs operated with cassava wastewater is represented in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material section."
11,Influence of LAB on hydrogen production in AFBRs,"3.4 Influence of LAB on hydrogen production in AFBRs The profiles of short chain fatty acids produced in both AFBRs cannot account for the hydrogen yields found in the present study. In AFBR1, it is noted that the first HY peak that occurred in phase 2 (Fig. 1) was coincident with heterofermentative Lactobacillus spp., i.e., the unique LAB found in the analyzed effluent samples (Table 3 and Fig. 2E). In phase 4, which had the maximum HY of 2mmolg−1 COD, Lactobacillus sp. represented 80% of the LAB profile. After that operational phase, the HY dropped to 0.7mmolg−1 COD, and the LAB profile was quite diverse in the effluent samples with an equal distribution (33.3%) of Lactococcus sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus sp. In phases 1, 3 and 5, which had a reduced HYs compared with the remaining phases, higher prevalence of Lactococcus sp. and Leuconostoc sp. were observed. For AFBR2, the first and maximum HY of 1.5mmolg−1 COD occurred in phase 2 (Table 3 and Fig. 2F), which again coincided with the unique prevalence of Lactobacillus sp. in the analyzed effluent samples. In later phases, a constant decline in the HY was observed, which reached a value of 0.01mmolg−1 COD in phase 5, in which the prevalence of heterofermentative Lactobacillus sp. and a few Bifidobacterium sp. were found (Table 3 and Fig. 2F). Thus, in addition to the negative role of LAB in fermentative hydrogen production due to increased competition for nutrients [8], the inhibition of H2-producer strains (primarily Clostridium sp.) by the action of antimicrobial peptides produced by LAB must also be considered [7]. From the 36 strains of LAB isolated from the effluent or the biomass in the reactors, six strains (16.6%) produced antimicrobial peptides, i.e., two Lactococcus sp. and four Lactobacillus sp. (Supplementary Material – Table S1). According to Callon et al. [50], when LAB are associated with other gram-positive strains, synergic antimicrobial activity may occur and a negative effect from the LAB and their metabolites on fermentative hydrogen production was reported. Noike et al. [7] evaluated a microbial consortium that was responsible for H2 production from bean curd manufacturing waste and found a negative correlation between Clostridium sp. and LAB (Lactobacillus sp. and Enterococcus sp.) due to nutrient competition and the direct actions of the produced antimicrobial peptides. More recently, Castellò et al. [33] associated the low yields of hydrogen production in anaerobic reactor feeds containing food residue with the prevalence of Lactobacillus, Dialister and Prevotella over the population of Clostridium, Ruminococcus and Enterobacter. In AFBR1, the reduction observed in phase 3 may be correlated with the presence of bacteriocinogenic strains of LAB (Supplementary Material – Table S1) that may also inhibit phylogenetically related strains in addition to inhibiting Clostridium sp. The peak H2 production in phase 4 of AFBR1 (2.0mmolH2 g−1 COD) coincided with the absence of bacteriocin-producing LAB. This profile was repeated in reactor AFBR2 with the peak H2 production in phase 2 (1.5mmolH2 g−1 COD) in the absence of bacteriocin-producing LAB."
12,Conclusions,"Diverse OLRs were evaluated to increase the efficiency of hydrogen production from CW. The different operating strategies of the reactors showed different behaviors, and AFBR1 had the highest HY at 2.0mmolg−1 COD when the highest OLR was applied. By contrast, AFBR2 had the highest HY at 1.5mmolg−1 COD when the smallest OLR was applied. The ethanol pathway was prevalent. The detrimental role of LAB regarding fermentative hydrogen production can be explained by the production of antimicrobial peptides because the optimal H2 yield observed for both reactors coincided with the absence of bacteriocin-producing strains of lactic acid bacteria."
