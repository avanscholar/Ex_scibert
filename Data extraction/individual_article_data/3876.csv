0,Introduction,"Benzyl alcohols are a key class of intermediates in organic chemistry [1–3]. For example, benzyl alcohol is a commercially important chemical, employed as solvent for inks, paints, lacquers and as precursor for the manufacture of a range of esters in the cosmetics and flavoring industries [4]. However, the traditional production methods for these alcohols are always present a serious impact on the environment [5,6]. As an alternative route, chemoselective hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes to obtain benzyl alcohol has drawn people's more attention. Several noble metals (Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru) have been reported for this reaction [7–11]. Unfortunately, the hydrogenation selectivity of CO is still a challenge, since catalytic hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohols to corresponding methyl arenes easily occur [11,12]. Nowadays, transition metals (Cu, Co and Ni) are frequently employed for hydrogenation reaction instead of the expensive noble catalyst [13–15]. Whereas, there are only a few reports concerned about the chemoselective hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes over transition metals catalysts, and which often suffered from poor benzyl alcohols yield [16–18]. In our previous studies, a series of Ni and Cu based catalysts have been developed and exhibited excellent performance for the hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds [15,19–21]. These results encouraged us to study the chemoselective hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes over transition metals catalysts. In this work, benzaldehyde is used as a model molecule to evaluate catalyst for reduction of aromatic aldehydes to corresponding benzyl alcohols. Several Co based catalysts were examined, and in which SiO2 modified Co/γ-Al2O3 exhibited excellent performance. The effects of SiO2 doped in Co/γ-Al2O3 were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurement. Additionally, the selected catalyst is applied in the reduction of a collection of representative aromatic aldehydes."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and catalysts,"2.1 Materials and catalysts Aromatic aldehydes were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine-chemical institute. Pseudo-boehmite was supplied by Jiangyan Chemical Auxiliary Factory (Jiangyan, China). All the commercially available solvents and reagents were used without further purification. In the present studies, the cobalt weight percent on the catalyst is 20%. Co/γ-Al2O3 was prepared by kneading a mixture of pseudo-boehmite together with the corresponding precipitates of metal carbonates or hydroxides [15]. Co/γ-Al2O3–mSiO2 (m means the weight percent of SiO2 in the catalyst) was prepared by kneading a mixture of SiO2 and pseudo-boehmite together with the precipitates of cobalt carbonates or hydroxides. For example, Co20/γ-Al2O3–64%SiO2 (namely, the weight percent of SiO2 in the support is 80%) was prepared as follows: 20.2g metal carbonates were kneaded with a mixture of 32.0g SiO2 and 12.1g pseudo-boehmite, followed by molding to bars (with a diameter of 3mm) by an extruder. After drying in air at 110°C for 6h, the catalysts were calcined at 500°C for 4h. The Co based catalysts were reduced at 400 °C for 4h in a stream of hydrogen under 1.0MPa before use."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaka D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation and scanning 2θ from 15° to 85°, operated at 40kV and 100mA. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was measured using a micromeritics 2910 apparatus with a temperature ramp from 130°C to 850°C at 10°C/min, and a gas flow of 5% H2 in argon (20mL/min). A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to determine the amount of hydrogen consumed during temperature ramping. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was carried out on a TP-5000 instrument with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) specific surface areas, pore-size distributions, total pore volumes and sorption isotherms of the materials were measured via nitrogen adsorption/desorption using a NOVA 2000e analyzer (Quantachrome, US)."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test Activity measurement was performed in a fixed bed reactor, which was loaded with about 18.0g catalysts (cylinder catalyst particle with diameter of 3mm and height about 2–3mm), under an atmosphere of 3MPa H2 and a reaction temperature of 130°C. A solution of aromatic aldehydes (concentration in 1,4-dioxane=20.0wt%) was dosed into the reactor at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min by a pump. The components of the reaction mixture was confirmed by GC–MS (Polaris Q, Thermo Finngan, America, HP-1 capillary column, 30m×0.25mm, 0.2μm film thickness) equipped with an ion trap MS detector. The composition of the reaction mixture was monitored by GC with an OV-1701 capillary column (30m×0.25mm, 0.2μm film thickness)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst modification,"3.1 Catalyst modification Co based catalysts were frequently employed in the hydrogenation reaction, and γ-Al2O3 was a widely used support for metallic catalyst [20–23]. Therefore, Co/γ-Al2O3 was prepared and employed for the reduction of benzaldehyde firstly; the obtained results are listed in Table 1 . Besides the desired product benzyl alcohol, a considerable amount of toluene was also detected. Barbelli et al. [24] and Wu et al. [25] had reported that strong acidic sites on catalysts are helpful for the hydrogenolysis of CO bond. Considering of this, we inferred that the toluene was possibly generated from the hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol. According to the above results, the reaction pathway was deduced and shown in Scheme 1 . As well known, SiO2 has lower acidity than γ-Al2O3. Thus, it was added to Co/γ-Al2O3 to decrease its acidity, and the results over these modified catalysts are shown in Table 1. As described in Table 1, with the addition of 64wt% SiO2 to the catalyst, the selectivity of benzyl alcohol increased from 41.9% to 95.0%, while the conversion of benzaldehyde increased from 85.5% to 98.0%. Table 1 also displayed that when the percent of SiO2 in the catalyst is more than 64wt%, both the selectivity of benzyl alcohol and conversion of benzaldehyde were slightly decreased. These results demonstrated that the catalytic properties of the catalyst in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis were evidently influenced by the introduction of SiO2, and Co20/γ-Al2O3 doped with 64wt% SiO2 displayed an excellent catalytic performance for the present reaction. To better understand the effects of doped SiO2, Co/γ-Al2O3, Co/γ-Al2O3–64%SiO2 (denoted as Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2) and Co/SiO2 are investigated by some physical methods."
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.2 Catalysts characterization 3.2.1 XRD The XRD patterns of reduced Co/γ-Al2O3, Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 and Co/SiO2 are depicted in Fig. 1 . No peaks of SiO2 or any other Si compound were present, possibly due to the amorphous state of the added SiO2. However, both peak of metallic Co and CoO were observed on the XRD patterns of these catalysts. With the sequence of Co/γ-Al2O3, Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 and Co/SiO2, the peak density of Co becomes more and more strongly and the peak density of CoO greatly decreased. These results indicated that the reduction degree of these Co based catalyst are obviously improved through the addition of SiO2. As reported, the activity of cobalt catalysts depends solely on the number of active sites located on the surface of crystalline metal formed by reduction, and the number of active sites is mainly determined by the reduction degree of the Co precursors [26,27]. In other words, the higher reduction degree would result in a higher metallic cobalt surface area and excellent catalytic activity. Based on the above analysis and the reaction results in Table 1, it is easily to understand that why Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 demonstrated a better catalytic performance than Co/γ-Al2O3. But, it is hard to explain why Co/SiO2 has lower catalytic ability than Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2. 3.2.2 H2-TPR In order to study the reducibility of the active metallic phase, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was performed. In TPR spectra of various catalyst's oxides precursors, as shown in Fig. 2 , two major peaks can be observed, which are located at 200–500°C and 500–800°C, respectively. It appears to be difficult to perfectly assign the broad TPR peaks to the reduction of the well-defined cobalt species. However, the following generally accepted assignment can be applied for the above-mentioned peaks. The TPR peak between 200 and 500°C is related to the two-step reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and synchronous reduction from Co2+ to Co, respectively. While the peak between 500 and 800°C is related to the reduction of these cobalt oxide species (Co3+ and Co2+) strongly interacting with the support [28–30]. With addition of SiO2 to the catalyst, both of these peaks moved gradually toward low temperature side. And the centered value for the peak temperature for the broad peak between 200 and 500°C altered from 364.1°C for the original Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst to 326.4°C and 319.9°C for Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 and Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 catalyst. As reported by some previous studies [31–33], the interaction of the supported-cobalt precursors with alumina support is stronger than SiO2 support. So, based on the obtained results from H2-TPR, we inferred that the addition of SiO2 to the catalyst decreased the strength of interaction between cobalt oxides and the support, and thus enhanced the reduction degree of the Co based catalysts. Clearly, this conclusion is in accordance with the results from XRD characterizations. 3.2.3 NH3-TPD In the present investigation, NH3-TPD is used to compare the acidity distinction of Co/γ-Al2O3, Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 and Co/SiO2. Fig. 3 shows that Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a typical double-peak. The two desorption peaks at the lower temperature (200–300°C) and the higher temperature (350–600°C) correspond to the weak and strong acid sites on the catalyst surface, respectively. As for Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 and Co/SiO2, the higher temperature peak could not be observed obviously. The acidic capacity of the samples is listed in Table 2 , it can be found that the total acidity decreased from 0.37mmol NH3/g in curve (a) to 0.21mmol NH3/g in curve (b), and further reduced to 0.09mmol NH3/g in curve (c). Combination with the above results, it is clearly that SiO2 has a lower acidity than γ-Al2O3. And, the addition of SiO2 to Co/γ-Al2O3 dramatically decreased the total acidity, especially the strong acidity of this catalyst. As shown in Table 1, with the addition of 64wt% SiO2 to Co20/γ-Al2O3, the selectivity of benzyl alcohol increased from 41.9% to 92.3% while the selectivity of toluene decreased from 57.6% to 7.1%. Thus, it can be concluded that the lower acidity is responsible for inhibiting the hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol, namely, the addition of SiO2 can increase the selectivity of benzyl alcohol, and these are in consistent with the results reported by Saadi et al. [34]. From Table 2, it is interesting that Co/SiO2 with lower total acidity than Co/SiO2-γ–Al2O3 displayed a lower selectivity of benzyl alcohol; this result seems contradictive with the above conclusion. Thus, further studies of these catalysts are required to clear some misunderstandings. 3.2.4 N2 sorption The nitrogen sorption isotherms of Co/γ-Al2O3, Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 and Co/SiO2 at 77K are depicted in Fig. 4 . All isotherms displayed an evident hysteresis loop, being indicative sign of the mesoporosity of these catalysts. The uptake of N2 at high relative pressure only slightly decreased, with the addition of 64wt% SiO2 to the catalyst. But for Co/SiO2, the uptake of N2 was decreased to only about 80% of that of Co/γ-Al2O3, demonstrated that the pore structure of the catalyst has been greatly changed when using SiO2 as the catalyst support. The texture characteristics calculated from N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of these Co based catalysts are summarized in Table 3 . The BET specific surface area and total pores volume of Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 are only slightly lower than that of Co/γ-Al2O3. But, when it comes to Co/SiO2, the BET specific surface area and total pores volume both obviously decreased due to the formed micro pores on this catalyst. The activities and selectivity of the catalyst in reaction are dependent on the surface area and structure of the applied supports, respectively [15]. For the current results, the pore size of the Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 decreased very slightly, indicating that the addition of SiO2 did not change the pore structure of the alumina supports too much. Based on the above results, it was proved that the enhanced activity and selectivity of the modified catalyst were not derived from the change of pore structure, but by the change of acidity and reduction degree as mentioned in the previous discussions. When taking pure SiO2 as support, the BET pore size of the Co based catalyst decreased very sharply. This might be leading to two aspects influence on the catalytic performance of this catalyst. Firstly, the lower surface area probably decreases the dispersion of the Co species; Secondly, the formed micro pores on the catalyst can surely reduce the mass transfer ability of the catalyst. Clearly, both of the two aspects might result in the poor catalytic performance of the Co/SiO2 as shown in Table 1."
8,Generality of Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2,"3.3 Generality of Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 The generality of Co/γ-Al2O3–SiO2 was investigated through a collection of aromatic aldehydes, the obtained results are summarized in Table 4 . It can be found that the established process appears to be effective for the chemoselective hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes. All the selected aromatic aldehydes could be transformed to the corresponding benzyl alcohols with selectivity above 95.0%. Thus, the generality of the catalyst has been proved by the reaction results in Table 4."
9,Conclusion,"SiO2 modified Co/γ-Al2O3 was certified as the optimization catalyst for the reduction of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol in a continuous process. After an intensive study on the prepared catalysts via several physical measurements, it was found that addition of SiO2 apparently reduced the strong interaction between metal oxide and support, and also diminished a large number of weak and strong acid sites on the catalyst. The first aspect apparently facilitated the reduction of metal oxide, and improved the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst; while the second aspect greatly inhibited the hydrogenolysis of the CO bond, and thus increased the selectivity of benzyl alcohol."
