0,Introduction,"Fatty alcohols are very important commodity chemicals. They are valuable products used in detergents industry, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications, or as textile auxiliary [1]. Unsaturated fatty alcohols, like oleyl alcohol ((Z)-Octadec-9-en-1-ol), offer advantages over saturated ones, for the same chain length, such as lower melting point, higher water solubility and the possibility to introduce functional groups [2]. They are special products since they are only obtained from natural raw materials. Industrial production is currently based on the high pressure hydrogenation (260–300°C and 25–30MPa) of fatty methyl esters and fatty acids, obtained from vegetable oils trough transesterification or hydrolysis reactions [3,4]. These processes use solid catalysts of the zinc chromite-type that promote the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl group instead of the carbon–carbon double bound hydrogenation [5]. The drawbacks of these processes are the severe reaction conditions and the lixiviation of hexavalent chromium, which is recognized for its high toxicity. Strong environmental restrictions are the driving force behind the search for new, more efficient and less polluting processes. Within this context, the catalysts have a fundamental role. For the last two decades, several studies have been made with catalysts containing group VIII metals (i.e. ruthenium) with a second metal like tin, as promoter, to carry out the carbonylic hydrogenation of fatty methyl esters and fatty acids at lower conditions of pressure and temperature [6–9]. Besides, these metals are less toxic than chromium. In one of the pioneer works with these catalysts, Narasimhan et al. [6] demonstrated that in presence of catalysts Ru-Sn-B and Ru-Sn-B/Al2O3 it was possible to hydrogenate methyl oleate selectively to oleyl alcohol at moderate conditions (4.4MPa and 270°C). Later, in a research carried out by Cheah et al. [7] the hydrogenation of oleic acid was evaluated with the catalyst Ru-Sn/Al2O3. In this study the effect of variables like the atomic ratio of the metals, the preparation method, the type of support and the precursor of the metals on the conversion and selectivity to unsaturated alcohol were analyzed. In particular, it was reported that the best catalyst was prepared from chlorine-free ruthenium and tin precursors. However, in this report the catalysts were not characterized. Up to date, a few reports on the effect of the residual chlorine on the performance of Ru-Sn have been published. For example, Tahara et al. [10] reported that chlorine avoids reduction of Sn to a low valent state for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids, lowering the yield of formed alcohol. The best results were obtained from precursors based on organic salts (Bu3Sn)2O and Sn(OEt)4. In addition, Ishii et al. [11] reported that chlorine had a negative effect on the activity of Ru-Sn catalysts for the hydrogenation of ethyl phenyl acetate. However, washing the metal-chloride-based catalysts with alkali or water had a positive effect on its activity. Elimination of residual chlorine on catalysts prepared from RuCl3 has been the objective of several researches [12,13] due to the relatively low cost and availability of this ruthenium salt. In a report of Mazzieri et al. [12], several chlorine-removal methods were evaluated. They reported that washing the catalysts with 10% NH4OH solution reduces chlorine content even more than calcination or hydrogen reduction treatments but chlorine was not completely eliminated. In a recent study [13], it was reported that hydrazine reduction eliminates completely residual chlorine of catalysts prepared from RuCl3 and that the activities of the catalysts in the ammonia synthesis were higher after this treatment. However, hydrazine has severe drawbacks due to its high toxicity in aquatic ecosystems and health risks. In this study, the effect of the metal precursors (ruthenium and tin chlorides vs ruthenium nitrate and tin acetate) on the carbonylic hydrogenation of methyl oleate is analyzed. Additionally, elimination of chlorine of catalysts based on metal chlorides is studied by washing with ammonium hydroxide and reduction with several reagents (hydrazine, sodium borohydride and hydrogen)."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The support (γ-Al2O3), metal precursors Ru(C5H7O2)3, RuCl3·nH2O, Sn(CH3COO)2, SnCl2·2H2O) and methyl oleate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride was purchased from Acros Organics."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation All the catalysts were obtained through the impregnation method. For bimetallic catalysts prepared from inorganic chlorides, RuCl3 and SnCl2 were dissolved in water and γ-Al2O3, previously degassed in nitrogen, was impregnated with this solution. The so-obtained solid was then dried under reduced pressure. For chloride-free bimetallic catalysts, ruthenium acetyl acetonate was converted into the corresponding nitrate by reaction with concentrated nitric acid prior to the catalyst preparation [7]. Then, the ruthenium nitrate and tin acetate were dissolved in ethanol. Alumina was impregnated with this solution following the same procedure described above. For impregnation of monometallic catalysts, water or ethanol was employed as solvent, the former for catalysts based on metal chlorides and the latter for those based on chlorine-free precursors. Monometallic catalysts were prepared with a fixed amount of ruthenium (2%) or tin (4.7%). For the bimetallic catalysts, 2% of ruthenium and an atomic ratio Sn/Ru of 2 were employed, according to previous studies [6,7]. To evaluate the removal of residual chlorine, metal-chloride-based bimetallic catalysts were treated by different methods reported in literature. In addition, a method based on reduction with sodium borohydride was evaluated. In this method, a solution of sodium borohydride and deionizated water was prepared (molar ratio of Ru+Sn to NaBH4 1:6). Then, this solution was added dropwise to the metal-impregnated solid until reduction was accomplished. The solid was then decanted and washed with water several times until neutral pH. In order to have a comparison criterion, one sample of catalyst was neither calcinated nor reduced. In Table 1 the procedures are listed. The catalysts are designated as Cl and ClF indicating that they are prepared from chlorine-containing precursors and from chlorine-free precursors, respectively."
4,Hydrogenation reaction,2.3 Hydrogenation reaction Hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a in a batch reactor (27mL) equipped with magnetic stirring. The reactor was charged with both methyl oleate and the catalyst. The reactor was then purged with hydrogen four times at 2MPa to remove air. The temperature was increased up to 270°C at constant pressure (2MPa) and then the pressure was increased up to 5MPa and maintained during the reaction.
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The elemental composition of catalyst was determined by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. EDX analyses were carried out in a JSM-5910LV scanning electron microscope with Oxford Instruments INCA energy analyzer. XRF was accomplished with an ARL OPTIM’X WDXRF spectrometer. Phase identification was accomplished by X-ray diffraction recorded on a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation (wavelength=0.1548nm) over the 2h range between 10° and 80° at a scanning speed of 2°/min at 40kV and 30mA. TPR analyses were carried out in a laboratory-made apparatus consisting of a heated tubular reactor coupled to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), samples were heated under hydrogen at a heating rate of 5°C/min from 25°C to 500°C. Surface area and pore size of the catalysts were analyzed by physical adsorption of N2 at −196°C employing a Micromeritics Gemini V apparatus. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography employing a 50m×0.25mm RTX-5 capillary column and a mass detector. The carrier gas was hydrogen. The fatty alcohols were derivatized to sylil ethers prior the analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization In Table 2 it is observed that the catalysts and the support exhibit similar values of surface area, mean pore diameter, and pore volume, regardless of the metal precursor. This indicates that the structure of the support is hardly changed through the impregnation process. According to the pore sizes obtained, the catalysts can be classified as mesoporous, making them suitable for reactions involving large molecules like methyl esters. From EDX analyses (Table 3 ), differences in the surface elemental composition are observed with the different treatments of the samples. First of all, calcination and hydrogen reduction diminish the surface content of the metals which can be due to migration of alumina and, in the specific case of ruthenium, due to sublimation as RuO2. Washing with ammonium hydroxide and hydrazine reduction show a further decrease in metal surface content, possible due to leaching. However, leaching of ruthenium is more severe with hydrazine reduction and it was evidenced by a slightly dark color of the washing water. Increasing of the leaching can be caused by heating during reduction, which increases solubility of RuCl3 in water. Borohydride reduction produces less leaching of the metals, because this reduction is very fast and it is carried out at room temperature. From Tables 3 and 4 , it is evident that residual chlorine is removed from the bimetallic catalysts based on metal chlorides by the different treatments. Respect to the initial content of chlorine in non-treated bimetallic catalyst (4.78%), reduction with hydrogen eliminates most of it. All the other treatments further improved Cl-removal. Chlorine was not detected by EDX when samples were treated with hydrazine or NaBH4. However, by XRF a small amount of chlorine was detected in the sample reduced with hydrazine but it was not observed in the sample reduced with NaBH4. Up to date, the only method which has been reported for the complete chlorine removal on this kind of catalysts is the chemical reduction with hydrazine in KOH solution [13]. Therefore, it is very noteworthy our finding that the reduction with borohydride eliminates residual chlorine from Ru-catalysts in a safe and efficient way. The reaction of transition metals and sodium borohydride has been reported in many studies, but the purpose of those has been, generally, the production of hydrogen [14]. To the best of our knowledge, no other study with the aim of eliminating residual chlorine of these hydrogenation catalysts by NaBH4 reduction has been made. It seems that borohydride reduces chlorides of group VIII metals like RuCl3 to zerovalent state [15] and therefore, chloride ion can be easily eliminated by washing with water. On the other hand, reduction of chlorine from SnCl2 is not a difficult task since it has been reported that calcination at 400°C followed by washing with NaOH solution eliminates chlorine totally [10]. For this reason, it is possible that chlorine from SnCl2 was eliminated by calcination and/or washing steps. According to XRD analysis, important differences are found in the catalysts prepared from both precursors (Fig. 1 ). For the monometallic tin catalysts no peaks different to alumina were observed, indicating a high dispersion of the metal in the support which can be due to the high affinity between tin and alumina [16]. For the monometallic ruthenium catalysts, synthesized from both precursors, the presence of peaks corresponding to RuO2 was evidenced, possibly due to re-oxidation in the passivation step. Formation of Ru-Sn alloy was evidenced in the bimetallic catalysts, which is in agreement with other reports [8,17–19]. The nature of this alloy is not clarified yet, but it has been reported that it could correspond to Ru3Sn7. On the other hand, Ru-Sn peaks of chlorine-free bimetallic catalyst were less prominent. Therefore, Ru-Sn alloy particles seem to be smaller in this catalyst and a higher dispersion is obtained. Bimetallic catalyst reduced with NaBH4 only shows peaks corresponding to γ-Al2O3 in agreement with Narasimhan et al [17]. This indicates that Ru and Sn species were highly dispersed in the support, which is possible due to the fact that this catalyst was not calcinated, in contrast with the other catalysts. The negative effect of calcination over dispersion of ruthenium-based catalysts has been reported [12]. TPR spectra for monometallic and bimetallic catalysts synthesized from the two types of precursors and bimetallic catalyst reduced with NaBH4 are shown in Fig. 2 . For the monometallic tin catalysts, no peaks were detected in the studied range of temperatures, probing the very low reducibility of Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, which has been attributed to the strong interaction between Sn and alumina [16,20]. For the monometallic ruthenium catalysts, important differences are obtained depending on the precursor employed. When inorganic chloride was used, two peaks were obtained, a small peak with a maximum at 148°C and a bigger one with a maximum at 170°C, in accordance with results obtained in other studies [12,21,22]. In those reports, the peak at lower temperature was attributed to the reduction of RuCl3, indicating that the chlorine was not completely eliminated after the calcination at 500°C, and the peak at higher temperature was attributed to the reduction of ruthenium oxide. For the chlorine-free catalyst, a single reduction peak was obtained at 170°C, which corresponds to the reduction of ruthenium oxide as shown above. According to the sizes of the reduction peaks of ruthenium oxide for both monometallic catalysts, it can be said that a fraction of ruthenium on the catalyst based on chloride precursor was not reduced at this temperature. This fraction could remain as RuCl3 or other Ru-Cl species which are difficult to reduce. According to Maroto et al. [21], the use of RuCl3 as a precursor leads to the presence of residual chlorine species at the surface of the catalyst, which affects H2 and CO adsorption. The addition of tin drastically changes the reducibility properties of the ruthenium catalysts. First of all, the bimetallic catalyst based on metal chlorides presented a small peak with a maximum at 148°C, indicating the presence of ruthenium chloride. Another peak, larger than the previous one was observed at 170°C, which corresponds to isolated ruthenium oxides. A third peak with a maximum at about 232°C can be attributed to the reduction of ruthenium species in interaction with tin compounds [9]. This evidences that tin inhibits accessibility of hydrogen to ruthenium. For the chlorine-free bimetallic catalyst, only two peaks were observed at 170°C and 240°C, corresponding to reduction of ruthenium oxides and Ru-Sn species, respectively. The second peak of this catalyst is smaller than the respective one on the catalyst based on inorganic chlorides. In addition, the maximum temperature of reduction of former is higher than the latter. This indicates a more effective modification of properties of ruthenium by tin when chlorine is absent. For the bimetallic catalyst reduced with sodium borohydride a similar profile to the one from chlorine-free precursor is obtained. However, in the former, the peaks are displaced to higher temperatures and the hydrogen consumption of the larger peak was lower. This indicates that Ru-Sn species were less reducible when the catalyst was reduced with NaBH4. Indeed, Pouilloux et al. [9] demonstrated that the species formed during NaBH4 reduction were either less reducible or not re-oxidized during the passivation step, this species could be alloys like Ru3Sn7. The catalyst obtained by borohydride reduction presented both a higher formation and dispersion of Ru-Sn species compared to the catalyst obtained from chlorine-free precursors probable due to: (i) the borohydride reduction is carried out in an aqueous phase that dissolves both reduction agent and chlorine ions, while hydrogen reduction is carried out in gas phase, (ii) the aqueous media allows an intimate mixing of solid and reduction agent, and (iii) NaBH4 treatment involved reduction of metal salts, while hydrogen treatment involved reduction of metal oxides formed in the calcination step which is a more difficult task. XRD and TPR analyses were carried out on the catalyst RuSn-ClF(BH) to determine the effect of the NaBH4 reduction on catalysts prepared from chlorine-free precursors. Treatment with NaBH4 of the catalyst RuSn-ClF(BH) requires a previous calcination of the impregnated solid in order to eliminate organic compounds, therefore, it implied the reduction of metallic oxides. TPR profile shows a large peak at 170°C, which indicates the reduction of RuO2, and a small peak at 240°C corresponding to reduction of Ru-Sn species. However, compared to the catalyst reduced with hydrogen, it is observed both a considerable higher formation of RuO2 and a lower presence of Ru-Sn species. XRD analysis shows the presence of RuO2 but Ru-Sn species were not detected which is possible due to their low content on the catalyst. These results suggest that borohydride treatment partially reduces RuO2 and therefore the formation of Ru-Sn alloys is scarce. This indicates that the treatment with NaBH4 is not enough to reduce most of RuO2 and the catalyst needs a thermal treatment with hydrogen to accomplish this task."
8,Hydrogenation reactions,"3.2 Hydrogenation reactions Monometallic ruthenium catalysts showed high activity, and almost total conversions were obtained in few hours in the hydrogenation reaction, regardless of the metal precursor (Table 5 ). High activity of ruthenium catalysts has been reported [7], and it was explained by its high reducibility, evidenced in the TPR analysis. However, these catalysts promote hydrogenation of carbon–carbon double bonds producing mainly methyl stearate, indicating the non-selective character of this metal toward carbonyl group hydrogenation. On the other hand it was observed that monometallic-tin catalysts were not active in the hydrogenation reaction of methyl oleate. Therefore, it is re-inforced the already known fact that the role of tin is to poison ruthenium and decrease its activity. Chlorine has not a visible effect on the properties of monometallic catalysts or perhaps its effect could be masked by the high activity of ruthenium catalysts or by the inactivity of tin catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts show considerably lower conversions of methyl oleate than monometallic ruthenium catalysts (Figs. 3–5 ) which can be explained by the formation of Ru-Sn species which are less reducible as was demonstrated by XRD and TPR analysis. In addition, formation of heavy esters, which were one of the main products, can explain the lower activity of bimetallic catalyst, too. These heavy esters, formed through the transesterification reaction between methyl ester and the alcohol previously formed could limit the access of the hydrogen to the catalyst due to the esteric hindrance, during the first hours of reaction [7]. Oleyl alcohol was formed selectively on the catalysts as the product of the hydrogenolysis of the carbonyl group of methyl oleate. Other by-products were methyl stearate and saturated alcohol. The former is formed by hydrogenation of methyl oleate, and the latter is formed by hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohol or by hydrogenolysis of methyl stearate. Results shown suggest that in this case the hydrogenolysis of methyl stearate is the main source of saturated alcohol. Metal-chloride-based catalyst (Fig. 3) shows a rapid formation of heavy esters at the beginning of reaction. At conversions above 30% the formation of heavy esters decreases, while there is a sudden increase in the formation of unsaturated alcohol, possibly due to the hydrogenolysis reaction to afford two molecules of alcohol. Methyl stearate is formed at the beginning of reaction but it is consumed possible by hydrogenolysis reaction to produce stearyl alcohol, which increases slowly with conversion. The catalyst based on chlorine-free precursors (Fig. 4) has a higher selectivity to oleyl alcohol and lower formation of heavy esters than the metal-chloride-based catalyst. This indicates that residual chlorine has a negative effect over the selectivity to oleyl alcohol, and increases the rate of the transesterification reaction. This is explained by the fact that chlorine lowers the formation of Ru-Sn species, such as it was suggested by TPR analysis, rendering isolated ruthenium and tin species. According to Pouilloux et al. [9], the formation of heavy esters is catalyzed by tin oxides without interaction with ruthenium particles. In comparison with the other catalysts, the bimetallic catalyst reduced with NaBH4 (Fig. 5) presents a remarkable higher suppression of transesterification reaction, i.e. less heavy esters formation, and a higher selectivity to oleyl alcohol (about 74%). It seems that the reduction step eliminates residual chlorine of this catalyst, favoring formation of Ru-Sn species, but the additional factor that could improve the selectivity to oleyl alcohol is the higher dispersion of this species, demonstrated in XRD analysis and discussed above."
9,Conclusions,"The effect of inorganic chlorides or organic salts as metal precursors of RuSn/Al2O3 catalysts on the selective hydrogenation of methyl oleate to oleyl alcohol has been evaluated. The best catalysts were obtained either from chlorine-free sources or after elimination of residual chlorine on metal-chloride-based catalysts. However, the most selective catalyst was obtained by NaBH4 reduction of catalyst prepared from chlorine precursors (selectivity=74%, methyl oleate conversion=75%). According to TPR analysis it is possible that residual chlorine avoids, at certain extent, an effective modification of properties of ruthenium by tin. On the other hand, Ru-Sn alloys were observed by XRD for metal-chloride-based bimetallic catalyst, however dispersion of this species is low. It is very noteworthy that reduction with NaBH4 eliminates residual chlorine of metal-chloride-based catalysts in a safe and effective way. In addition, when this treatment is given to non-calcinated catalyst it renders a higher dispersion of Ru-Sn species demonstrated by XRD analysis, improving the selectivity to oleyl alcohol. In fact, formation and dispersion of Ru-Sn species seems to be essential to obtain a higher selectivity to oleyl alcohol, and lowering transesterification reaction rate."
