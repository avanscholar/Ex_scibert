0,Introduction,"Modern society demands the development of economical and energy-efficient processes for the sustainable production of chemicals and clean fuels. Furfural, derived from abundant and renewable biomass, has wide range of applications and is one of the major platform chemicals [1,2]. The main raw materials of furfural are corncobs, and China concentrates the largest part of global furfural production [3,4]. The use of furfural itself is the comprehensive utilization of waste and it also decreases the amount of haze produced by burning corn straw [5]. Therefore, the preparation of furfural, not only alleviates environmental problems, but also has very important significance on the revitalization of the economy and promotion social development [6]. Furfuryl alcohol (FA), produced by the hydrogenation of furfural, is a very valuable chemical and is extensively applied in the fine chemical and polymer industries [7,8]. FA has wide applications in the production of synthetic fibers, rubbers, acid proof bricks, thermostatic resins, corrosion resistant glass fiber and it is also a significant intermediate chemical in the synthesis of lysine, vitamin C, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and plasticizer [9,10]. The major route for the production of FA is gas-phase catalytic hydrogenation of furfural [11,12]. This reaction requires high reaction temperature and pressure. It is demonstrated that a hydrogen generation station is needed to provide the hydrogen in the production of FA [13]. Hence, the hydrogenation of furfural at high pressure will result in security problems, for example, leakage of reactants, storage of hydrogen, explosion of reactor, etc. Additionally, the selectivity for the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural is low, because of the formation of side-products, such as 2-methyfuran, 1,5-pentanediol etc. [14]. Compared with traditional chemical routes, electrochemical synthesis route could decrease the emission of pollutant and decrease the production cost of furfural to FA. The electrochemical hydrogenation of furfural to prepare FA is a typical hydrogenation reaction. Therefore, it is of importance to choose the optimal electrocatalyst for improving the selectivity and current efficiency [15]. For decades, in the industry of furan, copper chromite is used as the catalyst for the hydrogenation of furfural to FA. However, the activity of copper chromite is moderate. Copper chromite is of high toxicity and could cause severe environmental pollution [16,17]. Thus, in order to obtain high selectivity for FA, there is an urgent need to develop a new catalyst without Cr [18,19]. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation provides a mild alternative method to conventional chemical catalysis [20]. This method uses electrons as the reducing agent, and avoids the use of toxic reagents [21]. This route not only decreases the pollution to the environment, but also greatly lowers the cost of catalyst [22]. The electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural to FA is widely used in the field of organic electrosynthesis. Although the interest in electrocatalytic technologies for furfural transformation is currently increasing, the research of electrochemical mechanism and kinetics at different electrodes are rare. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at seven electrodes, and choose the optimal electrode for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural. Then we studied the mechanism for the reduction of furfural to FA by liner sweep voltammetry, and obtained the selectivity and current efficiency by potentiostatic electrolysis. The research on the mechanism of the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural offers guiding significance to choose the optimal electrocatalyst."

All experiments were performed in aqueous solutions using deionized water (18.25MΩ·cm) as solvent. Before electrochemical experiments, furfural was distilled under vacuum in order to keep the purity level. The electrode materials included Pb, Cu, Ni, Fe, Ti, C (refers to graphite electrode), Pt, and the purity of all metal electrodes was above 99.99%."
3,Electrochemical experiments,"2.2 Electrochemical experiments The working electrodes were seven planar materials including Cu, Pb, Ni, Fe, Ti, C, Pt. These electrodes all have a geometric area of 1×1cm2. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was served as reference electrodes, all the potentials were quoted with respect to SCE. A Pt foil with surface area of 1×1cm2 was used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was 0.1M Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer solution (pH=10). The linear sweep voltammetry was measured by electrochemical workstation (CHI-660E, CHI instruments, China,).

5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogen evolution characteristics,"3.1 Hydrogen evolution characteristics Linear sweep voltammograms at different electrodes in 0.1M Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer solution (pH=10) are shown in Fig. 1 . The onset potential is about −1.3V at Cu and Pb electrodes. When the potential is −1.4V, the current densities of Cu and Pb electrodes are 1.15mAcm−2 and 0.89mAcm−2, respectively. The onset potential is about −1.1V at Ni and Fe. When the potential is −1.4V, the current densities are 6.12mAcm−2 and 8.20mAcm−2, respectively. The onset potential is about −0.8V at Pt, Ti and C. When the potential is −1.4V, the current densities at Pt, Ti and C are 16.8mAcm−2, 15.5mAcm−2 and 15.8mAcm−2, respectively. At the potential of −1.4V, the comparison of current densities at different electrodes is Pt>C>Ti>Fe>Ni>Cu>Pb. It is found that the onset potential is more negative and the current densities were relatively low for the HER at Cu and Pb. The overpotential and exchange current density has direct relationship with the HER. From the data shown in Table 1 , the comparison of the Tafel intercept (a) at seven electrodes is Pb>Cu>Ni>Fe>Ti>C>Pt. The Tafel intercepts (a) represents the value of overpotential at the current density of 1Am−2. It shows that for the HER, when the current density was 1Am−2, the overpotential of Pb is relatively high and it is difficult to occur the HER. The overpotential of Pt is relatively low, and HER is easy to occur. The Tafel slope (b) determines the increasing rate of the overpotential versus the logarithms of the current density. The sequence of (b) of seven electrodes is Pb>Cu>>C>Pt>Ti>Ni>Fe. The higher the value of b, the greater the magnitude of the overpotential increases with the logarithms of the current density. The comparison of the exchange current density at seven electrodes was Pt>C>Ti>Fe>Ni>Cu>Pb. In the same system, the higher the exchange current density and the lower overpotential for the HER, the HER could be performed more easily. From Table 1, the exchange current density at Pt electrode was 10−1. 78 Am−2 and the a value was 0.21V. The exchange current density was relatively high and when the current density was 1Am−2, the overpotential was relatively small, so Pt electrode was the most active for the HER. Moreover, the exchange current density at Pb was 10−11. 18 Am−2 and the a value was 1.32V. The exchange current density is relatively low and the overpotential is relatively high, therefore, the HER at Pb is difficult. The sequence of the exchange current density at seven electrodes for the HER is Pt>C>Ti>Fe>Ni>Cu>Pb [23]. The HER processes include charge transfer step, chemical desorption step or electrochemical desorption step [24,25]. Possible reaction processes are as follows: (1) H 2 O + e − + M → M − H + OH − Charge transfer (2) M − H + M − H → 2 M + H 2 Chemical desorption (3) H 2 O + e − + M − H → M + OH − + H 2 Electrochemical desorption The rate determining step of the HER at different electrodes could be known by the Tafel slopes (b) and the electron transfer coefficient α [26]. The process for the HER in 0.1M Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer (pH=10) is the electro-reduction of a water molecule with the formation of hydrogen atom adsorbed on the electrode surface, followed by electrochemical hydrogen evolution or chemical hydrogen evolution. The results in Table 1 shows that the Tafel slopes (b) at Cu and Pb electrodes are close to 118mV, and the electron transfer coefficient (α) is close to 0.5, so the rate determining step of the HER at the two electrodes is Eq. (1), namely, the charge transfer step; the Tafel slope at Ni and Fe electrodes are close to 29.5mV, and α is close to 2, therefore, the rate determining step is Eq. (2), in other words, the chemical desorption step; the Tafel slope at Ti, C, Pt electrodes are close to 39mV, and α is close to 1.5, thus the rate determining step is Eq. (3), namely, the electrochemical desorption step."
7,Mechanism and kinetics of electrochemical synthesis FA,"3.2 Mechanism and kinetics of electrochemical synthesis FA Preliminary indications for the reduction of furfural at different electrodes could be obtained by comparing the linear sweep voltammogram with and without furfural. Fig. 2 shows the cathodic linear sweep voltammograms at different electrodes (Cu, Pb, Ni, Fe, C, Pt, Ti) in 0.1M Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer solution (pH=10). The curves of a are the linear sweep voltammograms in 0.1M Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer solution (pH=10) without furfural; the curves of b are 0.1M Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer solution (pH=10) with 0.1M furfural. These two curves are compared in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2, the onset potential at Cu electrode for the HER is −1.3V. After adding furfural, the reduction of furfural increased appreciably where it occurs more positively at −1.23V than HER and reaches 3.97mAcm−2 at −1.4V. The potential at Pb electrode also has a positive shift. At −1.4V, the current density changed from 1.05mAcm−2 to 3.18mAcm−2 after adding furfural. When furfural is added, the onset potentials at Ni, Fe and Ti electrodes are almost unchanged, and the current densities increased slightly. The potentials of C and Pt electrodes have a negative shift, which is shifted from −0.80V to −1.21V, −0.80V to −0.84V, respectively. At −1.4V, The current densities at C and Pt electrodes changed from 15.8mAcm−2 to 11.2mcm−2, 16.8mAcm−2 to 12.1mAcm−2, respectively. It is found that when Cu was used as cathode, by contrast, the potential was more positive and the current density changed relatively much higher than other electrodes. It may be the optimal electrode for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural [24]. According to the above data, there exist the HER and the reduction of furfural in 0.1M Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer solution (pH=10) at different electrodes. Fig. 3 represents the mechanism of the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural [27,28]. The potentials shift more positive and the current densities become relatively high compared with the linear sweep voltammograms recorded in the supporting electrolyte without furfural at Cu and Pb electrodes. Therefore, when Cu and Pb electrodes are used as the cathode, the first step for the reduction of furfural was Reaction (3) to produce C free radical, and then the intermediates are transformed into FA according to Reaction (8) or (9). The potentials do not change significantly and the current densities get a slight increase with furfural at Ni, Fe and Ti electrodes. Therefore, the first step for the reduction of furfural is Reaction (2) to generate C free radical, and then the intermediates are transformed into FA according to Reactions (6) or (7). The onset potentials are shifted towards more negative values and the current densities became lower at Pt and C electrodes. It may be due to that the organic adsorbates inhibit the electrodes activity before the reduction of furfural. On account of furfural adsorption to the electrode surface, resulting in the difficulty of the reduction of furfural, and the reduction of furfural on Pt and C cannot react like that on Pb and Cu electrodes. So the potentials of the reduction reaction became negative and the current densities became lower."
8,Potentiostatic electrolysis,"3.3 Potentiostatic electrolysis At the potential of −1.4V, a potentiostatic electrolysis experiment was carried out at room temperature. After 10h, the results are summarized in Fig. 4 . HPLC is used to analyze the product and reactants during the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural. As the electrolysis time gradually extended, FA is the major product formed under these conditions, along with small quantities of the by-products, namely, 2-methylfuran, which is a further reduction product of FA. The reaction is as follows: Image 1 (4) (5) Selectivity = Q 1 / Q 1 + Q 2 (6) Current efficiency = Q 1 / Q = Q 1 / Q 1 + Q 2 + Q 3 Here Q1 is the electricity consumed by furfural to furfuryl alcohol; Q2 is the electricity consumed by furfural to 2-methylfuran; Q3 is the electricity consumed by hydrogen. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the selectivity of FA at Cu electrode is the highest in comparison with other electrodes. It is visible to see that only at Cu electrode, the main reaction was the reduction of furfural to FA, rather than the further reduction of FA to 2-methylfuran (13%), which is illustrated that the further reduction of FA is very difficult at this electrode. Moreover, more than half of FA are transformed into 2-methylfuran after the conversion of furfural to FA (because the selectivity was less than 50% except Cu) at other electrodes, which indicates that in comparison with the conversion of furfural to FA, the further reduction of FA to 2-methylfuran is easier at other electrodes. At Cu and Pb electrodes, furfural obtains electrons directly on the electrode surface to produce the carbon free radicals. While at other electrodes, furfural reacted with the atomic hydrogen to produce carbon free radicals. So it is easier to produce the carbon free radicals at Cu and Pb electrodes. Although it is not active for the HER at Pb, the selectivity of FA is poor. Also, FA is not stable at Pb, more than half of FA converts into 2-methylfuran under the potential of −1.4V. Therefore, Pb electrode is not considered as the electrocatalyst towards the reduction of furfural to FA. The selectivity of other electrodes is lower than Cu, and the current efficiency is lower than Cu and Pb, thus they are not the optimal electrodes for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural to FA. The comparison of the overpotential of HER at seven electrodes is Pb>Cu>Ni>Fe>Ti>C>Pt. In particular, the overpotential is relatively low and the exchange current density is relatively high at Pt, which is the most active electrocatalyst to the HER, so the current efficiency is low for the reduction of furfural to FA. In principle, HER at Pb electrode is difficult to occur, and the current efficiency for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural may be the highest. However, it is found that the current efficiency is the highest at Cu through the experiment, because more by-products are produced on Pb than that on Cu. From the Eq. (6), it can be seen that there exists a Q3 in current efficiency compared to selectivity. Fig. 4 shows that the current efficiency is lower than selectivity at all electrodes, which indicates that Q3 is not zero, and the HER would occur at all electrodes. So the current efficiency is not possible to reach 100%. For the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural to FA, the comparison of the selectivity and the current efficiency at the seven kinds of electrodes is Cu>Pb>Ni>Fe>Ti>C>Pt. Further experiments are carried out at the optimal electrode (Cu), and the results are as follows: (7) Conversion = F t = 0 − F t / F t = 0 × 100 % (8) Yield = FA t / F t = 0 × 100 % Here, [F]t=0 is the mole of starting furfural; [F]t is the mole of ending furfural; [FA]t is the mole of ending furfuryl alcohol. The consumption of furfural and the production of FA during the electrolysis are shown in Fig. 5A. As the electrolytic time extended gradually, the concentration of the reactant (furfural) decreases and the concentration of product (FA) increases. Fig. 5B shows the conversion of furfural and the yield of FA versus the electrolysis time. As can be seen from Fig. 5B, along with the extension of the electrolysis time, the conversion of furfural and the yield of FA shows a rising trend. Within the first six hours, all furfural converted into FA. With the electrolysis time continuing to extend, furfural is not completely transformed into FA, which is established that the by-products (2-methylfuran) is formed after 6h. The FT-IR spectrum can detect the structure of the product. The FT-IR spectrum of the product is shown in Fig. 6 . The broad band at 3326cm−1 is attributed to the OH stretching, the band at 2932cm−1 is attributed to CH stretching of CH2 groups, and sharp peaks at 1507cm−1, 1227cm−1, 1151cm−1, 1006cm−1, 911cm−1, 747cm−1 are attributed to furan rings. So the product is furfuryl alcohol."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, the rate-determining step was the charge transfer step for the HER at Cu electrode. The HER on Cu was only a little bit easier than that on Pb electrode. Furfural obtains electrons directly on the electrode surface to produce carbon free radicals at Cu and Pb electrodes. While at other electrodes, furfural reacts with the atomic hydrogen to produce carbon free radicals. So it is easier to produce carbon free radicals at Cu and Pb electrodes. The reduction of furfural to FA is the main reaction on Cu electrode, while the further reduction of FA to 2-methylfuran is carried out at Pb electrode. Cu electrode is considered to be the optimal electrode among those kinds of electrodes. When Cu is used as the cathode, the current efficiency for the reduction of furfural is 71% and the selectivity of FA is 87%."
