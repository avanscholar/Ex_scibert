0,Introduction,"The increasing energy demands and rapid consumption of fossil fuels emphasize the significance of biofuel production. Biological hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass via anaerobic fermentation is a promising process (Cheng et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2015; Monlau et al., 2013). Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is essential to enhance the efficiency of biohydrogen production because of the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic structure. Several pretreatment methods have been investigated, such as mechanical pretreatment, microwave irradiation, alkali or acid pretreatment, steam explosion, ammonia fiber explosion, hot water treatment, supercritical CO2 treatment and biological pretreatment (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009; Moretti et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2014). Acid pretreatment of lignocelluloses by using sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid has been extensively studied because of its high catabolic activity and high efficiency (Cheng et al., 2015; Liu and Cheng, 2010). However, the increase of acid pretreatment severity (high temperature and/or high acid concentration) leads to an increase of fermentative inhibitors (e.g. furan derivatives and phenolic compounds), which possess significant inhibitory effect on fermentative microorganisms. Therefore, understanding the effects of fermentative inhibitors on fermentation is essential to enhance biofuel production. Fermentative inhibitors are usually classified into three major groups: organic acids such as acetate generated from hemicellulose degradation, furan derivatives such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) from sugar degradation, and phenolic compounds such as vanillin and syringaldehyde derived from lignin (Monlau et al., 2014). These inhibitors negatively affect the cell membrane function, growth and glycolysis of fermentative bacteria (Behera et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the inhibitory effects of fermentative inhibitors on biohydrogen fermentation (Cao et al., 2010; Kongjan et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2014; Park et al., 2011; Quéméneur et al., 2012; Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). Cao et al. demonstrated the inhibition effect of furfural, 5-HMF and phenolic compounds from acid-pretreated cornstalk on thermophilic hydrogen fermentation by using Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 (Cao et al., 2010). Kongjan et al. reported that the hydrogen yield and lag phase for hydrogen production was strongly influenced by high concentration of inhibitors under extreme thermophilic fermentation (Kongjan et al., 2010). Liu et al. reported that the addition of furan derivatives resulted in different microbial communities (Liu et al., 2014). However, the effects of individual inhibitors (i.e. furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde) on mesophilic hydrogen fermentation have seldom been comprehensively studied to date. In this study, the effects of furan derivatives and phenolic compounds on dark hydrogen fermentation from glucose were comparatively evaluated. The hydrogen yield, glucose consumption, inhibitors degradation and formation of soluble metabolite products (SMPs) were investigated to elucidate the inhibition on hydrogen fermentation."
1,Methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum Mixed hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) were isolated from anaerobic digestion sludge sampled from a biogas plant in Zhejiang Province, China. The HPB isolation and enrichment processes were described in previous studies (Cheng et al., 2010). The dominating species in HPB was Clostridium butyricum."
3,Hydrogen fermentation,"2.2 Hydrogen fermentation Table 1 shows the experimental design and characterization of lignocellulose-derived fermentative inhibitors in this study. Batch experiments of hydrogen fermentation were performed in 350mL glass bottles. Control experiment was conducted using 10g/L of glucose as feedstock supplemented with 2g/L of yeast extract as nitrogen source. The effects of fermentative inhibitors on hydrogen fermentation were investigated by separately adding 15mM individual inhibitors (i.e. furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde) to each bottle. Autoclaved deionized water was added to each bottle to adjust the liquor volume to 225mL. The initial pH was adjusted to 6.0±0.1 by using 6M HCl and 6M NaOH solution. The bottles were then inoculated with 25mL of HPB. Subsequently, the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers, purged with nitrogen gas for 10min, and maintained at 35±1.0°C for hydrogen fermentation."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The concentrations of hydrogen and carbon dioxide were analyzed on a gas chromatography system (GC; Agilent 7820A, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 5A column (Φ 3mm×3m; Agilent, USA). The temperatures of injection port and thermal conductivity detector were 200 and 300°C, respectively. The initial column temperature was set at 65°C for 1min, increased to 145°C at a heating rate of 25°C/min, and then held at 145°C for 3min. Argon gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 27mL/min. SMPs were analyzed on another GC system (Agilent 7820A, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-FFAP column (Φ 0.32mm×50m; Agilent, USA). The temperatures of injection port and flame ionization detector were both 250°C. The initial column temperature was set at 100°C for 1min, increased to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min, and then held at 200°C for 2.5min. The concentrations of glucose, furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC; Agilent 1200, USA) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, USA). 5mM H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase at 65°C and a flow rate of 0.5mL/min. Glucose was analyzed using a refractive index detector. Furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde were analyzed using a ultraviolet detector at 278nm. Hydrogen yields were simulated by the modified Gompertz equation, and dynamic parameters (H, cumulative hydrogen yields, mL/g TVS; H m, maximum hydrogen yield potential, mL/g TVS, R m, peak rate of hydrogen production, mL/g TVS/h; λ, lag-phase time of hydrogen production, h; and T m, peak time, h) were calculated using Origin 8.5 software. The inhibitions of individual inhibitor on hydrogen production were quantified using the inhibition coefficient (IC): Inhibition coefficient ( % ) = 100 - H 2 yield from glucose with inhibitors added H 2 yield from glucose × 100 Carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) was defined as the ratio of total weight of carbon in carbon dioxide and SMPs to the total weight of carbon in glucose. The CCE of glucose with different inhibitors was calculated as: Carbon conversion efficiency ( % ) = Carbon yield of CO 2 + Carbon yield of SMPs Total carbon yield of glucose × 100 All experiments were performed in triplicate, and reported data were expressed as mean values±standard deviations."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of individual inhibitors on hydrogen fermentation,"3.1 Effects of individual inhibitors on hydrogen fermentation The effects of individual inhibitors on hydrogen yield and production rate were shown in Fig. 1 a and b. Without the addition of inhibitors, the hydrogen yield from glucose was 247.8±0.95mL/g and the corresponding hydrogen production peak rate was 9.59±1.64mL/g/h. The hydrogen yields decreased to 242.1±0.89, 234.9±21.3, 205.6±1.29 and 215.6±1.74mL/g with the addition of furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde, respectively. The corresponding peak hydrogen production rates decreased to 6.82±1.40, 8.50±2.43, 5.64±0.38 and 5.14±1.67mL/g/h, respectively. These results indicated that the inhibitions of phenolic compounds on hydrogen fermentation were more stronger than those of furan derivatives under the same mole concentration. It appeared that the concentration of 15mM was not the lethal level for hydrogen fermentation. With further increase of inhibitors concentration, it was demonstrated that hydrogen fermentation was gradually inhibited (Cao et al., 2010; Veeravalli et al., 2013). In summary, the addition of furans led to an average decrease of 4.0% in hydrogen yield and 20.1% in peak hydrogen production rate, while phenolics led to an average decrease of 15.0% in hydrogen yield and 43.8% in hydrogen production rate. Although hydrogen fermentation was not completely inhibited by 15mM inhibitors, clear differences between furans and phenolics on hydrogen yield were observed. The dynamic parameters of hydrogen production fitted by the modified Gompertz equation were shown in Table 2 . Whatever inhibitors added, the inhibitions on hydrogen production was observed in terms of the hydrogen yield potential (H m), hydrogen production rate (R m), lag phase (λ) and peak time (T m). This result suggested that different inhibitory effects occurred according to the nature of inhibitor compounds (e.g. functional group and molecular mass) (Table 1). Adding furfural and 5-HMF resulted in decreased hydrogen yield potentials from 250.6 to 249.0 and 239.7mL/g, respectively. The peak rates of hydrogen production correspondingly decreased to some extent. The lag-phase time and peak time of hydrogen production were prolonged. Based on the hydrogen yield potential and hydrogen production rate, hydrogen production was inhibited more by 5-HMF than by furfural. This result was consistent with a previous study, which reported that 5-HMF exerted a larger negative influence on hydrogen production than furfural using T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 (Cao et al., 2010). When vanillin and syringaldehyde were added, the hydrogen yield potentials decreased from 250.6mL/g to 215.4 and 222.5mL/g, respectively. More inhibitions were observed with the addition of vanillin than that of syringaldehyde. This result was attributed to the lower molecular weight of vanillin (152.14g/mol) than syringaldehyde (182.17g/mol). A lower molecular weight phenolic compound caused a rapid diffusion rate into the HPB cell, which potentially had more severe inhibition. Low molecular weight phenolic compounds were considered as more toxic to microorganisms than high molecular weight compounds (Klinke et al., 2004). The ICs of furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde on hydrogen fermentation were calculated as 0.64, 4.35, 14.05 and 11.21, respectively (Table 2). Compared with furan derivatives, phenolic compounds clearly exhibited more inhibitions on the hydrogen fermentation performance. The hydrogen yield potentials and production rates decreased more. The lag-phase time and peak time of hydrogen production were accordingly prolonged more. The different chemical properties (Table 1) of furan derivatives and phenolic compounds led to different hydrogen fermentation performance. Furan derivatives caused detrimental effects on microorganisms by inhibiting cell growth, inducing DNA damage and inhibiting several enzymes of the glycolysis pathway. Phenolic compounds damaged microbial cells by selectively altering the membrane permeability, causing leakage of intracellular components and inactivation of essential enzymatic systems (Monlau et al., 2014). Phenolic compounds were toxic to microbial cells because they increased membrane fluidity, which affected membrane permeability and consequently induced a longer acclimation period of substrate (e.g. glucose)."
7,Glucose consumption and inhibitors degradation during hydrogen fermentation,"3.2 Glucose consumption and inhibitors degradation during hydrogen fermentation The effects of individual inhibitors on glucose concentration and consumption rate were shown in Fig. 2 a and b. The glucose concentration decreased from 10 to 5.68±0.42g/L after 24h fermentation in the control experiment, and then decreased to 0.31±0.01g/L after 48h, as shown in Fig. 1a. Correspondingly, 43.2% and 96.9% of glucose were consumed by HPB at 24 and 48h, respectively. It was observed that whatever inhibitor was added, the assimilation of glucose by HPB was negatively affected to different extents. With the addition of furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde, the consumptions of glucose by HPB after 48h decreased from 96.9% to 79.5%, 74.0%, 23.8% and 55.6%, respectively. This result was in accordance with the decrease of hydrogen production. The inhibition effect on glucose consumption reduced the hydrogen yields and prolonged the peak time of hydrogen production. In average, the addition of furans led to a decrease of 13.2% in peak glucose consumption rate, while phenolics led to a decrease of 19.1% in peak glucose consumption rate. The peak times of glucose consumption were more prolonged when phenolic compounds were added compared with furan derivatives. The addition of vanillin resulted in the most prolonged peak time (72h) of glucose consumption. The prolonged peak time of glucose consumption by vanillin exhibited the lowest hydrogen yield of 205.6mL/g. Considering the chemical properties of phenolic compounds (Table 1), the lower molecular weight phenolic compound (i.e. vanillin) caused more severe inhibition on glucose consumption than higher molecular weight phenolic compound (i.e. syringaldehyde). This result was attributed to the lower molecular weight phenolic compound diffused more rapidly into the cell of HPB, and had more severe inhibition on glucose assimilation. Several studies indicated that low molecular weight phenolic compounds promoted a loss of integrity in cell membranes, and thus affected their ability as selective barriers and enzyme matrices, decreased cell growth and further decreased sugar assimilation (Behera et al., 2014). The degradation of individual inhibitors during hydrogen fermentation was shown in Fig. 3 . Furan derivatives degraded faster than phenolic compounds during hydrogen fermentation, indicating that low molecular weight inhibitors degraded more efficiently by HPB. Furfural and 5-HMF were completely degraded after 48 and 72h fermentation, respectively. Whereas 55.1% of vanillin and 80.3% of syringaldehyde were unconverted after 108h fermentation. The different degradation characteristics during hydrogen fermentation were caused by the intrinsic properties of inhibitors, resulting in different diffusion rates and conversion mechanisms in HPB. Low molecular weight inhibitors (i.e. furfural and 5-HMF) diffused more efficiently into the cell of HPB, and were rapidly degraded. High molecular weight inhibitors (i.e. vanillin and syringaldehyde) diffused slower into the cell of HPB than low molecular weight inhibitors because of the lower membrane permeability. The degradation products of inhibitors were suggested to be the corresponding alcohols in anaerobic fermentation (Behera et al., 2014). The reduction of inhibitors was attributed to the reductive enzymes coupled with cofactors NADH in bacteria. It has been reported that the reductive power of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was significantly lower in the presence of furan aldehydes than that in cultivations without inhibitors. Simultaneous addition of 5-HMF and furfural to the culture caused a decrease in the intracellular level of NADH from 0.48 to 0.20μmol/g DW (Ask et al., 2013). The reaction pathways of inhibitors in HPB were proposed as follows: R-CHO + 2 NADH → HPB, 37 ° C R- CH 2 OH + 2 NAD + where R is the different chemical groups of inhibitors. The reductive power (i.e. NADH) of HPB significantly decreased in the presence of inhibitors, due to the reductive degradation of inhibitors. While the reductive power of HPB was a crucial driving force to convert H+ into H2 during hydrogen fermentation. The reaction pathway of hydrogen production was simplified as (Oh et al., 2011): NADH + H + → HPB, 37 ° C NAD + + H 2 Therefore, the addition of inhibitors reduced the amount of NADH available for hydrogen formation, resulting in the decrease of hydrogen production."
8,Effect of individual inhibitors on soluble metabolite formation during hydrogen fermentation,"3.3 Effect of individual inhibitors on soluble metabolite formation during hydrogen fermentation The effects of individual inhibitors on soluble metabolite formation during hydrogen fermentation was shown in Fig. 4 . Ethanol, acetate, butyrate, propionate and valerate were detected as the main SMPs after hydrogen fermentation. Acetate and butyrate were the main components, accounting for approximately 95% of SMPs. This result was due to the dominating species in HPB was C. butyricum, which prefers acetate and butyrate metabolic pathways. The metabolic pathways of hydrogen production from glucose by C. butyricum are as follows (Ghimire et al., 2015): Acetic acid pathway : C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Butyric acid pathway : C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 As shown in Fig. 4, the major components of SMPs in the control experiment were ethanol (2.8±0.08mM), acetate (38.3±0.37mM), propionate (0.7±0.05mM), butyrate (27.8±0.27mM), and valerate (0.2±0.02mM), suggesting that acetate and butyrate pathways were dominant in hydrogen fermentation. The molar ratio of acetate/butyrate was 1.38 in the control experiment. When furan derivatives and phenolic compounds were added in fermentation, metabolite distribution was similar to that of the control, viz., acetate and butyrate were the main metabolic products. Different acetate/butyrate ratios were found compared with the control (Table 1). With the addition of furfural, 5-HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde, the acetate/butyrate ratios were decreased from 1.38 to 0.94, 1.09, 1.24, and 1.21, respectively. The decrease in acetate/butyrate ratios indicated that the metabolic pathway of hydrogen fermentation was influenced. The addition of inhibitors resulted in lower production of SMPs, which was in accordance with the hydrogen yields."
9,Effect of individual inhibitors on carbon conversion efficiency during hydrogen fermentation,"3.4 Effect of individual inhibitors on carbon conversion efficiency during hydrogen fermentation Glucose was degraded by HPB into H2, CO2 and abundant SMPs (e.g. acetate and butyrate) during dark fermentation. CCE was used to evaluate the distribution of carbon converted from glucose during hydrogen fermentation. The effects of individual inhibitors on CCE during hydrogen fermentation was shown in Fig. 5 . The CCE reached 89.4% in the control experiment. Most of the produced carbon was in the forms of acetic acid, butyric acid and carbon dioxide, accounting for 23.0%, 33.4% and 30.4% of the CCE, respectively. This result confirmed that the HPB conducted acetate and butyrate pathways. When furfural and 5-HMF were added in fermentation, the total CCEs decreased to 86.5% and 87.9%, respectively. This result indicated that furan derivatives negatively affected the conversion of glucose in fermentation. When vanillin and syringaldehyde were added in fermentation, the CCEs decreased to 79.3% and 80.2%. Compared with furan derivatives, phenolic compounds exhibited more stronger inhibition to HPB, which was confirmed by the hydrogen yields."
10,Conclusions,"Phenolic compounds exhibited stronger inhibition on hydrogen production and glucose consumption than furan derivatives. Furan derivatives were completely degraded after 72h fermentation, while over 55% of phenolic compounds remained unconverted after 108h fermentation. The ICs of vanillin and syringaldehyde were higher than those of 5-HMF and furfural. Vanillin exhibited the maximum decrease of hydrogen yield by 17%. The consumed reducing power by inhibitors reduction from R-CHO to RCH2OH was a possible reason contributed to the decreased hydrogen yield."
