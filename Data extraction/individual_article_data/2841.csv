0,Introduction,"The growing trend of urbanization and industrialization is becoming a censorious issue regarding energy scarcity and environmental problems [1–4]. There is an urgent need to explore the carbon-free energy supply to meet the imminent demand for energy and mitigate the climate change issue [5–7]. Hydrogen is considered a clean source of solar energy having heat value 120–142 MJ kg−1 among other hydrocarbon fuels. At present, the worldwide production of hydrogen is more than 44.5 million tons [8] and it will be the major source of energy up to 2080 [9]. Although there are many techniques to produce hydrogen-like thermolysis [10], electrolysis [11], biomass [12], photolysis [10], hydrolysis [13–16] etc. through which photocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach as it has gained significant attention for its diverse potential in energy and environmental applications. The artificial photosynthesis is one of the only green sustainable solutions to address the energy and environmental crisis in the future [17–19]. There are numerous photocatalyst materials that have already been studied by a group of researchers [20–22]. Unfortunately, most of the photocatalyst is ultraviolet (UV) light-responsive that is only 5% of the solar energy [23]. Among them, TiO2 has been widely studied as a promising candidate for water splitting due to its esteemed physical and chemical properties, high stability, earth-abundant, low cost and non-toxic but its high bandgap (3.0 eV–3.2 eV) restrict its absorption at UV region [24]. Moreover, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has widely studied due to its multifunctional physical and chemical properties, low costing, earth-abundant, easy synthesis, environmentally friendly and most important visible light-responsive due to narrow bandgap of 2.7 eV [25–27]. Though, the fast recombination rate and low surface area limit its photocatalytic efficiency. Till now, many researchers have studied the heterojunction of TiO2 and g-C3N4 as it provides a high surface area, reduces charge recombination and absorbs visible light but still, photocatalytic efficiency has not improved considerably [28,29]. These semiconductor materials have shown impressive performance in hydrogen generation when they are combined with the noble metals (Pt, Au, Ag, Pd) because they work as reduction cocatalyst and reduce charge recombination [30–33]. However, the scarcity of noble metals and high cost restrict their usage for large production of hydrogen. Therefore, there is a need to find a promising alternative to these expensive metals to enhance the hydrogen performance of the photocatalysts. Two dimensional (2D) layered material, especially transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD’s) are emerging material due to their unique properties and have been utilizing in different applications [34,35]. Among this sizeable 2D family of TMD’s, the member from the IVA-VIA group especially tin dichalcogenides SnX2 (XS, Se) have attracted significant attention due to low cost, earth-abundant and most important environmentally friendly [36–38]. The synthesis method of the X-Sn-X sandwich-like structure can easily synthesize due to weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction between layers. The direct bandgap, strong light absorption and large surface to volume ratio are those properties that attract them in the field of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. Tin diselenide (SnSe2) is an n-type semiconductor with a narrow bandgap of about 1.37 eV having a CdI2 type layered structure, in which Sn sandwiched between two layers of Se planes and both atoms are covalently bonded with each other [39,40]. The different morphologies of SnSe2 have been synthesized until now by various techniques [41–46] and implemented in a wide variety of applications such as energy storage, solar cells, and electronics [47]. However, the role of SnSe2 in photocatalytic water splitting has not been studied until now except for a few theoretical findings [48,49]. Since SnSe2 has tremendous potential for photocatalytic performance due to appropriate bandgap and structure that can absorb visible light. The theoretical studies showed that SnSe2 has an ability to act as co-catalyst because it can promote charge separation by providing trapping and reduction sites for protons to produce hydrogen [48]. The ability to generate photoinduced electrons at its own surface becomes SnSe2 a novel among other co-catalyst. However, bare SnSe2 performance is not adequate due to the limitation of fast electron recombination and low CB level so there is a need to use it with other suitable material because it will help to reduce the recombination of charge carriers. Tan et al. studied the photocatalytic performance of SnSe2 by building heterojunction with Ag3PO4 [50]. A very recent theoretical study has also proved that the heterostructure of SnSe2 with other semiconductor help to improve the photocatalytic water splitting [48,51]. Here, we report the heterojunction between hierarchical one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 fiber and Quantum Dots (QDs) of g-C3N4 as 1D structure provides a smooth pathway for the fast movement of electrons due to high surface to volume ratio [52,53] and branched structure increases the surface area while QDs also facilitate the absorption of photons on the photocatalytic surface and their smaller size reduces the charges recombination and increase the photocatalytic performance [54–57]. A key factor determining the activity of a photocatalyst is the rate of charge carrier recombination relative to that of interfacial charge transfer. A high rate of charge carrier recombination inevitably decreases the number of free electrons and holes that are available to react with adsorbed molecules and thereby generate free radicals. In particulate systems, decreasing the average particle size is expected to increase the rate of interfacial charge transfer [58]. A lower particle size increases the specific surface area and therefore also increases the number of active surface sites where the photogenerated charge carriers can react with absorbed molecules to form hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. Moreover, the surface charge transfer rate will be improved by an increase in the amount of reactant adsorption [59]. The photoabsorption properties of semiconductors also depend on the particle size in the nanometer range [60]. After that SnSe2 nanoflake grown over this heterojunction by using the CVD method that worked as co-catalyst to enhance the hydrogen performance. Till now, researchers only used mica/Silicon substrate to grow SnSe2 flakes, but we first time tried semiconductor material as a substrate to load tin dichalcogenide by CVD. The composite revealed the highest photocatalytic performance in the visible light irradiation (λ = 420 nm) by generating hydrogen about 2375 μmol. g−1.h−1 with a quantum efficiency of 16.5 %. The photoluminescence, time decay fluorescent spectra and photoelectrochemical results ratified that SnSe2 not only reduces the charge recombination by increasing the transfer of electron but also provides a reactive site for hydrogen production as a cocatalyst. Hence, the photocatalytic hydrogen performance has been increased."

2,Chemical and materials,"2.1 Chemical and materials Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP: Mw = 1300000), Tetrabutyl titanate (C16H40O4Ti), ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), Selenium 99.99 % (Se), Tin Selenide (SnSe), Melamine (C3H6N6) were obtained from Sino Pharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the reagent was used without any purification."
3,Fabrication of electrospun nanofibrous TiO2,"2.2 Fabrication of electrospun nanofibrous TiO2 First, 20 ml of methanol and 1.5 ml of tetra butyl titanate (TBT, 98 %) mixed in a 25 ml Erlenmeyer flask followed with 1.5 ml glacial acetic acid. After that, 2.0 g of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP: Mw = 1300000) dissolved in it and the solution was stirred about 12 hr to form a clear solution. Afterward, 10 ml of the solution was taken in a syringe having a steel needle. The needle connected with a high voltage of 13 kV and the distance between needle and foil maintained about 10 cm. Lastly, the nanofibers were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace to get original TiO2 nanofibers (OTF)."
4,Preparation of hierarchically branched TiO2 nanofibers (HBT),"2.3 Preparation of hierarchically branched TiO2 nanofibers (HBT) The hierarchically branched TiO2 fiber obtained by using alkali hydrothermal treatment. Typically, 0.5 g of OTF and 50 ml of NaOH (10 M aq.) solution put in a Teflon lined autoclave and heated for 3 h at 120 °C. After that sample washed thoroughly with deionized water and treated with HCl (0.1 M aq.) solution to remove Na+ ions by the ion-exchange method. The sample was dried at 60 °C overnight after washing with ethanol."
5,Coating of g-C3N4 onto (HBT) nanofibers,"2.4 Coating of g-C3N4 onto (HBT) nanofibers The nanostructured g-C3N4 loaded on HBT fibers by the vapor deposition method using a self-made setup. It consists of a 100 ml crucible having a small cylinder inside (3 cm height). In general, 50 mg of HBT fibers placed over the top of the cylinder and 6.0 g of melamine on the side of the cylinder. The covered crucible was put in a muffle furnace at a temperature of 520 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1. After the treatment, the white color of HBT fibers changes to yellow that shows nanostructured g-C3N4 grew on the surface of HBT fibers. It is employed that the process of growing g-C3N4 on the surface of the fiber without direct contact with melamine is due to the sublimation ability of melamine and the gaseous phase reaction aspect during the polymerization reaction of melamine to g-C3N4 [69,70]. After that, we denoted this sample as HBTCN. The melamine different amount (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 g) was used while 6.0 g found to be very suitable so all the characterization is also done with a 6.0 g dosage."

The pure SnSe powder (99.9 % alfa) placed in a separate quartz boat at the center of the furnace. The small amount of HBTCN fiber placed at the downstream side of the furnace where the vapors of Se and SnSe were brought together by Ar/H2 gas flowing at a rate of 30 standards cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) under pressure of 120 Torr. The heating zone temperature was maintained between 750 °C at a ramp rate of 15 °C/min and kept it for 15 min, and then the furnace was cooled naturally to room temperature."

11,Results and discussion,"This study first time revealed the loading of SnSe2 nanoflakes over branched 1D TiO2 fiber using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and made heterojunction with TiO2/g-C3N4 for photocatalytic water splitting. First, we prepared original TiO2 fiber (OTF) by electrospinning and hierarchically branched TiO2 (HBT) produced by the alkali hydrothermal method. After that g-C3N4 QDs decorated over the branched structure using CVD method in a muffle furnace and final sample denoted as HBTCN. Then, SnSe2 nanoflakes grown over the HBTCN fiber by adopting the CVD method in a glass furnace and sample denoted as HBT/CN/SnSe2. The synthesis process has shown in Scheme 1 . The morphology of the prepared sample is observed by the field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) as described in Fig. 1 . The as-electrospun TiO2 nanofibers are smooth and uniform as displayed in Fig. 1a. After the alkali hydrothermal treatment, these OTF inherited a hair-like structure without destroying 1D morphology. In Fig. 1b, a substantial number of secondary nanowires have successfully in situ grown on the surface with exceptionally high density that can be observed. The 1D hairy structure remains the same even after the introduction of g-C3N4 QDs as depicts in Fig. 1c and the magnified image (inset of Fig. 1c) reveals that there is the presence of small particles but cannot see clearly due to its small size. Fig. 1d reveals that morphology after loading of SnSe2 nanoflakes on the hairy fiber and the magnified image (inset of Fig. 1d) shows the nanoflakes over the fiber. To further understand the detailed microstructure and internal morphology of the composite sample, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was investigated as disclosed in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2a reveals that the high-density hairy structure is well grown on the surface of nanofiber with a high aspect ratio which agrees well with the result of SEM. The g-C3N4 QDs is uniformly dispersed on the branched fiber which can be observed in Fig. 2b and the inset of Fig. 2b display magnified view of the image with a number of g-C3N4 QDs having size about 3.42 + 1.95 nm (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). The nanoflakes of SnSe2 have also decorated successfully on the hierarchical fiber as shown in Fig. 2c. The selected part of the image is magnified and displayed in the inset of Fig. 2c in which SnSe2 nanoflakes can be seen very clearly having a different size. The High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2d) concedes the crystal lattice fringes of the composite sample HBT/CN/SnSe2. The lattice fringes spacing of 3.5 Å (0.35 nm) corresponds to the (101) and (001) crystal planes of anatase (JCPDS 21-1272) [61]. The spacing of quantum dots crystal lattice fringes is about 3.3 Å (0.33 nm) which corresponds to (002) crystal plane of g-C3N4 (JCPDS 87-1526) [55]. The spacing between the lattice fringes of SnSe2 nanoflake is about 3.3 Å (0.33 nm) which belongs to the (100) crystal plane of SnSe2 (JCPDS card No. 89-3197) [50]. It showed that HBTCN composite is decorated with SnSe2 nanoflakes completely and make an intimate interfacial contact that is favorable for the fast charge transfer and separation. The selected area electronic diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset Fig. 2d) depicts the spotted ring-like structure that shows the polycrystalline nature of the composite HBT/CN/SnSe2. The elemental mapping of the composite sample from the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 2e) clearly shows that the signals for Ti, O, C, N, Se, and Sn were only detected in the core region (Fig. 2f-k) respectively which confirming the heterostructure between HBTiO2, g-C3N4, and SnSe2 which helps to reduce the charge recombination and enhance the photocatalytic performance. The crystal phase and composition of the samples revealed by XRD displayed in Fig. 3 a. The diffraction peaks of composite sample appeared at 2θ values of 26.99° (100), 29.05° (002), 30.73° (011), 40.07° (012), 44.20° (003), 47.69° (110), 52.56° (103), 55.65° (200), and 67.04° (113) corresponds well with the hexagonal phase of SnSe2 (JCPDS card No. 89-3197) having space group P 3 ¯ m1 and a = b =3.810 Å, and c =6.140 Å [50]. The intensity of peaks is not so high that might be due to the low content of SnSe2. There is no other extra peak found that shows the purity of the SnSe2 phase. The diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 should appear at 2θ values of 13.0° (100) and 27.5° (002) (JCPDS, Card No. 87-1526) [62]. All the samples show the diffraction peaks of TiO2 with 2θ values at 25.38°, 37.88°, 48.08°, 53.91°, and 75.0° can be well indexed to the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (204) depicts the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS card No. 21-1272) and rutile phase at 36.3° (101), 41.3° (111), and 54.2° (211) (JCPDS card No. 21-1276). The change in the phase of TiO2 from anatase to rutile is because of the calcination of melamine at high temperature. The one diffraction peak of g-C3N4 at 13.0° (100) well-matched while the other just overlapped with the peak of rutile phase at 27.5° (110) planes. The XRD results are steady with the lattice fringes experiential through HRTEM images. To further understand the chemical composition and structure of the samples, the FT-IR spectrum was studied as depicted in Fig. 3b. The spectra of the composite samples are well-matched with the individual spectrum except for few shifts in a peak. The broad peak of HBT at region 571 cm−1 corresponds to TiOTi stretching band [55] that we can see in the HBTCN sample but after loading SnSe2, it can be observed that this peak shifted to 465 cm−1. The CN sample has different absorption peaks while the several peaks at the band range of 1250−1650 cm−1 ascribed for the stretching vibration band of CN heterocycle and the peak at 808 cm−1 depict the s-triazine unit of the g-C3N4 structure. The broad peak at 3169 cm-1 corresponds to the stretching vibrational and deformation modes of NH [63]. It is revealed that the composite sample also has the absorption at these points which shows that g-C3N4 has also successfully loaded there. When we compare composite peak with CN peak, we found the peak shifted from 1236 cm-1 to 1246 cm-1 that also due to the presence of SnSe2 which imitates the movement of electrons between the surface of the material due to the successful heterojunction. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms characterization was used to find the specific surface area of the prepared samples. All the samples have observed type IV nitrogen adsorption isotherm and have H3 hysteresis loop, as depicted in Fig. 3c that indicates the presence of mesopores [64]. The spectra reveal the HBT sample has the highest specific surface area (205.5 m2 g−1) due to its branched structures that are also the most important advantage of the hierarchical fiber. This surface area reduced to 120.39 m2 g-1 after decorating of the QDs of g-C3N4 on the hairy structure because QDs filled the interstitial spaces of the branched fiber due to their small size but interestingly after loading the nanoflakes of SnSe2 the BET area has increased up to 179.2 m2 g−1 which concede that SnSe2 have effect in increasing the surface area of materials which is also matched with the previous results [61]. The pore size and volume of the samples were investigated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method as shown in the inset of Fig. 3c. The detailed summary of surface area, pore volume and pore size of all the samples given in (Table S1, Supplementary Information). The optical properties of the samples evaluated by using diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) between 200 nm to 800 nm wavelength as observed in Fig. 3d. It is ostensibly from the results that the CN sample absorbs light under visible region, but the absorbance value is not high due to its bulk structure. On the other hand, the HBT sample absorbs a large amount of light due to its hierarchical structure that can harvest more light by increasing the traveling path of light which ultimately enhances the light interaction time and its absorption efficiency but it can only absorb UV light. The reflecting and scattering effect of incident light has increased due to branched structure and light can reach those places where it cannot directly reach. We can see that the composite HBTCN can absorb more light and the absorption edge shifted in the visible region about 430 nm. The surprising results divulged after loading of SnSe2 that not the only absorption is increased or shifted towards visible region but also there is a new absorption band produce near about 700 nm. So, the introduction of narrow bandgap tin dichalcogenide with semiconductor material can improve the light-harvesting which ultimately produces more photo-generated electron-hole that will take place in the photocatalytic process. The bandgap of the samples estimated by the Tauc plot (inset of Fig. 3d). The composite of HBTCN with tin dichalcogenide seems remarkable that the bandgap reduces to 1.70 eV only due to the excellent properties of the SnSe2 and it also matched well with the other experimental and theoretical studies [65–69]. The chemical composition and valence state of the samples was investigated using XPS. The survey spectrum of all the samples displayed in Fig. 4 a while composite sample indicates the presence of Ti, O, C, N, Sn and Se components which are well-matched with the elemental mapping and XRD results. The high-resolution XPS data of C1 s for sample CN and HBT/CN/SnSe2 display at Fig. 4b in which both the samples displays two peaks at 284.6 eV that is for graphite-like sp2 (CC) bonding and relates to graphite carbon nitride while the peak at 288.3 eV indicates NC = N group of sp2 carbon bonded nitrogen [70] while one more peak found in HBT/CN/SnSe2 sample about 290.1 eV that relates to CO bonding. Similarly, the N1 s spectrum (Fig. 4c) shown no obvious shifting and the binding energies of two peaks in both the samples corresponds to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen (CNC) at 398.2 eV and sp3 bonded nitrogen (NC3) at 399.9 eV were found. The high-resolution XPS data of Ti 2p in Fig. 4d displays two peaks at 458.4 eV and 464.1 eV that recognized to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 respectively and the splitting of 5.7 eV designates the oxidation states of Ti+4 [71]. The high-resolution XPS of O1 s (Fig. 4e) in the composite sample identified three types of peaks, the highest peak for TiO linkage at 528.4 eV, another one is for surface hydroxyl group at 530.0 eV, and small peak belongs to adsorb water (83). The high-resolution spectra of Se 3d (Fig. 4f) revealed two peaks that belongs to Se 3d5/2 (54.0 eV) and Se 3d3/2 (53.0 eV), inferring the presence of Se2− [72]. The Sn 3d spectra in Fig. 4g represents two strong peaks at a binding energy of 486.7 eV and 495.3 eV that identified to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 respectively while the gap of 8.4 eV shows the oxidation state Sn4+ [73]. These XPS results ensure the successful loading of g-C3N4 QDs and SnSe2 over HBTiO2 fiber. Raman spectra were interpreted to explore the crystal structure of the composite sample HBT/CN/SnSe2. Fig. 4h depicts that there are two in and out a plane of vibrational Raman modes of SnSe2. The Eg mode present at peak position 108 cm−1 depicts the in-plane vibrational mode and shows 2H-SnSe2 crystal [65]. The second peak at 188 cm−1 assigned to A1g shows the out plane vibrational mode of SnSe2 while the low intensity of A1g is might be due to the small thickness of particles. There is no peak of SnSe which shows the formation of pure SnSe2 crystal. The tetragonal space group of D4th both for rutile and anatase of HBT shows in the Raman mode. The peak at 244 cm-1 represents the Eg mode of the rutile phase while the mode B1g, B1g/A1g and A1g of anatase have been observed at peak position 401 cm−1, 520 cm−1 and 640 cm−1 [74]. The broad peak of sample CN also can be seen from 1000 cm−1 to 2000 cm−1 which well-matched with the previous reports [75]. The Raman result also confirms that the composite sample is prepared successfully with the required materials. The photocatalytic water splitting of all the samples was performed under 300 W Xenon lamp with a cutoff filter (λ = 420 nm) and the results displayed Fig. 5 a as well as summarized in Table S5 (Supporting Information). The sample HBT has a hierarchical structure that can harvest more light by increasing the traveling path of light that ultimately enhances the light interaction time and its absorption efficiency. The reflecting and scattering effect of incident light has increased due to branched structure and light can reach those places where it cannot directly reach. But HBT sample alone can only evolve hydrogen about 272 μmol. g−1.h−1 in the visible light (λ = 420 nm) as TiO2 cannot absorb visible light due to its large bandgap. When CN QDs loaded over the HBT sample, the hydrogen performance has increased eventually and reached up to 736 μmol. g−1.h−1 as high surface area of HBT sample helps to capture more g-C3N4 QDs and absorb more visible light, thus produce more photoinduced charge carriers. Here we can notice that the bulk CN sample generates hydrogen only 373 μmol. g−1.h−1 as the bulk sample has a low surface area and high charge recombination. The composite sample HBT/CN/SnSe2 generates the highest amount of hydrogen about 2375 μmol. g−1.h−1 that is much higher than the normal conditions. The results showed that the loading of SnSe2 has a great impact on the hydrogen evolution due to its unique properties. The tin dichalcogenide ambiguous properties increase the photocatalytic performance by absorbing more light and producing reactive sites for the reduction of the proton. The 1D structure of branched TiO2 also helps to transfer photoinduced charge carriers between two materials. Moreover, the longer lifetime of charge carriers helps the photocatalyst to sustain the stability during the hydrogen evolution and Fig. 5d shows after five cycles of the process the composite is stable and able to reuse. Moreover, the quantum efficiency (Q.E) of the hydrogen evolution of all the samples was tested under visible light irradiation. The QE of HBT/CN/SnSe2 composite sample for HER at 420 nm is about 16.6 % that is much higher than HBT (1.89 %), CN (2.6 %), and HBTCN (5.6 %) indicating that the introduction of SnSe2 has greatly improved the photocatalytic efficiency. To disclose the reason for the high photocatalytic performance after introducing SnSe2, we did further characterizations. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were usually performed to investigate the intrinsic and extrinsic defects of the semiconductor material. Further, it gives information about the separation, transfer, and recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalyst [76–78]. The lower the intensity of PL spectra means lower the recombination of charge carriers [77]. The PL spectra of all the samples were measured at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm as shown in Fig. 6 a. The results showed that the CN sample has the highest rate of recombination in its bulk form. The composite HBT/CN/SnSe2 sample displayed a lower emission intensity of PL spectra. The loading of SnSe2 encourages the separation of photogenerated electron and holes in the heterostructure that ultimately enhanced the photocatalytic performance. To further confirm the charge separation phenomenon, the time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra (TRPL) interpreted to govern the lifetime of charge carriers using the exponential decay function [79–81]. It is commonly said that the longer life means, the lower the charge recombination [82]. The decay spectra of the prepared samples depicted in Fig. 6b that was fitted exponentially by using the relation: I t = A 1 e - t τ 1 + A 2 e - t τ 2 where Ai correspond to amplitude and τi denotes the lifetime while average lifetime τ can be calculated as τ = A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 . The higher the average lifetime lower the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. All the calculated results are given in (Table S2 supplementary information). The spectra indicated that the composite sample HBT/CN/SnSe2 has highest τ average value (1.74 ns) that is higher than HBT (0.64 ns), HBTCN (1.00 ns) and CN (0.59 ns) τ average values, so this result also well matches with PL result and implies that duration of the lifetime of composite becomes longer due to loading of SnSe2 nanoflakes which effectually overwhelm the electron-hole recombination. The chronometric I-T curve of all the prepared samples illustrates in Fig. 6c that depicts the highest photocurrent density of the composite HBT/CN/SnSe2 as compared to other samples. The results advocate that the stable and sturdy contact between materials allowed separation and fast transfer of photogenerated electron and holes. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were also interrogated to elucidate the interfacial charge transfer and separation progression. The Nyquist plot of all the samples presented in Fig. 6d. The diameter of the semicircle symbolizes the resistance against the charge transfer; the smaller diameter means lower the transfer resistance. The spectra fitted by using the equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 6d). The components of the model are Rs (solution resistance), Act (charge transfer resistance), CPEdl, (capacitance of electrochemical double layer), CPE (constant phase element) and the R of depleting layer [64]. All the fitted results are given in (Table S3 supplementary information). It is noticeable from the plot that composite HBT/CN/SnSe2 has the smallest semicircle, which means it has the lowest charge transfer resistance. So, the results of PL, time decay, EIS and photocurrent response manifested that the introduction of SnSe2 with another photocatalyst enough to improve its photocatalytic performance by enhancing its charge separation and transfer efficiency. The schematic mechanism depicts in Fig. 7 has drawn to understand the stable and enhance the photocatalytic process. To understand the mechanism, the band edge potential was estimated using the Mulliken Electronegativity theory [83–85]. The Eq. (1) and (2) are used to find CB potential and VB potential. (1) E C B = X - E C - 0.5 E g (2) E V B = E C B + E g Where ECB and EVB are the conduction and valence band edge potential, Ec represents the energy of free electron on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), Eg is the bandgap energy of the semiconductor that can be found from DRS result directly, X is the electronegativity of the material and it was calculated by the following equation: (3) X = [ x ( A ) a x ( B ) b x ( C ) c ] 1 / ( a + b + c ) In which a, b, and c are the number of atoms in the compounds. The absolute electronegativity of the HBTiO2, g-C3N4, and SnSe2 is 5.70 eV, 4.73 eV, and 5.21 eV respectively. Table S4 shows the valence band and conduction band of the samples. After the light illumination, the electrons (e−) get excited in all the material simultaneously and move from valence bond (VB) to conduction band (CB) while leaving the holes (h+) behind at VB. After all, the conduction edge of g-C3N4 QDs is more negative than that of HBTiO2 that’s why electrons present at CB of g-C3N4 QDs transferred to the CB of HBTiO2 and from HBTiO2 to CB of SnSe2. Here, one thing is noticeable that most commonly used co-catalyst (Pt, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, Au, etc.) can only provide reaction site for the reduction of the proton but tin diselenide not only reduce the proton but it can also produce their own photo-generated electrons that ultimately enhance the hydrogen performance [86]. Most of the DFT studies claimed that the SnSe2 conduction band level is lower than the reduction potential of H+/H2 [38,48,49,87,88]. On another side, the CB level of TiO2 is higher than SnSe2, So the electrons produced at CB of TiO2 transferred to CB of SnSe2 while the holes would accommodate at VB of TiO2 and SnSe2 (Fig. 7a) [39,86]. In this way, the recombination of electron and holes could be reduced, but the transferred electrons from CB of TiO2 to CB of SnSe2 cannot produce hydrogen as the CB potential of SnSe2 is lower than NHE. However, due to SnSe2 ability to generates its own photoexcited electrons so there will be an accretion of surplus electrons in the CB of SnSe2 that would motivate a negative shift in the Fermi level of SnSe2. This upshift of SnSe2 fermi level precedes to move the Fermi level of TiO2 towards its CB, and both the Fermi level will be equalized due to the interparticle electron transfer (Fig. 7b). Now, the SnSe2 CB has excessive electron for the interfacial transfer to proton and produce hydrogen. Here, SnSe2 behaves like a co-catalyst by providing reduction sites for hydrogen production, generating photo-induced electrons and facilitate the charge separation by promoting the transfer of an electron from TiO2. Hence, the results explained in this study highlight the synergetic effect of tin dichalcogenide (SnSe2) as a co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen performance of TiO2 and g-C3N4. The presence of SnSe2 increases the lifetime of the photocatalyst and enhances the charge transfer speed which ultimately enhances photocatalytic efficiency. Furthermore, this research indicates the two-dimensional metal dichalcogenides can also be used as an effective co-catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting which is a significant expression for future advancement in the related composite material as a substitution of noble metals in hydrogen production via the photocatalytic process."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we reported the fabrication of g-C3N4 QDs on the branched TiO2 fiber by a chemical vapor deposition method. The pure SnSe2 nanoflakes were also grown over this composition by the CVD method. The composite HBT/CN/SnSe2 reveals high hydrogen performance (2375 μmol. g−1.h−1) in comparison with branched TiO2 (272 μmol. g−1.h−1), conventional g-C3N4 (373 μmol. g−1.h−1) and HBTCN (736 μmol. g−1.h−1). The Q.E of HBT/CN/SnSe2 composite sample for HER at 420 nm is about16.6 % that is also much higher than HBT (1.89 %), CN (2.6 %), and HBTCN (5.6 %) samples. The various characterization proved that SnSe2 nanoflakes grown successfully and the synergetic effect of SnSe2 as a co-catalyst effectively reduce the charge recombination and provide an active site for the photocatalytic hydrogen performance. The capability of excellent photoresponse of this type of material opens a new avenue for two-dimensional dichalcogenide material composite with another suitable semiconductor as a substitution of noble metals for high photocatalytic performance."
