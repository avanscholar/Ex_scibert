0,Introduction,"The development of selective catalysts for deoxygenating aldehydes and alcohols has been the subject of many recent investigations of biomass conversion. Aldehydes and alcohols account for up to 25wt% of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of raw biomass [1]. These high oxygen contents in bio-oils require deoxygenation before being utilized. The desired deoxygenation catalysts should show high CO bond scission selectivity compared to CC bond scission to retain the carbon chain and to reduce CO/CO2 production which usually comes along with the traditional decarbonylation/decarboxylation pathway [2]. Due to the complexity of bio-oil, studying small model molecules should be an efficient way of guiding catalyst design. Propanal and 1-propanol are excellent probe molecules due to their simple molecular structure and high vapor pressure which are suitable for collecting mechanistic information by performing surface science studies. Furfural and furfuryl alcohol (Scheme 1 ) provide opportunities for investigating the effect of furan ring on deoxygenation. In addition, furfural could be produced from hydrolyzing and dehydrating the hemicellulosic part of raw biomass [3,4]. Selective C1O1 bond scission of furfural can produce 2-methylfuran, which is a promising biofuel due to its high research blending octane number and high energy density [3]. Direct CO bond scission of propanal was rarely reported on transitional metal surfaces. Decarbonylation to produce CO, H2 and C2 hydrocarbons were dominant on Pd(111) [5], Rh(111) [6] and Pt(111) [7]. Acyl and ketene were observed as important intermediates for decarbonylation on surfaces like Pd(111) [5]. On the other hand, direct CO bond scission of 1-propanol to make C3 hydrocarbons was reported on Mo(110) [8]. Transitional metal carbides, especially tungsten carbide (WC) and molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), are emerging materials with application in heterogeneous catalysis [9–11] and electrocatalysis [11] due to their unique catalytic properties and low cost compared to precious metals. Recently investigation of small oxygenates on WC and Mo2C surfaces indicated that these carbide materials could be promising for deoxygenation reactions. For example, the selective CO/CO bond scission to make C2 hydrocarbons was observed for the reactions of ethanol and glycol aldehyde on WC [12,13] and Mo2C surfaces [14,15]. However, in synthesizing WC and Mo2C catalyst particles, it was found that WC had a much lower surface area due to higher synthesis temperature required [16] and were less stable in the deoxygenation reactions [17] than Mo2C. Therefore, the current study was focused on the understanding of deoxygenation pathways of aldehydes and alcohols on Mo2C using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). HREELS helped identify potential reaction intermediates and provided mechanistic insights into these reactions. Comparison between aldehydes and alcohols revealed whether and how CO and CO bond scission was different on the Mo2C surface. Comparison between C3 oxygenates and furans provided useful information on how the presence of the furan group affected the selectivity toward CO/CO bond scission."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation A Mo(110) single crystal was purchased from Princeton Scientific Corp. with a purity of 99.999%. The crystal was 1.5mm thick and with a diameter of 12.0mm. Two tantalum posts were used to hold the Mo(110) single crystal and served as contacts for resistant heating and liquid nitrogen cooling. A K-type thermocouple was spot welded to the back of the crystal and used to measure the temperature. The temperature of the Mo(110) crystal can be varied between 90K and 1150K. Ne+ sputtering and annealing were used to clean the Mo(110) surface until negligible amounts of C and O were detected by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES, Physical Electronics Inc., Model Phi 10-155A). Detailed procedures for preparing the Mo2C surface can be found in a previous paper [18]. Briefly, proper amounts of ethylene were dosed onto the Mo(110) surface at 600K, followed by annealing to 1150K to induce the diffusion of carbon into the interstitial sites of Mo(110) to make the Mo2C surface. The procedure was repeated several times until a 0.4–0.6 atomic ratio of C/Mo was reached, representing a model Mo2C/Mo(110) surface [18]. All liquid samples, propanal, 1-propanol, 2-methylfuran, furfural and furfuryl alcohol were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich with a purity of 99%. They were transferred into glass sample cylinders and purified using several freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Gases including hydrogen, oxygen, neon, propene and carbon monoxide (purchased from Keen Gas Inc.) were research purity and used without further purification. The purity of all the chemicals was checked using the mass spectrometry before experiments."
3,TPD and HREELS techniques,"2.2 TPD and HREELS techniques Both TPD and HREELS experiments were conducted in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of around 7×10−10 Torr. During TPD experiments, the Mo(110) single crystal and the adsorbates were heated at a linear rate of 3K/s. The gas phase products were identified by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS, UTi Instruments Inc., Model 100C). The HREEL spectrometer (LK Technologies Inc., Model ELS3000) was housed at the bottom level in a three-level UHV chamber. The HREELS scans were collected after annealing the sample surface to certain temperatures and cooling down to below 130K. The intensity of the elastic peak was used to normalize all the HREEL spectra."
4,Results and discussion,
5,TPD of propanal and 1-propanol,"3.1 TPD of propanal and 1-propanol Fig. 1 displays the TPD spectra after exposing 4L (1L=1×10−6 Torrs) propanal (red spectra) and 4L 1-propanol (blue spectra) onto Mo2C at 100K. The exposure of 4L corresponds to the near saturation coverage of the first monolayer of adsorbed propanal and 1-propanol. For the reaction of propanal, H2, 1-propanol and propene were the major gas-phase products. Selective CO bond scission (deoxygenation) was revealed to be a major reaction pathway by the detection of propene, which commenced at 300K, reached a maximum rate at 403K and diminished at 480K. Accumulated oxygen was detected on the Mo2C surface after reaction by AES. The CO bond hydrogenation was another pathway as indicated by the detection of 1-propanol between 280K and 400K. Propene and 1-propanol were both produced between 300K and 400K, indicating that CO bond scission and hydrogenation could be competing reactions within this temperature range. Finally, a non-selective decomposition pathway was indicated by H2 production and increased amount of surface carbon after reaction. Overall, the three proposed reaction pathways of propanal on Mo2C based on TPD and AES results are summarized as follows: (1) Deoxygenation reaction : CH 3 CH 2 CHO → C 3 H 6 + O ad (2) Hydrogenation reaction : CH 3 CH 2 CHO ⟶ + 2 H CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 OH (3) Complete decomposition : CH 3 CH 2 CHO → 3 C ad + O ad + 3 H 2 The reaction pathways of propanal on Mo2C surface, especially the deoxygenation pathway, are very different from those on other transition metal surfaces such as Rh(111) [6], Pd(111) [5], Pd(110) [19] and Pt(111) [7]. Decarbonylation to produce H2, CO and C2 hydrocarbons are the dominant pathways on these metal surfaces. The TPD quantification results for the reaction of propanal are summarized in Table 1 . The H2 and CO coverage were calibrated by performing a TPD of methanol and comparing the amounts of H2 and CO per surface site produced from methanol decomposition with those reported on Mo2C in a previous paper [20]. The yields of other products, including 1-propanol and propene, were calculated by comparison with CO using mass spectrometer ionization probabilities, following similar procedures as reported previously [21]. Based on the quantification results (Table 1), deoxygenation was shown to be the dominant reaction pathway on Mo2C with a selectivity of 67%, demonstrating a high CO scission selectivity in the reaction of propanal. The hydrogenation was a minor reaction pathway with a selectivity of less than 5%. The non-selective decomposition pathway accounted for around 30%. For the reaction of 1-propanol, H2, CO, propanal and propene were the major gas-phase products. Following the same procedure for propanal reaction, the reaction pathways of 1-proponol were proposed as following and quantified as shown in Table 1: (4) Deoxygenation reaction : CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 OH → C 3 H 6 + O ad + H 2 (5) Dehydrogenation reaction : CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 OH → CH 3 CH 2 CHO + H 2 (6) Reforming reaction : CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 OH → 2 C ad CO + 4 H 2 Selective CO bond scission (deoxygenation) was one of the dominant reaction pathways with a selectivity of 40%. Propene was produced between 300K and 480K, similar to that from propanal reaction. The similar peak shape and temperature range for propene production from both propanal and 1-propanol suggested that the deoxygenation of these two molecules went through a similar intermediate. Similarly, accumulated surface oxygen was detected by AES after reaction. The selective CO bond scission pathway is consistent with previous studies of ethanol [15] on the Mo2C surface. In contrast, selective CO bond scission for 1-propanol was rarely seen on transition metal surfaces [6,7,22,23] except on Mo(110) [8]. The dehydrogenation was another significant reaction pathway with a selectivity of 43%. Propanal was produced within a narrow temperature range between 310K and 400K. The deoxygenation and dehydrogenation were competing reactions at this temperature range. There was also a reforming pathway to produce CO, H2 and surface carbon, which accounted for 17% selectivity."
6,HREELS of propanal and 1-propanol,"3.2 HREELS of propanal and 1-propanol The HREELS measurements of propanal and 1-propanol were performed on Mo2C in order to identify surface reaction intermediates. Fig. 2a and b displays the HREELS spectra after exposing 4L propanal and 4L 1-propanol, respectively, onto Mo2C at 100K and then annealing to various temperatures. The vibrational mode assignments of propanal and 1-propanol were accomplished by comparing with the literature and are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. For propanal, the 100K spectrum showed peaks for δ(CCO) (663cm−1), ν a(CCC) (1096cm−1), δ(CH2) (1448cm−1), δ(CH3) (1448cm−1), ν(CO) (1711cm−1) and ν(CH3) (2943cm−1). These peaks are comparable with those in the IR spectrum of liquid-phase propanal [24], indicating molecularly adsorbed propanal on Mo2C at 100K. At 200K, the peaks associated with the CO bond at 663cm−1 and 1711cm−1 disappeared, indicating enhanced interaction between the CO bond and Mo2C. At 300K, a broad peak emerged at around 1042cm−1 with a shoulder at around 886cm−1. By comparison with the 1-propanol HREELS spectra as discussed below, the new feature at 1042cm−1 could be assigned to ν(CO) while the shoulder at 886cm−1 could be assigned to ν(CC) though ρ(CH3) may also contribute to these features. The observation of ν(CO) indicates the bond order change for the CO bond of propanal due to the increased interaction with Mo2C surface at temperature below 300K. It is difficult to determine if propanal adsorbed through an alkoxide (η 1(O)) or an η 2(C,O) intermediate because their HREELS spectra are expected to be very similar, although an η 2(C,O)-adsorbed propanal was commonly proposed on transition metal surfaces such as Pd(111) [5] and Rh(111) [6]. The CO bond of the adsorbed propanal species could begin to cleave at around 300K, as indicated by propene desorption starting at 300K in TPD. At 400K, all the peaks attenuated, consistent with continuous desorption of propene between 300K and 480K from TPD. At 500K, only peaks associated with CH x (x <4) fragments remained on the surface. For 1-propanol, the 100K spectrum represents a molecularly adsorbed 1-propanol as indicated by the peak associated with ν(OH) at 3220cm−1, which became more evident in the HREELS spectrum of higher exposure of 1-propanol (not shown here). As shown in Table 3, the vibrational features are generally comparable with those in the IR spectra of gas-phase 1-propanol [8] and HREELS spectra of molecularly adsorbed 1-propanol on other surfaces [6,23], confirming the presence of molecularly adsorbed 1-propanol on Mo2C at 100K. At 200K a propoxide surface intermediate, from the OH bond cleavage of 1-propanol, was produced, as indicated by the disappearance of the ν(OH) peak at 3220cm−1. At 300K, a similar surface intermediate was formed compared to that from propanal reaction, as suggested by the similarity between the 300K spectrum of propanal and 1-propanol shown in Fig. 2c. It is difficult to conclusively distinguish between alkoxide (η 1(O)) or η 2(C,O)-adsorbed propanal for this intermediate. The observation of a similar surface intermediate formed form propanal and 1-propanol reaction is consistent with TPD results (Fig. 1) of similar propene peak shapes and desorption temperatures from the reaction of these two molecules."
7,TPD of furfural and furfuryl alcohol,"3.3 TPD of furfural and furfuryl alcohol The UHV and reactor studies of furfural deoxygenation over Mo2C have been reported recently [25]. The main purpose to include furfural in the current paper is to determine the effect of the furan ring on the reaction pathways. Fig. 3 displays the TPD spectra after exposing 4L furfural onto Mo2C. Three pathways were proposed for the reaction of furfural on Mo2C based on the observed gas-phase and surface products. (7) 2 -methylfuran production : C 5 H 4 O 2 ⟶ + 2 H C 5 H 6 O + O ( ad ) (8) Reforming reaction : C 5 H 4 O 2 → 2 CO + 3 C ( ad ) + 2 H 2 (9) Complete decomposition : C 5 H 4 O 2 → 5 C ( ad ) + 2 H 2 + 2 O ( ad ) The 2-methylfuran product, produced by selectively cleaving the C1O1 bond of furfural, was detected as one of the major products between 280K and 400K. The production of 2-methylfuran was confirmed by observing similar TPD peaks for the major cracking patterns of 2-methylfuran including masses of 53, 54, 81 and 82amu. The detection of 2-methylfuran indicated that Mo2C could selectively cleave the C1O1 of furfural while keeping the furan ring intact. In addition, H2 and CO were both detected at around 317K. The detection of H2, CO and surface carbon accumulation after TPD experiments (by AES) suggested that the reforming reaction was another reaction pathway (Eq. (8)). The complete decomposition pathway (Eq. (9)) was indicated by the detection of extra surface oxygen using AES after subtracting the contribution from the 2-methylfuran production pathway (Eq. (7)). The activity of each reaction pathway on Mo2C was quantified using the similar procedure as that of propanal and is summarized in Table 4 . The selectivity of producing 2-methylfuran was around 38%. The reaction pathways of furfural on metal surfaces under the UHV condition were rarely studied in literature. Recent studies by Medlin et al. [26] reported that furan production was dominant for the reaction of furfural on Pd(111), consistent with the results on supported Pd catalysts [27]. Fig. 4 illustrates the TPD spectra after exposing 4L furfuryl alcohol onto Mo2C. Similarly, 2-methylfuran was detected as the major gas-phase product between 240K and 400K, indicating that Mo2C could selectively cleave the C1 O1 bond of furfuryl alcohol. 2-Methylfuran was produced within similar temperature range from the reactions of furfural and furfuryl alcohol, suggesting that the selective deoxygenation of furfural and furfuryl alcohol could proceed through a similar intermediate. The peak at 208K for mass 82amu was most likely from the molecular desorption of furfuryl alcohol, similar to those peaks observed for masses 28 and 98amu at 208K. H2 and CO were observed as the other major gas-phase products at around 341K and 326K, respectively. The degraded quality for the 2amu and 28amu spectrum was due to the limited performance of the mass spectrometer for low masses when it was optimized to detect higher mass peaks."
8,HREELS of furfural and furfuryl alcohol,"3.4 HREELS of furfural and furfuryl alcohol Fig. 5a displays the HREELS spectra of 4L furfural on Mo2C at various temperatures. At 100K, the spectrum represented a molecularly adsorbed furfural, featuring the peaks associated with the furan ring such as τ(ring) (595cm−1), ω(CH) (758cm−1), δ(ring) (866cm−1) and ν(CH) (3091cm−1) and peaks associated with the aldehyde group like ν(CO) (1644cm−1). The vibrational mode assignments of furfural were made by comparison with the Raman spectra of liquid-phase furfural [28] and are summarized in Table 5 . The ν(CO) peak at 1644cm−1 shifted to a lower frequency at 200K and almost disappeared at 300K, indicating enhanced interaction between the C1O1 bond of furfural and Mo2C, most likely through an η 2(C1,O1) configuration, although an alkoxide intermediate formation could not be excluded. In contrast, the peaks associated with the furan ring including τ(ring), ω(CH), δ(ring) and ν(CH) (3091cm−1) remained up to 300K. The η 2(C1,O1)-adsorbed furfural was commonly proposed on transitional metal surfaces such as Ni [29], NiFe [30], Pd [27] and PdCu [27]. At 300K, the spectrum was very similar to that of adsorbed 2-methylfuran on Mo2C, indicating that a 2-methylfuran-like intermediate was produced by cleaving the C1-O1 bond of the η 2(C1,O1)-adsorbed furfural [25]. At 400K, all the peaks associated with the 2-methlyfuran-like intermediate, especially those for τ(ring), δ(ring) and ν(CH) (3091cm−1), almost disappeared, consistent with 2-methylfuran desorbing between 280K and 400K in TPD. At 500K, only peaks related to the CH x (x <4) fragments remained on the surface (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b illustrates the HREELS spectra of 4L furfuryl alcohol on Mo2C at various temperatures. At 100K, the spectrum showed that furfuryl alcohol molecularly adsorbed onto Mo2C, as indicated by the presence of peaks associated with the furan ring such as τ(ring) (609cm−1) and ω(CH) (737cm−1) and with the hydroxyl group ν(OH) (3355cm−1). The vibrational mode assignments of furfuryl alcohol were made by comparison with the Raman spectra of liquid-phase furfuryl alcohol [28] and are summarized in Table 6 . At 200K, the ν(OH) peak disappeared, suggesting the formation of furfuryl alkoxide intermediate from the O1H bond cleavage of furfuryl alcohol. As the spectrum at 250K was almost identical to that of adsorbed 2-methylfuran, a 2-methylfuran-like intermediate could be produced from cleaving the C1O1 bond of the furfuryl alkoxide intermediate [25]. All the peaks associated with the 2-methylfuran-like intermediate attenuated at 300K and almost disappeared at 400K, consistent with the TPD results showing that 2-methylfuran desorbed between 240K and 400K from the reaction of furfuryl alcohol on Mo2C. At 500K, only peaks associated with the CH x (x <4) fragments remained."
9,Deoxygenation of aldehydes and alcohols,"3.5 Deoxygenation of aldehydes and alcohols The selective CO/CO bond scission (deoxygenation) of propanal and 1-propanol went through a similar surface intermediate as demonstrated by similar HREELS spectra of propanal and 1-propanol at 300K (Fig. 2c) and also the similar propene desorption peaks in TPD (Fig. 1). The surface intermediate could be either a propoxide (η 1(O)) or an η 2(C,O)-adsorbed propanal. Interestingly, this surface intermediate could also lead to hydrogenation or dehydrogenation, as indicated by the propanal production from 1-propanol and the 1-propanol production from propanal right after the formation of this surface intermediate at 300K. The selective CO (CO) bond scission and hydrogenation (dehydrogenation) could be competing within the temperature range between 300K and 400K, while the selective CO/CO bond scission continued to proceed to higher temperature. Similar observations were made for furfural and furfuryl alcohol though minor differences existed, which could be due to the effect of addition furan ring. As shown by the HREELS results [25], the selective CO/CO bond scission of furfural and furfuryl alcohol proceeded through a similar 2-methylfurn intermediate derived from either an η 2(C,O)-adsorbed furfural or furfuryl alkoxide. One interesting difference between the reaction of propanal and 1-propanol was that the deoxygenation pathway of propanal had a higher selectivity compared to that of 1-propanol. As shown in the TPD quantification results (Table 1), the deoxygenation selectivity for propanal was around 67% while it decreased to around 40% for 1-propanol. At the same time, selectivity of the competing reaction increased from 5% for propanal (hydrogenation) to 43% for 1-propanol (dehydrogenation). Ren et al. [2] reported the activation barrier calculation for key elementary steps of propanal hydrogenation and decomposition on a close-packed Mo2C(0001) surface. It was found that the activation barriers for the hydrogenation of either the O or α-C (next to O) atom of propanal (around 1.3eV) were much larger than direct CO bond scission (0.61eV). Because of the significantly larger activation barrier for hydrogenation, more propanal molecules should go through the deoxygenation pathway. The activation barriers for 1-propanol dehydrogenation and decomposition have not been calculated over Mo2C(0001), although useful information could be derived from WC(0001) because previous studies showed similar reaction pathways for small oxygenates on Mo2C and WC surfaces [12,15]. It was reported that the dehydrogenation of the OH and α-CH bonds of 1-propanol on WC(0001) to make an η 2(C,O)-propanal was energetically favorable with reasonable activation barriers of 0.66eV and 0.88eV, respectively. The CO bond scission of the η 2(C,O)-propanal could readily happen with a low activation barrier of 0.33eV. Assuming the trend in activation barriers observed for 1-propanol dehydrogenation and decomposition on the WC surface is similar to those on the Mo2C surface, it is not surprising to observe both deoxygenation and dehydrogenation reactions occur on Mo2C during the temperature range of 300–400K. The selective CO/CO bond scission of propanal and 1-propanol were rarely seen on late transition metal surfaces such as Pd(111) [5,22,23], Rh(111) [6] and Pt(111) [7]. On these surfaces, decarbonylation through an acyl intermediate was dominant for both propanal and 1-propanol. The completely different selectivity toward CO/CO bond scission on Mo2C could be due to the strong interaction between the CO/CO bond and the Mo2C surface, as demonstrated in the HREELS results. In addition, previous studies suggested that stable α-CH bond could also be an important factor for controlling the CO/CO bond scission selectivity [8,31]. The role of the stability of α-CH bond for controlling the CO/CO bond of propanal and 1-propanol requires further investigation."
10,Effects of furan ring on the deoxygenation of aldehydes and alcohols,"3.6 Effects of furan ring on the deoxygenation of aldehydes and alcohols Although the deoxygenation pathways are generally similar between C3 oxygenates (propanal and 1-propanol) and furans (furfural and furfuryl alcohol) on the Mo2C surface, one important difference was observed: hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol were not observed in the TPD and HREELS experiments. For example, furfural was not observed as a gas-phase product from the TPD of furfuryl alcohol on Mo2C and vice versa. In contrast, hydrogenation of propanal and dehydrogenation of 1-propanol on Mo2C were clearly demonstrated by the TPD experiments as shown in Fig. 1. This difference between the C3 oxygenates and furans could be explained by the effect from the additional furan ring. As pointed out by Medlin et al. [26], the furan ring would help weaken the C1O1 bond of furfuryl alcohol. While in the case of furfural, as furfural binds onto Mo2C through an η 2(C1,O1) configuration, it is expected that the conjugate effect between the aromatic furan ring and the C1O1 bond would be disrupted, possibly leading to a weaker C1O1 bond. Because the activation barrier for C1O1 bond scission could be further reduced compared to the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation step due to the existence of the furan ring, more molecules would go through the direct deoxygenation pathway. Therefore, hydrogenation–dehydrogenation reactions between furfural and furfuryl alcohol would not be effectively competing with the deoxygenation reactions in the same temperature range."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the Mo2C surface selectively deoxygenates propanal and 1-propanol to produce propene. The selective deoxygenation of propanal and 1-propanol proceeds through a similar intermediate (propoxide or η 2(C,O)-propanal). The Mo2C surface also selectively deoxygenates furfural and furfuryl alcohol to make 2-methylfuran through a 2-methylfuran-like intermediate. The presence of the furan ring modifies the selectivity between deoxygenation and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation pathways."
