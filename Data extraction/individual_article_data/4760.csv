0,Introduction,"Besides highly catalytic activity with hydrodesulfurization [1,2], hydrodenitrogenation [3], hydrodechlorination [4] and hydrazine decomposition reactions [5], transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) have been demonstrated as promising noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their noble-metal-like properties recently [6,7]. Especially, their nanostructured counterparts, such as Ni2P hollow nanoparticles [8], MoP, CoP nanoparticles [9,10], porous FeP nanosheets [11], CoP nanowires [12] and Cu3P nanowires [13] have been demonstrated as effective electrocatalysts for HER with high catalytic performance. However, as compared to the transition-metal oxides and chalcogenides, the synthesis of the nanostructured TMPs is so cost and tough as obtained with singular pure phase and homogeneous composition generally. The main reason is resulted from that the TMPs have complicated stoichiometries and their associated complex structures [14–17], which would restrict the generation of the desired composition and specific structure easily in the transition-metal phosphorus (M−P) systems. Meanwhile, the increased nucleation energy of M−P phases makes it difficult to choose alternative phosphorus precursors to obtain nanostructured products via low-temperature synthetic routes [18]. Hence, the preparation of the nanostructured TMPs often suffers from the involvement of several kinds of expensive and toxic phosphorus precursors with high boiling point organic solvents by a wet route [19–21], or the combination with wet and solid reaction via multiple tedious synthetic steps [13,22,23]. For examples, phosphine (PH3) and silylphosphines P(SiMe3)3, which are highly toxic, are used to synthesize the nanostructured TMPs through hydrothermal and solvothermal methods [24,25]. So, in this regard, to develop a facile and simple synthetic route for TMP nanostructures is highly desired and challenged. Except for composition and structure in addition to morphology and size of the catalysts, the electric conductivity of catalysts is another crucial factor to affect the electrocatalytic activity [9]. Although most of the TMPs show metallic character, another auxiliary strategy to improve the overall electric conductivity of the catalysts on the electrode is also needed due to the presence of contact resistance between the active substances. For instance, the ways to array the catalysts on carbon cloth [12] or commercial porous copper foam [13] are good strategies to ensure a fast electron transport during the catalytic process. As a result, carbon coating is a promising method to improve the electronic conductivity of electrode materials [26,27]. At the same time, the carbon coating can also lead to high durability and chemical stability of the catalysts to resist corrosion in the medium, which is favorable for the cycling stability of the TMPs. Herein, we develop a facile one-pot synthetic route to prepare carbon coated CoP (CoP@C) core–shell nanocables through a pyrolysis reaction of cobalt(II) acetylacetonate (Co(acac)2) with triphenyl phosphine (PPh3) in an evacuated and sealed quartz tube at 400 °C for 1 h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of the CoP@C nanocables in such a short time under moderate condition. Meanwhile, the electrocatalytical property of the nanocables, typically catalyzing for HER, has been investigated in the current work and it is found that the carbon coated CoP nanocables have displayed a very high catalytic activity and good cycling stability in the acidic medium as compared to the bare CoP nanorods and bulk CoP. Moreover, NiP2, FeP, Cd3P2 and CuP2 nanostructures have been also successfully prepared by this synthetic strategy. The facile synthetic route developed in this work will pave a new pathway for preparing the nanostructured TMPs as a kind of non-noble metal electrocatalysts with improved electrochemistry performance, and they would be also a new type of promising candidates for substituting of precious metals such as platinum and its alloys for electrocatalysis."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Co(acac)2 and PPh3 were purchased from Alfa Corp. Red phosphorus (powder, 99%), cobalt powder (99%), ethanol and toluene were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company. All reagents were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of CoP@C core–shell nanocables In a typical experimental procedure, Co(acac)2 (0.032 g) and PPh3 (0.196 g) were mixed and put into a quartz tube, then evacuated and sealed. The tube was loaded into a resistance furnace by a tilt angle of 5°, heated from room temperature to 400 °C in 100 min, and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After the tube was naturally cooled to room temperature, black products were collected, washed with toluene and absolute alcohol several times, and finally dried in a vacuum furnace at 60 °C for further investigation. 2.2.2 Synthesis of CoP nanorods The synthetic procedures for the CoP nanorods are adopted from our early work with some modifications [28]. In short, in a typical synthesis of the CoP nanorods, a mixture of Co powder (0.016 g, 0.25 mmol) and PPh3 (0.265 g, 1 mmol) was put into a quartz tube, which was then evacuated and sealed. The sealed tube was loaded into a resistance furnace by a tilt angle of 5 °C, heated from room temperature to 385 °C over 200 min, and kept at this temperature for 15 h. After the tube was allowed to cool to room temperature, the black products were collected, washed with benzene, dilute hydrochloric acid, and absolute ethanol, and finally dried in a vacuum furnace at 60 °C for further investigation."
4,Structure characterization,"2.3 Structure characterization Products were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'pert PRO X-ray diffractometer, Cu Kα, 1.54178 Å), scanning electronic microscope (SEM, JEOL-JSM-6700F), transmission electronic microscope (TEM, Hitachi H7650). HRTEM images, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), and corresponding energy-disperse X-ray spectrum (EDS) were taken with a JEOL 2010 TEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a VGESCA-LAB MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Mg as the exciting source. Raman spectrum was tested on a JYLABRAM-HR Confocal Laser Micro-Raman spectrometer with 514.5 nm from an argon laser at room temperature. EA (Elementar vario EL cube, Thermal Conductivity Detector) was used to determine the carbon content in the composites."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements All of the electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments, shanghai, China). Pt/C and Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl solution) electrode were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A glass carbon electrode decorated with catalyst samples were used as the working electrode. Typically, 5.0 mg of catalyst and 30 μL of Nafion solution (Sigma Aldrich, 5 wt%) were dispersed in 1.0 mL water-ethanol solution with volume ratio of 4:1 by sonicating for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then 5.0 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode of 3 mm in diameter (loading ∼ 0.35 mg cm−2). The polarization curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from −0.6 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode at room temperature, with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. AC impedance measurements were carried out in the same configuration at η = −0.20 V from 0.01 Hz to 100 KHz. The Ag/AgCl electrode was calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). All the potentials reported in our manuscript are against RHE."
6,Results and discussion,"The crystal structure and chemical composition of the as-prepared CoP@C core–shell nanocables were determined and confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1 , all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to an orthorhombic crystal structure of CoP (JCPDS No. 89-4862). The obvious diffraction peaks can be indexed well to (101), (011), (200), (111), (112), (211), (103), (020) and (301) planes of the orthorhombic CoP, revealing the high purity of the phosphide synthesized in the product. The relatively weak broadened scattering peak in the pattern suggests that there is some amorphous carbon mixed with the targeting CoP nanocrystals in the samples. To reveal the detailed composition, the samples were also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S1a, XPS survey spectrum confirms the successful preparation of the CoP nanocrystals. In Fig. S1b, the peaks at binding energies (BEs) of 778.5 eV and 781.6 eV are attributed to Co2p3/2 and the peaks at 793.5 eV can be assigned as Co2p1/2. In addition, P (2p) region shows two peaks at 129.9 eV and 130.6 eV (Fig. S1c), reflecting the binding energy of P2p1/2 and P2p3/2, respectively, along with one peak at 134.4 eV, and the peaks at 779.1 and 129.8 eV are close to the BEs for Co and P in CoP [29]. In addition, the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S1a) also confirms the presence of oxygen and carbon in the sample. The peaks at 781.6 and 134.4 eV can be attributed to oxidized Co and P species due to surface oxidation of CoP [28,30], and the peaks at 284.8 eV can be assigned as C1s. Raman spectra of CoP@C nanocables (Fig. S2) further confirmed the presence of carbon in the sample. The peaks at 1345 and 1596 cm−1 are attributed to D-band and G-band of graphite, respectively [31]. The morphologies of the samples are carefully investigated by SEM and TEM. The samples clearly present the uniform rods-like morphology with diameters of 20–50 nm (Fig. 2 a, b). Magnified TEM images provide evidence for that the rod-like nanostructures are nanocables since there are obvious core–shell structure of the samples observed in the image due to a notably different contrast between the pale shell and the dark solid center (Fig. 2c, d). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3 b) confirms the core–shell nanocable with CoP core and it also shows a typical lattice fringe with an interplane distance of 2.47 Å, corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of CoP. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3c) demonstrates a well-defined diffraction pattern, confirming the single-crystalline nature of the CoP nanorod within the cable. The chemical compositions of the nanorods were measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 3d), which reveals that the sheaths of the nanocable are carbon and the core nanorods are composed of elemental Co and P with a molar ratio of Co:P close to 1:1. The CoP@C nanocables are investigated for catalyzing the electrochemical HER in the current work since in general carbon coating layers can significantly enhance the electronic conductivity performance of electrode with high cycle stability for the core CoP nanostructures. In details, electrochemical measurements of various CoP samples were performed in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at room temperature using a three-electrode setup with the same loading of 0.353 mg cm−2 on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Fig. 4 a shows the polarization curves of the CoP@C nanocables, bare GC electrode, bulk CoP and CoP nanorods [28] (as seen details characterization of XRD, SEM and TEM in Fig. S3) in addition to commercially available Pt/C catalyst (20 wt%). The CoP@C nanocables exhibit small onset overpotential (1 mA cm−2) of 90 mV for HER, beyond which the cathodic current rises rapidly under more negative potentials. This onset overpotential is much smaller than that of the CoP nanorods samples (140 mV), which suggests the good catalytic activity of the product. Moreover, the cathodic current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential around 170 mV, whereas the bulk powder (Fig. S4) shows poor catalytic activity. To obtain further insight into the CoP@C nanocables, Tafel plots of various catalysts were investigated (Fig. 4b), which can be determined by fitting the linear regions of the Tafel plots to the Tafel equation (η = blog j + a, where j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope), yielding values of about 31, 61, 98 and 169 mV per decade for Pt/C, CoP@C nanocables, CoP nanorods and bulk CoP, respectively. The results show that the measured overpotential and Tafel slope of the commercial Pt/C catalyst are close to those reported in the literature [32,33]. Noting that the Tafel slope of ∼61 mV per decade for the CoP@C nanocables, much lower than the measured value for CoP nanorods (∼98 mV per decade), suggesting carbon coating layers act as positive roles for HER. In principle, the small Tafel slope of the CoP@C nanocables is advantageous for practical applications, since it will lead to a faster increment of HER rate with increasing overpotential [34]. Compared with other classical noble-metal-free HER electrocatalysts (more comparison listed as seen in Table S1), the as-obtained CoP@C nanocables display comparable catalytic activity, making them a promising low-cost electrocatalyst for HER. Durability is another key factor to evaluate an electrocatalyst. To clarify that carbon coating layers have significant affection of the dramatically enhanced HER activity, the stability of the well-designed nanostructures was further evaluated by cycling the CoP@C nanocables-modified GCE continuously for 1000 cycles ranging from +0.20 to −0.30 V vs RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. At the end of the cycling procedure, the CoP@C nanocables catalyst presents similar I – V curves with the initial cycle with negligible loss in cathodic current density (Fig. 4c), while catalytic performance of the CoP nanorods shows obvious current loss up to 200 and 500 cycles (Fig. S5). Long-term stability is investigated in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 at a fixed overpotential of 200 mV as shown in Fig. 5 . We can observe that there is no obvious degradation after electrolysis even for more than 40,000 s. These results demonstrate that, comparing with CoP nanorods, the carbon coating CoP nanocables have excellent stability in a long-term electrochemical process, verifying that carbon coating layers play important roles in HER activity. We also detect possible morphology change during the hydrogen evolution reaction procedure, and it is found that the inspection of morphology after stability test shows no difference as compared to the one before test (Fig. S6) in a panoramic view, which is consistent well with the stability results demonstrated above. Furthermore, tests of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out for the CoP@C nanocables and CoP nanorods at an overpotential of η = 200 mV in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. Fig. 4d shows the Nyquist plots for both catalysts, in which the observed semicircle is mainly attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) [35] of H+ reduction at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In these two catalysts, CoP@C nanocables have a smaller diameter than CoP nanorods, implying the smallest charge transfer resistance, and also demonstrating that the carbon coating layers dramatically enhance the electron transfer, which leads to a better catalytic performance even though the carbon coatings themselves do not show obvious catalytic performance for HER in the work (Fig. S7)."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, we put forward a simple, fast strategy to synthesis transition metal phosphides. The as-synthesized CoP@C nanocables exhibit high electrocatalytic activity toward HER with a low overpotential (∼0.09 V) and small Tafel slope (∼61 mV per decade). In addition, investigations show that the carbon coating ensures a fast electron transport during the catalytic process and the coating is also favorable for their cycling stability due to an effective restriction of corrosion with carbon in the medium. The current strategy can be applied for the fabrication of many more transition metal phosphides, and especially, the developed CoP@C nanocables have developed as a new type of promising candidates for substituting of precious metals such as platinum and its alloys for electrocatalysis."
