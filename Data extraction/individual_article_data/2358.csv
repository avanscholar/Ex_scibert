0,Introduction,"The rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) atmospheric concentration is the most relevant contributor to the global warming; accordingly, the diminution of CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities represents a major concern and challenge nowadays [1,2]. An important strategy in this field is regarding the recycling of carbon dioxide through co-electrolysis of CO2 and water by using the surplus of energy from intermittent renewable power sources. In fact, among the several technologies proposed for CO2 reduction [3–8], the electrocatalytic routes towards valuable liquid fuels represent an innovative strategy that would positively impact the global carbon balance by recycling carbon dioxide into useful organic compounds [9–12]. In recent years, CO2 conversion using electrocatalytic processes has indeed attracted great attention [10–23]. Specific advantages of the electrocatalytic conversion regard the fact that the process can be controlled by the electrode potential and reaction temperature. Moreover, CO2 reduction and oxygen evolution occur in separate compartments thus avoiding recombination phenomena for the formed organic compounds [24]. The electricity used to drive the process can be obtained without generating any new CO2 i.e. by using renewable sources like solar, wind, hydroelectric or geothermal energy. The electrochemical reaction systems are compact, modular, on-demand, and easy for scale-up applications [9]. The energy stored in a liquid fuel can be easily transported and electrical energy regenerated using direct alcohol fuel cells [12,17]. Alternatively, the produced organic compounds, such as methanol, can be used as feed-stock chemicals [10,11]. The low temperature co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O using solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is an attractive option because the system can allow direct production of feed-stock chemicals such as methanol in a single stage process i.e. without the production of syngas as it occurs in high temperature ceramic solid oxide co-electrolyzers (SOEC) [25]. Moreover, SPE electrolysis cells are characterized by rapid start-up and excellent dynamic behavior with fast response to the typical fluctuations of renewable power sources. The SPE electrolyzers are also not affected by redox and thermal cycles, which represent a significant issue of high temperature SOEC devices [25]. Despite these promising characteristics, SPE systems for CO2 reduction are less explored in the literature [11,12,18,20,21,26,27]. The main reason for this is associated to the poor reactivity of CO2 at low temperatures. Kriescher et al. [18] have recently reported the carbon dioxide electro-reduction in a CO2 and vapour fed co-electrolysis cell, mainly producing methane, propane, propene, iso-butane and n-butane with a maximum current efficiency of 0.12%. They used a copper felt as cathode and a proton conducting membrane from Fumatech® [18]. The main disadvantage of using non-noble metal catalysts is the requirement of high overpotentials (>2V) i.e. very negative potentials for CO2 reduction corresponding to high cell potentials to promote carbon dioxide reduction. The use of platinum-group metals (Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Os, Ru) appears promising to significantly decrease the CO2 reduction overpotential [19], thus increasing the voltage efficiency of the cell. Shironita et al. [20,21] recently studied the CO2 electro-reduction employing a proton exchange polymeric-membrane based half-cell configuration with the hydrogen fed to the anode which operated as both reference and counter electrode. The cathodes were based on carbon supported Pt and PtRu to realize a CH3OH-based reversible fuel cell. They concluded that the produced CH3OH accumulates on the active sites of the electrocatalysts leading to a current decay with time. Interestingly, the CH3OH yield efficiency, determined by cyclic voltammetry experiments, was improved from 0.03% at the Pt/C to 7.5% at the PtRu/C. This indicates that Ru addition may efficiently promote CO2 reaction. However, the Faradaic efficiency in the work of Shironita et al. [20,21] was essentially determined from electrochemical adsorption experiments, whereas it would be important to measure the current efficiency for CO2 reduction in steady-state processes related to a practical operation of the co-electrolysis system. Recently, macrocyclic organic complexes based on Ru have shown capability to convert CO2 from the atmosphere [5]. This is another indication that Ru catalysts deserve special attention for the CO2 conversion at low temperatures. In this work, we have investigated the electro-reduction of CO2 at carbon supported PtRu and Ru catalysts in a co-electrolysis cell based on a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane (solid polymer electrolyte). The approach studied herein is regarding the production of low carbon alcohols (methanol, ethanol and iso-propyl alcohol) at low cell potential, i.e. at high voltage efficiency. A scheme of the co-electrolysis cell configuration and the operation mode are shown in Fig. 1 a. Carbon dioxide is fed to the gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) at the cathode chamber, which is based on a Ru-based catalyst, whereas water is fed to the anode, equipped with an IrRu-based catalyst. As a result of the co-electrolysis, alcohols and hydrogen are produced at the cathode and oxygen is evolved at the anode. The oxygen evolution process at the anode produces protons that, coordinated by water molecules, cross the polymeric membrane towards the cathode, whereas electrons pass through the external circuit. The protons react at the cathode side and two competing processes occur: the electro-reduction of CO2 and the evolution of hydrogen. CO2 reduction may involve protons by giving rise hydrogenated organic products e.g. alcohols. This operating mode is inverse to that of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) [20]. A specific example of the half-cell reactions is provided below with regard to methanol formation and the associated standard potentials [28] for the complete process are reported: (1) CO2 +6H+ +6e− →CH3OH+H2O E° cathode =0.04V vs. NHE (2) 3 H2O→ 3/2 O2 +6H+ +6e− E° anode =1.225V vs. NHE (3) CO2 +2H2O→CH3OH+ 3/2 O2 E° cell =1.185V It is evident that CO2 reduction thermodynamically occurs at a potential about 50mV positive than the hydrogen evolution reaction (0V RHE). Thus, the CO2 electroreduction to methanol is slightly favoured by the thermodynamics but due to the poor chemical reactivity of CO2 the process is kinetically hindered and H2 evolution is generally prevailing. An expanded view of the single cell elements is presented in Fig. 1 b, including membrane, electrodes, current collector, isolating gaskets and endplates with serpentine channel flow fields. The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1 c. This system is often referred to as reversed direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) [20,21]. However, compared to a conventional DMFC, there are some relevant differences. At the positive electrode, the carbon supported Pt catalyst is replaced by an Ir-based electrocatalyst directly coated onto the membrane, and carbonaceous materials, including the end plate, are replaced with titanium components. This is necessary since carbonaceous materials would degrade at high operating anode potentials typical of electrolysis devices. The single cell configuration presented in Fig. 1 forms a complete electrochemical reactor. In a practical electrolysis stack, several cells are connected in series through Ti bipolar plates."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization In-house made 50wt.% PtRu/C and 50wt.% Ru/C catalysts for the cathodic operation were prepared by the sulfite complex method [29]. Sulfite complexes of Ru and Pt, in appropriate amounts, were decomposed by hydrogen peroxide to form aqueous colloidal solutions of Ru and Pt oxides. These particles were adsorbed on carbon black (Vulcan XC72) to form PtRuOx/C and RuOx/C precursors. The amorphous oxides supported on carbon were reduced in a hydrogen stream (10% H2 in Ar, 70°C for 1h). The IrRuOx electrocatalyst used at the anode was synthesized by a modified Adams fusion method [30,31]. The chloride metal precursors (IrCl4·xH2O or RuCl3·xH2O, Strem Chemicals) were added to isopropanol to obtain a total metal concentration of 0.08M. This solution was stirred at room temperature up to complete dissolution of the precursors, followed by the addition of NaNO3. The slurry was dried at 90°C in air and thereafter heated in a quartz tube inside a furnace at 500°C for 30min in an air flow. The thermal treatment was tailored to achieve a crystalline phase while avoiding growth of catalyst particles. The eventual occurrence of hot spots, often causing sintering of catalyst particles during the annealing process, was checked by an infrared camera [32,33]. The fused salt-oxide was washed with distilled water to remove the remaining salts, filtered and dried in an oven at 80°C overnight. To completely remove impurities, a leaching procedure in HClO4 (0.1M, 80°C, 1h) was used. The crystallographic properties of the catalysts were determined by using a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. XRD patterns were obtained using a Panalytical X’Pert X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu/Kα source operating at 40kV and 20mA. The metallic ratio between Pt and Ru in the PtRu/C catalyst was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) using a FEI XL 30-Feg SEM-EDX instrument. EDX measurements were carried out in several regions of the sample using a large spot at low magnification (200 X). Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of the catalysts were obtained using a FEI CM12 transmission electron microscope with spatial resolution of 0.2nm. For this analysis, the catalysts were ultrasonically dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and deposited onto copper grids covered with carbon films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using a Physical Electronics (PHI) 5800-01 spectrometer. A monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source was used at a power of 350W. Spectra were obtained with pass energies of 58.7eV for elemental analysis (composition) and 11.75eV for the determination of the oxidation states. The Ag 3d5/2 peak of an Ag foil was taken, after argon sputtering, for checking the calibration of the binding energy (BE) scale. The quantitative evaluation of each peak was obtained by dividing the integrated peak area by atomic sensitivity factors, which were calculated from the ionization cross-sections, the mean free electron escape depth and the measured transmission functions of the spectrometer. XPS data have been interpreted by using the on-line library of oxidation states implemented in the PHI MULTIPAK 6.1 software and the PHI Handbook of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
3,Electrodes preparation and assembly,"2.2 Electrodes preparation and assembly A slurry of the cathode catalyst dispersed in water was sprayed on carbon cloth backing (GDL-HT ELAT from ETEK, 300μm thick carbon cloth with carbon black loading of about 5mgcm−2 and 30% PTFE content) with a total noble metal loading of 0.5mgcm−2. The ionomer content in the cathode catalyst layer was 33wt.%. For the anodic catalyst coated membrane (CCM), a slurry composed of 80wt.% catalyst IrRuOx and 20wt.% Nafion® ionomer (5wt.% Ion Power solution) in deionised water (Carlo Erba) was mixed under sonication [34]. The slurry was thus directly sprayed onto one face of the membrane (Nafion® 115). The anode catalyst loading was 0.4mgcm−2. Membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs), with 5cm2 geometrical area, were prepared by a hot-pressing procedure to favor the electrode bonding onto the membrane. Specifically, the cathode was hot-pressed onto the non-catalyzed face of the membrane (already catalyzed on the other side) at 80°C for 1h to dry completely the MEA and thereafter treated at 130°C and 20kgfcm−2 for 1.5min to bond together electrodes and membrane. A Ti mesh (Bekaert Toko Metal Fiber Co.), 300μm thick with 70% porosity, was used as backing layer for the anode side [34]."
4,Electrochemical characterization in co-electrolysis single cell,"2.3 Electrochemical characterization in co-electrolysis single cell The single cell co-electrolyzer was tested at different temperatures and under atmospheric pressure. Humidified CO2 (wet bulb 30°C) was pre-heated at the cell temperature and fed to the cathode compartment at a flow rate of 50mLmin−1 and atmospheric pressure. To assess the contribution of CO2, tests with an inert gas (He or N2) were carried out under the same flow, temperature, humidity and applied potential conditions. Ultrapure water (Milli-Q, 18.2MΩcm) was pre-heated at the same cell temperature and supplied by a peristaltic pump to the anode compartment, at a flow rate of 4mLmin−1. Polarization curves (cell potential as a function of current density) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out with a PGSTAT Autolab 302 Potentiostat/Galvanostat equipped with a booster of 20A (Metrohm) and a Frequency Response Analyzer (FRA). The EIS measurements were performed under potentiostatic control in a frequency range between 1MHz and 10 mHz by frequency sweeping in the single sine mode and acquiring ten points per decade. The amplitude of the sinusoidal excitation signal was 0.01V r.m.s. Chronoamperometric curves were carried out using a stepped potential profile with a first conditioning step at 0.5V during 30min in inert gas, followed by the potential step under study (e.g. 1.2 to 1.6V) in inert gas during another 30min, and subsequent switch from inert gas to CO2. During the chronoamperometry, the exhaust stream from the cathode (containing CO2, water transported from the anode and reaction products) was passed through a jacketed cooling system at constant temperature of 1°C (Julabo thermocryostat) separating the liquid fraction from the gas phase. Then the liquid fraction was analyzed by gas chromatography as described below. Blank experiments using the same electrochemical procedures but feeding inert humidified gases were also carried out."
5,Analysis of reaction products,"2.4 Analysis of reaction products The outlet stream from the cathode was passed through a cryogenic system to condense the liquid fraction. To avoid that some amount of reaction products remained entrapped in the pipeline at the cell outlet, this was abundantly washed with ultrapure water at the end of each test. Obviously, such procedure caused a strong dilution of the formed products in water, but it was particularly effective in avoiding interferences between successive tests. The composition of the liquid collected in the condensing system was thus analyzed by an off-line gas chromatograph (GC). A GC model Agilent 7890A was used. This was equipped with a capillary column (SUPELCOWAX 10, film 1.0μm) coupled to a FID detector and a TCD detector coupled to two packed columns (Porapack Q and 5A molecular sieve, SIGMA-ALDRICH) connected in series. Argon (TCD) or Helium (FID) were fed as carrier gases. The “sensitive factors” of each compound were determined for the calibration of the GC signals by using several standards. Alcohol concentration was thus determined and the produced moles referred to the operating time and the catalyst loading (active cathode metal phase). The total amount of moles of alcohol produced in each experiment was determined according to the following formula (4): (4) Moles=Molarity·Volume of collected liquid fraction Molarity was determined from gas chromatography after calibration. A Varian microGC GP4900 equipped with PPQ (10mt), MolSieve (20 mt) and micro DMD detector was used to analyze the gas composition after this passed the cryogenic system. Three measurements were carried out for the produced alcohols in each experiment. The average formation rate of alcohols products is reported."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physico-chemical characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Physico-chemical characterization of catalysts The preparation procedure of the cathode catalyst was tailored to keep very small the particle size of the metal-based active phase on carbon in order to increase the fraction of catalytic sites on the surface. The X-ray diffractograms of the 50% PtRu/C and the 50% Ru/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The PtRu/C catalyst was essentially formed by nanosized metallic particles (crystallite size of 2nm) dispersed on carbon. The typical face-centered cubic structure of metallic Pt was observed (JPCDS # 04-0802). However, a shift of the X-ray reflections towards higher Bragg angles indicated the occurrence of Pt-Ru (1:1 at.) alloy. Whereas, the Ru/C catalyst showed an amorphous nature as envisaged from the wide XRD peaks (amorphous halos) centered at 8°, 30° and 55° two-theta degrees. These are a fingerprint of the short-range order of the amorphous material. Some amorphous halos usually appear at higher two-theta degrees with respect to the main peaks of the equivalent crystalline structure. Fig. 3 shows TEM images of the carbon-supported PtRu and Ru catalysts. In both catalysts, a good dispersion of nanoparticles was observed on the carbon support. The latter was characterized by the typical globular morphology of carbon black (Vulcan XC72) with agglomerated spheroids of about 20–50nm size. The sulphite complex method [29] was effective in producing small metal-based nanoparticles, with a narrow size distribution centered at about 2nm, and well distributed on the surface of the carbon support particles (Fig. 3) also in consideration of the high metal concentration on carbon (50% wt.). The Ru/C catalyst showed even finer particles than PtRu/C with good dispersion on carbon (Fig. 3 b). However, an increase of the reduction temperature during catalyst preparation to achieve crystalline properties for the Ru-phase caused strong agglomeration (not shown). A distinguishing aspect of the catalysts morphology was related to the preferential distribution of the PtRu particles on the edge of the round-shape carbon agglomerates whereas the Ru particles appeared more evenly distributed on the carbon surface. X-ray diffraction patterns of the anodic IrRuOx catalyst used for the oxygen evolution showed the occurrence of a solid solution of Ir- and Ru-oxides with 70:30 atomic ratio (supplementary information Fig. S.I. 1). TEM analysis showed crystalline particle with average size of about 5nm (supplementary information Fig. S.I. 1 inset). XPS analysis was carried out to determine the surface composition and oxidation states of Ru and Pt. The surface atomic ratio derived from XPS for the Pt and Ru was similar to that obtained from XRD but with a slight enrichment of Ru on the surface (Pt:Ru=43:57 at.). A survey of the Pt4d and Ru3p regions is shown in the supplementary information (Fig. S.I. 2). XPS analysis showed the occurrence of metallic Pt mainly for the PtRu/C catalyst (Supplementary information, Fig. S.I. 3) whereas the oxidation state of Ru appeared different in the PtRu/C and Ru/C samples (Fig. 4 ). The Ru3p was here analyzed instead of the Ru3d because the latter was overlapping to the C1s signal. As clearly seen in Fig. 4, there is almost 1eV shift for the Ru3p3/2 to higher binding energy in the case of the amorphous Ru/C catalyst compared to the PtRu/C sample. Deconvolution analysis (Table 1 ) showed the occurrence of a larger fraction of oxidized Ru in the amorphous sample, whereas some metallic Ru was just evident for the PtRu/C sample. In general, there was a good fraction of metallic states for Pt and Ru in the bimetallic catalyst whereas no metallic species were present in the amorphous Ru catalyst."
8,PtRu/C catalyst as cathode for CO2 reduction in co-electrolysis,"3.2 PtRu/C catalyst as cathode for CO2 reduction in co-electrolysis The polarization curves of the cell based on the PtRu/C catalyst at the cathode are shown in Fig. 5 . It is important to point out that when CO2 was fed to the cathode and de-aerated water to the anode there was a gradient of oxygen partial pressure between cathode and anode compartments with a small associated electromotive force due to the formation of a concentration cell. This is somewhat similar to what occurs in a symmetrical PEM cell with hydrogen fed over Pt as reference/counter electrode and inert humidified gas fed at the cathode (supplementary information Fig. S.I. 4). This causes hydrogen evolution over the cathode at potentials higher than the RHE. The same phenomenon is observed during in-situ cyclic voltammetry analysis of the cathode in a PEM fuel cell operating in the driven mode [35]. In fact, the concentration gradient acts as voltage bias for the process. In the present case, the spontaneous voltage associated to the partial pressure gradient is opposite to the applied potential for the co-electrolysis process. Accordingly, the concentration gradient-related voltage subtracts to the electrolysis voltage; thus, the co-electrolysis reaction occurs at potentials slightly lower than those expected from thermodynamics. At low temperature (30°C) and high cell voltages, a similar behavior was registered in the presence of CO2 and humidified inert gas (He). This similarity indicated a prevailing occurrence of water splitting at high overpotentials. Oxygen evolution occurred at the anode side and hydrogen mainly formed at the cathode side with no significant influence on the current density produced by the presence of CO2 in the gas stream. Whereas, at low voltages (<1.55V), a wave related to CO2 was evident. The difference in current density between the polarization experiment in CO2 and that in inert gas (He) can be thus attributed to the electron transfer associated to the adsorption of CO2 on the PtRu catalytic surface and relative formation of reaction intermediates or organic products. CO2 adsorption may also occur under open circuit potential. Both processes involve removal of adsorbed species as reaction products at suitable cell potentials. The involved intermediates may not be necessarily alcohol-like products but possibly reduced formate species [19] being the cell potential corresponding to the current onset lower than the reversible potential for alcohol formation. Less evidence of this CO2-related wave was observed at 80°C probably because water splitting was shifted to lower potentials (Fig. 5 b). In the pseudo-steady-state polarization experiments of Fig. 5 it was evident that, the relative increase of current at low overpotentials, in the presence of CO2, was more relevant at low temperature. This fact would indicate that the initial adsorption of CO2 on the PtRu/C catalyst surface is stronger at low temperatures and the charge transfer associated to the CO2 adsorption process may be the prevailing mechanism under such conditions. The observed current-potential profile may in part reflect the stripping of CO2-adsorbed species formed on the electrode surface at very low cell potentials or during the open circuit potential (OCP) period [29]. To gain further insights on the CO2 adsorption phenomena and competitive water splitting reaction, ac-impedance experiments were carried out at 1.5V with 10mV r.m.s. sinusoidal excitation. This cell voltage is corresponding to the potential region where water splitting starts to become prevailing at 80°C but not at 30°C. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6 . The electrochemical impedance spectra exhibit, both in the presence of CO2 and humidified inert gas two semicircles, accounting most probably for charge transfer related to the rate determining step (high frequency) and mass transport (low frequency) mechanisms. Ac-impedance spectra were performed before and after chrono-amperometric tests of 24h at 1.45V in He and CO2 fed the cathode, with water fed at the anode, to analyze the effect of time on the adsorption phenomena. At 30°C, the impedance significantly increased in the presence of CO2 (before 24h chrono-amperometry) compared to the impedance profiles obtained in humidified He. Remarkably, the impedance progressively increases further after 24hours at 1.45V in CO2. This could be related to an almost irreversible adsorption with consequent decrease of the electrochemical active surface sites available for the reduction reaction. This strong adsorption was observed to cause a decrease of the steady-state current with time in the chronoamperometric experiments (see below). At 80°C, the CO2 adsorption at the same potential appears more labile (Fig. 6 b) since no evident poisoning effect (increase of impedance) is observed. Moreover, the fact that ac-impedance spectra are essentially similar at 80°C for inert gas and carbon dioxide may indicate that the CO2 reaction under this condition is contributing to the current density in a much lesser extent compared to the H2 evolution reaction. Some further insights are derived from the ac-impedance at 30°C (Fig. 6 a) by considering that both semicircles are affected by the CO2 feed. Thus, the observed relaxation phenomena are dealing essentially with the cathode process. This is unusual for a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis system where hydrogen formation is much faster than the oxygen evolution process [34]. However, it is pointed out that, in the present system, the typical Pt cathode of a conventional PEM electrolyser is replaced by a Pt-Ru alloy. The presence of Ru mixed with Pt at an atomic level (PtRu alloy) hinders adsorption of H-species on two neighboring sites, which is a required step to evolve H2 molecules. Ru atoms, which are slightly prevailing on the surface of PtRu, produce a preferential adsorption of −OH species, which are needed to give rise to alcohol formation. Accordingly, Ru-based catalysts were selected for this study. Whereas, Pt strongly interacts at low temperature with CO-like species occurring in the first step of CO2 reduction. This also provides an explanation for the strong CO2 chemisorption. The anode reaction does not appear to be rate determining; in particular, the anodic catalyst here selected has demonstrated good capability of achieving at low overpotentials a very high current density (1Acm−2 at 1.6V) in conventional water electrolysis [31,34]. Accordingly, the oxygen evolution at IrRuOx should be much faster than the hydrogen evolution at the surface of a Ru-rich catalyst and phenomena related to water oxidation are not easily distinguished in ac-impedance spectra (Fig. 6 a and 6b). A possible overlapping of the relaxation process for oxygen evolution at IrRuOx, which is characterized by much lower polarization resistance than H2 evolution or CO2 reduction at Ru-rich catalyst surfaces, may thus provide an explanation for the observed characteristics. This situation is opposite of that of a conventional PEM electrolyser where hydrogen evolution on pure Pt is much faster than oxygen evolution on IrRuOx [31,34]. Another aspect is dealing with the fact that the CO2-related semicircles from Nyquist plots are surprisingly characterized by larger resistance than those recorded in humidified inert gas in the initial spectrum at 30°C. This may appear as a discrepancy with respect to the polarization curves at 30°C (Fig. 5 a) showing larger current density with CO2 at 1.5V. However, it should be considered that polarization experiments were carried out over a fresh catalyst surface and their duration is relatively small (10min). Whereas, ac-impedance spectra require some equilibration with CO2 (0.5h) before recording the spectra to reduce the noise and the single sine measurement involves about 0.5h duration. Thus, CO2 has sufficient time to chemisorb strongly at 30°C. The low frequency semicircle at 30°C also indicates some increased diffusion constraints for the reactive species to reach uncovered reaction sites. This is less evident at 80°C because of the enhanced mass transport and the lower catalyst surface coverage. The production of alcohols from CO2 and H2O co-electrolysis was investigated by chronoamperometric experiments (Fig. 7 a) consisting of a first conditioning step (0.5V, 30min) and a second step at a higher cell potential (1.2V − 1.6V) in inert gas. After stabilization in inert gas (about 30min) at the higher potential, the stream was switched from inert gas to CO2 and kept under this condition for 4h. This procedure allowed monitoring the outlet composition before CO2 feed (supplementary information Fig. S.I. 5). The effects of cell potential (Fig. 7) and temperature (Fig. 8 ) were studied. In the chronoamperometric tests (e.g. Fig. 7 a), two current transients were registered in all the experiments. The first one was associated to the sweeping of the cell potential from 0.5V to 1.2-1.6V. In this case, there was a sudden increase in current due to the discharge of the double layer capacitance (Fig. 7 a). Subsequently, the current density decreased progressively with time and reached a plateau associated to the steady state water splitting (Fig. 7 a). The switch from inert gas to CO2 produced a small jump of current density (for Ecell< 1.6V), associated to the additional electrochemical reaction of CO2 on the surface of the PtRu catalyst (Fig. 7 a). The delay between the gas switch and the current response (of about 6–7min) was associated to the time needed to fill with CO2 the volume of the gas piping and the humidifier of the test station, acting as a buffer. After a moderate increase of current with CO2, the current density decreased slightly because of the CO2 adsorption and approached a steady-state condition (Fig. 7 a). The recorded steady-state current density values, at the end of the chronoamperometric test, increased with cell potential (Fig. 7 a). The raise of current density from 1.3V to 1.6V was reflecting the exponential increase of current with potential associated to the activation process (Butler-Volmer equation) observed in the polarization curves and very likely associated to water splitting as prevailing process. Interestingly, in chronoamperometric tests, the onset of current density was observed already at potentials near to the reversible potential for water splitting. As discussed above, this could be explained by the fact that by feeding inert gas to one compartment, a concentration cell is formed (gradient of oxygen partial pressure between anode and cathode) with an associated electromotive force. This acts as a small voltage bias and allows water splitting to occur at potentials lower than expected. A similar gradient of oxygen partial pressure between the anode and cathode (concentration cell) also occurs upon feeding CO2 to the cathode. Moreover, at 80°C, water splitting occurs well below the thermoneutral potential of 1.48V because heat is supplied to the cell and thus thermal energy input contributes to the TΔS0 term in the Gibbs equation (ΔH0 =ΔG0 +TΔS0) [36]. There is an effect of the operating potential on the current profile and the methanol production (Fig. 7 a and b) showing a maximum production rate at 1.25V. The chromatograms in Fig. 7 c were characterized by a high level of noise because the pipeline for condensing the liquid fraction of the cell outlet was washed with abundant water at the end of each experiment to avoid interference between successive tests. This caused large dilution of the concentration of the produced methanol in water. The methanol yield changed with the applied potential and not necessarily with an increase of it (Fig. 7 b). At high potentials, water splitting becomes predominant and the selectivity towards CO2 reduction decreased while the hydrogen evolution rate increased. The electromotive force bias from the concentration cell caused methanol occurrence very close to the reversible potential (1.18V). Chromatographic analyses revealed the presence of methanol only, no other products were detected in the liquid fraction (Fig. 7 c). A maximum methanol production rate was obtained at 1.25V, which appeared as a suitable operating condition in terms of selectivity towards methanol vs. hydrogen. It is remarkable that the voltage efficiency under this condition is very high (94%) compared to the literature where potentials higher than 2V are reported (between 2.4 and 6.0V), which means voltage efficiencies lower than 65% (i.e. between 20% and 62.5%) [18]. The loss of efficiency in an electrolysis cell is distributed among the cathode overpotential, anode overpotential, and ohmic losses mainly due to the membrane ionic resistance. To estimate the contribution of the cathode and anode overpotentials to the overall loss of efficiency of the present co-electrolysis cell, at an operating current density of 200mAcm−2, the actual cell voltage (1.6V) was compared to that of a similar PEM cell equipped with a perfluorosulfonic membrane, with the same anode and a different cathode, and operating under water electrolysis only (1.5V) [34]. The cathode of a PEM water electrolyser is usually not contributing significantly to the efficiency loss of the cell [34] and is often considered as an internal reference electrode for the anode. Considering that the series resistance of the present cell was 0.2 Ohm cm2, the corresponding ohmic drop at 200mAcm−2 was calculated in 0.04V. The anode overpotential, estimated from the water electrolysis cell [34] was around 0.235±0.02V at 200mAcm−2. Thus, by subtracting to the overall co-electrolysis cell voltage of 1.6V, the reversible potential (1.185V from Eq. (3)), the anode overpotential (0.235V) and the ohmic drop (0.04V), we derived that the cathode overpotential at 200mAcm−2 for the present co-electrolysis cell was about 0.14 ± 0.02V. This almost corresponds to the voltage difference between the CO2-fed and water fed cells by taking into account the different reversible potentials. We have now compared the cell voltage for water splitting (hydrogen and oxygen evolutions) using the same type of cell and very similar polymer electrolyte but to provide an estimation of the contributions of the cathode overpotential to the overall loss of efficiency. No relevant evidence of organic compounds excluding unreacted CO2 was observed in the chromatogram of the gas product carried out with a microGC. The effect of cell temperature on the current-time profile for the cell based on PtRu/C cathode is shown in Fig. 8 a. A similar current profile to that described previously was observed regardless of temperature, but with an obvious increase of current density with temperature as a consequence of faster kinetics at the same potential (1.25V). The yield to methanol, shown in Fig. 8 b, was greatly increasing with temperature from 40°C (0.9μmolg−1 h−1) to 80°C (48.9μmolg−1 h−1) and then a moderate increase at 95°C (56μmolg−1 h−1). The latter is close to the operating temperature limit of the Nafion® membrane. Thus, some other limitation may have affected the cell behavior at 95°C. Like in the discussion of the effect of potential, the chromatograms of the liquid exhaust gave only methanol as reaction product with PtRu/C. The relevant aspect is the exponential increase of methanol production rate with temperature which reflects the increased reactivity of CO2 [37,38]."
9,Ru/C catalyst as cathode for CO2 reduction in a co-electrolysis process,"3.3 Ru/C catalyst as cathode for CO2 reduction in a co-electrolysis process Fig. 9 shows the polarization curves and the ac-impedance spectra (inset) of the cell based on a pure Ru/C cathode at two different temperatures. At low overpotentials, the cell based on the Ru/C showed lower current density compared to the cell with the PtRu/C cathode (Fig. 5); however, there was an increase of current with temperature also at lower potentials in the presence of CO2. The increase of the current associated to the stripping of adsorbed reduced CO2-species at high temperature for the Ru/C catalyst indicated a good capability of Ru to chemisorb CO2 species also at 80°C. This behavior appeared different from that registered with PtRu where a decrease of the current density at 80°C with CO2 was registered in the polarization curve (Fig. 5). The capability of the Ru/C catalyst to adsorb CO2 is also envisaged from the Nyquist plots represented in the inset of Fig. 9. The total impedance increases when using CO2 gas compared to the experiments carried out in humidified inert gas. Higher impedance values were obtained with Ru/C if compared to PtRu/C (Fig. 6) at both 30°C and 80°C, due to the much slower kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction in the absence of Pt. In addition, in this case, it is evident that the electrode exposure to CO2 at suitable electrode potentials for a sufficient time causes indeed some electrode poisoning effect with increased charge transfer resistance. This causes an overlapping of the relaxation processes associated to charge transfer and diffusion phenomena at 30°C. However, in the presence of CO2 at 80°C, there are evident diffusion constraints at low frequencies with the clear evidence of a second semicircle at low frequencies. Steady-state chronoamperometric analysis at low potentials (Fig. 10 a) showed just a two-fold difference in current density for PtRu/C versus Ru/C catalyst even though the differences encountered both in polarization curves and impedance spectra were more significant. In the case of Ru/C, the analysis of the reaction products for the test carried out at 80°C and 1.25V showed a decrease of methanol yield, but the occurrence of ethanol and iso-propanol as additional reaction products (Fig. 10 b and c). Fig. 10 c shows the chromatograms obtained using the Ru/C catalyst as cathode, corroborating the evidence that this catalyst is less selective than the PtRu/C catalyst with lower methanol yield at similar operating conditions, but there is a clear evidence of other reaction products such as ethanol and isopropanol. The energy densities of ethanol and iso-propanol are higher than that of methanol. Based on the higher heating values of these fuels, ethanol contains 1.8 times the energy of methanol while the same ratio is 2.8 for iso-propanol. Considering the different energy density, an equivalent methanol molar production rate can be estimated as represented by the shadowed areas in Fig. 10 b."
10,Comparative analysis for CO2 electro-reduction at PtRu/C and Ru/C catalysts a,"3.4 Comparative analysis for CO2 electro-reduction at PtRu/C and Ru/C catalysts a The CO2 reduction at both PtRu and Ru catalysts could be associated to a mixed electrochemical-catalytic process since the variation of alcohol productivity with potential is different from that expected in a pure electrochemical process. Alternatively, it may be considered that hydrogen evolution is prevailing at high potential thus limiting the CO2 reduction. This effect appears more relevant for the PtRu catalyst. The observed difference in terms of selectivity between Pt-Ru/C and Ru/C can be ascribed, beside the different chemistry, also to the different morphology. Distribution of PtRu particles at the edges of the carbon agglomerates may promote formation of methanol by reaction between adsorbed CO species from the electro-reduction of CO2 and the evolved hydrogen from water reduction. Whereas the distribution of amorphous Ru particles inside the catalyst agglomerates may instead promote C-C bond formation. It was hypothesized in the literature that the chemistry involved in the C-C coupling reactions to form C2–C3 products at different catalysts occurs through an enol-like surface intermediate [39]. The current efficiency values for PtRu/C and Ru/C cathodes-based cells under the best operating conditions (cell potential of 1.25V, 80°C) for the two systems are reported in Table 2 . The best value of current efficiency is approaching 1% with Ru/C whereas it is lower for PtRu/C due to the strongly competitive hydrogen evolution that is more efficient at Pt sites. Even if the current efficiency is still too low for practical applications, the values here reported appear to provide a promising baseline for an enhancement of the CO2 reduction process by co-electrolysis. Kriescher et al. [18] have recently reported current efficiencies up to 0.12% with a similar co-electrolysis system based on proton conducting membrane and operating at high cell potentials (3.9V) but using Cu-based cathode catalysts. Working with a Ru-based catalyst at low cell potentials appears more advantageous, not only from the point of view of selectivity, resulting in a higher current efficiency (up to 0.91%), but also from the point of view of voltage efficiency (>90%). Some recent reports have investigated membrane-electrode assemblies for CO2 reduction (in gas phase) to hydrocarbons using gas diffusion electrodes [26]. Interestingly, Faradaic efficiencies of about 12% have been reported using Cu-based electro-catalysts at about −1.8V vs. Ag/AgCl. CH4 was the main product observed in the gas-phase [26]. A Faradaic efficiency larger than 5% was observed for methanol production at Cu-based electrodes and about 10% for ethanol production in a potential range between −1.5 and −1.7V vs. Ag/AgCl [27]. Suitable Faradaic efficiencies for CO2 conversion to alcohols and hydrocarbons have been also achieved in several other reports, mainly using Cu-based electrodes [9,37,40–45]; but in most cases, this high Faradaic efficiency was associated to high electrode overpotentials. Catalyst formulations including Ag, Ru, Sn and Pt metals have also been studied [46–52] but operation at high voltage efficiency has not been much explored. The present approach is characterized by high electrical efficiency even if the conversion of CO2 to alcohols needs to be increased. However, this can be, in principle, greatly improved by increasing the operating temperature; the present analysis shows indeed a paramount effect of the operating temperature. In this regard, the polymer electrolyte membrane co-electrolysis system suffers now from the typical limitations of the Nafion® membrane. Liquid alkaline electrolytes can provide some enhancement in terms of CO2 solubility [53–55]; however, these probably require a more complex management in terms of balance of plant and offer less perspectives in terms of temperature. In general, the co-electrolysis approach offers an alternative low temperature route for CO2 conversion than photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical processes [56–58] by using consolidated technologies in terms of electrolysis reactor combined to conventional renewable power sources devices."
11,Conclusions,"The co-electrolysis of CO2 and water in a low temperature cell using a proton conducting polymer electrolyte membrane was investigated using PtRu/C and Ru/C catalysts at the cathode, a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane (Nafion®) separator and an IrRuOx anode. The electrocatalytic activity was investigated through polarization experiments and AC-impedance spectroscopy, while the production of alcohols was studied by means of chrono-amperometric tests. The present approach appeared useful for operating the electrocatalytic reactor at low cell potentials (1.25V) to maximize both current and voltage efficiency. PtRu/C catalyst was effective in producing methanol as the only alcohol detected, whereas Ru/C catalyst was less selective producing also ethanol and iso-propanol. Current and voltage efficiency were significantly better than similar electrolysis cells using different catalyst formulations."
