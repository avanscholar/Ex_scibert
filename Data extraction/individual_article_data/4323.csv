0,Introduction,"The rapid growing energy demand with serious environment issue has attracted enormous attention to look for alternative and sustainable resources [1–3]. Higher alcohols have received extensive attention because they can improve the octane number of gasoline and the heat of vaporization, taking advantage of lower vapor pressure and negligible emission of pollution [4–7]. In the past years, various catalysts for the conversion of syngas to higher alcohols have been researched. As a result, several catalytic systems were developed for hydrogenating CO to higher alcohols [8–12]. Among them, alkali-modified molybdenum sulfide catalysts have been extensively investigated since they have high activity for the synthesis of higher alcohols and sulfur-resistant property [13–15]. However, it seems that the reported activity of catalysts is far from the requirement for practical application. Thus, it is necessary to further enhance the activity and selectivity to higher alcohols synthesis. Previous studies showed that the 3d transition metals (such as Ni) were able to enhance the alcohol yield and C2+OH selectivity over K modified MoS2 catalysts [16–18]. Typical conventional alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating an aqueous solution of an oxidic Mo and transition metals salts on support, subsequently calcining and sulfiding [19,20]. For such traditional method, it is very difficult to control the surface composition or define the nature of the active site. Besides, it is easy to form inactive bulk particles, leading to few exposed active sites [21,22]. In fact, small crystallites have advantages to produce alcohols while larger crystallites to hydrocarbons [16]. Furthermore, it has been recognized that the promotion effects are closely related to the structure and morphology of promoter, and the highly-dispersed promoter species always lead to the high performance of the higher alcohol synthesis [20,23]. On this basis, it is interesting to search for new Mo-based catalysts with a number of exposed active sites and highly dispersive MoS2 species. The numerous computational and experimental studies have shown that the edge sites of MoS2 planes have excellent catalytic activity for higher alcohols synthesis [23–25]. A promising approach is to directly design molybdenum sulfide catalyst using organometallic clusters, because their structures are well defined and offer an opportunity to form the nature of the active site, which can vividly simulate the MoS2 edge sites in catalytic reactions. In particular, heterobimetallic cluster catalysts can be used to further understand the correlation of the structural characteristics and the activity of these catalysts. Herein, we investigated the catalytic performance of Mo sulfide catalysts prepared from the cluster compound (NH4)2Mo3S13∙H2O and NiMo3S13∙2H2O for higher alcohols synthesis. The cluster [Mo3S13]2− is a trimer analogue. In addition, these materials have excellent thermal stability and abundant exposed active sites. In particular, NiMo3S13∙2H2O bimetallic sulfide cluster is a great promising precursor for the higher alcohols synthesis because it can form molecularly-dispersed Ni on the surface of catalyst. Therefore, they can be used to elucidate the fundamental reaction mechanisms. It was found that the catalytic activity remarkably increased over K-NiMo3Sx catalyst derived from NiMo3S13∙2H2O bimetallic sulfide cluster, and it exhibited the highest higher alcohols selectivity (59.71%) and STY of total alcohols (497 mg/g/h) among the three samples. On the basis of the characterizations of catalysts, the high catalytic performance of K-NiMo3Sx was related to the interaction between Ni and Mo in the NiMo3S13∙2H2O molecular structure, which facilitated the formation of active phase NiMo3Sx."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)2Mo7O24∙4H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, >99%), ammonium sulphide ((NH4)2S, Alfa Aesar, 20% aq. soln.), potassium carbonate (K2CO3, Alfa Aesar, >99%) and nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2∙6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, >99%) were used in the experiments."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation (NH4)2Mo3S13∙H2O was obtained through the reaction of (NH4)2S, (NH4)2Mo7O24∙4H2O and S [26]. (NH4)6Mo7O24∙4H2O (3.02 g) was dissolved in 40 mL of a (NH4)2S aqueous solution (20%) until the precipitation of (NH4)2MoS4 as an abundant crystalline red solid formed. Elemental sulfur (1.23 g) was added to the solution, which was heated under reflux at about 90 °C for 12 h. Then, the hot solution was filtered, and the resultant solid was washed with water (25 mL) and dried with ethanol and diethylether. NiMo3S13∙2H2O was obtained through the reaction of Na2Mo3S13∙H2O and NiCl2∙6H2O. Molybdenum sulfide catalysts were prepared using molybdenum sulfide cluster as precursor by in situ thermal decomposition method, which were labelled as K-NiMo3Sx and K-Mo3Sx. The molar ratio of K/Mo in the two catalysts was 0.7:1. K-NiMo3Sx was synthesized by grounding K2CO3 with NiMo3S13∙2H2O (K/Mo = 0.7) in a mortar and pestle in ether for 1h, and the resulting mixture was dried. Before reaction, the catalysts were decomposed in situ by syngas at 10MPa with WHSV of 3000 h−1 and 330 °C for 12 h K-Mo3Sx (K/Mo = 0.7) was prepared by mixing (NH4)2Mo3S13∙H2O with K2CO3 in a mortar and pestle and the procedure was similar to that of K-NiMo3Sx. In order to demonstrate that K-NiMo3Sx catalyst derived from heterobimetallic cluster could significantly improve the formation of higher alcohols, the Ni prompter was introduced to K-Mo3Sx catalyst by mechanical mixing method to give K-Mo3Sx-NiAc with a K/Ni/Mo molar ratio of 2.1/1/3. The preparation procedure of K-Mo3Sx-NiAc was the same as the K-Mo3Sx except the introduction of Ni(CH3COO)2∙4H2O. The actual molar ratios K/Mo, K/Mo/Ni and K/Mo/Ni in the three catalysts K-Mo3Sx, K-Mo3Sx-NiAc and K-NiMo3Sx calculated by the ICP-AES results were 0.696: 1, 0.720:1:0.338 and 0.703:1:0.331, respectively (Table S1). The molar ratios K/Mo/S, K/Mo/Ni/S and K/Mo/Ni/S in K-Mo3Sx, K-Mo3Sx-NiAc and K-NiMo3Sx measured by XPS were 0.728:1:2.32, 0.668:1:0.385:2.59 and 0.742:1:0.367:2.74 respectively (Table S2)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a Panalytical X-Pert PRO diffractometer. Thermogravimetric analysis of the molybdenum sulfide clusters was carried out in a TG-DTG Instruments Exstar 7300 apparatus, with a heating rate of 5 K/min, in the 298–1173 K range under a 50 ml/min nitrogen flow. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 automatic analyzer equipped with a TCD and the reactor effluent composition was continuously monitored as a function of sample temperature by a mass spectrometer (Hiden, QIC-20). Prior to the experiments, the catalysts (0.08 g) were activated for 1 h in Ar at 330 °C, and then cooled to room temperature under the same gas flow. The reduction step was performed in 10% H2 in Ar, with a heating rate of 5 °C/min up to 900 °C. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was applied for the morphology and composition analyses of the as-synthesized samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an XSAM800 XPS spectrometer. Detailed analyses for catalytic products were performed on gas chromatography (GC) (Shimadzu GC-2014)."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The catalytic test for higher alcohols synthesis was conducted at 10.0 MPa, 330 °C and 3000 h−1 in a fixed-bed stainless-steel reactor with id 10 mm. The analyses for catalytic products were described in detail in our previous work [23]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,TG-DTG-MS characterization,"3.1 TG-DTG-MS characterization The decomposition of Mo sulfide clusters was studied by TG-DTG coupled mass spectrometry to understand the decomposition processes. TG-DTG results obtained for (NH4)2Mo3S13∙H2O were shown in Fig. 1 , which demonstrated the stability of the triangle of quadrivalent molybdenum. The TG and DTG curves showed three steps of decomposition. The weight loss for the first step corresponded to the removal of water. The second decomposition step started at about 209 °C and ended at 271 °C with a weight loss of 4.45% (the calculated value 4.48%). The analysis of MS data demonstrated that both NH3 and H2S were emitted in the second step. According to the TG-MS results, we could conclude that the loss of the half mole of sulfur occurred as H2S from the removal of the μ3-S atom. Since there was only one μ3-S atom per cluster formula, the rearrangement took place in the remaining cluster and formed an intermediate (NH4)2Mo6S25 with only one central sulfur during the decomposition process. For this decomposition step, the positions of three molybdenum atoms remain almost unchanged. To further confirm the intermediate, SEM-EDS was applied to the intermediate phase obtained by the decomposition of (NH4)2Mo3S13∙H2O in Ar at 270 °C. From the EDS analysis, it is observed that the Mo/S atomic ratio of the intermediate phase was 1:4.11 (Fig S1), which is very close to the theoretical value of intermediate (NH4)2Mo6S25 phase (1:4.16), indicating that the intermediate (NH4)2Mo6S25 phase was formed during the decomposition process. The third decomposition step occurred at 292 °C, both NH3 and H2S were identified in the mass spectrum, indicating that an intermediate (NH4)2Mo6S25 phase decomposed, together with the emission of sulfur from the three terminal S2 2− groups [26]. Afterwards, the bridging S2 2− ligands were reduced to S2− ligands and Mo3S6 intermediate was formed [26]. Since Mo3S6 intermediate was coordinatively unsaturated, it was expected to exhibit high reactivity. With increasing temperature, the stacking of the Mo3S6 intermediate phase tended to aggregate, resulting in microcrystalline MoS2. The temperature of the catalytic reaction at 330 °C just occured in the formation stage of Mo3S6 intermediate, which could produce a large number of coordinated unsaturated sites relating to the enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, the thermal decomposition process of NiMo3S13∙2H2O was similar to (NH4)2Mo3S13∙H2O (Fig. 2 ). The first decomposition step occurred below 100 °C, which corresponded to the removal of water. In the second step, two sulfur atoms lost in the molecular structure at 258 °C. The last decomposition step coincided with the S production peaks between 350 °C and 470 °C indicated the formation of NiMo3S11 intermediate, which was further confirmed by measuring the Ni/Mo/S atomic ratio of NiMo3S11 intermediate phase using SEM-EDS measurements. The EDS of NiMo3S11 phase was shown in Fig. S2, which revealed that the Ni/Mo/S atomic ratio is 6.67/20.52/72.81 = 1:3.07:10.9. It is very close to the calculated value by TG-DTG."
8,X-ray diffraction analysis,"3.2 X-ray diffraction analysis Fig. 3 showed the XRD patterns of the used catalysts. The JCPDS chemical spectra database was used to match the most probable phases in the catalysts. The peaks at 2θ values of 33.2° and 58.7° for the catalysts derived from molybdenum sulfide clusters were the reflection of MoS2 crystallites. However, the characteristic diffraction peak of the (002) planes of MoS2 domains at 2θ≈14° was not observed, implying that it formed fewer stacking layers and highly dispersed MoS2 particles because the intensity of the (002) planes represents the stacking degree of MoS2 layers along the c direction in the lattice [27–29]. The above results also indicated that [Mo3S13]2− anion cluster as precursor had an advantage of forming much smaller size (002) basal plane MoS2 particles, because the Mo3S6 intermediate was easy to aggregate and form microcrystalline MoS2 during the decomposition of [Mo3S13]2− anion. This was confirmed by the TG-DTG analysis. The XRD of the K-NiMo3Sx catalyst was shown in Fig. 3(c). The strong peaks of K2SO4 species were observed at 26.2, 28.1, 29.6 and 30.7°, which was ascribed to the formation of the K-Mo-S active phase that was oxidized by exposing air after reaction [30,31]. Moreover, the XRD patterns of three catalysts before reaction were shown in Fig. S3, it is clear that the characteristic reflection peaks of K2SO4 were not observed, illuminating that K2SO4 specie was formed by exposing air after reaction. It could be suggested that heterobimetallic cluster (NiMo3S13∙2H2O) was favorable for producing a large number of active phase. In contrast with that in K-NiMo3Sx, the characteristic reflections corresponding to the crystalline structure of Ni3S2 were observed at 2θ values of 21.7, 31.1, 37.7, 44.3, 49.7, 50.1 and 55.1° in K-Mo3Sx-NiAc prepared by adding Ni promoter to K-Mo3Sx using mechanical mixing method, demonstrating that NiMo3S13 cluster facilitated an intimate interaction between Ni and Mo, and this interaction was an efficient barrier against Ni phase separation to form inactive bulk Ni3S2 particles, which were active for the formation of hydrocarbons [16]. Thus, NiMo3S13 cluster was beneficial for improving the selectivity towards alcohols."
9,TPR study,"3.3 TPR study TPR analysis was applied in order to reveal the presence of various sulfur species related to the active sites for higher alcohols synthesis and to evaluate the effect of the interaction between Ni and Mo on the formation of various sulfur species. In the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) study, we also detected gaseous H2S evolved from catalysts upon linear heating under hydrogen flow. TPR and the corresponding mass signal of the catalysts after in situ activated at 330 °C were shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . According to the TPR results, the K-Mo3Sx catalyst showed two reduction zones, namely, a strong peak at low temperature and a low intensity broad peak in the high temperature zone (Fig. 4a). The H2 consumption sharp peak and corresponding H2S peak were observed in low temperature between 200 and 400 °C, which was ascribed to the non-stoichiometric sulfur phase Sx, which formed from the emission of sulfur from the three terminal S2 2− groups of the intermediate (NH4)2Mo6S25 phase [32–34]. In this region, the Sx was removed and the coordinative unsaturated sites were created, which were believed to be responsible for the formation of active sites and active phases [34,35]. In the high temperature region between 490 and 580 °C, a small H2 consumption associated with a H2S production peak was found, which was due to more strongly bound S2− of Mo3S6 intermediate, which formed by reducing the bridging S2 2- ligands of (NH4)2Mo6S25 phase to S2− ligands [36]. When Ni promoter was added to K-Mo3Sx by mechanical mixture method, the TPR patterns of K-Mo3Sx-NiAc (Fig.4b) resembled those of K-Mo3Sx below 550 °C. The first reduction peak covered the temperature region 227–418 °C starting from 227 °C and reaching a maximum at 361 °C, which was coincided with a H2S production peak. Between 465 and 544 °C, a small H2 consumption peak was observed together with a corresponding H2S production peak. The most significant changes were that two small peaks were found at higher temperature about 606 °C, where a H2 consumption peak was associated with a H2S peak because of the reduction of Ni3S2 phase (Fig. S4). However, a H2 consumption peak accompanied by a H2O production peak was ascribed to the reduction of oxidized species at 664 °C, which was caused by the oxidization of active phase (Ni–Mo–S) during in situ activated condition. The TPR profile of the K-NiMo3Sx catalyst prepared from heterobimetallic NiMo3S13 cluster precursor was also examined and showed a great difference, as shown in Fig. 5a. Compared to K-Mo3Sx-NiAc, the K-NiMo3Sx catalyst exhibited two overlapping H2S peaks with one at 289 °C and the other at 361 °C due to the hydrogenation of the Sx species, which may be generated by several types of Sx corresponding to some kinds of active phases in the K-NiMo3Sx catalyst. In addition, the first reduction peak of K-NiMo3Sx catalyst shifted to lower temperature compared to that of K-Mo3Sx-NiAc catalyst. It may be ascribed to close interaction between Ni and Mo in the molecular structure of NiMo3S13, leading to the existence of more easily reducible Sx species on the catalyst surface. It also suggested that the interaction between the Mo and Ni in K-NiMo3Sx was stronger than that between the Mo species and Ni promoter in K-Mo3Sx-NiAc. These results indicated that the removal of Sx species could generate coordinatively unsaturated sites, which could be occupied by highly dispersion Ni, leading to the formation of “NiMoS”, which was generally reported as active phase of higher alcohol synthesis [16,37–39]. In conclusion, K-NiMo3Sx catalyst derived from NiMo3S13 cluster had many advantages in the formation of higher alcohols. Fig. 5b showed the TPR curves of catalysts after reaction. The low temperature reduction peak was observed following the mass signal of H2O in all catalysts, suggesting that the active species on coordinatively unsaturated sites (active sites) have been oxidized [30]. For K-NiMo3Sx, the high temperature reduction peak and corresponding H2O production peak shifted to higher temperature compared to other two catalysts, indicating that the species formed after air exposure oxidation are different, which further implicated that the intermediate active phase is also different."
10,TEM analysis,"3.4 TEM analysis To explore the relationship between the catalytic activities and the morphology of MoS2 catalyst, TEM was employed to characterize the microstructures and the size distribution of catalysts. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , the TEM results clearly showed the typical layered structure of MoS2 slabs with shorter slab length and less stacked. Moreover, the slabs were homogeneously distributed on the catalyst surface, indicating that catalysts prepared from [Mo3S13]2− anion cluster was favorable for the formation of smaller particles and the exposure of more active sites, which were responsible for the higher activity because the catalytic reactions were mainly performed on the edges of the slabs [40,41]. Furthermore, EDS-mapping of elemental Mo and S showed that the elements of Mo and S were homogeneously distributed on the entire surface of catalysts (Fig. S5), indicating the formation of well-dispersed MoS2 particles in the three catalysts K-Mo3Sx, K-Mo3Sx-NiAc and K-NiMo3Sx. The above-mentioned analysis was also supported by the XRD analysis where the (0 0 2) diffraction peak of all catalysts was absent. For K-Mo3Sx-NiAc catalyst, the addition of Ni promoter using mechanical mixture method generated the separated Ni3S2 phase with the lattice space values of 0.2346 nm (Fig. 6b). The Ni3S2 particles in K-Mo3Sx-NiAc showed very large average sizes of 30 nm, which was conducive to forming hydrocarbons rather than alcohols. This observation was in complete agreement with the XRD results. In sharp contrast, the separated Ni3S2 phase was not observed in K-NiMo3Sx (Fig. 7a) instead of appearing a new phase with the lattice space values of 0.2231 nm (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the new phase was highly dispersed on catalyst surface with an average particle size of 4 nm (Fig. 7d). The corresponding EDX spectra of the selected agglomerate showed Ni, Mo and S elements with Ni/Mo/S atomic ratio of 7.63/22.90/0.14/44.39 ≈ 1:3:5.8 (Fig. 7c), which represented the formation of NiMo3Sx new phase. This result demonstrated that K-NiMo3Sx derived from NiMo3S13 cluster still kept the strong interaction of Ni–Mo, which was consistent with XRD and TG analyses. From these TEM results, it could be concluded that heterobimetallic NiMo3S13 cluster caused the formation of NiMo3Sx phase by the strong interaction Ni-Mo, leading to excellent catalytic performance for higher alcohols synthesis. Previous studies showed that the improved performance of K-MoS2 catalysts by the promotion of Ni is related to the structural modification effect of Ni on the edge surfaces of MoS2. Thus, the NiMoS phase formed by the interaction of Ni with Mo exerted a function for CO insertion thereby improving the selectivity to higher alcohols [16,17,39]."
11,XPS analysis,"3.5 XPS analysis In order to further study the effect of chemical nature of metal species on catalytic activity, XPS measurements were adopted to characterize the chemical bonding structure and composition of catalysts, which were depicted in Table 1 , Figs. 8, 9 and S6–S8 . The decomposition of the Mo 3d spectra was obtained after subtraction of a continuous background of secondary electrons (Shirley method). The FWHMs were assumed to be approximately the same for all the components used to fit S 2p or Mo 3d5/2 spectra. The spin-orbit splitting were 1.19 and 3.20 eV for S 2p and Mo 3d, respectively [42,43]. The decomposition of Mo 3d spectra was well documented in Table 1. Molybdenum existed as disulfide MoS2 (Mo4+), Mo oxide phase (MoOx, Mo6+) and an intermediate state Mo oxysulfide (MoOxSy, Mo5+), where the Mo oxide was due to the oxidation of active phase in air [31]. Comparing the Mo 3d spectra (Table 1), we found that the binding energy of Mo 3d shifted towards lower binding energies in Ni-containing catalysts. These peak shifts of Mo 3d binding energy indicated that the interaction existed between Ni and Mo. In particular, Mo 3d binding energy of K-NiMo3Sx catalyst decreased more than that of K-Mo3Sx-NiAc, suggesting that strong interaction between Ni and Mo existed in K-NiMo3Sx. We will discuss this issue in detail later. The Ni2p XPS spectra of K-NiMo3Sx and K-Mo3Sx-NiAc were shown in Figs. 8 and 9. On the surface of catalysts, Ni may exist as Ni(II), NiSx and NiMoS [44–46]. As shown in Table 2 , the surface atomic ratio of NiMoS phase on the surface of K-NiMo3Sx was higher than that on K-Mo3Sx-NiAc. Thus, the heterobimetallic NiMo3S13 cluster had advantage in the formation of NiMoS phase due to the featured molecule structure, and it could ultimately result in enhanced catalytic performance for higher alcohols synthesis since NiMoS phase was active phase for higher alcohols synthesis. Moreover, the binding energy of Ni2p3/2 in K-NiMo3Sx was lower than that in K-Mo3Sx-NiAc, indicating that the Ni-Mo interaction in K-NiMo3Sx was stronger than that in K-Mo3Sx-NiAc. This effect was helpful for forming active phase NiMoS and in complete agreement with the TEM, TPR and TG analysis."
12,Catalytic studies,"3.6 Catalytic studies In order to understand the promotional effect in higher alcohols synthesis from syngas, we prepared catalysts derived from [Mo3S13]2− anion cluster. The catalytic activity evaluation toward higher alcohols synthesis were carried out under similar conditions at 330 °C, 10 MPa, 3000 h−1 (mg/g/h) and H2 to CO molar ratio of 1. The catalytic performance of K-Mo3Sx, K-Mo3Sx-NiAc and K-NiMo3Sx was shown in Fig. 10 . The detailed reaction results are summarized in Table 3 , The STY of the total alcohols and selectivity to alcohols were high, implicating that [Mo3S13]2− anion cluster as precursor could produce highly dispersed MoS2 particles. These were verified by XRD, TEM and TPR analyses with the observation of the less stacked MoS2 layers and the abundant of coordinatively unsaturated sites. Moreover, the distribution of alcohols over these catalysts showed that it is mainly a mixture of C1–C4 linear alcohols, and C2H5OH is the main product in the alcohol products for K-Mo3Sx-NiAc and K-NiMo3Sx catalysts (Table S3, Figs. S9, Figure 10 and S11). More importantly, the catalytic results of K-NiMo3Sx catalyst derived from the heterobimetallic cluster NiMo3S13 testified that Ni promoter could increase the selectivity of higher alcohols and the catalytic activity for higher alcohols was related to a synergistic effect of Ni-Mo. To make the argument more convincing, the reference catalyst K-Mo3Sx-NiAc was prepared by the addition of Ni using mechanical mixture method. As a result, K-NiMo3Sx showed significantly higher activity featuring the STY and the selectivity of higher alcohol values of 497 mg/g/h and 59.71%, respectively, while K-Mo3Sx-NiAc catalyst showed low activities with the STY and the selectivity of higher alcohol values of 440 mg/g/h and 41.94%, respectively. In addition, K-Mo3Sx-NiAc showed significantly higher CO conversion (46.14%), while K-NiMo3Sx catalyst showed a little lower CO conversion (41.41%). This was mostly ascribed to the fact that the content of Ni promoter in K-NiMo3Sx catalyst is a little lower than that in K-Mo3Sx-NiAc (Table S2). Usually, within a certain concentration range, the more the content of Ni promoter is, the more active sites the catalyst. Furthermore, the CO conversion and the STY of total hydrocarbons for K-Mo3Sx-NiAc are higher than that for K-NiMo3Sx catalyst. This remarkable enhancement to hydrocarbons could be attributed to the formation of bulk Ni3S2 phase in K-Mo3Sx-NiAc, which was favorable for forming hydrocarbons. Therefore, in combination with TEM, TPR, XRD and XPS results we can come to the conclusion that K-NiMo3Sx catalyst prepared from NiMo3S13 cluster precursor considerably decreased the formation of bulk inactive phase Ni3S2, and NiMo3S13 cluster strengthened the Ni–Mo interaction and thus increased the amount of NiMo3Sx active phase, thereby improving the catalytic activity. All the results mentioned above suggest that the catalytic activity of higher alcohols synthesis was close related with the formation of NiMoS active phase on the basis of the formation of coordinatively unsaturated sites."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, two clusters with different structures were used as precursors to prepare a series of catalysts, which exhibited remarkably different catalytic activities for higher alcohols synthesis. The catalysts derived from [Mo3S13]2− anion cluster precursor showed high catalytic activity. However, the catalyst synthesized using heterobimetallic cluster as precursor exhibited superior catalytic activity featuring a STY and the selectivity of higher alcohols values of 497 mg/g/h and 59.71%. The main reason was that the strong interaction between Ni and Mo played an important role in formation of active phase NiMoS. Using Mo sulfide clusters for preparation of cluster-derived catalysts have several advantages. Firstly, these precursors are already in the “sulfided state”, and they can be activated by in situ thermal decomposition reaction. Secondly, under reaction condition, the cluster compounds can undergo decomposition to generate microcrystalline, which can produce a large amount of coordinatively unsaturated sites. Thirdly, NiMo3S13 sulfide cluster tends to generate uniform molecular ensembles to improve both the dispersion of active metals and sulfidation of active components. Finally, NiMo3S13 sulfide cluster can be used as molecular model to study the promotional effect in higher alcohols synthesis from syngas. In brief, the most key factor for obtaining highly efficient molybdenum sulfide catalyst was to produce considerable amount of coordinatively unsaturated sites, on which abundant NiMoS active phase can be formed and the formation of bulk inactive phase should be avoided."
