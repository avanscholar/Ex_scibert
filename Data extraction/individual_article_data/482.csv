0,Introduction,"The world’s economic activities have significantly been dependent upon the fossil fuels and the reason is the steady upsurge in global energy demand. The consumption of fossil fuels and rise in global warming has become a growing concern as time passes without a stable alternative energy method to satisfy the immense power demand [1,2]. Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar have been recently explored to attempt in reducing the depletion of crude oils and gasses in order to obtain a sustainable energy production system [3]. Researchers have developed networks to analyze and interpret energy-related data for non-renewable sources over time. By doing so, scientists and engineers can predict future trends, and thereby depict the energy crisis in a numerical and graphical representation. A WoLiM model [4] suggests alternative energy technologies are the only answer to meeting the power demands by 2050, and therefore require advancement in the efficiencies and effectiveness of alternative methods to meet these demands. An empirical approach was utilized which predicted the excessive amounts of fossil fuels by the year 2050 due to the power growth rate of 2.6%/yr. The effective alternative energy methods must be established to meet the demand and account for the depletion of fossil fuels [5]. Hydrogen production has become the center of attention for carbon-free solution, and more attention has been given to clean methods of hydrogen production. The generation of pure hydrogen gas requires a great deal of energy. However, considering the diatomic molecules are emission free upon combustion, hydrogen gas is scientifically desired and thus greatly researched in lowering the effective cost of production for countless numbers of applications [6]. The microwave plasma source (MPS) based method is one of the promising technologies for hydrogen production. A number of researches are being conducted on the microwave application in chemical industries. Liquid hydrogen is used for National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space explorations with a combination of liquid oxygen as their main source of fuel, acting as an effective combustible rocket propellant [7]. The high density of liquid hydrogen is preferred over the lightweight, low density hydrogen gas not because of the reactivity of the liquids, but simply because of its ability to compact within a smaller reservoir to increase the storage tanks energy density [8]. However, the stationarity storage of hydrogen gas is preferred over liquid hydrogen as the gaseous molecule leaves a smaller footprint when stored in high pressure reservoirs, as opposed to being in the liquid state where refrigeration units are required. Furthermore, hydrogen gas has a greater energy value per mass than gasoline, where hydrogen gas is 120 MJ/kg and gasoline is 44 MJ/kg [9]. Plasma is the most abundant state of matter in the universe and is used for many engineering applications such as nuclear fusion, photolithography, supersonic flight, and many more [10]. Depending on the environment of the induced plasma, the duration of the plasma may only last for a couple of nanoseconds prior to dying back down [11]. The use of a tungsten antenna within a water vapor filled reaction vessel is a novel technique which is comprehensively analyzed and investigated in this study. Dias et al. [12] conducted an experimental study to extract hydrogen gas from the dissociation of water vapor with the use of a magnetron, however, the ionization of an electrode is not used to generate their plasma. Instead, they ionize a buffer gas by generating a microwave electric field through a discharge space. The study concluded that plasma production in water vapor is effectively increased as the vessel pressure decreases, generating a high electron temperature for water dissociation to overcome the intermolecular bond strengths. Nomura et al. [13] used seven uniformly positioned electrodes in a microwave oven. However, n-dodecane is used instead of water vapor for its buffer gas. It was found that 74% of hydrogen gas was formed within the vessel due to the microwave-induced plasma, along with other various hydrocarbons such as methane, ethylene, and acetylene. Czylkowski et al. [14] undertook a study on the kerosene supported atmospheric pressure microwave plasma based hydrogen-enriched gas. They revealed the competence of microwave plasma based hydrogen production under atmospheric pressure by decomposing kerosene. Carmo et al. [15] presented a review paper on the hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. Hydrogen is generally considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. They discussed all methods of hydrogen production via PEM electrolyzer which can also be coupled with renewable energy sources namely; solar and wind. All the challenges and advancements in the PEM electrolyzer were comprehensively addressed in this review study. This review also provided several directions of commercially viable hydrogen production methods for future research. Czylkowski et al. [16] conducted another study on the water vapor plasmolysis based hydrogen production. This study experimentally investigated the liquid compounds holding hydrogen to explore hydrogen production routes. The microwave plasma source supported with a metal cylinder was set to operate at atmospheric pressure and 915 MHz frequency. This study considered isopropanol, ethanol and kerosene liquids in vapor phase, under decomposition using plasma dry reforming (PDR) process. The flow rate of CO2 was ranged between 1200 and 2700 NL/h while the vapor amount was ranged between 0.4 and 2.4 kg/h. The electric power absorbed by the microwave was also accounted and found to be 6 kW. The best experimental results revealed that the rate of hydrogen production can reach up to 1116 NL(H2)/h while the energetic yield was found to be 223 NL(H2)/kWh. Miotk et al. [17] performed an optimization study of a hydrogen production system through a MPS being operated under atmospheric pressure and 2.45 GHz of frequency. The experimental setup was designed to operate with fuels containing hydrogen such as alcohols and hydrocarbons. They used the Weissfloch circuit to identify the discontinuity and it also exempts the solving of Maxwell equations for complicated structures. This study used MPS equivalent circuit to calculate the capacitive metallic diaphragm which helped in calculating the performance improvements. Jasinski et al. [18] presented an experimental investigation on the microwave plasma based hydrogen production. The two different types of MPS operating under atmospheric pressure for hydrogen production were proposed in this study. One of the two systems was nozzle-less waveguide-supported coaxial-line-based and the other one was metal-cylinder-based. These designed systems were capable of being operated up to a few kW of power using 2.45 GHz of frequency. The methane flow rate of 12,000 l/h was used during the experiment and absorbed power can up to 5000 W. This study revealed the MPSs presented have high hydrogen production potential through hydrocarbon conversion. Horikoshi and Serpone [19] presented an in-liquid plasma generation study for nanomaterials fabrication and wastewater treatment. The focus of this review article was on the in-liquid plasma generation and this study also described the progressing technology. This study submerged the plasma and also focused on the wastewater treatment and nanomaterials syntheses. The electrical power is employed to provide extreme reaction fields of high temperature and pressure, without the involvement of the chemical substances. It was revealed that in-liquid plasma based chemical reactions are highly efficient and it was suggested to introduce in-liquid plasma based chemical processes. Tatarova et al. [20] undertook a study on the hydrogen production using microwave plasma torches (MPT). This study employed an MPT based system undergoing atmospheric pressure and 2.45 GHz of frequency and alcohol decomposition tool was used for molecular hydrogen production. They created plasma in CH3OH/C2H5OH and Ar gases mixture utilizing a wave-guide-surfatron launcher under the electrical power of 0.2–2.0 kW. They also investigated the effect of Ar flow fraction through liquid CH3OH/C2H5OH on the partial pressures of H2, CO2 and CO and also the effect of electrical power and total flowrate on hydrogen flow. The spectrum of the optical emission was found from 250 to 700 nm. The results revealed that the atmospheric pressure microwave plasma torch offers a suitable plasma based for producing hydrogen. Despite the previously published studies of plasma-chemical hydrogen-producing methods from hydrocarbon solutions, there have been very few experimental studies on direct decomposition of water vapor using direct plasma discharge and no studies for antenna based microwave hydrogen production. In this study, a unique novel system is designed to decompose water vapor in a commercial modified 2.45 GHz microwave using pure and 2% ceriated tungsten antenna. In one stage, the steam flows by direct discharge into a custom developed reactor inside the 900 W microwave. The high energetic electrons produced by electric field acceleration of 2.45 GHz microwave collide with water vapor molecules, these molecules are ionized and dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen radicals. Ionization, recombination, decomposition of water vapor occur at the tip of the ceriated tungsten. Undecomposed water vapor condenses in the reflux condenser to avoid any recombination of H2 and O2 and to separate and dry the produced gases. The dry gases flow through the outlet of the condenser to the flowmeter and the catalytic hydrogen sensor. The correlation between the input of steam into a plasma generated by tungsten antenna in the enclosed reactor and the production of hydrogen gas is investigated, along with the study of absolute pressure and temperature recordings of the dissociated species. Also, energy and exergy efficiencies of the system are determined and compared to the theoretical energy requirements."
1,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"The experimental setup consists of a 2.45 GHz commercial microwave. A custom designed reactor is placed inside the microwave at the same height as the magnetron. The reactor is made of heat resistant glass to avoid any losses of the MW energy. Tungsten antennas cut in different lengths are placed inside the reactor on an aluminum plate to generate plasma at the tip and consequently interact with water vapor molecules. Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup. In order to measure the flowrate of hydrogen, a reflux condenser attached to a bubbler is used to dry the products from water and to avoid any backflow into the reactor vessel. Then, the generated gas flow into the flow meter (purchased from Alicat) and then to the catalytic hydrogen gas sensor (purchased from ProtiSen™). Temperature, pressure, volume flow rate, and ppm measurements are recorded throughout the experiments. The mass flow rate of water vapor remains constant throughout the plasmolysis process. Ionization dissociation reactions of water vapor molecules allow for the production of an electron and thus adding to the pre-existing, highly concentrated electron density within the reactor. Considering the tungsten electrode is expected to deteriorate to time due to the high temperature electron density, the plasmolysis of water will decrease from the tungsten induced plasma. However, the ionization dissociation reactions occurring after a water-electron collision will result in the contribution to the plasma generation, removing the need for the tungsten electrode after the tungsten electrode is fully consumed. The constant feed of microwave electromagnetic waves will aid this process. Electron collisions with water molecules result in either a full charge transfer, a momentum change, an ionization reaction, a dissociative ionization reaction and other various mechanisms which may aid the dissociation of a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen gas. Considering the low molar mass of hydrogen, the gas will tend to rise to the top of the reaction vessel after being dissociated from a water molecule, enabling the collection process to occur at the highest point of the quartz vessel. Excess water vapor entering the collection valve is condensed from a condenser placed prior to the hydrogen gas collection reservoir. This will ensure the purest form of hydrogen gas with no water vapor present in the holding tank. The thermal activity due to the rate of plasma generation and destruction will be measured and analyzed using a lab equipped thermal imaging camera, while the molar concentration of hydrogen gas will be measured using the hydrogen catalytic sensor with respect to time."
2,Performance assessment,"Performance assessment is done by going through energy and exergy analyses. To understand the system performance and feasibility, a thermodynamic analysis is performed on the system. Here, energy efficiency of the system is defined as the ratio of the desired output produced; hydrogen, inside the reactor to the total amount of useful energy input as follows: (1) η en = n · H 2 . H H V W ̇ electric The performance of the microwave is assessed through exergy efficiency. The exergy flow rate of hydrogen produced is compared to the electric work input of the system as follows: (2) ψ ex = n · H 2 . ex H 2 W ̇ electric"
3,Results and discussion,"The microwave hydrogen production reactor is tested by simply running the microwave for a set of time domain. The mass flow meter records the volumetric flow rate of the produced gas by considering pressure and temperature. While the catalytic sensor measures the concentration of hydrogen produced in ppm. All experiments have been repeated multiple times to validate the results. Inside the microwave, the sealed reactor containing the tungsten electrode is placed facing the outlet of the magnetron. Initially, the temperature topography of the reactor is recorded to check if there is any energy dissipated into heat. Fig. 2 shows the results of the IR camera. The hot area represents the tungsten antenna and the cold area represents the surrounding reactor. The microwave propagates through the sealed reactor with minimum energy losses while generating plasma at the tip of the tungsten. One of the advantages of the tungsten antenna, is that it does not require good vacuum because high temperature operation prevents gas adsorption on the tip of the antenna receiver. The hottest area represents the point where plasma is generated by the microwaves. Also, free electrons gain energy from the electric field inside generated inside the microwave at higher rates than that of ions. Thus they are considered the main energetic species responsible for the dissociation and ionization in plasma. In a first step, steam is injected into the reactor at temperature of 107 °C and flow rate of 2 bbl/s. Plasma is then generated by setting the microwave ON to 50 s. where the generated plasma decomposes the steam molecules into hydrogen and oxygen radicals at the tip of the tungsten electrode. The produced gases, flow with steam into the condenser where water molecules are condensed and separated. The dry gases flow through the outlet of the condenser to the flowmeter and the catalytic hydrogen sensor. Before starting the experiment, a calibration process is carried out on the hydrogen sensor with an accuracy of 200 ppm per step. The molar rate of hydrogen gas is then calculated and energy and exergy efficiencies are found based on the total electric work input of 900 W. Fig. 3 a shows the concentration of hydrogen radicals. The maximum hydrogen concentration reached levels of 4000 ppm. The accuracy of the measurement is found by plotting the voltage output of the sensor and the concentration. Fig. 3b shows the volumetric flow rate of the gases. Also, temperature and pressure measurements are recorded to validate the accuracy of the device. Here the total flow rate is found to be 822.276 mL/s. Based on the flowrate of the products and the concentration of hydrogen gas, energy and exergy efficiency are calculated to be 37% and 30.7% respectively. In earlier theoretical studies, the energy efficiency of water vapor plasmolysis is projected to 50% and above [21]. The energy efficiency of 37% is due to vibrational excitation since electron excitation and dissociative attachment is highly energy-intensive. Givotov et al. [22] developed an experimental setup to study the decomposition of water vapor in a non-isothermal plasma reactor. The energy efficiency was found to be 40%. The result of having higher efficiency experimentally is due to the low degrees of ionization. The exergy efficiency of 30% is due to the electron temperature increase. The water vapor decomposition in plasma requires high degree of ionization. The energy of disassociation is mainly due to vibrational excitation and dissociative attachment. However, this experimental work shows that the energy efficiency of 37% is mainly due to vibrational excitation. To understand the stability of the proposed system continuous testing is required. Fig. 4 a dissipates the concentration of hydrogen as a function of time. This time, the concentration of hydrogen decreases to 2500 ppm while the total mass flow of the gases increases to 1035 mL/s in Fig. 4b when the microwave is turned ON for 70 s. Fig. 5 a shows the tungsten antenna is exhausted inside the reactor. Also, residual carbon is found inside and around the reactor as dissipated in Fig. 5b. It is further concluded that high temperature operation shortens the life of the tungsten antenna due to the material loss by evaporation. However, the energy efficiency is found to be 36% and exergy efficiency is 30% similar to the previous experimental results. The experimental results presented in both scenarios lead to the conclusion that the energy expenditure in hydrogen production in plasma is produced at 9 g/kWh when the input power by the magnetron is 900 W. The ceriated tungsten electrode containing ThO2 (2%) has been widely used due to its durability and reduced rate of vaporization. Also, cerium oxide has the highest migration rate and is generally good for a short time. Ceriated tungsten is tested by replacing the pure tungsten inside the reactor. The experiments are repeated with the same previous conditions. Fig. 6 a represents the results for hydrogen concentration. The generated plasma at the tip of the ceriated tungsten exhibit better performance than pure tungsten. The maximum concentration is found to be 4500 ppm while the total mass flow of the produced gas in Fig. 6b is found to be 787 mL/s. The high energetic electrons produced by electric field acceleration of 2.45 GHz microwave collide with water vapor molecules, these molecules are ionized and dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen radicals. It is clear that Ionization, recombination, decomposition of water vapor occur at the tip of the ceriated tungsten in thin boundary layer. The physics of this region is not clearly understood due to the complex non-equilibrium mechanisms. Several reaction mechanisms are carried out by the microwave discharge plasma reactor in gas vapor phase. Here the energy and exergy efficiencies are 53% and 44% respectively which reflects the theoretical project energy efficiency of 50%. The energy yield of the hydrogen is calculated to be 13.3 g/kWh. In order to further investigate the stability and performance of the 2% ceriated tungsten antenna, multiple tests are performed in sequence without changing any conditions. According to the results in Fig. 7 a, the concentration of hydrogen gas produced reaches 8000 ppm at 900 W microwave power. Both the concentration and the voltage output of the catalytic sensor show a linear increase. The total volumetric flow of the produced gas is found to be 148 mL as presented in Fig. 7b. Here the electric field is strengthened at the tip of the 2% ceriated tungsten antenna, resulting in greater electron energy to vibrate, collide, and decompose water vapor molecules. It is evident that more active species are involved in the production rate of hydrogen where the energy yield is found to be 11.9 g/kWh. Also, energy efficiency attains a maximum of 47% while the exergy efficiency is found to be 39%. In this case, the decomposition of water vapor in plasma is channeled by vibrational and high electron excitation as follows: (3) H 2 O → H - + O H (4) H - + e → H + 2 e - Therefore, the decomposition of water vapor and the production of hydrogen in microwave generated plasma is conducted with better efficiency using 2% ceriated tungsten. The key reason is that a small increase in the electron temperature in the system raises the degree of ionization and increase the fraction of energy concentrated on dissociative sticking of plasma and results in high hydrogen production rate. Table 1 tabulates the initial discharge media and energy yield of four different published studies using plasmolysis to generate hydrogen gas. Using thermal decomposition and dry reforming of ethanol and isopropanol, [23] uses a 5 kW powered microwave to excite electromagnetic waves into an open system reactor, pumping 12–39 hundred L/h of the two alcohols in gaseous form by an induction heating vaporizer into the plasma reactor. Their results yielded 22.2 g/kWh. Additionally, [16] generates hydrogen gas by injecting hydrogen integrated liquids into microwave induced plasma, using a 915 MHz microwave frequency and a 6 kW powered microwave at atmospheric pressure. The flow of liquid is dispersed as a vapor evident in Table 1, with a flow rate between 0.4 and 2.4 kg/h, and an energy yield of 223 NL H2 per kWh [16]. The relationship between the input power of the microwave and hydrogen production was positively correlated, where [16] explains the reasoning is a result of the increased plasma column, however also proven that the energy yield decreases with increased microwave power. Finally, [24] studies the generation of hydrogen gas by a 2.45 GHz microwave-induced plasma using an ethanol solution as a buffer gas. Using an emission spectrometer, [24] investigates species dissociation involved with the plasmolysis of ethanol, concluding a large number of OH, H, and O radicals produced. It was further justified that the splitting of OH bonds from ethanol consumed less energy than those from water molecules, and hence the main source of hydrogen gas was the ethanol dehydrogenation as opposed to the separation of water molecules [24]. Depicted by Table 1, the mass of hydrogen gas per kilowatt-hour is 12.29 g, a similar value achieved by ionizing tungsten electrodes to form plasma in water vapor as conducted in this paper. The direct decomposition of water vapor is considered one of the most natural methods for hydrogen production. The energy efficiency of water vapor decomposition by plasma and hydrogen production is determined by the exergetic energy loss related to the losses in the exoergic forward and reverse reactions due to chemical reactions. Here the highest energy efficiency achieved is 50% using ceriated tungsten and the exergy efficiency is 44% as shown in Fig. 8 . While the lowest energy and exergy efficiencies are found to be 36% and 30% respectively. The theoretical efficiency for water vapor decomposition and hydrogen production in plasma is within the range of 50–70% [21]. Considering the experimental efficiency is within the range of the theoretical work shows that water vapor decomposition requires high degree of ionization channeled by both vibrational and electron excitation."
4,Conclusions,"This study presents a novel method for hydrogen production from water vapor decomposition using a modified commercial microwave plasma generated using tungsten antenna receiver. In one stage, steam flows into the reactor at temperature of 107 °C and flow rate of 2 bbl/s. The plasma is then generated by the microwave is received by the tungsten antenna inside the concealed reactor. The generated plasma decomposes the steam molecules into hydrogen and oxygen radicals at the tip of the tungsten antenna. The produced gases, flow with steam into the condenser where water molecules are condensed and separated. The dry gases flow through the outlet of the condenser to the flowmeter and the catalytic hydrogen sensor. Hydrogen production rate is found to be higher in ceriated tungsten and lower in pure tungsten. The energy and exergy efficiencies are 53% and 44% respectively. While the maximum energy yield for hydrogen is found to be 13.3 g/kWh. The hydrogen production rates are found in the range of 25.7 to 78.3 mL/s. Thus, the high efficiency and productivity of this unique system raise the hope to solve many important problems in energy and sustainability."
