0,Introduction,"In the last two decades, much attention has been directed towards microreactor technology and, in particular, in the field of energy technology [1,2]. The intrinsic properties of microstructured reactors, which are composed of channels in the micrometer range, offer superior heat and mass transfer properties than conventional reactors with larger volumes, as well as safe, compact, and modular operation, thus allowing for process intensification [3]. These properties make microreactors attractive for thermochemical conversion and, in this regard, several groups have developed microscale reformers, i.e. microreformers, to convert hydrocarbons, alcohols or ammonia to hydrogen-rich streams that can be coupled to low-temperature fuel cells (FC), i.e. polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) FC, or solid oxide FC [4]. Microreformers enable the on-site and/or on-demand hydrogen production to feed FC, thus being a practical alternative to hydrogen storage [5], avoiding the difficulties it imposes. Therefore, microreactors appear as a valuable technology to power portable and mobile devices, spanning from several kW to less than 100 W [1]. Several factors affect microreactor design, such as fuel cell type, fuel type, fuel processing approach, operating temperature, catalyst, reactor architecture and materials of fabrication [4]. Considering the miniaturization trend of FC systems, developing microreformers where the hydrogen production scale follows this miniaturization is needed. Meeting these needs requires developing novel manufacturing techniques that allow increasing the hydrogen production per reactor volume while maintaining the system efficiency. In this regard, we have achieved this by using silicon wafers where millions of cylindrical and parallel channels of only 2–4 μm in diameter and ca. 200 μm-long are produced by photo-assisted electrochemical etching [6]. The resulting micromonoliths contain an outstanding number of 4 million channels per square centimetre arranged in a square matrix. This geometry leads to a dramatic increase of the geometric surface area exposed to reactants per reactor volume in the range of 105–106 m2/m3, which is two orders of magnitude higher than for conventional monoliths. Moreover, the regular distribution of channels assures a homogeneous flow distribution. Besides, the use of macroporous silicon allows for its integration with FC on Si technology [7]. A tremendous amount of studies have been reported using microreactors to produce hydrogen from the steam reforming (SR) of different fuels, being methanol, methane, ethanol, and butane the most widely researched [4]. Nevertheless, the hydrogen production from the SR of other renewable substrates, such as polyalcohols, has arisen as a promising route [8,9]. In our previous studies, catalytic silicon micromonoliths had shown an excellent performance to produce hydrogen from the SR of ethanol and dimethyl ether [6,10,11], where H2 production rates normalized per reactor volume two orders of magnitude higher than in conventional reactors were achieved, and to purify hydrogen by selectively oxidizing CO from H2/CO/air streams [12]. In this work, we extend these studies by testing the feasibility and stability of functionalized Si micromonoliths to reform different types of fuels and withstand severe reaction conditions (temperatures up to 1023 K) since, as mentioned above, these are key factors affecting microreactor design. To that end, we investigated the generation of hydrogen from the SR of relevant model organic compounds containing different functional groups and longer carbon chains, namely, alcohols, acids, ethers, ketones, and hydrocarbons. In particular, ethanol, acetic acid, propanone (acetone), 2-propanol (isopropanol), 2-methoxyethanol (methyl cellosolve, C3H8O2) and a diesel surrogate (equivalent formula C12H23) were chosen [13,14]. The suitability of these compounds to generate hydrogen from their steam reforming reactions has been previously investigated in conventional reactors. Acetic acid is a model compound of an organic acid and it is the most representative compound of bio-oil, whose concentration can be up to 12%. Ketones present in bio-oil can be represented by acetone, whose concentration can reach up to 2.8% [15]. On the other hand, the semiconductor industry generates large quantities of waste solutions, which are often composed of aqueous mixtures containing ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, 1-methoxy-2-propanol and butanone and, thus, their SR has been proposed as a suitable alternative to revalorize this waste by producing H2 [16]. In the literature, rhodium-based catalysts have been commonly chosen to reform some of the above-mentioned compounds, and, among the various supports tested, CeO2-supported Rh catalysts showed to be resistant to coke formation [17,18]. In this regard, a catalyst composed of RhPd nanoparticles supported on CeO2was selected for this study due to its high ability to break CC bonds, high H2 selectivity, long stability and low C deposition [19,20]."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Silicon micromonoliths fabrication,"2.1 Silicon micromonoliths fabrication The fabrication process of the silicon micromonoliths has been described elsewhere [21,22]. The structured supports were manufactured by photoelectrochemically etching n-type, float-zone (100) silicon wafers with a resistivity of 2–6 Ω cm. Prior to the electrochemical etching, lithography was used to pre-structure the wafer surface creating a squared matrix of 4-μm pitch. Subsequently, etching with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was performed to create a squared array of inverted pyramids pointing towards the bulk of the wafer. These pyramids defined the positions of pore growth. Next, the electrochemical etching was performed at 288 K bringing the pre-structured surface in contact with an electrolyte composed of 5 wt% hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution and TritonX-100 surfactant (0.1 mmol) as a wetting agent, while the back side was illuminated using LEDs with an 880-nm peak emission wavelength. A constant anodic potential of 2 V was applied for ca. 330 min to achieve a pore depth of 210 μm. After the photoelectrochemical etching, oxidation with dry O2 at 1373 K for 30 min was carried out to grow a SiO2 layer on the microchannels’ walls and the front side. To open the channels from the reverse side, a 25 wt% TMAH solution at 358 K was used to etch off the remaining Si. The process ended dipping the samples in 5 wt% HF to remove the remaining oxides. The fabrication procedure leads to silicon micromonoliths 210 μm-thick and 13 mm in diameter, as seen in Fig. 1 a and b, containing ca. 4·106 microchannels cm−2 of 3.3 μm in diameter, perfectly regular, opened at both sides and arranged in a square lattice with 4 μm periodicity (Fig. 1c). This results in a geometric surface-area-to-volume ratio of 1.2·106 m2 m−3 and an open frontal area of 34%. The pressure drop of the micromonolith was characterized by flowing nitrogen at room temperature and, for instance, a pressure drop of only 102 Pa was measured flowing 37 mL min−1, which is in good agreement with the corresponding value obtained with the Poiseuille law [23]."
3,Catalytic coatings development,"2.2 Catalytic coatings development After the fabrication process, the Si micromonolith was oxidized with dry O2 at 1373 K for 30 min to develop a SiO2 layer over the walls of the microchannels. Subsequently, cerium 2-methoxyethoxide (liquid, Alfa Aesar) was forced to pass through the channels by applying a pressure gradient of 75 kPa between both sides of the micromonolith by using a vacuum pump. Next, the micromonolith with filled channels was calcined at 773 K for 6 h (5 K min−1) to decompose the cerium precursor and form a CeO2 layer on top of the SiO2 layer (Fig. 2 ). Subsequently, nominal 0.5 wt% Rh and 0.5 wt% Pd were anchored on the CeO2 layer by passing a PdCl2 + RhCl3 (Sigma Aldrich) water/acetone solution through the coated microchannels (free impregnation). Finally, the catalytic micromonolith was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined in air at 573 K for 6 h (2 K min−1)."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance (Bruker, Germany) diffractometer equipped with Ni-filtered (2 μm thickness) CuKα radiation and operating at 40 kV and 40 mA (acquisition range from 10° to 80°, 0.02° step size and 1 s dwell time). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained at 200 kV with a JEOL JEM-2010F equipped with a field emission gun. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired with a Neon40 crossbeam station equipped with a Schottky field emission gun (Carl Zeiss) operated at 5 keV and a focused Ga+ ion beam (FIB) (CANION31, Orsay)."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The functionalized Si micromonolith was cut with a laser forming a disk of 8 mm in diameter and glued with epoxy to a stainless steel washer (outer diameter (OD) 19 mm; inner diameter (ID) 7 mm), leaving 1.5·106 microchannels exposed to reactants. This was subsequently sealed inside a stainless steel reactor that was placed inside a tubular furnace (Carbolite) for catalytic testing. Fuel/water mixtures were dosed with a syringe pump (Kent Scientific), which were evaporated before reaching the microreactor with heating bands. The fuels tested were synthetic ethanol (Panreac), acetic acid (Panreac), acetone (Scharlau), isopropanol (Fisher Scientific), 2-methoxyethanol (Acros Organics) and a diesel surrogate of equivalent formula C12H23 (Repsol). To avoid the formation of carbonaceous deposits, overstoichiometric water/fuel ratios were tested [1]. For ethanol and acetic acid steam reforming tests, the water/fuel ratio was kept at 6 and for the other fuels, which are composed of longer C chains, the ratio was increased up to 15, to prevent the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke deposition. The corresponding S/C ratios are listed in Table 1 . Prior to each reforming test, the catalyst was reduced in a 10% H2/He mixture (50 mL min−1 total) at 623 K (5 K min−1) for 1 h, which was dosed using mass flow controllers (M + W instruments). The reforming tests were performed at atmospheric pressure, temperatures ranging between 823 K and 1023 K and at a fixed injection rate of liquid reactants mixture (0.019 mL min−1). 10 mL min−1 of N2 were added at the inlet and were used as an internal standard. These reaction conditions represented contact times of 5–9·10−3 s. No regeneration treatments were performed between the different reforming tests. The condensable products from the reactor effluent were collected in a condenser and the gaseous effluent was analyzed online under steady-state conditions with a microchromatograph (μGC) (Agilent 3000A), which was equipped with a 5 Å Molsieve, a PLOT U and a Stabilwax column. Outlet molar flowrates of the non-condensable products (H2, CO, CO2, CH4) of the reactor effluent were calculated using the composition obtained from the chromatographic analyses and total volumetric flowrate data. The steam reforming reactions (including the water-gas shift reaction) of the different compounds investigated are listed in Eqs. (1)–(6).

Therefore, to compare the performance of the catalytic micromonolith for the different fuels, this factor was taken into consideration to normalize the H2 yield of each experiment, leading to H2 yields defined between 0 and 1, as presented in Eq. (7). The selectivity to reaction products was calculated according to Eq. (8). (7) θ H 2 = n ˙ H 2 x n ˙ f u e l 100 , n = m o l e s (8) S i = n ˙ i ∑ i n ˙ i 100 , i = H 2 , C O 2 , C H 4 , C O ,"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Functionalization of the silicon micromonolith,"3.1 Functionalization of the silicon micromonolith The small dimensions of the microchannels and their large aspect ratio (depth/diameter > 65) required developing a new route to coat the walls of the microchannels with thin catalytic layers without blocking them, as reported elsewhere [6,10–12]. Specifically, the functionalization process consisted of an initial oxidation at 1373 K for 30 min of the Si micromonolith, leading to the formation of homogeneous SiO2 layers ca. 100-nm thick, as seen in Fig. 2. The hydroxyl groups present on the SiO2 layer served as anchoring sites for the liquid cerium alkoxide (Ce(OCH2 CH2 OCH3)4) precursor. After calcination of cerium methoxyethoxide at 773 K, 100-nm thick CeO2 layers were developed on the grown SiO2 layers. Fig. 2 shows SEM images corresponding to an as-functionalized Si micromonolith, where a cross-sectional cut had been performed for characterization purposes. Rh and Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were subsequently anchored to the CeO2 layers via free impregnation followed by calcination at 573 K for 6 h. Some metal aggregates correspond to the bright dots visible inside the channel in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows two adjacent channels with the detail of the catalytic coatings developed on the Si micromonolith structure: the Si wall is visible at the centre, covered by uniform and well-adhered SiO2 layers of ca. 100 nm thickness (dark grey), which are completely coated with homogeneous and well-anchored 100-nm thick CeO2 layers (light grey). The crystalline structure of the developed coating was studied by XRD. The diffractograms revealed peaks at interplanar distances (dhkl) of 3.1, 2.7, 1.9 and 1.6 Å, which correspond to the interplanar distances of CeO2 fcc, thus confirming that the desired CeO2 structure was formed. This characterization proves that the method developed leads to thin catalytic layers of CeO2-based catalysts and, thus, to the successful functionalization of Si micromonoliths. Taking into account that the channels measure 3.3 μm in diameter and that the catalytic coatings are 0.1-μm thick, this results in an exposed geometric area per reactor volume of 1.4·106 m2 m−3."
8,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests 3.2.1 Steam reforming tests Initially, ethanol SR tests without dilution (i.e., without adding N2 to the reactants feed) were carried out to assure the correct performance of the catalytic micromonolith. The ethanol SR tests were carried out at 923 K. The selectivity towards reforming products was 48% H2, 16% CH4, 21% CO and 5% CO2; together with less than 5% CH3CHO and C2 products, which is similar to the values reported previously [10]. Next, the steam reforming tests with the fuels described above were performed (reactions 2–6) at temperatures between 823 and 1023 K (except for acetic acid, for which the maximum reaction temperature was 973 K). For these tests, N2 was used as an internal standard, as described in Section 2.4. Fig. 3 a shows the hydrogen yield obtained for the acetic acid, acetone, isopropanol and 2-methoxyethanol SR tests for the whole range of temperatures studied. The equilibrium values corresponding to 923 K are listed in Table 2 . As seen in Fig. 3a, for the acetic acid, acetone, and isopropanol SR tests, the hydrogen yield increased as the reaction temperature increased, indicating that the H2 production was promoted at higher reaction temperatures (see also Fig. S1, Supplementary materials). A different trend was observed for the 2-methoxyethanol SR tests, for which the θ H 2 decreased at 973 K. As seen in the selectivity trend (Fig. S1), the CO concentration increased and that of CO2 decreased as the reaction temperature increased. This indicates that the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO + H2O ⇆ CO2 + H2) proceeded to a lesser extent at higher temperatures, as expected [1], resulting in a decrease of the H2 selectivity. For all temperatures, the hydrogen yield obtained with the microreformer followed the trend acetone < isopropanol < acetic acid < 2-methoxyethanol. Fig. 3b reports the selectivity towards H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and other byproducts detected described below, categorized as others, at 923 K, which is an intermediate temperature for SR tests. The selectivity for the other reaction temperatures tested is shown in Fig. S1. During the acetic acid SR tests, H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 were the only reaction products detected. At 923 K, the acetic acid SR rendered 29% H2 selectivity (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, for the acetone SR tests, mainly acetone was detected, indicating a low activity of the catalyst for the acetone SR and the other byproducts detected were C2H4 and C2H6. The H2 selectivity increased significantly during the isopropanol SR tests, up to 53% at 923 K. At this temperature, up to 23% of acetone was produced together with CO, CH4, and CO2, which suggests that along with the isopropanol SR reaction, isopropanol dehydrogenation and CO methanation were taking place as well [14,18]. These selectivity values are in line with previously reported results for Rh-based catalysts [18]. For the SR of 2-methoxyethanol at 923 K, the H2 selectivity reached 53% and concentrations below 1% of C2H4, CH3CHO and C2H6 were detected. Among the different fuels tested, the highest hydrogen yield, θ H 2 = 0.4, was attained from 2-methoxyethanol SR. Probably, the absence of CC bonds in the methoxy group facilitates the reforming process, resulting in higher H2 productions. At the end of the experiments with the different fuels reported above, a diesel surrogate SR test at 1023 K was also performed. Nevertheless, very low activity and hydrogen yield were attained (<0.01). The whole series of experiments described above represented ca. 80 h of operation. Comparing the equilibrium values reported in Table 2 and the selectivity values achieved for the different fuels tested, under the operational conditions applied in this study, the equilibrium was not reached. This is ascribed to the short contact times achieved in the microreformer, which can be remediated by stacking of microreformer units (numbering up). This is a common strategy in microreactor technology. 3.2.2 Performance comparison with conventional monoliths The best catalytic performance of the catalytic Si micromonolith, which was attained for the 2-methoxyethanol SR tests, was compared with that of conventional reactors. To that end, the hydrogen production density (hydrogen production normalized by reactor volume) per mole of 2-methoxyethanol fed [mLH2,gas/(mLfuel,liquid cm3 Reactor)] was calculated. Taking into account the volume of the micromonolith disk, the 2-methoxyethanol SR tests at 923 K, rendered an outstanding H2 production density of 110 LNH2/(mL2-methoxyethanol,liquid cm3 Reactor) at contact times of only 5.7 ms, which corresponds to a spatial velocity of 6.3·106 h−1. If the production density is multiplied by the reactor volume, a value of 0.90 LNH2/mL2-methoxyethanol,liquid is obtained. Comparing this value with that obtained for the 2-methoxyethanol SR on a 400 cells per square inch (cpsi) cordierite monolith functionalized with the same RhPd/CeO2 catalyst (T = 923 K, S/C = 3, GHSV = 102 h−1, atmospheric pressure) (results reported in [13]) a similar value of 0.99 LNH2/mL2-methoxyethanol,liquid was achieved. Remarkably, despite the three orders of magnitude difference between the dimensions of the channels of the Si micromonolith and of a conventional cordierite monolith, resulting in operational spatial velocities 4 orders of magnitude higher for the Si micromonoliths, similar H2 productions per mole of fuel fed were attained. The unique geometry of the Si micromonoliths with channels of only 3.3 μm leads to a remarkable surface-area-to-volume ratio of 1.4·106 m2 m−3 vs. 2.2·103 m2 m−3 for a 400 cpsi monolith, which allows obtaining similar hydrogen yields despite the enormous increase of the spatial velocity."
9,Characterization of the catalytic silicon micromonolith after the reaction tests,"3.3 Characterization of the catalytic silicon micromonolith after the reaction tests After the SR tests, the Si micromonolith was disassembled from the reactor housing and a cross-sectional cut was performed to investigate the catalytic coatings by SEM. Fig. 4 a shows the detail of four consecutive channels after the reaction tests. The severe reaction conditions tested during the steam reforming of the different fuels, including diesel, caused changes on the ceria coating as well as the formation of some carbonaceous deposits. Nevertheless, despite the aggressive reaction conditions applied, no channels blocked by carbon deposition nor detached CeO2 layers were detected. A detail of the inside of one microchannel is shown in Fig. 4b, where a well-developed and homogeneous CeO2 layer flawlessly anchored to the SiO2 layer is seen. To get insight into the catalyst structure after the reaction tests by HRTEM, a lamella was fabricated from the reacted microchannels with a SEM-FIB. First, the region of interest was covered with a thin Pt layer (∼200 nm) to protect it from the ion beam damage (Fig. 4d). With the FIB, ca. 80 μm-deep grooves were performed on the front and the back side of the Pt strip by milling the microchannels at different depths with Ga+ ions (current 30 kV, 10 nA) (Fig. 4d–f). Then, by finer milling (30 kV, 2 nA) an isolated and intact part was left, which was thinned down until a piece of about one microchannel thickness and four microchannels depth was obtained. Next, a micromanipulator with a tungsten tip was attached to one side of the Pt strip by Pt deposition (Fig. 4g). Subsequently, the opposite side of the Pt strip was cut and the micromanipulator attached to the isolated lamella was lifted out. The sample was then attached to a TEM sample holder by Pt deposition and the microchannels were polished until they were thin enough to be transparent to electrons (60–70 nm thickness), allowing the performance of TEM measurements (Fig. 4h). After this process, the lamella was removed from the SEM system and it was examined by TEM. HRTEM analyses revealed dispersed RhPd NPs over the CeO2 support, as seen in Fig. 5 . Remarkably, after the exposure to reforming conditions of different fuels at temperatures between 823 and 1023 K and the lamella fabrication process, most of the RhPd NPs identified were in close contact with the CeO2 support. The HRTEM images show that the NPs underwent moderate sintering, as the NP size after the reaction tests was 7 ± 2 nm (before reaction the NPs measured ca. 3 nm, see [19]) and were still alloyed. In Fig. 5a, small disseminated NPs around the sample were ascribed to Pt NPs deposited during Pt deposition carried out during the lamella fabrication process, since they are homogeneously distributed over the sample, including the CeO2 and SiO2 layers and are smaller than RhPd NPs, as they measure ca. 2 nm. Therefore, the fabrication of the lamella allowed for the characterization of catalytic layers, which constituted the active phase of a real microreactor exposed to severe working conditions (high temperature and large steam content) for ca. 80 h with stable operation."
10,Conclusions,"The feasibility and suitability of using silicon micromonoliths to generate hydrogen from the steam reforming (SR) of various fuels containing different functional groups to power portable fuel cells were investigated. The microreformer consisted of a Si micromonolith of 7 mm in diameter containing ca. 1.5·106 channels of 3.3 μm in diameter, which was successfully functionalized with a RhPd/CeO2 catalyst. The SR reaction tests proved the suitability of producing hydrogen from the SR of acetic acid, 2-propanol, and 2-methoxyethanol, and showed that the best performance was achieved with 2-methoxyethanol, where the highest hydrogen yield was recorded. Hydrogen production rates normalized by micromonolith volume of 110 LNH2/(mL2-methoxyethanol,liquid cm3 Reactor) at contact times of only 5.7 ms were reached. The three orders of magnitude increase in the geometric surface area per reactor volume in Si micromonoliths leads to production rates comparable to those obtained on conventional 400 cpsi ceramic monoliths, despite the reduction of the contact time four orders of magnitude. The advanced characterization by scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the micromonolith after reaction showed that no microchannels were blocked with carbon deposits, owing to a good performance of the RhPd/CeO2 catalyst, nor detached catalytic layers."
