0,Introduction,"There are clear economic and environmental incentives to develop heterogeneous catalysts in order to replace conventional homogeneous catalysts in many industrial processes. The aldol condensation of alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones, which is practiced industrially for the synthesis of wide range of products, is one such process [1]. Of specific interest here is the liquid-phase condensation of acetone, which is an important industrial process for the synthesis of diacetone alcohol (DAA), mesityl oxide (MO) and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) [1]. MIBK is extensively used as a solvent in paints, resins and coatings (mainly nitrocellulose, vinyl and acrylic), as well as an extracting agent in the production of antibiotics and lubricating oils [2–4]. The current annual production of MIBK is ca. 150 million pounds in the United States, ca. 120 million pounds in Europe, and ca. 80–100 million pounds in Asia [4]. The main reaction pathways for the synthesis of MIBK from acetone are given in Fig. 1 [1]. The first step is the self-condensation of acetone to diacetone alcohol (DAA, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone); the second step is the dehydration of DAA to mesityl oxide (MO, 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one); the final step is the selective hydrogenation of the carbon–carbon double bond of MO to form MIBK. The most commonly observed side reactions are over-condensations and unselective hydrogenations (also shown in Fig. 1). Many aldol condensation reactions, including acetone condensation, are practiced industrially using homogeneous aqueous-base catalysts such as sodium and calcium hydroxide. These processes generate significant wastewater streams that must be neutralized and properly disposed, adding to the production cost. Developing an active and selective heterogeneous catalyst could simplify the production process significantly, and minimize or possibly eliminate this cost. Among the solid base catalysts that are active for aldol condensation are alkali (Na2O, K2O, Cs2O) [1], alkaline earth (MgO, CaO, BaO) [5–9], transition metal oxides [10,11] and phosphates [12–15], ion-exchange resins [12,16], zeolites [17–20] and clay minerals and hydrotalcites [21–31]. The reactions of interest in Fig. 1 require a catalyst with acidic and/or basic sites, as well as hydrogenation activity. The condensation of acetone to DAA is catalyzed by either basic or acidic sites, the dehydration of DAA to MO is acid-catalyzed, and the selective hydrogenation of MO to MIBK requires metal sites [11,12,29]. There are also strong thermodynamic equilibrium limitations to the acetone condensation reaction. According to the data in Table 1 , the condensation/dehydration of acetone to MO is limited to about 20% conversion at 140°C [12], although there is no equilibrium limitation to the overall acetone-to-MIBK reaction. This, coupled with the possibility of numerous thermo-dynamically favorable side reactions that are also acid/base-catalyzed (Fig. 1), suggests that the acid/base and hydrogenation properties of the catalyst must be balanced [19,20]. Promising catalysts derived from hydrotalcite (MgAl hydroxyl-carbonate) precursors, possessing both basic and acidic properties, and dispersed noble metals (Pt or Pd) having hydrogenation activity, have been reported [24–31]. Pd and Pt catalysts have also been reported to selectively hydrogenate the CC bond of unsaturated ketones (as opposed to the CO bond) to produce saturated ketones [8,19,20,32], but no direct comparison of these metals on the same support has been reported. The objective of this research is to compare the activity and selectivity of Pt and Pd for the condensation and selective hydrogenation of acetone on hydrotalcite-derived MgAl support. The correlation between the physical and chemical properties of these catalysts and their activity and selectivity for the condensation of ketones is of particular interest for the development of more economically attractive and environmentally benign processes."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization A hydrotalcite powder (MgAl hydroxyl-carbonate, Mg/Al=1.8; LaRoche Industries Inc.) was impregnated without any prior treatment, using aqueous solutions of palladium chloride (PdCl2) or hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) to produce catalysts with nominal metal loading of 0.1, 0.7, and 1.5wt%. The catalysts were dried at 120°C for 2h, calcined at 350°C for 2h, and then crushed and sieved to particle size of 370–840μm. Prior to reaction, the samples were reduced ex situ at 450°C for 8h in flowing hydrogen [27,28]. The catalysts were characterized by various methods. Their surface area was measured by the BET method (N2 physisorption at −196°C) in a Quanta Chrome NOVA 1000 instrument. Their crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and their actual metal loading was obtained by inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP/OES). The reducibility of the dispersed Pt or Pd metal was determined by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) using a Zeton-Altamira AMI-100 catalyst characterization system. Catalyst samples of 0.05–0.1g were pretreated to 200°C in flowing Ar for 30min, then were cooled to 50°C, and were reduced under 10% H2/Ar while increasing the temperature by 10°C/min up to 600°C [27,28]. The catalyst acidity and basicity were measured by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2, respectively, using the same characterization system. Prior to the TPD tests, samples of 0.2g were reduced in situ under 10% H2/Ar at 450°C for 8h, to simulate the state of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction experiments. The samples were then treated in 10% NH3/He or 10% CO2/He at 50°C for one hour followed by purging with He. The TPD was performed by flowing He from 50 to 400°C under a heating rate of 10°C/min. The amounts of desorbed species were quantified using calibration standards [27,28]. The metal dispersion was determined by H2 and CO pulse chemisorption at 50°C. Prior to the chemisorption process, 100–200mg samples were reduced in situ under 10% H2/Ar at 450°C for 8h. The dispersion was measured from the amount of adsorbate CO or H2 (μmol/g), the metal loading (μmol metal/g), and the adsorption stoichiometry. The dissociative chemisorption of H2 on Pt (1 H2 adsorbing on 2 Pt sites, 2Pt+H2 →2Pt-H) and Pd was used for the H2-based dispersion measurements. The CO adsorption stoichiometry was based on a one-to-one adsorption complex (M+CO→MCO), which was found to agree well with the results of the H2 chemisorption measurements. The amount of exposed metal (in wt% of exposed metal) was calculated by multiplying the total metal loading by the average dispersion. A 0.1wt% Pd/SiO2 catalyst was synthesized by impregnating silica (precipitated from a NALCO 1034A solution) with an appropriate amount of aqueous PdCl2, followed by drying and calcination at 350°C."
3,Reaction system and procedure,"2.2 Reaction system and procedure The batch reactor used for the acetone condensation experiments was a high-pressure 50-ml vessel equipped with a 900-W electric heater and a micro-Robinson catalyst basket (Autoclave Engineers Inc.) with a 50-mesh opening and 8.4-ml nominal internal volume. The liquid in the reactor was stirred using a variable-speed magnedrive impeller; the stirring speed was indicated by a digital tachometer. The reactor headspace pressure was monitored with an analog pressure gauge and a pressure transducer with a digital indicator. The reactor and heater temperatures were monitored by two thermocouples. All the data from the pressure transducer, thermocouples, and the tachometer, were collected continuously by a data acquisition interface (Omega Multiscan 1200) and recorded on-line. A more detailed description of the reactor set-up for these batch reactor studies is given elsewhere [28]. A typical experiment involved loading ca. 2.7g of catalyst (reduced ex situ) into the micro-Robinson catalyst basket, which was then placed into the reactor vessel, and adding ca. 20ml of acetone. The reactor was thoroughly purged with N2 (for oxygen removal), and was then pressurized in a 25% H2–75% N2 blend to 350psig while heating to the required reaction temperature and stirring continuously at ca. 220rpm. The continuous stirring resulted in minimizing the heat and mass diffusion limitations between the bulk liquid phase (acetone and liquid products) and the catalyst particles. After reaching the desired reaction pressure of 350psig (typically in 30min), the N2 feed was closed, while the H2 feed was kept open and the reaction pressure was increased to 400psig. The excess hydrogen was added to compensate for any loss in pressure attributed to the consumption of H2 by the hydrogenation of MO to MIBK or the hydrogenation of acetone to isopropanol (IPA). The experiment was typically carried out for 5h under these conditions. Then the reactor was cooled down and the liquid sample was collected and analyzed. Analysis of the liquid product was performed in a GC-FID (HP 6890) with a capillary column (HP-1 methyl siloxane), using methanol as internal standard [27,28]. Conversion and selectivity were calculated based on carbon atoms, using the analysis of the liquid products and the initial mass of acetone in the reactor: conversion = ( moles acetone ) initial − ( moles acetone ) final ( moles acetone ) initial selectivity to species i = ( moles acetone to form species i ) final ( moles acetone converted ) The analysis also included a carbon balance (feed carbon–outlet carbon) to account for a potential loss of acetone by evaporation (all reaction products have much lower volatility than acetone). For all the results reported here the carbon balance was within 5%."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of the catalysts after calcination at 350°C indicated the transformation of the parent hydrotalcite into MgAl mixed oxide (Mg1.8x Al x O y ), in good agreement with the literature [25,29]. Thus, under reaction conditions the catalysts are based on the mixed oxide rather than the hydrotalcite structure. The nomenclature Pt/HT and Pd/HT used in this article simply indicates the origin of the MgAl mixed oxide support. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts are given in Table 2 . The BET surface area of the Pd/HT and Pt/HT samples was found to be substantially lower than that of the parent HT, which is likely due to the removal or substitution of the stabilizing ions of the HT structure during impregnation (as H2O and CO2). The acidity of the metal-containing catalysts, as estimated by NH3 desorption (Table 2), increased moderately in all cases compared to the HT support. On the other hand, their basicity, which was evaluated by CO2 desorption (Table 2), decreased significantly, between half and one fifth of the value of the parent sample. This is apparently linked to the presence of residual amounts of chloride species in these catalyst samples (from the aqueous impregnation with PdCl2 and H2PtCl6), which would be expected to become more prominent for the higher-loading catalysts [28]. Fig. 2 shows the CO2 TPD curves of the parent HT and the 0.1 and 1.5wt% Pd/HT catalysts, which show the basicity of these samples [27]. The CO2 TPD profile of the parent HT (after calcination at 350°C) shows two desorption peaks, one at ca. 100°C, and another at ca. 235°C, corresponding to weakly- and strongly-basic sites, respectively. The CO2 desorption profiles of the 0.1 and 1.5wt% Pd/HT catalysts show smaller low-temperature desorption peaks compared to the parent HT, which become smaller with increasing metal loading. These low-T peaks correspond to desorption of previously adsorbed CO2 only and not of any water, since these samples were heat-treated in situ at elevated temperatures (450°C) prior to the TPD experiment. The high-T desorption peak of 0.1wt% Pd/HT is much smaller than that of the parent HT sample, with virtually no high-T peak for the 1.5wt% Pd/HT, indicating that neither of these catalysts possesses strong basicity. The CO2 TPD curves of the 0.1 and 1.5wt% Pt/HT catalysts (shown in [27]) are very similar to those of the Pd/HT samples, thus the above observations are applicable for both the Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts. Therefore, the impregnation process appears to result in a significant loss in the strong basicity of the parent support. The NH3 TPD profiles of the parent and the 0.1 and 1.5wt% Pd/HT catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . In contrast to basicity, there are only minor differences in the acidity (as measured by NH3 desorption) of the HT and the Pd/HT catalysts. There is a small but measurable increase in the strong acidity for both Pd/HT samples (desorption peak at T >150°C). The same observations are applicable for the corresponding Pt/HT catalysts (results not shown). Thus, both the Pd/HT and Pt/HT possess acidity comparable to that of the parent HT material."
6,Reaction experiments,"3.2 Reaction experiments A series of preliminary tests was performed using the 0.7wt% Pd/HT catalyst, in which various H2:N2 mixtures (100, 75, 50, and 25% H2) were fed into the reactor. The purpose of this study was to find conditions that would allow studying both the aldol condensation reactions (which do not require hydrogen) and the selective hydrogenation of MO to MIBK. A variation in reactant feed composition during the initial pressurization of the reactor affected the measured activity and selectivity significantly. Early exposure to H2 promoted the direct hydrogenation of acetone to isopropanol (IPA). On the other hand, prolonged exposure to H2 after the initial pressurization step (i.e., after some acetone condensation to MO had occurred) resulted in significant improvement in both acetone conversion and selectivity to MIBK. The results of this preliminary study identified a standard reaction procedure (described in Section 2.2) for all the subsequent experiments presented in this article. Table 3 shows the acetone conversion (activity) and product distribution (selectivity) of the Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts using the experimental procedure described above. There was only limited acetone conversion in the absence of catalyst; acetone was only hydrogenated to IPA, since there were no acid/base sites to catalyze the aldol condensation reaction [11,12]. The parent (calcined, non-metal-containing) HT catalyzed the condensation of acetone to DAA and the subsequent dehydration of DAA to MO. The observed catalyst activity was consistent with its acidity and basicity as measured by CO2 and NH3 TPD (Figs. 2 and 3). The conversion of acetone corresponded to the equilibrium conversion at these conditions (Table 1). Only minimal amounts of MIBK (and no IPA) were produced, clearly due to the absence of hydrogenation sites. The measured selectivity to MO was ca. 85%, and no other higher-condensation products were detected. All the Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts showed higher acetone conversion and selectivity to MIBK than the parent HT support, as expected. The formation of MIBK shifts the equilibrium-limited acetone-to-MO condensation reaction to the right (Table 1). DAA was present in all runs, but MO was not detected in any experiment, suggesting that the rate of the selective hydrogenation of MO to MIBK is fast. It is interesting that no methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC, formed by the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group in MIBK, as seen in Fig. 1) was detected in any of these runs. In addition, the selectivity to undesirable over-condensation products (dimethyl heptanone, DMH, di-isobutyl ketone, DIBK, and hexylene glycol, HGL in Table 3) was less than 2% in all runs. This differs from the results of others. For example, Mattos et al. found selectivity to over-condensation products of ∼9% on Pt/X zeolite at conditions where MIBK selectivity was comparable to those in Table 3 [20]. However, the acetone conversions in that case were less than 10%, compared to 30–38% in Table 3. High selectivity to these undesired products was also found on Pt/HZSM5 in studies carried out at atmospheric pressure [19]. Martinez-Ortiz et al. found >25% selectivity to over-condensation products (primarily DIBK) at 35% acetone conversion on a 0.3% Pd/HT co-precipitated catalyst [30]; again, this is much higher selectivity to over-condensation products than that observed here. Unlike most previous studies, the main by-product here was isopropanol (IPA), formed by the direct hydrogenation of acetone (Fig. 1). Only minor amounts (less than 2%) of higher-molecular-weight products (such as DMH and DIBK) were formed from further condensation of acetone with MIBK. Therefore, both Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts selectively hydrogenated the CC bond in MO, rather than the CO bond. Although both Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts gave acetone conversions in the same range (28–38%), the 0.1wt% Pd/HT sample had the highest conversion (38%), and an unusually low selectivity to IPA (0.6%, compared to 14.7% for the next best catalyst). This catalyst also showed the highest selectivity to MIBK (82%), and thus the maximum MIBK yield (31%). In contrast, the 0.1wt% Pt/HT catalyst gave an IPA selectivity of 33% at 34% conversion."
7,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature A series of runs at varying reaction temperatures (from 99 to 153°C) was performed using the most active and selective catalyst, 0.1wt% Pd/HT. Fig. 4 shows that the conversion of acetone increased monotonically with reaction temperature, whereas the MIBK selectivity decreased drastically at elevated temperatures (ca. 150°C), due to enhanced formation of over-condensation by-products [28]. Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) indicated that the major by-product (selectivity of 45%) at 153°C was isophorone (3,5,5-trimethyl 2-cyclohexenone) and its hydrogenated counterpart (3,5,5-trimethyl 2-cyclohexanone). Thus, higher temperatures favor the over-condensation of acetone to its trimers (mainly cyclic C9 species) and suppress the selectivity for hydrogenation reactions (to MIBK as well as to IPA)."
8,Effect of acid/base and metal site concentration,"3.4 Effect of acid/base and metal site concentration The activity and selectivity data of Table 3 indicate that both the Pd/HT and Pt/HT series showed a consistent decrease in acetone conversion as well as selectivity to DAA (condensation product) and MIBK (condensation+hydrogenation product) with increasing metal loading. This was coupled with a significant increase in selectivity to IPA (hydrogenation product). The higher Pd or Pt loadings favor the direct hydrogenation reaction, which takes place in parallel with the condensation reaction sequence leading to MIBK (Fig. 1), thus decreasing the selectivity to MIBK. In addition, the hydrogenation of MO to MIBK was complete in all cases (even on the lowest metal loading samples), since essentially no MO was detected in the reaction products. This indicates that the hydrogenation of MO was not the slow (rate-determining) step in the formation of MIBK under the given experimental conditions. Therefore, a minimal metal site concentration is sufficient to fully hydrogenate MO to MIBK while apparently minimizing the undesirable formation of IPA. The selectivity of Pt/HT to IPA was greater than that of Pd/HT at each of the three metal loadings (Table 3). The extremely low IPA selectivity of the 0.1wt% Pd/HT suggests that this catalyst had an optimal balance of hydrogenation and acid/base properties, within the limits of this study. This suggests the importance of a balance between the acid/base-catalyzed acetone condensation and the hydrogenation activity of the Pd metal, as noted by others [19,20]. On this catalyst, acetone was not hydrogenated to IPA, but selectively formed MIBK, with DAA being the main condensation intermediate. A more acidic support, which could increase the rate of the dehydration of DAA to MO, would possibly increase both the acetone conversion and the MIBK yield. The presence of DMH, however, suggests that there are limits to the benefits of greater acidity, since this compound is formed by condensation of MO with acetone and the subsequent dehydration reaction, which is also acid-catalyzed. The concentration of metal sites has so far been expressed in terms of wt% metal loading, without taking into consideration possible differences in metal dispersion. Measurements of metal dispersion on the Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts by CO and H2 pulse chemisorption provide insight into the relationship between MIBK yield and the amount of exposed metal sites. The results of the CO and H2 pulse chemisorption are given in Table 4 . The HT support gave no measurable CO adsorption at 50°C, thus the adsorption of CO on the metal/HT samples was due to the presence of the metal itself. As expected, higher Pd and Pt metal loading resulted in lower dispersions. Still, the net exposed metal surface increased with increasing metal loading. [The dispersions of the 1.5wt% Pd/HT and 1.5wt% Pt/HT samples were measured using both pure CO and 10% CO in He, to see if these methods gave the same results. The results (Table 4) show essentially the same dispersion (∼10% variation).] The dispersion of samples that were reduced in situ twice was the same that of the samples reduced once (one reduction was the typical procedure). This shows that reduction (beyond 8h) of a sample at 450°C does not affect the physical state of the metal (Pd or Pt). The dispersion of used samples recovered after acetone condensation and hydrogenation at 118°C for 5.5h was similar to that of the fresh samples (∼10% variation, results not shown). This shows that the physical state of Pd and Pt on the Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts was not affected by the acetone condensation and hydrogenation reaction under the given conditions. A comparison between the two series of catalysts (Pd/HT and Pt/HT) in terms of the yield of MIBK and IPA as a function of the amount of exposed metal is presented in Fig. 5 . The MIBK yield of the Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts converged into a common curve (also plotted in Fig. 5) within the range of exposed metal sites examined here. However, the absence of a very low (less than 0.03wt% exposed metal) metal-amount Pt/HT sample prohibited direct comparison between the two catalyst types at the more promising low exposed metal range. The x-axis error-bars of Fig. 5 correspond to variations in replicate measured metal dispersions, which are also indicated in the last column of Table 4. These metal dispersion uncertainties did not affect the observed trends for Pt/HT and Pd/HT of Fig. 5. The lowest exposed-metal-loading catalyst (0.012wt% exposed Pd; i.e., 0.1wt% Pd/HT with a dispersion of 9%; Table 4) gave the highest MIBK yield. The MIBK yield appeared to be essentially independent of the type of metal (in the range where yield is measured for both Pd and Pt). The 0.1wt% Pd/HT catalyst was superior among the catalysts tested in terms of the produced yield of MIBK. Fig. 5 and Table 4 show that for all other catalysts, IPA was a significant by-product. Furthermore, at comparable exposed metal loading (0.048wt% for the Pd/HT and 0.034wt% for the Pt/HT), the IPA yield of Pd/HT was significantly lower than that of Pt/HT, suggesting that Pd has a lower activity than Pt for the undesirable hydrogenation of acetone to IPA. It is interesting that the yield of MIBK is essentially independent of the type of metal (Pd versus Pt), and decreases with increasing wt% exposed metal sites, whereas the yield of IPA depends strongly on the metal type (Pt>Pd) and increases with increasing amount of exposed metal. In addition, the overall acetone conversion decreases with increasing concentration of metal sites, as a simple inspection of the results of Tables 3 and 4 shows. These observations appear to contradict the hypothesis that the selectivity and yield of MIBK decrease with increasing metal loading because of (and not simply in parallel to) an increase in selectivity and yield of IPA. The results of this study indicate that the formation of MIBK depends on the activity for condensation of acetone to MO (the subsequent hydrogenation of MO to MIBK is very fast and becomes complete in the presence of a very small concentration of metal sites). The acetone→DAA→MO reaction is related to the concentration of acid and basic sites, which are properties of the support. The Pd/HT and Pt/HT catalysts had similar or greater acidity (acid site concentration) compared to the parent HT (Table 2 and Fig. 3). However, their basicity (concentration of basic sites) was lesser than that of the parent HT, and decreases with increasing metal loading for both of the two catalyst series, Pd and Pt (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The MIBK yield of the Pd/HT and Pt/HT samples is plotted as a function of the basicity of both catalysts in Fig. 6 . Although there are only two pairs of data points to support this correlation, the observation is clear: the MIBK yield is directly related to the basicity of the supported-metal catalyst. It also appears to be essentially independent of the type of metal (Pd versus Pt). The results suggest that the high MIBK yield of the 0.1wt% Pd/HT is primarily due to its higher basicity, and secondarily to its minimal concentration of metal sites. An obvious consequence of this theory is that an optimum catalyst for the acetone condensation to MIBK must possess an optimum concentration of both acidic and basic sites. Catalysts with very high acidity and/or basicity would tend to form over-condensation products, thus limiting the maximum obtainable MIBK yield. Under the reaction conditions examined, a metal loading of 0.1wt% or less is sufficient to fully hydrogenate any produced MO to MIBK, as well as to minimize any undesirable direct hydrogenation of acetone to IPA."
9,Effect of acid/base and hydrogenation site proximity,"3.5 Effect of acid/base and hydrogenation site proximity Despite numerous literature references on the contribution of acid/base and metal sites toward high MIBK yields [12,19,20], no systematic study has been reported on the possible requirement for proximity between these types of sites on the catalyst surface. The effect of physically separating the acid/base and metal sites on the MIBK yield was examined by testing a physical mixture of HT (active for condensation reactions only) and a catalyst with primarily hydrogenation sites, such as Pd/SiO2. Results (not shown) indicated that Pd/SiO2 alone (with no added HT) gave very low activity (acetone conversion of 5.4%), with ∼75mol% IPA and ∼25mol% DAA as the only reaction products. The limited but measurable formation of DAA can be attributed to the weak acid/base properties of SiOH groups of the support. Thus this catalyst can have only minimal contribution in a physical-mixture catalyst for acetone condensation. Two 1:1 by weight physical mixtures of Pd/SiO2 +HT were prepared, pretreated (using the standard reduction procedure) and tested for the condensation of acetone to MIBK under typical reaction conditions. One physical mixture was a 0.1wt% Pd/SiO2 +HT sample, where the hydrogenation (from Pd) and acid/base (from the HT) sites were present but physically separated. The second physical mixture was a 0.1wt% Pd/HT+silica sample, with the two site types microscopically adjacent. These two physical mixtures contained the same amount of metal sites (0.065wt%) and comparable amounts of acid+base sites (490+225μmol/g and 675+156μmol/g, respectively). Thus, they could reasonably be compared in terms of their activity for MIBK formation. Fig. 7 presents the product yields for the two physical mixtures, as well as that of the Pd/SiO2 sample (essentially serving as “baseline”) and of the 0.1wt% Pd/HT sample (from the conversion and selectivity data of Table 3) for comparison purposes. The two physical mixtures produced quantitatively similar product distributions, with MIBK yield of 15% versus 18% and DAA yield of 4% versus 5%, respectively. These results suggest that there was little effect of acid/base and metal site proximity for this catalyst. However, the small but measurable MO remaining in the case of the first mixture (with distant sites) suggests that the effect of site proximity was not negligible. This first mixture appeared to exhibit a somewhat lower hydrogenation activity than that required for complete hydrogenation of MO to MIBK. If the residual MO formed by the 0.1wt% Pd/SiO2 +HT mixture had been hydrogenated to MIBK, the MIBK yield would have been essentially identical to that of the 0.1wt% Pd/HT+SiO2 mixture. It is also interesting to note that the two physical mixtures gave MIBK yields that were about half of that of the 0.1wt% Pd/HT. This result should be expected since these physical mixtures possessed approximately half the concentration of acid/base sites of the 0.1wt% Pd/HT sample. The similar MIBK yields of the two mixtures were not exactly proportional to their basicity alone (225 and 156μmol/g, respectively), nor to acidity+basicity (715 and 830μmol/g, respectively). The slow (rate determining) step in the formation of MIBK appears to be the acid/base catalyzed condensation of acetone to DAA; however, the present results are not adequate to resolve the relative contribution of these two site types to this reaction."
10,Conclusions,"Palladium- and platinum-supported hydrotalcite-derived MgAl mixed-oxide catalysts are quite promising for the single-step aldol condensation and selective hydrogenation of acetone to MIBK. Increasing the reaction temperature from ca. 100 to 150°C results in higher acetone conversions, but shifts the product distribution towards undesirable over-condensation products (mainly C9 cyclic species). As a result, the selectivity and yield of MIBK show a maximum with reaction temperature, and are severely limited at elevated temperatures. The net yield of MIBK can be correlated to the concentration of acid and basic sites of the supported-metal catalyst, whereas it appears to be essentially independent of the type of metal (Pd versus Pt). Among the examined Pd- and Pt-based catalysts the 0.1wt% Pd/HT is superior in maximizing the MIBK yield mainly due to its higher basicity, and (to a lesser extent) due to its minimal concentration of metal sites. This metal loading is sufficient to fully hydrogenate mesityl oxide to MIBK, and it also gives minimal acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol. The superior catalyst for the condensation of acetone to MIBK must possess an optimum concentration of both acid and basic sites. Catalysts with very high acidity and/or basicity would tend to form over-condensation products, thus limiting the maximum obtainable MIBK yield. The acid/base and metal sites needed for the condensation and hydrogenation steps of the acetone condensation to MIBK do not have to be molecularly adjacent, however, their combined presence is required for the formation of MIBK."
