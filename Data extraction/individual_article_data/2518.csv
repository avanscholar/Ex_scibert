0,Introduction,"Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) has been identified as a promising technology with which a large-scale hydrogen economy can be established [1–6]. In UHS, large amounts of hydrogen gas (H2) can be effectively stored in geological formations (e.g. empty salt caverns [1,2,7], deep aquifers [8,9], depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, or underground coal seams [10–12]) rapidly and safely. Storage times can range from months to years, depending on the specific energy demands [1,6]. Previously, salt caverns were demonstrated to be feasible UHS storage sites, while UHS in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, coal beds or deep aquifers is still under investigation [6], despite the fact that such sedimentary reservoirs are abundant and geographically widespread [13]. One key aspect of assessing the feasibility of such sedimentary reservoirs (note that these reservoirs typically have siliciclastic, carbonatic or maceral origins, and they are thus porous [13]) for UHS is the behaviour of H2 in the pore network of the storage rock at true storage conditions (i.e. high pressure and elevated temperature). These pore-scale effects determine the associated multi-phase reservoir fluid dynamics (note that H2 and formation brine co-exist in the pore space, and can in principle flow simultaneously as brine is always present in such porous formations [14]). Therefore, containment security, storage capacity and potential H2 injection and withdrawal rates are determined by such pore-scale effects [15]. However, a critical review of these pore-scale phenomena and how they are associated with UHS at large scale is currently lacking. Therefore, herein, pore-scale UHS processes are critically reviewed, and their reservoir-scale effects are discussed. Furthermore, major differences between UHS, CO2 geo-storage (CGS) and natural gas storage are highlighted, and future research directions are outlined. This review will therefore advance the fundamental technical understanding of UHS, provide guidance for UHS project operations at large scale, encourage climate change mitigation researchers to focus more on UHS studies, and provide an overview of the current state of the art. This review is also written to act as an entry point for new researchers in this area."
1,Multi-scale parameters relevant in underground hydrogen storage,"In this section, multi-scale parameters which influence UHS are systematically reviewed. These parameters are categorized here into solid properties, fluid properties and solid-fluid interactions, Fig. 1 ."
2,Solid properties,"2.1 Solid properties In a specific UHS project, the first step is to select a suitable geological site. The solid properties of the storage medium are therefore crucial factors which influence UHS storage capacity, storage effectiveness, and containment security. Relevant solid properties include absolute permeability (k a ), effective porosity (∅effective) and effective stress (σ effective ), Fig. 1. These parameters are discussed in detail below. 2.1.1 Absolute permeability Absolute permeability (k a ) is the ability of a porous medium to transmit fluid (when the porous medium is 100% saturated by this fluid) [14]. Note that k a is an intrinsic property of the porous medium (i.e. solid-fluid interactions or fluid properties do not influence k a [16,17]). In typical (laminar) subsurface flow, Darcy's law applies, thus (1) Q = k a A ∆ P μ ∆ L where Q is the volumetric flow rate, A is the cross-sectional area available for the fluid flux, ∆P is the pressure differential and ∆L is the physical distance between the injection and withdrawal well, and μ is the fluid viscosity. Consequently, it is more energy-efficient to inject H2 into (or recover H2 from) highly permeable storage sites [15]. Note that σ effective is defined as the difference between overburden pressure and pore pressure [18–21]. Clearly k a decreases with σ effective for all rocks (loading cycles), while k a increases again when σ effective is released (unloading cycles), Fig. 2(a). The k a response to σ effective is particularly large for limestone, coal and shale as these reservoirs are typically fractured [19–21,23,24]. For example, k a for coal decreased from 5.5 × 106 nD to 1.5 × 106 nD when σ effective increased from 4 MPa to 7.5 MPa; k a increased again from 10.5 × 105 nD to 2.5 × 106 nD when σ effective decreased from 10.5 MPa to 4 MPa. In UHS, H2 injection corresponds to the unloading cycle, while H2 withdrawal corresponds to the loading cycle. Thus, k a will increase during H2 injection, but decrease during H2 withdrawal. It is therefore necessary to characterize the effect of σ effective on k a at in-situ reservoir conditions, prior to larger-scale UHS operations - to enable accurate reservoir-scale predictions. In addition, k a is much larger in sandstone and limestone than in shale or coal matrix [25]. It can therefore be expected that H2 injection is more energy-efficient in sandstone and limestone reservoirs. 2.1.2 Effective porosity Absolute porosity is the ratio of the total pore volume to the bulk volume of the rock [14]. However, disconnected and dead end pores do not contribute to H2 flow; thus effective porosity (ϕ effective , which is defined as the ratio of the connected pore volume to the bulk volume) determines the maximum H2 storage capacity (C) at reservoir scale, (2) C = L × W × T × ϕ effective × S H 2 where L, W, and T are the formation length, width and thickness, respectively; and S H2 is the H2 saturation (i.e. the pore volume filled with H2 divided by the total pore volume). Note that generally saturation (S) is defined as the ratio of the specific fluid volume in pore space to total pore volume [14]. Clearly, C is proportional to ϕ effective . ϕ effective is much larger in conventional rocks (e.g. sandstone and limestone) than in unconventional rocks (e.g. shale and coal) [26]. Thus, C is expected to be much larger in conventional reservoirs. Moreover, ϕ effective is typically measured via helium pycnometry in conventional rocks, while measuring ϕ effective reliably is considerably more complex in unconventional rocks such as shale [[29]] and coal [30,31], which creates uncertainty in terms of UHS predictions in unconventional reservoirs. Note that ϕ effective also slightly depends on σ effective [19,32], Fig. 2(b). Similar to k a , ϕ effective also decreases with σ effective in the loading cycle, while it increases again in the unloading cycle; however, the response to σ effective is generally smaller for ϕ effective than for k a [21,22]. Consequently, it is suggested that the effect of σ effective on ϕ effective at reservoir conditions should be evaluated as well, prior to any large-scale UHS operations."
3,Fluid properties,"2.2 Fluid properties Fluid properties are also key parameters which strongly influence UHS effectiveness and safety (compare Fig. 1). In this section, fluid properties including density, viscosity, fluid-fluid interfacial tension, solubility and diffusivity, are reviewed in detail. 2.2.1 Fluid density Pressure and temperature increase with formation depth due to the geothermal and hydrostatic gradients [33,34]. It is thus important to examine the effects of pressure and temperature on fluid density (ρ) [14,35]. Clearly, H2 density (ρ H 2 ) drastically increases with pressure and decrease slightly with temperature (as expected) Fig. 3 . For example, at 298 K, ρ H 2 increased from 0.5 kg/m3 to 12 kg/m3 when pressure increased from 0.6 MPa to 16 MPa, while at 30 MPa, ρ H 2 decreased from 20 kg/m3 to 16 kg/m3 when temperature increased from 313 K to 373 K. Compare this with CH4 density (ρ CH 4 ) and CO2 density (ρ CO 2 ), which increased from 0.6 kg/m3 to 135.67 kg/m3 (CH4) and from 1.6 kg/m3 to 784.29 kg/m3 (CO2), respectively, when pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 20 MPa at 323 K [35]. Thus, it is concluded that ρ H 2 is less sensitive to pressure and temperature effects than ρ CH 4 and ρ CO 2 , and that ρ H 2 is generally very low even at high pressures. Furthermore, ρ H2 is significantly smaller than H2O density (ρ H2O ) at the same thermo-physical conditions (compare Fig. 3 (b)). As a result, this large H2-brine density difference will lead to strong gravity segregation [42–46] and more rapid H2-upward movement - when compared with CH4 or CO2. This causes a serious risk for H2 leakage to the surface, thus it is vital to ensure caprock integrity, this is further discussed below. 2.2.2 Fluid viscosity Fluid viscosity (μ, defined as the ratio of shear stress between adjacent fluid layers and velocity gradient in the normal direction) quantifies the ability of a fluid to flow [14]; μ is thus a vital parameter for H2 injection and withdrawal. Furthermore, fluid viscosity ratio, particularly in combination with relative permeability ratio (= mobility ratio), see below, determines fluid-fluid interfacial stability and viscous fingering [47–49]. During H2 injection, viscous fingering could lead to early H2-surface leakage, low H2 sweep efficiency, and other fundamental problems [15]. This is discussed in more detail below in section 2.3.5. H2 viscosity is slightly influenced by temperature and pressure, Fig. 4(a) and (b). For example, at 20 MPa, μ H2 increased slightly from 9.6 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s to 10.7 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s when temperature increased from 313 K to 373 K [38]; while at 373 K, μ H2 slightly increased from 10.4 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s to 11.8 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s when pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 50 MPa [38]. These experimental data are almost quantitatively consistent with theoretical calculations [50]. In contrast, μ CH4 increased from 13.6 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s to 26 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s when pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 48 MPa at 373 K. μ CH4 is therefore similar to μ H2 at low pressures, but more than twice as high as μ H2 at high pressures. μ CO2, however, increased much more with increasing pressure – e.g. from 15.1 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s to 138.6 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s when pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 48 MPa (at 298 K) – and decreasing temperature – e.g. from 52 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s to 112.1 × 10−3 mPa ∙ s when temperature decreased from 373 K to 298 K (at 30 MPa). μ CO2 is therefore more than ten times higher than μ H2 at high pressures, while it is still similar to μ H2 at low pressures. This is related to the density characteristics of the gases (see section 2.2.1), as denser gases have stronger collision and friction between the gas molecules, which leads to increased viscosity [51,52]. Further, increasing temperature reduces the friction between molecules, thus viscosity decreases with increasing temperature [52]. More importantly, μ H 2 is approximately one to two magnitudes smaller than μ H 2 O (at the same thermo-physical conditions, see Fig. 4(a)). Consequently, H2 viscous fingering can be expected in the H2 injection stage [53], which is discussed in more detail below (section 2.3.5). 2.2.3 Fluid-fluid interfacial tension Immiscible fluids are separated by a phase boundary; the nature of this boundary is determined by the type of molecules on each side of the boundary and the associated intermolecular interactions between the molecules [54]. One key property of this boundary is the interfacial tension between these two phases (γ FF ). γ FF quantifies how much energy is required to produce additional boundary (surface) area [54]. γ FF is also an important parameter in the context of fluid-rock interactions, as it determines capillary pressures (P C ) [14] and it is related to the fluid-fluid miscibility [55,56] (see also below). γ FF is a function of pressure, temperature and fluid composition, e.g. [57,58]; related experimental data for gas-H2O systems is illustrated in Fig. 5 [59]. H2-H2O interfacial tension (γ H2−H2O ) is almost independent of pressure, but γ H2−H2O decreases strongly with increasing temperature, Fig. 5. For instance, at 323 K, γ H2−H2O decreased only from 70 mN/m to 67 mN/m when pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 40 MPa; at 10 MPa, γ H2−H2O decreased from 72 mN/m to 44 mN/m when temperature increased from 298 K to 448 K, Fig. 5 [59]. This behaviour is quasi opposite to that of CO2 and CH4. CO2-H2O interfacial tension (γ CO2−H2O ) strongly decreases with pressure, but only slightly increases with temperature [57,58]; while CH4-H2O interfacial tension (γ CH4−H2O ) decreases with both pressure and temperature. For example, at 323 K, when pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 25 MPa, γ CO2−H2O and γ CH4−H2O decreased from 68 mN/m to 23 mN/m and from 67 mN/m to 54 mN/m, respectively; also at 10 MPa, when temperature increased from 300 K to 353 K, γ CO2−H2O only increased from 25 mN/m to 28 mN/m and γ CH4−H2O only decreased from 64 mN/m to 61 mN/m. These relations are again determined by gas density and intermolecular forces [57]. γ H 2−H 2 O was also estimated by fitting H2-water-sandstone coreflood data (measured at 5.5 MPa and 293 K; and 10 MPa and 318 K) with associated mercury injection capillary pressure data [60]. However, the estimated γ H 2−H 2 O values (51 mN/m at 5.5 MPa and 293 K; and 46 mN/m at 10 MPa and 318 K) were significantly lower than the directly measured values (approximately 72 mN/m at 5.5 MPa and 293 K; 70 mN/m at 10 MPa and 318 K [59]). This large discrepancy between the estimated and the directly measured results could be caused by the well-known systematic errors associated with the conversion of such mercury data [61–64], which raises increasing doubt regarding such data extrapolation. 2.2.4 Hydrogen solubility H2 solubility in formation brine or formation oil also needs to be assessed as this is potentially a significant hydrogen sink, which would lead to detrimental H2 loss. Note that such gas dissolution (“dissolution trapping”) has gained significant prominence in the context of CGS, where it is a key CO2 disposal mechanism (e.g. [65–67]). Clearly, H2 solubility in H2O was much smaller at ambient conditions than at UHS conditions, Fig. 6(a). For example, at 319 K and 0.678 MPa, H2 solubility in H2O was 0.0000856 (mole fraction); while at 323 K and 7.9 MPa, H2 solubility in H2O was 0.00103, compare also [65,67,68]. H2-solubility values measured at ambient conditions can therefore not be used in UHS planning. Further, at UHS conditions, H2 solubility in brine is a strong function of pressure, temperature and salinity, Fig. 6(a) – (c). Specifically, at 372 K, H2 solubility in 3 mol/kg NaCl increased from 0.0000215 to 0.001549 (mole fraction) when pressure increased from 3.3 MPa to 23 MPa, Fig. 6(a); at 10.1 MPa, H2 solubility in 3 mol/kg NaCl brine increased from 0.000631 to 0.000702 when temperature increased from 323 K to 372 K, Fig. 6(b); and at 323 K and 15.1 MPa, H2 solubility decreased from 0.000938 to 0.000662 when NaCl salinity increased from 3 mol/kg to 5 mol/kg, Fig. 6(c). H2 solubility in oleic and other non-aqueous liquids (including pure hydrocarbons [71], heavy oil [72], alcohols [73], white oil [74], diesel [68] and some other solvents [75]) increased with pressure and temperature, qualitatively consistent with H2 solubility in brine [69]. However, the absolute H2 solubility in these non-aqueous liquids was approximately one magnitude larger than H2 solubility in aqueous liquids (e.g. at 3.3 MPa and 373 K, H2 solubility was 0.0269 in diesel, but only 0.000215 in 3 mol/kg NaCl brine, compare Figs. 6(a) and (d)). Therefore, H2 loss due to dissolution trapping is expected to be much more serious in depleted oil reservoirs than in aquifers. Further, it is useful to quantify and compare Henry constant using Henry's Law, C = kP (where C is the concentration of the dissolved gas, k is the Henry constant, and P is the partial pressure above the liquid). However, in the literature, the partial pressure is not well reported. This has caused limitations to determine Henry constant accurately. 2.2.5 Hydrogen diffusivity H2 diffusivity (D H 2 ) increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure strongly, Fig. 7 . For example, at 25 MPa, D H 2 (in water) increased from 14.4 × 10−8 m2/s to 218.8 × 10−8 m2/s when temperature increased from 650 K to 973 K [76], Fig. 7(a) (Physically, temperature influences molecular momentum, Brownian motion and intermolecular forces, and thus also diffusivity [52]); while at 323 K, D H 2 (in C4H10) decreased from 1440 × 10−8 m2/s to 250 × 10−8 m2/s when pressure increased from 0.35 MPa to 2.1 MPa, [77], Fig. 7(b). Further, D H 2 in hydrocarbons decreased with carbon number, e.g. at 323 K and 2.1 MPa, D H 2 was 430 × 10−8 m2/s, 320 × 10−8 m2/s, 270 × 10−8 m2/s, and 250 × 10−8 m2/s respectively, in CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and n-C4H10 [77], Fig. 7(b). It will be very instructive to relate diffusivity to viscosity using the Einstein relationship, D = k B T 6 πμr , (where D is the diffusion coefficient, μ is the viscosity, k B is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and r is the radius of the spherical particle.) However, there is no available dataset in the literature, where H2 viscosity and diffusivity are reported for the same thermo-physical conditions (Compare Figs. 4 and 7). This has caused limitations to use the Einstein relationship herein. These data indicate that H2 loss due to H2 diffusion could be significant in deep aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. It has been estimated by a numerical reservoir simulation that 1% H2 is lost after 15 years (in a 7 m high reservoir with 20% porosity), due to H2 diffusion into the aquifer [15]. However, experimental data for H2 diffusion coefficients in aqueous and non-aqueous liquids at reservoir conditions is still scarce and should be investigated further."
4,Solid-fluid interactions,"2.3 Solid-fluid interactions Solid-fluid interactions determine fluid distribution [78], fluid migration [79], gas adsorption [80], chemical reactions and reactive transport [81]. Solid-fluid interactions include H2-rock-brine wettability, solid-fluid interfacial tension (γ SF ), capillary pressure (P c ), relative permeability (k r ), and mobility ratio (M), Fig. 1. Such interactions can potentially influence UHS to significant extents, indeed it is well established that P c and k r are highly significant in two-phase flow (e.g. [14]), these parameters are thus here reviewed critically in detail. 2.3.1 Wettability Wettability is the relative affinity of one liquid to a solid surface in the presence of another immiscible (or partially miscible) fluid [82,83]. As mentioned, once injected, H2 coexists with reservoir brine in the pore network of the storage rock (note that this has been directly imaged with x-ray micro-computed tomography in the case of CGS, e.g. see [84–86]). H2-rock wettability is heterogeneously distributed in the subsurface because of the heterogenous rock surface chemistry, mineral composition and pore geometry [87–89]; these H2 configurations - summed over the whole reservoir - are quasi the expression of the rock's wettability. This H2-rock wettability is of key importance as it determines C, P C , S H2, S H2, r (residual H2 saturation), injectivity, and containment security [33,58,67,90–92], thus, it is necessary to characterize wettability accurately. However, so far, only one paper experimentally measured H2 wettability at in-situ sandstone aquifer reservoir conditions via video contact angle (θ) measurements [93], Fig. 8 . Specifically, under realistic UHS conditions (i.e. 15 MPa and 323 K), for quartz aged in 10−2 mol/L stearic acid (note that such small organic concentrations are realistic in deep aquifers due to the prevailing reducing conditions [94,95]), water advancing and receding θ were 68° and 64°, respectively, indicating a weakly water-wet state, Fig. 8(b). Note that in UHS scenarios, water receding θ corresponds to H2 injection into the subsurface reservoir, while water advancing θ relates to H2 withdrawal, when water encroaches again into the reservoir [93]. Further, θ increased strongly with pressure, temperature and stearic acid concentration. Physically, changes in pressure and/or temperature will influence gas density and intermolecular forces between gas and rock, and thus also contact angle [35,96]. However, the θ values (22° at 5.5 MPa and 293 K; 35° at 10 MPa and 318 K) estimated by fitting mercury injection capillary pressure data to sandstone coreflood data [60] were significantly larger than the measured θ (10° at 5.5 MPa and 293 K; 18° at 10 MPa and 318 K; estimated from Fig. 8(a) for pure quartz) at similar thermo-physical conditions. This inconsistency between these results could lie in the different rock surface chemistry: sandstone (composition = 81 vol% quartz +17 vol% K-feldspar +2 vol% other (including muscovite, hematite and illite)) was used in the coreflood experiments [60], while pure quartz was used in the above θ estimates (based on video contact angle data), [93]. Another explanation is that extrapolating mercury data is not reliable, see also discussion above. More likely is, however, that the sandstone core contained small amounts of organics (which is expected, compare [97,98]), which can easily account for this difference. It is also concluded that other minerals and rocks (e.g. calcite, dolomite, mica, shale, coal, carbonate and others) need to be tested with respect to their H2-wettability in the future, to reliably assess UHS potential in various other geological settings. 2.3.2 Solid-fluid interfacial tension Solid-fluid interfacial tension (γ SF ) is directly related to rock wettability via Young's equation. (3) θ = arccos γ S F 1 − γ S F 2 γ LF thus γ SF influences H2 distribution and H2 migration in the reservoir [99–101]. Due to the absence of experimental methods to measure this parameter reliably, semi-empirical methods are used to predict γ SF [57,100–102]. Further, if γ LF , γ SF1 and γ SF2 are known, θ can be predicted via Young's equation. However, currently, only one paper reported rock-H2 interfacial tension (γ rock−H2) [101], Fig. 9. γ rock−H2 decreased with pressure and temperature for cleaned quartz and basaltic rock. γ rock−H2 also decreased with increasing stearic acid concentration, e.g. at 323 K, when stearic acid concentration increased from 1 × 10−9 mol/L to 1 × 10−2 mol/L, aged quartz-H2 interfacial tension decreased from 90.57 mN/m to 81.49 mN/m at 15 MPa and from 84.91 mN/m to 72.37 mN/m at 25 MPa, respectively. As indicated above, clean quartz does not exist in the subsurface; thus, stearic acid aged quartz-H2 interfacial tension is more representative of UHS conditions. 2.3.3 Capillary pressure and capillary forces Capillary pressure (P C ) - which is determined by capillary forces (e.g. [83,103]) - is a prime parameter with regards to multi-phase flow through geological porous media (e.g. [14,104,105]). P C determines pore-scale fluid configurations and fluid movement, and thus reservoir-scale flow (typically implemented via capillary pressure and relative permeability curves (P C and k r curves), measured as a function of water saturation S w , e.g. [9,67,90]). Prior to H2 injection, formation brine resides in the pore space. Hence, the injected H2 needs to displace the in-situ brine. The amount of brine displaced (and thus H2 injected), and the pressure required for this operation is determined by P C . P C is therefore an important parameter in the general assessment of UHS project feasibility. Generally, it would be favourable to achieve a larger S H2 (or a smaller S w ) as this would result in a larger storage capacity C (see Eq. 2). However, only one paper reported P c as a function of S w (the P c - S w curve) for a sandstone-water-H2 system at two potential reservoir conditions [60], Fig. 10. For a sandstone with absolute water permeability of 4.5 ×107 nD (= 45 mD) and porosity of 19%, P c decreased from 110 kPa to 61 kPa at 5.5 MPa and 293 K, when S w increased from 17% to 31%; while at 10 MPa and 318 K, P c decreased from 81 kPa to 56 kPa when S w increased from 19% to 41%. Thus, the P c - S w curves (measured for these two thermo-physical conditions) almost overlapped. This indicates that the influence of pressure and temperature on P c was insignificant. This is opposite to CO2, where pressure and temperature had a clear influence on P c [106,107], Fig. 10. Importantly, after gas injection (into strongly or weakly water-wet or mixed-wet rocks), formation brine will spontaneously imbibe into the reservoir [108,109]. This imbibed brine will therefore again displace the injected H2; this process will break the H2 plume into a discontinuous clustered H2 phase and the associated capillary fingering will increase H2 storage capacity [84,85,110–112]. Note that such capillary trapping is an important storage mechanism in CGS [113,114]. In contrast, in UHS scenarios, the injected H2 needs to be withdrawn again in the future, therefore the residual (trapped) H2 saturation S H 2, r needs to be minimized, and methods should be developed to prevent the H2 plume from splitting up, because larger H2 clusters are more easily to be re-mobilized during H2 withdrawal [86,111]. In addition, P C also determines structural trapping [92,115–117], and thus H2 storage capacities and containment security. Assuming that both, formation brine and H2, exist as a continuous phase, the buoyancy pressure P B of the H2 plume can be predicted via (4) P B = ρ liquid − ρ H 2 gh = Δ ρ gh where ρ liquid is the liquid (brine) density, ρ H 2 is the H2 density, ∆ρ = ρ liquid − ρ H 2 , g is the gravitational constant, and h is the H2 column height which can be permanently immobilized beneath a given caprock. Furthermore, P C can be approximated (assuming that the rock pore network can be considered as a perfect cylindrical capillary of constant cross-sectional diameter), via (5) P c = 2 γ H 2 − liquid cosθ r where γ (H 2−liquid) is the interfacial tension between H2 and the formation brine, θ is the brine-H2-rock contact angle, and r is the radius of the capillary [14]. Thus, at capillary pressure-buoyancy pressure equilibrium (i.e. P c = P B ) [83], the maximum H2 column height is (6) h maximum = 2 γ H 2 − liquid cosθ r ρ liquid − ρ H 2 g To compare h maximum for H2 and CO2 (i.e. h maximum−H 2 and h maximum−CO 2 , respectively) in a common sandstone aquifer, approximate calculations were performed as follows. At 10 MPa and 323 K, h maximum − H 2 ≈ 2 × 68 mN m × cos 55 ° 100 nm × 1000 kg m 3 − 8 kg m 3 × 9.81 N kg ≈ 80 m and h maximum − CO 2 ≈ 2 × 36 mN m × cos 70 ° 100 nm × 1000 kg m 3 − 384 kg m 3 × 9.81 N kg ≈ 41 m . Clearly, r (solid property), γ FF and ρ (fluid properties), and θ (solid-fluid interaction) are all key parameters influencing h maximum ; thus again, it is necessary to determine these parameters accurately at reservoir conditions for reliable evaluations of UHS and CGS projects. It is also clear that more datasets are needed in this area, especially for different lithologies to increase certainty. Critically, if the buoyancy pressure exerted by the H2 plume is too high (i.e. the H2 plume is too large – precisely if its vertical height is too large), H2 can leak back to the surface which needs to be avoided. 2.3.4 Relative permeability Relative permeability (k r ) is the ratio of effective permeability (k effective , defined as fluid conductance of one specific fluid in the presence of other fluids) to absolute permeability (k a ). Importantly, multi-phase fluid flow through porous media is highly influenced by k r [e.g. 112–114]. Normally, the sum of k r for wetting and non-wetting phases is less than one [14]. It is also well-established that k r is a function of S w and rock wettability [106,118–121]. However, data is very scarce for H2 and water k r (i.e. k rH2and k rw ). Indeed only one dataset is available where k rH2 and the associated k rw were measured at in-situ reservoir conditions (using the steady state method [60]), Fig. 11. For example, at 5.5 MPa and 293 K, k rH2 increased from 0 to 0.04 when S w decreased from 90% to 41%; and at 10 MPa and 318 K, k rH2 increased from 0 to 0.03 when S w decreased from 82% to 40%. In contrast, at 9 MPa and 323 K, k r for CO2 (k rCO2) increased from 0 to 0.4 when S w decreased from 97% to 45%; and at 8.3 MPa and 298 K, k r for CH4 (k rCH4) increased from 0.05 to 0.8 when S w decreased from 73% to 33%. These results indicate a very poor ability for H2 to flow through brine saturated sandstone, compared with CO2 and CH4. This low k rH 2 was attributed to the specific (geological) sandstone heterogeneity [60]. However, to better validate this interpretation, more experimental data is required, especially when considering that there is only one H2-dataset. 2.3.5 Mobility ratio Fluid mobility is the product of absolute permeability (k a ) and relative permeability (k r ) divided by fluid viscosity (μ). Mobility ratio (M) is therefore defined as [34]. (7) M = k a k r H 2 μ H 2 k a k rw μ w = k r H 2 μ H 2 k rw μ w i.e. the mobility of the displacing fluid (H2) divided by the mobility of the displaced fluid (water). M is an important factor as it determines H2 injection and withdrawal efficiency and H2-formation brine interfacial stability [124–127]. A large M will cause viscous fingering, which will lead to low H2 sweep efficiency and inefficient formation brine displacement by H2 [126]. It is thus necessary to analyse M in more detail. Clearly, M is a function of S w , pressure, temperature and gas type, Fig. 12 . Specifically, M increased drastically with decreasing S w (in a sandstone), e.g. M for H2-H2O (M H 2 ) increased from 0.06 to 55 when S w decreased from 82% to 40% at 10 MPa and 318 K; M for CO2-H2O (M CO 2 ) increased from 1.9 to 772 when S w decreased from 80% to 45% at 9 MPa and 323 K. Therefore, M CO 2 was much larger than M H 2 at the same S w and thermo-physical conditions. Moreover, increasing pressure and temperature decreased M significantly (e.g. at S w = 73%, M H 2 was 2.3 at 5.5 MPa and 293 K, while M H 2 was 1.1 at 10 MPa and 318 K; at S w = 79%, M CO 2 was 1.9 at 9 MPa and 323 K, while M CO 2 was 0.3 at 34.5 MPa and 395 K). However, more H2-data is required to increase certainty. In addition, to suppress viscous fingering, it is suggested here to reduce the H2 injection rate [128] and/or increase μ H 2 , e.g. by H2-foam formation. This is another area which needs to be explored in the future. 2.3.6 Adsorption-desorption Gas adsorption-desorption typically plays an important role in high surface area systems such as coal [129–132] or shale [133–138]. These processes are well understood for CO2, CH4 and N2 [80,139–142]), but data for H2 is scarce. However, H2 adsorption capacity (A H2) on dry Na-montmorillonite was investigated (via gas chromatography [143]) at 373 K and 0.045 MPa. A H2 reached up to 0.1 wt% after 30–45 days exposure time (similar amounts of CH4 and CO2 were adsorbed under similar conditions). A H2 decreased with increasing temperature (e.g. to 0.07 wt% at 403 K and 0.045 MPa [143]). More recently, H2 adsorption on calcite was predicted via molecular dynamics simulations, and it was shown that A H2 was as high as 0.42 wt% at 0.1 MPa and 400 K – 600 K [144]. Furthermore, A H2 on clay rocks was measured at nuclear waste disposal conditions (pressures up to 9 MPa and temperatures up to 363 K), Fig. 13(a). Clearly, a higher pressure and a larger surface area increased A H2 on clay rocks, Fig. 13(a). For example, at 363 K, for a raw clay rock (composition: 17 wt% illite, 2.6 wt% kaolinite, 2 wt% chlorite, 20 wt% carbonate, 22 wt% quartz and 5 wt% other) with a surface area of 46 m2/g, A H2 increased from 0.125 mmol/g to 0.62 mmol/g when pressure increased from 0.4 MPa to 4 MPa; for a purified clay rock (washed and screened to remove Fe, Mn and carbonate; the sample had 80% clay content and particle sizes <2 μm and a surface area of 84 m2/g), A H2 increased from 0.065 mmol/g to 1.25 mmol/g when pressure increased from 0.4 MPa to 5.5 MPa. However, once H2 adsorption reached saturation (at 4 MPa - 5 MPa for these two clay rocks), A H2 did not increase with pressure any further and plateaued out. These trends are qualitatively similar to CH4 [135] and CO2 [147]. Moreover, a higher temperature slightly increased A H 2 (e.g. at 6 MPa, A H 2 increased from 0.53 mmol/g to 0.62 mmol/g when temperature increased from 293 K to 363 K, Fig. 13(a)). The underlying reason of this atypical behaviour was attributed to H2 reaction with iron present in the clay, and this reaction was significantly faster at a higher temperature [143,148,149]. It is noted that the overlap of chemical reactions with adsorption processes causes a bias towards higher A H 2 , although in reality this observed A H 2 is an artefact and should be discounted from the quantification. It would be advisable to first study iron-free clays, to gather clear data which can be interpreted easily, to build a reliable benchmark database. Furthermore, H2 and CO2 adsorption onto sub-bituminous coal (surface area of 5.7 m2/g and maximum vitrinite reflectance of 0.38%) were investigated at UHS and CGS conditions, Fig. 13(b). A H 2 and CO2 adsorption capacity (A CO 2 ) increased significantly with pressure until adsorption saturation was reached. Specifically, at 333 K, A H 2 increased from 0.128 mmol/g to 0.168 mmol/g when pressure increased from 0.34 MPa to 10.2 MPa; at 323 K, A CO 2 increased from 0.518 mmol/g to 2.849 mmol/g when pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 3.9 MPa. Temperature therefore clearly influenced A H 2 , but not A CO 2 . For example, around at 10 MPa, A H 2 decreased from 0.576 mmol/g to 0.168 mmol/g with temperature increase from 303 K to 333 K. Further, A H 2 was much smaller than A CO 2 under similar thermo-physical conditions, e.g. at 303 K and 3.4 MPa, A H 2 was 0.237 mmol/g, while A CO 2 was 2.992 mmol/g. This big difference (between A H 2 and A CO 2 ) was attributed to the significantly different quadrupole moments (CO2 has a quadrupole moment that is approximately ten times higher than that of H2 - which corresponds to the ten-times higher adsorption capacity) [140,146,150,151]. However, H2 desorption was slow [136], and this may not be sufficient to meet industrial withdrawal requirements. In addition, gas adsorption can cause rock deformation [152,153], permeability change [142,154], surface area variation [147] and mechanical weakening [30,142]. Therefore, it is important to further investigate H2 adsorption/desorption at in-situ UHS reservoir conditions to study such potential effects. 2.3.7 Chemical reactions In the context of long-term CGS, CO2 mineralization is regarded as the most secure CO2 trapping mechanism [155,156]. However, in UHS scenarios, H2 mineralization or other types of chemical H2 conversion would clearly be unfavourable. It is thus necessary to identify and assess potential chemical H2-subsurface reactions which may act as H2 sinks. These can in principle be categorized into inorganic H2-brine-rock reactions and biochemical reactions (mainly involving bacteria which can convert H2 [6,137]). Importantly, H2 reactions are essentially redox reactions [158,159]; instead CO2 mainly undergoes acid-base reactions (via carbonic acid formation, e.g. [65,160]). 2.3.7.1 Inorganic reactions Inorganic reactions between H2, brine and rock can alter the petrophysical properties (including permeability, porosity, pore structure, and mineral composition) and mechanical stability of the rock, which may change H2 storage capacity and containment security [159,161]. Previously, geochemical reactions between H2 and sandstone (73.8 vol% quartz, 22.4 vol% K-feldspar, 2.9 vol% clay, and 0.9 vol% oxide) were investigated as a function of pressure (up to 10 MPa), temperature (373 K and 473 K) and reaction time (1.5–6 months) [161], Table 1 . Quartz and K-feldspar showed no changes in texture, mineral phases or composition. In contrast, muscovite and hematite demonstrated small changes (i.e. hematite content slightly increased while muscovite content slightly decreased). Furthermore, presence or absence of water had no detectable influence on these H2-sandstone reactions. Furthermore, to evaluate long-term UHS feasibility in sandstone reservoirs, numerical geochemical (thermodynamic) simulations were also performed, based on these experimental results [161]. These simulations showed that H2 had no major effect on the dominant minerals (i.e. quartz and K-feldspars) after 100 years, and only a very minor hematite dissolution in a H2-H2O environment was predicted (the hematite mass fraction decreased from 2.0373 wt% to 2.0362 wt% after 100 years, a 0.054% change only). Moreover, petrographic and petrophysical variations in sandstones after H2 exposure (exposure time was 6 weeks) at 10 MPa – 20 MPa and 313 K – 403 K were studied [162]. No changes in helium porosity, N2 permeability or surface area were measured (these were within the experimental error) for the sandstone samples without anhydrite and carbonate. In contrast, clear porosity increase (from 7% to 15%) and permeability increase (from 2.89 × 108 nD to 4 × 108 nD) were measured for the sandstone samples which contained anhydrite and carbonate. These changes were attributed to carbonate and anhydrite dissolution into H2-enriched water, as visualized via X-ray micro-computed tomography [162]. It was further noted that salt and/or carbonate precipitation from residual formation brine (which might be caused by oversaturation due to H2 injection) could block pores and consequently could reduce porosity and permeability accordingly [162]. In addition, sulphide minerals were found to be very reactive [159,163]. For example, pyrite (either in pure form or dispersed at low concentration - 1 wt% - 2 wt% - as framboidal phase in clay-rich rock) partially reacted into pyrrhotite after 300 h (in calcite-buffered aqueous solutions at 363 K - 523 K and 0.1 MPa - 3 MPa, measured by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy [159,163]). However, when pressure and temperature were below 0.6 MPa and 150 °C, pyrite reactions were not measurable. At harsher conditions though, significant amounts of pyrite were reduced to pyrrhotite (by H2), e.g. about 5% of the pyrite reacted to H2S and 20% of the pyrite was converted to other sulphides at 1.8 MPa and 180 °C within 250 h [163]. Therefore it can at this moment be concluded that quartz and K-feldspar are not reactive, but pyrite and hematite (and probably other sulphides and iron-based minerals where S and Fe exist in a high oxidation state) do react with H2 at UHS conditions. However, data is again scarce and more minerals need to be tested with regards to their chemical reactivity. 2.3.7.2 Biochemical reactions In addition to the inorganic reactions outlined above, organic reactions play an important role as well in UHS. These organic H2 redox reactions are typically catalysed by microorganisms [159,164,165]; thus such organic reactions are inhibited in highly saline environments (salinities >35 g/L were tested) [166], but are promoted in alkaline environments [159]. Consequently it was suggested that H2 redox reactions (e.g. sulfate reduction and acetate production) should be slow in acidic aqueous aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, where high salinity conditions prevail [167,168]. However, in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, reactions between H2 and hydrocarbons are also possible (e.g. C2H6 + H2 → 2 CH4), and these would lead to H2 loss [15,169]. In addition, if sulphur exists in such potential storage sites, H2 reaction with sulphur will generate H2S, which is toxic [15]. Therefore, these chemical reactions (methanogenesis, sulfate-reduction, iron-reduction, and acetogenesis [69,170,171]) are all possible factors influencing UHS; these need to be studied in more detail in the future as data is limited, especially for true UHS conditions."
5,"Comparison between underground hydrogen storage, carbon geo-storage and natural gas storage","It is tempting to use benchmark data from CGS projects or natural gas reservoirs, to estimate what will take place in UHS reservoirs. This is, however, not a good idea as the different fluids (H2 versus CO2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons) demonstrate very different physical and particularly chemical properties (e.g. [83,172]). However, at the same time H2 data is extremely scarce while CGS and natural gas data is abundant. It is therefore an economic requirement to compare the existing data, and to assess where meaningful extrapolations are permitted, while serious pitfalls are avoided. Clearly, only solid properties (i.e. k a and ϕ effective ) show a consistent trend among UHS, CGS and natural gas reservoirs, which is somewhat trivial. In contrast, fluid properties (e.g. ρ, μ, and γ FF ) and solid-fluid interactions (e.g. θ, P c , k r , M, adsorption-desorption and chemical reactions) are significantly different. These differences further emphasize that conclusions drawn from CGS and natural gas reservoirs cannot be used directly in UHS. More investment in UHS research needs to be commissioned, to seriously and correctly evaluate UHS opportunities."
6,Implications and future work,"Solid properties (k a , ϕ effective , and σ effective ), fluid properties (ρ, μ, γ FF , solubility and diffusivity) and solid-fluid interactions (wettability, γ SF , P C , k r , M, S, adsorption-desorption, and chemical reactions) are all important parameters which determine UHS storage capacity and containment security. However, although some preliminary work has been completed, and some UHS data is available, it is clear that UHS is still in its infancy. Importantly, UHS is significantly different from CGS and natural gas reservoir scenarios [54,62,139,143]. Therefore, any extrapolation from these different scenarios needs to be avoided. Consequently there are major gaps in the literature, specifically: 1) So far, θ was only reported for H2-sandstone-brine system [93] and γ FF was only reported for H2-H2O system [59]. However, rock/mineral type and brine composition/salinity are also important factors influencing θ and/or γ FF [83]. It is suggested that θ and γ FF are evaluated using in-situ formation brine and rock at in-situ thermo-physical conditions in various geological settings and calculate γ SF accordingly. 2) H2 solubility [69] and diffusivity [77] were measured in bulk liquid phases. This, however, ignores H2 dissolution and diffusion into liquids in nano- and micro- pores which exist in the pore network of the storage reservoir (e.g. surface diffusion occurs in micro- and meso-porous media [80]). It is therefore necessary to quantify H2 solubility and diffusivity in the presence of the various geologic porous media. 3) P C and k r are key parameters which determine H2 injection and withdrawal efficiencies. However, P C and k r were only reported once for a sandstone system in the literature [60]. It is necessary to measure P C and k r for additional lithologies and geo-thermal conditions, and replicate measurements need to be performed, to build a strong benchmark database and increase certainty. It is also required to examine the relationship between k r and ϕ effective . 4) H2 adsorption on shale/coal/clay can promote H2 storage capacity [145,146] and needs to be investigated further. 5) H2 reaction with iron/sulphur will cause H2 loss [159,163]. However, the reactivity of more minerals needs to be tested, especially with respect to organic-biochemical reactions."
7,Conclusions,"Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising technology with which large quantities of H2 can be stored [5,173,174]. UHS performance is determined by rock properties, fluid properties and rock-fluid interactions [15]. However, a critical review of these parameters is still lacking so far. Thus herein, we have systematically reviewed UHS at multiple scales, and below conclusions are drawn: • H2 density increases from 0.5 kg/cm3 to 12 kg/cm3 when pressure increases from 0.6 MPa to 16 MPa; H2 density slightly decreases with increasing temperature. • H2 viscosity increases from 8.7 ×10−3 mPa∙s to 10.6 ×10−3 mPa∙s when temperature increases from 288 K to 373 K (at 10 MPa), but H2 viscosity is essentially independent of pressure at UHS conditions [36,37]. • H2-H2O interfacial tension decreases from 72 mN/m to 44 mN/m when temperature increases from 298 K to 448 K, while it is less sensitive to pressure variations (in contrast to CO2) [59]. • H2 solubility increases with pressure, and H2 solubility in non-aqueous liquids (oil, alcohol, etc) is more than ten times higher than that in brine, e.g. H2 solubility is 0.0364 (mole fraction) in diesel at 4.9 MPa and 353 K; but only 0.000631 in 3 mol/kg NaCl brine at 10.1 MPa and 323 K [68,69]. • H2 wettability in sandstone reservoirs ranges from weakly water-wet to intermediate-wet, depending on pressure, temperature and particularly organic surface concentration [93]. • Capillary pressure and relative permeability in a sandstone-H2O-H2 system were not sensitive to pressure and temperature. This was, however, observed in only one study, and more data is needed here. • The relative permeability of H2 is much smaller than that of CO2 [60]; this may hamper UHS efficiency, and needs to be studied further. • H2 does not react with quartz and K-feldspar, but H2 reacts with hematite and pyrite [159,161,163]. In principle, UHS offers a potentially feasible solution to the H2 storage problem [1–6]. However, data for H2 systems is extremely scarce, and much more fundamental work is required, to evaluate UHS feasibility properly. This review therefore provides an overview over the existing data, and discusses the related implications with respect to UHS, to aid in the implementation of of an industrial-scale hydrogen economy."
