0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as an important resource with incomparable cleanliness and a broad application scope, can be obtained conveniently or almost innumerably from gas transformation [1], fossil-fuel cracking [2] and water electrolysis or from photolysis driven by solar energy [3,4]. However, there are still some formidable problems that restrict these promising applications, the most serious of which is the inevitable dependence on precious metal catalysts to activate H2 for important chemical transformations, such as producing chemicals from hydrogenation or reduction reactions and acquiring electric power from electrochemical systems [5–7]. Therefore, many efforts have been made in seeking inexpensive and robust materials as substitutes for precious metal catalysts for these hydrogen-involved applications. Intermetallic compounds incorporated by cheap transition metals and electronegative-elements, such as carbides, nitrides or phosphides, have been studied intensively in recent years, since they are analogous to precious metals regarding both electronic features and resistance to harsh reaction conditions [8–12]. Nickel phosphides, especially Ni2P, attracted large interest due to their notable catalytic efficiency for hydroprocessing reactions, such as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [13–17], hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [18–21], and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) [22,23] reactions, and some manipulation strategies have been practiced to obtain novel Ni2P-based catalysts. Oyama et al. [24–26] contributed systematic research on employing SiO2 or MCM-41 to support phosphides for hydroprocessing reactions; the catalytic performance of Ni2P supported on these substrates was found to be dependent on the surface acidity or the type of Ni-active sites, such as tetrahedral Ni sites and square pyramidal Ni sites. In addition, some additives, such as Ce [27], Ti [28,29], S [30] or C [31,32], were also introduced into the preparation of Ni2P-based catalysts; the modification from these components to the surface electronic feature of Ni2P was believed to play an important role in enhancing activity. These endeavors have developed some efficient Ni2P-based catalysts, but it should be noted that the ability to activate H2 on a Ni2P-based sample seldom has been addressed. According to our experience, it was difficult to observe the hydrogen activation feature from a classic hydrogen chemical-adsorption-desorption measurement on a pure Ni2P sample, especially on samples prepared from the normal high-temperature-reduction method [33,34]. Although a few reports demonstrate that highly dispersed Ni2P, as small as ca. 6.0 nm particles on supporters, show a weak H2-adsorption-desorption feature [35,36], their ability to activate H2 was still not comparable with precious metals [37,38], which could be a main barrier to Ni2P-based catalysts becoming the general substitute for precious metals in correlating hydrogen-involved reactions. Herein, we attempted to formulate Ni and Ce with a P-binding precursor (HPO4 2−) simultaneously in an easily handled, one-pot solvothermal preparation system to obtain a series of CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposites as hydrogenation catalysts. The catalytic performances and origins of the samples were surveyed representatively by hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL), including corresponding measurements on chemical-adsorption-desorption properties as well as kinetic and mechanic features. The potential of the CePO4/Ni2P sample for selective hydrogenation of two phenyl alkynes and ten other α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds was also investigated. These studies indicated that the properly manipulated CePO4/Ni2P composite structure can be used as the general and superior hydrogenation catalyst; in particular, CePO4 can be employed in heterogeneous catalytic systems to facilitate hydrogen-involved chemical transformations due to its remarkable hydrogen adsorption-activation feature. These findings provide notable references for seeking more practical catalysts for hydrogen application technologies."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts All solvents with analysis purity were obtained commercially and used without further purification. The synthesis of Ce-Ni-P catalysts mainly involves two steps, as detailed in following descriptions. (1) Preparation of primary sample: in aqueous solution of cerium(Ⅲ) nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) and nickel(II) nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) with desired Ce/Ni molar ratios, sufficient diammonium hydrogenphosphate ((NH4)2HPO4) was added; after the mixture solution was further evolved in solvothermal processing system at 180 °C for 24 h, the precipitate filtered out of the solution was dried at 60 °C for 12 h to get the primary sample. (2) Thermal treatment for getting catalysts: the primary sample was calcinated at 600 °C for 4 h, before characterizations and catalytic tests, the calcinated sample was reduced with H2 ﬂow (50 mL min−1) at 600 °C for 2 h to obtain catalyst. For comparison, Ce-P and Ni-P samples were also prepared in the same preparation system under similar conditions."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The actual loading of metal components in catalysts was quantified using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) on Agilent Technologies 5100 ICP-OES. BET estimation based on N2 adsorption at 77 K were measured with Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system after pre-evacuation of the sample at 120 °C for 4 h under high vacuum. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were measured on a Persee XD-3 X-ray diffractometer at a scan rate of 2° min−1 in the angle (2θ) range of 5°–90°. The wavelength of the incident radiation was 1.5406 Å (Cu Kα). Chemical states of sample surface were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on Axis Ultra DLD Electron-Spectrometer. The spectra were obtained at ambient temperature under ultra-high vacuum. The binding energy values were calibrated with the reference to the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.5 eV, this reference gives binding energy values with a precision of ±0.02 eV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed using an FEI Quanta 200F microscope operating at 20.0 kV. Trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope with operating voltage at 200 kV. The sample powder was distributed in hydrous ethanol, and then dropped on a carbon film coated Cu grid (3 mm, 400 mesh), followed by drying under ambient conditions for test. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and temperature programmed desorption of H2 and cinnamaldehyde (CAL) [H2-TPD and CAL-TPD] experiments were performed on a Micromeritics-Auto-Chem II 2920 Chemisorption Analyzer. After blowing the sample (about 50 mg) at 200 °C for 30 min by pure argon (30 mL min−1), the system was cooled down to room temperature under the protection of argon. For H2-TPR measurements, the sample was heated to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 in a 10% H2/Ar flow (30 mL min-1). For TPD measurements, the gas flow of adsorbate [10% H2 in Ar (30 mL min−1) for H2-TPD; bubbling pure CAL with Ar (30 mL min−1) for CAL-TPD] was switched into the system for 60 min to allow the adsorption on catalyst; when adsorption finished, the pure argon was switched into the system for 30 min to blow away free adsorbate, and then the programmed temperature raising process was began from room temperature to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, simultaneously the TCD signal was recorded. In situ Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were recorded on a Bruker Vertex with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector by bubbling reactant (CAL) from isopropyl alcohol solution with N2 (30 mL min−1). Prior to each experiment, the catalyst was heated at 120 ℃ in a flow of N2 (50 ml min−1) for 60 min. The FTIR spectra were recorded by accumulating 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1."
4,Catalytic hydrogenation,"2.3 Catalytic hydrogenation Catalytic hydrogenations of reactants were all performed in a 100 ml teflon reactor encapsulated by the stainless-steel autoclave heater. The reactor containing reaction solution of reactant, solvent and catalyst was charged and recharged 3–5 times with H2 to exclude air, and then hydrogen was introduced and sealed at desired pressure. When the setting temperature was reached, the reaction solution was began to stir at 800 rpm, the composition of reaction mixture was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC 7820A) with a flame ionization detector and a Agilent 19091J-413 capillary column (HP-5, 30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm) and a gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC–MS 7890B-5977 A) with a Agilent 19091S-433 capillary column (HP-5MS, 30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). As an example, for cinnamaldehyde (CAL) hydrogenation, the reaction was carried out at 80 °C and 2.0 MPa H2 with 20 mg of catalyst in 10 ml isopropanol containing 1.0 × 10−3 mol CAL. Conversions and product distributions were calculated from the peaks (shown in GC and GC–MS analyses) identified and calibrated by using standard compounds as references."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Composition and structural features of the samples,"3.1 Composition and structural features of the samples The catalysts were obtained from calcination (at 600 °C for 4 h) and reduction of the primary samples prepared by the solvothermal processing system. To obtain proper reduction conditions, the H2-TPR measurements of the typical samples after calcination and reduction were performed; the corresponding curves were collected in Fig. S1 (in Supporting information). As shown, there were not any significant hydrogen-consuming signals on the Ce-P sample after calcination or reduction, suggesting that the sample cannot be reduced under the condition employed. In contrast, hydrogen-consuming signals on the calcinated Ni-P and Ce-Ni-P samples emerged in a similar temperature range of 500–800 °C (Fig. S1-A (a,b)); thus, the reduction treatment was attempted at 600 °C for 2 h. The hydrogen-consuming signals almost disappeared according to the H2-TPR measurements for these reduced Ni-P and Ce-Ni-P samples (Fig. S1-B (a,b)), suggesting that the calcinated samples could be sufficiently reduced to catalysts, with a stable redox state after the reduction treatment. For the following characterizations and catalytic tests, all the samples endured the previous reduction treatment, as mentioned in Section 2.1. The gross composition of the Ce-Ni-P catalysts with a manipulated molar ratio of Ce:Ni under the excess existence of a P binding species (HPO4 2−) was analyzed by ICP-OES measurements; the Ce:Ni ratios of these samples were present at a broad range of 0.02–2.3. The XRD patterns of the samples are given in Fig. 1 A; the feature diffractions of Ni2P and CePO4 were displayed clearly in the Ni-P (a) and Ce-P (g) samples, according to the PDF cards of #03–0953 for Ni2P and #32-0199 for CePO4. For the Ce-Ni-P samples, the more distinct diffraction peaks of Ni2P rather than those of CePO4 were observed when the Ce:Ni ratio was manipulated at a relatively low range of 0.02–0.9 (b–d), indicating that the main phase of these samples presents as Ni2P. The CePO4 phase began to emerge in the samples when Ce:Ni further increased above 0.9 (e–f). The possible changes in the surface state with such phase variations among the samples were monitored by XPS measurements; the spectra of Ce, Ni and P for the samples are shown as Fig. 1B–D. The Ce-containing samples all showed four similar sub-peaks, marked as two pairs of vo(882.0 eV)-uo(900.5 eV) and vI(885.6 eV)-uI(904.2 eV), which were attributed to Ce(III)3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoemissions, respectively [39–41]. Unlike the co-existence of Ce(III) and Ce(IV) species, which could always be observed on the thermal-treated Ce-contained composites [42–44], the sole presence of Ce(III) on our samples was in agreement with the observation of the reported CePO4 samples [45,46], which was also in accordance with the CePO4 phase recognized by the XRD analysis. These results indicated that Ce was bonded mainly as CePO4 in our samples. For the Ni-P and Ce-Ni-P samples, accompanying the Ni2P crystalline found from the XRD measurement, the phosphide composition on the surface featured the co-existence of the peak centered at 853.4 eV, with Niδ+(0 < δ < 2) mark (in Ni 2p spectrum of Fig. 1C), and with the peak approximately 130.0 eV marked as Pδ−(0 < δ <1) (in P 2p spectrum of Fig. 1D) [32,47]. Besides these two character peaks, a Ni(II) peak located at approximately 856.1 eV and a P(V) peak at approximately 133.9 eV were also observed, which was attributed to the spilled Ni and P species during the high-temperature treatment of the Ni2P-based samples [32,47,48]. In view of the intensity changes of the above photoemissions, with increasing Ce composition among the Ce-Ni-P samples, both Niδ+ and Pδ− signals featuring an Ni2P surface were continuously weakened, and the trend was accompanied by gradually intensified signals of Ce(III) and P(V); the corresponding quantitative surface distributions of elements are listed in Table 1 . These contrasting changes indicated that the surface gradually was dominated by CePO4, with increasing Ce amounts among the Ce-Ni-P samples. Moreover, the atomic ratio of Ce:Ni on the surface for every Ce-Ni-P sample was at least four times higher than that of their counterpart in terms of total composition, further manifesting that Ce components were enriched on the surface of the samples. In addition, the P(V) signal was the main peak in P 2p spectrums for all the Ce-containing samples, which should be assigned to the PO4 3−of CePO4 component. Notably, P(V) peak positions among the Ce-Ni-P samples shifted between those of the pure CePO4 and Ni2P samples, which may be a sign of the existence of the CePO4-Ni2P composite structure on the Ce-Ni-P samples. The morphologies of the typical samples were assessed by SEM and TEM measurements. From the general view of the SEM images shown in Fig. S2 (in Supporting information), the Ni2P reference sample presents as block-like particles on a μm scale, and the CePO4 sample looked similar to a nanorod. In contrast, an appearance change from block to rod with increasing Ce:Ni among the Ce-Ni-P samples was exhibited; the BET values listed in Table 1 also confirmed such dispersion changes among the samples. More detailed morphology features of the samples were estimated by the HRTEM and EDS-mapping images shown in Fig. 2 . In contrast to the monotonous Ni or Ce element distribution observed on the Ni2P or CePO4 samples, for the Ce-Ni-P samples, the dark-colored particles with round edges were Ni-enrichment particles. These particles were surrounded by the particles with shallow color and irregular shape; the element distribution disclosed by the EDS-mapping images indicated that these shallow-colored particles were Ce-enrichment particles. The overlapped area containing both dark- and shallow-colored particles were enlarged, as shown in the HRTEM images in the last column of Fig. 2. For three Ce-Ni-P samples, the dark-colored particles were clarified as Ni2P particles, with a d-space feature value of ca. 0.225 nm for Ni2P[111] or ca. 0.205 nm for Ni2P[201] crystalline ([Ni2P]-PDF#03–0953); interestingly, these Ni2P particles were nearly isolated from each other by the shallow-colored particles, with d-space values of ca. 0.290 nm, ca. 0.312 nm and ca. 0.335 nm, which were assigned to [012], [120] and [200] crystalline structures of CePO4, respectively ([CePO4]-PDF#32-0199). These observations indicated that the prepared Ce-Ni-P samples were composed as connected or closely contacted Ni2P and CePO4 particles, with a comparable size range of ca.10.0–40.0 nm. In some early reports, different compounds connected with each other have comparable sizes at the nanoscale; such combinations could be considered nanocomposites [49]. Hence, the present Ce-Ni-P samples could also be ascribed to CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposites; such structural features were also in harmony with the properties of the samples evaluated by the XRD and XPS measurements. Therefore, it can be concluded that a series of CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposites were synthesized from this work. Based on the above characterizations, our Ce-Ni-P samples were denoted (CePO4) m /Ni2P, in which m presents a molar ratio of CePO4:Ni2P. (Note: m can be converted directly to 0.04–4.6 from the Ce:Ni atomic ratio range of 0.02–2.3 for the samples)."
7,H2-TPD measurements and the function of CePO4,"3.2 H2-TPD measurements and the function of CePO4 Ni2P-based catalysts have been investigated for many important hydrogen-involved reactions, but their ability to activate hydrogen has seldom been addressed. H2-TPD measurements were performed on our catalysts to illuminate this feature; the results are given in Fig. 3 . Only nearly-flat baselines were observed on the Ni2P and (CePO4) 0.04 /Ni2P (with the fewest Ce in this work) samples, suggesting a poor capacity to chemically absorb (or activate) hydrogen in the two samples. In contrast, the intensive and broad desorption signals within 50–200 °C, including the first peak at approximately 75 °C, were observed in our pure CePO4 and (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples with surface-enriched CePO4 (m ≥ 0.12). As a general observation for precious metal catalysts, such as Pt, Pd or Rh-containing samples, distinct H-desorption signals always emerge from the temperature around or even below the ambient environment, and always raise the peak below 100 °C in common H2-TPD measurements [37,38]. In comparison with the absent desorption signals on Ni2P, the intensive hydrogen desorption peak and the comparable peak temperature with precious metal catalysts observed on CePO4-containing samples implied that CePO4 was an efficient component to activate H2. One might question that highly dispersed Ni2P was also capable of activating hydrogen, such as Wu et al. [36], reporting the desorption peak above 210 °C on the highly dispersed Ni2P nanoparticles, with SiO2, ZrO2 or Al2O3 as supporters. The result was also observed in NixP/SiO2 samples by Chen et al. [35] in their H2-TPD tests; the desorption initiated from approximately 100 °C and evolved to its peak at approximately 200 °C. Obviously, even highly dispersed Ni2P nanoparticles can chemically adsorb or activate hydrogen. The desorption temperature on those nanoparticles was quite higher than those on precious metals or on our CePO4-containing samples; the comparison suggested that the bond strength of active hydrogen adsorbed on Ni2P could be much more intensive than that on precious metal, which could substantially hamper the kinetics of hydrogen-involved transformations and could lead to the inferior catalytic performance of Ni2P-based samples compared to precious metals. In contrast, on our (CePO4) m /Ni2P composites, the remarkable H2-adsorption-desorption feature should be attributed to the outstanding ability to activate H2 of CePO4 compared to that of Ni2P. Based on these findings, by comprehensively correlating the characterization results, such as surface area (BET), CePO4 surface distribution (XPS), and average size of CePO4 particles (TEM), we tried calculating the surface molecular density of CePO4 among our samples, and the value was then compared with the H-desorption amount from the H2-TPD measurements. Interestingly, the mole ratio of H:CePO4 on our samples was resolved in the range of 0.7–1.4, suggesting that the H2-activation process on CePO4 could initiate mainly from the dissociated adsorption of hydrogen, which also resembled the feature of precious metals. Therefore, the active site number for our samples could be estimated according to the H-desorption amount by assuming every site as being capable of chemically adsorbing or releasing one hydrogen atom, as the popular method employed to estimate the value for precious metal catalysts [50,51]. The detailed numbers for the samples are listed in Table 1. The increased number was roughly proportional to the increase in Ce in terms of surface composition among the samples, further confirming that CePO4 was the key component to activate hydrogen in our (CePO4) m /Ni2P nanocomposites."
8,Catalytic hydrogenation for typical reactants,"3.3 Catalytic hydrogenation for typical reactants Considering the notable hydrogen adsorption-activation feature of the (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples, the potential for catalytic hydrogenation reactions of these samples was investigated. Phenylacetylene first was employed as a model reactant; the results are shown in Fig. 4 . The reactant almost can be converted fully to the desired product (styrene) in ca. 89–94% yield in typical (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples (0.12≤ m ≤1.8). Notably, the results were obtained under mild reaction conditions, such as 0.1 MPa H2 and 353 K, which were located on the same level with those of some recently developed catalysts [52–55], suggesting that (CePO4) m /Ni2P may be a promising selective hydrogenation catalyst. Investigations on the hydrogenation of a broad scope of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds were performed to elucidate this potential more clearly. The representative catalytic measurements were displayed by the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL), as shown in Fig. 5 . As seen in Fig. 5A, there was no significant CAL conversion in the Ni2P, CePO4 and (CePO4)0.04/Ni2P samples, indicating that the isolated components or the composite sample with very low Ce composition were not sufficient to trigger a reaction. In contrast, when the Ce composition was enhanced to m ≥ 0.12, the abrupt increase in CAL conversion emerged, and the highest speed was observed on (CePO4)0.50/Ni2P, with a final conversion of 96% in 120 min. After the Ce composition was further increased to m > 0.50, the reaction speed gradually decreased among the samples and gave the lowest final CAL conversion of 72% in two hours on (CePO4)4.6/Ni2P. According to the active sites estimated from previous H2-TPD measurements, the turnover frequency (TOF) in every sample was normalized to the initial reaction speed (the average speed within the initial ten minutes) [56]; these values were resolved in the range of 0.06-0.51 s−1 for our active (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples (m ≥ 0.12), as shown in Table 1. Surprisingly, the TOF range was located in the reported range (0.02-0.76 s−1) for precious metal catalysts [50,51], suggesting that the activity of our CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposite catalyst was comparable to that of precious metal catalysts for the hydrogenation reaction. One reviewer noted that directly dispersing Ni2P on supporters such as oxide or CePO4 could also lead to a similar performance. To clarify this possibility, two samples with supported Ni2P on TiO2 and CePO4 were prepared, and their catalytic performances were examined and compared with our CePO4/Ni2P composite sample, as shown in Fig. S3 (in Supporting information). As observed, there was not a significant HCAL production on the TiO2-supported sample, suggesting that even when Ni2P was dispersed, the absence of CePO4 would not trigger a reaction. The CePO4-supported sample provided a considerable yield, but the yield was always lower than that of the CePO4/Ni2P composite under the same reaction condition, which could be correlated with the difference that Ni2P would cover the CePO4 surface in a supported sample; however, more CePO4 would be exposed in the CePO4/Ni2P composite structure, as disclosed by the XPS measurements. In addition, in comparison with a highly dispersed Ni2P catalyst (ca. 6.0 nm) on SiO2 (68% HCAL yield) in the literature [48], (CePO4)0.50/Ni2P achieved a much higher HCAL yield (95%) in a shorter reaction time under lower temperature and H2 pressure. These results suggested that the efficient activation of hydrogen, such as the function upon the CePO4 component in our sample, was a more important factor in the speed of reactions rather than enhancing Ni2P dispersions. In other words, the comparable ability to activate hydrogen with precious metals originating from a CePO4 component could be a main contributor for the attractive activity observed in our CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposite catalysts. In addition, although the speed changed apparently when altering the Ce composition among the (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples, the selectivity to hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) was maintained in the range of 92–99% once the reaction started, leading to the synchronous increase in HCAL yield with CAL conversion, as shown in Fig. 5B. These results illuminated the dramatic enhancement of catalytic performance in both activity and selectivity on the (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples compared to isolated CePO4 or Ni2P for selective hydrogenation reactions."
9,Adsorption-activation of CAL and the role of Ni2P,"3.4 Adsorption-activation of CAL and the role of Ni2P Notably, in comparison with the (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples, with 0.12 ≤ m ≤ 0.5, although the CePO4 and (CePO4)m/Ni2P samples had a higher Ce composition (m > 0.5), all were active for hydrogen (possessing higher active site density in view of the H2-TPD results); the activity of the hydrogenation reaction was at a relatively lower level. To address this issue, Fig. 6 shows the CAL-TPD curves among the representative samples, such as the Ni2P, (CePO4)m/Ni2P samples, with m = 0.12, 0.50 and 1.80, and CePO4. In contrast to the absent desorption signal on a pure CePO4 sample, distinct desorption peaks were observed in the Ni2P-containing samples, and the desorption amount was approximately proportional to the exposed fraction of Ni2P among (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples. In addition, the in situ FT-IR spectra were also compared among the typical samples, as given in Fig. S4 (in Supporting information). Again, there were not any signals directed toward CAL on CePO4; however, both CO and CC vibration features of adsorbed CAL emerged on Ni2P and (CePO4)m/Ni2P. These results suggested that the role of the Ni2P surface was to activate CAL, which was in agreement with how Ni2P was active upon the interaction with carbon-chain molecules, as was supposed by the literature [25,48]. Hence, it can be determined that the catalytic performance, especially the activity of hydrogenation for CAL on the (CePO4)m/Ni2P catalysts, was conjunctively governed by the different roles in activating reactants on CePO4 and Ni2P, detailed as the hydrogen activation on CePO4 and the CAL activation on Ni2P. Both functions on the two components were necessary to trigger the hydrogenation of CAL, which was demonstrated directly by the fact that neither pure CePO4 nor pure Ni2P can result in a hydrogenation product, as shown in our measurements. It was not a surprise that the properly allocated composition of CePO4 and Ni2P on the (CePO4) m /Ni2P composited structure would play an important role in optimizing reaction speed; in our case, (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples with m in 0.12-0.50 showed more satisfactory speed compared to the other compositions."
10,Kinetic measurements for the representative CePO4/Ni2P catalyst,"3.5 Kinetic measurements for the representative CePO4/Ni2P catalyst As is known, reaction temperature and H2 pressure play an important role in governing the reaction behavior of the hydrogenation process [57]. The kinetic feature of hydrogenation of CAL on a typical (CePO4) m /Ni2P catalyst (m = 0.50) was surveyed from these two factors. First, the catalytic performance of (CePO4) 0.50 /Ni2P by varying the reaction temperature from 333 K to 373 K was collected; with the corresponding catalytic data, the dependency of lnCt on the reaction time under every temperature condition was resolved, as given in Fig. 7 A. These dependencies all displayed as a linear relationship, indicating that the catalytic process of (CePO4) 0.50 /Ni2P followed the first-order dependence on CAL concentration. Correspondingly, the reaction rate constant k under respective temperature conditions can also be estimated from these lines. By correlating lnk with reaction temperature, a linear Arrhenius plot was obtained in Fig. 7B, and the apparent activation energy (Ea) can be resolved as 55.1 kJ/mol. The value was located in the Ea value range (42–65 kJ/mol) reported for some precious metal catalysts [57–59]. The influence of H2 pressure on reaction behavior was investigated by varying the pressure from 2.0 Mpa to 4.0 Mpa. The variation of the CAL concentration (Ct) with the reaction time under different pressure conditions was compared in Fig. 8 A. It can be found that increasing H2 pressure obviously increased the conversion of CAL. In this H2 pressure range, the selectivity of HCAL can be maintained above 92%. However, when the pressure was increased above 4.0 Mpa, such as 5.0 Mpa, further hydrogenation product (HCOL) emerged, obviously accompanying the conversion of CAL, as the composition change in the reaction mixture with reaction time at 2.0 MPa, 4.0 Mpa and 5.0 Mpa was compared in Fig. S5 (in Supporting information). The result suggested that the reaction behavior of (CePO4) 0.50 /Ni2P could be altered intensively by manipulating H2 pressure in view of the obvious selectivity change when the pressure surpassed 4.0 Mpa. On a Pt Lewis acid collaborative catalyst [57], Li et al. found that the acid property of a supporter (MIL-101) played an important role in confining the adsorption-activation mode of CAL, in turn giving high selectivity to HCAL. The acid property was not as remarkable in our sample; hence, the confinement effect on the adsorption mode and reaction selectivity was difficult to resolve from our measurements. Relatively, keeping H2-pressure in the range of 2.0–4.0 Mpa, the reaction pathway to produce HCAL would be the main reaction direction in our sample, which could be attributed to how CC would be hydrogenated more easily than a CO bond in an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl molecule under relatively mild conditions [60,61]. In this H2-pressure range, by plotting lnr0 (r0 was the initial reaction rate) with lnP(H2) in Fig. 8B, a linear relationship with the slope of ca. 0.43 was obtained with (CePO4) 0.50 /Ni2P, which disclosed a 0.43 order dependence between the reaction rate and H2 pressure. In addition, it seemed that the linear dependencies of CAL concentration on the reaction time emerged from H2 pressure manipulations (Fig. 8A), which could suggest an apparent zero-order kinetic feature for CAL. However, it should be noted that even when we carefully manipulated H2 pressure in a proper range, such as 2.0–4.0 Mpa to ensure the high selectivity to HCAL on CePO4/Ni2P composite, a considerable production of approximately 10% HCOL in the final composition of the reaction system still would be found when manipulating H2 pressure at 3.0–4.0 Mpa (Fig. S5), suggesting that the influence of the deep hydrogenation pathway on the whole consumption of CAL could not be ignored fully under such a high level of H2 pressure. Relatively, we are more confident in the kinetic results from the temperature measurements, i.e., the apparent first-order for CAL was resolved since the temperature range employed for examining our catalysts was closer to the reaction condition for most reported catalyst systems, including precious metal catalysts, and the selectivity deviation was not prominent in our sample in terms of the temperature range. According to these experimental kinetic data, the reaction rate equation in our CePO4/Ni2P sample was displayed as r = k·CCAL·P(H2) 0.43 ."
11,Mechanical features for hydrogenation of CAL in a CePO4/Ni2P composite,"3.6 Mechanical features for hydrogenation of CAL in a CePO4/Ni2P composite According to the above results, the catalytic process for the hydrogenation of CAL in our sample was supposed to follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, as specialized with the steps listed below, in which R is a CAL molecule (HR- and H2R- are stepped hydrogenation intermediates), A represents the CePO4 site (to activate H2), and B denotes the Ni2P site (to activate CAL(R)). (1) H2 + 2A ↔ 2 H-A (2) R (CAL) + B ↔ R-B (3) R-B + H-A → HR-B + A (4) HR-B + H-A ↔ H2R-B + A (5) H2R-B ↔ H2R (HCAL) + B By assuming that the surface reaction (3) was a rate-determining step and that the other steps were in an equilibrium state, the reaction rate equation was exhibited as r = k3·[R-B]·[H-A], in which k3 is the rate constant of step (3). Since the adsorption-activation feature for hydrogenation of CAL could be not an active site competition process in our CePO4/Ni2P sample, such as the respective role in activating H2 and CAL in two components illuminated in previous measurements, [R-B] and [H-A] were easily resolved as the following equations; in these equations, K1 is the equilibrium constant of step (1), and K2 is the equilibrium constant of step (2). [H-A] = K1 0.5 ·[H2] 0.5 ·[A] [R-B] = K2·[R]·[B] The final reaction rate equation was transformed to r = k·[R]·[H2] 0.5 or r = k·CCAL·P(H2) 0.5 ; in them, k = k3 K1 0.5 ·K2·[A]·[B]. It can be found that the equation almost duplicated the rate equation obtained from experimental measurements in light of the same reaction order for CAL concentration and the close order for H2 pressure. Therefore, the assumed Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism could be a reasonable clue to understand the reaction behavior for hydrogenation of CAL on our CePO4/Ni2P composite catalyst."
12,Utilization stability and expanded hydrogenation application of the CePO4/Ni2P composite,"3.7 Utilization stability and expanded hydrogenation application of the CePO4/Ni2P composite The utilization stability of our samples typically was estimated by cycle use and filtration comparison experiments on (CePO4) 0.50 /Ni2P, seen in Fig. 9 A and B. The slight fluctuations in CAL conversion and HCAL yield among different catalytic cycles manifested the good reuse capacity of our catalyst. The stopped reaction process after the filtration of catalysts out of the reaction system further indicated that the (CePO4) m /Ni2P sample possessed the robust structure and definite activity in a liquid hydrogenation environment. The function of (CePO4) m /Ni2P samples for more reactant substrates was explored, and the typical results are collected in Table 2 . The considerable or superior chemo-selective hydrogenation performance present by the high yield of representative product was observed for two phenyl alkynes and eleven α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In particular, for phenylacetylene and three typical α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds reactants, as listed and compared with literature works in Table 3 , the yields for the same product are comparable to precious metals but are higher than some recently reported non-precious catalysts [48,50–55,60–65] under similar reaction conditions. These results suggested that (CePO4) m /Ni2P could serve as a superior and general nonprecious heterogeneous catalyst for chemo-selective hydrogenation reactions."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, we successfully prepared a series of CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposites with the easily handled, one-pot solvothermal synthesis system. The remarkable hydrogen adsorption-activation feature, being comparable to precious metals discovered on the CePO4 component, made a main contribution for the comparable TOF to precious metal catalysts on well-manipulated CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposites in the catalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) to hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL). The function of Ni2P was illuminated to activate CAL, and a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, detailed as the activated hydrogen by CePO4 reacting with the active CAL-kind spices formed on Ni2P to produce HCAL, could be the possible reaction process for such CePO4/Ni2P composite catalysts. The active CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposite was also a superior catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of two phenyl alkynes and ten other α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. These results suggested that CePO4/Ni2P nanocomposites could serve as a new type of general hydrogenation catalyst, which could provide a notable reference to seek inexpensive, robust and general replacements of precious metal catalysts for boosting correlating hydrogen chemical applications."
