0,Introduction,"In recent years, the photocatalytic water-splitting system has attracted enormous attention because it is a promising approach to gain hydrogen energy (H2) by directly converting earth-abundant solar energy resources [1]. Compared with single-component photocatalysts, compound materials usually display better photocatalytic activities due to their high separation efficiencies of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [2]. Therefore, constructing organic-inorganic hybrids is a promising strategy to gain compound photocatalysts that can not only combine the advantages of organic and inorganic semiconductors but also bring forth new features that are different from those of single component [3,4]. Unlike common organic materials, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, polypyrrole, poly(p-phenylene), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and their derivatives, PDINH is a typical n-type organic semiconductor with unique optical and electronic properties [5–7]. These special properties of PDIs have increased the research with regard to their applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) [8], organic solar cells [9,10], fluorescence switches [11], sensors [12], photodynamic therapy (PDT) [13], and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [14]. Moreover, self-assembled PDI supramolecular systems can be gained through CO⋯HN hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking between PDINH molecules, leading to improved photoinduced electron transfer along the π-π stacking direction and potential application in photocatalysis, such as Zn-PDI [15], Ni-PDI [16], and Ru-PDI [17]. Furthermore, PDIs can be used as organic components to construct organic-inorganic hybrid photocatalysts. For example, Zhu’s group successfully fabricated PTCDI/P25 hybrid using 4-methoxylbenzylamino as a functional group of PDI [18]. Nagarajan’s team revealed a new symmetrical N,N′-di(octadecyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic bisimide (DPBI) and loaded it on TiO2 to enhance photocatalytic activity via degradation of Reactive Orange 4 [19]. Wang and his co-workers reported that PDI molecules, which were modified with electron-rich 4-dimethylaminobenzyl group highly improved the photocatalytic H2 evolution of TiO2 [20]. However, all the above studies mainly focused on PDI derivatives; moreover, the applications based on non-substituents at the parent skeleton (PDINH) in photocatalysis had been rarely investigated systematically. Recently, Zhu and his co-workers successfully fabricated a self-assembled PDINH supramolecular system photocatalyst for degradation of phenol and photocatalytic O2 evolution via a rapid and simple solution dispersion [21]. However, to date, organic-inorganic hybrid photocatalysts combining PDINH with inorganic semiconductor have not been reported. In this study, we chose commercial PDINH and TiO2 P25 as raw materials to construct PDINH/TiO2 organic-inorganic hybrid, which has higher photocatalytic H2 production activity and photocurrent intensity than pure PDINH and TiO2. The interfaces between PDINH and TiO2, which largely determine photocatalytic performance, were also analyzed systematically. The CO⋯H hydrogen bond in the interfaces between the OH of TiO2 and CO of PDINH, which acted as a short and fast channel for migrating the photo-generated charge carriers from PDINH to TiO2, was proposed to explain the reduced photoinduced charge carrier recombination and increased photocatalytic H2 production activity."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts All chemical materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless particularly pointed out. The TiO2 P25 powder, which was purchased from Degussa, had a specific surface area of about 50 m2/g and average particle size of about 25 nm, and the ratio between anatase and rutile was 80:20. In a typical experiment, initially, 300 mg TiO2 P25 powder was dispersed in 10 mL concentrated sulfuric acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 95–98%) for 12 h. Afterward, a certain amount of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDINH, J&K, 95%) was dissolved in the TiO2 solution under ultrasonic treatment for 10 min, and 100 mL deionized water (DI) was added slowly to the above dispersion solution under constant stirring for 120 min. The nanoparticles were centrifuged, washed with DI water and ethanol thrice, and air dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Loading concentrations of PDINH were changed from 0.1 wt% to 2.0 wt%, and the corresponding photocatalysts were denoted as 0.1% PDINH/TiO2, 0.3% PDINH/TiO2, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2, 1.0% PDINH/TiO2, and 2.0% PDINH/TiO2. For comparison, pure H-PDINH was also prepared using the above method without TiO2. Furthermore, to analyze the effect of sulfuric acid on TiO2, pure TiO2 was treated with concentrated sulfuric acid for 12 h, and the H2SO4-treated TiO2 powder that was gained after centrifugation was washed and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in air, and the photocatalyst that was gained was denoted as H-TiO2. To study the effect of the ratio between anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 on the final properties of PDINH/TiO2 systems, different ratios of anatase and rutile phases in TiO2 and corresponding 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 samples were prepared. The anatase phase TiO2 was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method [22], and 25 mL tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OBu)4, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 98%) and 3 mL hydrofluoric acid (HF, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 47%) were mixed thoroughly in a 100-mL Teflon autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h. The pure anatase phase TiO2 powder (A-TiO2) was collected, washed, naturally cooled to room temperature, and then dried. Moreover, a series of mixed phases of TiO2 with different ratios of anatase and rutile phase was gained by annealing Degussa P25 powder at different temperatures (600 °C and 700 °C) in air, and the corresponding samples were denoted as P25-600 and P25-700. Pure rutile phase TiO2 powder (R-TiO2) was gained when the annealing temperature increased to 800 °C [23] in this work."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to characterize the structures of samples on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα X-ray tube (λ = 0.154056 nm) at room temperature. The morphology and crystallinity of the products were analyzed by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) on a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. UV–VIS diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were analyzed using a Shimadzu UV 2500 recording spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere, and BaSO4 was used as a reference. FT-IR spectra were recorded by using a FTLA2000-104 spectrometer with the standard KBr pellet method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were characterized by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalab 250 spectrometer and calibrated the peak position of C 1s at 284.6 eV. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with 257 nm excitation wavelength at room temperature."
4,Hydrogen evolution measurements,"2.3 Hydrogen evolution measurements To evaluate the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of PDINH/TiO2 samples, a top irradiation vessel connected to a glass-enclosed gas-circulation system was used. In a typical photocatalytic measurement, the as-prepared sample (100 mg) was suspended in 100 mL aqueous solution containing 20 mL methanol as a sacrificial agent and H2PtCl6 (Pt 1.0 wt%) as cocatalyst. The temperature was maintained at 15 °C. A 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd.) was used to provide the light source, and a gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detector was used to determine the amount of H2 produced in this experiment. The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions. A 300 W Xe arc lamp with a band-pass filter of 365 nm and a masked area of π cm2 was used to provide irradiation light. A PL-MW2000 spectroradiometer (Perfect Light, China) was used to determine the photon flux of the incident light. The average power energy density of the irradiation light in this experiment was measured to be about 9.74 mW/cm2. The apparent QE was calculated using the ratio of the number of reacted electrons during hydrogen evolution to the number of incident photons by using the expression [24]: QE = 2 × the number of evolved hydrogen molecules the number of incident photons × 100 % The photocatalytic hydrogen evolutions of PDINH, H-PDINH, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2, H-TiO2, and TiO2 samples with irradiation light at wavelengths of 365, 420, 450, 520, and 600 nm were evaluated. The corresponding average power energy densities of irradiation light in this experiment were approximately 9.74, 57.91, 64.14, 70.98, and 77.01 mW/cm2."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements A three-electrode system was used to investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples. The working electrode was the prepared sample, the reference electrode was saturated Ag/AgCl, and the counter electrode was a platinum electrode. Moreover, 0.1 mol/L sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) aqueous solution at pH ∼7.0 was chosen as the electrolyte in this experiment. A high-pressure 300 W Xe lamp with AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW/cm2 was used as the light source. The working photoelectrodes were prepared as follows [25]: 50 mg catalyst was dispersed in a mixed solution containing 2 mL absolute ethyl alcohol and 0.05 mL Nafion solution, and then the above dispersion solution was ground for 30 min to obtain a slurry. A total of 500 μL of the as-prepared slurry was spread on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode (2 cm × 2 cm) by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s; afterward, the electrode was annealed at 100 °C for 20 min; the above process was repeated thrice. Before the experiment, we used DI water, acetone, and isopropanol to clean the FTO by sonication for 20 min."
6,Computational method,"2.5 Computational method All the calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) based on the density functional theory (DFT) [26,27]. Projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials were used to consider the electron-ion interaction, whereas the exchange-correlation were treated using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [28] in the scheme of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [29]. To correctly describe the effect of a van der Waals (vdW) interaction, we employed an empirical pairwise correction proposed by Grimme [30] in terms of the DFT + D2 scheme. The plane wave basis was set with a kinetic energy of 400 eV, and Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 3 × 3 × 1 (9 × 9 × 1) grid was utilized for geometric optimization (electronic structure calculations). Geometric structures were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV/Å−1 and the convergence tolerance for energy was 10−5 eV. The vacuum space in the z direction was larger than the 15 Å between two adjacent images to eliminate spurious interactions."
7,Results and discussion,"The powder XRD patterns and UV–VIS diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. S1. Fig. S1a shows that all diffraction peaks of PDINH/TiO2 are in good agreement with those of pure TiO2, which can be indexed to the anatase phase (JCPDS NO. 71-1167) and rutile phase (JCPDS NO. 77-0442). No diffraction peaks of PDINH were found in the XRD patterns of PDINH/TiO2 samples because the PDINH content in the PDINH/TiO2 samples is below the visibility limit of X-ray analysis. The XRD spectra of H-TiO2 and H-PDINH remain almost unchanged compared with those of TiO2 and PDINH, respectively. Hence, sulfuric acid treatment does not change the crystal structures of TiO2 and PDINH. Based on the UV–VIS diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of TiO2, H-TiO2, PDINH/TiO2, PDINH, and H-PDINH (Fig. S1b), TiO2 only displays a major absorption in the UV region and has an absorption band edge at about 400 nm. H-TiO2 displays a slight red shift due to the increasing number of hydroxyl group on the TiO2 surface after H2SO4-treatment, and this finding agrees well with the reported literature [31–33]. In contrast to PDINH, H-PDINH has two new absorption band edges at about 500 and 600 nm, which are ascribed to electronic transitions in individual molecules and π-electron delocalization among PDINH chromophores in the self-assembled PDINH supramolecular system, respectively [34,35]. PDINH/TiO2 has three absorption band edges; the absorption band edge at about 400 nm can be attributed to the characteristic absorption of TiO2, and the two other absorption band edges in the visible light region are mainly due to PDINH adsorption on the TiO2 surface. According to the HRTEM image of 0.5%PDINH/TiO2 (Fig. 1 a), the lattice space of 0.35 nm matches well with the (1 1 0) plane of TiO2, and TiO2 is covered by 2 nm-thick PDINH shell. This finding indicates the formation of a close contact interface between the TiO2 core and the PDINH shell, thereby facilitating the transfer of the photoinduced electron. As shown in Fig. 1c, H-PDINH shows lamellar structure, whereas commercial PDINH exhibits thick rod structure (Fig. 1b). The FT-IR spectra were characterized to elucidate the interconnection between TiO2 and PDINH (Fig. 2 a). Almost all characteristic peaks of PDINH were found in 0.5% PDINH/TiO2. As shown in Fig. 2b, the vibrational peak of the CO groups of PDINH/TiO2 shifts to 1658 cm−1 relative to that of PDINH (1668 cm−1). Meanwhile, the characteristic peak at 1640 cm−1 of commercial TiO2 shifts to 1627 cm−1. The formation of hydrogen bonds would lead to decreased wavenumber in the FT-IR spectra of the corresponding functional group [36–38]. These results confirm the formation of hydrogen bonds between PDINH and TiO2. The self-assembled PDINH supramolecular system fabricated through this method has been extensively studied [21]. When commercial TiO2 is dispersed into sulfuric acid for 12 h, abundant hydroxyl groups (OH) are absorbed on the TiO2 surface. As shown in Fig. 3 , the CO⋯H hydrogen bond can be generated when OH meets with the carbanyl group (CO) of PDINH. After deionized water is added, PDINH self-assembled by NH⋯O hydrogen bond interactions with intermolecular π–π stacking interactions. For commercial PDINH, sulfuric acid is a “good” solvent, whereas water is a “poor” solvent. When the “poor” solvent is added, the solubility of originally dissolved PDINH becomes limited, and PDINH self-assembles through non-covalent interactions and precipitates in the form of solid state [21,35]. The XPS spectra were also investigated to provide evidence of the presence of CO⋯H hydrogen bonds between the OH of TiO2 and the CO of PDINH. As shown in Fig. 4 , the binding energies of the Ti 2p states for commercial TiO2, located at 458.55 and 464.5 eV, can be attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4a) [39]. The Ti 2p states of H-TiO2 and 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 show an obvious shift (ca. 0.3 and 0.8 eV) toward a higher binding energy with respect to those of commercial TiO2. This phenomenon was also detected in the O 1s state (Fig. 4b). Compared with the O 1s XPS spectra of commercial TiO2 (529.8 eV), those of H-TiO2 and 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 shift to 530.1 and 530.55 eV, respectively [39]. With regard to H-TiO2, the shift of the XPS spectra is mainly due to the abundant hydroxyl groups (OH) absorbed on the TiO2 surface after H2SO4 treatment; for 0.5% PDINH/TiO2, the shift can be ascribed to the deviation of the electron cloud density of TiO2 caused by CO⋯H hydrogen bonds between the OH of TiO2 and the CO of PDINH. The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of all samples (Fig. 4c) could be ascribed to the residual carbon from organic precursors or adventitious hydrocarbon [40]. In contrast to those of TiO2 and H-TiO2, the C 1s XPS spectrum of 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 shows two obvious peaks at 284.6 and 287.7 eV; the latter originates from PDINH on the TiO2 surface. These two peaks were also detected in PDINH and H-PDINH. In addition, the N 1s (399.8 eV, Fig. 4d) peak was found in 0.5% PDINH/TiO2. Further analysis of the XPS spectra indicates the presence of PDINH in PDINH/TiO2. Hence, PDINH is absorbed on the TiO2 surface by CO⋯H hydrogen bonds between the OH of TiO2 and the CO of PDINH. Hydrogen produced from water was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of TiO2, H-TiO2, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2, PDINH, and H-PDINH under UV–VIS light irradiation. Fig. 5 a shows scarce H2 production for pure PDINH and H-PDINH. Pure TiO2 exhibits poor activity for H2 production (about 0.4 mmol/h), whereas H-TiO2 shows higher activity (about 0.48 mmol/h) than pure TiO2, it can be put down to improved light absorption ability; this finding coincides with the DRS spectra of TiO2 and H-TiO2. However, all PDINH/TiO2 samples display higher H2 production rates than H-TiO2 and TiO2. Moreover, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 exhibits the highest H2 production rate of approximate 1.2 mmol/h, which is 3.0 times than that of pure TiO2. However, excessive PDINH could affect the light absorption of TiO2, and the excessive interface between PDINH and TiO2 could form a capture center, which could decrease the photo-induced carrier separation efficiency. When the amount of PDINH is increased to 1.0 and 2.0% in PDINH/TiO2, the hydrogen production rates will decrease at some extent. The PL spectra were also analyzed to determine the photo-induced carrier separation efficiencies of all PDINH/TiO2 samples (Fig. S5b). Among all samples, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 displays the lowest PL intensity and thus has the highest photo-induced carrier separation efficiency. This finding further confirms the best photocatalytic activity of all PDINH/TiO2 samples. Cycling experiments were carried out to test the stability of 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 during photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S2). The 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 sample shows decline in the activity of H2 evolution after five cycles. The hydrogen bond can be easily damaged by mechanical force [41] during the photocatalytic process; the CO⋯H hydrogen bonds between TiO2 and PDINH could also be damaged due to vigorous stirring, leading to the fall of PDINH from the TiO2 surface and the decreased H2 evolution activity in 0.5% PDINH/TiO2. The cycling photocatalytic experiments further prove the existence of CO⋯H hydrogen bonds between TiO2 and PDINH. Comparison with other systems for H2 production in literature (Table S1) indicates slight decline in H2 evolution after cycling experiments. Moreover, the stability of the PDINH/TiO2 hybrid system is more acceptable than those of photocatalysts summarized in Table S1. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 was measured under light irradiation by using a band-pass filter of 365 nm and a masked area of π cm2. The time courses of H2 production are shown in Fig. S3. The AQE for H2 production over 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 reaches as high as 70.69% by using irradiation at 365 nm. The photocatalytic H2 productions of various photocatalysts under different experimental conditions are summarized in Table S1. PDINH/TiO2 system display higher photocatalytic activity and quantum efficiency than the majority of TiO2-based photocatalysts. All these results suggest that PDINH can considerably improve the photocatalytic activity of commercial TiO2. In general, excellent light absorption and efficient separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs are the two key factors for enhanced photocatalytic activity. The hydrogen bond not only extends the light absorption but also improves the efficient separation of photo-generated charge carriers of the photocatalyst [41,42]. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of PDINH, H-PDINH, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2, H-TiO2, and TiO2 samples was also evaluated to explore the role of the CO⋯H hydrogen bond under light irradiation at specific wavelength (365, 420, 450, 520, or 600 nm; Fig. S4). The 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 samples displays higher photocatalytic activity than H-TiO2 and TiO2 under irradiation by 365 nm monochromatic light, whereas all photocatalysts show almost identical absorption at 365 nm. Although 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 exhibits better light absorption at 450, 520, or 600 nm, no H2 was detected when irradiated under a certain wavelength of 450, 520, or 600 nm. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples at these wavelengths demonstrates that good light absorption is not the key factor that enhances the photocatalytic activity of PDINH/TiO2. Under irradiation by 420 nm monochromatic light, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 and H-TiO2 exhibit almost the same photocatalytic activity, which is 6 times than that of TiO2. These findings indicate that PDINH/TiO2 and H-TiO2 exhibit visible-light photocatalytic activity because of the increased number of OH group on the TiO2 surface. Hence, the CO⋯H hydrogen bonds between the OH of TiO2 and the CO of PDINH plays a key role in enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of PDINH/TiO2 compounds. Furthermore, previous reports indicated that hydrogen bond can provide a short and fast channel for migrating photo-generated electrons from PDINH to TiO2, thereby promoting the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs [41,42]. The photocurrent transient responses of the as-prepared samples were evaluated in a three-electrode setup to check our assumption. Under the same photoelectrochemical measurement conditions, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 exhibits higher photocurrent transient response than PDINH, H-PDINH, H-TiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 5b). The photocurrent intensities agree well with the results of H2 evolution. This finding indicates that PDINH/TiO2 exhibits higher efficiency for separation of photo-generated electrons and holes due to the rapid transfer of the photoinduced electrons from PDINH to TiO2 through the CO⋯H hydrogen bonds between the OH of TiO2 and the CO of PDINH. PL measurements were conducted to evaluate the capacity for separating photogenerated charge carriers [43,44]. A low PL intensity indicates a high possibility for photogenerated charge carriers to participate in the photocatalytic process. As shown in Fig. S5a, when the supramolecular system PDINH is absorbed on the TiO2 surface through the CO⋯H hydrogen bonds, the emission of 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 is significantly quenched compared with those of pure TiO2 and H-TiO2. Hence, 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 possesses a lower recombination rate of photo-inducted charge carriers, consistent with the results of the photocurrent responses and photocatalytic experiments. TiO2 and 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 samples with different ratios of anatase and rutile phases were prepared to study the effect of the ratio between these phases of TiO2 on the final properties of the system. The XRD patterns and H2 evolution rates of TiO2 and 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 with different ratios of anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The XRD pattern of A-TiO2 prepared in this work agrees well with anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS NO. 71-1167). With increasing calcination temperature, the amount of anatase phase TiO2 decreases, whereas that of rutile phase TiO2 increases. When the temperature rises to 800 °C, only rutile phase TiO2 (JCPDS NO. 77-0442) exists. Moreover, the ratio between anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 considerably affects the final properties of their systems. For pure TiO2, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates increase following the order: R-TiO2 < A-TiO2 < P25-700 < P25-600 < P25. Hence, TiO2 containing anatase and rutile phases exhibits better photocatalytic activity than pure phase TiO2, and P25 has the highest photocatalytic activity. When PDINH is absorbed on the TiO2 surface, all 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 samples have higher photocatalytic H2 evolution rates than TiO2. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of 0.5% PDINH/TiO2 are 3.55, 3.0, 2.79, 2.64 and 1.33 times higher than those of A-TiO2, P25, P25-600, P25-700, and R-TiO2, respectively. The charge transfer process at the interface of PDINH and TiO2 was also investigated. Charge density difference ( Δ ρ ) was determined to analyze charge transfer and redistribution by using the following equation: Δ ρ = ρ M @ Ti O 2 - ρ Ti O 2 - ρ M where ρ M @ Ti O 2 , ρ Ti O 2 , and ρ M represent the charge densities of TiO2 with molecular PDINH absorbed, pristine TiO2 (1 0 1), and freestanding molecular PDINH, respectively. Fig. 7 a and b shows the configurations of the freestanding molecular and optimized adsorption systems. PDINH is adsorbed on the TiO2 (1 0 1) surface through the O atom of OC and the OH of TiO2, and the distance of the newly generated CO⋯H hydrogen bond is explored to be 1.75 Å. The 3D charge density difference of the corresponding system is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 7c; the yellow and green regions represent the positive (electron accumulation) and negative (electron depletion) values, respectively. A notable electronic rearrangement localizes at the interface of PDINH and TiO2. The corresponding calculated electronic redistribution (both the plane-averaged electron density difference and the Δ ρ value of 0.029 e) is shown in Fig. 7c. This finding demonstrates a net loss of charge above the molecular PDINH and a net gain of charge in the intermediate region between PDINH and TiO2 (1 0 1). Hence, substantial charge transfer occurs from molecular PDINH to the TiO2 (1 0 1) surface through the CO⋯H hydrogen bond between TiO2 and PDINH."
8,Conclusions,"PDINH/TiO2 organic–inorganic hybrids were successfully fabricated using nonsubstituents at the parent skeleton (PDINH) and commercial TiO2 P25 as raw materials. In contrast to previous studies [18–20], this work provides new insights into the interfacial interaction between TiO2 and PDINH self-assembly. The PDINH is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface through the CO⋯H hydrogen bond between the OH of TiO2 and the CO of PDINH. The PDINH/TiO2 organic–inorganic hybrids display higher photocatalytic H2 production activity and photocurrent intensity than pure PDINH and TiO2. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency for H2 production over 0.5%PDINH/TiO2 reaches as high as 70.69% under irradiation at 365 nm. The CO⋯H hydrogen bond at the interface between PDINH and TiO2 can provide a short and fast channel for migrating the photo-generated electrons from PDINH to TiO2 [41,42]; this channel promotes the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production."
