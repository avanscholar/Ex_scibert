0,Introduction,"In Europe, anaerobic digestion of biodegradable residues has received renewed attention by the scientific and technical community over the last decade (Mata-Alvarez et al., 2000, Mata-Alvarez, 2002; De Baere, 2003; Bolzonella et al., 2006; Karagiannidis and Perkoulidis, 2009), especially for the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. This is due to several reasons that stem from the EU legislative framework, which has set specific constraints on landfilling of biodegradable wastes, maximization of materials recycling as well as enhancement of energy production from renewable sources. Numerous investigators (Han and Shin, 2004a; Liu et al., 2006; Gómez et al., 2006, 2009; Ueno et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2008; Wang and Zhao, 2009; Lee et al., 2010b; Dong et al., 2011) demonstrated that if fermentation of biodegradable organic substrates is appropriately operated in a two-staged mode, separation of the acidogenic and methanogenic phases can be accomplished: while acidogenesis produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the gaseous products and releases VFAs into the liquid solution, methanogenesis allows for final conversion of the residual biodegradable organic matter from the first stage into methane and carbon dioxide. Considering that H2 has the highest calorific value per unit weight of any known fuel and an improved acidogenic phase has been reported to result in enhanced biogas yield in the second stage, separating the phases of the anaerobic digestion process would increase the energy efficiency overall (Liu et al., 2006; Lee and Chung, 2010; Dong et al., 2011). Furthermore, proper processing of the digestate to yield a valuable final product for use as a soil amending material would contribute to improved environmental sustainability of management of biodegradable organic residues. A number of potentially suitable residual substrates have been evaluated for biohydrogen generation potential through dark fermentation. Among these, fractions of municipal solid waste such as food waste (FW) and the broader mixture of materials known as organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW; basically FW combined with non-recoverable paper residues) may represent relatively inexpensive and suitable sources of biodegradable organic matter for H2 production, mainly due to their high carbohydrate content and wide availability (Okamoto et al., 2000; Lay et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004, 2011a; Liu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2008a,b; Zhu et al., 2008; Wang and Zhao, 2009; Nazlina et al., 2011). Hydrogen production via fermentation involves either facultative or strict anaerobic bacteria. The various metabolic pathways that may establish can either be promoted or inhibited, depending on the adopted operating conditions, which govern the production of specific volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols including acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate and ethanol. In carbohydrates fermentation, the acetate and butyrate pathways involve the production of, respectively, 4 and 2mol of molecular hydrogen per mol of glucose degraded. However, propionate, ethanol and lactic acid can also be produced in mixed bacterial cultures, adversely affecting H2 production: propionate is a metabolite of a H2-consuming pathway, while ethanol and lactic acid are associated with zero-H2 pathways (Guo et al., 2010a). The question as to how to achieve optimal H2 generation while keeping treatment costs low and producing an effluent suitable for further treatment is probably the main technical issue to be addressed. To this regard, operational parameters including temperature, pH, reactor configuration, substrate concentration and organic loading rate should be the subject for optimization of process efficiency. Recent literature studies on H2 production from FW and OFMSW through dark fermentation have focused on a broad range of operating conditions, implicitly denoting that for full-scale application of the process a better understanding of the influence of the relevant process parameters is still required. The aim of this manuscript is to present an updated overview of H2 production from FW or OFMSW through dark fermentation, based on more than 80 recent related publications. Although a number of review papers has been published on fermentative H2 production from various biodegradable wastes, to the authors’ knowledge a critical overview of literature studies with a specific focus on FW/OFMSW is still missing. The analysis conducted in the present study was focused on the following issues: (a) type of inoculum and applied pre-treatment, (b) type of fermentation reactor, (c) organic loading rate (OLR), (d) solids retention time (SRT), (e) temperature and pH. Since the numerous literature studies on this subject have adopted different approaches focusing on several specific aspects of the fermentation process, the reported results are diverse and sometimes even conflicting. On account of this, an effort was made in the present manuscript to statistically analyzing literature data to derive information on the relative importance of the main parameters of concern, as well as on their potential mutual relationships."
1,Process yield and conversion efficiency,"An important issue related to fermentative hydrogen production from biodegradable wastes involves how to appropriately evaluate and express process efficiency. To this regard, the expected hydrogen production yield may be conveniently converted into a parameter representing the conversion efficiency attained upon fermentation, which may in turn be expressed either in terms of mass or energy units. The concept of conversion efficiency derives from the existence of a fermentation barrier to hydrogen production from organic substrates, which may be elucidated considering the conversion of a simple carbohydrate such as glucose. If the complete conversion reaction to hydrogen is taken into account (Eq. (1)), it turns out that theoretically 12mol H2 can be extracted from 1mol of glucose: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 12 H 2 + 6 CO 2 However, this reaction is energetically unfavorable with respect to biomass growth and would also only occur at extremely low H2 concentrations, so that the real conversion potential is in fact lower than this theoretical value. At the best, the optimized conversion of glucose into hydrogen is limited to acetate production and is therefore practically limited by the existence of an upper threshold – the so-called Thauer limit (Thauer et al., 1977) – of 4molH2/molglucose (Eq. (2)). As a result, only one third of the theoretical hydrogen production can be achieved in practice, since part of the reducing equivalents in the original substrate remains as acetate. (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + 2 CH 3 COOH In practice, however, organic intermediates also act as electron scavengers, which gives rise to the production of more reduced fermentation products compared to acetate, including propionate, butyrate and longer aliphatic acids, lactate, formate, alcohols and ketones, with an associated decrease in the H2 generation yield. In case the butyrate fermentation pathway is established, the conversion efficiency is reduced to 2molH2/molglucose: (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH It has also been shown (Nath and Das, 2004; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009) that, since in nature fermentation processes have been optimized not to produce hydrogen but to sustain microbial growth, hydrogen represents a waste of energy during metabolism and is therefore preferentially recycled within the metabolic pathways. As a result, a number of reduced products are formed to sustain microbial cell synthesis, including ethanol, butanol, butyrate and lactate, which allow for NADH re-oxidation. This explains how in real practice, even under optimal process conditions, conversion efficiencies to H2 of higher than 15% of the original electrons in the substrate are hardly attained (Angenent et al., 2004). On account of the considerations above, the conversion efficiency may be calculated on a mass basis as follows: (4) E m = mol H 2 produced/mass of substrate Theoretical mol H 2 produced/mass of substrate × 100 Table 1 reports conversion efficiency data according to the definition provided above, as derived from different literature sources. The hydrogen production efficiency may alternatively be evaluated from an energetic perspective, considering the fraction of the total energy content of the substrate recovered in the form of hydrogen, as expressed by Eq. (5): (5) E e = Energy content of the H 2 produced Energy content of the original substrate × 100 Assuming 2888kJ/mol glucose and 242kJ/mol H2 (Dong et al., 2009b) as the lower heating values of glucose and hydrogen, energy conversion efficiencies of 33.5% and 16.8% are calculated if the acetate (Eq. (2)) or butyrate (Eq. (3)) fermentation pathways are assumed to occur, respectively. Alternatively, the amount of energy converted into hydrogen may also be derived considering the COD equivalent of H2, which is equal to 16g COD/mol H2; accordingly, if the specific hydrogen production is expressed per unit mass of input COD, it may be easy to estimate the fraction of the substrate’s energy content which is actually converted into H2 (Kim et al., 2011a). It has been widely documented that in practice, even under optimized process conditions, a considerable portion of the carbon, reducing equivalents and energy content of the original substrate remains in the effluent from the hydrogenogenic phase. In order to maximize the overall conversion yield and ensure adequate substrate degradation, the biohydrogen production process should thus be thought as a part of a combined process where additional energy production and enhanced substrate conversion are attained in different processing stages, which is discussed further in Section 6."
2,Observed influence of process conditions,"As will be shown later in this review, literature studies on biological hydrogen production from residual substrates including FW and OFMSW report considerably wide ranges of variation in the specific production yield observed. The large differences documented in the literature reflect the underlying influence of numerous process parameters, including substrate composition and presence of co-substrates, type of inoculum and applied pre-treatment, reactor type, mode of reactor operation (batch, semi-continuous or continuous), operating variables such as temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), OLR and pH. These are recognized to be the most relevant factors affecting the evolution of the fermentative pathways and the associated hydrogen generation yield. The effects of the above mentioned factors are also recognized to be strictly interrelated and mutually interactive, so that a change in one parameter may affect hydrogen production not only due to its individual effect, but also as a result of combined interactions with other process variables. Elucidating and predicting the individual influence of single process conditions and their mutual interactions (which may be either synergistic or antagonistic) is probably one of the main challenges of the research on biological hydrogen production, especially in those cases where complex substrates (for which the metabolic reactions are not fully known in advance) are concerned. In the following sections a discussion of literature findings about the influence of the relevant process parameters is provided, also highlighting where the effects of the operating variables have been found to be mutually dependent."
3,Type and pre-treatment of inoculum,"3.1 Type and pre-treatment of inoculum The seed microorganisms to be used in the process and the need for inoculum pre-treatment are among the most debated issues in hydrogen production from dark fermentation. A variety of data is available in the literature as for the type of inocula used in FW/OFMSW fermentation experiments and the nature of pre-treatments applied to improve the process yield (please refer to the summary data provided in Table 2 ). In general, various pure cultures have been explored to produce hydrogen from a variety of substrates (mainly mono-substrates). In fermentative H2 production from FW/OFMSW, researchers use mixed microbial cultures for practical reasons, since a mixed culture system would be cheaper to operate, easier to control, and capable of digesting a variety of feedstock materials (Li and Fang, 2007; Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005). Anaerobic sludge from full-scale anaerobic digesters, either with or without specific pre-treatment, has been used in numerous investigations as a supplier of a mixed anaerobic consortium. Among the most notable exceptions, Han and Shin (2002), Lee et al. (2008, 2010a) and Cappai et al. (2009) used, respectively, rumen microorganisms from the stomach of cows, an enriched culture from FW compost, and waste activated sludge (WAS) with no specific pre-treatment. In such studies, rumen microorganisms were investigated due to their enhanced cellulolytic capability, while facultative anaerobic bacteria in WAS were considered suitable to enhance the fermentative stage of the process due to their high growth rate and capability to rapidly recover from accidental oxygen intrusion. Alzate-Gaviria et al. (2007) adopted mixtures of inocula (deep soil and vaccine and pig excretes), while Zong et al. (2009) tested cattle dung compost; in both cases a thermal pre-treatment (15min at 100°C) was applied. Aged refuse (AR) excavated from a solid waste landfill with over 10years of placement was also used to enhance biohydrogen production from FW (Li et al., 2008a). The best results (194NlH2/kgVS, 94.3NlH2/kgVS h) were attained when FW was mixed with sewage sludge (SS) or AR at mixing ratios of 100:30 (dry weight) and 100:50 (wet weight), respectively; the FW and SS were thermally pre-treated (2h at 160°C), while AR was used as received assuming that exposure to air upon mining reduced strictly anaerobic hydrogen utilizing methanogens. In general, the addition of AR was believed to significantly promote the hydrogen generation yield in comparison to SS, due to the enrichment in effective biomass population and to the alkaline characteristics which created favorable conditions for the metabolism of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Although the use of mixed microflora for fermentative hydrogen production is practically more viable, important limitations arise from the coexistence of H2-producing and consuming bacteria in nature. A solution which is often practiced involves pre-treatment by various methods to harvest hydrogen producers, on account of their larger chances to survive when a mixed culture is treated by harsh conditions due to the ability of some bacterial species, including Bacillus and Clostridium, to sporulate as a reaction to adverse environmental conditions. To this regard, the main options available are heat-shock treatment (HST), acid treatment, aeration, freezing and thawing, as well as addition of specific chemical compounds. The strategy for H2-consumers inhibition should be selected on the basis of capital and operational costs, feasibility and complexity of the process layout, time needed for inoculum stabilization, effectiveness over the entire fermentation process, and secondary effects/degree of compatibility with further process steps (e.g., methanogenesis, aerobic composting). It should also be mentioned that when non-sterile substrates are used, proliferation of new non-inhibited methanogens is possible, therefore continuous application of the inhibition method is typically required (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). The main chemical inhibitors that have been used for H2 utilizing methanogens are sodium-2-bromoethanesulfonate, 2-bromoethanesulphonic acid, iodopropaneacetylene, ethylene, ethane, methyl chloride, methyl fluoride, lumazine, nitrate and chloroform. Chemical inhibitors may be either specific or non-specific towards methanogens, that can include both H2 consumers and other types of methanogens. The Coenzyme M (CoM) is involved in the terminal stage of methane biosynthesis, where the methyl group carried by CoM is reduced to methane by the methylCoM reductase. BES (sodium-2-bromoethanesulfonate), BESA (2-bromoethanesulphonic acid) and lumazine (C6H4N4O2) are structural analogues of CoM specifically found in methanogens only but not in other bacteria or Archea. They can competitively inhibit the methyl transfer reaction at the terminal reducing stage of methane formation from H2 and CO2. Ethylene is recommended as a reversible selective inhibitor of methanogenesis; methanogenic activity has been reported to completely recover after ethylene removal. Acetylene was also used as a non-specific inhibitor of methanogens. It has been assumed that acetylene destroys the proton gradient across the cell membrane and thus leads to a breakdown of energy metabolism. Chloroform (CHCl3) is known to inhibit the function of corrinoid enzymes and the methylCoM reductase. CHCl3 can inhibit both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, CHCl3 investigation has been found not only to inhibit the activity of methanogenic Archaea but also that of homoacetogenic bacteria and acetate-consuming sulfate-reducing bacteria. Iodopropane is another corrinoid antagonist and prevents the function of B12 enzymes as methyl group carriers. The effect of methyl fluoride is quite controversial: it has been reported to inhibit effectively aerobic CH4 oxidation, while not to affect methanogenesis. However in some experiments, methanogenesis was reduced by about 75% compared to the control without the inhibitor. Methanogenesis could partly be recovered when CH3F was flushed with N2. Nitrocompounds such as nitrate, nitrite, nitroethane, 2-nitropropanol and phosphate can be used as alternative electron acceptors that more effectively consume the reducing equivalents produced during fermentation, redirecting the electron flow away from the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane (Chidthaisong and Conrad, 2000; Liu et al., 2011). The most common approach to harvest hydrogenogenic microorganisms reported in the literature is however by far HST, which is based on the ability of some bacterial species, including Bacillus and Clostridium, to sporulate as a reaction to adverse environmental conditions. Typically, HST requires temperatures around 100°C for durations of 15–120min in order to suppress non-spore-forming bacteria, leaving spores of acidogenic bacteria that will germinate back to their active vegetative state when suitable growth conditions get re-established (Lay et al., 2003; Lin and Lay, 2004; Fang et al., 2006; Alzate-Gaviria et al., 2007; Argun et al., 2008; Bhaskar et al., 2005). In recent studies on FW, the pre-treatment conditions adopted ranged from 20min at 80°C (Lee and Chung, 2010) to 2h at 100°C (Lay et al., 2003). Concerns about the net energy gain of HST, however, make this biomass selection method controversial and claims for further investigation. Enrichment of hydrogen producers by HST is an energy-intensive practice, and the degree of energy consumption can only be partially reduced by adopting temperatures as low as 75–85°C. On account of this, studies have also focused on hydrogen production from FW with no inoculum pre-treatment with the aim of reducing costs and simplifying the process (Chu et al., 2008; Hong and Haiyun, 2010; Lee et al., 2008, 2010a; Li et al., 2008b; Shin and Youn, 2005; Pan et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2011b). An approach defined as biokinetic control has been introduced by Valdez-Vazquez et al. (2005). This is based on maintaining such environmental conditions as to hinder methanogens growth, including low pH, appropriate temperatures or short HRTs causing the wash-out of methanogens (Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009; Cappai et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011b). There are also studies in the literature where no inoculum was added to the feed material, the evolution of the fermentation process relying in such cases on the indigenous biomass present in the waste only. In a two-stage fermentation process for combined hydrogen and methane production from an unsterilized mixture of OFMSW and slaughterhouse waste, Gómez et al. (2006) found that the hydrogen-producing stage had a stable performance (52.5–71.3NlH2/kgVSremoved). Wang and Zhao (2009) also applied a two-stage process, which was performed in a semi-continuous rotating drum in which the indigenous mixed microbial cultures contained in food waste were used for hydrogen production; in the hydrogen production stage (operated at an OLR of 22.65kgVS/m3 d and a solids retention time [SRT] of 160h) a maximum hydrogen yield of 0.065Nm3 H2/kgVS was attained. In the work by Kim et al. (2011b) temperature control in the range 35–60°C was adopted as a biokinetic control strategy to optimize H2 production from FW. The optimal condition for both the H2 production yield and rate was found at an operating temperature of 50°C, with values of, respectively, 1.8molH2/molhexoseadded (or 137NmlH2/gVSadded) and 369NmlH2/lh (or 18.8NmlH2/gVSh). When FW was preliminarily heat-shocked (90°C, 20min) but the fermentation temperature was maintained at 35°C (Kim et al., 2011a), the H2 production yield (1.8molH2/molhexoseadded, or 165NmlH2/gVSadded) was comparatively similar to the previous case, however the process rate (300NmlH2/lh, or 7.0NmlH2/g VSh) was appreciably reduced."
4,Type of reactor and influence of retention time and OLR,"3.2 Type of reactor and influence of retention time and OLR Different reactor configurations have been used to treat FW/OFMSW, mostly consisting of small-scale (100–500ml) vessels and stirred fermenters of 2–10l, operated under batch, semi-continuous or continuous conditions. In fermentative hydrogen production, the SRT, and in turn the OLR, affect the substrate conversion efficiency, the type of active microbial population as well as the metabolic pathways established in the system. The influence of SRT and OLR on hydrogen yield is controversial in the literature. It is generally acknowledged that long SRTs favor the buildup of H2 consumers, such as methanogens, and competitors for substrate, such as non-H2-producing acidogens (Wang and Zhao, 2009). On the other hand, a low SRT may reduce the substrate utilization efficiency, in particular in the case of complex substrates which need an adequate hydrolysis period, and cause the washout of the active biomass, in turn impairing the conversion yield. It should be noted that, since most of the reactors used in the reviewed literature were often operated with no biomass recycle, HRT and SRT coincide. In view of full-scale implementation of the process, HRT is of particular concern since it is clearly related to capital costs. The OLR of the system may affect a number of operating issues, including VFA accumulation and pH changes (which in turn is a function of the system’s alkalinity), as well as variations in the composition of the active biomass, with consequent modifications of the associated metabolic pathways. A comparison of the OLR effects on hydrogen production documented in the literature is complicated by the fact that this parameter is often expressed in inconsistent units in different studies (kgVS/m3 d, kgCOD/m3 d, kgTOC/m3 d), and harmonization of the units used is not always possible due to lack of the required conversion factors. Most studies that used stirred reactors with continuous or semi-continuous operation adopted HRT values between 21h (Lee and Chung, 2010, who worked on the liquid phase extracted from FW) and 4d (Lee et al., 2010a). The reported OLRs values fall within the ranges 8–38kgVS/m3 d (Hong and Haiyun, 2010; Chu et al., 2008) or 20–64kgCOD/m3 d (Li et al., 2008b; Chu et al., 2008). Shin and Youn (2005) found that prolonging the HRT of a semi-continuous system from 2 to 5d and reducing the OLR from 10 to 8kgVS/m3 d more than doubled the hydrogen yield (2.2 vs. 1molH2/molhexose); the change in the OLR was found to prevent VFAs to accumulate in excess of 20,000mgCOD/l. Similar findings were reported by Wang and Zhao (2009) who operated an integrated two-stage fermentation system; a significant reduction in VS removal and H2 yield was observed as OLR progressively increased from 15.10 to 37.75kgVS/m3 d and SRT decreased from 10 to 6.6d. Such negative effects on the fermentation process were ascribed to the associated reduced timespan of substrate hydrolysis. Furthermore, increased OLRs were found to result in reduced acetate and butyrate production with an associated increase in propionate and lactate concentrations; at an OLR of 37.75kgVS/m3 d, the lactate concentration attained a maximum, accounting for ∼30% of the total COD of the measured metabolites (ethanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate and lactate). A significant increase in the hydrogen yield was recorded when SRT increased from 5 to 6.6d (corresponding to a decrease in OLR from 30.20 to 22.65kgVS/m3 d), while a further increase in SRT from 6.6 (OLR=22.65kgVS/m3 d) to 10d (OLR=15.10kgVS/m3 d) only slightly increased hydrogen production. In an optimization study of semi-continuous digestion of FW and dewatered WAS (Hong and Haiyun, 2010), long HRTs (8.9d) were found to result in improved hydrogen generation yield. Prolonged solids retention times were also adopted by Valdez-Vazquez et al. (2005): an OLR of 11gVS/kgd corresponded to a SRT of 21days, and the hydrogen production yield obtained was 165 and 360Nml/gVSrem under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively; the same SRT value is also reported by Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo (2009), with an associated maximum H2 production of 51.2Nml/gVSrem. Different conclusions were suggested by the operation of a two-phase hydrogen+methane production plant studied by Lee and Chung (2010); in this case an OLR increase from 7.4 to 71.3gCOD/lh, with an associated HRT decrease from 66 to 21h, resulted in a significant increase in the hydrogen production rate, which varied from 0.62 to 3.88l/m3 d. In addition to the widely used continuous-flow stirred reactor (CSTR), other types of reactors have also been investigated in order to improve the efficiency of biohydrogen production. A packed bed reactor (PBR) was used by Alzate-Gaviria et al. (2007) to obtain high hydrogen production yields in the short HRT required for methanogenesis inhibition; a yield of 99NmlH2/gVSremoved was attained. An anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was used by Kim et al. (2008b) for FW fermentation, working at different SRTs and HRTs; the maximum hydrogen yield (80.9NmlH2/gVS, or 1.12molH2/molhexose) was displayed at an SRT of 126h and an HRT of 33h. A leaching-bed reactor operated in a sequential batch mode at an SRT of 6d was used by Han and Shin (2004b) for FW fermentation; the outflow from the leaching-bed reactor was then fed to an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for methane production; with an OLR of 11.9kgVS/m3 d, a hydrogen yield of 0.31Nm3 H2/kgVS was achieved. Elbeshbishy et al. (2011) evaluated the performance of a sonicated biological reactor (basically a CSTR equipped with an ultrasonic probe at its bottom) by comparison with a conventional CSTR fed with raw FW and a CSTR fed with sonicated FW. While the CSTR treating the sonicated feed exhibited a 23% increase in hydrogen yield compared to the conventional CSTR, for the sonicated reactor the observed improvement was as high as 62%; similarly, the hydrogen production rate increased, in comparison to the conventional system, by 27% and 90% for the CSTR fed with sonicated waste and for the sonicated reactor, respectively. Although no data on full-scale hydrogen fermentation plants is currently available, some experience has recently been gained on pilot-scale reactors. A pilot-scale (150l working volume) anaerobic SBR treating FW is described in Kim et al. (2010); the reactor was operated at 35°C and an HRT of 36h, achieving a hydrogen yield of 0.5molH2/molhexose. The largest pilot-scale system working with FW is described in Lee and Chung (2010). A two-phase hydrogen+methane fermentation system with a 500l CSTR as the first stage was operated at 30°C and an optimal HRT of 21h for the hydrogen production stage. The hydrogen fermentation tank allowed for a production of ∼1.82molH2/molhexose."
5,Process temperature,"3.3 Process temperature The majority of recent studies on hydrogen production from FW and OFMSW was conducted under mesophilic conditions, specifically between 30 (Lee and Chung, 2010) and 40°C (Wang and Zhao, 2009), and typically in the range 35–37°C (Dong et al., 2009a; Hong and Haiyun, 2010; Kim et al., 2010, 2011a; Li et al., 2008a,b; Zong et al., 2009). The effect of temperature in the mesophilic range (30–45°C) was investigated by Kim et al. (2008a) in FW fermentation by Clostridium beijerinckii KCTC 1785; hydrogen production increased with increasing temperature up to 40°C (with a maximum in acetate and butyrate production), being then strongly inhibited at 45°C. Studies on thermophilic conditions, mostly at temperatures of 55°C, are also documented in the literature (Chu et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2010a; Shin and Youn, 2005; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009; Nazlina et al., 2011). Thermophilic conditions are assumed to optimize the enzymatic activity of hydrogenase during fermentation by Clostridia, to inhibit the activity of H2 consumers and also to suppress the growth of lactate-forming bacteria (Lay et al., 1999; Oh et al., 2004; Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005). Kim et al. (2011b) investigated the effect of temperature in both the mesophilic and thermophilic range (35–60°C) on FW fermentation in the absence of any specific inoculum, and found that the lowest and highest H2 production yields were associated to temperatures of 35 and 50°C, respectively. Although in both cases the amount of organic acids was comparable, lactate was predominant at 35°C while butyrate was the main VFA component at 50°C. Microbial analysis of the fermentation medium also indicated that the dominating species were lactic acid bacteria at 35°C and H2-producers at 50°C, thus confirming the role of temperature in dictating the nature of microbial consortium during the process. On the other hand, however, high temperatures have also been reported to induce thermal denaturation of proteins and essential enzymes, in turn negatively affecting microbial activity (Lee et al., 2006). Comparative studies on hydrogen production from FW under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions were carried out by Shin et al. (2004), Valdez-Vazquez et al. (2005), Kim et al. (2008a) and Pan et al. (2008). Shin et al. (2004) found that the biogas produced from a thermophilic (55°C) culture was free of methane, whilst methane was detected under mesophilic (35°C) conditions, with hydrogen yields of 1.8 and 0.1molH2/molhexose, respectively; the improved yield at higher temperatures was mirrored, in addition to the absence of methane, by negligible propionate concentrations. In semi-continuous fermentation, Valdez-Vazquez et al. (2005) observed that both the hydrogen content in the biogas and the production yield were higher under thermophilic (55°C) than under mesophilic (35°C) conditions, with values of 58 vs. 42% by vol. and 360 vs. 165NmlH2/gVSremoved, respectively. Pan et al. (2008) studied the effect of temperature at different food/microorganisms (F/M) ratios on batch hydrogen production from mixed FW using anaerobic digestion sludge as the inoculum. F/M ratios of 7–10gVS/gVSS were found to be adequate for hydrogen production via thermophilic (50°C) fermentation (maximum yield=57mlH2/gVS at F/M=7), while under mesophilic (35°C) conditions hydrogen generation was decreased (maximum yield=39mlH2/gVS at F/M=6)."
6,pH,"3.4 pH The influence of pH on hydrogen fermentation is also quite controversial in the literature. In general, pH is considered the most pivotal parameter due to its effects on hydrogenase activity, metabolic pathways as well as substrate hydrolysis. The H+ ion concentration in the system is also critical for maintaining adequate ATP levels in the system, since in the presence of an H+ excess ATP is used to ensure cell neutrality rather than to produce H2 (Nazlina et al., 2011). Several studies have been conducted on the optimal pH range for fermentative hydrogen production, however the results are often inconsistent due to differences in substrate, seed sludge and operating conditions adopted (Luo et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2010). In this regard it should be mentioned that numerous literature studies report the results of fermentation runs where only the initial pH was adjusted, without any further control along the process. However, it is noted that the importance of the initial pH may be overlooked when making direct comparison of results obtained at given initial pH values, since several factors – among the others, substrate characteristics (composition and buffer capacity) and type of inoculum – dictate the prevailing metabolic pathways and in turn pH evolution during the process, thus determining different hydrogen production yields and rates. It is acknowledged that low pHs result in inhibition of the hydrogenase activity, which is regarded to as a key factor explaining the influence of pH on fermentative hydrogen production (Khanal et al., 2004; Nazlina et al., 2011). The metabolic pathways involving acetate and butyrate production appear to be favored in the pH range 4.5–6.0, while neutral or higher pHs are believed to promote ethanol and propionate production (Guo et al., 2010a; Rechtenbach et al., 2008; Rechtenbach and Stegmann, 2009). It should also be mentioned that hydrogen is mainly produced during the exponential growth phase of Clostridia, while in the stationary growth phase a shift from acidogenesis (with associated hydrogen generation) to solvent production is observed. It has been suggested (Khanal et al., 2004) that the shift occurs below pH 4.5, more precisely at pHs as low as 4.1, and the cause seems to involve the buildup of VFAs and H2 during the exponential growth phase. Solventogenesis is therefore assumed as a detoxification method of the biomass to avoid inhibitory effects caused by high VFA contents and associated low pHs in the liquid solution (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). However, other researchers observed a shift to solventogenesis at pH levels above 5.7, due to the synthesis or activation of the enzymes required for solvent production (Khanal et al., 2004). To this regard, Fang et al. (2006) observed a switch to solventogenesis occurring at pHs>6.5. Other authors (Nazlina et al., 2011) indicated that decreasing pH below 6.0 increasingly promoted lactate formation, with an associated negative effect on the hydrogen production yield. The system pH may also affect the degree of biomass activity, with values <6 capable of significantly inhibiting sulfate-reducing and methane-producing microorganisms. As far as homoacetogenic microorganisms are concerned, the effect of pH is not clear. Luo et al. (2010) observed homoacetogenesis inhibition at pHs of 4–5; however, since some homoacetogenic bacteria belong to the genus Clostridium, pH values in this range do not necessarily lead to inhibition. The initial pH is known to affect hydrogen production through its influence on lag phase duration, spore germination (in those cases where a shock treatment is preliminary applied to the inoculum) and the synthesis of enzymes (Kim et al., 2011c). Khanal et al. (2004) found that an initial pH of 4.5 gave the highest specific hydrogen production potential for sucrose and starch, but it was accompanied by the lowest production rate and longest lag phase; at higher initial pHs, hydrogen production started earlier and with a higher production rate, but with a shorter overall duration. In the same study it was also observed that the lower the initial pH, the higher the maximum acetate/butyrate ratio was. However, Abreu et al. (2009) investigated hydrogen production from arabinose using four different anaerobic sludge samples at different initial pHs (4.5–8.0), and in all cases observed higher hydrogen production potentials as the initial pH increased. In the investigation of the effect of initial pH on hydrogen production from FW, batch tests are reported in the literature with values typically varying between 5 and 9 (Lay et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008a, 2011c; Zhu et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2009a; Zong et al., 2009), without any further control during the test. However, different batch and semi-continuous/continuous experiments involved pH adjustment during operation, with set-point values between 5 (Liu et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Nazlina et al., 2011) and 7 (Hong and Haiyun, 2010), but most commonly in the narrower range of 5–5.5 (Alzate-Gaviria et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2008a,b, 2010; Lee and Chung, 2010; Li et al., 2008b; Lee et al., 2010b; Liu et al., 2006). The pH values on FW were often adopted by these authors from other studies on simple substrates such as glucose. In the case of FW and OFMSW, relatively few experiments have been conducted to compare the effect of pH on hydrogen production. Shin et al. (2004) investigated fermentative hydrogen production from FW at pH 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5 under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions; the best results in terms of cumulative H2 production were attained at pHs of 4.5 and 5.5 under thermophilic conditions. Shin and Youn (2005) studied the performance of a semi-continuous system under thermophilic conditions at pHs of 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0, with a value of 5.5 yielding the best performance. The influence of the initial (5.0–8.0) and operating (5.0–6.5) pH on hydrogen production from FW by Clostridium beijerinckii KCTC 1785 was investigated by Kim et al. (2008a); the optimal values were found to be an initial pH of 7.0 and an operating pH of 5.5, with associated values of hydrogen yield and rate of 128NmlH2/gCODdegraded and 108NmlH2/lh, respectively. Lee et al. (2008) investigated thermophilic hydrogen production from vegetable FW at pHs of 5.5–7.0, obtaining a maximum production rate of 0.48mmolH2/gVSh at pH=6, and a maximum yield of 0.57mmolH2/gCOD at pH=7; no hydrogen production was observed at pH=5.5. Batch tests on a mixture of FW, olive mill wastewater (OMW) and WAS (the latter with or without HST), were performed at pHs in the range 4.5–7.5 (Cappai et al., 2010). The best performance with the untreated inoculum was observed at pH=6.5, with a cumulative hydrogen production of 42.9NlH2/kgVS, which was also accompanied by the highest hydrogen content 51% by vol. in the biogas. Using the HST inoculum, the best results were obtained at pHs of 6.5 and 7.0 with production yields of around 60NlH2/kgVS (5.6NlH2/lreactor), while the highest hydrogen content in the biogas was measured at a pH of 7.5, with values up to 80% by vol. The higher hydrogen contents at high pHs were likely due to an indirect effect of enhanced CO2 dissolution in the liquid phase under alkaline conditions. A recent study by Nazlina et al. (2011) focused on batch thermophilic (55°C) digestion of FW at controlled pHs of 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0; the lowest H2 production yield (∼18NmlH2/gsubstrate-COD) was observed at pH=5.0, while comparable results (∼63 and ∼61NmlH2/gsubstrate-COD, respectively) were obtained at pHs of 5.5 and 6.0. Higher pH conditions were also found to result in lower lactate production and higher removal of carbohydrates and volatile solids (VS), however these were also accompanied by a decreased concentration of Clostridia in the digestion medium (65% of total biomass as opposed to 92% at pH=5.5), indicating that other microbial phyla may have contributed to H2 production at higher pH levels. Although bacteria were enumerated, the identification of the other phyla was not performed. A significant number of studies involving no external pH control have also been conducted (Han and Shin, 2002, 2004a,b; Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005; Pan et al., 2008; Cappai et al., 2009; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009; Wang and Zhao, 2009). The concept behind this strategy involves appropriate adjustment of the OLR to maintain suitable pH levels for significant and stable hydrogen production. In semi-continuous experiments using completely mixed reactors, pH was maintained in the range 5.5–6.4 through biokinetic control attained by organic overloading (11gVS/kgd; Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). Wang and Zhao (2009) report that a semi-continuous rotating drum reactor was capable of spontaneously maintaining pH within the range 5.2–5.8 at an OLR of 22.65kgVS/m3 d. In another semi-continuous CSTR treating a mixture of FW and OMW, pH was maintained in the range 5.0–6.0 by adopting adequate values of the feed composition (25% w/w FW, 20% w/w OMW, 55% w/w AS), HRT (2d) and OLR (32.3kgVS/m3 d) (Cappai et al., 2009). In a thermophilic two-stage process (combined H2 +CH4 production; Lee et al., 2010b), pH was successfully maintained in the range 5.4–5.7 by recycling the effluent from the methanogenic stage into the acidogenic reactor."
7,Use of co-substrates,"3.5 Use of co-substrates FW and OFMSW have often been considered for co-digestion with other residues, including mainly primary sludge (PS) and WAS, but also wastes from agro-industrial activities. The use of co-substrates is motivated by other objectives being pursued concomitantly, including: (a) combined treatment of different waste streams, (b) ability to treat residues otherwise difficult to manage individually, (c) dilution of potentially toxic/inhibitory compounds, (d) resulting synergistic effects on biomass, (e) optimization of the conditions for hydrogen production, (f) internal control of pH, and (g) optimization of the carbohydrate/protein ratio. To this regard, although carbohydrates are the preferred substrate for fermentative hydrogen-producing bacteria such as those belonging to the Clostridium sp. while hydrogen is hardly produced from proteins and lipids, some experiences showed that, under some circumstances, proteins from waste sludge are necessary as a nitrogen source for hydrogen production in both pure and mixed cultures. In particular, Kim et al. (2004) found out that the addition of SS to FW up to 13–19% by weight enhanced the hydrogen production potential; lately the same authors (Kim et al., 2011a) also indicated an optimal FW/sludge ratio for both the hydrogen production potential and the generation rate, which was equal to 10:1w/w on a COD basis for the experimental conditions tested. Shin et al. (2003) showed that the hydrogen production yield decreased as WAS addition increased, due to the presence of methanogens in the sludge and the low carbohydrate concentration; however, sludge addition also enhanced hydrogen production due to the contribution of proteins. The maximum hydrogen yield of 59.2ml/gVS was achieved at a FW/sludge ratio of 80:20w/w. Zhu et al. (2008) tested different mixtures of FW, PS and WAS and found appropriate mixing ratios of the three substrates to promote hydrogen production (up to a maximum of 112ml/gVSadded) due to an improved balance of carbohydrates, nitrogen, phosphorus and trace metals; moreover, PS and WAS showed a higher buffering capacity at low pHs in comparison to FW. Hong and Haiyun (2010) performed semi-continuous tests on mixtures of FW and dewatered sludge for optimization of the FW/sludge ratio and the operating parameters (HRT, OLR and pH); the best results were obtained for a FW content of 88% by wt., an HRT of 8.92days, an OLR of 8.31g VS/ld and a pH of 6.99. Semi-continuous digestion runs of mixtures of FW and OMW (Cappai et al., 2009) resulted in significant and steady hydrogen production when a proper mixing ratio between the two was adopted; the best results in terms of specific hydrogen production were obtained using 25% w/w FW, 20% w/w OMW and 55% w/w WAS; the latter was used as both the inoculum and the main liquid phase to adjust the water content to wet conditions (∼10% TS); the outflow was successfully subjected to a second methanogenic stage and the final digested product was finally dewatered and composted after mixing with a bulk material."
8,Hydrogen production kinetics,"The evolution of hydrogen production over time in batch conditions is often described using the Gompertz equation, which has been modified from its original formulation to include parameters with a biological rather than a mathematical meaning. The modified Gompertz curve describes the time evolution of hydrogen generation using three parameters, namely the H2 production potential (Ps ), the maximum H2 production rate (Rm ) and the lag time (λ), according to Eq. (6)): (6) P = P s exp - exp R m · e P s ( λ - t ) + 1 In general, to compare experimental results obtained using different types/amounts of wastes as well as various mixing proportions of feed components and F/M ratios, the parameters of the modified Gompertz equation are expressed in specific terms in various ways, typically per unit mass of COD, VS, total solids (TS), hexose or carbohydrate-C from the waste in the case of Ps , and per unit mass of volatile suspended solids (VSS) from the inoculum in the case of Rm . As far as the H2 production potential is concerned, since it has been widely demonstrated that hydrogen production mainly derives from carbohydrates degradation (Lay et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004; Han and Shin, 2004a,b; Argun et al., 2008; Chu et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2009a; Lee and Chung, 2010; Kim et al., 2011a; Nazlina et al., 2011), meaningful specific units are the mass or volume of H2 produced per unit mass of initial or removed carbohydrates (usually expressed in terms of their hexose equivalent). Other, for instance VS-specific, units may be more useful as design parameters, although their value is commonly substrate-dependent. Of course, the fact that the hydrogen production yield is expressed with different measures complicates the comparison of results from different studies, since the required conversion factors are often missing. Typical recently reported values/ranges are: 18–205NlH2/kgVS (Kim et al., 2004, 2011a; Chu et al., 2008); 52.5–360NlH2/kgVSremoved (Gómez et al., 2006; Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005); 10–133NmlH2/gCOD (Kim et al., 2004, 2011a; Lee et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008b); 0.69–2.10molH2/molhexose (Kim et al., 2010, 2011a; Lee and Chung, 2010); 0.87–1.65molH2/molhexoseremoved (Kim et al., 2009); 1.7–5.6NlH2/lreactor (Cappai et al., 2010). Further data on process yields derived from individual studies are reported in Table 3 . To derive more consistent and comparable values for the kinetics of fermentative hydrogen production under varying operating conditions, in the present review the parameters of the modified Gompertz equation were derived from several literature studies available; when Gompertz parameters were not directly provided in the papers, they were calculated through least-square fitting of the experimental hydrogen production data with the theoretical curve (Eq. (6)). The whole set of kinetic parameters was then converted into homogeneous units so as to identify their respective ranges of variation as a function of the process conditions; this was only possible for a reduced number of references, for which the required information about working volumes, as well as relative amounts and composition of the individual mixture components, were provided. The results of the analysis of kinetic parameters are reported in Table 4 . It can be noted that, depending on the specific type of substrate and inoculum used and the operating conditions adopted (F/M ratio, pH control, temperature, addition of nutrients, etc.), both Ps and Rm differ in the literature by up to three orders of magnitude (with maximum values in the ranges 0.2–181NmlH2/gVS for Ps and 0.1–326NmlH2/gVSSh for Rm ), confirming that for optimization of biohydrogen production the relevant process parameters need to be carefully adjusted. For an appropriate evaluation of the process kinetics when comparing data from different experiments, since the values of Ps and Rm are interrelated so that the production rate cannot be interpreted in absolute terms without specifying the value for the associated production potential, an additional parameter, t95 , was introduced. This is assumed to be the time required for hydrogen production to attain 95% of the maximum yield, and was derived from Ps and Rm rearranging the Gompertz function, as indicated by Eq. (7). Since t 95 provides a measure of how fast the maximum production is achieved, it can be usefully adopted to compare, from a kinetic point of view, experimental conditions with different associated hydrogen generation yields. (7) t 95 - λ = P s R m · e ( 1 - ln ( - ln 0.95 ) ) As for the lag phase of the hydrogen production process, the durations reported in recent studies on FW/OFMSW are mostly lower than 20h (Kim et al., 2004; Shin et al., 2003), with minimum values as low as 0.1–1.92h (Kim et al., 2004; Shin et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2008; Cappai et al., 2009). Notably higher values were reported by Lay et al. (2003) for a number of individual FW fractions: 72h for rice and potato, 96h for fat meat. However, shorter durations of the lag phase, namely 2.4h for lettuce, 4.8h for potato and 14.4h for rice were reported by Dong et al. (2009a). The influence of process temperature on the lag phase duration was discussed by Shin et al. (2004), who observed a shorter (0.1–3.6h) lag phase under mesophilic compared to thermophilic conditions (12–14.4h). This was ascribed to the fact that the inoculum was exposed to room temperature before the tests, thus the thermophilic biomass activity was possibly affected by this relatively low temperature. Such findings were confirmed by Pan et al. (2008), who observed lag phase durations of 0.05–4.9h under mesophilic conditions vs. 3.4–5.3h under thermophilic conditions. The biomass acclimation period can also be influenced by pH. This issue was discussed by Shin et al. (2004), who found that, while under thermophilic conditions (55°C) the lag phase duration was not appreciably affected by pH in the range 4.5–6.5, under mesophilic conditions (35°C) increasing pHs resulted in shorter lag phase durations (from 0.1h at pH=6.5 to 3.6h at pH=4.5). These findings were confirmed by Lee et al. (2008), who reported values of 3.8h at pH=6.5–7.0 and 7.9h at pH=6.0. In mesophilic (39°C) batch tests on FW and thermally treated WAS (Cappai et al., 2010), relatively slight differences in the lag phase duration were observed when pH was varied over the range 6.0–7.0, with values ranging from 4.6h at pH 7.0 and 6.3h at pH 7.5. The same authors however found that when digesting a mixture of FW, OMW and untreated WAS, pH exerted a stronger effect on the lag phase duration, with values decreasing from 15.9 to 6.8h as pH increased from 4.5 to 6.5. The influence of different FW pre-treatments on the lag phase duration was investigated by Kim et al. (2009). Shorter lag phases were observed when no pre-treatment was applied (7.3h) or when the waste was maintained at pH=1 for 1d before fermentation (8.3h); longer values (10.0 and 11.9h, respectively) were found for thermal (90°C, 20min) and alkaline (pH=13 for 1d) pre-treatment. The overall duration of the hydrogen production phase was typically observed to range between 1 (Lee et al., 2008; Cappai et al., 2009, 2010; Kim et al., 2009) and 4d (Han and Shin, 2004b; Kim et al., 2004, 2009; Shin et al. 2004; Zong et al., 2009). Values as short as ∼9.5h were reported by Lee et al. (2008) (vegetable FW, pH controlled at 6.5; thermophilic conditions) and Shin et al. (2004) (FW, pH controlled at 5.5 and 6.5, mesophilic conditions). In the same work, when pH was controlled at 4.5 and thermophilic conditions were adopted, a significantly longer duration (5.8d) of hydrogen production was observed; prolonged production periods were also reported by Lay et al. (2003) for individual FW fractions, with values of 8–9d for rice and potato and 6.6d for fat meat."
9,Statistical analysis of hydrogen production data,"4.1 Statistical analysis of hydrogen production data The experimental data of hydrogen production potential (Ps ) from the reviewed literature studies were processed to derive information on the relative importance accommodating for the existing relationships among the main variables of relevance. To this aim, literature data were filtered and, when feasible, reprocessed and converted into homogeneous units as described in Section 4, resulting in 198 individual data points from 15 different publications (Lay et al., 1999; Shin et al., 2003, 2004; Chen et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008; Cappai et al., 2009, 2010, 2011; Kim et al., 2009, 2011a,b; Sreela-or et al., 2011a,b) being used for the statistical regression analysis. The input variables used in the analysis and the associated levels are reported in Table 5 , while the response variable was the hydrogen production potential. The statistical technique known as recursive partitioning was applied for the analysis of data. This was used as a means to build a flexible, parsimonious regression model that can be represented by a binary regression tree; this can also be seen as a way to automatically identify the most important variables affecting the response while accounting for associations among the explanatory variables. A regression tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data set into two homogeneous groups (son nodes) according to some criterion, and then splitting the nodes up further on each of the branches. On each node the response is fitted by the node average, which implies defining a stepwise constant fitted response surface. Recursive partitioning (Hothorn et al., 2006) thus involves separating statistical groups progressively decreasing in size and increasing in internal homogeneity in terms of the statistical distribution of the response variable. In the present case, splitting was implemented using a conditional inference criterion, implying testing the global null hypothesis of independence between any of the input variables and the response. If the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, the splitting procedure at that node is stopped, and this becomes a terminal node of the tree; otherwise, the input variable exhibiting the strongest association with the response (as measured by the corresponding p-value) is selected and a binary split in it is implemented. The splitting procedure continues until each node becomes a terminal node according to the above mentioned condition. The graphical output of the recursive partitioning procedure, which was implemented using the party package in the statistical software R (Strobl et al., 2009), is shown in Fig. 1 . At each terminal node the number of data points (n) and their statistical distribution (indicated by the associated box plots) are provided. The input variables identified as the most important in affecting maximum hydrogen production are: type of co-substrate, type of pre-treatment, operating pH, control of initial pH and fermentation temperature. Six terminal nodes were identified, which differed both for the average value and the distribution of the response variable. The type of co-substrate was found at the highest hierarchical level of the tree, splitting the dataset into two groups, with average Ps values of ∼56NlH2/kgVS on the left branch and ∼25NlH2/kgVS on the right branch. When inspecting the tree towards the left, the type of pre-treatment results in different maximum production yields, with average values ∼43 and ∼66NlH2/kgVS on the right and left branches of node 2, respectively. In synthesis, the highest hydrogen production potential (average value≅87NlH2/kgVS) was found to be attained for the following combination of input variables: Co-substr_type={none, primary+activated sludge, nightsoil+sewage sludge}, pretr_type={thermal} and pH>5.0. On the other hand, the combination of input variables yielding the worst mean response (∼14NlH2/kgVS) was: Co-substr_type={none, primary+activated sludge, nightsoil+sewage sludge}, pretr_type = {none}, pHin_control={none} and Ferm_T ⩽39°C (i.e. mesophilic conditions). As for the general validity of the results of the statistical analysis performed, it should nevertheless be stressed that in some cases (see nodes 4, 5 and 7 in Fig. 1) the dispersion of data around the corresponding value (the node mean) was appreciable. As the objective of the analysis was to assess the relative relevance of the identified input variables on the yield of the fermentation process, this feature is not deemed to affect the findings of the analysis. Nonetheless, this feature may suggest the presence of hidden variables which may explain the residual heterogeneity within the individual terminal nodes. Unfortunately, the information that can be retrieved from literature data is not sufficient to resolve such an ambiguity. However, the obtained results appear to suggest that, in order to allow for comparison of data from different literature sources and build reliable predictive models for the fermentative hydrogen production process, a high level of consistency between data is strictly required. This requires both a harmonization of the way in which the parameters of interest for the process are expressed and a more accurate description of the experimental conditions adopted in the fermentative H2 literature."
10,Hybrid processes,"Although according to some authors (Lee and Chung, 2010) fermentative hydrogen production from FW may be economically viable, it is also generally acknowledged that, since the majority of the organic content of the original substrate remains undegraded, the process should be combined with a second treatment stage to achieve substrate stabilization and increase energy conversion. The second stage may thus be oriented to producing either additional hydrogen or methane, with a variety of potential alternatives differing in the type of process applied and/or the characteristics of the resulting product (Fig. 2 ). On one instance the residual organic content of the waste feed, which is mainly in the form of the soluble products from the hydrolytic stage, may be converted into methane in a second-stage reactor where suitable environmental conditions for methanogens are maintained. Alternatively, the hydrogen content still stored in the effluent from the first stage may be further exploited through other biological processes including photo-fermentation or microbial electro-hydrogenogenesis. As for combined two-stage biological H2 +CH4 production, which is one of the most common strategies proposed, the overall anaerobic digestion process can be described by the Eq. (8): (8) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 4 + 4 CO 2 + 4 H 2 If the energy conversion efficiency of the process is calculated through Eq. (4), assuming a lower heating value of 801kJ/mol for methane, a value of 89.0% is obtained. Considering the conventional single-stage methane production process (C6H12O6 →3CH4 +3CO2), a conversion yield of 83.2% would be obtained. This supports the assumption that combined H2 +CH4 production is, from a theoretical point of view, energetically more favorable than conventional anaerobic digestion (Dong et al., 2011). Combined H2 +CH4 production from FW has been studied through semi-continuous or continuous tests (Cappai et al., 2009; Chu et al., 2008; Han and Shin, 2004a,b; Lee and Chung, 2010; Lee et al., 2010b; Liu et al., 2006; Wang and Zhao, 2009). As mentioned above, HRT and OLR values for the methanogenic stage vary in the ranges 4–27d and 3–8kgVS/m3 d (Wang and Zhao, 2009) or 4–16kg COD/m3 d (Lee et al., 2010a,b; Chu et al., 2008). While in most studies single-stage methane production was conducted under mesophilic conditions (typically 37°C) (Han and Shin, 2004a,b; Liu et al., 2006; Zong et al., 2009), combined H2 +CH4 generation from FW was also investigated under thermophilic (55°C) conditions (Lee et al., 2010b). Irrespective of whether inoculum was pre-treated (Chu et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006; Wang and Zhao, 2009) or used as received (Han and Shin, 2004a,b; Lee and Chung, 2010; Lee et al., 2010b), the two-stage process was found to be capable of significant H2 +CH4 production. To this regard, Liu et al. (2006) observed that 100°C HST of the inoculum did not adversely affect the methanogenic stage. CH4 yields were reported to fall within the range 460–550Nl/kgVS (Chu et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006; Wang and Zhao, 2009). Although few studies compared conventional single-stage methane production and two-stage H2 +CH4 production, Liu et al. (2006) found that under semi-continuous conditions the latter process generated 21% more methane, and, as expected, a much lower amount of VFAs in the final effluent. Interesting economic considerations were derived by Lee and Chung (2010), who managed a two-stage pilot-scale H2 +CH4 fermentation process treating FW, connected to a fuel cell. Comparing H2-only fermentation, CH4-only fermentation, and combined H2 +CH4 fermentation, while negligible differences in production costs among the three systems were estimated, an increase in energy production by 12–25% was observed for the combined system. Further hydrogen production may also be derived by combining dark fermentation with photo-fermentation. Purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria are capable of using short-chain organic acids as electron donors to generate H2 through a light-driven metabolism; thus, the metabolic products of dark fermentation represent a potential substrate for photo-fermentative bacteria. Zong et al. (2009) studied a two-stage batch process including dark- and photo-fermentation in order to produce hydrogen from FW. Cattle dung compost mixed with water (1:10 w/v) and heat-treated for 15min was used as the inoculum for dark fermentation, whilst R. sphaeroides ZX-5 was used as the inoculum for photo-fermentation. Acetate, butyrate and butanol were found to be consumed during 168-h photo-fermentation. The hydrogen yield achieved in the individual stages of dark and photo-fermentation was 1.77 and 3.63mol/mol hexose, respectively, with an overall yield of 5.4molH2/molhexose, equivalent to a conversion efficiency of 45%. Bio-electrochemical systems have also been proposed as methods to couple with fermentative hydrogen production. Among these, microbial electrolysis cells (MECs, initially developed by Liu et al., 2005) are based on microbially-mediated oxidation of organic substances in an anodic compartment, with the aid of an external circuit where an external power supply is provided. The electrons generated by the degradation process are transferred through the external circuit to a cathodic compartment, while protons are transferred through the ion exchange membrane that separates the two compartments. In the cathodic compartment electrons reduce the protons generated by the biological process or from dissociated water, producing H2 (Liu et al., 2005; Logan et al., 2008; Jeremiasse et al., 2010). For electrochemically-driven hydrogen production to occur in such systems, it has been demonstrated that a voltage needs to be applied, which theoretically amounts to 0.14V if acetate is assumed as the reference organic substrate (Logan et al., 2008). Although to the authors’ knowledge there are no specific examples in the literature of combination of dark fermentation and MECs for hydrogen production from FW, some studies exist of application to different types of either pure or residual substrates, including pure VFAs (Guo et al., 2010a,b; Kyazze et al., 2010; Manuel et al., 2010; Cheng and Logan, 2011), wastewaters (Lu et al., 2009), lignocellulosic materials (corn stover [Lalaurette et al., 2009], cellulose [Wang et al., 2011]), wheat powder (Tuna et al., 2009). However, since the nature of the metabolic products of acidogenesis is similar for different types of source substrates and MECs have been found capable of using different substrates including fermentable and non-fermentable organics, the results of the mentioned studies suggest the feasibility of a two-stage dark fermentation+MEC process for combined hydrogen production from FW/OFMSW. Another candidate process for a second-stage treatment after dark fermentation is the generation of electric current through microbial fuel cells (MFCs), where bacteria catalyze the oxidation of organic acids from the acidogenic phase of dark fermentation. If the electrons generated by the oxidation reactions are transferred from the anode (biological compartment) to a cathode through an external circuit, the electron flow produces electricity (Logan et al., 2006). In the literature, studies are documented of combination of dark fermentation and MFCs, using either pure substrates such as glucose (Sharma and Li, 2010), synthetic dark fermentation effluent (Poggi-Varaldo et al., 2009; Vázquez-Larios et al., 2011), cellulose (Wang et al., 2011) and vegetable waste (Mohanakrishna et al., 2010). In their study on vegetable waste, Mohanakrishna et al. (2010) found that the MFC performance was improved when the system was fed with the pre-fermented waste instead of the untreated waste. This can be ascribed to the fact that adequate MFC operation requires hydrolysis of particulate organic matter to make this available to the biomass."
11,Conclusions and perspectives,"The analysis of over 80 literature references on fermentative hydrogen production from FW and OFMSW has shown that numerous process parameters have the potential of affecting the evolution of the metabolic pathways involved, in turn affecting the process kinetics and the conversion yield. As indicated by the review performed, the main parameters of concern include pH, temperature, solids retention time, inoculum addition/type/pre-treatment, presence of co-substrates, reactor configuration, reactor operation mode, combination with additional processes. The strong influence exerted by the individual parameters mentioned as well as the existence of mutual interactions can in fact lead to variations up to three orders of magnitude in process performance depending on the specific combination of the operating variables adopted. At present, given the existing uncertainties about the individual and joint influence of such parameters, prediction of full-scale reactors performance based on the existing data may turn out to be unreliable, therefore further systematic study on this issue is strongly recommended. As to the process indicators, a variety of parameters have been proposed in the literature which have been used to evaluate the process performance from different perspectives, spanning from the production potential to the process kinetics, from the biogas composition to the energy conversion efficiency. Accordingly, parameters including the specific production potential, the production rate, the time required to attain a given fraction of the maximum production, the H2 content in the biogas, the energy conversion yield are typically adopted as process performance indicators. In the authors’ opinion, care should be taken when adopting a given indicator in place of another to monitor the process efficiency as well as when using specific parameters to compare results obtained under different operating conditions. For example, some parameters are strictly dependent on the intrinsic characteristics of the substrate concerned, and as such should not be used for comparison purposes unless considering the same type of substrate. Secondly, for a reliable assessment of the overall performance of the fermentation process to be attained, the use of multiple parameters appears to be recommended, so as to account for the complexity and the interrelations between the numerous factors of concern. With regard to the above mentioned issues, the authors believe that some considerable effort should be made by the scientific community to harmonize the description methods adopted, with the aim of allowing comparison of results from different sources and gaining an improved understanding of the numerous interrelations between the underlying factors which govern the fermentation process. It is believed that this may also help explaining the controversies currently found in the results obtained using different approaches and methods, resolving apparently contrasting conclusions derived from such results. As to the implementation potential of fermentative hydrogen production, although the technical feasibility in case of processing of simple substrates has been demonstrated by many papers, the technology still appears to be in an early stage (especially for complex substrates), and to the authors’ knowledge no single full scale plant is operative yet. For such reasons, considerable efforts appear to be required to assess the potential for full-scale application of the process, from both a technical and a global economic perspective. Nevertheless, a number of issues may be mentioned in regard to the technical feasibility of the process on the basis of the state of the art of knowledge to date. In general, it is believed that the technology would have a rather limited scope if complex organic matter could not be effectively used as the substrate; furthermore, an expanded number of substrate types and the use of mixed cultures as the inoculum would drastically improve the chance of successful development of the process. To this regard, several experiences have demonstrated that appreciable hydrogen production from FW and OFMSW can be attained using the indigenous biomass present in the substrate. An issue which deserves significant attention specifically from an engineering point of view is the possibility of optimizing the process performance by appropriately adjusting process configuration and operation, with no need for external control of the operating variables or for application of severe conditions. In regard to the technical sustainability of biohydrogen production, it is generally acknowledged that since fermentation alone converts, already under optimal conditions, no more than 33% of the chemical energy contained in substrate (whatever this may be), the process should be combined with a second treatment stage aimed at improved substrate stabilization and enhanced energy conversion. The residual organic content of the waste feed, which is mainly in the form of soluble products of the hydrolytic stage (organic acids and alcohols), may beneficially be converted into methane in a second-stage reactor. Alternatively, the hydrogen content which is still stored in the effluent from the first stage may be recovered through other biological processes including photo-fermentation or microbial electro-hydrogenogenesis. Both the mentioned alternatives to methanogenesis are still at a relatively early stage and as such deserve further investigation."
