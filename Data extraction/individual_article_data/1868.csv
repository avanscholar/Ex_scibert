0,Introduction,"Syngas to liquid products conversion reactions (methanol, Fischer–Tropsch and higher alcohols synthesis) are highly exothermic, with heats of the reaction varying between −70 and −270 kJ/mol of ethanol, depending on the reaction pathway [1]. The excess heat must be removed during the reaction to control process temperatures, maximize yields, and minimize catalyst deactivation by sintering. Therefore, design strategies for higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) reactors are governed by the thermodynamic nature of the reaction i.e., need for high pressure and controlled reaction temperature [2]. Commercially there are two types of syngas conversion reactors i.e., multi-tubular fixed bed reactors and Slurry-phase reactors. Recently, monolithic reactors have gained much attention for gas to liquid technologies owing to superior heat and mass transfer properties [3]. For the highly exothermic Fischer–Tropsch synthesis reactions, monolithic reactors have provided significant benefits over conventional packed bed reactors [4]. Monolithic structures or supports provide compelling advantages for a highly exothermic reactions including direct conduction pathways for heat, a mechanism not available to random packings which only have point contacts between (and often within) the pellets. Compared to random packing, reactors with structured catalysts have much better control over voidage, pressure drop, fluid mechanics and heat transfer [5]. Moulijn and coworkers [6] noted that structured packings enable intrinsic reaction kinetics to be decoupled from mass and heat transport. Monolithic structure may consist of an inert support structure like alumina-based ceramics (e.g., zeolites), carbon materials etc. The catalyst particles can be impregnated over engineered channels of desired shapes and dimensions [7,8]. Monoliths are mainly produced via extrusion (the material is pushed through a die of the desired cross-section). In the recent years, three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing has provided the flexibility to tune the channel size, amount of solid phase, void space, and wall thickness through a computer aided design (CAD). The concentrated inks of desired rheological behavior are extruded through a nozzle. A computer controlled positioning system govern the deposition of multiple two-dimensional layers on top of each other to obtain a 3D structure [9]. The printer inks can be made of a variety of materials including zeolites, polymers or colloidal systems [10]. The commercially applied zeolite, ZSM-5 (MFI type) have great potential as a catalytic material for chemical industry [11,12] owing to their ability to withstand harsh operating conditions (temperature, pressure) within reaction environment [13]. The properties of ZSM-5 type zeolites (Si/Al ratio, acidity and pore-size distribution) can be easily tuned to achieve desired products selectivity [14,15]. For the conversion of syngas to higher carbon number alcohols the catalysts can be classified into four categories: namely, noble metal (Rhodium) based catalyst, modified methanol synthesis catalysts [16], modified Fischer–Tropsch synthesis catalysts [17] and molybdenum-based catalyst. Molybdenum-based catalysts in the form of oxides, sulphides and carbides [18] are promising alternatives to the costly rhodium-based catalysts for alcohols synthesis. With the addition of O, S, C or N ligands the modified electronic and/or geometric structure of the Mo surface unveiled a different catalytic behavior for CO hydrogenation reaction. Molybdenum oxides/carbides/sulphides are not selective towards higher alcohols unless they are promoted with appropriate additives such as alkali metals or alkaline earth metals. Addition of alkali promoters improve the total alcohols selectivity by providing CO insertion sites (Mo4+) for alkyl species obtained by CO dissociation over Mo0-2+. But the relative alcohols selectivity remains in the order methanol > ethanol > propanol > butanol, as alkyl radical chain growth probability (ASF distribution) is not affected by alkali addition [19]. According to various studies [20,21], Fischer-Tropsch elements (Ni, Fe, Co) have exhibited the ability to change ASF distribution of alcohols by enhancing the carbon chain growth. In this study, molybdenum-based catalyst was incorporated onto ZSM5 by 3D printing to demonstrate properties of structured catalysts for syngas to higher alcohols. Advances in material science have led to numerous ways of making such micro/meso/macro hierarchal structures, which can be readily printed [22,23]. Using the 3D printing, various desired geometries can be fabricated [24,25]. To control diffusion lengths, one must manipulate catalyst porosity and nozzle diameter which also affect the length of the flow channels and the bulk residence time. In this study, the catalyst precursors (K, Mo, Co) were impregnated over external part of the monolith via hydrothermal process to minimize diffusion limitations. In the present work, we have demonstrated a facile route for scaling-up MFI zeolite (ZSM-5) monolith using inorganic binders (Ludox, Bentonite). The monolith was made by printing the zeolite/binders gel via robocasting. The catalyst precursors (K, Mo, Co) incorporated in two different ways. The detailed morphology was studied via Nitrogen Physisorption, and SEM elemental mapping. The resulting monolith was tested for carbon monoxide hydrogenation into higher carbon number alcohols at 60 bar and 270 °C. The effect of space velocity was compared for the conventional impregnated catalyst vs 3D printed zeolite monolith."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The hydrothermal synthesis of ZSM5 zeolites was conducted by following the method reported by Davis and co-workers [14]. In a typical synthesis method, the precursors sodium hydroxide, ludox and sodium aluminate were mixed in a suitable quantity to obtain desired Si/Al ratio with tetrapropyl ammonium bromide as structure directing agent. The gel was placed under hydrothermal conditions at 180 °C for 48 h. The hydrothermally treated zeolite gel was washed with 400 ml of de-ionized water and dried under air at 100 °C for 24 h. Final zeolite powder was obtained by calcination under air at 550 °C (heating ramp rate 0.5 °C per min) for 12 h. The metal precursors ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O (99.98%, Aldrich), Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (99.9% Aldrich) and alkali promoter (Potassium Nitrate, 99–100%, Aldrich) were impregnated over powdered zeolite samples via stirring and drying at 80 °C. Finally, the particles were calcined under N2 flow at 400 °C for 3 h denoted as KMoCo-Z20, KMoCo-Z50, KMoCo-Z100 (20 wt% Mo, 10 wt% Co) and K/Mo = 0.06. In the one-step approach for the preparation of zeolite monolith, the 5 g of selected zeolite sample KMoCo-Z100 (20 wt % Mo, 10 wt% Co) and K/Mo = 0.06 were mixed with binders Ludox ® (HS-40 colloidal silica 40 wt% suspension in H2O, Aldrich) and Bentonite (BENTONIL ®, Clarient) in a weight ratio 5:1:5, denoted as KMoCo-Z100 (monolith). Another sample of printing gel was prepared with the same composition with the addition of Starch (2 g), denoted as KMoCo-Z100 (monolith – starch). Three dimensional (3D) monolith was printed using a Hyrel 3D (Engine SR) printer equipped with EMO-25 extruder (cold flow) with a nozzle diameter of 500 µm. The printed samples were dried at room temperature conditions for 24 h, prior to subjecting to heat-treatment (400 °C for 5 h 1 °C/min, under nitrogen flow). In the two-step approach of printing zeolite monolith, 10 g of zeolite sample (ZSM5 – Si/Al = 100) was mixed with binders (Bentonite, Ludox) in the weight ratio 10:2:10 to prepare printing gel. The viscosity of gel was modified by adding water and starch. Three dimensional (3D) monolith was printed using a Hyrel 3D (Engine SR) printer equipped with EMO-25 extruder (cold flow) with a nozzle diameter of 500 µm. The 3D printed monolith was dried at room temperature for 24 h and then calcined at 550 °C (2 °C/min) for 5 h under air. The metal precursors solution was prepared by mixing ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O (99.98%, Aldrich), Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (99.9% Aldrich) and alkali promoter (Potassium Nitrate, 99–100%, Aldrich) in 30 ml of de-ionized water (solution A). 2 g of glucose was dissolved in 30 ml H2O (solution B). Solution A and B were mixed and previously calcined ZSM-5 monolith (5 g weight) immersed in an autoclave for hydrothermal synthesis at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting monolith was dried under air for 12 h and calcined under N2 at 400 °C for 3 h. The as prepared monolith was denoted as 3D-KMoCo-Z100. For comparison purpose, an equal amount of metal precursors (Mo: 11%, Co: 4%; K/Mo = 0.06 wt%) was impregnated over powdered ZSM (KMoCo-Z100 powder)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-rays diffraction analysis was conducted using a Rigaku Miniflex X-ray unit with Cu Kα radiation with 2θ range of 5° to 80° and a step count rate of 1.2° per minute. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at °196 °C using a Micrometrics Tristar ІІ 3020 system. The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) method and pore size distribution using BJH model on desorption isotherm curve. Before analysis, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 °C. Scanning electron microscopy secondary electron (SE) and backscattering (BSC) images was obtained using a JEOL Model JSM-6610 SEM. X-ray microanalysis point analyzes and maps were collected on the SEM using an Oxford Instruments X-Max 50 mm2 silicon drift detector (Model 51-XMX0002 1311) in combination with Oxford Aztec Version 3.2 SP1 software (with installed EDS, Truemap, and Quantmap modules). Optical images were taken using Olympus BX61 Light Microscope equipped with the DP70 camera. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis in a Varian Vista Pro ICPOES instrument was used for elemental analysis. The samples were digested using a milestone Ethos 1 microwave digester. Acid site strength of the catalyst samples were measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD), in an AutoChem II 2920."
4,Catalyst evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation The catalysts were evaluated for higher alcohols synthesis reaction in a continuous high-pressure stainless steel tubular reactor. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were reduced at 450 °C under hydrogen flow. The reaction was carried out at 270 °C and 60 bar with syngas (H2/CO = 2), the space velocity was maintained at 3000 h−1 (0.8 g catalyst and 40 ml/min of syngas). The liquid products (alcohols and other oxygenates) were analyzed by GC-FID (Shimadzu, GC 2010) using capillary column (HP INNOWAX). The gases (CH4, CO2, N2, H2, CO) were analyzed by online GC equipped with TCD detector (Shimadzu, GC 2014) using packed column (ShinCarbon 50/80). The conversion was calculated from the molar flow rates of carbon monoxide (CO) in (F CO in) and out (F CO out) of the reactor: X CO = F CO in − F CO out F CO in × 100 The selectivity of component ‘i’ is calculated by dividing molar flow rate of the component Fi out to the amount of carbon monoxide converted to the reaction products. S i = F i out F CO in − F CO out × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Screening of powdered KMoCo zeolite samples,"3.1 Screening of powdered KMoCo zeolite samples Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of KMoCo catalysts supported over ZSM5. Characteristic diffraction peaks of MFI zeolite structure were observed. Unknown peaks (black squares in the XRD patterns, Fig. 1) were found from the XRD patterns of KMoCo-Z50 and KMoCo-Z100. Compared to other samples, KMoCo-Z20 exhibited a diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.3° with high intensity which is a characteristic peak of MoO3. The relative crystallinity of this phase might be lower in other samples giving a broad reflection. The surface properties of the catalyst samples have been summarized in Table 1 . All the metal impregnated (KMoCo) zeolites samples exhibited high surface area making them an interesting alternative for catalytic applications. The catalytic performance of three zeolites samples with different Si/Al ratios (20, 50 and 100) has been summarized in Fig. 2 . It can be observed that the carbon monoxide conversion decreased from 62% to 54% with the gradual decrease in surface acidity of the samples (Z20 >Z50 >Z100). On the other hand the sample with minimum surface acidity (KMoCo-Z100) was the most selective towards higher alcohols. The reason may be attributed to the alcohols dehydration via acidic sites [26]."
7,One-step approach for KMoCo Zeolite 3D monolith,"3.2 One-step approach for KMoCo Zeolite 3D monolith Based on the catalytic performance of KMoCo – Z100 (54% CO conversion and 34%; C2+ OH selectivity) we prepared the printing gel by mixing KMoCo-Z100 catalyst with and without the addition of starch. Previously we have reported carbon supported MoOx-3D printed structures using starch in which starch was used as binder as well as catalyst support [27,28]. In this study, printable extrudate was prepared without starch to determine whether porous 3D monolith can be produced. Fig. 3 presents optical images of printed KMoCo-Z100 without starch-binder. The 3D monolith was sliced vertically to observe internal cracks and integrity of the structure. As shown, the structure maintained its shape even after slicing and no visible cracks were observed (Fig. 3b). The monolith was ground and the resultant powder was analyzed by TEM to illustrate catalyst dispersion and porosity at nanoscale. From Fig. 3c, we can clearly observe catalyst particles with sizes ~100 nm dispersed onto non-porous support. Furthermore, the nitrogen-physisorption results revealed BET surface area of 3 m2/g indicating dense and non-porous nature of the 3D monolith. Zeolite micro-porosity was not depicted during the TEM analysis possibly due to the low resolution. Addition of starch to the printable extrudate led to the formation of porous 3D monolith (Fig. 4 ). However as seen from optical images, the structure shows visible cracks and non-uniform channeling. TEM images showed porous support and homogenous distribution of catalyst particles (Fig. 4d). EDX spectra of the samples shown in Fig. 4d revealed high concentration of aluminum, silicon and molybdenum and weak intensity corresponding to cobalt and potassium (Supplementary file, S1). These results indicate that the starch has an impact onto nano-scale distribution of catalyst particles but ineffective in terms of macro-scale integrity. For high catalyst activity, porosity and large surface area are the main favorable attributes thus, starch was selected provide optimum porosity and homogeneity in the following experiments. The monolithic structure exhibited low surface area (22 m2/g) and collapsed before bringing to the reaction conditions. These observations confirmed that one-step approach for KMoCo – Z100 printing produced undesirable catalyst characteristics."
8,Two-step approach for KMoCo Zeolite 3D monolith,"3.3 Two-step approach for KMoCo Zeolite 3D monolith Following the experiments in Section 3.2, we observed that one-step approach for printing KMoCo-Z100 powders could be challenging, as the method would not allow retaining monolithic structure and controlling catalyst particles dispersion. Thus, ‘two-step approach’ for printing KMoCo-Zeolite monolith was adopted. In the first step, the printing gel was prepared by mixing zeolite powder and the binders (as described in Section 2.1). The catalysts MoCo and K-promotors were incorporated during the second step under hydrothermal conditions following the experimental steps shown in Scheme 1 . Fig. 5 depicts the SEM image of calcined zeolite monolith. The decomposition of starch during calcination under air, created macro-pores inside zeolite scaffold. Whereas, the inorganic binders (bentonite and ludox) provided a uniformly structured zeolite monolith. The molybdenum-cobalt crystals have grown over the as prepared monolith using glucose as reducing agent. The detailed morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy, SEM elemental mapping and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. When the reaction rate is very fast, diffusional resistances can dominate the entire reactor performance [29]. In order to minimize diffusion limitations and prevent blockage of active sites (MoO2 and Co) by binder molecules, the metal nanoparticles were ex-situ grown over as prepared monolith using glucose as reducing agent. The ex-situ growth of metal precursors during hydrothermal synthesis resulted in uniformly dispersed micro-rods over zeolite monolith. At the same time, the monolithic structure remained intact during hydrothermal synthesis of metal particles (Fig. 6 ). The composition of micro-rods was confirmed by SEM elemental mapping of cobalt and molybdenum. The distinctly visible cobalt and molybdenum species within the SEM elemental maps corroborated a synergism between molybdenum and cobalt active sites within the micro-rods (Fig. 7 ). The surface area and porosity of as prepared and metal grown monolith were analyzed by nitrogen physisorption (Table 2 ). The macropores in the range from 0.001 to 0.1 µm were observed. In order to locate the existence of metal crystallites within macropores of the monolith, we performed the SEM mapping of sliced area, but no molybdenum or cobalt species were identified (Fig. 8 )."
9,Catalytic performance of KMoCo Z100 monolith,"3.4 Catalytic performance of KMoCo Z100 monolith In order to evaluate the catalytic performance of KMoCo Z100 monolith for higher alcohols synthesis reaction, the reaction was carried out at 270 °C, 60 bar 3000 GHSV with syngas (H2/CO = 2). For comparison purpose, an equal amount of metal precursors (Mo: 11%, Co: 4%; K/Mo = 0.06 wt%) was impregnated over ZSM5 (KMoCo Z100 – Powdered). Fig. 9 describes the carbon monoxide conversion as a function of gas hourly space velocity (feed flow-rate). A similar level of carbon monoxide conversion was achieved at GHSV of 3000 h−1 in case of monolithic and powdered zeolite catalyst. However, with an increase in space velocity (6000 and 9000 h−1) the carbon monoxide conversion dropped drastically over KMoCo Z100 – Powder. On the other hand, the monolithic KMoCo Z100, maintained its activity with a reasonable level of carbon monoxide conversion (35%) even at 9000 h−1 GHSV. The selectivity data (CO2 free basis) of monolithic and powdered KMoCo Z100 has been summarized in Fig. 10 . The selectivity of methane (28%) and methanol (35%) was significantly high over powdered KMoCo Z100. At the same time, 29% selectivity towards C2+OH was observed with 8% selectivity of iso-alcohols. Conversely, the monolithic KMoCo Z100 revealed an improved selectivity towards higher alcohols (56 %, CO2 free basis). The catalytic conversion of syngas into higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) involves multiple intermediate steps occurring synergistically on different catalytic sites [19]. A schematic representation of higher alcohols synthesis mechanism has been described in Scheme 2 . The carbon monoxide dissociates to form alkyl radical which grows via C–C coupling. At the same time, the non-dissociative CO couples with alkyl radical and gets hydrogenated to form C2+ alcohols. The elemental mapping of micro-rods over zeolite monolith revealed a homogeneous distribution of Mo and Co active sites. In case of KMoCo Z100 monolith, the ex-situ grown micro-rods enabled surface reaction of higher alcohols formation. Alongside, the uniform channels and macropores of zeolite monolith provided shape selectivity for desired alcohols products. On contrary, powdered-KMoCo Z100 promoted side reactions for hydrocarbon formation and iso-alcohols. Moreover, the diffusional limitations were minimized over structured monolith which provided better access to catalytic active sites, resulting in higher level of carbon monoxide conversion compared to powdered KMoCo Z100."
10,Conclusions,"The present study was aimed to fabricate zeolite based monolithic structure with active metal sites for higher alcohols synthesis. A highly porous but robust monolithic structure was obtained by 3D printing zeolite extrudate followed by calcination of inorganic binders (SiO2, Bentonite and starch). Ex-situ grown catalytic sites (MoO2 – Co) enabled surface reaction for higher alcohols formation. The macro-meso porous structure of zeolite promoted CO hydrogenation into desired alcohol products. The interconnected geometric channels of catalyst monolith enabled fast diffusion of reactant/product molecules from catalytic active centers. At the same time, the ex-situ growth of catalyst nanoparticles over monolith prevented the blockage of active sites by binder molecules. Highly compact and bi-functional catalyst monoliths can be designed by tuning zeolite acidity & pore size distribution especially for alcohols to ethylene, dimethyl ether and similar products."
