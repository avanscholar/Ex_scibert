0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier to replace conventional fossil fuels due to its high energy conversion rate and air-pollution free products [1]. Electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production is a clean and sustainable technology [2]. As half reaction in water splitting progress, cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great influence on the development of water electrolysis [3]. Theoretically, the equilibrium potential for HER is 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under standard conditions (T = 298 K, PH2 = 1 atm). However, extra energy is required to overcome energy barrier of water splitting to generate hydrogen in actual reaction [4]. Up till now, platinum-based materials are still regarded as the most effective electro-catalyst with low overpotential and excellent kinetics for HER progress [2,5–7]. However, high-cost limits their extensive applications. Recently, considerable numbers of studies have focused on non-noble metals and their derivatives (oxides [8,9], carbides [10–12], nitrides [13,14], sulfides [15–18], phosphides [19,20] and so on). But in terms of performance and stability of catalyst, few of them are superior to platinum catalysts. Thus, noble-group metals are still the most promising choice for HER [21–23]. As members of the same group (VIII), Gibbs free energies of water molecules on iridium (Ir) and rhodium (Rh) surfaces are quite close to that on Pt [24], which means Ir and Rh have great potentials for HER. Besides, heteroatom introducing could change surface properties thus could improve electrochemical activity [25,26]. TMPs have become a hot material in recent years [27–29]. Rhodium phosphide (RhP2) has been reported to be equipped with better HER activity and stability than 20 wt% Pt/C over wide pH range [19]. Iridium phosphide (IrP2) is highly expected to be better than 20 wt% Pt/C for HER [20,30]. In order to fully utilize the activities of catalysts, proper nano carbon materials shall be used as catalyst supports. Although nanoclusters have good nanoscale effect [31–33], they are quite easy to agglomerate during the preparation process. One-dimensional carbon nanofibers (CNFs) made by electrospinning [34–36], which have good electrical conductivity and large specific surface area [37–39], have been considered as another effective catalyst support. Good conductivity means little obstruction for electron migration and large specific surface area could expose more active sites. Both of them contribute positive effects on HER kinetics. In this work, iridium-based 1D carbon nanofibers (Ir-CNFs) were fabricated by electrospinning and following calcination for HER. The effects of Ir contents on catalytic performance in alkaline medium are discussed. Furthermore, iridium diphosphide-based CNFs, i.e., IrP2-CNFs were synthesized and its catalytic performances were evaluated. The results show that Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs have excellent HER performance with overpotentials of 22 mV and 19 mV under the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium. It is worth to note that the Ir concentration in Ir-CNFs is just 10 wt%, lower than that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt loaded on carbon-black). For deep comprehension, HER progresses of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are discussed by density function theory (DFT) calculations."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Iridium (III) chloride (IrCl3, Ir ≥ 63.9%), polyacrylonitrile (PAN, average Mw = 150,000) and phytic acid (PA, 70 wt% in water) were purchased from Aladdin, while N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%), ethyl alcohol (EtOH, 99.5%), sulfuric acid (98% H2SO4) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased on Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, Nafion (5 wt%) and commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on carbon-black) were purchased from Alfa Aesar."
3,Synthesis method,"2.2 Synthesis method Iridium carbon nanofibers (Ir-CNFs) were synthesized by electrospinning and following calcination. 60 mg IrCl3 and 250 mg PAN were added into 5 mL DMF. It was stirred at 50 °C for several hours until the solute was completely dissolved. The precursor solution was loaded in a syringe (5 mL) with a stainless needle (20-gauge, outside diameter is 0.91 mm and inside diameter is 0.58 mm). A metal cylinder sticking with aluminum foil was used as receiver at a distance of 15 cm with the needle tip. Syringe’s feeding speed was 0.002 mm s−1, cylinder’s rotating speed was 180 r min−1, and the spinning voltage was +25 kV. The ambient temperature was set at 35–40 °C to keep the ambient humidity below 50 RH% through the whole spinning process. Then the obtained nanofibers were annealed in a tube furnace. Heat treatment process included three stages: pre-oxidation at 250 °C for 2 h in air, stabilization at 450 °C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere and carbonization at 900 °C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere [40]. The entire process’ heating rate was 5 °C min−1. Iridium diphosphide carbon nanofibers (IrP2-CNFs) were obtained by similar process. 300 μL phytic acid (PA), the phosphorus source, was added into precursor solution. Besides, carbonization temperature was raised to 1000 °C in Ar atmosphere in order to improve the crystallinity of iridium phosphide. The rest steps were consistent with Ir-CNFs."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were carried out to study micro-morphologies of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs. Meanwhile, elements distribution was obtained by high-angle annular dark-filed TEM (HAADF-TEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) elements mapping. Phase composition was examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm at 25 °C). The scan rate was 0.02° step−1 from 10° to 90°. The samples’ metal contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured to provide the information about valence states of iridium before and after phosphide."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction measurements were carried out by standard three electrodes measurement system. Considering that platinum could be ionized during the reaction, graphite electrodes are used as the counter electrodes (CE). Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and Hg/HgO electrode are employed as reference electrodes (RE) in 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 M H2SO4) and 1 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution (1 M KOH), respectively. The bridge solution of SCE is saturated KCl aqueous solution and the corresponding equilibrium potential is 0.241 V vs. RHE. The bridge solution of Hg/HgO electrode is 1 M KOH and the corresponding equilibrium potential is 0.9254 V vs. RHE. The working electrode (WE) was L-type with glassy carbon (GC) core (diameter: 3 mm). The catalysts included pure CNFs without iridium, Ir-CNFs, IrP2-CNFs and the commercial platinum supported on carbon-black (20 wt% Pt/C). The preparation process of working electrode was as follows: 3 mg of each catalysts was dispersed in 480 μL ethanol and 20 μL Nafion by ultrasonic dispersion to form a homogeneous solution. 10 μL of the mixed solution, divided into four times, was dropped on the GC electrode and dried in vacuum at room temperature for 12 h. Total catalyst loading for each investigated electrode is 849 μg cm−2. The polarization curve was measured at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in both acid and alkaline mediums. Potentials in this work were calibrated to potentials vs. RHE and calculated with 60% iR compensation. Tafel curve is plotted by overpotential (η) vs. the logarithm of current density (j) and the linear part at low overpotential is fitted as Tafel equation: η = a + b log (j), where b is Tafel slope and reflects the charge transfer kinetic of HER [41,42]. The smaller Tafel slope is, the better HER performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured under the frequency range of 0.1–100,000 Hz with a 10 mV AC amplitude. The cyclic voltammogram was carried out with scanning voltages range from 0.05 to 0.15 V vs. RHE and the scanning rates were increased from 10 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 with an increase rate of 10 mV s−1. The stability curve, which was shown as potential vs. time, was measured at a fixed current density of 30 mA cm−2 for 24 h."
6,Density function theory calculation,"2.5 Density function theory calculation The calculations were carried out with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [43,44], using the projector augmented wave (PAW) potential [45] and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [46] within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). A semi-empirical van der Waals (vdW) correction proposed by Grimme (DFT-D3) [47] was used to consider the dispersion interactions between the adsorbed molecule and substrate. The valence electrons were expanded with plane waves with a cutoff energy of 450 eV and electronic smearing was introduced within the Methfessel-Paxton method [48] with N = 1 and 0.2 eV. The geometries were optimized using a conjugate-gradient method and the saddle points were determined using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [49] until the force less than 0.02 eV Å−1. The vibrational analyses were further performed to ensure stable structures and transition states. The optimized lattice parameter of Ir bulk is 3.839 Å, which is in agreement with experimental value of 3.834 Å [50]. The monoclinic phase of IrP2 belongs to P21/c point group and the optimized lattice parameters are a = 5.758 Å, b = 5.797 Å, and c = 5.862 Å, similar to the experimental values (a = 5.746 Å, b = 5.791 Å, and c = 5.851 Å) [51,52]. According to the experiment, we constructed two slab models of Ir (1 1 1) and IrP2 (2 0 0) surfaces. The Ir (1 1 1) surface was modeled by a four-layer slabs, which has a 3 × 3-unit cell with the top two layers relaxed. The IrP2 (2 0 0) surface has a 2 × 2-unit cell with a thickness of 12 atomic layers (32 Ir atoms and 64P atoms overall), six of which were relaxed. A vacuum gap of 15 Å perpendicular to the surface was added to avoid the interaction between periodic images. The Brillouin zone integration was performed using the k-points of 5 × 5 × 1 and 3 × 3 × 1 for Ir (1 1 1) and IrP2 (2 0 0) surfaces, respectively. Similar to our previous work [53], the Gibbs free energy ΔG of each elemental step was calculated as ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE - TΔS. Here, ΔE is the energy difference between the product and reactant in the DFT calculations, ΔZPE and ΔS are the change in zero-point energies with DFT calculations and entropy changes at 300 K, respectively, which were obtained by the approach of Nørskov et al [54,55]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Microstructure characterization of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs,"3.1 Microstructure characterization of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs were obtained by electrospinning and following annealing. Fig. 1 shows the SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of Ir-CNFs. Fig. 1 A shows the SEM image of obtained Ir-CNFs. All the nanofibers have uniform fibrous nanostructures and large length-diameter ratio. An average diameter about 284 nm could be observed from the statistical graph ( Fig. S1 A). From SEM image in Fig. S1 B and TEM image of Ir-CNFs in Fig. 1 B, it could be easily found that the surface of Ir-CNFs is quite smooth without protuberance and a large number of black particles are uniformly distributed on the whole nanofibers. As displayed in HRTEM image (Fig. 1 C), high resolution crystal lattices are observed and the specific lattice spacing is 0.218 nm, corresponding to Ir (1 1 1) plane. HAADF TEM and EDS elements mapping images (Fig. 1 D-F) reveal that C and Ir are well distributed, indicating the existence of Ir on CNFs. SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of IrP2-CNFs are shown in Fig. 2 . As SEM image shown in Fig. 2 A, the obtained IrP2-CNFs also have uniform fibrous nanostructures and large length-diameter ratio. An average diameter about 500 nm could be observed from the statistical graph ( Fig. S2 A). However, unlike Ir-CNFs, the dispersion between the IrP2-CNFs is not so good and several fibers stick together. This is due to the viscosity increase of precursor solution caused by the addition of PA. The same appearance can be seen from SEM images of CNFs only with PA shown in Fig. S2 B and S2C. As shown in TEM image in Fig. 2 B, similar particles are uniformly spread on the whole IrP2-CNFs. High resolution crystal lattices are observed from HRTEM image (Fig. 2 C) and the specific lattice spacing is 0.197 nm, corresponding to IrP2 (2 0 0) plane. Besides, HAADF TEM and EDS elements mapping images (Fig. 2 D) further prove the presence of well-dispersed IrP2 on IrP2-CNFs. To further prove above conclusions, XRD and XPS are measured and the corresponding spectrums are shown in Fig. 3 . From XRD patterns in Fig. 3 A, diffraction peaks of Ir-CNFs belong to cubic iridium (Ir, PDF #46-1044, space group: Fm-3m, a0 = b0 = c0 = 3.839 Å). It presents five distinct peaks at 40.66°, 47.30°, 69.13°, 83.41° and 88.03°, corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (2 2 2) planes of iridium metal structure. Likewise, all the diffraction peaks of IrP2-CNFs can be attributed to monoclinic iridium phosphide (IrP2, PDF #13-0212, space group: P21/c, a0 = 5.746 Å, b0 = 5.791 Å, c0 = 5.851 Å). The weaker and broader peak in both Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs at around 26.2° is corresponding to amorphous carbon. Surface chemical state and element composition are studied by XPS. From survey spectrum of Ir-CNFs shown in Fig. S3 A, the surface of Ir-CNFs is composed of C, O and Ir elements. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of Ir-CNFs is exhibited in Fig. 3 B and subpeaks at the binding energies (BE) of 284.8 eV and 285.8 eV belong to C-C and C-O-C components. The high-resolution O 1s spectrum of Ir-CNFs is shown in Fig. S3 B. Subpeaks at the BE of 530.9 eV and 532.4 eV are corresponding to C-O and Ir-O components. Fig. 3 C is the high-resolution Ir 4f spectrum of Ir-CNFs. Subpeaks at the BE of 61 eV and 64 eV are consistent with Ir 4f7/2 and Ir 4f5/2 of metallic Ir. The subpeaks at 62.1 eV and 65.2 eV are attributed to Ir-O of iridium oxides (IrO2) because the surface of Ir-CNFs is exposed to air. As the survey spectrum shown in Fig. S3 C, it could be easily found that the surface of IrP2-CNFs includes C, O, Ir and P elements. Subpeaks of C 1s spectrum, shown in Fig. 3 D, are situated at the BE of 284.8 eV, 285.9 eV and 287.7 eV and are corresponding to C-C, C-O-C and C-P components. Fig. S3 D is the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of IrP2-CNFs and the subpeaks at 531 eV and 532.6 eV belong to O-C and O-Ir components. High-resolution Ir 4f spectrum of IrP2-CNFs is shown in Fig. 3 E. Subpeaks at 61.5 eV and 64.6 eV are attributed to Ir4+ 4f7/2 and Ir4+ 4f5/2 of IrP2 and subpeaks at 62.5 eV and 65.6 eV are consistent with Ir-O of IrO2, too. For the high-resolution P 2p spectrum, the subpeaks at 129.9 eV, 131 eV and 133.6 eV are assigned to P-Ir, P-C and P-O bonding, respectively. It is obvious that subpeaks of Ir in IrP2-CNFs have a positive shift compared with that in Ir-CNFs and subpeaks of P 2p spectrum in IrP2-CNFs has a negative shift compared with that of standard P 2p at 130.1 eV. The charge transfer between Ir and P indicates the formation of IrP2. Moreover, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of pure CNFs, CNFs with PA, Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are measured and shown in Fig. S4 . Based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, the specific surface areas of pure CNFs and Ir-CNFs are 454 m2 g−1 and 463 m2 g−1. With the introduction of PA, specific surface areas of CNFs with PA and IrP2-CNFs have been greatly improved to 1010 m2 g−1 and 598 m2 g−1, respectively. Combined with SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS results, it can be concluded that both of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are successfully synthesized."
9,Catalytic performance of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs,"3.2 Catalytic performance of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs The electrocatalytic HER activities of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are first studied in alkaline media (1 M KOH) with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 at room temperature. For comparison, activities of pure CNFs and CNFs with PA are measured under the same conditions and shown in Fig S5 . It can be seen that both of them have poor HER activity. The polarization curves are recorded by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and corrected with 60% iR compensation ( Fig. S6 ). All the polarization curves are displayed in Fig. 4 A and overpotentials at the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 (η 10) and 100 mA cm−2 (η 100) are shown in Fig. 4 B. The polarization curves show that HER activities are increasing in the order of Pt/C < Ir-CNFs < IrP2-CNFs. At the current density of 10 mA cm−2, overpotential of Pt/C is 24 mV, while Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs show better performance of 22 mV and 19 mV, respectively. When it comes to 100 mA cm−2, overpotential of Pt/C is 151 mV and Ir-CNFs is 119 mV. As for IrP2-CNFs, the overpotential is further reduced to 105 mV after phosphating. From Fig. 4 C, Tafel slope of Ir-CNFs is 33 mV dec−1, near Pt/C (34 mV dec−1), while IrP2-CNFs has the smallest Tafel slope of 20 mV dec−1. For further comparison, mass activities of Pt/C, Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are calculated and shown in Fig. 4 D. Metal mass fraction of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are measured by ICP-OES, which are 10 wt% and 13.5 wt%. The metal loading amounts for Pt/C, Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs on GC are 170 μg cm−2, 85 μg cm−2 and 115 μg cm−2, respectively. From Fig. 4 E, at overpotentials of 50 mV and 100 mV, mass activity of Pt/C is the smallest, which are 0.15 and 0.354 A mg−1 metal. Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs have similar mass activities of 0.344 and 0.342 A mg−1 metal at 50 mV. With the increase of overpotential, Ir-CNFs has the largest mass activity of 0.907 A mg−1 metal, higher than that of IrP2-CNFs (0.815 A mg−1 metal). The strong complexation between PA and metal cation is helpful to the dissolution of IrCl3 in precursor solution and improve the utilization rate of IrCl3 in the whole process. Thus, the mass fraction of IrP2-CNFs is higher than Ir-CNFs and the mass activity is lower than Ir-CNFs. Besides, stability is another key factor for HER catalysts. Therefore, long terms of stability experiments for Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are carried out. From η-t curves in Fig. 4 F, both of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs present good stability, with a voltage increasing of 50 mV and 25 mV, after 24 h’ galvanostatic measurement. Besides, TEM and XPS characterizations of IrP2-CNFs after durability tests have been measured, which are shown in Figs. S8 and S9. From TEM and SAED images, there is no obvious change in IrP2 particles on CNFs. From XPS spectra, the surface chemical state of Ir 4f shows a small negative shift and that of P 2p show a small positive shift. The chemical states of C 1s and O 1s remain the same. It could be concluded that the chemical state of IrP2-CNFs is quite stable after 24 h’ durability test. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which could reflect the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of catalysts [56], is measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. Fig. S7 is the CV curves and the Cdl values of Pt/C, Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs. The Cdl values increase in the order of Pt/C (42 mF cm−2) < Ir-CNFs (62 mF cm−2) < IrP2-CNFs (159 mF cm−2). IrP2-CNFs shows ultra-high Cdl value due to its largest specific surface area of 598 m2 g−1. Due to large specific surface area of CNFs, more electrochemical active sites can be exposed to improve catalytic efficiency of HER. Fig. 5 shows HER performances of Pt/C, Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs in 0.5 M H2SO4. As seen in Fig. 5 A and 5B, overpotentials of Pt/C are the lowest among three catalysts. η 10 and η 100 of IrP2-CNFs are slightly lower than Ir-CNFs. Tafel slopes (Fig. 5 C) are the same as overpotentials. As for mass activities shown in Fig. 5 D and 5E, Pt/C has the largest mass activity at the overpotential of 50 mV. While at overpotential of 100 mV, mass activity of Ir-CNFs is 1.436 A mg−1 metal, quite close to Pt/C (1.435 A mg−1 metal). Combined with HER performance and mass fraction, IrP2-CNFs has the poorest mass activity. Fig. 5 F is the durability curves of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs in acid media. After 24 h’ galvanostatic measurement, Ir-CNFs shows a voltage increasing of 240 mV and the increase of IrP2-CNFs is only 85 mV. In addition, a comparison table of recent Ir-based HER catalysts has been listed in Table S1 (Supporting information). Comparing with other Ir-based HER catalysts, both Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs exhibit better HER performances in alkaline media. To gain a deep comprehension into the outstanding HER activities of Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs, DFT calculations are performed as follows."
10,DFT calculations,"3.3 DFT calculations The Gibbs free energy changes ΔG of the water dissociation and hydrogen evolution paths are displayed in Fig. 6 . The most favorable configurations for hydrogen adsorption are found to bound to the top-Ir site of Ir (1 1 1) surface and the top-P site of IrP2 (2 0 0) surface with a binding energy of −0.30 eV and −0.18 eV, respectively. The binding energy of H2O on the Ir (1 1 1) and IrP2 (2 0 0) are 0.08 eV and 0.30 eV, which indicates a metastable adsorption at 300 K. As shown in Fig. 6, the dissociation reaction of the adsorbed H2O molecule has a transition state (TS1) with a barrier energy of 0.49 eV and is exothermic of ΔG = -0.82 eV on IrP2 (2 0 0) surface, which has the products of OH and H atoms adsorption on P-top and Ir-top sites, respectively. This is in comparison with a higher barrier energy of 0.68 eV and an endothermic reaction energy of ΔG = 0.31 eV on Ir (1 1 1) surface with both products adsorbed on the top-Ir sites. Thus, H2O is more likely to dissociate toward OH and H species on IrP2 (2 0 0) surface than that on Ir (1 1 1) surface. After that two adjacent H species on the top sites may combine to form gas H2, which has a barrier TS2 of 0.95 eV (0.93 eV) and an endothermic reaction energy of ΔG = 0.10 eV (0.51 eV) on IrP2 (2 0 0) surface (Ir (1 1 1) surface). For the overall hydrogen evolution reaction, the free energies of TS1 and TS2 on IrP2 (2 0 0) surface are 0.79 eV and 0.43 eV, and the formation of H2 has an exothermic energy of −0.42 eV, which are in contrast with the positive values of 0.76 eV, 1.32 eV, and 0.90 eV for TS1, TS2, and H2 production on Ir (1 1 1) surface, respectively. The results indicate that IrP2 (2 0 0) surface is generally more favorable for HER than Ir (1 1 1) surface, as IrP2 material is a better electrocatalyst than Ir metal for hydrogen evolution."
11,Conclusions,"In this paper, the one-dimensional carbon-based electrochemical catalysts, i.e., Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs, were successfully synthesized by electrospinning and following carbonization for efficient HER progress. With a lower metal mass fraction, both of them exhibit superior HER catalytic activities than 20 wt% Pt/C, which embodied in overpotentials of 22 mV and 19 mV with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium. The corresponding Tafel slopes are 33 mV dec−1 and 20 mV dec−1, respectively. In addition, they all exhibit good stability after 24 h’ constant current test. DFT calculations also proves that IrP2 could reduce the water adsorption and hydrogen evolution energy, which is beneficial for HER kinetics. To sum up, Ir-CNFs and IrP2-CNFs are indeed promising electrocatalysts for HER and could be expected in wide production of hydrogen industry."
