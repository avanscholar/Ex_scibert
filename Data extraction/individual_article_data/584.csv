0,Introduction,"Acetonitrile (CH3 CN) is known as the non-aqueous dipolar aprotic solvent [1]. It has a moderate dielectric constant (ε =36) and high dipole moment [2]. It is used as a polar solvent in the purification of butadiene. In more specialized applications, it is a common solvent of choice for testing an unknown chemical reaction. It dissolves a wide range of compounds without complications due to its low acidity. For this reason, it is widely used as a mobile phase in HPLC. Similarly it is a popular solvent in cyclic voltammetry because of its relatively high dielectric constant. Acetonitrile has also been used as the important constituent of binary mixtures of the required characteristics [3,4]. This molecular aspect of CH3 CN motivated the authors to study the molecular behaviour of ternary mixture of CH3 CN with alcohols in benzene. An alcohol is an organic molecule containing an –O–H group. The structure of alcohol has been the subject of many investigations because of its having a possible hydrogen bonding between adjacent molecules. Alcohols as solvents play important role in many chemical reactions due to their ability to undergo self association with manifold internal structures, and are widely use in industry for the production of target compounds and science as reagents, solvents and fuels [5]. The molecular complexes formed by hydrogen have particularly attracted considerable attention to understand the nature of the bond. The most important characteristic of the hydrogen bond is the increase in the distance of O–H accompanied by an enhancement of the bond moment ∆µ [6]. The dipole moment μ ab of the complex does not exactly correspond to the vector addition of the moments μ a and μ b of the separated compounds due to the charge separation. The earliest authors to study this problem were Smith and coworkers [7]. The determination of the dipole moment will indicate the type of complex, since the dipolar increment is a function of ∆pKa. Pioneering work in this area was done by Sobcyk and his coworkers [8] and Huyskens et al. [9]. The excess dipole moment in many O–H…N and O–H…O complexes is due to either polarization effect [10] or charge transfer effect [11] or partial proton transfer effect [12] or complete proton transfer effect [13]. Reaction field effect of the environment is also a major cause of the change in dipole moment of the complexes in a polar medium [14]. From IR spectral studies, Malarski et al. [15] showed that the plot of ∆µ versus ∆pKa is sigmoidal and is quite general for many O–H…N and O–H…O bonds indicating a shift from normal complexation to proton transfer complexation. Excellent reviews have appeared on the nature of such complexes [16]. In the present study, we report here the results of our investigation on the H-bonded complexes of acetonitrile with tertiary butyl alcohol (I), isoamyl alcohol (II), cyclohexyl alcohol (III), hexyl alcohol (IV) and diethylene glycol (V) in benzene. A survey of literature showed that the above said systems have not studied so far."
1,Materials and methods,"The dielectric constants were measured [17] at 1kHz using a VLCR-7 meter supplied by Vasavi electronics, India. Using a water circulating thermostat, the temperature was maintained at 308K. The refractive indices were measured using Abbess's refractometer. Densities were determined using a 10-ml specific gravity bottle and a K-ROY microbalance. The liquids were BDH analar variety purified by Standard methods. The uncertainties in the measurement of dielectric constants, refractive indices and densities were ±0.0005, ±0.0002, ±0.0001g/cm3 respectively."
2,Theory,"The permanent dipole moment µ a of the proton donor in the liquid phase was computed from the dielectric constant ε 0 of the solution in benzene. Onsager's relation for the dipole moment of a liquid in terms of the dielectric constant takes care of the reaction field of the environment and leads to an equation [18]. (1) C a μ a 2 + C b μ b 2 + C ab μ ab 2 = 9 K T 4 π N A ( 1 C B ) { ( ε 0 − n D 2 ) ( 2 ε 0 + n D 2 ) ε 0 ( n D 2 + 2 ) 2 − C S C S ¯ ( ε S − n DS 2 ) ( 2 ε S + n DS 2 ) ε S ( n DS 2 + 2 ) 2 } (2) C a μ a 2 + C b μ b 2 + C ab μ ab 2 = Ω B C B Where Ω B is defined as the average of the squares of the dipole moments of the complexes. C a, C b and C ab are the actual concentrations of the entities of proton donor, proton acceptor and the 1:1 complex, C s is the actual concentration of the solvent, C S̅ is its concentration in moldm−3 in the pure state, µ b is the dipole moment of the proton acceptor and µ ab is the dipole moment of 1:1 complex. If the formal concentration C B of the proton acceptor is greater than the formal concentration C A of the proton donor such that (3) C B – C A > > K − 1 where K is the equilibrium constant for 1:1 complexation and if the solvent has zero dipole moment, then Eq. (1) reduces to (4) Ω B = μ b 2 + [ μ ab 2 − μ b 2 ] [ C A C B ] . The experimental values of dielectric constant, refractive index, density, and computed values of Ω B for different concentrations of the systems studied are given in Table 1 . Using least square fitting method Ω B is plotted against [C A/C B]. From the slopes and intercepts of the graph (Fig. 1 ), values of µ ab and µ b were evaluated. When a proton donor of dipole moment µ a forms an H-bond with a proton acceptor of dipole moment µ b, the direction of µ a and µ b with respect to A–H…B axis can be defined as θ a and θ b respectively. If θ a and θ b differ from zero, one can define the azimuth angle φ, which describes the rotation position of µ b around the hydrogen bond with respect to the plane formed by this bond and µ a (Fig. 2 ). The formation of the H-bond is accompanied by the displacement of the nuclei involved in H bonding and the displacement of the electron. As a consequence, the dipole vector of the complex is different from the vector sum of the components. If a single H-bond is formed between the partners, it can be presumed that Δµ, the dipolar increment due to hydrogen bond has the direction of the hydrogen bond. The dipolar increment is given by [19]. (5) Δ μ = ( μ ab 2 − μ a 2 S i n 2 θ a − μ b 2 S i n 2 θ b − 2 μ a μ b S i n θ a S i n θ b < cos φ > ) 1 / 2 − μ a cos θ a − μ b cos θ b The mean value <cos φ> was found to be zero for O–H…N which means that all rotamers around the axis of the bond are equally possible. From the computed values of µ ab and µ b the dipolar increments were obtained using Eq. (5). These values are given in Table 2 for all systems. The values of θ a and θ b were taken from the literature."
3,Discussion,"The values of dielectric constants, refractive indices and densities measured at different concentrations of proton donor C A are reported in Table 1. The formal concentration of the proton acceptor C B is kept constant. The plots of Ω B against C A/C B are given in Fig. 1. The dipolar increment (Δµ) value for all the systems is reported in Table 2. The excess dipole moment is a qualitative index for the presence of hydrogen bond in the complexes. The presence of a hydrogen bond between the alcohols and acetonitrile in benzene of these systems is indicated by excess dipole moment values. The magnitude of ∆µ determines the nature of complexation. The complexation may be due to polarization effects or charge transfer effects. The ∆µ values for all our studied systems are found to be negative, which is in agreement with the values reported by Thenappan [19] for the mixture of nitriles with ethylene glycols in benzene and 1,4 Dioxan. It is explained that the negative value of ∆µ is due to the redistribution of the charges by polarization effect. Similar conclusions were drawn [20] for the mixture of phenols with substituted piperidines. Similar results were reported by Thenappan [21] and Sabesan [22] for alcohol mixtures. If charge transfer effect exists, then ∆µ would have been greater than 10D [23,24]. But in none of our studied systems a high value of Δµ is observed. Hence the charge transfer effect can be eliminated. So, in all the systems studied, the interactions between the different components present in the system are found to be due to polarization effect. The plot of Ω B with the ratio of the formal concentrations of the components is found to be a straight line. This shows that a 1:1 complex has been formed."
4,Conclusion,"In this paper, the dielectric properties of hydrogen bonded complexes formed by acetonitrile with alcohols namely, tertiary butyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, hexyl alcohol and diethylene glycol in benzene have been studied by computing the dipolar increment values for various concentrations at 298K. The investigated values of dipolar increments reveal polarization effect dominates in all the complexes. The linear graph between Ω B and C A/C B shows 1:1 complex formation in all the mixtures."
