0,Introduction,"Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are a class of salts liquid at ambient conditions, formed by a large and asymmetric organic cation, and organic or inorganic anion [1,2]. In general, RTILs possess unique characteristics, such as non-flammability, non-volatility, high thermal and electrochemical stability, low vapor pressure, reasonable ionic conductivity, and ability to dissolve a broad range of compounds [3–5]. For this reason, RTILs have been playing a critical role in a wide variety of applications, including catalysis, [6] electrochemistry, [7–9] carbon dioxide capture, [10,11] utilisation in pharmaceutical industry and medicine, [12] and extraction of pesticides [13,14]. However, besides possessing all the above-mentioned attractive properties, RTILs may present some obstacles when used in pure state. For example, their high cost [15] and high viscosity [16] limits their use in industry, at least, on a large scale. Nonetheless, physicochemical properties of RTILs can be customised and optimised. For instance, addition of solvents, such as water or alcohols, helps to control the properties of the resulting mixtures in order to obtain the desired characteristics for each purpose [17–22]. RTILs with cyano-anions have been attracting attention due to their combination of low melting points, reduced viscosities and elevated conductivity [23]. A number of studies have been performed to test their suitability as electrolytes [24,25]. As it has been shown recently, the most promising results for aromatics/aliphatics separation are achieved by RTILs with SCN-anion [26–28] as they allow for high selectivity. Shekarri et al. proposed SCN-based RTILs as a greener – due to non-hazardous hydrolysis products – alternative to the classical hydrodesulfurization process applied at refineries for deep desulfurization of fossil fuel [29]. Additionally, SCN-based RTILs have shown a good performance in dissolution of carbohydrates and sugar alcohols, [30] which is crucial for successful application of these compounds. The solubility of CO2 for its post-combustion capture and further storage, can be greatly improved by application of RTILs with the SCN-anion [31]. The possibility to use cyano-based RTILs as electron donors in charge transfer reactions has been explored by Wu et al. [32]. In order to optimize and further increase the SCN-based RTILs utility and range of applications, knowledge and customisation of their physicochemical properties is of crucial importance. Thus, Domańska and co-workers have studied the density and viscosity of SCN-containing RTILs in binary mixtures with various alcohols to adjust their applicability in liquid-liquid extractions [19,28,33]. Experimental studies of binary systems composed by SCN-based ionic liquids with alcohols (ethanol and 1-propanol) and water showed that RTIL-alcohol interactions are stronger compared to the RTIL-water interactions, while density and viscosity decrease dramatically with the decrease of RTIL content in both systems [20,21,28]. The interactions in such RTIL-molecular solvent mixtures are influenced by dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), charge transfer, interstitial accommodation, etc. [28,34,35]. Thus, prediction of the influence of RTIL-solvent mixture composition on the resulted properties remains a challenge for both science and industry. Understanding of microscopic patterns in neat RTILs and their binary mixtures with molecular solvents is crucial for the interpretation of macroscopic properties in these systems. Experimental techniques like neutron scattering, [36] NMR, [37,38] X-ray [39] and IR spectroscopy [40,41] have been used to acquire knowledge of the microstructure of these systems. The fact that the local arrangement of imidazolium cations in RTILs is mainly determined by the counter-ions is well-known [34]. However, cation-cation interactions also play a noticeable role in the determination of RTIL properties. Two types of cation-cation contacts have been reported in imidazolium-based RTILs: interactions between alkyl tails [42] and between aromatic rings (so-called “π-π stacking”) [43,44]. The former ones are distinguishable for longer alkyl substituents, starting from butyl, [45] while the later are more prominent for short-chained cations' tails. These π-π interactions have been reported from NMR experiments [46] and confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [34,47]. Such interactions were found to be sensitive to the type of anion [34]. As it has been shown by Tang et al., [48] the π-π interactions enhance the RTIL layering on the RTIL-air and RTIL-graphene interface, independently of the substrates nature. These interactions stabilise the surface structure of RTILs, which can be essential for separation processing. However, the influence of solvents on the cation-cation interactions is poorly studied [34,35]. Cation-anion interactions in RTILs-molecular liquids mixtures, being probably the most important ones, are still not fully rationalised. Thus, for the neat imidazolium-based RTIL, it is generally agreed that cation-anion interactions involve hydrogen-bonding with the most acidic hydrogen atom, i.e., the one attached to carbon in position 2 (see Fig. 1 ) [49,50]. Nonetheless, other ring or α-carbon hydrogens cannot be disregarded without previous studies [2]. However, by addition of a solvent to RTILs, the interplay between charged and neutral particles in the resulted systems become more complex. For instance, Zhang et al. followed the change in the local environments of the C2C1imBF4-water system. It was shown, that as water concentration increases, the C2C1imBF4 dissociates and become solvated, leading to the formation of a H-bonded network between the counter-ions and water molecules, instead of H-bonds between ions [51]. Thus, H-bonding interactions are essential for understanding the structure of RTILs' binary mixtures. The nature of H-bonding interactions, their evolution throughout the mixture composition, their effect on the ion pair structure, are key factors that are to be taken into account for this type of systems [44,48,52]. In this framework, several experimental and computational studies have been conducted, showing that the presence of H-bonding network is fundamental for the local organisation in RTILs-based systems and that it enhances their abilities in several applications, [49] for example, increases their capacity to dissolve materials [53]. Experimental investigation of physicochemical phenomena in RTIL-molecular solvent systems is, with no doubt, fundamental but despite recent advances it is still very challenging to probe experimentally the interactions between the components of these complex mixtures. MD simulations, however, can be a powerful tool for shedding light into the physicochemical patterns in terms of microscopic organisation, especially taking into account the vast number of possibly promising mixtures to consider. MD simulations have been successfully used to address RTILs-solvent mixtures over the last 15 years [22,35,54]. Coupled with accurate and robust potential models, MD simulations can provide valuable insights in this field. In this work, we performed classical MD simulations to investigate the thermodynamic (density, excess molar volume and heats of vaporization) and transport (self-diffusion coefficients and shear viscosity) properties as well as structural characteristics (in terms of radial, angular, and spatial distributions) of binary mixtures of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (C2C1imSCN) with ethanol (EtOH) or methanol (MeOH) (see Fig. 1 for the molecular structures). We employed a non-polarizable OPLS-AA-based potential model, developed by Acevedo and co-workers, [55] for RTILs. For each of the C2C1imSCN-alcohol mixture, a wide range of molar fractions of RTIL, x RTIL, were addressed. For comparison purposes, the neat RTIL and alcohols were used as reference points. The obtained results allowed us to reveal the influence of the alcohol on the properties of the binary mixtures, as well as to access the ion pair structure as a function of mixture composition."
1,Methodology and computational details,
2,Simulation protocol,"2.1 Simulation protocol All the MD simulations were carried out using the GROMACS MD software package, version 5.1.4 [56]. The initial systems contained a total number of 864 C2C1imSCN ion pairs, alcohol molecules (EtOH and MeOH) and their combinations were generated by Packmol [57] code and placed randomly in a cubic simulation box with standard periodic boundary conditions. The choice of such system size was dictated by the results of Gabl et al. [58] who proved that a sufficiently large system (i.e., at least 512 ion pairs) and long simulation time are needed to properly capture both the structure and dynamics of the RTILs, being the large system size a more crucial factor than the simulation time. The mole fractions of RTIL, x RTIL, were 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 in the different systems considered. The overview of simulated systems compositions is provided in Table S1 in Supporting Information (SI). All the systems were modelled within the OPLS-AA transferable force field framework, in which the Coulombic and Lennard-Jones potentials for 1–4 interactions are scaled by a factor of 2 [59]. For C2C1imSCN a recently published potential model by Acevedo and co-workers [55] was used, while the EtOH and MeOH were simulated with classical OPLS-AA force fields [59]. These potential models were chosen taking into account their good performance in the prediction of a vast number of experimental physicochemical properties of neat fluids. [60–63] After an initial energy minimisation carried out with the steepest descent method, each system was relaxed in the canonical (NVT) ensemble for 1 ns. For this initial relaxation, the equations of motion were propagated with a time-step of 0.5 fs. The temperature was kept constant at 298.15 K by applying a velocity-rescaling thermostat [64] with a coupling constant of 0.5 ps. This step was followed by an equilibration run in the isothermal-isobaric (NpT) ensemble for 15 ns with a time-step of 1 fs. The Berendsen barostat [65] with coupling constant of 0.5 ps was additionally employed to maintain the pressure at 1 bar. A final production run in the NVT ensemble was performed during 50 ns for each system. To preserve the temperature, the Nose-Hoover thermostat [66,67] with a coupling constant of 0.8 ps was used at this stage. During this final run the time-step was fixed at 2 fs and all the CH bonds were constrained with the LINCS algorithm [68]. The electrostatic interactions during all simulation steps were calculated using the direct Coulomb law up to 1.3 nm distance between centres of interaction sites. The electrostatics beyond the cut-off were accounted for by the computationally efficient Particle-Mesh-Ewald (PME) method [69,70]. The Lennard-Jones (12–6) potential was accounted up to 1.3 nm as well, modified between 1.3 and 1.5 nm using the shifted potential scheme. A dispersion correction for the van der Waals interactions was applied both for energy and pressure during the NpT simulations, and only for energy during the NVT simulations. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three directions. All the structural properties were calculated from the last 1 ns of the production runs using the TRAVIS code [71]."
3,Physicochemical properties,"2.2 Physicochemical properties The potential models were primarily tested to reproduce the experimental thermodynamic and transport properties. The density, ρ, and enthalpy of vaporization, ΔH vap, of each system was assessed with Gromacs in-built tools from the equilibration run in NpT ensemble. ΔH vap, was calculated for the neat compounds through the following equation: (1) ∆ H vap = E pot gas − E pot liquid + RT , where E pot(gas) represents the potential energy of an ion pair (or a molecule in the case of solvents) in the gas phase; E pot(liquid) corresponds to the potential energy in the liquid phase; terms R and T express the ideal gas constant and the temperature, respectively [55]. Quantitative estimation of translational dynamics can be implemented by means of the self-diffusion coefficient, D, of the centre of mass of a molecule i according to the Einstein relation: (2) D = 1 6 lim t → ∞ d dt r i → t − r i → 0 2 , where r i → t − r i → 0 2 is the ensemble-averaged mean-square displacement (MSD) of the particle i and r i → t indicates the position of the center of mass at time t [72,73]. The shear viscosity, η, was calculated by the non-equilibrium periodic perturbation method described in detail by Hess [74]. For this, an additional NpT run for 10 ns for each system was performed. In this approach, an external periodic force, a x (z), is applied in x direction of the simulation box, where η is the measure of the system response to the applied force: (3) a x z = Acos 2 π l z z , Here, A stands for the amplitude of acceleration applied to the external force a x (z) and l z to the length of the box [74–76]. In this work, several amplitudes of acceleration (between 0.01 and 0.24 nm ps−2) were tested and after comparing to available experimental data the value A = 0.01 nm ps−2 was finally chosen. The η of the system is calculated by averaging the generated velocity profile (ν), founded on equation [75,76]: (4) η = Aρ ν l z 2 π 2 ."
4,Potential models' validation,"2.3 Potential models' validation Thermodynamics and transport properties of neat C2C1imSCN, EtOH and MeOH were chosen for validation of the employed potential models. The obtained simulation results are presented in Table 1 and compared with available experimental data. The predicted ρ for C2C1imSCN agrees well with the experimental value (the error equals to 1.28%; from now on, the errors of simulated values are estimated as follows: error = |(x sim − x exp)|/x exp × 100%, where x sim and x exp stands for the simulated and experimental property x), as well as for the EtOH and MeOH (errors of 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively). The simulated ΔH vap for C1C2imSCN is found to be 127 kJ mol−1, which gives a relative error of 15.5% below the experimental value. The simulated ΔH vap for EtOH and MeOH are 43 and 37 kJ mol−1, respectively. These results are slightly overestimated, [24] providing errors of 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. The transport properties, D and η, were also addressed. The simulated value for shear viscosity of C2C1imSCN equals 21 mPa s−1, which in comparison with the experimental value (22.15 mPa s−1) provides an error of 5%. For MeOH and EtOH the simulated viscosities of 0.64 mPa s−1 and 1.16 mPa s−1 were obtained, respectively [80,83]. The computed D values for the C2C1im+ cation and for the SCN− anion are 0.051 and 0.057 × 10−9 m2 s−1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, no experimental data on diffusion for C2C1imSCN is available. However, the presented D values are within the typical interval of RTILs self-diffusions [84,85]. The values of self-diffusion coefficients obtained in our simulations are of 2.376 and 1.020 × 10−9 m2 s−1, for MeOH and EtOH, respectively. Comparison with the NMR measurements, reported by Arrata et al., [82] gives an error not exceeding 3% for both alcohols. As it follows from the above presented results, the simulated values are in good agreement with the experimental ones. Thus, it can be concluded, that the chosen potential models are appropriate for the further study."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Volumetric and transport properties,"3.1 Volumetric and transport properties To get a deep understanding of the macroscopic pattern in the binary mixtures of C2C1imSCN with alcohols, here we present the estimated values of densities, ρ, excess molar volumes, V E m, self-diffusion coefficients, D, and shear viscosities, η, in the wide range of compositions. The volumetric properties, ρ and V E m, of binary RTILs-solvent mixtures depend both on the components' nature and interactions between them (inter-ionic, inter-molecular and ion-molecular). The inter-particle interactions in mixtures are reflected in the interstitial accommodation (V E m) resulting from the differences in molar volume and free volume in the system [72,86]. V E m was calculated according to the following equation: (5) V m E = x RTIL M RTIL + x solv M solv ρ mix − x RTIL M RTIL ρ RTIL + x solv M solv ρ solv , where indexes RTIL, solv and mix represent the ionic liquid, solvent (methanol or ethanol) and mixture, respectively; M stands for molecular weight, and x for mole fraction. The ρ and V m E for the mixtures C2C1imSCN-EtOH and C2C1imSCN-MeOH as a function of RTIL mole fraction are shown in Fig. 2 . Comparison with the available experimental data [87] showed a good agreement for C2C1imSCN-EtOH system, where the relative deviations from experiment are 0.28–3.00%. The presented data for both systems show a tendency for the density to decrease with the decrease of RTIL content. However, the EtOH-containing systems provide higher density values with respect to the MeOH-containing systems. That is, since the ethanol density being higher than the methanol one (compare: ρ EtOH = 0.797 vs. ρ MeOH = 0.776 g cm−3), the EtOH-containing systems are denser in the whole range of concentrations. Nevertheless, with the decrease of x RTIL < 0.4, the density for both systems becomes very similar. Generally, V m E may present negative or positive values, depending on the prevailing type of interactions in the system. The strong attraction between the interacting components (consequently, well-defined packing) in the mixture leads to negative V m E values, while weak attraction (loose packing) to positive V m E ones. [2] As it can be seen in Fig. 2, for both binary mixtures negative deviations from ideality were obtained. Particularly, V m E in C2C1imSCN-MeOH system is more negative than in the mixture with C2C1imSCN-EtOH, indicating that the local structure in the MeOH-containing system is better organised, comparing with the latter one. This behaviour agrees with the experimental [24–26] and computational data [27,28] observed for other binary systems containing MeOH or EtOH in imidazolium-based ionic liquids. Furthermore, the C1C2imSCN-EtOH system presents a minimum at x RTIL = 0.3, whereas the C1C2imSCN-MeOH reaches its most dense packing at x RTIL = 0.2. This is in agreement with reports on excess molar volume in similar RTIL-alcohol mixtures [88–90]. The translational mobility of the compounds of the mixture can be accessed by the self-diffusion coefficient, D. The D coefficients were calculated from MSD collected after the studied systems reached the diffusive regime in the NVT production run. The diffusive regime attainment was controlled by the parameter β, as described in our previous works [2,76,91]. It is considered that the system has a stable diffusive behaviour in regions, where β ≈ 1, which for the investigated systems occurs after 12 ns of simulations. The dependence of D coefficient on C2C1imSCN mole fraction for the systems understudy here is shown in Fig. 3 . Generally, imidazolium based-RTILs and their mixtures exhibit self-diffusion coefficients higher for cations (D +) than for anions (D −), by a factor of 1.1–1.5 [2,92–94]. Interestingly, in our simulations, the anion diffusion, D −, is greater than the cation diffusion, D +, which means that SCN− diffuses faster than C2C1im+. However, this behaviour is not that uncommon and the cases with D − being larger than D + have been reported for other imidazolium-based RTILs, both experimentally [95–97] and computationally [98–101]. This trend was noted for the C2C1imSCN in the simulations of Kirchner et al., at 398.15 K [99]. Experimentally for C2C1imB(CN)4 the values of D + = 5.81 × 10−11 m2 s−1 and D − = 6.9 × 10−11 m2 s−1 were measured by NMR spectroscopy at 298.15 K. The authors attribute this effect to reduced anion size and weak inter-ion interactions [95]. Tokuda et al. [92–94] showed that, in addition to their size, ion diffusion is also influenced by the geometric shape of the anion. Several factors seem to be involved in the magnitude of cation and anion diffusion, like the ions symmetry and size, strength of interionic interactions, and so forth [102,103]. Fig. 3 illustrates the behaviour of the self-diffusion coefficients for the two systems over the mole fraction of C2C1imSCN at 298.15 K. The decrease of the RTIL content in the studied mixture leads to an increase in the diffusion of all species present in the mixtures, namely, C2C1im+, SCN−, MeOH or EtOH. D values for alcohols are much larger than D + and D −, for all compositions. The D + and D − coefficients preserve close values throughout the whole concentration range, however, maintaining the D − > D + trend. The increase in ion diffusion becomes more evident for x RTIL ≤ 0.4, with this behaviour being clearer and more accentuated for the C2C1imSCN-MeOH system. This suggests that ion mobility in the system increases with the concentration of methanol or ethanol but decreases with the increase in the alcohol chain length. At the same time, the diffusivities of C2C1im+ and SCN−are higher for the C2C1imSCN-MeOH system. Shear viscosity was calculated for the C2C1imSCN-MeOH and C2C1imSCN-EtOH systems from the non-equilibrium MD. The effect of mole fraction of RTIL on viscosity is presented in Fig. 4 . Due to the lack of experimental data, it was only possible to compare the simulation results for the C2C1imSCN-EtOH system with the experimental data at temperature 293.15 K [87]. The resulted viscosities when compared to experimental data present errors of ~4 to 9% for systems with x RTIL < 0.6 and of ~15% for systems with x RTIL > 0.6. As expected, the viscosity decays with decreasing RTIL mole fraction for both binary systems. This trend was anticipated due to the viscosity differences of pure substances. Thus, the viscosity of neat C2C1imSCN RTIL (21.06 mPa s−1) is orders of magnitude higher than that of pure ethanol (1.16 mPa s−1) and pure methanol (0.64 mPa s−1) at room temperature. The drastic viscosity reduction in imidazolium-based RTILs in the presence of alcohols has been verified experimentally [104,105]. The shear viscosities for the C2C1imSCN-alcohols mixtures studied here are similar, although the methanol-containing system exhibits lower viscosities. This follows from the difference in viscosity of MeOH compared to EtOH. Besides the presence of the solvent, the transport properties of RTILs, such as viscosity, may be affected by the interactions between ions in the ion pair. For example, the stronger the hydrogen bonding network, the greater the viscosity of RTIL [106,107]. In order to better understand the cation-anion interaction of C2C1imSCN-containing systems, a structural study was performed for pure RTIL and its behaviour in mixtures with alcohols studied."
7,Local structure analysis,"3.2 Local structure analysis Understanding the structure of RTILs is crucial for designing and optimising their physicochemical properties. To get an insight into the organisation of the components of the mixtures, details of the structural landscape of interacting components involved in binary mixtures were addressed through various radial, angular and spatial distribution functions. The spatial distribution function (SDF) is a three-dimensional representation that shows the probability of finding a certain molecular species around the reference one. SDFs allow obtaining visual information about the spatial arrangement of the components in the mixtures as a function of x RTIL. Fig. 5 describes the distribution of the N atom of the SCN− anion and the O atom of the alcohol around the C2C1im+ cation for the neat ionic liquid and both mixtures. The nitrogen atom of the anion was chosen for this analysis taking into account a recent work, where by means of molecular mechanics calculations the cation-anion H-bond has been proven to be formed through the N atom of SCN−, despite of the more negative charge on S atom [108]. As it can be seen, independently of the C2C1imSCN concentration, the SCN− anion has a preference for the cation's ring hydrogens and interacts mostly with the H2, H4 , and H5 atoms. However, the concentration effect can be noticed, i.e.: with the addition of solvent to the system the isosurface area corresponding to the arrangement of the anion around the cation increases in size. In other words, the increase of solvent molecules amount leads to the delocalisation of the anion around the H i atoms of the cation ring, and as it can be clearly seen, the anion distribution loses intensity. In the case of the O atom distributing around the cation, the decrease in the molar fraction of RTIL results in an increasing of the MeOH isosurface on all cation hydrogen sites. Curiously, in case of EtOH-containing system, the effect of RTILs concentration is different for different interaction sites, i.e.: as the RTIL's mole fraction decreases, the alcohol isosurface on H2 cation's site diminishes, while on H4 and H5 hydrogens, on the contrary, it increases. This may be associated with the better penetration ability of the smaller methanol molecule, compared to ethanol. Therefore, the short-chained methanol further distorts the C2C1imSCN ion pair, leading to higher solvation of C2C1im+ cation. In order to complement the information obtained with the SDFs, radial distribution functions (RDFs) were additionally calculated. As a starting point, the RDFs were analysed to inspect the most important cation⋯anion interactions in C2C1imSCN (see Figs. S1 and S2 in SI). Firstly, that the interactions between the cation H2 and atoms N and S of the anion were compared (Fig. S1). Although the peak corresponding to the interaction H2⋯S is slightly higher, than the one for H2⋯N, however, the latter occurs at shorted distance (0.248 and 0.268 nm for H2⋯N and H2⋯S, respectively), indicating N atom as the most relevant anion interaction site. Analysis of Fig. S2 confirms that the most prominent peaks occur between the N of the SCN− and the hydrogen atoms of the imidazolium cation ring, H2,4,5. However, among the others the interaction on H2 site is the most intense, and therefore, this site was chosen for further analysis of RDFs for all the mixtures. The RDFs involving H2 cation interaction site are shown in Fig. 6 only for mixtures with ethanol, as the corresponding RDFs in mixtures with methanol are identical and therefore not shown. Considering the RDFs for the cation⋯solvent interactions (Fig. 6a) in C2C1imSCN-EtOH mixture, it is clearly seen that like the cation⋯anion interactions the RDFs present two well-defined peaks at ca 0.2 and 0.6 nm. The H2⋯N interaction has a significantly higher peak than the cation⋯solvent interaction, which increases in intensity with decreasing of RTIL content in the system. The position of the first peaks for both studied RDFs does not change significantly with the change in concentration. At the same time, the position of first minima on cation⋯anion RDF (Fig. 6a, top) shifts slightly to larger distances, while for cation⋯solvent RDF (Fig. 6a, bottom) – to shorter distances. This means that the coordination ability of cation to coordinate anion, as well as to coordinate solvent, follow opposite trends. Indeed, as it can be seen from Fig. 6b, with the decrease of RTIL content in both systems, the coordination capacity of the ring H2 site to coordinate the SCN anion decreases, while for the H2⋯O interaction, the number of alcohol molecules in the coordination sphere of cation increases. At about x RTIL ~ 0.3, a crossing can be seen (Fig. 6b), that could be interpreted as a competition between the anion and the solvent to be localized on cation H2-site. 3.2.1 Hydrogen bonding interactions Several experiments and simulations have shown that, in the case of neat imidazolium-based RTILs, the cation and the anion interact through H-bonds, occurring mainly between the H2 of imidazolium ring (see Fig. 1) and the electronegative atom of the anion [98,109–111]. This is in agreement with our findings from RDFs analysis, which shows that the closest cation-anion contacts involve H2 imidazolium ring site (see Fig. S2). However, the introduction of solvents into the system complicates this native inter-ionic interaction picture [112,113]. Thus, the importance of this contribution to the overall pattern of inter-ionic interactions still requires additional clarification. Following the traditional terminology, an evidence of H-bonding formation between the donor moiety, D or H, and the accepting atom, A, may be considered via certain criteria, based on either the interaction energy or on the radial and angular cut-offs. Taking into account the geometrical characteristics of H-bonds, the latter may be also expressed through the dual radial cut-offs, r A⋯D and r A⋯H. According to criteria proposed by Jeffrey, [114] the strong H-bond exists when the r A⋯D is equal to them sum of the intramolecular r H−D and intermolecular r A⋯H (corresponding to the linear pseudovalent H-bond angle A⋯H−D), while weak H-bonds are characterised by a notably shorter r A⋯D (bent A⋯H−D). In order to evaluate the evolution of the various H-bonding interactions as a function of the mole fraction of RTIL, here we considered r A⋯D and r A⋯H characteristics in terms of cation⋯anion and cation⋯solvent interactions as a function of x RTIL (where A stands for N of SCN− and O of EtOH or MeOH and D represents C2 of C2C1im+ and O of EtOH or MeOH). The alcohol molecules can also have influence on the cation⋯anion interactions by forming ion-molecular H-bonds with the anion and with other alcohol molecules. So, the evolution of anion⋯solvent and solvent⋯solvent H-bonding interactions will be also considered. For this purpose we applied the nearest neighbours approach, that has shown its appropriateness for the study of similar systems [35]. Thus, we calculated the corresponding probability radial distributions and distil these distributions into descriptors corresponding to their average values. Nevertheless, these descriptors just take in account the shape of the statistical radial distributions and should not be considered as a cut-off distances of the A⋯D and A⋯H distributions, while the abovementioned criteria should be noted for further guidance. In Fig. 7 , it is shown the behaviour of the double distance H-bonding characteristics describing the cation⋯anion, cation⋯solvent, anion⋯solvent and solvent⋯solvent interactions as a function of x RTIL. As it can be seen, the general tendency is that for both binary systems the inter-ionic distances are increasing with the decrease of x RTIL, while the nature of alcohol displays a negligible effect on the cation⋯anion H-bonding formation. Moreover, the nature of the alcohol as well as decreasing of x RTIL does not affect the spatial arrangement of the SCN−, keeping it in almost linear position along the C2−H2 bond of cation. It is also seen that the double H-bonding distances both between the anion and the solvent and between the cation and the solvent decrease with decreasing x RTIL. The same pattern is observed for the solvent⋯solvent H-bonding. Here, for cation⋯solvent and solvent⋯solvent interactions, the orientation of the EtOH and MeOH tends to be more linear (with respect to C2−H2 and O−H bond of cation and alcohol) with decreasing x RTIL, while an opposite situation is observed for anion⋯solvent interactions. The crossover between the two sets of distances it occurs at about x RTIL ~ 0.4 for the cation⋯anion (C2⋯N and H2⋯N) and cation⋯solvent (C2⋯O and H2⋯O) interactions, in agreement with the previously discussed behaviour of the coordination ability of C2C1im+. The second crossover between the cation⋯anion and solvent⋯solvent (H⋯O and O⋯O) average distances occurs at x RTIL ~ 0.7. Based on these observations one can suggest that the addition of EtOH or MeOH leads to a weakening of the H-bonding interactions between the cation and the anion by concomitantly and progressively establishment of H-bonds both with the cation, with the anion and with other alcohol molecules. At the lower x RTIL, the average H-bonding distances can be arranged as follows: r cation⋯anion > r cation⋯solvent > r solvent⋯solvent > r anion⋯solvent, manifesting that the alcohol molecules surrounding the cation and anion can on average approach the ions closer than their nearest counter-ion neighbours. This mechanism is accompanied by the shifting of the neighbouring counter-ions, while keeping their orientation to each other. The relationship between the size of the short-chained alcohol on the strength of the H-bonds interactions present in the C2C1imSCN-MeOH or EtOH systems seems to be negligible. 3.2.2 Stacking interactions As it is shown above, the H-bond interactions play an important role in the local organisation of the targeted systems. However, along with counter-ions and other species in the binary system, cation⋯cation or π-π stacking interactions also should be highlighted regarding the properties of imidazolium-based RTILs [48,115,116]. In this context, we investigated the influence of the small chain alcohols on the π-π stacking interaction aspects in the cation⋯cation arrangement. The effects of MeOH and EtOH on the average distances between the neighbouring C2C1im+ ring centres were studied and are shown in Fig. 8 . In the presence of large amounts of RTIL in the system, the imidazolium rings remain close to each other. For x RTIL ≤ 0.6 the average distance between the neighbouring cations begins to increase, with this increase being more evidently pronounced from x RTIL ≤ 0.4. The adjacent cations go farther away with the decreasing RTIL content of the system, indicating the loose of the ring stacking. For all that, the interaction seen between the aromatic rings in the neat C2C1imSCN is altered. For systems containing EtOH, the inter-cation distances are slightly larger, compared to systems with MeOH, but the difference is insignificant. In both ethanol- and methanol-containing systems, the cation⋯cation interactions gradually become weaker and, consequently, the inter-cation distances become larger. In accordance with the foregoing, such behaviour is associated with the violation of the structure organisation of the cation-anion H-bonding network as a result of shifting the neighbouring counter-ions by the alcohol molecules. However, this behaviour only represents the general tendency of stacking. The arrangements of the imidazolium rings within ion pair dimers may adopt several mutual orientations, that is: stacked, T-shaped and displaced with parallel or antiparallel alignment of the alkyl chain [34,35]. From the calculations of the various angular distributions, it is possible to get an insight on the mutual arrangement of the neighbouring cations of the C2C1imSCN system. Here, we investigated the angular distribution of three representative angles: α, β and γ (see Fig. 9 ). The first investigated α angle is the angle formed by the normal vector, n 1 , of the cation ring plane of the reference cation and the distance vector, r, connecting the ring centres of the reference and observed cations. In the case of angle α being around 0° or 180°, the observed cation is above/below the reference one, while the in-plane arrangement corresponds to the angle values close to 90°. Next, the angles β and γ, representing the planar/T-shaped ring orientation and parallel-displacement of alkyl tails, respectively, were considered. The first one, β, is formed by the normal vectors, n 1 and n 2 , of the ring planes between the reference and observed cations, while the second one, γ, lies between the vectors along N–CH3 bonds, a 1 and a 2 , of the reference and observed cations. When angle β is equal to ~ 0° or 180°, the imidazolium rings are in a planar position; the T-shaped position occurs when β has values around 90°. Finally, values of γ close to 0° indicate a parallel orientation and close to 180° – an antiparallel one [34]. A schematic representation of these cation⋯cation interactions is shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 9, while on the left-hand side the distribution of the orientation probabilities of the angles α, β and γ for x RTIL = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.50 and 1.00 are presented. The probability distributions of these angles show that for x RTIL = 1.00, the observed cation pairs prefer to occupy an above/below position with parallel/antiparallel orientation of alkyl tails. Kirchner et al. also showed that this orientation was the most favourable for C2C1imSCN in a mixture with C2C1imCl [1]. With the decrease of RTIL mole fraction in the system, the initial orientation of the C2C1im+ cations is lost, particularly, for x RTIL ≤ 0.20. This is in line with our findings from the H-bonding analysis in these systems, as the strengthening in ion-solvent interactions results in the weakening of cation⋯anion interactions and, consequently, cation⋯cation interactions. This tendency was also observed between imidazolium cations in an C4C1imPF6 – acetronitrile mixture [35]."
8,Conclusions,"In this paper, we have studied C2C1imSCN-MeOH and C2C1imSCN-EtOH binary mixtures by means of classical MD simulations. We have reported macroscopic thermodynamic (density, excess molar volume and heat of vaporization) and transport (viscosity and self-diffusion coefficients) properties in the whole concentration range of the studied mixtures at room temperature. It is shown that, the density for both systems tends to decrease with decreasing of the mole fractions of RTILs. The excess molar volume is found to present a negative deviation from the ideality indicating that the RTIL-solvent interactions prevails over the inter-ionic and inter-molecular interactions, suggesting a structural change for mixtures with mole fraction of RTIL <0.20–0.30. Considering the transport properties, it is found that, independently of the mixture composition, the diffusivity of the anion is larger than of the cation. The general behaviour was found similar for both systems: with the decrease of RTIL content, the ions self-diffusion notably increases, however, reaching higher values in C2C1imSCN-MeOH system. In addition, the same tendency is noted for the shear viscosity: upon the decrease in RTIL mole fraction, the viscosity decays dramatically. To get an inside and possible explanation of the observed macroscopic patterns, an analysis of the structural characteristics was performed. For this purpose, two distances cut-offs, representing the H-bond between the donor moiety and acceptor one, within the nearest neighbour approach, were employed. Additionally, the angular distributions, characterising the inter-cation arrangement, were discussed. In accordance with the previously published results, the ion-molecular hydrogen bonding interactions show the same behaviour upon decreasing x RTIL. Introducing an alcohol to both systems weakens the inter-ionic H-bonding network and significantly changes the mixture structure, specially, at low RTIL content (below 0.3 mole fraction). These findings correlate with numerous experimental reports on the abrupt change in macroscopic pattern in RTIL-solvent mixtures at RTIL molar fraction at ~ 0.2–0.4. The tail length of the selected alcohols was found to have an insignificant effect on the structural properties of the addressed systems. The H-bonding is strongly reflected on the behaviour of cation-cation interactions. As it follows from the angular distribution analysis, the cation-cation arrangement loses its characteristic above/below orientation in neat RTIL and becomes disordered at low RTIL content."
