0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production using interaction of aluminum with water at neutral pH under normal conditions is a very convenient and promising method applicable in specific fields [1]. These are, first of all, hydrogen cartridges of energy devices based on hydrogen fuel cells for mobile communications, video equipment, ultralight aircraft, etc. To obtain active materials based on aluminum, two areas of research prevail: obtaining special alloys based on aluminum and preparation of dispersed materials based on aluminum using mechanochemical processing [2–5]. The principal difference of this work is the use of massive commercial aluminum alloys subjected to an activating treatment with Ga-based eutectics [6,7]. An attempt is made to relate the reactivity of materials subjected to Ga-In eutectics with the morphology of the initial commercial alloy. The approach developed in this work is that a highly active state of the material based on aluminum alloys activated by gallium eutectics for hydrogen evolution from water is achieved by creating an optimally organized nanostructured system in which eutectic components are distributed along the grain boundaries of the entire mass of the material. It was shown that the efficiency of interaction of bulk materials activated with Ga-In eutectic with water is not inferior to specially prepared aluminum-based powder products obtained using various techniques."
1,Experimental,"As the model substances, commercial duralumin alloys D1T (Russian analogue of 2017T4 alloy), D16T (Russian analogue of 2024 alloy) and A0 (Russian analogue of Aluminium110) were used. The reason for choosing such materials was the significant difference in their grain boundary structure. In this work, for activation of the aluminum alloys, the sample surface was treated by Ga or the eutectic Ga-In alloy (75 wt% of Ga, 25 wt% of In) with Tmelt. = 15.9 °C at T = 150 °C under dry conditions. The samples alloys were mechanically cut out of bars perpendicular to rolling direction. The processing with gallama was performed over the cutoff surface. An obvious drawback of this method is that a commercial alloy contains such elements as Cu, Fe, Mg, Si, etc., which do not interact with water and increase the weight of the activated product. However, we should note that in the case of the aluminum powder or granules with a high fraction of oxidized surface, not the whole bulk of the material reacts with water. The study of the temporary character of hydrogen evolution from the interaction of water with activated aluminum was carried out in a specially built plant [8]. During the experiment, the mass of water forced out of a special container by the produced hydrogen was measured every two seconds with a VIBRA CJ-8200 ER digital weight scale. The reactor volume was ∼100 cm3; the starting temperature was 25 °C. The thermographic study was performed using the thermal imaging device “SVIT”, developed at the Rzhanov Institute of Semiconductor Physics of SB RAS. Data on the phase composition of the aluminum hydroxide samples were produced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with monochromatized CuKα radiation at diffraction angles in the range 2θ = 10–80°, scanning step of 0.05°, and signal integration duration of 5 s per step. The diffraction patterns were interpreted in accordance with the powder diffraction database ICDD PDF-2 (2006). The morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDX using a Hitachi S–3400 N microscope (Japan)."
2,Results and discussion,"The material obtained as a result of activation has a high reactivity with respect to water. As shown in Fig. 1 , one drop of water is enough to transform a sample weighing ∼1 g at room temperature into a finely divided dark powder for 2 s. The resulting powder has a high reactivity with water and alcohols. With the further addition of water, an intense reaction occurs with large heat release and the formation of hydroxide. An attempt was made to study the nature of the processes occurring upon contact of a drop of water with the surface of an activated product using a thermal imager. When the droplet spreads over the surface, the reaction occurred violently and subsequent changes in the sample were radical in nature, and it was not possible to register the dynamics of them using a thermal imager, because it was not possible to focus the optics due to rapid changes in the size and shape of the sample. The experiments were continued using less water, in which the surface of the sample ∼1 cm2 in size was contacted at room temperature with wet filter paper for 1 s. Next, a thermal imaging survey of the surface was carried out, the results of which are shown in Fig. 2 . The given temperature value corresponded to the hottest area of the sample surface. To elucidate the features of the activated state of aluminum samples after they were treated with Ga and Ga-In eutectics, the surface of the cleaved samples was studied using the SEM method with EDX. Fig. 3 shows a SEM image of the surface of the chip of the activated A0 sample and concentration profile of components on the chip surface. It is seen that the cleavage surface is heterogeneous, most of which is smooth. An analysis of the concentration profile shows that the entire surface is covered with a gallium layer, the thickness of which changes at the points indicated in Fig. 3. Given that sample A0 is a fused cast material with a wide grain size distribution, the inhomogeneities on the SEM image are most likely large aluminum grains on which the gallium thickness is less. It is important to note that on smooth sections of the cleaved surface, the thickness of the gallium layer does not radically differ. Thus, we can conclude that in the activated product obtained by wetting the surface of the samples with liquid Ga and Ga-In, gallium is not only on the visible surface of the bulk sample, but also inside it, uniformly distributing along the grain boundaries of the starting material. To confirm the presence of gallium on the entire cleaved surface, detailed images of the surface with different magnifications were taken, as well as the mapping method. The mapping results are shown in Fig. 4 . The inhomogeneity of the image in Fig. 4(b) is most likely associated with the morphology of the surface of this cleaved area and the geometric features of the location of the EDX detector relative to the sample in the microscope. To determine the effectiveness of the obtained activated product as a material for a hydrogen cartridge, a test reaction with water was carried out. Fig. 5 shows the curve of hydrogen evolution in the reaction of activated A0 sample at atmospheric pressure. The water temperature at the start of the reaction was 25 °C. As seen from the curve, there are 3 phases of the reaction. The first phase of the interaction is associated with the destruction of the material upon contact with small fragments, as was shown earlier in Fig. 1. Further, there is a rapid intense evolution of hydrogen, passing into the phase of the end of the reaction with a slow evolution of hydrogen, most likely due to the blocking of small particles of the material by the reaction products. Stirring of the reaction medium in the reactor was not performed. XRD analysis (Fig. 6 ) of the reaction products showed the absence of peaks corresponding to metallic aluminum in the diffraction patterns, which confirms that the interaction of the activated material with water was complete."
3,Conclusion,The highly active state of the material based on aluminum alloys activated by gallium eutectics for hydrogen evolution from water is achieved by creating an optimally organized nanostructured system in which the eutectic components are distributed along the grain boundaries of the entire mass of the material. It was shown that the efficiency of interaction of bulk materials activated with Ga-In eutectic with water is not inferior to specially prepared aluminum-based powder products obtained using various techniques.
