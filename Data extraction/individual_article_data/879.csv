0,Introduction,"World demand for energy is increasing. Currently, most of the energy is produced from fossil fuels. However, these resources are limited, and in addition, their exploitation causes great damage to the environment. Therefore, methods of energy generation from renewable sources, eg: biomass, sun, wind, etc., are continuously developed. Biomass combustion is ineffective, especially if it is humid. A better solution is to convert biomass into alcohol. Ethanol may be obtained from sugars contained in the biomass in anaerobic fermentation. (1) C6H12O6 = 2C2H5OH + 2CO2 Then, hydrogen can be obtained from ethanol in the process of steam reforming. (2) C2H5OH + 3H2O = 6H2 + 2CO2 It is a method of producing clean fuel - hydrogen. From hydrogen, it is possible to generate electricity with high efficiency in fuel cells. Carbon dioxide, which is formed at various stages of the process, is reused in the process of photosynthesis by plants and sugar in biomass is recreated. Therefore, there is no accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. (3) 6CO2 + 6H2O = C6H12O6 + 6O2 The photosynthesis and fermentation processes are endothermic. The production of 1 mol of ethanol requires an input of 1355 kJ. The conversion of 1 mol of ethanol to hydrogen requires a further 174 kJ of energy. The total energy cost exceeds the potential profit from the oxidation of the hydrogen obtained. However, about 77% of the energy consumed in endothermic processes falls on photosynthesis. Fortunately, this process consumes solar energy, which is free, and thus steam reforming of ethanol can be a source of hydrogen for the power industry. The process of ethanol steam reforming consists of two chemical reactions: (4) C2H5OH + H2O = 2CO + 4H2 (5) CO + H2O = CO2 + H2 In addition to the above-mentioned reactions of ethanol, it may also decompose at elevated temperatures into various products. (6) C2H5OH = CO + CH4 + H2 (7) C2H5OH = CH3CHO + H2 (8) C2H5OH = C2H4 + H2O Moreover, methanization and Boudouard reactions may occur under high-temperature conditions. (9) CO + 3H2 = CH4 + H2O (10) CO2 + 4H2 = CH4 + 2H2O (11) 2CO = CO2 + C Therefore, the process of ethanol steam reforming is difficult and requires the selection of appropriate process conditions that will eliminate or reduce the share of competitive chemical reactions that lead to a reduction in the efficiency of hydrogen production from ethanol. Research of the process of steam ethanol reforming is focused on finding process conditions, under which hydrogen can be obtained with high material and energy efficiency. Most studies are devoted to the catalytic processes of steam ethanol reforming conducted over heterogeneous catalysts. Usually, these are metals (active phase) deposited on a support, sometimes promoted with additives that affect the structure of the carrier and the morphology of the active phase. The catalyst should be active for a long time and should be mechanically stable. An important problem in the catalytic processes of ethanol steam reforming is the deposition of soot on the catalyst and its deactivation. One possible path of ethanol conversion is dehydration, which leads to the formation of C2H4. This chemical is a precursor of carbon deposits. Although M. Greluk et al. [1] reported that some catalysts are active even when a lot of soot is deposited on them, there are numerous publications indicating that catalysts activity decreased over the course of their work. F. Frusteri et al. [2] reported that ethanol conversion carried out on the Ni/MgO catalyst decreased from 100% to ∼ 45% after 20 h of the operation. While selectivity of the conversion of ethanol into a variety of products has been almost constant for 20 h. A similar observation has been presented by M. Greluk et al. [3]. They reported that the conversion of ethanol carrier out at 420 °C on the Co/ZrO2 catalyst decreased from ∼100% to ∼30% after 24 h. The selectivity of the conversion of ethanol to hydrogen was over 70% during the whole process, but the selectivity of ethanol conversion to CO, CO2, CH4, CH3CHO, (CH3)2CO was changing. Zs. Ferench et al. [4] described different results. The ethanol conversion was ∼100% for 2 h of the Co/Al2O3 catalyst operation at 600 °C. In contrast, the selectivity of ethanol conversion to hydrogen decreased from ∼50 to ∼5%, and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to ethylene increased from ∼0 to ∼50%. To improve the stability of catalysts the process conditions can be changed. M. Greluk et al. [3] reported that an increase in the temperature of the Co/Al2O3 catalyst from 420 to 540 °C caused that ethanol conversion and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to hydrogen were stable for 24 h, while the selectivity of ethanol conversion to CO, CO2, CH4, CH3CHO changed. F. Wang et al. [5] reported that reducing the temperature of the Ir/CrO2 catalyst from 700 to 500 °C resulted in a reduction in the soot production of 2.5 times. It is also possible to improve the catalyst activity and stability by modifying the catalyst composition. S. Ogo et al. [6] reported that the modification of the Co/Al2O3 catalyst by the potassium addition inhibited the deposition of soot on the catalyst. The addition of 3 wt% of K reduces the amount of soot deposited by 398 mg per 1 g of the catalyst within 10 min. F. Frusteri et al. [2] reported that the addition of 1 wt% of K, Na or Li to the Ni/MgO catalyst inhibits the catalyst activity decrease. After 20 h, the conversion of ethanol on the Ni/MgO catalyst decreased from 100% to ∼45%. On the catalysts containing 1 wt% of Na, K or Li the ethanol conversion decreased to ∼55, 60 and 82%, respectively. J.H. Song et al. [7] also reported that the addition of alkaline earth elements increases the lifetime of the Ni/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalyst, e.g. at 450 °C the deactivation began after 1500 min for the catalyst with Sr addition (Sr/Ni molar ratio - 0.18) and after 1250 min for the catalyst without Sr. J.W.C. Liberatori et al. [8] reported that less soot was formed on the 15Ni-12La/Al2O3 catalyst than on the 15Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. No hydrogen was formed on the 12La/Al2O3 catalyst. B.J. Kwak et al. [9] reported that the addition of V to the Ni/SiO2 catalyst resulted in even 4-fold reduction in the amount of carbon black deposited on the catalyst compared to the catalyst without the addition of V. However, the authors observed that the addition of 2.7 at% of V was the most effective. The higher (3.8 at%) or lower (1.4 at%) amount of V added caused that the amount of carbon black produced was 3.2 and 2.4 times less, respectively, compared to the catalyst without the addition of V. R. Buitrago-Sierra et al. [10] reported that better results than 2-metal catalysts can be obtained on catalysts containing 3 metals. The addition of 1 wt% of Pt to the Zn-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts inhibited the formation of C2H4 (a precursor of soot) and allowed the catalyst to operate for over 48 h. Sun et al. [11] presented a structurally complex Pt catalyst system deposited on CrO2, coated with SiO2 and Ni. This system allowed the catalyst activity time to be extended to 28 h. Not every modification improves the properties of the catalyst. J.W.C. Liberatori et al. [8] reported that the addition of silver (0.3 and 0.6 wt%) to the nickel catalyst increased the rate of soot formation. R. Buitrago-Sierra et al. [10] showed that the addition of Zn to the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst decreased the hydrogen production yield and increased the selectivity of ethanol conversion to hydrocarbons. There are also literature reports showing that the carrier has a strong effect on the process of ethanol steam reforming. A.J. Vizcaino et al. [12] studied 5 carriers: Al2O3, SiO2, SBA-15, MCM-41, ZSM-5. Copper (2 wt%) and nickel (14 wt%) were deposited on all supports. The highest selectivity of the conversion of ethanol to hydrogen (79%) and the lowest amount of soot was obtained on the SBA-15 carrier. On Al2O3 3 times more soot was formed and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to hydrogen was 50%. I.I. Soykal et al. [13] reported that Co supported on CeO2, with a nano-cube structure was more active than Co supported on CeO2 with a nano-rod structure. At 500 °C the ethanol conversion was 84.4 and 55.2%, respectively. The selectivity of the conversion of ethanol to hydrogen was 80 and 17.8%, respectively. Although it is possible to extend the catalyst working time, after several hours it is deactivated or soot accumulated between the catalyst grains blocks the flow of reagents. Therefore, non-catalytic processes, e.g. plasma, are also studied. The process of ethanol steam reforming may be conducted in non-equilibrium plasma discharges generated in gas or liquid phases. The advantage of plasma methods is the lack of solids on the product flow path, where particles may be deposited and hence may reduce the efficiency of the process. D. Tsyganov et al. [14] reported that in the microwave discharge from 1 mol of ethanol almost 3 mol of H2 were produced. In addition, there was a lot of CO and soot. T. Q. Hoang et al. [15] showed that they produced more than 3 mol of H2 from 1 mol of ethanol in the corona discharge. Y. Sekine et al. [16] reported that they produced 1.25 mol of H2 from 1 mol of ethanol in the low energy pulsed discharge. B. Wang et al. [17] produced 1.87 mol of H2 with 1 mol of ethanol in the barrier discharges, but reducing the ratio of water to ethanol from 7.7 to 3 resulted in a reduction of hydrogen production to 1.32 mol of H2 from 1 mol of ethanol. B. Hryciak et al. [18] reported that the hydrogen production efficiency depended on the absorbed microwave power. At 5 and 2 kW, 1.74 and 0.85 mol of H2 were formed from 1 mol of ethanol, respectively. Some discharges require additional gas. B. Hryciak et al. [18] introduced N2, while D. Tsyganov et al. [14] introduced Ar. Electric discharge generated directly in the tank with a mixture of ethanol and water [19] also required the introduction of gas into the space between the electrodes to remove liquid from it. However dielectric barrier, spark and corona discharges can operate without the addition of special gases. In this work, barrier discharge was used to produce hydrogen from a mixture of water and ethanol (ethanol steam reforming). Water and ethanol were introduced into the reactor in the liquid phase. The heating of substrates and the change of phase from liquid to gas took place in the reactor. No additional gases were introduced into the reactor, and the high voltage electrode had a special shape that forced the reactants to mix during the flow through the reactor. The process of ethanol steam reforming was carried out at a lower temperature than in catalytic reactors. In the experiments, the discharge power was changed in the range from 10 to 30 W. With the change of the discharge power, the temperature of the gases at the outlet from the reactor changed from 150 to 350 °C. However, the barrier discharge consists of many micro-discharges, in which there are high-energy electrons (1–10 eV) initiating chemical reactions. It is also worth mentioning that the temperature in micro-discharge is about 100 °C higher than the gas temperature [20,21]. The reactor was not sensitive to soot, because the distance between the high voltage electrode and the quartz casing was sufficiently large that the carbon black could not block the gas flow."
1,Experimental,"A schematic diagram of the experimental setup, which was used in the experiments, is shown in Fig. 1 . The flow rates of the water and ethanol feed streams were controlled and regulated by mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst/EIEWIN). Water and ethanol were introduced into the reactor which was preheated to 120 °C by electric discharge, switched on without the flow of substrates. The temperature of the reactor wall was measured by an analog temperature meter with Pt-PtRh thermocouple. The high-voltage electrode was grooved and placed centrally in the reactor (Fig. 2 ). The electrode was made of duralumin. The total length of the high voltage electrode was 88 mm and the electrode surface area, which is followed by energy exchange with the gases was 452 cm2. The high voltage electrode was in a quartz tube with a wall thickness of 3 mm. The outside wall of the quartz tube was covered with a layer of aluminum. The layer of aluminum was a grounded electrode. The width of the discharge gap ranged from 1.5 to 24.5 mm respectively from top and bottom of the grooves. The reactor volume was 100 cm3. The discharge was turned on after introducing the substrates into the reactor. Discharge parameters like the frequency, the voltage and the current were recorded every 15 min, using the Tektronix TDS 3032B oscilloscope with the Tektronix P6015A voltage probe and the Tektronix TCP312 current probe, as well as the Tektronix TCP A300 amplifier. Based on these measurements, the discharge power was calculated according to a formula: (12) P = f · ∫ U · I d t f – frequency, Hz P – discharge power, W U – voltage, V I – current, A t – time, s The stream leaving the reactor was passed through a filter of quartz fibers, on which solid products were retained. Then the gases were cooled, and water and ethanol were condensed. The amount of condensed liquid was measured by weight, and the ethanol concentration in the liquid was determined from the refractive index. The gas flow rate was measured with the Illmer-Gasmesstechnik gas-meter, the temperature and water vapor content in the gases were measured with the Apar AR236/2 sensor. The concentration of the other gases was measured using the HP6890 gas chromatograph. The amount of soot formed was calculated based on the carbon balance. The following parameters were used to assess the process of ethanol steam reforming: hydrogen production, ethanol conversion, hydrogen concentration in cooled gases, energy yield of hydrogen production, and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to the following products: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, soot, hydrogen, methane, ethylene, and ethane. These parameters were measured or calculated according to the following formulas: (13) W [ H 2 ] = q · c V W[H2] – hydrogen production, mol h−1 q – gas flow rate under standard conditions, dm3 h−1 V – molar volume of gas under standard conditions, dm3 mol−1 c – volume fraction of hydrogen (14) x = W i n [ E t O H ] − W [ E t O H ] W i n [ E t O H ] 100 % x – ethanol conversion, % W[EtOH] – ethanol flow rate at the outlet, mol h−1 Win[EtOH] – ethanol flow rate at the inlet, mol h−1 (15) Y = W [ H 2 ] 1000 · P Y – energy yield of hydrogen production, mol(H2) kWh−1 (16) S H 2 = W [ H 2 ] W [ H 2 ] + 2 · W [ C H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] + 3 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] 100 % SH2 – selectivity of ethanol conversion to hydrogen, % W[CH4] – methane production, mol h−1 W[C2H4] – ethylene production, mol h−1 W[C2H6] – ethane production, mol h−1 (17) S C H 4 = 2 · W [ C H 4 ] W [ H 2 ] + 2 · W [ C H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] + 3 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] 100 % SCH4 – selectivity of ethanol conversion to methane, % (18) S C 2 H 4 = 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] W [ H 2 ] + 2 · W [ C H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] + 3 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] 100 % SC2H4 – selectivity of ethanol conversion to ethylene, % (19) S C 2 H 6 = 3 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] W [ H 2 ] + 2 · W [ C H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] + 3 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] 100 % SC2H6 – selectivity of ethanol conversion to ethane, % (20) S C O = W [ C O ] W [ C O ] + W [ C O 2 ] + W [ C H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] + W [ C ] 100 % SCO – selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon monoxide, % W[CO] – carbon monoxide production, mol h−1 W[CO2] – carbon dioxide production, mol h−1 W[C] – soot production, mol h−1 (21) S C O 2 = W [ C O 2 ] W [ C O ] + W [ C O 2 ] + W [ C H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] + W [ C ] 100 % SCO2 – selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon dioxide, % (22) S C = W [ C ] W [ C O ] + W [ C O 2 ] + W [ C H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 4 ] + 2 · W [ C 2 H 6 ] + W [ C ] 100 % SC – selectivity of ethanol conversion to soot, %"
2,Results and discussion,
3,The discharge power,"3.1 The discharge power The discharge power is the basic parameter that influences plasma processes. Fig. 3 shows the effect of the discharge power on the ethanol conversion and the hydrogen concentration in the cooled gases. In this figure it can be seen that the ethanol conversion increases from 18 to 54% with increasing discharge power from 10 to 30 W, whereas the concentration of hydrogen was reduced from 56 to 49% with the increase of discharge power of 10–17 W. A further increase in the discharge power up to 30 W, did not cause more changes in hydrogen concentration. The reduction of the hydrogen concentration is related to the decrease of the selectivity of ethanol conversion into hydrogen and the increase in selectivity of ethanol conversion into ethylene and ethane (Fig. 4 ). The selectivity of conversion of ethanol to methane and carbon dioxide does not change in the tested power range (Figs. 4 and 5 ). In contrast, the selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon monoxide was 22% at 10 W and increased to 29% at 13 W, then decreased to 26% at 30 W. Changes in the selectivity of ethanol conversion to soot exhibit the opposite trend. At 10 W, it was very large and amounted to 42%. It decreased to 23% at a power of 17 W, and then increased with increasing discharge power. The soot was removed from the reactor in the stream of gases exiting the reactor and it was retained on the quartz fiber filter. Hu et al. [22] also studied the process of ethanol steam reforming and also found the presence of these products in the gases leaving the barrier discharge zone. B. Wang et al. [17] reported that C3H6 and C3H8 were also products of ethanol conversion. Plasma is not very selective and similar products were formed in other discharges. T. Q. Hoang et al. [15] reported the presence of H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and C2Hx and B. Hryciak et al. [18] reported the presence of H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and soot in the products of ethanol steam conversion in microwave discharges. Y. Sekine et al. [16] reported the presence of H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and C2Hx in the products of reaction occurring in the low-energy pulsed discharge. A. N. Tsymbalyuk et al. [23] reported the presence of H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 in the products of reaction occurring in the torch discharge. Hydrogen production increased with increasing discharge power. This is due to the increase in ethanol conversion. However, the energy efficiency of hydrogen production depended slightly on the discharge power (Fig. 6 ). The maximum energy yield was reached at 20 W and was 4.5 mol(H2) kWh−1."
4,The molar ratio of water to ethanol,"3.2 The molar ratio of water to ethanol The use of water excess is practiced in the industrial process of steam methane reforming. In this process, the use of water in excess in the feed reduces the amount of soot that deposits on the catalyst. Although in the plasma process, the formation of soot is not a critical factor leading to inhibition of the steam reforming process, the reduction of the amount of soot can lead to an increase in the amount of hydrogen, e.g. as a result of shifting the equilibrium of the reversible reaction: C + H2O = CO + H2 (23) Fig. 7 shows the effect of the molar ratio of water to ethanol on the ethanol conversion and the hydrogen concentration in cooled gases. In this figure, it can be seen that the hydrogen concentration did not change much, ranging from 48 to 52%. The highest value (52%) was achieved with the highest molar ratio of water to ethanol. However, the ethanol conversion increased from 22 to 71% with the increase in the molar ratio of water to ethanol from 1 to 5. As expected, the selectivity of ethanol conversion into hydrogen increased from 50 to 57% with an increase in the molar ratio of water to ethanol from 1 to 5 (Fig. 8 ), and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to soot decreased (Fig. 9 ). In addition, it was observed that the selectivity of ethanol conversion to methane and ethylene (Fig. 8) decreased, and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon dioxide (Fig. 9) increased. The decrease in the selectivity of ethanol conversion to hydrocarbons is positive because the significance of chemical reactions leading to the consumption of hydrogen is reduced. Also, increasing the selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon dioxide is positive because the reaction leading to the formation of carbon dioxide is responsible for the third part of the theoretical production of hydrogen in the process of steam ethanol reforming. Unexpectedly, the selectivity of the conversion of ethanol to carbon monoxide also increased slightly with the increase of the molar ratio of water to ethanol. This indicates that the conditions prevailing in the barrier discharge are unfavorable for the chemical reaction between water and carbon monoxide. Increasing the molar ratio of water to ethanol from 1 to 5 also resulted in an increase in hydrogen production from 0.085 to 0.112 mol H2 and an increase in the energy yield of hydrogen production from 4.25 to 5.6 mol H2 per kWh (Fig. 10 )."
5,The flow rate of the feed stream,"3.3 The flow rate of the feed stream The flow rate of the feed stream is closely related to the residence time of the reactants in the reactor; the conversion increases with increasing residence time. Confirmation of this principle can be seen in Fig. 11 . The ethanol conversion decreases with increasing feed flow rate. The chemical composition of the mixture approaches equilibrium with increasing residence time. According to another principle, in reactors in which many chemical reactions can take place, the change in residence time changes the composition of post-reaction gases. In the process of steam ethanol reforming carbon monoxide is first formed, and carbon dioxide is formed in the subsequent reaction from carbon monoxide. Fig. 12 shows the selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon monoxide increased with the increase of the feed flow rate, whereas the selectivity of ethanol conversion to carbon dioxide decreased. This is due to a shorter residence time of the reactants in the reactor because the rate and significance of the subsequent reactions increase as the residence time increases. Increasing the feed flow rate increases the hydrogen production and the energy yield of hydrogen production (Fig. 13 ). This is related to the ethanol conversion and chemical equilibrium. The ethanol conversion decreases with increasing flow rate (Fig. 11) and the chemical composition is further away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. As a result of this, the reaction rate between ethanol and water is high and the energy supplied to the reactor is more effectively used."
6,Conclusions,"In the barrier discharges, hydrogen can be produced from a mixture of water and ethanol without introducing additional gases to facilitate electrical breakdown. Products of chemical reactions occurring in the reactor are H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and soot. The soot particles are removed from the reactor along with a stream of gaseous products and do not interfere with the operation of the reactor. The discharge power, the molar ratio of water to ethanol and the flow rate of the feed stream influenced the process of steam ethanol reforming in the barrier discharge. Depending on these parameters, the ethanol conversion, the energy yield of hydrogen production and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to various products changes. The highest ethanol conversion was 71% and it was obtained at the power of 20 W, the molar ratio of water to ethanol of 5 and a feed flow rate of 0.6 mol/h. However, the higher energy yield of hydrogen production was obtained at the same power but with a different molar ratio of water to ethanol and feed flow rate, which were 3 and 1.4 mol/h, respectively. Under these conditions, the energy yield of hydrogen production was 6.15 mol(H2) kWh−1."
