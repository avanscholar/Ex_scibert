0,Introduction,"Since the enormous consumption of the fossil fuel, it has caused not only economical crunch but also changes in global climate. Hydrogen and ethanol were the most frequently suggested alternative energy resources in the future while recent economic studies suggested that production of chemicals and energy by using renewable biomass resources could solve the problems caused by organic waste at the same time [1,2]. This is the reason why microbe-fermentative bio-energy production plays an important role in global carbon cycling and has been considered as an environment friendly process. In nature, many species of microorganisms coexist by interacting with each other, while many species of microorganisms are most effective only when they are present in association with other groups of organisms. It has been suggested that the beneficial effects of associated microbes on cellulose digestion were not the consequence of direct influence on the cellulase system but rather occurred through synthesis of essential nutrients, establishment of a suitable anaerobic environment, or removal of toxic metabolites [3]. Since cellulolytic anaerobic Clostridia and aerobic Bacillus are often simultaneously detected at various sites where cellulose degradation occurs, such as rice paddy soils [4], and water retting pond [5], coexistence of these anaerobic and aerobic bacteria has been assumed to be important for effective cellulose degradation[6]. On the other hand, the anaerobic conversion of carbohydrates into acetone, butanol, and ethanol, which is known as acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation, by several strains of Clostridium spp. was first described more than half a century ago. Previous studies regarding exceptional ABE fermentation strain, Clostridium beijerinckii [7], have extensively focused on such as fed-batch fermentation [8], heat-shocking batch fermentation [9], cell immobilization-batch fermentation [10], corn substrate fermentation [11], molasses substrate fermentation [12], thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase [13], and butanol-tolerant mutant [14]. The C. beijerinckii can utilize a wide range of carbohydrates, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, and lignocellulosic hydrolysates (such as glucose, cellobiose, fructose, maltose, arabinose, and xylose) which are generated during degradation of plant polysaccharides [15], while the expensive hydrolysis step is still a needed process for its fermentation. Though the genetically modified C. beijerinckii cells have been transformed to express glycoside hydrolases for cellulose decompose [16], the complicated component of renewable raw materials (such as agricultural residues, industry organic solid waste, and food waste) is very recalcitrant to degradation by one or few enzymes transgenosis of bacteria. Furthermore, hydrogen-evolving Clostridium has been attracted more attentions due to their potential in biological hydrogen production from either renewable solid biomass [1] or wastewater [17], while C. beijerinckii also was known in this aspect [18]. On the other hands, species of the genus Bacillus are industrially important by their high growth rate, ability to secrete extracellular proteins and safety to be used with regard to health and environmental aspects [19]. Particularly, they can secrete many kinds of saccharification-related extracellular enzymes such as cellulase, gelatinase, pectinase, amylase and proteases, where could hydrolysis complex insoluble compounds to soluble monomers [20,21]. To monitor the specific microbes with particular metabolic activity, molecular tools such as functional gene-targeted reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), functional gene-targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combining with flow cytometry analysis have been developed in the previous study and were used to analyze the bacterial community composition and to trace the major players in our bio-hydrogen-producing system [22–25]. By using hydrogenase gene-targeted molecular monitoring and DGGE analysis, it has been suggested that the Bacillus and hydrogen-producing Clostridium represented the major players in the system with high metabolic ability [24,25]. In this study, isolation and characterization of the major contributors from the original mixed microflora system were performed and we also offer the direct evidence to show that the two bacterial strains were living together in a commensalic relationship not only by the oxygen consumption but also via the complementary of extracellular enzymes. Furthermore, since the clostridial strain is the commensal that obtains the symbiont benefits from bacillus, it is likely that over-growth of the bacillus strain will remain nothing for clostridial partner. This is reason why we would like to examine the combinational ratio of the co-culture system in this study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms,"2.1 Microorganisms C. beijerinckii L9, a high hydrogen-producing strain, was isolated from brewery yeast waste fermentation system (this study). B. thermoamylovorans I was isolated from brewery yeast waste fermentation system [24]."
3,Growing fermentative culture,"2.2 Growing fermentative culture Anaerobic fermentation of hydrogen-producing batch culture was followed the previous fermentor condition [23]. The 80ml working volume anaerobic atmospheres culture bottle (anaerobic CB-80, Genetalks Co., Ltd., Taiwan) with growth medium contained per liter of water: 18.75g of brewery yeast waste, 80g of NH4HCO3, 40g of KH2PO4, 0.4g of NaCl, 0.11g of FeCl2, 4g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.4g of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.4g of CaCl2·2H2O, and 0.6g of MnSO4·7H2O. Microflora-containing compost made of wasted rice straw and cattle dung was used as inoculum. Before inoculation, the compost was dried in 85°C oven for 3h to remove any non-endospore-forming bacteria, then, 64g of compost was suspended in 64ml of water to inoculate each batch fermentor. The fermentor was agitated at 200rpm and gassed with N2 under a growing temperature of 40°C. This medium was also used to perform the co-cultures. A 12h log phase culture of the strains was used as inoculum, 4ml in the case of pure cultures and a mixture of 2ml of each strain in the case of co-culture."
4,Enrichment and isolation procedure,"2.3 Enrichment and isolation procedure One milliliter each of mixed microflora samples from fermentative batch culture was heated in 85°C water bath for 15min to exclude non-spore-forming vegetative cells. Then, the cell samples were inoculated into 15-ml anaerobic pressure tubes containing 10ml of PYG medium [each liter contained: peptone, 5g; tryptone, 5g; yeast extract, 10g; K2HPO4, 2g; cysteine HCl, 0.5g; FeSO4, 1.1mg; resazurin, 10mg; CaCl2 (anhydrous), 0.2g; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.48g; K2HPO4, 1.0g; KH2PO4, 1.0g; NaHCO3, 10g; NaCl, 2g; glucose, 10g; and glutathione, 0.25g] and incubated at 40°C. Test tubes were closed with rubber stoppers and screw-cap seals, and medium was flushed with sterile nitrogen for anaerobic treatment. After five times of transfer, enrichment cultures were diluted serially and streaked onto soild PYG medium(1.5% agar) incubated with anaerobic GasPak jar (BBL GasPak 100™ Anaerobic System). Single colonies were isolated and transferred to and maintained in liquid PYG medium for further analysis."
5,Extracellular enzyme activity detection,"2.4 Extracellular enzyme activity detection For determination of extracellular enzyme activity, a 24-h single colony of the test isolates was detected on specific agar plates. Screening of lipase and protease on agar plates were each done by using 1% Tributyrin (Sigma, US) and 20% Skim Milk (BD Difco, US) as a substrate. [26] Lipase and protease activities were indicated as a clear zone around the colony after incubated at 37°C. Starch agar was contained 0.4% soluble starch for α-amylase detection. After incubation (preferably for several days) the medium is flooded with Gram's iodine. The CMCase activity was detected by adding 0.1% substrate, and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), to the solid media. Subsequently, the hydrolysis zone around the colony staining by Congo Red (Sigma, US) [27]."
6,Gene sequencing and alignment analysis,"2.5 Gene sequencing and alignment analysis Genomic DNA was extracted and PCR analysis with 16Sf/16Sr and Ef/Er primer pairs (Table 1 ) for amplification 16S rRNA gene and hydrogenase gene individually. After initial heating to 94°C for 3min, 30 cycles of 94°C (30s), 50°C (1min), and 72°C (1min) were performed PCR reaction. The PCR products from isolate bacteria obtained were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega Biotech) and subject to DNA sequencing. Sequencing was performed with an ABI automated DNA sequencer by using a prism dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems Ltd.). Sequence data were aligned with the sequences of various members of the bacterial phylum whose gene sequences were obtained from GenBank by the BLAST program (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Positions of sequence and alignment uncertainty were omitted from the analysis, and the pairwise evolutionary distances were computed from levels of similarity by using the ClustalW algorithm (Feng-Doolittle and Thompson) for optimal alignment. The phylogenetic tree analysis was reexamined by using 1000 bootstrapped data sets and performed by the global alignment algorithm (Wilbur and Lipman) for fast alignment with the DNAMAN version 4.11 program (Lynnon Biosoft, Quebec, Canada)."
7,Determinations,"2.6 Determinations The amount of biogas produced during the growing period was measured with plastic syringe. The existence of hydrogen was analyzed by a GC-TCD (GC-8A gas chromatograph, Shimadzu do Brasil Comércio Ltda.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2m×2mm (internal diameter) stainless steel column packed with Porapak N (80–100 mesh). The working temperature of injector, detector, and column was kept at 57°C, 180°C, and 50°C, respectively, during the measuring period. Then concentration of the volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols including ethanol, propanol and butanol was established using a GC-FID."
8,Experimental design and regression analysis of co-culture,"2.7 Experimental design and regression analysis of co-culture In order to find the influence and optimal combinational ratio of C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I on the anaerobic chemostat reactor for converting brewery yeast waste to hydrogen, 36 runs of experiments were performed with the 120ml (working volume=80ml) bioreactor. In each run, the reactor was seeded with fresh seeded bacteria and data were collected at the end of experimental period of approximately 4 days while the reactor reached a quasi-stationary state. Once the reactor reached the state, the average lag phases were registered. Two equations were used, one to describe the hydrogen production the other to evaluate the optimisation of co-culture bacterial system on the hydrogen-producing process. The details are outlined as follows: (1) Thus, H2 production curves were obtained for each experimental run. Each curve was modeled to the data using the modified Gompertz equation. (1) H ( t ) = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } A cumulative H2 production curve best fitted by minimizing the ratio of the sum of square error to the correlation coefficient using “Solver” function in the “Tools” menu in Microsoft Excel 2000. The curve was initially fit visually and was subjected to the constraints of H2 producing potential, P (ml), the H2 producing rate, R m (mlH2/day), and the lag phase, λ (day). (2) The effects of C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I on the lag phase (λ, day) were analyzed as (2) Y i = β 0 + β 1 x 1 + β 2 x 2 + β 3 x 3 + β 11 x 1 2 + β 22 x 2 2 + β 33 x 3 2 + β 12 x 1 x 2 + β 13 x 1 x 3 + β 23 x 2 x 3 where, Y i is predicted response; x 1 and x 2 are variables (i.e., L9 and I); βo is the offset term; β 1, β 2, and β 3 are linear coefficients; β 11, β 22, and β 33 are the squared coefficients; and β 12, β 13, and β 23 are the interaction coefficients. Multiple regression was performed using the function “LINEST” in Microsoft Excel 2003."
9,Results,
10,Isolation and gene sequence phylogenetic analysis of clostridial strains,"3.1 Isolation and gene sequence phylogenetic analysis of clostridial strains According to the observation of previous studies, hydrogen-producing Clostridial strains were the major contributors in the system [24]. To isolate the predominant hydrogen-producing clostridial strains in the fermentative culture, bacterial cells were collected at optimal hydrogen-producing phase and were heated at 80°C to kill non-spore-forming bacteria, and were cultivated anaerobically in PYG medium. After several times sub-culturing, there were four kinds of colony morphology observed from the agar plate spread with the supernatant of anaerobic fermentation batch culture. Four isolated colonies (L9, Z2, Z5-1 and W8) were randomly picked-up from the plate for the further anaerobic batch culture. The genomic DNA of the four isolates was purified and PCR amplification of the 16S ribosome RNA with 16Sf/16Sr primer pair (Table 1) for species identification was performed. After cloning and sequencing, the four isolates were belong to the clostridial genus and their species were identified as C. beijerinckii with 99% identities, Clostridium diolis with 99% identities, Clostridium roseum with 99% identities, and C. roseum with 100% identities, respectively. The four clostridial isolates were designated as C. beijerinckii L9, C. diolis Z2, C. roseum Z5-1, and C. roseum W8 in this study and the results of a sequence alignment, followed by a phylogenetic analysis of the rRNA gene sequence in which representatives of the families of the domain Clostridium were used, indicated that all the isolated strains were high related with each other and belongs to the cluster I clostridia family such as C. butyricum (Fig. 1 ). On the other hands, the hydrogenase genes of the four isolates were also amplified with Ef/Er primer pair by PCR reaction (Table 1). Although the comparison of the isolates 16S rRNA sequences were phylogenetically closely related to each other, but the amino acid sequences of their hydrogenase gene were not identical and one of them was placed in separate clusters (Fig. 2 ). These results strongly suggested that the clostridial hydrogenase genes were different at the species level or even at the strain level."
11,Microbe characterization and hydrogen-producing ability analysis,"3.2 Microbe characterization and hydrogen-producing ability analysis The pure culture batch fermentation systems which inoculated C. beijerinckii L9, C. diolis Z2, C. roseum Z5-1, and C. roseum W8 were used to convert the brewery yeast waste to hydrogen, respectively. The 80ml of brewery yeast waste medium was prepared with anaerobic pretreatment by nitrogen gas flushing and sterilization to make sure the hydrogen was produced by the pure culture. All of the clostridial isolates could convert the brewery yeast waste to hydrogen, except C. roseum Z5-1 (Fig. 3a). The accumulated volume of hydrogen which produced by C. beijerinckii L9 was approached 70ml, and the volume of hydrogen was transcended than other clostridial isolates in this study (Fig. 3a). The batch fermentation systems without anaerobic pretreatment and sterilization were also inoculated with C. beijerinckii L9, C. diolis Z2, C. roseum Z5-1, and C. roseum W8, respectively, for comparing the hydrogen productivity. The 25ml of hydrogen gas which produced by C. roseum W8 inoculated batch culture, might contribute by the microflora existed in the original brewery yeast waste (Fig. 3b). Although the hydrogen productivity was affected by the oxygen inhibition and bacterial interference, the C. beijerinckii L9 still can perform advantageous hydrogen production than others (Fig. 3b)."
12,Co-culture of the C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I,"3.3 Co-culture of the C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I For imitating the original culturing situation, the brewery yeast waste without sterilize and anaerobic pretreated was used as substrate for hydrogen-producing batch culture. The batch culture without inoculum was used as a control and could produce only 40ml of hydrogen gas (Fig. 4d ). The inoculated batch culture, with microflora from compost, could reach the hydrogen productivity to 60ml (Fig. 4c). To confirm the hydrogen productivity of isolated C. beijerinckii L9 and microflora, the brewery yeast waste with sterilization and anaerobic pretreatment was used as substrate for pure culturing test. One milliliter (OD600=2.0) of C. beijerinckii L9 both strain cultures on PYG broth was inoculated into 80ml of brewery yeast waste medium and the accumulated volume of hydrogen production was as equal amount to microflora inoculum with re-productivity (Fig. 4b). To reconstruct the effective bacterial community for hydrogen production, C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I cultures on PYG broth were inoculated into sterilized brewery yeast waste medium without anaerobic pretreatment by N2 flushing. After 24h of growing period, the co-cultured batch culture produced more accumulated hydrogen volume (about 80ml; Fig. 4a) than that of C. beijerinckii L9 (only about 60ml; Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the both co-cultures formed major fermentative products including ethanol (about 70mg/l) and butyrate (about 800mg/l) (Fig. 5b, c) within 24h. The result from colony counting shown that the growth rate of B. thermoamylovorans I was quick than C. beijerinckii L9 at the early 24h, while the cell numbers of C. beijerinckii L9 were more than B. thermoamylovorans I after 24h growing period (Fig. 5d)."
13,Extracellular enzyme activities of B. thermoamylovorans I and C. beijerinckii L9,"3.4 Extracellular enzyme activities of B. thermoamylovorans I and C. beijerinckii L9 According to the multiple enzyme activity assays by agar plate test, B. thermoamylovorans I has shown the protease, lipase, and amylase activities (Fig. 6a). It indicates that B. thermoamylovorans I has the ability to digest large organic molecule, such as protein, fatty acid, and starch, in the complicated biomass substrates. Moreover, the pectinase and cellulase activity (Fig. 6a) that directly related to lignocellulose degradation was also shown by the agar plate test. This result indicates that B. thermoamylovorans I has the potential to degrade the pectin linkage between lignin and cellulose that could make bacterial degradation of cellulose more easy. On the other hand, C. beijerinckii L9 shows only amylase activity (Fig. 6b) and cannot use cellulose as the only carbon source. These evidences strongly suggested that B. thermoamylovorans I would digest the complicated substrates from brewery yeast waste into small molecules for the Clostridium to utilize."
14,Co-culture analysis of the C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I,"3.5 Co-culture analysis of the C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I Series of 80ml batch cultures according to full factory design were performed to understand the relationship between C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I and their optimal combination ratio. To facilitate a straightforward examination of the relationship between C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans I, the contour plots were constructed (Table 2 ). Table 2 summarizes the design matrix with their P, R m and λ data. The diagnosis results presented that correlation coefficients, R 2, were larger than 0.90, meaning that a perfect fit to the experimental data. An examination of Table 2 indicates that hydrogen-producing potential (P) increased from 40ml to 90ml when C. beijerinckii L9 existed. At the same time, the adding of B. thermoamylovorans I, could strengthen the hydrogen-producing rate (R m) and shorten the lag phase (λ) for producing hydrogen. To evaluate systematically the relationship between C. beijerinckii L9 (X) and B. thermoamylovorans I (Y) on the lag phase (λ), the design matrix with the corresponding results in Table 2 was subjected to regression analysis and generated the following equations: (3) λ = 0.015 X 2 + 0.003 Y 2 − 0.453 X − 0.085 Y + 3.706 ( R 2 = 0.787 ) To facilitate a straightforward examination of the dependence of C. beijerinckii L9 (X) and B. thermoamylovorans I, the effects of two factors in the λ and that expressed by Eq. (3) are illustrated in Fig. 7 . An examination of Fig. 7 indicates that response surface had a short lag phase of 0 day occurred at C. beijerinckii L9 (7×106 cfu) and B. thermoamylovorans I (9.8×106 cfu). This result indicates that the B. thermoamylovorans I existed would have significant ability to shorten lag phase time to convert waste yeast to hydrogen. Experimental results indicated that B. themoamylovorans I plays an important role on the enhancement of C. beijerinckii L9 producing hydrogen. That was because the B. themoamylovorans I could stimulate hydrogen-producing potential and hydrogen production rate, and shorten the lag of their co-culture. A hydrogen-producing yield of 91.6 (mlH2) from a 80-ml co-culture batch experiment could be found when 19.2ml of C. beijerinckii L9 (8.7×106 cfu) was mixed with 14.4ml of B. thermoamylovorans I (9.8×106 cfu)."
15,Discussion,"In this study, clostridia strains were attractive for us to isolated mainly because their high potential for both ABE fermentation and hydrogen producing. For enriching the clostridial spore and using as inoculum in batch fermentation, the compost prepared from rice straw and cattle dung was heated at 85°C for 3h to remove non-spore-forming bacteria [1]. Although the clostridia strains isolated from same origin, C. beijerinckii L9, C. diolis Z2, C. roseum Z5-1, and C. roseum W8, shown high homogeny to each other by 16S rRNA sequence, while their hydrogen-producing ability was not uniformed. This may due to the differences on metabolic pathway and substrate utilities. Interestingly, although Z5-1 and W8 belong to the same species, the difference of hydrogen production efficiency might be caused by the variation of hydrogenase genes. However, the diversity of hydrogenase and their corresponding hydrogen production efficiency is another factor that should be addressed. A heat-tolerated Bacillus strain, B. thermoamylovorans I, was isolated from our batch fermentation [24]. The non-sporulating bacterium, B. thermoamylovorans, was dominance in the composting process [28,29], and could be consider as the starter of bioconversion of sewage sludge and food waste mixture into organic fertilizer [30,31]. As some aerobic Bacillus species and facultative anaerobic members of Enterobacteriaceae are also known as hydrogen producers and anaerobic environment creators, their contributions in our hydrogen-producing system need to be elucidated [23]. From this study it is clear that the indigenous isolate identified as B. thermoamylovorans I has the ability to hydrolyze cellulose, starch, and protein into reducing sugars (data not shown). To reconstruct the effective bacterial community for hydrogen production, B. thermoamylovorans I and C. beijerinckii L9 were inoculated into sterilized brewery yeast waste medium without anaerobic pretreatment by N2 flushing. As the B. thermoamylovorans I could not perform hydrogen production [23], the result suggested that the Bacillus may function as an oxygen consumer to create an anaerobic condition for C. beijerinckii L9. It was known that the genus Bacillus was one of the most widely used bacteria for industrial enzymes producing, and has been shown the ability to produce amylolytic, protelytic and cellulolytic enzymes [32–34]. Simultaneously, the adaptable oxidation reduction potential environment and benefit using substrates which were provided by Bacillus, C. beijerinckii L9 was the beneficiary in this co-culture system and the circumstance of growth. It was also keeping up with B. thermoamylovorans I briskly (Fig. 5d). A greater part of symbiosis co-culture system study was in more or less intimate union of two dissimilar organisms. In our case, the two genus of bacteria were living together by complementary of extracellular enzyme for commensalism. The co-existence of these enzymes on one Bacillus strain has a great advantage in the bioprocess as it can eliminate the need for adding another microorganisms or enzymes to improve the hydrolysis. These are the reasons why we call this a “syntrophic co-culture” case. On the other hands, Bacillus also was reported to solve the problem of fermentative inhibitors, such as acetic acid, uronic acid, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, and lignin degradation products, which generated by pretreatment processes of aqueous hemicellulose streams. Although the attractive aspect of producing solvents was not observed in significant amounts by the two strains co-culture system, but the solvents producing C. beijerinckii L9 could be modified or exchanged for enhancing the co-ordinate ABE fermentation in the co-culture system. Further use of these kinds of Bacillus strains in fermentation system is interesting. Hydrogen-producing system using microflora is likely to contaminate with pathogenic microbes, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium difficile [35]. The C. beijerinckii has been reported for working effectively against baneful clostridial strains by producing bacteriocin or circularin A [36,37]. The species of clostridia were also belong to Clostridium butyricum family which has been reported to produce high levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as a probiotic for Helicobacter pylori therapy or raising up the immunity of human colonic epithelial cells [38–41]. On the other hands, Bacillus was also used as a probiotic in poultry aquaculture [42], aquatic products industry [43,44], livestock husbandry [45], egg qualities of layers [46], and human healthy [47]. The species of Bacillus, B. thermoamylovorans, which were exhibited phenotypic characteristics similar to another probiotic of Lactobacillus [21] was well-suited for simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation of the biomass-derived sugars to lactic acid [48]. Both of the bacterial genus, Clostridium and Bacillus, were composition in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle which acted as accomplice for the digestive system and will further concussed as the administration of probiotics [49,50]. These discussions suggest a great potential in producing byproducts for the further usage of the bacterial combination. Since consolidated bioprocessing involved the aerobic and anaerobic procedures, ability of oxygen consumption for creating the anaerobic environment is needed by the partner microbe. This syntrophic co-culture system may greatly contribute to construct an industrialized plant for converting the complex biomass substrate into bio-energy and other useful byproducts by making the anaerobic fermentation process easier and more economical to be operated."
