0,Introduction,"The scarcity of petroleum related fuels and the associated pollution problems during their combustion have attracted the attention towards the search of alternative fuels [1–3]. Hydrogen is expected to become an important energy carrier for sustainable energy consumption due to its clean-burning nature. It can be used as fuel either directly in internal combustion engines (ICE) or, indirectly to supply electricity using polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, in which electricity is produced by electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen across a proton conducting membrane, resulting a significantly low impact on the environment [4,5]. Currently H2 in the form of compressed gas (200–300 bar), liquid (−253°C) or in hydrogen-storage materials are being used for onboard storage of hydrogen in fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). But the technical limitations associated with storage, safety, and refueling restrict the use of H2 for mobile fuel cell applications. These problems can be overcome by the production of hydrogen onboard the vehicle from a suitable H2 rich liquid fuel, such as methanol. Methanol can easily be converted into a hydrogen-rich gas in the temperature range of 200–300°C using a catalytic reactor. Also, the hydrogen/carbon ratio is high and there is no carbon–carbon bond, minimizing the chance for coke formation. Hydrogen is being obtained from methanol by steam reforming [6,7], decomposition [8,9], partial oxidation [10–13] or oxidative steam reforming [14,15] techniques. Among these methods, selective production of H2 by partial oxidation (POM) is having some obvious advantages, since it is an exothermic reaction and higher reaction rate is expected which shortens the reaction time to reach the working temperature from the cold start-up conditions. The most widely used catalysts for hydrogen production from methanol by partial oxidation are Cu-Zn-based catalysts over conventional supports such as Al2O3 and SiO2 [16–18]. The metallic copper is an active species for hydrogen generation from CH3OH in Cu-Zn-based catalysts and the activity of the catalyst is linearly dependent on the metallic copper surface area of the catalyst [19–22]. Also, it is reported that Cu+ species helps to increase the activity of the Cu-based catalyst. Both Cu0 and Cu+ species are essential for hydrogen generation from CH3OH and the activity of catalyst is dependent on the ratio of Cu+/Cu0 in the catalyst [23]. Still there are some controversies concerning the nature of active species of Cu and the role of Zn in Cu-Zn-based POM catalysts. It was reported that addition of Zn results an increase in dispersion of copper as well as the stability of Cu+ species in the catalyst [24,25]. Alejo et al. [24] studied POM reaction with oxygen over a series of Cu-Zn catalysts and found that the catalytic activity is directly related to the copper metal surface area. Further they reported that presence of aluminum showed an inhibiting effect in methanol conversion, while the selectivities for H2 and CO2 and catalyst stability are enhanced. They concluded that the copper metal is active for POM to H2 and CO2, whereas Cu+ favors the formation of H2O and CO and Cu2+ as CuO shows very low activity for methanol conversion producing only CO2 and H2O. Navarro et al. [26] used Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 in oxidized, reduced and reduced+air-exposed samples for POM in order to study the importance of the initial state of the catalyst and found that the temperature at which the reaction starts was shifted to higher values, when the degree of surface oxidation increased. Mechanistic aspects of POM to H2 and CO2 over Cu/ZnO with different Cu0 surface area were studied and found that the reaction depends on the presence of both ZnO and Cu0 phases [27]. Wang et al. [18] investigated the POM activities of Cu/SiO2 and Cu/Zn/SiO2 prepared by deposition-precipitation method. The catalyst with 10% Cu loading (Cu:Zn, 7:3) exhibits the highest CH3OH conversion and H2 selectivity. Further, Cu0 is active species for higher activity, but Cu+ inhibits the POM to H2. The appropriate introduction of Zn enhanced the Cu0 dispersion, which resulted in higher activity for H2 production. However, over loading of Zn resulted in the formation of bigger crystallites of Cu2O which decreases the activity of the catalyst. Hydrogen production by POM over a series of binary Cu/Cr and ternary Cu/Cr/M (M=Fe, Zn, Ce, etc.) catalysts prepared by co-precipitation method was studied [28]. The results showed that Cu60Cr40 catalyst exhibits high CH3OH conversion and H2 selectivity as compared with other binary catalysts and the introduction of Zn as promoter not only helps to increase the activity of Cu60Cr40 catalyst but also improves the stability of the catalyst. Recently, Navarro et al. [29] compared the POM activity of Cu-Zn catalysts deposited by impregnation on activated carbon, carbon black and carbon fibers and found that different degrees of dispersion and uniformity in the distribution of metal precursors depending on the nature of the support and metal loading. Further, in addition to copper dispersion, other factors such as distribution, accessibility and the nature of the active sites govern hydrogen generation from POM. Further they reported that 10.7% Cu-6.9% Zn on activated carbon exhibited good activity as a result of better accessibility of the active phase partially deposited on the exterior of the carbon grains. Despite their higher activity and selectivity for the H2 production from CH3OH, the conventional Cu/ZnO-based catalysts have problems associated with long-term stability, low resistance to contaminants and the formation of poisonous CO as a byproduct. Therefore, the development of new efficient catalyst systems that exhibit an improved long-term stability and selectivity towards hydrogen production is highly desired. The new carbon forms like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanofibers (CNFs) have generated an intense effervescence in the scientific community due to their well known fascinating properties. Exploring their ability as support for the production of efficient heterogeneous catalysts is one of the current objectives of research [30,31]. The CNTs are found to offer some advantages such as the electronic property, high mechanical strength and thermal stability and the possibility to create anchoring sites, over conventional supports such as carbon, Al2O3 and SiO2. Also, the catalytically active metal nanoparticles can be implemented in the cavities or in the external walls of the CNTs. The Ru/CNTs catalysts were used in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and higher (92%) conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol was observed [32]. The CNTs induced a metal–support interaction of a different kind to that existing for Ru supported on alumina or activated carbon. Recently, CNTs and CNFs supported Ni catalyst was studied for H2 production from ethylene decomposition and found that catalyst 0.5wt% Ni/CNTs showed 50 times higher H2 yield compared to 0.3wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst under similar experimental conditions [33]. Further they found that 0.5wt% Ni is approximately an optimum metal loading in the 0.15–10wt% range studied. No report is available on the usage of CNTs as support for Cu-Zn catalysts for POM to hydrogen. Hence, in the present study, it is aimed to use CNTs as support for Cu-Zn catalysts and study their catalytic activity in POM reaction under different experimental conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template,"2.1 Preparation of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template Two-step anodization procedure reported by Masuda and Fukuda [34] was followed with slight modification to get AAO template. Pure (99.5%) aluminum metal piece was cleaned with mixture of H3PO4/HNO3/H2O/CuSO4 (89ml/7ml/40ml/0.5g) at 80°C. Using the chemically polished Al metal as anode, anodization was carried out at 1°C in 0.3M oxalic acid for 1h at 40V. Then the Al metal was deoxidized with a phosphoric acid/chromic acid mixture solution (3g CrO3 +15.2ml 85wt% H3PO4 in 250ml of water) at 70–80°C for 1h. Further, the second anodization was carried out under the same experimental conditions for 60h. Finally, the electrode terminals are exchanged in order to remove the formed AAO layer from Al surface. The optimization of pore diameter was made by etching the AAO template in 5% H3PO4 solution for 30min."
3,Growth and characterisation of CNTs,"2.2 Growth and characterisation of CNTs The CNTs were grown over AAO template by CVD method. The AAO template is taken in a ceramic boat and heated to 650°C in N2 atmosphere (100ml/min). The carbon source acetylene gas (40ml/min) was passed over the template for 2h. Then, N2 flow was continued for another 6h and cooled to room temperature. In order to remove the AAO template, the products were stirred with 23% HF for 30h and finally filtered, washed with deionized water to remove HF and dried to get the pure CNTs. The SEM images of AAO and purified CNTs were recorded in on JEOL 840A scanning electron microscope. The samples were first coated with carbon and then with gold and used for scanning. Similarly, the microstructure of CNTs was studied by transmission electron microscope (TEM) using Philips CM 12 instrument. The CNTs were dispersed in acetone by sonication and a drop of the sample was placed over a holy carbon coated copper grid and subjected to imaging. Using Rigaku XRD instrument with Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.1541nm) and Ni filter, the XRD pattern of the CNTs sample was recorded in the 2θ range 10–80° with a scan rate of 0.05°/s. The vibrational modes of CNTs were measured in the range of 1000–2000cm−1 using Renishaw Raman spectrometer equipped with a Nd:YAG laser source. The thermal stability of the grown CNTs was studied by thermo gravimetric analysis in Perkin-Elmer (Pyris Diamond) TGA instrument. Using air as carrier gas, the TGA measurements were recorded at a heating rate of 4°C/min and the carrier gas flow rate is 40cm3/min. The elemental analysis of the purified CNTs was carried out on Perkin-Elmer ELAN 5000 ICP-MS instrument."
4,Preparation and characterisation of Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts,"2.3 Preparation and characterisation of Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts The CNTs are chemically inert without any functional group on the surface. The functionalization of CNTs was carried out by refluxing with mixture of equal volume of 4N HNO3 +H2SO4 for 6h, followed by drying at 120°C for over night. The Cu-Zn catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method using Na2CO3 as precipitating agent. In a typical synthesis, required amounts of aqueous solution of nitrates of copper and zinc were mixed with CNTs and stirred for 2h at 60–70°C. Then, aqueous Na2CO3 solution (0.25M) was added with stirring till the pH of the medium reaches 8. The stirring and temperature were maintained for 5h. Finally, the Cu-Zn/CNTs were filtered, washed and dried at 120°C for over night. Likewise, different catalysts with varying Cu and Zn contents were prepared. The weight percentage of metal components for various catalysts is indicated in the catalyst notations. The H2-TPR of Cu-Zn catalysts were performed at atmospheric pressure using CHEMBET 3000 TPR analyser, at a linearly programmed rate of 5°C/min up to 600°C, with 3% H2 in N2 stream at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The amount of the consumed H2 was monitored by a TCD. The BET surface area of pure CNTs and reduced Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts were analysed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption method at 77K on a Micromeritics 2000 ASAP analyser. Before the analysis, all the samples (0.2g) were degassed at 200°C for 2–3h under vacuum in the degas port of the analyser. The surface area was calculated following the BET procedure. The CO chemisorption using the volumetric technique was performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument to determine the total CO uptake of the catalysts. The samples (0.1g) were first evacuated to 5×10−3 Torr and then reduced at 300°C for 3h in flowing hydrogen (40ml/min). After reduction, again the sample was evacuated at 200°C. Finally, the chemisorption experiments were carried out at 35°C. Two consecutive isotherms were obtained and extrapolated to zero pressure. The difference in CO uptake at zero pressure between the two isotherms corresponded to the amount of CO chemisorbed. Powder XRD patterns of the Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with a nickel filtrated Cu Kα radiation, 2θ angles from 10° to 80° at a scanning speed of 0.05°/s. Debye–Scherer equation was applied to Cu (111) diffraction peak at 2θ =43.2° to calculate the crystallite size. For TEM measurements, the reduced (H2, 300°C) Cu-Zn/CNTs samples were dispersed in acetone by sonication and a drop of the sample was placed on a holey carbon coated copper microgrid and subjected to imaging in Philips CM 12 instrument. The number-average particle size was calculated by measuring the size of about 50 particles for each sample using the relation d n =∑n i d i /∑n i . In order to study the nature of Cu species, DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer IR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector using 256 scans and a resolution of 4cm−1. The catalyst powder (5mg) was placed into the IR in situ cell, equipped with Zn-Se windows and double walls with a space for cooling agent (Thermo Spectra-Tech). The catalysts were reduced at 300°C in H2 flow (40ml/min) for 4h. Then the catalyst was flushed with He for 30min and the temperature was decreased to room temperature. The CO adsorption was done over the catalysts by flowing pure CO (20ml/min) over the catalysts for 1h. Before the CO adsorption, background spectrum was collected for each sample. The spectra of adsorbed CO reported here are subtracted spectra, i.e., the spectra of adsorbed CO minus the background spectrum of the sample before CO adsorption. Similarly, the nature of acidic sites in Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts was tested with DRIFT study of pyridine adsorbed catalysts. The experimental procedures are similar to that of DRIFT of CO adsorption. Pyridine in the vapor form was used instead of CO as probe molecule. The background spectrum was collected for each sample before the pyridine adsorption."
5,Catalytic studies,"2.4 Catalytic studies Partial oxidation of methanol (POM) over Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts was carried out in a fixed-bed continuous down flow steel reactor (40cm in length, 5mm in diameter) at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 400mg of catalyst diluted with silicon carbide (16 mesh) was used in each run. The catalysts were first reduced in situ by H2 (flow rate 40ml/min) at 300°C for 4h before the reaction. Methanol was supplied with air and is preheated and POM was carried out at different temperatures. The O2/CH3OH molar ratio was maintained at 0.3 for all the catalytic runs. The gaseous products were analysed with HP 5890 II chromatograph equipped with TCD. The CH3OH conversion and H2, CO2 and CO selectivities were calculated from the relation given below [18]: CH3OHconversion(mol%)=(molesofCH3OHconsumed/molesofCH3OHfed)×100 H2 selectivity(%)=(molesofH2 produced/molesofCH3OHconsumed×2)×100 CO2 selectivity(%)=(molesofCO2 produced/molesofCH3OHconsumed)×100 COselectivity(%)=(molesofCOproduced/molesofCH3OHconsumed)×100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterisation of AAO and CNTs,"3.1 Characterisation of AAO and CNTs 3.1.1 SEM of AAO and CNTs Fig. 1a represents the SEM image of AAO template. It is observed that well ordered pores with average pore diameter of 60–70nm are formed in Al metal surface. Further, the pore structures are clearly seen with uniform size and inter-pore spacing. The density of the pores is found to be in the range of 1012–1013 cm−2. The CNTs were grown over the AAO template using acetylene as carbon source at 650°C and their morphology was studied by SEM. Fig. 1b shows the SEM picture of purified CNTs indicating that the CNTs are copied from AAO pores. The diameter of the CNTs is same as that of pores of AAO and are about 60–70nm and the length of CNTs is in the order of several micrometers. Further, the CNTs are straight and there is no evidence for the presence of any carbonaceous byproducts. 3.1.2 Structural features of CNTs by TEM The structural features of CNTs were analysed by TEM and the representative images are shown in Fig. 2 . All the tubes have well-defined structure and no amorphous carbon is seen in and around the periphery of the tubes. It is observed that the diameter and length of the CNTs are similar to the pores of AAO template and are in the range of 60–70nm and several micrometers, respectively. Also, the CNTs are found to be straight and hollow and their wall thickness is around 10nm indicating that the CNTs formed are multiwalled CNTs (MWNTs). Further, the open end structure is clearly noted, which is highly useful to use as catalyst support. The BET surface area of the purified CNTs is 310m2/g further supporting their characteristics to use as catalyst support. 3.1.3 XRD, Raman and thermo gravimetric analysis of CNTs The nature of the carbon in the as-grown CNTs was analysed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The structure and crystallinity of CNTs were revealed by the typical XRD pattern presented in Fig. 3a. Two major peaks are observed, one is near 2θ =26° corresponding to 002 reflection of graphite. The other small asymmetric peak near 43.5° is due to 100 reflection of graphite, indicating the well graphitized nature of the CNTs. The vibrational characteristics of CNTs were analysed by Raman spectroscopy and the typical spectrum is shown in Fig. 3b. Two prime intense Raman bands, one at 1347cm−1 and the other at 1588cm−1 were observed. These bands correspond to fundamental vibrational modes of D4 6h of graphite. The band around 1592cm−1 [35] can be interpreted as E2g mode referred as G-band due to the stretching mode of graphite and the other at 1347cm−1 as D-band mostly interpreted for the extent of disorder in graphite layer [36]. Stronger the G-band, more will be the degree of graphitization. The intensity ratio (I D/I G =0.91) indicates the better graphitization of CNTs with less disordered carbon [37]. The thermal stability of the grown CNTs was studied by TGA in air and the typical TGA curve is shown in Fig. 3c. It is interesting to note that the CNTs were stable up to 550°C and then the decomposition starts and reaches maximum at 628.5°C. At 638°C, almost complete weight loss is noticed. The single sharp exothermic peak indicates that the sample consists of only a single phase. Further, the elemental analysis of CNTs confirms the absence of any other impurities such as alumina and fluoride."
8,Characterisation of Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts,"3.2 Characterisation of Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts 3.2.1 H2-TPR The reducibility of Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts was studied by TPR and the profiles for all Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 . All the Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts show composite patterns, corresponding to the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(0), in the temperature ranges much less than that of Cu-Zn on Al2O3 (230–255°C) and MCM-41 (230–260°C) supports [38,39], indicating that use of CNTs as support enhanced the reducibility of Cu species at low temperature, which may be due to smaller size CuO particles. This type of composite TPR patterns was noted in the case of Cu/Zn/Al catalysts with high as well as low alumina content [40,41]. Catalyst 5Cu-3Zn/CNTs displays the lowest reduction temperature, the main peak appearing at approximately 190°C. It indicates small CuO particles and hence, a higher dispersion of the catalyst [24]. When comparing the Cu loading, the reduction temperature of Cu is found to increase with increasing Cu loading. The reduction temperature is increased from 190 to 260°C when the Cu loading increased from 5 to 15wt%. Generally higher temperature is needed for the reduction of larger Cu crystallites. Hence, increase in reduction temperature with Cu loading indicates that the size of CuO crystallites increases with Cu loading. Similar observations were made in previous studies on Cu supported Al2O3 catalysts [38,24]. Catalyst 15Cu-12Zn/CNTs requires higher temperature for reduction, indicating larger CuO crystallites and low dispersion among the catalysts studied. This is in agreement with a previous study on Cu reducibility by Robertson et al. [42] which showed that highly dispersed CuO/SiO2 was reduced at much lower temperature than unsupported CuO catalysts. The lower reduction temperature observed in the present study is attributed to the greater dispersion of CuO on functionalized CNTs. This may be through the various functional groups created during the oxidative treatment. It can be assumed that Cu interacting with CNTs is more resistant to sintering than the free Cu particles. Also, the broad TPR profiles can also be related to the two-step reduction: Cu(II)→Cu(I)→Cu(0), as suggested by Lindstrom et al. [43]. But it can be noted that the two reduction steps of Cu(II) are not distinguishable by the TPR technique when Cu(II) species are highly concentrated [44]. This is due to a broadening of the peaks in the presence of larger amount of Cu(II), or the large heat release, which enhance the second reduction step. Based on the H2-TPR studies, all the catalysts were uniformly reduced at 300°C for 4h with 40ml/min H2 flow for further studies. 3.2.2 BET surface area and CO chemisorption The BET surface area and the total CO uptake of the various Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts are presented in Table 1 . The N2 adsorption studies showed typical Type II isotherm for all the Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts. The BET surface area values are found to be less compared to that of pure CNTs (310m2/g). Also, with increase in Cu-Zn loading, the surface area is found to decrease gradually. This may be due to the blocking of pores of CNTs by the Cu-Zn species added. The total CO uptake, which reveals the copper dispersion, is found to increase with increasing Cu loading up to 12wt%. Further metal loading resulted in a decreasing trend in CO uptake. The total CO uptake of 5Cu-3Zn/CNTs catalyst is 9μmol/g, which is increased to 15, 39 and 43μmol/g when the Cu loading increased as 7, 10 and 12wt%, respectively. But a rapid fall in CO uptake value is noted for 15Cu-12Zn/CNTs catalyst, revealing the poor Cu dispersion due to agglomeration of particles as seen in TEM image. Generally, it is assumed that the total CO uptake on Cu at 300K is approximately equal to the surface concentration of Cu in all three oxidation states. The increasing trend in CO uptake with increasing Cu loading indicates that the Cu dispersion increases up to 12wt%. Dandekar et al. [45] studied CO chemisorption over Cu dispersed on activated carbon and found that total CO uptake increased with Cu content and depending on the reduction temperature and pretreatment conditions. 3.2.3 Phase analysis of Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts by XRD The XRD patterns of reduced Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . The crystalline phases were identified in comparison with ICDD files. Generally, all the catalysts show that most of the added copper species exists in metallic form. The metallic copper phase was indicated by sharp peaks at 43.1°, 50.3° and 73.7° (JCPDS 85-1326). Further, presence of small portion of unreduced copper species (Cu+ and Cu2+) was indicated by low intensity peaks at 36.5° and 42.4° (JCPD 75-1531) and 35.5°, 38.9° and 48.6° (JCPDS 80-1917), respectively. The peaks for Cu+ and Cu2+ are clearly seen when the Cu loading is 15wt%. Further, the intensities of peaks corresponding to Cu are increasing with Cu loading. It indicates indirectly that the metallic copper area increases with increasing copper content. The average crystallite size corresponding to Cu (111) peaks of Cu-Zn/CNTs are calculated using Debye–Scherrer formula (d =0.9λ/β cosθ) and are listed in Table 1. It is found that the average crystallite size increases with increasing Cu loading. The Cu particle size is increased from 7 to 18nm, when the Cu loading increased from 5 to 15wt% indicating that the Cu particles may grow in size during the reduction due to more number of Cu particles available. Peaks for ZnO are not observed on any of the catalysts indicating that ZnO is in amorphous state. Even though all catalysts were prepared by same method, the metal particle size differs for each catalyst indicating the surface reconstruction during the reduction step. It can be associated with either the sintering of copper [46] or the migration of ZnO [47] on to the Cu surface under a reducing condition, leading to larger crystallites. It can be concluded that when increasing the copper content, part of the added copper exist in unreduced form indicating complete reduction of copper is not achieved under the experimental conditions used. Similar report indicating existence of more than one state of copper after reduction is available in open literature [29]. Further, all the XRD patterns indicate that large fraction of added Cu is in Cu (111) index planes. 3.2.4 TEM Representative TEM images for various Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts reduced at 300°C are shown in Fig. 6a–e. The small spherical particles dispersed on CNTs matrix are assumed as Cu particles. The size of the particles is measured and the average particle size value of each catalyst is given in Table 1. All the catalysts show fairly narrow particle size distributions. Further, the metal particles were also seen inside the CNTs. When increasing the metal loading, the size of the particles is found to increase significantly. The average particle size for 5Cu-3Zn/CNTs catalyst is 5.6nm and that of 10Cu-7Zn/CNTs is 9.8nm. Also, the uniformity in metal particle dispersion is found to increase significantly. It is further supported by increasing total CO uptake capacity of catalysts with increasing Cu loading. But in the case of 15Cu-12Zn/CNTs catalyst, larger sized aggregates are noted with poor dispersion and the average particle size is around 18.5nm. The smallest Cu particles were observed on the 5Cu-3Zn/CNTs, whereas the largest were seen on 15Cu-12Zn/CNTs, thus suggesting a favorable influence of the surface functional groups on the dispersion and sintering resistance of the Cu particles. Similar trend in particle size is noted from XRD measurements further support that particle size is mainly depending on the Cu content. 3.2.5 DRIFT study of carbon monoxide adsorbed on Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts The DRIFT study of CO adsorption characteristics on Cu-Zn/CNTs is one of the most useful techniques for characterising the nature of copper species over catalytic surfaces. Reports are available for CO adsorption over Cu on various supports, such as zeolite, MCM-41 and Al2O3 [48–50,41]. Adsorption of CO over all the Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts in the reduced form leads to the appearance of three major bands in the region of 2200–2100cm−1 (see Fig. 7 ). A major band around 2116cm−1 is due to Cu0 CO indicating the presence of copper in the metallic state. A shoulder band near 2125cm−1 is due to CO adsorbed on Cu+ species. The position of the bands at 2125 and 2116cm−1 can be assigned to either Cu+ CO or Cu0 CO species. Hence the stability of the bands is the most reliable criterion for the discrimination of both kinds of species. The Cu+ CO band is generally less stable and disappears upon evacuation [51,52]. In the present case, the band at 2116cm−1 disappears shortly with time indicating it belongs to Cu0 CO species. This is in line with the high intensity of the bands arising from the strong π-component of the CuCO bond as reported by Hadjiivanov et al. [53]. The cupric form of the catalyst was indicated by a high intensity band at 2170cm−1. It is interesting to note a small intensity band at much lower frequency 2017cm−1. During the course of time when purging with He, this band is found to disappear shortly, which can be assigned to CO adsorbed on Cu0 species. The disappearance of bands at 2116 and 2017cm−1 with time further support the assignment of peaks at 2116 and 2017cm−1 to CO adsorbed on two different Cu0 adsorption sites. Further, it indicates the presence of two types of Cu0 sites in the catalysts, which may be due to the interaction with the CNTs support. The morphological as well as electronic properties of small and highly dispersed Cu crystallites can be altered by the interaction with CNTs since CNTs are graphitic in nature, similar to the observation made over Cu on carbon substrates [54,55]. Reports are available on perturbation in the electronic structure of Cu on graphitic carbon supports as the cluster size is decreased [56,57]. Normally, the band corresponding to CO stabilized on metallic Cu is around 2115cm−1, which is red-shifted to around 2017cm−1 for all the Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts. The lower frequency band associated with stabilization of CO on Cu0 may indicate an enhancement in the electron density of the hybrid d+s valence bands of these Cu0 particles, which can be explained by considering the nature of CO-bonding with transition metals in terms of a σ–π-bonding model. According to the model proposed by Davydov [58], the CO-bonding with Cu involves the delocalization of the CO 5σ-electron pair to unoccupied hybrid d+s orbitals of the adsorption sites resulting σ-bonding and electron transfer from the occupied d-orbitals of the corresponding symmetry to the 2π antibonding orbitals of CO, resulting a π-bonding. Hence, the stretching frequency in the adsorbed CO complexes is strongly dependent on the relative contributions of σ and π-bonding, which obviously depends on the state of the adsorption site. In the case of Cu2+ ions, the contribution of π-bonding is relatively small and CO adsorption involves mainly σ-bonding, which leads to an increase in the frequency. Hence a band at 2170cm−1 is observed (instead of 2158cm−1 normally observed for CO on Cu2+) for all Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts. But in the case of Cu0, without any valence electrons, a significant role is played by π-bonding which increases the electron density in the antibonding orbitals of CO and results in a strong shift to lower frequency. Since CNTs are graphitic in nature, the charge density of Cu is increased and enhances the contribution from π-bonding, resulting a band at much lower frequency [58]. Further, the enhancement in the electron density of the smaller Cu crystallites indicates the electronic interaction between the Cu and CNTs. The electronic interaction could be due to the electron delocalization from the center of the polyaromatic rings in the graphite planes toward the periphery where these Cu particles anchored with the various functional groups present on the CNTs surface as reported by Richard and co-workers [59–61]. All the bands (see Fig. 7) indicate that the added surface copper species exist in metallic (Cu0), cupric (Cu2+) and cuprous (Cu+) form, and it was observed in most cases that Cu existed in more than one oxidation state [45,50]. The distribution of surface Cu oxidation states was found to be dependent on both the reduction temperature and the support used to disperse the Cu particles. Since the reduction time and temperature were constant for all the Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts, comparison of relative intensities of the bands corresponding to Cu0, Cu+ and Cu2+ species reveals the amount of unreduced copper species existed in the catalysts. In this case, the intensities of bands for Cu+ and Cu2+ are found to be low when the copper loading is less indicating that the amount of unreduced copper is less. When increasing the copper loadings, the intensities of bands for unreduced species are found to increase gradually than that of Cu0, even though the Cu0 CO is unstable, indicating that copper in unreduced form is more. Similar trend is noted in the XRD analysis of the catalysts. This observation, coupled with the fact that total CO uptake and enhanced dispersion for catalysts with up to 12wt% Cu, perhaps implies that smaller Cu particles are easier to reduce. 3.2.6 DRIFT spectra of adsorbed pyridine on Cu-Zn/CNTs The nature of acid sites in reduced Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts was studied by recording the DRIFT spectra of adsorbed pyridine at 50°C, after purging with He to remove the physically adsorbed molecules. The DRIFT spectra of all Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts are presented in Fig. 8 . For comparison purposes, spectrum for pyridine adsorbed on pure CNTs is also presented. The spectrum recorded for pure CNTs support after the adsorption of pyridine at 50°C does not show the presence of large amount of acid sites. But, in the case of Cu-Zn/CNTs, peaks corresponding to Lewis acid sites are clearly observed. The bands around 1440 and 1580–1600cm−1 can be related to pyridine chemisorbed on Lewis acid sites. The medium intensity band near 1480cm−1 is attributed to the pyridine molecule adsorbed on both Lewis and Brønsted sites and the very weak band at about 1545cm−1 can be assigned to pyridine adsorbed on the Brønsted acid sites [62]. The intensities of band corresponding to Lewis acid sites are found to be more compared to that of Brønsted sites over all the Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts. When comparing with pure CNTs, it could be concluded that the copper species deposited on the CNTs surface created strong Lewis acid sites. Further, the Lewis acid sites band in the range 1580–1600cm−1 consists of two maximum, indicating the presence of two types of Lewis acid sites, which may be resulted from two different copper species or zinc species added."
9,Catalytic studies,"3.3 Catalytic studies The catalytic activity and product distribution in POM reaction at atmospheric pressure over all Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts were studied at 220–280°C in order to obtain CO-free hydrogen. All the catalytic runs in this study were carried out at O2/CH3OH=0.3molar ratio. It was chosen as an optimum value which favors the partial oxidation products as observed by other researchers [16,18,26,29]. At higher O2/CH3OH ratio, the catalyst undergoes rapid surface deactivation by the formation of CuO. The CuO is inactive for hydrogen production. Presence of excess methanol will favor the partial oxidation products [12] by the formation of H2O from methanol decomposition, which will further react with methanol via steam reforming to form H2 and CO2. But if methanol is in large excess (O2/CH3OH ratio<0.3) then the methanol decomposition produce significantly more CO. The product analysis shows that H2 and CO2 are the major products and CO was observed in minor quantities. But no other compounds, such as formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, methyl formate or formic acid could be detected in the liquid product, apart from unreacted methanol. The effects of temperature on rate of methanol conversion over different catalysts are presented in Fig. 9 . The Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts with different compositions showed similar reaction profiles. The methanol conversion rate is found to increase with increasing temperature over all the catalytic systems. The increase is more when the reaction temperature raised from 240 to 260°C. There is no significant increase in methanol conversion rate with increase in the reaction temperature from 260 to 280°C. When comparing the Cu content, it is clear that the copper content has a significant influence on the performance of the catalyst for POM reaction. The methanol conversion rate at a fixed temperature increases with increasing copper content up to 12wt% and no further increase in activity is noted when increasing the Cu loading to 15wt%. The lack of catalytic activity of 15Cu-12Zn/CNTs catalyst compared to other catalysts can be attributed to the presence of a large amount of unreduced copper as observed from the XRD and DRIFT study CO adsorption as well as larger sized particles formed, shown by TEM measurements. Also, it can be explained that the threshold value of metallic Cu loading in monolayer state for active catalyst in the CNTs support is 12wt%. A relationship between the methanol conversion rate and the total CO uptake (Table 1) can also be clearly observed. Similar trend was already reported over Cu-Zn catalysts, where methanol conversion increased with Cu loading up to 40wt% and further increase in Cu loading showed a decrease in methanol conversion [12]. The effects of temperature on hydrogen selectivity and the corresponding CO and CO2 selectivity over all the catalysts are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 , respectively. The hydrogen selectivity profiles of the catalysts are differing from the corresponding methanol conversion profiles. Maximum hydrogen selectivity is observed at 260°C. At lower temperature ranges, the hydrogen selectivity is found to be low over all the catalysts. A significant increase in hydrogen selectivity with temperature may be at the expense of water. The oxidant was completely consumed at all the catalytic runs, the increasing selectivity trend with temperature suggests the participation of some other reactions during the POM. The contribution may be from steam reforming of methanol by the water produced during the deep oxidation of methanol. In the case of 12wt% Cu-9wt% Zn/CNTs, the hydrogen selectivity is 70.6% at 260°C. But, no significant increase in H2 selectivity is noted when increasing the reaction temperature from 260 to 280°C. Similar trend is observed for other catalytic systems. Significantly low H2 selectivity is observed over 15wt% Cu-12wt% Zn/CNTs catalyst at all the temperatures studied. It is remarkable that maximum methanol conversion rate and H2 selectivity could be achieved over the 12wt% Cu-9wt% Zn/CNTs catalyst at a relatively low temperature of 260°C. Generally, for Cu-supported catalysts it is proposed that metallic Cu is selective toward H2 and CO2 formation, while Cu+ favors H2O and CO formation and Cu2+ shows very low activity, which leads to CO2 and H2O [8,12,13]. Hence, the enhanced activity of 12wt% Cu-9wt% Zn/CNTs catalysts in methanol conversion as well as H2 production can be attributed to the presence of more metallic copper species than other catalysts as evidenced from XRD analysis. Also, the total CO uptake capacity as well as mean particle size of 12wt% Cu-9wt% Zn/CNTs further supports its higher activity. Looking at the carbon oxides distribution, CO2 is dominant along with certain proportion of CO which is observed at all the temperatures studied. The CO2 and CO selectivities shown in Fig. 11 indicate that formation of both CO2 and CO increase with temperature. The extent of increase is more at higher temperature ranges. All the catalysts showed similar trend in CO2 selectivity. The CO selectivity is found to increase with increasing Cu loading as well as reaction temperature. The enhanced CO selectivity may be due to the thermal decomposition of methanol at higher temperatures. Wang et al. [18] studied POM over Cu/Cr catalysts and found that when increasing the temperature from 200 to 250°C the CO selectivity increased from 7.5 to 13.5%, and accounted in terms of decomposition of methanol at higher reaction temperature. Also, catalyst with more unreduced Cu species shows higher CO selectivity indicating that Cu2+ species favors the formation of CO, similar to the report observed my many authors [23,27,43]. Also, the larger Cu particles formed over 15wt%Cu-12wt%Zn/CNTs is also partially responsible for the enhanced CO formation. Agrell et al. [10] proposed that larger Pd particles favored CO formation. On the other hand, the outlet CO concentration increases with increasing reaction temperature indicating that it is difficult to suppress CO evolution at high methanol conversion. This is due to the participation of reverse water-gas shift reaction at a reasonably higher temperature. One of the major problems using the conventional Cu-Zn catalyst in POM is the deactivation with time-on-stream. Hence, the stability of 12wt%Cu-9wt% Zn/CNTs in POM was investigated over 6h of on-stream operation at 260°C and the results are displayed in Fig. 12 . The methanol conversion is found to be stable up to 3h and a slight fall is noted thereafter. The selectivity towards carbon oxides is increased with time and after 6h on-stream, the CO amount increased significantly. It may be due to the formation of copper oxides in the presence of oxygen (air) at reasonably higher temperature, which may facilitate the formation of CO. The state of Cu species present in the spent 12wt%Cu-9wt%Zn/CNTs catalyst was analysed by XRD and same is presented in Fig. 13 along with that of fresh 12wt%Cu-9wt%Zn/CNTs catalyst for comparison. It is clear that the intensity of peaks corresponding to Cu0 species is decreased significantly in the spent catalyst. At the same time, the intensity of Cu+2 species (CuO) is increased. It indicates that during the POM reaction, the Cu0 species are slowly converted into CuO in air atmosphere, which is responsible for the fall in activity of the catalyst. The fall in H2 selectivity and enhanced CO formation observed in time-on-stream study (Fig. 12) further confirms the surface deactivation of catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"Carbon nanotubes were used as support to Cu-Zn catalysts for partial oxidation of methanol with an aim to produce hydrogen. The high quality CNTs were prepared by CVD method using anodic aluminum oxide template and acetylene as carbon source. The SEM and TEM studies confirm the morphological characteristics of grown CNTs. The XRD and Raman spectroscopy revealed their graphitic nature. The Cu-Zn/CNTs catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method. The TPR studies showed that increase in Cu loading increases the reduction temperature. The XRD and TEM studies indicated that the mean particle size increases with Cu loading and uniform dispersion with narrow particle size distribution is observed for 12wt%Cu-9wt%Zn/CNTs catalysts among the range studied. The CO chemisorption indicated that total CO uptake capacity increases with increasing Cu loading up to the threshold value. The DRIFT studies of CO adsorbed catalysts indicated the presence of copper in metallic, cuprous and cupric form. Strong Lewis sites are created due to Cu loading as revealed by DRIFT spectrum of pyridine adsorbed catalysts. The methanol conversion rate and hydrogen selectivity are found to increase with reaction temperature and Cu loading up to the threshold value (12wt%). Also, catalyst 12wt%Cu-9wt%Zn/CNTs showed good stability in time-on stream studies with suppressed formation of CO. All the results concludes that Cu0 species is an active species for high activity for hydrogen production with suppressed formation of CO and unreduced species Cu+ and Cu2+ inhibits the hydrogen production from methanol. The anchoring sites of CNTs inhibit sintering of metal particles, resulting small Cu-Zn particles with good dispersion, responsible for better activity in POM reaction. Further, during the POM reaction, the active Cu0 species is slowly converted into CuO resulted in fall in activity."
