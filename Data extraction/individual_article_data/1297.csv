0,Introduction,"On September 22, 2020, China announced at the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly that “China will strive to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060” [1]. Under the dual constraints of pollutant emission reduction and carbon emission reduction, which energy should be selected to solve the heating problem? The international consensus is biomass energy. Biomass energy is recognized as the fourth largest energy pool after coal, oil, and gas, and is becoming the primary option to replace fossil energy in the world, but also the protagonist of the heating market in the future due to its renewability, low pollution, widespread distribution, abundant in total, and particular carbon neutral [2,3]. There are about 1.7 × 1011 tons of biomass produced by photosynthesis on the earth each year, and the total energy is equivalent to 10–20 times the total global energy consumption [4,5]. Among the many kinds of biomass feedstocks, crop straw has become one of the important raw materials for bio-energy production as it is cheap and easy to get [6]. For example, in China, about one billion tons of crop straw was produced annually [7]. There are many ways to utilize crop straw for energy production, including open-air burning, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) [8], and pyrolysis [9], ect. According to the relevant provisions of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the People's Republic of China, open burning of straw is now prohibited. HTL and pyrolysis could convert the crop straw into an enery densified material-biocrude, and therefore are highly welcome in China. However, this kind of biocrude has many drawbacks such as high viscosity, high N, O and S contents, making it unsuitable for direct use for engine fuel [10]. To date, many researchers have proposed various methods for the upgrading of biocrude produced by hydrothermal liquefaction or pyrolysis of biomass, of which hydrotreating was one of the most effective and widely used methods [11]. During hydrotreating the biocrude, the N, O, and S could be removed via hydrodenitrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, and hydrodesulfurization, respectively [12]. Catalysts such Pt/C, activate carbon, Ru/C, Pt/γ-Al2O3, Rh/γ-Al2O3, Pt/C-sulfide, Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3, Mo2C, zeolite, and MoS2 were usually employed aiming to increase hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrodeoxygenation effiiciency [13,14]. Moreover, some other pretreatment method was also used to treat the biocrude for further utilization purposes, vacuum distillation, which was used to divide the biocrude into different fractions based on their boiling point, was one of the most effective ways [15,16]. In the authors previous work, the low-boiling point fraction(LBF) produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of soybean straw was hydrotreated in different hydrogen donor solvents (HDS) with added Pt/C and high pressure H2 [11]. The results indicated that the HDS not only supreessed the gas and solid production via inhibiting polycondensation reactions at severe temperatures but also favored the hydrogenation reactions via providing high active hydrogen as the CH bond energy is lower than that of H-H bond [17]. Among all the HDSs tested, decalin presented the best performance for denitrogenation and tetralin showed the best activity toward deoxygenation and desulfurization. This information inspired us to believe that the mixture of tetralin and decalin will be a promising medium for removing N, O, and S from the bio-oil produced from hydrothermal liquefaction or pyrolysis of biomass. Therefore, in this present study, the high-boiling point fraction (HBF, 141–220 °C) produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of soybean straw was hydrotreated the mixed tetralin and declin solvent with added Pt/C and high pressure H2 to intensify N, O, and S removal from the HBF. The advantage of using a biocrude fraction rather than the whole biocude was that coke production could be reduced due to the removal of asphaltene component. Effects of temperature (300–450 °C), time (1–6 h), H2 pressure (0.1–10 MPa), and Pt/C loading (0–40 wt%) on the product distribution and properties of the tread oil were examined. Finally, the treated oil was characterized by elemental analysis, mid-infrared gasoline and diesel analysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The HBF was prepared accoriding to Ref. [11], which was obtained by the hydrothermal liquefaction of soybean straw at 320 °C for 60 min. The Pt/C (Pt, 5 wt%) and activated carbon (AC) were obtained from Zhengzhou Alpha Chemical Co., Ltd. and used as received. The detailed characterization of the Pt/C was avaiable in Ref. [18]. Tetrahydronaphthalene (THN), decahydronaphthalene (DHN), and dichloromethane with purity of ≥ 99% were obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). The THN and DHN were mixed at a mass ratio of 1:1 to form a mixture which acted as the hydrotreating reaction medium. Hydrogen with a purity of 99.999% was bought from Changzhou Jinghua Industrial Gas Co., LTD (Changzhou, China). A custom-made stainless-steel batch reactor (Nanjing Zhengxin Instrument Co. Ltd, Jiangsu Province, China) with a total internal volume of 20 mL was used to perform the hydrotreatment experiments. No mixer was installed for this kind of reactor due to its limited internal space. The rated working temperature and pressure were 450 °C and 45 MPa, respectively. A molten salt bath (mKNO3:mNaNO3 = 5:4) was employed to provide the heat source for the reaction. Prior to their use in experiments, the reactors were loaded with water and seasoned at 400 °C for 4 hrs to remove any residual organic material from the reactors and to expose the fresh metal walls to high temperature water (HTW). After this conditioning process, potential catalytic reactor wall effects are likely reduced. Moreover, any small catalytic effect of the reactor walls should be the same in all runs and therefore not obscure the differences caused by added Pt/C and H2."
3,Hydrothermal liquefaction and vacuum distillation,"2.2 Hydrothermal liquefaction and vacuum distillation The biocrude was produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of soybean straw using a 1000 mL reactor. At each run, 150 g dry soybean straw and 400 mL deionized water were used. The reaction was performed at 320 °C for 1 h. More details were avaiable in Ref. [11]. The yield of the biocrude was 25 wt%. The HBF was generated by subjecting the biocude to a reduced pressure distillation using a vacuum distillation system as detailedly described in Ref. [11]. The vacuum pressure was set at 0.09 MPa. The distillation fractions between 141 and 220 °C was collected and defined as the HBF."
4,Hydrotreatment experiment,"2.3 Hydrotreatment experiment In a typical experiment, 3.0 g HBF, 3.0 g HDS, and 0.15 g Pt/C were loaded into the 20 mL reactor and sealed tightly. The Pt/C loading represented 5 wt% weight of the HBF. The air in the reactor headspace was replaced with H2 and charged to 6 MPa. The H2 loading amount was estimated as 0.068 g. The loaded reactor was put into the molten salt batch that was preheated to the desired temperature. About a few minutes later, the temperature inside the reactor reached the set temperature, and the reaction time was started to count. It should be noted that the relative proportion of liquid products from the hydrotreatmet of the HBF can depend on the heating rate, but no significant effects on the chemical composition of the treated oil are expected. The pressure inside the reactor varied between 9 and 20 MPa depending on the experimental conditions. Once the reaction time was finished, the reactor was taken out of the molten salt bath and placed into a cooling water bath. The cooled reactor was dried by a hair drier to remove water on the reactor’s outside wall. The gaseous production was roughly estimated by weight difference before and after exhausting the gaseous products subtracts the initial H2 weight charged into the reactor. The reactor was opened after venting the gaseous products. All the reaction products together with the spent catalyst were transferred into a 50 mL centrifuge tube for the separation of solid and liquid fractions and subjected to centrifugal separation at 10,000 r/min for 10 min. The solid fraction stayed on the filter gauze, which was dried at 105 °C for 12 h. The solid weight produced during the hydrotreatment process was free from the catalyst weight loading into the reactor. The liquid fraction existed at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. The oil products recovery efficiency was estimated by the difference between the real weight of the oil products and the value of Mfeedstcok-Mgas-Msolid, where M represents the weight of the material. The yield of each product fraction was estimated as its mass divided by the total mass of HBF and HDS charged into the reactor. In order to avoid errors caused by the experiment, at least three sets of experiments have been done under the same conditions, and the averaged values were used."
5,Products analysis,"2.4 Products analysis The total acid value (TAN) of the biocrude, HBF, HBF + HDS blend, and treated oil produced at different reaction conditions were determined according to Ref. [19]. The moisture content was tested by Karl Fischer titration method using KF-1B moisture analyzer (Shandong Benchuang Instrument Co., Ltd., Zibo, Shangdong province, China) [11]. The C, H, N, and O contents were determined by a Thermo Fisher Scientific FLASH 2000 organic elemental analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The higher heating values (HHVs) of the oils were determined by Dulong formula [11] (HHV(MJ/kg) = 0.338 × C + 1.428(H-O/8) + 0.095 S), where C, H, O, and S are the mass percent of each element. The S content of the oils was analyzed using TS-3000 ultraviolet fluorescence sulfur analyzer (Jiangsu Guochuang Analysis Instrument Co., Ltd., Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China) [11]. The molecular composition of the oils was analyzed using a LECO Pegasus 4D GC × GC-TOF-MS (Leco, San Jose, MI, USA). The analysis parameters are listed in Table S1. The samples were prepared by redissolution in chromatographical pure dichloromethane at a concentration of 10 (wt./vol)%. A NIST mass spectral library was used to identify the compounds and substances with a similarity of 700 or more are effective substances. The physical properties of the treated oil and commercial diesel were compared by a MINISCAN IR VISION mid-infrared fuel analyzer (Grabner, Austria). The spectral scanning range was 7000–450 cm−1, the wavenumber resolution was <2 cm−1, and the wavenumber accuracy was <0.5 cm−1. The mode selected for the test was diesel standard. Before analysis, the sample tank was thoroughly washed with a solvent mixture including toluene, methanol, and acetone (volume ratio, 1:1:1). The injection volume of diesel for automatic injection was 18 mL, and oil sample was the manual injection volume of 10 mL."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of temperature on products distribution,"3.1 Effects of temperature on products distribution Effect of temperature on the products distribution was first examined by varying the temperature from 300 to 450 °C while kept constant time of 2 h, H2 pressure of 6 MPa, Pt/C loading of 5 wt%, and HBF:HDS of 1:1. Fig. 1 (a) shows the results. The HBF + HDS blend was converted into three product fractions of treated oil, gas, and solid after it was subjected to the hydrotreatment process. Clearly, the treated oil yield significantly decreased from 94.1 wt% at 300 °C to 71.8 wt% at 450 °C while the gas and solid yield increased from 1.0 and 0.7 wt% at 300 °C to 2.6 and 10.2 wt% at 450 °C, respectively. Similar yields trend as a function of temperature was also observed as the low-boiling-point faction of the same biocrude was hydrotreated with added Pt/C and high-pressure H2 in the HDS [11]. The cracking and polymerization reactions were significantly accelerated with increasing the temperature and thus reduced treated oil yield and increased gas and solid yields, respectively [20]. Interestingly, at temperatures ≤400 °C, higher treated oil yields and mass balance and lower gas and solid yields were always observed for the HBF compared with that of LBF, indicating the HBF fractions were more stable and easy to be recovered than the LBF fractions. However, at more severe temperatures such as 450 °C, lower treated oil yield and mass balance was obtained for the HBF compared with the LBF, imply the treated oil produced from HBF contained large factions of light-end products, which were easy to lose during the recovery process. In view of the yield and quality of the treated oil, 400 °C was selected as the suitable temperature for subsequent parameter optimization."
8,Effects of time on products distribution,"3.2 Effects of time on products distribution Effect of time on the products distribution was studied by varying the time from 1 to 6 h while kept constant temperature of 400 °C, H2 pressure of 6 MPa, Pt/C loading of 5 wt%, and HBF:HDS of 1:1. Fig. 1(b) shows the results. Compared with reaction temperature, time had weak effect on products distribution. The treated oil yield decreased from 88.4 wt% at 1 h to 83.8 wt% at 6 h while the gas and solid yield increased from 0.4 and 2.6 wt% at 1 h to 2.1 and 5.6 wt% at 6 h, respectively. Extending the reaction time would also increased the possibility of the cracking and polymerization reactions, and thus favored the production of gas and solid. Similar to the effect of temperature, higher treated oil yields and lower gas and solid yields were always observed for the HBF compared with that of LBF [11]. In view of the yield and quality of the treated oil, 4 h was selected as the suitable reaction time for subsequent parameter optimization."
9,Effects of H2 pressure on products distribution,"3.3 Effects of H2 pressure on products distribution H2 pressure is a critical factor affecting the hydrogenation reactions and the removal efficiency of N, O, and S from the bio-oil when doing the hydrotreatment experiments. Effect of H2 pressure on the products distribution was examined by varying the H2 pressure from 0.01 to 10 MPa while kept constant temperature of 400 °C, time of 4 h, Pt/C loading of 5 wt%, and HBF:HDS of 1:1. One additional experiment was performed under 0.1 MPa Ar for comparison purposes while keeping other parameters with added H2. Fig. 1(c) shows the results. Increasing the H2 pressure from 0.1 to 10 MPa would increase the treated oil yield from 81.0 to 85.8 wt% and reduce the gas and solid yields from 4.3 and 6.9 wt% to 0.3 and 4.0 wt%, respectively. Higher H2 pressure was unfavorable for the gas production according to the Le Chatelier's principle, which would also provide more active hydrogen for hydrogenation reaction to stabilize the coke precursor, thus preventing the formation of solid products [11,20]. Slightly lower treated oil yield and higher gas and solid yields were observed as the hydrotreatment was performed under 0.1 MPa Ar instead of 0.1 MPa H2, indicating that molecular H2 was important to suppress the formation of gas and solid products. The HDS mixture also contributed to the suppression of gas and solid products [11]. In view of the yield and quality of the treated oil, 10 MPa was selected as the suitable H2 pressure for subsequent parameter optimization."
10,Effects of Pt/C loading on products distribution,"3.4 Effects of Pt/C loading on products distribution Suitable catalysts are indispensable to accelerate the hydrogenation reactions and N, O, and S removal efficiency during the hydrotreating reaction. Effect of H2 pressure on the products distribution was examined by varying the Pt/C loading from 0 to 40% while kept constant temperature of 400 °C, time of 4 h, H2 pressure of 5 wt%, and HBF:HDS of 1:1. Obviously, catalyst loadings employed in our study sometimes are far greater than the loading typically used for the hydrotreatment reactions. However, our previous study suggested that catalyst loading had the greatest effect on HHV and O/C ratio in the treated oil. So, rather than refusing to do experiments within the typical catalyst loadings, we opted to increase the catalyst loading beyond the typical ones so as to see the possible highest HHV and lowest O/C ratio of the treated oils. It should be noted that higher catalyst loading is undesirable in view of the economic implication. However, if the catalyst can be recycled, higher catalyst loading amount is not a problem. Fig. 1(d) shows the results. One additional experiment was performed with added 40 wt% AC(the support for Pt/C) for comparison purposes while keeping other parameters as that of with added Pt/C. Compared with without Pt/C, the addition of 5 wt% Pt/C would reduce the gas and solid yield and increase the treated oil yield by intensifying the hydrogenation reactions. However, the treated oil yield monotonically decreased from 85.8 to78.4 wt% and the gas and solid yields increased from 0.3 and 4.0 wt% to 1.2 and 8.4%. with increasing the Pt/C loading from 5 wt% to 40 wt%, which were consistent with a previous study observed by Duan et al when they did the catalytic upgrading of crude algal oil using platinum/gamma alumina in supercritical water [21]. The Pt/C had a high specific surface area of 419 m2/g, which would adsorb more coke precursors and stay in the catalyst pores and result in increased possibility of polymerization reactions. With the addition of AC alone, higher gas and solid yields and lower treated oil yield were observed compared with that with added Pt/C, implying Pt played a critial role in controlling the products distribution and properties of the treated oil."
11,"Characterization of the HBF, HBF + HDS blend, and treated oil produced at different reaction conditions","3.5 Characterization of the HBF, HBF + HDS blend, and treated oil produced at different reaction conditions 3.5.1 Moisture, TAN, and elemental analysis Table 1 presents the moisture, TAN, and elemental analysis of the HBF, HBF + HDS blend, and treated oil produced at different reaction conditions. The starting material was the HBF + HDS blend, therefore, all the properties of the treated oil were compared with those of HBF + HDS blend. All the treated oils had lower moisture, TAN, N, O, and S contents no matter what kind of reaction conditions were used. The treated oils also had good flowability compared with the HBF + HDS blend. The C content of the treated oil increased from 85.52 wt% at 300 °C to 88.48 wt% at 450 °C, while the H content decreased from 10.81 wt% to 9.70 wt%. Therefore, a reduced H/C molar ratio of the treated oil was observed with increasing the temperature as higher temperatures favored the aromatization reactions [11]. The N, O, and S contents monotonically decreased with increasing temperature as denitrogenation, deoxygenation, and desulfurization prevailed at higher temperatures. About 95.2% S, 77.8% O, and 56.4% N in the initial HBF + HDS blend were removed at the temperature of 450 °C, which were removed in the form of C2H4N, C3H7N, C6H7N, NH3, (SCN)2, SO2, and H2O. Compared with the S, a lower N and O reduction ratio might ascribe to the secondary reactions between denitrogenation and deoxygenation products with the treated oil. Temperature had a weak effect on the HHV of the treated oil, which was kept at around 44 MJ/kg at the temperature range examined as both the H/C molar ratio and O content decreased with increasing temperature. The moisture and TAN of the treated oil decreased from 0.33 wt% and 29.8 mg KOH/g at 300 °C to 0.11 wt% and 3.0 mg KOH/g at 450 °C. Increasing temperature would promote the deoxygenation of the acidic compounds in the HBF, and thus reduce the TAN of the treated oil. Reduction in N-, O-, and S-containing compounds would also decrease the polarity of the treated oil, thus decrease the solubility of water in the treated oil. Time had a litte effect on the properties of the treated oil. Slight increase in C content and decrease in H content with extending the reaction time from 1 to 6 h. Therefore, the H/C molar ratio decreased from 1.43 to 1.37 as the reaction time increased from 2 to 6 h. At the initial stage, hydrogenation reactions prevailed, and thus a slight increase in H was observed at the reaction time of 2 h. Further increase in time would acclerate the aromatization reactions, and thus the H/C molar ratio decreased. Similar to the effect of tempeature, the moisture and TAN also decreased with increasing reaction time due to the decreased polarity of the treated oil [11]. With the addition of 0.1 MPa H2, silght higher H content and lower N, O, and S contents were obtained compared with added 0.1 MPa Ar. At lower presure of H2 or Ar, the H source for the hydrogenation reactions mainly contributed from the HDS. Almost the same moisture and TAN were observed when the reaction was performed either in 0.1 MPa Ar or 0.1 MPa H2. The H2 pressure had little effect on the C content of the treated oil, and however, the H content of the treated oil increased from 9.36% under 0.1 MPa H2 to 10.49 wt% under 10 MPa H2. Thus, the H/C molar ratio also increased with increasing the H2 pressure, indicating the saturation of the treated oil increased. The S, O, and N contents were reduced 53.9, 21.1, and 13.3% as the H2 pressure increased from 0.1 to 10 MPa, respectively. Interestingly, H2 pressure varing from 6 to 10 MPa had little effect on the elemental composition of the treated oil, inidicating the hydrogen source was enough for the hydrotreating reactions under H2 pressure of 6 MPa [11]. The other possibe reeason was the existence of the secondary reactions between the denitorgenation, deoxygenation, and desulfurization products with the treated oil was the other in the reactor. The HHV of the treated oil increased from 42.6 MJ/kg under 0.1 MPa H2 to 44.3 MJ/kg under 10 MPa H2 due to increased H and decreased O and S contents. Both the moisture and TAN decreased with increasing the H2 pressure due to decreased polarity of the treated oil. Pt/C loading was the most influential factor affecting the properties of the treated oil. The treated oil produced without Pt/C had higher C content and lower H, N, O, and S contents than that of the HBF + HDS blend, indicating temperature and HDS played major roles in hydrogenation reactions. Increasing the Pt/C loading increased the C contents and decreased the N, O, and S contents of the treated oil. The H content of the treated oil increased from 10.03 to 10.59 wt% as the Pt/C loading increased from 0 to 20 wt%. Further increase in catalyst loading gradually decreased the H content of the treated oil, which was consistent with the previous study [11]. Pt/C not only can promote the hydrogenation reaction but also the dehydrogenation reaction. Hydrogenation reaction prevailed at catalyst loading ≤ 20 wt%, while dehydrogenation reaction prevailed catalyst loading ≥ 30 wt%. The same variation trend was also observed for the H/C molar ratio as a function of catalyst loading. At the largest Pt/C loading of 40 wt%, the treated oil presented the lowest N, O, and S contents of 0.42 wt%, 1.24 wt%, and 10 ppm, respectively, corresponding to the reduction of 68.4, 78.7, and 95.3% of the HBF + HDS blend. The S content of the treated oil produced at 40 wt% Pt/C loading matched the requirement of China V gasoline and diesel fuel quality standards GB 17930–2013 (the S content must be lower than 10 parts-per-million (ppm).)[22]. At Pt/C loading ≥ 30 wt%, the catalyst loading had little effect on the reduction of N, O, and S contents of the treated oil, possibly the denitrogenation, deoxygenation, and desulfurization reaction reached their upper bound what they possibly gave. The last line in Table 1 showed the results produced with pure AC support alone, indicating Pt was very important for hydrogenation reactions and the removal of N, O, and S from the HBF. 3.5.2 GC–MS analysis GC–MS was used to qualify the molecular compositions of the HBF and treated oils produced under different reaction conditions. We first report the products distribution of pure THN and DHN alone treated at 350 °C for 2 h with added 5 wt% Pt/C and 6 MPa H2. Fig. 2 shows the total ion chromatogram. THN would undergo dehydrogenation to produce naphthalene, while part of the THN was converted to decalin with two different configurations [23], indicating THN was a powerful hydrogen donor. DHN had two structures of cis and trans, and only part of the DHN were converted to naphthalene due to its saturated structure. Compared with non-hydrogen donor solvent, HDS not only had significant advantages in improving the conversion rate and products distribution, but also could inhibit polycondensation and improve the quality of bio-oil through hydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions. Fig. 3 showed the total ion chromatogram (TIC) of the treated oils produced under different conditions. More regular peaks in the treated oils produced at higher temperatures were observed due to the occurrence of cracking reactions at severe temperatures. Besides the derivatives of the THN and DHN, the major peaks in the TIC were hydrocarbons starting at C8 and ending at C19. Increasing temperature would increase the hydrocarbons content of C8-C10 which were derivated from the cracking of long-chain hydrocarbons. Similarly, more peaks were also observed at the longest reaction time of 6 h compared with that at 1 h. The treated oil produced under 0.1 MPa Ar showed a similar peaks distribution as that produced under 0.1 MPa H2, imply HDS played a very important role in proving hydrogen source for the hydrotreatment reactions. Increasing the H2 pressure would increase the saturated hydrocarbons contents of the treated oil. Catalyst loading also had a significant impact on the molecular composition of the treated oil. Increasing the catalyst loading would increase the short-chain hydrocarbons content by promoting cracking reactions. Compared with Pt/C, when AC was only used, the relative content of each compound, particular those hydrocarbons < C11 was lower, indicating Pt acted as a dominant role in catalyzing cracking reactions. The components of the treated oils were divieded into several categories such as saturated hydrocarbon, unsaturated hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon, N-containing compound, O-containing compound, S-containing compound, and N,O-containing compounds. Table S2 provides the relative content of each compound class of the treated oils produced at different reaction conditions. Generally, saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons were the two most abundant compound classes, and higher temperature, longer reaction time, and larger catalyst loading favored the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Higher H2 pressure was helpful for the production of saturated hydrocarbons due to the accleration of hydrogenation reactions. Besides the overwhelming hydrocarbons in the treated oil, a small amount of N-containing compounds such anilines, pyridines, pyrroles, nitriles, carbazoles, and indoles and O-containing compounds such as alcohols, phenols, ethers, aldehydes, acids, ketones, and esters also existed. These above N-containing and O-containing compounds either came from the feedstock or formed during the hydrotreating reactions, which should be paid more attention to the future deep removal of N and O from the bio-oil. 3.5.3 Mid-infrared analysis One treated oil, which was produced at 400 °C, 4 h, 10 wt% Pt/C, 10 MPa H2, and HBF:HDS(MDHN:MTHN = 1:1) = 1:1, was used as a representative to compare its physical properties with the commercially available diesel. Table S2 lists the comparison results. The treated oil had a larger density (0.913 g/cm3) and HHV (∼44 MJ/kg)than the 0# diesel (0.856 g/cm3, 42.6 MJ/kg), indicating the treated oil will need a smaller volume when the same amount of heat was released. The treated oil also had a comparable cetane number to the diesel. Diesel with high cetane value possesses many advantages such as easy to start, uniform combustion and large output power. Usually, the lower the cetane number, the slower the ignition, the unstable the work, and the easy to knock. The treated oil was lower than the diesel in terms of viscosity, indicating that its fluidity was better and nebulization was easier to achieve. From the perspective of distillation range, due to the complex composition of the treated oil, its initial distillation point was <120 °C. In comparison, the initial distillation point of diesel is about 168 °C. The overall distillation temperature of the treated oil was slightly lower than that of diesel, indicating that there were still some low-boiling-point substances treated oil. The fatty acid methyl ester content in treated oil was higher than that of diesel, which was an important index to distinguish biodiesel from petrochemical diesel. The total aromatic content of the treated oil was much higher than that of the diesel because the hydrotreatment experiments were performed in THN and DHN mixture. The aromatics contents in the treated oil can be adjusted by changing the HBF:HDS mass ratio when doing the hydrotreatment experiments. Cetane number improvers are generally alkyl nitrate compounds which are decompose at higher temperatures and lower the initial boiling point of diesel fuel. “Improver” such as 2-ethyl-hexyl nitrate (2-EHN) is a diesel fuel additive that improves cetane number of diesel, and can offer the best performance in the most competitive way. The cetane number improver of the treated oil was 3.9 times larger than that of the diesel, indicating the treated oil will have excellent combustion characteristics relative to the market diesel."
12,Conclusions,"The high-boiling-point fraction of the soybean straw biocrude via hydrothermal liquefaction was effectively hydrotreated in tetralin and decalin mixture with added Pt/C and high-pressure H2. The presence of H2 and Pt, particular the HDS played a critical role in the suppression of solid and gas production and the N, O, and S removal from the initial feedstock. The S was the easiest heteroatom to be removed, followed by N and O under all reaction conditions examined. Under the optimal reaction conditions of 400 °C, 4 h, 10 MPa H2, 40 wt% Pt/C, and HBF:HDS(MDHN:MTHN = 1:1) = 1:1, 98.6% S, 96.2% N, and 87.1% O were removed from the initial feedstock, respectively. The treated oil mainly consisted of hydrocarbon starting at C8 and ending at C20 besides the aromatics derivated from the conversion of tetralin and decalin. The treated oil had better flowability, competitive cetane number, and good combustion behavior than those of the 0# diesel. The N, S, and O were removed in the form of C2H4N, C3H7N, C6H7N, NH3, (SCN)2, SO2, and H2O in the gas phase, respectively. Some N-containing compounds such as anilines, pyridines, pyrroles, nitriles, carbazoles, and indoles and O-containing compounds such as alcohols, phenols, and ethers aldehydes, acids, ketones, and esters still existed in the treated oil. Future study needs to pay more attention to the in situ removal of gaseous products, avoiding their secondary reaction with the treated oil if one expects to eliminate the N, O, and S in the final treated products."
