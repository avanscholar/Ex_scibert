0,Introduction,"Nowadays the development of sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from renewable sources is highly demanded. Furfural (FU) formed by acid hydrolysis of C5 pentose sugars (xylose, arabinose) is one of the most appropriate platform molecules for the production of a variety of value-added chemicals and fuels [1,2]. Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural generates a variety of products. All of them are important intermediates in the chemical industry and bio-fuels technology, summarized in the recent review by Yan et al. [3]. It has been observed that a type of metal, support properties (acid-base, redox) as well as reaction conditions influenced the conversion rate of FU and products distribution. For example, Cu-based catalysts are highly selective for furfuryl alcohol (FA), while Pd, Pt and Ni promote the furan ring hydrogenation producing tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) (Scheme 1) [4–6]. Pd readily dissociates hydrogen under ambient conditions enabling hydrogenation of FU and FA even at room temperature and under low hydrogen pressure (1–3 bar) [7–12]. Thus, comparable proportions of FA and THFA were formed over Pd/Al2O3 under such mild conditions [8]. High temperature (above 180 °C) favours furan formation but also leads to an increased 2-methylfuran yield whereas high hydrogen pressure promotes furan ring hydrogenation to form THFA and tetrahydrofuran (THF) [8]. Several studies have shown that amongst the Pd catalysts with various supports the carbon-supported Pd was the most active [7,13–15]. However, the type of carbon material (active carbon AC, carbon black, carbon nanotubes CNT, MWCNT) influenced the activity and products distribution [14,16–18]. Various activity/selectivity pattern over Pd/carbon black and Pd/CNT catalysts was ascribed to differently modified Pd-sites depending on the carbon support [16]. The Pd/AC catalyst with the oxygenated carbon was less active but more selective to THFA than the non-treated carbon-supported counterpart although there were the Pd particles of similar size in both catalysts [17]. Liu et al. [18] also observed that bimetallic PdPt catalysts supported on HNO3-oxidized AC and MWNT displayed lower activity and higher selectivity to THFA compared to non-modified carbon-supported samples. Previous works have shown a significant influence of the oxygenated carbon groups on the catalytic performance of carbon-supported Pd, Pt, Ru catalysts for the hydrogenation of various reagents, amongst them α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. However, different effects of oxidized carbon moieties were reported, depending on the reaction conditions, liquid or gas phase hydrogenation systems [19]. In the gas phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation over Pt/AC and Pt/C catalysts, Coloma et al. [20,21] observed higher selectivity to crotyl alcohol at larger amount of oxidized groups. In the same reaction over Pt/graphite the selectivity to crotyl alcohol did not depend on the amount of oxidized surface groups [22]. Suh et al. [23] reported that oxidized surface moieties in various carbonaceous materials reduced the Pd activity for liquid phase hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene. In liquid phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde a trend of growing activity as well as CC selectivity with decreasing content of oxygen-containing carbon surface groups was reported over Pt/CNF [24,25], Ru/CNF [26] and Pd/CNF/TiO2/monolith [27] catalysts. The model in which the reaction is assisted by the enhanced cinnamaldehyde adsorption on the hydrophobous CNF surface has been suggested [24,25]. Ding et al. [28] compared the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde in water-ethanol medium over carbon replicas CMK-3- and CMK-5–supported Pt. Although the catalysts had similar textural features, the Pt/CMK-3 exhibited higher activity ascribed to its more hydrophobic surface facilitating benzaldehyde adsorption. In our previous research [29] we studied the mesoporous carbon replicas synthesized using SBA-15 or nanostructured silica gel as template and furfuryl alcohol or sucrose as carbon source. Our studies concentrated on the role of the type of template and carbon source in textural and surface properties of the carbon replicas in view of the application for the Pd-particles deposition. The catalytic properties of the Pd-containing nanostructured carbons were studied for the FU hydrogenation. Regardless of the type of silica template, the obtained carbon replicas were low crystalline and the sucrose-derived samples displayed higher surface area and pores volume than furfuryl alcohol-derived counterparts. The nanostructured carbon synthesized using silica and sucrose with uniform mesopores (ca. 8 nm of width) and extremely high surface area (1453 m2/g) and porosity (2.85 cm3/g) was found to be the most useful for the Pd particles intercalation. The obtained catalyst displayed high and stable activity for the FU hydrogenation. It should be noted that other supports, like aluminosilicates, silica KIT-6 with ordered mesoporous structure, well defined pore size and large surface area were also reported to be attractive from the catalytic point of view as they allowed synthesis the Ag catalysts of well-defined structural properties [30,31]. The previously studied catalysts were characterized by low surface content of oxidized carbon groups [29]. Nevertheless, the observed selectivity relations suggested that polarity of the nearest palladium environment influenced reaction. More polar Pd-environment due to the higher amount of oxidized species decreased FU hydrogenation rate. To gain more insight into the role of oxygenated carbon groups in the FU hydrogenation reaction, the Pd catalysts supported on nanostructured carbons with a controlled content of surface oxidized groups are studied in the present work. Thus, two previously synthesized carbon replicas, with SBA-15 and silica gel templates [32,33] were modified by wet oxidation with HNO3 or H2O2 [32]. Similarly to our previous work [29], the palladium catalysts were prepared by a colloid-based reverse ""water-in-oil"" microemulsion (ME) procedure [35,36] (Scheme 2). According to this method, at first metal particles are generated in the microemulsion medium and then they are immobilized onto the support. This Pd incorporation approach allows preparing the catalysts with nearly monodispersed metal particles of similar size, shape and surface properties [37–39]. Such a method eliminates the influence of the Pd-size on catalytic reactivity [9]. The hydrogenation of FU was carried out under mild conditions in order to reduce possibility of side-reactions occurrence such as furfuryl alcohol oligomerization, self-etherification, etc."
1,Experimental,
2,Carbon supports,"2.1 Carbon supports SBA-15 silica synthesized according to previous procedure [32] and commercial mesoporous silica gel (spherical particles, 40–75 μm in size, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the hard templates. The carbon replica C(SBA) was prepared by the deposition of furfuryl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich) in the pore system of SBA-15 silica by the precipitation polycondensation method [32]. The SBA-15 template (3 g) was added to a solution containing 6 g of furfuryl alcohol dissolved in 91 g of water. Then, HCl solution was introduced at HCl/furfuryl alcohol molar ratio of 6. The resulting slurry was heated up to 100 °C and left for 6 h under vigorous stirring. After cooling and separation by filtration, the isolated brown solid was washed thoroughly with water and dried overnight at room temperature. C(Si) carbon replica was synthesized using silica gel and sucrose (Avantor) as the carbon source [33]. An aqueous solution containing 1.25 g of sucrose, 5 g of water and 0.14 g of sulphuric acid was introduced by dry impregnation into the silica matrix (10 g). The obtained composite was dried in a furnace (at 100 °C for 6 h, and then at 160 °C for 6 h). The loading and drying procedures were subsequently repeated. The obtained composites were carbonized in a tubular furnace (heating rate of 1 °C/min, isothermal step at 850 °C for 4 h) in a flow of nitrogen (40 cm3/min). The removal of the silica templates was performed by the treatment with 5% HF (Avantor) at room temperature using 30 cm3 of the acid solution per 1 g of the composite, followed by washing with water and ethanol (96%). The carbon replicas were oxidized with aqueous solutions of H2O2 (20%) and HNO3 (30%) following our previous procedure [34]. 1 g of carbon sample was placed in 10 cm3 of solution under vigorous stirring at 50 °C for 3 h. After filtering, the materials were washed with distilled water until neutral pH of filtrate. The carbon sample C(Si) oxidized with H2O2 is denoted as C(Si)O, and the one oxidized with HNO3 as C(Si)N. The C(SBA) carbon sample oxidized with HNO3 is denoted as C(SBA)-N (Scheme 2)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The oxidized carbons-supported catalysts (ca. 2 wt% Pd) were prepared by the microemulsion method at the same conditions as the ones used in the synthesis of initial carbons-supported Pd/C(Si) and Pd/C(SBA) catalysts [29]. Details of the preparation have been previously described [35,36]. The reverse micellar solution consisted of cyclohexane (Avantor) as the oil phase and polyoxyethylene(7–8) octylphenyl ether (Triton X-114, Aldrich) as the surfactant (concentration of 0.62 mol/dm3). In order to prepare 1 g of 2 wt% Pd/C catalyst, 0.94 cm3 of PdCl2 solution (0.2 mol/dm3, NaCl/PdCl2 molar ratio of 2/1) was added to cyclohexane solution (16.8 cm3). The molar ratio of water to surfactant was equal to 5.5. The mixture was vigorously stirred to form a transparent liquid. Metallic nanoparticles were formed by the addition of NaBH4 powder (molar ratio of NaBH4/Pd2+ = 10). The reduction occurred quickly with a change of colour of suspension to black. The suspension was left for 1 h under stirring. Then, the carbon support (0.98 g) was introduced and the system was mixed for another 1 h. The deposition of the metal nanoparticles on the support was carried out by an the introduction of THF (with volume 3–4 times larger than that of suspension) at a very slow rate using an automatic syringe pump. Upon vigorous stirring the colour of liquid changed from black to grey and finally the liquid was colourless. The catalyst was separated by filtration, dried in air for ca. 24 h and washed with a copious amount of methanol, acetone and water till the chloride ions were removed, then dried at 80 °C for 16 h."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Textural parameters were calculated from the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measured at −196 °C by ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics) apparatus. Prior to the measurement, a sample was degassed in vacuum at 350 °C for 5 h. The specific surface areas were determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore size distributions were calculated using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. The values of total pore volumes were obtained from the amount of adsorbed nitrogen at the relative pressure of 0.99. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed by means of a Bruker D2 Phase apparatus with a LYNXEYE detector using Cu Kα radiation in a 2θ range of 0.5–70°. An average diameter of metal crystallites was calculated on the basis of the Pd(111) peak broadening according to the Scherrer equation taking into account instrumental line broadening. Pd loading in catalysts (wt%) was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using an ARL QUANT'X EDXRF (Thermo Scientific) spectrometer with a Rh tube as a radiation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Prevac photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical analyser (VG SCIENTA R3000) using Al Kα (E = 1486.6 eV) as an X-ray radiation source at a constant pass energy of 100 eV for survey and high resolution modes. Powdered samples were introduced by a load lock into an analytical chamber with a base pressure of 5 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energy scale was calibrated using the Au 4f7/2 line of a cleaned gold sample at 84.0 eV. The surface composition was analysed taking into account the areas and binding energies of C 1 s and O 1 s core levels. The spectra were fitted using CasaXPS software. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected by means of a JEOL JSM-7500 F field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive (EDS) system. A secondary electron detector provided SEI images, whereas a back scattered electron detector gave COMPO micrographs. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies were performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV equipped with EDAX EDX and HAADF/STEM detectors. Samples for analysis were prepared by placing a powder sample onto a carbon-coated copper grid. FT-IR spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000–650 cm−1 using a Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Scientific) spectrometer equipped with a MCT-A detector. For each sample 200 scans were taken at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Prior to the measurement, a dry powder sample was diluted with KBr to 0.25 wt% and then a 13 mm pellet was formed by pressing (5 tonnes)."
5,Furfural hydrogenation reaction,"2.4 Furfural hydrogenation reaction Catalytic experiments were performed according to the previously described method [40]. The reaction was studied in a batch-type glass reactor at 35 °C and hydrogen pressure of 6 bar using a solution of FU (Sigma-Aldrich) in 2-propanol (Avantor, concentration 0.05 mol/dm3). The catalyst (0.05 g) and FU solution (70 cm3) were introduced into the reactor and purged with nitrogen and then with hydrogen. After heating the solution up to 35 °C, the hydrogen pressure was increased to 6 bar and the mechanical stirring (1800 rpm) was turned on. Samples were withdrawn from the reactor during catalytic test and analysed by gas chromatography GC (Perkin Elmer Clarus 500, FID detector, capillary column Elite-5 MS) [40]. The concentration of reagents FU, FA, THFA, THF was analysed using the GC standards (Sigma-Aldrich). The GC peaks of furan and 2-methylfuran overlapped with a broad peak of 2-propanol making their analysis difficult. The furfuryl isopropyl ether (ET) and furfural diisopropyl acetal (AC) were identified by GC–MS and analysed by GC using calibration factor obtained for furfural diethyl acetal standard (Sigma-Aldrich). The carbon mass balance (CB) was calculated as the sum of the GC analysed reagents: FU + FA + THFA + ET + AC."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Textural and structural properties of catalysts,"3.1 Textural and structural properties of catalysts Textural properties including specific surface area, pore volume and average pore width, determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements are collected in Table 1 . The isotherms registered for all three SiO2-series catalysts are of type IV (according to IUPAC classification) and exhibit hysteresis loops characteristic of mesoporous structure (see Fig. S1a in the supplementary electronic datafile). There is no essential difference in the pore size distribution between the initial and the oxidized carbons-supported catalysts (Fig. 1 a). In all three catalysts there are mesopores of width within relatively narrow range (2–15 nm) with an average width of 7.7–8.4 nm. The initial carbon-supported Pd/C(Si) catalyst has a very high surface area (1167 m2/g) which decayed slightly for the oxidized carbons-supported Pd/C(Si)O (1093 m2/g) and Pd/C(Si)N (1006 m2/g) catalysts (Table 1). All three catalysts are also characterized by very high pore volumes, the largest (2.42 g/cm3) is in the Pd/C(Si) catalyst and only slightly smaller are in the oxidized carbons-supported catalysts. The contributions of micropores are comparable and very low, ca. 4% in all catalysts. Thus the oxidation of initial C(Si) carbon did not essentially change its porous systems and the nanostructured mesoporous structures are preserved in all three catalysts. The XRD patterns of Pd/C(Si), Pd/C(Si)O and Pd/C(Si)N samples are similar and show weak, broad peaks around 2θ 20° and 44° corresponding to the (002) and (101) reflections ascribed to the graphitic domains (Fig. 1c). The low intensity of these reflections indicates mostly an amorphous structure. This result is consistent with previous observations that non-graphitizable carbon sources, such as sucrose and furfuryl alcohol produced carbon replicas of low crystallinity. Besides, a small reflection at 2θ ∼40° appears corresponding to (111) plane of face centred cubic (fcc) crystalline phase of Pd. The Pd crystallite size was calculated from the (111) line broadening by Scherrer equation to be 4–5 nm. The calculated Pd size is close to that observed in our previous studies on monometallic (Pd, Pt, Ir) and Pd-based bimetallic particles synthesized using the same microemulsion conditions [41]. The nitrogen sorption-desorption isotherms for the Pd/C(SBA) and Pd/C(SBA)-N catalysts (see Fig. S2a in the supplementary electronic datafile) are of type IV with a H1 hysteresis loop at p/po between 0.4 and 0.7. A sharp step in the sorption isotherm shows structurally ordered morphology with mesopores of narrow pore size distribution. In both the initial and the oxidized-carbons supported catalysts the pores are observed in the range of 2–4 nm with average pore width ca. 3.5 nm. Both catalysts have high specific surface area and mesopore volume (Table 1) with similar low contribution of micropores (ca. 7–8%). The low angle XRD diffraction patterns (see Fig. S2b in the supplementary electronic datafile) are typical for carbon replicas prepared with a SBA-15 template. Three peaks indexed as (100) (110) and (200) characteristic for two-dimensional well-ordered hexagonal mesostructure with the space group of P6mm are observed. Thus, the ordered mesoporous structure is preserved in the nitric acid oxidized carbon-supported Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst. The small and broad graphite (002) peak at 2θ ∼20° in the wide angle patterns (Fig. 1c) indicates an amorphous structure with a low degree of graphitization. Based on a peak at 2θ ∼40°, indexed to (111) plane of crystalline Pd, the average Pd crystallite size was calculated to be 4–5 nm in both catalysts, similarly to the C(Si)-series samples. The morphology of SBA-series catalysts presents an ordered system of carbon nanorods which corresponds to an inverse structure of the SBA-15 template (Fig. 2 a). On the other hand, the morphology of SiO2-series catalysts consists of the aggregated carbon grains of irregular shapes (Fig. 2c). Similar morphology has been previously observed for nanostructured carbons prepared using sucrose and γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 templates [42,43]."
8,Analysis of oxygen-containing groups,"3.2 Analysis of oxygen-containing groups The surface of carbon materials is characterized by the presence of various oxygen-containing groups, such as phenolic, ether, carbonyl and carboxyl ones. The general view is that the ordered mesoporous carbons are hydrophobic in nature because the heat treatment increases the degree of carbonization, removing most of the surface oxygen groups and lowering the hydrophilicity of the mesopore walls [44,45]. The increased surface density of oxygen-containing groups after oxidation contributed to the increased polarity and wettability of the samples. The oxygen-containing groups have been proposed to be derived from COSi bonds formed at the carbon/silica interface during the carbonization processes, leaving COH groups behind after the removal of the silica template. As a result of different polarity of the carbon sources and different courses of carbonization processes the samples synthesised with the same silica template have different surface characteristics, with sucrose-derived carbon being significantly more hydrophobic than its counterpart prepared using anthracene. The water vapour sorption, water contact angle kinetics methods and cyclic voltammetric response in acidic solutions have been developed to characterize the wettability of the carbon samples. However, the polarity/wettability of the carbon replicas has been definitively less studied than their morphology, porosity and thermal stability. The FT-IR spectra of the initial and the oxidized carbons-supported catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3 a,b. They show several bands within the 1000–1800 cm−1 region characteristic of the oxygenated carbon groups. The bands below 960 cm-1 are characteristic of out-of-plane deformation vibrations of CH groups in aromatic structures. The overlapping broad bands in the 1000–1200 cm−1 region correspond to CO stretching and COH bending modes in alcohols as well as COC vibrations in ether structures [46]. The bands in the 1450–1650 cm−1 region are assigned to quinone and keto-enol structures. The band at 1630 cm−1 can be also related to the vibrations of adsorbed water. The band centred at 1720 cm−1 is commonly related to the CO stretching vibrations of carbonyl and carboxyl groups [47]. The bands of oxygenated carbonyl groups are weak in the spectra of initial carbons-supported Pd/C(Si) and Pd/C(SBA) catalysts, but their intensity distinctly grows in the oxidized carbons-supported samples especially in the HNO3-treated Pd/C(Si)N and Pd/C(SBA)-N catalysts. In their spectra, the bands at 1535–1570 cm−1 and at ca. 1720 cm−1 assigned to CO in quinone and COOH structures are clearly observable. This implies that nitric acid treatment resulted in more oxidized carbon compared to H2O2-treated one. This conclusion is consistent with previous literature data [46,48] as well as with the registered XPS C 1 s spectra. The surface content of carbon, oxygen and palladium (at%) are collected in Table S1 (see the supplementary electronic datafile). Both oxidative treatments, with HNO3 and H2O2, result in the increased oxygen content which is especially higher for the nitric-acid treated sample what is consistent with previously reported data [34]. It can be seen that the oxygen content equal to 9.8% in the initial carbon-supported catalyst Pd/C(Si) increases to 11.1 at% in the Pd/C(Si)O and up to 15.1 at% in the Pd/C(Si)N. The oxygen amount attains similarly high level (16.6 at%) in the Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst (see Table S1 in the supplementary electronic datafile) The C 1 s spectra of all the catalysts are typical for carbonaceous samples such as carbon blacks with a graphite-like, polyaromatic surface [48–50]. The spectra are dominated by an intense and asymmetrical graphite peak at BE = 284.4 eV assisted by a small high-energy peak above 290.4 eV corresponding to π → π* plasmon excitation [49,50]. The C 1 s peaks components corresponding to the oxygenated carbon groups COH (286.3 eV), CO (287.4 eV) and COOH (288.4 eV) are also observed. The percentage area of individual carbon groups in C 1 s peak is summarized in Fig. 3. All the COH, CO and COOH groups in the initial carbon-supported catalysts are observed at comparable contributions. The fractions (%) of the sum of oxidized moieties to C 1 s peak are similar, i.e. 19.7 and 19.9% in both initial Pd/C(Si) and Pd/C(SBA) catalysts, respectively. The fraction of the oxidized groups grows to 20.2% in the hydrogen peroxide treated catalyst and this growth is higher, up to 23.5% in the nitric acid treated catalyst. This observation is consistent with the FT-IR spectra. As the result, the surface O/C atomic ratio grows from 0.11 for initial Pd/C(Si) catalyst to 0.13 for the Pd/C(Si)O catalyst and finally to 0.18 for the Pd/C(Si)N catalyst (Table 2 ). Similar trend can be seen for SBA-series catalysts, as the surface O/C atomic ratio grows from 0.1 for initial Pd/C(SBA) catalyst to 0.21 for the Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst. The presence of the oxidized carbon groups is also confirmed by the XPS O 1 s results (see Fig. S3 and S4 in the supplementary electronic datafile) presenting the peaks components at 531.0 eV (CO in quinone), 532.7 eV (oxygen in OH, ether, ester, anhydride and carboxyl), 534.3 eV (ether oxygen in ester, anhydride and OH in carboxyl group). The energy above 535.0 eV is related to the adsorbed water. The spectra of oxidized carbon-supported catalysts show the oxidized carbon moieties at various proportions compared to initial carbon-supported catalysts."
9,Characterization of palladium,"3.3 Characterization of palladium It has been previously observed that the morphological and structural features of the carbon replicas influenced the Pd particles penetration inside the porous system and the metal particles aggregation [29]. The ordered mesoporous carbons synthesized with the SBA-15 template produced the catalysts with the most Pd-enriched surface. These ordered carbon structures possessed high surface area and uniform mesopores of width of 2–3 nm, much below the Pd particle size, 4–5 nm, what restricted the metal particles penetration inside the pore system and the Pd particles located mostly on the outer surface of carbon rods. Furthermore, a low surface density of the oxygenated carbon groups due to very high surface area of replicas did not prevent the Pd particles migration/aggregation. As a result, various branched Pd structures consisting of a few primary metal particles appeared in the catalysts supported on SBA-templated replicas (Fig. 4 a). Similar effect was observed in the Pd3Pt-CMK-3 system [51]. The size of Pd3Pt particles of ca. 5 nm exceeded the pore width of ordered carbon CMK-3 (ca. 3 nm) which resulted in extensive agglomeration of the Pd3Pt particles on the external surface. The nanostructured SiO2-derived carbon replicas possessed almost uniform mesopores of ca. 8 nm width (Fig. 1a) which were large enough to accommodate the Pd particle. As the result, the Pd/C(ss-Si) catalyst are characterized by somewhat lower enrichment of outer surface in Pd compared to SBA-templated counterpart. Simultaneously, no extensive aggregation of the Pd particles in the SiO2-templated sucrose derived replica occurred (Fig. 5 ). Surface concentration of Pd determined by XPS is collected in Table 2. No chlorine residuals from the metal precursors were found in the XPS survey spectra. Although the nominal Pd loading in all our catalysts is similar 1.30–1.89 wt% (Table 2), the surface concentration of Pd (2.45 and 3.11 at%) in SBA-series catalysts is ca. 2-times higher than in the SiO2-series ones (1.47, 1.49 and 1.03 at%). As the X-ray penetration does not exceed ca. 6–8 nm, the obtained Pd data corresponds to the percentage of palladium atoms in the surface layers. To compare the enrichment of carbon surface in palladium, the surface to bulk Pd(s)/Pd(b) atomic ratio is taken into discussion (where Pd(s) is determined by XPS, and Pd(b) by XRF), similarly to what was reported by Calvo et al. [52]. The authors found a good correlation between the activity in hydrodechlorination reactions and the Pd surface concentration in activated carbons-supported Pd catalysts. In the Pd/C(SBA) and Pd/C(SBA)-N catalysts the Pd(s)/Pd(b) ratios are as high as 16.8 and 16.5, respectively and they are ca. 1.5–2 times higher compared to SiO2-templated catalysts. A similar trend is observed when the XPS-derived surface palladium to carbon atomic ratios (Pd:C) are compared with the nominal values determined by the XRF analysis (see Table S1 in the supplementary electronic datafile). The surface Pd:C ratio is ca. 10–20 times higher than bulk Pd:C in all catalysts thus showing the enrichment of their outer surface with Pd. Thus, similarly to our previous results [29], the Pd penetration inside the grains of SBA-templated replicas, both the initial and the oxidized one is more effectively inhibited than in the SiO2-series. Similar XPS Pd 3d spectra are registered for the initial and for the oxidized carbon supported catalysts (see Fig. S5 in the supplementary electronic datafile). For all catalysts two palladium states with strong predomination of Pd 3d5/2 component at energy of 335.5 eV, related to metallic palladium appear (Table 2). The share around 10–14% corresponds to the palladium of higher binding energy 337.1–337.2 eV which could be related to the oxidized palladium species like in the PdO formed as a result of surface oxidation of palladium particles. The nanoparticles of Pdo are capable of oxidation upon air (oxygen) contact during storage of catalysts in air atmosphere [49]. The Pd metal state accompanied by oxidized palladium species (Pdδ+) was also observed in the Pd/CNT, Pd/carbon black and Pd/active carbon catalysts [15,16,52]. Similar XPS surface characteristics of the palladium state in all studied catalysts are consistent with the results reported by Toebes et al. [25,26] who observed by XPS technique that the various concentrations of oxygenated carbon groups in the Pt/CNF catalysts did not induce any changes in the Pt 4f7/2 binding energies. The H2 chemisorption also revealed that oxygenated carbon groups did not affect the Pt electron properties in these Pt/CNF catalysts. The morphology of catalysts observed by the SEM images show the Pd particles relatively well dispersed through the carbon grains in both SBA- (Fig. 2b) and SiO2-series catalysts (Fig. 2d). However, in view of the TEM micrographs, an extent of the Pd particles aggregation differs significantly (Figs. 4 and 5). In the SiO2-series catalysts the nearly monodisperse spherically shaped Pd particles are present, regardless of the surface characteristics of the carbon replica, initial or oxidized (Fig. 5). The individual particles strongly predominate over only occasionally observed small agglomerates composed of a few primary particles. The distribution profiles show the particles of size within a narrow range of 2–5.5 nm (±0.5 nm) in both Pd/C(Si) and Pd/C(Si)N catalysts. The similar Pd particle average size of 3.6–3.7 nm is calculated for both catalysts (Fig. 5). In contrast, the branched Pd structures composed of several primary Pd particles dominate in the TEM micrograph of the initial carbon-supported Pd/C(SBA) catalyst with individual particles rarely present (Fig. 4a). A different morphology can be seen in the oxidized carbon-supported Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst (Fig. 4b). The branched palladium structures only occasionally appear whereas the individual metal particles dominate. The Pd particle distribution profile calculated for this oxidized carbon-supported Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst (Fig. 4b) is similar to those in SiO2-series catalysts with the Pd average size of 3.7 nm. More uniformly dispersed Pd particles in the Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst can be related to the presence of oxygenated carbon groups, similarly to previous results [17,20,23,53,54]. It has been widely observed that the oxygenated carbon species have a promotional effect on the metal particles dispersion which increases with the growing amount of surface oxygen groups. High surface density of oxygenated carbon groups also prevented the metal particles from aggregation upon the thermal treatment. This effect was observed during immobilization of pre-formed Au colloidal particles on the oxidized CNT [55]. The oxygenated carbon groups stabilized the Au particles and protected them from severe aggregation during calcination. In the present work, the pre-formed Pd particles present in the microemulsion medium are deposited on the carbon via destabilization (by slow addition of THF) carried out in the presence of support. Upon a slow removal of the surfactant an interaction between the Pd particles and the carbon surface slowly increases finally leading to the deposition of the Pd particles. The pore size distributions of the SiO2-derived carbon samples, the initial and the oxidized, show the mesopores within the range of 2–15 nm (Fig. 1a), what is larger than the Pd size making the penetration of Pd possible. The oxygenated carbon groups additionally facilitate the migration process as the surface of initial Pd/C(Si) catalyst with the smallest content of oxidized groups is more enriched in Pd as Pd(s)/Pd(b) = 10.7, compared to both Pd/C(Si)O and Pd/C(Si)N catalysts with the Pd(s)/Pd(b) equal to 7.5 and 6.3, respectively (Table 2). It could be partially ascribed to the deeper penetration of Pd most probably facilitated by the presence of oxygenated groups. On the other hand, in both SBA-templated carbon replicas, the pores of width 2–4 nm (Fig. 1b) are too small to accommodate the Pd particles with consequent enrichment of outer surface in Pd. However, the surface content of oxygenated groups in the bare C(SBA) carbon was too low to effectively prevent the metal particles aggregation and the branched Pd structures composed of the primary particles dominate (Fig. 4a). The higher content of oxygenated groups in the oxidized carbon gives rise to much better metal particles dispersion in the Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst with domination of individual Pd particles (Fig. 4b)."
10,Catalytic activity in FU hydrogenation,"3.4 Catalytic activity in FU hydrogenation It has been verified in our introductory FU catalytic hydrogenation tests that no hydrogen transfer reaction with 2-propanol occurred under reaction conditions (6 bar, 35 °C) [40]. The reagents distribution profiles are displayed in Figs. 6 and 7 over SiO2- and SBA-series catalysts, respectively. Under the reaction conditions, FA and THFA are the major products formed over all the tested catalysts. Tetrahydrofurfural was detected by GC–MS analysis at negligible amount (below 1 mol%) only over Pd/C(Si) catalyst. Furthermore, isopropyl furfuryl ether (ET), and furfural diisopropyl acetal (AC), the products of weak acid sites-catalysed reactions with the participation of the 2-propanol solvent were detected at very low amount (1–2 mol%) only over Pd/C(Si) and Pd/C(SBA) catalysts (Figs. 6 and 7). The formation of these products (AC, ET) was catalysed by the protons provided by alcohol solvent [56] or the acid functional groups of carbon supports in Ru/C [16,57] and MWNT-supported Pt, Pt catalyst [18]. The carboxyl surface species are also detected by XPS C 1 s in our catalysts. The GC peaks of furan and 2-methylfuran (MF) overlapped with a broad peak of 2-propanol solvent making the analysis of these products difficult. As no tetrahydrofurfural was detected amongst the products, except the traces over Pd/C(Si) catalyst, it might be assumed that in the presence of our catalysts tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is formed through the FA hydrogenation similarly to other Pd-based catalysts [58,59]. It should be stressed, that the side-products termed as ""humins"" including the products of FA oligomerization and self-etherification as well as FU degradation could be formed during hydrogenation [60]. For instance, in FU hydrogenation studied under conditions (2-propanol, 300 °C, 3 bar) similar to our experiments, the unknown products attained level of 40–60% over Pd/activated carbon [15], 12% over Pd/MWNT [18], 13% in the case of Pd/active carbon [61] and 5–13% over Pd/SiO2 [58]. The carbon mass balance (CB) calculated as the sum of all identified products: FA + THFA + AC + ET are plotted in Figs. 6 and 7. The carbon mass balance (CB level) is higher than 90% over both initial Pd/C(Si) and Pd/C(SBA) catalysts up to the FU conversion of 50–60%, then slowly decreases attaining ca. 82–85% in the final solutions. In contrast, the CB level is close to 100% over all the oxidized-carbon supported catalysts where FA and THFA are the only products formed. The activity of SiO2- and SBA-series catalysts is comparatively shown in Fig. 8 a,c. In both series, the initial carbon-supported Pd/C(Si) and Pd/C(SBA) catalysts are the most active. It is evidenced by the highest initial rates of FU hydrogenation (R(FU)) (Table 2). The catalysts based on the oxidized carbons display lower activity. The increased content of oxidized carbon groups (Pd/C(Si) < Pd/C(Si)O < Pd/C(Si)N) corresponds well to the order of decreased activity (Fig. 8a). All the SiO2-series catalysts display the same FA selectivity as the curves of the FA contents vs. FU conversion are close (Fig. 8b). In contrast, the selectivity of furan ring hydrogenation yielding THFA differs (Fig. 8b). The Pd/C(Si)O and Pd/C(Si)N catalysts display similar and ca. 2-times higher THFA selectivity than Pd/C(Si) catalyst. Thus, oxidized-carbon supported catalysts are less active but they exhibit much higher tendency towards THFA formation than initial carbon-supported Pd/C(Si) catalyst although there is no essential difference in the Pd particle size and metal particles distribution. The influence of oxidized carbon groups is also observed for the SBA-series catalysts (Fig. 8d). The oxidized carbon-supported Pd/C(SBA)-N catalyst offers somewhat higher FA selectivity than the initial Pd/C(SBA) sample. However, both catalysts exhibit similar THFA selectivity. Based on the CB profiles one may notice that the formation of products other than FA and THFA is almost completely suppressed over oxidized-carbon-supported catalysts Pd/C(SBA)-N and Pd/C(Si)N (Figs. 6, 7). Thus, these catalytic results support our introductory supposition that the oxygenated carbon moieties influenced the FU hydrogenation [29]. Since the catalysts exhibit various Pd surface concentrations the effect of oxygen-containing carbon groups expressed by the surface O/Pd atomic ratio is taken into consideration (Table 2). The obtained O/Pd atomic ratios are lower (3.55 and 5.32) in the SBA-series catalysts compared to all three SiO2-series samples (6.70–14.70) because of ca. 2-times higher surface Pd concentration in the former (Table 2). Thus, the higher O/Pd ratio, the more polar the nearest environment of the Pd. The lower rate of FU conversion is assisted by an increased tendency to furan ring hydrogenation in FA leading to THFA formation. The initial rate of FU conversion vs. the surface content of oxygen representing all oxygenated carbon species is displayed in Fig. 9 a. Fig. 9b illustrates the correlation between the initial rate and the surface content of carboxyl groups. The data provided by XPS are considered. The decrease in the activity with the growing content of oxygenated functionalities is observed for both SiO2- and SBA-series catalysts. When the surface acidic groups are taken into consideration this relationship is almost linear (Fig. 9b). This effect is consistent with the relations reported by Toebes et al. [24] for the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation over Pt/CNF catalysts of various surface contents of oxygenated groups. In their studies, the correlation between activity and total oxygen amount was not as clear as between the activity and the surface content of acidic CNF groups (determined by the XPS) [24]. The authors found that when only few acidic groups were present on the surface the activity was high and it dropped linearly with the increase of surface acidity. This effect was explained by a hydrophobic CNF surface-assisted adsorption of cinnamaldehyde molecule through the phenyl ring which was hydrogenated by atomic hydrogen spillover from nearby Pt particle surface. As a result, the overall rate of aldehyde conversion increased. In particular, the rate of CC bond hydrogenation increased shifting the observed selectivity towards the saturated aldehyde. On the other hand, at a large concentration of oxygen-surface groups, the adsorption of aldehyde and the dissociation of hydrogen took place on the Pt sites, which mainly govern the hydrogenation process [24,25]. Recent studies have demonstrated that the hydrophobic modification of support improves catalytic reaction involving hydrophobic substrates, like hydrogenation of aromatic ketones (4-isobutyl acetophenone) over Pd/SiO2 via alcohol to alkyl-substituted phenyl [62]. The sililation of the SiO2 support enhanced the hydrophobicity of the support, on which the aromatic alcohol adsorbed weakly relative to the ketone reactant thus suppressing the consecutive hydrogenation of the alcohol. The hydrogenation of phenol on carbon-supported catalysts with the Pd particles located in a confined microenvironment consisting of the COH and COOH species proceeded at very low rate and with distinctly separated reaction stages including aromatic ring hydrogenation and reduction of the COH groups [63]. This reactivity has been related to the fact that phenol, a strongly H-bridge forming reagent, was enriched in the pores thus facilitating its subsequent conversion. The influence of the oxygenated carbon groups (COH, COOH, CO, epoxides) in the graphene oxide-based catalysts was found in the alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol to form alkyl levulinate [64]. Amongst various carbonyl moieties, the carboxyl groups played the most important role as they enhanced the adsorption of furfuryl alcohol reactant. It should be noted that the hydrogenation of FU is a structure sensitive reaction. As the size of the Pd metal particles increased, the tendency to activate the CC bonds of furan ring also grew [9]. The Pd particles are of similar size in each our catalyst (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, the observed activity/selectivity effects might be related to the different environment of the Pd particles expressed by the surface O/Pd atomic ratio. When the content of oxidized groups is low, the rate of FU hydrogenation is high, but besides FA and THFA, small amount of “other” side-products is formed. At higher surface content of oxidized groups the rate of FU conversion is distinctly decreased and accompanied by evident suppression of the tendency to “other” products formation. However, there is no essential change in the reactivity of FU to FA (Fig. 8b,d) while a tendency to the hydrogenation of furan ring in FA (expressed by the THFA selectivity) grows. This effect manifests distinctly over SiO2-series catalysts (Fig. 8b). In view of the relationship in Fig. 9b, the carboxylic acid groups seem to be amongst the ones that contribute to the loss of FU hydrogenation rate. Liu et al. [18] have reported that Pd and Pt supported on oxidized active carbon or MWCNT display lower activity but higher selectivity to THFA and lower tendency towards side-products formation than the initial carbons-supported counterparts. These effects were ascribed to the enhanced acidity of the nitric acid oxidized carbon samples. The authors concluded that the acid sites introduced due to the carbon oxidation could activate the formation of furfuryl-oxy intermediate providing a vital role in the FA and THFA formation. The mechanism of the furfuryl-oxy intermediate formation via FU bonding to the O-vacancy sites on the TiO2, an analogy between strong metal support interaction (SMSI) was proposed to explain the promotion of FA selectivity over the Pt/TiO2 catalyst [65]. On the other hand, the acidic properties of oxides SiO2, TiO2, Al-SBA-15 and β-zeolite supported Pd catalysts influenced the FU hydrogenation due to facilitated acetalization and etherification reactions [8,56]. Previous studies dealing with the catalysts combining the Pd particles and Brønsted acid sites (zeolites or SO3H-doped materials) have indicated a synergy between these sites ascribed to the formation of a “[Pdn H]+ adduct” with the protons bonded to the electron-deficient Pd particles. The resulting active “hybrid” sites can promote not only the Pd-catalysed reactions but also acid-catalysed ones [66,67], as the Pd-attached proton species exhibit enhanced acidity due to electron density growth on the oxygen atoms (in OH, SO3H). The obtained XPS Pd 3d binding energy results showed that there is no modification of the palladium electron properties by the oxidized carbon-supports (Table 2). These observations are consistent with the results obtained for the CNF-supported Pt and Ru catalysts [25,26]. However, the oxygenated carbon groups like COH, COOH might interact not only with the following reagents: FA, FU, but also with an alcohol solvent, similarly to what was observed in the studies dealing with the uptake of aromatic compounds like phenol from aqueous solutions on the carbonaceous materials [68,69]. It has been shown that the increased surface content of oxygenated carbon groups, COH but especially the COOH reduced the amount of adsorbed phenol. This effect was the result of a competitive adsorption of water and phenol molecules. The adsorbed water molecules interacted with the COH and COOH surface groups via the system of H-bonds, reducing the accessibility of the carbon surface for the phenol molecules [68]. The inhibiting effect of the COOH groups was stronger because one carboxyl group can form two H-bonds. Moreover, the COH and COOH groups might influence the adsorption ability of the carbon surface as a result of interactions with the π-electron systems of carbon structural units [69]. For instance, carboxyl groups at the edges of graphene layers show tendency to withdraw electrons weakening the interactions with the aromatic ring of the adsorptive molecule thus reducing its uptake. In contrast, the COH groups release electrons towards the π-electrons systems of carbon units. This mechanism including a change of carbon surface adsorptive properties due to the carbon oxidized species has been successfully adopted to explain the activity/selectivity effects of Pd-catalysts for the hydrodechlorination reaction of chlorobenzenes [19]. Based on the above literature reports, we can conclude that oxygenated carbon functionalities influenced FU hydrogenation under mild reaction conditions due to the oxidized carbon groups–reagents–alcohol solvent interaction effect. Thus, following the aldehyde molecule adsorption model reported by Toebes et al. [24–26] we can speculate that, at low content of oxidized carbon groups, apart from the Pd surface, the carbon surface could also provide the sites for the adsorption of organic reactants. Consequently, the overall FU conversion rate is high, but apart from the Pd-catalysed hydrogenation products (FA and THFA), the products of weak acid sites catalysed reactions, furfuryl isopropyl ether and/or furfural diisopropyl acetal could also be formed. On the other hand, with growing content of carboxylic acid sites the overall conversion of FU and a tendency of acid sites catalysed reactions are more and more inhibited. This effect could be related to the reduced access of the reactant molecules to the Pd-surface sites as the result of the growing tendency to the hydrogen bonds formation with the participation of oxygenated carbon groups – furfuryl alcohol – 2-propanol solvent. The effect will be more pronounced at deeper location of the Pd particles inside the porous carbon with higher surface content of oxygenated functionalities, the case of Pd/C(Si)N catalyst. Thus, the obtained results clearly show that the structural and surface characteristics of the carbon materials influenced the FU hydrogenation reaction in terms of both the conversion rate and the products distribution. This effect manifested itself in both series of studied catalysts and revealed that apart from the porous structure also the surface properties of carbon material including oxygenated surface groups influenced catalytic properties of the synthesized samples. The effect of porous structure was evidenced mostly in depth of the Pd particles penetration and their location in the catalyst whereas the oxygenated groups influenced the extent of metal particles aggregation in final catalyst. High content of the surface oxidized groups promoted good dispersion of the Pd particles. However, it facilitated the adsorption of alcohol solvent and the reagents, in particular furfuryl alcohol thus reducing the rate of FU hydrogenation."
11,Conclusions,"Two series of nanostructured mesoporous carbons-supported Pd catalysts of similar Pd loading (1.5–2 wt% Pd) and similar metal particles size (ca. 4 nm) but various amounts of surface oxidized carbon functionalities displayed different activity/selectivity patterns for the furfural hydrogenation carried out under mild reaction conditions (2-propanol, 35 °C, 6 bar H2). The carbon supports were synthesized through a hard-templating approach using mesoporous silica SBA-15-furfuryl alcohol or SiO2-sucrose systems. Wet oxidation of carbon replicas with HNO3 or H2O2 resulted in the formation of oxygenated carbon functionalities identified and quantified by XPS and FT-IR measurements. A polarity of the nearest Pd environment expressed by the surface O/Pd atomic ratio as well as the surface concentration of Pd influenced catalytic properties of the studied samples. In the presence of the initial carbon-supported catalysts, the rate of FU conversion was high. Apart from furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol as the main products, the products termed as “other”, were also formed at low content. The oxidized carbon-supported catalysts were less active but more selective towards furan ring hydrogenation with almost completely inhibited “other” products formation. The growing content of surface oxidized carbon groups (O/Pd ratio grows) corresponded well to the decreased activity. With growing content of carboxylic acid groups the overall conversion of furfural was more and more inhibited. This effect has been related to a gradually reduced access of the regents to the Pd-surface sites because of the growing tendency to the hydrogen bonds formation with the participation of the oxygenated carbon groups – furfuryl alcohol – 2-propanol alcohol solvent."
