0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered an ideal alternative carrier for fossil fuels, because the only product produced by combustion is water. One of the most promising methods for producing high-purity hydrogen is water electrolysis, which mainly involves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [1]. In theory, the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen requires a 1.23 V drive voltage, but the applied voltage is higher than this value. An efficient, stable and cheap electrocatalyst to overcome the energy barrier, speed up the reaction and reduce the total cost [2]. Currently, Pt and its alloys are considered to be the best HER catalysts, However, the high cost and the low abundance of precious metals severely restrict their broader applications [3]. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to explore the non-precious catalyst of transition metal based materials alternatives, such as phosphides, dichalcogenides, nitrides and carbides. In recent years, research on the preparation of low-cost and earth-abundant transition metal electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution catalysts has made some progress [4]. Among the above-mentioned electrocatalysts, transition metal phosphide, such as CoP [5–7], Ni2P [8,9], FeP [10] and CuP [11], have attracted significant research interest due to their low fabrication cost, good electrochemical stability, controllable valence of central metals, and suitable bonding energy for the intermediates of the HER [12,13]. Among various TMPs, CoP is a very promising candidate for its excellent HER performance and high stability. For example, Bangde Luo et al. synthetized glucose-derived carbon sphere supported (CoP/C) via a concise two-step method. The result showed that the prepared carbon sphere would increase the electrical conductivity, the electrons of Co transferred to P, and the highly electronegative P may capture the proton, which leads to the excellent electrocatalytic performance of CoP/C for HER [14]. Zhaoxia Yang et al. synthetized the needle-like CoP/rGO growth on Ni foam (NF), the experimental study showed that rGO may confine the growth of particles, and combination of the catalyst and conductive substrate improved the HER performance of the CoP/rGO [15]. However, most of the reported CoP catalysts prepared using traditional methods are still insufficient as they consist of simple configuration and morphological features, which lead to agglomeration of active substances and insufficient utilization of active sites for catalysis [16]. To further enhance the electrochemical performance, numerous efforts have been focused on optimizing both the electronic structure and surface potential of CoP. In principle, electrochemical activity of CoP can be further improved by increasing the active sites, surface area, and manipulating the reactants transport on the electrolyte/electrode interface. Previous studies have indicated that rational design of the catalyst structural framework and surface morphology is key to determine the exposure of active sites and the activity of the catalyst [17]. In the past decades, metal phosphides derived from the metal-organic framework (MOF) have been shown to be promising electrocatalysts for HER because of their high metal content, ultra-high porosity, high specific surface areas, tunable pore structures, and easily functionalized surfaces [18,19], especially, nanostructures with the open framework such as nanocages [20] and nanoframes [21] as electrocatalysts have stimulated huge research interests because of the facilitated charge and mass transportation. However, the design of transition metal phosphides derived from Co-MOF-71 layered structures as a precursor template for water splitting catalysts is still rarely reported. In this paper, the composite of CoP nanoparticles embedded in carbon matrices (CoP/C) with two-dimensional layered structure was synthesized via the direct and indirect phosphorization of a Co-based MOF-71. The schematic illustration for preparing CoP/C is shown in Fig. 1 . The metal organic framework MOF-71 was used as the precursor for preparation of graphitic carbon layers – dispersed CoP nanoparticles, which has a two-dimensional layered structure [22]. Two kinds of CoP/C catalysts were obtained by direct and indirect phosphating MOF-71 at low temperature, where Di-CoP/C showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER with an overpotential of 136 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density and a low Tafel slope of 49.3 V dec−1 in acidic media."

3,Preparation of MOF-71,"2.2 Preparation of MOF-71 A simple solvent-thermal method was used to prepare MOF-71 [23]. First, 1.15 g PTA was dissolved in a mixture solution of 50 ml DMF and 12.5 ml anhydrous alcohol by magnetic stirring for 10 min. Then, 2 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O was added and stirred for another 30 min. Transferring purple mixture solution within the 100 ml high-pressure reaction kettle, then heated in 100 °C for 12 h. Afterward, the reaction kettle was naturally cooled to room temperature, the purple precipitate was obtained by centrifugation and washed with DMF and anhydrous ethanol three times, then transferred the product to vacuum oven to dry at 110 °C for 12 h, got a purple crystal MOF-71 sample."
4,Preparation of Co3O4/C and In-CoP/C,"2.3 Preparation of Co3O4/C and In-CoP/C The as-prepared MOF-71 (100 mg) was placed in a small porcelain boat and put it in the center of the tubular furnace. The oxidation reaction was carried out in air atmosphere for 1.5 h under 450 °C, with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The black powder (Co3O4/C) was collected after the tube was cooled to room temperature [24]. And then, the obtained Co3O4/C (0.1 g) and 1.2 g NaH2PO2 were respectively placed at two difference boats and put in the center of tube furnace, and NaH2PO2 was placed at the upstream side of the furnace. Before the tube furnace starts heating, argon gas was flowed through the tube. Subsequently, the samples were heated at 350 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under an argon atmosphere. After naturally cooled to ambient temperature, the black powder was collected, designated as Di-CoP/C [25]. (It must be noted here that NaH2PO2 will decompose and produce toxic PH3 gas when heated to above 250 °C, so tail gas treatment is needed.)"
5,Preparation of Di-CoP,"2.4 Preparation of Di-CoP The 0.1 g prepared MOF-71 and 1.2 g NaH2PO2 were placed into two difference boats with NaH2PO2 at upstream side of the tube furnace. Subsequently, phosphating in the same way as described above, the black powder was collected when the tube furnace cooled to room temperature, designated as Di-CoP/C."
6,Material characterizations,"2.5 Material characterizations The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D/Max-2500 X-ray diffraction (XRD) manufactured by Rigaku Company in Japan. The radiation source was Cu Kα (=0.154056 nm), the target pressure was 40 kV, the target current was 80 mA, the scanning speed was 4(°)·min−1, and the scanning range was 2 = 5°–80°. The cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SU-8020, FESEM, secondary electron imaging, acceleration voltage 10 kV) produced by Japan and Israel High-tech Company was used to observe its morphology and structure, and the energy spectrometer (EDX) equipped with the electron microscope was used to test the element composition and distribution (test voltage was 20 kV)."
7,Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements Preparation of working electrode: 5 mg catalyst powder and 0.5 mg black carbon was dispersed in the mixed solution of 1 ml ethanol and 10 μL Nafion (5 wt%) and sonicated for 30 min to form a homogenous ink. Then 10 μL catalyst ink was dropped on the cleaned glassy carbon electrode (GCE, diameter of 6 mm) and dried naturally, yielding a mass loading of 0.175 mg cm−2. The Pt/C electrode was made according to the same process. All electrochemical experiments were performed on VMPIII electrochemistry workstation (Princeton Applied Research Inc.) by using a three-electrode system in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte. The graphite rod, saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and the prepared working electrode served as counter, reference and working electrodes, respectively. All potentials versus SCE were converted to potentials versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by expression ERHE = ESCE + 0.059 × pH + 0.242. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique was conducted at the scan rate of 2 mV·s−1 in the potential range of −0.8 V to 0.1 V (vs. RHE), when the Tafel plots were calculated by LSV results. All the polarization curves were corrected using 90% iR compensation [26]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in the frequency range of 0.1–100,000 Hz at the potential of 0.442 V vs. SCE with an amplitude of 5 mV. The equivalent circuit of the EIS data was fitted with Z View software. The stability of the catalyst in 0.5 M H2SO4 was tested by chronoamperometry at 136 mV vs. RHE. To estimate the electrochemically active area, the CV measurements were performed at different scanning rates from 10 mV·s−1 to 200 mV·s−1 to get Cdl values in potential range of 0.12–0.22 V vs. RHE."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Physicochemical characterization,"3.1 Physicochemical characterization As shown in Fig. 1, MOF-71 was firstly prepared by solvothermal method, its XRD characterization and SEM image were shown in the Fig. 2 (a) and (b). It can be observed that MOF-71 was synthesized successfully in this work. On the one hand, the position and intensity of its characteristic peak are consistent with those previously reported [27,28]; on the other hand, MOF-71 had a stack of layered structure and surface smooth. Then different CoP/C catalyst was obtained by low-temperature phosphating method. As you can see from Fig. 3 (a) and (b), the morphology of the Di-CoP/C under medium power electron microscopy and high power electron microscopy were shown respectively, after directly low temperature phosphating reaction, its layered structure did not change obviously, but the surface become rough and showed a homogeneous porous structure. So it was speculated Di-CoP/C had a larger specific surface area after phosphating. For this reason, we tested the specific surface area of the catalyst materials before and after phosphating reaction, and the test results in Table 1 , proved that our conjecture was correct. Fig. 3(g–i) was taken with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), and Fig. 3(g) showed that the surface of Di-CoP/C was uniform. Fig. 3(c) and (d) were SEM images of Co3O4/C, the surface of the oxidized MOF-71 turned into nano-particles of uniform size with a diameter of about 25 nm, which can be observed in Fig. 3(h), and the whole structure remained a certain stacked layered structure. The surface of obtained In-CoP/C wasirregular honeycombed as shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f). However, its layered structure was difficult to maintain, and it can be seen from Fig. 3(i) that each honeycombed nanometer layer is composed of nanoparticles with a diameter of about 40 nm. Therefore, it can be seen that two cobalt phosphide catalysts with completely different morphologies and structures were prepared by two different methods. The surface area and pore structure information on the Di-CoP/C and MOF-71 samples are investigated by N2 sorption. The structural properties of the MOF-71 and Di-CoP/C are comprehensively summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table, the specific surface area of the precursor MOF-71 was 18.1276 m2·g−1. After phosphating, the specific surface area increases to 28.3702 m2·g−1, and the pore volume also increases. The porosity of the Di-CoP/C catalyst is benficial for charge and mass transport for electrocatalysis. It can be seen from the EDX pattern of Fig. 4 that four elements Co, P, O and C existed in the direct phosphating products, there were more C and O elements because there were more of them in the precursor, the proportion of Co and P elements was about 1:1, so it could be guessed that the direct phosphating product was CoP/C. As can be seen from the element distribution diagram in Fig. 4, the distribution of these four elements on the nanometer layer was relatively uniform. Fig. 5 showed the XRD patterns of Co3O4/C, Di-CoP/C and In-CoP/C, the diffraction peak of oxidized MOF-71 has a good correspondence with the Co3O4 standard card (PDF#43-1003) in Fig. 5(c). The diffraction peaks at 19.0, 31.3, 36.8, 55.6 and 59.4 correspond to the crystal faces of (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) of oxidized MOF-71, which were consistent with those reported in the literature [23]. In addition, there were no other impurity peaks, indicating that the Co3O4 generated is of high purity. The diffraction peak of Di-CoP/C obtained by direct phosphating had a good correspondence with the standard card (PDF#29-0497) in Fig. 5(a), in which the diffraction peak at 31.6, 36.3, 48.1 and 56.3 correspond to (001), (111), (211) and (301) crystal surfaces respectively. The diffraction peak of In-CoP/C corresponded well to the standard card (PDF#29-0497) and (PDF#43-1004) in Fig. 5(b), confirming the coexistence of CoP and CoO in the electrocatalyst, among which the diffraction peak at 36.5, 42.4 and 61.5 corresponded to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal surface of CoO respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further characterize the chemical composition and chemical binding state of Di-CoP catalyst. The XPS full spectrum analysis (Fig. 6 (a)) showed that the catalyst material contains three elements, C, Co and P. Fig. 6(b), (c) and (d) correspond to the fine spectra of C 1s, Co 2p and P 2p, respectively. All three elements were nuclear corrected and the obtained binding energies were calibrated by referring to the C 1s peak (284.80 eV) [29]. High-magnification spectra in the C 1s regions showed three peaks. The peak at 284.80 eV is the standard peak of C 1s, corresponding to CC. The peaks around 285.78 eV and 286.82 eV correspond to C–P and CO, respectively, indicating that carbon bonds in the material were bonded to phosphorus and oxygen. For the spectra of Co 2p in Fig. 6(c) was deconvoluted into peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 at 779.22 eV and 781.86 eV, respectively. 786.84 eV was the satellite peak. Co 2p3/2 (779.22 eV) and Co 2p1/2 (798.31 eV) were corresponded to the Co-P, 802.49 eV and 805.21 eV were the satellite peaks. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the fine spectrum of P 2p can be divided into three peaks, which were 128.78 eV,129.42 eV and 133.79 eV, corresponding to P 2p3/2, P 2p1/2 and P–O respectively. And the formation of P–O was caused by the partial oxidation of the material exposed to air."
10,Electrochemical performances,"3.2 Electrochemical performances In order to study the electrocatalytic activity of CoP/C, the Pt/C (Pt mass fraction was 20%) and Co3O4 were compared. In Fig. 7 (a) and (b), the linear sweep voltametry (LSV) curve shows that Pt/C had a very low initial potential (the potential required for the electrocatalyst to produce a current density of 1 mA·cm−2) [36.7 mV (vs. RHE)], and HER activity was the best when the current density reached 10 mA·cm−2 and 50 mA·cm−2, with overpotential only 54 mV (vs. RHE) and 81 mV (vs. RHE). In contrast, Co3O4 had the worst electrochemical activity. When the current density reached 10 mA·cm−2, the overpotential of Di-CoP/C and In-CoP/C were 136 mV (vs. RHE) and 163 mV (vs. RHE), and when the current density reached 50 mA·cm−2, the overpotential were 183 mV and 234 mV, respectively. We can find the HER catalytic property of Di-CoP/C is highest among these electrocatalysts. After phosphorization, the catalytic performance of MOF-71 and cobalt oxide has been greatly improved. This was because of the open layered porous structure of MOF-71, the active site can be fully exposed, the electron and ion transfer distance were shortened. And the CoP were the major catalytic active sites for HER, where Co site (δ+ ) were positively charged and P site (δ −) were negatively charged, in which the Co serve as a hydride receptor, whereas the P act as a proton receptor [30]. The synergistic effect of Co and P made CoP catalyst showed lower ΔGH* [31]. The derived carbon in Di-CoP/C and In-CoP/C made the catalyst have a certain electrical conductivity, after adding carbon powder, the conductivity of the catalyst was greatly improved, and the electron transfer rate on the surface of the catalyst become faster. But for In-CoP/C, the presence of oxide reduced the efficiency of its hydrogen evolution reaction, thus the Di-CoP/C showing the optimal performance of HER [32]. To explore HER mechanism, the Tafel plots are shown in Fig. 6(d), the kinetic parameters of the electrode can be calculated according to the equation [33]: η = b log j + a Tafel slope b of the catalyst reveals the favorable kinetics of HER catalysts. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the Tafel slope of the commercial platinum carbon catalyst (Pt mass fraction was 20%) was the lowest, with a slope of 30.2 mV·dec−1, while the Tafel slope of Di-CoP/C was measured to be 49.3 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of In-CoP/C (54.0 mV dec−1), suggesting the more efficient HER process on Di-CoP/C. Apparently, the values of Di-CoP/C and In-CoP/C is close to the standard value (~40 mV dec−1) of Heyrovsky step, which also indicates that the process of electrochemical desorption step was the rate-limiting step, implying the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER processes of Di-CoP/C and In-CoP/C. In addition, the electrode kinetics of the as-prepared samples was further studied by EIS measurements. The Nyquist plots of Di-CoP/C, In-CoP/C, Pt/C and Co3O4/C display in Fig. 7(c). These EIS data were fitted by a simple equivalent electrical circuit (see in Fig. 7(c), composed of solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface and constant phase element (CPE). The semicircle diameter stands for the chargetransfer resistance (Rct) located at the electrode/electrolyte interface, lower Rct means faster reaction rate. As shown in Table 2 , the impedance of Pt/C (Pt mass fraction 20%) showed the minimum radius, explained that Pt/Celectrode had the minimum charge transfer resistance (Rct = 7.02 Ω). The order of the mass transfer resistance is Pt/C < Di-CoP/C < In-CoP/C < Co3O4/C, indicating that Di-CoP/C catalyst has an excellent charge transfer process and fast reaction. While the fitted CPE values of Di-CoP/C catalyst was higher than that of the other In-CoP/C and Co3O4/C samples. The lowest Rct value and highest CPE value suggests faster charge transfer at the same overpotential. This result suggests Di-CoP/C catalyst possesses the highest electrocatalytic reaction efficiency among them. Polarization curves (a) (scan rate: 2 mV·s−1) ; Three dimensional histograms of overpotential (b); Nyquist plots (c); Tafel plots (d); CV curves at different scan rates (10, 50, 100, 150, 200 mV·s−1) (e) and electrochemical double-layer capacitance (f) of different electrocatalysts In order to had a further study on the HER catalytic reaction, we compared the electrochemical active area (ECSA) by calculating the capacitance of the two layers (Cdl) of these electrode materials, because ECSA was proportional to Cdl [33], the value of the capacitance of the double layer can also represent the relative size of the electrochemical active area [34–36]. During the test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out in non-Faraday areas of several materials with different scan rates (10, 50, 100, 150, 200 mV·s−1), CV curves at different scan rates of Di-CoP was showed in Fig. 7(e). It can be seen from the Fig. 7(f) that the electrochemical activity area was sorted as Di-CoP/C(Cdl = 9.88 mF·cm−2) > In-CoP/C(Cdl = 8.16 mF·cm−2) > Co3O4/C(Cdl = 1.40 mF·cm−2), indicated that Di-CoP/C revealed the highest catalytic activity in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. A good catalyst must also have good stability to ensure that its catalytic performance will not decline after a period of work. Therefore, the stability of Di-CoP/C in 0.5 mol·L−1 H2SO4 solution was tested using the chronoamperometry at 136 mV vs. RHE for 12 h. It can be seen from the Fig. 8 , after a long time of catalytic reaction, its performance hardly weakened. According to the comparison with other literatures, the preparation method of cobalt phosphide catalyst in this paper was simple, and the electro-catalytic performance was better than that of the same type of catalyst as shown in the Table 3 ."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, in this paper, Di-CoP/C and In-CoP/C nanometer catalyst materials were synthesized by direct and indirect phosphating at low temperature using MOF-71 as the precursor. Both catalysts inherited the lamellar structure of the precursor to some extent, but granulation greatly increased the specific surface area of the catalyst. The Di-CoP/C showed lower overpotential in acidic electrolytes with the mass loading was 0.175 mg·cm−2. Moreover, the raw material of this catalyst is cheap and easy to be obtained, and the preparation method was simple, so it is very promising to replace the precious metal Pt in large-scale production and application. It provides a new idea for the synthesis of non-noble metal catalysts with different kinds of MOF materials as precursors."
