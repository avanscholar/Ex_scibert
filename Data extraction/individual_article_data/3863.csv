0,Introduction,"Hydrogen may become the energy carrier that could replace fossil fuels in the future, or it may simply continue to be an important commodity widely used in industry, particularly in oil refinery processes or in the production of ammonia for the manufacture of fertilizers. It is, however, a fact that current hydrogen production is substantial, between 38 and 53 million metric tonnes worldwide as of 2010 [1,2]. According to the US DoE, around 95% of the current US hydrogen production, which constitutes about half of world's hydrogen supply, comes from steam reforming of natural gas or other fossil fuel-based technologies [3,4], and the figures are not much different in the rest of the world [5]. Circa 80–92% of current global hydrogen production is destined for its use as a chemical in industry [1], but the prospects of using hydrogen in fuel cells for mobile and portable applications are promising and this ratio may vary in the near future, involving a substantial increase in hydrogen needs and demand. Therefore, it remains necessary to seek alternative, sustainable and environmentally-friendly means of producing hydrogen. In this context, hydrogen production from biomass poses one of the main alternatives along with other renewable sources, namely combining solar energy with water hydrolysis. Among these renewable energies, the use of biomass plays an important role because of its potential and availability, not only as an energy source but also as a source of raw materials. Biomass-derived renewable energy sources have the added benefit of no net increase in CO2 emissions. A review of processes and materials for efficient hydrogen production from biomass has recently been published [6]. The usual method for using energy resources and materials contained in biomass comprises thermal processes or biological transformation. Among the thermal processes, flash pyrolysis has become an alternative to obtain a liquid known as bio-oil through a rapid heating of biomass, giving yields of transformation of biomass into bio-oil of about 75–80% [7]. This fluid is a complex mixture of different compounds comprising acids, alcohols, aldehydes, sugars, phenolic compounds, etc. Its composition varies depending on the source of biomass used and on the pyrolysis reactor [8]. Bio-oil can be more easily transported than the original biomass, which is an advantage since the energy density of the transported material is significantly increased. On the other hand, it is a thermally unstable material which tends to polymerize when heated [9]. By water addition bio-oil can be separated into two fractions: an organic fraction and an aqueous fraction [10]. The first, which contains poorly soluble compounds from the decomposition of lignin, has been addressed as a source of chemicals with high added value, while the latter, with high water content, has been typically employed for the production of certain chemicals including smoky flavours, levoglucosan and glycolaldehyde [11]. An additional way to valorize the aqueous fraction of bio-oil is through hydrogen production by means of a catalytic steam reforming process, similar to natural gas or naphtha reforming [12] proceeding through the following reactions [13]: Steam reforming of oxygenates: (1) C n H m O k + ( n − k ) H 2 O → n CO + ( n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 (2) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O → n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 Water gas shift (WGS) reaction: (3) CO + H 2 O ⇔ CO 2 + H 2 The process yields a hydrogen-rich syngas which, conveniently conditioned, can serve for the production of high-purity hydrogen. Given the thermal instability of bio-oil, which undergoes thermal decomposition processes and polymerization and thus creates severe clogging problems upon being fed into reactors, a number of studies published in the literature have used model compounds of bio-oil to study the catalytic steam reforming process [6]. In previous works by our research group, acetic acid [14–17], acetol [17–20] and butanol [17,19] were selected as model compounds representing the major functional groups present in the aqueous fraction of bio-oil. The configurations of reactors used for the catalytic reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil and model compounds have been multiple, predominantly fixed-bed and fluidized bed reactors. Regarding the development of suitable catalysts for the process, two main approaches can be found in the literature: supported noble metal catalysts and Ni-based catalysts, both commercial and laboratory prepared. Some authors have studied supported noble metal catalysts such as Pt, Ru and Pd, in the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil or model compounds of it [21–27]. On the other hand, Ni-based catalysts have shown appropriate activity and selectivity towards hydrogen production at a much lower cost [10,12–20,28–30]. The catalysts for this process must present a high degree of activity for reforming, a high selectivity towards hydrogen production, a decrease in the formation of by-products such as CH4 and C2, and they must also be resistant to deactivation by coke formation on the catalyst surface. Deactivation by coking is the main issue for Ni-based catalysts which are more susceptible to carbon formation than noble metal-based catalysts [28]. The S/C ratio is a relevant process parameter. A high S/C ratio can help increasing the yield to H2, as a consequence of modifying the WGS equilibrium reaction. Besides, the excess of steam has been proven to be beneficial for gasifying some of the carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, hence enhancing the carbon conversion to gas and partially alleviating the deactivation of the catalyst [10,17,29]. On the other hand, using a very high S/C ratio is not appropriate in terms of the energy efficiency of the process. The amount of energy required to evaporate and heat the water up to the reaction temperature may compromise the viability of the process. Thus, an adequate S/C ratio must be selected, typically in the range between 5 and 7 [12]. The present work is a continuation of our previous works [14,17,19], aiming to increase insights into the behaviour of the catalytic reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil, both synthetic and also real fractions derived from pine wood, and working with a research Ni/Al catalyst prepared by coprecipitation. The aim is to study the influence of the following variables: reforming temperature, weight of catalyst/organic flow rate ratio and Ni content of the catalyst, in order to analyse their influence on the yield and selectivity to hydrogen, conversion of the aqueous fraction, activity and catalyst deactivation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental system,"2.1 Experimental system The experimental system is based on a small bench scale catalytic test rig consisting of a fixed bed placed inside a tubular reactor, made of quartz in order to avoid any catalytic wall effects, with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump to feed the reactants at a specified rate, a condenser to separate condensates from permanent gases once the reaction has taken place, and a micro gas chromatograph (Micro GC) to analyse the gases. A more detailed description of the installation can be found in our previous communication [14]. However, in the present work the feed inlet of the reactor was specially designed to avoid polymerization of the oligomers and sugars present in the aqueous fraction of bio-oil, which may cause clogging of the inlet. Therefore, contrary to the procedure carried out with the model compounds, the aqueous fraction of bio-oil is fed as a liquid into the reactor. The liquid is entrained into the reactor by means of two N2 streams, with the purpose of creating a nozzle effect. The resulting gas and liquid stream is fed into the reactor through 1/16 inch 316 stainless steel tubing, the tip being located inside the reactor just a few centimetres over the furnace. The experiments usually comprised five stages: preheating for ca. 1 h until the reduction temperature was reached, in-situ reduction of the catalyst, adjustment of the bed temperature to the reaction temperature, the reaction itself, and a cooling stage, with continuous analysis of the exit gases and collection of the condensates at the end of each experiment. The experimental system was operated at atmospheric pressure. The total nitrogen flow rate was fixed at 80 cm3 (STP)/min. Experiments were conducted for 2 h varying several parameters such as the reaction temperature (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 °C), the catalyst weight/organic flow rate (W/m org) ratio, ranging from 0 to 5.01 g catalyst min/g organics (0, 1.67, 2.54, 3.40 and 5.01 g catalyst min/g organics) and the nickel content in the catalyst (23, 28 and 33% Ni). The reduction of the calcined precursors of the catalysts was carried out at 650 °C during 1 h with diluted H2 (H2:N2, 1:10 v/v) as established in the above-mentioned previous work [14]."
3,Aqueous fraction of bio-oil,"2.2 Aqueous fraction of bio-oil The bio-oil was produced from the fast pyrolysis of pine wood and supplied by BTG, a company located in the Netherlands. The results of the characterization of the bio-oil and the aqueous fraction prepared from it are presented in Table 1 . From the ultimate analysis of the bio-oil, an empirical formula for the organics present in the bio-oil was determined: C H1.47O0.48. The nitrogen content in the bio-oil is negligible and thus not taken into consideration in the empirical formula. The aqueous fraction was separated following a similar method to that described in the literature [31], which is based on slow dropwise addition of the bio-oil into Milli-Q water, maintaining continuous moderate stirring and subsequent washing and filtering. The bio-oil-to-water mass ratio was set at 1:2 in the present work, in order to achieve an adequate separation of the aqueous fraction without excessive dilution of the organics in the aqueous phase. Other authors have also employed this ratio when extracting the aqueous fraction of bio-oil [10,25,28]. The organic content of the resultant aqueous phase was 16 wt.%, determined by difference with the water content determined by Karl-Fischer titration. The S/C ratio was therefore 7.64, similar to those of the references mentioned above. Such S/C ratio is high enough to favour the shift in the WGS equilibrium toward maximized hydrogen production. The empirical formula for the organics present in the mixture is C H2.39O0.71, similar to others found in the literature [25,29,32]."
4,Catalyst preparation,"2.3 Catalyst preparation Three Ni/Al catalysts with different Ni contents were prepared in the laboratory by coprecipitation using an increasing pH technique. The preparation method was similar to that described by Al-Ubaid and Wolf [33] and was detailed in our previous work [14]. The catalysts had 23, 28 and 33% nickel content (expressed as a Ni/(Ni + Al) relative atomic % of nickel) and were calcined at 750 °C for 3 h. The calcined catalysts were characterized by various techniques, including optical emission spectrometry by inductively coupled plasma (ICP – OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and hydrogen chemisorption. The results of the catalyst characterization have been previously reported [14], except for hydrogen chemisorption. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed with a MICROMERITICS ASAP 2010 C at 35 °C, after preliminary reduction (1 h) of the calcined precursors at 650 °C with H2 diluted in Ar (7 vol.%). Further details of the experimental procedure can be found elsewhere [17]. The measured Ni surface areas of the three catalysts were: 9.7 m2/g (23% Ni), 10.7 m2/g (28% Ni) and 13.9 m2/g (33% Ni) respectively. XRD analyses of the calcined precursors showed the presence of NiO and NiAl2O4 crystalline phases and that the proportion of NiO increased when the nickel content increased. A slightly greater surface area was found for 23 and 28% Ni contents than for the 33% Ni content."
5,Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations,"2.4 Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations The equilibrium values were calculated with the Aspentech HYSYS 3.2 simulation software by means of minimization of the Gibbs free energies. To do so, a Gibbs reactor module with a PRSV thermodynamic package was selected. Such a tool has the advantage of not requiring a reaction set to perform the equilibrium calculations. But it is necessary to input the expected compounds in the exit product (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2, C3, acetone, ketene,…). The Gibbs reactor module computes the outlet stream composition using the condition that the Gibbs free energy of the reaction system is at a minimum at equilibrium and assuming complete conversion of organic compounds in the feed. The real bio-oil aqueous fraction was simulated by taking into account the data from its elementary analysis. In order to simulate the feed, a combination of acetic acid, acetol and butanol was used, so as to have the C, H and O contents indicated by the elementary analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic reforming of the synthetic aqueous fraction,"3.1 Catalytic reforming of the synthetic aqueous fraction As a previous step to the study of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil, some work was carried out with a synthetic mixture of three compounds studied in previous papers [14,19]: acetic acid, acetol and butanol. The composition of the mixture was established after considering a review of the literature on the characterization of biomass pyrolysis liquids and their fractions [8,31,34]. It was decided to assume a content of 11 wt.% of carboxylic acids, 17 wt.% of aldehydes and ketones and an alcoholic content of 3 wt.% in the synthetic bio-oil. As a result, a total of 31 wt.% of water soluble organics in the bio-oil was taken into consideration, which coincides with the average content presented by Piskorz et al. [34]. Considering the amount of water required to prepare the synthetic aqueous fraction of bio-oil with a S/C ratio of 5.58, the composition of the mixture was calculated as follows: 7.2 wt.% of acetic acid, 11.1 wt.% of acetol and 2.0 wt.% of butanol. Experiments were conducted with two ratios of weight of catalyst/organic flow rate, 0.86 and 1.72 g catalyst min/g organic, and two catalysts with Ni contents of 28 and 33%, respectively, at one single temperature of 650 °C. A summary of the results of these experiments are shown in Table 2 . It must be stated that the data in Table 2 correspond to overall results for the whole duration of the experiment (2 h). In order to calculate the overall values, the data obtained in gas analyses versus time have been integrated. As observed for the individual model compounds, it can be appreciated that the 28% Ni catalyst shows the best results in terms of carbon conversion to gas, as well as hydrogen production, with lesser amounts of CO and secondary products (CH4 and C2). These results improve with increasing W/m org ratios, with a very similar product gas composition for the two catalysts. The evolution of the H2 and CO yields and the conversion of carbon to gas during the reforming time is shown in Figs. 1–3 . Along with the experimental results, the theoretical equilibrium values are depicted as horizontal lines in Figs. 1 and 2. The reactions that can occur are the aforementioned WGS reaction (3), the steam reforming of methane (4), and the Boudouard reaction (5). (4) CH 4 + H 2 O ⇔ CO + 3 H 2 (5) 2 CO ⇔ C + CO 2 In these figures it can be seen that, whilst the 28% Ni catalyst has a fairly stable performance over time both in terms of conversion and product gas yields, the 33% Ni shows a progressive decay with the reaction time, more noticeable at the lowest W/m org ratio tested, possibly due to an increased deposition of coke. The experimental values are close to the predicted values at equilibrium, except for the case of the H2 yield obtained using the 33% Ni catalyst, which shows much lower values than the predicted ones with increasing reaction time. The catalyst seems to deactivate progressively, with product gas yields considerably decreasing compared to the initial values at the W/m org ratios tested. This decrease in hydrogen production is simultaneously accompanied by a decrease in CO2 and an increase in methane and C2 with time (results not shown), results that some authors suggest to be indicative of deactivation [28,35]. This evolution of gaseous products suggests that the deactivation of the catalyst mainly affects either the WGS reaction (3) or methane reforming (4), or even the gasification of the deposits rather than the reforming reactions (1 and 2). The deposition of coke facilitates thermal decomposition reactions (6), making the gasification of carbonaceous deposits more difficult (7 and 8), (6) C n H m O k ⇒ C x H y O z + gas ( H 2 , CO , CO 2 , CH 4 , … ) + coke (7) C + H 2 O ⇔ H 2 + CO (8) C + H 2 ⇔ CH 4 The results obtained with the synthetic aqueous fraction are very similar to those obtained with acetol [19] and suggest that the aqueous fraction of bio-oil can be effectively subjected to a catalytic reforming process with the catalyst with 28% Ni content."
8,Catalytic steam reforming of aqueous fraction of bio-oil,"3.2 Catalytic steam reforming of aqueous fraction of bio-oil The aqueous fraction of bio-oil obtained as described in the experimental section was subjected to catalytic reforming experiments in which the weight of catalyst/organic flow rate ratio, the Ni content of the catalysts and the reaction temperature have been studied. Unlike the synthetic aqueous fraction, which did not present any problems on being fed into the reactor, it was observed that in these experiments a large amount of carbonaceous deposits was formed over the catalyst bed as a result of compounds that did not evaporate completely before coming into contact with the catalyst [29,36], despite the injection design of the experimental system with simultaneous feeding of N2 and organic liquid. These carbonaceous deposits were more or less abundant depending on the reaction conditions, making the operation of the reactor more unstable over time and eventually leading to a complete clogging of the reactor. This problem could be solved by improving the feeding system. 3.2.1 Effect of the W/m org ratio The effect of the W/m org ratio was studied with the 28% Ni catalyst at a reforming temperature of 650 °C and a reaction time of 2 h. Five different W/m org ratios were studied, maintaining the feeding rate of the aqueous fraction constant and varying the amount of catalyst used. The W/m org ratios tested were 0, 1.67, 2.54, 3.40 and 5.01 g catalyst min/g organic, including experiments with no catalyst (W/m org = 0) in order to compare the catalyst activity with the non-catalytic reforming that could occur. In the non-catalytic experiment, the reaction bed was only constituted of sand, which can be considered as inert filler. The overall results of yields, gas composition and carbon conversion to gas obtained during the two hours of reaction are shown in Table 3 . These results indicate that the non-catalytic reforming of the aqueous fraction is low at 650 °C, despite a carbon conversion to gas of 30%. If the individual results of composition and yields of various gases are analysed, it can be seen that most of the converted carbon from the feed leads to the formation of CO, although significant amounts of CO2 are produced along with some minor amounts of CH4 and C2. The use of the catalyst significantly affects the results both in the conversion of carbon to gas, which increases significantly as expected, and the product gas distribution, increasing the amounts of H2 and CO2 produced while significantly reducing the CO, CH4 and C2. These effects are more marked with increasing W/m org ratios, reducing the secondary products such as CH4 and C2 to negligible amounts. These results are similar to those obtained by other authors [25] when analysing the effect of the W/m org ratio, despite using a catalyst without Ni as the active metal. The average gas composition obtained in the catalytic reforming is similar with regard to the three main components (CO, H2 and CO2) in all four cases studied, with the trend already indicated of reduced CO production and the virtual disappearance of by-products with increasing W/m org ratios. Although the carbon conversion to gas increases when the amount of catalyst is increased, as expected, it does not reach 100%, even for the highest W/m org ratio tested, 5.01 g catalyst min/g organic, unlike the behaviour shown in the case of the synthetic aqueous fraction or the previously mentioned model compounds studied in previous papers [14,19]. The time evolution of the yields to H2 and CO, and the carbon conversion to gas, is shown in Figs. 4–6 , respectively, for the different W/m org ratios tested, along with the theoretical values predicted assuming 100% conversion of carbon fed and thermodynamic equilibrium. As shown in Figs. 4 and 6, the production of H2 and carbon conversion to gas undergo a decrease in time for W/m org ratios under 5.01 g catalyst min/g organic, while CO (Fig. 5) shows the opposite tendency, increasing its production over time. This fact can be as consequence of less activity of the catalyst in WGS reaction, especially with increasing reaction time. It should be noted that the evolution with time in the production of CO2 follows the same tendency as that of H2, i.e. it decreases with time, and it is thus not depicted. At the same time, the by-products, CH4 and C2, show the opposite tendency, similar to that observed for the CO, increasing over time. Their production can be attributed to the thermal cracking of complex organic molecules [37] and the decreasing reforming activity of the catalyst. These tendencies found for low values of the W/m org ratio (high values of GC1HSV) have also been observed in the catalytic steam reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil at 825 °C [28]. Despite the stable performance over time of the catalyst used in the experiment with the highest ratio, W/m org = 5.01 g catalyst min/g organic, especially during the first 50 min of reaction, the values of H2, CO and CO2 do not reach the predicted equilibrium values at any moment. Similarly, no complete carbon conversion to gas is reached, even at the highest W/m org ratio studied, which can be explained by the thermal decomposition of organic compounds of the feed, forming carbonaceous deposits over the catalyst bed that are not reformed. To eliminate this effect in the study of the catalyst performance, and in order to check its actual activity in the reforming reactions, the product gas composition obtained in the experiment with a W/m org ratio equal to 5.01 g catalyst min/g organic (H2 = 68.7%, CO = 3.8% and CO2 = 27.5%, water and nitrogen free basis) has been input in the simulation software package to predict the product gas composition at equilibrium conditions. The comparison of the experimental and predicted values revealed that the product gas composition was indeed at equilibrium conditions. As said, the predicted theoretical results at equilibrium match the experimental results. Thus, neglecting experimental errors, it can be concluded that the activity of the catalyst working at 650 °C and with a W/m org ratio of 5.01 g catalyst min/g organic is sufficiently high for reforming compounds of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil that come into contact with the bed and for reaching equilibrium conditions in the gas phase. The initial values of carbon conversion to gas, similar for all the catalytic reforming experiments regardless of the W/m org ratio used, and the gradual decay in the catalytic conversion over time with W/m org ratios lower than 5.01 g catalyst min/g organic, are the result of the deactivation of the catalyst. This deactivation is also responsible for the evolution of gas production over time, comprising the reduction of H2 and CO2, the increase in the yield to CO, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in CH4 and C2. This behaviour suggests a series process in which the thermal decomposition is firstly produced (6), followed by the reforming of organic compounds (1 and 2) with the appearance of relatively large amounts of CO and H2, and by-products such as C2 and CH4. Later, the reforming reactions of the by-products would take place on the catalyst (methane steam reforming, 4), increasing the production of H2 and, simultaneously, the catalyst would favour the WGS reaction (3), increasing the production of H2 to a greater extent, and lowering the CO content, while almost completely reforming the by-products. As the process evolves, these reactions would cause the deactivation of the catalyst, presumably by deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. This was observed in an earlier work by our group [16] on the steam reforming of acetic acid, in which the spent catalyst was characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), showing several peaks of oxidation for coke, which could indicate both encapsulating coke deposited over the support and coke in the form of filaments deposited over the active metal-support interface. The encapsulating coke would prevent the adsorption of H2O or even CO and thus the equilibrium of WGS and the reforming of the by-products, favouring the production of CO and CH4 from the coke deposited via the Boudouard reaction (5) and the gasification of the coke (7 and 8). Hence, the generation of hydrogen would be reduced with the reaction time upon the progressive deactivation of the catalyst. As far as carbon oxides are concerned, the production of CO against CO2 would be favoured, while the by-products would not undergo the reforming process, in agreement with what has been experimentally observed. To sum up, the catalyst exerts a decisive influence on the reactions involving steam, favouring the adsorption of organics and water and their subsequent reaction. The idea of a bifunctional mechanism in which the support fixes water molecules and the organics are attached to the active metal may explain these observations, in agreement with conclusions appearing in the literature [13,24]. 3.2.2 Effect of the Ni content In our previous studies, the Ni content had been proven to have an effect in the catalytic reforming of the model compounds studied [14,19]. Therefore, its influence has also been investigated in the catalytic reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil at 650 °C, for a W/m org ratio of 1.67 g catalyst min/g organic, working with the 23%, 28% and 33% Ni catalysts. The overall results of these experiments after two hours of reforming are shown in Table 4 . As observed with the model compounds, the best results in terms of conversion and production of H2 are obtained with the 28% Ni catalyst. Similarly, the yield to CO2, associated with the production of H2 through the WGS reaction, occurs in greater quantities than for the other catalysts, while both the CO and the C2 and CH4 are yielded to a lesser extent with this catalyst, especially in the case of CH4 which occurs in negligible amounts. If the evolution over time of the production of various compounds is analysed, the behaviour in terms of initial activity is similar in terms of H2, CO2 and CO yields for the three catalysts, as shown, for example, in the evolution of the hydrogen yield with time in Fig. 7 . The differences are more evident for the CH4 by-product, as shown in Fig. 8 , and for C2. Despite a similar initial activity for the three catalysts in terms of hydrogen production, all three show a progressive deactivation, being more pronounced in the case of the catalyst with the highest nickel content, as can also be seen in Fig. 7. This fact again suggests a correlation between deactivation and the production of CH4 [37]. The results from hydrogen chemisorption (section 2.3) show that the Ni surface area increases with increasing Ni content. On the other hand, the XRD analyses of the calcined precursors [14] confirmed that the proportion of NiO to spinel NiAl2O4 increased with increasing Ni content. Hence, it could be concluded that, despite having more Ni surface area in the 33% Ni catalyst, this is less dispersed and less stable. This fact could explain the results observed. Fresh and used catalysts samples used under typical condition have formerly been characterized in previous works of our group [14,17,30] by different techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). In these works, it could be established the relationship between structure and properties of the 23, 28 and 33% Ni catalysts and their corresponding deactivation. It could be concluded that filamentous carbon was deposited on the catalyst surface, and its morphology varied with the Ni content in the samples. Thicker and longer filaments were found for the 33% Ni catalyst compared to the others, and the XRD analyses of the used samples revealed the presence of a Ni phase and a significant diminution of the NiO and NiAl2O4 phases in all the samples compared to the XRD analyses of the fresh samples. Particularly, the NiO crystalline phase was not detected in the used samples. In addition, the TPO analysis of the 28% Ni catalyst used in the catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil aqueous fraction revealed the deposition of different types of coke on the catalyst surface, which could be ascribed to coke deposited on the support, coke formed on the metal-support interface, and filamentous carbon. 3.2.3 Effect of the reaction temperature The temperature at which the reforming reaction takes place has a great influence on the reaction products. A higher reaction temperature, as expected, increases the activity and thus the kinetics of the different reactions, including the elimination of coke that can be deposited on the surface of the catalyst. However, it also affects the thermodynamic equilibrium, which in the case of exothermic reactions such as the WGS reaction, results in a diminished production of hydrogen. Therefore, the optimal solution is to find a reaction temperature as low as possible, while maintaining high levels of catalyst activity. The effect of temperature was studied in the range between 600 and 800 °C, with the 28% Ni catalyst, 2 h of reaction time and a W/m org ratio equal to 1.67 g catalyst min/g organic. The overall results obtained at the five temperatures studied are shown in Table 5 . It can be noted that the carbon conversion to gas, despite increasing with increased reaction temperatures, does not surpass a value of 84%, becoming stagnated at the highest temperatures studied. It is also observed that the production of H2 and CO2 reach a maximum at 750 °C (0.101 g H2/g organic and 0.742 g CO2/g organic), while the CO steadily increases with temperature, similar to CH4 but less conclusive for C2 due to its low production. In terms of product gas composition, there is a progressive impoverishment of the gas in H2 and CO2 at the expense of a progressive increase in the percentage of CO, CH4 and C2. This effect might be due to the displacement of the equilibrium of the WGS reaction at high temperatures towards the production CO and H2O, because of its exothermicity. However, changes over time in the production of various compounds (H2, CO2, CO and CH4) and in the carbon conversion to gas, as shown in Figs. 9–13 , respectively, suggest different conclusions. The evolution of carbon conversion to gas (Fig. 13) is stable for nearly 2 h of reaction at temperatures over 700 °C. At temperatures below 700 °C, the carbon conversion to gas shows a decay with time, much more pronounced with decreasing temperatures, indicating catalyst deactivation. The fact that the carbon conversion to gas, despite being stable at high temperatures, does not surpass 85% means that about 15–20% of the carbon fed from the aqueous fraction is converted either to liquid or solid products, which is consistent with the carbonaceous deposits found in the reactor above the catalyst bed. Although the carbon conversion to gas is stable over time at high temperatures during 2 h of reaction, this does not imply that the catalyst is not affected by a deactivation process, since the production of the individual product gases changes over time. During the initial reaction period, approximately the first 20 min, the production of gases is very similar for all the temperatures studied. From that initial moment, the yields of the different products evolve much faster with lower temperatures, and proceed in a coordinated manner. Thus, the production of CO2 and H2, again undergo a decrease with time for all the temperatures studied, a reduction which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. This effect is less noticeable as the temperature is increased up to 750 °C where it reaches a maximum, becoming lower again at 800 °C. On the other hand, the CO, CH4 and C2, experience a virtually opposite tendency, i.e. continued growth in production over time, being more pronounced the higher the temperature. These results can be explained by a series reaction mechanism, as mentioned above, in which the reforming and thermal decomposition of organic compounds of the aqueous fraction would occur in first place, producing a mixture of CO, H2 and CO2 as well as significant amounts of by-products such as CH4, C2 and coke, by-products that would be subjected to reforming processes and thus disappear from the reaction mixture. The CO content would be reduced and the H2 and CO2 content increased through processes such as the WGS reaction. As the reaction proceeds, the catalyst becomes deactivated as the result of coke deposition and thus the rate of the reforming reaction of the by-products is reduced, as well as the WGS reaction, both reactions involving steam. The evolution of product gases with time at 800 °C could be explained as a consequence of homogeneous thermal decomposition reactions of oxygenates. The decomposition of some of the organic vapours in the feed would lead to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and could affect the product gas composition. Some of these reactions are endothermic [38,39] and thus they are favoured with increasing temperatures. Carbon deposits on the catalyst surface are probably the main cause of catalyst deactivation. In previous works we have characterized coke by TPO [17,30]. Average carbon-deposition rates of around 1.5 mg C/g catalyst min have been found in steam reforming of acetic acid (W/m = 1.00 g catalyst min/g acetic acid, fixed bed, 120 min of reaction time) [17] and also in steam reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil (W/m = 4.1 g catalyst min/g organics, fluidized bed, 120 min of reaction time) [30]."
9,Conclusions,"The production of hydrogen via catalytic steam reforming of a synthetic and a real aqueous fraction of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis liquids has been studied in this work. Although the catalytic steam reforming of a synthetic aqueous fraction of bio-oil presents some similarities in terms of behaviour with a real aqueous fraction, some differences between the two can be appreciated, most notably the difficulty of achieving full carbon conversion to gas when using the real aqueous fraction, even in the most favourable conditions of catalyst load and high temperature, due to the thermal decomposition of the different bio-oil compounds that form carbonaceous deposits on the catalytic bed. The catalysts have a remarkable activity in the reforming of the aqueous fraction compared to non-catalytic reforming, significantly increasing the hydrogen content in the gas obtained, even at low reaction temperatures. The catalyst has an optimum Ni content of around 28%, both in terms of maximizing the carbon conversion to gas and in terms of hydrogen production, as observed in our previous works with model compounds. The reforming temperature influences both the production of gases and their composition, being favoured at higher temperatures, to a maximum production of hydrogen at around 700 °C and decreasing again at temperatures of around 800 °C. The catalyst undergoes a process of deactivation with reaction time, presumably due to deposition of coke on the surface, which is reflected both in terms of carbon conversion to gas and in terms of the production and composition of gases, even at reforming temperatures as high as 800 °C. The variation in gas production, in which the H2 and CO2 are the main products at the beginning of the reforming process while the catalyst maintains its activity, and the reduction of these compounds at the expense of a greater selectivity to other carbon species, CO, CH4 and C2, indicate a mechanism in series in which initially the catalyst would favour the decomposition and reforming of the organic compounds present in the aqueous fraction, and then the same catalyst would promote the formation of more H2 through the reforming of intermediate products and the acceleration of the WGS reaction. As the deactivation of the active sites of the catalyst occurs, their capacity to adsorb H2O is diminished, restraining steam from reacting with the organic compounds and thus decreasing the production of H2."
