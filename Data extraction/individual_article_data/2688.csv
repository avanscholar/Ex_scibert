0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is being projected as the most promising alternative to fossil fuels since it combusts cleanly without CO2 emission and can be efficiently converted to electricity via fuel cell technology (Levin et al., 2004). Furthermore, hydrogen has a high gravimetric energy density of 122kJ/g, which is 2.72 times greater than that of gasoline (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006; Levin et al., 2004). Biological production of hydrogen is considered the most environmentally friendly route because the biological hydrogen production processes mostly operate at ambient temperatures and pressures. In particular, these processes can use a variety of organic substrates as carbon sources (Manish and Banerjee, 2008) so that they offer a dual function of waste reduction and hydrogen energy production (Chen and Chang, 2006). Hydrogen can be produced biologically from dark fermentation of carbohydrate rich wastes and photo-fermentation of organic acid rich wastewaters. The photo-fermentation process is frequently used to produce hydrogen because of the high purity hydrogen produced, high theoretical substrate conversion efficiency, relatively small quantity of byproducts and no O2-evolving activity which causes O2 inactivation in green algae hydrogen production systems (Fascetti et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2002; Shi and Yu, 2005). In addition, the light absorption spectrum of 400–950nm for photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) is wider than that of 400–700nm for green algae (Akkerman et al., 2002). Specifically, PSB can produce hydrogen from the mineralization of organic acids such as acetic acid and butyric acid, which are predominant metabolites from dark fermentation in the hydrogen production processes (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). However, the economic feasibility of photo-fermentation hydrogen production appears to be limited by the low hydrogen production rate of PSB, which is primarily attributed to low cell growth rate and inefficient light energy utilization (Chen et al., 2006a; Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Zhu et al., 1999). In addition, compared to microalgae, PSB has a low photochemical efficiency because it requires extra energy in the form of ATP (Akkerman et al., 2002). Thus, current research on phototrophic hydrogen production focuses on improving the hydrogen production rate and light conversion efficiency of photobioreactors. The former could be achieved by increasing biomass retention per unit volume of the reactor and the latter is mainly affected by the structure of the photo-hydrogen bioreactor and the light source applied (Chen et al., 2006a; Wakayama and Miyake, 2002). Generally, the immobilization processes of hydrogen-producing cultures should be an effective approach to increase biomass retention in bioreactors (Tian et al., 2009). Recent studies on immobilized-cell dark fermentation hydrogen production showed that high unit volumetric production rates were found in immobilized-cell anaerobic hydrogen production systems as a consequence of the increased biomass retention (Zhang et al., 2008). The hydrogen production rate of these immobilized-cell systems achieved a peak value of 6.6l/l/h in a granular reactor (Zhang et al., 2008), 7.3l/l/h in a self-flocculated anaerobic granular reactor (Lee et al., 2004) and 1.01l/l/h in a thermal trickling biofilter (Oh et al., 2004a). Overall, these immobilization technologies are mainly based on the granulation process or biofilm attachment process (Kim et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008) and are also the most popular techniques for hydrogen production because of their increased biomass retention compared to suspended-cell systems (Chang and Lin, 2004; Wu et al., 2006). They also have an improved tolerance to inhibitors (Bagai and Madamwar, 1998; Kumar and Das, 2001). Unfortunately, only a few studies have addressed the application of immobilized cell technologies for photo-hydrogen production. Several PSB immobilization cell processes have been developed for cell stabilization and enhancement of the photo-hydrogen production rate. Francou and Vignais (1984) entrapped the cells of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata in carrageenan beads to steadily evolve hydrogen over a 16-day period. Zhu et al. (1999) reported that the entrapment of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in cationic polyelectrolytes inhibited NH4 + and improved photo-hydrogen production. Fiβler et al. (1995) used immobilized Rhodopseudomonas palustris cells in polymeric materials to improve photo-hydrogen production. In our previous report, we immobilized R. palustris in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-boric acid gel granule to improve the photo-hydrogen production rate. Results showed that the PVA-PSB gel granule facilitates mass transport as it is transparent and has an adequate porous structure, which significantly enhances the photo-hydrogen production rate (Tian et al., 2009). However, granulation immobilization is difficult to scale up because of substrate and product diffusion limitations (Tsygankov et al., 1994). In addition, the dense packing of immobilized PSB granules limits light penetration, which has an adverse effect on light conversion efficiency. Therefore, for the photo-hydrogen fermentation system, surface attachment seems to be a more reasonable cell immobilization approach than cell entrapment. This is because the efficiency of light energy utilization is crucial in the design of the photo-hydrogen fermentation bioreactor (Chen and Chang, 2006; Tsygankov et al., 1993, 1994). In this work, PSB cell immobilization was achieved by the formation of a biofilm on the surface of the transparent packed materials in a photobioreactor. The main objective of this research was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a biofilm-based photobioreactor and improve the phototrophic hydrogen production rate and light conversion efficiency. The characteristics with respect to photo-hydrogen production in the biofilm-based photobioreactor were investigated by varying light wavelength, light illumination intensity, temperature, pH value and substrate concentration at a consistent hydraulic retention time (HRT)."
1,Methods,
2,Inoculum and substrate,"2.1 Inoculum and substrate An indigenous photosynthetic bacterium designated R. palustris CQK 01 was isolated from local municipal sewage sludge and was used for phototrophic hydrogen production. The photosynthetic bacterium grew in a synthetic medium consisting of (in g/l) K2HPO4·3H2O 1.0060; KH2PO4 0.5440; MgSO4·7H2O 0.4000; FeSO4·7H2O 0.0018; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O 0.0010; ZnSO4·7H2O 0.0024; NaCl 0.2000; CaCl2 0.0200; CO(NH2)2 1.5000 and yeast extract 0.4000. For pre-culture, the carbon source was a glucose solution with an initial concentration of 4.024g/l. Cells were cultivated anaerobically at 30°C for 96h under illumination from a light-emitting diode (LED) emitting at 590nm, and the illumination intensity was approximately 4000lux. Argon was used to create anaerobic conditions. The initial pH value of the medium before incubation was adjusted to 7.1 using 0.1M NaOH. Enriched photosynthetic bacteria were initially used as inoculum for start-up of the BPBR."
3,Operation and start-up of the BPBR,"2.2 Operation and start-up of the BPBR Schematic details of the experimental setup are depicted in Fig. 1 . The experimental system consisted of a biofilm photobioreactor (BPBR), a light source, a tube heat exchanger, a constant-temperature bath, a peristaltic pump, a substrate medium flask, a liquid effluent flask and a gas collector. The vertically oriented BPBR was made of a rectangular polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) vessel with a total volume of 100×40×300mm3. The external light source was mounted at one side of the BPBR. Three series of single-wavelength LED lamps, which can emit at 630, 590, and 470nm, respectively, were chosen as light sources and the illumination intensities were adjusted from 3000 to 8000lux by varying the distance between the LED and BPBR. The BPBR was packed with spherical glass beads (4±0.5mm in diameter) resulting in a bed porosity of 35%. These glass beads offered hydrophilic surfaces as the support for PSB cell attachment. The height of the glass beads packed bed was 250mm and the vessel had four sampling ports located at 85, 150, 215 and 280mm above the bioreactor’s bottom. These ports were used to extract liquid and packed material samples from the reactor. A tube-shell heat exchanger connected to a constant-temperature bath was installed to keep the influent medium at a desired temperature from 10 to 50°C. The glucose-based synthetic wastewater that had same composition as the nutrient medium, described in Section 2.1, was used as a substrate for photo-hydrogen production in the BPBR. The synthetic wastewater continuously passed through the packed bed from the bottom of the BPBR using a peristaltic pump at a volumetric flow rate of 100ml/h. The BPBR was operated in two stages. The first stage was the start-up of the bioreactor which lasted 60days. The start-up was undertaken to achieve PSB cell immobilization by the formation of a biofilm and also achieve steady hydrogen production from the bioreactor. Prior to the start-up, the alkali-washed packed glass beads were sterilized by autoclaving. The BPBR was washed with 70% ethanol solution for 15min and then washed thoroughly with deionized water. Sterile silicon hoses were used to connect the BPBR with the medium flask and liquid effluent flask. The synthetic wastewater was then inoculated with the enriched photosynthetic bacteria. In the start-up stage, the medium passed through the bioreactor and returned to the wastewater flask from the liquid effluent flask in order to avoid the loss of activated PSB cells in the circulated liquid phase. Synthetic wastewater (150ml) was replenished with fresh nutrient medium every day. The second stage was conducted by keeping the flow rate of synthetic waste water at 100ml/h (HRT=3.5h). The BPBR was illuminated by the LED lamps emitting at the required wavelength with illumination intensities of 3000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000 and 8000lux. Influent glucose concentrations were set as 0.06, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14 and 0.18M. Different influent liquid temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35°C were chosen to investigate the effect of temperature on BPBR hydrogen production performance. Quasi-steady-state conditions for each temperature level were obtained when the hydrogen production and glucose conversion rate were relatively consistent to within 10% for 24h. Evaluation of the BPBR performance was carried out during these quasi-steady-state conditions. The performance assessment for the BPBR included the hydrogen production rate, glucose removal rate and hydrogen yield. Definitions of these parameters are: (1) H 2 production rate = Cumulative H 2 production (mmol) H 2 evolution time (h) × working volume(l) (2) Glucose removal rate = Q l × ( C s,in - C s,out ) V b where Q l is the liquid flow rate (l/h), C s,in and C s,out is the glucose concentration at the inlet and outlet of the bioreactor (mmol/l), respectively, and V b is the working volume of bioreactor (l). (3) H 2 yield = Amount of H 2 produced (mol) Amount of substrate (glucose) consumed (mol) The light conversion efficiency was defined as the efficiency by which the light energy was transformed into hydrogen energy. The light conversion efficiency was calculated according to Eq. (4) (Miyake and Kawamura, 1987; Chen and Chang, 2006) as below: (4) Light conversion efficiency = H 2 output × H 2 energy content light energy input × 100 = 33.61 ρ H 2 V H 2 IAt × 100 where V H 2 is the volume of hydrogen produced (l), ρ H 2 is the density of hydrogen produced (g/l), I the light intensity (W/m2), A the irradiated area (m2), and t is the duration of hydrogen production (h). The size of the packed bed was known and the irradiation area of the BPBR was calculated as follows: A = L × h = 0.1 × 0.25 = 0.025 m 2 , where L and h are the width and height of the packed bed (m), respectively. Except the illuminated surface, other surfaces of the BPBR were covered by aluminum foil."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The composition of biogas was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m porous polymer beads packed column. Argon was used as the carrier gas for the GC with a flow rate of 25ml/min. The temperatures of the GC oven and TCD were maintained at 55 and 100°C, respectively. The electric current of the TCD was 80mA. The concentration of glucose was also analyzed using the gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Samples were injected into a 20m long capillary column with an internal diameter of 0.25mm. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 7ml/min. The temperature of the injector and detector was set to 270°C. The oven temperature was set to 210°C. Liquid samples were centrifuged at a rate of 6000r/min for 10min and then a 1μl sample was injected into the GC for analysis. For determination of the R. palustris CQK 01 absorption spectrum, an overnight culture of R. palustris CQK 01 was mixed with sucrose at a weight-to-volume ratio of 5gsucrose/3.5ml cell suspension. The mixture of cells and sucrose was subjected to a spectrum scan (from 315 to 900nm) using a spectrophotometer against a blank solution of 5g sucrose in 3.5ml deionized water. The illumination intensity was measured with a digital luxmeter and the light intensity was measured using a FZ-A Light Radiometer that measured in units of W/m2. The pH value was measured using a pH meter that was calibrated with buffers (pH of 4.0 and 7.0) as supplied by the manufacturer. The rotation speed of the peristaltic pump was converted to the flow rate of the medium via a proper calibration and 1r/min was approximately 16ml/h."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of influent substrate concentration under different illumination wavelengths,"3.1 Effect of influent substrate concentration under different illumination wavelengths The illumination wavelength of the light source plays a crucial role in influencing the hydrogen production of the PSB since each type of PSB preferably absorbs light energy within certain wavelength ranges (Chen et al., 2006b). In this work, the absorbance spectrum of R. palustris CQK 01 was determined first (Fig. 2 ). Absorption maxima at 590, 806 and 863nm are due to bacteriochlorophyll α and maxima at 319 and 379nm are due to its carotenoid content (Uyar et al., 2007). Since the photosynthesis does show different utilization efficiencies for the lights with different wavelengths, monochromatic LED lights were chosen as external light source in the present study to obtain the better insight of the effect of illumination wavelength on photo-hydrogen fermentation of the BPBR. The photo-hydrogen production of the BPBR under different illumination wavelengths (630, 590 and 470nm) but same illumination intensity of 5000lux was undertaken. During these experiments the substrate solution containing different glucose concentrations of 0.06, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14 and 0.18M was fed into the BPBR while the flow rate and temperature were maintained at 100ml/h and 25°C, respectively. The pH value of influent medium was kept as 7.0. Fig. 3 illustrates the hydrogen production characteristics of the BPBR illuminated at different wavelengths including (a) hydrogen production rate (mmol/l/h), (b) substrate removal rate (mmol/l/h) and (c) hydrogen yield (mol-H2/mol-glucose). Data of the hydrogen production rate as shown in Fig. 3a indicates that the BPBR illuminated at 590nm exhibited the best hydrogen production performance for the influent glucose concentration ranging from 0.06 to 0.18M, followed by those illuminated at 630 and 470nm, respectively. The photo-hydrogen production rate of the BPBR illuminated at 470nm is the lowest. This is because no major pigment absorbs light at 470nm and photosynthesis of R. palustris CQK-1 utilizes radiant energy of light wavelength at 470nm with low efficiency. On the other hand, light scattering and extinction at 470nm is stronger than that at 590 and 630nm. From Fig. 3b it is obvious that using the LEDs emitting at 590 and 630nm as light sources resulted in similar glucose removal rates in the entire range of the influent substrate concentration. The glucose removal rate of the BPBR that was illuminated at 470nm was distinctly lower than those at 590 and 630nm. However, we also noticed from Fig. 3c that the effect of light wavelength on the hydrogen yield of the BPBR was almost negligible. These results indicate that the lowest photo-hydrogen production rate could be attributed to inefficient substrate removal when the BPBR was illuminated at 470nm. In addition, R. palustris CQK 01 which was used in this work preferably absorbs light at 590nm for the stimulation of photo-hydrogen production. This is why the most efficient hydrogen production was obtained when the LEDs emitting at 590nm was used as the light source. The sort and concentration of carbon source are known to be critical factors affecting the fermentation kinetics of biohydrogen production (Chen et al., 2006a; Fang et al., 2005). In Fig. 3a, the hydrogen production rate of the BPBR increased with increasing influent glucose concentration from 0.06 to 0.12M under illumination at 470, 590 and 630nm. The hydrogen production rate significantly decreased when the influent glucose concentration further increased to 0.18M. The maximum hydrogen production rates for different wavelengths were obtained at a glucose concentration of 0.12M and were 1.74, 1.69 and 1.16mmol/l/h for illumination at 590, 630, and 470nm, respectively. Fig. 3b indicates that the glucose removal rate increased with increasing glucose concentration from 0.06 to 0.12M under 590 and 630nm illuminations, respectively, while decreased when the influent glucose concentration increased to 0.18M. For illumination at 470nm, the maximum glucose removal rate of the BPBR was obtained at 0.14M influent glucose concentration. This can be expected that the metabolic capacity of the microorganisms in the BPBR is sufficient to eliminate glucose when the influent glucose concentration is low, hence resulting in an increased hydrogen production rate with an increase in the glucose concentration. However, a further increase in the glucose concentration, beyond the threshold value, leads to the onset of substrate inhibition and then the hydrogen production rate decreases. The results show that the optimal glucose concentration for the highest hydrogen production rate of the BPBR was 0.12M while substrate inhibition occurred when the glucose concentration exceeded the threshold value. Fig. 3c shows that the hydrogen yield gradually decreased as the influent glucose concentration increased from 0.06 to 0.18M for all light wavelengths. This indicates that the efficiency of the PSB utilizing these substrates for hydrogen production decreases as the influent substrate concentration increases although increasing hydrogen production rate were observed in low substrate concentration."
7,Effect of illumination intensity,"3.2 Effect of illumination intensity Illumination intensity is a key factor that affects photo-hydrogen production and light conversion efficiency of the photo-hydrogen production bioreactors (Uyar et al., 2007). It has been reported that an increase in the light intensity stimulates the photo-hydrogen yield and production rate but has an negative effect on the light conversion efficiency (Barbosa et al., 2001; Shi and Yu, 2005; Wakayama and Miyake, 2002). Sasikala et al. (1991) reported that photo-hydrogen production was saturated at around 5000lux. Akkerman et al. (2002) reported that reasonable light conversion efficiencies were obtained at low light intensity (26–35% at 13W/m2) but that associated hydrogen production rates were too low to be used from a practical point of view. In this study, we performed experiments to obtain a better insight about the effect of illumination intensity on the hydrogen production rate and light conversion efficiency of the BPBR that was illuminated by light sources with different wavelengths (470, 590 and 630nm). In the experiments, the influent glucose concentration was 0.12M. The flow rate of the synthetic waste water was 100ml/h, the pH value was 7 and the temperature 25°C. The BPBR was exposed to six illumination intensities between 3000 and 8000lux. The results illustrated in Fig. 4 a show that the illumination intensity had a significant effect on the hydrogen production rate of the BPBR at a specific medium flow rate and carbon source concentration. The hydrogen production rate increased with an increase in the illumination intensity whereas it decreased as the illumination intensity exceeded a threshold level. Within the given illumination intensity range (3000–8000lux), the hydrogen production rates of the BPBR were similar when 590 and 630nm LED lamps were used as external light sources. An increase in the illumination intensity from 3000 to 5000lux could improve the hydrogen production rate up to maximum values of 1.74 and 1.69mmol/l/h for 590 and 630nm, respectively. Photoinhibition occurred when the illumination intensity exceeded 5000lux. A further increase in the illumination intensity of up to 8000lux resulted in the hydrogen production rate decreasing sharply to 1.12 and 1.16mmol/l/h for 590 and 630nm, respectively. Using the 470nm LED as a single light source resulted in hydrogen production being saturated at 6000lux and the maximum hydrogen production rate was 1.28mmol/l/h. Besides the hydrogen production rate, the light conversion efficiency is also an important parameter that is used to evaluate the hydrogen production process of photobioreactors (Akkerman et al., 2002). The data in Fig. 4b illustrates the effect of illumination intensity on the light conversion efficiency of the BPBR illuminated at different wavelengths. The light conversion efficiency was stimulated by 3000–5000lux of illumination intensity and was suppressed by 6000–8000lux of illumination intensity when the BPBR was illuminated at 590 and 630nm. At an illumination intensity of 5000lux, the light conversion efficiencies of the BPBR reached maximum values of 56% and 19.3% for 590 and 630nm, respectively. However, when the BPBR was illuminated at 470nm, the light conversion efficiency decreased appreciably upon an increase in the illumination intensity from 3000 to 8000lux. Furthermore, the BPBR illuminated at 590nm had much higher light conversion efficiency than those illuminated at 630 and 470nm. The BPBR that was illuminated at 590nm had the highest light conversion efficiency of 56%, which is appreciably higher than most of the light conversion efficiencies that have been reported in literature (Akkerman et al., 2002; Barbosa et al., 2001; Shi and Yu, 2005). The BPBR illuminated at 630nm showed a maximum light conversion efficiency of 19% at illumination intensity of 5000lux while that for 470nm was 5.8% at 3000lux. We attributed this result to the following three reasons: first, the input energy from other inactive absorption wavelengths of the sunlight could be avoided when the monochromatic LED light is used as the light source; secondly, energy loss due to radiation energy converting to heat could be neglected since the LED light is luminescent; thirdly, a major absorption band for bacteriochlorophylls of R. palustris CQK 01 is at 590nm light wavelength. In addition, it should be noted that the input energy from the substrate and biomass were neglected in calculation of the light conversion efficiency. It is known that bacteriochlorophyll is the primary machinery for ATP synthesis in photosynthetic bacteria (Verméglio and Joliot, 1999). Thus the experimental results indicate that a light source being compatible with the absorption maxima of R. palustris CQK 01 can ensure the excitation of the bacteriochlorophyll for efficient photo-hydrogen production and prevent wasting light energy as well."
8,Effect of temperature of influent substrate solution,"3.3 Effect of temperature of influent substrate solution It is well known that the activity of microorganisms is very sensitive to temperature. In this work, an experiment was performed to find the optimum temperature of the influent substrate solution for the maximum photo-hydrogen production rate of the BPBR. The temperature in the bioreactor was controlled by regulating the temperature of the influent synthetic wastewater and the later was adjusted by a constant-temperature bath and an electric heater. This method ensured that the temperature of the influent liquid can be controlled from 10 to 50°C. In the experiment, the influent glucose concentration was 0.12M. The LED light wavelength was 590nm and the illumination intensity was 5000lux. The flow rate and pH value of the influent medium were 100ml/h and 7, respectively. From Fig. 5 , the temperature of the influent medium was shown to be critical to the photo-hydrogen production rate of the BPBR. As the temperature of the influent medium increased from 15 to 25°C, the hydrogen production rate increased from 1.17mmol/l/h to a peak value of 1.77mmol/l/h whereas a further increase in the temperature to 35°C resulted in the hydrogen production rate of the BPBR decreasing to 1.39mmol/l/h."
9,Effect of pH value of influent substrate solution,"3.4 Effect of pH value of influent substrate solution The effect of the pH value of the influent synthetic waste water was also investigated experimentally in this work. In the experiment, the LED emitting at 590nm was used as the sole light source. The illumination intensity was 5000lux. The influent glucose concentration was 0.12M, the flow rate was 100ml/h and temperature was 25°C. Fig. 6 illustrates the hydrogen production rate for the BPBR at pH 4.0–9.0. Results show that little hydrogen was produced at pH 4.0 and 9.0. Accordingly, the hydrogen production rate of the BPBR was only 0.69 and 0.84mmol/l/h for the influent synthetic waste water pH at 4 and 9, respectively. When the influent glucose concentration was 0.12M, the optimal pH for hydrogen production was 7.0 with a maximum hydrogen production rate of 1.77mmol/l/h. At pH 7–8, the BPBR produced considerably higher amounts of hydrogen and reached higher hydrogen production rates (1.69–1.77mmol/l/h). The optimal pH of 7.0 found in this study is comparable to the pH 6.8 reported for Rhodobacter sphaeroides O.U. 001 (Sasikala et al., 1995) and pH 7.0–8.0 for Rhodobacter capsulatus in batch experiments (Fang et al., 2005), but it is lower than the pH 8.5 reported by Li et al. (2008)."
10,Overall evaluation of the BPBR for photo-hydrogen production,"3.5 Overall evaluation of the BPBR for photo-hydrogen production Although a few studies have focused on the photo-hydrogen production process (Chen et al., 2006a,b; Fang et al., 2005; Oh et al., 2004b; Uyar et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008), a comparison of our experimental results with those found in literature is not straightforward because of different operation conditions used such as the light sources, illumination intensities, carbon sources, culture sorts, substrate concentrations, etc. In addition, some quantitative results are limited and not clearly indicated in the literature. Thus, the photo-hydrogen production performance of the BPBR may just be evaluated against comparable studies. In this work, the highest light conversion efficiency of 56% was obtained when the influent glucose concentration was 0.12M, the light source was the 590nm wavelength LED and the illumination intensity was 5000lux. This light conversion efficiency appears to be much higher than all the published values currently known to the authors (see Table 1 ). The aforementioned optimal operation conditions also give a maximum hydrogen production rate of 1.74mmol/l/h (volumetric hydrogen production rate of 38.9ml/l/h), which is also superior to the most reported values as indicated in Table 1. The hydrogen yield of 0.2molH2/molglucose obtained in this study was relatively low under the aforementioned operation conditions. This low yield is probably due to glucose being used as the sole carbon source while photosynthetic bacteria prefer organic acids as carbon sources that have been used in other studies (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). The excellent hydrogen production rate and light conversion efficiency values obtained in this study indicate that the BPBR developed in this study is promising."
11,Conclusions,"The photosynthetic bacterium R. palustris CQK 01 was immobilized by a biofilm formation process onto surface of transparent glass beads packed in a photobioreactor, which significantly increased the photo-hydrogen production performance. The light wavelength and illumination intensity significantly affected the photo-hydrogen production rate and glucose removal rate, while the light wavelength almost had no effect on the hydrogen yield. The BPBR illuminated at 590nm and 5000lux showed the best performance: 38.9ml/l/h hydrogen production rate, 56% light conversion efficiency, when it operated at glucose concentration 0.12M, optimal pH 7 and temperature of influent liquid 25°C."
