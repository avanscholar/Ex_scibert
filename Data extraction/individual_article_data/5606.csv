0,Introduction,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), as secondary messengers, are involved in the regulation of pathological and physiological processes [1]. Normally, low concentrations of ROS are necessary for cell growth, survival, and signaling. However, excessive ROS induce oxidative stress and cause subsequent oxidative damage of proteins, lipids and DNA [2]. ROS can be produced by many enzymatic reactions in cytoplasm, cell membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomes and mitochondria as well NADPH oxidases, the specialized enzymes that produce ROS [3]. Mitochondrial respiration relies on electron transfer and proton gradients to drive ATP production [3]. Superoxide anion radical (•O2 −) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are commonly known as the byproducts of this process [4]. More importantly, H2O2 produced in mitochondria can be released into the cytosol via aquaporin-8 (AQP8) [5]. However, the release of •O2 − from mitochondria into cytosol is mediated by voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) [6], but not mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), because it is not finally identified [7]. Therefore, considering these mentioned facts, mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 may be an indispensable part in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. (see Table 1 ) Indeed, increasing studies have well documented the pleiotropic actions of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis. From the aspects of physiology, mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 act as secondary messengers, which play a vital role in antibacterial immunity, autophagy and oxidative stress resistance [8–10]. However, the abnormal generation of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 elicits a series of pathological effects, among which inflammation is of the most common. The relationship between mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 and inflammation has been well elucidated [11]. Intriguingly, mitochondrial iron overload causes excessive mitochondrial •O2 − production during the development of cardiomyocytes hypertrophy [12]. Also, mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 act as a contributor in aging [13,14], neurodegenerative diseases [15] and tumorigenesis [16]. Given that mitochondria function as metabolic and signaling center, it is plausible that mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2-triggered mitochondrial dysfunction is intimately correlated with the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases [17]. Indeed, accumulating evidence has demonstrated perturbations in mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation cause the aggravation of metabolic diseases. For example, hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production is a pivotal contributor in the development of diabetes complications [18]. Additionally, mitochondrial •O2 − also drive macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment induced by monosodium urate crystal, which ultimately leads to gout attack [19]. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) increases mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production, which is responsible for obesity-associated perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) dysfunction [20]. Given various metabolic alterations associated with mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2, more emphasis should be placed on the mechanism of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in metabolic diseases. Herein, we elucidated the sources of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2. The interaction between mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 and metabolic diseases and its precise molecular mechanism are also reviewed."
1,Sources of mitochondrial superoxide/hydrogen peroxide,"In eukaryotes, complexes I, II, III and IV, as mitochondrial redox carriers, are considered as the component of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 are byproducts of this process by which mitochondrial respiration produces ATP through electron transfer [3]. Notably, Brand has well summarized that 11 mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation sites with different properties, among which complex I and III are the primary generators. The 11 sites of generation of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation are relevant to substrate catabolism, electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Among these sites, 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, including 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC), pyruvate (PDHC), branched-chain 2-oxoacids (BCOADHC) and 2-oxoadipate (OADHC), contain FAD that is an underlying site related to the •O2 −/H2O2 production (called sites OF, PF, BF and AF, respectively). The flavin-containing site (IF) and quinone-binding site (IQ) of complex I as well as the outer Q-binding site of complex III (site IIIQo) can produce •O2 −/H2O2 equivalently. Also, dehydrogenases linked to ubiquinone (Q) transferring electrons to the QH2/Q pool, especially complex II (site IIF), mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH, site GQ), the electron-transferring flavoprotein – ETF:Q oxidoreductase system (ETF and ETF:QOR, site EF) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH, site DQ), all of these sites are associated with the production of •O2 −/H2O2(Fig. 1 ) [21,22]. Interestingly, there are two distinct mechanisms of •O2 − generation in complex I. One is reverse electron transfer (RET) in the case of low ATP demand and proton dynamic (PMF) saturation. The other is forward electron transfer under the situation of high NADH/NAD+ ratio [23,24]. Compared with complex I, •O2 − produced from complex III can be ignored, but it is more easily released into cytoplasm to engage in signal transduction [22]. •O2 − can also be generated by complex II, when the activity of complex I and III are both decreased [3]. A study of isolated mitochondria from rat skeletal muscle shows that site IIF possesses the highest ability to produce •O2 −, apart from site IIIQo and site IQ. Moreover, Complex IV, as the terminal and rate-limiting complex, has not been proved to directly generate •O2 −. However, its influence on •O2 − produced from complex Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ cannot be ignored. Additionally, the binding of O2 and Fea3 2+ induces structural changes and completely reduces O2, thereby impeding the production of •O2 − [25]. In general, the electron leak products of sites IF, IIIQo, and GQ are primarily •O2 −. Both •O2 − and H2O2 may be produced from site IIF. Sites OF, PF, BF, AF and IQ are known to generate mainly •O2 −, or a mixture of •O2 − and H2O2 [21]. However, it seems that the production of H2O2 is a consequence of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-mediated disproportionation [26]. However, the specific electron leak products of sites EF and DQ have not been confirmed [21]. Normally, most of these sites release their •O2 −/H2O2 product to the mitochondrial matrix. Specifically, sites OF, PF, BF and AF release •O2 − and/or H2O2 into the matrix space, due to their location in the mitochondrial matrix [21]. Similarly, sites IF delivers •O2 − into the matrix space [27,28]. Site IQ generates •O2 − and/or H2O2 into the matrix space [27]. Site IIIQo generates •O2 − into the matrix and the intermembrane space [27,29]. Site IIF, DQ and EF produces •O2 −/H2O2 to the mitochondrial matrix [30–32]. Site GQ releases mostly or entirely •O2 − or into each side of the mitochondrial inner membrane [33]. Cumulatively, given so many sites associated with the generation of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2, it is imperative to understand the exact mechanism by which mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 affect the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases."
2,The role of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in diverse diseases,
3,Mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 promote the development of diabetes and its-related complications,"3.1 Mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 promote the development of diabetes and its-related complications Diabetes, as a canonical metabolic disease, is characterized by hyperglycemia. Sustained hyperglycemia causes chronic damage to various tissues, especially eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves. Early studies indicate that hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation is the key event in the occurrence of diabetes [18]. During the development of diabetic vascular complications, hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 are responsible for the activation and damage of vascular endothelium [34]. Heat shock protein 22 (HSP22) ameliorates the severity of diabetic vascular complications by eliminating mitochondrial •O2 −-mediated endothelial injury and maintaining the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission [35]. NADPH oxidases (especially Nox2), as one of the important mechanisms of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 stimulation [36], are highly expressed in response to high glucose, which subsequently contributes to vascular dysfunction [37,38]. Based on these findings, it is plausible that mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 exert significant effects in the occurrence of diabetic vascular complications. Indeed, ROS regulate vascular tone by modulating the activity of protein kinase C β (PKCβ) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) during hyperglycemia. PKCβII activates the 66-kDa Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (p66Shc) by Ser-36 phosphorylation, which subsequently causes p66Shc upregulation and PKCβII-dependent eNOS inhibiting Thr-495 phosphorylation via mitochondrial •O2 − production, ultimately contributing to vascular dysfunction [3,39]. Activation of p66Shc stimulated by PKCβII and elevation of mitochondrial •O2 − persist even after glucose normalization. However, these effects are blunted after knocking down p66Shc, suggesting that p66Shc mediates vascular hyperglycemic memory [39]. Additionally, hyperglycemia-induced lysine acetylation of p66Shc in turn promotes its phosphorylation and translocation to the mitochondria, where it triggers mitochondrial H2O2 production. Sirtuin1 (Sirt1)-mediated p66shc deacetylation at lysine 81 accounts for the reduction of mitochondrial H2O2 [40]. Resveratrol (RSV) also inhibits mitochondrial H2O2 production by activating Sirt1. This may be related to the promotion of SOD2 expression by Sirt1 to increase the antioxidant capacity of mitochondria (Fig. 2 ) [41]. In general, the surge of vascular oxidative stress is responsible for endothelial dysfunction [42]. Among factors that induce oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes, mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 account for one [43]. As one of the regulators of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2, AMPK plays an important role in combating oxidative stress [44]. In detail, high concentrations of mitochondrial H2O2 activate AMPK, which in turn promotes SOD2 expression to counteract oxidative stress in patients with CAD and diabetes [45]. Currently, metformin and pioglitazone are considered as potent drugs for the treatment of diabetes. Mechanistically, treatment with metformin and pioglitazone significantly reduce mitochondrial H2O2 production by activating AMPK and subsequent induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) and SOD2. Metformin also increases mitochondrial biogenesis via promoting the activation of AMPK and PGC-1α, which is associated with the reduction of mitochondrial H2O2 (Fig. 2) [18,46]. Unlike type 2 diabetes (T2D), type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs due to the combined disruption of T cells and pancreatic beta cells [47,48]. Normally, mitochondria are necessary for T cells and beta cells to perform their functions. Under immune attack, mitochondria in beta cells are destroyed and cause excessive mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production, which increases the susceptibility of beta cell autoimmunity [49]. In addition, mitochondrial •O2 − (particularly generated at complex III) activate T cells immunity by triggering the activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and IL-2 secretion [50,51]. During the development of T1D, there are excessive proinflammatory factors and ROS in the islet microenvironment, which leads to the enhanced vascular endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression. Thereafter, the inflammatory microenvironment promotes extravasation of T cells, which contributes to the death of beta cells and aggravates T1D [52]. With the prolongation of hyperglycemia, harmful substances will gradually form in the body, named advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [53]. AGEs can engender metabolic disorders in vascular wall and lead to the occurrence and development of diabetic complications, such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and atherosclerosis [54]. Studies show that endothelium functions as a mediator of AGEs-related signaling. The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is also expressed in aortic endothelial cells [55]. AGEs cause mitochondrial dysfunction through promoting mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production in response to hyperglycemia stimulation. Excessive mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in turn stimulate AGEs formation and RAGE expression, thereby causing cell damage and senescence [56]. Moreover, AGEs impair eNOS activity via increasing mitochondrial •O2 − production in T2D patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis (Fig. 2) [57]. Furthermore, hyperglycemia-stimulated mitochondrial •O2 − generation in turn promotes PKC activation, AGEs formation and the increase of hexosamine pathway flux via activating DNA strand break-mediated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and GAPDH poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation [58]. Mitochondria, as glucose sensor and signaling center, are damaged to varying degrees at different stages of diabetes [59]. Sustained hyperglycemia pressure-induced inflammation is one of the hallmarks of T2D [60]. Under hyperglycemia condition, Mitochondrial fragmentation promotes mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production and cell death [61]. Overexpression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) or mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1) disrupts mitochondrial network and raises mitochondrial •O2 − production, whereas overexpression of mitofusin1 (MFN1) or MFN2 exhibits the opposite effect [62]. Similarly, mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial •O2 − production promoted by excessive mitochondrial fission are also observed in coronary endothelial cells (MCECs) isolated from diabetic mice [63]. However, unrestrained mitochondrial •O2 − also promotes mitochondrial fission and further fragmentation [63,64]. Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission inhibition impedes mitochondrial •O2 − generation and rescues the expression of eNOS and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), suggesting a role for Drp1-derived mitochondrial •O2 − in modulating vascular tone (Fig. 2) [65]. Conversely, overexpression of Drp1 increases mitochondrial •O2 − formation, which subsequently disrupts insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) – serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (AKT) pathway and glucose transporter (GLUT) translocation stimulated by insulin [66]. Interestingly, Ca2+-mediated Drp1 expression induces mitochondrial fragmentation under high glucose stress without causing mitochondrial H2O2-triggered inflammatory responses. In fact, the impairment of mitochondrial rho GTPase 1 (Miro1), a protein assisting normal mitochondria to the functional sites to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, is responsible for this proinflammatory responses. Specifically, Ca2+ mediates Miro1 disassociating from mitochondria in response to high glucose pressure, which subsequently leads to NLRP3-dependent proinflammatory responses induced by mitochondrial H2O2, ultimately contributing to impaired insulin secretion (Fig. 2) [60]. Particularly, hypoglycemia is also known as the common event in diabetes. Moreover, low glucose also promotes the occurrence and development of diabetic vascular complications by increasing mitochondrial •O2 − production. In detail, hypoglycemia stimulates mitochondrial •O2 − production by promoting fatty acid oxidation. Meanwhile, hypoglycemia also impedes the phosphorylation of eNOS and facilitates the expression of adhesion molecules [67]. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial •O2 − generation induced by hypoglycemia is also relevant with Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission. NO bioavailability and vasodilation are restored after inhibiting mitochondrial fission-derived mitochondrial •O2 − [68]. Mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 also serve as the primary criminal in the development of diabetic complications. During hyperglycemia, thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is upregulated, which subsequently provokes excessive production of mitochondrial •O2 − and inhibits mitophagy in proximal tubular cells, ultimately accelerating the progression of diabetic nephropathy [69]. Besides, mitochondrial H2O2 in turn promote TXNIP expression. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the activation of mitochondrial H2O2/TXNIP/NLRP3/IL-1β axis is also related to tubular oxidative injury in patient with diabetic nephropathy. This process can be reversed by MitoQ, an antioxidant targeting mitochondrial H2O2 [70]. Recently, empagliflozin has been identified as promising drug in the treatment of diabetic cardiovascular complications. Mechanistically, empagliflozin induces AMPK activation, subsequently suppressing Drp1S616 (Serine616) phosphorylation and promoting Drp1S637 (Serine637) phosphorylation, which eventually prevents mitochondrial fission. The restrained mitochondrial fission in turn blocks mitochondrial •O2 − generation and restores the barrier function of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells [71]. More intriguingly, hyperglycemia induces cellular hypoxia, which may be the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Concretely, hyperglycemia stimulates numerous mitochondrial •O2 − production and further inhibits the expression of AQP1, a water and oxygen channel. Inhibited AQP1 further engenders cellular hypoxia and leads to subsequent increase in endothelin-1, fibronectin production and apoptosis, eventually contributing to the occurrence of diabetic complications (Fig. 2) [72]. Given so many upstream regulators and downstream effectors of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2, the role of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in the development of diabetes (T1D, T2D) and its-related complications is delicately explained. Among these factors, a bidirectional interaction between mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 might account for the most important. Collectively, all of these signaling involved in the development of diabetes directly or indirectly lead to abnormal mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation, which in turn disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and endothelial integrity. However, more studies are still needed to clarify the detailed mechanism of diabetes and its complications caused by mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2."
4,Mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 aggravate the progression of gout,"3.2 Mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 aggravate the progression of gout Gout is a crystal-associated joint disease characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) [73,74], which is directly related to hyperuricemia caused by purine metabolism disorder and/or decreased uric acid excretion. Much evidence supports that MSU could interact with multiple receptors, such as CLEC12A, CD11b, CD14, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and TLR4 (Fig. 3 ), which subsequently triggers inflammatory cascade response and causes the occurrence of gout [75]. Recently, NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been demonstrated as one of the pathogenesis of gout [74,76]. Besides, inhibition of mitophagy/autophagy results in mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 accumulation in damaged mitochondria, which in turn triggers the activation of NLRP3. Therefore, it indicates a critical role for mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in NLRP3 activation during gout [77]. Indeed, excessive production of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 is responsible for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [78]. MitoTEMPO can inhibit NLRP3 activation by scavenging mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 [79]. Specifically, MSU facilitates mitochondrial •O2 − generation to promote NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion. This effect can be reversed by catechin [80]. In addition, MSU stimulates mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation by promoting xanthine oxidase (XO) expression, leading to subsequent apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) oligomerization, NLRP3 and caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. H2S exhibits an inhibitory effect on this process [81]. Besides, treatment with curcumin impedes NLRP3 activation by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial •O2 − production, which contributes to the attenuation of gout [82]. Furthermore, gouty inflammation is also relevant with the activation of immune cells. Mitochondrial •O2 − derived from fatty acid oxidation can facilitate the secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α driven by NF-κB, which eventually leads to the recruitment of neutrophils [19]. Additionally, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) also shows an inhibitory effect in MSU-induced inflammatory response. Mechanistically, DHA promotes the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its-mediated expression of antioxidant enzymes (HO-1 and NQO-1) to eliminate mitochondrial •O2 − generation induced by MSU. Subsequently, the reduced mitochondrial •O2 − further blocks MSU-induced expression of IL-1β and TNF-α (Fig. 3) [83]. To date, the cause of MSU accumulation is still unclear. speculation is proposed whether mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 are the leading cause in MSU deposition? This speculation needs more studies to clarify. The above studies have suggested that mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 are the key pathogenic factors in gout exacerbation. Considering the adverse effect of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in the development of gout, targeting mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 might be a potential therapeutic strategy and provide us with a novel insight into the perturbation of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in gout."
5,Mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 exacerbate the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),"NAFLD is characterized by excessive deposition of intrahepatic lipid in addition to alcohol and other well-defined liver damage factors. NAFLD covers a wide range of liver injury, from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The consequences of disturbed mitochondrial homeostasis-induced abnormal mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation is the key to the pathogenesis of NAFLD [84]. Liver steatosis is correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated ROS levels, and increased sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. ROS signaling is a key mediator of ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, the disruption of ROS homeostasis in steatotic liver causes liver losing its ability to regulate IPC [85]. Importantly, PGC-1α, as a critical modulator of ROS, can protect liver from IR injury, which may be related to its ability to induce antioxidant genes expression [86]. In NAFLD, factors that can stimulate mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation and inhibit mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 elimination both potentiate the effects of oxidative stress [87]. Clinically, high concentration of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 and its-caused mtDNA damage are observed in liver tissues from patients with NASH. The impairment of mtDNA further suppresses the synthesis of respiratory chain polypeptides encoded by mtDNA, ultimately impeding electron flow in the respiratory chain and promoting subsequent mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation [88]. In addition, the depletion and impairment of mtDNA are responsible for the increase of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in secondary biliary cirrhosis (Fig. 4 ) [89]. High levels of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 can accelerate the progression of NASH by forming biologically active lipid peroxidation products [90]. Additionally, cardiolipin, particularly required for the optimal activity of complex I, can be easily peroxidized by mitochondrial •O2 − [91,92]. The peroxidation of cardiolipin further impairs complex I activity, which accounts for the accumulation of mitochondria H2O2 and subsequent hepatocyte injury [93]. Cumulatively, mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 are considered as the critical factors in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Therefore, antioxidants targeting mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 are particularly important. In normal hepatocytes, antioxidant systems, such as catalase, SOD, GSH and peroxiredoxins play an important role in the maintenance of redox balance. Decreased SOD2 activity fails to scavenge •O2 − from mitochondrial respiratory chain. In addition, mitochondrial glutathione (mGSH) depletion also leads to limited H2O2 reduction. The supplementation of SOD mimetics and GSH ethyl ester (GSHEE) markedly reduces the production of •O2 − and H2O2, which ultimately ameliorates the severity of NAFLD [94]. Similarly, both increased mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production and decreased antioxidant enzymes (SOD2 and GSH) activity are adverted during NAFLD [95]. Moreover, probiotics can protect liver against oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 via activating Sirt1/PGC-1α pathway [96]. Mulberry also protects liver tissue from oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial •O2 − in NAFLD via increasing the activity of SOD enzyme [97]. Besides, peroxiredoxin 5 (Prx5) can inhibit free fatty acid-induced mitochondrial •O2 − formation and lipid accumulation to alleviate NAFLD [98]. Additionally, dihydromyricetin (DHM) can also effectively prevent the progression of NAFLD via regulating Sirt3 signaling. In detail, treatment with DHM impedes mitochondrial •O2 − production by promoting deacetylation of SOD2 mediated by Sirt3. Sirt3 is activated after the activation of AMPK-PGC1α/ERRα signaling pathway (Fig. 4) [99]. Moreover, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a key activator of AMPK. Its deficiency exacerbates cardiac metabolic stress [100]. Therefore, LKB1 activation may prevent the development of NAFLD. In addition to the above antioxidant systems, there are many ways to mitigate NAFLD, all of which are ultimately achieved by scavenging mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) could suppress mitochondrial fragmentation through enhancing MFN1 expression and suppressing Drp1 and Fis1 expression, which subsequently reduces mitochondrial H2O2 accumulation [101]. Besides, butein also ameliorates NAFLD by abrogating mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 (Fig. 4) [102]. In summary, a plethora of evidence highlights the close relationship between excessive mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production and NAFLD development. An abnormal increase in mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 can disrupt lipid homeostasis, resulting in impaired lipid metabolism and excessive lipid accumulation. Moreover, the imbalance between mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production and its scavenging system provokes mitochondrial oxidative stress and accelerates the deterioration of NAFLD. Therefore, maintenance of redox balance is essential for normal liver function."
6,Antioxidants targeting mitochondrial superoxide/hydrogen peroxide,"Currently, there are many measures that are responsible for the prevention of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 formation. For example, exercise enhances resistance to mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2-induced oxidative stress. The expression of PGC-1α, SIRT3 and Fis1 are normalized after exercise, which is accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial •O2 − formation [103]. IPC treatment also inhibits mitochondrial depolarization and mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 generation [104]. Mechanistically, IPC reduces mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 accumulation by promoting immediate early response gene X-1 (IEX-1) expression [105]. Recently, antioxidants regarding the clearance of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 have been gradually emphasized. Rotenone and piericidin A, as site IQ inhibitors, can block electrons transfer to CoQ and cause an subsequent increase in •O2 − production [22]. Attractively, there are several suppressors that can inhibit •O2 − or H2O2 generated from these mitochondrial sites without affecting electron transfer. CN-POBS (N-cyclohexyl-4-(4-nitrophenoxy)benzenesulfonamide) has been confirmed as the first inhibitor that selectively represses •O2 −/H2O2 generation at site IQ [106]. Another but much better site IQ suppressor, S1QEL1.1 (N1-(3-acetamidophenyl)-N2-(2-(4-methyl-2-(p-tolyl)thiazol-5-yl)ethyl)oxalamide) are discovered soon after. Meanwhile, S3QEL 2 (1-(3,4-Dimethylphenyl)-N,N-dipropyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine) are also identified with the ability to specifically suppress •O2 −/H2O2 production at site IIIQo [107]. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that mitochondrial antioxidants, including MitoVitE, MitoQ, MitoPBN, MitoPeroxidase, MitoTEMPO and SS tetrapeptides, can rapidly scavenge •O2 −/H2O2 and attenuate mitochondrial toxicity [108,109]. More importantly, preclinical observations suggest that MitoQ has the potential to treat age-related vascular dysfunction by targeting mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 [110]. Antipodean Pharmaceuticals is also conducting clinical work on MitoQ-related products. In a Phase II clinical study, SKQ1 has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of dry eye [111]. Recently, Essex Bio-Technology and Mitotech have launched a Phase Ⅲ clinical study of SkQ1 for patients with dry eye. Therefore, after fully understanding the precise pathogenic mechanism and production sites of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2, antioxidants targeting mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 will certainly have a place in clinical application."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, we uncover the sources of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 as well as mitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms and highlight the crucial role of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases. Given the unique role of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 in modulating redox balance, it is plausible that the destruction of cell homeostasis and the progression of metabolic diseases are attribute to abnormal mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 production. Specifically, excessive production of mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 is intimately associated with the deterioration of diabetes, gout, and NAFLD. Therefore, antioxidants against mitochondrial •O2 −/H2O2 formation might be the pivotal strategy in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases."
