0,Introduction,"As the energy dilemma and environmental pollution problems become increasingly serious, the development of green renewable energy has attracted widespread attention. Hydrogen has the advantages of high combustion value and recycling clean, which is considered to be the most desirable green energy of the 21st century and can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via water splitting is one of the promising and valuable strategies for converting inexhaustible solar energy into available chemical energy [1–3]. Though lots of photocatalysts have been reported and studied [4–6], research on low cost, high-efficiency, good-durability and solar-driven photocatalysis materials is still a hot topic. The composite photocatalysts are usually made up of a photosensitizer and a cocatalyst to the H2 evolution reaction (HER). Layered C3N4 with a similar graphitic structure (g-C3N4) has been reported as a metal-free polymer n-type semiconductor with the advantages of good sunlight absorption property (Eg =2.7eV) and photocatalytic stability for water splitting [7–11]. However, the photocatalytic activity of pure g-C3N4 is low due to its fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole paris. Cooperating with cocatalyst is an effective way to facilitate the charge separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs for g-C3N4 [12,13]. However, to date, the reported cocatalysts used in previous studies are mainly noble metals, such as Pt, Au and Pd [14–16], which are rare and expensive. To reduce the cost of photocatalytic H2 production, there is an important interest in introducing highly effective and inexpensive noble-metal-free cocatalyst into g-C3N4 [17–21]. In recent years, typical transition metal sulfides such as nickel sulfides have been identified as promising candidate electrocatalytsts for enhancing hydrogen evolution [22–24]. It is well agreed that employing an electrocatalytst as a cocatalyst to accelerate the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction on the semiconductor surface [25,26]. In addition, nickel sulfides were composed of two earth-abundant element. Therefore, it is highly expected that nickel sulfides can be used as promising cocatalysts resulting in the enhancement of light-driven hydrogen evolution performance of g-C3N4. Since 2013, several nickel sulfides/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts have been synthesized by various methods, representing excellent performance for hydrogen production from water, including NiS/mesoporous C3N4 and NiS2/g-C3N4 (hydrothermal method) [26,27], NiS/g-C3N4 (ion-exchange method) [28], NiS/e-C3N4 (precipitation and hydrothermal method) [29]. These great works indicated promising application of nickel sulfides as photocatalytic HER cocatalysts. However, up to now, all the reported nickel sulfides in photocatalytic systems are linked or mixed randomly with photo-active materials. As known, transferring photo-generated electrons to protons is the main work of HER cocatalyst, and the charge transfer will be influenced obviously by the position cocatalyst loaded. Therefore, the connective point between cocatalyst and photo-active materials is desirable to be located at the electron outlet points of photo-active materials. As a result, the design of precise preparation strategy to couple nickel sulfides with the outlet points of photo-generated electrons on g-C3N4 is of great significance. Photochemical synthesis is a mild and rapid approach to prepare cocatalyst on photo-active substances. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that noble metals can be precisely deposited on the outlet points of photo-generated electrons by photochemical route, which is of advantage to the charge transfer and helpful for efficient and stable hydrogen evolution [30–32]. However, up to now, photochemical synthesis of HER cocatalyst composed of noble-metal-free elements is still rare and challenging [17,33,34]. To the best of our knowledge, photo-reduction deposition of earth-abundant typical transition metal sulfides such as Co and Ni sulfides has not been reported. Taking above conditions into consideration, herein, a general photochemical synthesis route to typical transition metal sulfides as cocatalyst for hydrogen evolution was proposed from the case of NiS/g-C3N4 (as shown in Scheme 1 ). When the preparation time was 20min, the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate mounted up to 16400μmolg−1 h−1.The turnover number (TON) reached 1230 000 in 52h with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 23 600 for NiS. As far as we know, this is one of the most robust g-C3N4 based HER photocatalysts using transition metal sulfides as cocatalysts. In addition, the general applicability of the photochemical synthesis route was proved by expanding NiS to CoS and g-C3N4 to CdS."

3,Preparation of g-C3N4 nanosheets,"2.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 nanosheets The g-C3N4 nanosheets were synthesized according to our previous report [18]. Briefly, 20g thiourea was heated at 550°C for 2h in static air with a ramp rate of 2°Cmin−1. After that, the resultant yellow bulk g-C3N4 was milled into fine power, placed in an open porcelain crucible and heated at 500°C with a heating rate of 2°Cmin−1 and maintained at this temperature for 2h. Finally, light yellow powder (about 0.1g) of g-C3N4 nanosheets was obtained."
4,Synthesis of NiS/g-C3N4 composites,"2.3 Synthesis of NiS/g-C3N4 composites The g-C3N4 nanosheets based NiS composite photocatalysts were prepared by a photochemical deposition method. In detail, 20mg of g-C3N4 was added in a mixture solution of 1mL Ni(CH3COO)2 aqueous solution (12.5mgmL−1), 1mL thiourea aqueous solution (38mgmL−1), 4mL ethanol and 4mL ultrapure water. Subsequently, the resultant suspension was purged with nitrogen for 40min to remove air. Irradiation was carried out for given period of time (0–30min) with a 300W Xenon lamp at room temperature to vary the deposition content of NiS. Finally, the grey products were collected centrifugation and washing repeatedly with water and alcohol, and dried in 60°C vacuum oven. The acquired samples were denoted as NiS-T/g-C3N4, where T referred to the photochemical deposition time (min)."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, German). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were collected on a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) to examine the morphology and size of sample. To detect surface species of sample, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted using an ESCALAB 250 Xi (Thermo, USA) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα line as the excitation source (hν =1484.8eV) and adventitious carbon (284.8eV for binding energy) was used as reference to correct the binding energy of sample. UV–vis diffuse relectance spectra were measured on a UV-3600 (Shimadzu, Japan) spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded by averaging 32 scans with a resolution of 2cm−1 using a Nicolet 6700 (Thermal, USA) infrared spectrometer with a DLaTGS detector. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Varian, USA Spectra AA-220/220Z) was used to detect the Ni element content in the sample. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Esclipse, Varian, USA). In order to explore the charges features, the surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra was measured by self-made equipment."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic experiments were performed in a 50mL flask at ambient temperature using a 300W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. 5mg of NiS/g-C3N4 composite was added in a mixture solution of 9mL water and 1mL triethanolamine. Before each experiment, the suspension was purged with pure nitrogen gas for 40min to remove air. Hydrogen gas evolution was measured by gas chromatography (FULI GC9790 using a 5Å molecular sieve column, argon as a carrier gas) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) were calculated by using the following equations: TON = moles of evolved H2 moles of NiS on photocatalyst TOF = TON reaction time ( hours )"
7,Photoelctrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelctrochemical measurements Photocurrents were measured on a CHI600D electrochemical analyzer (Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai) in a standard three-electrode system with a working electrode, a Pt net as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A 300W Xe lamp served as the light source. The electrolyte was 0.50molL−1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 2.0mg of sample was dispersed in a mixture solution of 0.8mL ethanol, 0.2mL water and 40μL Nafion® perfluorinated resin solution. 50μL of resultant suspension was uniformly dropped onto a 1×1cm2 indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass. And then the electrode was dried at 60°C for 12h. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequency ranged from 0.1 to 100000Hz in parallel with the alternating current signal amplitude of 5mV."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Photochemical formation of NiS/g-C3N4,"3.1 Photochemical formation of NiS/g-C3N4 When thiourea (TU) was mixed with Ni2+ ions, the [NiTU]2+ complex was generated (Eq. (1.1)) [35,36]. Due to the high specific surface area and the beneficial structure of the g-C3N4 nanosheet, the [NiTU]2+ complex can be effectively adsorbed on its surface. Under irradiation, the g-C3N4 adsorbed and harvested light to generate electron-hole pairs which were subsequently transported to the surface (Eq. (1.2)). Ethanol acted as a hole scavenger and was oxidized by the holes on the valence band to yield CH3CHO and H+ (Eq. (1.3)) [37]. The photogenerated electrons accumulated in the g-C3N4 conduction band possessed enough reductive driving force to reduce the adsorbed [NiTU]2+ complex (Eq. (1.4)) leading to the production of a NiS/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst. (1.1) Ni2+ +TU→[NiTU]2+ (1.2) g-C3N4 +hν →g-C3N4 (eCB − +hVB +) (1.3) C2H5OH+hVB + →CH3CHO+H+ (1.4) [NiTU]2+ +2eCB − →NiS+CN− +NH4 + Firstly, control experiments were carried out to illustrate the necessity of every precursor on the synthesis of NiS/g-C3N4. The specific experiment conditions were listed as shown in Table 1 . After the initial formation course, five different solid catalysts from system A, B, C, D and E, were collected through further treatments, including centrifugation, washing and drying. Then the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of them were tested under the same conditions, and the H2 evolution rate were shown in Fig. 1 . In experiment A, the mixture including g-C3N4, Ni(CH3COO)2, TU and C2H5OH was treated for 20min under UV–vis light, and this is a typical approach to synthesize NiS/g-C3N4, whose corresponding H2 evolution rate (16400μmolg−1 h−1) was much higher than that of several other tests. Compared with experiment A, the differences of the experiment B, C, D and E are the absence of Ni(CH3COO)2, TU, C2H5OH and irradiation, and the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity are 75μmolg−1 h−1, 7047μmolg−1 h−1, 4101μmolg−1 h−1 and 1193μmolg−1 h−1, respectively. What’s more, after 20min irradiation, there was no any precipitation formation in system F, indicating the unique role of photo-active material (g-C3N4). Consequently, these conditions including photo-active material, nickel salt, proper sulfur source, sacrifice agent and irradiation were all indispensable to prepare the NiS/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst."
10,Characterization of NiS/g-C3N4,"3.2 Characterization of NiS/g-C3N4 XRD patterns (Fig. S1) were used to investigate the phase structure of pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst. Both pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 had two distinct diffraction peaks at 28.0° and 13.1° which can be indexed to graphitic materials as the (002) and (100) planes of JCPDS 87–1526. These results illustrated that the g-C3N4 nanosheet structure maintained unchanged after NiS deposition. No NiS peaks were observed from the XRD patterns possibly due to the low content of NiS and the well dispersed NiS particles on the surface of g-C3N4. FTIR spectra were used to study of chemical functional groups of pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 composite as presented in Fig. S2. The broad band located in 2850–3400cm−1 involving residual NH components and OH bands were associated with uncondensed amino groups and surface-adsorbed H2O molecules. A broad adsorption band in the region between 790 and 1750cm−1 was related to the ploycondensation structure of g-C3N4 which were attributed to the vibration characteristic of s-triazine ring units and heptazine heterocyclic ring units [38]. Pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst had similar absorption bands which indicated that the introduction of NiS did not change the structure of g-C3N4. These results were in good accordance with XRD analyses. TEM and HRTEM images were used to observe the morphology and composition of a typical NiS-20/g-C3N4 photocatalytst, and the results were given in Fig. 2 . From the TEM image (Fig. 2a), it was founded that NiS particles with sizes of several to tens of nanometers were deposited on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets. HRTEM image (Fig. 2b) presented an interplanar spacing of about 0.321nm and 0.201nm, which corresponded to the (002) lattice plane for g-C3N4 and the (102) lattice plane for NiS, respectively [17,29]. These results further confirmed the successfully deposition of NiS particles on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets. XPS spectra were recorded to analyze the surface species and chemical states for NiS-20/g-C3N4. Fig. 3 a presents the high resolution XPS spectrum of C1s in which the peak at 284.8eV was due to the adsorbed carbon species on the surface and the 288.2eV peak was ascribed to the network of g-C3N4 [39]. As displayed in the high resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s (Fig. 3b), three deconvolution peaks at 398.6, 399.2 and 400.9eV should be assigned to the sp2 N atoms in the triazine units, bridging N in N-(C)3 of NH and N in the heterocycles and cyano groups, respectively [40]. The binding energy of the main peak of Ni 2p was found at 855.4eV in Fig. 3c, which was consistent with that of Ni2+ 2p3/2 in NiS [41]. Fig. 3d gave the high resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p. The peak at 162.8eV corresponded to the S2− [42]. The 168.0eV peak was likely due to the thiourea dimerization product thioperoxydicaronimidic diamide [43]. In addition, the Ni content in NiS-20/g-C3N4 was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and the ratio of NiS/g-C3N4 was calculated as 0.76wt%. These results were in good agreement with the generation of NiS on the g-C3N4 surface."
11,Photocatalytic performance,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic H2 production activity of NiS/g-C3N4 with different photochemical deposition time was investigated as shown in Fig. S3. At first, the H2 production significantly enhanced with the increase of the preparation time. When it was 20min, the highest photocatalytic activity mounted up to 16 400μmolg−1 h−1, which is about 2500 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (6.5μmolg−1 h−1). These results indicated that pure pristine g-C3N4 was not active for photocatalytic H2 evolution and NiS was an effective cocatalyst for g-C3N4. Longer preparation time resulted in decrease of the photocatalytic activity and the H2 evolution rates were reduced to 14813.0μmolg−1 h−1 (25min) and 12024.3μmolg−1 h−1 (30min) respectively, which was possibly due to the overloading NiS shield g-C3N4 from light harvesting [44,45]. Since platinum has been used to enable extraordinary performance for photocatalytic H2 production, we prepared and measured the hydrogen evolution activity of 0.76wt% Pt/g-C3N4 for comparison under the same conditions (Fig. S4). Photocatalytic activity of Pt/g-C3N4 reached 29 900μmolg−1 h−1, which is higher than that of NiS/g-C3N4. However, the cost of noble metal Pt is far more than NiS. Therefore, NiS expects to serve as an alternative to precious platinum for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In view of practical applications, besides catalytic activity, the stability and durability are also indispensable to photocatalysts. In order to evaluate the stability and durability of NiS-20/g-C3N4, we performed the time-circle H2 evolution experiment. Fig. 4 (a) presented the H2 evolution as the function of irradiation time. The total photocatalytic H2 amount of NiS-20/g-C3N4 after 52h reaction was about 514mmolg−1 and the turnover number (TON) reached 1230 000 in 52h with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 23 600 for NiS. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate did not markedly decline after 10 runs for 40h, indicating the good stability and durability of the NiS-20/g-C3N4 sample for photocatalytic H2 production. After the 52h cycling experiments, the H2 generation rate dropped to about 7.0mmolg−1 h−1, only 63% of the first cycle. The decrease of activity might be attributed to the slow fall-off of the NiS nanoparticles from g-C3N4 surfaces due to complex action with triethanolamine and Ni2+. The next step for the research will be finding an effective solution to improve the stability of NiS/g-C3N4. It is to be observed that the H2 production rate (after 52h) is still far more than that of recently reported nickel sulfides/g-C3N4 photocatalysts (Table S1). From what we can learn, the obtained NiS/g-C3N4 was one of the best transition metal sulfides modified g-C3N4 photocatalytic hydrogen production systems. The ultimate goal of a photocatalyst can be capable of high-efficiency application of sunlight and solar energy. Therefore, H2 evolution was also conducted with NiS-20/g-C3N4 photocatalyst under direct sunlight outdoors (Fig. S2). As illustrated in Fig. 4(b), the H2 production quickly increased with the prolongation of sunlight irradiation time. During 7h, the H2 evolution reached 28.3mmolg−1, which indicated that NiS-20/g-C3N4 was also an efficient catalyst for sunlight-driven H2 evolution from water. Such heterostructures may be expected to be promising candidates as effective sunlight photocatalysts and potential technological applications. After 16:00, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate started to decline significantly assigned to solar dimming."
12,Proposed photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Proposed photocatalytic mechanism The UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra of pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst were recorded. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the pure g-C3N4 had an absorption edge at about 450nm which corresponded to band gap of 2.71eV for g-C3N4. When NiS was introduced, the NiS/g-C3N4 showed the same absorption edge as pure g-C3N4, indicating neither Ni nor S doping in the g-C3N4 structure. However, in comparison with pure g-C3N4, a broader absorption in the visible region was observed for NiS/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst. Besides that, in order to identify whether the enhanced absorption of visible light was contribute positively to the remarkable photocatalytic activity of the NiS/g-C3N4, control experiments were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 5(a). The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity at different wavelengths were consistent well with the UV–vis absorption spectrum of pure g-C3N4, not that of NiS/g-C3N4. The results indicated that the enhanced absorption in the visible region from nickel sulfide was almost ineffective for its high activity. Given all that, the NiS played the part of the cocatalyst in this photocatalytic system. Beyond this, photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra and surface photovoltage spectra (SPV) were performed to study the charge recombination and transfer behavior of the NiS/g-C3N4 composite. Fig. 5(b) gave the PL spectra of pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 with an excitation wavelength of 325nm. Both pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 showed an emission peak at about 455nm corresponding to the band gap for the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes [18]. However, the PL emission intensity of g-C3N4 obviously decreased after loading NiS, suggesting that the charge recombination can be efficiently prevented for g-C3N4 after the NiS modification. As shown in Fig. 5(c), both pure g-C3N4 and NiS-20/g-C3N4 exhibited obvious positive photovoltage response with a wavelength between 300–400nm, which match well with the photo-active wavelength range of the g-C3N4. Then the photovoltage values are almost zero in the range of 400–600nm, and this means that the light of this wave band is invalid for both pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4. These results showed that the band gap of g-C3N4 was not changed after loading of NiS and the NiS took the role of cocatalyst of the g-C3N4, which were consistent with the conclusions obtained from Fig. 5(a). Moreover, it was apparent that the photovoltage response intensity of the g-C3N4 improved significantly after the loading of NiS, demonstrating higher charge separation efficiency for the NiS/g-C3N4 compared to the native g-C3N4. In the light of the contents mentioned above, the proposed phtocatalytic H2 production mechanism in NiS/g-C3N4 composite system was presented, as shown in Fig. 5(d). Under irradiation, g-C3N4 was excited and the electrons and holes then generated. However, in pure g-C3N4, the photogenerated carriers tended to recombine. According to above TEM and HRTEM results, it could be observed that g-C3N4 had an intimate contact with NiS particles. In NiS/g-C3N4 composite, the photogenerted electrons in conduction band of g-C3N4 can easily transfer to NiS which prevented the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes of g-C3N4. In this process, the intermediate H-NiS first formed by the absorption-reduction of one H+ for NiS (Eq. (2.1)), and then H2 was electrochemically released by the reduction of another H+ (Eq. (2.2)). Such the hydride-NiS has been experimentally and computationally confirmed in many NiS hydrotreating processes [46]. (2.1) NiS+e− +H+ →H-NiS (2.2) H-NiS+e− +H+ →NiS+H2 To verify the proposed mechanism, photoelectrochemical (PEC) I–t curves and EIS Nyquist plots were investigated to verify the enhanced efficiency of charge separation and support the proposed photocatalytic H2 production mechanism. Fig. 6 (a) presented the photoelectrochemical (PEC) I-t curves of pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 electrodes under intermittent light irradiation. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the NiS/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst showed higher photocurrent density, which indicated the efficient photogenerated charge transfer between NiS and g-C3N4 in NiS/g-C3N4 composite. Beyond this, as shown in Fig. 6(b), the EIS Nyquist plots of pure g-C3N4 and NiS/g-C3N4 were performed, and the NiS/g-C3N4 displayed much smaller EIS arc radius than g-C3N4. The results suggests that the NiS loading can greatly reduce the force of the charge transfer and separation, thus dominantly improving the H2 production activity."
13,General applicability,"3.5 General applicability In order to illustrate the general applicability of the photochemical synthesis route, a series of control experiments were carried out. Firstly, we changed NiS to CoS, and CoS-20/g-C3N4 was synthesized through a similar method. Photocatalytic HER rate of CoS-20/g-C3N4 came to 3732μmolg−1 h−1, which was 574 times than that of native g-C3N4 (Fig. S6). Thus, it is fair to assume that different kinds of transition metal sulfides modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts can be synthsized via photochemical method and very likely possess outstanding H2 evolution performance. In addition, to verify the applicability for photo-active materials, CdS and NiS-20/CdS were prepared and the photocatalytic activities were measured as shown in Fig. S7. To begin with, CdS nanorods were fabricated as in previous research [47], and the preparation process of the NiS-20/CdS NRs was no appreciable difference with the NiS/g-C3N4, only replacing g-C3N4 with CdS. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of the CdS has received effective promotion after occupied the NiS. To sum up, this work provided a common strategy to built hydrogen production systems of transition metal sulfides modified semiconductor photosensitizers."
14,Conclusions,"Taking NiS/g-C3N4 as a case, a novel photochemical synthesis route to typical transition metal sulfides was realized. The introduction of NiS on g-C3N4 surface significantly increased the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of g-C3N4 due to effective charge separation. The NiS-20/g-C3N4 showed the highest H2 evolution activity of 16400μmolg−1 h−1, and the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate was not markedly decline after 40h. The TON reached 1230 000 in 52h with a TOF of 23 600 for NiS. Furthermore, the hydrogen evolution of the NiS-20/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst reached 28.3mmolg−1 during 7h under natural sunlight. NiS cocatalyst can efficiently promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and consequently enhance the H2 evolution activity of g-C3N4. This work opens a new door to precise preparation of typical transition metal sulfides for catalysis utilization."
