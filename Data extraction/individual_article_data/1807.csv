0,Introduction,"Thioglycolic acid (HSCH2COOH, TGA) was a colorless organic acid and an important raw material applied in the field of fine chemicals. TGA has a very broad variety of applications in light industry, chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries [1]. Such as, a raw material for synthesizing material additives, functional cosmetics, and mineral processing additives, etc. [2]. At present, sodium hydrosulfide, sodium thiosulfate and sodium polysulfide methods were used in the industrial production of TGA. The most widely used is the sodium hydrosulfide method with sodium thiosulfate and sodium chloroacetate act as the main raw materials [3]. The equations are as follows: ClCH2COOH+2NaSH→HSCH2COONa+NaCl+H2S HSCH2COONa+HCl→HSCH2COOH+NaCl From above process, TGA can be produced with containing the dilute aqueous. To get the higher purity of TGA, liquid–liquid extraction was usually adopted for industrial use because of energy efficiencies and separation abilities [4–6]. Moreover, the main challenge of liquid–liquid extraction was to choose the appropriate extractant solvents [7]. An appropriate extractant solvent should have the characteristics of stability, safety, easy generation, low volatility and low viscosity [8,9]. In industries, for example, triamyl alcohol, isopropyl ether, ether, butyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone and ethyl acetate have been adopted to extract TGA. However, these solvents were volatile, toxic, or flammable. Compared with them, isopropyl acetate (IAC) was a solvent which have a variety of manufacturing applications and can be miscible in organic solvents and water [10]. Hence, IAC was also applied to extract TGA in industries [11]. But in the application of IAC, a small quantity of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was generated, because of IAC was produced by the esterification reaction of IPA and acetic acid (HAC) [12]. Therefore, a mixture of IPA + IAC + HAC + water will appear [13–15] during the above process. Moreover, IPA + IAC and IPA + water were azoetropes with a minimum constant boiling point [16–18]. After consulting the literatures, the VLE behaviour of systems metioned above have been investigated by some researchers. The VLE experimental results of the binary systems of (IPA + IAC) have been published by casmirio et al. [16] and Andreatta et al. [19] at atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa and observed azeotropic behaviour. The azeotrope composition of IPA: IAC were 0.6883: 0.3117 (mole fraction) at 353.51 K and IPA: IAC = 0.6710: 0.3290 (mole fraction) at 353.65 K, respectively. The Herington and van Ness test were adopted to verify the thermodynamic consistency of the measured results. The VLE data of (IPA + water) at the pressure of 101.3 kPa has been explored by A. Orchillés et al. [20] and Li et al. [21] in which azeotrope behaviour was appeared. The azeotrope composition of IPA: water = 0.6580: 0.3420 (mole fraction) at 353.12 K and IPA: water = 0.6615: 0.3385 (mole fraction) at 353.25 K (estimated by the literature data results), respectively. Also, Herington and van Ness test were used for validating the thermodynamic consystency for the measured results. Nevertheless, the VLE behaviour for the other systems about the TGA by-products have not been dissevered yet in the NIST and the DDB (Dortmund Data Bank). Although those two azetrope systems have already been studied, they were also adopted and made comparison with the reported results in this project to test the equilibria apparatus and operation method. Therefore, the binary and ternary systems VLE data for (IPA + IAC), (IPA + water), (HAC + IAC), (HAC + IPA), (IAC + HAC + water), and (IPA + HAC + water) were determined at 101.3 kPa. The Herington [22] and van Ness [23] test were adopted to test the thermodynamic consistency of the determined results of VLE experimental data [24]. Besides, the binary results were used to correlate with NRTL [25], UNIQUAC [26] and Wilson [27] activity coefficient models, then the binary interaction parameters that can be used to optimize and design for separating TGA by-products can be obtained [28]. It had been known that HAC molecules can connect with each other and form steady dimers in both vapour and liquid phase [29]. The Hayden-O'Connell (HOC) [30] equation was able to generalize the vapour-liquid equilibrium of the binary system which has associated components. In this work, the Hayden-O'Connell (HOC) equation were adopted to explain the dimerization of acetic acid molecules, and also describe the deviation of the properties of the ideal gas caused by the interaction in the vapour phase between two molecules. Therefore, the NRTL-HOC, UNIQUAC-HOC, Wilson-HOC models were applied to correlate the VLE of the binary system."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The chemical analytical drugs used, IPA, IAC, and HAC, were commercially available. Pure water was adopted in this work, and the quality of all reagents were provided by the suppliers. The purities of all reagents were examined by gas chromatograph (GC). Meanwhile, no obvious impurity peaks were detected, and used without further purification. Table 1 gives details about the CAS numbers, suppliers, purity and boiling temperature of chemicals at the pressure of 101.3 kPa [31–36]."
3,Equipment and procedures,"2.2 Equipment and procedures All the binary and ternary VLE experimental results were all obtained at the pressure of 101.3 kPa through the modified Rose-type circulating equipment [11], which used an accurate mercury thermometer with an uncertainty of 0.01 K [38,39]. The equipment usage method, experimental measurement procedure and related specific precautions related to this experiment have been covered in the previous article [29,40,41]. The vapour and liquid phases were continuously circulating in order to get the establishment of equilibrium and ensure adequate contact between the two phases. When the vapour temperature was constant at least 40 min for every experiment, equilibrium conditions were assumed to have occurred, then the vapour and liquid phases samples were taken out for analysis with gas chromatography. When sampling, the vapour and liquid samples should be taken out with a syringe at the same time and avoid the contamination, then analyzed by GC immediately."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The obtained vapour and liquid phases samples were analysed by a gas chromatograph (Scion instruments 456C). Table 2 lists the detailed operating conditions of GC, including temperature, gas carrier, and analytical conditions. For (IPA + HAC) system, a heating rate temperature program method was adopted. The composition of the vapour and liquid samples were measured by the area calibration normalization method [42,43]. In order to obtain valid data, an electronic balance, uncertainty of 0.0001 g, was used to configure five standard samples which have known compositions and cover the entire range of systems. According to the results, the peak area of the GC was corrected. Then, all the liquid and vapour samples were measured at least three times to make the deviation value less than 0.001. Besides, (HAC + IPA) mixtures are reactive systems because of the esterification reaction of IPA and HAC can produce IAC. However, the esterification reaction rate of HAC and IPA mixture is very slow. Only with the use of a catalyst the rate of reaction can be significantly improved [44]. Moreover, for binary, ternary or quaternary of its corresponding mixtures, acid, alcohol, ester and water are also reactive systems because of the esterification or hydrolysis reaction. But part of them can hold down the esterification or hydrolytic reaction, and the reaction rate is very slow or can be neglected [29]. Thus, the receivable results, GC chromatograms and conditions were presented in Part 3 in the Supplementary Materials, which can prove that the esterification reaction can be ignored during the VLE measurement in this work."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Binary systems experimental data,"3.1 Binary systems experimental data The VLE data of four binary systems, (IPA + IAC), (IPA + water), (HAC + IAC), (HAC + IPA), were obtained at the pressure of 101.3 kPa. The y-x VLE diagram of binary systems are shown in Fig. 1 . It is noted that (IPA + IAC) and (IPA + water) are azeotropes. All the experimental data results of binary systems are presented in Tables 3–6 and its corresponding T-x-y diagrams are shown in Figs. 2–5 . However, the binary systems of (IPA + IAC), (IPA + water), (HAC + IAC), and (HAC + IPA) have been reported or partially determined. In this work, to check the equilibrium still and experimental approach, the available and unquestioned VLE data of (IPA + IAC) and (IPA + water) were compared between the determined data and the published literature, and the VLE diagrams were also displayed in Figs. 2–3. It can be seen that the above two experimental results are in good agreement with the data in the published literatures, which showed that the experimental equipment and approach were applicable. However, in comparison with the data in the literature [45] it can be found that there is a certain deviation between the data in this work and in that literature. According to the analysis, the reasons for the deviation were occurred because of the equilibrium still type and detection method, environment, operating and equipment condition etc. are different. After a careful review for the related systems, several literature references about (HAC + IAC), and (HAC + IPA) binary systems were also retrieved. But for the (HAC + IAC) system, the corresponding diagram presented in Fig. 4, it has been found that the deviations occur. And it is because of the conditions of the local atmospheric pressure, thermometer detection, operating condition, materials, equilibrium still and detection method. To clearly compare the deviations both in this work and in the published literature, the detailed comparisons are listed in Table S1 and the corresponding data sets are listed in Tables S3–S6 in Supplementary Materials. Moreover, to verify the reliability of the experimental data in this work, some data sets for the studied systems were also repeated and listed in Part 2 in Supplementary Materials. Besides, no comparison was done for the (HAC + IPA) system due to the data being incomplete or not available."
7,Ternary systems experimental data,"3.2 Ternary systems experimental data In order to test the accuracy of the calculated binary interaction parameters and make the obtained data can better help the separation work, the related ternary systems (IAC + HAC + water) and (IPA + HAC + water) were determined. The VLE data of the corresponding ternary systems were obtained at 101.3 kPa. All the experimental results are presented in Tables 7–8 . The deviation for the IAC + HAC + water system was compared and the comparison for its main conditions are listed in Table S2, the corresponding original data sets are listed in Tables S7–S9. In addition, the related data sets of the experimental data and the reported data were compared for the (IAC + HAC + water) ternary system, and the specific comparison results are listed in Tables S10–S11 in Supplementary Materials."
8,VLE calculation,"3.3 VLE calculation The following formula can express the relation of vapour-liquid equilibrium [53]: (2) P y i φ i = x i γ i φ i s P i s exp V i L P - P i s RT Because this experiment was carried out under low pressure conditions, the non-ideality of steam can be ignored. Therefore, the Pointing factor, φ i and φ i s were close to 1 and Eq. (2) can be simplified to the following formula: (3) γ i = P y i P i s x i where xi and yi respectively present the equilibrium mole fractions of component i in liquid phase and vapour phase. P represents the experimental pressure, and P i s represents the saturation pressure of pure component i. regarding the solution of P i s which can be obtained by extending the Antoine formula: (4) I n P i s = C 1 i + C 2 i T + C 3 i + C 4 i T + C 5 i l n T + C 6 i T C 7 i C 8 i ⩽ T ⩽ C 9 i Each constant parameter value in the above formula was directly taken from Aspen's databases [54], which are expressed in Table 9 . The values of activity coefficient (γi ), solved by Eq. (3), were respectively presented in Tables 3–6. In order to evaluate the non-ideality for the four binary systems, it is needed to calculate the Gibbs free energy difference between the actual situation and the ideal situation which can calculated value of G through the following formula: (5) G E = R T ( x 1 l n + x 2 l n γ 2 ) GE is given in Tables 3–6 and expressed in Fig. 6 . The data of γi and GE were obtained on the basis of the NRTL model. As can be seen from Fig. 6, GE values of the four binary systems are all greater than zero, indicating that these systems display positive deviations of Raoult's law. In comparison, positive deviation of (IPA + water) system is the largest. That is, the non-ideality of this system is the largest."
9,Thermodynamic consistency test,"3.4 Thermodynamic consistency test The Herington [55,56] and van Ness [23,57] methods were adopted to verify the thermodynamic consistency of the VLE data. Meanwhile, the Herington test was used to ensure the dependability of the measured results. It was a semi-empirical method applied to verify the dependability of the measured results. The related formulas are expressed as follows: (6) D = 100 ( A - B ) ( A + B ) = 100 ∫ 0 1 l n γ 1 / γ 2 d x 1 ∫ 0 1 l n γ 1 / γ 2 d x 1 (7) J = 150 T max - T min T min where, γ 1 and γ 2 represent the activity coefficients obtained based on the NRTL model, ln (γ 1/γ 2) vs. x 1 is expressed in Fig. 7 . A is the area surrounded by the curve above the zero horizontal axes. B represents the area enclosed by the curve below the zero horizontal axes. T max represents the highest boiling temperature, and T min represents the lowest boiling temperature. If the value of |D − J| < 10, the Herington test can be met. That is the system exhibits thermodynamic consistency. The data of the four systems (IPA + IAC), (IPA + WATER), (HAC + IAC), and (HAC + IPA) are all less than 10, respectively: 6.276, 7.006, 7.371, 6.305. It shows that the VLE results measured for the four binary systems have satisfied the thermodynamic consistency test. In addition, van Ness test was performed for the obtained experimental results, which was a point-by-point test. The method, which calculated the average absolute deviation between the experimental results and the calculated value, was applied to test the reliability of the obtained vapour-liquid equilibrium experimental results, so those points with large deviations can be removed. This method needs that the values of Δy and ΔP are both less than 1, and it can indicate that the calculated data has satisfied the thermodynamic consistency test. The criterions are showed as follows: (8) Δ y = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N 100 y i exp - y i cal (9) Δ P = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N 100 P i exp - P i cal P i exp where, N represents the value of results points, y i represents the mole fraction of the vapour phase. P i is the pressure, the superscripts “exp” and “cal” represent the measurement data and calculation data of the NRTL model. The obtained Δy and ΔP are expressed in Table 10 . These two values are less than 1 for all systems. This shows that the data measured by all systems have met the requirements of the van Ness test, which is, passed the thermodynamic consistency."
10,Data correlation,"3.5 Data correlation The determined values of the two binary systems for (IPA + IAC) and (IPA + water) were correlated by the NRTL, UNIQUAC, WILSON activity coefficient models. And the measured results for the two binary systems of (IAC + HAC) and (HAC + IPA) were correlated by the NRTL-HOC, UNIQUAC-HOC, WILSON-HOC activity coefficient models. The principle of maximum likelihood can minimize the objective function, which can be defined as follows: F = ∑ i N P i exp - P i cal σ P 2 + T i exp - T i cal σ T 2 + x i exp - x i cal σ x 2 + y i exp - y i cal σ y 2 (10)where N is the number of the measured results, P and T represent the equilibrium pressure and temperature of the binary system, and y and x represent the mole fractions in the vapour and liquid phases of the component i, which refer to the standard deviation. The “exp” represents experimental results. The “cal” denotes the calculated value. Table 11 lists the r and q of the UNIQUAC model of each system, where r is the volume parameter and q are the area parameter. The data obtained from the model regression are shown in Figs. 2–5. The binary interaction parameters of each model are given in Table 12 . The experimental data deviation of each system is shown in Figs. 8–9 . The RMSD (y1 ) and RMSD (T) values of each systems are shown in Table 12, and it can be seen that the RMSD (y1 ) and RMSD (T) values of the four systems do not exceed 0.0120, 0.22 K. According to the above information, it can be seen that the calculated values were greatly correlated with the adopted model."
11,Conclusions,"In this project, VLE experimental results of six systems: (IPA + IAC), (IPA + water), (HAC + IAC), (HAC + IPA), (IAC + HAC + water), and (IPA + HAC + water) were obtained at atmospheric pressure 101.3 kPa. Herington and van Ness tests were adopted to verify the thermodynamic consistency of the experimental data, which all the binary systems passed, that were, the data have good reliability. Moreover, the NRTL, UNIQUAC and Wilson activity coefficient models were adopted to correlate the VLE experimental data measured in this experiment, and the RMSD (y1 ) and RMSD (T) values of each binary system were determined to be less than 0.0120, 0.22 K, respectively. All those indicated that the relevant data were in good agreement with the VLE results obtained in this work. In addition, the binary interaction parameters of the NRTL, UNIQUAC and Wilson activity coefficient models were also gained, which can be applied in the design, simulation, and optimization of the related separation distillation process."
