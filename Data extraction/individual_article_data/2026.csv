0,Introduction,"Pesticides are among the most common contaminates found in various water resources. Organophosphorus materials are one of the largest pesticide groups, including about 40% of pesticides in the world. Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are relatively inexpensive and widely used in agricultural activities for various types of pests that cause human health and environmental problems (Saleh et al., 2020). Diazinon (O, O-diethyl-O- [6-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl] phosphorothioate) is an organophosphorus insecticide that is categorized in the World Health Organization (WHO) as a medium-risk insecticide (Class II). The maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) for diazinon in drinking water is 0.02 mg L−1 (20 μ g L−1). This organophosphorus pesticide has oral toxicity of 300 mg kg−1. Diazinon causes a serious threat to human health; it inhibits the action of enzymes in the nervous system. Also, diazinon causes harmful effects on human organs and blood, resulting in some diseases such as brain cancer and respiratory paralysis (Bayat et al., 2018). Consequently, treatment or removal of this insecticide from contaminated water is high importance. Various approaches have been reported for the removal of organophosphorus pesticides from aqueous solution including biological process (Saleh et al., 2020), electrochemistry (Mahmoudpoor Moteshaker et al., 2020), adsorption (Mirsoleimani-Azizi et al., 2018), membrane filtration (Mohammadi Nilash et al., 2020), and oxidation (Ghodsi et al., 2020). Among them, the adsorption technique has been widely used for the removal of pesticides due to its high performance, low cost, simple operation, and production of nontoxic by-products (Mirsoleimani-Azizi et al., 2018). Different types of adsorbents including activated carbon (AC) (Bayat et al., 2018), MCM-41 (Armaghan and Amini, 2009), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Dehghani et al., 2019), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (Mirsoleimani-Azizi et al., 2018) have been reported for the removal of pesticides from aqueous media. Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15) is of great interest to the materials community due to its excellent textural properties, such as high specific surface area, large pore size with a narrow size distribution, and high thermal and hydrothermal stability compared to the well-known mesoporous silica MCM-41. SBA-15 has cylindrical pores arranged in a hexagonal order, which can be tuned in the range of 4–26 nm. The pore size may vary from ∼ 200 nm to several microns (Ahmadian et al., 2020). These materials are extensively applied in adsorption (Ahmadian et al., 2020), catalysis (Wang et al., 2018), drug delivery (Hajiaghababaei et al., 2020), and fuel cell (Rajabi et al., 2020). Morphology of the synthesized mesoporous silica is an important factor in different applications. Sorbents with spherical morphology have lower pressure drops, higher fluid bed fluidity, and are they not damaging to the reactor at the exchange in comparison with traditional adsorbents, which contain edges (Shimura and Ogawa, 2005). SBA-15 can be synthesized with different morphologies, including hallow spheres (Zhao et al., 2000), fiber-like (Li et al., 2009), rods (Johansson et al., 2011), thin films (Gao et al., 2015), etc. SBA-15 spheres have attracted a great attention due to the ability to control the particle morphology and pore size of mesoporous silica and also easy manipulation of these spherical particles for different applications such as catalysis (Martins et al., 2017), chromatography (Ma et al., 2003), and pharmaceuticals (Kim et al., 2010). There are some strategies that have been employed for the synthesis of spherical SBA-15. Mesa et al. synthesized SBA-15 spheres with 5–10 nm pore size using triblock copolymer Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20) as surfactant and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as co-surfactant. The spherical SBA-15 was prepared under high temperature, high dilution, and low acidity to weaken the surfactant-silicate interactions (Mesa et al., 2003). In another study, lee et al. mesoporous SBA-15 synthesized through controlling the synthesis factors including initial temperature, stirring rate, and micelle packing parameter and obtained SBA materials with various morphologies from micrometer-sized spheres to mono-dispersed nanometer-sized particles with different shapes such as hexagonal columns, platelets, rice-shapes, rods, and donuts (Lee et al., 2010). Aims of this work are including: ( i ) Synthesis of spherical SBA-15 by a solvent evaporation induced aggregating assembly (EIAA) method. ( ii ) Applied a low-cost and facile strategy for synthesis of SBA-15 microspheres using pluronic triblock-copolymer P123 as template and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) supermicelles as co-surfactant. ( iii) Investigating of adsorbent efficiency for diazinon removal from aqueous solution in different operating conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Reagents used in this study were tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mw = 70650 g mol−1), hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB, Mw = 70650 g mol−1), NaOH (0.1N), HCl (0.1N), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.5%), ethanol (97%), diazinon ( ≥ 98%), pluronic P123 (EO20–PO70EO20) and H3PO4 (85%). All reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Merck (Germany), except pluronic P123, diazinon, and H3PO4 which were purchased from Aldrich (Germany). The main properties of the diazinon pesticide are given in Table S1."
3,Preparation of spherical SBA-15,"2.2 Preparation of spherical SBA-15 At first, 6.0 g pluronic (P123) was dissolved in 225 mL solution of concentrated H 3 PO4 and distilled water under stirring. The solution was divided into three equal volumes (A-1, A-2, and A-3 solutions). After that, 24 mL of HTPB/THF solution was prepared after 1 h stirring at room temperature. Then, this mixture was added dropwise into 60 mL of 1% PVA solution in water/ethanol mixture (B-1 solution) with the ethanol to water ratio of 2:1 for 24 h at room temperature and then was kept for 3 days (HTPB to PVA ratio of 1:6 w/w). For the preparation of P123-PVA/HTPB, B-1 solution was added to the A-1 solution and then stirred at 40 ° C for 12 h to remove ethanol. Then, TEOS was added dropwise to the mixture and stirred at 40 ° C for another 24 h. After that, the mixture was aged at 100 ° C for 24 h and then filtered, washed, and dried at 90 ° C. The obtained solid product was first calcined at 250 ° C for 3 h and then at 550 ° C for 4 h. To investigate the effect of PVA/HTPB ratio on the SBA-15 spheres, the B-2 (2% PVA) and B-3 (4% PVA) solutions were also added to the A-2 and A-3 solutions, respectively, (Scheme 1). The samples were named as “A-B-x”, where x represents the PVA content (wt%) in water/ethanol mixture."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were utilized to identify the crystal structure of the samples. XRD patterns were recorded using an X’Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer (Netherlands) with the Cu-K α radiation (1.5406 °A) and 2 θ from 0.8° to 10.0°. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at 77K (−196 ° C) on a micromeritics model ASAP 2020 analyzer (Germany) and, then the samples were degassed at 350 ° C for 3 h. Pore size distribution and surface area of the samples were calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) and the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) methods, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Philips-XL30 microscope (Netherlands). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI TECNAI F20, 200 kV, United States) was also used to evaluate particle size and morphology. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Shimadzu 8400s, Japanese) spectra were obtained in the range of 400–4000 cm − 1 . UV/vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 2550 spectrophotometer (Japanese)."
5,Adsorption experiments,"2.4 Adsorption experiments Adsorption tests were carried out to investigate the ability of the synthesized adsorbent for diazinon removal in an Erlenmeyer flask using a batch adsorption system. For each adsorption test, a certain amount of adsorbent was added to the diazinon solution. After shaking, the ample was immediately filtered, and then analyzed by UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 248 nm. The effect of pH value (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0), contact time (10 to 60 min), adsorbent dosage (0.1 to 2 g L−1), initial concentration (10 to 50 mg L−1), and solution temperature (298, 308, and 318 K) on the diazinon adsorption was evaluated. The removal efficiency (R %) and the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent were calculated by the equations (S1, S2)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the spherical SBA-15,"3.1 Characterization of the spherical SBA-15 As mentioned above, different amounts of PVA/HTPB were added to the reaction system containing P123 (A-B-x). Noncovalent PVA-HTPB supermicelles were synthesized by mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers for 4 days. Due to the hydrophobic nature of HTPB, which is insoluble in water, HTPB polymer was dissolved in THF. Also, the selection of ethanol/water mixture for the solvation of PVA can reduce the possible agglomeration of PVA within P123 due to the weaker hydrogen-bonds between ethanol and PVA than those between H 2 O and PVA (Lopes and Simoneau, 2017). Indeed, the formation of noncovalent supermicelles (PVA/HTPB) can reduce the agglomeration of PVA within P123. Prevent the agglomeration of PVA could be useful to well-dispersed particles, improve its properties, and self-assembled behavior (Perfetti et al., 2020; Pota et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2018). PVA chains interact with polymer chains of HTPB via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups on HTPB and PVA to form noncovalently connected micelles (NCCMs) (Shen et al., 2007). These supermicelles were added into the phosphoric acid aqueous solution of P123 to obtain a homogeneous solution. Generally, there are two main routes to prepare ordered mesoporous materials; solution-phase synthesis and solvent evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) (Wei et al., 2011). Here, for the synthesis of mesoporous silica spheres via EISA route, TEOS, P123, and PVA/HTPB were dissolved in water/ethanol/THF solution. At the beginning of the reaction, P123 concentration is below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It is possible to change the structure of the SBA-15 by varying the initial composition of the solution. Gradual evaporation of THF and ethanol occurred under static conditions at 40 ° C for 12 h. As a result, the reaction solution changed from a clear solution to a milky white dispersion and the concentration of P123 increased, resulting in the formation of micelles. Morphology of the synthesized A-B- 1 , A-B- 2 , A-B- 3 , and A-B- 3 -S samples was compared with that of conventional SBA-15 (C-SBA-15) (Fig. 1). As can be seen, PVA/HTPB supermicelles have changed the morphology of SBA-15. SEM image in Fig. 1a show a rope-like morphology characteristic of C-SBA-15 according to the previous study (Mohamadnia et al., 2010). Addition of PVA/HTPB to the P123 did not significantly change, the SBA-15 particle morphology which showed a rope-like morphology similar to the C-SBA-15 (Fig. 1b). Further addition of PVA/HTPB supermicelles progressively modified the SBA-15, resulting in a new morphology for the A-B- 2 (Fig. 1c) and A-B- 3 -S samples due to strong electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVA/HTPB supermicelles, P123 and silica precursor. An appropriate amount of PVA/HTPB can facilitate the formation of SBA-15 spheres through hydrogen-bonding assisted assembly. With the increase of PVA/HTPB content, the SBA-15 particle morphology changed considerably. SEM images of SBA-15 prepared with 4% PVA are shown in Fig. 1d. Different morphologies (including plate-like, spherical, cylindrical, etc.) can be seen in Fig. 1d, which were formed in the structure of SBA-15, due to the direct addition of B-3 solution to the A-3 solution. Spherical SBA-15 particles were obtained through dropwise addition of B-3 solution to the A-3 solution, denotes as A-B- 3 -S (Fig. 1e). As can be seen in this image, the spherical SBA-15 particles are in the range of 3- 8 μ m , revealing that they are formed from the assembly of submicron-sized SBA-15 particles by PVA/HTPB. The HRTEM micrograph of the SBA-15 sample is shown in Fig. 1f. It can be seen that the obtained SBA-15 has a unique sphere-in-sphere structure which appears. Also, HRTEM confirms the high crystalline nature of the synthesized spheres. Low-angle XRD patterns of A-B- 1 , A-B- 2 and A-B- 3 -S samples are shown in Fig. 2 which demonstrate 2D hexagonal structure (P6 mm) with diffraction peaks corresponding to (100), (110), and (200) planes (Gaudin et al., 2016). This indicates that the structure of SBA-15 has not changed by increasing the amount of PVA/HTPB supermicelle. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for A-B- 1 , A-B- 2 , and A-B- 3 -S samples are shown in Fig. 3 which are of type IV. The detailed parameters of the pore structure samples A-B- 1 , A-B- 2 and A-B- 3 -S samples are listed in Table 1. Typically, the surface area and pore volume of these samples can be easily turned in a relative range of 677–803 m2/g and 0.85–1.02 cm3/g, respectively. A-B- 2 and A-B- 3 -S samples are mesoporous, facilitating the mass transport of the molecules. Higher specific surface area (803 m2 g−1) and pore volume (1.02 cm3 g−1) was obtained for A-B- 3 -S sample in comparison with A-B- 2 sample (743 m2 g−1 and 0.85 cm3 g−1 , respectively). The physical and structural properties of A-B- 3 -S sample are compared in Table 2 with those of mesoporous SBA-15 spheres synthesized previously. According to the results, PVA/HTPB is recommended since it is more economical. Also, the obtained SBA-15 spheres showed a higher surface area than the other reported values. Fig. S1 illustrates FT-IR spectra of A-B- 1 , A-B- 2 , and A-B- 3 -S samples in the 400–4000 cm − 1 region. It can be seen that they have similar spectra. The peak at 950 cm−1 represents the stretching vibration surface of hydroxyl group (OH). Peaks in the range of 1000–1260 cm − 1 and 803–806 cm − 1 , are attributed to Si–O–Si bonds in the condensed silica network and the symmetric stretching vibration of Si–O, respectively (Samadi et al., 2017)."
8,Evaluation of adsorbent efficiency,"3.2 Evaluation of adsorbent efficiency The synthesized spherical SBA-15 adsorbent was used for diazinon removal from aqueous media. The effect of various parameters including solution temperature, pH, diazinon concentration, adsorbent dosage, and contact time were investigated. A variety materials can be adsorbed on the ordered mesoporous silica by different mechanisms such as ionic exchange, sieve effect, hydrogen-bonding,​ complexation, and hydrophobic interaction (Giraldo and Moreno-Pirajdn, 2013). It can be seen from the FTIR spectra that the surface of spherical SBA-15 contains hydroxyl functional groups. Hydrogen-bonded species are formed through the interaction of surface hydroxyl groups with electronegative elements (N, O, and S) of diazinon molecule (Fig. S2). Consequently, hydrogen-bonding can be considered as the diazinon adsorption on the spherical SBA-15. 3.2.1 Effect of solution pH The solution pH plays an important role in the adsorption process, modulating the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate. The effect of pH in the range of 3.0 to 9.0 on the diazinon removal by spherical SBA-15 was investigated using initial concentration of 50 mg L − 1 , and adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g L − 1 at 25 °C for 60 min. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the efficiency of diazinon removal in the presence spherical SBA-15 increased with an increase in pH value due to higher affinity for hydrogen bonding between adsorbate and adsorbent. Since the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by both [H3O + ] and [OH − ] in water, the rate of diazinon hydrolysis depends on the pH (Gomaa et al., 1969). By increasing the pH value from 7.0 to 9.0, the removal of diazinon decreased because the rate of diazinon hydrolysis increased significantly. Therefore, pH 6 was selected as the optimum pH value in the aqueous media. 3.2.2 Effect of adsorbent dosage The adsorbent dosage is one of the key parameters influencing the removal of pollutants in the adsorption process. The effect of adsorbent dosage in the range of 0.1 to 2 g L−1 on diazinon removal was evaluated at pH 6 using initial diazinon concentration of 50 mg L − 1 at 25 ° C for 60 min. As shown in Fig. S3, by increasing the adsorbent dosage from 0.1 to 2 g L−1, the efficiency of diazinon removal decreases mainly due to the saturation of adsorbent active sites during the adsorption process (Song et al., 2018). The increase in the adsorbent dosage may cause aggregation of adsorbent, and consequently, the available adsorption sites may decrease as well due to the adsorption density. In other words, the removal efficiency decreases by increasing the amount of adsorbent dosage, due to the decreasing number of accessible active sites of adsorbent. Also, the lower removal performance, in this case, is probably attributed to the concentration gradient between the diazinon in the solution and the adsorbent surface, resulting in a decrease in the amount of diazinon adsorbed on the adsorbent by increasing the adsorbent dosage. The dosage of 0.1 g L−1 was selected as the optimum value for the subsequent experiments. 3.2.3 Effect of contact time The adsorbent contact time in the range of 10–60 min for diazinon removal was investigated at pH 6 using initial diazinon concentration of 50 mg L−1, and the adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g L−1 at 25 ° C, as shown in Fig. S4. It can be seen that the percentage of diazinon removal by the adsorbent increased by increasing the contact time. Also, the results showed that the required equilibrium time to achieve spherical SBA-15 is 60 min. 3.2.4 Effect of initial diazinon concentration The effect of initial concentration of diazinon was evaluated at pH 6 using adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g L − 1 at 25 ° C for 60 min (Fig. S5). The results exhibited that the efficiency of diazinon removal by spherical SBA-15 decreased from 84.5% for 50 mg L−1 diazinon to 58% for 10 mg L−1 diazinon. Therefore, the efficiency of diazinon removal increases by increasing the initial diazinon concentration since more diazinon molecules are adsorbed on the active sites. 3.2.5 Effect of temperature The effect of different temperatures on the performance in diazinon removal was investigated at pH 6, the initial diazinon concentration of 50 mg L−1, and an adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g L−1 for 60 min. Fig. S6 indicates that the efficiency of diazinon removal by spherical SBA-15 increases from 84.8% at 298 K to 95.2% at 318 K because the viscosity of adsorbent slightly decreases at higher temperatures, resulting in lower mass transfer coefficient, thinner concentration polarization layer, and hence higher adsorption rate (Song et al., 2018)."
9,Adsorption kinetic modeling,"3.3 Adsorption kinetic modeling The kinetic study of diazinon adsorption on the SBA-15 spheres at pH 6 using the initial diazinon concentration of 50 mg L−1, and the adsorbent dosage 0.1 g L−1 at 25 °C was examined according to pseudo-first-order (Ho et al., 2000), pseudo-second-order (Ho, 2006), and Elovich (Ho, 2006) kinetic models defined by the equations (S3–S5). Correlation coefficients (R2) of the kinetic models and their parameters for spherical SBA-15 are reported in Table 3. It seems from the R2 values in this table that pseudo-second-order kinetic model better describes the data better than other models. In other words, the experimental data best fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Anova analysis results is given in Table S2. In addition, activation energy (E α ) can be expressed by the Arrhenius equation (S6) (Sekar et al., 2004). Activation energy is an important parameter for the determination of reaction rate. At a constant temperature, the reaction kinetic is inversely proportional to the activation energy. The apparent activation energy of the spherical SBA-15 adsorbent obtained for the sorption process was 16.69 kJ mol−1."
10,Adsorption isotherms,"3.4 Adsorption isotherms The distribution of an absorbable solute between the liquid and solid phases at the equilibrium state can be obtained from adsorption isotherms. In this work, Langmuir (Özcan and Özcan, 2005), Freundlich (Ngah and Fatinathan, 2008), and Temkin (Sekar et al., 2004) isotherms were utilized for the synthesized spherical SBA-15 adsorbent according to eq. (S7) to (S10). The parameters and the correlation coefficients (R2) of Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin adsorption isotherms are listed in Table S3. Based on the R2 values, the experimental data best fitted the Langmuir isotherm. This indicates that the adsorption of diazinon on the adsorbent could be described as a monolayer adsorption mechanism. The separation factor, RL value (RL = 1/ (1 + C 0 K L )) of the Langmuir model for spherical SBA-15 was is favorable (1 < RL < 0): therefore, sorption process is desirable. Moreover, the n value (adsorption intensity) of the Freundlich model is in the range of 1–10."
11,Adsorption thermodynamics,"3.5 Adsorption thermodynamics Thermodynamic parameters, including entropy change ( Δ S), enthalpy change ( Δ H), and Gibbs free energy ( Δ G), are important for investigating the adsorption process (Ramnani and Sabharwal, 2006). The equations (S11) to (S12) were used. Δ S and Δ H were calculated from the intercepts and slopes of the plot of ln K d versus 1/T, as listed in Table S4. The data in Table S4 confirm that the adsorption process was feasible and it is spontaneous in nature ( Δ G < 0). The negative value of enthalpy change also revealed that the sorption process is exothermic."
12,Effect of co-existing pesticide,"3.6 Effect of co-existing pesticide The influence of co-existing pesticide was also investigated for diazinon adsorption at pH 6 using the initial diazinon concentration of 50 mg L−1, and adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g L−1 at 45 ° C for 60 min by spherical SBA-15. For this purpose, the organochlorine pesticide (OCP) containing lindane (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-hexachlorocyclohexane), was used. It can be seen from Fig. S7 that the efficiency of diazinon removal was not noticeably altered in the presence of lindane. Therefore, it can be claimed that the spherical SBA-15 is an effective adsorbent with high adsorption selectivity for diazinon."
13,Regeneration of adsorbent,"3.7 Regeneration of adsorbent Desorption of diazinon from spherical SBA-15 was studied using 0.1 M of NaOH solution. The efficiency of the regenerated spherical SBA-15 adsorbent is shown in Fig. 5. The adsorption/desorption process was inspected for sixteen times. The result of regeneration experiments exhibited that the spherical SBA-15 adsorbent has good recyclability, so that the percent of diazinon removal did not changed remarkably after sixteen recycling runs. Therefore, the synthesized spherical SBA-15 can be considered as an appropriate adsorbent for diazinon removal."
14,Comparison with other adsorbents,"3.8 Comparison with other adsorbents The efficiency of diazinon removal by spherical SBA-15 adsorbent is compared with previous works in Table S5. It can be found that the spherical SBA-15 has considerable diazinon removal efficiency in contrast to other reported samples. Adsorption isotherms in all the adsorbents are the Sips, Freundlich, and Langmuir. Also, the adsorption kinetic of all the adsorbents followed pseudo-second-order."
15,Prospects,"The use of effective and locally available adsorbents for diazinon removal is essential to develop new treatment systems. In this work, we synthesized SBA-15 microspheres for diazinon removal from water media. A low-cost and facile strategy applied using pluronic triblock-copolymer P123 as template and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) supermicelles as co-surfactant via a solvent evaporation induced aggregating assembly (EIAA) method. This work can be addressed in the future. The spherical SBA-15 can be used in fixed or continuous columns for removal of pesticide. Also, spherical SBA-15 can be modified with different materials and it is​ applied in remove diazinon. Removal of diazinon in the presence of different pesticides can be investigated."
16,Conclusions,"In this research, a low-cost and facile strategy was applied to synthesis spherical micrometer-sized SBA-15. EIAA approach resulted in spherical SBA-15 with high surface area (803 m2 g−1), particle size in the range of 3–8 μ m, and large pore volume (1.02 cm3 g−1). The spherical SBA-15 is used for diazinon removal. Factors influencing the adsorption efficiency, i.e., pH, initial concentration, reaction time, temperature, and adsorbent dosage were investigated. Results indicated that the spherical SBA-15 has a satisfactory performance. The adsorption kinetic followed pseudo-second-order model. The Langmuir isotherm best fitted the experimental data. The obtained values for thermodynamic parameters illustrated that the adsorption of diazinon on the spherical SBA-15 is exothermic and spontaneous in nature. Moreover, the adsorption/ desorption results showed that the spherical SBA-15 sample has a favorable reusability. Spherical SBA-15 can be considered as an effective adsorbent for the treatment of water containing organophosphate pesticides."
