0,Introduction,"Demand for high-grade iron ores is increasing to produce high-quality steels whereas the purity of iron ore is decreasing with time (Mudd, 2013). Therefore, treatment of low-grade iron ores is unavoidable in the recent ironmaking processes. Sulfur is a surface active impurity which affects surface-related processes such as carbon deposition and cementite formation/deposition (Zhang and Ostrovski, 2001). Further, it makes iron brittle, prone to cracking and failure during ironmaking processes. Lee and Rhee (2003) studied reduction of iron oxide in H2-H2S gas mixture at 800–1000 °C. They reported the formation of a porous FeS layer in H2-1% H2S mixture gas which surrounds the reduced iron and promotes the reduction reaction. They also demonstrated that a further increase in H2S to 3% causes a decline in the gas accessibility to the un-reacted iron oxide due to a dense FeS layer which forms over the porous FeS layer. On the other hand, interaction between microwaves and materials is depended on the magnetic and electric properties of materials that provides selective microwave heating characteristic with many advantages during microwave processing. For instance, a good microwave absorption of sulfides and oxides (Rayapudi et al., 2019) in addition to specific dielectric properties of sulfur-contained iron resources prompted researchers to investigate iron production from FeS in the presence of CaO during microwave irradiation wherein both desulfurization reaction (Eq. (1)) and reduction reaction (Eq. (2)) occurred, simultaneously (Amini et al., 2019b, 2019a). Accordingly, reduction behavior of iron oxides in the presence of sulfur during microwave irradiation is a gap for investigating the iron production from high-sulfur iron ores. The authors have previously studied the H2-reduction behavior of magnetite during microwave irradiation (Amini et al., 2018a). In the present study, the hydrogen-reduction reaction of a high-sulfur (1 mass%) magnetite sample in the presence of CaO under microwave heating was investigated to clarify the effect of sulfur on the microwave-assisted reduction reaction of iron oxides. (1) FeS(s) + CaO(s) = FeO(s) + CaS(s) (2) FeO(s) + H2(g) = Fe(s) + H2O(g)"
1,Materials and method,"To prepare a briquette sample with stoichiometric mole ratio Fe3O4:FeS:CaO of 13:1:1 (a sample containing 1 mass% sulfur) and grain size of less than 45 μm, reagent magnetite powder (purity of 99%, 1 μm) was pressed in a tablet shape (30 mm diameter, 20 mm height) followed by heating at 1350 °C in flowing Ar for 60 min in an electric resistance furnace. The heat-treated tablets were crushed and ground to the grain size of less than 45 μm. Reagent CaCO3 powder (purity, 99.5%) was calcined at 1300 °C for 600 min followed by crushing and grinding to the grain size of less than 45 μm. Formation of CaO after calcination process was confirmed by XRD analysis. Reagent FeS (purity, 99%) was crushed and ground to the grain size of less than 45 μm. The prepared magnetite powder, CaO, and FeS were mixed well to prepare a mixture powder containing 1 mass% sulfur. To prepare the briquette samples, approximately 0.02 g of a 5 mass% aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol was added as binder to 3 g of the mixture powder. A cylindrical briquette sample (15 mm diameter, 5 mm height) was formed by a cold-press followed by drying at 120 °C for 600 min. The sample was loaded in an alumina crucible (40 mm diameter) which surrounded by ceramic wool. The crucible was placed in a silica chamber (100 mm diameter, 100 mm height). The ceramic wool was served as a thermal insulator to prevent heat loss during the process and used as a protector for silica chamber. Silica and alumina are weak microwave receptors (Yoshikawa et al., 2019). Sample temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer (IR-FAQINN, CHINO corporation) with a measurement range of 330–1500 °C. The briquette samples were subjected to microwave heating using a multi-mode microwave generator with a maximum output power of 1.5 kW at 2.45 GHz under N2 (1 NL/min) atmosphere for 6 min. Then, the atmosphere was changed into the H2 (1 NL/min) and the time of changing was taken as time zero for reduction degree calculations. The constant power of 1050 W was manually set until the end of the heating in all experiments using three tuning stubs. The schematic of the set-up for microwave heating has been illustrated elsewhere (Amini et al., 2018b, 2018a). After a certain treatment duration, the microwave irradiation was stopped, and the atmosphere was changed into the N2 to cool the sample. Finally, the treated sample was subjected to weight change measurement, XRD, SEM-EDX, optical microscope observations, and Carbon/Sulfur analysis."
2,Results,
3,Microwave heating,"3.1 Microwave heating Fig. 1 shows temperature profiles of the sample during microwave heating for 15 and 30 min. An unsteady temperature profile was observed after changing the atmosphere to H2. A similar pattern also observed in our previous study (Amini et al., 2018a) wherein the results revealed that the microwave absorption of the pure Fe3O4 sample is varied during reduction reaction owing to the new-phase formation via reduction of magnetite to FeO (according to Eq. (3)) and Fe (according to Eq. (2)) with different microwave absorption capabilities. (3) Fe3O4(s) + H2(g) = FeO(s) + H2O(g)"
4,Reduction degree,"3.2 Reduction degree XRD patterns of the sample after microwave heating under N2 and H2 atmosphere, illustrated in Fig. 2 , confirmed the reduction of magnetite to wüstite (Eq. (3)) followed by reduction to metallic iron (Eq. (2)) during microwave treatment under H2 for 15 and 30 min. In addition, no sulfur-containing phase was detected in the XRD patterns that is likely attributed to the small amount of sulfur in the sample, about 1 mass%. Reduction degree, %R, was calculated according to Eq. (4): (4) % R = W i - W t W O × W i where Wi (g) is the initial weight of the sample, Wt (g) is the weight of the sample after treatment for t min, and WO (dimensionless) is the stoichiometric weight ratio of oxygen in sample, which is 0.269. Fig. 3 shows the reduction degree of Fe3O4:FeS:CaO samples with mole ratios of 13:1:1 (present study) and 1:0:0 (Amini et al., 2018a) reduced by H2 for 15 and 30 min during microwave irradiation. Results demonstrate a slightly higher reduction degree in the sulfur-contained sample as compared with the pure magnetite sample."
5,Microstructure observation,3.3 Microstructure observation Partially reduced 13:1:1 sample after treatment for 30 min (%R = 60.8) was subjected to the SEM observation and EDX analysis. Fig. 4 shows the map and point analysis wherein a gap is observed between the reduced metallic iron and its surrounding which is a sulfur-contained iron oxide phase.
6,Discussion,"Point analysis of the reduced metallic iron, point (1) in Fig. 4, indicates that no sulfur has been moved from the sulfide phase to the reduced metallic iron during reduction reaction. This result is in a good agreement with Yu et al. (2015) where they also reported that most of the sulfur is remained in the form of troilite (FeS) during the reduction and finally can be separated via magnetic separation. Further, a progress in desulfurization reaction (Eq. (1)) was also confirmed by SEM observation shown in Fig. 4 wherein the CaS particles were detected; however, no CaS phase is detectable in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2) owing to the small amount of the sulfur-contained phases in the sample. Moreover, temperature measurement during microwave irradiation demonstrated that the average temperature of the 1:0:0 sample during reduction by H2 is ca. 573 °C (Amini et al., 2018a) while that of the 13:1:1 sample after 15 and 30 min treatment is 548 and 520 °C, respectively. Although the average temperature of the pure magnetite sample is higher than that of the sulfur-containing sample, a slightly higher reduction degree was attained in the latter sample. Microscope observations demonstrated that the metallic iron is enclosed by a porous FeS layer with a narrow gap between the Fe and FeS phases. Such a gap improves gas accessibility to un-reacted parts of the sample resulting in a slightly higher reduction degree in the sulfur-contained sample. On the other hand, researchers (Kuwano et al., 1981; Lee and Rhee, 2003) have also observed the porous FeS layer which encircles the metallic Fe phase during reduction of iron oxide in H2-H2S gas mixture under conventional heating; however, they reported no gap between the porous FeS layer and metallic Fe. Yu et al. (2015) also reported no gap between FeS and reduced Fe after reduction of iron ore-coal composite briquette during conventional heating. Therefore, the gap between the metallic Fe and sulfide phases in the present study is likely attributed to the selective and rapid heating characteristics of microwave irradiation. In fact, different magnetic and dielectric properties of metallic Fe and sulfide phases (such as electrical conductivity: σFe = 1.04 × 105 S/cm (Devi et al., 2017), σFeO = 9.1 S/cm (Kashimura et al., 2012), σMagnetite = 1.0 × 10-3 S/cm (Kashimura et al., 2012), and σFeS = 2.0 × 101 S/cm (Kobayashi et al., 2001)) leads to a variation in microwave absorption, heating rate, and thermal expansion of these phases. Other researchers (Charikinya et al., 2015; Toifl et al., 2017) have also reported microwave-induced cracking of ores during the beneficiation process owing to the presence of high thermal stress during microwave treatment. Accordingly, thermal stress may result in the formation of a gap between different phases such as metallic iron/wüstite and metallic iron/iron sulfide interfaces; however, such separations are more preferred in the presence of sulfur because of a decrease in the surface energy and subsequently a decrease in the energy required for the void formation in wüstite/Fe interface (Grabke et al., 1991). Therefore, a higher reduction degree in the sulfur-contained sample is likely attributed to a decrease in surface energy by sulfur adsorption resulting in an enhancement of surface diffusion in the presence of sulfur (Grabke et al., 1991; Spreitzer and Schenk, 2019)."
7,Conclusions,"Effect of sulfur on hydrogen-reduction behavior of iron oxide during microwave heating was investigated using a multi-mode microwave generator at 1050 W and 2.45 GHz. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Different microwave absorption capability of metallic Fe, iron oxides, and iron sulfide phases results in a different thermal expansion in the phases during microwave heating which subsequently forms a gap between the reduced metallic iron and sulfur-contained iron oxide phases. (2) The gap between different phases enhances the hydrogen-reduction reaction during microwave treatment that is likely attributed to an improvement in the gas accessibility to un-reacted parts."
