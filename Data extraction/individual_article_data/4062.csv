0,Introduction,"Within the perspective of using hydrogen as a prominent energy carrier, a crucial issue is to find alternative production technologies based on other resources than fossil fuels. Besides water hydrolysis, still too energy demanding, using biomass as renewable feedstock would strongly contribute to decrease green house emissions, since the CO2 balance is neutral in this case. From a technical point of view, biomass resources (energy crops, agricultural residues, organic, forestry, industrial or municipal wastes) can be transformed into sustainable hydrogen by thermo chemical processes like gasification and pyrolysis [1–3], or biological processes like bio-photolysis, photo-fermentation or dark fermentation [4]. Among these various strategies, a lot of interest was devoted in the last decade to bio-oils, obtained by fast pyrolysis of biomass, as intermediate feedstock [5]. Bio-oils exhibit a complex composition with more than 200 different compounds, including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones as well as lignin derived oligomers emulsified with water [5,6]. Compared to other routes of biomass valorization, bio-oils offer a high flexibility in storage and transportation, which increases the economical efficiency with respect to its production and utilization [4,7]. Bio-oils can be treated directly as a crude feedstock [8] or using specific fractions. Thus, by adding water, bio-oils split up into two immiscible phases: (i) an aqueous phase containing carbohydrates-derived compounds and some light oxygenated compounds, which can be steam reformed to hydrogen and (ii) a hydrophobic phase formed mainly by aromatic and lignin derivatives [6]. Direct feeding of the crude bio-oil into a reformer reactor would avoid this primary separation processes, improving the overall energy yield. However, handling this crude feedstock is not straightforward, since bio-liquids are highly unstable upon heating and polymerize around 80–90°C. Up to now, most of the published studies have been limited to the catalytic steam reforming (SR) of oxygenated compounds such as acetic acid, hydroxy-acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, phenol, cresol or guaiacol among others, used as model compounds of bio-oils [9–17]. For catalytic processes, Ni-based materials have been mainly used [9,11–13], whereas only a few examples considering noble metals have been reported until now [14,15]. For the studies dedicated to SR of the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil, an hydrogen productivity close to 1.7mmolH2 gcat −1 min−1 was reported over Ni/α-AlO3 [6]. In the case of aqueous phase reforming of biomass-derived sugar type molecules (glucose and glycerol), a productivity close to 0.7mmolH2 gcat −1 min−1 was reached in the presence of Pt/α-Al2O3 at temperatures below 265°C [18], which is comparable to the performance achieved by enzymatic decomposition of sugars [19]. Recently, Rioche et al. [20] have reported the use of a crude bio-oil feedstock for catalytic steam reforming, using noble metal-based catalysts supported on alumina and on ceria-zirconia materials. Higher H2 yields were obtained with ceria-zirconia supported catalysts, indicating that the support plays an important role in the catalytic activity. In all these studies, the deactivation of the catalytic systems by carbon deposition was a major drawback to be solved for any process development. As an alternative to continuous steam reforming of oxygenated compounds aiming at a better management of carbon deposition, the sequential cracking/reforming process using fast pyrolysis crude bio-oil has been investigated in our laboratory [21]. This process alternates (i) a cracking reaction step in which the bio-oil is transformed into a gas mixture containing H2, CH4, C2+, CO and CO2 and (ii) a regeneration step allowing the combustion of the coke deposited during the cracking step. Ni-based catalysts have proved their good activity and stability in this sequential process [21]. In the present paper, the investigation of the sequential cracking/reforming of a crude bio-oil was continued, to get a better understanding of the complex mechanisms involved and to evaluate the impact of reactor configuration on performances. For this purpose, the specific role of the catalyst was evaluated by comparing carefully the conversion, selectivity, carbon, and oxygen balances either in the absence (thermal decomposition) or in the presence of catalysts. The thermodynamic equilibria, never reported before for crude bio-oils, were also calculated and compared to the experimental data. The impact of reactor/catalyst configuration was evaluated by testing the catalysts either as powders or supported onto a cordierite monolith. These materials were characterized before and after reaction. Platinum and rhodium catalysts supported on ceria-zirconia materials were selected as active catalytic phases, taking into account (i) the specificity of noble metals for minimizing coke formation and (ii) the capacity of ceria-zirconia support to meet the requirements of unsteady-state redox processes [22,23]. The heat balance of the sequential cracking/regeneration cycle was calculated in order to assess the possibility to run this process in an auto-thermal way. The sequential cracking process has been compared with continous steam reforming performed on the same catalytic systems, in terms of hydrogen productivity and gaseous products distribution."
1,Experimentals,
2,Bio-oil feedstock,"2.1 Bio-oil feedstock The crude bio-oil was produced by Biomass Technology Group (BTG) by fast pyrolysis of beech wood residues. It appears as a dark brown liquid with a strong smoky odour. According to literature, bio-oils consist in a complex mixture of about 200 oxygenated compounds [5]. The standard composition range is shown in Table 1 . The bio-oil also contains mineral impurities like chlorine, sulphur, and probably traces of metals like K, Mg, Ca (not analysed), as well as a high amount of water (28.8wt.%). Key physical and chemical properties of the bio-oil used are summarized in Table 2 . The analysed elemental composition corresponds to the average formula CH2.3O1.04 or CH1.32O0.54, whether the water contained in the bio-oil is accounted for or not, respectively."
3,Catalysts,"2.2 Catalysts The Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalysts were provided by Johnson Matthey as powders or coated on a cordierite monolith (20mm diameter, 17mm length and 1200cpsi). The average weight of coated monoliths was around 2g. The metal loading and the specific surface area of used catalytic samples are summarized in Table 3 . BET surface areas were calculated from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at −196°C (77K) using a multipoint method. In the case of monoliths, a specially designed cell was used to measure the surface area avoiding the monolith destruction. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study of the fresh, coked and regenerated powder catalysts was performed on a JEOL 2010 microscope (Resolution=0.19nm), with the addition of EDX and HAADF (High Angle Annular Dark Field) modules, whereas scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the fresh and coked monoliths was done on a Hitachi S800 microscope. Chemical analyses of catalysts were performed before and after reaction."
4,Reaction set up and product analysis,"2.3 Reaction set up and product analysis A double envelope stainless steel tubular reactor equipped with water-cooling system was designed to inject the cooled bio-oil through a PEEK capillary in down-stream regime on top of the hot catalyst. With this configuration, the bio-oil could be kept below 50°C avoiding its polymerization in the capillary during all the experiment. The bio-oil was sent with a syringe pump, at flow rates in the 1–15mLh−1 range. An automated two-position switch valve permitted to admit the bio-oil either into the reactor or in a collector vessel, providing a continuous flow of bio-oil through the injection lines to prevent any plugging. In steam-reforming tests, the reactor was equipped with a second capillary injector connected to a syringe pump for water introduction. The reactor free space was large enough to hold the catalyst either in the form of pellets or coated on a cordierite monolith. In order to restrict the heated zone to the catalyst bed, the oven consisted in a high-temperature heating tape winded tightly around the reactor. A thermocouple was used to monitor the temperature inside the catalyst bed. During the tests on monoliths, it was placed inside a central channel, in the first third of the monolith. Water and other condensable products were trapped in an ice-cooled condenser at the reactor outlet, allowing integral evaluation of water production/consumption over a given period on stream. The system was also equipped with a pressure sensor to check for any changes in the pressure drop. Negligible differences in pressure drop were observed between both monolith and powder catalyst configurations. In the case of blank experiments, the empty reactor was tested containing either a stainless steel porous disk used to support the powder catalysts or a raw piece of cordierite, in order to ensure a pressure drop similar to the one observed with a catalyst bed. The gaseous products obtained during the cracking and regeneration sequences were analysed with two HP6890 gas chromatographs in series, equipped with flame ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors. Three capillary columns allowed the quantitative analysis of oxygenated compounds (alcohols, acids, aldehydes, ketones, compounds up to C20), and C1–C5 hydrocarbons, and permanent gases (H2, CO, CO2, CH4). A mass spectrometer (VG-Prolab) with a closed ion source was also used to follow the transient experiments and to quantify the permanent gases. For water analysis, only few amounts were detected by mass spectrometer during the cracking/regeneration experiments, since practically all the water present in the outlet gaseous mixture was trapped in the condenser placed before MS and GC analysis system. Then, the mean concentration of water produced or consumed during the cracking and regeneration steps was quantified by weighting the amount collected in the cold trap during several reaction sequences."
5,Catalytic experiments,"2.4 Catalytic experiments The monolith (2.0g) or powder (0.6g) catalysts were reduced at 350°C under hydrogen (30vol.% of H2 in Ar, total flow=100mLmin−1) prior to catalytic activity measurements. In a standard experiment, the catalyst was heated at 700°C under an Ar flow of 100mLmin−1. The sequential cracking tests were carried out by alternating a cracking step, during which a bio-oil flow of 5mLh−1 (diluted in 100mLmin−1 of Ar) is injected during 5min, with a 10min regeneration step during which the carbon deposited on the catalyst is burnt under a flow of 20vol.% O2 in argon (total flow rate=100mLmin−1). These two steps were separated by a purge under 100mLmin−1 of Ar. Typically, 10–12 sequences have been carried out for each standard experiment. In order to study the catalytic stability, experiments with more than 30 sequences have been performed as well. The influence of reaction parameters on the catalytic behavior has been studied by varying the bio-oil flow rate (5–15mLh−1), the duration of the cracking step (5–15min) or of the regeneration step (5–15min) as well as the argon flow rate (100–300mLmin−1) during the cracking step. The activity of powder and monolithic catalysts was compared at similar flow rates. Two different ways to evaluate the influence of catalytic bed configuration are possible: (i) from the space velocity which depends on the total catalytic bed volume (5.3mL for monoliths and 0.5mL for powder samples), it can be inferred that the residence time was much higher (approximately 10 times) with the monoliths as compared to powders; (ii) considering only the active phase volume, the contact time was lower (approximately half time) with the monoliths as compared to powders. As will be discussed later, due to the strong coupling between gas phase and catalytic reactions and also due to the full conversion of the bio-oil even in the absence of catalyst, only the space velocity will be considered for comparing the data. Concerning the hydrodynamics in the monoliths, it was found from the Reynolds number value (Re <1) that the flow was laminar. From the Bo number and from L/D ratio (between the channel length and diameter) an axial dispersion model with a large deviation from the plug-flow can be assumed, which means that all the gas phase could react with the wash-coat."
6,Data analysis and treatment,"2.5 Data analysis and treatment The time dependence of the catalyst performance was evaluated in two ways: (i) during a single cracking step by checking the changes in the gas outlet composition and (ii) during series of cracking/regeneration sequences. The reactor outlet gas composition was continuously analysed by mass spectrometry (MS) during cracking and regeneration sequences, using standard calibration methods for quantification. In such a way, the instantaneous production of each gaseous component was measured. In addition, gas chromatography analyses (GC) were repeatedly performed at the end of the cracking steps. The GC results were calculated on an undiluted and dry basis, i.e., excluding water and carrier gas (argon), and were used for accurate analysis of the relative gas composition. In the case of sequential cracking, the H2 productivity was calculated either as the quantity of hydrogen produced (in mmol) per mass unit (in g) of bio-oil, or as hydrogen produced (in mmol) per time unit (in min) and mass unit (in g) of catalyst. The quantity of hydrogen was obtained by integration of the H2 mass signal from the beginning of a cracking/reforming step until the signal returns to the baseline. The hydrogen yield [Eq. (1)] was calculated as the ratio of hydrogen produced during a cracking/reforming sequence to the theoretical amount of hydrogen present in the bio-oil feed (including water), i.e., 1.15 H2 mol per bio-oil molar unit CH2.3O1.04N0.01. (1) H 2 yield ( % ) = moles of H 2 obtained moles of H 2 in bio-oil feed × 100 The carbon balance [Eq. (2)] was calculated as the ratio of the total C in gaseous (CO, CO2, CH4, C2+) and solid compounds formed during both cracking and regeneration steps (including traces of organics dissolved in the water trapped at the reactor outlet), to the amount of carbon introduced with the bio-oil feed during the cracking/reforming sequence. The carbon accumulated on the catalyst along the sequences and not burnt by regeneration was quantified by chemical analysis. (2) C balance = ( CO + C O 2 + C H 4 + C 2 + ) crack + ( CO + C O 2 ) regen + C liq + C cat carbon introduced as bio-oil during cracking × 100 The oxygen balance was evaluated by comparing the total amount of O in products (H2O, CO, CO2) formed over a whole cycle, to the amount of O introduced with the bio-oil feed during the cracking sequence, respectively. The amount of water collected during a single cracking step was calculated from the amount collected over a series of cycles in the outlet trap, large enough to be accurately weighted (no significant water production was observed during the regeneration steps, during which CO x were produced). (3) O balance = ( CO + C O 2 + C 2 + oxygenates ) crack + ( CO + C O 2 ) regen + H 2 O oxygen introduced as bio-oil during cracking × 100"
7,Heat balance calculations,"2.6 Heat balance calculations The heat balance was calculated using the HSC Chemistry software. For the cracking step, the input data corresponded to the simplified bio-oil composition given in Table 1 and adapted from literature reports, the relative ratio of the different compounds being adjusted to obtain a C:H:O ratio of 37.4:8.6:54.0 as close as possible to the real one (Table 2). Gaseous products – H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 – as well as solid C were introduced as output data. For regeneration step, the input data corresponded to the quantity of carbon burnt into CO and CO2 during the regeneration. The contribution of lattice oxygen from the ceria-zirconia support to the heat balance calculation was estimated to be negligible (below 7%)."
8,Results,
9,Catalytic performance on powder catalysts,"3.1 Catalytic performance on powder catalysts Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalysts were tested in powder form in the sequential cracking of biomass-derived oil at 700°C, by carrying out a series of cracking/purge/regeneration/purge consecutive sequences. A standard experiment consisted of 12 cracking/regeneration sequences, with a cracking step duration of 5min. The bio-oil conversion was total during the cracking steps, producing essentially H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and carbon deposits. Water vapour was considered both as a reactant contained in the bio-oil feed and as a product via the WGS equilibrium. Others sub-products were also detected, such as C2+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but only as traces. Fig. 1A and B (empty symbols) reports the changes in outlet gas distribution during the cracking steps over a series of sequences, calculated on a dry basis from the GC data. The amount of water is shown as an average value calculated from the amount collected after a series of sequences. The data are reported both for powder and monolithic samples. As revealed in Fig. 1, the H2 and CO concentrations over powder samples slightly decrease along the sequences. The CH4 concentration is stable on the platinum catalyst. On the rhodium catalyst the initial CH4 concentration is lower than that on platinum, but increases with the number of sequences, reaching the same value as on platinum. The CO2 concentration slightly increases in the case of rhodium, but more markedly for platinum. Fig. 2 (empty symbols) reports the corresponding H2, CO and CH4 productivities, as well as the evolution of the CO2/CO molar ratio over a series of 12 sequences. It should be noted that the data in Fig. 2 (MS data) are more dispersed than those in Fig. 1 (GC data). This feature can be related to the fact that the former are obtained by integration of the entire concentration profiles determined by MS while the latter correspond to the GC concentrations measured when the cracking profile reaches a steady-state value. The hydrogen productivity strongly decreases on the platinum-based catalyst along reaction sequences (Fig. 2A). In the same time, the CH4 and CO productivities slightly decrease (Fig. 2A), whereas the CO2/CO molar ratio increases from 1.39 to 2.24 during the experiment (Fig. 2C). The strong decrease in hydrogen productivity reveals a strong catalytic deactivation, despite the periodic regeneration of the catalyst. On the contrary, H2, CH4 and CO gas productivities remain stable on Rh powder sample, whereas a slight decay in the CO2/CO molar ratio, mainly at the end of sequences, is observed (Fig. 2B and C, respectively). The gaseous products profile corresponding to a single cracking/regeneration sequence, using the Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 powder samples, is illustrated in Fig. 3A and B, respectively. For the Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 system (Fig. 3A), the hydrogen production increases continuously during the cracking step, till reaching a maximum of 41mLmin−1, then it decreases slightly before the end of the cracking step. The first product to appear at the beginning of the cracking step when the concentration of hydrogen is still very low is CO2. The CO2 production stabilizes rapidly at ca. 15mLmin−1 over the whole step. CO and CH4 formation slightly increases during the cracking step, reaching a maximum of 11 and 4mLmin−1, respectively. These different dynamics between CO and CO2 formation lead to a CO2/CO ratio strongly decreasing from ca. 6 at an early stage of the cracking step to 1.5 at the end. During the regeneration step, i.e., as soon as oxygen is admitted onto the catalyst, an immediate formation of carbon oxides is observed, mainly consisting in CO2, the oxygen being fully consumed. After about 7min, the CO2 concentration is practically back to its background level and gaseous O2 is detected again at the reactor outlet. In the case of the Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 powder catalyst (Fig. 3B), the H2 flow rate increases initially more rapidly than in the case of Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, up to a maximum production of ca. 44mLmin−1. However, after a few minutes of cracking the hydrogen production decreases, revealing a fast deactivation phenomenon. In the first half of this cracking step, the formation of carbon oxides (∼15mLmin−1) and methane (∼4mLmin−1) is very similar to that observed in the case of platinum. However, in the second half of the cracking step, a significant decrease in carbon oxides production is observed as well. The catalyst regeneration by coke combustion needs slightly more time than in the case of platinum (about 8min versus 7min)."
10,Monolithic catalysts,"3.2 Monolithic catalysts The outlet gas products compositions obtained by sequential cracking of bio-oil over Pt/and Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported on monoliths are shown in Fig. 1A and B (full symbols). The hydrogen concentration is practically stable around 50vol.% for both catalytic systems, i.e., a value close to that observed for powder systems. Meanwhile the methane formed is less than 7vol.%, similar to that obtained on powder catalysts. A first difference between monolithic and powder catalysts consists in a much higher CO concentration, leading to a much lower CO2/CO molar ratio as observed in Fig. 2C. This effect is more marked on Pt than on Rh monoliths. Note also that in Pt catalytic systems (Fig. 2C), the CO2/CO molar ratio tends to increase along the sequences, due to both the slow decay in CO formation and to the CO2 increase with the number of sequences. Finally, similar amounts of H2O are trapped at the reactor outlet, either with powder or monolithic systems. A second important difference between powder and monolithic systems is that H2 productivity (mmolmin−1 gcat −1) on monoliths is about two times higher than for powder samples, for both Pt- and Rh-based catalysts (Fig. 2A and B). The gaseous products stream profile obtained on the platinum impregnated monolith during one cracking-regeneration sequence is shown in Fig. 4A. The hydrogen production starts rapidly after admission of the bio-oil onto the monolith, reaching a maximum of ca. 38mLmin−1. H2 is then produced continuously at a constant level all along the cracking step. As stated before, a high amount of CO is formed, while CH4 production is always lower than 5mLmin−1. As already observed on powder catalysts, the CO2 profile in Fig. 4A and B presents an initial spike (maximum of 15mLmin−1) at the beginning of the cracking step, and then decreases and stabilises at a level of ca. 10mLmin−1. The main difference with the profile obtained on powder catalyst (Fig. 3A) is that a maximum gas production is rapidly reached and remains stable within the whole cracking step. To check the possibility of a stable production of hydrogen over monolith systems during long time periods, the cracking step was extended to 10 and 15min. As shown in Fig. 4B, the hydrogen production is stable all along the sequence at a level of 42mLmin−1 for 10min cracking. The same stability is observed when the cracking duration is extended to 15min. It must be noted, however, that longer cracking steps implies longer regeneration times. Thus, after 5min of cracking the coke is fully burnt after about 5.8min of regeneration (Fig. 4A), whereas after 10min cracking (Fig. 4B), the regeneration requires 11min. The gas stream profile obtained on Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 monolith during one standard sequence (5min cracking and 10min regeneration) is shown in Fig. 5 . The hydrogen production is practically instantaneous and is rapidly stabilized at a level of ca. 40mLmin−1. The CO, CO2 and CH4 profiles are similar to what was found for the platinum monolithic catalyst. Compared to the rhodium powder sample (Fig. 3B), the monolithic configuration allows a much more stable gas production."
11,Blank tests,"3.3 Blank tests Several experiments were carried out in the absence of catalyst, either over a porous stainless steel disk or on a raw piece of cordierite. The related performances are reported in Table 4 , together with the results obtained in the presence of catalysts (powders and monoliths). In the absence of catalyst, the bio-oil is also fully converted, H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 being the main gaseous products (Fig. 6A and B). However, either with a stainless steel disk or with a raw monolith, the hydrogen productivity is much lower than in the presence of catalyst (Table 4). The hydrogen formation is not constant along the cracking reaction. The regeneration step reveals a strong CO2 formation, while no CO was detected. With the stainless steel disk, the coke deposited during the cracking reaction is only partially burnt, since at the end of the regeneration step CO2 is still detected. In contrast, the bio-oil is converted on the raw monolith with a significantly lower coke formation, as revealed by the regeneration process where complete coke combustion occurred."
12,Thermodynamic equilibrium,"3.4 Thermodynamic equilibrium The gas composition at thermodynamic equilibrium was calculated using the HSC Chemistry software, assuming a simplified bio-oil composition (Table 1) adapted from literature reports. The relative concentration of the different components in the mixture was adjusted to obtain a C:H:O ratio of 37.4:8.6:54.0 as close as possible to the real one (Table 2). The products gas composition at the thermodynamic equilibrium is drawn in Fig. 7A and the values obtained in the temperature range of 600–800°C are summarized in Table 4. Between 600 and 700°C, the H2 concentration remains constant at a level of ca. 55%, whereas the CH4 concentration decreases from 11 to 4%. The carbon monoxide formation strongly increases with increasing temperature, while the reverse is observed for CO2. This indeed corresponds to the WGS equilibrium, which is shifted to higher CO formation at high temperatures, as it will be discussed later. However, considerable amounts of carbon are produced along the process (Fig. 7)."
13,Physico-chemical characterisation of catalysts,"3.5 Physico-chemical characterisation of catalysts In this section, the structural and/or morphological changes of the catalysts induced by (i) coke deposition (cracking step) and (ii) coke burning (regeneration step) were determined, in order to evaluate the reversible and irreversible impact of the process on the catalysts evolution. Carbon deposition was analysed in two different ways: (a) by quantifying the amount of reversibly deposited carbon after a cracking sequence (from the amount of CO x recovered during the regeneration sequence as well as by chemical analysis) and (b) by quantifying the amount of irreversible carbon which remains on the catalyst after regeneration, by chemical analysis. This carbon analysis was also supported by the carbon balance obtained over a complete sequence (see Section 2). 3.5.1 Powder samples The effect of coke deposition after a series of eight cracking/regeneration sequences is to decrease the initial surface area by 80%. This surface is partially restored after regeneration, leading to an irreversible surface loss of about 56% (Table 5 ). The loss of surface area is similar for both Pt and Rh powder catalysts. Chemical analyses reveal that larger C amounts are stored on the Rh catalyst compared to Pt, but this carbon is practically totally burnt after regeneration. TEM measurements performed on fresh and regenerated catalysts (Fig. 8 ) show that the irreversible loss of surface area is due to agglomeration/coalescence of the ceria-zirconia particles after use. In turn the reversible loss of surface is assigned to coke deposition (pore plugging). Despite the strong sintering of the support, no detectable loss of noble metals is observed after several cracking/regeneration cycles (see Table 5). TEM micrographs of the platinum catalyst, before and after several reaction sequences (Fig. 9A and B), show platinum particles with size around 1–2nm, corresponding to a dispersion close to 100%. There is no significant change in the Pt particle size in the used catalyst (Fig. 9B). 3.5.2 Monolithic samples The loss of surface area observed for monoliths after a series of cracking sequences is similar to that observed for powder samples (Table 6 ), the irreversible part being also assigned to the coalescence of ceria-zirconia support. The important amount of deposited carbon measured onto the Pt monolithic catalyst after the cracking step (about 13wt.%) can easily be removed during regeneration since only a small fraction remains after regeneration, this amount being little dependent on the number of cracking/regeneration sequences (Table 6). Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) studies performed on the monoliths before and after reaction (Figs. 10 and 11 ) reveal the presence of a thick carbon film at the channels inlet on both Pt and Rh catalysts. In addition, the Pt catalyst also presents small accumulations of carbon filaments, detected in the monolith channels after cracking. No Pt loss from the monolith is observed after a series of at least eight sequences (see Table 6)."
14,"Carbon, oxygen, and heat balances","3.6 Carbon, oxygen, and heat balances 3.6.1 C and O balances The carbon mass balance obtained in the presence of catalyst is close to 100% for monolithic catalysts, the slight ∼6% deficit being due mainly to some carbon deposition along the reactor walls and thermocouple, not accounted for in the calculation. It should be mentioned that traces of oxygenated compounds were also observed on some chromatograms, among which acetone was identified but not quantified. In the case of powder samples, this deficit is significantly higher (∼15%). The same trends are observed in the absence of catalyst (Table 7 ). Table 8 presents the oxygen balance for the cracking and regeneration steps in the presence of catalysts. Despite a much higher uncertainty due to the difficult quantification of water during the sequential process, it can be noted that over the whole cracking–purge–regeneration sequence, the O balance is correctly equilibrated. However, the latter appears slightly in excess during the cracking step, especially for the powder samples, whereas the reverse is observed during the regeneration step. An oxygen storage/release effect of the ceria-zirconia support might originate that trend, as will be discussed later. 3.6.2 Heat balance The heat balance was estimated from reaction enthalpy calculations as described in Section 2.6. For one sequence, the reaction enthalpy for cracking/reforming on the catalyst sample in powder form was found to be +1.22kJ which corresponds to ∼3kJg−1 bio-oil. During the regeneration, the reaction enthalpy for the combustion of the deposited carbon was found to be −1.35kJ (∼−27kJg−1 C). In the case of the monolithic catalysts, the reaction enthalpy during the regeneration was −1.18kJ, due to lower carbon deposition. Therefore, the heat generated by coke combustion can easily compensate the endothermicity of the cracking/reforming reaction, which might lead to an auto-thermal process, provided this heat is efficiently managed."
15,Discussion,
16,Overall mechanism of cracking/reforming reaction,"4.1 Overall mechanism of cracking/reforming reaction The catalytic cracking/reforming of a crude bio-oil derived from biomass was successfully performed as a sequential process, since (i) the bio-oil was completely converted, hydrogen being the main reaction product with a high yield and (ii) the conditions for stable operation were determined. Taking into account that the conversion of bio-oil is complete either in the absence or in the presence of catalyst, but with major changes in selectivity, the co-existence of thermal and catalytic processes is revealed. Thermal decomposition is easily achieved at 700°C due to the instability of bio-oil components. However, this non-catalytic decomposition leads to large amount of carbon (soot-like) deposition. Therefore, it can be considered that even in the presence of catalyst, the bio-organic molecules are firstly cracked to smaller gas molecules and soot by the thermal reaction in the hot zone preceding the catalytic one, before undergoing a catalytic process. The primary products are H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C n H n+2 and C x H y O z (n and x values being between 2 and 3) and soot-like carbon. After this first thermal cracking, catalytic reactions take place on the active metal sites of the catalyst, or at the metal–support interface (Schemes 1 and 2 ). The most important secondary catalytic reactions are: (a) cracking of small hydrocarbons (C2, C3); (b) cracking of small oxygenated compounds (C x H y O z ); (c) steam and dry (with CO2) reforming of hydrocarbons, including CH4; (d) steam reforming of oxygenated compounds (C x H y O z ); (e) WGS equilibration, CO+H2O=H2 +CO2; (f) Boudouard reaction, 2CO=C+CO2; and (g) carbon (soot-like) gasification via steam or dry (with CO2) reforming. Other possible catalytic reactions such as hydrogenation of CO into CH4 are not favored under our reaction conditions, but cannot be ruled out in case of cold spots within the reacting zone. As seen from Table 4 comparing blank and catalytic tests, Pt and Rh noble metal supported catalysts play a crucial role in ensuring a constant hydrogen production and lowering CH4 and CO production. Both metals have proved their high activity in steam reforming and WGS reactions. Quantitatively, the use of catalyst enhances the hydrogen productivity from 11 to 16mmolH2 gbio-oil −1 (increase of ∼40%), the hydrogen production stabilizing along the overall cracking step. Meanwhile, CH4 concentration is lowered from 11 to 6%. This reduction of methane formation is related to the capacity of the catalyst to perform the steam reforming of methane in the presence of water contained in the bio-oil. As seen above, carbon deposition (ranging from soot-like to amorphous and graphite) takes place in both thermal and catalytic cracking processes, these deposits being superior in the former case. One of the most important roles of the catalyst during cracking is to promote the gasification of thermal carbon deposits by steam reforming, using water from the reaction medium. The catalyst also ensures an efficient removal of carbon during the regeneration step: the coke, mostly amorphous, formed during the cracking process is almost completely combusted, both thermally and catalytically. The residual amount on the catalyst was found little dependent on the number of applied sequences (Table 6). In such a way, the catalyst not only favors the regeneration of the active sites, but also limits any long-term accumulation of carbon deposits which might be detrimental to the catalytic stability and lifetime."
17,Influence of catalyst active phase and support upon aging,"4.2 Influence of catalyst active phase and support upon aging As seen in Section 3, the hydrogen production and the gaseous product composition depend on the nature of the catalyst active phase (Pt or Rh). In the case of Pt-based powder catalyst, the H2 production strongly decreases while the CO2 production increases (also shown by the CO2/CO ratio increase), by increasing the number of sequences. In the case of rhodium-based system, both H2 and CO2 production remains stable. In the case of platinum, the progressive increase of CO2 along the sequences cannot be assigned to WGS displacement, since the production of H2 decreases in the meantime. Another explanation could be related to a combined effect of the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the ceria-zirconia support and the change in catalyst surface structure upon aging. Ceria-zirconia solid solutions are known for their high OSC and resistance to thermal and redox aging, keeping a constant oxygen storage capacity after several redox and calcination cycles at high temperatures [24,25]. As shown in Table 8, the excess and deficit of the oxygen balance for the respective cracking and regeneration steps, strongly suggest an oxygen storage effect of the support. Another evidence of this phenomenon is the enhanced formation of CO2 at the beginning of the cracking sequence, before the hydrogen starts to be produced. This is related to the reaction between the oxygen stored in the support with the primary cracking products or with the carbon (soot) formed at the beginning of the cracking step. To summarize, the ceria-zirconia support ensures a large part of the CO2 production during the cracking step. However, since the similar progressive coalescence of the support is evidenced for both Pt and Rh catalysts with time on stream, the fact that the Pt-based system continuously deactivates while the Rh one remains stable should be related to a different behavior of metal particles on the ceria-zirconia support. Many authors have described the particular interactions between noble metals and ceria (SMSI effect), which lead upon redox cycling at high temperature (>600°C) to the decoration of metals by a thin ceria layer [26]. The same phenomenon takes place on ceria-zirconia supports, which can lead to metal encapsulation in the support [27,28]. HREM studies of NM/CeO2 (NM=Pt, Rh) catalyst reveal different metal behaviors: under similar conditions, Rh particles are more covered by ceria than Pt (70% versus 30%) [26]. This is also observed on ceria-zirconia supports: upon high-temperature redox aging ending by an oxidizing cycle, Rh and Pd show comparable encapsulation, this phenomenon being less important in the case of Pt [29]. This can be related to the lower oxidability of Pt compared to Rh and Pd: whereas Rh and Pd are fully oxidized into Rh2O3 or PdO under oxidizing conditions, there is no bulk oxidation of Pt particles, which remains limited to surface oxidation [30,31]. This also leads to a different behavior towards sintering: Rh undergoes re-dispersion at high T (900°C) by spreading of the oxidized Rh phase onto the support [32]. In contrast, Pt is more sensitive to sintering than Rh [33], a strongly bimodal Pt distribution being evidenced after reoxidation (very large Pt particles, up to 1μm, co-exist with small ones) [26]. Although our TEM observations did not reveal the presence of large platinum particles in the used catalyst, we cannot totally exclude their existence, because it is difficult to differentiate them from the support. Other authors suggest that redox aging of platinum on ceria-zirconia can lead to the formation of atomically dispersed Pt oxidized species embedded in support lattice [28,34]. Therefore, the slow Pt deactivation observed in our sequential cracking experiments could be related either to an important sintering of metal upon redox cycling or, much more likely, to a progressive and irreversible encapsulation of platinum particles with ceria-zirconia. In contrast, the Rh particles accessibility would be kept more stable, being re-dispersed at each redox cycle. The consequence of this aging process for Pt-based system on the product distribution is illustrated in Scheme 2: upon aging and ceria decoration (or particle embedment), the number of active Pt sites (responsible for H2 and CO production) decreases while the flux of oxygen provided by the support towards the metal particles (responsible for CO2 production) remains unchanged. This effect results in the observed changes in hydrogen productivity and CO2/CO selectivity with time on stream. For the case of rhodium, such an aging process does not occur as mentioned above."
18,Powder versus monolith catalysts,"4.3 Powder versus monolith catalysts 4.3.1 Selectivity effects The gas production stream profile during the cracking sequences reveals a significant difference between the two catalyst configurations (Figs. 3–5). On monoliths, the hydrogen production reaches quickly the maximum, being constant all along the cracking sequence, which is not the case when powder catalysts were used. The carbon oxides formation is strongly dependent on the reactor/catalyst configuration, while the hydrogen and methane production in the gaseous product stream is similar. Thus, on monolith supported catalysts, a significantly higher amount of CO is formed, while the CO2 production is lower. The CO2 and CO compositions obtained on monoliths are actually much closer to the thermodynamic equilibrium composition (Table 4, Fig. 7) than on powder samples. This difference in CO/CO2 selectivity might be due to the fact that the longer residence times on monoliths will allow the syngas formed in the gas phase to be more easily equilibrated by WGS on the catalyst coating. This leads to a higher CO production as predicted under the prevailing conditions. 4.3.2 Stability effects For powder catalysts, a marked deactivation occurs within each cracking step. This deactivation phenomenon can be related to a rapid soot accumulation on top of the powder catalyst bed that blocks the bio-oil molecules before they get in contact with the catalyst. In contrast, the monolithic reactor configuration ensures a much more stable gaseous production during the cracking steps which can be extended up to 15min without any catalyst deactivation. Moreover, the cracking/regeneration cycles were repeated up to 32 times with the same stability and a high reproducibility. Thus, the monolith configuration has a strong impact on both thermal and catalytic reactions. First, the empty space in the reactor is much lower, which limits thermal reactions leading to soot formation. Secondly, this reactor configuration ensures a better gasification of soot and more efficient conversion of small intermediate gaseous molecules, due to a higher residence time therefore a better interaction between the gas phase and the active phase. Note however, that the higher hydrogen productivity (per g of catalyst) observed on monolith should be considered with care. As a matter of fact, due to the complete conversion of the bio-oil even in the absence of catalysts, any quantification of the specific activity (per catalyst mass unit) cannot be considered as a relevant indicator for comparing two systems that are not run under strict catalytic regime. Therefore, this difference in productivity could come either from a larger residence time on monolith, or from the simple fact that there is two times less catalyst on monoliths. This evaluation is provided only as a trend to compare our results with literature data. In contrast, the productivity calculated per g of bio-oil remains the best indicator for evaluating the efficiency of the tested systems, as used in the next section. The detrimental effect of the exothermic regeneration step on catalysts stability also deserves some comments. As a matter of fact, the catalyst temperature must be kept at a reasonable level during the regeneration step by avoiding too long cracking sequences leading to overloading of carbon deposits. Under the prevailing conditions, by keeping the cracking steps below 15min the catalyst temperature remains below 800°C during the regeneration, which prevents any major metal sintering. Indeed, a further improved heat management by using suitable support materials (e.g., SiC or metallic monoliths) might be considered for scaling up the process. Therefore, the monolith reactor configuration appears more adapted to ensure a stable hydrogen production for fuel cells such as MCFC. The idea of the sequential cracking process for feeding a fuel cell is to combine two reactors that alternate the cracking and regeneration processes in order to obtain a continuous hydrogen production. Therefore, apart from the need for a constant hydrogen flow, another important aspect concerns the duration of regeneration step, which should preferably not exceed the duration of cracking. As shown in Fig. 4B with the Pt monolithic catalyst, even when the regeneration is as long as the cracking reaction, the coke was almost fully burnt. This regeneration step could be further optimised in order to match the technical requirements of two alternating reactors."
19,Comparison with the steam-reforming process,"4.4 Comparison with the steam-reforming process Continuous steam reforming of hydrocarbons is the most industrialised process for hydrogen production, since it gives the highest hydrogen yield compared with other reactions, such as dry reforming or partial oxidation. In order to compare the performances achieved by steam reforming and by sequential cracking processes, H2 productivities obtained for the same type of catalysts are presented in Fig. 12 as a function of S/C ratio. The values corresponding to S/C between 2.5 and 10 are obtained by steam reforming over monolithic Pt and Rh-based close systems at 700°C under similar operating conditions [35]. By decreasing the S/C ratio from 10 to 2.5, the H2 productivities observed regularly decrease from about 40 to 21mmolH2 gbio-oil −1 with both Pt and Rh catalysts (Fig. 12). The productivities obtained by sequential cracking correspond to the S/C value of 0.5, i.e., to the molar ratio between water and carbon in crude bio-oil (17 and 18mmolH2 gbio-oil −1, for Pt and Rh, respectively). It can be seen that these values perfectly fit with the regular decrease of H2 productivity when decreasing S/C. At this temperature, the hydrogen productivity obtained under cracking conditions is the closest one to the equilibrium composition. Generally speaking, the use of sequential cracking allows to directly process bio-oils without water addition, and therefore requires lower energy consumption (vaporization step not necessary). Heat balance performed during cracking (endothermic) and regeneration (exothermic) showed that the process could, in principle, run auto-thermally, provided the heat of carbon combustion is efficiently recovered. In addition, the separate step of catalyst regeneration allows a better control of coke combustion and catalytic long-term catalytic deactivation. Further improvements are continuously done in sequential cracking process to reach the MCFC [36] required specifications by decreasing CO (<18%) and CH4 (<5%) levels."
20,Conclusions,"(i) Sequential cracking process has been successfully applied to hydrogen production from crude bio-oil. (ii) Both thermal decomposition and catalytic reactions contribute to the overall bio-oil conversion to syngas; the catalyst plays a major role in improving the bio-oil gasification and in controlling the coke deposition and removal. (iii) The initial hydrogen productivity was similar on Pt- and Rh-based catalysts. However, a significant deactivation of platinum was observed with time on stream (increasing number of sequences), especially for the powder catalyst. (iv) Despite an important sintering of the ceria-zirconia support under redox cycling, the oxygen storage capacity improves the carbon gasification during the cracking step and contributes to its removal during regeneration, leading essentially to CO2 formation for both steps. (v) The reactor configuration (powder or monolith) has a strong influence on the stability of gaseous production during the cracking steps. The stable and constant hydrogen production observed on monolith has been related to a better soot gasification. (vi) Heat balance calculations suggest that the sequential cracking process could operate auto-thermally. Taking into account that no water addition is needed, this appears as a decisive advantage compared to the continuous steam reforming of bio-oil. Hydrogen productivities correspond to the low steam-to-carbon ratio imposed by the bio-oil composition."
