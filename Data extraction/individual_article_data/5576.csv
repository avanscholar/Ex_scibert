0,Introduction,"Excessive alcohol consumption leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a major cause of alcohol induced mortality and morbidity. Fatty liver, the earliest stage of the ALD, is characterized by the accumulation of lipid in the form of triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol esters (Gao and Bataller, 2011; Kim et al., 2014b). Continued alcohol abuse can drive it into advanced stage of ALD such as steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and superimposed hepatocellular carcinoma (Altamirano and Bataller, 2011). Alcoholic fatty liver has long been associated with increased lipid peroxidation, increased oxidative stress, stimulated lipogenesis and inhibited fatty acid oxidation (Gao and Bataller, 2011; Tang et al., 2013). Therefore, treatment approaches to regulate lipid metabolism and to prevent subsequent development of ALD are of great clinical and economic interest. Alcohol metabolism into acetaldehyde in hepatocytes mostly involves the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and the acetaldehyde is then oxidized into acetate with the help of enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 in mitochondria (Zakhari, 2006). However, the CYP2E1 is known to be particularly important in chronic or excessive alcohol consumption (Ghazali and Patel, 2016). Major interest in CYP2E1 lies in its potential to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in EtOH oxidation causing lipid peroxidation (Lu and Cederbaum, 2008), which results in the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and, eventually, in alcoholic fatty liver (Lu et al., 2008). Thus, controlling excessive ROS production and the depletion of glutathione (GSH) like anti-oxidant during fatty liver development would blunt alcohol-induced oxidative stress and prevent the pathogenesis of fatty liver (Aljomah et al., 2015; Cederbaum, 2012). Therefore, targeting lipogenesis mechanisms offers a great promise for the treatment of alcohol-induced fatty liver. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator sensing oxidative stress that plays a key role in controlling fat metabolism. Once activated, AMPK increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases lipogenesis (Tang et al., 2013). In ethanol fed rodents, however, AMPK activity is decreased, which exhibits a significant role in developing fatty liver. This decreased AMPK activity causes alcohol-induced fatty liver changes through decreased fatty acid oxidation and increased fatty acid synthase (FAS) like lipogenesis related protein expression (Rui et al., 2016; Tomita et al., 2005) signifying the potential of AMPK as a therapeutic target in alcohol-induced fatty liver. Alcohol exposure also enhances the hepatic expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). TNF-α increases the sterol regulatory element-binding protein expression in hepatocytes, which in turn exerts a deleterious effect through the activation of fatty acid biosynthesis by FAS and fatty acid desaturation by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Louvet and Mathurin, 2015). This sums up that the expression of cytokine TNF-α creates an alternative mechanism to cause steatosis (Beier and McClain, 2010). In support of this, TNFR1 knockout mice displayed the protection from alcohol-induced fatty liver (Yin et al., 2001). Meanwhile, in alcohol-induced steatosis, lipid droplets accumulate in hepatocytes, which can be characterized by the expression of lipid droplet proteins, particularly perilipins (Okumura, 2011). Among five perilipin proteins, perilipin-2 is a cytoplasmic lipid droplet coat protein implicated in fatty liver, a well-known biomarker of fatty liver (Libby et al., 2016). Thus, agents inactivating perilipins might be useful as anti-steatosis medications. Despite its heavy economic and health burden, there is no effective drug to manage ALD at present and demand is high for natural products as an alternative strategy. Sasa quelpaertensis (Jeju dwarf bamboo) is an edible, endemic perennial plant distributed in the area surrounding Mt. Halla in Jeju island, South Korea (Kim et al., 2013). Sasa leaves have been used in traditional medicine due to their anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and diuretic properties (Bae, 2000). Young leaves of S. quelpaertensis are used in a popular bamboo tea, for their beneficial health effects on lipid metabolism from long time ago (Kang et al., 2012). The culm and leaves of S. quelpaertensis Nakai is popular and longtime used in oriental medicine as a treatment in liver disease (Lee et al., 2008). Further, bamboo is used in traditional medicine as bamboo salt which was developed by Korean doctors and monks almost 1000 years before for various illnesses and potent for detoxifying liver (Shin et al., 2003). It is also well known for potent medicinal properties such as anti-obesity (Kang et al., 2012; Patra et al., 2015), antioxidant and anti-inflammation (Kim et al., 2012), regulating microbial dysbiosis (Yeom et al., 2016) and preventing cardiovascular complications (Ryou et al., 2012). Furthermore, S. quelpaertensis Nakai and its p-coumaric acid are reported to show protective effect against alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity via downregulating aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in serum, hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and for anti-oxidant defense by elevated expression of GSH in alcohol-induced mice (Lee et al., 2008). Recently, an in vitro model of hepatic steatosis revealed their potent protective effect against oleic acid induced lipid accumulation in hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells (Kim et al., 2013). Interestingly, a previous study reported their modulatory effect on lipid metabolism in non-alcohol-induced liver disease model (Kim et al., 2014a). However, the effect of S. quelpaertensis against alcohol-induced fatty liver is remained unexamined. In this study, we examined the protective capacity of S. quelpaertensis Nakai leaf extract against alcohol induced fatty liver development. Our results showed that phenolic acid and flavonoid-rich ethyl acetate fraction of S. quelpaertensis extract exhibited cytoprotective effect against alcohol induced toxicity in HepG2 cells. Further, S. quelpaertensis decreased the ROS formation in alcohol metabolism and exhibited anti-steatosis effect via the activation of AMPK pathway in alcohol challenged livers."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of Bamboo extracts,"2.1 Preparation of Bamboo extracts Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai leaves purchased from Jeju Plant Resource Lab in 2015 at dry condition were pulverized into 1 mm fine powder to increase the surface area. Then, S. quelpaertensis Nakai leaf extract was obtained by dissolving pulverized S. quelpaertensis leaf shards with 100 mL of 80% (v/v) EtOH in ultrasonic bath (Power sonic 520, Hwashin Co., Korea) for 90 min. The extraction process was carried out in triplicate to maximize the yield. The solution was filtered by Whatman No. 2 filtering paper (Whatman International Limited, Kent, England) and dried by using a rotary vacuum evaporator (Hei-VAP Precision, Heidolph, Germany). The crude extract was suspended by distilled water, and partitioned into n-hexane (SQH), chloroform (SQC), ethyl acetate (SQEA), n-butanol (SQB, water-saturated BuOH), and distilled water (SQA) fractions. The extract and partitioned fractions were stored at − 20 °C until further analysis."
3,High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of phenolic acid and flavonoid,"2.2 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of phenolic acid and flavonoid HPLC analysis was performed on a Prominence ultra-fast liquid chromatograph system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a pump (Model L-2160U), UV detector (Model L-2400U), autosampler (Model L-2200), temperature-controlled column compartment (Model L-2350U) and a degasser module. EZ Chrom Elite System Manager was used for instrument control and data acquisition. Separation was performed on a reverse phase Triat C18 ExRS analytical column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, YMC, Kyoto, Japan) at 40 °C."
4,Cell culture,"2.3 Cell culture The HepG2 cells obtained from Korean cell line bank were cultured in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks (SPL Life sciences, Korea) containing Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics cocktail of 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 U/mL of streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies, NY, USA)) and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber."
5,Cell viability measurement,"2.4 Cell viability measurement The effect of different solvent fractions on cell viability of HepG2 cells was measured by Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described (Sun et al., 2011). HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104/well cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Then, we first treated the incubated cells with varying concentrations (0, 3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 µg/mL) of different solvent fractions (SQA, SQB, SQC, SQEA, SQH) from 80% EtOH extract of S. quelpaertensis Nakai leaf separately to evaluate their cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells. Afterwards, we evaluated their cytoprotective effect on EtOH exposed HepG2 cells. In brief, HepG2 cells were treated with varying concentrations (0, 3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 µg/mL) of different solvent fractions (SQA, SQB, SQC, SQEA, SQH) and 400 mM ethanol simultaneously. Cells were incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 15 µL for 24 and 48 h, respectively. After incubation, 5 µL of MTT (5 mg/mL of stock, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. The absorbance of the formazan crystals dissolved in 100 µL/well of solubilization buffer (10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 50% dimethyl formamide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich)) was measured at 540 nm by immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader."
6,Propidium iodide (PI) staining assay,"2.5 Propidium iodide (PI) staining assay The percentage of apoptotic sub-G1 cells in ethanol exposed HepG2 cells was measured by PI staining as previously described (Yao et al., 2011). Briefly, HepG2 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates, allowed to grow for 12 h and then exposed to different concentrations of SQEA (0, 250, 500 µg/mL) in the presence of ethanol (400 mM) at 37 °C, 95% humidity and 5% CO2. Cells were washed in ice cold Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and fixed with 70% EtOH at 4 °C for 15 min and re-suspended in PBS containing 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution. After centrifugation, cells were incubated with a solution containing 100 μg/mL of PI (Sigma) and 100 μg/mL of ribonuclease A for 30 min. Sub-G1 cell population was assessed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA)."
7,Experimental Animals and treatments,"2.6 Experimental Animals and treatments C57BL/6 mice (8–9 weeks) weighing 20–25 g were purchased from Orientbio Inc. (Sungnam, Korea) and housed in conventional cages with constant temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and humidity (50 ± 10%). Mice were supplied with an NIH-07 approved diet and cared according to the guidelines of Institutional Ethical Committee of Jeju National University. Ethanol challenge was performed according to the binge drinking model (Song et al., 2006). Mice were allocated to five groups: healthy control, EtOH only and three EtOH/SQEA groups of different SQEA treatment dose. Mice in healthy control group received DPBS and mice in the EtOH group received EtOH (5 g/kg body weight (BW)) orally at every 12 h for 3 times. Three EtOH/SQEA groups received SQEA of respective doses 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg BW simultaneously with EtOH along the administration schedule of EtOH only group. At 4 h after the final administration, mice were sacrificed and blood and liver samples were collected."
8,Histopathological analysis of liver,"2.7 Histopathological analysis of liver Mice liver sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and carefully embedded in paraffin. The paraffin blocks were sliced into 3 µm thickness sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess the histopathological changes in the liver. Stained sections were observed under a fluorescent microscope and images of representative section areas were obtained using Olympus DP-72 microscope camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)."
9,Measurement of blood alcohol content,"2.8 Measurement of blood alcohol content Mice were anesthetized and blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture with heparinized syringes. The serum was separated after centrifuging at 1200 rpm for 10 min and the ethanol content was assayed by ethanol assay kit (Megazyme International Ireland, Bray, Co., Wicklow, Ireland) according to manufacturer’s instructions."
10,Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay,"2.9 Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay Lipid peroxidation of liver was assessed as previously described (Patro et al., 2002) with minor modifications. Liver tissues were homogenized using taco™Prep bead beater (GeneReach Biotechnology Co., Taichung city, Taiwan) in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris; pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin). After centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was separated to measure the protein concentration by Bradford protein assay method. Proteins were mixed with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubated in ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. Resulting supernatant was reacted with equal volume of 0.67% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid (TBA, 0.67% (w/v) solution in 50 mM TBA) in a heating block for 10 min. After centrifuging at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, the absorbance of supernatant was measured at the wavelength of 532 nm using ELISA plate reader. Standard curve of malondialdehyde (MDA) was used to acquire the formation of MDA-equivalents in liver tissues."
11,Determination of hepatic glutathione (GSH),"2.10 Determination of hepatic glutathione (GSH) GSH is an intracellular thiol which has a low molecular weight and plays an important role in cellular defense against oxidative stress in mammalian cells. GSH level in liver tissue homogenates was assayed using a commercial colorimetric assay kit (Glutathione colorimetric assay kit, Bio vision, Milpitas, CA, USA). In brief, 20 µL of deproteinized liver tissue samples were mixed with 160 µL of assay cocktail and the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 415 nm using a microplate reader. Each sample’s GSH concentration was determined using a generated GSH standard curve."
12,Immunohistochemical staining,"2.11 Immunohistochemical staining Paraffin embedded liver tissue sections were de-waxed in xylene and rehydrated in a series of ethanol. Tissue sections were then heated in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) for 20 min to retrieve antigens. Endogenous peroxide activity was obstructed by immersing tissues in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution in distilled water for 30 min and nonspecific bindings were blocked by incubating tissues with rabbit or horse serum. Then tissues were incubated with primary anti-cytochrome P450 2E1 enzyme (1:500, Millipore, Temecula, CA) and perilipin-2 (1:100, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, SA) antibody overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with phosphate buffered saline, tissues were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit serum for 45 min. After three washes, avidin-biotin peroxidase complex binding reaction was performed using HRP-labeled Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector) and HRP binding sites were detected with 3, 3′-diaminbenzidine (DAB, Vector). Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and positively stained cells were quantified using ImageJ (v1.46) software under the Olympus DP-72 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) microscope."
13,Western blotting,"2.12 Western blotting Liver tissue sections were homogenized in TNN buffer (40 mM Tris, pH 8; 120 mM NaCl; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]; 0.5 µg/mL leupeptin; 2 µg/mL aprotinin; 10 mM sodium orthvanadate [NOV]) and equal amount (40 µg/mL) of protein was separated by using 10–15% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and immunoblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were incubated with 2% skim milk and incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-cytochrome P450 2E1 enzyme (1:1000, Millipore, Temecula, CA), perilipin-2 antibody (1:500, Novous Biologicals, LLC), AMPKα antibody (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), phospho-AMPKα (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), FAS (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and β-Actin (1:2000, Sigma, Saint Louis, USA). After washing membranes, we incubated them with relevant secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 45 min at room temperature. Blots were developed with Westzol (iNtRON Biotechnology, Sungnam, Korea) and band densities were analyzed by ImageJ (v1.46) software."
14,Statistical analysis,2.13 Statistical analysis Numerical data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. for each group. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student’s t-test for two group comparisons or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparison for multi-group comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered significant in this study.
15,Results,
16,The phenolic acid and flavonoid in the solvent fractions of S. quelpaertensis leaf,"3.1 The phenolic acid and flavonoid in the solvent fractions of S. quelpaertensis leaf The contents of phenolic acid and flavonoid in the solvent fractions of S. quelpaertensis leaf extract are shown in Tables 1, 2. The peaks obtained in HPLC analysis of SQA ( Fig. 1A), SQB (Fig. 1B), SQC (Fig. 1C), SQEA (Fig. 1D) and SQH (Fig. 1E) signify the presence of bioactive compounds in S. quelpaertensis leaf. Chloroform (SQC, Fig. 1C) and ethyl acetate (SQEA, Fig. 1D) fractions showed the highest contents of phenolic acid and flavonoid than other fractions. Six phenolic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapinic and cinnamic acid) and seven flavonoids (rutin, taxifolin, myricetin, naringenin, rhamnetin, nobiletin and tangeretin) were successfully identified in SQC and SQEA according to the retention times and spectral characteristics of their peaks compared to those of standards (Figs. 1C and 1D). Moreover, Table 1 shows that p-coumaric acid and rutin, myricetin were the predominant phenolic acid and flavonoid in SQC and SQEA, respectively. The flavonoid content of S. quelpaertensis leaf extracts and its solvent fractions was increased in the aqueous < hexane < butanol < ethyl acetate < chloroform fraction order (Table 2). The content of flavonoid glycoside such as rutin was the highest in SQC but that of flavonoid aglycone such as myricetin and rhamnetin was the highest in SQEA. The phenolic acid and flavonoid content in mobile phase is shown in Supplement Table 1."
17,Solvent fractions of S. quelpaertensis leaf are non-toxic on murine splenocytes,"3.2 Solvent fractions of S. quelpaertensis leaf are non-toxic on murine splenocytes Biosafety of different solvent fractions was evaluated using MTT assay ( Fig. 2). The cell viability was not significantly affected by the treatment of SQA (Fig. 2A). Cells treated with SQB (Fig. 2B), SQC (Fig. 2C) and SQEA (Fig. 2D) survived better compared with untreated control whereas we observed an increasing pattern of cell viability in cells treated with SQH (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that all five fractions of S. quelpaertensis extracts (SQA, SQB, SQC, SQEA and SQH) are non-toxic on murine splenocytes at tested concentrations (3.9–1000 µg/mL)."
18,SQEA exhibits cytoprotective effect,"3.3 SQEA exhibits cytoprotective effect In this study, 400 mM EtOH was used to induce hepatotocxicity (Farshori et al., 2015) in HepG2 cells and cytoprotective effect of different solvent fractions (SQA, SQB, SQC, SQEA and SQH) against EtOH induced toxicity was determined at varying concentrations (0–1000 µg/mL). As expected, EtOH exposure decreased (p < 0.05) the cell viability compared to untreated control at 24 h incubation but extracts of S. quelpaertensis displayed diverse viability patterns. Treatment with SQA did not have a significant effect on cell viability against EtOH induced toxicity in low to medium concentrations (3.9–250 µg/mL) but significantly decreased the cell viability at higher concentrations (by 13.3% at 500 µg/mL; by 21.6% at 1000 µg/mL; Fig. 3A). SQB (Fig. 3B) and SQC (Fig. 3C) did not show any significant change in cell viability across the whole concentrations tested (3.9–1000 µg/mL). SQEA at 125, 250 and 500 µg/mL exhibited cytoprotective effect against EtOH induced toxicity and enhanced the cell viability by 25.3%, 16% and 17.2% respectively (all p < 0.05, Fig. 3D). SQH treatment with 62.5 µg/mL concentration exhibited increased cell viability (p < 0.05, by 22.2%) compared to EtOH only treated cells (Fig. 3E) though the viable cell percentage decreased dose dependently at concentrations > 62.5 µg/mL. These results suggest that SQEA exhibits cytoprotective effect against EtOH induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells."
19,SQEA downregulates EtOH induced apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation,"3.4 SQEA downregulates EtOH induced apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation When we measured the percentage of apoptotic sub-G1 cells by using PI staining in HepG2 cells, we discovered that EtOH exposure significantly increased the formation of apoptotic DNA in sub-G1 phase by 2 fold (p < 0.05) compared to untreated control ( Figs. 4A–D and 4E). However, we also discovered that SQEA treatment at 125 and 250 µg/mL decreased the fraction of apoptotic DNA in sub-G1 phase by 2.1 (p < 0.05) and 2.3 (p < 0.005) fold, respectively. These results signify the hepatoprotective effect of SQEA against EtOH induced cell death. We also evaluated SQEA’s potential to proliferate HepG2 cells by using [3H] thymidine incorporation assay (Fig. 4F). Although EtOH exposed cells showed marked reduction of cell proliferation (by 81.3%, p < 0.0005) compared to untreated cells, SQEA treatment again enhanced the cell proliferation of EtOH exposed HepG2 cells at the same concentrations, 125 (by 74.5%, p < 0.005) and 250 µg/mL (by 24.7%, p < 0.05) compared to EtOH only group. The [3H] thymidine incorporation assay confirmed that SQEA enhances the proliferation of HepG2 cells."
20,SQEA downregulates the macroscopic and histopathological changes in liver,"3.5 SQEA downregulates the macroscopic and histopathological changes in liver In this study, we employed the binge drinking mouse model (Song et al., 2006) to assess SQEA’s hepatoprotective potential against EtOH toxicity. Contrary to the bright red colored livers from healthy control group ( Fig. 5A), livers isolated from EtOH treated group were pale in color (Fig. 5D) whereas SQEA treatment at 10, 50 and 100 µg/mL (Figs. 5G, 5J and 5M) gradually ameliorated the pale tinge of liver compared to EtOH only group. Similarly, the H&E staining of healthy liver sections showed normal lobular architecture (Figs. 5B and 5C) but those of EtOH only group showed loss of cellular boundaries, prominent micro vesicular steatosis and ballooning of hepatocytes (Figs. 5E and 5F) compared to healthy control group. However, SQEA treatments reversed the histopathological changes due to EtOH dose-dependently (Figs. 5H–I, 5K–L, 5N–O), which also signifies SQEA’s protective effect against alcohol-induced fatty liver changes."
21,SQEA decreases the expression of CYP2E1 in ethanol induced liver,"3.6 SQEA decreases the expression of CYP2E1 in ethanol induced liver Western blot analysis of CYP2E1 in liver tissue homogenates under binge drinking model ( Figs. 6A and 6B) revealed that EtOH only group exhibited marked increase in the expression of CYP2E1 which is known to be recruited mostly in chronic or acute excessive ethanol consumption compared to healthy control as expected (by 1.1 fold, p < 0.05). But, CYP2E1 expression was markedly reduced compared to EtOH only group when SQEA was treated (by 1.2 fold at 10 mg/kg, by 1.3 fold at 50 mg/kg and by 1.3 fold at 100 mg/kg, respectively). In parallel, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis to evaluate the effect of SQEA on the intensity of CYP2E1 expression in liver. Again, CYP2E1 showed enhanced expression in EtOH only group (Figs. 6E and 6F) compared to healthy control (Figs. 6C and 6D). However, SQEA treatment with 10 mg/kg (Figs. 6G–H), 50 mg/kg (Figs. 6I–J) and 100 mg/kg (Figs. 6K–L) all displayed reduced expression of CYP2E1 compared to EtOH only group. ImageJ analysis of CYP2E1 positive cells showed dose dependent decrease in the expression of CYP2E1 in EtOH exposed livers where SQEA treatment at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the expression of CYP2E1 (by 1.3 (p < 0.005) and 1.6 fold (p < 0.0005), respectively; Fig. 6M). These results underscore the potential of SQEA to decrease the expression of alcohol-induced CYP2E1."
22,SQEA inhibits lipid peroxidation and promotes GSH level in EtOH exposed liver,"3.7 SQEA inhibits lipid peroxidation and promotes GSH level in EtOH exposed liver TBARS assay to evaluate the protective effect against oxidative stress-induced peroxidation of lipid membranes in liver tissue revealed that EtOH only group showed 2.5 fold increase in TBARS production compared to healthy control group whereas SQEA treatment in EtOH exposed groups exhibited a decreasing pattern of TBARS production compared to EtOH only group ( Fig. 7A). This signifies the SQEA’s potential to decrease the lipid membrane peroxidation caused by the alcohol-induced oxidative damage. To the contrary, however, GSH content was decreased by 2.5 fold in EtOH only group compared to healthy control (Fig. 7B) while SQEA treatment revealed dose-dependent recovery of reduced GSH level in EtOH administered livers reaching statistically significant increase at the highest concentration of SQEA tested in this study (by 4 fold at 100 mg/kg, p < 0.05) compared to EtOH only group. These results further suggest the efficacy of SQEA in decreasing the ethanol induced ROS."
23,SQEA regulates the activation of AMPK and decreases the triglyceride synthesis related activation of TNFR1 and FAS,"3.8 SQEA regulates the activation of AMPK and decreases the triglyceride synthesis related activation of TNFR1 and FAS AMPK plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism by activating the fatty acid oxidation related enzymes. As shown in Figs. 8A and 8B, we observed significant reduction (by 1.9 fold, p < 0.05) in the activation of AMPK in EtOH only group compared to healthy control. However, SQEA treatment dose dependently increased the activation of AMPK. Importantly, SQEA treatment increased the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio in EtOH induced groups by 1.2 fold (50 mg/kg) and by 1.6 fold (100 mg/kg, p < 0.05), respectively, compared to EtOH only group. These results signify that SQEA may play a protective role against alcohol-induced fatty liver by decreasing fatty acid synthesis and increasing the fatty acid oxidation. TNF-α is a major cytokine highly induced by EtOH and enhances the activation of fatty acid synthesis related proteins promoting the evolution to alcohol-induced fatty liver. As expected, we observed 1.9 fold increase of TNF-α receptor (TNF-R) in EtOH induced liver compared to healthy control (Figs. 8A and 8C) but dose dependent decrease of TNFR release reaching 2 fold reduction at the concentration 100 mg/kg (p < 0.05) with SQEA treatment compared to EtOH only group (Figs. 8A and 8C). Activated AMPK and decreased TNF-α secretion by SQEA can reverse the alcohol-induced lipogenesis in livers through attenuating lipogenesis enzyme FAS, a fatty acid synthesis protein. When we examined the change of FAS expression due to SQEA treatment, we observed that SQEA treatment at 50 mg/kg (p < 0.05) and 100 mg/kg (p < 0.05) showed significant FAS reduction, respectively (Figs. 8A and 8D). These results further verify SQEA’s potential in decreasing alcohol-induced fatty acid synthesis."
24,SQEA decreases the expression of perilipin-2 in ethanol administered liver,"3.9 SQEA decreases the expression of perilipin-2 in ethanol administered liver Perilipin-2 is a member of lipid droplet protein family that mirrors the lipid content in a cell and exhibits a marked increase in fatty liver. When we investigated the effect of SQEA on the expression of perilipin-2 in alcohol-induced liver, we observed that the expression level of perilipin-2 in liver tissues was increased (by 2.6 fold, p < 0.05) in EtOH only group compared to healthy control but decreased dose dependently in SQEA treated groups (by 1.3 fold at 10 mg/kg, by 1.6 fold at 50 mg/kg and by 1.7 fold at 100 mg/kg (p < 0.05), respectively) compared to EtOH only group ( Figs. 9A and 9B). According to the immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 9M), perilipin-2 was localized at a severe intensity in EtOH only group (Figs. 9E and 9F) compared to healthy control (Figs. 9C and 9D). However, SQEA treatments reduced the expression of perilipin-2 positive cells in EtOH exposed liver by 2 fold and 1.7 fold (both p < 0.05) in respective treatments of 50 mg/kg (Figs. 9I and 9J) and 100 mg/kg (Figs. 9K and 9L). These results demonstrate that SQEA plays a pivotal role in decreasing the alcohol-induced fatty acid synthesis."
25,SQEA reduces blood EtOH content in EtOH exposed liver,"3.10 SQEA reduces blood EtOH content in EtOH exposed liver Alcohol intake increases the circulation of EtOH in the blood stream. As shown in Fig. 10, blood EtOH content increased by 8.23 fold (p < 0.05) in EtOH only group compared to healthy control. However, SQEA treatment reversed the increment of blood EtOH content dose dependently and significant reduction was observed in SQEA concentrations 50 mg/kg (by 1.6 fold, p < 0.05) and 100 mg/kg (by 1.9 fold, p < 0.005), respectively. These results assert that SQEA can reduce the blood EtOH content possibly through the inhibition of CYP2E1."
26,Discussion,"Development of novel effective agents against alcohol-induced steatosis depends on blocking the accumulation of toxic byproducts of alcohol metabolism and pathways culminating into liver diseases. In this study, we demonstrated that SQEA can mitigate alcohol-induced fatty liver. When we first compared different solvent fractions (aqua, butanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and hexane fractions) obtained from 80% EtOH extract of S. quelpaertensis leaf, chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions showed the highest amount of phenolic acid and flavonoid content than other fractions. P-coumaric acid known for anti-melanogenic (Song et al., 2011), anti-inflammatory (Kim et al., 2015) and anti-tumor activities (Min et al., 2015) was the most abundant phenolic acid in the ethyl acetate fraction of S. quelpaertensis leaf. Flavonoids, a major class of plant polyphenolic found widely in medicinal herbs, may reduce the risk of chronic inflammatory diseases (Ross and Kasum, 2002) as well. Interestingly, p-coumaric acid in S. quelpaertensis leaf was shown to be effective in attenuating oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells (Kim et al., 2013) and the flavonoid myricetin which is also highly contained in SQEA was discovered to protect diet-induced obesity in mice (Su et al., 2016). Taken together, presence of flavonoids and phenolic acids in SQEA can be crucial in its protection against alcohol-induced fatty liver. HepG2 cells used in in vitro studies exhibit many characteristic functions of normal human liver hepatocytes (Balasubramaniyan et al., 2007) and hence are widely used in liver related studies. Our results showed that none of the five solvent fractions of 80% EtOH extract of S. quelpaertensis leaf were toxic on HepG2 cells but only SQEA exhibited protective effect against alcohol-induced cell death in HepG2 cells by enhancing the proliferation ability. We also demonstrated SQEA’s ability to mitigate alcohol-induced fatty liver using an animal model of acute binge drinking. Almost 80% of EtOH is metabolized in the liver. CYP2E1 that plays a minor role in usual alcohol metabolism is activated particularly in chronic or acute excessive alcohol consumption situation. Since CYP2E1 is responsible for most of alcohol-induced oxidative stress, inhibition of CYP2E1 can be an effective way to reduce the risk of alcohol-induced fatty liver (Townsend and Johnson, 2016) as was confirmed by a study involving CYP2E1 knock out mice (Lu et al., 2008). The oxidative stress due to alcohol metabolism may contribute to the depletion of antioxidant capabilities and to the lipid peroxidation and lipogenesis in livers (Altamirano and Bataller, 2011). As expected, SQEA decreased the alcohol-induced CYP2E1 activation in our study suggesting that SQEA can be an effective agent to reduce the risk of alcohol-induced fatty liver. In addition, CYP2E1 within mitochondria is responsible for ROS overproduction and GSH depletion, which may stimulate lipid peroxidation (Tang et al., 2013). Resulting products of lipid peroxidation due to increased triglyceride accumulation may further accelerate the development of fatty liver state (Morita et al., 2012). But, our findings demonstrate that SQEA inhibits the lipid peroxidation and effectively enhances the GSH expression in alcohol-affected livers. This suggests that SQEA can contribute to attenuate the alcohol-induced fatty liver formation by downregulating CYP2E1 dependent fatty acid accumulation. AMPK which switches on in response to modification in cellular energy status (Rui et al., 2016) is highly sensitive to oxidative stress (Tang et al., 2013) and plays a key role in metabolizing carbohydrates and lipids. Evidence suggests that AMPK, once activated, can stimulate fatty acid oxidation and at the same time inhibit lipogenesis (Lin et al., 2007) exerting beneficial effect against alcohol induced toxicity. As expected, SQEA exhibited enhanced activation of AMPK in alcohol-induced liver where AMPK is inhibited under the influence of alcohol alone. AMPK activation should be associated with the observation of hypolipidemic effect of SQEA, which was further supported by a previous report showing that upregulating AMPK can attenuate alcohol-induced lipid accumulation in rat liver (Rui et al., 2016b). Activated AMPK plays a vital role in attenuating fatty acid synthesis in livers. Blockade of AMPK due to increased ROS can enhance the fatty acid synthesis through the stimulation of lipogenesis enzyme FAS. Interestingly, decreased FAS expression observed in this study signifies the SQEA’s protective role against pathogenesis of alcohol-induced fatty liver via AMPK activation. Apart from AMPK, the master regulator of lipogenesis, increased level of TNF-α in liver is also reported to activate lipogenic enzymes (Rasineni and Casey, 2012). Kuffer cells secreting TNF-α in excessive alcoholic conditions induce lipogenesis enzyme FAS via TNFR1 and are implicated as a major regulator of ALD (Beier,McClain, 2010b). It has been reported that administration of alcohol to TNFR1 knock out mice resulted in nearly absent steatosis (Yin et al., 1999). In contrast, administration of TNF-α to human hepatocytes is reported to enhance the possibility of formation fatty liver (Lawler et al., 1998). In this study, we demonstrated that SQEA down regulates the TNFR1 expression in alcohol-induced liver. However, complete blocking of TNF-α is not a viable therapeutic option as TNF-α is required in the maturation of hepatocyte (Louvet and Mathurin, 2015). Furthermore, SQEA downregulated the lipogenesis protein FAS which is also expected to be downregulated by the activation of AMPK (Tomita et al., 2005) and the down regulation of TNFR1 (Louvet and Mathurin, 2015) in return. Finally, we confirmed the SQEA’s effect on the accumulation of alcohol-induced lipids via the expression of liver perilipin-2. Perilipin-2 is a representative lipid droplet associated protein and SQEA decreased the expression of perilipin-2 in alcohol-induced livers, which further signifies the hypolipidemic effect of SQEA."
27,Conclusion,Our results clearly demonstrate that phenolic acid and flavonoid-rich SQEA prevent alcohol-induced fatty liver by inhibiting lipogenesis. The hypolipidemic effect was regulated via the activation of AMPK pathway which further down regulated lipogenesis related FAS expression. These results signify the development of SQEA as an effective natural agent against alcohol-induced fatty liver.
