0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is of essential and importance for organic transformations, and the produced alcohols are value-added fine chemicals widely used for aroma, flavor and pharmaceutical industries [1–4]. In particular, catalytic activation of the chemical bonds in biomass-derived unsaturated oxygenates [5–9], for instance, hydrogenating furfural (FF) produces diverse precursors for polymers and biofuels [10–12]. This biomass-upgrading process could link lignocellulose to the renewable chemical industry, where the dependence on fossil resources can be reduced. However, addition across a double bond between CC is easier in thermodynamics than that along CO, leading consequently to a notable challenge in controlling selectivity of hydrogenation products. As shown in Scheme 1 , hydrogenation of FF may possibly yield several over-hydrogenated by-products, in addition to the desired furfuryl alcohol (FA). Therefore, developing highly selective hydrogenation catalyst and technology remains the central position in the reductive transformation of FF to FA. Earlier, supported-Pd, Pt and Ru nanoparticles as the traditional hydrogenation catalysts have been reported for conversion of FF to FA in water [13–15], owing to their superior reactivity in adsorption and dissociation of molecular H2. Nonetheless, high H2 pressure and long reaction time are most often required, which as a result leads not only to potential safety hazard but by-products formation due to over hydrogenation. Alternatively, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of FF to FA using organic alcohols or acids as hydrogen donor allows working at mild pressure of inert gas and even offering a high chemoselectivity toward CO bond. Meerwein, Ponndorf and Verley (the so-called MPV reaction) reported that aldehydes and ketones can be reduced by secondary alcohols in the presence of a Lewis acid or basic catalyst. This CTH approach can be usually catalyzed by cheap oxides bearing Lewis acidic-basic sites [16,17], e.g., alumina. Lewis acid sites were able to activate the CO bond of aldehydes or ketones, while the alcohol suffers deprotonation. Moreover, the formation of a six-membered intermediate was postulated, with the participation of the hydrogen in the position C α , being both aldehyde/ketone and the deprotonated alcohol directly activated on the Lewis acid sites [18]. Moreover, Cu as promoter enables to provoke an enhanced selectivity to FA [12,19], probably due to the modification on the state of active sites. Therefore, the coupling of CTH by solvent and hydrogenation by H2 has been proposed in literature as a green and effective strategy to convert FF into FA [20–22]. Highly dispersed Au nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be active catalysts for many important reactions, such as hydrogenations of alkenes, carbonyl compounds and nitro compounds, CO oxidation, propylene epoxidation, hydrogen peroxide synthesis, aerobic oxidation of alcohols, and C–C coupling reactions [23–27]. For some reactions, the unique catalytic properties of supported gold nanoparticles even show performances (e.g., remarkable selectivity) superior to those of platinum group metal catalysts. However, there are very limited Au-based hydrogenation catalysts for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, mainly due to its low activity in dissociating H2. Thus, exploring the potential ability of Au catalyst to selectively convert α,β-unsaturated bio-aldehydes is of high importance for gold catalysis and biomass catalytic valorization. Previously, Au/ZnO and Au/Fe2O3 catalysts showed high selectivity in liquid phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [28] and citral [29], respectively. It was assumed that the oxide support can provide interfacial sites adjacent to hemispherical Au particles that were involved in the activation of CO bond in the unsaturated aldehydes, either alone or in association with nearby Au sites to increase the hydrogenation rate of Au catalysts. Later, a few Au hydrogenation catalysts were reported for cinnamaldehyde (Au/Fe2O3 and Au/SiC) [30,31], HMF (Au/Al2O3) [32], and acrolein (Au/SPOs, secondary phosphine oxides) [33]. It was demonstrated that fine tuning of Au size and support properties were demanded to achieve the highly selective hydrogenation, i.e., oxides bearing acidity-basicity and Au particles in small sizes were favorable. Moreover, the Au-support interface was shown critical to preferably adsorb H2 molecule and CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes for their selective conversion to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols. Recently, Au/TiO2 catalyst was used for CO-driven reductive transformation of FF to FA in water [34]. In addition, Au/Al2O3 catalyst was shown active for selective production of furfuryl alcohol via gas phase hydrogenation of furfural [35]. To the best of our knowledge, Au/BOFs (supramolecular organic frameworks) catalyst has been the only one ever reported for FF hydrogenation in liquid phase via CTH but in presence of KOH [36]. The necessary use of soluble base additives would hamper the green footprint of this biomass upgrading process due to the extra separation and purification of FA production. Herein, we report for the first time Au nanoparticles loaded on Lewis acidic-basic Cu-doped alumina (Au/Cu-Al2O3) as highly active and selective catalyst by combinative use of i-PrOH and H2 as proton donors for liquid phase hydrogenation of FF to FA at ambient pressure without any base additive. We demonstrate the unique ensemble of Au nanoparticles and Cu-doped Al2O3, which brings about an enhanced hydrogenation performance of supported-Au catalyst for selective conversion of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Al(NO3)3·9H2O (> 98%) from Alfa Aesar, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (> 99%) from Acros Organics, and NH4OH (28 wt.%) from Sinopharm Chemical Co. Ltd. were used for synthesis of support materials. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, > 98%, MW = 10,000) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. HAuCl4·3H2O (49.0% on Au basis) and NaBH4 (> 98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Furfural (FF, 99%), furfuryl alcohol (FA, 99%), 2-methylfuran (2-MF, 99%) from Acros Organics were used for catalytic reactions and quantification. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification or treatment."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation Cu-doped Al2O3 was synthesized by co-precipitation method. Al(NO3)3·9H2O (14.0 g) was dissolved in deionized water (150 mL) with addition of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. The Cu/Al and molar ratio was kept at 1/50. The metal precursors were co-precipitated by dropwise addition of 28 wt% solution of NH4OH under stirring (600 rmp) till the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 8. The obtained slurry was stirred at 65 °C under condensation reflux for 12 h. The resulting solids were recovered by filtration and washed by excessive deionized water when the filtrate presented a neutral pH value. The solids were afterwards oven-dried at 120 °C for 12 h followed by a calcination at 650 °C (2 °C min−1) under an air flow for 5 h. The so-prepared Cu-doped alumina was donated as Cu-Al2O3. This protocol was also applicable to prepare CuO and Al2O3. Supported Au nanocatalysts were prepared by immobilization of the PVP-stabilized colloidal Au nanoparticles onto the supports, i.e., Au/CuO, Au/Al2O3, and Au/Cu-Al2O3, respectively. In a typical protocol, a PVP aqueous solution was added into a HAuCl4 solution (PVP/Au = 1.2/1, in w/w) under stirring. After 15 min, a suspension of powdery support was added and the mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then a freshly made NaBH4 solution (NaBH4/Au = 4/1, in w/w) was slowly introduced into the mixture to yield a dark-purple colloidal solution. After it was stirred for another 15 min, the solid catalyst was recovered by filtration and washed repeatedly with excessive hot deionized water (90 °C) to remove PVP and with excessive deionized water to remove Na+ and Cl− ions. Finally, the resultant Au nanocatalyst was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction Hydrogenation of FF was performed in a batch-type Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL). Typically, 2 mmol FF and 0.1 g catalyst were added into the reactor with 2-propanol (i-PrOH, 20 mL) as solvent. After the purge and introduction of H2 at a certain pressure (typically at 0.1 MPa), the reactor was placed in an oil bath pre-heated at 120 °C with magnetic stirring at 300 rpm. After a fixed time (typically 4 h unless otherwise specified), the reactor was quickly transferred to ice water. And then the spent catalyst was carefully separated by high-speed centrifugation (8000 rmp for 10 min) and washed by ethanol and water three times followed by drying at 60 °C in vacuum for 12 h before its next use. The reactant and liquid products were analyzed on an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a FID detector and a HP-5 capillary column (Length: 30 m, I.D.: 0.32 mm, Film: 0.25 μm). The quantification was carried out by the external standard method using FF, FA, 2-MF as standard chemicals. The conversion of FF and the selectivity of each product were defined as the molar percentage of FF converted and the molar percentage of each product formed in FF converted, respectively. Both the conversion and selectivity were calculated on a carbon basis. Each reaction was repeated twice at least to guarantee a reproducible result, and the error of the data must be no more than 2%.

5,Characterization methods,"2.4 Characterization methods The precise metal loadings (i.e., Au and Cu) were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique using an Agilent 7500a apparatus. The solid sample was thoroughly dissolved by a mixed solution of HCl and HNO3 and the obtained solution was placed at room temperature overnight. Before analysis the solution was filtered and diluted. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Rigaku TTR III Diffractometer provided with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a beam voltage of 40 kV. The patterns were registered in the 2θ domain (5–90°) with a measured step of 0.02° and a time integration of 0.2 s. The textural properties were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 surface area analyzer. The specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The intercrystalline mean pore sizes and the pore volumes were measured by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method using the adsorption data from the adsorption branch. Prior to the sorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 150 °C for 3 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out under ultra-high vacuum on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi system provided with Al Kα radiation. The binding energy shift due to the surface charging was adjusted using a reference to the C 1s line at 284.5 eV. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out on a Micromeritics Autochem II Chemisorption analyzer. The sample was treated in a 5% H2-95% Ar (in vol.) mixed gas (30 mL min−1) while the temperature was increased to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was performed on a Philips-FEI TECNAI F30 field-emission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. Samples for TEM measurements were suspended in ethanol and dispersed ultrasonically. Drops of the suspension were applied on a lacey support film. The size distribution and the mean size of Au nanoparticles were then measured and calculated. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 analyzer. The sample loaded in a quartz reactor was pre-treated with helium at 200 °C for 1 h. After cooling to 50 °C, CO2 adsorption was performed by switching helium to a 10% CO2-90% He (in vol.) mixed gas and then maintaining for 1 h. The gas-phase CO2 was purged by helium at the same temperature. CO2-TPD was then performed in helium flow by raising the temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed CO2 was detected on a ThermoStar GSD 301 T2 mass spectrometer at the signal of m/z 43. This protocol was also applicable to NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), during which diluted NH3 was used as probe and monitored by mass spectrometer at the signal of m/z 16."
6,Results and discussion,"Cu-Al2O3, as well as CuO and Al2O3 as reference, was lab-synthesized by the typical (co-)precipitation method using NH4OH as precipitant, followed by calcination at 650 °C. The doped Cu is of 2 mol% on the basis of Al in theory. The measured Cu content in bulk by ICP-MS is found slightly lower (1.77 mol%) but still close to the value measured on surface by XPS (1.51 mol%, Table 1 ), which suggests a relatively homogeneous distribution of Cu in Al2O3. XRD shows a well crystallized monoclinic CuO phase (JCPDS 48–1548) for CuO and a typical γ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDS 29–0063) for Al2O3 and Cu-Al2O3 oxides (Fig. 1 ). However, none Cu-related diffraction peak can be observed from Cu-Al2O3 probably due to rather low content and high dispersion of Cu in Al2O3 phase. The incorporation of Cu into Al2O3 lattice is confirmed by a clear peak shift to lower diffraction angles, because the bigger atomic radius of dopant can lead to an expansion of oxide crystal [37,38]. The prepared oxides exhibit type-IV isothermal profiles with a typical type-H3 hysteresis loop located at a relative pressure of about 0.5–0.9 (Fig. 2 ). This may indicate the presence of irregular mesopores usually related with γ-Al2O3 (Table 1). Hence, Cu-Al2O3 and Al2O3 display higher specific surface areas of 267 m2 g−1 and 178 m2 g−1 respectively, compared to the highly crystallized CuO (36 m2 g−1, Table 1). The enlarged surface area of Cu-Al2O3 can be caused by lattice distortions by doping Cu in Al2O3 [39,40]. As shown in Fig. 3 a, Al2O3-based oxides can drive the CTH of FF to FA in the presence of high-purity N2 using i-PrOH as solvent and hydrogen donor. It has to be mentioned here that greatly high selectivity (> 99%) toward FA during hydrogenation can be obtained. No byproduct is formed. Cu-Al2O3 catalyst shows a moderate conversion (50%) of FF working with 2 mmol of FF at 120 °C and 0.1 MPa N2 after 4 h, while Al2O3 catalyst affords a lower conversion at 35%. On the contrary, CuO is inactive for this reaction. To be noted, almost the same conversion and selectivity are obtained over Al2O3 and Cu-Al2O3 catalysts when replacing N2 by H2 under the same conditions (Fig. 3b). This confirms that hydrogenation of FF to FA over the Al2O3-based catalysts only undergoes the CTH route. Al2O3 and Cu-Al2O3 cannot activate and split molecular H2, and the organic solvent (i.e., i-PrOH) turns out to be the only hydrogen donor. Recently, R. López-Asensio et al. reported that a commercial acidic-basic γ-Al2O3 can catalyze liquid phase CTH of FF and exhibited 100% conversion of FF and 90% selectivity to FA with formation of byproduct by working with 1 mmol of FF at 150 °C and 1 MPa N2 after 6 h [17]. Therefore, our lab-made γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows a much better selectivity (> 99%) but with a similar activity. When the mass ratio of FF to catalyst and the reaction time are taken into account, the calculated productivity of FA over our Al2O3 catalyst is of 0.18 gFA h−1 gcat. −1, which is higher to the data reported by R. López-Asensio (0.15 gFA h−1 gcat. −1). However, the current inert pressure (0.1 MPa) and reaction temperature (120 °C) are lower. And moreover, the productivity of FA can be already promoted to 0.25 gFA h−1 gcat. −1 by doping a low content of Cu in Al2O3. Thereafter, a small amount of Au (0.2 wt%) was supported on the prepared oxides by PVP-stabilized colloidal method. ICP-MS and XPS analysis show an effective loading of Au onto the supports (Table 1). To our interest, supported-Au particles enable to further improve the CTH of FF via i-PrOH. Conversions of FF over Au/Al2O3 and Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalysts increase to 44% and 62% under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. 4 a. The productivity of FA can be respectively increased to 0.23 gFA h−1 gcat. −1 and 0.32 gFA h−1 gcat. −1 in N2. Au/CuO catalyst is barely active. Previously, B. Qi et al. demonstrated that metallic Au particles were active for the CTH performance of FF with assistant of KOH over the Au/BOFs catalyst [36]. They also pointed out that Au particle of 3.2 nm was the most active for i-PrOH dehydrogenation, i.e., the larger Au particles is the lower activity and selectivity is. Later on, in order to find the very appropriate solvent as hydrogen donor during CTH, a series of solvents including C1−C4 alcohols, as well as toluene and THF, were investigated (Table 2 ). i-PrOH as frequently used in literature is found the best solvent among the C2−C4 alcohols to realize the CTH of FF in the presence of Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst. This can be probably attributed to a low polarity and a weak steric hindrance of i-PrOH among C1−C4 alcohols [41]. As expected, toluene and THF as typical non-polar solvent are shown inactive to dehydrogenate to transfer hydrogen to FF. More importantly, in our work when 0.1 MPa H2 is provided in the reactor, conversions of FF can be promoted over all the supported Au catalysts (Fig. 4b). In order to avoid any saturation of activity, the content of FF is doubled to 4 mmol. With presence of H2, as predicted, conversion of FF over Au/Al2O3 catalyst increases but only up to 32%, corresponding to 1.5 times of that obtained in N2. Still, Au/CuO catalyst affords rather a low conversion of FF at 3%. But to be noted, 100% conversion of FF and 100% selectivity to FA are achieved under the same conditions over the Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst, which is more than 3 times of that obtained from the CTH route in N2. This is certainly due to a significant contribution by the catalytic hydrogenation on Au sites from H2. In such a context, the productivity of FA reaches 0.98 gFA h−1 gcat. −1 at ambient H2 pressure. To our best knowledge, this is the first report and also the best result so far on Au-catalyzed hydrogenative conversion of FF to FA in liquid phase by making full use of hydrogen from both organic solvent and molecular H2 under mild reaction conditions. Therefore, cooperation of Au nanoparticles and Cu-doped Al2O3 is the decisive factor that can improve not only the CTH of FF on Al2O3 but also significantly the catalytic hydrogenation (i.e., dissociation of molecular H2) on Au sites. In order to understand the interesting role of Cu dopant and the difference in catalytic performances over the Au/Al2O3 and the Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalysts, further studies were carried out on reaction and characterization. First of all, the apparent activation energy (E a, the computational details can be found in Table S1 of supplementary material) calculated by the numerical regression assuming valid Arrhenius law reveals that Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst is much more active (Fig. 5 ), which presents the lower E a of 48.0 kJ mol−1, while Au/Al2O3 catalyst gives a higher E a of 59.6 kJ mol−1. This kinetic result is in good agreement with their catalytic performances (Fig. 4b). And then, XPS spectra of Au 4f core level disclose the presence of typical metallic Au species on support surfaces. As shown Fig. 6 a, the BE at 83.3 eV is in consistent with the value (83.4 eV) reported for Au/Al2O3 catalyst in literature [35]. The best Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst, as well as Au/CuO, exhibits BE at 84.0–84.1 eV for Au0 species, which is found identical to the metallic Au interacted with CuO in Au-Cu/SBA-15 catalyst (84.1 eV) [42], but obviously higher than that of Au/Al2O3. This has been illustrated by the electron transfer at the interface of Au-CuO [42]. At the same time, XPS reveals the co-existence of Cu+ and Cu2+ ions on catalyst surface bearing the distinctive shake-up satellite peak for Cu2+ species (Fig. 6b). Au/CuO shows BEs of 932.1 eV and 933.9 eV for Cu+ and Cu2+ ions respectively, in agreement with the data of O 1s core level (Fig. 6c), which are in good agreement with the Cu species in CuO reported in literature [43,44]. However, Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst shows higher BEs for Cu+ (932.8 eV) and Cu2+ (934.8 eV) ions, which are consistent with the Cu species interacted with the second metal like Pd or Au in Cu-Pd/C and Au-Cu/SBA-15 catalyst [19,42]. Moreover, the portion of Cu+ species in Au/Cu-Al2O3 reaches as high as 65%, much higher than that of Au/CuO. Thus Au0 nanoparticles may help stabilize Cu+ species by transferring electrons to partially reduce Cu2+ to Cu+ as already observed in literature [19,42]. It was reported that Cu+ ions as active species participated in activation of CO group in FF [43,44]. Therefore, this result reveals a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Au0 nanoparticles and Cu2O-Al2O3 sites. The reductive property of different Au catalysts is monitored by H2-TPR. As shown in Fig. 7 , Au/Al2O3 and Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalysts present a reduction peak at ca. 219 °C and 206 °C respectively, which can be related to the reduction process of Au3+ → Au0 [45]. While Au/CuO catalyst shows two unresolved reduction peaks at ca. 212 °C and 270 °C, which can be ascribed to the typical reduction process of Cu2+ → Cu+ → Cu0 [46]. The reduction peak of cationic Au can be overlapped by that of Cu2+ ions, in consistent with the TPR profile of a bimetallic Au-Cu/Al2O3 catalyst [47]. Notably, the SMSI in the Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst may probably enhance the reducibility of Au nanoparticles, because a lowest temperature is required to reduce Au species compared to the other two catalysts. Furthermore, TEM images provide direct observation of the morphology of supported-Au catalysts. A typical flower-like morphology assigned to γ-Al2O3 and Cu-containing layer doubled hydroxide-derived oxide can be well seen (Fig. 8 ) [48]. To be noted, uniform and small Au nanoparticles are found highly dispersed on both Al2O3 and Cu-Al2O3 supports. The size distribution of Au nanoparticles of Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst is narrower than that of Au/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 8), which indicates that the doping of Cu to alumina may possibly promote the dispersion of Au. The mean particle sizes are estimated to be 2.9 ± 0.3 nm and 3.0 ± 0.1 nm for Au/Al2O3 and Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. As a matter of fact, it was reported for a Au/CuO/SBA-15 catalyst, the addition of CuO in the catalyst can significantly hinder the aggregation and growth of Au particles due to the alloying process and strong interaction between metallic Au and CuO [42]. Following that, the acidity-basicity of the support materials was analyzed by TPD technique using NH3 and CO2 as probe. As displayed in Fig. 9 a, Cu-doped Al2O3 shows similar profile to that of Al2O3, i.e., a band at low temperature of about 160 °C followed by a broad and long tailed band at high temperature of about 460 °C. This is indicative of the presence of weak and strong acid sites. The weak acid sites can be due to interaction between OH groups of alumina and NH3, while the strong acid sites are Lewis type that can be mainly related to Al3+ cations [49]. The Lewis acidity of γ-Al2O3 is weakened due to covering the Lewis acid sites by incorporation of CuO [49], which benefits the CTH of FF over Cu-Al2O3 oxide catalyst. Earlier, it was reported that the presence of suitable Lewis acidic sites in a Cu/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst led to the high selectivity of FA due to preventing the formation of aldol condensation of FF and i-PrOH [50]. Meanwhile the Al2O3-based oxides present three CO2 desorption peaks (Fig. 9b). The weak, moderate and strong basic sites with corresponding peaks centered at about 295 °C, 450 °C and 555 °C can be ascribed to surface OH groups, Mn+−O2 pairs and coordinately unsaturated O2− ions, respectively. It can be well seen that doping Cu to Al2O3 may significantly modify the Lewis basicity of Al2O3. Particularly, the presence of Cu ions can largely reduce the moderate and strong basic sites of Al2O3, which is disclosed beneficial to the CTH of FF over the Cu-Al2O3 oxide catalyst. In short, Au hydrogenation catalysts normally exhibit low activity in dissociating H2. When Au nanoparticles are coupled to the Cu-Al2O3 oxide the capability of dissociating H2 can be significantly enhanced. On one hand, a suitable Lewis acid–base pair is shown important not only for dehydrogenation of i-PrOH but also for activating H2 on Au surface. G. Lu et al. reported an enhanced reactivity of Au surface toward H2 via collaboration with a Lewis base [51]. They demonstrated that Au surface could serve as a Lewis acid coupling with Lewis bases (e.g. imine and nitrile) to construct effective frustrated Lewis pairs to activate H2 and subsequently to achieve hydrogenation of small imines and nitriles. On the other hand, it was disclosed from selective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds using platinum group metal catalysts, that the surface electronic structure of Pt or Pd atoms played a key role in adsorption and hydrogenation of CO or CC bond [52–54]. The lower electron density of the surface metal atoms was favored and the synergy between the hydrogenation metal sites and Lewis acid sites was found to promote hydrogenation reactivity. Moreover, computational modeling revealed the unique role of Cu species in selective hydrogenation of multi-unsaturated hydrocarbons [54,55]. The different reactivity of Cu facets related with their d-orbital density of states may present quite different adsorption behavior toward CO bond. In our work, the cooperation between the metallic small Au nanoparticles and the Lewis acid–base pair sites on the Cu2O-Al2O3 support can be illustrated as a strategy for generation of reactive hydrogen atoms from the hydrogen transfer and the H2 dissociation at the metal-support interface, which are then transferred to FF. As shown in the time course test (Fig. 10 a), the selectivity of FA over Cu-Al2O3 and Au/CuO-Al2O3 catalysts always remains at 100% as conversion of FF gradually increases. It can be clearly seen that the supported active Au nanoparticles may simultaneously promote conversion of FF over Cu-Al2O3. The leaching test indicates no loss of Al or Au from catalyst during reaction (Fig. 9a), which is often regarded as the main reason for catalyst deactivation. This observation is directly confirmed by ICP-MS analysis on the post-reaction mixture. Furthermore, the Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits an excellent stability during five recycling reuses within the kinetic-controlled region and under the optimized reaction conditions (Fig. 10b). More importantly, this Au nanocatalyst shows a high potential for activation and dissociation of H2, that is, in the practical use a concentrated FF solution can be efficiently converted to FA when working with the same amount of catalyst (Fig. 10c). H2 pressure and reaction time as crucial parameters can obviously influence the performance of the Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst. To our satisfaction, using relatively higher H2 pressure and longer reaction time allows achieving the complete conversion of the concentrated FF solution to FA. Particularly, 20 mmol FF can be stoichiometrically transformed to FA at 2.0 MPa H2 and 120 °C after 8 h. In such a context, the productivity of FA can reach as high as 4.92 gFA h−1 gcat. −1. This is really a competitive result ever reported for hydrogenation of FF in the literature. As summarized in Table S2, our lab-made γ-Al2O3 shows higher productivity of FA but under milder conditions compared to the commercial γ-Al2O3 catalyst reported in literature. Cu-doped γ-Al2O3 can obviously improve the catalytic efficiency via the CTH route. Compared to the Au/BOFs catalyst following the MPV mechanism, our Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst may present a lower productivity of FA but the present catalytic system is the first Au hydrogenation catalyst for highly active and selective conversion of α,β-unsaturated furfural in liquid phase without any base additive. In addition, as presented in Table 3 , this Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst behaves highly selective to formation of typical α,β-unsaturated modeling alcohols that were reported in literature from liquid phase hydrogenation of the corresponding aldehydes (i.e., citral, cinnamaldehyde and 5-HMF) over heterogeneous Au catalysts [29,30,32]. Working at the same temperature used in literature, very high selectivity (90–98%) towards unsaturated alcohols can be obtained at ambient H2 pressure over the Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst. The yields of unsaturated alcohols are comparable or higher than literature [29,30,32]. Therefore, Cu-doped Al2O3 supported Au nanoparticles in this work are shown to be a performant hydrogenation catalyst."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, we developed an efficient heterogeneous Au-based catalytic system for hydrogenation of FF to FA in liquid phase. The prepared Au/Cu-Al2O3 catalyst showed maximum 100% yield to FA at ambient H2 pressure thanks to an effective coupling of the CTH from i-PrOH on acidic-basic Cu-Al2O3 support and the catalytic hydrogenation from H2 on metallic small Au nanoparticles. Incorporation of Cu to Al2O3 not only lowered the Lewis acidic-basic sites of γ-Al2O3 but also induced generation of surface Cu+ ions. Both were shown as active species participated in activation of C=O group in FF. Cu2O-Al2O3 support may stabilize Au nanoparticles in metallic state and small size (ca. 3 nm). In return, an enhanced reactivity of Au toward H2 can be achieved via cooperation with the Lewis acid–base pair sites on Cu2O-Al2O3 and the activation energy can be lowered. This strategy allowed generating reactive hydrogen atoms from the hydrogen transfer and the H2 dissociation at the metal-support interface, which are then transferred to FF. We believed that our finding would shed a light on developing new Au catalysts for selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde."
