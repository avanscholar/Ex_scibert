0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde (BzH) is a valuable intermediate for several organic compounds used in the pharmaceuticals, dyestuff, agrochemicals, and perfumery industries [1,2]. Up till now, the hydrolysis of benzal chloride and vapor/liquid phase oxidation of toluene are the two sources of most of world's synthetic BzH [3,4]. However, the former method involves complicated technical processes and disposal problems (corrosive gas emissions and organic wastes), coupled with inevitable product contamination due to chlorine, an unacceptable issue particularly in medicines and perfumes. The latter approach often requires rather high temperatures and pressures and/or suffers from low selectivity with the loss of carbon in the form of CO2. Alternatively, direct oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) in liquid phase is a green and promising route for the manufacture of BzH, as it completely overcomes the major drawbacks of the conventional syntheses. Unlike the conventional stoichiometric oxidants (chromium trioxide, nitric acid and permanganate) [5–7], clean oxidants (H2O2, O2, photocatalytic system (solar UV source and O2)) are more desirable and have been used to produce BzH by the liquid phase oxidation of BzOH with water as the sole byproduct [8–13]. Hence, it is necessary to design and develop suitable catalysts with higher conversion and selectivity for the selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH using clean oxidants. Literature reveals that supported Au catalysts have attracted appreciable research interests, as they are demonstrated to be one of the best catalysts for the oxidation of BzOH [14]. Recently, Choudhary and co-workers reported that Au nanoparticles supported on MgO (or TiO2, U3O8) showed very high catalytic activity and excellent reusability for the oxidation process [15–17]. On the other hand, different preparation procedures result in variations in the particle sizes of Au nanoparticle catalysts and the reduction method is a more advantageous way to prepare Au particles with narrow size distributions and desired diameters [18]. Our group has paid continuing effort to exploit the plant extract as bio-reducing agents for preparation of Au catalysts [19–21], and we recently reported the first example of Au/TS-1 catalysts designed via bioreduction method, which shown excellent performance for the selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH with aqueous H2O2 achieving simultaneous high activity, high recyclability and remarkable stability [22]. Accurate kinetic expression provides information concerning the role of reactants and most importantly the catalyst behavior, useful for identifying the controlling regimes (mass transfer or kinetics) for the design of catalysts and reactors. Although some studies have been dedicated to the kinetics of BzOH catalytic oxidation, only few have been devoted to the detailed kinetics studies over the heterogeneous catalysts [7,23,24]. One such attempt was by Chaudhari and co-workers [25]; they reported the kinetic study of heterogeneous oxidation of BzOH with H2O2 over ammonium molybdate and tungstic acid catalysts and simplified the reaction as a second-order reaction. We undertake this present work for the first time to determine reaction orders, rate constants, and apparent activation energy of the oxidation of BzOH with aqueous H2O2 over the bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts. Accordingly, the issues of mass transfer limitations have to be addressed; again, a traditional empirical equation for the power law model was obtained by varying different process parameters such as temperature, amount of catalyst, concentration of BzOH, H2O2 and BzH. Furthermore, a rate expression based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model (a semi-empirical model) was employed to fit the experimental data for elucidating the reaction pathway and fundamental mechanism. The main purpose of this work is to provide an insight into the kinetic mechanism of the liquid phase oxidation of BzOH over bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts and aid the process design for production of chlorine-free BzH."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials All chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China) and were used without treatments. Sundried plant leaf (Cacumen Platycladi) was purchased from Xiamen Jiuding Drugstore (China).
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) supports with a Si/Ti molar ratio of 35 were prepared according to the established procedure reported in the literature [19]. The resulting material has a specific surface area of 388m2 g−1, a pore volume of 0.31cm3 g−1 and a pore diameter of 4.5nm. Bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts (with Au loading of 0.3wt%) were prepared by adsorption–reduction method with Cacumen Platycladi extract as the bio-reducing agent [22]. In a typical preparation procedure, 0.589g TS-1 support was immersed in aqueous HAuCl4 (30mL, 0.3mM) under continuous stirring (1000rpm, 30°C) for 1h. Then 30mL of the plant extract (10gL−1) was added immediately into the mixture solution. The color of the solution changed from pale yellow to purple red due to the reduction of the adsorbed Au ions by the plant extract. The slurry was filtered after 2h, and the solid was washed thoroughly with distilled water, dried in vacuum oven at 50°C overnight and catalytically tested (without calcination)."
4,Kinetic study,"2.3 Kinetic study Fresh catalysts were used each time to acquire the kinetic data. The oxidation of BzOH was carried out in a magnetically stirred glass reactor (50mL) by dispersing the catalysts in 17.1mL aqueous medium composed of BzOH and H2O2. Temperature was controlled using a thermocouple located in the reactor. Samples (from the reactor) were taken periodically (with a syringe) and centrifuged to separate the catalyst from the mixture. The products were analyzed using a gas chromatography, equipped with flame ionization detector (FID, SE-30 capillary column) and identified by comparison with known standards. External calibration method was used for quantitative analysis of the concentrations of reactants and products generated. The initial reaction rate method was employed to conduct the kinetic studies [26]. Samples were taken at various time intervals within the initial 25min of oxidation reaction. The selectivity of BzH is higher than 99.1% in the tested time range, suggesting that side reactions are negligible. In order to obtain the overall kinetic expression, series of experiments were carried out by implementing different reaction conditions and measuring the initial reaction rates. More specifically, different process parameters such as temperature (35–95°C), amount of catalyst (2.92–17.54gL−1), concentration of BzOH (0.57–1.69molL−1), H2O2 (0.68–2.12molL−1) and BzH (0.14–0.85molL−1) were conducted, wherein only one parameter was varied in each set of experiments while the other parameters were kept constant [27]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Preliminary considerations,"3.1 Preliminary considerations Prior to the analysis, we need to eliminate the mass transfer resistances for estimating the true kinetic parameters, including both the internal and the external diffusion resistances. The mean diameter of the catalyst is very small (∼162nm) as such it is difficult to investigate the effect of the size of catalyst particles on the rate of reaction [19,22]. Therefore, we adopt the Mears criterion [28] (Eq. (1)) to estimate the value of the effectiveness factor, in order to determine whether the internal diffusion limitation is concerned in the reaction. (1) Φ = r d p 2 4 C s D e < 1 | n | where Φ is the modified Thiele modulus, r is the observed reaction rate per unit particles volume (molL−1 s−1), d p is the diameter of the particle (m), C s is the reactant concentration at the external surface of the particle (molL−1), D e is the effective diffusion coefficient (m2 s−1), and n is the total reaction order. For confirmation, it was thought desirable to estimate the values of Φ in Eq. (1). In this case, the orders of magnitude for r, d p, C s and D e are 10−3, 10−7, 1 and 10−9, respectively, thus calculation gives Φ (∼10−8) to be ≪1/|n|; indicating that internal diffusion can be considered negligible. To check for the external diffusion resistances and to establish the stirring rate at which the effect of external mass transfer can be removed, the effect of the stirring (from 200 to 1000rpm) on the BzOH oxidation rate was investigated. The reaction temperature for these experiments is 95°C instead of the usual 80°C because the reaction rate is faster at this high temperature ensuring the elimination of external resistances in the whole range of the experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 , the reaction rate of BzOH oxidation is strongly increased at stirring rates below 600rpm. Increasing the speed of agitation beyond 600rpm has no significant effect on the rate of oxidation of BzOH, indicating that this speed could remove all external diffusion limitations; leaving the overall operation to be presumably reaction-controlled. Therefore, all subsequent experiments were conducted at a speed of 800rpm unless otherwise stated."
7,Power-law rate model,"3.2 Power-law rate model Factors such as reaction temperature, amount of catalysts, concentration of BzOH, H2O2 and BzH can determine the reaction rate of BzOH oxidation. Therefore, the BzOH oxidation rate (r) (molL−1 s−1) can be expressed in terms of the power law model as: (2) r = − d C BzOH d t = k [ BzOH ] a [ H 2 O 2 ] b [ BzH ] c [ Cat. ] d where k is the rate constant, and a, b, c, d are the respective reaction orders with respect to the concentration of BzOH (molL−1), H2O2 (molL−1), BzH (molL−1), and catalyst (gL−1). The rate constant k is temperature dependent and it was assumed according to the Arrhenius equation: (3) k = A exp − E a R T where A is the pre-exponential factor, E a is the activation energy (kJmol−1), R is the universal gas constant (kJmol−1 K−1), and T is the absolute reaction temperature (K). 3.2.1 Determination of reaction orders Accordingly, the kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the model to the experimental data. The reaction orders a, b, c and d were determined by changing the concentrations of BzOH, H2O2, BzH, and the amount of catalysts, respectively, while maintaining other factors constant. For this purpose, the change in the initial reaction rates as a function of the initial BzOH concentration was investigated in the coexistence of H2O2 (2.12molL−1) and Au/TS-1 catalysts (17.54gL−1) at 80°C. The results show that BzOH concentration had a significant effect on the initial oxidation rate (Fig. 2a). As observed from Fig. 2b, the plot of ln(initial oxidation rate) versus ln(concentration of BzOH) shows a good linear relationship (R 2 =0.998). Linear equation is obtained with slope of 0.55, which is the reaction order with respect to BzOH concentration. Similarly, the initial reaction rate was calculated for investigating the effect of the concentration of H2O2. Fig. 3a shows the BzOH concentration as a function of reaction time with different concentrations of H2O2 at 80°C, wherein the initial concentration of BzOH and catalyst amount are kept constant at 1.69molL−1 and 17.54gL−1, respectively. Fig. 3b shows the plot of ln(rate) versus ln(concentration of H2O2) which is fitted linearly with a positive slope of 0.22, namely, the reaction order for H2O2. To determine the reaction order of BzH, small amount of BzH is commonly added to the solution at the beginning of the reaction. Fig. 4a depicts the effect of BzH concentration on initial oxidation rate in the presence of BzOH (1.69molL−1), H2O2 (2.12molL−1), and Au/TS-1 catalysts (17.54gL−1) at 80°C. Fig. 4b shows the plot of ln(r) against ln(BzH concentration) gave a good straight line with slope of −0.35, suggesting that the reaction order for BzH is −0.35. The negative order kinetics implies the product (BzH) and reactants undergo competitive adsorption on the surface of the bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts. With the proceeding of the reaction, more BzH will occupy more adsorption sites to reduce the probability of surface reaction on the catalysts, resulting in the decrease in the reaction rate. This aspect shall be discussed further later on. The effect of catalyst loading on the initial oxidation rates was studied in the range of catalyst concentrations 2.92–14.62gL−1 at 80°C, in conjunction with BzOH (1.69molL−1) and H2O2 (2.12molL−1). It is evident from Fig. 5a that, with the increase in the catalyst amount, the oxidation rate increases sharply. As shown in Fig. 5b, the ln(r) changes linearly with the ln(amount of catalysts) and the slope of the straight line is 1.06. The result indicates that BzOH oxidation can be considered as a first order reaction with respect to the amount of the catalysts, which also suggest that the substances in the heterogeneous catalysis system will not likely poison the active sites [29]. 3.2.2 Determination of activation parameters The effect of temperature on the initial rate of BzOH oxidation was investigated. The kinetics of the reaction with constant BzOH (1.69molL−1) and H2O2 (2.12molL−1) concentrations, and amount of Au/TS-1 catalysts (17.54gL−1) was measured at different temperatures (35, 50, 65, 80 and 95°C). As expected, the reaction rate increased rapidly with increasing temperature (Fig. 6a). Using the obtained rate constants, the value of activation energy and pre-exponential factor were determined from the corresponding Arrhenius plot; a plot of ln(k) versus 1/T yields a straight line throughout the temperature range (R 2 =0.996), as shown in Fig. 6b. Accordingly, the slope of the straight line gives activation energy (E a) of 38.2kJmol−1, which further confirms that the reaction is kinetically controlled. The pre-exponential factor (A) was calculated to be 1.814 from the intercept of the line. The E a obtained in this research is much lower than those reported in the literature for the same reaction taking place over ammonium molybdate catalyst (84kJmol−1) and tungstic acid catalyst (96kJmol−1) [25], indicating an enhanced catalytic activity of the bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts. 3.2.3 Kinetic rate equation Based on the above results, after substituting the values of reaction orders and activation parameters into Eq. (2), the rate expression upon the power-law model now becomes: (4) r = 1.814 × e − 38.2 / R T [ BzOH ] 0.55 [ H 2 O 2 ] 0.22 [ BzH ] − 0.35 [ Cat. ] 1.06 This Eq. (4) shows the dependence of the oxidation rate (molL−1 s−1) on reaction temperature (K), concentrations of BzOH (molL−1), H2O2 (molL−1), BzH (molL−1) and the amount of catalysts (gL−1) in the reaction solution. This rate expression will allow for the prediction of the relative rate of oxidation of BzOH under different conditions. Additionally, the fractional reaction orders indicate that both the reactants and product were adsorbed at reaction temperatures. Comparison of the model prediction and experimental data is shown in Fig. 7 . As shown, there is a close similarity between the observed rates and the calculated rates with acceptable deviation (the correlation coefficient=0.961)."
8,Langmuir–Hinshelwood rate model,"3.3 Langmuir–Hinshelwood rate model Typically, Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is usually adopted to study heterogeneously catalyzed reactions and it has been found to give better fit in many instances [30]. As a result, we employed the model to describe the oxidation of BzOH with aqueous H2O2 over bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts. The standard assumptions are that (a) the surface of the catalyst is uniform and a number of adsorption sites are available to the reactants, (b) the reacting species are reversibly adsorbed, and (c) the irreversible surface reaction is the rate-controlling step in the oxidation process [31]. On these premises, the possible reaction mechanism with all the relevant reactions derived from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is schematically represented in Scheme 1 . The overall reaction can be reduced to four elementary reactions: (i) adsorption of BzOH, (ii) adsorption of H2O2, (iii) surface reaction of the adsorbed BzOH and H2O2, and (iv) desorption of BzH. According to the above reaction mechanism, the equation for the oxidation rate (unit: molL−1 gcat −1 s−1) is derived as: (5) r = k 3 K 1 K 2 [ BzOH ] [ H 2 O 2 ] ( 1 + K 1 [ BzOH ] + K 2 [ H 2 O 2 ] + K 4 [ BzH ] ) 2 where K 1 (Lmol−1) is the adsorption equilibrium constant of BzOH, K 2 (Lmol−1) is the adsorption equilibrium constant of H2O2, K 4 (Lmol−1) is the adsorption equilibrium constant of BzH, and k 3 (molL−1 gcat −1 s−1) is the reaction rate constant. This rate expression led us to evaluate the kinetic and adsorption coefficients involved in the reactions, and to analyze the main steps in the overall process. The optimized kinetic parameters for Eq. (5) were estimated by simultaneously fitting the initial rate data and species concentration data through nonlinear regression analysis using MATLAB R2010a program with an error minimization technique. To ensure that the fitting resulted in the global minimum, different starting values of the adjustable parameters were tried to ensure convergence of the program to the same minimum and the same fitting parameters for the different initial guesses. As a result, the optimized kinetic parameters are incorporated in the rate expression based on Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, and the obtained rate is as follows: (6) r = 0.0119 × [ BzOH ] [ H 2 O 2 ] ( 1 + 2.222 × [ BzOH ] + 2.330 × [ H 2 O 2 ] + 4.769 × [ BzH ] ) 2 The adsorption equilibrium constants are determined in the following order: BzOH≈H2O2 <BzH. The standard deviations of the optimal values for K 1, K 2, k 3 and K 4 were 0.393, 0.395, 0.0005 and 0.645, respectively. Note that the above-mentioned rate expression and equilibrium constants in Eq. (6) are only referred to the reaction temperature of 80°C. The rate expression based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model can be used to calculate the initial rates to allow for the comparison with experimental results. As shown in Fig. 8 , the model satisfactorily fits the experimental initial rate data, with regression correlation coefficient of above 0.975 and a mean residual below 3%, suggesting a good fitting to the initial rate data. This further proves the validity of the rate law in Eq. (6) and, hence, the proposed mechanism."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, a detailed kinetic study of BzOH oxidation on the bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts has been conducted. The reaction kinetics was initially modeled using the power law rate expression leading to reaction orders of 0.55, 0.22, −0.35 and 1.06 with respect to BzOH, H2O2, BzH and catalyst respectively; with apparent activation energy of 38.2kJmol−1. Then, the established BzOH oxidation rate was described following the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, which suggested competitive and interrelated adsorption of BzOH, H2O2 and BzH. Yet its rate expression describes satisfactorily the kinetic behavior of BzOH oxidation reaction over the bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalysts. It is our expectation that these kinetic results potentiate the practical application of the highly efficient Au/TS-1 catalysts in the near future."
