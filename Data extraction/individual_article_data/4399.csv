0,Introduction,"The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reaction converts syngas (H2 +CO) derived from coal, biomass or natural gas into liquid fuels and chemicals [1–3]. However, production of syngas from these carbon sources involves generation of a significant quantity of CO2. Therefore, the present hydrocarbon synthesis processes adopt separation of CO2 from the reformer using solvents such as Rectisol [4]. However, CO2 hydrogenation might be employed to convert CO2 in syngas to more valuable products [5–7]. Iron- and cobalt-based catalysts are used by industry to convert syngas into liquid hydrocarbons. Iron-based catalysts possess intrinsic water–gas shift (WGS) activity, such that reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) can be used to convert a fraction of CO2 into carbon monoxide, which further takes part in FTS. Under FTS conditions, cobalt has very low WGS activity and acts primarily as a methanation catalyst when CO2 is used instead of CO [6,7]. This difference between iron and cobalt catalysts is mainly due to the nature of the phases present during FTS and the intrinsic hydrogenation activity of each catalyst for CO and CO2. Iron exists in part as iron carbide which is proposed to be active for FTS, whereas metallic cobalt is the active form of cobalt. The hydrogenation activity of cobalt in the metallic form is so high that methane is the dominant product formed from CO2 [8]. It is highly desirable to lower the hydrogenation activity of cobalt such that CO2 can be converted into higher hydrocarbons either by first forming CO or partially hydrogenated CO intermediates. So far, most studies on the hydrogenation of CO2 have focused on iron-based catalysts [9–12]. In contrast, reports on the catalytic conversion of CO2 to higher hydrocarbons and alcohols by cobalt-based catalysts are scarce [5,7,8]. Recently, Owen et al. [13] showed that cobalt has the ability to hydrogenate CO2 at atmospheric pressure, and the authors claimed that the addition of alkali promoters like Na and K enhanced C5 + selectivity. However, no further reports have been published regarding the state and nature of the active phase of cobalt that is responsible for the observed increase in C5 + hydrocarbons. In the current study, three different activation conditions (H2, syngas, and CO) were employed to control the chemical nature of cobalt phases present. Activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of CO2 were evaluated using a fixed-bed reactor operating at 220°C and 1.89MPa and H2/CO2 ratio of 3.0. TPR and hydrogen chemisorption/pulse reoxidation were applied to H2-reduced catalysts to characterize dispersion and reducibility. Fresh and used catalysts, pretreated by H2, syngas, or CO, were characterized by XRD and HRTEM techniques."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation For this study, the composition of the sodium-doped cobalt catalyst was 1%Na–20%Co/SiO2, and PQ-silica CS-2133 (S BET: 351m2/g) served as the catalyst support. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO3)2·6H2O] and anhydrous sodium carbonate Na2CO3, purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, 99.5% were used as sources of cobalt and sodium, respectively. The SiO2-containing 20wt.% Co catalyst was prepared by following a two-step slurry phase impregnation method using an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate. In this method, which follows a Sasol patent [14], the ratio of the volume of solution used to the weight of alumina was 1:1, such that the volume of loading solution was approximately 2.5 times the pore volume of the catalyst. After impregnation of the aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate, excess water was removed by vacuum evaporation at 80°C. Afterwards, 1.0wt% Na was introduced to the dried catalyst by following the same slurry phase impregnation technique using an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate. Finally, the catalyst was dried overnight at 120°C and calcined in a muffle furnace at 350°C for 4h. For the purpose of comparison, cobalt catalyst without sodium (20%Co/SiO2) was prepared in the same manner as described above (with the exception of the inclusion of a sodium addition step). The calcined cobalt catalyst was pretreated at different conditions in order to obtain various forms of cobalt: (i) H2 activation: two different pretreatment temperatures were examined in order to vary the relative fractions of cobalt metal and cobalt oxide (CoO). About 2.5g of calcined cobalt catalyst (1%Na–20%Co/SiO2) were pretreated under flowing H2 (10nL/h) at 350°C for 15h to obtain primarily metallic cobalt. On the other hand, partially reduced cobalt (i.e., having higher CoO content) was obtained by reducing supported cobalt oxide (i.e., Co3O4) under flowing H2 (10nL/h) at 250°C for 15h. (ii) Syngas activation: About 2.5g of calcined cobalt catalyst (1%Na–20%Co/SiO2) were pretreated under flowing syngas at a H2:CO ratio of 1.0 (10nL/h) at 250°C for 15h. Under these conditions, cobalt mainly forms cobalt oxide (CoO) and cobalt carbide (Co2C). (iii) CO activation: About 2.5g of calcined cobalt catalyst (20%Co/SiO2 or 1%Na–20%Co/SiO2) were pretreated under CO flow (10nL/h) at 250°C for 15h to obtain a mixture of cobalt carbide (Co2C), cobalt oxide (CoO), and carbon. The presence of a small amount of metallic cobalt for the syngas and CO pretreatment methods was either detected or cannot be ruled out for the samples treated at 250°C."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The catalyst compositions of freshly activated and used catalysts after passivation were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Varian 720-ES analyzer. The materials were dissolved in a perchloric/nitric acid mixture and the emission spectra of dissolved species (Co, alkali) were compared to those of a series of standard solutions of known concentrations. Carbon analyses were made using a Leco CHN 628 analyzer. The sample was combusted at 1223K in oxygen and the carbon, as CO2, was determined using an IR detector. A Micromeritics Tri-Star system was used to determine surface area and porosity of the support and catalysts. Prior to the measurement, each sample was slowly ramped to 160°C and evacuated for 24h to approximately 50mTorr. Hydrogen chemisorption/pulse reoxidation by hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and pulse oxygen titration was measured using a Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit. Details about the chemisorption method are described elsewhere [15]. The catalysts were activated at different temperatures (250°C and 350°C) prior to hydrogen chemisorption/O2 titration measurements. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of catalysts were also recorded using the Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit. Calcined fresh samples were first purged in flowing inert gas to remove traces of water. TPR was performed using a 10% H2/Ar mixture referenced to Ar at a flowrate of 30cm3/min. The sample was heated from 323 to 1273K using a heating ramp of 10K/min. Powder X-ray diffractograms of activated and used cobalt FT catalysts were recorded after passivation (at room temperature (25°C) under flowing 1%O2 in N2) using a Philips X’Pert diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418). XRD scans were taken over the range of 2θ from 10 to 90°. The scanning step was 0.01, the scan speed was 0.0025s−1, and the scan time was 4s. The morphology and in-depth analysis of individual cobalt particles were obtained using a field emission analytical transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2010F) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. HRTEM images were recorded under optimal focus conditions at a typical magnification of 100–500K. The electron beam had a point-to-point resolution of 0.5nm. Gatan Digital Micrograph software was used for image processing."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing The experiments were conducted using a fixed bed reactor (stainless steel having a length of 17cm and an inside diameter of 1.6cm). For the experiment, 2.5g of calcined cobalt catalyst (60–100μm) were diluted with 10g of glass beads in the size range of 40–100μm, and loaded onto a quartz wool plug in the reactor. The temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored by placing a K-type thermocouple in the middle of the catalyst bed. After activation, a gas mixture, containing 75% H2 and 25% CO2 at 3.0nL/h/g catalyst, was fed to the reactor, which was maintained at a temperature of 220°C and a pressure of 1.89MPa. Brooks mass flow controllers were used to control the flow rates of H2 and CO2. The conversions of CO2 and H2 were obtained by gas-chromatography (GC) analysis (micro-GC equipped with thermal conductivity detector) of the reactor exit gas mixture. The reaction products were collected in two traps maintained at different temperatures – a hot trap (150°C), and a cold trap (5°C). The products were separated into different fractions for quantification. The liquid products condensed in the hot trap were analyzed using a HP 6890 GC with DB-5 capillary column, while the aqueous phase was analyzed using a HP 5790 GC with Porapak Q packed column. A 5973N MSD coupled to the 6890 GC from Agilent was employed for qualitative analysis of alcohols, which were further quantified using a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion and selectivity reaction parameters are defined as: conversion = 100 x n CO 2 in − n CO 2 out n CO 2 in selectivity = 100 x n product out ⋅ carbon number n CO 2 in − n CO 2 out where n CO 2 in and n CO 2 out are the numbers of moles of CO2 fed and not-consumed, respectively. The selectivity is defined as the percentage of moles of CO2 consumed to form a particular C n product (hydrocarbon, CO or oxygenate), normalized by the amount of CO2 consumed. A typical outlet gas composition is provided as a table in the supporting information for the cobalt catalysts tested for the hydrogenation reaction of CO2 at different activation conditions."
5,Results and discussion,"BET surface area and porosity data are tabulated in Table 1 . There is a decrease in the BET surface area from 351 to 247m2/g with loading of 20wt% Co onto the silica support. If SiO2 is the only contributor to the surface area, then 20%Co/SiO2 catalyst should be 351×0.72=252m2/g, which is very close to the measured value of 247m2/g. Adding 1wt% sodium did alter the BET surface area of the catalyst, which dropped further to 201m2/g. The results suggest that there is a slight pore blocking effect after addition of sodium. In agreement with this, the average pore diameter was found to be slightly lower for the case of 1%Na–20%Co/SiO2 compared to 20%Co/SiO2. The pore size distributions (PSD) from the BJH method (Fig. 1 ) for the calcined cobalt catalysts exhibit a wider PSD; the BJH average pore diameter of the 20%Co/SiO2 catalyst was found to be 10.9nm, while that of the Na-promoted catalyst was similar at 10.4nm. Hydrogen chemisorption/pulse re-oxidation data listed in Table 2 provide estimates that the average diameter of cobalt clusters was 34nm for both the undoped and Na-doped silica supported cobalt catalysts. Both catalysts exhibited a high degree of reduction (i.e., reduction at 350°C), but the one without Na was slightly higher (69%) compared to 1%Na–20%Co/SiO2 (63%). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles, provided in Fig. 1, reveal that both cobalt catalysts (with and without sodium) were reduced over a narrow temperature range in the region near 350–375°C. The reduction profile resembles the two-step process of bulk Co3O4 crystallites [16] where first, Co3O4 reduces to CoO and, in the second step, CoO reduces to Co0 metal. Fig. 2 shows that introducing 1% by weight sodium to the cobalt catalyst shifts reduction profiles of both cobalt oxides toward slightly higher temperatures. Based on the observed TPR patterns, and considering the results of pulse reoxidation for the catalysts reduced at 350°C, the activated catalysts consist primarily of metallic cobalt (Co0) and CoO after activating the 1%Na–20%Co/SiO2 catalyst with flowing H2, with the catalysts activated at 350°C being more reduced than the ones activated at 250°C. Table 3 shows the elemental analyses of fresh and used cobalt catalysts. The percentages of cobalt and sodium found in the freshly activated and used catalysts were similar within the limits of experimental error. The carbon content of the CO pretreated Na-doped cobalt catalyst was found to be more or less the same before and after reaction. After CO activation, the 20%Co/SiO2 catalyst was composed of 18% Co and 5.56% C and after the reaction with CO2, the total carbon content of the catalyst was lowered to 4.3%; this is consistent with a role of Na in stabilizing the carbide phase of cobalt during reaction. The CO2 conversions over 1%Na–20%Co/SiO2 catalyst after different pretreatment conditions are shown in Fig. 3 . The catalyst reduced at 350°C under flowing H2 displayed higher initial CO2 conversion, which then proceeded to decrease from 23.5 to 18.0% within 20h of time-on-stream. The CO2 conversion of the catalyst was found to be relatively stable at later times on-stream (i.e., approximately 15%). The catalyst pretreated at 250°C under flowing H2 showed a considerably lower CO2 hydrogenation activity, with CO2 conversions in the range of 7–10%. As shown in Fig. 3, compared to the catalyst activated in H2 at 250°C, the catalyst pretreated in flowing syngas at 250°C exhibited slightly higher CO2 conversion. Interestingly, at 250°C, the catalyst pretreated in CO displayed even higher conversion for CO2 hydrogenation; moreover, the catalyst activity remained exhibited higher stability over a period of over 100h than either the H2 or syngas pretreated catalyst following activation at 250°C. One purpose of this study is to show the advantages of carburization of sodium promoted cobalt on the product selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation. To that end, Fig. 4 shows FT product selectivity described in terms of methane, C2 +, alcohols and CO formation plotted versus the method of activation. In the case of the H2 pretreated (350°C and 250°C) sodium promoted cobalt catalysts, methane contributed in the range of 70–80% to the total CO2 being converted. The C2 + hydrocarbons and alcohols are the second and third most abundant products being formed from CO2. The syngas pretreated catalyst exhibited slightly lower methane selectivity (∼50%). A significant increase in CO selectivity was observed with the syngas pretreated cobalt. This suggests that under syngas pretreatment conditions, cobalt does not reduce completely from Co3O4 to metallic cobalt but rather remains in a partially reduced form (e.g., CoO) which could decrease CO and CO2 hydrogenation activity of cobalt. Most importantly, among the four activation conditions studied, the CO pretreated catalyst exhibited the lowest methane selectivity ranging from 8 to 16.0%. Alcohol selectivity varied between 62 and 73%. From a survey of the literature [4–8], the value of the chain growth probability factor for products obtained from CO2 hydrogenation on cobalt is significantly lower than that observed for products formed from CO hydrogenation (i.e., typical FTS conditions). Therefore, it is worthwhile to compare the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) product distributions for CO2 hydrogenation obtained over the sodium promoted catalyst for the four different pretreatment conditions. Fig. 5 displays the chain growth probability factor for hydrocarbons and oxygenates obtained from hydrogenation of carbon dioxide as a function of time on-stream. The Na-doped catalyst pretreated with H2 at 250°C and 350°C yielded a low chain growth probability factor, α, for hydrocarbons ranging from 0.45 to 0.50 as shown in Fig. 5. Although syngas and CO pretreated catalysts exhibited very similar alpha values, ranging from 0.47 to 0.55 for hydrocarbons, the values for oxygenates were different. This difference appears only during the course of synthesis. The alpha value of oxygenates for both catalysts increased from 0.25 to 0.35 during the initial 25h of synthesis but after that, the α-values for the syngas pretreated catalyst stabilized while the α-values of oxygenates for the CO pretreated catalyst continued to increase to 0.39. Perhaps the changes are due to changes in catalyst structure that occur over longer periods of time. The alpha value of oxygenates for the hydrogen pretreated sodium doped cobalt at 350°C was not included in Fig. 5 due to a lack of formation of higher oxygenates (C3 +) under those testing conditions. Another interesting feature emerges by comparing the distribution of alcohols obtained from the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide for different pretreatment conditions (Fig. 6 ). The fraction of methanol present was very low, and ethanol was present in the largest proportion (50–65mol%), with the fractions of alcohols higher than propanol decreasing with increasing carbon number. Fig. 6 shows that methanol selectivity decreased and the selectivity to higher alcohols increased by changing activation conditions at 250°C from H2 to CO. In general, alcohols, acids and carbonyl compounds are the characteristic products of the synthesis when iron catalysts are employed; however, the products do not contain more than 3% of alcohols when a typical cobalt catalyst (0.5%Pt–25%Co/Al2O3) is used [17]. This difference arises mainly due to differences in the rate of hydrogenation of CO or CO2 over cobalt and iron catalyst surfaces. The hydrogenation activity is known to be higher for un-promoted cobalt compared to iron. However, the present data demonstrate that carburization of sodium promoted cobalt using CO can mitigate excessive hydrogenation activity, perhaps either by depositing sodium onto the active surface of cobalt carbide, or by stabilizing cobalt carbide for extensive periods of time during CO2 hydrogenation. To examine the types of cobalt phases present before and after hydrogenation reactions of CO2, the freshly activated and used cobalt catalysts were subjected to passivation under flowing 1% O2 in N2 at room temperature (25°C) for 6h. XRD and HRTEM techniques were used to evaluate the various cobalt phases present in the catalysts. Fig. 7 shows the results of HRTEM characterization of cobalt catalysts after H2, syngas or CO activation at 250°C, followed by passivation under flowing 1% O2 in N2 at room temperature (25°C) for 6h. In general, the H2-pretreated or CO-pretreated catalysts (A, C and D) exhibited much smaller CoO and Co2C particles (4–5nm) compared to the syngas pretreated catalyst (B), whose particle sizes ranged from 6 to 8nm. Partially reduced cobalt oxide, CoO, is observed with its characteristic d spacing of 0.26nm corresponding to the (111) plane of CoO [18] on all of the three catalysts studied here. In addition, the CO pretreated cobalt catalyst displays a lattice spacing of 0.25nm that may be attributed to the (101) plane of Co2C. The presence of carbon is also confirmed from the elemental composition of the circled region as shown in Fig. 7 using TEM operated under EDX conditions. Fig. 8 displays X-ray diffraction patterns of fresh and used cobalt catalyst samples. The diffractogram of the freshly reduced sodium promoted cobalt (using H2 at 250°C) displays broad diffraction peaks at 37 and 43 degrees (2θ) which correspond to the CoO phase (JCPDS card: 72-1474). In addition, the profile (black line) also shows a distinct diffraction line for what appears to be Co-fcc metal. The XRD patterns of freshly activated 1%Na–20%Co/SiO2 catalyst pretreated with syngas (H2 +CO) at 250°C exhibit more intense peaks which correspond to the CoO phase. In addition to diffraction peaks of cobalt oxide (CoO), some peaks attributed to cobalt carbide (Co2C) species (JCPDS card: 72-1369, 2θ =42.5, 45.7) were detected for the CO activated sodium promoted catalyst. For the purpose of comparison, the XRD patterns of an un-promoted silica supported cobalt catalyst after CO activation is also included in Fig. 8. Despite the differences in level of noise, there was no noticeable difference in the phases of cobalt detected between undoped and sodium-doped catalysts after CO activation; only lines characteristic of CoO and Co2C were observed. Significant differences were noted in the diffraction patterns of all three used sodium doped catalysts, as well as the undoped used catalyst, in comparison with the freshly activated samples. In the case of the H2-pretreated catalyst (250°C), before starting the reaction, as the catalyst contained contributions from CoO and Co fcc metal; however, decreases in the diffraction lines for CoO were observed, along with an increase in the diffraction line of Co fcc metal, following CO2 hydrogenation. In the case of the syngas-pretreated Na-doped catalyst, before starting the reaction a majority of the cobalt was present as CoO with a contribution from Co2C (cobalt carbide). Following CO2 hydrogenation, diffraction lines characteristic of CoO diminished somewhat, while those assigned to Co2C increased. Moreover, a peak characteristic of Co fcc metal emerged. For the CO-pretreated Na-doped catalyst, prior to starting the reaction, the catalyst displayed only peaks consistent with CoO and Co2C. Following CO2 hydrogenation, the same diffraction lines were observed, although the intensities of the lines characteristic of CoO were slightly lower. No significant peak for Co fcc metal could be detected. In contrast, while the freshly CO-activated undoped catalyst exhibited peaks characteristic of CoO and Co2C, the used catalyst exhibited three diffraction lines in the 2θ range of 40–48° corresponding to the hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure of metallic cobalt. This difference indicates that sodium is essential in preserving the cobalt carbide phase under CO2 hydrogenation conditions. Because the intensities of the diffraction peaks for CoO diminished following exposure of the catalyst to CO2 hydrogenation for an extended period of time, the results demonstrate that the CoO phase is not stable under this net reducing atmosphere. EXAFS/XANES investigations of typical cobalt catalysts under FTS conditions have shown that residual CoO tends to reduce with time on-stream [19,20]. In the current context, even though CO2 is being used instead of CO, CoO remaining after activation of the Na-doped catalyst with H2 at 250°C tends to reduce with time on-stream. The CO pretreated Na-doped catalyst also underwent reduction, but in that case CoO decreased and Co2C was detected, with no significant diffraction lines corresponding to metallic cobalt being observed (although one cannot completely rule out the presence of cobalt metal particles with insufficient long range order to be detected by XRD). In order to understand the role of sodium on carburization of cobalt and the product selectivity for hydrogenation reactions of CO2, a comparison was made between an undoped silica supported cobalt catalyst (20%Co/SiO2) and a Na-doped cobalt catalyst (1%Na–20%Co/SiO2). Surprisingly, the 20%Co/SiO2 catalyst yielded more than 99% alkanes (Table 4 ) consisting primarily of methane (96.7%) and a minor fraction of C2–C4 hydrocarbons (C2-1.2%, C3-0.8%, C4-0.5%). The selectivity of the undoped cobalt catalyst did not change with time; however, there was a chemical change such that the cobalt carbide phase became more metallic in character with time on-stream. Therefore, it is not clear to which phase (Co metal, cobalt carbide, or an intermediary structure (e.g., a lower carbide than observed immediately following activation)) the high methane selectivity corresponds. Additional work is needed to elucidate this aspect. In contrast, when the catalyst was doped with sodium, the CO-pretreated catalyst produced less methane (15.3%) but yielded more alcohol (73.2%) from carbon dioxide. While cobalt carbide was detected on either catalyst initially, only the catalyst with sodium retained the carbide phase and converted CO2 selectively into primary alcohols. The results indicate that the promoting effect of sodium is involved with the carburized form of cobalt. It is well known that metallic cobalt hydrogenates carbon dioxide directly to methane [7]; therefore, one possibility is that the undoped catalyst converted to metallic cobalt rapidly, leading to high methane selectivity. It is clear that by adding alkali (in this case, Na) to the carbide form of cobalt, hydrogenation activity can be suppressed and controlled to a certain degree. Higher rates of formation of alcohols over partially reduced cobalt were proposed by Blanchard et al. [21] to occur by a mechanism in which CO insertion would occur on oxidized sites of cobalt and the formation of hydrogenated intermediates on metallic centers when syngas was used as a feed. In another study, Jiao et al. [22] have recently suggested that an appropriate ratio of Co2+/Coo and Co2C contributes to higher alcohol selectivity for the FT reaction over lanthanum promoted cobalt catalysts. Our recent unpublished data [23] of higher alcohol selectivity for a Co/CeSiMn catalyst suggest that carbon deposition is feasible under FT synthesis conditions and this causes an increase in alcohol selectivity with TOS. Based on our results, it is hypothesized that sodium in association with the carbide form of cobalt enhances the production of higher hydrocarbons, and particularly alcohol formation from carbon dioxide through a CO insertion mechanism as described in Scheme 1 . This large shift in the product selectivity from methane to alcohols by changing activation conditions leads us to believe that the method of activation of cobalt as well as the presence or the absence of alkali, play vital roles in the hydrogenation of CO2."
6,Conclusions,"The present data suggest that the carbide form of cobalt generated from carburization of sodium promoted cobalt oxide (1%Na–20%Co/SiO2) in CO is active and selective for the synthesis of higher alcohols directly from CO2. Ethanol was formed to a great extent and the chain growth for alcohols follows an ASF distribution. On the other hand, methane is a more dominant product (72.9%) when a fraction of cobalt oxide was reduced completely to cobalt metal; cobalt pretreated under flowing syngas at 250°C decreased methane selectivity only to a certain extent (55.4%). The CO pretreated catalyst exhibited a significantly lower selectivity for methane (15.3%) and remarkably increased the alcohol selectivity to 73.2%. Carburized cobalt in the absence of sodium converted to metallic cobalt and behaved in a similar to the catalyst pretreated with H2 (i.e., which displayed metallic cobalt) for hydrogenating carbon dioxide, with high methane selectivity. The results suggest that sodium in association with cobalt carbide is active for the reverse water–gas shift reaction, which is likely a prerequisite for the conversion of CO2 to alcohols. The carbide phase was relatively stable (0.62% CO2 conversion loss/day) under the reaction conditions used in this work, highlighting a role played by Na in stabilizing the carbide phase."
