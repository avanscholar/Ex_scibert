0,Introduction,"Different categories of renewable sources of energy include solar, geothermal, wind, waves, hydric and biomass has been already used in several countries, according the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Biomass has being studied exhaustively in the recent years, and it is considered one of the most promising substituent of the fossils fuels [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass (LB) is originated from agricultural residues (wheat straw, sugar cane bagasse, corn bran), wood and plants [2]. LB is composed of cellulose (30–50%), hemicellulose (15-30%) and lignin (15-30%) [3–5]. Cellulose and hemicellulose are organic polymers; their monomeric units are composed of glucose and xylose, respectively [3,5]. These organic polymers can be cleaved by acid hydrolysis [4]. Glucose and xylose, can produce several industrial products like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, ethylene, propylene, glycol, sorbitol, mannitol, furfural and levulinic acid (LA) [6,7]. Levulinic acid (LA) was considered one of the 12 most important molecules from biomass by the U.S. Department of Energy (US-DOE) [8]. Its importance is because it can be used in different segments of the industry such as ingredient for personal care, adsorbents, electronics, photography, batteries, drug delivery system, lubricants and chemical intermediates [8,9]. The value-added chemicals which can be obtained from levulinic acid transformations are 1,4-petanediol (PD), 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and gamma-valerolactone [9]. Gamma-valerolactone (GVL) is a very interesting and important molecule for the industry, as it can be used as food additive, solvent, fuel additives, insecticides, adhesives and chemical intermediates for the production of 2‐methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), pentanoic acid, etc [7,9–11]. Extensive research has been performed on the hydrogenation of LA to GVL using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.that operate under milder reactions, give higher selectivities and can be recycled continuously are attracting considerable attention. GVL can be obtained from the hydrogenation of levulinic acid, over heterogeneous catalysts using different metals [7,12–17], supports [11,18–20], co-catalyst [21], bimetallic catalyst [22,23] (Fig. 1 ). Ruthenium-based catalysts are widely applied to this reaction [12,13,15]. Further, the influence of support has been shown to significantly affect GVL yield [12,18,19] and to evaluate the deactivation of the catalyst is also of interest. One interesting support for catalytic reactions is the mixture of titanium and silica oxides. This support can increase the surface area and preserve the n-type semiconductor site of TiO2, while maintaining the characteristics of SiO2 (high surface area, mechanical and thermal stability) [24,25]. This paper presents the influence of supports SiO2, TiO2 and a hybrid of TiO2–SiO2 (TS) using CTAB as a surfactant in their preparation for to obtain ruthenium-based catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of LA to GVL under mild reaction conditions. Different reactions conditions like pressure, temperature, solvent, time, and recyclability were studied."

3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The synthesis of supports materials started from 25 mmol of TEOS, 3.37 mmol TIOT and 1.5 mL of ethanol for the hybrid material (TS) and other solution of 2.5 g of CTAB and 10 mL of ethanol. The solutions containing TEOS was slowly added to the CTAB solution and stirred for 30 min and were add in a Teflon reactor and stirred for 30 min. For the SiO2, 28.3 mmol of TEOS was used, without TIOT. For TiO2 28.3 mmol of TIOT was used, without TEOS. The reactor was sealed and stirred at 40 °C for 24 h. After this, the reactor was placed in the oven at 90 °C for 48 h. The reactor was opened to dry the material at 110 °C. The materials were heated in an opened tubular oven without gas flow at 550 °C for 3 h with 10 °C min−1 rate. The supports TiO2-SiO2 denominate TS, SiO2 and TiO2 were impregnated with an aqueous solution of RuCl3 (5% wt/wt) by wetness impregnation. After the water evaporation, the catalyst was dried at 110 °C. The catalysts were reduced prior to use. The reduction of ruthenium was performed in a tubular oven using a mixture of H2/N2 (8%) with 50 mL min−1 flow, at 300 °C for 2 h with a heat rate of 10 °C min−1. The catalysts were denominated Ru-TS,5% Ru-SiO2 and 5%Ru-TiO2(5%Ru wt/wt)."

The x ray diffraction patterns were identified using the Search-Match by Crystallographica software. 2.3.4 Adsorption/desorption of N2 The textural properties of catalysts were measured from nitrogen adsorption isotherms, in a Quantachrome NOVA equipment at 77 K. Specific surface areas were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation (BET method) from adsorption isotherm generated in a relative pressure range 0.07 < P/Po < 0.3. The average pore diameter was determined by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from the N2 desorption isotherms. 2.3.5 Transmission electronic microscope (TEM) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken with a Tecnai-G2-20 (FEI) electron microscope with an acceleration potential of 200 kV. 2.3.6 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The infrared spectrum was recorded in a Perkin Elmer FTIR RXI equipment. with a range of 400 – 4000 cm−1 with 64 scans. The samples were dilluted in KBr, previously dried at 110 °C."
5,Levulinic acid hydrogenation,"2.4 Levulinic acid hydrogenation The catalytic tests were carried out in a stainless steel reactor (100 mL). A 700 rpm stirring was used in all experiments. A 30 mL volume of a 0.5 mol L−1 of levulinic acid and 0.05 g catalyst (5%wt Ru) was utilized, unless otherwise stated. The reactor was purged three times with H2 to remove atmospheric air before being pressurized with H2. Catalyst recycling experiments were performed as follows: after the reaction, the catalyst was centrifuged and washed with ethanol (25 mL) three times. The catalyst was dried at room temperature. The reactions were followed by gas chromatography (GC) (Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus instrument, Rtw®-wax capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). Periodically aliquots were analyzed at appropriate time intervals. The products identification was made by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) GC2010/QP2010-GC/MS equipment, using an electron impact detector at 70 eV. The major product (GVL) was isolated by vacuum distillation and analyzed by 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR), 13C-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C-NMR) and DEPT-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (DEPT-NMR) in a Bruker 200 MHz AVANCE DPX 200 spectrometer using acetone-d as solvent (see Supporting Information).

6,Results,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The powder XRD patterns of the catalysts are shown in the Fig. 2 . The Ru-TiO2 presented reflections patterns relative of rutile and mainly anatase crystalline structure. The silica supported catalyst (Ru-SiO2) showed a broad reflection in 23°, which is due to the amorphous silica support [28]. The hybrid Ru-TS has the broad diffraction in 23° relative to silica structure, and diffractions of anatase phase of TiO2. It is not possible to observe the rutile phase in the hybrid material, just the anatase phase, although not as pronounced as the TiO2 material. The specific surface area BET and average pore diameter BJH are shown in the Table 1 . It was observed that the ruthenium containing pure silica showed the highest specific area, the addition of TiO2 in the SiO2 structure showed decreases the specific surface area value (740 to 289 m2 g−1), probably the amorphous SiO2 phase delays the formation of the anatase/rutile TiO2 phases in the pore walls of SiO2 contributing to maintain a specific area higher than TiO2. Further, the Ru-TiO2 exhibited the drastic drop in the specific surface area, which is inherent TiO2-based materials. The Ru-TS material have the highest pore volume value, this suggests that the presence of TiO2 forming a hybrid support contributes to a slight improvement in the pore volume of the material. The increase of pore volume and average pore diameter in the impregnated catalyst Ru-TS is probably due to an intraparticules formation. Adsorption isotherms in the Fig. 3 are type IV according to the IUPAC classification, it is characteristically of mesoporous materials (2–50 nm), implying that the catalysts have cylindrical shaped mesopores, as expected for materials obtained using surfactant, except for the Ru-TiO2, this presents an isotherm type II, characteristics of a non-porous material, which is in agreement with the low pore volume (Table 1). The Fig. 4 shows the pore distribution of the catalysts, it was observed that the silica-supported catalyst has a narrow distribution pore, centered in ∼4 nm. The insertion of TiO2 in the SiO2 structure changes the porous characteristics of the material. The Ru-TS catalyst has a wide pore distribution, as previously mentioned due to the formation of intraparticulate pores, which probably prevents the formation of anatase /rutile phases. 3.1.1 Temperature programmed reduction The TPR profiles are shown in the Fig. 5 and are characteristics for ruthenium supported catalyst [26,27]. It is possible note the presence of two reduction events close to 169 °C for all materials, these events are assigned to ruthenium reduction from chlorine and oxychlorine species, respectively (as represented in Fig. 6 ) [26]. Ru-TS and Ru-TiO2 can be completely reduced until 200 °C, while Ru-SiO2 has a broadening reduction profile; this is an indication of a higher interaction between support/ruthenium. The reduction events in the Ru-TiO2 in temperatures higher than 400 °C, are probably the reduction of exposed titanium in the catalyst surface. The absence of reduction peaks corresponding to TiO2 and indicates this are non-reducible under TPR analysis conditions The FTIR results (Figure S.9, Supplementary Information) of support, showed two peaks referents to the Ti-O-Si (960 cm−1) and Si-O-Si (1260 cm−1) vibrations [25]. This is an indicative of the titania doped silica structure. The transmission electronic microscope (TEM) of all materials are presented in the Figs. 7–9 , in SI can be found other TEM images (Figure S.10) and the element map of TS support (Figure S.11). The element map of TS support, showed the dispersion of titanium in the doped silica structure. The catalysts showed an average particle size of 2–3 nm for ruthenium. It is possible to see a good dispersion of the ruthenium nanoparticles over all the supports. The TS and SiO2 supported catalyst, showed an amorphous structure organization, which agrees with the XRD analysis. The Ru-TiO2 material has an organized structure that can be seen in the TEM images, this structural organization agrees with the XRD analysis."
8,Catalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid The initial levulinic acid hydrogenation experiments were performed in order to verify the behavior of the Ru-TS catalyst in various solvents to evaluate the influence in the γ-valerolactone selectivity (Table 2 ). The use of aprotic solvents THF and 1,4-dioxane (Table 2, entries 4 and 5, respectively) resulted in a low conversion of levulinic acid furthermore, the reactions were not selective for GVL. In the polar solvents, as the alcohols (Table 2, entries 1–3) the conversion of LA increased (>80%) with a good selectivity for GVL. In methanol and ethanol, the conversions were similar, but the selectivity for GVL is favored in ethanol. Tan et al. [29], evaluated the hydrogen solubility in different solvents in the levulinic acid hydrogenation and verified that ethanol guarantee a better solubility of hydrogen, which is agreement with the obtained yield for different alcohols (Table 2, entry 2). As can be seen in Fig. 10 , in the methanol solvent the conversion can achieve 89% of LA in 3 h, however the selectivity for GVL is low. In n-butanol the selectivity is 70%, nevertheless after 8 h, a satisfactory conversion of LA is achieved (80%). In the ethanol solvent, the LA hydrogenation presents high selectivity for GVL, after 6 h is 80% (84% in 8 h) with high conversion. Probably the solvent leads to polarization of the carboxylic acid group in addition to maintaining the higher solubility of H2. The temperature influence for GVL production is presented in the Table 3 . At 70 °C, the maximum GVL yield obtained in 6 h was 62% (Table 3, entry 3), similar results were obtained in a shorter reactional time at 100 °C (Table 3, entry 5) and 130 °C (Table 3, entry 7). This suggests that over 100 °C, using Ru-TS, the conversion of LA is most favored, without loss of selectivity. The effect of hydrogen pressure is illustrated in the Fig. 11 . In general, for liquid-phase hydrogenation, it is highly likely that the reaction can be rate limited by mass transfer. The increase in pressure has a significant improvement in conversion values and selectivity for GVL. Probably, in pressures higher than 20 atm of H2 the gas diffusion is efficient, ensuring an improvement in the levulinic acid conversion and selectivity for γ-valerolactone. (Fig. 11). Similar yield for GVL was obtained at 20 and 30 atm. With the increase of the hydrogen pressure to 40 atm, the GVL selectivity decreased significantly, this can be attributed to the formation of ethyl levulinate. To investigate the effect of reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure were conducted experiments on different combinations of temperatura/pressure (Table 4 ). It was observed, that the conversion was improved in temperatures higher than 100 °C, as previously evaluated (Table 4). The highest yield of GVL is achieved at 100 °C and 40 atm of H2 (Table 4, entry 8). However, a significant result is obtained at 100 °C and 20 atm (Table 4, entry 2), the yield was 89%. at temperatures higher than 100 °C may contribute to the increase of the AL hydrogenation rate with 100% conversion and maximum selectivity to GVL, however, probably under drastic conditions of high temperatures and pressure, lead to the formation of their respective ester processes are known for their high activity and selectivity for the desired product, for this reason this system was compared with the heterogeneous Ru-TS catalyst versus homogeneous catalytic systems to evaluate GVL yield [30]. The results are shown in Table 5 . The Ru-TS heterogeneous catalyst showed higher yields for GVL than the homogeneous system (Table 5, entry 1). After 24 h of reaction was not possible to achieve elevated yield for GVL in catalytic homogeneous systems (Table 5, entries 3, 5), probably due the ester product is favored, ethyl levulinate (Fig. 12 ). These results suggest that the hybrid inorganic support of TiO2-SiO2 contributes to the activation and diffusion of hydrogen on its surface, resulting in better adsorption of H2 and levulinic acid on the metal surface (Fig. 13 ). The TON of Ru-TS was 108 times greater and 45 times greater than RuCl3 and RuCl3/4PPh3 in 6 h reaction, respectively (Table 5, entries 1, 2 and 4). The Table 6 shows the results about the support influence in the selective hydrogenation of LA. The supported ruthenium catalysts Ru-TS, Ru-TiO2 and Ru-SiO2 (Table 6, entries 1–3) presented yields higher than 80% in 6 h reaction. The TiO2 based material presented a great selectivity for GVL, compared with the SiO2 material. While the SiO2 presented a higher conversion for LA, compared with the TiO2 material. However, the Ru-TS (Table 6, entry 1) showed high conversion (similar the SiO2 catalyst) and high selectivity (similar the TiO2 catalyst). The hybrid TiO2-SiO2 support contributes with high ruthenium catalyst activity, due their characteristics: specific surface area, metal dispersion and accessibility to metallic centers. The ruthenium reduction step was very important for the AL hydrogenation whereas unreduced ruthenium was not selective for LA hydrogenation (yield decreased to 20% for GVL), while the reduced catalyst showed a yield of 89% (entries 4 and 1, respectively). The non-reduced catalyst favored the selectivity for the esterification product (ethyl levulinate). A reason for the low yield for GVL, in the non-reduced catalyst, is the ruthenium chloride lixiviation, once it has a slight interaction with the support. Other hypothesis is the oxidation state of ruthenium species are not able to activate the hydrogen molecule. The Ru/C is often described as one of the best catalyst in the literature [12,15,21,31–33]. Their activity was compared with the catalysts in this paper. The Ru/C was prepared with the same ruthenium percentage in mass by the wetness impregnation as described in the experimental section. The yield for GVL is significantly higher when using Ru-TS (Table 6, entries 1 vs 5). Probably, the pore channels of the Ru/C material are not as accessible as those of the Ru-TS material. The recyclability of a catalyst is one of the most important characteristics for heterogeneous liquid phase catalysis. Catalyst deactivation can be caused by leaching of the active species or because of metal sintering. We have been studied the reuse of the catalysts. It was obtained a high efficiency for Ru-TS and Ru-SiO2 after three cycles (Fig. 14 ). The Ru-TiO2 loses their activity during the reuse test, probably due a metal leaching; which it is based on a coloration change in the reaction medium. The selectivity of reuse remained constant around 90% for Ru-TS and 85% for Ru-SiO2 cycles. With the objective of evaluating the catalytic activity of the best catalysts of this work, were compared according to the specific surface area, equaling the area values per m2 of the Ru-TS and Ru-SiO2 catalysts (Table 7 ). The Ru-TS (289 m2 g−1) showed an activity greater than Ru-SiO2 (740 m2 g−1) using equal values of specific surface area (Table 7). Comparatively, this indicates that TS support contributes with ruthenium catalytic performance rather than silica in the selective hydrogenation of Al to GVL by specific surface area. In this case, the yield for GVL using of Ru-SiO2 (Table 7, entry 2) is similar to the reaction in the absence of catalyst. (Table 6, entry 6)."
9,Conclusion,"Ruthenium based catalysts, supported in matrices of silica, titania and a hybrid titania-silica supports. The Ru-TS catalyst is proven to be an efficient catalyst for the levulinic acid hydrogenation with high selectivity for g- valerolactone. The prepared Ru-TS presented high yield (89%) for GVL production in mild reaction conditions. The Ru-TS and Ru-SIO2 catalysts were reused without loss of catalytic activity. Comparing the catalyst load per m2, the Ru-TS catalyst proved to be the most efficient."
