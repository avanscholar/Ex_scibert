0,Introduction,"Self-healing hydrogels, regarded as smart hydrogels, are durable, automatically repair in response to damage, prolong material's service life, and reduce costs with repair [1,2]. The fascinating performance of smart hydrogels has been explored for biomedical (scaffolds and tissue engineering) and industrial (coatings, sealants, and sensors) applications [3,4]. The common self-healing behavior depends on the inherent reversibility of dynamic chemical bonds [5,6] or supramolecular interactions [7] (ionic bonds [8], hydrogen bonds [9,10], and hydrophobic interactions [11,12]). Biocompatible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer hydrogel has demonstrated excellent physical properties, and to be easily processed, biocompatible, non-carcinogenic, and biodegradable [13–15]. In the absence of organic cross-linkers, PVA hydrogel physically cross-linked via freeze-thaw cycles (F-T cycles), also can automatically self-heal [16–18]. The PVA hydrogels (~200 kPa) display effective self-healing properties, which enables them to rearrange inter-chain or intra-chain hydrogen bonds at fractured surfaces. In hydrogels with 20 and 35 percentage by weight (%wt) of PVA, the self-healing capacity was determined to be 40% and 72%, respectively, after 48 hours (h) at 25 °C without any external irritation [17]. As can be seen, hydrogel self-healing is usually a slow process. In addition, the fragile nature and weak mechanical properties of PVA hydrogels limit its application [19–21]. Importantly, the mechanical and self-healing properties of hydrogels are mutually exclusive [22]. So far, most smart hydrogels either lack an efficient energy dissipation or have a low mechanical strength [23–25]. Furthermore, several types of polymer hydrogels have been developed to improved toughness, including double-network (DN) [9,22], hydrophobic-associated [23,26], interpenetrating network (IPN) [15,27], and nanocomposite (NC) hydrogels [28,29]. Recently, the addition of graphene oxide (GO) was reported to largely improve the performance of PVA [21,27]. A B-GO/PVA composite hydrogel involves the formation of a physical network, using the F-T method and chemical cross-linking with boric acid, to enhance its performance (a GO content of 0.1 wt% yields a 144% increase in fracture tensile strength) [14]. On the other hand, agar/HPAAm DN gels, consisting of hybrid physical and chemical cross-links, exhibit excellent mechanical strength, and self-healing properties at room temperature (RT) (40% recovery after 24 h) [23]. The hybrid chemical/physical double-network structure of the PVA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel demonstrates a self-healing capability of up to 68% after 48 h at RT [9]. Despite its improved mechanical performance, a highly entangled network exerts a significant influence on the self-healing behavior [23,30]. Generally, a tougher hydrogel is associated with reduced polymer chain mobility, diminishing the self-healing capacity. Therefore, to create a smart hydrogel the optimal balance between mechanical performance and self-healing ability needs to be achieved. Most smart hydrogels developed so far were involved in a long-term healing process, commonly accomplished within 12–48 h at RT. In those cases, the self-healing properties were expected to be triggered by external stimuli, such as heat, pH alterations, moisture [21], or magnetic changes [2], while the mechanical performance of the hydrogel was maintained. Melamine was shown to enhance the mechanical properties of the PVA physical hydrogel, preserving its shape during deformation under wet conditions. Moreover, self-healing and shape memory is triggered by ultrasound-induced thermal effects within the hydrogel, which primarily melt the cross-linked domains [31]. Hybrid chemical/physical double-network structure PVA/PEG hydrogels face network disruption upon heating at 90 °C, when this temperature is applied to construct shape recovery [9]. The PVA hydrogel exhibits reduced sensitivity to external stimuli [32], which required the introduction of additional stimuli-responsive materials to trigger a rapid self-healing capacity. Recently, two-dimensional materials were found have numerous intriguing properties and to act as an extra cross-linking network to improve functionality, performance, and self-healing capacity in response to external cues [33]. Boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) are a layered material referred to as white graphene [34,35]. The extraordinary features of few-layered BNNSs, including insulation, high thermal conductivity, chemical inertness, and excellent mechanical strength, make them a promising material for multiple applications [36–38]. In particular, BNNSs are the most effective two-dimensional materials for reinforcing polymeric composites, remarkably improving mechanical and thermal properties [29,37,39,40]. Additionally, emerging approaches for functionalization and exfoliation of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have proven to greatly promote the compatibility, dispersion, and interfacial interaction in polymer composites. The hydrogen bonds formed in PAI/3D–BN composites provide good mechanical, electrical insulation and thermal conductivity properties for electronics [41]. The application of OH-BNNSs in hydrogels for drug delivery [20] and amino-, OH-, and sulfanilic acid (SA)-functionalized BNNSs in films for dye filtration [42–44] confirm the ability of BNNSs to improve thermal stability, conductivity, and mechanical strength in PVA-based composites. In this study, our aim was to create a hydrogel endowed with thermal-healing properties and enhanced mechanical qualities, and that simultaneously maintained its self-healing capabilities. For that, we employed a novel thermal-healing hydrogel which combines the nanocomposite and higher degree of cross-linking advantages of IPN hydrogels. Without resorting to organic cross-linkers, we used BNNSs as a second cross-linker and thermal response trigger within the PVA-based network. As the interfacial interaction between BNNSs and PVA polymer is crucial for improving performance and thermal conductivity, we modified hydrophobic BNNSs by adding three different acrylic amines, through a Lewis acid-base interaction. Such modification further promoted BN exfoliation and formation of a BNNSs network, prior to compatibility with the PVA matrix. We explored whether the intrinsic properties of amine-BNNSs and its unique structures could effectively conduct thermal energy, triggering thermal-healing, while enhancing the synergistic effect of dissipated energy and bearing capacity in PVA/BNNSs hybrid hydrogel systems. Although previous studies have explored the properties of PVA composites, in this study we applied different fabrication methods and employed amine instead of hydroxyl groups, to functionalize and create different BNNSs conformation networks to produce a hydrogel with a high degree of cross-linking. While most PVA/BNNSs composites are used for dye filtration, few studies have investigated the self-healing performance of these composites. However, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to apply amino-BNNSs as a cross-linker and thermal trigger in a PVA hydrogel for the self-healing study."
1,Methods,
2,Exfoliation and surface modification of BNNSs,"2.1 Exfoliation and surface modification of BNNSs The exfoliation and dispersion of h-BN (99.5% 325 mesh, Alfa Aesar) with various alkylamine moieties was carried out under the same experimental conditions and procedures. The dose of the three amine groups was equal to that of the 2.5 g of BNNSs used for the fabrication. A bath sonication (KUDOS, 40 kHz) was used for exfoliating BNNSs from bulk BN using isopropanol (IPA) as a solvent. Then, BNNSs were functionalized with 2,2′-(Ethylenedioxy) bis(ethylamine), N,N′-Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine, and Tris(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)amine; the amino-functionalized BNNSs were called E-BNNSs, N-BNNSs, and T-BNNSs, respectively. Afterwards, the prepared products were incubated overnight to allow aggregation of large-scale BNNSs precipitates and collected after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 40 min. Finally, for the extraction cycle, BNNSs were washed with deionized water and lyophilized overnight in a freeze dryer."
3,Structural characterization of BNNSs,"2.2 Structural characterization of BNNSs The alkylamine moieties grafted onto BNNSs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, PerkinElmer). The chemical composition was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using a detector (Bruker Co.) equipped with a scanning electron microscope. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6500F, JEOL) was used to observe the morphology, while the thickness of functionalized BNNSs was assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), employing an NX10 system (Park, Suwon, Korea). The crystalline structure of hydrogels was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D2 Phaser (BRUKER) using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm). The thermal decomposition patterns of amino-BNNSs were probed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a thermal rate of 20 °C per min, over a temperature range of 30–600 °C, under a steady flow of nitrogen."
4,Preparation of PVA/BNNSs hydrogels,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/BNNSs hydrogels The homogenous hydrogel was prepared using the freeze-thaw method. Briefly, BN nanosheets were well-dispersed in deionized water using a sonicator, and added to a solution of 20 wt% PVA (Sigma-Aldrich, MW: 89,000–98,000, 99+% hydrolyzed) at 95 °C, that was stirred for 3 h at various weight ratios (0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 wt%). The mixed solutions were sonicated to remove any bubbles and poured into the plastic model, followed by freezing at −20 °C for 1 h and thawing at 25 °C for 1 h (one F-T cycle). Hydrogels of different proportions were prepared using this procedure. All hydrogels and controls contained 20 wt% PVA, corresponding to a weight ratio of 2:8 of PVA and deionized water. Each solution was prepared using predefined 20 wt% PVA and varying amounts of as-prepared BNNSs to reach a final concentration of 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 wt% in a total volume of 8 mL deionized water (e.g. 0.05 wt% BNNSs in PVA corresponded to 1 mg of BNNSs added to a solution of 20 wt% PVA)."
5,Hydrogel characterization,"2.4 Hydrogel characterization The hydrogel obtained was incubated at 25 °C to slowly dry until its weight reached equilibrium. Drying was subsequently completed by freeze-drying, yielding a dehydrated hydrogel. Afterwards, crystallinity was analyzed by XRD (BRUKER) using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) and FTIR (PerkinElmer). The mechanical properties were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) using the Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (TA Q800), with tensile strength determined at 25 °C and during 1 h of heating. After freezing in liquid nitrogen, the dehydrated hydrogel was broken into two sections to observe its morphology by FESEM (JSM-6500F, JEOL). Pre-weighed dry samples were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions at various temperatures and then kept at a constant temperature of 37 °C for one week. Swelling tests were then performed at predetermined time points to investigate the swelling properties of the hydrogel, according to Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) Equilibrium water content EWC = weight of the as − prepared hydrogel − weight − weight of the dry hydrogel weight of the as − prepared hydrogel × 100 % (2) Degree of swelling = weight of the swollen rehydrogel − weight of the dry hydrogel weight of the dry hydrogel × 100 %"
6,Analysis of self-healing behaviors,"2.5 Analysis of self-healing behaviors The PVA/BNNSs hydrogels were cut at the middle in two separate pieces, and the two fractured surfaces were immediately brought into contact. After self-healing for 1 h in the presence or absence of external thermal stimuli (at 25 °C in air and at 37 °C in a pre-heated oven), the performance of the virginal and self-healing specimens was measured using tensile stress-strain tests. The self-healing capacity of each sample was defined as the ratio of the tensile strength at the point of break after healing to the tensile strength before healing."
7,Results and discussion,"The hybrid hydrogel created in this study relied on the ability of PVA polymer chains to penetrate the ordered BNNSs network by the action of freeze-thaw cycles. We used the liquid sonication method to fabricate lamellar BNNSs using a polar solvent (IPA), based on Lewis acid-base interactions. We observed that the binding strength and steric hindrance of the Lewis base attached to BNNSs (amino-BNNSs) depended on the amine group. Nevertheless, all amino groups displayed steric stability, and bridged interfacial compatibility with the BNNSs network and the PVA matrix. In addition, we found that BNNSs functioned as a thermal trigger in the hydrogel system, ultimately regulating the self-healing properties of the PVA chains. Based on Lewis acid-base interactions (Scheme 1 ), the electron-rich nitrogen site is easily available to interact with the vacant orbital of boron atoms in the h-BN [35,45]. Here, to characterize the amine groups in the functionalized BNNSs we performed FTIR, EDS and XRD. Comparing the binding energy (nitrogen 1s and boron 1s) of bulk BN with amine-BNNSs revealed an obvious shift, and charge transfer, confirming the occurrence of a Lewis acid-base interaction [46] (Fig. 1a). The FTIR spectra of the exfoliated and the pristine BN are shown in Fig. 1b. All BNNSs and bulk h-BN mainly present the out-of-plane bending vibration of B-N-B at 810 cm−1 (A2u mode) and the in-plane stretching vibration of BN at 1328.5 cm−1 (E1u mode) [47,48]. The lone pair of electrons in nitrogen (amino group) graft onto the electron-deficient boron atoms of h-BN, resulting in a shift in the out-of-plane bending of B-N-B and in the in-plane stretching of BN. In addition, the appearance of a new vibrational mode in C-O-C stretching, CO stretching, CN stretching, NH bending, -CH3 (methylene), and -CH2 (methyl) stretching of amine groups demonstrates the grafting of the Lewis base on BNNSs (Fig. S1). A broad peak at 3400 cm−1 corresponds to the hydroxyl groups [37] or to the stretching of NH, ascribed to absorbing IPA molecules or to preparation processes at the atmosphere. The individual chemical composition of BNNSs in shown in Table 1 ; Fig. S2 shows additional C and O elements, which are absent in bulk h-BN. Of note, the amount of N atoms was significantly higher than that of B atoms in BNNSs. This could be attributed to the existence of a high number of amine or amino groups covering the BNNSs. These characteristics agreed with the FTIR data and confirmed the successful grafting of Lewis bases (amino groups) onto BN lamellae. Fig. 2 displays the high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) and AFM images comparing the morphology of bulk and amine-functionalized BNNSs. The aggregation of pristine h-BN explicitly showed stacking of flaked h-BN with a lateral size of 5.5 μm and a few hundred nanometers in thickness (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, the as-prepared BNNSs presented irregular shapes and lateral sizes that were dramatically reduced from several micrometers to several hundred nanometers. The thickness distribution of amino-BNNSs was further confirmed by AFM, as depicted in Fig. 2 and Table 2 . Most nanosheets in the isomer amino-BNNSs (E-BNNSs and N-BNNSs) were smaller than 5 nm and had a mean thickness of 2–3 nm. The actual number of layers (Table 2) should have been less than the theoretical calculation based on the interlayer distance (0.333 nm), due to the residual solvents or functional groups on the atom plane. It was previously reported that BNNSs with a thickness of less than 1.0 nm can be considered a monolayer [47,49,50], suggesting that the amino-BNNSs we obtained contained 2–3 layers, considering the synergistic effect of the Lewis acids split between several nanosheet layers during liquid sonication. However, T-BNNSs exhibited the greatest thickness due to the difficult intercalation of the tertiary amine into the interlayer space. The crystalline and structural characteristics of the two-dimensional h-BN nanosheets were measured by Raman spectroscopy and XRD, respectively. Typically, the E2g vibration mode of h-BN is located at 1363 cm−1 on the Raman spectrum, corresponding to the graphene G band. Here, the Raman spectra of amino-BNNSs showed a progressive shift toward higher wavenumber compared with bulk h-BN and I-BNNSs (Fig. S3 and Table 3 ), indicating hardening of the E2g phonon mode, and G bands with larger full width at half maximum (FWHM) [34]. However, Cai et al. reported that the intrinsic E2g vibration mode of h-BN is not dependent on BNNSs thickness. There is no systematic study describing the Raman signatures for the number of layers [51]. Therefore, the shift we observed might be due to random strain induced by sonication and to dative bonding of Lewis acid-base interactions during grafting of amino moieties onto B atoms. Based on these results, the E-BNNSs may have been the thinnest of all nanosheets produced (Table 3). This could be due to the higher flexibility of thin nanosheets and an increased proximity to the substrate, leading to greater compressive strain. The grafting efficiency of acrylic amines in BNNSs is related to differences in relative basicity. The amino-BNNSs were produced with different amines in terms of Lewis acid-base interactions. Based on the discrepancy of crystal structure between pristine and functionalized BNNSs, as demonstrated by XRD in Fig. 3a and b, we concluded that grafting efficiency could be explained by (1) the binding strength of Lewis basicity; and (2) the steric hindrance of donor and acceptor atoms. First, pristine h-BN is a well-defined crystalline, with identical diffraction features corresponding to the (002), (100), (101), (102), and (004) planes of the h-BN skeleton [38]. Nevertheless, the crystalline main peak (002) and other diffraction peaks (2θ = 30–80°), clearly decrease or become absent after exfoliation. This can be partially attributed to a significant decline in the level of structural ordering of h-BN, or to a number of defects occurring during exfoliation by sonication. Moreover, the intensity ratio of I002/I100 elucidates the orientation of the exfoliation. Most lamella in BNNSs exfoliate along the interlayer spacing (002) while others retain crystallinity. The ratio for pristine h-BN is 233.6, which decreases with decreasing structural ordering. Fig. 3a shows the exfoliation efficiency for each amine group, indicating a reduction in intensity of 54.6%, 74.9%, 75.5%, and 21.6% for I-BNNSs, E-BNNSs, N-BNNSs, and T-BNNSs, respectively. These results suggest that the primary and secondary amines are favored as effective Lewis bases for exfoliation. Also, this further uncovers the binding strength of Lewis bases. The degree of amine grafting onto BNNSs was quantified by TGA (Fig. 4 ). A slight increase in the TGA curve could be observed at 100–150 °C, implying a large porous volume and a high specific surface area, with promising N2 adsorption properties. The grafting of amine groups onto BNNSs was consistent with previous reports of primary (EDEA, 11.7%), secondary (2,2′-(Ethylenedioxy) bis(ethylamine), 9.9%), and tertiary (TDA-1, 0.7%) [52] amines. The significantly weaker binding strength of the tertiary amine (TDA-1) is possibly due to the tri-arm alkyl chains surrounding the nitrogen center, which block Lewis interaction in the lone pair. In the case of the XRD results for PVA/T-BNNSs, the TDA-1 amine was not efficient for exfoliation and functionalization, in agreement with the AFM and TGA data. In addition, the conformation of the primary amine (EDEA) could strongly increase the chances of interaction (Fig. 3c). Hence, the primary amine may serve as the most promising Lewis base for exfoliation. Moreover, the Raman and XRD results, summarized in Fig. 3a and Table 3, indicated slight peak shifts in amino-BNNSs, caused by the alkyl chain or by trapped solvent inserted into the interlayer of the stratified structure, resulting in subsequent enlargement of the interlayer spacing distance [38]. In agreement with the TGA analysis, the tertiary amine did not interact easily with the boron atom (Lewis acid). Therefore, the interlayer distance remained unchanged, but the isomer amine showed a high-level interaction. However, the conformational analysis of the Lewis acid-base interaction suggests that BNNSs with the primary amine (E-BNNSs) had the largest interlayer spacing among all the amino groups tested. The above-mentioned results demonstrated that the reaction of BNNSs with amino groups was successful, acted as a thermal trigger, and enabled the cross-linking of networks in PVA-based hydrogels. The introduction of amino-BNNSs in PVA solution through freeze-thaw cycles to form the thermal self-healing hydrogel, lead to the formation of the second network by the interpenetration of the PVA chain into the amino-BNNSs network. At the same time, the different amounts of amino-BNNSs introduced in hydrogels showed a significant influence on the mechanical properties, as shown in Fig. S4. The greatest mechanical hardness was achieved in the dehydrated hydrogel with a BNNSs load of 0.05 wt% (Fig. S4c and d). Based on these results, we proceeded with 20 wt% PVA plus 0.05 wt% BNNSs and one F-T cycle in the subsequent analyses. The freezing of water raises polymer concentrations and this is what drives the formation of crystalline structures during F-T cycles [16]. As seen in Fig. 5a, the translucent hydrogel with BNNSs became more opaque after one F-T cycle. Typically, the sharp and shoulder diffraction peak of PVA is located at 2θ = 19.5° and 21.7° (Fig. 5c), corresponding to the [101] and [200] reflection of PVA crystals (crystallinity of bare PVA ~ 22.2%). The degree of crystallinity, as well as the crystal size of PVA hydrogel is estimated from the Scherrer equation [53,54]. Therefore, the incorporation of two-dimensional networks into PVA-based hydrogels affects its morphological structure, crystallinity, and physicochemical properties. The cross-sectional SEM images of bare PVA hydrogel (Fig. 5b) revealed a layered and channeled structure created by the ordered crystalline phase present in the highly entangled PVA. Those structures were not observed in PVA/BNNSs hydrogels. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4 , the BNNSs network in the PVA-based hydrogel directly influenced its physical properties. The results demonstrated that BNNSs exhibited a disordered crystalline phase (Fig. 5b), in agreement with previous reports [55,56]. We observed that the PVA/I-BNNSs hybrid not only had the lowest degree of crystallinity (Table 4) but it also presented a clear platelet structure (Fig. 5b), indicating a separation between organic and inorganic materials. The reason for that was the lack of surfactants between organic and inorganic components and the region occupied by I-BNNSs which reduced the chances of the surrounding PVA polymer arranging in a highly ordered crystal structure. Though the aggregation phenomenon was observed in the PVA/T-BNNSs hydrogel, the compatibility of the PVA matrix varies in T-BNNSs and I-BNNSs due to the presence of different amine groups. Overall, our results indicated a slight decrease in the magnitude of PVA crystallinity (Table 4) along with characteristic peak shifts in BNNSs hydrogels in comparison with the bare PVA hydrogel (Fig. 5c). Though lamellar BNNSs may reduce the formation of PVA crystallites (called the first network), compatibility could be increased by amino-BNNSs penetrating into the PVA network to form the second double-network. Consequently, except for PVA/I-BNNSs hydrogels, the amino groups favor compatibility between PVA polymer chains and BNNSs by interpenetrating the structure (Fig. 5c). As a result, the diffraction peak of E-BNNSs shifts to the lowest degree, while the crystallinity is highest among exfoliated BNNSs, suggesting that the interpenetration of E-BNNSs slightly increases interplanar spacing of PVA gels [57] and renders optimal compatibility. This is attributed to the conformation of E-BNNSs, as well as the presence of oxygen and one free amine in the chain, which favors a second hydrogen bond with the PVA network (Fig. 3). In addition to the XRD and SEM results, changes in the FTIR spectrum also confirmed the degree of interaction between the PVA network and BNNSs, as shown in Fig. 5d. The typical absorption bands of PVA at 3416 cm−1 and 1098 cm−1 are assigned to broad OH stretching [58] and CO stretching [59] vibrations, respectively. However, there were new peaks of C-O-C stretching at 1249 cm−1, CN stretching at 1341 cm−1, alkane CH stretching at 2922 cm−1 and 2854 cm−1, and in-plane BN stretching at 1380 cm−1 in the hybrid hydrogel, indicating successful incorporation of the amino-BNNSs into the PVA matrix. Intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonding is considered to reflect the formation of a second interconnection and the effect of the first PVA-based network. The existence of a second interaction leads to an obvious shift in the band assigned to OH and CO stretching vibrations. According to the literature [55,60–62], the vibrational bands at 1090–1150 cm−1 are recognized as the crystallization-sensitive bands of PVA, reflecting CO stretching. Hence, the CO stretching vibrations should be assigned to hydrogen bonding. All three PVA/amino-BNNSs hydrogels, had less intense crystalline-sensitive bands (~1098 cm−1) due to a decrease in intramolecular hydrogen bonding as intermolecular hydrogen bonds increased (shifted to higher wavenumber of ~1143 cm−1). Conversely, the FTIR spectra of PVA/I-BNNSs were similar to that of bare PVA. This is probably because PVA-PVA are stronger than PVA-I-BNNSs interactions, as Xu et al. [63] and Supa'at [64] demonstrated. We also observed a shift in the peak of hydroxyl absorption band upon introduction of BNNSs in the hydrogel. This indicated that a new hydrogen bond formed within the PVA matrix (-OH) and the BNNSs network (-NH). Based on these results, it appears that the second cross-linking alters the first PVA network (crystallinity, tridimensional structure, and molecular entanglements) in a manner dependent on the amino species attached to the BNNSs. Fig. 6 and Table 6 show the viscoelastic and mechanical characteristics of dehydrated and as-prepared hydrogels. It is difficult to measure the molecular force between as-prepared BNNSs and PVA polymers due to the reflection caused by water-polymer interactions in the as-prepared hydrogel (water is present). Therefore, we sought to characterize the modified BNNSs and the PVA to understand if the incorporation of alkylamines into BNNSs (amine-BNNSs) after dehydration could influence hydrogel performance and conformation. During dehydration, we observed a rearrangement in the polymer network that resulted in varying degrees of molecular entanglement and compatibility, further improving the mechanical properties of amine-BNNSs (Fig. 6). The storage modulus (G´) was higher than the loss modulus (G´´), indicating a stiff and predominant gel nature. Despite the disruption of PVA crystallinity by the addition of BNNSs, the hydrogel formation continued. Both modulus exhibited a frequency-dependent behavior (Fig. 6a), while the storage modulus increased by 58%, 95%, 81%, and 79% in I-BNNSs, E-BNNSs, N-BNNSs, and T-BNNSs incorporated at 20 °C, respectively, when compared with bare PVA (Fig. 6b). As expected, both the tensile strength (Table 5 ) and the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) data (Table 6 ) suggest that the hydrogel mechanical properties were enhanced when amine-BNNSs were incorporated into PVA, compared with neat and unmodified PVA. These behaviors reveal an important modification in hydrogel mechanical properties that could result from the following reasons: (1) the fact that BNNSs possess excellent mechanical abilities, while holding promise for enhancing composite performance [39,65]; (2) the crystallinity of PVA influencing the mechanical properties; though the number of hydrogen bonds within PVA polymer chains reduced after the incorporation of BNNSs (Table 4), the amount of new hydrogen bonds between amino-BNNSs and PVA increased; as a result, the mechanical properties of PVA/BNNSs hydrogels were 2- to 3-fold higher than neat PVA (Table 6), indicating increased hardness; (3) interfacial compatibility is a crucial factor for forming a second network; as the functional groups on amino-BNNSs had a relatively strong network entanglement with PVA chains, they could promote a second cross-linking (hydrogen bonding). Among all hydrogels, the strong interconnected network of PVA/E-BNNSs presented the highest storage modulus, consistent with the XRD and SEM results. In contrast, such interconnection was not favored in the hydrogel containing unmodified BNNSs (I-BNNSs). Moreover, we clearly observed the lamellar structure and phase separation between organic/inorganic materials (Fig. 5). The unique interpenetrating structure and hydrogen bonding play a critical role in conferring tough hydrogels with outstanding properties relative to single-network hydrogels. Herein, we observed that the second network provided an additional platform to dissipate energy while it helped bear force, like the first PVA network during deformation [30], resulting in improved ductility and strength. The Tg is an important thermal parameter. In the neat PVA hydrogel the Tg was low (26–27 °C), whether F-T cycles were used or not, whereas the addition of BNNSs and its cross-linking with PVA slightly increased Tg by 4–5 °C (up to 30–32 °C) (Fig. 6c). Such increase indicates a strong confinement effect over mobility of the interpenetrating network and confirms that hydrogen bonding hinders the segmental arrangement of polymer chains and their free movement, suggesting good interfacial interactions between PVA molecules and BNNSs [41,59,66–68]. DN gels and IPN structures possess a high degree of cross-linking, which hold a large amount of water [69,70]. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, the hydrogel with the second network entrapped a higher amount of water than the physically cross-linked single-network PVA hydrogel (70%). The rapid thawing rate of thermally conductive BNNSs caused a small amount of moisture to be released. Prior reports indicate that amine compounds in hydrogels are hygroscopic [71] while the shift in the C-OH band at 1090 cm−1 is always related with the moisture content of the PVA sample, just as shown in Fig. 5. As anticipated, an increase in water retention was expected for all hydrogels. Despite being kept in water at 37 °C for one week (Fig. S5), PVA/BNNSs hydrogels were essentially water-insoluble and rehydration led to significant swelling of up to 140%. To evaluate the temperature response, we conducted a swelling test at a temperature range of 20–50 °C. Fig. 7b shows how swelling progressively increased with increasing temperature, consistent with prior studies by Li et al. [72] and Urushizaki et al. [73]. This is attributed to the thermal energy obtained by rehydrated gels when polymer chains undergo high temperatures, which destroys the crystal network and dissociates hydrogen bonds. Also, water retention is relatively reduced after heating at 37 °C for 1 h due to the excellent thermal conductivity of BNNSs, as previously reported [29,65]. As a result, the water content and swelling behavior are influenced by the presence of BNNSs in the hybrid hydrogel. As evidenced in Fig. 7b, the highest degree of swelling was observed in PVA/E-BNNSs hydrogels at high temperatures, with an increase in the swelling ratio of 12% at 50 °C, compared with the bare PVA hydrogel. In addition, PVA/E-BNNSs hydrogels showed the highest water loss after heating at 37 °C for 1 h (Fig. 7a; reduction of 16.2%). In this type of hydrogels, the greater number of amino groups induced higher thermal conductivity and compact interfacial entanglement between E-BNNSs and the PVA matrix. Hence, E-BNNSs can serve as a promising thermal network to promote thermal response in hydrogels. As mentioned, hydrogels are capable of obtaining thermal energy and regulating the polymer network (hydrogen bonding or water content) through heating, contributing to thermal-responsive self-healing. We further evaluated the self-healing properties of PVA/BNNSs hydrogels by performing tensile tests with and without an external stimulus (heating at 25 °C or at 37 °C for 1 h). The physically cross-linked single-network PVA hydrogel exhibited a self-healing efficiency of about 37% after 1 h of healing at 25 °C. This observation indicated the repair of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups abounding in PVA, in agreement with prior reports [9,17]. Compared to neat PVA hydrogels with no heating, PVA/BNNSs hydrogels displayed a lower self-healing efficiency. This was caused by the incorporation of the lamellar network of BNNSs into the cross-linked PVA hydrogel. Not only this reduces the density of free hydroxyl groups, but it also lowers the mobility of PVA chains, substantially impairing the formation of hydrogen bonds at the fracture surface. Table 5 provides a summary of the literature regarding PVA composite self-healable hydrogels, and indicates that in these type of gels healing takes longer to occur at 25 °C (12–48 h). Thus, external thermal stimuli could deliver the primitive driving force for self-healing within the polymer chain. Table 6 and Fig. 7d highlight the self-healing capacity of the hydrogels created without any external stimuli at 25 °C and with heating at 37 °C. The self-healing ability was remarkably increased when an external thermal stimuli (heating at 37 °C) was included in the repair process, increasing recovery efficiencies by 4%, 9%, 68%, 6%, and 24% in neat PVA, PVA/I-BNNSs, PVA/E-BNNSs, PVA/N-BNNSs, and PVA/T-BNNSs, respectively, after 1 h. Hybrid hydrogels had a better healing capacity than single-network cross-linked hydrogels exposed to heating at 37 °C, suggesting that BNNSs mediated and increased the thermal response. The unique structure of hybrids favors the conduction of thermal energy from BNNSs toward the PVA cross-linked network. From all hydrogels, the PVA/E-BNNSs presented the best thermal-healing capacity (up to 88%) under the heating stimulus. Above the Tg point the polymer exhibited a higher heat capacity which increased chain movement and free volume (behaved like a viscous liquid). In addition, exposure to 37 °C yielded a decrease in moisture during healing (Fig. 7a). These effects lead to elevated polymer chain diffusion (Fig. 7b) and a rapid formation of new hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5d) at the fracture surface."
8,Conclusion,"In this study we found that blending amino-functionalized BNNSs with PVA polymers creates more robust and useful hydrogels. First, we showed that BNNSs were successfully exfoliated using liquid sonication and grafted with various amino groups by means of Lewis acid-base interactions. We were then able to obtain hydrogels composed of cross-linked PVA interpenetrated by an amino-BNNSs network by applied one freeze-thaw cycle. Interestingly, the binding strength and steric hindrance of the Lewis base attached to BNNSs had a significant influence on the self-healing efficiency, whether or not an external thermal stimulus was used, as well as on the hydrogel's mechanical properties. Despite the disruption of PVA crystallinity by the newly introduced BNNSs, its presence provides improved stability and physicochemical properties. As a result, the hydrogel Tg was increased due to slowing of polymer mobility imposed by the dual network, which suggests a compatibility between polymer and inorganic interfacial interactions. Furthermore, our structural data confirm greater thermal-healing and mechanical properties compared with pure single-network PVA hydrogels. The improvement in performance is attributed to the gain in thermal energy triggered by BNNSs, which activates the mobility of polymer chains to reconstruct hydrogen bonds at the fracture point. The second network provides an additional platform to dissipate energy, while it helps bearing force much like the first PVA network during deformation. Finally, were demonstrated that PVA/E-BNNSs hydrogels provide the best thermal response and thermo-healing capacity when exposed to 37 °C, supporting its composition and structure as a promising system to serve a wide range of applications. The hydrogels created here have highly desirable properties including physical stability, stretchability, robustness and self-healing ability that confer them resistance to mechanical damage and durability. This could reduce costs with repair and extend service life for applications such as membrane filtration and wearable technology."
