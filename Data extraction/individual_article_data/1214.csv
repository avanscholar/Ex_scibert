0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of human society, the increasing consumption of fossil resources and the serious waste of carbon resources have become the focus of social attention [1–3]. Searching for alternative renewable resources and improving the utilization of carbon resources is the goal of human society [4–7]. The conversion of biomass and its derivatives into liquid fuels and other high-value chemicals has been considered as an alternative strategy to fossil fuels and has attracted widespread attention of human society in recent decades [7]. Biomass is a kind of renewable non-fossil energy, which is considered as an ideal substitute for traditional fossil resources because it is environmental protection and abundant reserves. Furfural(FF) is a potential value-added compound platform obtained by hydrolysis of biomass acid [8–10]. Among many conversion routes, the reduction of FF is a very interesting process which can produce many high value-added compounds such as cyclopentanone, 2-methylfuran, furfuryl alcohol(FA), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [1,11–13]. In particular, FA is one of the most important precursors of synthetic lubricants, liquid fuels, plastics, resins, fine chemicals and other products [14]. In recent decades, the industrial production of FA is the selective hydrogenation of FF in the gas or liquid phases by copper based catalysts, among which Cu-Cr catalyst is the most widely used [15,16]. However, the toxicity of Cr in Cu-Cr catalyst is very serious, which causes environmental pollution. It is for this reason that many non-chromium catalysts have been developed for the gas-phase or liquid-phase hydrogenation of FF. Usually, the FA is produced by selective hydrogenation of FF in gas or liquid phase using supported metal as catalyst in hydrogen environment (i.e., Pt, Rh, Co, Cu,) [17–21]. The large-scale liquid-phase hydrogenation of FF is limited due to the strict operation requirements of the equipment under high hydrogen pressure. To this end, a large number of catalysts have been studied to attempt selective hydrogenation of FF through hydrogen transfer [22–25]. Marchi et al. reported that FF was hydrogenated on Cu-Mg-Al using isopropanol as hydrogen source [22]. Lee et al. discovered that aluminium-carbon composites were used for FF hydrogenation [24]. Besides, several different lewis acid zeolites(Sn/Zr-beta) have been reported to be used for catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA [26–29]. The complex preparation process of Lewis acid zeolite increases the degree of experimental operation. The zirconium-based catalysts are ideal for transfer hydrogenation of biomass with secondary alcohols as hydrogen sources and solvents. Tannic acid exists in bark and tea, which is a natural plant polyphenol structure derived from. It is precisely because this polyphenol structure is often used as mordant, food additive and the synthesis of some drugs. In this paper, we synthesized zirconium tannate(Zr-TA) from tannic acid(TA) and zirconium tetrachloride(ZrCl4) for CTH of FF to FA. So far as we know, the Zr-TA has not been reported for the hydrogenation of FF. In addition, the various parameters were explored in the reaction and possible reaction mechanisms were proposed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials N,N-dimethylformamide(DMF), ethanol, anhydrous glacial acetic acid were purchased from China Pharmaceutical Reagents Co., Ltd. Tannic acid(TA), pyrogallol(PA),zirconium tetrachloride(ZrCl4), isopropanol(ISP), furfural(FF,99 %), furfuryl alcohol(FA,98 %), pyridine, paphthalene, boric acid were purchased and Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. All of the above reagents were not treated before use."
3,Synthesis of Zr-Ta and Zr-PA,"2.2 Synthesis of Zr-Ta and Zr-PA 0.21 g tannic acid(Ta) and 0.47 g zirconium tetrachloride(ZrCl4) were dissolved in 20 mL DMF solution and treated with ultrasound for 10 min, respectively. First, the ultrasound-treated ZrCl4 solution was poured into a 100 mL PTFE reactor, and then tannic acid solution was added drop by drop. After the above solution was evenly mixed, 3 mL glacial acetic acid was added drop by drop. The reactor was then moved to 140 °C for 16 h. After natural cooling of the reactor to room temperature, the catalysts was washed three times with DMF and anhydrous ethanol respectively, and then dried for 12 h in a vacuum at 100 °C. The synthesis method of Zr-PA was similar to the above steps, but the quality of pyrogallol and ZrCl4 were 0.13 g and 0.47 g, respectively."
4,Hydrogenation reaction,"2.3 Hydrogenation reaction Typical experimental processes, FF (1 mmol), ISP (5 mL) and catalyst (0.2 g) were placed in a 20 mL PTFE reactor. The reactor was moved to an oil bath at a known temperature and reacts at the desired time. After the reaction, the catalyst and liquid were separated by centrifugal separation, and the upper transparent liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography(GC). The composition of the product was further analyzed by GC–MS. The formulas for calculating the conversion of FF and the yield of FA are as follows: (1) FF conversion mol % = 1 − moles of FF initial moles of FF × 100 (2) Y i e l d o f F A m o l % = m o l e s o f F A i n i t i a l m o l e s o f F F × 100"
5,Recyclability and leachability,"2.4 Recyclability and leachability In order to explore the recyclability of catalysts, the used catalysts were washed three times with DMF and absolute ethanol after the experiment was finished, and dried in a vacuum drying box at 100 °C for 12 h for the next use. The catalyst was removed by centrifugation after 40 min of reaction, and the solution without catalyst continued to react under the same conditions until the end of the experiment; the leachability of the catalyst was studied by analyzing the yield of FA before and after the presence or absence of catalyst by gas chromatography."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The type of powder X-ray diffractometer is D2 PHASER, the X-ray tube is ceramic, the target of Cu, the power of the tube is 2.2 kW with the scanning range is 5−80°. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR) of KBr solid tablets is Nicolet iS50 FT-IR with wavelength ranging from 400 to 4000 cm−1. The surface morphology of the catalyst was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of S-4800 type. The structure and crystal structure of the catalyst were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the operating voltage of 200kv and JEM-2100 plus. The full-bore analysis of the catalyst was carried out by using the automatic surface and porosity analyzer BET (Mike ASAP2460). Determination of surface elements of catalysts by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Axis supra).The strength of acidity and alkalinity of the catalyst was determined by TPD with temperature programmed chemisorbent of AutoChem1 II 2920. Operation process, The sample was placed in a quartz reactor for pretreatment, and the temperature was raised from room temperature at 10 °C/min to 150 °C with the introduction of He (50cm3/min), and the temperature was treated for two hours to remove the organic solvent absorbed in the catalyst. Then temperature was lowered to 60 °C, at which time NH3 or CO2 were introduced under He (10 cm3/min) conditions until the acidic and basic sites were saturated. The adsorbed NH3 or CO2 was removed through He (50 cm3/min). When the baseline is stable, the temperature rises from 60 °C to 700 °C at 10 °C/min."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the catalyst The catalyst was analyzed by different characterization techniques. The surface morphology and internal structure of the catalyst were analyzed by SEM and TEM. The SEM and TEM of Zr-TA were shown in Fig. 1 a and b. It could be observed that the catalyst was irregular in shape and has no fixed morphology. The crystal orientation of the catalyst was studied by powder XRD (Fig. 1c). It could be observed that the catalyst had no obvious crystal diffraction peak indicating that it was an amorphous substance consistent with the conclusions of the SEM. The adsorption-desorption isotherm showed that the adsorption-desorption isotherm was type IV in the whole range of relative pressure (Fig. 1d). When p/p0 is less than 0.4, the adsorption of N2 on the pore surface of catalyst is mainly a single molecule layer, and the adsorption of p/p0 and N2 is linear. When p/p0 reaches 0.4, the curve enters the sudden jump stage, which is mainly caused by the capillary coagulation phenomenon generated by N2 molecules in the mesoporous, and the adsorption amount of N2 also increases sharply, which can well explain the presence of mesoporous structure in the catalyst. Its specific area, pore size and pore volume were 114.2 m²/g, 12.4 nm and 0.28 cm³/g, respectively. In general, larger specific area and pore size were helpful to increase the adsorptive capacity of the catalyst, make better contact with the substrate and improve the catalytic performance.The infrared spectra of Zr-TA and TA were shown in Fig. 2 . The infrared spectrum of Zr-TA was wider than that of TA because Zr-TA was an amorphous substance [30]. The shift of peaks to high wavenumbers for FT-IR spectra of Zr-TA compared with pure tannin also supports the formation of metallic chelates [31]. Among them, the 3411 cm−1 and 3432 cm−1 were the contractive vibration of OH, respectively. The stretching vibration characteristic peaks of CC in aromatic rings were 1704 cm−1、1343 cm−1 and 1197 cm−1. The stretching vibration peaks of CO were 1017 cm−1and 1045 cm−1. The Zr-O bond appeared at 1045 cm−1 and 575 cm−1. Besides, the two adjacent phenolic hydroxyl groups in tannic acid can form stable chelates with metal ions in the form of oxygen negative ions. Although the third phenolic hydroxyl group in pyrogallol structure does not participate in the complexation, it can promote the dissociation of the other two phenolic hydroxyl groups, thus promoting the formation and stability of the complexes. The Zr-TA retained the characteristic peak of TA and weakens the peak strength, which indicates that Zr4+ successfully coordinates with tannic acid."
9,The effect of catalyst types,"3.2 The effect of catalyst types The catalytic performance of different kinds of catalysts for the hydrogenation of FF to FA was shown in Table 1 . Isopropanol was used as a hydrogen source and solvent for the reaction. When Zr-TA catalyst was used in this reaction, it was obvious that the conversion of FF and the yield of FA were 100 % and 98.2 % at 120 °C for 80 min respectively (Table 1 entry 2). On the contrary, metals such as Al-TA、Sn-TA and Ni-TA had only a small yield for this reaction (Table 1 entry 4–6). Through the experimental data of ZrCl4, ZrO2, Ni-TA and Zr-TA, it can be seen that the activity of Zr complex for FF catalytic transfer hydrogenation to FA is significantly better than that of Ni complex. In addition, through the analysis of the physical properties of Ni-TA, the difference between Ni-TA and Zr-TA is not obvious (Table 4). Therefore, the main reason for the difference of Ni-TA and Zr-TA activity is that Ni-TA lacks acid sites or the number of acid sites is small.The above results indicate that Zr was the active site for FF hydrogenation to produce FA, and it would hardly occur without Zr reaction. However, Zr-PA had a good catalytic performance for FF to FA conversion under the same conditions with 98.3 % conversion of FF and 95.6 % yield of FA (Table 1 entry 3). Meanwhile, The catalytic effects of different catalysts on CTH from FF to FA were compared under specific reaction conditions as shown in Table S1. Under the reaction conditions of isopropanol as hydrogen source and solvent, comparing the catalytic activity of different zirconium-based catalysts for the CTH of FF to FA, it can be found that although the amount of furfural catalyzed by Zr-TA is relatively small, the reaction temperature time has a relative advantage, thereby improving comparability (Table S1 entry 1–5). In addition, it can be concluded that Zr-TA has a lower reaction temperature and a relatively shorter time compared with γ-Fe2O3@HAP, which shows that it has better catalyst activity for the reaction of FF catalytic transfer hydrogenation to FA (Table S1 entry 7). In summary, both Zr-TA and Zr-PA have high catalytic properties for the conversion of FF to FA under the same conditions (Table 1 entry 2–3)."
10,The effect of catalyst dosages,"3.3 The effect of catalyst dosages The amount of catalyst for the hydrogenation of FF to FA was studied as shown in Fig. 3 . The conversion of FF and the yield of FA increase with the amount of catalyst from 0.05 g to 0.2 g. When the amount of catalyst is small, the conversion of FF and the yield of FA do not reach the optimal effect due to the low content of active sites. From another perspective, the amount of catalyst is not enough to catalyze the second order reaction, and the amount of FA is not consumed by the second order reaction, so it has a high selectivity. So the catalyst amount reached the optimal state at 0.2 g with the 100 % conversion of FF and 98.2 % yield of FA. However, when the amount of catalyst continued to increase from 0.2 g to 0.25 g, the selectivity of FA decreased due to the consumption of primary reaction by secondary reaction. The consumption of the first-order reaction in the second-order reaction refers specifically to the etherification of FA molecules to 2,2′-difuryl ether, which results in the reduction of the selectivity of FA. Therefore, the 0.2 g of was the optimal catalytic dose for the hydrogenation of FF to FA."
11,Exploration of time and temperature,"3.4 Exploration of time and temperature The effect of reaction temperature and time over CTH of FF to FA was shown in Fig. 4 . It could be seen from the figure that the reaction temperature and time have a significant effect on the hydrogenation of FF to FA. Both the conversion of FF and the yield of FA increased significantly when the temperature increased from 110 °C to 120 °C. This indicates that the reaction of FF hydrogenation to FA was promoted by the increase of temperature. However, the conversion of FF increased slowly and the reduction of selectivity of FA when the temperature increased from 120 °C to 140 °C. The side reactions occur gradually with the increase of temperature, which results in the decrease of selectivity of FA. The effect of reaction time on the hydrogenation of FF to FA was similar to that of temperature. Both the conversion of FF and the yield of FA increased when the reaction time increased from 20 min to 60 min. The conversion of FF remained almost unchanged and the yield of FA continued to increase when the reaction time increased from 60 min to 80 min. Secondary reaction appeared gradually with the prolongation of reaction time, which led to the decrease of FA yield after 80 min. All in all, The CTH of FF to FA achieved the best effect with 100 % conversion of FF and 98.2 % yield of FA at 120 °C for 80 min. In addition, the reproducibility of the data was investigated in 10 parallel experiments under the optimal catalytic environment (Table 2 ). The data showed that the reproducibility of the yield of FA above 95 % was 90 %, and the reproducibility of the yield of FA above 90 % was 100 % in the 10 parallel experiments."
12,Effect of solvents,"3.5 Effect of solvents Alcohols were often used as hydrogen donors and solvents for CTH reactions. Their low cost, reproducible properties, as well as their unique ability to participate in internal and intermolecular hydride transfer make alcohols an attractive option for CTH reactions. The effect of the type of alcohol on catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA were shown in Table 3 . The data showed that the effect of secondary butanol was more significant than that of n-butanol in the CTH of FF to FA (Table 3 entry4−5). The above results were attributed to the fact that the stabilization of two alkyl groups (secondary carbon cations) was stronger than that of a single alkyl group in primary carbon in the process of hydride transfer. Because tert-butanol lacks a-H, it could not be used as a hydrogen donor (Table 3 entry7). In conclusion, the isopropanol was the best solvent and hydrogen donor for FF hydrogenation to FA with 100 % conversion of FF and 98.2 % yield of FA."
13,Heterogeneity and recyclability,"3.6 Heterogeneity and recyclability Heterogeneity and reusability of catalysts are important indexes to evaluate the performance of catalysts. Here, we explored the heterogeneity of the catalyst through leaching experiments. The heterogeneity of the catalyst could be better explored by two sets of comparative experiments (Fig. 5 a). One group took samples every 10 min from the reaction time of 20 min–100 min. In the other group, the solid catalyst was removed after the reaction for 50 min and the reaction liquid of removed the catalyst continued to finish the reaction under the same conditions. The data showed that the yield of FA did not increase with time after the solid catalyst was removed. From another point of view, it could also be proved that there was no active site in the reaction liquid of removed catalyst and the catalyst had excellent heterogeneity. Recycling experiments were carried out to investigate the reusability of Zr-TA (Fig. 5b). In each cycle experiment, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed with fresh DMF and ethanol for next use. It could be found that Zr-TA of used eight times had little change in the conversion of FF and the yield of FA. Simultaneously, the used Zr-TA was analyzed by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM (Fig. S1) and XPS (Table S2). The characterization results demonstrate that there was little change in the structure of the used catalyst. In conclusion, the Zr-TA had good heterogeneity and recyclability."
14,Kinetic analysis,"3.7 Kinetic analysis In order to further explore the catalytic performance of catalysts for CTH of FF to FA, we carried out kinetic analysis at different temperatures (373 K,383Kand 393 K). The reaction kinetics was not affected by the concentration of isopropanol due to the excess of isopropanol in the whole catalytic process. Therefore, the CTH of FF to FA could be assumed to be a first-order reaction. We drawed the relationship between ln(Ct/C0) and time (Fig. 6 a and c), in which C0 is the initial concentration of FF and Ct represents the concentration of FF at certain reaction time point. As shown in Fig. 6, the transfer hydrogenation of FF to FA had first-order kinetics at three different temperatures (373 K, 383 K and 393 K) with reaction rate constants of 0.04, 0.05 and 0.07, respectively. According to the relation between ln(-k) and the reciprocal of time, the activation energies were calculated to be 26.6 kJ/mol and 23.7 kJ/mol over Zr-TA and Zr-PA for CTH of FF to FA, respectively. The activation energies of Zr-TA and Zr-PA for catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA had little difference, which was consistent with the experimental data. In addition, Wang et al. reported that the activation energy (Ea) was 47.69 kJ/mol over the γ-Fe2O3@HAP catalyst for the CTH of furfural into furfuryl alcohol with iso-propranol as the hydrogen donor [25]. In addition, Li et al. reported that the activation energy of ZrPN was 70.5 kJ/mol. It can be clearly seen from the comparison that Zr-TA and Zr-PA have less activation energy for FA preparation by catalytic transfer hydrogenation of FF, which is more conducive to the reaction."
15,Analysis of highly active catalysts,"3.8 Analysis of highly active catalysts According to the previous experimental data, it can be found that Zr-TA had higher catalytic activity than ZrO2 for the catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA. The physical properties of Zr-TA, Zr-PA and ZrO2 were shown in Table 4. The difference in catalytic activity may be due to the high specific surface area, pore size and the number of acid-base sites of Zr-TA compared with ZrO2. Although the small pores in ZrO2 have some limitations on the reaction of FF catalytic transfer hydrogenation to FA, the main limiting factor is that ZrO2 contains less acid base sites. According to relevant literature, metal cations and oxygen anions provide acid sites and basic sites in the complexes, respectively. In general, metal-ions in metal-ligand coordination polymers exhibit Lewis acidity. Subsequently, the surface chemical state and element composition of Zr-TA and ZrO2 were analyzed by XPS in order to detect the Lewis acidity caused by Zr element (Fig. 7 a and b). The high resolution XPS spectra of Zr-TA and Zr-PA were shown in Fig. S4. The binding energies of Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 in Zr-TA at 182.7 and 185.1 eV were higher than in ZrO2. This indicates that the higher positive charge of the Zr atom in Zr-TA results in a stronger Lewis acidity [32,33]. The lewis acid sites bind to electron-rich oxygen and hydrogen donors in hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups in receptors, respectively, while adjacent bases attract protons in hydroxyl groups [34]. Therefore, the acidic site content of the catalyst was analyzed by NH3-TPD (Fig. 7c). It was obvious from the figure that the peak area of Zr-TA was much larger than that of ZrO2, indicating that the content of acidic sites of Zr-TA was more than that of ZrO2, which was consistent with the analysis results of XPS. The high acidic site content of the catalyst can not only activate the substrate, but also accelerate the reaction rate. On the contrary, the basic sites can extract hydrogen from the hydroxyl group to form the alcohol oxygen group of the lewis acid sites to facilitate the transfer of hydrides. Therefore, the CO2-TPD was used to analyze the content of basic sites in the catalysts (Fig. 7d). It is observed that Zr-TA has more basic sites than ZrO2, which leads to a higher catalytic activity for CTH of FF to FA than ZrO2. The basic sites are supplied by oxygen anions in the phenolic hydroxyl group coordinated with Zr4+. Similarly, the similar structure of Zr-PA and Zr-TA results in high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of FF to FA with 98.3 % conversion of FF and 95.6 % yield of FA at 120 °C for 80 min. The Zr-PA was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, BET (Table 4), XPS and NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD (Figs. S3, 7 c and d). It could be found that Zr-TA and Zr-PA have similar structures and acid-base sites by the above different characterization. In conclusion, the acid-base sites in the catalysts are crucial for the catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA. Although acidic or basic sites in catalysts play a dominant role in the transfer hydrogenation of FF to FA, complete acid-base pairs are needed to complete the whole catalytic cycle. In addition, the specific surface area and pore size of Zr-TA were obviously better than that of ZrO2. In short, the Zr-TA had high catalytic activity for the CTH of FF to FA because of its large number of acid-base sites and superior physical properties."
16,Poisoning experiment and reaction mechanism,"3.9 Poisoning experiment and reaction mechanism According to the above analysis, the acid-base site of the catalyst is crucial to the CTH reaction of FF. In the following experiments, we designed poisoning experiments by introducing additional additives to further understand the role of active sites in the CTH reaction of FF. In general, pyridine and boric acid have good passivation ability for acidic sites and basic sites, respectively. It could be seen from Table 5 that pyridine had little effect on the conversion of FF and the yield of FA, but the same amount of boric acid had a very significant effect on the conversion of FF and the yield of FA. The lower yield to FA after boric acid poisoning could be ascribed to the imbalance acid-base couple sites, and 2,2′-difurfuryl ether and 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one were formed through acid sites-catalyzed etherification and aldol condensation reactions, respectively.In conclusion, the Zr-TA catalyst was more sensitive to reaction of boric acid, which indicates that the basic site of catalyst had more significant effect on the CTH reaction of FF. Based on the above characterization results and previous reports [35–41], the possible reaction mechanism of catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA was proposed (Scheme 1 ). According to characterization analysis and previous reports, acidic and basic sites were critical for catalytic hydrogenation of FF [32,41,42]. In Zr-based catalysts, acidic sites and basic sites were provided in the medium Zr4+ and O2−sites, respectively [43,44]. Firstly, isopropanol was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to form corresponding alcohol-oxygen group. The carbonyl groups in the substrate molecules were adsorbed on the adjacent sites of the catalyst to form a six-membered intermediate(A). Subsequently, the substrate molecule furfural and the alcohol oxygen group carried out hydrogen transfer in a synergistic manner(B). Finally, the intermediate product B releases acetone and FA, and the catalyst was recycled. It was noteworthy that every process of catalytic hydrogenation of FF was reversible [45]."
17,Conclusion,"In summary, We have successfully synthesized a novel Zr-TA catalyst for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol with isopropanol as hydrogen source and solvent. The Zr-TA has abundant acid-base sites and excellent physical properties, which can not only accelerate the reaction rate, but also improve the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol. In addition, the Zr-TA was reused for eight times without significant activity loss and the possible reaction mechanism was proposed. We believe that the catalyst has a better application prospect in the field of catalysis."
