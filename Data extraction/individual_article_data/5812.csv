0,Introduction,"Over-exploitation of fossil fuels and the serious environmental issues related to their excessive usage have driven the interest from the government to research community in searching for clean and renewable alternative fuels [1–3]. Recently, considerable attention is being paid to the use of biomass for sustainable production of fuels/chemicals because of its abundance, renewability and environmentally friendly nature [4–6]. Different thermochemical technologies including gasification, pyrolysis and liquefaction have been utilized to convert biomass to biochar, bio-oil and valuable chemicals [7–10]. Generally, liquefaction is one of the promising methods for biomass treatment as it has a great capability to deal with high-moisture biomass without the preliminary drying process [11,12]. Up to now, different types of biomasses have been investigated for the production of bio-oils through liquefaction treatment, including agricultural and forest residue [13,14], algal biomass [15–17], food processing waste [18], municipal waste [19], etc. Studies on liquefaction of one type of biomass, nevertheless, have some limitations in terms of practical application. On the one hand, biomass has a low energy intensity and varies in composition according to different seasons, and thus it is hard to acquire an adequate amount of single kind of biomass in a specific area to realize the entire production available economically [20]. On top of that, the bio-oil derived from liquefaction of certain types of biomass contains more oxygen, nitrogen and other undesirable elements that reduce the quality of bio-oil. Co-liquefaction of mixed biomass can serve as a method to mitigate these problems, which can also decrease substantially the logistics costs related to the collection and transportation of biomass [21]. Additionally, co-liquefaction of biomass mixture has a great potential to enhance the bio-oil yield and tailor the physicochemical properties of the formed bio-oil through altering the composition of feedstock mixture [22]. Over the past decades, a number of research studies focused on the bio-oil derived from co-liquefaction of diverse combinations of biomass, which include microalgae with lignocellulosic biomass, macroalgae with microalgae, swine manure with algae and sewage sludge with lignocellulose [23–27]. Some investigations proposed that co-liquefaction could enhance the generation of bio-oil and control the distribution of liquified products. Besides, due to the interaction of biomass constituents, a synergistic effect from biomass mixture can be achieved, significantly modifying the chemical properties of bio-oil [28–30]. However, the report concerning the interaction of the intermediates during the co-liquefaction of biomass mixture is scattered. Additionally, a review focused on the effect of reaction conditions such as solvent type, catalyst type and reaction temperature and time on co-liquefaction behavior is not available. This valuable knowledge is helpful to understand the interaction of biomass mixture during the co-liquefaction process, which are required to be summarized systematically. Thus, in this study, the effort is made to revisit the existing research work on co-liquefaction of mixed biomass feedstocks including lignocellulose, organic solid waste and algae. The work also emphasizes the progress in understanding the co-liquefaction influence on the characteristics of the bio-oil produced. The influences of the key process parameters including solvent types, catalyst types, reaction temperature, time and mixing ratios are also elucidated comprehensively. Besides, the co-liquefaction effect on the overall reaction network of bio-oils is discussed. Finally, the underlying problems on the co-liquefaction technology are analyzed."
1,Classification of biomass,"The different types of biomasses have been considered as potential feedstocks for the formation of bio-oil. Based on the varied compositions and structural characteristics, the typical biomass can be classified into three groups including lignocellulose, organic solid waste and algae [31]. Lignocellulose, as an abundant biomass source, comes from agricultural and forest residues, which is considered as a promising candidate for bio-oil production due to its large quantities and low price [32–34]. Some examples of the liquefaction of lignocellulose have been investigated in past years as the liquefaction feedstocks are rice straw [35], bagasse [36], beech wood [37], switchgrass [38] and bamboo shoot shell [39]. Lignocellulose mainly consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and the dominant elemental compositions are carbon, oxygen and hydrogen with a small amount of heteroatoms such as nitrogen and sulfur [40–42]. The complicated and compact structure of lignocellulose results in the difficulty of degradation and the complex compositions of bio-oil, imposing an obstacle for its commercial application. Some typical organic solid wastes such as sewage sludge [43], food waste [44], animal manure [45] and waste paper [46] have also been used as the liquefaction feedstock. Sewage sludge is produced from wastewater treatment, featuring with high-moisture content. Due to high water content, liquefaction is regarded as an effective method to treat sewage sludge for bio-oil production [47,48]. Food waste is the proportion of raw materials that cannot be utilized in the production of desirable materials, which is commonly generated from the restaurant and food processing industry [49]. Especially, the diverse composition of food waste makes it an attractive source for the production of liquefied bio-oil. Animal manures are the livestock wastes, which contain tremendous energy potential owing to carbonaceous nature and proper physicochemical properties. Swine manure and cattle manure have usually been employed as feedstock for bio-oil production via liquefaction treatment [50]. Waste paper is generated in large amounts from various fields, and it contains cellulosic components that can be liquefied to bio-oil [51]. Algae is one of the most promising energy resources for bio-oil production, and it has some advantages in comparison with terrestrial plants owing to its shorter growing cycles, better adaptability in different climates and versatility of the byproducts [7,52,53]. Like sewage sludge, algae contain high moisture content and can be effectively transformed into the bio-oil through liquefaction treatment, which requires lower than that via pyrolysis. Some examples of algae liquefaction have been reported over the last years, and the employed feedstocks include Spirulina platensis [54], Entermorpha prolifera [55], Dunaliella tertiolecta [56], Gracilaria gracilis [57], etc."
2,Co-liquefaction of biomass,"Co-liquefaction of biomass mixtures offers a beneficial manner to make full use of all types of biomasses available, which can improve the yield and quality of bio-oil, relieve the severity of reaction parameters and reduce the logistics cost through the potential synergistic effect [58]. As shown in Fig. 1 , during the co-liquefaction of different biomass combinations, the interaction from the intermediates derived from degradation of different structural components gave rise to the differences in yield, chemical components and quality of bio-oils. The co-liquefaction of mixed biomass feedstocks could exhibit a synergistic influence on the formation of bio-oil, thus improving the economic benefit of the reaction process. In the following section, co-liquefaction behaviors of various biomass mixtures are thoroughly reviewed."
3,Co-liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass and other biomass,"3.1 Co-liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass and other biomass As an abundant feedstock, lignocellulose has been co-liquefied with a range of carbonaceous materials to enhance yield as well as improve bio-oil quality. Liquefaction of lignocellulose with algae has been reported to be advantageous. The major components from algal biomass included proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, and their thermal stability was lower than that of lignocellulose. Thus, the conversion degree of algal biomass was expected to be higher than those of cellulose and lignin [59]. Owing to the interaction effect between algae and lignocellulose, the co-liquefaction process promoted the degradation of the cellulose/lignin component in lignocellulose with high thermal resistance, and thus alleviated the harsh reaction conditions. Feng et al. carried out the co-liquefaction of Spartina alterniflora with Spirulina in ethanol-water medium at 340 °C [26]. Due to their synergistic effect, the highest bio-oil yield of 45.63% with an improved heating value (34 MJ/kg) was achieved from the co-liquefaction process. The author proposed that the interaction effect from co-liquefaction of mixed raw materials was affected by reaction parameters. A negative effect obtained at a lower temperature range was shown to inhibit bio-oil production, whereas synergistic effect became positive above the critical temperature. In addition, when the biomass mixing ratio was 1:1, the two feedstocks exhibited the strongest synergistic effect in the co-liquefaction process, resulting in an increase in bio-oil yield. The reason for the different performances was not discussed, which may be attributed to varied reactivity of feedstock components under different reaction conditions. The bio-oil characterization suggested that co-liquefaction treatment promoted the formation of ester species and thus improved the bio-oil quality. Similar phenomena were observed by Gai et al. [23]. The research investigated the co-liquefaction behavior of rice husk and Chorella pyrenoidosa, which reported that mutual interaction of mixed feedstock altered the chemical composition of bio-oil. The distribution of major components in bio-oil was not to be linearly proportional to the feedstock mixture ratio, implying the complicated nature of synergistic interaction. Based on the analysis of bio-oil components, the co-liquefaction effect caused the reduction of acidic and nitrogenous compounds, and thus improved the fuel properties of bio-oil. Additionally, co-liquefaction behavior for binary mixtures including organic solid waste and lignocellulose has also been extensively investigated. In particular, sewage sludge mainly consists of organic substances such as proteins and lipids, which can be co-liquefied with lignocellulosic biomass to improve bio-oil yield and properties. Leng and coworkers conducted the co-liquefaction of sewage sludge and rice straw/wood sawdust in ethanol at 300 °C [24]. Compared with the liquefaction of pure feedstock, co-liquefaction of biomass mixture was more advantageous to the production of bio-oil and improved the fuel properties due to their mutual cooperative effect. The beneficial synergy for the bio-oil yield was attributed to the interaction of intermediates derived from degradation of raw materials. Notably, alkaline species in sewage sludge could act as catalysts to enhance the conversion of biomass components, thus promoting the generation of bio-oil. GC-MS analysis also proved that the existence of co-liquefaction effect affected the chemical constituents of bio-oil. Small esters and phenolic species were the dominant fractions in the co-liquefied bio-oil because lignin-derived intermediates such as phenols mutually affected the formation of protein-derived fragments. Thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that the content of low boiling point compounds in the co-liquefied bio-oil was higher than that from liquefaction alone, as the positive interaction effect boosted the decomposition of large fragments. A similar experiment focusing on co-liquefaction of sewage sludge and lignocellulose was performed by Huang et al. [60]. Nevertheless, a synergistic effect on the bio-oil yield was not observed during the co-liquefaction process. The possible reason for this phenomenon was that the organic components of sewage sludge were similar to those of lignocellulose. According to elemental analysis, the addition of woody biomass into the convesion of sewage sludge favored the removal of N and S in bio-oil and improved the content of oxygen and hydrogen. The GC-MS results illustrated that co-liquefaction treatment reduced the ester content but promoted the generation of phenolic species. Additionally, lignocellulose was also utilized to be co-liquefied with food waste. The co-liquefaction of spent coffee grounds and three types of lignocellulose was conducted in subcritical water with an alkali catalyst [61]. The mutual effect was related to the interaction between lignocellulosic components and other chemical fragments such as lipids in spent coffee grounds. The fatty acids from hydrolysis of lipids favored the decomposition of the lignin fraction under the acidic condition. The acids produced could also interact with lignin derivatives through dehydration and esterification to form more ester species. Under the catalysis of NaOH, the combination of corn stalk and spent coffee grounds had the strongest synergy on the bio-oil yield. Nevertheless, a negative impact was achieved from the co-processing of white pine bark and spent coffee grounds, which was possibly due to the increasing formation of organic acid that weakened the activity of the alkali catalyst. In addition, the positive synergy from co-liquefaction led to a reduction in molecular mass and oily viscosity, which highly improved the fuel properties of bio-oil. Generally, during the co-liquefaction of lignocellulose and other types of biomass, the active intermediates from the degradation of lignocellulose and other substances, such as lipid-derived fragments and alkaline species, could interact with each other and then promote the formation of bio-oil. Furthermore, co-liquefaction effect also improved the quality of bio-oil and altered the chemical composition."
4,Co-liquefaction of organic solid waste and other biomass,"3.2 Co-liquefaction of organic solid waste and other biomass The utilization of organic solid waste such as waste paper, animal manure, and food waste for co-liquefaction with other kinds of biomass has been reported. Zhang et al. found that secondary pulp/paper-mill sludge was co-liquefied with waste newspaper in a water medium [62]. The synergistic effect observed from co-liquefaction favored the formation of bio-oil. This phenomenon was possibly associated with the alkali and alkaline earth metals in sludge, which boosted the conversion of organic substances in newspaper and thus improved the bio-oil yield. Additionally, N-containing species in secondary pulp/paper-mill sludge may be reduced to ammonia, which could act as a base catalyst to enhance the degradation of lignocellulosic components. The co-liquefaction effect also led to a reduction in the oxygen and nitrogen contents in the bio-oil, thus improving the caloric value. Biller et al. also investigated the co-liquefaction of sewage sludge and different types of lignocellulose in subcritical water [63]. The synergistic effect on the production of bio-oil was attributed to the mutual interaction of reaction intermediates. The speculation was that the formed NH4 derived from the degradation of proteins in sludge promoted the conversion of lignocellulose, leading to an increase in bio-oil yield. Another possible reason for the positive synergy was related to a high mass loading during the co-liquefaction process. Additionally, co-processing of biomass mixture improved the caloric value of bio-oil and energy recovery compared with single liquefaction. Additionally, co-liquefaction behavior between animal manure and other feedstocks was also investigated. Saba et al. evaluated the liquefaction interaction of cow manure with loblolly pine wood in subcritical water at 300 °C and 30 min [64]. The synergistic effect on the bio-oil yield was attributed to organic acids derived from the degradation of loblolly pine wood that improved the conversion of manure components, thus enhancing the formation of bio-oil. Due to the interaction effect, the viscosity of bio-oil declined remarkably in the co-liquefaction system compared with that of individual liquefaction. Based on GC-MS analysis, co-liquefaction of biomass mixture was suggested to alter the chemical constituents of bio-oil, which led to a higher content of phenol and hydrocarbon compared with that of loblolly pine alone. Additionally, Chen et al. investigated the co-liquefaction of swine manure and mixed-culture algae for bio-oil production [27]. The co-liquefaction of manure and algae with a proper mixing ratio caused an acidic atmosphere, which could boost the destruction of hemicellulose lignin components and thus result in an improved bio-oil yield. Notably, a raw material with a high ash content would affect the formation of bio-oil, but the role of ash in the co-liquefaction process is unclear and requires further investigation. In addition, the co-liquefaction treatment could also affect the properties of the bio-oil, because the formation of the heavy oil fraction was enhanced as the manure proportion increased. Xiu et al. conducted the co-liquefaction of swine manure and crude glycerol to enhance bio-oil production [65]. The co-liquefaction of mixed feedstock exhibited a positive effect on the bio-oil yield. On the one hand, the presence of alkaline compounds such as NaOH and KOH in crude glycerol could act as catalysts to promote hydrolysis of swine manure. On the other hand, glycerol was considered as a hydrogen donor, which could stabilize the intermediate radicals through hydrogen transfer to improve the bio-oil yield. However, co-liquefaction with glycerol was found to show a negative impact on the quality of bio-oil, such as a lower carbon content and heating value, which was due to the presence of a high ash content in glycerol. For other types of organic solid waste, spent coffee grounds, as a common food processing residue, was co-liquefied with microalgae (Chlorella sp) in subcritical water at 290 °C for 10 min [66]. The synergistic effect of co-liquefaction on the bio-oil yield originated from the interaction among various intermediates from the degradation of raw materials. Compared with the individual liquefaction, the chemical composition and viscosity of bio-oil were more favorable due to the co-liquefaction effect. Additionally, the degree of the interaction effect on the bio-oil yield was related to the used solvent type, and thus it is necessary to discuss how the solvent affects the mutual interaction of feedstock components during the co-liquefaction process. Overall, organic solid waste is often utilized to co-liquefy with lignocellulose and algae. Notably, the amount and properties of the bio-oil derived from the co-liquefaction process were superior to those of single treatment. Such phenomena were likely related to the significant interaction of produced fragments at a molecular level. The inherent compositions and properties of raw materials, such as alkaline metals in sewage sludge, could further affect the co-conversion behavior of mixed feedstocks and the bio-oil properties. In terms of co-liquefaction with animal manure, more research efforts are required to elucidate how animal manure interacts with other feedstocks during the co-liquefaction process."
5,Co-liquefaction of algal biomass and other biomass,"3.3 Co-liquefaction of algal biomass and other biomass Algae are considered as one of the most promising and attractive energy sources. Jin et al. conducted a study on the co-liquefaction of microalgae and macroalgae in subcritical water [25]. A positive synergistic effect existed during co-liquefaction of Spirulina platensis and Entermorpha prolifera, and the variation in reaction conditions could affect the interaction degree of mixed feedstocks. During the liquefaction process, fatty acids derived from Spirulina platensis degradation boosted the decomposition of Entermorpha prolifera, which was inhibited due to its high content of inorganic salt. Thus, co-treatment remarkably enhanced the formation of bio-oil. GC-MS results indicated that a series of chemical species was detected only in the co-liquefaction bio-oil, further proving the presence of an interaction effect. Besides, co-liquefaction promoted the occurrence of deoxygenation, thus resulting in bio-oil with an improved heating value. In comparison with individual liquefaction, higher energy recovery was obtained from co-liquefaction due to the mutual interaction of reaction intermediates. Researchers have also made some efforts to investigate algae biomass co-liquefied with other biomass feedstocks. Brilman et al. investigated the interaction effect from co-hydrothermal liquefaction of three types of biomass, including Desmodesmus sp, pine wood and sugar beet pulp [67]. For different feedstock combinations, a stronger interaction was obtained from the mixture including microalgae because microalgae could be decomposed readily at a relatively lower temperature. The intermediates produced, such as acetic acid, from algae degradation caused acidic conditions, which could boost the liquefaction of other biomass components. Thus, co-liquefaction with algal biomass could highly affect bio-oil production. Additionally, Zhang et al. conducted the co-liquefaction of Laminaria japonica and sweet potato vine for liquid fuel production [68]. Due to the distinction in the biochemical components, co-liquefaction of mixed feedstocks showed a synergistic effect on the compositional distribution of bio-oil, which led to a reduction in nitrogenous species and an increase in phenolic compounds. Furthermore, the co-liquefaction process also favored deoxygenation and denitrification, and thus the heating value of bio-oil was improved. Organic solid waste was also employed to co-liquefy with algal biomass for bio-oil production. Xu and coworkers carried out co-hydrothermal liquefaction of chlorella and sewage sludge in subcritical water [69]. A synergistic effect on the bio-oil yield was observed during the co-liquefaction process, as the bio-oil yield from co-processing of microalgae and sludge was higher than the theoretical value. This is because co-liquefaction treatment could enhance the conversion of organic substances in the raw materials to form more bio-oil. In addition, ash in sewage sludge at a proper amount acted as a catalyst that improved the production of bio-oil. Nevertheless, co-liquefaction of mixed feedstock showed a negative effect on the bio-oil quality, possibly because co-liquefaction suppressed the deoxygenation and enhanced the loss of carbon and hydrogen in the gas form. GC-MS results revealed that the contents of amides, phenols and alcohols from the co-liquefaction were not proportional to the mixing ratio of feedstock. This is because the interaction between microalgae and sludge impacted the conversion route of organic fragments, thus resulting in the variation of compositional properties. Besides, the interaction effect from co-hydrothermal liquefaction of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and sweet potato residue was explored by Wang et al. [58]. The addition of sweet potato residue exhibited an adverse influence on the yield of bio-oil due to the presence of a stable lignin component, which weakened the transformation of the mixed feedstock. However, the bio-oil quality, such as the heating value and energy recovery from co-liquefaction, was superior to the theoretical value, which was attributed to the synergistic effect that enhanced decarboxylation and dehydration. Furthermore, the co-liquefaction effect resulted in the bio-oil with a higher hydrocarbon content due to an improved Maillard reaction between protein and starch components. In general, the synergistic influence on the formation of bio-oil existed from the combination of algae and other biomass feedstocks. As for the protein-rich algae, the mutual interaction partially originated from chemical reactions such as the Maillard reaction. Additionally, the interaction from these produced fragments also affected co-liquefaction behavior, which could further improve the bio-oil properties and alter the chemical composition. Nevertheless, algae-derived bio-oil included a high amount of nitrogenous species that needed further treatment for nitrogen removal."
6,Reaction parameters for mixed biomass liquefaction,"3.4 Reaction parameters for mixed biomass liquefaction The quantity and quality of bio-oil from the co-liquefaction process are dependent on the typical operating conditions including solvent type, catalyst type, reaction temperature and time, and mixing ratio of blending feedstocks. The influences of individual parameters on the co-liquefaction behaviors are evaluated comprehensively in the following subsections. 3.4.1 Effect of solvent The existing research has indicated that the suitable reaction mediums can promote the degradation of solid biopolymer into smaller fragments during co-liquefaction. Table 1 summarizes the reaction solvents that have been utilized in the co-liquefaction process. Water, as an inexpensive and green solvent, has been widely utilized in the co-liquefaction of mixed feedstock. Due to its characteristics in the critical state, water is considered as an excellent medium to promote the conversion of biomass components. Gai et al. investigated rice husk co-liquefied with chlorella pyrenoidosa in subcritical water for bio-oil production [23]. During the co-liquefaction process, water acted as both a heat-transfer medium and a catalyst. Especially in the subcritical state, water molecules were dissociated into H+ and OH− ions that could boost the acid and base-catalyzed reaction under hydrothermal conditions. The organic substances from feedstock degradation could also be dissolved easily in subcritical water, which enhanced the production of bio-oil. In addition, the proper feedstock/water ratio could improve the interaction between biomass-derived intermediates and the water medium, and thus hydrolysis of feedstock components was promoted to enhance the bio-oil yield. This observation agrees well with the work that reported the co-liquefaction of Spirulina platensis and Entermorpha prolifera in subcritical water [25]. The presence of water improved the hydrolysis of carbohydrate and protein components in algae, which served as a reaction medium and a reactant in the hydrothermal environment. With a proper algae/water mass ratio, the liquid intermediates could be diluted well in water, which inhibited the polymerization of these fragments to form solids. Besides, when the increased temperature approached the critical point of water, gasification dominated the liquefaction process and thus more gaseous products were formed, resulting in a reduction in bio-oil yield. Additionally, an investigation on swine manure co-processed with mixed-culture algal biomass was conducted by Chen and coworkers [27]. The research work suggested that water acted as an excellent medium to enhance the conversion of biomass components, such as thermal cracking of protein components, and thus a quantity of light matter was formed during the process. Simultaneously, water could provide active radicals to stabilize these reactive intermediates for the production of bio-oil. In addition to water, the introduction of an alcohol medium in the co-liquefaction of mixed feedstock has also been investigated. Zhai et al. conducted a study on the co-liquefaction behavior of sewage sludge and oil-tea-cake in methanol [70]. The addition of oil-tea-cake into the liquefaction of sludge could increase the relative content of organic substances, which may be converted into bio-oil products under proper conditions. As the most abundant fatty acid in oil-tea-cake, oleic acid reacted with methanol through esterification to produce methyl esters, which improved the bio-oil yield during the co-liquefaction process. For sewage sludge co-liquefied with rice straw/wood sawdust, the presence of ethanol molecules could extract the chemical compositions of raw materials, thus promoting the dissolution of reaction fragments [60]. As the intermediates from feedstock degradation were dissolved well in ethanol, the interaction effect of these reactive species was enhanced. A higher biomass loading weakened the interaction degree between feedstock and ethanol, which inhibited the hydrolysis reaction to produce oily products. Clearly, the alcohol molecule could dissolve the degraded biomass fragments and provide active hydrogen radicals through transfer of α-hydrogen to stabilize the intermediates, resulting in an increase in bio-oil yield [73]. Co-solvents such as organic solvent-water were also adopted in the co-liquefaction process. The superiority of co-solvents was reported from the co-liquefaction of Spartina alterniflora and Spirulina in an ethanol-water medium [26]. The results indicated that the introduction of an ethanol in water medium showed a significant effect on the co-liquefaction of mixed feedstocks. The liquefaction degree of biomass was highly improved in the co-solvent, and the polymeric components were readily converted into small fragments, thus improving the bio-oil yield. The volume ratio of 1:1 was the appropriate ratio for ethanol-water co-solvent, which highly favored the transformation of biomass into oily products. This phenomenon was attributed to a cooperative effect in ethanol-water medium. On the one hand, ethanol had a lower dielectric constant than water, which could readily dissolve large intermediates from biomass degradation and act as a hydrogen donor to stabilize the reactive fragments. On the other hand, water with stronger acidity improved the hydrolytic decomposition of biomass components. In summary, co-presence of ethanol and water could promote the co-liquefaction of biomass feedstock for bio-oil production. Similarly, co-processing of Chlorella and aspen wood sawdust in ethanol-water mixed solvents was carried out by Hu et al. [72]. The study demonstrated that the bio-oil yield from a co-solvent system was higher than that obtained in a single medium, mainly due to the synergistic effect between ethanol and water. Furthermore, in ethanol-water mixed solvents, algae and lignocellulose showed a synergistic effect on the improvement of bio-oil quality, which indicated that bio-oil from co-liquefaction had a higher energy recovery and higher content of light fractions. Water, as a green and cheap solvent, has been widely utilized in the liquefaction of biomass feedstock, which simultaneously acts as reactant and catalyst [74]. The presence of water results in the hydrolysis of biomass, promoting the degradation of the polymeric structure. Moreover, when the reaction conditions approach the critical point, water exhibits several interesting characteristics. For example, the viscosity of water in the critical state is highly decreased, and the solubility for the organic substances and gases is enhanced, which render water a good medium for the effective liquefaction [75]. However, the water in the critical region poses a great challenge for the liquefaction process, due to the higher reaction temperature and pressure. Additionally, the bio-oils produced from water contain high oxygen content, thus reducing the quality and storage stability. To solve this problem, alcohols are introduced to the liquefaction reaction, which have several advantages over water. Firstly, it can provide the milder reaction conditions due to the lower critical temperature and pressure [40]. Secondly, the solubility for the bio-oil is better due to the lower electric constant. Thirdly, the hydrogen radicals from the alcohols can stabilize the intermediates to inhibit polymerization, and thus facilitate the production of bio-oil [73]. Nevertheless, the use of alcohols as the liquefaction solvents, especially the large molecular alcohols, yields some problems such as high cost, difficult recovery from the liquid products and the environmental concerns. Clearly, processing with sole water or alcohol as the liquefaction solvent has its own merits and demerits. In view of this, a suitable strategy for the biomass liquefaction is to use alcohol-water co-solvents, which can combine the advantage of the respective solvent. Furthermore, a higher bio-oil yield and improved oily quality are achieved from the alcohol-water mixed solvents due to their synergistic effect. According to the previous literatures, the employed reaction mediums for co-liquefaction treatment are commonly water and small alcohols. Most investigations highlighted that the alcohols as the hydrogen donor stabilized the intermediate radicals to improve the feedstock conversion and bio-oil yield. However, researchers did not specifically clarify the mechanism of the hydrogen transfer using alcohols in the co-liquefaction process. As regards to other types of solvents such as polyalcohol and ionic liquid, limited information was provided. Notably, the recovery of these large mediums in the co-liquefaction product is an issue to be concerned. One possible method is to employ co-solvent that consists of water mixed with low concentrations of organic solvents, which do not require to attempt recovery. Alternatively, the co-solvent in the aqueous product stream from the liquefaction process can be recycled simply. This is because the consumption of organic medium like polyalcohol is quite low, the aqueous solution is rich in the solvent. Additionally, the impact of solvent such as molecular structure and polarity on the synergy between varied feedstocks is also required to be discussed. In conclusion, there are opportunities to elaborate the solvent effect on the co-liquefaction behavior of biomass mixture, and to reveal the underlying mechanism. 3.4.2 Effect of catalysts Catalysts are undoubtedly important during co-liquefaction processes and can affect the conversion rate, product distribution and bio-oil quality. Huang et al. discussed the effect of potassium/sodium salts (-OH and –CO3) and iron-based catalysts (FeSO4 and FeS) on the co-liquefaction of sewage sludge and rice straw/wood sawdust [60]. During the co-liquefaction process, FeSO4 and FeS showed minor effects on the product yield, while NaOH and Na2CO3 exhibited similar catalytic effects on the co-liquefaction of sewage sludge and rice straw. For sewage sludge co-treated with wood sawdust, potassium salt showed identical impacts on the liquefaction degree, whereas the catalytic capability of NaOH was superior to that of Na2CO3. There are two possible reasons concerning the catalytic effects of alkali metals. On the one hand, the presence of alkali catalysts could weaken the carbon-carbon connection, leading to a reduction in the activation energy. On the other hand, the internal surface area of the raw material was increased, due to swelling of biomass caused by alkali catalysts [76]. Under the influence of alkali catalysts, the co-liquefaction degree of sewage sludge and lignocellulosic biomass was enhanced. Furthermore, the quality of bio-oil was also improved, and the contents of nitrogen and sulfur were reduced. In the co-liquefaction of spent coffee grounds with paper filter, corn stalk and white pine bark, NaOH was utilized as a catalyst to investigate the catalytic effect on the co-liquefaction of mixed feedstocks for bio-oil production [61]. The addition of catalyst could enhance the synergistic effect from the mixed feedstocks, leading to a remarkable difference between the actual bio-oil yield and experimental value. Besides, for varied feedstock combinations, the degree of interaction effect was different under the alkali catalyst. A strong synergistic effect was achieved from spent coffee grounds co-liquefied with corn stalk, and a moderate effect was observed in the co-processing of spent coffee grounds and paper filter. This phenomenon was mainly attributed to their inherent structural components, especially the lignin content. The amount of lignin in the raw materials was low, and thus pH variation of the reaction medium would not highly affect the liquefaction degree. At the early stage, the introduction of alkali catalysts weakened the glucoside bond and promoted the hydrolysis of lipids, resulting in an improvement in carbohydrate and lipid components degradation. Then, along with the formation of organic acids, the reaction system with a low pH value favored the degradation of holocellulose and thus promoted the generation of bio-oil [59]. However, a negative impact was observed from spent coffee grounds co-liquefied with white pine bark, due to the formed organic acid that weakened the catalytic ability of NaOH. Thus, conversion degree of the biomass component decreased, resulting in a reduction in bio-oil yield. Additionally, Jasiūnas et al. conducted a study on the co-liquefaction of spent mushroom compost and aspen wood sawdust [77]. The addition of K2CO3 catalyst showed a beneficial influence on the improvement of bio-oil yield and quality, which enhanced the conversion degree of mixed feedstock. Additionally, organic acids have also shown excellent catalytic effects on the co-liquefaction behavior of mixed feedstock. Zhang et al. compared the effects of various catalysts (HCOOH, FeS and KOH) on the co-treatment of secondary pulp/paper-mill sludge and waste newspaper [62]. HCOOH showed the strongest catalytic effect on the production of heavy oil, which was attributed to the formation of free radicals such as hydrogen radicals formed in situ [78]. The presence of hydrogen radicals favored the hydrocracking of polymeric components into small fragments, and it also acted as a stabilization agent to inhibit the repolymerization of intermediates into solid char. Furthermore, these reactive radicals could interact with each other to form a hydrogen atmosphere. Under reducing conditions, the bio-oil yield was improved [79]. The hydrogen formed in situ was more favorable to the degradation of biomass-derived intermediates due to a higher contact efficiency compared with the externally supplied hydrogen. The added KOH also improved the yield of heavy oil due to its alkalinity, which could destroy the polymeric structure of biomass components. According to previous work, homogeneous catalysts, mainly alkaline and organic acids, are commonly utilized in the co-liquefaction process, which affect the quality and quantity of bio-oil. However, few studies on heterogeneous catalysts applied to the co-liquefaction process have been reported because it exhibits a lower catalytic ability than homogeneous catalysts. On the one hand, the reaction substance and heterogeneous catalyst are unable to mix evenly in a molecular size, thus weakening the conversion of solid biomass into bio-oil. On the other hand, liquefied residues such as solid char are mixed with heterogeneous catalysts, which poses an obstacle to reusing the catalyst in an economical manner. Catalyst selection is related to the used feedstock types, solvents and reaction parameters. When an appropriate catalyst is used, it can alleviate the condition severity without compromising the bio-oil yield, which highly increases the economics of reaction process. Additionally, due to the complicated reactions during the co-liquefaction, the utilization of multiple catalysts together can impact the diverse reactions, which facilitate the formation of target products. To further improve the bio-oil yield, catalytic co-liquefaction in continuous operation is better than a batch process, which needs to be investigated in future work. 3.4.3 Effect of temperature and time The reaction temperature and reaction time are important variables affecting the co-liquefaction behavior of biomass. According to the previous literature, many research groups have investigated the influence of reaction temperature and time on the co-liquefaction process, as summarized in Table 2 . In all cases, the results indicated that the yield of bio-oil initially increased with elevated temperature and prolonged time. However, beyond a critical point, a further increase in temperature and time resulted in a reduced bio-oil yield to a certain extent. Hu et al. conducted a study on the effect of reaction temperature and time on the co-liquefaction of aspen wood sawdust and Chlorella [72]. Since the reaction temperature was elevated from 200 to 250 °C, the production of bio-oil was enhanced possibly due to the promoted hydrolysis of macromolecular components in the feedstock. However, with a further increase in reaction temperature, the bio-oil yield showed a downward tendency because the liquid intermediates were degraded into smaller fragments, which may be lost during the solvent evaporation process. Besides, the repolymerization of oil intermediates into solid residue was also improved at a high temperature, thus leading to a reduction in bio-oil yield. With regard to residence time, as it exceeded an optimal point, the production of bio-oil was inhibited due to thermal cracking and condensation of oily components. According to Gai et al. the maximum yield of bio-oil was achieved at 300 °C and 60 min from co-conversion of rice husk and Chlorella pyrenoidosa [23]. At a lower temperature range, organic substances in the raw materials were decomposed into oily components. When the reaction temperature was beyond the specific point (300 °C), the bio-oil yield decreased along with the enhanced production of gas, which was attributed to the secondary decomposition of bio-oil. As the reaction time was longer than 60 min, it would cause the repolymerization and condensation of bio-oil into solid products, and thus the bio-oil yield was reduced. Notably, the selection of reaction time for bio-oil production during co-liquefaction was associated with the structural compositions of the feedstock. A similar observation was made by Huang and coworkers [60]. The variation in reaction temperature could affect the competitive reactions occurred in the co-liquefaction process, which thus impacted the distribution of liquefied products. These competitive reactions involved the degradation of solid substances into bio-oil, thermal cracking of intermediates into gaseous products and fragment recombination into solid residues. Based on the results, an initial increase in temperature resulted in the degradation of biomass components, which improved the production of bio-oil. However, as the temperature further increased, the secondary decomposition and repolymerization of oil fragments dominated, resulting in the improved generation of gas and solid products. Similarly, the maximum bio-oil yield was achieved at a proper reaction time, while beyond the saturation point the gas yield was highly increased at the expense of bio-oil. Additionally, some studies have also focused on the influence of reaction temperature and time on co-liquefaction of algal biomass. According to Dandamudi et al. a reaction temperature of 300 °C and a residence time of 30 min were the optimal condition for bio-oil production during co-processing of Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria sulphuraria [81]. As the reaction temperature ranged from 150 to 300 °C, the increased temperature favored the degradation of organic matter in algal biomass, thus resulting in a continuous increase in bio-oil yield. Notably, lipid components in algae were sensitive to temperature and were readily hydrolyzed into fatty acids and glycerol. With the temperature further increased, the proteins and carbohydrates were also converted into oil products. For reaction time, when the bio-oil yield reached a maximum at the critical point, a further increase in time exhibited a negative effect on the bio-oil yield, possibly due to cracking and re-polymerization of oil intermediates. The effect of reaction parameters on the co-liquefaction of macroalgae and microalgae was investigated by Jin et al. [25]. It was concluded that 340 °C and 60 min were the optimum conditions for co-processing of Spirulina platensis and Entermorpha prolifera for bio-oil yield. The reduced bio-oil yield at a higher temperature was due to the condensation and decomposition of liquid components into char and light substances. Notably, the interaction degree from co-liquefaction of mixed feedstocks was related to reaction temperature to a certain extent. The higher temperature could weaken the interaction degree due to the enhanced reactivity of Entermorpha prolifera. In addition, the optimal temperature for bio-oil production from co-liquefaction was lower than that of liquefaction alone, which was attributed to the mutual interaction of algal components. Compared with reaction temperature, residence time showed a minor effect on the product yield. When the reaction time was beyond 40 min, the bio-oil yield was slightly decreased and then levelled off due to the polymerization of bio-oil into a solid product. As far as organic solid waste is concerned, Yang et al. proposed that the maximum yield of bio-oil from spent coffee grounds co-liquefied with varied lignocellulosic biomass was obtained at 250 °C for 10 min [61]. The optimized temperature of 250 °C was associated with the relative content of carbohydrate and lignin components in the raw material. An increase in reaction temperature accelerated the decomposition of biomass, especially lignin-rich feedstock. However, as the temperature surpassed the critical point, the secondary reaction would be more competitive and resulted in a reduced bio-oil yield. Under identical temperatures, the feedstock combination of spent coffee grounds and corn stalk had the highest bio-oil yield compared with other mixture systems, possibly due to their strong synergistic effect on bio-oil production. The interesting results were also found by Zhang and co-workers who have explored the co-liquefaction of secondary pulp/paper-mill sludge and waste newspaper at different temperatures [62]. When the temperature was increased initially, the yields of water-soluble products and heavy oil were improved along with a reduction in the solid yield, possibly due to the enhanced degradation of polymeric components in the feedstock. As the temperature exceeded 350 °C, the bio-oil yield decreased as the solid and gas yield increase. Notably, the gaseous product was mainly derived from thermal cracking of water-soluble products and heavy oil, whereas the solid residue only originated from condensation of the heavy oil fraction. Overall, the initial increase in reaction temperature and time promoted the formation of bio-oil, whereas beyond a certain point the bio-oil yield tended to be reduced or levelled off. To achieve the highest bio-oil yield, reaction temperature and residence time should be optimized to inhibit the repolymerization and condensation of oily intermediates during the co-liquefaction process. The optimal reaction temperature and time depend on the biomass type and its inherent constituent. Notably, the addition of suitable catalyst with a proper amount can reduce the required reaction temperature and time for bio-oil production. The reaction temperature also controls the reaction pressure in the reactor, which is also an important parameter that affects the liquefaction behavior of feedstock. High temperature and pressure cause the solvent to be in a critical state, which can improve the solvent properties that facilitate hydrolysis of organic matters. Besides, temperature sensitivity of varied biomass compositions is different, which may affect the mutual interaction of feedstock-derived intermediates. Therefore, it is essential to elaborate the influence of reaction temperature and time on the synergistic effect during the co-liquefaction process. 3.4.4 Effect of mixing ratios of feedstocks The mixing ratio of biomass mixture is a crucial parameter that affects the interaction degree of the reaction intermediates during the co-liquefaction process. The effect of the mixture ratio from various biomass combinations is summarized in Table 3 . According to Zhang et al. a significant difference in bio-oil yield from co-liquefaction of sweet potato vine and laminaria japonica with various mixing ratios was achieved due to the interaction effect of their biochemical constituents in varying degrees [68]. The highest bio-oil yield was obtained with a lignocellulose/algae mixing ratio of 1:1. In addition, the synergistic effect from the mixed feedstocks also affected the yield of solid products. The increment of lignocellulose ratio in the mixture limited the production of solid char, possibly due to a low ash content in the lignocellulosic biomass. GC-MS results suggested that feedstock combinations with varied mixing ratios exhibited a different impact on the oil compositions. As the percentage of sweet potato vine increased, the increased content of phenolic compounds was mainly due to degradation of the lignin component in sweet potato vine. However, a reduction in the algae ratio led to a decreased content of nitrogenous species, mostly originating from the conversion of proteins in algae. With the optimal ratio of 1:1, the high content of C10–C21 hydrocarbons detected in the bio-oil was similar to the composition of diesel oil, implying that the fuel properties of liquid product were improved. This result is consistent with some publications where a mixing ratio of 1:1 was the optimal condition for bio-oil production [24,72]. During the co-treatment of organic sewage sludge and rice straw/wood sawdust, the actual yield of bio-oil obtained from the co-liquefaction process was higher than the theoretical one, indicating that the mixed feedstock showed a positive synergy for the production of bio-oil [24]. At the optimum mixing ratio of 1:1, a larger difference between experimental and theoretical values suggested a stronger synergy from the mixed feedstock, and thus the highest bio-oil yield was obtained. The improvement in bio-oil production was ascribed to the mutual interaction of feedstock components. On the one hand, the intermediates from the degradation of lignocellulose could interact with sewage sludge-derived fragments, resulting in an increased bio-oil yield. On the other hand, alkaline species in sludge acted as catalysts that boosted the conversion of lignocellulose, which favored the generation of bio-oil. Similarly, Hu et al. proposed that the bio-oil yield peaked at approximately 58 wt% with a mass ratio of 1:1 from Chlorella and sawdust mixture [72]. Due to the synergistic effect, the bio-oil yield from co-liquefaction was higher than the theoretical value. At the optimal ratio of 1:1, the bio-oil had the highest energy recovery compared with other mixed systems. In addition, the content of light components in bio-oil was also the highest, suggesting that the co-liquefaction effect improved the bio-oil properties. However, the optimized mixing ratio differed from that of 1:1, which has also been reported in previous work. Wang et al. investigated the effect of mixed ratios from Chlorella pyrenoidosa/sweet potato residue on the production of bio-oil [58]. The mixing ratio of feedstock could impact the interaction degree in the co-liquefaction process. When the mixing ratio of Chlorella pyrenoidosa/sweet potato residue was 5:1, the bio-oil yield was found to be the highest. However, the actual bio-oil yield was lower than the theoretical value, especially when the microalgae/lignocellulose ratio was changed from 3/1 to 1/3. This observation was mainly ascribed to some possible reasons. First, a greater fraction of starch-rich biomass could form more water-soluble organic species, preventing the formation of bio-oil. Second, with the increased content of sweet potato residue, the interaction from the reducing sugars and lignin-derived intermediates was more profound, which promoted the condensation of bio-oil into solid char. Finally, as the sweet potato residue ratio increased, the system pH changed from an alkaline to an acidic atmosphere, which impacted the production of bio-oil. In addition, the heating value of bio-oil from co-liquefaction with a mixing ratio of 5:1 was higher than the theoretical value, indicating a higher energy density. Gai et al. conducted a study on the effect of Chlorella pyrenoidosa/rice husk mixing ratio on the liquid yield [23]. The results indicated that the bio-oil yield increased constantly with the microalgae ratio increase, which was related to the chemical composition of the raw materials and operating conditions. The increased proportion of microalgae with low ash content reduced the solid yield, suggesting that the formation of solid char was related to ash in the feedstock. In addition, the varied mixing ratios of microalgae/lignocellulose also impacted the chemical composition of the bio-oil. With the microalgae ratio increased, the relative content of nitrogenous components increased due to the high protein content in algae, and the amount of O-containing compounds such as esters and ketones decreased to a certain degree due to the varied interaction degree of the two feedstocks. In conclusion, the varying mixing ratio affected the interaction degree of intermediates during co-liquefaction of mixed feedstock. Only at a proper mixing ratio, an enhanced synergistic interaction was achieved from the feedstock combination, leading to an improvement in the bio-oil yield and liquefaction efficiency."
7,Compositional analysis of bio-oil from co-liquefaction of biomass,"3.5 Compositional analysis of bio-oil from co-liquefaction of biomass The chemical components of bio-oils originated from single and mixed biomass feedstocks were entirely different due to the interaction of produced intermediates from varied feedstocks. Based on the analysis of oily compositions, the co-liquefaction effect on the formation of chemical compounds as well as the possible reaction pathway could be better understood. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the chemical species of bio-oils produced from the individual feedstock and the mixture were compared to evaluate the interaction effect during the co-liquefaction process. In Fig. 2a, the major constituents of bio-oils from liquefaction of Spirulina, Spartina alterniflora and their mixture were analyzed [26]. It is indicated that the chemical compounds from the conversion of single feedstock were totally different from those of the mixture system. The dominant components of bio-oils from co-liquefaction process included heterocyclic compounds, esters and phenols. Compared with the single Spartina alterniflora, the co-liquefaction of mixed biomass feedstocks resulted in a remarkable reduction of ketone content. Especially, the formation of hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester (HAEE) was highly enhanced in the co-presence of both feedstocks. The phenomenon may be attributed to some reasons. Firstly, the co-liquefaction process was conducted at a high temperature of 340 °C, resulting in cracking of most macromolecules to varying degrees, and thus more bio-oil was generated under the condition. Secondly, the Spirulina was almost fully decomposed at 300 °C, whereas the reaction temperature of 340 °C was insufficient for the complete cracking of Spartina alterniflora. Thus, the partial decomposition of Spartina alterniflora and intermediates might inhibit the pyrogenation and repolymerization of HAEE. Finally, the shorter reaction time in the experiment was unable to cause the secondary reaction, leading to a high content of HAEE. In addition, compared with the liquefaction of single feedstock, the energy recovery rate of bio-oil from the co-liquefaction was higher, which was attributed to the increase of bio-oil yield and heating values. In the case of rice husk liquefied with seaweed “Enteromorpha clathrate (EN)”, the dominant compositions of bio-oil are illustrated in Fig. 2b. Compared with the oily species from the conversion of single algae, the co-liquefaction with lignocellulose greatly decreased the relative abundance of organic acids and elevated the content of ketones. On the basis of these identified compounds, the distribution of the corresponding carbon atoms along with the carbon-number distribution in fossil fuels was compared [71]. The dominant components in EN-derived bio-oil lumped into C15–C20 region and C5–C12 region for rice husk liquefied bio-oil, while 72% of short-chain (C5–C12) and 28% of long-chain (C14–C20) components were contained in the oily fraction from co-liquefaction treatment. It should be noted that the carbon atoms range for kerosene was relatively stabilized in the tested samples. Additionally, the co-liquefaction with EN could inhibit the aromatization or Diels-Alder reactions that occurred in rice husk, leading to a decreased content of aromatics in bio-oil. All the observations were indicative of a synergistic effect from the co-treatment of EN and rice husk. Additionally, co-liquefaction improved the carbon and hydrogen contents in the bio-oil whereas reduced the oxygen and nitrogen contents. Thus, the heating value of bio-oil derived from co-liquefaction process was much higher than that from the individual liquefaction. In the case of the co-liquefaction of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and rice husk, the amount of organic acid in the bio-oil decreased while the hydrocarbon content increased [23]. The mutual interaction from these co-liquefied feedstocks could reduce acidity and elevate the heating value of bio-oil [83]. Therefore, a positive synergistic effect that existed from the co-liquefaction process was beneficial to improve the fuel property of bio-oil. As far as organic solid waste co-liquefied with other feedstocks was concerned, the chemical constituents of bio-oil from co-treatment of microalgae “Chlorella pyrenoidosa” and sweet potato residue were discussed, as shown in Fig. 2c [58]. The predominant compositions of bio-oil from liquefaction of pure microalgae consisted of alkylamides, hydrocarbons and fatty acids, which were mainly produced from hydrolysis of lipid fragments and further conversion of intermediate products. As for sweet potato residue, the majority in the bio-oil was mono-phenolic species, which were achieved from the lignin conversion. After the co-liquefaction, the major species of bio-oil were heterocyclic compounds, fatty acids, hydrocarbons and phenols. The authors mentioned no obvious change in the content of fatty acid derived from the co-conversion of the biomass mixture with the microalgae/sweet potato residue ratio of 5/1. The observation suggested that the introduced sweet potato residue enhanced the Maillard reaction from protein and starch. Consequently, the combination of fatty acid and ammonia produced from protein decomposition was inhibited [84]. The phenolic compounds generated from lignin conversion were not detected from mixed feedstocks, which was associated with the pH of the aqueous phase. When a high fraction of microalgae was added to the mixture, the alkaline condition of the aqueous phase was favorable to dissolve organic matters, and thus resulted in fewer phenolics in the oily phase. Moreover, owing to the positive interaction between microalgae and sweet potato residue, the content of hydrocarbon was increased, and thus improved the bio-oil quality. It was noted that the heating values of bio-oils derived from the varied combinations were close to those of pure microalgae. Compared with the theoretically calculated values, the experimental heating value of co-liquefaction liquid was greater, indicating the higher energy density. Besides, the O/C and H/C ratios of bio-oils were lower than those of raw materials, suggesting that dehydration was the main reaction route in the liquefaction process. With the content of sweet potato residue increased, the H/C ratio and N content in the bio-oils showed a reducing trend, whereas the O/C ratio was slightly increased due to the improved demethanation. As for the swine manure and mixed-culture algae mixture system, the chemical compositions of bio-oils are summarized in Fig. 2d. The relative content of fatty acid increased with the introduction of swine manure whereas the amount of hydrocarbon in the bio-oil was almost unchanged [27]. Additionally, the degradation of fatty acids was prevented from the blending system, and thus the content of esters, aldehydes and alcohols derived from conversion of fatty acids was much lower. With the increased swine manure proportion, the increased alkaloids group was possibly related to the chloride existed in manure. As well known, the chloride favored the synthesis of pyrazines through self-condensation [85]. With regard to the elemental composition, compared with the liquefaction of pure feedstock, the quality of co-liquefied bio-oil such as energy density, carbon and hydrogen contents were not highly improved, which was possibly attributed to the high ash content in the biomass mixture. However, the toluene solubility of bio-oil derived from co-liquefaction system increased with increasing manure fraction. For the carbon recovery and nitrogen recovery of the derived bio-oils, it was noted that increased proportion of swine manure in the mixture showed a negative effect on the carbon recovery of bio-oil, whereas it was beneficial to the increase of nitrogen recovery possibly due to the interaction between the protein derivatives and crude fat derivatives. Additionally, when the content of swine manure increased, the distillate between 200 °C and 300 °C in the bio-oils was decreased, indicating that more heavy fractions were formed in the co-liquefaction systems. The chemical compositions of bio-oil from sewage sludge co-converted with lignocellulose were also analyzed [24]. The esters and phenols species contained in the bio-oil from the mixture system were more volatile than those from the individual feedstock. The possible explanation for the differences in oily compositions was related to the interaction of the formed intermediate. The phenolic components obtained from the conversion of lignin component in lignocellulose might promote the degradation of protein or its fragments in sewage sludge, while the produced intermediates from protein conversion could probably boost the lignin decomposition or condensation of phenols [86]. As for the carbon number distribution of liquid product, the relative percentage of large carbon number region in the co-liquefied bio-oil was lower compared with the individual liquefaction. This result implied that the synergistic effect from the co-liquefaction favored the formation of low-volatile components. After the co-liquefaction, the portion of chemical species larger than C20 was increased in the bio-oil, while the compounds with carbon number lower than 20 were mainly in the region between C5 and C20. Based on the thermogravimetric analysis, the results also indicated that co-liquefaction of sewage sludge with rice straw had a positive effect on the production of oily component with low molecular weight, which was attributed to the improvement in the degradation of large fragments such as lignin-derived intermediates. In conclusion, the interaction between intermediate products from the degradation of biomass as well as variation in the reactivity of different feedstocks could affect the occurrence of subsequent reaction, and accordingly change the compositions and properties of bio-oils. Additionally, the added raw materials may alter the reaction environment like solution pH, which also affects the oily constituents."
8,Mechanisms for co-liquefaction of mixed feedstocks,"Generally, the reaction mechanism of co-liquefaction of feedstocks are rather complex since the co-liquefaction undergoes multiple reactions such as substitution, oxidation, isomerization, cracking, polymerization, etc [87]. In the case of co-liquefaction of lignocellulose and microalgae, the possible formation pathways of the typical components in bio-oil were summarized in detail, as shown in Fig. 3 . Firstly, the glycerol produced from the hydrolysis of the lipid component could degrade to highly reactive aldehyde and ketones. Fatty acids were also hydrolysate of lipid, which could react with ammonia and its derivatives originated from protein conversion to form fatty amides [88]. Ammonia was obtained due to the deamination of amino acids produced from the cracking of proteins. The released ammonia or amines could react with succinic acid to form succinimides, which were further converted to pyrroles under reductive conditions. Additionally, amino acids could also combine with carbonyls to form the substituted pyrroles. Through the decarboxylation reaction, amino acids were converted into active amines. Condensation of amino acids resulted in the formation of diketopiperazines, which may be reduced to pyrazines at higher temperatures. Based on the Strecker degradation and Amadori rearrangement, the formed amine intermediates could be condensed and be further reduced to pyrazines [89,90]. Retro-aldol condensation of the sugar substrate in cellulose and hemicellulose led to the formation of small organic acids, which were further converted into acetone and small dicarboxylic acids via aldol reaction. Among these carboxylic acids, malonic acids with high reactivity could react with resorcinols to form umbelliferone derivatives. Acetone reacted with glycolic acid and lactic acid to form cyclopentanones and cyclopent-2-enones, which further reacted with ketoacids to produce indanones and indenones. Cyclic ketones could bond with ammonia derivatives to form Schiff bases, which further combined with ketoacids to produce indoles. As for glycolic acids and lactic acids, they would be reduced to glycols or condensed to oxygen-containing aromatics. The monosaccharides derived from cellulose and hemicellulose degradation could be further converted to various furans, furfurals and levulinic acid derivatives. During the co-treatment process, furans and furfurals could combine with ammonia to form 3-hydroxyprridines, and levulinic acid derivatives would bond with ammonia to generate pyrolidin-2-ones [92,93]. In terms of degradation products from lignin, the predominant compositions were oxygenated aromatics, which underwent nucleophilic attack on the phenyl ring with ammonia. Besides, along with the formation of aromatic compounds, small aldehydes and ketones were also produced, possibly involving in the formation of Schiff base. The reaction mechanisms on the co-liquefaction of organic solid wastes were also proposed by some studies. Based on the investigation from Xu et al. the role of sewage sludge ash in the generation of bio-oil from microalgae co-liquefied with sewage sludge was discussed [69]. The introduction of pyrolysis-state sewage sludge ash facilitated the conversion of intermediates derived from microalgae conversion, and further promoted the cracking of N-containing compounds to produce oligomers and ammonia. Besides, the pyrolysis-state sewage sludge ash was favorable to the hydrolysis of amides into organic acids and weakened the following conversion of acids into hydrocarbon via decarboxylation to a certain extent. In terms of co-liquefaction of sewage sludge and lignocellulose, the N-containing protein in sewage sludge could crack into NH4, which gave rise to an alkali environment [63]. Such a reaction condition enhanced the degradation of lignocellulose during the co-treatment with sewage sludge. In summary, the co-liquefaction mechanism from mixed feedstocks involves numerous complex reactions, which are commonly related to the interaction of various components. Besides, the inherent properties of raw materials also affect the conversion routes during the co-liquefaction process, resulting in the difference in oily compositions. Nevertheless, the studies on the co-liquefaction mechanism from different types of biomasses are still rather limited, and further in-depth investigations on this aspect are essential."
9,Conclusions,"The review summarizes the co-liquefaction behavior of different types of biomasses including lignocellulose, organic solid waste and algae. During the co-liquefaction process, due to the mutual interaction among the degraded fragments and intermediates derived from biomass mixture, a synergistic influence of blending biomasses on the bio-oil yield was evaluated. The existing interaction exhibits a positive or negative impact on the production of bio-oil, which is associated with the unique nature of the biomass types and processing conditions. Additionally, the important reaction parameters such as solvent and catalyst types affect the production of bio-oil as well as the interaction from biomass mixture. However, there are few studies on the role of solvent and catalyst on co-liquefaction behavior, which deserves more efforts in future work. The choice of the optimal temperature and time depends on the employed feedstock types due to their different structural characteristics. Clearly, beyond the specific point, the further increase in temperature and time can bring undesirable reactions such as secondary fragment and re-polymerization, giving rise to a decrease of bio-oil yield. The mechanism of this aspect needs further investigation. With respect to the mixing ratio, the strongest co-liquefaction effect can be achieved under the proper conditions. As for chemical components of bio-oil, the interaction of intermediate fragments would alter the oily compositions along with a series of complex reactions, which contributes to the synergistic effect that affects and quality and quantity of the formed bio-oil. The limitation for co-liquefaction of the blending biomass is the relatively fewer research studies on understanding the pathway for the co-conversion. The mutual effect from different types of feedstocks may affect the reaction routes, and further alter the composition and quality of bio-oil. Thus, to better understand the co-liquefaction mechanism for the potential cross-interaction of the reaction intermediates from different feedstocks, the exact structure of the reaction medium should be analyzed at a molecular level. This requires more advanced characterization techniques for real-monitoring the reaction progress. Alternatively, the model compound approach can be adopted to probe the interaction of the major reaction intermediates during co-liquefaction as a start for understanding the overall picture of the reaction mechanism during the co-liquefaction. The application of kinetics and statistical models are also helpful to understand the co-liquefaction mechanism. The related research on the influence of solvent and catalyst types on the co-liquefaction is limited, which require more investigations in the future. The detailed mechanisms for the interaction of the solvent with the reaction substrates and reaction mediums requires further attentions. Additionally, the most frequently used catalysts for co-liquefaction are homogeneous catalysts, which can incur a higher cost in the practical application as the catalyst cannot be recovered readily. Thus, the reusable heterogeneous catalyst for the co-liquefaction process should be developed."
