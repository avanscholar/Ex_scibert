0,Introduction,"Soy hulls, which are the seed coat of soybeans (approximately 8%), are one of the main by-products released during the initial cracking process used in soybean oil and protein production, but huge amounts of its are being left to waste now (Kim, Lee, & Kim, 2015). Recently, soy hulls have been considered as source of novel polysaccharide, since these contain about 30% pectin, 20% cellulose, and 50% hemicellulose (Gnanasambandam & Proctor, 1999). What's more, potential health benefits of soy-based foods have created a demand for more researches on the soy hull polysaccharide as food ingredients. However, the study on extraction method and characteristics on the polysaccharide from soy hulls is relatively scarce. Recently, the hot-acid method was used to extract polysaccharide from soy hulls (Kalapathy & Proctor, 2001; Monsoor & Proctor, 2001). Also, our team devoted to the study of soy hull polysaccharide, the SHSP was successfully extracted from soy hull by ammonium oxalate assisted with microwave treatment in our previous works. We also verified that the SHSP mainly consists of galactose, xylose, galacturonic acid, arabinose, rhamnose, and glucose, and found that Mg2+ can induce the gelation of polysaccharide and the junction zone of SHSP, Mg2+ and D-glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) system is maintained through hydrogen bonding (Liu, Guo, Li, Zhu, & Li, 2013). The polysaccharide is a polydisperse polymer, and different fractions of the polysaccharide may have different characteristics. Anti-solvent precipitation and alcohol precipitation method have been frequently used in the purification and fractionation of polysaccharides (Feng, Yin, Nie, Wan, & Xie, 2016; Shi et al., 2017). Plants polysaccharide are usually hetero-polysaccharide and polydisperse in molecular weight; most are composed of deoxy and hexose sugar units (Ibrahim, Osman, & Hassan, 2013; Naji-Tabasi, Razavi, Mohebbi, & Malaekeh-Nikouei, 2016). The polysaccharide can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds in an aqueous solution, and the polysaccharide molecules are linked and aggregate together (Naji-Tabasi et al., 2016). Adding ethanol to solution contain polysaccharide, polysaccharides molecules initially dehydrates, then conformation changes and aggregate, caused by the enhancement of intra-molecular hydrogen bonding (Naji-Tabasi et al., 2016), and various concentration of alcohol can precipitate polysaccharides fractions with the different molecular weight (Hu, Liu, Jin, & Tian, 2015). In this study, we want to know the properties of different fractions of soy hull polysaccharide derived from alcohol precipitation and the related mechanism. Every fraction has its advantage(s). According to a literature review, no study has yet determined the dependence of rheological and conformational properties of SHSP to M W, therefore, the purposes of this study were to characterise the physicochemical, conformation, and rheological properties of SHSP fractions obtained by gradient alcohol precipitation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Soybean hulls were obtained from Jinzhou Soybean Hull Distribution Company (Jinzhou, China), and the contents of protein, fibre, and water in the soy hulls were 12%, 34%, and 14% (w/w), respectively. All chemicals used were analytical grade or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade."
3,SHSP extraction and fractionation,"2.2 SHSP extraction and fractionation Dry soybean hulls were ground into powder (to pass a 60 mesh sieve), and SHSP was extracted by ammonium oxalate assisted with microwave radiation (Midea Corp., PJ23C-SC1, China) method, the fractionation procedure is shown in Fig. 1 . Soybean hull powder (30 g) was dispersed in water at 85 °C which containing 0.6 (%, wt) ammonium oxalate, then treated in the microwave oven at 450 W, maintained at 95 °C for 10 min. The dispersions were passed through 200 mesh filter cloth, and the pH of filtrates was reach to 4.5, centrifuged at 4500 g for 10 min (Backman, Avanti J-25, USA). After that, the supernatant was concentrated by a vacuum rotary evaporator (Shanghai Yarong, RE-3000A, China). Then adding ethanol (95%, v/v) to concentrated solution, until final ethanol contents is 20%, 40%, and 60% (v/v) respectively. After 40 min, the precipitate was centrifuged at 4500g for 30 min at 25 °C and dried in vacuum freeze-drier, resulting in SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60 fractions."
4,Moisture and protein content,"2.3 Moisture and protein content The moisture content of SHSP fractions was determined through heating sample using a fan-assisted oven at 105 °C. The protein content was evaluated by the Kjeldahl procedure (N ¼ 6.25). All measurements were performed in duplicate, except for those used to ascertain the protein content which examined in quadruplicate."
5,Carbohydrate and uronic acid,"2.4 Carbohydrate and uronic acid Total carbohydrate was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (DuBois, Gilles, Hamilton, Rebers, & Smith, 1956) at 490 nm. Uronic acid was analysed according to Blumenkrantz (Blumenkrantz & Asboe-Hansen, 1973). All measurements were carried out in duplicate."
6,Monosaccharide composition,"2.5 Monosaccharide composition Monosaccharide composition of SHSP fractions was determined by our previous method with some modifications (Liu et al., 2013). In brief, the SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60 samples were hydrolysed by trifluoroacetic acid solution (TFA, 4 mol/L) at 110 °C for 6 h in the sealed test tube. The left TFA was washed out with methanol. The solutions were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min under 4 °C. The precipitates were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 100 ml, and then diluting 10 times. The diluted solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm cellulose ester membrane. The 10 μL solutions were injected into ion chromatography apparatus (Dionex ICS5000, CA, USA)."
7,Molecular weight,"2.6 Molecular weight The molecular weight and homogeneity of SHSP fraction were measured by high-performance gel filtration chromatography (HPGFC) instrument (1525, Waters, USA) with a 2414 refractive index detector and Ultrahydrogel ™ Linear column (300 mm × 7.8 mm, Waters, USA). The mobile phase was 0.25 M NaOH solution and 1 mmol/L NaAC solution, and the flow rate was 0.9 mL/min. Samples were diluted to approximately 10 mg/mL in 0.1 mol/L NaNO3 solution with stirring. SHSP solution was filtered through a 0.22 mm filter, and then 0.2 mL of filtrate was injected into the HPGFC system. Dextran standards with average molecular weights of 1.00 × 103, 2.50 × 103, 4.11 × 104 and 1.34 × 105 Da were used to calibrate the columns which were operated at 45 °C during measurement. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), and molecular-weight dispersity (D M = Mw/Mn) were calculated using the Empower 2 software (Waters)."
8,Zeta potential measurement,"2.7 Zeta potential measurement The zeta potential (z, mV) of the SHSP solution (0.5 mg/mL) was determined as described by Anvari et al. (2015)."
9,FT-IR,"2.8 FT-IR The FT-IR spectrum of polysaccharides fractions was determined by infrared spectroscopy according to the method Wei et al. (2016). A 0.5 mg SHSP fractions mixed with KBr was tabulated and analysed by ATR-FTIR. FT-IR spectra were recorded from 500 to 4000 cm−1 in a Scimitar 2000 Near FT-IR Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA)."
10,Rheological analysis,"2.9 Rheological analysis The steady shear and dynamic viscoelasticity of SHSP fractions was determined by a stress-controlled fluids rheometer DHR-1 (TA instrument, USA) equipped with a transducer in torque-mode. The diameters and gap of the parallel plate geometry were 40 mm and 0.5 mm respectively. SHSP samples (20–40 mg/mL) were loaded on the plate, and exposed surfaces at the plate edge were covered with a thin layer of light silicone oil to prevent moisture loss during rheological testing. For steady shear measurement in our test, the shear rate was set from 0.1 to 100 s−1. Data for SHSP fractions dispersion were fitted according to the Herschel–Bulkley (HB) (Eq. (1)) and power law (Eq. (2)). (1) τ = τ y + K γ n (2) τ = K γ n Where τ is the shear stress; τ y is the yield stress; K is the consistency index (Pa·Sn); γ is the shear rate, and n is the flow behaviour index. The values of n and K were obtained by regression of the double logarithmic plot. (Jin, Zhang, Yin, & Nishinari, 2006)"
11,Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterisation,"2.10 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterisation SHSP fractions were dissolved in deionised water (0.2 mg/mL) after stirring for 12 h. Samples of SHSP fractions solution (0.2 mg/mL) were made using deionised water to 5 μg/mL, and kept at 85 °C for 10 min, then filtrated with 0.22 μm filters. 10 μL of the SHSP fractions solution (5 μg/mL) was dropped directly onto the surface of cleaved mica and dried in an enclosed Petri dish, then sealed in a desiccator for more than 24 h. Microscopy images of SHSP fractions were obtained using an XE-70 atomic force microscope (Park Systems Co., Seoul, Korea) equipped with silicon cantilevers (NSC-11, MikroMasch), and collected by using tapping AFM."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Chemical compositions and molecular weight,"3.1 Chemical compositions and molecular weight Depending on the procedure illustrated in Fig. 1, three main fractions SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60 were obtained. The yields and physicochemical properties of SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60 are summarised in Table 1 . The yield of SHSP20 was 54.5% higher than SHSP40 and SHSP60, which suggested that SHSP20 and SHSP40 were the major components of soy hull polysaccharides. What's more, protein and uronic acid was detected in all SHSP fractions, which indicated all SHSP fractions belonged to the class of acid glycoprotein compounds. Similar results were obtained in other soy polysaccharides (Furuta & Maeda, 1999) which contain about 5% protein. Among them, SHSP40 contains the highest carbohydrate content (64.57%), intermediate amounts of uronic acid and water, as well as the minimum amount of protein (1.13%). The molecular weight of the SHSP fractions is summarised in Table 1. The weight average molecular weight (M w) and number average molecular weight (M n) of SHSP40 were 381.83 and 64.77 kDa, respectively, were higher than those of SHSP20 (285.30 and 72.15 kDa) and SHSP60 (124.21 and 36.44 kDa). Furthermore, the polydispersity indices (3.41–5.90) mean that SHSP fractions produced by graded ethanol precipitation method are polydisperse aggregates. The molecular weight of each fraction was different from 542 kDa obtained by Furuta and Maeda (1999) for water-soluble soybean polysaccharides (SSPS) directly extracted from the by-product of isolated soybean protein."
14,Monosaccharide compositions,"3.2 Monosaccharide compositions Table 2 showed that eight monosaccharides were detected in SHSP fractions although the amount of glucose, xylose, and glucuronic acid was very little. The galacturonic acid and mannose are the main monosaccharide for SHSP20, which take up 47.67% and 27.38%, respectively. And the SHSP20 also contain 12.97% galactose, 6.47% arabinose, 3.69% rhamnose, 0.95% xylose, and 0.86% glucose. However, the mannose and galactose contents in SHSP40 were 61.36% and 19.13%, respectively, while no glucose was detected. The dominant monosaccharide composition of SHSP60 was identified as mannose (38.43%), followed by galactose (29.39%), and no glucose was found in the sample. The results indicated that mannose, galacturonic acid, and galactose were the major monosaccharide components of SHSP. SHSP fractions have different monosaccharide building units; all classed as heteropolysaccharides. SSPS reported in other studies consist of rhamnose, arabinose, fucose, xylose, glucose, galactose and uronic acid (Kawamura & Narasaki, 1961; Marszalek, Li, Oberhauser, & Fernandez, 2002; Morita, 1965), while the main monosaccharide and weight ratios are remarkably different. These results indicated that water-soluble soybean polysaccharides obtained from diverse origins, and extraction methods contain different monosaccharides."
15,Zeta potential,"3.3 Zeta potential Attractive and repulsive forces between colloidal particles play a significant role in the stability and physicochemical properties of the colloidal solution (Dai, Jiang, Shah, & Corke, 2017; Razavi, Cui, & Ding, 2016). The zeta potentials of solution higher than +30 mV or lower than −30 mV is considered stable since it maintained the repulsive forces between particles during dispersion (Wei et al., 2016). The SHSP20 solutions have larger absolute zeta potentials above 30 mV, indicating that the repulsive forces among droplets are higher than SHSP40 and SHSP60 (Table 1). The absolute potential of SHSP40 and SHSP60 solutions was less than 30 mV, and the solution may be less stable than SHSP20, which may have been caused by a higher neutral sugar content (neutral sugars have a poor electrical conductivity)."
16,FT-IR,"3.4 FT-IR The spectroscopic of SHSP20, SHSP40 and SHSP60 is shown in Fig. 2 . The FT-IR spectra of the three fractions were similar to each other. The intense and broad absorption peak around 3435 cm−1 was assigned to stretching vibration of -OH, and the weak band near 2930 cm−1 was belonged to the syntony of C-H of the methyl group in the sugar ring (Li, Wang, Zheng, & Li, 2017). Above absorption peaks belong to the characteristic groups of polysaccharides. The 1630 cm−1 band in all SHSP fractions indicated the existence of free carboxylate groups (Naji-Tabasi et al., 2016). The characteristic absorption peak of SHSP60 that appeared near 1734 cm−1 was associated with the stretching vibration of C=O bonds, whereas the intense band at 1400 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of C-O bonds. Also, stretching peaks between 1059 and 1149 cm−1 belongs to the vibrations of C-O-C or C-O-H group which suggested all SHSP fractions contain pyranoid ring (Li, Yang, Ma, Yan, & Guo, 2015). The three SHSP fractions showed similar characteristic absorptions of typical polysaccharides from 400 to 1400 cm−1; however, peaks between 1400 and 1800 cm−1 for SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60 were slightly different. Very prominent differences were detected in SHSP60 between 1400 and 1600 cm−1, especially with no absorption at 1450 cm−1; in addition, absorbance between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 and 1500–1600 cm−1 was associated with to Amide I (stretching vibrations of C=O and C–N) and Amide II (mainly N–H), respectively, which reveal that SHSP probably contain proteins (Guo et al., 2011; Naji-Tabasi et al., 2016). The peak intensity of SHSP20 was higher than that of SHSP40 and SHSP60 in this region, which indicated a much higher content of protein and uronic acid in SHSP20 as shown in Table 1. The weak bands near 769 cm−1 were assigned to ring stretching and ring deformation of α-D-(1–4) and α-D-(1–6) linkages (Wang & Somasundaran, 2005). These results suggest that SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60 are pectin polysaccharides containing hydroxyl, ester, amino, alkyl, ether linkages, and a D-glucopyranose ring, which may have certain rheological properties. The following determinations were carried out to characterise the properties of the various SHSP fractions."
17,Rheological analysis,"3.5 Rheological analysis The steady shear flow behaviour of SHSP20, SHSP40 and SHSP60 solution at concentrations ranging from 20 to 40 mg/mL was analysed at 25 °C. As can be seen from Fig. 3 , the apparent viscosity of all SHSP solutions was related to the concentration and shear rate, and it presented a positive change to concentration and a negative effect on the shear rate. Shear-thinning was more pronounced in the lower shear rate (0.1–1 s−1) than higher (1–100 s−1). Shear-thinning occurred by the orientation of the long polymer molecular chain of SHSP in the flow field. The randomly positioned molecules turn more aligned in the flow direction with the shear rate increase, resulting in fewer interactions between adjacent molecular chains (Qiao, Li, Chi, Ji, Gao, Hwang, et al., 2016; Yaich et al., 2014). Consequently, the apparent viscosity of SHSP20 solutions was decreased, while the rate of change in viscosity was different at diverse concentrations. The viscosity of SHSP20 solutions with high concentrations decreased faster with the increase of shear rate, while viscosity values were significantly higher than others at the same shear rate (P < 0.05). SHSP40 and SHSP60 had the similar flow characteristics (not shown). The reason for this was that there are more inter-chain interactions at higher concentrations, and the shear force will disrupt any inter-chain structures causing a decrease in viscosity to the system with the increase of shear rate (Singthong, Ningsanond, Cui, & Goff, 2005). The viscosity is primarily dependent on the molecular weight and chain stiffness of the polymer (Li et al., 2017; Naji-Tabasi et al., 2016). SHSP40 has the highest viscosity (0.37 Pa S), compare with SHSP20 (0.32 Pa S) and SHSP60 (0.22 Pa S) at 0.04 mg mL-1. The high value of viscosity for SHSP40 results in its highest molecular weight (Table 1) and compact conformation (Fig. 3). The shear-thinning behaviour of SHSP solutions was illustrated according to the power law constitutive equation (Eqns (1) and (2)). The consistency index (K), flow behaviour index (n) and regression coefficient (R 2 ) of SHSPs solutions obtained by fitting a power-law model (Eqns (1) and (2)) are presented in Table 3 . As showed in Table 3, the R 2 value was greater than 0.994 showing that the experimental data is agreement with the power-law for all the SHSPs solutions. Furthermore, SHSP solutions exhibited well-behaved non-Newtonian (pseudo-plastic) properties with a flow behaviour index (n) less than 1.0, and SHSP40 had the highest flow behaviour index (n), while SHSP60 had the lowest. Table 3 also showed that the K-value was increased for each SHSP fraction with concentration, indicating that the apparent viscosity increased with increasing concentration consistent with results in Fig. 3, and reports for other polysaccharides (Ma, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Tan, Kannan, et al., 2017; Qiao et al., 2016). K-values also demonstrated that SHSP40 has a more compact conformation, as the SHSP60 is expected for the more extended biopolymer. Shear-thinning behaviour can also be observed from the change of stress (σ) shown in Fig. 3B. The stress on SHSP solutions at different concentrations rises with the increase of shear rate, indicating that the solutions showed shear-thinning behaviour. Meanwhile, the curvature of the stress curve augment with increasing polysaccharide concentrations, suggest a strong and consolidated molecular structure (Xu, Zhang, Liu, Sun, & Wang, 2016). Moreover, pseudo-plastic properties of a liquid food can be pumped easily and impart a pleasant mouthfeel (Vardhanabhuti & Ikeda, 2006). Therefore, SHSP fractions have a possibility for applying in the food industry."
18,AFM analysis of SHSP fractions,"3.6 AFM analysis of SHSP fractions To provide direct evidence of the chain conformation of the SHSP fractions, AFM was used to observe their morphology shown in Fig. 4 . The conformation of SHSP fractions showed a significant change in size and shape at the concentration of 5 μg/mL on the mica surface, respectively. The SHSP20 composed of localised networks, tenuous wormlike strands, and a small proportion of non-uniform spherical structures (Fig. 4A). Lengths (130–710 nm), widths (39–143 nm), and height (1.8–4.9 nm) of these fibres vary, suggesting that these fibres may involve some degree of side-by-side aggregation of helices. Meanwhile, SHSP40 possessed fragmented structures and a small proportion of non-uniform spherical structures. SHSP40 comprised mostly compact and spherical particles with heights of 0.4 nm–3.1 nm, widths of 19–121 nm, and lengths of 200 nm, 142 nm, 68 nm, etc. There is a reduction in length and height of the molecular chain of SHSP40 (Fig. 4B) compared with that of SHSP20 (Fig. 4A), suggesting a more uniform structure. The reason may be SHSP20 have more uronic acid, which can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the strong electronegative oxygen atom on the carboxyl or carboxyl group of the uronic acid and the hydroxy hydrogen on the other sugar chain (Arzate-Vázquez et al., 2012; Huang, Huang, Li, & Zhang, 2009). It is also worth noting that the measured height provided a more realistic indication of molecular dimensions, although the height is generally less than the expected molecular diameter because objects may be vertically compressed by the contacting probe tip as suggested elsewhere. Fig. 4C shows that SHSP60 molecules are aggregated into flakes with heights from 1.2 to 5.6 nm and lengths of 381 nm, 458 nm, 791 nm, and many more. The aggregates of SHSP60 are bigger than these of SHSP20 and SHSP40, while the content of uronic acid is the lowest. It indicates that the significant different in the conformation of SHSP fractions may be related to monosaccharide composition and ratio, and comparable to the other findings in the literature. This observation confirmed that SHSP fractions could entangle with each other by intermolecular interaction, as a consequence, its morphology can take on many forms and may be related with the differences in monosaccharide composition and ratio."
19,Conclusion,"In the present study, three crude soy hull water-soluble polysaccharides (SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60) were successfully fractionated by gradient concentrations of ethanol. Three SHSP fractions consisted of mannose, galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, glucose, and galacturonic acid with significantly different types and ratios therein. SHSP20 exhibited the highest yield, protein content, uronic acid, absolute zeta potential, and the lowest viscosity value. SHSP40 exhibited the highest sugar content, Mw, protein content, and viscosity. Furthermore, SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60 appeared as wormlike strands, and fragmented, flaky structures, respectively. The aforementioned difference in physical properties and various morphologies suggested that the three SHSP fractions have different chain conformation. Further research is needed to evaluate the structure and conformation of SHSP20, SHSP40, and SHSP60."
