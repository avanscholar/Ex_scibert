0,Introduction,"During the last decades, considerable efforts were carried out to develop effective methods for the selective production of biofuels and value-added chemical building blocks from renewable biomass, with the aim of alleviating the increasing pressure of fossil resources (Nie et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2018). Among these important molecules, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), identified as potential internal combustion engine fuel, can be derived from platform chemical 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) through catalytic reduction approach (Liu et al., 2017; Tran et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017). Currently, catalytic processes towards DMF production are primarily performed in the H2 atmosphere with the use of a variety of bifunctional acid-metal catalysts (Goto et al., 2017; Gyngazova et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2014; Kong et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2017; Kumalaputri et al., 2014; Nishimura et al., 2014; Priecel et al., 2018; Román-Leshkov et al., 2007; Siddiqui et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015, 2016; Zhu et al., 2015). It is well known that acid sites are necessary for deoxygenation activity and active metallic centers prefer hydrogenation process. Among various reported metals, Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd, and Ru based catalysts are shown to be highly active in the hydrogenolysis reaction of HMF into DMF. CuRu/C catalyst was firstly utilized to produce DMF with a yield of 76 ∼ 79% (Román-Leshkov et al., 2007). Zhu’s group (Kong et al., 2015a, 2015b) reported that the Ni-based bifunctional catalysts, nickel nanoparticles inlaid nickel phyllosilicate (NiSi-PS) and hydrotalcite-like precursors derived Ni-Al2O3, were promising for hydrogenolysis of HMF to furanic fuels, where maximum DMF yield could reach up to above 90%. Successive study revealed that mineral-derived Cu-ZnO catalysts also afforded high yield of DMF (∼91.8%) (Zhu et al., 2015). Nishimura et al., 2014 found that carbon supported PdAu bimetallic catalysts selectively converted biomass-derived HMF to DMF under atmospheric hydrogen pressure in the presence of HCl, providing nearly 96% yield of DMF after 12 h of reaction. Though high yields of DMF could be obtained according to these literatures, classical methods for chemocatalytic synthesis of DMF are inevitably associated with the use of high purity H2. However, utilizing petroleum-derived H2 brings about several issues, such as safety, storage, solubility, and high cost. For this reason, an alternative route for the conversion of HMF to DMF through catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) has attracted a great deal of attention, in which various kinds of hydrogen donors are developed for the replacement of gaseous hydrogen. Particularly, lower alcohols (i.e., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol), formic acid, formates (potassium formate and sodium formate), and silanes (poly(methylhydrosiloxane), phenylsilane, triethylsilane, and so on), are the most used hydrogen sources in transfer hydrogenation reactions (Gilkey and Xu, 2016; Hao et al., 2016; Jae et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017a, 2017b; Li et al, 2017; Pasini et al., 2014; Scholz et al., 2014; Thananatthanachon and Rauchfuss, 2010; Valentini et al., 2018; Volkov et al., 2015; Zhang and Chen, 2017). The significant advantages of CTH employing above compounds as hydrogen sources for biomass transformation are well documented in the earlier literatures. Apparently, the application of H-donating reagents reduces the safety risk of handling high-pressure, combustible H2, remarkably increases the solubility of the hydrogen donors, and lowers cost of the experimental facilities dramatically. Generally, elevated temperatures are required with the use of lower alcohols and formic acid/formates as the hydrogen donors, which facilitate the dehydrogenation/decomposition processes to donate H2 source. For instance, Jae et al., 2013 investigated the CTH of HMF using isopropanol and observed that higher temperatures (463 K) accelerated the H2 releasing, which in turn were utilized in the upgrading of HMF into DMF with a selectivity of up to 81%. Thananatthanachon and Rauchfuss (2010) showed that heating a solution of HMF in refluxing THF with formic acid as both a hydrogen source and a deoxygenating agent over Pd/C and H2SO4 gave a good yield of DMF (>95%). In comparison, silanes can serve as efficient H-donating agents at lower temperatures even room temperature under atmospheric pressure. Of the various silanes used, poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS), identified as an inexpensive byproduct in the silicon industry, is nontoxic, safe, and air/moisture insensitive. Recently Li et al. (2017a, 2017b) developed variety of highly efficient hydrophobic Pd catalysts, such as Pd supported metal-organic frameworks, Pd/C-SO3H, and Pd/C-SO3H-TMS, to catalyze CTH of HMF at room temperature (r.t.) using PMHS as a green hydrogen donor. Whereas acidic additive chlorobenzene was essential to liberate HCl that acted as acid sites to enhance deoxygenating ability. Furthermore, hydrogen activation treatment was adopted to produce metallic center Pd0 species regarding the aforementioned hydrophobic materials, which was indispensable for the catalytic synthesis of DMF in excellent yields. Herein, we report on the room-temperature synthesis of DMF from HMF using PMHS as hydrogen donor over commercially available PdCl2 catalyst. In this novel reaction system, active Pd0 species and acid sites HCl were in situ generated in large quantity to efficiently catalyze HMF into DMF under mild conditions (at as low as room temperature). Intriguingly, the maximum yield of value-added furanic fuels was as high as ∼97% (89.7% DMF). Furthermore, plausible reaction pathway for HMF upgrading in this PdCl2-catalyzed H-transfer system was proposed in detail."

Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pd(CH3COO)2 (Pd: 46%∼48%), 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DTHF, >96%) and 5-methyl-2-furfurylalcohol (MFA, 97%) were provided from Energy Chemical Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). CH3OD was provided from Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Tetrahydrofuran (THF, AR), cyclohexane (AR), 2-butanol (AR), ethanol (AR), isopropanol (AR) and methanol (AR) were bought from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory (Guangzhou, China)."
3,Catalytic test,"2.2 Catalytic test In a typical reaction, commercial Pd salts, substrate HMF (0.5 mmol, 63 mg), solvents (4 mL) and hydrogen donors were put into a packed Ace glass tube (15 mL vol.). Then, the reaction was initiated at a designated temperature under a stirring rate of 600 rpm. After the reaction, the tube was rapidly cooled in an ice water, and the filtered mixtures were further analyzed immediately. In addition, the gaseous products of the reaction were collected for GC analysis. For catalyst regeneration, the remaining in situ formed Pd0 particles in the mixture were recovered through filtration, and successively washed with ethanol for 3 times, dried at room temperature (r.t.) under atmosphere pressure. Whereafter, certain amounts of used Pd0 and HCl was added to a packed Ace glass tube for the following recycling experiments. A schematic diagram of the experimental procedure was provided in Scheme S1 in more detail."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis The products was quantitatively analyzed on Fuli GC9790Ⅱequipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a AT·SE-54 capillary column (30.0 m × 0.32 µm × 0.25 µm) using nitrogen as the carry gas. The operating conditions were as follows: injector port temperature, 533 K; column temperature, initial temperature 323 K (4 min), gradient rate 10 K min−1, ending temperature 493 K (0.5 min), flow rate 75 mL min−1. Notably, product identities were verified by analysis of standard substances, which were further employed for building standard curves in quantitative GC analysis. To identify DTHF and 5-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-methanol (MTHM), GC-MS analysis were done on Trace GC-MS 2000 that was equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (0.25 mm internal diameter). The operating conditions for GC-MS were as follows: injector port temperature, 533 K; column temperature and initial temperature 323 K (3 min); gradient rate 10 K min−1, final temperature 503 K (5 min), flow rate 75 mL min−1. Residual HMF concentration was determined by HPLC (Shimadzu LC-20AT) fitted with a LiChrosorb® RP-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) and an UV detector at 284 nm, using methanol/water (3:7, V:V) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 with a column temperature of 308 K. The analysis of gaseous products was completed on Agilent 7890A equipped with an Agilent CP-7429 column, a FID and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The used carrier gas was helium and the column temperature was maintained at 333 K for 15.2 min for the identification of generated H2. HMF conversion (Xc), yields of main products and TOF value were calculated as follows: X c ( % ) = [ m o l o f H M F c o n v e r t e d / m o l o f H M F f e d ] × 100 Y i e l d % = m o l o f p r o d u c t s o b t a i n e d / m o l o f H M F f e d × 100 T O F ( h - 1 ) = m o l o f c o n v e r t e d H M F / ( m o l o f a c t i v e P d 0 × t ) For the analysis of palladium valences in reaction mixtures, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Kratos Ultra system using an Al Kα radiation source. The binding energy was calibrated with a C1s spectrum of 284.6 eV."
5,Results and discussion,"The catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of HMF was first performed at r.t. (298 K) in various solvents in order to evaluate solvent effect and chose the suitable one for this reaction. As shown in Table 1 , lower alcohols (polar protic solvents) exhibited higher efficiencies in HMF-to-DMF transformation (Table 1, entries 1–4), while aprotic solvents such as THF and cyclohexane gave very low conversions under the identical condition (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). It is suggested that polar protic alcohols bearing lone pair electrons functioned as both H-bond acceptor and H-bond donor, which efficiently facilitated the liberation of active species hydride H− from PHMS via nucleophilic addition reaction to promote the hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation transformation THF belonged to polar aprotic solvent and served only as H-bond acceptor, while cyclohexane was classified as apolar aprotic solvent that could not be regarded as H-bond acceptor/donor. Meanwhile, plenty of active acid species HCl in situ liberated from PMHS and PdCl2 in alcoholic solvents would contribute to the followed deoxygenation process. Furthermore, it is clear seen that secondary alcohols showed moderate activity in yielding DMF compared to primary alcohols, probably owing to relatively higher steric hindrance. The lower DMF yield obtained in methanol could be ascribed to the successive transformation of a portion of produced DMF into DTHF. The best results were observed in ethanol (GC diagram, Fig. S1), in which 51.0% DMF yield was obtained at a conversion of 80.1% (Table 1, entry 2). In addition, higher TOF at 8.01 h−1 could be achieved in an ethanol medium, while aprotic solvents gave very low TOF values of the reaction. Therefore, in view of the cost, solvent source and products isolation, relatively low boiling points, inexpensive biomass derived ethanol was used as the solvent for further experiments. With the in-depth study, XPS characterization was undertaken immediately for the collected black solid samples to identify the Pd valences in the reaction mixtures. As depicted in Fig. 1 , the peaks located at the binding energies of 334.9 and 340.2 eV were clearly assigned as Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 respectively, demonstrating the presence of a reduction state of Pd0 species (Friberg et al., 2018; Venezia et al., 2001). Also, Scheme S1 revealed that the color of catalyst changed from brown to black color after reacting for only a few minutes, which further confirmed the variation of Pd valences in the reaction. Thus Pd0 species served as active metal sites could be in situ generated easily during the proceeding of the transfer hydrogenation reaction, which subsequently participated in the conversion of HMF into DMF. In addition, we further investigated the influence of various Pd salts in the reduction reaction of HMF with PMHS in ethanol. It is observable that moderate to very low yields of DMF were attained in the deoxygenation reaction catalyzed by PdSO4, Pd(NO3)2, Pd(CH3COO)2 and Pd(CF3COO)2 (Table 2 , entries 1–4), presumably because that in situ formed corresponding acidic compounds were ineffective in deoxygenation process as compared to HCl (Ronald and Maleczka, 2011). To verify this speculation, certain amounts of PdCl2 were added into the Pd(CH3COO)2-catalyzed system in the premise of ensuring the same Pd loading (Table 2, entry 5). As expected, DMF yield was enhanced significantly in the presence of 25 mol% of PdCl2. On the other hand, 0.1 mmol HCl was added into the Pd(CH3COO)2-catalyzed system to verify the importance of Cl (Table 2, entry 6). The result demonstrated that in situ formed acid site HCl played an important role in the reaction, which helped to promote the conversion and significantly raise the TOF value. On the other hand, it is inferred that metal chlorides might positively alter the reactivity of the polysiloxane matrix in some other way (Boukherroub et al., 1996). After the screening of Pd source, PdCl2 proved to be the best choice for this reaction, giving a satisfactory DMF yield of 51.0% (Table 2, entry 7). Besides, other noble metals such as RuCl3 and H2PtCl6 were observed to show much lower activity towards HMF-to-DMF in this catalytic system (Table 2, entries 8 and 9). Given that PdCl2 worked well for the transformation, various PdCl2 dosages were subjected to the reaction. At a lower amount of 0.05 mmol PdCl2, only 18.5% DMF was produced due to the insufficient active metal centers (Table 2, entry 10). Fairly good results were obtained with usage ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 mmol, as indicated in Table 2 (entries 7, 11 and 12). It is inferred that large number of active Pd0 sites and deoxygenation promoter HCl were obtained upon higher PdCl2 dosage, which were conducive to increasing the conversion efficiencies. A good yield of DMF up to 63.2% was observed at a dosage of 0.15 mmol, along with 7.5% yield of DTHF obtained (Table 2, entry 11). It is worth to note that TOF values were slightly lowered for higher catalyst dosages, resulting from that much more active Pd0 were available upon per amount of HMF. Furthermore, contrast experiment had been carried out with the use of atmospheric H2 as the hydrogen donor. As indicated in Table 2 (entry 24), almost no DMF was found after the reaction. It is inferred that no active metallic site Pd0 was generated at room temperature under atmospheric H2. On the other hand, active acid sites would not be formed in this catalytic system, while using PHMS as the hydrogen donor facilitated the formation of acid site HCl. Thus, substrate HMF could not be efficiently converted into DMF at room temperature and pressure under H2 atmosphere. Subsequently, a series of aliphatic and aromatic silanes were evaluated as hydride donors for this transformation. The reactions carried out with aromatic silanes provided inferior results and produced the deoxygenated product of DMF in ∼30% yield (Table 2, entries 10–12). METH without SiH group did not participate in this reaction (Table 2, entry 13). In the case of TMDA, almost no reaction was observed under the reaction condition. This was probably ascribable to the lower reactivity in donating hydride species that limited the HMF-to-DMF conversion (Table 2, entry 14). Similarly, TES containing only one Si–H group in a molecule revealed rather low ability to produce DMF (Table 2, entry 15). It is clear that poor conversion rates resulted in undesirable TOF values after employing above silanes as H-donors. By contrast, PMHS containing much more active SiH groups was the best hydrogen source for this reaction, affording the maximum DMF yield of 89.7% at a usage of 3 mmol (Table 2, entry 19). Notably, H2 molecule was also detected out after the transfer hydrogenation reaction. Apart from the outstanding activity of PMHS, comparative advantages such as non-toxic, low cost and readily available made it more suitable for the following scale-up experiments. To further investigate the potential relationship among metallic Pd centers, hydrogen donor and activity, mole ratio of Pd/H− vs DMF yield was plotted based on the experimental results from Table 2. As shown in Fig. 2 , the selective hydrodeoxygenation of HMF into DMF largely depended on the variation of mole ratio of active Pd centers to hydride H− species, wherein crucial hydrogenation and deoxygenation steps could be controlled in a certain degree. Generally, lower Pd/H− mole ratio meant the presence of insufficient Pd0 sites and/or excess H-donors, resulting in an imbalance conversion to give an unsatisfactory yield towards DMF. Gratifyingly, the reactions performed with appropriate Pd/H− of ∼0.015 were much more efficient that rendered DMF in good to excellent yields. However, it is clear seen that performing the reactions with higher Pd/H− mole ratios appeared to have adverse effect in DMF formation. Notably, with the same Pd/H− mole ratio, relatively good yields were attained as a result of high dosage of active Pd and H− centers (points A and C), in comparison with that obtained within lower dosages (points B and D). The influences of reaction temperature and time were subsequently surveyed to determine the optimal conditions for producing DMF in quantity. As depicted in Fig. 3 (A), the temperature was found to play a critical role in HMF-to-DMF via PdCl2-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation. Interestingly, full HMF conversion could be easily achieved at a temperature as low as room temperature, and DMF as major product was produced in a high yield of 89.7% as well. With the increase of reaction temperature, byproducts such as DTHF, HD and EL with an overall yield of around 15% were inevitably generated in the course of the reaction. Thus, the PdCl2-catalyzed HMF-to-DMF procedure with PHMS as hydrogen donor could be absolutely well performed under room temperature, from the perspectives of efficiency and energy consumption. Fig. 3(B) describes the effect of reaction time on HMF hydrodeoxygenation. In the initial stage, PdCl2 first reacted with PMHS in ethanol to provide active metal centers and hydrogen source for subsequently converting HMF to DMF. Therefore, only 54.5% HMF was transformed in 0.25 h, along with 3.7% intermediate MFA and trace amount of MFF produced. GC-MS analysis verified the formation of slight amount of MTHM during the reaction, which might be suggested as the hydrogenation product of MFA (Fig. S2). A significant rise in DMF yield from 34.4% to 89.7% was observed with the increase in the time from 0.25 h to 0.5 h. Further extending reaction time from 0.5 h to 1 h led to a slight decrease in DMF yield, which was elucidated as subsequent hydrogenolysis of DMF to produce ∼10% DTHF and the formation of various ring-opening products such as EL and HD. It is noticeable that another important liquid fuel DTHF was always generated in any cases. We reasoned that DTHF was more likely to be originated from DMF in such a reaction system comprised of in situ generated metal center Pd0, acidic HCl and hydrogen molecule. To further examine the stability and reusability of catalyst, recycling experiments on the HMF hydrodeoxygenation were carried out with recovered Pd0 powder and fresh HCl using PMHS as hydrogen source under given conditions. First, used Pd0 powder was directly applied for the recycling experiment without the addition of fresh HCl (Table 2, entry 25), and only 11.8% DMF was achieved in 0.25 h. The result further confirmed that acid site HCl was indispensable for the conversion of HMF into DMF. After adding 0.15 mmol HCl to the reaction system, to our delight, the DMF yield was promoted to 32.3% (Fig. 4 ) that could be ascribed to the enhanced deoxygenation ability in the presence of acid sites. It is worth noting that poor DMF yields of 5.1% and 17.3% were obtained when using HNO3 and H2SO4 as proton sources respectively under identical reaction conditions. In the following cycles, the recovered Pd0 and added HCl were found to show good catalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation of HMF into DMF. Nearly 51% HMF conversion rate and ∼33% DMF still could be attained even after six runs, demonstrating that this catalytic system comprised of recovered Pd0 and fresh HCl was a promising choice for the selective transformation of HMF into DMF in alcohols solvent, using PMHS as the hydrogen source. Substrate screening was carried out with 0.15 mmol of PdCl2 and 10.8 equiv. H− of PMHS in ethanol at designated time and temperature. As shown in Fig. 5 , MFF and MFA regarded as reaction intermediates could be converted into DMF in quantity (>80%) at room temperature. However, sugars including fructose, sucrose, glucose and inulin were found to show inferior reactivity for one-pot synthesis of DMF at room temperature, and ultimately less than 10% yield was afforded. As is known that sugars-to-HMF was a crucial step for the following conversion, in which both acid sites and elevated temperatures were indispensable for achieving high-efficiency dehydration process. Hence, with the sugar compounds as substrates, the one-pot reactions for DMF synthesis were conducted at 393 K for 2.5 h. As seen from Fig. 5(B), raising the temperature led to a significant rise in DMF yield from sugars. Particularly, the production of DMF in a good yield up to 87.7% from fructose was achieved from this one-pot transformation. Other aldoses containing fructose unit like inulin and sucrose also gave a high DMF yield in 68–82%. Using cellulose as the reactant, only trace amount of DMF (below 3%) was attained at 393 K, which was mainly attributed to the robust crystalline structure and insufficient Brønsted/Lewis acids. Ketoses such as glucose also exhibited a little lower reactivity under the similar conditions, as a result, only around 41% DMF was attained from glucose. As stated in earlier literatures, glucose-to-fructose isomerization was a prerequisite of the follow-up dehydration process that largely depended on the characteristics of active acid sites (Drabo and Delidovich, 2018; Guo et al., 2017; Oozeerally et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). In this reaction, in situ formed Brønsted acid HCl contributed to the glucose isomerization in a certain degree, while Lewis acids were more prone to accelerating this procedure comparatively. In view of this point, moderate amount of AlCl3 was tentatively added into the system. Remarkably, DMF yield increased from 41% to 53.1% after adding Lewis acids. Upon this important finding, elaborate work on the promotional role of Lewis acids in this catalytic system are still going on. In addition, the catalytic results from this work and some previously reports were summarized and analyzed comprehensively. As listed in Table S1, performing HMF hydrodeoxygenation in a pressurized H2 atmosphere resulted in a satisfactory yield of furanic chemicals (DMF and DTHF) ranging from 81% to 96%. However, much high temperature and/or longer time were required to achieve this desirable efficiency. Notably, reaction temperature as low as 333 K was favorable for the effective transformation of biomass derived HMF into DMF over bimetallic Pd-Au catalysts in the present of acid site HCl (Table S1, entry 9) (Nishimura et al., 2014). Li et al. (2017a, 2017b) utilized various pre-reduced Pd catalysts to catalyze HMF hydrodeoxygenation in mild conditions with PMHS as hydrogen donor. For this reaction, chlorobenzene acted as a precursor for releasing HCl to facilitate deoxygenation (Table S1, entry 10). In the present work, 84.1% DMF still could be achieved in 0.5 h when raising HMF amount to 1.0 mmol (Table S1, entry 12). To further increase HMF amount to 2.0 mmol, good DMF yield of 78.7% still was attained after the reaction (Table S1, entry 13). Therefore the simple PdCl2-PMHS-ethanol system in our research presented promising performance in HMF-to-DMF under mild conditions. A plausible pathway for the hydrodeoxygenation of HMF was proposed (Scheme 1 ), in which PMHS first reacted with PdCl2 in ethanol to provide hydrogen molecule, acid sites, and active Pd0 centers. Particularly, the formation of Si-OEt bonds was verified from GC-MS analysis (Fig. S2-1). Whereafter, deoxygenation of hydroxyl group in HMF took place to give MFF in the presence of active acid sites and metal centers. In addition to deoxygenation into MFF, a trace of EL also was obtained from HMF as a result of acid-promoted ethanolysis reaction, as confirmed by the above experiments. MFF subsequently was hydrogenated into MFA under the effect of metal centers, followed by the deoxygenation into DMF. Notably, both MFF and MFA could be detected out in a small amount after the reaction (Table 1), and further activity tests in Fig. 5 also revealed that these two compounds were transformed into DMF in quantity. Accordingly, it is inferred that both MFF and MFA served as the intermediates for the formation of DMF in PdCl2-PMHS-ethanol system. Besides, deuterium-labeling experiment was conducted with the use of pure CH3OD as reaction solvent. It is observed that H/D exchange took place in CH3OD (Fig. S3), hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl of the alcohols solvent also participated in the H-transfer process. As the reaction progressed, a small number of produced DMF would be hydrogenated into DTHF in the in situ formed hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Interestingly, MTHM was identified as an intermediate in the DTHF generation that could be verified from the experiments and mass fragmentation of GC-MS. On the other hand, HD was inevitably formed as an acid-catalyzed ring-opening product from MFA and/or DMF."
6,Conclusions,"We have presented a simple, convenient and highly efficient method for the hydrodeoxygenation of HMF into liquid fuel DMF at a temperature as low as room temperature, catalyzed by commercially available Pd salts, and using silanes as reducing agents. Non-toxic, low cost and readily available PMHS, together with the use of PdCl2 as metal catalyst, was demonstrated to be much more efficient for this reaction, in which hydrogen molecule, acid site HCl and Pd0 species were in situ generated in quantity to facilitate the proceeding of hydrodeoxygenation. Hydrogenation and deoxygenation steps played a crucial role in HMF-to-DMF, which were largely dependent on the mole ratio of Pd/H−. Substrate expand studies revealed that one-pot conversion of biomass related sugars into DMF also could be realized in this catalytic system. The recovery and reutilizations in successive reactions suggested that the recovered Pd0 and added HCl were also active in DMF production. The research thus highlights a new direction for a simple, green, and efficient hydrodeoxygenation process regarding biomass upgrading under mild conditions, using a readily available and inexpensive catalytic system composed of PdCl2-PMHS-ethanol, but without any external hydrogen supplies and pre-reduction treatments."
