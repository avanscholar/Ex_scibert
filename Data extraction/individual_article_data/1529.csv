0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has a super high energy density of 140 MJ/kg, and is considered to a potential clean chemical fuel [1]. Photochemical decomposition of water for hydrogen production is one of the most attractive methods for renewable energy applications [2,3]. So far, semiconductor photocatalyst have made considerable achievements in the production of hydrogen by water splitting [4]. Clearly, precious metals, such as platinum, are widely used as cathode materials for hydrogen production due to their high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the scarcity and expensive cost of platinum impedes its large-scale application [5]. Therefore, the substitution of abundant cheap elements for platinum is of great practical significance. Researchers are committed to developing non noble metal catalysts. Many studies have been directed to layered transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as WS2, MoS2, MoSe2 and WSe2, whose edge sites have performed excellent catalytic activity toward HER [6–11]. On the other hand, metal phosphides and their alloys such as CoS2, NiS2, CoSe2, NiSe and CoPS have become another kind of excellent HER catalysts [12–22]. In particular, CoS2 can transfer electrons rapidly and have high conductivity due to its intrinsic gold properties [23–25]. Ramakrishna et al. Prepared CoS2 nanosheets combined with graphene and carbon nanotubes to form a three-dimensional flexible film without binders. At 10 mA/cm2 [26], HER activity was excellent and overpotential was low (142 mV). A series of pyrite films containing FeS2, CoS2 and their alloys were prepared by electron beam evaporation. The results show that when the overpotential is 192 mV, CoS2 can reach the current density of 10 mA/cm2. For CoPS nanosheets, the overpotential of 48 mV is needed to obtain the current density [27] of 10 mA/cm2. Ternary metal sulfide, such as CuCo2S4 and NiCo2S4, had been used as active electrode materials for energy storage, but few reports have been reported on HER [28,29]. As far as we know, HER catalysts based on Cu2MoS4, NiCo2S4, NixMn1−xCO3(x = 0.20, 0.25, 0.33) and Ni0.33Co0.67S2 had recently been reported [30–34]. The reported results show that the HER activity of bimetallic Ni0.33Co0.67S2 is significantly higher than that of single cobalt-based or nickel-based sulfide catalyst [35]. Metal tungstate exhibits excellent physical and chemical properties due to its layered structure and spined exciton [36]. Among all tungstates, layered monoclinic wolframite-structured cadmium tungstate (CdWO4) is considered as a potential material due to its optical, chemical, structural properties and thermal stability. Because of the wide band gap of CdWO4, it is only used in the ultraviolet region. There are few reports on the use of CdWO4 [37,38] doping for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The CdWO4 nanostructures doped herein have better photocatalytic activity. Herein, we have synthesized CdWO4 nanorods with CoNi2S4 nanoparticles by two-step hydrothermal method. The CoNi2S4 cluster spheres with controllable morphology were synthesized with the aid of TBA molecule. In this paper, CdWO4 nanorods and CoNi2S4 nanoparticles with more active sites were applied to HER for the first time. By adjusting the mass ratio between them, the photocatalyst CNS/CW-3 with the best catalytic activity was obtained."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium tungstate dehydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O, 99.5%), cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 99%), cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.99%), nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), thiourea (CH4N2S, 99%), ammonium (25–28%) and tert butyl alcohol (TBA, 99%) used without any further purification."
3,Synthesis of CdWO4,"2.2 Synthesis of CdWO4 Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (2.5 mmol) and Na2WO4·2H2O (2.5 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (25 mL) named A and B, respectively. The solution B was poured into solution A and dissolved it into a uniform solution for 30 min. After stirring for 2 h, the prepared reacted under the condition of 180 °C for 24 h in a 100 mL of Teflon-lined autoclave. And then, when the mixture cooled down, the product was washed by ethanol and water for 3 times, following dried at 60 °C for 3 h."
4,Fabrication of the CoNi2S4/CdWO4 composites,"2.3 Fabrication of the CoNi2S4/CdWO4 composites The synthesis of CoNi2S4 was based on the previously reported method and slightly modified [34]. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.28 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.56 mmol) and CH4N2S (2.52 mmol) were dissolved in 60 mL deionized water and 15 mL TBA. Then 1 mL of ammonium were added and the mixture was evenly dispersed in ultrasound. After mixing 1 h, added 85 mg CdWO4 and stirring 2 h. Transferring the mixture to 100 mL Teflon lined autoclave. Solvothermal reaction lasted 12 h at 180 °C, then cooled to room temperature. Black precipitate was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and dried for 5 h at 60 °C. The synthesized samples of CoNi2S4/CdWO4 with 10, 18, 20, 22 and 25 wt% were named CNS/CW-1, CNS/CW-2, CNS/CW-3, CNS/CW-4 and CNS/CW-5, respectively. The synthesis of CoNi2S4 was similar to that of the above binary substances without CdWO4. A schematic representation of the material preparation process was shown in Scheme 1 ."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations The crystal structure after Cu Kα irradiation was analyzed by XRD (Rigaku Smartlab). The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were studied by UV-2550 ultraviolet spectrophotometer with reference to barium sulfate. In-depth characterization was performed using a tungsten filament scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS EVO 18) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms (ASAP 2020 M) of the samples were determined and analyzed by the BET equation. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 470 nm."
6,Photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen experiment,"2.5 Photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen experiment Photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen was carried out in a flat-bottomed quartz bottle (65 mL) using a white light lamp under magnetic stirring (PCX50B Discover 5 W). In a typical step, 10 mg photocatalyst and 20 mg eosin (EY) powder were suspended in 30 mL 10% (v/v) triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution as electron sacrificial agent and dispersed for 15 min to form a uniform solution. Under anaerobic conditions, put the N2 bubbles for 30 min to remove air from the reaction bottle. Hydrogen precipitation was determined by gas chromatography (SP2100, N2 as carrier). All glassware was carefully washed with strict cleaning and distilled water before use."

Secondly, the ITO glass (1 × 2 cm2) was treated with ultrasonic cleaning agent (isopropanol, acetone solution, ethanol and water). After drying, 30 μL CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3 suspensions were uniformly dripped into the conductive region of about 1 × 1 cm2 by a pipette gun, and the working electrodes of the samples were prepared. Subsequently, the electrodes were dried at room temperature for 24 h, and electrochemical workstations (CHI 660D) were used to test the photoelectrochemistry (IT, LSV and EIS). The reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode, and the platinum electrode was the opposite electrode. The photocathode was the working electrode, and the electrolyte was 0.2 mol·L−1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution. In addition, the light source was 300 W xenon lamp. The photocurrent response was measured at fixed bias of 0.5 V and Ag/AgCl [39]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts 3.1.1 XRD studies Fig. 1a showed the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3 photocatalysts. Six main characteristic peaks can be obviously observed in the XRD data of pure CdWO4 at 23.27°, 28.99°, 29.55°, 30.51°, 35.37° and 35.68° corresponding to the (110), (−111), (111), (020), (002) and (200) diffraction plane of the monoclinic crystal CdWO4 (PDF#14-0676), respectively. Furthermore, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 26.67°, 31.47°, 38.17° 50.26° and 55.01°, which were indexed as cubic (PDF#24-0334) and corresponded to (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) crystal faces of CoNi2S4 (PDF#24-0334), respectively [11]. There was no significant change of the X-ray diffraction peaks of CNS/CW-3 when CoNi2S4 was loaded on CdWO4. According to Scheller's formula, the particle sizes of CdWO4 on (−111) and CoNi2S4 on (311) were 49.93 nm and 46.35 nm, respectively. Fig. 1b showed the weight ratio of CNS/CW-x. The activity of catalyst for hydrogen production was determined. The results in the photocatalytic hydrogen production test section showed that the catalyst activity was best when the weight ratio was 20% (CNS/CW-3) (Fig. 7b). And Fig. 1b also showed that the weight ratio of CoNi2S4 had no influence on its phase structure. 3.1.2 Phase structure and morphology Fig. 2a-c showed the SEM images of CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3 photocatalysts. It can be seen that CdWO4 had clear short rod shape and was very uniform. The CoNi2S4 showed a typical spherical shape by small nanoparticles under the control of TBA. The CNS/CW-3 sample had a typical short rod-like morphology attached to the sphere, and the distribution of the attached CdWO4 was more uniform. The TEM image (Fig. 2d) further showed CNS/CW-3 aggregated spheres with short rod-like structures. Fig. 2e showed the HRTEM image of CNS/CW-3, which clearly showed the existence of two different types of lattice fringes associated with CdWO4 and CoNi2S4, respectively. The lattice spacing of 0.556 nm corresponded to the pure monoclinic (010) plane of CdWO4 with wolframite structure, and that of 0.257 nm and 0.544 nm corresponded to the (400) and (111) plane of cubic CoNi2S4. In-situ crystallization on the surface of CNS/CW-3 formed a close contact interface between CdWO4 and CoNi2S4, which was conducive to charge transfer. It can be observed from Fig. 2f that the elements of Co, Ni, S, Cd, W and O can coexisted in this complex. It also showed that CNS/CW-3 composite catalyst had been successfully synthesized. 3.1.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The chemical valence and composition of CNS/CW-3 composites were determined by XPS. Wide-scan XPS spectra of the samples were given in Fig. 3a, showing the presence of Co, Ni, S, O, W and Cd elements. In Fig. 3b, the Ni 2p spectrum can be matched with two spin orbit binaries and two vibration satellites. For the Ni 2p spectrum, the binding energies at the first dipole were about 852.89 and 873.31 eV corresponding to Ni2+, while those at the second dipole were about 856.07 and 874.17 eV corresponding to Ni3+. With regard to the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3c), the fitting peaks of the first dipole near 778.38 and 793.48 eV were attributed to Co3+, and the fitting peaks of the second dipole near 780.77 and 797.34 eV corresponded to the spin orbital characteristics of Co2+ [40]. The S 2p spectrum (Fig. 3f) was fitted to two peaks and one vibration satellite peak. Accordingly, the peak value of 162.32 eV was attributed to negative charge S− (Fig. 3f) [41]. The peak was 161.4 eV corresponding to S 2p3/2, and its value was S2−. The Fig. 3d, e and g, O 1s, Cd 3d and W 4f indicated the existence of CdWO4. The O 1s peak shown in Fig. 3d was located at 531.33 eV, which can be attributed to lattice oxygen in CdWO4 [42]. In addition, in Fig. 3e, the peak values of Cd 3d were 411.86 and 405.09 eV, which were attributed to Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 [44]. The spectra of W 4f (Fig. 3g) showed two peaks at 35.50 and 37.58 eV, which matched W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, and were consistent with W6+ ions in CdWO4 [32]. 3.1.4 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra Fig. 4a showed the ultraviolet-diffuse reflectance spectra of CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3. Pure CdWO4 had significant optical absorption in the ultraviolet region because of its wide band gap. Pure CoNi2S4 had good absorption properties in both ultraviolet and visible regions. Compared with pure CdWO4, CNS/CW-3 composites had better absorption properties. According to Eg = 1240/λ formula [45], the Eg of pure CdWO4 was 3.29 eV, and that Eg of CNS/CW-3 was 3.36 eV, as it shown in Fig. 4b and c. The results showed that the absorption of CNS/CW-3 composite photocatalyst can be improved by introducing CoNi2S4 into CdWO4. The introduction of CoNi2S4 also had a great influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 3.1.5 Photoluminescence (PL) analysis Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) can reveal the recombination process of photogenerated carriers between semiconductor materials more clearly. Generally speaking, the better photocatalytic activity of the catalyst, the lower the PL intensity, and the lower the composite efficiency of the photogenic carrier. Fig. 5 showed PL spectra of CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3 composites at 470 nm excitation wavelength. Compared with the original CdWO4, the PL peak of CNS/CW-3 composites did not shift. The PL peak strength of CNS/CW-3 composite was the lowest, which indicated that CNS/CW-3 composite had excellent fluorescence quenching effect. Coupling with CdWO4 and CoNi2S4 can reduced the recombination efficiency, improved the transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers and improved the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor materials. Therefore, the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the controllable flower-shaped spherical photocatalyst was the best."
10,BET characterization,"3.2 BET characterization Fig. 6 showed the adsorption and desorption isotherms of unitary and binary photocatalysts synthesized by hydrothermal method. The three adsorption isotherms were concave in the whole range and belonged to the typical type IV isotherms with H3 typical hysteresis loop [39]. The SBET of CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3 was 14.16, 12.19 and 29.29 m2/g, respectively. From the corresponding pore size distribution shown in Table 1 , it can be seen that all three samples showed mesoporous structure. At the same time, compared with CdWO4 and CoNi2S4, CNS/CW-3 had larger specific surface area (29.29 m2/g), pore volume (0.09 cm3/g) and pore diameter (11.34 nm), and the large specific surface area can provided more active sites to promote the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. It indicated that the combination of CdWO4 and CoNi2S4 was more conducive to catalytic reaction."
11,Photocatalytic activities over eosin Y-sensitized CNS/CW-3 for H2 evolution,"3.3 Photocatalytic activities over eosin Y-sensitized CNS/CW-3 for H2 evolution In order to illustrate the photocatalytic effect of flower spherical photocatalyst, the photocatalytic hydrogen production of prepared samples was determined in 10 vol% TEOA solution under simulated solar irradiation. It was noteworthy that pure CdWO4 and CoNi2S4 exhibited relatively low photocatalytic hydrogen production of 1.2 μmol and 78.14 μmol in 5 h photocatalytic reactions as shown in Fig. 7a. In contrast, the hydrogen production activity of CNS/CW-3 was as high as 269.08 μmol, 224 times and 3 times higher than that of CdWO4 and CoNi2S4, respectively. This was because a good synergistic effect was formed between CdWO4 and CoNi2S4, thus promoting the photocatalytic activity of CNS/CW-3. In addition, CNS/CW-x samples were optimized under the same experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 7b, the photocatalytic activity of CNS/CW samples first increased and then decreased with the increase of the added mass of CoNi2S4. With the increase of the quality of CoNi2S4, the increase of photocatalytic activity was due to the good synergistic effect between CoNi2S4 and CdWO4. However, excessive CoNi2S4 resulted in a decrease in photocatalytic activity (from 269.08 μmol to 147.36 μmol). This was due to the fact that excessive CoNi2S4 masked certain active sites. According to the experimental data of hydrogen production driven by simulated solar energy, it can be seen that the photocatalytic activity of CNS/CW-3 photocatalyst was the best. In addition, the hydrogen production activities of the composite catalysts were compared with those of other CdWO4-based photocatalysts, as shown in Table 2 ."
12,Optimizing photocatalytic hydrogen production and stability test of photocatalyst,"3.4 Optimizing photocatalytic hydrogen production and stability test of photocatalyst In order to further studied the photocatalytic activity of composite catalyst CNS/CW-3, we also adjusted the pH of 10 vol% TEOA and added EY of different quality. In Fig. 8a, the photocatalytic activity of the composite catalyst CNS/CW-3 showed an inverted V shape in the range of pH 8–12. At pH 10, the highest hydrogen production reached 269.08 μmol and the hydrogen production of photocatalyst was unfavorable under the condition of excessive alkali and weak alkali. When the reaction system was strongly alkaline, the lower the H+ concentration, the smaller the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen evolution and the lower the photocatalytic activity [46]. In addition, pH also affected the adsorption capacity of EY on CNS/CW-3 photocatalyst. From the reaction results, it can be seen that EY can effectively adsorbed dyes on CNS/CW-3 photocatalyst at pH 10. The Fig. 8b showed the effect of EY concentration on photocatalytic activity. When the mass of EY was <20 mg, the hydrogen production of CNS/CW-3 system increased with the increase of the mass of EY. However, when the mass of EY was >20 mg, the hydrogen production decreased. These phenomena might be due to the shielding effect of free dyes. In the case of less EY, the amount of dyes adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface also increased, which was conducive to providing the absorption efficiency of dyes on the photocatalyst surface and accelerating the injection of photogenerated electrons on the semiconductor surface. On the contrary, when EY was added too much, the number of photons irradiated on the surface of photocatalyst decreased and the free state EY in the system was stimulated, so that it absorbed most of the incident photons, thus reducing the transfer rate of photogenerated electrons and limiting the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency [47]. The photocatalytic stability of CNS/CW-3 for hydrogen evolution reaction was evaluated under visible light irradiation with 10 vol% TEOA aqueous solution as sacrificial agent. As it is shown in Fig. 8c, the photocatalytic activity of CNS/CW-3 in the first cycle was 269.08 μmol. The photocatalytic activity of CNS/CW-3 decreased to 205.82 μmol in the third cycle. After the stability test of photocatalyst after 15 h, there were two possible reasons for the decrease of hydrogen production: the degradation of sensitizer EY after a long time of illumination, and the centrifugal collection before the second and third cycles, in which the loss of catalyst occurred. In addition, the stability of pure CoNi2S4 was tested. After 15 h of irradiation, the activity of single catalyst did not change significantly. It was also proved that the addition of CoNi2S4 to CdWO4 significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the composite photocatalyst. Fig. 8d showed the XRD spectra of the before reaction samples and those of the after reaction samples. As it can be seen from Fig. 8d, the two spectra were basically the same, which indicated that CCS/CW-3 had no phase change after cyclic experiment. All the above results indicated that CCS/CW-3 composite catalyst was a photocatalytic catalyst with high photocatalytic stability. In addition, we also conducted a dark state experiment. In the absence of light, the composite photocatalyst CNS/CW-3 did not produce hydrogen, indicating that it was carried out by photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen instead of chemical reaction."
13,Electrochemical analysis,"3.5 Electrochemical analysis Transient photocurrent measurements of CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3 samples showed that CNS/CW-3 exhibited a sensitive photocurrent response during several periods of intermittent switch exposure under visible light. As it shown in Fig. 9a, the photocurrent intensity of the three samples corresponded to the trend of their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Among the three samples, the photocurrent intensity of CNS/CW-3 under visible light increased significantly, which reflected that CNS/CW-3 composite catalyst had better visible light response and more effective photo-induced charge separation. The above results showed that CNS/CW-3 had good photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. In addition, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity of CdWO4, CoNi2S4 and CNS/CW-3 electrode were determined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). As shown in Fig. 9b, even at a high potential, the cathode current of the unsampled ITO electrode when water was reduced to H2 was extremely low, while the cathode current of the CNS/CW-3 electrode increased at the same potential. The high current density and low overpotential of CNS/CW-3 electrodes clearly indicated that CNS/CW-3 accelerated electron migration [43] compared with the other two samples. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a very effective method to reflect the charge transfer rate of the catalyst electrode. Fig. 9c was an impedance map of samples CdWO4, CoNi2S4, and CNS/CW-3. It is well known that the diameter of the semicircle in the EIS Nyquist corresponds to the impedance of the electrode, and the larger the diameter, the greater the impedance. The trend of CdWO4 > CoNi2S4 > CNS/CW-3 for all samples were shown in Fig. 9c, demonstrating the highest impedance of the CdWO4 electrode. The impedance of the CNS/CW-3 electrode was the smallest, indicating that the electron transfer rate of the catalyst CNS/CW-3 electrode was the fastest. These results were consistent with the above test results, and it was also proved that CoNi2S4 can accelerate the charge transfer of CdWO4."
14,The mechanism for H2 evolution,"3.6 The mechanism for H2 evolution Based on the above research, the possible mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production in EY sensitized system was speculated, as shown in Scheme. 2 . The TEOA was used as electron sacrificial agent and dye EY as sensitizer in this system. Under the control of TBA, the spherical photocatalyst (CoNi2S4) had a larger specific surface area and provided more active sites and had a good electronic transmission performance. The CdWO4 with short rod grew uniformly on the spherical CoNi2S4, which further increased the specific surface area of the composite photocatalyst. A good synergy between CoNi2S4 and CdWO4 promoted the transfer of photogenerated electrons and further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. The composite photocatalyst CNS/CW-3 with large specific surface area adsorbed a large number of dye EY molecules by electrostatic adsorption. The ground state EY absorbed on CNS/CW-3 surface absorbed photons under visible light to form a single excited state EY1⁎. The singlet excitation EY1⁎ rapidly generated triplet excitation EY3⁎ through effective intersystem crossover (ISC). In the presence of TEOA as a sacrificial donor, EY3⁎ can be reduced and quenched to produce reduced EY radicals. Photogenerated electrons migrated to the surface of the catalyst (CoNi2S4), and then reacted with protons in solution to form H2. Therefore, under the synergistic action of CNS/CW-3 and dye EY, the composite flower spherical photocatalyst exhibited high photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production system."
15,Conclusions,"In conclusion, CNS/CW-3 composite photocatalyst with adjustable flower spherical morphology was synthesized by hydrothermal method. Especially under the effective regulation of TBA, the photocatalytic activity of CNS/CW-3 under visible light was better than that of other samples. Moreover, the fluorescence attenuation rate of CNS/CW-3 was improved successfully, which accelerated the separation of photoelectrons and further improved the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. Large specific surface area provided more active sites, thus accelerating electron transfer and hydrogen generation. For comparison, CNS/CW-x photocatalysts with different proportions were prepared, which further verified the influence of different loadings on flower-like spherical catalysts. From various experimental data and analysis, it can be seen that only by adjusting the appropriate proportion of substances, the new structure can be fully utilized and the hydrogen production activity under visible light can be significantly improved. The results also showed that the morphology-controlled photocatalysts have broad application prospects in the field of photocatalysis."
