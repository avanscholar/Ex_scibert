0,Introduction,"Uncontaminated water is in high demand, as it has become a rarity. Water is mainly polluted by anthropogenic sources. One of the hazardous pollutants is synthetic dye and about 54% of it is released by the textile industries. Apart from this, 10% of dye effluents are released from pulp and paper industries, while paint and tannery industries discharge about 8% of the dye effluents [1]. The process of dyeing involves consumption of gallons of water and approximately 15% (∼280 kilotonnes) of the dye effluents are released in water, annually [2]. These organic pollutants can severely alter the water ecosystem if discharged without treatment. Moreover, these xenobiotic compounds are potent carcinogens which are also known to cause liver or respiratory disorder, necrosis, jaundice, and can even damage organs [3]. Furthermore, the global status shows a significant decline in the dye production in the countries of Europe and USA while an increase in the Asian countries. India is the second largest (∼9%) global producer of dyes [2]. This urges for stringent policies to prevent the release of these pollutants into water bodies. Moreover, sophisticated techniques must be used to treat the pollutants, generated during the dyeing or manufacturing process, before their discharge into water reservoirs. The textile industries use a variety of synthetic dyes which may be broadly classified as mordant, vat, reactive, acidic, basic, direct and disperse dyes [2]. Researchers have used several techniques like ozonisation, adsorption, enzyme immobilisation, electrocoagulation, photocatalysis and membrane filtration for dye removal [1,3,4]. Adsorption is commonly the choice due to economic viability, good efficiency and the ease of operation [1]. The adsorbents reported so far have not been able to remove wide variety of dyes from wastewater, owing to specificity of interaction based on the surface charge and functionalization of the adsorbent (Table 5). In the current study, facile hybrid hydrogel beads are obtained by using Graphene oxide (GO), Polyethylene imine (PEI) and Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) via microwave-assisted synthesis. Microwave accelerates the rate of the reaction resulting in high yield of the product and also generates free radicals/ions in situ resulting in chemically active adsorbent [5]. GO is widely used due to its amphiphilic nature and facilitates polar and non-polar interactions with the dyes. GO, in its pristine form, is known for dye removal from wastewater [6]. However, complete retrieval of GO after water treatment is tedious due to its extremely small size. Thus, the feasibility of formation of 3D network of graphene oxide with polymer in the form of hydrogels has proved effective in water remediation [3,6–8]. The choice of appropriate polymers like PEI and PVA helps in enhancing the binding sites for the dye molecules. The abundance of amino and hydroxyl groups in the polymer facilitates strong hydrogen bonding and chemical interactions. The hybrid network is chosen to target larger classes of dyes such as azo, triarylmethane, xanthene, indigoid, anthraquinone and thiazine dyes. The removal of dyes using the hydrogel beads occurs by both adsorption and absorption process. Moreover, these GO-PEI-PVA hydrogel (GPPH) beads could easily be recovered after the adsorption process. Several studies of graphene based 3D assemblies via hydrothermal synthesis, freeze thawing and other chemical routes are reported for dye adsorption[3,7,8]. To the best of our knowledge, the efficient removal of wide-range of dyes by a single adsorbent has not been reported so far (Table 5). Moreover, the adsorbent is synthesised using a greener approach. Thus, the work focuses on developing a technology for dye removal using the GPPH beads. Hence, apart from batch adsorption, fixed bed column adsorption studies are also undertaken to prove the practical applicability of the adsorbent."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Analytical grade chemicals were used without further purification. Graphite powder (<20 µm, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), poly(vinyl alcohol) (Mw=145000, DoH≥98%, Merck), poly(ethylenimine) (Mw=2000, 50 wt% solution in H2O, Sigma Aldrich) and glutaraldehyde (25 wt% solution in H2O, Merck) were used for synthesis. Analytical grade dyes such as fuschin basic (FB), brilliant green (BG), malachite green oxalate (MG), methylene blue trihydrate (MB), fluorescein sodium salt (FSS), reactive orange 16 (RO), congo red (CR), eosin yellow (EY), rhodamine B (RB), crystal violet (CV), indigo carmine (IC), alizarin red S (ARS), methyl orange (MO) and eriochrome black T (EBT) were purchased from Sisco research laboratory, India."
3,Instrumentation techniques,"2.2 Instrumentation techniques The adsorbents and raw materials were analysed by FT-IR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum 2, USA) in the wavelength range 450 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. The X-ray diffractogram were recorded with X-ray powder diffractometer (X-Pert3, PANalytical, Netherlands). The Raman spectra were obtained by Raman microscope (DXR, Thermo scientific, USA). The thermograms were analysed using simultaneous DSC/TG analyzer (SDT 650, TA instruments, France). The UV spectra of the analyte were recorded by UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary UV 60, USA). The calibration curves were obtained to estimate the dye concentration (SI, Table S4). The transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM JEM-2100 Plus, JEOL, Japan) was used to obtain the micrographs of the synthesised GO and GO-PEI reaction mixture. The micrographs of GPPH were obtained using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-IT300, JEOL, Japan) and elemental analysis was done using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) operated at 15 kV. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was recorded using the BET surface analyser (Quantchrome autosorb ASiQwin, Anton Paar, Austria) to estimate the pore volume and pore surface area. Microwave reactor (CEM, Discover, USA) was used for the synthesis of hybrid hydrogel beads."
4,Synthesis of GPPH,"2.3 Synthesis of GPPH Graphene oxide is synthesised by modified Hummers method [9]. Golden brown GO dispersion of 1 mg mL−1 (w/v) in water is prepared by ultrasonication for 5 min. The microwave-aided synthesis of GPPH require the optimisation of the reaction temperature, microwave power and run-time (SI, Section S1). The synthesis of GPPH is self-designed and is carried out in two steps. In the first step, 7 wt% PEI is added to 1 mg mL−1 GO dispersion in a Intelli-Vent microwave vessel sealed with a teflon cap. The microwave reactor is operated at a microwave power of 100 W at 90°C for 10 min and the colour of the solution changes to black after the reaction. In the second step, 0.8 mL of 35 wt% (v/v) concentrated HCl is added to the reaction mixture, followed by the addition of 10 wt% PVA solution. The solution is subjected to irradiation with microwave power of 50 W at 70°C for 5 min. The solution is poured in a vial and 20 μL of 25 wt% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (GA) is added to it. The solution gelates resulting in self-assembled beads at room temperature (Scheme 1 ). The GPPH beads are further washed with distilled water and are subjected to two freeze–thaw cycles."
5,Results and discussion,"The concentration of GO and polymers, PEI and PVA are crucial to induce structural stability to the cross-linked network (SI, Section S1). Moreover, addition of optimal cross-linker glutaraldehyde (GA) to the reaction mixture at acidic pH also facilitates the self-assembly of the polymer chains. The composition of the GPPH is confirmed by using various characterisation techniques. TEM micrographs confirm the layered graphene oxide structure with several folds and overlaps (Fig. 1 .a) [8]. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern ascertain the structure of GO (Fig. 1.b, c). The d-spacing of 2.0 Å confirms the presence of graphitic region in the graphene oxide (Fig. 1.b, c) [10]. The TEM micrographs of the GO-PEI solution shows the polymer coated graphene oxide sheets (Fig. 1.d). The HRTEM images and SAED pattern indicate that the graphitic structure of the composite is partially retained after the microwave synthesis (SI, Section S2, Table S1). The slight increase in the d-spacing (2.4 Å) of graphene oxide is due to the functionalisation of GO on incorporation of the polymer (Fig. 1.e) [11]. The reaction profile of GPPH synthesis is studied using UV–vis spectrophotometer (Fig. 2 .a). The peak at 230 nm corresponds to π → π ∗ transition of CC and the peak at 300 nm is due to n → π ∗ transition of CO. After the reaction of GO with PEI, a new peak at 520 nm emerges which corresponds to n → π ∗ transition of amide links [8]. The bathochromic shift in this peak is due to the extensive conjugation. However, after treating GO-PEI solution with HCl and PVA, the peak intensity of n → π ∗ decreases due to the protonation of amino moieties."
6,Evidence of functionalisation of GPPH,"3.1 Evidence of functionalisation of GPPH The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the functionalisation of GPPH. The wide scan spectra of GPPH shows the reduction in oxygen content (Fig. 2.b) which is mainly due to addition of PEI in the microwave-induced synthesis (SI, Section S3, Fig. S3) [12]. This is also evident by the change in the colour of the solution from golden brown to black (Scheme 1). The high-resolution spectra of the elements are deconvoluted using Shirley background and fitted in a Gaussian-Lorentzian peak ratio of 30 using XPSpeak41 software. The deconvoluted spectra of C 1s shows the binding energies at 284.68 eV, 285.39 eV, 284.29 eV, 285.03 eV, 288.68 eV, 288.8 eV and 286.35 eV which corresponds to the presence of CC, COH, CC, CN, NCO, OCO and COC respectively (Fig. 2.c). The relative percentage of each functional group present in the GPPH is estimated from the deconvoluted high-resolution spectra of the elements (Fig. 2.b, c, d, e). Similarly, deconvoluted spectra of O 1s shows the presence of OH groups (∼62%) which could be due to the surface hydroxides or bound hydroxides on the GPPH (Fig. 2.d). These OH groups are largely responsible for the binding of the cationic dyes by electrostatic interactions. The peak at 533.16 eV is due to CO groups signifying the incomplete reduction of graphene oxide in GPPH. The deconvoluted spectra of N 1s shows a peak at a higher binding energy (401.55 eV) which could be due to the protonation of a few primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups in GPPH [13]. These amino groups are largely responsible for the adsorption of the anionic dyes to the hydrogel (Fig. 2.e). The peak at 398.33 eV confirms the presence of amino group (∼26%), which may bind the dye moieties. Apart from that, the peak at 400.75 eV confirms the presence of C−N moieties, which could be due to the C−NH or C−NH2 in GPPH (Fig. 2.e). The cross-linking of hydrogel network is largely due to the presence of COC, OCNH, OCO bonds apart from the hydrogen bonding interactions (Scheme 1). Thus, the evidence of cross-linking of GO sheets with PEI and PVA resulting in the formation of GPPH is given by the XPS technique. The FT-IR spectra of GO, PVA, PEI and GPPH are used to ascertain the presence of functional groups (Fig. 2.g). The GPPH shows characteristic peaks of the functional groups present in GO, PVA and PEI (Table 1 ). The peak at 3422 cm−1 is due hydrogen bonded OHstr in GPPH. The reduction in peak broadening indicates decreased hydrogen bonding interactions in the hydrogel. The peak at 2922 cm−1 is attributed to the sp3CHstr. The presence of peak at 1630 cm−1 indicates COstr of amide group in GPPH. Moreover, the peak at 1394 cm−1 is due to CNstr in GPPH. The peak at 1033 cm−1 is attributed to COstr and the peak at 602 cm−1 is due to the HNCO bending. Additionally, Raman spectra of GPPH are compared with the Raman spectra of the reactants (Fig. 2.f). In PVA, the peak at 2912 cm−1 is due the CH2 group and the peak at 1450 cm−1 with a small shoulder peak at 1376 cm−1 are attributed to the vibrational modes caused by the bending interactions of CH2 groups and OH groups of the PVA chains [14]. The peak at 1082 cm−1 is due to COC links in PVA. The intense peak at 891 cm−1 and 910 cm−1 of the skeletal PVA chain is due to the vibrational modes caused by bending of CC and rocking of CH2 groups in PVA. PEI spectra shows a peak at 1591 cm−1 for NH2 bending vibration. The peak at 1450 cm−1 and 1300 cm−1 is due to the bending vibrations of CH2 groups in the polymer chains [15]. The G band responsible for the graphitic nature of GO is located at 1598 cm−1 while the D band at 1313 cm−1 arises from the structural defects caused by the oxygen functionalities of sp3 hybridised carbon in GO. A slight shift in the D and G band is observed with an increase in D/G ratio of GPPH on incorporation of PEI and PVA (Table 2 ) [13]. Boehm titration is performed in order to quantify the different functional groups present in the GPPH (SI, Section S4). The GPPH contains several lactonic, phenolic and carboxylic groups [16]. In Boehm titration, addition of NaOH helps in the neutralisation of lactonic, phenolic and carboxylic groups, while Na2CO3 brings about the neutralisation of carboxylic and lactonic groups and NaHCO3 neutralises the carboxylic groups [16]. The neutralising ability of different bases helps in the quantification of different types of oxygen groups present in GPPH. The quantification of the surface groups is done using Eq. (1), (1) n S F = n H C l n A B V B - H C l V H C l - N a O H V N a O H V B V A where n S F is the number of moles of reacted oxygen functionalities on adsorbent surface, B is the concentration of the reaction bases (NaOH, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3) of volume V B . V A is the volume of aliquot taken after the neutralisation reaction from the reaction base of volume, V B . V H C l is the volume of 0.05 mol L–1 HCl added to the aliquot which is back-titrated with 0.05 mol L–1 NaOH of volume, V N a O H . The results prove that GPPH has several epoxy, carboxylic and phenolic groups which are conducive for dye adsorption (Table 2)."
7,"Morphological, physical and thermal characteristics of GPPH","3.2 Morphological, physical and thermal characteristics of GPPH The SEM micrographs of GPPH provide the surface morphology of the hydrogel beads. The back-scattered image does not show any contrast indicating uniform distribution of the elements throughout the surface (Fig. 3 .a). The image correlates well with the secondary electron image of GPPH (SI, Fig.S4). The surface of GPPH is uniformly flaked with several small ridges which act as adsorption sites. The cross sectional view of the beads shows several macroporous regions with uneven elevations (Fig. 3.b). The micrographs confirm that the surface of GPPH is conducive for diffusion of the dye molecules into it. The EDS spectra of GPPH shows ∼72% C, 4% N and ∼24% O which correlates well with the results obtained from XPS (Fig. 3.c). The BET analysis of the adsorbent reveals that the incorporation of large polymer chains keep the GO sheets intact but reduces the porous surface area (Table 2). The adsorbent follows type IV adsorption isotherm with type H1 hysteresis loop (Fig. 3.d). This implies that there is a uniform distribution of mesoporous cavities in the adsorbent. The presence of hysteresis is due to the pore condensation in multilayer adsorption caused by adsorption metastability or network effects [17]. The X-ray diffractogram of pristine GO shows a strong peak at 2θ=11.01° with a interplanar distance of 0.80 nm as calculated by Bragg’s formula (SI, Section S6) [18]. The increased interplanar distance of graphene oxide indicates the incorporation of various oxygen functional groups [19]. The diffractogram of PVA shows a prominent peak at 2θ=19.68° with a interplanar distance of 1.3 nm and a shoulder peak at 2θ=22.8° (Fig. 3.e). The miller indices correspond to the monoclinic unit cell [20]. However, GPPH shows a broadened peak at 2θ=19.53° with a shoulder peak at 2θ=27.63°. This confirms that PVA is bound to the GO sheets as the diffractogram is similar to that of PVA (Fig. 3.e). However, considerable peak shift in X-ray diffractogram of GPPH indicates that the incorporation of PEI and PVA induces amorphous nature due to the alteration in the structural domains. The crystallite size calculated using Scherer formula is found to be 1.80 nm for GPPH which is much lower in comparison with PVA (6.41 nm) and GO (11.14 nm). The degree of crystallinity of GPPH (21.89%) is lower than that of pure PVA (29.77%) indicating the amorphous nature (SI, Section S6, Table S2). The comparison of the thermograms of GPPH with GO and PVA indicate that the hydrogel has greater stability than the reactants. The thermogram of GO displays a major inflexion at 166°C (Fig. 3.f). About 76% weight loss between 185°C and 198°C for GO is due to the loss of oxygen containing functional groups [13]. Similarly, PVA decomposes after 227°C, with 66% weight loss due to the disruption of hydroxyl groups of the PVA chains [21]. However, GPPH has weight loss in four steps. In step I, ∼2% of bound water molecules are lost which is much lower than that of GO and PVA (SI, Table S3). The loss of oxygen containing functional groups occur between 128°C and 208°C. The slow degradation from 272°C−356°C is due to disruption of chain cross-links which are responsible for the hydrogel network (Fig. 3.f). This indicates that the hydrogel is strongly cross-linked and the addition of PEI is responsible for strengthening the hydrogel network. This shows that GPPH has greater thermal stability. Finally, at a temperature greater than 472°C, the backbone of the polymer chain of GPPH starts decomposing (Table 2)."
8,Dye adsorption studies,"3.3 Dye adsorption studies In the current study, GPPH has been used for the removal of dyes such as azo (CR, RO, MO, EBT), triarylmethane (BG, CV, MG, FB), anthraquinone (ARS), xanthene (FSS, EY, RB), indigoid (IC) and thiazine (MB) dyes (SI, Table S4). The adsorbent binds the dye molecules effectively, bringing about its removal from the solution. However, the affinity of dyes to GPPH depends on the nature of dyes. Thus, several experimental conditions such as initial dye concentration, pH, adsorbent dosage, temperature and contact time are optimised for efficient dye removal. The study is performed in triplicates and the average value is used for plotting the graphs. 3.3.1 Effect of initial concentration The adsorption studies are conducted with 0.03 g of GPPH in 10 mL of dye solution by varying the concentration from 20 to 100 mg L−1. Adsorption decreases on increasing the concentration of the dyes due to saturation of the adsorbent sites. Therefore, 20 mg L−1 dye solution is chosen for further optimisation studies (Fig. 4 .a). However, GPPH adsorbs 99% of BG even at higher concentration of the dye. 3.3.2 Effect of pH and mechanism of adsorption The pH of dye solution plays a crucial role for effective adsorption. The pH study is conducted by adding 0.030 g of GPPH to a 20 mg L−1 dye solution. The pH of the dye solution is adjusted from 3 to 11 using 0.1 mol L−1 HCl and 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH. The variation in pH brings about structural changes through protonation or deprotonation of the dye molecules, which is responsible for their binding to the adsorbent sites by electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding [22]. Moreover, the dye adsorption by GPPH also depends on modification of the functional groups present on the adsorbent as the pH is varied (Scheme 2 ) [23]. At an acidic pH (pH<7), the NH2 and OH groups of GPPH may get protonated and bind with anionic dyes (Scheme 2). Similarly, at a basic pH (pH>7), deprotonation of the NH2, NH, OH and COOH groups make the surface of GPPH negatively charged, which facilitates the binding of cationic dyes [23]. As various functional groups are present in different proportion in GPPH, it is important to study the predominant surface charge on the adsorbent at a particular pH. The determination of pHPZC (point of zero charge) plays a vital role in ascertaining the surface charge of the adsorbent. This also helps in comprehending the electrostatic interactions of the adsorbent with the cationic and anionic dyes. At the point of zero charge, the surface of GPPH is zero, indicating the presence of equal number of positively and negatively charged groups (SI, section S9). The pHPZC of GPPH is determined by the pH-drift method and is found to be 1.28 (Fig. 5 ) [24]. At pH>pHPZC, the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged. The NH−, O− and COO− groups facilitate the adsorption of cationic dyes viz. MG, BG, MB, FB, CV and RB by electrostatic interactions [22,23]. Thus, the adsorption of cationic dyes is effective in wide pH range (3–11) as the surface is predominantly negatively charged (Fig. 4.b). However, the anionic dyes show a pH-dependent adsorption on GPPH (Fig. 4.b). The electrostatic interaction of the anionic dyes is well understood by taking into consideration the pKa value of the dyes. The structural change of the dye moieties with the variation in pH of the dye solution causes a colour change in anionic dyes like CR, EBT, MO and ARS (Fig. 4.b) [25]. Adsorption of anionic dyes occurs by electrostatic interaction or hydrogen bonding when the dye exists in cationic or unionised form, based on the pKa value of the dye (SI, Table S5). CR and EBT exists in unionised form and the negatively charged GPPH adsorbs the dye molecules by hydrogen bonding [18,25]. However, EBT loses proton at pH 6–7 which is responsible for the decreased adsorption on GPPH as it exists in its anionic form [26]. Similarly, maximum adsorption of ARS occurs at pH 3 as it exists as unionised species at pH<4 [27] while RO adsorbs at acidic pH [28]. On the contrary, GPPH adsorbs EY (pKa=4.8) at a basic pH, as it exists as anionic species at acidic pH and adsorption is hindered due to electrostatic repulsion [29,30]. Similarly, adsorption of MO decreases drastically due to the predominance of anionic form caused by the deprotonation of –SO3H groups at pH>3.8 [31].However, IC (pKa=12.2) binds well to GPPH in its unionized form at pH 3–11 [32]. FSS exhibits a highly pH dependent behaviour as it exists as cationic species at pH<2 and anionic species pH>4.3. A drastic decrease in FSS adsorption is observed at pH>4.3 due to the formation of mono-anionic or di-anionic species [33]. However, the interaction of the dye molecules with the adsorbent is not purely electrostatic in nature (Scheme 3 ). The possibility of existence of other non-covalent interactions like dipole–dipole, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions could also be responsible for the dye uptake by the adsorbent [34]. The aromatic rings of the dyes interact with the aromatic rings of graphene oxide in GPPH by π-π stacking interactions [35]. Additionally, the protonated amino groups of polyethylenimine in GPPH have strong binding affinity towards SO3 −, O− and COO− groups of the anionic dyes (CR, RO, EY, IC, ARS, MO, EBT, FSS) [36,37]. Not only that, the dye molecules have free OH and NH2 groups which can also hydrogen bond with the amino and hydroxyl groups present in GPPH. Additionally, due to the mesoporous nature of the adsorbent, the possibility of diffusion of these large dye molecules into the interstices of the hydrogel also exists (Scheme 3) [37]. 3.3.3 Effect of adsorbent dosage The adsorbent dosage is optimised for the dye removal by taking varying amount of GPPH in a 20 mg L−1 dye solution at the optimised pH. On increasing the adsorbent dosage, the dye removal increases gradually due to increase in adsorption sites (Fig. 4.c). The optimum adsorbent dosage is found to be 0.03 g for ARS, BG, CR and EY; 0.045 g for FB, FSS, MB, MG and CV; 0.09 g for RB, MO, RO, EBT and IC. 3.3.4 Effect of contact time The contact time required to reach the dye adsorption equilibrium is obtained by immersing the optimised amount of GPPH in 20 mg L−1 dye solution (SI, Fig S9). Within first 5 min, 94% BG, 90% EY and 93% FB are adsorbed by GPPH. While, adsorption equilibrium of EBT, RO, IC and CV reaches only after 120 min. However, the adsorption equilbrium of ARS, MB, MO, RB and MG requires 5–6 h contact time (Fig. 4.d). The variation in adsorption equilibrium time is due to the difference in the binding affinity of dye moieties to the functional groups of GPPH. Moreover, the slower adsorption could be due to diffusion and mass transfer interactions. Therefore, the equilibrium adsorption time is taken as 6 h. 3.3.5 Effect of temperature The dye adsorption is studied at 25°C, 35°C and 45°C. On increasing the temperature, the dye adsorption decreases gradually. This could be due to the loss of the physisorbed dye molecules from the adsorbent. However, the adsorption of dye molecules such as MO, EBT and CR increases at higher temperature (Fig. 4.e). The increase in temperature provides the additional heat required for mobilising these dye molecules onto the adsorbent sites. 3.3.6 Equilibrium adsorption and kinetic studies The equilibrium adsorption studies are performed by adding the optimised dosage of GPPH in different dye solutions in the concentration range 2.5 mg L−1–20 mg L−1 for 6 h (SI, section S10). The adsorption data are fitted in Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubnin Radukevich (D-R) adsorption isotherm models (SI, Section S10, Fig. S6). Most of the dyes predominantly fit well in Langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating that the adsorption is primarily by chemisorption. However, ARS, CR, IC, RB and MO obey Freundlich isotherm signifying occurrence of physisorption on GPPH. BG, EBT, and RB also fit in Temkin model, indicating existence of physico-chemical interactions of these dyes molecules with the adsorbent (Table 3 ). Adsorption of CV, EY and MG by GPPH fit well in D-R isotherm which implies occurrence of physisorption as the mean adsorption energy (E) is less than 8 kJ mol−1 [38]. The adsorption kinetic study is performed by adding optimum amount of GPPH to 20 mg L−1 of dye solution. The aliquots are taken after every 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90,120, 180 min and the concentration of the dye solutions are determined. The adsorption kinetic data are fitted in pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intra-particle diffusion model and Elovich equation (SI, Section S10, Fig. S7). The adsorption data of all the dyes fit well in the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating chemisorption as the rate-limiting step for the adsorption process [38]. Furthermore, the good-fit of kinetic data in the Elovich model signifies that the adsorbent surface is energetically heterogeneous (Table 4 ). The kinetic data fit well in intra-particle diffusion model for IC, MO, RB and RO implying that diffusion of the dye moieties also governs the adsorption kinetics. The adsorption of MO and RB follows pseudo-first order kinetics, indicating that the rate-determining step of the adsorption involves interfacial diffusion and physisorption, which may be the reason for slow adsorption kinetics of these two dyes [38]."
9,Comparative assessment of GPPH with adsorbents reported in the literature,3.4 Comparative assessment of GPPH with adsorbents reported in the literature The efficiency of cationic and anionic dye adsorption by GPPH is compared with adsorbents reported in the literature. GPPH proves to be effective for the treatment of a broad-spectrum of dyes (Table 5 ).
10,"Practical applicability: interference, regeneration and column studies","3.5 Practical applicability: interference, regeneration and column studies The hydrogel beads are further tested for their reusability by regenerating them with 0.1 mol L−1 HCl. The addition of acid helps in recharging the adsorption sites by desorbing the dye moieties. GPPH is regenerated upto 5 cycles and it has practically good reusability for dye removal even after the 5th adsorption–desorption cycle (Fig. 4.f). In order to check the viability of the adsorbent for real-time wastewater treatment, optimum dosage of GPPH is added to the simulated water (SI, Section S13). A 20 mg L−1 dye solution was spiked with 100 mg L−1 of NO3 −, SO4 2−, PO4 3−, HCO3 − Cl−, Mg2+, Ca2+ , K+ and Na+ ions which are commonly used in the dyeing process [2]. The adsorbent is effective in the removal of 90%−95% ARS, BG, CV, EY, EBT and RO indicating high affinity of the dye molecules for the adsorbent sites (Fig. 6 .a). About 70% of MG and CR are removed by GPPH while only 30%–40% removal is achieved for FSS and IC. However, GPPH shows very low removal capacity for RB, MO, FB and MB dyes, which could be due to greater affinity of the interfering ions for the adsorption sites. Owing to the good regenerability and good dye removal efficiency, the practical applicability of GPPH is tested for industrial applications via fixed bed column adsorption studies. While batch adsorption studies play a key role in optimisation of parameters for adsorption, but for its practical applicability in wastewater treatment plant, column adsorption studies would be ideal [41]. For the column adsorption studies, an indigenous 5 cm long glass column of 1.3 mm inner diameter and 1.5 mm outer diameter is fabricated (Fig. 6.b). The column is connected to the peristaltic pump (Ismatec Reglo ICC, Cole Parmer, Germany) to maintain the flow rate of the dye effluent. The column is tightly packed with coarsely crushed hydrogel beads. The column performance is evaluated using breakthrough curve which is plotted as the ratio of the effluent concentration (Ct , mg L−1) to that of the influent concentration (C0, mg L−1) with respect to time (h) [42]. The efficacy of the column adsorption is tested with basic dye (BG), azo dye (RO) and fluorescent dye (EY) for wider applicability (Fig. 6.c). The amount of the dye present in the column ( m i n , t , m g ) at time, t (h) is given as (2) m i n , t = C 0 Q t where Q is flow rate in L h−1 The amount of unadsorbed dye moieties at time, t (mout,t, mg) is calculated by multiplying the area under the dimensionless curve by initial concentration and the flow rate, which is given by (3) m o u t , t = C 0 Q ∫ t 0 C t C 0 d t The amount of dyes adsorbed ( m a ds , t , m g ) by column is given as (4) m ads , t = m i n , t - m o u t , t The equilibrium uptake capacity (qe, mg g−1) is given by the equation: (5) q e = m a d s , t M = C 0 Q ∫ 0 t 1 - C t C 0 d t M where M is mass of the adsorbent (M, g) [41]. The dye adsorption efficiency of the column is given by (6) % Dye removal = m a d s , t m i n , t × 100 The shape of the breakthrough curve is mainly influenced by the mechanism of adsorption. The breakthrough curve is fitted in the Thomas model to determine the equilibrium uptake capacity (SI, Section S11, Fig. S8). This model is chosen because the adsorption data fit well in Langmuir adsorption isotherm and obey pseudo-second-order kinetics. The 100 mg L−1 of dye solution is run at a flow rate of 0.006 L h−1. The column is regenerated by passing 0.1 mol L−1 HCl solution at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The regenerated column is used again for dye adsorption. In a continuous flow system, the column adsorption by GPPH follows the order RO>EY>BG, with the dye removal efficiency of 77%, 75% and 56% respectively. The adsorption efficiency does not decrease after regeneration of column for EY and RO, however for BG a slight reduction in adsorption is observed (Fig. 6.d-f). The experimental equilibrium capacity of the adsorbent correlates well with the value obtained by Thomas model (Table 6 ). However, the column exhaustion time is 91 h, 48 h and 11 h for RO, EY and BG respectively. This shows that GPPH has good commercial applicability."
11,Conclusion,"GPPH beads are synthesised and used for removal of a wide variety of cationic and anionic dyes. The XPS and FT-IR spectra prove the presence of amine, amide, carboxyl, lactonic and phenolic moieties that aid in adsorption of the dyes. The mesoporous morphology as well as amphiphilic nature of GPPH is also responsible for dye sorption by pore diffusion and non-covalent interactions. The affinity of the dye molecules towards GPPH varies from cationic to anionic dyes. The hydrogel beads can easily be regenerated with 0.1 mol L−1 HCl and the adsorbent removes more than 75% of the dyes in most cases, after the 5th adsorption–desorption cycle. Due to the ability of GPPH to bind to a number of dyes, its potential for industrial applications is explored. GPPH removes greater than 90% of dyes (ARS, BG, CV, EY, EBT and RO) in spiked water samples containing cations and anions which usually interfere in the dyeing process. Moreover, the adsorbent is tightly packed into a column and subjected to a continuous flow of dye effluent, wherein GPPH removes 77%, 75% and 56% of RO, EY and BG dyes. Moreover, the dye removal efficiency is retained even when GPPH is reused in a continuous flow system. Thus, GPPH has a great potential, as an adsorbent, in wastewater treatment."
