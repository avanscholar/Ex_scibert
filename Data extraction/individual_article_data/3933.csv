0,Introduction,"As of today, over 1.5 billion vehicles travel the roads and highways of the world today. The world transportation sector heavily determines the current world economy and their performance is highly sensitive towards the energy conversion efficiency, fuel availability and costs [1]. Diesel engine vehicles were the first to enter the modern transportation sector and have undergone a major overall over the decades to maintain its status quo position in the global market. Diesel engines popularly termed as Compression Ignition or CI engines, gained popularity over the years for its ability to deliver high performance and better fuel economy with lower maintenance costs. Passenger vehicles, public transportation, power generation equipment, heavy-duty machinery, industrial and agricultural equipment of the contemporary world widely operate on CI engines [2]. In recent times, the exhorting anticipation of additional improvements in diesel fuel and diesel vehicle sales in future have enforced diesel engine manufacturers to upgrade the technology in terms of fuel economy, power and emissions. Despite exhibiting remarkable edge over its competition, emissions from diesel engine is an area of serious concern, with the emissions being carcinogenic in nature [3]. Sufficient evidence have pointed towards the risk of developing lung cancer in case of prolonged exposure to its emissions [4,5]. The diesel engine combustion exhibits many pollutants like carbon dioxide, soot and oxides of nitrogen which are hazardous to both the human health and an environment. However, the total hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are significantly lower in diesel engine compared to spark ignition engine [6]. The carbon dioxide emissions are the wreaker-in-chief, directly contributing to greenhouse effect and ozone layer depletion while oxides of nitrogen emissions lead to smog formation and acid rain formation [7]. Prolonged exposure to soot and particulate matter emissions are found to cause cardiovascular and skin problems [8] Emissions from the transportation sector accounts for 25% of the world’s greenhouse gas and is expected to grow further unless drastic steps are taken. Fig. 1 illustrates the global carbon dioxide emissions from various sectors and predicts the emissions in the future if sustainable methodologies are not adopted. Furthermore, the energy demands have grown exponentially in the last few decades with the economic boom and drastic technology development. Fig. 2 represents the drastic increase in the global energy demand by various sectors such as Industries, Transport, Buildings and Oil. By 2040, the global energy requirement is expected to grow by 25% with requirement of over $ 2 trillion dollars investment per year [9]. Fig. 3 illustrates the rise in demand of primary energy and represents the supply through various sources of energy. Diesel fuels, on the other hand, are fossil fuels – extracted from the refining of non-renewable crude petroleum oil. Over the past two industrialization centuries, these fossil fuel sources have been exploited to such an extent that the demand is no longer able to keep up with the supply. From Fig. 4 , it is observed the transportation sector posts the highest demand in past few years for liquid fuel sources and is expected to increase further in the future. The stringent emission legislations and escalating energy demands are compelling engine manufacturers to develop technologies and explore new fuel sources without having to worry about the engine modifications [10]. Research and scientific community have understood present scenario of global energy demand and the need of clean environment for human beings which urge themselves to identify viable renewable sources for partial or complete replacement of diesel fuel. It is also necessary for the alternative fuel to be economically competitive, technically, environmentally acceptable and easily available [11]. Alternate biofuel sources suggested for utilization in CI engines includes biodiesels, alcohols, nanoparticles, ethers and blends of various fuels mentioned earlier. Biofuel adoption not only eases reduces the exhaust emissions but also reduce the strain on world’s crude oil supply. Among various biofuels proposed, Biodiesel - a renewable source of fuel has garnered heavy attention in the scientific community. Biodiesel is an oxygenated diesel engine fuel obtained from edible or inedible vegetable oils and animals oils by transesterification process [12]. Unlike diesel, biodiesel and its derivatives are non-toxic, biodegradable and eco-friendly with far lower emissions. Various nations have adopted biodiesel/vegetable oil substitution for diesel fuel based on their atmospheric and soil conditions. For example, palm oil is predominantly utilized in South-East Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, while USA and Europe have adopted soybean oil and sunflower oil respectively [13,14]. However, biodiesel/vegetable oils usually have higher molecular mass and viscosities than standard diesel, thereby affecting the spray characteristics of the fuel inside the cylinder [15]. Therefore, direct utilization of vegetable oils without blending negatively affects the combustion process and build up carbon deposits on the engine parts [16]. Furthermore, lower calorific value and higher pour pint are the other important properties to strengthen the unsuitability of biodiesel. However, the biodiesel effectively reduces the hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and particulate matter emissions during its operation under all form of concentrations. Interestingly, the oxides of nitrogen emission from biodiesel fuelled engine would be the major hurdle and this NOx emission formation also depends upon the operating conditions of the diesel engine [17]. Although the scientific community have come up with various or post treatment techniques such as Exhaust Gas Recirculation, Selective Catalytic Reduction etc., most of them are complicated suffer complications due to their trade-offs with other emissions or significant modification of engines [18]. Hence, to reduce the complexity involved, most of the practical work suggest fuel modification through further blending or additive addition. Hence, it is highly recommended to utilize blends of biodiesel with diesel or other additives such as alcohols and nanoparticles, which effectively mask the shortcomings of pure biodiesel. Alcohols have also been widely considered and utilized in compression ignition engines as biofuels. However, there were quite a few hindrances in its direct addition to diesel engines or blending with pure diesel fuel. Instances of poor miscibility with diesel, lower lubrication and high auto-ignition temperature and complications in fuel vaporization were reported in the previous studies [19,20]. Studies have shown that alcohol and diesel are immiscible fluids, leading to cases of phase-separation during blending and hence, it requires emulsifiers or co-solvents to prepare a proper blend [21]. However, the above stated process is rather complicated due to the extensive heating, blending, splashing and is not financially economical. On the other hand, biodiesel is found to be completely miscible with both diesel and alcohols and prevents the case of phase separation that occurs in diesel-alcohol blends [22]. Both biodiesel and alcohol when blended together work hand-in-hand to compensate for each other’s individual properties, which are detrimental to their overall performance and emissions. Therefore, researches have carried out extensive work in perfecting the alcohol utilization as an additive by studying the engine characteristics of diesel-alcohol, diesel–biodiesel-alcohol, biodiesel-alcohol and diesel-alcohols-co-solvent. Another prospective additive researched in recent times are the nanoparticles, which usually act as a combustion catalyst when blended with fuel in CI engines. These additives are present at nano-length scale thus exhibit higher surface area to volume ratio, which is found to aid the combustion process [23]. The higher surface contact area provides larger platform for the fuel oxidation process and thereby unlocking double the energy capable to be derived from the corresponding fuel combustion and molecular explosion. They not only enhance the properties of the fuel blended with, but also ensure effective mixing of the components through surface diffusion and significantly improve their rate of reaction. The other advantages of nanoparticle inclusion are higher combustion enthalpies, shorter ignition delay and overall higher energy density [24]. Most importantly, the emissions associated with nanoparticle-blended fuels are significantly lower than standard diesel and this is achieved without any trade-off with the performance and combustion characteristics [25]. In fact, nanoparticle inclusion satisfies all the basic requirements to utilize as additive for lower emissions, better emission/performance trade-off, chemical stability upon blending without any modifications requirement. Eventhuogh the nanoparticle offers many advantages as additive for CI engine applications, the smaller size particles emit from combustion could detoriate human lungs and this is one of the major areas of concern for commercialization of nanoparticles in automotive sector [26,27]."
1,Background and properties – alcohol family,"Alcohols are carbon chain compounds containing one or more hydroxyl groups attached to the base alkane structure. The alcohol family ranges from the single carbon methanol to twenty carbon phytol and higher chain compounds, yet to be deeply researched. The chemical properties of various members of the alcohol family is tabulated in Table 1 . Fig. 5 depicts how the properties of members of alcohol family varies as the carbon chain length increases. Alcohols are available in abundance and easily obtained by anaerobic fermentation of various forestry and agricultural biomass wastes such as saw-mill, wood-pulp, sugarcane bagasse, rice straw etc [28]. Fig. 6 illustrates the popular and most preferred production methodologies for the members of the alcohol family. Methanol is single carbon hydroxyl compound, the first member of the alcohol family. Racing industry for a long time effectively utilized methanol for its power boosting properties and its ability to burn without emitting black smoke [29]. Methanol has a high octane number, which upon blending with diesel or biodiesel effectively reduces the various emissions arising from the combustion process [30]. Apart from the higher octane number, methanol has a low price and the presence of the hydroxyl compound in its structure effectively supports the combustion process [31]. In general, the slight ignition delay during combustion is a good sign for emissions reductions and better performance of an engine due to soot reductions and shorter combustion duration. However the certain aspects of methanol such as longer ignition delay and lower cetane number complicates direct utilization of methanol in CI engine applications [32]. The research community has circumvented these drawbacks through mixing it with diesel or other biofuels through blending, emulsion or fumigation [33]. Ethanol is the one of the extensively researched member of the alcohol family. Ethanol was earlier promoted as a strong substitute for Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), since MTBE was found to be extremely toxic in nature even in small quantities [34]. However, the higher cost of production of ethanol during the 19th century considerably affected its chances for complete utilization and was considered only in case of fuel shortages [35]. In recent times, drastic developments have been made to the production methodologies providing higher yields at lower operational costs compared to the decades old production methods. With stringent emission norms and diminishing fossil fuels, emphasis on ethanol as a prospective fuel has been the frontrunner in various policies adopted by developing countries. Brazil leads the list with rampant utilization of ethanol in its fuel due to its sugarcane abundance serving as a biomass [36]. Ethanol blended fuels also exhibit remarkable absorption properties effectively cleaning the fuel distribution and delivery systems in automobiles, removing the harmful undesirable substances, which may have accumulated over time [37]. However, due to its lower flashpoints than diesel, industrial safety precautions have to be adopted in material storage and handling [38]. Propanol is the next member of the carbon family following ethanol perceived as an alternate fuel. In nature, propanol occurs in two isomers as 1-propanol and 2- propanol (otherwise known as n-propanol and isopropyl alcohol/isopropanol respectively [39]. Since the beginning, the higher production cost of propanol hindered its prospect as a substitute fuel and therefore limiting the research work carried out on it [40,41]. However, propanol trumps methanol and ethanol in certain aspects with its better solvent capabilities, lower corrosive risks and higher cetane number, calorific values due to larger carbon chain [42]. Other supportive properties of propanol include its higher energy density and flash point than its previous members of the alcohol family. Although propanol has significantly higher latent heat of vaporization than diesel, its lower self-ignition temperature reduces the ignition delay period compared to lower alcohols. Apart from its prospects as an alternate fuel, propanol is commercially utilized in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and textile industries [43,44] Butanol is the most researched member of the alcohol family, it is clear, colourless and has an characteristic banana like odour. Given its four-carbon chain structure, the –OH group can attach itself in four different positions, leading to four isomers – 1-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol and tert-butanol [45]. Soon after researching ethanol, the research community looked towards butanol to combat the solubility complications of primary alcohols and provide higher cetane number upon blending. Apart from the above advantages, butanol is less hydrophilic, toxic and corrosive than ethanol and its lower volatile nature, high flash point makes it more compatible with the existing fuel infrastructure [46,47]. In addition, the kinematic viscosity of butanol is quite close to standard diesel, which are quite desirable for fuel injection operation and lubrication of the system [48]. Compared to methanol and ethanol, butanol exhibits significantly superior combustion characteristics due to its higher heating value, lower heat of vaporization making it easier to vaporize inside the combustion chamber and trivializing the cold start complications [49]. In spite of having lower self-ignition temperature, butanol affects the fuel evaporation when blended with diesel, due to its higher latent heat of vaporization and prolongs the ignition delay, leading to fuel accumulation inside the cylinder [50]. Butanol finds application in various fields as a solvent, additive, cleaning agent, pain removers, perfumes, cosmetics etc [51]. Pentanol is straight long chain alcohol with a five-carbon structure and the research community considers it to be promising alternative fuel due to its bio-production methodology and advantages over butanol isomers [52]. Pentanol can be produced from glucose through biosynthesis using Escherichia coli and from biological pathways using engineered microbes like natural fermentation process [53,54]. These biological production methodologies require much less energy despite their longer-chain and thus make pentanol an excellent renewable alternative. Compared to butanol and other primary alcohols, pentanol stands out owing to its better blend stability, higher cetane number higher energy content and its certain properties like density, latent heat vaporization and viscosity are quite close to the standard values of diesel fuel [55]. Pentanol also acts an corrosion inhibitor, protecting the fuel delivery and supply structure, unlike ethanol and methanol [53]. In addition to the above advantages, pentanol exhibits low polar interaction parameter (δpnP: 2.2) and no cases of phase separation due to its hydrophobic nature, eliminating the unreliable aspects of blending that occurs in previous alcohols [56]. In recent to facilitate mass production of pentanol, deeper research has been carried out to study the combustion aspects of pentanol isomers through chemical kinetic modelling [57]. Hexanol comes next in the family of alcohols, a colourless liquid with long chain six-carbon structure, produced industrially through ethyl alcohol oligomerization [58]. Most of the feedstock for hexanol production comes from biodegradable agricultural wastes and beverage processing [59]. As observed with increase in carbon chain, hexanol exhibits higher blend stability, density, cetane number and energy content than the previous members of the alcohol family [60]. Similar to pentanol, its density, latent heat vaporization and viscosity are quite closer to diesel compared to primary alcohols making it a prospective alternate fuel. Hexanol is industrially used as a surfactant for micro-emulsion of diesel with lower alcohols such as ethanol and methanol [61,62]. The oxygen atom present in the hexanol structure forms a strong hydrogen bond with the ethanol making it a suitable oxygenated additive. Due to its strong affinity over diesel fuel, the hydrophobic nature of hexanol arises from its longer hydrocarbon structure and makes it a suitable co-solvent to improve the blend tolerance of water [63]. In addition, hexanol finds application as an ignition improver, flavouring additive and in lubricants, perfumes [64,65]. Octanol is an 8-cabon, long chain alcohol and it is industrially produced though oligomerization of ethylene unlike hexanol which uses ethyl alcohol [58]. Similar to other higher alcohols, octanol gained attention in the research community due to its sustainable production methodologies such as oxo-synthesis, fatty acid reduction and using bacteria etc [66,67]. Octanol is identified as a bio-derived fuel, thanks to its production source – lingo-cellulosic biomass [68] and therefore, this has prompted deep study to underline the basic combustion characteristics of octanol [69,70]. Octanol boasts a higher oxygen content of around 12.3% m/m but exhibits reduced reactivity due to its boiling point, which lies at lower end of the distillation curve of diesel [71]. However, its other properties such as higher surface tension, lower vapour pressure, higher latent heat of vaporization compensates for its low boiling point and ensures improved spray penetration. Although, octanol exhibits higher kinematic viscosity than diesel, its negative influence over air/fuel mixture formation is compensated by the combined effect of its low cetane number and low boiling point. Similar to other higher alcohols, octanol exhibits non-corrosive properties due to its less hygroscopic nature. Commercially, octanol finds application as additives, emulsifiers, anti-foaming agents, solvents, frothing agents etc [72,73]. Decanol is a clear colourless to slightly yellow liquid, carrying ten carbon atoms in its straight chain. Decanol has far more relevance in the food and chemical industry than as an alternative fuel for CI engines [74,75]. However, recent research work carried out suggest utilization of coconut as feedstock for decal production, which contains decanoic acid or from yeast such as Yarrowia lipolytica and the processes are found to be cost-effective with high yield [66,76]. Thus, the prospect of utilizing vegetable biomass and bio-resources such as lignocellulosic material, waste protein have prompted the research community to study decanol as a prospective fuel. On the properties front, the calorifc value of the decanol is higher than most of the available biodiesels and its other members of the family. Its boiling point lies in the range of diesel boiling curve and unlike diesel, decanol does not carry any aromatic structures. The most common problem of methanol and other alcohols is their poor handling properties. All kinds of alcohols could cause blatant head pains, giddiness, biliousness and more importantly skin irritation [77,78]."
2,Background and properties – nanoparticles,"Nanoparticles are the fundamental building blocks representing the blooming research sector of nanotechnology. They exist in various dimensions – different sizes between 1 and 100 nm, different shapes as in cylindrical, spherical, flat, conical, tubular etc [79]. Nanoparticles exists in all three dimensional forms as zero, one, double, three dimensional, can either be amorphous or crystalline, packed closely or loosely, made up of single or multi crystal solids [80,81]. Fig. 7 depicts various classification of nanoparticles based on structure, size, material and surface. Nanoparticles are classified based on their origin and basic chemical element forming their structure into carbon based, organic and inorganic and composite based [82]. Carbon based nanoparticles are completely composed of long chains of carbon atoms attached to each other in distinctive shapes such as spherical in fuellerens, honeycomb lattice in carbon nano tubes or conical shape in carbon nanofiber [83]. Organic nanoparticles, on the other hand, are non-toxic, biodegradable and finds application mainly in the field of medicine- as a drug delivery system, antioxidant etc [84,85]. The drastic influence of nanoparticles over the base fuel’s ignition and combustion behaviour has prompted the researchers to unearth the potential of nanoparticles as an additive. Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles that come under the branch of inorganic nanoparticles have far desirable properties on offer to the field of CI engines such as their ability to increase the reactivity, evaporation rates by acting as an oxygen buffer and improve the calorific values, thermal conductivity, viscosity of the base fuel [86,87]. Unlike alcohols, nanoparticles find application as an additive to CI engine due to its ability to enhance the thermo physical properties of the fuel [88]. Due to their nano structure, nanoparticles exhibit higher surface to volume ratio, which is a desirable property for blends utilized in CI engines as they provide larger reactive surface for the chemical process and combustion to take place [89]. On the synthesis front, improvements have been made in leaps and bounds to the two major manufacturing methodologies, top-down approach and bottom-up approach [90]. Fig. 8 represents the flow chart of various production techniques under the top-down and bottom-up approach. To prevent the settling of nanoparticles in the fuel mixture, they are usually added in emulsion form using a surfactant and a solvent. The solvent address the purpose of dissolving the nanoparticles in the fuel, while the surfactant ensure the stability of the fuel blend after mixing. This review paper comprehensively concentrates more on metal oxide nanoparticles as they exhibit exceptional properties and aid further in combating the tailpipe emissions over their metal counterparts. In fact, the research community has constantly preferred metal oxide nanoparticles over their counterparts due to the presence of additional oxygen atom, which act as an oxygen buffer in fuel rich zones reducing unburnt emissions such as HC, CO and supports the oxidation of soot nuclei, reducing the soot and smoke emissions [91]. The properties and applications of the nanoparticles discussed in this paper are tabulated in Table 2 ."
3,Objective of the present study,"3.1 Objective of the present study Given the drawbacks of direct utilization of diesel and biodiesel, plethora of research has been carried out on the prospective of various individual alcohol and nanoparticles an additive in CI engines. The alcohol family has over eight members ranging from methanol to decanol, while the nanoparticles on the other hand have been classified into metal, metal oxide, nanofluid and carbon nanotubes. Both alcohol and nanoparticle addition to the base fuel has shown remarkable improvement in both performance and emission front. Alcohol addition prevents phase separation in case of biodiesels allowing the research community to explore vast range of available biofuels. On the other hand, nanoparticles have their own unique structural and chemical properties effectively compensating the detrimental base fuel properties. Various researchers have studied the individual effect of the additive over pure diesel, pure biodiesel or diesel–biodiesel blend. Existing reviews have only documented either alcohol or nanoparticle utilization in various fuel blends but have not collectively analysed them together as additive to CI engines. Up to date, a critical review highlighting the impact of the additive properties on its performance, combustion and emission characteristics has not been carried out. Having to go through thousands of research works to understand the additive behaviour in CI engines is a cumbersome task for someone new to the research community. Motivated by the need, this review attempts to comprehensively detail the existing research work carried out on the alcohol and nanoparticle additives and critically analyse the additive property responsible for each engine characteristics corresponding to its base fuel. This critical review documents additive behaviour with standard diesel and then comparatively analyses its behaviour when blended with biodiesel/diesel–biodiesel blends. Special attention to higher alcohol is provided due to the improved yield from sustainable pathways and recent modernization of the fermentation process Compared to the lower alcohols, the higher alcohols properties are found to deeply alter and compensate for base fuel, while exhibiting better results even in lower blending concentrations. The present review has been carried out with an objective of consolidating all the findings that were available in the recent times with respect to the additive property Inorder to ensure the fundamental understanding of the impact on performance, combustion and emission characteristics of CI engine."
4,Engine emissions and combustion analysis of alcohol blended fuels,"This section comprehensively evaluates the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of alcohol-blended diesel/biodiesel in a compression ignition engine, validating the blended fuel behavior through its chemical and structural properties. Each subsection addresses the impact of alcohol member over the standard diesel or the biodiesel and comprehensively provides a summary of investigations carried out by blending the alcohol in different fuels in various diesel engines. The earlier studies on alcohols-diesel/biodiesel combinations clearly revealed that all higher alcohols whose carbon content is more than four could offer many benefits such as lower latent heat of vaporization, comparable calorific value, better flame speed and superior autoigntion quality [47]."
5,Methanol,"4.1 Methanol The oxygenate nature and the high volatility of methanol has promoted its addition to diesel and biodiesel fuel in CI engines. The higher oxygen content of methanol compensates for its lower energy content to improve its combustion characteristics. However, the lower cetane number prolongs the ignition delay resulting in poor ignition behavior and thus, hinders the complete substitution of diesel [111]. Researchers have since adopted various techniques such as alcohol fumigation, injection strategies, emulsion and blending with diesel and biofuels. Table 3 comprehensively lists the review of investigations that utilized methanol in CI engines. In general, the engine powers generated by methanol-diesel blends are comparatively lower than the standard diesel fuel. The power further decreases as the percentage of methanol added to the blend increases. The lower densities and lower calorific values of the methanol-diesel blends play a significant role in the drop in power [112]. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the methanol-diesel blends increases with an increase in engine loads. However, the lower heating value of methanol resulted in lower BTE of methanol-diesel blends compared to diesel fuel especially in constant speed conditions. On the other hand, operating the diesel engines fueled with methanol blends at higher speeds is found to be less beneficial as the BTE of the methanol blends decreases considerably when compared to operating the engines at medium speeds [113]. In general, it was also reported that many operating conditions and methods of experimentation are also have an impact of CI performance characteristics [87]. Studies have shown that blending methanol in lower quantities with biodiesels have improved BTE at higher load conditions. Higher blend ratios of methanol tend to inhibit the fuel atomization due to increased viscosity, thus recording lower values of BTE [114]. Additionally, the lower calorific value of methanol increases the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the methanol-diesel blends. Only at higher speeds, the BSFC values are closer to diesel due to higher oxygen content in higher methanol blends. Higher cylinder pressure is observed for methanol blends up to 5% in standard diesel fuel and an increased ignition delay for higher methanol blend ratios is observed due higher heat of vaporization and poor cetane number of the methanol. The higher ignition delay results in accumulation of fuel during the premixed combustion phase, leading to noisy operation of the engines fueled with higher methanol blends [115]. As expected, this ignition delay results in rightward shift of the HRR curve and the fuel accumulated provides a higher HRR in comparison to standard diesel fuel. The vaporization characteristics and inherent oxygenated nature of methanol efficiently reduces the combustion duration with increased laminar flame propagation [115]. When blended with soy biodiesel, the peak cylinder pressure is consistent with diesel values at lower speeds but decreases with higher speeds. At lower engine loads, increased ignition delay is explained due to the lower charge temperature because of lowered cylinder wall and residual gas temperature. This prolonged ignition delay results in formation of strong premixed burning phase and higher cylinder pressure. At higher engine loads, the effect of cetane number of methanol on its ignition delay becomes insignificant. On the other hand, increased methanol addition decreases the viscosity of the methanol-biodiesel mixture thus facilitating the formation of more air–fuel mixture resulting increased rates of pressure rise at higher speeds [116]. Lower C/H ratio and oxygenated nature of the methanol are the two main properties which results in lower CO emissions in CI engines. Complete combustion of the air–fuel mixture is achieved, thus facilitating the oxidation of CO in the exhaust gas. Additionally studies have shown that increasing the injection pressures and advancing the injection timing considerably reduced the CO emissions in case of methanol-diesel blends. Higher injection pressures lead to better atomization, better air–fuel mixtures and thus complete combustion. Advanced injection timing helps achieving higher in-cylinder temperature and enriched oxidation between oxygen and carbon molecules [117]. On the other hand, the same oxygenated nature of methanol and the poor cetane rating overweighs the combined influence of strong quenching effect caused by its higher heat of vaporization and the lower heating value to produce higher NOx emissions. At lower loads, the supremacy of quenching effect leads to reduced NOx at higher methanol-diesel blends. In case of methanol blending with biodiesels such as palm stearin, lower NOx than diesel is observed due to the cooling effect of methanol [118]. Lower HC emissions is observed for methanol-diesel blends when compared to standard diesel and HC emissions decreases further with increase in methanol blend ratio. This is explained by the enhanced combustion due to higher HRR and in-cylinder temperature and the nature of the methanol molecules. Polar nature of the methanol molecules challenges the molecule absorption by non-lubricating oil thus lowering the possibility of HC emissions [119]. When blended with diesel, smaller amounts of HC is observed at lower loads and increases with rise in engine load due to large quantities of fuel admitted. On contrary, when methanol is blended with biodiesel such as Karanji, the HC emissions are maximum at lower loads, and decreases with increase in engine load. This is attributed to the combined effect of lean air–fuel mixture formation at low loads and the cooling effect of methanol, which lowers the in-cylinder temperature to produce higher HC emissions [120]. Addition of methanol to diesel reduces the smoke and particular matter emissions. The oxygen molecules present in methanol oxidizes soot nuclei and the complete combustion facilitates the particulate matter reduction. The absence of carbon–carbon bonds in methanol eliminates the pyrolysis reaction, which diminishes the smoke opacity [121]. However, formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) during methanol reaction is main precursor to soot emission and this is another area of concern for methanol applications in CI engines. In case of methanol blended with biodiesel such as waste cooking oil, along with the higher oxygen content the reduction in the mass of fuel combusted during the diffusion phase plays an important role in smoke reduction [122]."
6,Ethanol,"4.2 Ethanol Ethanol is widely identified as a potential alcohol for the partial substitution in CI engines, with many developed countries implementing the policies to accommodate the usage of ethanol in commercial vehicles with various blends. Although ethanol is regarded as a good spark-ignition engine fuel owing to its higher octane number [124], the renewable nature of ethanol and its higher miscibility over methanol when blended with diesel highlights its prospective usage in CI engines. Complete substitution of diesel fuel with ethanol is hindered by the vast variation in properties between diesel and ethanol, which requires engine modification [125]. Blending ethanol with diesel is considered a feasible solution over adopting dual-fuel system in most cases since the need of another injection system is eliminated [126,127]. In addition to lack of miscibility between ethanol and diesel, limitations such as poor cold starting, auto-ignition quality, very poor inflammability at lower temperatures arise when higher quantities of ethanol are blended with diesel fuel [128,129]. Therefore, from the engine durability point of view and good results, either small quantities of ethanol are blended up to 15% in diesel fuel or ethanol is blended with surfactant /an emulsifier/ Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) [130,131]. These additives act as surface-active agent preventing the phase separation between diesel and ethanol. Table 4 comprehensively lists the review of investigations that utilized ethanol in CI engines Generally, the BTE for ethanol–diesel blends are comparatively lower than standard diesel fuel and the BTE further decreases with increase in ethanol percentage in ethanol–diesel blends. This is explained due the lower calorific value and higher viscosity of ethanol–diesel blends. As the percentage of ethanol in the blend increases, significant drop in BTE is observed due to the cooling effect of ethanol caused by its higher heat of vaporization [132]. However, in cases where the experimental setup utilizes a turbocharged engine and/or utilizes additive in its blends, BTE obtained is almost equal to or slightly higher than standard diesel fuel [133]. The effect of turbocharging coupled with formation of higher premixed combustion phase due to lower cetane number of ethanol, enables leaner and higher fraction of ‘constant volume’ combustion [124,134]. BSFC of ethanol–diesel blends are found to be higher than standard diesel fuel and tend to increase as the ethanol percentage in the blend increases. Three major characteristics that contribute to the above observation are lower calorific value, reduced energy content [135] and the advanced start of combustion in blends with higher ethanol concentration [136]. When blended with biodiesels, the overall heating value and viscosity of the ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blend or emulsions play a major part in the BSFC results [137,138]. When ethanol is blended with diesel without any additives or biodiesel, those corresponding blends indicate lower cylinder pressure in comparison to standard diesel fuel. This is attributed to the prolonged ignition delay caused by ethanol’s lower cetane number and higher latent heat of vaporization, which results in reduction of gas temperature [139,140]. However, blending with biodiesel or additives produces a higher cylinder pressure than diesel and the pressure increases with increase in the ethanol fraction. Accumulation of fuel occurs as consequence of retarded start of combustion, enabling more quantity of oxygen rich biodiesel blended fuel burned in the premixed combustion phase [141]. Lower rate of heat release is observed for ethanol–diesel blends and it increases with increase in ethanol fraction in the blends. The heat release is restrained during the prolonged ignition delay due to the hydroxyl radical (–OH) reaction consumption by the molecular weight of ethanol [142]. The disturbance in combustion activation due to high latent heat of ethanol may have also played a role in HRR reduction [143]. Blended with biodiesel, better volatility and lower viscosity of ethanol along with the ignition delay helps accumulation of fuel and achieve higher HRR during the premixed combustion phase [144,145]. Larger burning in pre-mixed mode also decreases the combustion duration in case of ethanol–diesel blended fuels [146]. The presence of water particles in emulsified form of ethanol-biodiesel/diesel blends could cause rapid evaporation and therefore enhancement of fine droplet formation might take place. This would strengthen the superior mixing of fuel particles with air inside the combustion chamber. This process could accelerate the burning of fuel particles inside the combustion chamber which is also known to be as micro-explosion phenomenon [147]. On the emission characteristics, the CO emissions of ethanol–diesel blends rise with increase in fraction of ethanol in the blend. When the ethanol fraction is higher, incomplete combustion arises due to lower cetane number and higher heat of vaporization [132].The speed at which the engine is operated also plays a crucial role in determining whether the emissions are higher or lower when compared to standard diesel fuel. At lower rpms, the advantage of operating the engines in ‘leaner’ mixture is assisted by the incidence of oxygen molecules in ethanol in locally rich zones, facilitating complete combustion, lower CO emissions [148]. At higher rpms, the higher ethanol ratio slows down the biofuel transition from liquid phase to gas phase and incomplete combustion arises due to lack of chemical reaction time, producing higher CO emissions [149]. In ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends, the emissions are strongly depended upon the biofuel fraction in the blend and the engine operating conditions [150]. In certain cases, the oxygen content of blends increases the oxygen-to-fuel ratio in fuel, assists complete combustion and reduces CO emissions [151,152]. In other cases, the vaporization cooling effect of ethanol dominates, causing a thick flame quenching layer and this coupled with lower burning velocity [153] and combustion temperature produces excess of CO [154]. The same factors of engine operating conditions and blend mixed dictate the NOx emissions in case of diesel-ethanol and diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blends. When blended with diesel alone, the cooling effect and lower calorific value of ethanol counterbalances the opposing effect of cetane number and oxygen concentration (which produces higher temperatures in kinetic phase) to emit lower NOx [155]. For blends with biodiesel concentration, the overall cetane number and oxygen concentration prolongs the ignition delay and dominates the inherent ethanol properties to produce a steep rise in HRR, in-cylinder temperature at start of combustion forming higher NOx concentrations [156]. HC emissions are higher for ethanol-diesel blends compared to standard diesel fuel and the emission increases with rise in ethanol percentage in ethanol-diesel blends. Various reasons such as inhomogeneity of blends [157], higher heat of evaporation of ethanol [158,159], flame quenching due to cooling effect or observed phenomena of cyclic irregularity in higher ethanol concentrated blends [160] are cited for higher HC emissions. However when blended with biodiesel, in most cases lower HC emissions were observed with higher cetane number and oxygen molecules of biodiesel [130,161] help sustain the flame propagation all the shortening the ignition delay to improve the efficiency of combustion and post flame oxidation process [162]. In certain diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blends, higher HC emissions were observed and the greater ignition delays, difficulty to produce homogenous blends due to ethanol dispersion in combustion chamber [156,162] are cited as the reasons for the same. Smoke opacity for ethanol–diesel blends is comparatively lower than standard diesel fuel and the emissions rise with increase in load but remain lower than diesel. The existence of rich fuel core is observed at high loads due to longer injection delay but the presence of an oxidizer in the form of ethanol, suppresses the soot formation [163,163]. The other reasons stated are the higher oxygen content, lower aromatic fraction and C/H ratio, non-provision of initial radicals by ethanol for aromatic ring formation [164]. Blended with diesel-biodiesel, lower smoke and PM emissions are observed and the quantity decreases as the ethanol fraction in the blend increases. This is explained by the ability of oxygenates in the fuel blends to support complete combustion in the pyrolysis zone of burning diesel, thus reducing PM emissions [165]."
7,Propanol,"4.3 Propanol Methanol and Ethanol tend to exhibit higher affinity towards water and its miscibility problems with diesel [174,175] have made researchers explore propanol as a suitable additive. However, most of the research works carried out have concentrated on utilizing propanol as a solvent in ternary blends rather direct blending with diesel in spite of having better properties [176]. Table 5 comprehensively lists the review of investigations that utilized propanol in CI engines Generally, it is observed that addition of propanol to diesel increases the BTE and BTE rises with increase in propanol fraction in the blends. Alcohol blending decrease the cetane number and density of the blends, thus increasing the ignition delay period and improving he spray characteristics, leading to higher BTE [177]. Another supporting explanation is provided by the higher premixed combustion of the blends due to their lower overall cetane number, resulting in higher combustion percentage at constant volume [178]. Higher BTE is observed when blended with biodiesel-diesel and is explained due to inherent oxygen content of the biodiesels in the blend and the higher laminar flame speed [179]. BSFC for propanol-diesel blends are lower than standard diesel and it reduces further with increase in propanol fraction in the blend. Higher volatility and lower viscosity of propanol in the blends improves the vaporization and spray characteristics leading to efficient combustion and lower BSFC [180]. On the other hand, BSFC values for propanol-biodiesel blends are higher than standard diesel. Various reasons such as lower heating values, lower calorific values, and overall density of the blends are listed as the reasons for increased BSFC consumption so that the engine can continue to deliver the same power output [181]. Higher cylinder pressure is observed for propanol-diesel blends when compared to standard diesel fuel. Lower cetane number and higher latent heat of vaporization of propanol-diesel blends [182] induce a cooling effect inside the cylinder and delay the ignition of fuel. Prolonged ignition delay leads to burning of accumulated fuel in premixed combustion phase to produce higher cylinder pressures [183]. Limited research work on the combustion characteristics of propanol-biodiesel blends has been carried out with higher cost of propanol production hindering research. Usually in these blends, the cylinder pressure is highly dependent on alcohol fraction in blend as higher cetane number of biodiesel reduces the peak pressure of blend whereas alcohol addition rises the peak pressure to lower inherent cetane number [184]. HRR for propanol-diesel blends are higher than standard diesel and increases with higher propanol fraction in the blends. Rapid combustion due to longer ignition delay lowers the combustion duration and produces higher HRR during premixed combustion phase [183]. A delay is also observed in attaining maximum HRR due to the quenching effect and higher latent heat of vaporization of alcohol [185]. In case of propanol-biodiesel-diesel blends, it depends on the ability of the biodiesel to form better air–fuel mixture to produce higher HRR than pure biodiesel [186]. The presence of oxygen in propanol aids combustion process and significantly reduces the CO emission at higher loads in propanol-diesel blends. At lower and medium loads, higher latent heat vaporization of propanol also lowers the operating temperature and increases CO emission [187]. Density and viscosity of the biodiesel in the propanol-biodiesel-diesel blends and the engine load play a major role in determining the CO emissions [188]. NOx emissions for propanol-diesel blends are lower than standard diesel and it decreases with increase in propanol fraction in the blends. Cooling effect caused by the higher latent heat of vaporization of propanol lowers the combustion temperature, thus reducing NOx emissions [189]. Similar results were observed when propanol is blended with biodiesel-diesel and in addition to the cooling effect of methanol, the oxygen content of biodiesel also aids in NOx reduction [190]. HC emissions are higher for propanol-diesel blends and increase with rise in the propanol fraction in the blend. The difference in HC emissions between diesel and propanol-diesel blends is comparatively higher in lower and medium loads but the gap reduces at higher loads. This is explained by the development of quenching layer which reduces the in-cylinder temperature, slows down vaporization process and results in poor mixing of air–fuel mixture [191]. Other reasons listed for higher HC emissions include lower viscosity, increased delay period and lower cetane number [185]. The combustion of propanol-diesel blends could enhances the premixing process due to longer ignition delay and therefore lower soot emissions [183]. Furthermore, the oxygen enrichment of propanol promotes the lean burn operation which leads to lower soot formation. The later reason is proposed again for lower smoke emissions in propanol-biodiesel-diesel blends along with the presence of less carbon atoms in biodiesel [192]. Soot formations in these blends are lower than diesel and decreases further with increase in propanol percentage in blend. Presence of hydroxyl group in the chemical structure of propanol actively oxidizes the particular matter and thus reducing soot formation [193]."
8,Butanol,"4.4 Butanol Among the higher alcohols, researchers have paid a large attention to butanol utilization in CI engines most due to its superior properties and ease of transportation. Compared to lower alcohols, Butanol has higher cetane number, higher heating value, higher miscibility factor in diesel, higher energy content compared to lower alcohols. The hydrophobic nature of butanol enables transportation and distribution of fuel in the existing infrastructure unlike ethanol, which has stronger affinity for moisture and corrosive nature inside the fuel pipeline [198]. In addition, butanol easily blends with diesel without having to deal with the phase separation problems as observed in lower alcohols, eliminating the need of emulsifiers or co-solvents [199]. Table 6 comprehensively lists the review of investigations that utilized butanol in CI engines On the performance front, the effective power of butanol-diesel blends are comparatively lower than standard diesel fuel and decreases with increase in butanol percentage in the blend. Lower energy content and heating values of n-butanol compared to diesel fuel are the reasons stated for lower effective power [200]. The before-mentioned reasons along with higher viscosity of butanol-biodiesel-diesel blends are stated for lower brake power and torque compared to standard diesel fuel. Higher viscosity of the ternary blends makes injection of fuel difficult and results in poor atomization [201]. The higher oxygen content and latent heat of evaporation lowers the air–fuel mixture temperature inside the combustion chamber, thus contributing to lower brake power and torque than pure biodiesel and diesel [202,203]. Higher BTE is observed for butanol-diesel blends compared to standard diesel and the efficiency rises with increase in butanol fraction in the blend. Oxygen content of butanol helps in complete combustion during the diffusion combustion phase while the lower cetane number of the blends prolongs the ignition delay, burning larger fraction of the fuel during premixed mode [204]. In addition, laminar burning velocities of butanol is higher than standard diesel fuel and is stated contributing to the higher BTE [205]. On the other hand, lower BTE is observed for ternary blends containing biodiesel and the overall viscosity and lower heating value of the blend are the proposed to be the contributing factors for lower combustion efficiency [206]. Lower heating value and calorific value of butanol has to be compensated by additional fuel consumption to provide the same torque output as given by standard diesel, and therefore butanol-diesel blends have higher BSFC [207]. Lower cetane number of the ternary blends elongates the ignition delay, which retards the start of combustion leading to higher amount of fuel physically present for the chemical reaction [208]. Similar observations and reasons are stated when butanol is blended with biodiesel-diesel [206,209,210]. The lower cetane number of butanol plays a major role in the combustion characteristics. This inherent property prolongs the ignition delay of butanol-diesel blends longer than standard diesel fuel [211]. The ignition delay increases with increase in butanol fraction in the blend and this prolonged ignition delay reduces the combustion duration due to improved combustion efficiency. However, as butanol fraction in blend is increased, overall cetane number of the blend is lowered and a limiting point is achieved beyond which butanol addition would result in hard start of the engine [212]. Therefore, it is advisable to blend butanol only up to 20% in standard diesel. In-cylinder pressure of butanol-diesel blends are closer but slightly lower than standard diesel fuel and it decreases as the alcohol content increases. Despite higher ignition delay and fuel content in the combustion chamber, the in-cylinder temperature is slightly lower than diesel due to higher latent heat of evaporation [213] and later combustion in a lower-temperature environment counteracts the translation into higher pressure [211]. Upon addition of butanol to biodiesel-diesel blends, cylinder pressure higher than standard diesel is observed. One reason stated is the activation of intrinsic oxygen in butanol by the added biodiesel. The other validation stated is the overall rise in density and cetane number due to biodiesel addition, which forms a stronger premixed combustion phase to provide higher cylinder pressure [214]. HRR for butanol-biodiesel-blends are higher than standard diesel and the HRR is higher at lower speeds as they provide higher residence time in the combustion chamber. The combined effect of lower boiling point, oxygenate nature of butanol and lower cetane number of the blend enhances the mixing ability to obtain a slightly steeper HRR value during the premixed phase which rises with increase in butanol fraction [211]. In case of ternary blends, the low compressibility of biodiesel, oxygenate nature of the blend shortens the combustion duration to provide higher HRR than standard diesel. Moreover, the reduced cetane number prolongs the auto ignition duration, leads to fuel accumulation in premixed phase to provide higher HRR [215]. CO emissions for butanol-diesel blends are comparatively lower than standard diesel and tend to decrease further with increase in butanol fraction in the blend. The higher oxygen content of n-butanol promotes the oxidation process of CO into carbon dioxide and thus lower CO emissions [216,217].The CO emissions are observed to be higher at lower engine speed and decreases as the engine speed increases. Higher air–fuel charge mixture is admitted at higher speeds and the presence of abundant oxidant (air) enables complete combustion of fuel, producing carbon dioxide as byproduct rather than CO [218]. At lower loads, CO oxidations are hindered due to drop in cylinder temperature caused by the latent heat absorption lean fuel mixture to combust [211]. CO emissions in butanol-biodiesel-diesel blends are dependent on the percentage of butanol concentration in the ternary blend and are observed to decrease with increase in butanol fraction. Lower density of butanol eases the fuel blend evaporation process in the cylinder and thereby reducing the spray penetration length, improving mixing process reducing the CO emissions [219,220]. When these ternary blends have higher concentration of biodiesel than butanol, higher CO emissions are observed due to the higher density and viscosity of biodiesel affecting the ignition delay and spray characteristics leading to poor quality combustion [221,222]. NOx emissions in butanol-diesel blends are heavily dependent on engine specifications, operating conditions [127] and can be correlated properly in multi-zone models [223-225]. Generally, NOx emissions of butanol-diesel blends are slightly lower than standard diesel and decreases further with increase in butanol fraction. Higher heat of evaporation and lower calorific value of butanol induces the cooling effect in the cylinder and reduces NOx emissions. The dominating cooling effect opposes the higher in-cylinder temperature during premixed combustion phase caused by lower cetane number and prolonged ignition delay [204,216,226]. Similar reasons are stated for higher NOx emissions in ternary blends and are found to be lower only when higher butanol concentration in blend crosses the threshold to outweigh the demerits of lower cetane number and longer ignition delay [221,227]. HC emissions for butanol-diesel blends are observed to be higher than standard diesel and increases with increase in butanol fraction. Reasons stated include slower evaporation caused by higher heat of evaporation of butanol thus resulting in poor air–fuel mixture, increased spray penetration [216]. This result in unwanted fuel impingement on the combustion chamber, causing flame quenching and cushioning in the ring land areas. This phenomenon is known as “lean-outer-flame-zone” and beyond this zone the fuel ignition fails to occur since it is out of the lean flammability limit [217]. Another factor stated is the reduction in viscosity and increase in volatility of the blends as butanol is added to diesel, which results in micro-explosions of the fuel injected leading to over-mixing of the fuel [228]. Similar to CO emissions, the HC emissions in ternary blends are higher or lower depending on the concentration of butanol and biodiesel. Blends with higher butanol fraction emit lower HC emissions, while those with higher biodiesel fraction emit higher HC emissions. Oxygenate nature of butanol helps complete combustion of the air–fuel mixture to reduce the HC emissions. On contrary, higher density and viscosity of biodiesel deteriorate the spray characteristics and fuel atomization forming larger diameter of fuel droplets [229]. Increased droplet diameter decreases the rate of evaporation, delays the ignition and affects the cylinder heat-up, leading to higher HC emissions [230]. The engine speed is also indicated as one of the major factors influencing HC emissions, with the value higher at lower speeds. It is explained by the extremely slow air swirling at lower rpms, prolonging the ignition delay, thus forming an overrich mixture and quenching of combustion reaction at chamber walls [208,231]. Smoke and soot emissions for butanol-diesel blends are found to be lower than standard diesel and the opacity reduces with increasing butanol content in the blends. The reason attributed to the lower smoke opacity is the moderation of precursor production by bonded oxygen atoms from the hydroxyl group of butanol and the lower carbon content [204,211]. PM emissions are also found to be lower than standard diesel, with butanol addition delivering oxygen molecules directly to the pyrolysis zone of the burning diesel suppressing soot emissions [232]. Similar results were observed when blended with biodiesel-diesel, with the biodiesel and butanol addition dilutes aromatics concentrations which are soot precursors [233-235]."
9,Pentanol,"4.5 Pentanol Pentanol has exhibited great potential as a viable component to blend with diesel. This five-carbon straight chain alcohol has better blending stability, higher cetane number and higher energy density than all the lower alcohols and even butanol. The ease of production [244] and corrosion inhibitor properties of pentanol [245] has attracted several researchers to study it combustion phenomena. Table 7 comprehensively lists the review of investigations that utilized methanol in CI engines On the performance front, contradicting results for BTE in propanol-diesel blends is observed. Some studies have shown lowered BTE for propanol-diesel blends than standard diesel and suggested it decreases further with increase in propanol fraction, due to the lower energy content of propanol than diesel [246]. Some have shown higher BTE than standard diesel and higher propanol fraction increases the BTE, but ANOVA and control tests indicate the BTE performance is not related to the propanol fraction in the blend [247,248]. The reasons suggested include higher combustion efficiency by oxygen presence, lower boiling point of methanol and higher ignition delay, which causes rapid energy release, prevents heat loss from cylinder to coolant [126]. Another study shows that the BTE of the propanol-diesel blends were lower than diesel since their thermal value is comparatively less than diesel and higher heating value of propanol negatively affects the combustion efficiency but the BTE is found to rise when the butanol fraction in the blend is increased [249]. The only other factors which address this discrepancy is the compression ratio and speed of the engine that is found to be different in each case and therefore detailed study on the impact of varying compression ratio, speed of the engine on propanol-diesel blends is required. Similarly observations are observed in pentanol-biodiesel-diesel blend, with some crediting higher cetane number, viscosity, lower heating value of the blends for lower BTE [250,251], while others cite accessibility of fuel-bound oxygen content, shorter combustion duration and higher HRR [252,253]. Higher BSFC than standard diesel is observed in both pentanol-diesel and pentanol-biodiesel-diesel blends and increases with higher pentanol fraction in the blend. Higher heat of vaporization of pentanol causes cooling effect to reduce combustion efficiency and lower calorific value of the blends results in low heat combustion, therefore higher quantities of the fuel to be burned to maintain the same power output if the engine was running on diesel [254,255]. Longer ignition delay and ignition distance than standard diesel is observed upon pentanol addition to pure diesel under all experimental conditions, which is influenced by the higher latent heat of evaporation and lower cetane number of pentanol suppressing the spray ignition [256]. The peak in-cylinder pressure increases with the engine load and the ignition delay increases with higher propanol fraction in the blend. The in-cylinder pressure is slightly lower than diesel upon pentanol addition at low loads, but the in-cylinder pressure rises on increases propanol fraction at medium and higher loads. The first case is explained by conflicting factors, one delays combustion further into the expansion stroke due to the higher latent heat of evaporation of propanol, whereas the prolonged ignition delay causes the higher fuel accumulation and burning in the premixed mode [248]. This leads to insignificant decrease in the peak pressure at lower loads but higher in-cylinder temperature weakens the cooling effect of propanol at medium and higher loads, thus increasing cylinder pressure. Pentanol blends tend to ignite more homogeneously since their cool-flame chemiliminesence is relatively larger than standard diesel. The non-combustion spray images indicate pentanol addition enhance the air entrainment capacity and better mixing of air–fuel inside the combustion chamber [256]. In certain cases, lower in-cylinder pressure than standard diesel is observed for ternary blends having biodiesel constituting the major fraction due to the higher cetane number of biodiesel overcoming the effect of lower cetane number of alcohol in the blend and lower calorific value of the blend [257]. Thus, the overall higher cetane number of the blend decreases the ignition delay period by improving the fuel evaporation rate causing less fuel combustion in premixed phase [248]. Poor atomization of the biodiesel fraction in the blend caused by its higher atomic weight is also suggested to reduce the cylinder pressure [258]. On the other hand, higher cylinder pressure is observed for pentanol-biodiesel-diesel blends, which has diesel as its major fraction and pentanol addition aids combustion during the premixed combustion phase [259]. Lower viscosity and higher volatile nature of the pentanol facilitates higher admission of air–fuel mixture during premixed combustion phase [260]. HRR for propanol-diesel blends are found to be higher than standard diesel and the higher HRR values are explained by the longer ignition delay, which causes larger quantity of fuel to burned in the premixed combustion phase [248]. During the operation of engine at low and medium loads – oxygen lean conditions, the formation of aldehydes QOOH from the reaction of alpha fuel radical with oxygen is hindered [261]. Therefore, the combustion process in the engine retards as a necessity for chain-branching reaction admitting more fuel to be combusted in a shorter combustion duration. Since, the thermodynamic cycle of this process inside the engine is close to constant volume cycle - rapid combustion, higher thermal efficiency and HRR is observed [256]. In case of ternary blends, maximum HRR values are lower during the premixed combustion phase, but the value is higher than standard diesel during the diffusion phase. Higher molecular weight, lower rate of vaporization, higher viscosity and lower burning velocity of biodiesel causes lower HRR of the blends during premixed combustion phase [248]. Better air–fuel mixing is achieved post the start of combustion in the mixed controlled region, to release higher heat than standard diesel [252]. CO emissions for pentanol-diesel blends are found to be higher than standard diesel and increase with increase in pentanol fraction in the blend. The cooling effect of pentanol due to the higher latent heat of vaporization decreases the in-cylinder temperature and promotes CO emission [246]. On contrary, lower CO emissions are observed in ternary blends which have biodiesel has major fraction and is found to decrease with increase in percentage of pentanol in the blend. This is explained by the higher oxygen presence in the blends with major biodiesel fraction, which facilitates fuel–air mixing process and complete combustion [250]. NOx emissions are lower in pentanol-diesel blends except at high engine loads and decreases with increase in pentanol fraction. The higher latent of vaporization and lower cetane number of pentanol lowers the in-cylinder temperature to reduce thermal NOx formation [246]. However at higher loads, the dominating influence of oxygen and lowered cetane number of blend due to pentanol addition extends the ignition delay period which admits larger fuel droplets in the premixed combustion phase leading to elevated temperatures of combustion and higher NOx emissions [248]. In addition to the above reasons, higher atomic weight, bulk modulus and viscosity of the ternary blend and high volatility of pentanol are stated as the reasons for higher NOx emissions [232,262]. HC emissions are higher in pentanol-diesel blends than standard diesel and increases with rise in pentanol fraction. The lowered centane number of the blend upon pentanol addition prolongs the ignition delay period and provides more time for vaporization, broader lean outer lame zone for higher HC emissions [248]. HC emissions in ternary blends depends on the biodiesel percentage in the blends. The biodiesel percentage determines the droplet diameter, evaporation rate, density and viscosity of the blend to produce higher or lower HC emissions by dominating the effect of oxygen molecules [229,230]. Particulate matter and smoke emissions in of pentanol-diesel blends are found to be lower than standard diesel fuel and decreases further with increase in pentanol fraction in the blend. Oxygen presences, lower C–H ratio, cetane number of pentanol are the few reasons stated for lower emissions. Through chemical kinetic modeling, it is found that carbon atom attached to the oxygen atom in such oxygenate blends cannot contribute to soot emission [263]. Similar results were observed for ternary blends and in addition to the reasons stated above, the lower sulfur content and impurities in the biodiesel are also credited for the decrement in smoke emissions [264]."
10,Other higher alcohols,"4.6 Other higher alcohols Alcohols containing over five carbon atoms in their chemical structure : Hexanol, Octanol and Decanol, are collectively discussed under this section as they possess quite similar chemical properties and have similar effects upon blending with the base fuel. The above mentioned alcohols possess higher energy and oxygen content than their members of the family and furthermore, the higher carbon content ensures low polarity and better solvent capabilities with biodiesel and diesel [265]. Therefore, these higher alcohols have received dedicated attention from the research community to identify its prospects as an alternate fuel. Hexanol was first utilized in ternary blends as an ignition improver or oxygenated additive, especially in the lower alcohol-biodiesel/diesel blends, which lacked the spontaneous ignition characteristics, lower heat release capability due to their higher viscosity and lower energy content [266]. Hexanol is extensively used in ethanol blends, as they not only serve the purpose of ignition improver and oxygenated additive, but also ensures blend stability at ethanol concentrations as the oxygen atom in hexanol forms a strong hydrogen bond with ethanol structure [173]. Similarly, octanol started out as an surface-active agent for blending with other alcohols in combustion engines [267], but later on gained attention due to its promising derived cetane number (33.1) and higher oxygen content (~12.3% m/m) than other lower alcohols [71]. Currently, decanol does not exhibit much relevance in the alternate fuel track, since the commercial production process is still in the budding stage. However, decanol is expected to play a significant role in the alternate fuel industry in the near future thanks to its superior chemical properties and structure. Table 8 comprehensively lists the review of investigations that utilized the above-mentioned higher alcohols in CI engines. On the performance front, alcohol addition to diesel/biodiesel blends is found to improve their BTE and further improves for higher concentration of alcohol in the blend. Generally, alcohol addition to diesel reduces their calorific value and viscosity lowering their BTE [268], but in case of higher alcohols, the higher oxygen content and lowered cetane number collectively extends the premixed combustion duration to allow maximum combustion at constant volume and leaner conditions, lowering the heat losses [269]. Therefore, BTE values for hexanol/octanol/decanol blended fuels are found to be higher than the base fuel and same can be explained to ternary blends, where the drop in calorific value and viscosity of diesel is compensated by the base biodiesel. The BSFC of higher-alcohol blended fuel majorly depends upon the difference in calorific value between the blend and standard diesel. Hexanol blended diesel has significant drop in their calorific value resulting in increased fuel consumption than standard diesel [270], hexanol blended biodiesel exhibit reduced fuel consumption than pure biodiesel due to its increased energy content. On the other hand, the difference in calorific values between diesel and octanol/decanol-blended diesel is insignificant and the higher oxygen content promotes better combustion efficiency to exhibit lower BSFC than standard diesel [269]. On the combustion front, hexanol/octanol/decanol addition to diesel/biodiesel substantially improves their cylinder pressure and heat release rate. At higher alcohol concentrations, lower cetane number fuel prolongs the ignition delay thus allowing larger fuel accumulation in the premixed combustion phase [271]. Therefore, a larger heat release rate and cylinder pressure is obtained in shorter combustion duration as higher fraction of fuel is burnt during this phase [272]. On the other hand in lower alcohol concentrations, all higher alcohols are oxygenated fuels promoting earlier auto-ignition of the fuel, shortening the ignition delay, but oxidation ability of hexanol/octanol/decanol still manages to provide higher cylinder pressure and HRR than standard diesel [273]. CO emissions depend upon the amount of oxygen content present in the base fuel and combustion, ignition characteristics of the fuel. While higher alcohols like hexanol, octanol, decanol have poor ignition, evaporation characteristics, coupled with their higher carbon content, higher CO emissions are expected from these alcohol blended fuels. However, the opposite is observed due to the ability of hexanol/octanol/decanol to act as an oxygen buffer and support complete combustion of the unburnt emissions into carbon dioxide, thereby emitting lower CO than standard diesel fuel [274]. The CO emissions decrease further with increase in the alcohol concentration in the blend and in case of ternary blends containing biodiesel, the CO emission values are further reduced as they are naturally oxygen rich base fuels. At the same time, higher alcohol addition to diesel/biodiesel reduces the NOx emissions and the decrease in emissions increases with higher blending concentrations of alcohol [275,276]. The higher heat of evaporation, lower energy content and improved fuel atomization due to lower viscosity of alcohol dominates the influence of higher ignition delay, to sustain a low temperature combustion inside the engine cylinder, lowering the NOx emissions [277]. The higher heat of evaporation of hexanol/octanol/decanol brings about a quenching effect inside the combustion chamber to lower the in-cylinder temperature [278]. HC emissions for hexanol/octanol/decanol blended fuels majorly depend on the engine operating conditions, viscosity and spray characteristics of the overall blend as air–fuel mixing properties or flame quenching near cylinder walls determine the extent of complete combustion [212]. Higher alcohol addition is generally reduces the HC emissions at first due to its reduced viscosity and vaporization characteristics, but increase in alcohol percentage tends to either increase or decrease the HC emissions based on the dominance of ignition delay, viscosity, density and fuel atomization properties [279]. Smoke emissions significantly decrease upon addition of hexanol/octanol/decanol to the base fuel due to presence of oxygen atoms in the structure and it further decreases for increase in percentage of alcohol blending. In case of long chain alcohols, the carbon atom is strongly bonded to the oxygen atoms with a high energy, thereby making it difficult to break them and prevent the formation of soot precursors [269]."
11,Engine emissions and combustion analyses of nanoadditive blended fuels,"This section critically evaluates the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of nanoparticle-blended diesel/biodiesel in a compression ignition engine, validating the blended fuel behavior through its physical and chemical properties. Each subsection addresses the impact of nanoparticle over the standard diesel or the biodiesel and comprehensively provides a summary of investigations carried out by blending the nanoparticle in different fuels in various diesel engines at different concentrations."
12,Aluminum oxide (Alumina),"5.1 Aluminum oxide (Alumina) Aluminum Oxide nanoparticle has acted as perfect combustion catalyst reducing the pollutant emissions while improving the combustion behavior. Larger quantum of the alumina addition are oriented towards addition to diesel–biodiesel blends since they provide lower emissions than standard diesel in most cases. Table 9 comprehensively summarizes the literature findings on Aluminium oxide usage as an additive in CI engines. Addition of alumina to standard diesel acts as an oxygen buffer, promoting complete combustion and thus producing higher BTE than standard diesel [280]. BTE for alumina added diesel is found to increase with higher dosing level of the nanoparticle. Same case is observed for the biodiesel-diesel blends with alumina addition, with higher BTE than standard diesel. Apart from the oxygen buffer, the nanoparticle also helps in micro-explosion of the primary droplet and providing higher evaporation rate [281]. Fuel consumption is also found to be lower for diesel with alumina nanoparticles since the alumina addition promotes physical characteristics of the fuel and improves the atomization, combustion characteristics of the diesel [282]. Similarly, in biodiesel-diesel blends with alumina, BSFC is found to be lower than standard diesel. It is suggested that the nanoparticle addition ameliorates the catalytic effect by enhancing the surface area/volume ratio of the blend and thus reducing fuel consumption [283]. The in-cylinder pressure is observed to increase upon addition of alumina to diesel and it is explained by the decrease in ignition delay causing early initiation of combustion of the fuel accumulated in the premixed combustion phase [280]. Similarly, in-cylinder and peak pressure is higher for alumina blended biodiesel-diesel than standard diesel and is found to increase with higher dosing of the nanoparticle. The catalytic behavior, higher surface area exposure of the alumina and the oxygen content of the biodiesel helps achieving higher rate of pressure rise and cylinder pressure during the combustion process [281,284]. Nanoparticle addition has also helped in improving the fuel droplet evaporation, achieve better air–fuel mixing. The addition of alumina nanoparticles is found to decrease the ignition delay in both diesel and biodiesel-diesel due to the higher thermal conductivity and surface area to volume ratio, which enhances evaporation rate, and reduction in physical delay [284]. HRR is observed to be higher when alumina particles are added to the fuels and is attributed to the ignition and heat conduction properties of the alumina nanoparticles [285]. Lower exhaust gas temperature is observed when the fuel is blended with alumina particles by reducing the formation of rich mixture zone in the diffusion mechanism [286]. CO emissions occur due to incomplete combustion of the mixture inside the combustion chamber and is found to decrease when diesel is blended with alumina nanoparticles. The CO emissions are found to be decrease with increase in the nanoparticle dosing. Alumina nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed due to their catalytic activity, which improves the air–fuel mixing and better combustion [282]. This complete combustion and oxygen buffer of nanoparticles ensures oxidation of the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. Similar results are observed when alumina is blended with biodiesel-diesel and is further aided by the rich oxygen content of the biodiesel [287]. NOx emissions are lower than standard diesel for those blended with alumina nanoparticles, and decrease further when the dosing level of nanoparticle is higher. The reasons stated is that alumina nanoparticle supports complete combustion due to greater oxygen availability, higher surface area and catalytic properties reduces the in-cylinder temperature and hence lower NOx emissions [282]. Alumina nanoparticles aids the combustion process by forming final heterogeneous combustion products with minimum thermal breakdown of hydrocarbon compounds, thus limiting the possibility of thermal NOx formation from lower active radicals [284,288]. In some cases of blending with biodiesel-diesel, higher NOx emissions are observed due to shorter ignition delay and peak pressure associated with the biodiesel combustion during the diffusion phase [289]. These biodiesel-oriented properties sometimes overcompensates the positive effect of nanoparticles to produce higher NOx emissions. Smoke emissions are lowered when alumina nanoparticles are added to fuel blend and is explained due to its ignition characteristics, shorter ignition delay and quick evaporation rate [285,289]. The presence of alumina aids the secondary atomization process during the transesterification, forming a homogeneous air–fuel mixture inside the cylinder [290]. Injection timing is found to be play a decisive role in the effect of nanoparticles in fuel blends. Advancing the injection timing (27 deg bTDC) from standard injection timing (23 deg bTDC) is found to increase in-cylinder pressure, HRR, combustion duration while reducing BSFC, ignition delay. Advancing injection timing helps improving the performance and combustion characteristics, while retarding the injection timing (19 deg bTDC) helps meet the emission norms by reducing HC, CO, CO2, NOx and smoke [291]."
13,Cerium oxide (Ceria),"5.2 Cerium oxide (Ceria) Cerium oxide is the most abundant element in the rare earth family with cross-over efficiency which between trivalent and tetravalent states undergoes redox cycling. It has good thermal stability, high catalytic activity due to its high surface-to-volume ratio. Table 10 comprehensively summarizes the literature findings on Cerium oxide usage as an additive in CI engines. Addition of cerium oxide nanoparticles to diesel is found to increase the thermal efficiency and simultaneously decrease the fuel consumption. Cerium oxide reduces the physical delay and fuel evaporation time, the intensified thermal transmissibility property of the nanoparticles accelerates the chain reactions in the combustion stage. The inherent oxygen content promotes cerium oxide as a catalyst to burn completely and rapidly, produce higher BTE [300]. BSFC is found to decrease further as the dosing level on cerium oxide increases. Cerium oxide effectively disperses the fuel in the combustion chamber, promoting higher penetration length of the fuel spray and thus reducing the fuel consumption [301]. Usual temperature between the piston head and chamber wall varies between 200 deg C and 500 deg, which lies between the activation temperature of cerium oxide to oxidize the carbon deposits and yield lower BSFC [302]. Although, higher cerium oxide dosage increases the agglomeration probability to rise the influence of catalytic behavior, optimum level of dosing should be carried out. Adding cerium oxide beyond the optimum level, increases the viscosity of fuel thereby increasing the diameter of fuel droplet during the spray atomization and causing higher fuel consumption [301]. In certain biodiesel though, the higher density and lower calorific value of the biodiesel plays a degrading effect over the positive values of nanoparticles, to improve the performance but not sufficient enough to produce higher BTE and lower BSFC than standard diesel [303,304]. Advancing the fuel injection is found to compensate the slow vaporization characteristics of cerium oxide blended fuels and higher injection pressure provides proper air–fuel mixing for higher BTE and lower BSFC [305]. Gradual increase in the in-cylinder pressure is observed when diesel is dosed with cerium oxide and the pressure rises with higher level of dosing of the ceria nanoparticle. It is attributed to the intrinsic catalytic combustion and air fuel mixing supported by the ceria nanoparticles. It is also suggested that thermal conductivity of diesel improves upon nanoparticle addition due to its small size and large surface-volume ratio [300]. Studies show that cerium nanoparticles support phenomenon known as micro-explosion when added with diesel in cylinders operating at high temperatures [306]. During this period, the droplets of fuel gets super-heated and swollen with the nanoparticles forming layers. This is followed by a drastic vaporization event known as micro-explosion, which shortens the physical preparation period by forming ultrafine granularities from secondary atomization of fuel [307]. Fig. 9 illustrates the step-by-step process of micro-explosion when cerium oxide is blended with diesel fuel. Another study shows that the excellent redox ability of cerium oxide plays a positive role in dehydrogenation at higher temperatures to form OH– active radicals to support spontaneous combustion [308]. However, in case of dosing with biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel blends, lowered in-cylinder pressure than standard diesel is observed for ceria nanoparticles. The theory suggested is that the improved ignition properties of ceria initiates the combustion process much earlier by shortening the ignition delay and when this happens lower quantity of fuel is admitted to inside the combustion chamber, thus lowered pressure [309,310]. As mentioned earlier, although nanoparticle addition effectively boosts the physical and chemical preparations before the ignition by its excellent flammability [311], it reduces the ignition delay and thus reduces heat release rate in both diesel and biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel blends. The higher thermal conductivity of the ceria nanoparticles is suggested to absorb heat release and engine cylinder temperature during premixed combustion phase [304]. The micro-explosions which occur due to ceria addition, improves the atomization and turbulence in the air–fuel mixture, thereby reducing cyclic dispersions and combustion duration to produce lower HRR [310–312] (Fig. 10 ). Cerium oxide has the unique property of acting as both a reductant and oxidant by extracting or adding oxygen between the valence states. Addition of ceria nanoparticle is found to decrease CO emissions and the values obtained are lower than standard diesel, decrease with increase in engine speed. The emissions are found to decrease further with higher dosing levels of ceria nanoparticles. CO emission mostly arise in diesel since sufficient oxygen content is not available for complete combustion into carbon dioxide and it is left behind as an intermediate product. Cerium oxide nanoparticles act as an oxygen buffer, storing and releasing oxygen for the carbon atoms during the combustion process for oxidation into carbon dioxide. Cerium oxide nanoparticles possess oxygen vacancy defects (OVDs) which absorb CO molecules to form carbon dioxide or intermediate bidentate carbonate which later oxidizes into carbon dioxide [313]. Additionally, it is found that cerium oxide lowers the probability of fuel-rich zone formation through secondary atomization, which is one of the usual reasons for CO emissions [314]. Similar results were observed when cerium oxide was blended with biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel blends [315,316]. HC emissions for cerium oxide added diesel/biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel blend is lower than standard diesel, decreases with increase in engine speed and higher dosing of the ceria nanoparticle. Cerium oxide (CeO2) [+4 state] gets beneficially transformed to Cerous oxide (Ce2O3) [+3 state] via low-energy reaction during the oxidation of the hydrocarbons [317]. Catalytic role of cerium oxide nanoparticles tend to burn the air–fuel mixture earlier than usual. The dehydrogenation reaction accelerates at high temperatures since cerium ions effectively breaks the H-C bonds by lowering the activation energy, leading to decrease in HC emissions [318]. In addition, the activation energy of ceria nanoparticles prevents deposition of carbon particles and non-polar compounds on the engine cylinder walls by burning them in sustained combustion, significantly reducing HC emissions [304,317]. Similar to HC, CO emissions, Nitrous oxide emissions are found to decrease upon addition of cerium oxide to diesel and decreases further with increase in engine speed and dosing level of the nanoparticle. Despite transient higher maximum temperatures, the overall lower burning temperature of the ceria blended fuels is found to hinder NOx emissions [319]. As mentioned earlier, during the low-energy reaction stoichiometric cerium oxide from + 4 valence state is converted to cerous oxide + 3 valence state. The resultant cerous oxide interacts with NO formed by Zeldovich mechanism to release N2 again and revert to the stoichiometric cerium oxide [301]. Similar results were observed when ceria is blended with biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel, with the nanoparticle scavenging the nitric oxide radical hindering NOx formation [320,321]. Soot emissions are lower than standard diesel and decrease with higher dosing of cerium oxide nanoparticle. Cerium oxide effectively reduces the C2H4 generation- precursor of particulate matter, through secondary atomization and air–fuel mixing to prevent fuel-rich zones. The oxygen buffer ability of ceria helps oxidation of soot into carbon dioxide by acting as a smoke suppressing additive [300,322]."
14,Copper oxide,"5.3 Copper oxide The metal oxide like copper oxide can act as an anti-oxidant, stabilizer and more importantly as surfactant which offer significant reductions in emissions. This transition metal oxide’s thermal heat carrying capacity is found to play a major role in curtaining the emissions. Unlike aluminum oxide and cerium oxide nanoparticles, the quantum of work carried out in copper nanoparticles is minimal. Table 11 comprehensively summarizes the literature findings on Copper oxide usage as an additive in CI engines. BTE of copper oxide blended diesel is found to lower than standard diesel but is found to increase with higher dosing of the nanoparticle. Aluminum oxide nanoparticle of the same dosing level as copper oxide performs far better in performance front when blended with diesel [325]. Copper oxide nanoparticles are able to keep up with the diesel’s BTE at lower loads and lower engine speeds but drops down later [326]. However, the reasons for the same is not stated in the limited research work carried out. When blended with biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel, BTE is found to be lower than standard diesel but higher than the biodiesel blends. This suggests that the higher surface to volume ratio of copper nanoparticles help forming better air–fuel mixture of blends with higher viscosity and produce higher BTE, but not higher than standard diesel [327]. BTE in these blends are found to increase as the dosing of the copper oxide nanoparticles are increased. As the dosing level increases, the availability of the high active surfaces is higher and the catalytic activity is improved [328] Faster and higher heat liberation properties of the copper nanoparticles explains the above observation along with their ability to act as an oxygen buffer to support combustion process [329]. In certain blends, when copper oxide nanoparticles are highly dosed (above 50 ppm), BTE of the corresponding fuel blend is found to be higher than standard diesel [330]. On the other hand, BSFC is found to be marginally lower or almost equal to standard diesel for low dose of copper oxide blended diesel. When higher dosing is carried out (above 100 ppm), substantial decrease in the BSFC is observed [331]. The oxygen content and physical properties of the nanoparticles are suggested as the reasons [325]. When blended with biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel, copper nanoparticles are found to decrease the fuel consumption than the blend but not provide BSFC values lower than standard diesel. The biodiesel’s heating value and viscosity is found to play a major role in the overall BSFC [328]. The research community has not studied combustion characteristics for copper oxide blended with pure diesel yet. When copper nanoparticle is blended with biodiesel-diesel, in-cylinder pressure is found to be higher than diesel and it increases as the nanoparticle concentration is increased. While the cetane number and oxygen content of the biodiesel aids the combustion process, the copper nanoparticle is found to improve the ignition characteristics though increased surface are/volume and decreased ignition delay [332]. The higher calorific value of the copper oxide blended fuel aids in achieved peak pressure close to standard diesel [333]. HRR is higher for standard diesel than copper oxide blended biodiesel. However, addition of copper oxide is found to increase the HRR of the blend and increases with higher dosing of the nanoparticle. Shorter ignition delay characterized by the nanoparticle is found to improve the combustion characteristics apart from the oxygen buffer ability [328,333]. Similar to alumina and ceria nanoparticles, copper nanoparticle addition decreases the ignition delay and combustion duration by achieving better mixing and easier evaporation of air–fuel mixture. CO emissions are found to be lower than standard diesel for copper oxide blended diesel and found to decrease further with higher dosing of the nanoparticle. Copper oxide nanoparticle helps in the catalytic oxidation process to supply excess oxygen to convert intermediate carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide [326]. Similar results are observed when blended with biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel, with the copper oxide nanoparticle supporting the chemical reactivity through oxygen provision and higher surface contact areas [328]. On the other hand, HC emissions for copper oxide blended diesel is found to be lower than diesel at lower loads but is close to standard diesel at higher loads. The metal oxide nanoparticle acts as an oxygen donating catalyst to oxidize the unburnt hydrocarbon in the combustion chamber [325]. Similar results were observed when nanoparticle is blended with biodiesel/bidiesel-diesel [327-329]. Contradictory NOx emission values are obtained for copper oxide blended fuels. In some cases, the NOx emissions are found to decrease upon addition of copper oxide due to improved heat transfer in the combustion chamber by the catalyst reaction [333,334], whereas in others, nanoparticle addition is found to increase the combustion chamber temperature due to complete combustion leading to higher NOx [327,328]. In all cases, addition of nanoparticle is able to counteract the negative aspects of biodiesel such as higher viscosity and lower volatility to emit lower smoke emissions. Since NOx and smoke are tradeoff emissions, shorter ignition delay and higher surface area to volume ratio enables better air–fuel mixing, evaporation and combustion characteristics [327,334,335]"
15,Zinc oxide,"5.4 Zinc oxide Zinc oxide as a nanoparticle acts an antioxidant, with ease of manufacturing and lower price. Zinc oxide utilization in CI engines is enhanced by its anti-wear property and acts an corrosion inhibitors. Table 12 comprehensively summarizes the literature findings on Zinc oxide usage as an additive in CI engines. Similar to other metal oxides, addition of zinc oxide enhances the BTE of the diesel and increases with higher dosing of the nanoparticle due to its better combustion properties [337] However in case of addition of zinc oxide to biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel, BTE is lower than standard diesel but higher than the blend without nanoparticle. While the higher viscosity, lower calorific value and higher molecular weight negatively affect BTE of the blend, zinc oxide nanoparticle provides oxygen for combustion and helps formation of homogeneous mixture [338]. BSFC is found to be lower than standard diesel for zinc oxide blended diesel and decreases further with higher dosing of nanoparticle. Addition of zinc oxide increases the overall calorific value while reducing the ignition delay due to higher enhanced surface area to volume ratio [339]. Generally, biodiesels have higher specific fuel consumption than diesel and zinc oxide addition is found to lower BSFC considerably for the same reasons stated above and its ability to compensate for the physical properties of the fuel [340]. Limited study on the combustion characteristics is available for fuels blended with zinc oxide. In-cylinder pressure for zinc oxide blended diesel is found to be higher than standard diesel and increases with higher dosing of the nanoparticle. Zinc oxide addition advances the combustion process and reduces ignition delay, which helps achieving complete combustion [335]. As the lower calorific value of biodiesel blend lowers the in-cylinder pressure, addition of zinc oxide nanoparticle helps producing a catalytic effect during the combustion process and increase the in-cylinder pressure than the blend without nanoparticle [341]. In case of nano emulsion fuels, water content increases the ignition delay further for fuel accumulation due to higher later heat of evaporation. Similar reasons are stated for higher HRR in zinc oxide blended diesel [337] and lower HRR than standard diesel for nano blended biodiesel [342]. Zinc oxide nanoparticle in diesel acts a catalyst, with the inherent oxygen content supporting the combustion in the fuel rich zones and help the oxidation process completely. This results in lower CO emissions than standard diesel and decreases further with higher dosing of the nanoparticle [339]. Similar results are observed when zinc oxide is blended with biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel due to its ability to form stoichiometric mixture in the cylinder [343]. HC emissions are lower than standard diesel for zinc oxide blended diesel/biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel blends and decreases with higher concentration. Nanoparticle addition increases the spray length of the fuel due to its higher surface area to volume ratio and prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, improving the combustion process [339,344]. Zinc oxide addition reduces the premixed burn fraction in the combustion chamber due to its ability to decrease the ignition delay. This helps lowering the combustion temperature inside the cylinder and thus lower NOx emissions [345]. Similarly smoke emissions are lower than standard diesel for zinc oxide blended fuels, as they improve the fuel atomization, spray characteristics and quick evaporation inside the cylinder [346]."
16,Carbon nanotubes,"5.5 Carbon nanotubes Carbon nanotubes are environmentally benign additives that have recently gained interest of the researchers due to their free-metal compounds. Carbon nanotubes exhibit superior thermal and chemical properties than their counterpart metal-based nanoparticles. Addition of carbon nanotubes enhances the thermal properties of the nanofluids due to its high thermal conductivity [348] in addition to overall improvement in the cetane number and burning rate of the fuel by acting as a catalyst [310]. Tramp metal ions present in fuels which later go on form insoluble impurities are usually removed by carbon fibrils in the carbon nanotubes though sequestration [349]. Table 13 comprehensively summarizes the literature findings on Carbon nanotubes usage as an additive in CI engines. BTE for CNT blended diesel/ biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel is higher than standard diesel and increases with higher dosing of the carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes have higher reactive surface and surface area which enables it to act as a potential catalyst through higher chemical reactivity [350]. Even in cases of water-diesel emulsion fuels, addition of CNT is found to exhibit higher BTE than standard diesel. Encapsulated CNT water present in the blend absorbs the initial heat from the combustion to quickly to form water vapor since water has lower boiling point than diesel. These CNT water droplets explode by the theory of micro-explosions on the surrounding oil layers and higher surface area to volume ratio of CNT helps it to effectively mix with diesel and air [351]. BSFC is found to be lower than standard diesel for CNT blended diesel and decrease further higher dosing of the CNT. Higher evaporation of CNT due to catalytic potential is stated as one of the reasons for the above observation [352]. In addition, CNT addition reduces the ignition period inside the combustion chamber for the CNT blended fuel, thereby preventing excess fuel accumulation and burning in the premixed phase [353]. Although, CNT addition helps reduction of BSFC in biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel blends though enhanced combustion and carbon oxidation, overall BSFC values heavily depend on the viscosity and calorific value of the fuel blended [184]. In-cylinder pressure is found to be higher than standard diesel for CNT blended diesel due to improved ignition characteristics of the carbon nanotubes [354]. However, CNT addition to biodiesel/biodiesel-diesel shows gradual decrement in the in-cylinder pressure in comparison to the pure blend. This is explained by the shortened premixed combustion phase as a result of CNT addition, which does not allow larger fuel accumulation and delayed auto-ignition that happens in case of the blend without CNT [306]. HRR for fuels blended with CNT is found to be higher than standard diesel and maximum HRR is found to increase with higher dosing of carbon nanotubes. This is due to the higher thermal conductivity and surface area to volume ratio of CNT which helps achieving higher maximum HRR [184]. CO emissions are found to be lower than standard diesel for CNT blended fuel and this is attributed to the secondary atomization characteristics of the encapsulated CNT droplets. This enables uniform distribution and enhanced mixing due to the higher surface area to volume ratio [351]. HC emissions are found to be contrary in the published studies. Some studies suggest that HC emissions are found to increase upon CNT addition to the fuel as CNT act a oxygen reduction catalyst by increasing the carbon activation temperature and thus decrease HC oxidation [350,355]. In others, CNT addition decreases the HC emissions since they effectively improve the combustion characteristics through their catalytic effect [306,354,356]. NOx emissions are found to be dependent on the percentage of biodiesel in the blend and the overall balance between the biodiesel properties and CNT’s ability to lower the in-cylinder temperature. Smoke emissions are found to be lower than standard diesel for the same reasons as for CO emissions by promoting complete combustion."
17,Other nanoparticles,"5.6 Other nanoparticles Table 14 comprehensively summarizes the literature findings on nanoparticles other than the ones discussed above and their usage as an additive in CI engines. Titanium oxide is another metal based nanoparticle greatly researched for its catalytic activity during combustion and its ability to lower the oxidation temperature [199,361]. Addition of Titanium oxide greatly improves both the performance and combustion characteristics of the engine. Titanium oxide addition increases the BTE while simultaneously decreasing the specific fuel consumption. BTE increases and BSFC decreases with higher dosing of the nanoparticle to the blend fuel. It boosts the fuel oxidation and provides higher reaction surface area to boost the combustion quality [362]. The catalytic effect of the nanoparticle is also suggested to play a major role in the lower fuel consumption [363]. On the combustion front, addition of titanium oxide is found to compensate for the lower calorific value and higher viscosity, latent heat of vaporization of the biodiesel to which it is added. Titanium oxide proves larger surface area for the fuel to interact with the air inducted into the cylinder and reduces the ignition delay by enhancing the evaporation rate and combustion characteristics [364]. Higher in-cylinder pressure and HRR is observed for fuels blended with titanium oxide and increases with higher dosing of the nanoparticle. The higher thermal conductivity of the nanoparticle is also suggested to play an important role in enhancing the ignition characteristics. As stated earlier, the catalytic oxidation ability of titanium oxide comes in handy in curbing the undesired CO and HC emissions by lowering the combustion activation temperate and promote better air–fuel mixing [365]. Both CO and HC emissions are lesser than standard diesel for fuels blended with titanium oxide and decreases further with higher dosing of the nanoparticle. Also, the activation energy of titanium oxide is suggested to combust the carbon deposits on the walls of the combustion chamber thereby reducing the emissions [366]. Lower NOx emissions than standard diesel is observed for fuels blended with titanium oxide nanoparticle. The higher thermal conductivity of the nanoparticles enables it to act as a heat sink inside the combustion chamber, reducing the burning gas temperature and restraining the NOx emissions [367]. Titanium oxide lowers the carbon activation temperate and increases the turbulence inside the combustion chamber for homogeneous mixing of the air–fuel mixture [368]. The above reasons is stated for lower smoke emissions in fuels and blends upon addition of titanium oxide nanoparticle. Silver oxide is yet another metal based nanoparticle that has been utilized as an additive for biodiesel in CI engines. Like other metal based nanoparticles, silver oxide has shown remarkable nodal metal properties such as optical, thermal and high reactivity due to their larger surface area to volume ratio [369,370]. However, the reason for its utilization is not discussed in detail nor sufficient research work has been carried out yet. Similar to titanium oxide, addition of silver oxide increases BTE and decreases BSFC in the corresponding biodiesel with higher variation observed for higher dosing of the nanoparticle. Like other metal based nanoparticles their ability to act as an oxidation catalyst, increase the thermal conductivity of the fuel [371] and their inherent property of higher surface area to volume ratio [372] are the reasons stated for the above observation. Similarly, on the combustion front, silver oxide addition improves the in-cylinder pressure and HRR by enhancing the fuel atomization, reducing the ignition delay and thus accelerating the combustion process [373]. Silver oxide addition to the fuel is found to lower CO, HC, NOx and smoke emissions significantly. Addition of silver oxide promotes higher chemical reactivity due to the presence of larger reactive surfaces, while they act as an oxygen buffer improving the evaporation rate of the fuel during the premixed combustion phase [374]. Therefore, complete combustion supports the oxidization of their intermediate products. Cobalt [375-377], magnesium [378,379] and graphene [372,380] are few other nanoparticles that have been studied as prospective additives for diesel/biodiesel-diesel/ biodiesel in CI engines. The addition of nano additive material changed fuel properties like viscosity, pour point and flash point of the blended fuel. The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the fuel blended with the above nanoparticles were similar to those of the previous nanoparticles discussed."
18,Instability of nanoparticles and its effects on engine components,"5.7 Instability of nanoparticles and its effects on engine components There are few common issues during addition of nanoparticles with diesel/alcohol or biodiesel blends like creaming, flocculation, amalgamation and more importantly the phase separation etc. The affinity of nanoparticle with diesel/alcohol could play a vital role in estimating the stability of the blends [383]. Moreover, the longer operation of any diesel engine using alternative fuels in partial or complete mode could severely affected by the instability of alcohol/diesel blends. Therefore, the type of surfactant, water quantity and viscosity of blends are needed to systematically assessed in a period interval during blends preparation stage [384]. This is done with proper mechanical agitation for the suspension of particles in a liquid sample and therefore the mass transfer inside the samples can be easily promoted or achieved. It has been noted that the addition of nanoparticles might improve the miscibility of lower carbon content alcohols with diesel [385]. An instability of nanoparticle added diesel/alcohol blends are examined by standard sedimentation technique which is simple and feasible technique for investigating the settlement by applying external force. Centrifugation is a feasible technique which is commonly used by many researchers for identifying the phase separation problem through suspended particles [386]. Notably, the doping of nanoparticles with diesel/alcohol blends is highly approachable in the form of nanofluids only. All carbon nanomaterials with diesel/alcohol blends have shown remarkable improvement in stability by maintaining the immense bonding nature for one week duration [387]. Ultrasonication is an approach to dissolve the nanoparticles is a base fluid which can minimize the phase separation problem. Sodium dodecyl sulphate, Sorbitan Olieate, Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide and Oleic acid are the fewer surfactants that have been widely used for the improvement of nanoparticles dispersed diesel/higher alcohol [388]. The selection of carbon nanotubes are highly influenced by surface to volume ratio and the catalytic reactivity that can reduce the sedimentation in the blends. Furthermore, the hybridization of carbon–carbon bonds in nanoparticles would strengthen the miscibility of in water which ultimately improves the stability of the blends [389]. Eventhuogh many systematic studies have been conducted in recent times on stability aspects of suspended nanofluids in diesel/alcohol blends, the effects of nanoparticles on engine components are yet to be investigated. Few studies on engine durability for nanoparticle added blends showed no carbon deposition in engine components. However, lot more critical analysis need to be done in terms of type and exact quantity of nanoparticles and size in the diesel/alcohol blends [390]. Further studies need to be increased in material compatibility of engine components for various nanoparticle additions with diesel, biodiesel and alcohol blends. The experimental research activities can be extended on the impact of nanoparticles in tribological behaviours through lubricating oil contaminations. The development of synthetic lubricants for nanoparticles doped diesel and alcohol fuels is an another topic of research that can be widely taken by the researchers."
19,Summary and conclusions,"The present comprehensive review aims at investigating the effects of various higher alcohols and nanoparticles with diesel and biodiesel blends on CI engine characteristics. The changes in physical and chemical properties for alcohol addition with diesel and biodiesel at various concentrations have been systematically analyzed. On the other hand, the nanoparticles usage with diesel and biodiesel has also been examined. These two oxygenated additives influence in CI engine behaviours have been reviewed and the following conclusions are drawn. 1. An addition of methanol with diesel and biodiesel has shown remarkable improvement in laminar flame propagation due to inherent oxygenated nature. The strong quenching effect caused by their higher latent heat has reduces the NOx emission. 2. The application of ethanol with diesel is highly affected by cold starting capability and poor inflammability. This has become more laudable when the fraction of ethanol goes beyond 15% by volume. Furthermore, the extreme cooling effect of ethanol in the blends leads to higher HC emissions. 3. An implementation of propanol with diesel showed a mixed response in CO emission due to the combined effect of oxygen concentration and higher latent heat of vaporization. However, at higher loading condition, the propanol addition is insignificant. 4. Butanol has higher miscibility factor than other alcohols along with their higher cetane number make it as primary choice for additive formation with diesel. Due to the better hydrophobic nature of butanol, the transportation and distribution would be very easy in the existing infrastructure facility. 5. The lean outer flame zone can be a common problem in butanol-diesel blends which enhancing flame quenching problems. These problems have been more stringent during micro-explosion of butanol- diesel emulsions. 6. Pentanol added diesel has more homogeneity due to their cool-flame chemiliminesence and this has enhances the air entrainment capability and superior mixing ability. 7. The formation of aldehydes has been hindered in pentanol added diesel blends. Moreover, the thermodynamic cycle of pentanol addition is close to constant volume cycle which produces rapid combustion, higher thermal efficiency and HRR. 8. The additions of all nanoparticles have shown remarkable improvement in performance characteristics at all concentrations and this is common trend with all alcohols. Alumina nanoparticles are acting as oxygen buffer during their addition with diesel fuels. 9. Cerium oxide and Alumina nanoparticles offer higher surface/volume ratio along with better transmissibility property. This has resulted in improvement in chain reactions during combustion process. 10. Micro-explosion is a common trend in nanoparticle addition in the form of nanoemulsions. All the nanoemulsions added diesel fuels are improved the fine atomization and superior mixing capability inside the combustion chamber. 11. In recent times, Zinc oxide seems to be more effective in anti-wear and corrosion inhibition forms and thereby producing a clean and corrosion free delivery systems in CI engines. 12. The carbon nanotubes have superior heat transfer capabilities and thermal conductivity which improves the stability nature of the blend during their addition with diesel and alcohols. Therefore, from the above conclusions, it is known that the oxygenated additives are the viable option for improving the qualities of diesel engine characteristics. However, the fever works need to be undertaken in future for strengthening additives behaviour. A detailed study on design of experiments has to be carried out for the suitable selection of alcohol and nanoparticle concentrations. Fewer studies need to be conducted in micro-explosion behaviour of nanoparticles inside the combustion chamber and this may be extended with designing the piston Inorder to improve the air entrainment. Intensive research works have to be done on carbon nanoparticles and Zinc oxide especially in combustion characteristics. An extensive research activity will be taken place around the globe on the stability behaviour of various nanoparticles added diesel and biodiesel blends."
