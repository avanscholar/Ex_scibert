0,Introduction,"World demand of energy is very high relative to the supply amount from the traditional sources especially the fossil fuel (Manieniyan et al., 2009) and a real crisis may occur (Ozturk et al., 2013) due to depletion of fossil fuels and climate change (Höök and Tang, 2013). Increase in fossil fuel consumption, results in decreasing its save amount (Watany, 2015), environmental pollution (McCartney et al., 2008), global warming and causes health impacts (Zecca and Chiari, 2010). So researchers who studied the fossil fuel usages and its applications, claimed that it can be reduced by replacing it with another sustainable fuels (Bielaczyc et al., 2015) and renewable energy sources or supporting it by secondary fuels as a hybrid system; methanol (Li et al., 2015), Biodiesel/Alcohol (Niculescu et al., 2019), biodiesel of waste cooking oil (Chen et al., 2018) and mixture of hydrogen and oxygen (Karagöz et al., 2015). Hydrogen as a hybrid with fossil fuel; gasoline, diesel and LPG, had attention in research field and also commercially (BMW company) due to its combustion advantages (Ghazal, 2013; Ji and Wang, 2009). Hydrogen has limited applications due to its explosion nature causing a disaster. HHO gas is a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases with atomic ratio 2:1 produced from water electrolysis process. HHO gas used in the past years as a hybrid with internal combustion engine fuels instead of hydrogen because it is more safe to use in addition to its good combustion properties also it is easy to be created onboard. Oxy-hydrogen, hydroxyl, H2/O2, Rhodes gas and Browns gas, all these are alternative names for HHO gas. HHO gas can be obtained from dry cell and wet cell through electrolysis process (Shah et al., 2018). Wet cell designed as plates submerged in water, while in dry cell the water runs through the plate. Wet cells have higher gas production but they require more current nevertheless dry cells are more adapted to operate with moving engines since the electrolyte volume content is smaller and sealed (Egan et al., 2013). Electric power (amperage and voltage), metal plates (charged terminals and neutrals); number, area and material, electrolyte type and percentage; these are the main components of HHO generator that are responsible for the electrochemical ionization reactions and splitting the bonds in H2O molecule to form HHO gas (Salem, 2008; Mamilla et al., 2018). All researchers in the field of hybrid vehicle engines with HHO gas claimed that lower fuel consumption and higher engine performance (Pawar et al., 2017) can be achieved. Also lower gas emission (Mahendran et al., 2018) than individual gasoline (Vino et al., 2012; Abhilash et al., 2015) or diesel engines (Ragupathy, 2017) at engine constant speed (Shashikant et al., 2015), HHO gas different flow rates (Sakhrieh et al., 2017), different compression ratios (Chauhan et al., 2016), different hydrogen volume fractions (Wang et al., 2012) and four stroke SI and CI engines (Govind et al., 2015). Wang et al. (2011) improved the performance of gasoline engine by hydrogen-oxygen mixture addition. They compared the addition of hydrogen and hydroxygen with three volume fractions (0, 2% and 4%) with excess air ratio variation on the engine performance and engine emission at 1400 rpm and a MAP of 61.5kpa under lean conditions. After adoption of ECU, the blending of hydroxygen with gasoline engine increases the percentage of the thermal efficiency, the brake mean effective pressure and NOx emission than the conventional engine and hybrid gasoline with hydrogen engine at lean conditions and decreases CO emission as well. EL-Kassaby et al. (2016) designed, optimized and fabricated HHO dry cell. They studied the effect of variation of the catalyst type and its quantity. They used two catalyst materials, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. They produced 18 l/h of HHO gas from their designed generator. The engine performance enhanced after HHO gas addition with fuel such that 10% increase in thermal efficiency and 34%, 18%, 14% 15% reduction in fuel consumption, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides respectively. Krishna (2018) investigated the performance and emission of four stroke spark ignition single cylinder engine with HHO gas at low engine speeds from 700 to 1500 rpm. Specific fuel consumption and total fuel consumption of the engine are decreased from 5% to 12% with addition of HHO gas. Brake thermal efficiency increased by 5–10%. Carbon monoxide decreased by 20% and NOx decreased by 62%. Rajasekaran et al. (2015) investigated single cylinder engine fueled by gasoline engine and liquefied petroleum gas. This investigation was extended to introduce HHO gas to these engines. In both experiments the incorporation of HHO gas results in decrease in fuel consumption and emissions. Experimental results show introducing HHO to gasoline and LPG engines results in decrease in fuel consumption by 9.6% and 15.7%, CO concentration reduction by 27.5% and 52.1%. Sunil et al. (2014) studied a single cylinder air cooled 100CC spark ignition petrol engine conducted by HHO gas. They observed smooth and stable operation of the engine with HHO gas and a reduction in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons percentage. Musmar and Al-Rousan (2011) studied the gasoline engine emissions with effect of HHO gas. The tested engine was Honda G200 (197CC) and the measurements recorded at different speeds. Gasoline engine hybrid with HHO gas resulted in increase of engine efficiency, reduction of NO and NOx about 50%, reduction of CO concentration about 20% and fuel consumption reduction between 20% and 30%. Al-Rousan (2010) studied the same engine with two different sizes of HHO generators (B and C types). He defined the cell size as a ratio of cell surface area and piston area with optimum ratio 20:1, and the needed water volume is 1.5 times the engine capacity. CI engines integrated with HHO gas was studied by (Yilmaz et al., 2010); their results recorded an increase in torque by 19.1%, a reduction in CO and Hydrocarbons (HC) emissions percentage by 13.5% and 5% respectively and a reduction in specific fuel consumption by 14%. Karagöz (2018) studied the diesel engine response when different levels of hydrogen are used [0%, 40% and 75%]. The tested diesel engine was single cylinder with volume 1163CC and compression ratio 14.7 at 1300 rpm engine speed and full load. Increasing hydrogen percentage results in improvement of break thermal efficiency by 1.26% and 2.1%. The percentage of decrease carbon monoxide was 25%, 60% and hydrocarbons were 30%, 60% by using hydrogen as a secondary fuel, also unusual decrease up to 70.7% of smoke emission was obtained at 75% hydrogen concentration. Ozcanli et al. (2017) studied the effect of H2 and HHO on the performance and emissions of biodiesel/diesel engine (Castor oil methyl ester (CME)-diesel blends). In this study naturally aspirated, four cylinder diesel engine with a volume of 3.6 l is used and the fuel pump plunger pin was re-set and diesel fuel injection has been decreased. In terms of exhaust gas emissions, H2+CME20 provided better results than HHO + CME20. Engine performance outputs of HHO + CME20 fuel was better than H2+CME20 fuel. Uludamar et al. (2017) evaluated the vibration of HHO gas generator which is installed in the diesel engine fueled with different diesel–biodiesel blends. They investigated the effect of HHO gas on the performance of engine vibration with a Mitsubishi Canter 4D34-2A diesel engine. HHO gas introduced to the test engine with 2, 4 and 6 l/min flow rates when the engine was fueled with sunflower, canola, and corn biodiesels. The vibration data was recorded between 1200 and 2400 rpm engine speeds. Upward-downward movement of engine's pistons affected the vibration. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was conducted in order to predict the effect of fuel properties and HHO amount on engine vibration level. Sürer and Arat (2017) investigated the usage of hydrogen as a fuel on aviation. The aerospace and aviation sectors have been the earlier to recognize the importance of using hydrogen fuel. They touched upon the hydrogen usage strategies in aviation as a fuel. In the future, there will be a shortage in the amount of fresh water used for drinking especially with increasing the world population. Fresh water can be effectively obtained by solar desalination (Qiblawey and Banat, 2008). Solar desalination systems had several classifications; one of the simplest techniques is solar still desalination as direct and indirect systems (Kabeel and El-Agouz, 2011; Kaushal, 2010). Solar still had several modifications to increase its productivity but there were several main conditions affected the amount of distilled water yield and the system efficiency (Muftah et al., 2014). Some operational conditions had a direct impact on the thermal desalination systems of sea water and brackish water (Kabeel et al., 2019); solar radiation intensity, temperature of the ambient, wind conditions, glass cover angle and thickness, still insulation (Yeo et al., 2017), still water depth, free surface area (Tiwari, A. K., and Tiwari, G. N., 2006), inlet water temperature and the difference in temperature between the water and the glass cover (Sampathkumar and Senthilkumar, 2012; Winston et al., 2018). In this study, a novel water desalination technique is applied using HHO gas burning in a conventional solar still which results in a promising fresh water quantity. HHO gas has several power generation applications due to its energy and combustion advantages beside its low influence of environmental pollution. HHO gas can be used in industrial and domestic applications such as; heating (Tabazaha et al., 2014), household cooking (Martis, 2018; Wolk, 1999), cutting (Tušek and Šraj, 2007; Borse et al., 2017) and welding (Dobraš et al., 2013; Kesarwani et al., 2017) which called sometimes water powered gas welding (Tejaswini et al., 2016). After these reviews, this work aims to shed the light on HHO gas through the design and fabrication of different models of HHO gas dry generator to prepare a data bank for every HHO application. Also, enabling sustainable, efficient, affordable and robust use of HHO gas generator for different applications such as vehicle petrol engines, cooking, welding and cutting. Its effect on the emission gases as a cleaner production way have been studied. In previous works, a single type of vehicle engines was studied but in this study, the application of HHO gas on two different vehicle engines (carburetor and ECU) are studied and compared to prove that this gas can work with different engines. In addition to a novel application of HHO gas in water desalination has been also studied as a new technique. This study serves mostly the work in developing countries especially the remote areas."
1,Experimental setup and procedures,
2,HHO gas characteristics,"2.1 HHO gas characteristics HHO gas has the nature of implosion due to its atomic structure, when a pure gas burned consequently the vacuum is immediately formed causing this implosion. Flame temperature of HHO gas varied according to the receipting materials. Open air gas flame temperature about 135 °C, applying the gas flame to the aluminum and brick causes temperature to reach up to 702 °C and 1704 °C respectively. HHO gas flame is awfully directed and the molecular structure of some materials can be changed by HHO gas influence. Auto-ignition of HHO gas occurs at about 570 °C at STP. The theoretical energy level of HHO gas has about 60,000 Btu/lb. HHO gas is odorless, colorless and lighter than air; it does not need oxygen for burning meanwhile the gas internally contains the oxygen. Due to the wide range of flammability and high burning velocity (1000 times of petrol vapor) the HHO gas permits the use of lean air-fuel mixture with acceptable emissions and combustion efficiency. It has abnormal adsorption to gases, liquids and solids, making it to be used as an additive to other fuel to improve the environmental quality (George, 2000)."
3,General design and constructional parameters of HHO generator,"2.2 General design and constructional parameters of HHO generator Generally, HHO dry generator is composed of metal plates, stainless steel is preferred due to its good electrical, thermal and physical properties, specifically stainless steel 316L is used in this study, with certain numbers and dimensions determined according to the design and the application. Stainless steel is anti-corrosive metal with melting point 1375–1400 °C. The plates are connected to the electric DC power source such that, for one stack generator, one plate has positive charge (anode), one plate has negative charge (cathode) and the remainders are neutral. Numbers of neutral plates is determined according to the design in order to divide the source voltage equally between cells with reasonable value. Every two successive plates form a closed compartment with the aid of rubber gasket. The rubber gaskets ensure a good sealing of any plate to touch the neighbor plate and guarantee the water and gas existence inside the generator. Rubber has thickness tolerance under pressure with final thickness 3 mm which is reasonable to satisfy a convenient current resistance and suitable space permitting the HHO gas to escape freely in the required direction. The plates have lower small holes for equalizing the water level in the cells and to permit the electrons to flow under voltage drop with small friction and heat generated. Also there are upper large holes permitting the gas to vent, these hole in uppermost to increase the surface area of contact with water and to speed up the gas out. If the plate design has a rectangular shape then the smaller edge length is oriented to be the path of HHO gas. Generator has accessories: two acrylic end cover plates with thickness 12 mm one of them has inlet water hole and the other has outlet gas hole, bolts, washers, nuts, fittings, bubbler, connectors, non-return valve, hoses and tank. The tank ensures continuous feeding of electrolyte to the generator that guarantee cooling of the generator. A bubbler is a container partially filled with water and HHO gas is fed through its bottom, and obligatory rises through the water before continuing its passage. The bubbler is important to avoid backfires from reaching the electrolyzer and is required for drying and purification of HHO gas from water vapor before reaching to the power applications (http://labellasautorepair.com). Non-return valve between the electrolyzer and bubbler is a safety essential in the backfire case."
4,Operational parameters of HHO generator,"2.3 Operational parameters of HHO generator According to the required amount of HHO gas and available electric power source the number of cells and stacks are determined; also the effective area of the plates is calculated. The number of cells and the electrolyte concentration has direct effect on cell voltage. The voltage of each cell can be calculated as the source voltage divided by the number of cells. According to Boyce approximated 2–3V value for each cell make the generator working conditions are appropriated without heating (http://labellasautorepair.com). The gap between plates and the operation cell temperature must be taken into consideration when cell amperage was evaluated. Pure water in default has a high resistance to current flow so this resistance must be decrease by adding certain amount of electrolytes. The concentration of the electrolyte in water highly affect on the cell amperage determination. During the operation, if the electrolyte concentration slight increases due to heat generation consequently the current increases in response. The quantity of HHO gas depends on the water efficiency to pass the current and the amount of current succeeded to travel through the plate surface area. Faraday highlighted, each square inch of plate surface area can support 0.54 amps of current. Faraday's first law to calculate the theoretical maximum production of HHO gas (http://labellasautorepair.com); (1) V = RITt zFP where: V is volume of gas (l), R is ideal gas constant = 0.0820,577 l atm/(mol.K), I is current (A), T is temperature (K), t is time (s), F is Faraday's constant = 96,485 Coulombs/mol, P is ambient pressure (atm) and z is number of excess electrons (2 for H2, 4 for O2)."
5,Experimental work on HHO generators,"2.4 Experimental work on HHO generators The design of HHO generators varies according to the application, required energy, and available electrical power. Every design has limited operational conditions and performance according to the efficiency of the electrolysis process. Number of plates, plates metal, plates dimensions, type of electrolyte and its concentration and distance between plates; all these design parameters professionally affects the efficiency, durability and the productivity of HHO gas generators. The operational parameters, pressure, temperature, amperage and voltage, must be taken into consideration. Before installation of the generator in any application its performance must be investigated individually. In this study, different generators are designed, fabricated and tested; 5, 7, 9 plates single stack generators, 13 plates two stacks (2 negative and 1 positive plates) generator and 19 plates 3 stacks (2 negative and 2 positives plates) also 7 plates single stack generator was tested with different electrolyte concentrations (sodium hydroxide, NaOH), as shown in Fig. 1 . All these models were fabricated generally without targeted application but to investigate the behavior of HHO generators and to evaluate their performance to obtain the finger print of any generator and prepare a data bank for every HHO application. In each case the amount of HHO gas, amperage and temperature were measured. Experimental measurements required; voltmeter, K-type thermocouple, clamp meter, graduated cylinder, bottle and stopwatch. The amount of produced HHO gas is measured manually using the volume of water displaced from the inverted graduated cylinder and stopwatch. The plates are fabricated from stainless steel 316L with dimension 140 × 100 × 1 mm. According to the design and available power, the number of active plates, neutral plates, and number of stacks are determined. The thickness of the used rubber gasket is 4 mm between each two mean plates and between the extreme plates and the acrylic cover. This thickness with tightening the cell by nails and nuts was decreased to 3 mm 12V battery was used as a power source. According to Bob Boyce 2–3V average for each cell is a good electrical pressure value for durable working conditions. Experimental test of 7 plates (6 cells) generator with different electrolyte molarity is performed firstly to choose the most suitable electrolyte concentration of the remaining experiments. From the experimental results electrolyte molarity 0.125 shows good efficiency so it is applied to all generators. The average working time of each experiment is approximately 1 h. The experimental results are shown in Table 1 . The experimental set-up and showed results turn out the reader for actually figuring out the pros and cons of the adopted systems. From the experimental measurements shown in Table 1, at fixed cell voltage and plate area, the amperage is controlled by Sodium Hydroxide (electrolyte) concentration. It can be observed, a directly proportion relationship between the electrolyte temperature and the cell amperage, which is considered generator obstacle. The increased current through the cell causes the generator become hotter which is a closed loop results in bad efficiency (Streblau et al., 2014). The electrolyte heating causes the increase of the electrolyte concentration with time as the amount of NaOH is constant while the amount of the water reduces due to evaporation. This problem can be solved by reducing the concentration of NaOH in water at starting such that after certain working time the electrolyte temperature reached its maximum value and the designed current is reached too. This solution is simple but the amount of HHO gas at starting is very low till reached the required operating conditions, also the determined electrolyte concentration is evaluated by trials. Table 1 shows, from point of view of gas productivity to used power ratio, 13 plates two stacks with 0.125 electrolyte molarity had been preferred. The generator with 5 plates has abnormal behavior due to the cell voltage has 3V which is very large value compared to the standard cell voltage that results in high temperature and amperage. The ambient temperature is considered a main factor in determining the resistance of the water so it was measured in all tests. The plate area must be optimized such that the grater area means the grater produced gas due to the enlargement in the probabilities of bubbles escaping from the plates but the greater current is required that causing high power requirement and heating the electrolyte. It is suggested that the face area of the plates between 2 and 4 in2 per ampere of current (http://labellasautorepair.com). The electrolyte heating has a bad effect as it drives a water vapor mixes with the gas and is fed to the engine, diluting gas concentration and lowering the waited power from the hybrid engine with HHO gas. In the electrolysis process the liquid water transforms to HHO gaseous state through a phenomenon neither evaporation nor separation and with less energy."
6,HHO gas generator corrosion,"2.5 HHO gas generator corrosion Distilled water has high current flow resistance, so if it used alone as a working fluid in the electrolysis process no gas will be produced. However, catalyst materials (electrolytes) must be added to the distilled water to increase its conductivity. The additive catalyst materials must be carefully chosen to avoid any undesirable effects. Salts, as one of the proposed additive to water, enhance the electrolysis rate but results in corrosion and chlorine gas. The corrosion is clearly shown if a tap water was used instead of distilled one, and its effect is tremendous if the materials of generator plates can be corroded or with low grade. Fig. 2 shows the cell corrosion after working 28 h under potential voltage 110V (to accelerate the corrosion effect), tap water with salt as a catalyst and low grade stainless steel plates. Many substances can be used as a catalyst of the water in the electrolysis process but large numbers of them have disagreeable influences. Sodium hydroxide, NaOH or lye, and potassium hydroxide, KOH, are the best additives choices as catalysts. The percentage of the catalyst is a main factor in evaluating the cell current. There is a boundary to this concentration percentage, the gas production increases with catalyst concentration until the limit 28% (weight). Subsequently any increase in the concentration produces a reduction in gas production. Every time of experimental preparations, start with water, add the catalyst slowly, stirring and let the mixture to cool between the additions (Streblau et al., 2014)."
7,Experimental work on hybrid internal combustion engines using HHO gas,"2.6 Experimental work on hybrid internal combustion engines using HHO gas The unconventional added fuel for the traditional internal combustion engines fuels speaks to lessening fuel utilization and toxin outflows emission created by these engines. This part of study aims to boost engines performance and to scale back fuel consumption by combination the traditional gasoline engines with HHO gas at the engine intake. This application of HHO gas is considered one of the most important applications. The experiments are performed on two vehicle engines; Dayune 150CC and Mitsubishi Lancer 1.3 GL, the engines detailed specifications are shown in Table 2 . In order to show the effect of HHO gas, the performance of engines with and without HHO generators are evaluated and compared under constant load conditions with engines speed variation from 1100 rpm to 2500 rpm for 150CC and from 1250 rpm to 2500 rpm for 1300CC. Bob Boyce prescribed the optimum amount of oxy-hydrogen varied between 0.25 and 0.5 L per minute for each 1000CC of engine (http://labellasautorepair.com). So, the tested engines capacity required 0.0375–0.075 l/min and 0.325–0.65 l/min of HHO gas for 150CC and 1300CC gasoline engines respectively. From investigations and several trials, Bob Boyce prescription of the optimum amount of oxy-hydrogen required for each engine is valid for large engines volume and not applicable to small engines. So, the required generators are 9 plates (140*100*1 mm) one stack for 150CC and 13 plates two stacks each stack 7 cells for 1300CC (140*100*1 mm). After the generators have been installed with engines, the average cell efficiency was recorded at different engine speed and electrolyte concentrations. The cell efficiency depends on the cell productivity of HHO gas ( m HHO ) with certain calorific value (LHVHHO is 121,000 kJ/kg) as cell output energy and the time of induced electrical power as cell input energy (EL-Kassaby et al., 2016). Fig. 3 shows the effect of 1300CC tested engine speed (1500 and 2000 rpm) and catalyst concentration (5, 10 and 20 g/L) variations on average cell efficiency. Catalyst concentration 5 g/L (0.125 molarity) of NaOH gives higher efficiency at different engine speeds. (2) HHO generator efficiency = m HHO *LHV HHO Volt* Ampere* Time The installation of the generators with engines have certain precautions such as, choosing the place that exposed to air cooling and away from heat engine and rotating parts as shown in Fig. 4 . HHO gas directed to engine through pipe fixed at the air intake manifold. Safety precaution requires connection of flash back arrestor in the way of HHO gas from the generator to the air manifold of engine to separate the engine and generator in case of flash back. The two engines are controlled by 12V battery and according to the voltage distribution principle each compartment of 150CC and 1300CC HHO generators has 1.5V and 1.71V respectively. According to Bob Boyce the average voltage of any compartment must be around 2V for optimum and durable operation. During the engines operation the battery alternator changes the voltage by range from 12.5 to 14.5V. By this way, the compartment voltage becomes 1.71V and 1.96V respectively which are reasonable. HHO gas generator can work with old vehicle engines operated by carburetor and with modern vehicle engines operated with computer (ECU). The performance of old vehicle engine enhanced immediately with HHO gas incorporation with simple modification which is the changing of the jet to a smaller diameter. Whenever, in modern vehicles the system needs a lot of modifications to reasonably work with HHO gas. Due to the combustion advantages of HHO gas, it causes the improvement of gasoline burning in the engine cylinder results in increase in engine performance. The vehicle computer is guessing the same amount of oxygen in the exhaust gases and increases the fuel rate to reach its normal stabilized operation conditions. By this way HHO gas has no improvement to the engine performance waiting the adjustment of the vehicle computer. So, vehicle ECU is connected to oxygen sensors to control the fuel consumption. The range of the oxygen sensor 0.2–1V (low value means the mixture is too lean) depending on the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gases which is transmitted to ECU to adapt the fuel rate. So, after HHO installation, the voltage output from the oxygen sensor must be changed. There are some additional accessories must be incorporated with ECU and oxygen sensors to ensure the effect operation of HHO gas as shown in Fig. 5 . Mass air flow sensor (measure the amount of air in the intake and send the signal to ECU to introduce fuel according to the corresponding air to fuel mixture ratio), manifold absolute pressure sensor (measure the vacuum pressure in the intake and send the signal instantaneously to ECU according to this value), these sensors help the engine to operate properly and must be adapted in case of HHO gas to reduce the fuel consumption, influence ignition timing and increase the engine performance. Pulse width modulator (reduce the average power delivered by an electrical signal to any device by controlling the average value of the current fed to the load to be nearly constant which results in the production rate of HHO gas is nearly constant). In some cases, researchers preferred using Electronic Fuel Injection Enhancer (EFIE) to emphasize the engine modifications and to ensure the reduction of fuel consumption with HHO gas but it increases the system complications. As shown in Fig. 5, ECU has a great control function to save the consumed fuel and to increase the mileage with HHO gas. The data of these sensors are recorded during the experiments to show the state of fuel consumption and the effect of HHO gas. In all tests, the engine performance was recorded with and without HHO gas. Code reader diagnostic scanner tool, tachometer (for engine speed measurement), K-type thermocouple (for exhaust gas temperature measurement), voltmeter, clamp meter and flow meter are equipment used in experimental work. In all experimental tests, for both engine cases, the ambient and engine temperatures are normal, the engines were at idle states and the code reader diagnostic scanner tool reading had no problem code."
8,Results and discussions of engines performance with HHO gas,
9,Engine performance,"3.1 Engine performance Fig. 6 shows the motor brake power efficiency at constant load and different engine speeds. Since HHO gas has calorific value higher than gasoline, the measurements recorded a growth of the engine brake efficiency with HHO gas generator 17.9% for 150CC and 22.4% for 1300CC. This enhancement resulting from the heat energy liberated from HHO burning, simplified the break of bonds of gasoline molecules, resulted in high combustion efficiency. This complete, efficient and smooth combustion in addition to the piston can safely complete its stroke closer to top dead center (TDC) were the main reasons for this engine break efficiency development with HHO gas. The resulted high power from complete combustion turned into obvious mechanical torque. At high engine speeds, for two engine cases, there are small differences of brake efficiency due to the saturation state of HHO generators has been reached, threshold gas productivity, as the amperage increased the HHO gas productivity amount still constant. Since thermal efficiency depends on the brake efficiency and the heat input also it's an indication of combustion efficiency. Fig. 7 shows the enhancement of thermal efficiency was clear for engines with HHO gas. The recorded enhancements in thermal efficiencies were 15.7% for 150CC and 19.1% for 1300CC. This development indicates complete combustion and reduction of heat input due to the great energy content of the HHO/air/fuel mixture. Also, shorter combustion time and high flame speed results from HHO gas addition to the gasoline engines results in high thermal efficiency and a reasonable amount of combustion energy was transferred to useful power. One of the supreme advantages of HHO gas, it increases the octane rating of any fuel added with it and so enhances the characteristics of the low grade fuel and delays its ignition to approach TDC in safe similar to the high octane fuel. Fig. 8 shows the fuel consumption at different engine speeds with a reduction in the consumed fuel amount with addition of HHO gas to the engines. HHO gas helps the engine to reach the required power and mileage with smaller fuel amount. The reduction in fuel is approximately 14.8% for 150CC and 16.3% for 1300CC. Fig. 9 shows, as the engine speed increases the specific fuel consumption decreases while for engines with HHO gas this decrease is obvious. The values of specific fuel consumption for engines with HHO gas are lower than for the same engine without HHO gas at the same engine speed. In all tests, the temperature of the engines exhaust gases increases as the engines speeds increase nevertheless for engines with HHO gas the temperature is lower than the conventional engine. Fig. 10 records the exhaust gas temperature and explains the reduction in case of engines with HHO gas. In each cases, as the engine speed increases the exhaust gas temperature increases but with lesser amounts in case of HHO gas utilization due to the enhancement in the combustion with the formation of small amount of H2O as a combustion result that helps in decreasing the exhaust gas temperature. Also the presence of HHO reduces the consumption amount of the fuel, lean mixture phenomenon, causing a drop in the temperature. With the same previous steps, many real tests and trials with different HHO generators, measurements and different engines performance evaluation are performed experimentally on different internal combustion engines. All experimental results are recorded and adapted to increase the engines performance. The results were promising and depend on the engine year model and driver behavior as shown in Table 3 ."
10,Engine gas emissions,"3.2 Engine gas emissions The exhaust gases are analyzed using gas analyzer for engines without and with HHO gas. The results indicate a reduction in gas emissions for engines with HHO gas. HORIBA automotive emission analyzer MX-002 (MEXA-324 J) is an emission gas analyzer device used to measure the concentrations of CO and HC in the engine exhaust gases. The gas analyzer readings are shown in Table 4 . That records CO and HC readings for 150CC and 1300CC engines with and without HHO gas. As carbon monoxide emission was affected by the engine combustion efficiency and the Air/fuel ratio. So, the utilization of HHO gas with interior oxygen content enriches the engine combustion process and decreases the percentage of CO in the exhaust gases as shown in Fig. 11 . The reduction in CO percentage for 150CC and 1300CC using HHO gas with engines are 33% and 24.5% respectively. The diatomic and magnecular bonds in HHO gas atomic structure with high start response without propagation delay of ignition owing to reaction surface travel time ensures complete and efficient fuel burning and results in the reduction of emission percentages. The unburned fuel which means hydrocarbons (HC), emitted with emission gases due to the incomplete burning. Fig. 12 shows HC is decreased as the engine speed is increased. HC percentage for engines blending HHO gas with air and fuel mixture was lower than the conventional engines. HC is decreased due to the increase of the fuel oxidation; as oxygen is already exist with sensible percentage in HHO gas, which results in fewer quenching distance, wide-ranging flammability and high combustion efficiency. The reduction in HC percentage for 150CC and 1300CC with using HHO gas are 27.4% and 21% respectively. By comparison with earlier works (EL-Kassaby et al., 2016; Krishna, 2018) have the same engine volume but different models and machines, and approximately at the same test conditions, the present work for 150CC shows greater reduction in fuel consumption and gas emissions but for 1300CC lower reduction in fuel consumption and higher reduction in gas emission. The results of this study were compared with the previous research results. Using HHO gas in the studied vehicle engines results in, the obtained percentage of reducing the fuel consumption and the percentage of exhaust gases reduction is not the highest or the lowest percentages, but the design parameters were changed several times and optimized (Govind et al., 2015) according to the used vehicle engine, type of generator (dry or wet, Rajasekaran et al., 2015), available size (Krishna, 2018), area of the plates (EL-Kassaby et al., 2016), quantity of catalyst (Yilmaz et al., 2010) and available electric power (Shashikant et al., 2015) to give a reasonable decrease in fuel consumption and exhaust gases."
11,Experimental error and uncertainty analysis,"3.3 Experimental error and uncertainty analysis The accuracy of the measured data must be analyzed to validate the results. After devices calibration, the measured errors decrease to small values and acceptable range. The uncertainty analysis can be calculated and depends on the error of direct measured data (EL-Kassaby et al., 2016; Barford, 1985). Engine power uncertainty (UEP) depends on engine speed and engine load errors (UES and UEL) however HHO cell power uncertainty (UCP) depends on voltage and amperage errors (UV and UI) at maximum and minimum operating conditions as shown in Table 5 . (3) U P = ( ∂ P ∂ x × U x ) 2 + ( ∂ P ∂ y × U y ) 2"
12,Experimental work on hybrid solar still and HHO gas,"Utilization of HHO gas in water desalination is considered a new application. As shown in Figs. 13 and 14 , a conventional solar still can be integrated with photovoltaic panels (4 modules) and oxy-hydrogen generator to increase its performance and productivity of distillate water. The DC volt output is stored in two lead–acid (12 V, 65 AH/20HR) batteries that are connected in parallel arrangement. The hybrid system was experimented at the roof of faculty of engineering, Ismailia (latitude 30° N, longitude 32° E). Solar still fabricated from 2 mm stainless steel thickness, the sides are painted with black color to increase the solar absorption, 5 mm thickness transparent glass cover is placed at Ismailia latitude angle with the horizontal, 4 cm layer of wood and foam layer are used for insulation and the fresh water condensed on the glass is collected by sloped half plastic channel in graduated flask. The results were recorded hourly for 3 days in September. The following parameters were recorded continuously during the operating time, ambient temperature, wind velocity (by vane anemometer), solar radiation (by TM-207), basin water temperature, inner glass temperature, outer glass temperature and freshwater output. The water basin temperature was measured with two k-type thermocouples at different depths. HHO gas was generated from two generators each one had 78 stainless steel 316L plates single stack, 100 × 80 × 1 mm is area of each plate and NaOH is used as a catalyst with concentration 5 g/l. Four solar panels with battery are used as a power supply to HHO generators, each panel 50 W. The production of the generator was 11 L HHO gas every minute which is directly burned in the still basin. The amount of liberated heat from generated HHO gas increased the water temperature in the solar still more than 85 °C when burned. A control circuit was integrated with system to save some power and control the operation of the HHO generator when required to sustain the high temperature of the saline water in the solar still at a necessary value. The experimental results are recorded at different two depths of saline water in basin (10 mm and 20 mm). The experimental results were recorded, average ambient temperature 30 °C, average wind speed 3 m/s and average solar radiation 800 W/m2. The productivity of the distilled water from conventional solar still was recorded and it can be increased by incorporating HHO generator powered by the photovoltaic. The combustion of the generated HHO gas under the still base area, 1 m2 (1 m × 1 m), increased the temperature and the evaporation of the saline water in the still. Also, the basin had a layer of sand material with thickness 2 mm to distribute the heat equally under the water surface area and store energy for a certain time. This hybrid system guarantees the water desalination along the whole day (24 h), with no solar irradiance. The required power for HHO generator was taken from PV batteries. This system is considered as a renewable energy, solar and oxy-hydrogen, that can be applied in remote areas. From experimental records the hybrid desalination system yields greater hourly and daily productivity of fresh water. As shown in Fig. 15 , the obtained distilled water from the hybrid system at 10 mm water depth was 19.1 l/m2/day, which is considered a high daily amount of fresh water compared to the conventional system (3.9 l/m2/day) (Kabeel et al., 2019). The efficiency of the integrated desalination system was 25% which is lower than the conventional still alone 29% (Kabeel and El-Agouz, 2011) because it consumed higher energy along the working time. The cost of 1 L of distilled water from the new system is higher than the conventional 1-L price. (4) η d = ∑ m p × h fg A × I ( t ) + electric power where, ηd is the daily efficiency of the studied solar desalination system with HHO gas, distillate water productivity Σ m, latent heat hfg at average water basin temperature Tw, average solar intensity I(t) over the whole area of absorber surface (A) and the electric power (current × volt)."
13,Hybrid LPG home cooking fuel with HHO gas,"LPG can be used as a cooking fuel but it has several disadvantages such as; emits greenhouse gas emissions, finite resource, dangerous to handle (in case of worn out equipment or incorrect use, LPG bears the risk of explosion), difficult to store, a safety hazard (you require very sturdy tanks and cylinders), has to be kept pressurized (if incorrectly handled can lead to explosions), more expensive (households need to be able to pay the fuel price) and highly flammable. It is potentially very hazardous and inaccessible in rural areas due to unreliable or missing distribution network. In this application HHO gas can serve alone as a cooking fuel or it can be mixed with LPG to overcome or decrease all these disadvantages. Mixing HHO gas with LPG as a cooking fuel mixture reduces LPG consumption rate, the bad gas emission and cost. This mixing process permits the prolongation time period of LPG cylinders and also can be used in remote areas. LPG alone as a cooking fuel is composed of 40% propane and 60% butane with calorific values 13.62 Kwh/kg and 13.83 Kwh/kg respectively (Wolk, 1999). The amount of energy supplied from 1 kg of LPG is 13.07 kWh. LPG amount is in reduction especially with high population and produces bad emissions when burned like carbon monoxide. As shown in Fig. 16 , The HHO generator used in this application is composed of 25 plates of stainless steel 316L, 4 stacks with 140*100*1 mm plate dimension and 10 g/l NaOH as a catalyst concentration. Bubbler, flow control valve, flashes back arrestor for safety and connections and fittings between LPG line and HHO line; all these components are used in the experimental work. In this experiment battery 12V is used as a power source. The amount of produced HHO gas was recorded 2.3 l/min, this amount reduces the consumption of LPG and produces small emission to the environment. The person needs 978 MJ per day of energy for cooking (De et al., 2014). According to the available energy from LPG and HHO gas mixture and the required energy for cooking, the average reduction in LPG consumption is 40%. From the experimental tests; mixing LPG with HHO gas can be used as a home cooking gas without need to a new burner. Traditional LPG stoves can be adapted to burn HHO gas alone by using new burners with smaller ports to decrease the releasing rate of gas (0.5–0.7 mm)."
14,HHO gas used in welding and cutting application,"Gas cutting (oxy-fuel cutting) has several disadvantages such as; limited to mild and low alloy steels, carbon steel and cast iron, less suitable for stainless steels and aluminum, Wide Heat Affected Zone (HAZ; this can cause the metal in the Heat Affected Zone to become hard and brittle which can lead to cracking) (Tušek and Šraj, 2007) and metal edges being cut can often form a thin and brittle layer (Borse et al., 2017). Using oxy-hydrogen in cutting able to cut the face straighter and smoother, HAZ is very narrow and less affected, hardness at the cut face is approximately the same, cutting speed is higher, cut thicker materials, easy slag removal, low running cost and environment friendly. Gas welding has several disadvantages such as; not suitable for heavy sections, less working temperature of gas flame, slow rate of heating, not suitable for high carbon steel welding, larger heat affected area, problem in storage and handling of gases and thickness falling productivity (thickness greater than 5 mm is disadvantageous). When connecting overlapping metal thickness greater than 3 mm gas welding are not recommended because there is tension in the metal, which can lead to deformation (Dobraš et al., 2013). The combustion advantages of HHO gas let it to use in metal cutting and welding applications. HHO gas temperature about 2800 °C, the flame is straight, high speed and concentrated with low heat losses (Kesarwani et al., 2017). These effects of fast heating results in less deflection of metal, the color didn't change and the cutting and welding sector is spotless and smooth with high precision. The flame temperature of HHO gas depends on the receiving materials (Tejaswini et al., 2016). Fig. 17 shows the cutting torch is different of welding torch. The HHO gas generator used in both cutting and welding applications composed of 110 plates of stainless steel 316L, one stack. The plate dimension is 100*80*1 mm and the catalyst NaOH is used with concentration 10 g/L. The measured amperage to HHO generator is 6.6A from 220V power source used to produce 8.3 l/min of HHO gas required for cutting and welding processes."
15,Conclusion,"Oxy-hydrogen gas can be generated from dry cell by electrolysis process of water with NaOH as a catalyst. Decreasing the fuel consumption and the environmental pollution are considered the main factors of using HHO gas. Many types of HHO dry generators were designed, fabricated, and tested. HHO gas has different applications in transportation, desalination, cooking, welding and cutting. (1) Vehicles were considered a promising application of HHO gas, so two engines are tested 150CC and 1300CC. Results showed reduction 14.8% and 16.3% in fuel consumption, 33% and 24.5% reduction in CO, 27.4% and 21% reduction in HC and obvious reduction in the exhaust gases temperature for 150CC and 1300CC engines respectively. Also, 17.9% and 22.4% increase in break power and 15.7% and 19.1% increase in thermal efficiency were recorded for 150CC and 1300CC respectively. (2) A new application of HHO gas was in water desalination by modification of conventional solar still to work along 24 h using HHO gas. The productivity of the modified desalination system was increased 4.8 times higher than the conventional system but with lower efficiency by 20%. (3) HHO gas succeeded to be applied as a welding and cutting gas and also mixed with LPG to be used as a home cooking fuel mixture with high efficiency. Future research work aims to progress HHO generator at different working conditions and operating parameters mostly to replace the traditional fuels with HHO gas. Discover new HHO gas applications (for example space shuttles, submarines and farming vehicles) with perspective cleaner production. Also, HHO generator can be integrated with fuel cell to achieve self-sufficiency of electric power and fuel."
