0,Introduction,"The needs of an energy transition and hydrogen characteristics as a clean energy vector, derived in different efforts regarding to the development of new economical and competitive processes as an alternative to the existing ones. In this work an innovative reaction systems are used for hydrogen production; microreactors. These systems provide several benefits if they are compared with a conventional reaction systems. The high surface area/volume relationship, which is around two orders of magnitudes higher in micro structured reactors, is one of the most interesting properties that allows the possibility to increase the weight hourly space velocity, WHSV, of the catalytic reactions. These systems, apart from improving heat and mass-transfer resistances they are also able to reach higher selectivity in the desired products [1–3]. Some of these benefits were demonstrated in a previous work of the author [4]. Apart from facing out the miniaturization of the processes using microreactors, biogas reforming processes were studied for hydrogen and synthesis gas production. Through these processes two of the most important greenhouse gases, GHG, carbon dioxide and methane, are consumed [5] and the obtained syngas low ratios are appropriates for gasoline, gasoil, kerosene, aldehydes and alcohols production [6]. Biogas is commonly produced from biomass anaerobic digestion [2,3] and its composition varied depending on the type of biomass, being the typical (%vol.): 55–70 CH4, 27–44 CO2, <1H2 and <3H2S as well as traces of NH3 [7]. It is considered a carbon dioxide-neutral biofuel and if used as transport fuel instead of fossil fuels, apart from reducing GHG, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particles emissions are also reduced [7–9]. Several compounds that make up the biogas can influence the activity of the catalysts. On one hand, sulphur compounds could inhibit the chemisorption of small molecules (H2, CO, NO, C2H4, etc.) and thus lead to deactivate the catalyst effectiveness for water-gas shift reaction (WGS). Besides, deactivation effects associated with carbon deposition, due to the high temperatures, and the presence of sulphur compounds were also reported [10]. On the other hand, nitrogen compounds are basic, so that they might poison the acid sites of catalysts. Therefore, due to the poisoning effect of S and N compounds, the utilization of the biogas in any catalytic reforming process would require a previous purification stage [11]. Through biogas dry reforming (DR) process, synthesis gas with low CO/H2 ratios can be obtained which are preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons through Fischer Tropsch synthesis network [11–13]. The most important reactions are the following: (1) DR: CH 4 + CO 2 ↔ 2 CO + 2 H 2 ( Δ H 0 = 247 kJ / mol ) (2) RWGS: CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O ( Δ H 0 = 41 kJ / mol ) Due to reversible WGS (RWGS) reaction, CO2 conversions always will be higher than methane conversions. However, the required energy consumption and carbon formation at high temperature on the catalyst surface are the main disadvantages of the process [12,14–17]. In the case of biogas SR process, apart from the mentioned DR reaction, steam methane reforming reaction, SMR, also occurs during the process. The SMR reaction produce three H2 moles per CH4 and H2O mole fed, and the presence of water reduces the possibility of carbon generation on the catalysts surface. In addition, WGS reaction occurs, which contributes producing higher H2 amounts. The most important reactions are the following: (3) SMR: CH 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 ( Δ H 0 = 206 kJ / mol ) (4) WGS: CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 ( Δ H 0 = − 41 kJ / mol ) The main advantage of the biogas OR process is the exothermicity of the catalytic partial oxidation of methane reaction, CPO, since it leads to a significant reduction of the cost. When exothermic CPO is combined with endothermic DR reaction the hot spots produced in the CPO reaction can be significantly reduced in the catalytic bed being possible to reach a thermoneutral process by controlling the CH4/CO2/O2 ratios. Moreover, the presence of oxygen at high temperatures could avoid the carbon deposition in the catalyst [18]. For this process the presence of water was reported so that RWGS reaction it is also necessary to take into account. (5) CPO: CH 4 + 1 / 2 O 2 → CO + 2 H 2 ( Δ H 0 = − 36 kJ / mol ) Thus, new catalytic systems are needed in order to avoid the carbon deposition in DR process, as well as, to reach higher conversions in both biogas SR and OR processes. From an economical point of view, Ni-based catalyst are the most used ones in reforming processes instead of precious metals based catalysts, but a small noble metal addition, as Rh, Pt or Pd can improve the catalyst stability and reducibility [17,19,20]. Regarding to the support modifiers it has been reported that small additions of rare-earth oxides as CeO2 and ZrO2 get better properties of Ni catalyst supported on alumina and avoid their deactivation. Small ZrO2 additions improve the coke resistance of Ni catalysts and a small CeO2 content favours the coke gasification and WGS activity [21–23]. Therefore, in this work, Ni-based catalysts and a bimetallic Rh–Ni catalyst were chosen supported on magnesia and modified alumina with oxides like CeO2 and ZrO2 for biogas SR and OR for hydrogen generation."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ni and Rh–Ni catalysts were prepared supported on magnesia and alumina modified with oxides like CeO2 and ZrO2 as promoters, by wetness impregnation. First, modified alumina supports were prepared using aluminum oxide (BET surface area 255 m2 g−1, pore volume 1.14 cm3 g−1; Alfa Aesar), cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (99.5%; Alfa Aesar) and Zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate (99.99%; Sigma Aldrich). An aqueous solution consisting on 10 mL of water per gram of support was used to dissolve promoters. The amounts of CeO2 and ZrO2 salts precursors were calculated to achieve a nominal content of 6% Ce and 8% Zr for the cerium- and zirconium-doped γ-Al2O3 supports, and 3% Ce and 4% Zr for the cerium-zirconium-doped γ-Al2O3 support. After wetness impregnation, all supports were dried at 373 K and calcined at 1073 K during 1 h and 4 h, respectively. Thereafter, the Ni was incorporated to these supports by impregnation with Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (99.99%; Sigma Aldrich) aqueous solution. The amounts of Ni salt precursor solved were calculated to achieve an intended load of 13% Ni for γ-Al2O3 based supports and 20% Ni for the MgO (Pore volume pore volume 0.14 cm3 g−1; Fluka) support. For the bimetallic catalyst a Rhodium (III) nitrate hydrate (∼36% as rhodium; Sigma Aldrich) aqueous solution was used to achieve an intended load of 1% of Rh. Then, the catalysts were dried and calcined as it has been indicated before. The activity of a commercial catalyst was used (ICI group; Katalco, 57-5 series) for comparison purposes."
3,Reactors,"2.2 Reactors 2.2.1 Fixed bed reactor preparation As a conventional reactor system, a 316-L stainless-steel fixed bed reactor (4.57 mm i.d. and 30 cm length) was used. The same catalyst amount, 340 mg, (0.42–0.50 mm diameter particle size) was used in all fixed bed reactor tests. It was diluted with inert silicon carbide SiC at 1:4.5 w/w (0.5–1.0 mm diameter particle size), in order to avoid temperature gradients in the bed. The diluted catalyst bed was placed in the middle of the reactor and then it was totally filled with another bed of higher diameter CSi particles. This higher size was used in order to separate satisfactorily CSi and tested catalysts after activity experiments. Using 340 mg of catalyst, activity tests for biogas OR and SR processes were carried out at WHSV of 131 ggas·gcat −1 h−1 (see Table 7 ). 2.2.2 Microreactor preparation The microreactors were made of stainless steel with the following composition: 53.22% Fe, 24.21% Cr, 19.09% Ni, 1.97% Si, 1.43% Mn, 0.05% C, 0.02% Pb and 0.001% S (wt.). The impregnated catalyst particle size must be small enough to be fixed and deposited on the channels as well as, to reduce the internal mass-transfer resistance. The external mass-transfer resistance was checked using Mears criteria [24]. Moreover, the microreactors were modeled using Aspen Plus commercial software the process analysis. All the experimental conditions were analyzed and simulated before the experiments in the laboratory [25,26]. The succeeding procedure was followed for the deposition of the micro-nanoparticles on the reactors microchannels [27]: - Catalysts preparation: An IKA mill was used for catalyst particle size reduction. Once powdered, catalysts were sieved and the 37–50 μm mesh fraction was used for the catalytic measurement. - Microreactors preparation: The microreactors were placed in an ultrasonic bath with isopropanol during 10 min for channel cleaning. After drying, they were calcined at 1073 K during 4 h. - Catalysts impregnation: A liquid phase suspension which ensured a perfect adhesion between catalyst and microchannels was prepared for the impregnation. Catalysts were manually impregnated filling microchannels with the suspension and removing the excess. Through this method there is no possibility to previously know the amount of impregnated catalyst. - Conditioning of catalysts and microreactor: After impregnation, the catalysts were calcined at 1073 K during 2 h under oxidative conditions. Then, the platelets were weighted to know the exact amount of the impregnated catalyst (see Table 7). Finally, the platelets were welded and the microreactors conditioned for using them in the activity tests (Fig. 1 )."
4,Activity measurements,"2.3 Activity measurements Biogas SR and OR reactions were carried out to test all catalysts. For all the experiments a model biogas consisting of 60% CH4 and 40% CO2 (vol.) was fed [7,28,29]. Tests were carried out at 1073 K and atmospheric pressure. For SR process, experiments with S/C ratios from 1.0 to 3.0 were performed. In the case of OR process, experiments with O2/CH4 ratios from 0.125 to 0.50 were tested. Once the experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor system, the most stable and active catalysts were chosen to be tested in the microreactors at the same conditions. Using these innovative systems and operating with them at the same temperature, pressure and reactants flow, an increase in the WHSV is expected due to the needed lower catalysts amount. A bench-scale Microactivity plant (PID Eng&Tech), was used for activity tests. The fed mixture gases flows were adjusted by electronic controllers and an HPLC-Gilson liquid pump was used for the desionizated water injection. Both, fixed bed and microreactors reactors were electrically heated in a furnace. The effluent stream was cooled down with a partial condenser. The condensed water was collected and weighted, and the gas phase was online analyzed by a Micro GC equipped with a TCD detector. Three columns, Molsieve 5 Å PLOT, CP-Sil 5 CB and Poraplot Q, were used in a series arrangement for the complete separation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen and methane. Before running the activity tests, each catalyst was reduced at 1073 K, using 350 NmL/min of a 3:1 N2:H2 mixture, during 4 h for all the reaction systems. The activity tests lasted 90 min and started after the process was stabilized. The measured parameters were defined as: Methane conversion: X CH 4 ( % ) = ( V CH 4 in − V CH 4 out ) / V CH 4 in · 100 Carbon dioxide conversion: X CO 2 ( % ) = ( V CO 2 in − V CO 2 out ) / V CO 2 in · 100 Hydrogen yield: H 2 yield ( % ) = V H 2 out / ( 2 · V CH 4 in + V H 2 O in ) · 100 ( H 2 / CO ) out molar ratio: ( H 2 / CO ) out = ( V H 2 / V CO ) out Where: V i in corresponds to the volumetric flow-rate of reactant i (NmL/min). V i out corresponds to the volumetric flow-rate of product i (NmL/min). The turnover frequency, TOF (moles of converted methane per mole of active metal and second), and catalyst productivity, PROD, (moles of hydrogen produced per mole of active metal and second) is defined as the velocity of the reaction measured at the catalytic surface [30–32] which truly reflects the activity level of available catalytically active sites on surface. In the present work, each exposed Ni metal atom on the surface is considered as an active site for methane or carbon dioxide conversion. For the Rh–Ni bimetallic catalyst, the number of surface Rh metal atoms was also taken into account. CH 4 Turnover Frequency: TOF CH 4 ( s − 1 ) = X CH 4 · N CH 4 in / ( w cat · wt Me · D Me / Pm Me ) H 2 catalyst productivity: PROD H 2 ( s − 1 ) = N H 2 out / ( w cat · wt Me · D Me ) / Pm Me ) Where: N i corresponds to the molar flow of i (methane or hydrogen) in mol/s. wcat is the catalyst weight in each reactor system. wtMe is the elemental weight given by ICP-AES. DMe is the metal dispersion for the catalyst. PmMe is the metal molecular weight."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization Fresh catalysts were characterized by different techniques. An inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) instrument, model 2000-DV (Perkin Elmer), was used for the determination of the metallic compounds in the catalysts. The catalysts were properly dissolved using a digester and thereafter, analyzed by ICP-AES instrument. The textural properties, BET surface area and pore volume and diameter, of the calcined and outgassed (at 423 K for 24 h) catalysts were evaluated by means of N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained at 77 K using an Autosorb 1C-TCD. Through temperature programmed reduction, TPR, the reducible species formed during calcination step of the catalysts, and the reduction temperature were determined. The measurements were carried out using an Autosorb 1C-TCD apparatus, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. A continuous flow of 5% H2/Ar (40 NmL/min) was passed over 500 mg of calcined catalyst powder. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 1273 K at a rate of 10 K/min. The sample was previously outgassed at 573 K during 30 min. SEM micrographs of fresh reduced catalysts and used catalysts were obtained using a JEOL JSM-7000-F scanning electron microscope equipped with a Schottky field emission cathode. Surface composition was studied by combination of backscattered electron imaging and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) using an Oxford Instruments Inca Energy 350 spectrometer installed in the same microscope. Images were also taken from secondary electron detectors in order to study surface morphology. These micrographs provide information about the dispersion of the particles in the catalytic surface as well as, the particle size distributions. Nickel dispersion was measured by H2-pulse chemisorption at 313 K in the Autosorb 1C-TCD unit. Prior to pulse chemisorption experiment, all samples were reduced under pure H2 flow (40 NmL/min) for 2 h at 1073 K. To calculate metal dispersion, adsorption stoichiometry of H/Ni = 2 was assumed. The X-ray powder diffraction, XRD, patterns were collected by using a PHILIPS X’PERT PRO automatic diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, in theta–theta configuration, secondary monochromator with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a PIXcel solid state detector. The samples were mounted on a zero background silicon wafer fixed in a generic sample holder. Data were collected from 10 to 80° 2θ (step size = 0.026 and time per step = 625 s) at RT. A fixed divergence and antiscattering slit giving a constant volume of sample illumination were used. XPS technique was used to evaluate the surface characteristics (oxidation state of the species formed, interactions, atomic ratios, etc) of the samples. The measurements were carried out with a VG Escalab 200R spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser and an Al Ka1 (hν = 1486.6 eV) 120 W X-ray source. The powdered samples were deposited on a stainless steel sample holder, placed in the pre-treatment chamber and degassed at 573 K. The base pressure of the spectrometer was typically 10−9 torr. The spectra were collected at pass energy of 20 eV, which is typical of high resolution conditions. Both fresh and used catalysts were analysed with this technique."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Fresh catalysts characterization results,"3.1 Fresh catalysts characterization results 3.1.1 Chemical composition, ICP-AES, and textural properties, BET The catalysts chemical compositions, which were determined by ICP-AES, are shown in Table 1. It was necessary to develop two different methodologies for catalyst disgregation. In the first one, a solution that consisted of HCl, HNO3 and HF was used for Ni, Rh, Zr and Ca quantification. With this method it was not possible to detect any Ce, due to CeF2 precipitate formation. For Ce quantification, a solution that consisted of H2O2 and HNO3 was used [33]. After preparing the corresponding solutions, the catalysts were properly disgregated using a digester and thereafter analyzed by ICP-AES instrument. As it can be observed, the metal compositions of most of the tested catalysts are slightly lower than their nominal ones. In the case of the Ce content, for both, Ni/Ce–Al2O3 and Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalysts, is significantly lower than the expected one. With regard to the commercial catalyst, Ca and Ni were only measured even though other species could be present. The textural properties of fresh calcined catalysts are also outlined in Table 1. Commercial and Ni/MgO catalysts presented the lowest surface area and pore volume. With regards to the pore size, Ni/MgO catalyst showed the largest value as compared to the Al2O3 containing catalysts. Regarding the prepared supports, as it should be expected, the more modifier is added, the lower surface area was measured. CeO2 modified γ-Al2O3 support reached the highest surface area. Using ZrO2 as promoter, instead of CeO2, all textural parameter's values decreased. Finally, when the two promoters were used simultaneously, similar results as for CeO2 promoted ones were measured. 3.1.2 Temperature-programmed reduction, TPR Fig. 2 shows all TPR profiles of fresh calcined supports and catalysts. Ni/MgO catalyst showed almost no reduction, and its main reduction peak appeared at 858 K [34]. Regarding the commercial catalyst, four different reduction peaks were detected being the biggest one at 1048 K. For the rest of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, the main reduction peaks appeared in the range 900 K–1200 K. Different reduction peaks were observed for the promoted supports. For Ce–Zr–Al2O3, Ce–Al2O3 and Zr–Al2O3 supports contributions were measured at 690 K, 880 K, 1000 K and 1170 K. For all of them very small peaks were observed. If calcined catalysts and calcined supports profiles are compared, lower H2 consumption was detected. The main peaks of Ni/Zr–Al2O3, Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3 and Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalysts appeared at 1103 K, 1105 K and 1108 K respectively. Thus, this is a possible indication of Ce reduction taking place at higher temperatures than Zr reduction. If Ni/Ce–Al2O3 and Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalysts are compared, lower reduction temperature was needed for the last one (1079 K). This could be related to the “spill over” effect which improved the nickel reducibility [16]. According to the literature, these broad peaks can be attributed to the contribution of three different species. The peaks around 950 K are attributed to the reduction of NiO–Al species with weak interaction with alumina support, while the reduction peaks reported at higher temperatures are related to the reduction of highly dispersed non-stoichiometric amorphous nickel aluminate spinels at around 1050 K and to a diluted NiAl2O4-like phase at 1100 K, respectively [28,34]. In Fig. 3 , deconvolution of the TPR profile for Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst is shown. For this catalyst, the main peaks correspond to three different species that appeared at 914 K, 1024 K and 1086 K. Moreover, a small peak in Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst profile was observed at 770 K which could be attributed to the Rh reduction [35]. The quantitative TPR data of calcined catalysts after main peaks deconvolution are summarized in Table 2. 3.1.3 Calcined catalysts SEM micrographs SEM micrographs of calcined catalysts were taken in order to analyze their composition, catalytic surface, and particles size distributions. The results of the microscopy study are summarized in Figs. 4 and 5 combining backscattered electron imaging and EDX. In Fig. 4, the commercial calcined catalyst SEM picture and EDX spectrum can be observed. The EDX analysis confirms the presence of Ni, Ca and Al in the selected area (A2) as well as in all analyzed regions. Some Ni aggregates can be observed with sizes in the range between 10 and 250 nm but not individual Ni particle size can be estimated. Therefore, the composition determined by ICP-AES was confirmed by the EDX analysis, being Ni, Ca and Al2O3 the major components of the catalysts. Ni/MgO calcined catalyst SEM picture and EDX spectrum are shown also in this figure. EDX analysis confirms the presence of Ni and Mg in the analyzed A1 area. Smaller aggregates size distribution than for the commercial catalyst was measured. Also in the same figure the Ni/Ce–Al2O3 calcined catalyst SEM picture and EDX spectrum are reported. EDX analysis confirms the presence of Ni and Al in the selected area (A2) as well as in all analyzed region. In this area Ce was not detected. Regarding the aggregates size, particles smaller than 100 nm were detected. Ni/Zr–Al2O3 calcined catalyst SEM picture and EDX spectrum are shown in Fig. 5. For this catalyst Ni, Zr and Al were detected in the selected area (A1) as well as in the analyzed region (A5). As it can be observed, bigger aggregates size than for the rest of analyzed catalysts was measured, in the range of 2 μm–100 nm. In this figure, the Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3 calcined catalyst SEM picture and EDX spectrum are also reported. For this catalyst Ni, Ce, Zr and Al were detected in most of the analyzed regions. In addition, a big difference in the aggregates size distribution was also observed. The aggregates were measured in the range between 1 μm–10 nm. Finally, also in Fig. 5 the last calcined catalyst, Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3, SEM picture and EDX spectrum are shown. For this catalyst, aggregates size distribution smaller than 100 nm was measured, and Rh, Ni, Ce and Al were detected. For this catalyst, uniform dispersion of Rh and Ni aggregates can be observed. 3.1.4 H2 pulse chemisorption Table 3 summarizes the amounts of exposed nickel atoms in the reduced catalysts, which were determined by pulsed-H2 chemisorption. The analyzed catalysts were the ones used in the microreactors. For these catalytic systems, the metal dispersion degree of the catalysts was relatively low, as it is typically observed for high Ni content catalysts [16]. In the case of Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst, the highest values of active metal surface area, dispersion and crystallite size were measured. 3.1.5 X-ray powder diffraction, XRD, patterns XRD measurements were performed in order to obtain the crystallite average size of Ni, ceria and zirconium phases through the application of Scherrer equation. Applying this equation to the best defined Ni0 reflections (43.26° for the Ni/MgO catalyst and around 52° for the rest of the catalysts) the Ni° average crystallites sizes were calculated and summarized in the Table 3. Highest Ni° crystallites were measured for the commercial (23 nm) and Ni/MgO (46 nm) catalyst. For comparison purposes, and due to the high peaks observed for Ni/MgO catalyst, the XRD profiles of the other catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . Taking into account that XRD technique presents limitations for crystalline particles size below than 2–4 nm [36], CeO2 characteristic reflections were not measured. This fact can be due to the good dispersion of the CeO2 particles or due to the overlap with Ni high intensity reflections [21]. In the case of ZrO2 particles, crystallite particles of 9 nm for the Ni/Zr–Al2O3 catalyst and of 11 nm for the Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3 catalyst were measured. According to the literature, the peaks that correspond to these measurements can be attributed to the mixture of tetragonal, monoclinic and cubic structures [37]. For both catalysts, Ni° crystallites of 7 nm were measured. 3.1.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS, studies The XPS study (Table 4) reveals the oxidation state of the formed species and the surface atomic ratios. The Commercial catalyst was the one showing more reduced metal phases, and in contrast, the reduction level of Ni/MgO catalyst was lower as the TPR analyses suggested. The rest of alumina supported catalysts suffer almost the same reduction level. Taking into account the reduction rates and comparing these results with the TPR analysis, it can be said that the Ni of the diluted NiAl2O4 phase is the one which was not totally reduced. Moreover, the Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst suffered the highest reduction level but it was lower than the predicted one by the TPR analyses. This effect can be related with the higher metal crystallite size measured by the hydrogen pulse chemisorption technique which can difficult the reduction of the Ni and Rh particles. Attending to the binding energies, if the Ni/Zr–Al2O3 catalyst spectrum is compared with the spectrum of the rest of catalysts, a difference of 2 eV in the binging energies of Ni 2p3/2, Zr 3d5/2 and Al 2p can be observed. According to the literature the typically assigned binding energies for the analyzed species are: Al3+ = 74.5 eV, NiAl2O3 = 256.5 eV, Ni0 = 252.0 eV, Ce4+ = 881.0 eV and Zr4+ = 182 eV [30,37,38], which are in good agreement with the ones detected for the rest of catalysts. Comparing the measured surface atomic ratios with the determined ones using ICP-AES, Ni surface dispersion was improved in the commercial, Ni/MgO and Ni/Zr–Al2O3 catalysts. However for the cerium doped catalysts, the increase of Ce surface dispersion decreased the Ni and Rh surface dispersion. In the case of zirconium-doped catalysts the Zr dispersion decreased."
8,Activity results,"3.2 Activity results All the activity tests started after the system stabilized and lasted 90 min. The reported measurements values correspond to the mean of the last two analyses. All catalysts were tested at the same conditions and the same analysis procedure was also carried out for all of them. Experimental results for fixed bed reactor in biogas OR process at O2/CH4 = 0.25 are compiled in Fig. 7 . This figure shows that methane and carbon dioxide equilibrium conversion was almost reached by all tested catalysts. In addition, hydrogen yield was higher than 80% for all catalysts. The highest values of conversion and hydrogen yield were achieved for Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 and Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3 catalysts. In these experiments, operating at higher ratios (O2/CH4 = 0.50) catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPO) was promoted, decreasing carbon dioxide conversion and consequently, the hydrogen yield. On the contrary, DR reaction mainly occurred using lower ratios (O2/CH4 = 0.125) which decreased methane conversion and consequently, also hydrogen yield. In both cases, H2 out/COout molar ratio remained more or less constant (see Table 5 and Fig. 8 ). Considering environmental and economical benefits O2/CH4 = 0.25 ratio is the most interesting one. Activity results for biogas SR process at different S/C ratios are presented in Table 6. For this processes methane and carbon dioxide conversions were very close to the equilibrium value and in some cases, higher than the predicted ones by the equilibrium. For these experiments, the highest methane and CO2 conversion values were reached by Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 and Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3 catalysts. In the case of the hydrogen yield and H2 out/COout molar ratio measured values are slightly lower for these two catalysts. This effect might be due to their selectivity for the DR reaction, which produced 1 mol H2 less and 1 mol CO more per mole of CH4 than in the SR reaction. Increasing the S/C parameter, methane conversion remained constant but lower carbon dioxide conversions were measured (See Fig. 9 ). This effect contributed to the reduction of the hydrogen yield. However, H2 out/COout molar ratio increased through the WGS reaction. As a result, the effect of adding water affected negatively to the DR reaction promoting the WGS reaction. For this process at ratio of S/C equal to 1.0 the highest carbon dioxide conversions and hydrogen yields were reached. Comparing biogas OR and SR processes two main differences can be observed. Firstly, regarding to the activity, the thermodynamics of biogas OR process allows reaching higher carbon dioxide conversions which makes possible to obtain higher hydrogen yields. In addition, despite the higher methane conversion predicted by the equilibrium for the biogas SR process (98.5%), this difference is very low if it is compared with the predicted one for the biogas OR process (97.3%). Secondly, the exothermicity of the OR process is a very important factor with respect to the economics of the process. Due to this two factors biogas OR process was the studied one in the microreactors. For this study, catalysts which achieved the highest activities and behaved more stable were impregnated in a microreactor to test its performance. As it can be observed in Table 7, this innovative reaction system allows an important increase in the WHSV and makes them to be a real alternative for process intensification. Thus, Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3 and Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalysts were chosen for the impregnation on microreactors, as well as Ni/Ce–Al2O3 for comparison purposes. The reactants flow fed in the microreactor was the same as for fixed bed reactor. In Table 7, the comparison of the activity results between microreactor and fixed bed reactor for biogas OR process at O2/CH4 = 0.25 are shown. High methane and carbon dioxide conversions were achieved being them close to the equilibrium predicted values. Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst obtained the highest conversions values and hydrogen yield. However, Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst reached the highest H2/CO ratio values which can be related to the selectivity of this catalyst for WGS reaction. The comparison between conventional and advanced reaction systems can be observed in Fig. 10 . In this case, CH4 TOF and H2 PROD values were calculated in order to obtain a better comparison of activity results. Higher TOF and PROD values were obtained for tested microreactors, which may be due to the use of lower catalysts amounts. With regards to the catalytic activity, higher TOF and PROD values were obtained by Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst in all measured cases, due to the lower metal dispersion."
9,Tested catalysts characterization results,"3.3 Tested catalysts characterization results 3.3.1 Tested catalysts SEM micrographs In Fig. 11 , catalysts SEM micrographs after biogas OR process are shown. These images were taken using backscattered electron imaging technique in order to study the surface composition. The micrographs correspond to the catalysts surface after biogas OR at O2/CH4 = 0.125. Evidence of nickel aggregates distribution can be seen as well as their small particle size. Comparing with calcined catalysts SEM micrographs, a very similar aggregates size was measured so that apparently no sinterization effect occurred in all analyzed catalysts. As commented before, under these conditions DR process is promoted and as a result the presence of carbon filaments could be expected. However, the catalytic surfaces of most of the catalysts appeared apparently free of carbon. This could be due to the presence of oxygen at high temperatures that avoided carbon deposition in the catalytic surfaces. In the case of commercial and Ni/MgO catalysts the presence of small carbon filaments growth was detected. 3.3.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS, studies Fig. 12 represents the relationship between the reached hydrogen yield in the biogas OR process at O2/CH4 = 0.25 and the surface atomic ratios measured by XPS. These ratios corresponds to the fresh reduced catalysts and to the catalysts tested after biogas OR processes. As it can be observed, the surface atomic ratio of the commercial, Ni/MgO and Ni/Zr–Al2O3 catalysts decreased more comparing them with the rest of catalysts. This effect can be attributed to the carbon filaments detected by SEM in the surface of commercial and Ni/MgO catalysts. The carbon is normally deposited in the Ni particles and as a result, the superficial Ni decreased. In addition, in spite of the improvements in the Ni surface dispersion for these three catalysts (compared with the ICP-AES measurements), the lowest hydrogen yield were achieved. For the rest of catalysts, Ni/Ce–Al2O3, NiCe–Zr–Al2O3 and Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalysts, although lower surface ratios were measured but higher hydrogen yields were reached. Besides, smaller surface atomic ratios were measured before and after activity tests. Therefore, the XPS analysis confirms the better behavior of these three catalysts in the experiments carried out."
10,Conclusions,"The main goal of this work is the biogas valorisation for hydrogen production by means of biogas SR or OR processes using Ni or Rh–Ni catalysts on promoted alumina. Furthermore, two different reaction systems were compared, a conventional fixed bed reactor and a microreactor system. High methane and carbon dioxide conversions were reached by all tested catalysts in the fixed bed reactor for biogas SR and OR processes. For the biogas SR process, increasing the S/C ratio lower carbon dioxide conversions were measured, which implied a decrease of the hydrogen yield. Consequently, at S/C = 1.0 were measured the best results. In the case of biogas OR process, the maximum hydrogen yield was obtained at O2/CH4 = 0.25, which corresponds to intermediate values of methane and carbon dioxide conversions. For the biogas SR process, the lowest hydrogen yield and H2 out/COout molar ratio were measured for the bimetallic, Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3, and monometallic, Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3, catalysts. Although these two catalysts reached the highest methane and carbon dioxide conversions for the two processes studied. In the case of biogas OR process, highest hydrogen yield and H2out/COout molar ratio were also obtained using these two catalysts. Thus, Ni/Ce–Zr–Al2O3 and Rh–Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalysts were chosen for their impregnation on microreactors, as well as Ni/Ce–Al2O3 for comparison purposes. Due to the reached highest conversions and hydrogen yields, only experiments for biogas OR process at O2/CH4 = 0.25 were carried out in the microreactor systems. Operating with them, conversions similar to the ones measured using the fixed-bed reactor were achieved, being Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst the one producing the highest hydrogen yield. But if the TOF and productivity values are analyzed, operating with a microreactor the catalytic activity measured is one order of magnitude higher than the achieved one in the fixed bed reactor. According to the characterization carried out this Ni/Ce–Al2O3 catalyst presented the lowest nickel dispersion, and as similar high conversions were obtained for all three catalysts, this one achieved the highest TOF results. If lower temperatures had been used in the activity tests it can be expected that lower conversions would have been measured and under those more exigent conditions, it could be expected that the other two promoted catalysts will present some advantages."
