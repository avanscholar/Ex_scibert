0,Introduction,"In the last decades, a great number of papers about the study of different carbonaceous materials as catalytic supports were published, many of them related with the different surface properties, chemical stability and surface areas of these materials [1–8]. Today, the researching efforts are focused to enhance activity and selectivity and reduce the cost in the catalytic processing of compounds in numerous fields such as fuels, fine chemicals, and pollution reduction. These studies are very interesting due to the extensive variety of activated carbons, such as powers, fibers, cloths, felts, and monoliths, and the more recent appearance of nanostructured materials [9,10]. An example is the increasing scientific interest received by the carbon nanotubes since its discovery in 1991 [11], due to the exceptional physico-chemical properties they show, this making them attractive as catalytic materials. In this sense, such structures could show unusual behaviors in relation to activity and selectivity compared with the classic supports, especially for liquid-phase reactions, in which diffusional restrictions inside the porous structure could be present. Carbon nanotubes have unique properties such as excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, uniform pore size distribution, meso and macropore structure, and high length-to-diameter aspect ratio, the latter providing them with a high external surface area [12,13]. It must be noted that pores in multi-wall carbon nanotubes can be divided into inner hollow cavities of small diameter (narrowly distributed, mainly 3–6nm) and mainly aggregated pores (widely distributed, 20–40nm) formed by interaction of isolated carbon nanotubes [14]. So, these special textural properties could influence the metallic particle size distribution, dispersion, extent of reduction, but also reduce the problems of mass transfer rates and allow to obtain high catalytic performances compared with conventional supports [15]. Besides, due to the peculiar three-dimensional nanoscale structure of nanotubes with graphene layers deviated from planarity, which confer them a good electrical conductivity, a transfer of electronic density from the support to the deposited metallic particles [16–19] could occur changing the properties of metallic phase and the catalytic behavior [20]. On the other hand, it is also thought that the tailoring of nanostructured catalysts supported on functionalized carbon nanotubes could lead to new electronic and catalytic properties [9,21–23]. In this sense, the nature and concentration of surface functional groups on carbonaceous materials can be modified by suitable thermal or chemical treatments. Oxidation can be used to increase the concentration of surface oxygen groups, while heating under an inert atmosphere can be used to selectively remove some of these functions. Thus, the surface oxygenated groups created during support oxidation could act as anchoring centers for the metal precursor, but also, it is known from electrical measurements on oxidized nanotubes that the functionalization significantly reduces the conductivity of the carbon nanotubes [24–27]. On the contrary, the removal of surface oxygenated groups would evidence the existence of other anchoring sites and could lead to a different dispersion of metallic phase [28], increase the electrical conductivity of nanotubes, and produce an enrichment of electron density surrounding the metallic nanoparticles [19,24,29,30]. So, it is expected that different catalytic behaviors will be observed with catalysts prepared from supports with different concentration of surface oxygenated groups, but the extent of the effects above mentioned is not very clear. In this sense, some works, focused on the study of properties of carbonaceous materials as supports, have been carried out in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes over platinum or ruthenium catalysts [4], but in general, it does not exist a consensus in the bibliography about the effect of the functional groups over the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (UA) [24,29–36]. The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a key step mainly for the preparation of different fine chemicals, such as flavors, perfumes, and intermediary materials for the development of pharmaceutical products [37–39]. In these unsaturated aldehydes, though the hydrogenation of the double bond CC is thermodynamically favored, a good selectivity to the hydrogenation of the CO group can be obtained with different supported metallic catalysts [4,40,41]. Among different factors, the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols could be increased by the presence of electronic effects of the support, the addition of a second metal to the active metal, and the size and morphology of the metallic particles [42–46]. In this paper, Pt-based catalysts supported on multiple wall carbon nanotubes were characterized and evaluated in selective hydrogenation in order to study the influence of the presence of different functional groups and the impurities of the carbonaceous material on the catalytic behavior in liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to α,β-unsaturated alcohols. Citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal) was selected as a model molecule of unsaturated aldehyde because it is an abundant raw material from the lemongrass oil, and this substrate was less studied in selective hydrogenation with catalysts supported over carbon nanotubes. Recently, several publications have appeared in which nanostructured carbonaceous materials are examined as catalytic support for hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [9,18,19,24,29,30,35,47–52]. Promising results were found especially for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation with catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes and nanofibers which were evaluated and compared with those obtained from the corresponding catalysts prepared over other supports [53–56]. However, there are very few works that report the hydrogenation of citral with monometallic catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes [57–62], and neither of them relates the genesis of the carbon nanotubes and the impurity content with the catalytic behavior. Besides, these works did not use bimetallic catalysts and they were not focused in obtaining high selectivities to unsaturated alcohols. On the contrary, our work refers to the study of mono and bimetallic catalysts (Pt and PtFe) with excellent selectivities to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols of citral (geraniol and nerol)."
1,Experimental,"Commercial multiple wall carbon nanotubes (MWCN from Sunano, purity >90%, diameter: 10–30nm, length: 1–10μm) with the following textural properties: S BET =211m2 g−1, V pore =0.46cm3 g−1, were used as a catalytic support. Elementary analysis of the impurities of the carbon nanotubes was carried out by EDX. The original impurity content was 6.25wt.% (Fe: 2.779; Al: 2.021; Cl: 0.860; Si: 0.336; S: 0.101; and Ca: 0.051wt.%). The content of amorphous carbon reported by the manufacturer was <5%. The multiple wall carbon nanotubes used as support were named CN."
2,Oxidative treatments of the supports,"2.1 Oxidative treatments of the supports The carbon nanotubes were submitted to different oxidative treatments to purify and functionalize the surface of carbon nanotubes with different oxygen groups. Three different techniques were used for this study: (1) Purification and functionalization with successive treatments with aqueous solutions of HCl, HNO3, and HF: The carbon nanotubes were submitted to successive treatments with 10wt.% aqueous solutions of HCl, HNO3, and HF, respectively, at room temperature for 48h without stirring [63,64]. It was used a volume of solution/mass of support ratio of 30mLg−1. After HCl and HNO3 treatments, the support was filtered and repeatedly washed with deionized water up to a final pH=4. After the HF treatment, carbon nanotubes were filtered and washed with deionized water up to the final pH of the washing water. Then, the support was dried at 120°C during 24h and finally crushed to a powder. The CN treated with the three inorganic acids was named CN–FCNF. (2) Purification and functionalization with HNO3 : In this case, a portion of carbon nanotubes were acid-treated as follows: the support (10g) was put in contact with 100mL of nitric acid (5M) at 120°C and refluxed in a Soxhlet for 3h [65–67]. Then, the support was filtered in a fritted glass funnel and washed with distilled water up to neutralization. The CN acid-treated was dried at 120°C for 24h and finally crushed to a powder. The CN portion treated with nitric acid was named CN–FN. (3) Functionalization with citric acid: A dispersion of 10g of carbon nanotubes, 10g of citric acid and 100mL of distilled water was prepared by ultrasonic mixing. The mixture was evaporated until a paste was obtained. The paste was dried at 120°C during 24h, and then, it was calcined under flowing N2 at 300°C for 1h [68]. Finally, the support was crushed to a powder. The CN treated with the citric acid was named CN–FC. It must be noted that after the oxidative treatments (in samples of carbon nanotubes treated with inorganic acids), the impurity content of the carbon nanotubes was dramatically reduced, and the purity increased from 93.75% to 99.55%. The final impurity content for the CN–FCNF was 0.45wt.% (Fe: 0.2136; Cl: 0.2349; Al: 0.0111; Si: 0.0103; S: 0.0036; Cr: 0.0031; Ca: 0.0029; Ni: 0.0025; and K: 0.0007wt.%). In the case of treatment with citric acid, not all inorganic impurities were removed, Fe content, for example, remained in the same proportion."
3,Reductive treatment of the supports,"2.2 Reductive treatment of the supports CN, CN–FCNF, and CN–FN supports were treated at 700°C under hydrogen flow for 4h to remove the oxygen-containing groups from carbon nanotubes surfaces. The supports were called [CN]–H2700, [CN–FC]–H2700, [CN–FCNF]–H2700, and [CN–FN]–H2700."
4,Characterization techniques of the supports,"2.3 Characterization techniques of the supports 2.3.1 Textural characteristics The specific surface area (S BET) and the pore volume of the different supports were obtained by N2 adsorption at −196°C in a Quantachrome Corporation NOVA-1000 equipment. Before obtaining adsorption isotherms, the samples were outgassed at temperature of 403°C. 2.3.2 Surface chemistry The surface chemistry of carbon nanotubes with different pre-treatments was determined by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments, which were carried out in a differential flow reactor coupled to a thermal conductivity detector. Samples (0.300g) were heated in an electric furnace at 6°C min−1 from 25 to 750°C. During the TPD experiments, He was passed through the reactor with a flow rate of 9mLmin−1. Samples were stabilized with He at room temperature for 1h before the TPD experiments. 2.3.3 Isoelectric point and surface charge densities Surface charge densities and isoelectric point of carbon nanotubes functionalized and without oxidative treatment were determined by titration or neutralization at constant pH in aqueous solution of KNO3 [69,70]. The equilibration and titrations were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere to eliminate the influence of atmospheric CO2. First, the aqueous solution of KNO3 (0.1N) was stirred, while purified N2 was bubbled through the system at room temperature. The pH of the solution was maintained constant (at pH=7) by using nitric acid o potassium hydroxide. Then, the samples of carbon nanotubes (0.500g) were suspended into the aqueous solution and allowed to equilibrate, thus obtaining the corresponding value of the isoelectric point. Then, the carbon suspensions were titrated with either 0.05N nitric acid or 0.05N potassium hydroxide, adding 1mL of titrating agent, with 120s of equilibration time between additions until obtaining the pH 2 or 11, respectively. The basic or acid quantities added to maintain pH at a given value are recorded as a function of time."
5,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.4 Preparation of the catalysts The preparation of the monometallic Pt catalysts was carried out by impregnation of the corresponding support with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (1.67gL−1) at 25°C for 6h. In all cases, the Pt amount used for the impregnation was the appropriate to obtain a Pt content of 5wt.%. In order to obtain an homogeneous wetting of these materials and an uniform contact between the solid and the impregnating solution, a stirring rate of 250rpm was used for an impregnating volume/support weight ratio of 30mLg−1. The excess of solution was evaporated after impregnation. Then, the samples were dried at 120°C overnight and then the supports were crushed to a powder. On the other hand, PtFe bimetallic catalysts over CN–FCNF support were prepared by co-impregnation of the corresponding precursors and using a impregnation volume/mass of support=30mLg−1. Thus, the support was impregnated with a solution containing H2PtCl6 and FeCl3. The concentrations of the metallic precursors in the impregnating solution were such as to obtain the desired loadings in the catalysts (Pt: 5wt.% and Fe: 0.35, 0.95 and 1.5wt.%). Finally, the samples were dried at 120°C overnight and then the catalysts were crushed to a powder. It must be noted that some catalysts were submitted to further thermal reductive treatment in order to modify the concentration of surface functional groups of the support and to induce sintering. This reductive treatment consisted of a initial reduction at 350°C in a H2 flow for 3h followed by a thermal treatment under nitrogen flow at 700°C for 12h (in some cases, other times for reductive treatment with N2, such as 4 and 8h, were tested too). The catalysts were referred in the text by the denomination of the corresponding catalyst followed by –N2700. Table 1 summarizes the preparation methods used for the different catalysts."
6,Characterization of catalysts,"2.5 Characterization of catalysts The test reactions of the metallic phase (cyclohexane dehydrogenation –CHD– and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis –CPH–) were performed in a differential continuous flow reactor at 250 and 350°C, respectively. In both reactions, the catalysts were previously reduced “in situ” in flowing H2 at 350°C for 3h. The experiments were performed by using H2/CH and H2/CP molar ratios equal to 26 and 29, respectively, and a volumetric flow of 600mLmin−1 in both reactions. The catalyst weight used in these tests reaction experiments was such as to obtain a conversion lower than 5%, since under these conditions the behavior of the reactor follows a differential flow reactor model allowing the correct measurement of the initial rate and activation energy. The reaction products and the remaining reactants were analyzed by using a gas chromatographic system. The activation energy values for CHD (E aCH) were calculated by linear regression using the reaction rates measured at three temperatures (250, 240 and 230°C) and the Arrhenius plot (ln r oCH versus 1/T (K−1)). The catalysts were also characterized by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) by using a reductive mixture of H2 (5%v/v)–N2 (9mLmin−1) in a flow reactor. Samples were heated at 6°C min−1 from 25 to 800°C. Before TPR experiments, the impregnated samples were stabilized with N2 at room temperature for 1h. XPS determinations were carried out in a Multitechnic Specs photoemission electron spectrometer equipped with an X-ray source Mg/Al and a hemispherical analyzer PHOIBOS 150 in the fixed analyzer transmission mode (FAT). The spectrometer operates with an energy power of 100eV, and the spectra were obtained with a pass energy of 30eV and a Mg anode operated at 100W. The pressure of the analysis chamber was kept a pressure lower than 5×10−8 mbar. Samples were previously reduced under H2 at 500°C for 3h in a flow reactor, and then, they were introduced in the equipment and reduced “in situ” with H2 at 400°C for 1h. The binding energies (BE) of the signals were referred to the C1s peak at 284eV. Peak areas and BE values were estimated by fitting the curves with combination of Lorentzian–Gaussian curves of variable proportion using the CasaXPS Peak-fit software version 1.2. TEM measurements were carried out on a JEOL 100CX microscope with a nominal resolution of 0.6nm, operated with an acceleration voltage of 100kV, and magnification ranges of 80,000× and 100,000×. The samples were prepared by grinding, suspending and sonicating them in ethanol, and putting a drop of the suspension on a carbon copper grid. After evaporation of the solvent, the specimens were introduced into the microscope column. For each catalyst, a very important number of Pt particles (about 150) were observed and the distribution curves of particle sizes were done. The mean metallic particle diameter (d) was calculated as: d = ∑ n i · d i ∑ n i , where ni is the number of particles of diameter di ."
7,Hydrogenation of citral,"2.6 Hydrogenation of citral The different catalysts were tested in the citral hydrogenation at 70°C and atmospheric pressure in a discontinuous reactor with a device for sampling the reaction products. In each experiment, 0.3mL of citral (Aldrich, 61% cis and 36% trans) was hydrogenated by using 0.300g of catalyst and 30mL of solvent (2-propanol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 1400rpm (in order to minimize the limitations by mass transfer steps). It is noted that from previous experiments, diffusional limitations were found to be absent under these conditions. Prior to the reaction, catalysts were reduced “in situ” under flowing H2 at 350°C for 3h, and then, they were cooled down to the reaction temperature. The reaction products were analyzed in a GC system coupled to a capilar column (Supelcowax 10M) and using a FID detector. All products were identified by using gas chromatography standards except for 3,7-dimethyloctanal and other secondary products. These products were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technique. The calculation of the activity and selectivity was made by using the internal normalization methods. The catalytic activity was defined as the sum of percentages of citral converted into different products. The selectivity to a given product (i) was calculated as the ratio between the amount of product i and the total amounts of products."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Support characterization,"3.1 Support characterization Surface characteristics (BET area, pore volume, and isoelectric points) of different carbon nanotubes used as supports are compiled in Table 2 . The effects of purification, functionalization, and thermal treatments of carbon nanotubes on the textural properties were evaluated from the measurements of BET surface area and pore volume. It must be noted that the values of the constant (C) of BET isotherm ranged between 150–180, and they were adequate in order to obtain with precision the measurements of BET monolayer capacity [71]. The values of BET surface area and the pore volumes for the supports treated with inorganic acids (CN–FN and CN–FCNF) and organic acid (CN–FC) decrease after purification and functionalization of the original carbon nanotubes, which could reveal a negative effect and a change of their intrinsic textural properties. It must be noted that there is a slight diminution of the S BET and pore volume (about 15–19 of S BET and 15–26% of pore volume) for CN–FN and CN–FCNF supports, while the CN–FC sample shows an important diminution of these properties (about 50% of S BET and 66% of pore volume). Solhy et al. [29] reported the existence of two kinetic regimes for carbon nanotubes oxidation by HNO3 associated with a fast formation of carboxylic groups for reactions times lower than 1h, and with a much slower functionalization rate after 1h. They related the first step with the consumption of amorphous carbon present on the CN surface and functionalization of carbon at CN defects rather than to a direct attack on the graphene layers. The second step was related with a change in their intrinsic morphology due to partial destruction or diminution of micropore walls, number of walls and closed tips, the latter produced by blocking of the nanotube diameter with Fe particles, which could catalyze the burn-off of the support. Thus, the partial destruction of micropore walls and number of walls would contribute to the diminution of the surface area, while the opening of CN tips would contribute to increase the surface area of the material. Besides, it must be taken into account that the presence of compartments produced by Fe particles located inside the tube cavity could prevent the nitrogen access to the inner cavity of the nanotubes (with or without functionalization), and it could reduce the surface area. So, from these opposing effects, it was observed a slight decrease in textural properties for CN–FN and CN–FCNF supports. Besides, these effects also could help to explain the lowest values of S BET and pore volume found for the CN–FC sample. In this support, the content of Fe was maintained in equal proportion after the oxidative treatment with citric acid. Therefore, in this case, the lower surface area observed could be produced by a lack of opening at the tips, as well as a change in the intrinsic morphology of carbon nanotubes. On the other hand, it must be noted that the textural characteristics of CN–FCNF and [CN–FCNF]–H2700 supports do not significantly differ. This fact would indicate that thermal treatment with H2 at 700°C over supports previously oxidized could not have a significant effect both over the surface area and pore volume. However, in the case of [CN]–H2700 sample, the treatment with H2 produces a slight decrease in S BET and pore volume with respect to CN support, as it was observed from Table 2. This behavior can be explained by considering that the H2 thermal treatment of the support could gasify the carbon producing CH4 [6], and this process could be catalyzed by metal nanoparticles [72], such as Fe present in the support. Table 2 also shows the values of isoelectric points (IP) of the different supports which allow to reveal their acid or basic characteristics. It is observed that the support treated with nitric acid has an IP value lower than the one showed by the untreated support. On the other hand, the IP value of the support treated with citric acid increases. Thus, the treatment of carbon nanotubes with strong oxidant agents (nitric acid) produces a higher acidity of the support, while the treatment with weak oxidant agents (citric acid) becomes more basic. In the case of the support treated with successive aqueous solutions of HCl, HNO3, and HF, the isoelectric point does not practically change with respect to the untreated support, this effect indicating a slight change in the distribution of the different surface oxygenated groups more than in the acidity of the support. On the other hand, the supports previously treated with H2 showed a significant increase in the isoelectric point. This fact could be attributed to the removal of acid oxygenated groups from the support and a consequent increase in basicity due to defects in the structure and/or higher exposure of the π-sites capable of acting as electron donors [28]. Additionally, Fig. 1 shows the amounts of acid or basic solution added as a pH function for the different supports after the isoelectric point has been determined. By examining these curves, it can be observed that all the materials show an amphoteric behavior. However, it must be noted that for all the supports, there is a range where the adsorption of anions or cations is not very significant (pH: 4–9). Hence, the PtCl 6 - 2 adsorption could become significant at pH lower than 4 for all the supports in spite of having different isoelectric points. Other evidence of the chemical modification of the support with the different treatments was observed from TPD results, which was used to characterize the surface functional groups of the different supports. Fig. 2 shows the TPD profiles for the different carbon nanotubes. It is known that the oxidation treatments of carbon lead to the formation of different surface acid groups, mainly carboxylic, anhydride, lactone, phenol, and carbonyl groups [73,74]. Carboxylic and anhydride groups are considered as strong acid ones, while lactone, phenol, and carbonyl groups show weaker acid properties [75]. Moreover, it has been reported that the stronger acid groups lead to CO2-desorption at low temperatures (between 200 and 500°C) during TPD experiments, in contrast with weaker acid sites which lead to CO-desorption at higher temperatures (over 500°C) [6]. In Fig. 2, the amounts of desorbed CO and CO2 are shown as a function of temperature for carbon nanotubes without any treatment compared with the other functionalized supports. It can be observed that the original carbon nanotubes show only a low amount of weak acid groups. Besides, it is worth noting that the supports [CN]–H2700 and [CN–FCNF]–H2700 did not desorb functional groups as it was expected. On the contrary, TPD profiles of nitric acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CN–FN support) show that the oxidative treatment produces the development of important amounts of strong and weak acid groups. For the CN–FCNF support, the functional groups were developed in a lower proportion. This treatment produced the formation of few strong acid groups but an important formation of weak acid groups. On the other hand, the functionalization treatment with citric acid (weak oxidative agent) produces acid sites at a defined temperature of about 400°C. In conclusion, from these results, it can be stand out that the oxidative treatment with nitric acid produces a significant amount of different oxygenated groups and a high oxidation of the carbon nanotubes surface, while the treatment with citric acid mainly produces the development of acid groups of different nature to those observed with inorganic acids. The relative amounts of oxygen-containing surface groups were obtained by XPS. The O/C atomic ratio corresponding to different samples was calculated from XPS signals of C1s and O1s, which were normalized with the corresponding sensitivity factors and deconvoluted taking into account the presence of different species (e.g., –C–C, –C–H, –C–O, –C–O, –COOH) with very near binding energies. Besides, in order to interpret and to fit correctly the contribution of the chemical changes introduced over the support by the oxidative treatments, the main peak of C centered at 284.6eV was deconvoluted into an asymmetric peak (such as it was described in the literature for graphite materials [76–78]), and the presence of a π–π* shake-up feature also was taken into account (see as example Fig. 3 A). It must be noted that unfortunately, this broadening appears on same side as usual chemically shifted peaks (i.e., where C–O species are shifted toward high binding energy that correspond to graphitic carbon one) [79] and so, due to the peculiarity of the system, an ambiguous spectral deconvolution could result. In this sense, the literature shows discrepancies in XPS results regarding peak positions, full-width–half-max (FWHM) values and percentages of different species when the asymmetry of graphitic carbon and the O/C stoichiometry has not been respected (i.e., if the peaks related to carbon atoms bound to oxygen do not respect their intensities determined from the O1s spectra) [80]. In this work, the deconvolution and the peak assignations were made in agreement with the XPS results found by Estrade-Szwarckopf [79]. Fig. 3B and C shows the characteristic deconvolution of C1s and O1s spectra of carbon nanotubes. The O/C atomic ratios for different catalysts are listed in Table 3 . In agreement with TPD results, these values increased in those catalysts supported over functionalized carbon nanotubes (Pt/CN–FC, Pt/CN–FN and Pt/CN–FCNF) with respect to the catalyst supported over nanotubes without any oxidative treatment (Pt/CN), indicating the presence of a higher amount of surface oxygenated groups in the support after the oxidative treatments. It must be noted that the amounts of atomic oxygen measured by XPS are in agreement with those reported by Solhy et al. [29]. On the other hand, it was observed that the O/C atomic ratio values decreased in those supports which were thermally treated with H2 ([CN]–H2700 and [CN–FCNF]–H2700) in comparison with the corresponding supports without reduction treatment at high temperature. In these cases, the O/C atomic ratio values were even much lower than the corresponding to CN support, this indicating a significant reduction in the concentration of functional groups. These results agree with TPD ones, which display practically no desorption of functional groups in supports with H2 treatment at 700°C."
10,Citral hydrogenation,"3.2 Citral hydrogenation Fig. 4 shows the scheme of the citral hydrogenation reaction. The hydrogenation of citral may proceed via different reaction pathways since this process is a parallel and consecutive reduction of different functional groups present in the same starting substrate, i.e., CC and CO bonds. Citral is an unsaturated α,β aldehyde, but it has an additional one isolated CC bond. It also exists as cis and trans isomers and it can also be cyclized. The selective 1,2-addition of H2 (hydrogenation of CO group) gives unsaturated alcohol (UA). The addition of H2 to remaining CC bonds gives different saturated aldehydes, and the consecutive hydrogenation of the CO and CC bonds gives saturated alcohols. It must be indicated that this reaction scheme can be further completed by considering side reactions such as cyclization, decarbonylation, isomerization, and hydrogenolysis ones leading to different by-product formation. In general, the nature of the solvent and the presence of acid/basic sites on the catalytic surface favor the formation of these secondary products [4,51]. So, in this work, the hydrogenation was performed in 2-propanol (a hindered alcohol) in order to avoid by-product formation from side reactions of the solvent [8,43,81]. With respect to the catalyst preparation, two parameters have been considered. One of them is the content of Fe (added or contained as an impurity in the support), and the other one is the concentration of surface oxygenated groups on the support. Thus, on the one hand, different oxidative treatments were used with the object of purifying and developing significant amounts of surface oxygenated groups acting as nucleation centers for precursor anchoring, and on the other hand, different reductive treatments over the supports and catalysts were used with the object of reducing the content of oxygenated groups. The supports obtained from oxidative treatments (CN–FC; CN–FN; CN–FCNF) and the untreated support (CN) were used for the preparation of catalysts. Besides, three preparation methods of catalysts were used for each one of these supports, thus producing four catalytic series. The first one was carried out by simple impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of Pt precursor, while the second and third ones involved further high-temperature treatments, performed on the supports (with H2 700°C) or catalysts (with N2 at 700°C), respectively, such as Table 1 shows. Fig. 5 shows the selectivity values to different reaction products measured at three citral conversion levels (35%, 65%, and 95%) for all the catalysts corresponding to the Pt/CN–FCNF, Pt/CN–FN, Pt/CN–FC, and Pt/CN catalytic series. Besides, the performance of the catalysts prepared with the different carbon nanotubes treated and untreated (in terms of activity and selectivity at 95% citral conversion) is presented in Table 4 . From these results, it can be observed that the catalytic series prepared from carbon nanotubes purified and treated with strong oxidizing agents (Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN catalytic series) show a very low selectivity to UA with respect to the other series whose catalysts were prepared from the untreated support (CN) and also to those prepared over carbon nanotubes treated with citric acid (CN–FC). Besides, it must be noted that into each catalytic series prepared from the CN–FN and CN–FCNF supports, the catalysts Pt/[CN–FN]–H2700 and Pt/[CN–FCNF]–H2700 did not show a significant change in the selectivity values to UA with respect to Pt/CN–FN and Pt/CN–FCNF catalysts. At a first glance and taking into account that the supports in Pt/[CN–FN]–H2700 and Pt/[CN–FCNF]–H2700 catalysts have received a thermal treatment before impregnation in order to eliminate the surface oxygenated groups, these results would indicate a less important effect of the functional groups over the selectivity of the reaction. On the other hand, catalysts thermally treated after impregnation, [Pt/CN–FN]–N2700 and [Pt/CN–FCNF]–N2700, showed a better selectivity to UA with respect to the corresponding non-treated ones, although the selectivity values were not as high as the corresponding to Pt catalysts supported over CN and CN–FC. In these catalysts, the thermal treatment was carried out after impregnation, that is, in the presence of the metallic phase. So, the removal of surface oxygenated groups could be followed by a modification of the Pt particle sizes (sintering) if certain functional groups act as centers for precursor anchoring. Thus, the increase in the selectivity for these catalysts ([Pt/CN–FN]–N2700 and [Pt/CN–FCNF]–N2700) would indicate not only that the functional groups would not directly affect the selectivity of reaction by themselves, but also that the presence of them over the support would negatively and indirectly affect the selectivity to UA since they would help to disperse the metallic phase with a different distribution of the active sites in the catalysts. About these results, it must be noted that there is not a consensus in the bibliography about the effect of functional groups over the selectivity to UA, as it was mentioned in the introduction section. The results found in this work are in agreement with those authors who reported that the catalytic performance of metallic nanoparticles can be changed by modifying the surface chemistry of the support, e.g., the selectivity can be enhanced after removing the surface oxygen-containing groups from a carbon nanotubes support [24,29,30,34]. Table 4 also shows the results of citral hydrogenation activities for all catalysts, where the required times to reach a same citral conversion (95%) are indicated. By comparing the results of activities of the different catalysts series, it can be observed that Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN catalysts are markedly less active than Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FC ones. Besides, for each catalytic series prepared from the CN–FN and CN–FCNF supports, the activities of the catalysts with any thermal treatment (with H2 or N2) are higher than those corresponding to the catalysts prepared without any thermal treatment, while the opposite occurs with the catalysts prepared from the CN and CN–FC supports. These facts could be related to the competition of side reactions (decarbonylation, isomerization, cyclization, etc.) with the hydrogenation, leading to by-product formation mainly in catalysts with the presence of certain acidic/basic sites on their surface. Indeed, CN–FN and CN–FCNF supports are very acidic according to their isoelectric points, they have a great amount of functional groups (as observed from TPD experiments), and the catalysts prepared over them show the highest percentages of secondary products. On the contrary, those catalysts prepared from CN–FN and CN–FCNF supports with some thermal treatment (before or after impregnation step) have a lower content of functional groups, less competition of side reactions and better activity and selectivity to UA. On the other hand, in the cases of catalytic series prepared from CN and CN–FC supports, catalysts with thermal treatments show a slight decrease in the activities with respect to non-treated ones, but it must be noted that no catalyst of these series shows the formation of by-products. These facts could be attributed to the presence of Fe (as impurity of the starting carbon nanotubes), which could have influenced the dispersion of the metallic phase and/or poisoned the acid sites [82]. Besides, it must be noted that the selectivity values to UA of all the catalysts of the catalytic series prepared from the CN and CN–FC supports (see Fig. 5C and D) are quite similar and markedly higher than those corresponding to the other catalytic series. In these cases, the thermal treatment with N2 after impregnation allowed to obtain very high selectivity values to UA, the highest value being 96.2% at 95% citral conversion for the [Pt/CN]–N2700 catalyst. For both catalytic series, it must be noted that the supports have a certain Fe amount (2.78wt.%). Hence, the high selectivity to UA achieved for both series could be attributed to the presence of Fe since it is known that this element (in ionic state) can act as a promoter of the active metal [40,44–46,83–86]. However, two considerations must be taken into account: the Fe state (ionic or reduced) and its possible interaction with Pt in the catalyst. The Fe in the Pt/CN, [Pt/CN]–N2700, Pt/CN–FC, and [Pt/CN–FC]–N2700 catalysts is in ionic state while in the Pt/[CN]–H2700 and Pt/[CN–FC]–H2700 catalysts is assumed to be reduced due to the previous treatment of the supports with H2 at 700°C. In all the cases, the large particles of Fe located at the CN tips and inside the tube cavity must be dissolved in some proportion (as an ionic species) in the impregnation solution and co-impregnated with the Pt. So, in order to provide more insight into Fe effect present in the CN and CN–FC supports on the selectivity of the catalysts, additional experiments were carried out. From results of Fe analysis in the impregnation solution during the preparation of the catalysts, it can be concluded that a certain amount of Fe is dissolved in this solution in the case of the samples prepared with CN and CN–FC supports without previous H2 treatment. This fact would justify that the Fe could be deposited in the vicinity of Pt in Pt/CN, [Pt/CN]–N2700, Pt/CN–FC, and [Pt/CN–FC]–N2700 catalysts. In order to confirm this assumption, the catalytic behavior of PtFe bimetallic catalysts prepared by co-impregnation of Pt and Fe over CN–FCNF support was evaluated. The selectivity values (to UA at 95% citral conversion) were 15% and 81% for the PtFe/CN–FCNF catalysts with Fe loadings of 0.35 and 1.5wt.%, respectively. From these results, it was concluded that Fe could have a fundamental role as a promoter in Pt/CN, [Pt/CN]–N2700, Pt/CN–FC, and [Pt/CN–FC]–N2700 catalysts. With respect to the Pt/[CN]–H2700 and Pt/[CN–FC]–H2700 catalysts, in addition to the presence of Fe, it is probable that other effects should be considered to explain the high selectivity values found for these catalysts. Finally, with respect to the thermal treatment with N2 carried out on the metallic catalysts after impregnation, the time (12h) used was not casual. In fact, experiences were carried out with Pt/CN catalysts to find an optimum time period. Fig. 6 shows the results of the citral conversion to all products for the Pt/CN and Pt/CN–N2700 catalyst series as a function of time reaction for different N2 exposure times. It can be observed that the catalytic activity is affected by the time of exposure with N2 during the thermal treatment. So, when this treatment time increases, the total citral hydrogenation rate decreases. Fig. 7 shows the selectivity values to unsaturated alcohols measured at 95% citral conversion for these catalysts as a function of the exposure time with N2. It can be observed that the higher the time used, the higher the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols, and the curve shows a plateau at high time of N2 thermal exposure. Hence, it was selected a time of exposure with N2 of 12h for the thermal treatment as a good choice between activity and selectivity. From the above-mentioned results related to the activity and selectivity to UA in the citral hydrogenation, it was concluded that the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl group and the inhibition of the hydrogenation of the CC bonds of citral would require a given surface structure of the reaction sites [64]. Besides, the metallic phases and probably the density of the reaction sites for the hydrogenation of the CO and CC bonds in catalysts of the different catalytic series seem to be very different according to the support and preparation method. In this sense, the presence of Fe as a promoter would markedly increase the selectivity to UA, this effect having a very important role. Besides, for catalysts prepared on CN–FN and CN–FCNF supports, it was found an inverse relationship between activity/selectivity and the presence of surface oxygenated groups, probably due to that these groups on the one hand would help to disperse the metallic phase with a distribution of the sites unsuitable for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group and on the other hand would be promoting undesirable reactions like isomerization, decarbonylation, and cyclization. On the contrary, the thermal treatment with N2 after impregnation produces the removal of functional groups, followed by the sintering of metallic phase, and this modification of Pt particle sizes would affect positively the selectivity to UA. In fact, the selectivity to UA (at 95% citral conversion) defined as the ratio between the amount of UA and the amounts of all products minus the compounds produced by undesirables reactions, increases from about 17% to 33% when catalysts supported on functionalized carbon nanotubes from inorganic acids with similar samples but with the N2 treatment are compared. So, it was concluded that both the presence of Fe and the Pt dispersion (in a minor proportion) have a role over the selectivity to UA in the citral hydrogenation."
11,Catalyst characterization,"3.3 Catalyst characterization Further insights about the nature of the support and the reducibility of the supported platinum catalysts can be understood from TPR results. Fig. 8 shows the TPR profiles obtained for the CN, CN–FC, CN–FCNF, CN–FN, [CN]–H2700, and [CN–FCNF]–H2700 supports and the corresponding to Pt catalysts supported on them. Besides, for the sake of comparison and in order to obtain information about the degree of interaction between Fe (added or contained in the support) and Pt, the TPR profiles of PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst and the CN–FCNF support with two loadings of Fe (Fe(0.35wt.%)/CN–FCNF and Fe(1.5 wt.%)/CN–FCNF) samples are also included. It can be observed in Fig. 8A and B that the CN, CN–FCNF, and Fe/CN–FCNF samples display only one H2 consumption zone at temperatures higher than 400°C, which is coincident not only with the zone of CO-desorption in TPD experiments as it can be observed in Fig. 2, but also with the Fe reduction zone. It must be noted that the profiles of the Fe(0.35wt.%)/CN–FCNF and Fe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF samples are very similar. More specifically, the TPR profiles for the Fe/CN–FCNF supports show a broad peak centered at 510°C, which presents a shoulder at about 650°C. The reduction temperature of this shoulder is coincident with the maximum of the broad peak shown in the TPR profile of CN–FCNF support. Since the last support has a low amount of Fe, this H2 consumption peak would be mainly related to the decomposition of functional groups of the support producing the CO-desorption which create unsaturated reactive surface sites able to interact with hydrogen at high temperatures [31,72,83,87]. Besides, it must be noted that the TPR profiles of CN and Fe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF supports are very similar since both supports have a high Fe content and an important concentration of weaker acid groups (as it was observed from TPD results). In these cases, the peak at 510°C was assigned to the reduction of ionic Fe, being within the temperature range reported for the reduction of iron supported on different carbon materials [16,17,88]. On the other hand, Fig. 8A and B also shows the TPR profiles for the [CN]–H2700 and [CN–FCNF]–H2700 supports. The H2 consumption of these samples was practically negligible, as was expected from TPD results, indicating practically the absence of functional groups. Moreover, it must be taken into account that the ionic Fe present in the CN support would be completely reduced due to the previous thermal treatment with H2, thus also contributing to the negligible H2 consumption observed in the corresponding TPR profile. Fig. 8A and B also shows the TPR profiles of Pt catalyst prepared over CN and CN–FCNF supports: Pt/CN, Pt/[CN]–H2700, Pt/CN–FCNF, PtFe(1.5wt%)/CN–FCNF. Taking into account the TPR profiles of the supports and the above-mentioned comments, it can be inferred some important conclusions with respect to the TPR profiles of catalysts. First, all the catalysts show a reduction peak with a maximum at about 200°C that would correspond to the reduction of the deposited Pt precursor complex, as it was found in the literature for TPR of Pt catalysts supported on carbonaceous materials with different degree of surface oxidation [64,83,87,88]. Besides, the TPR profiles of Pt catalysts prepared over CN and CN–FCNF supports show additional peaks or H2 consumption zones at temperatures higher than 250°C, which can be explained in the following way: (a) The Pt/CN–FCNF catalyst displays two additional peaks: a small shoulder between 275 and 400°C and another peak at higher temperature (approximately 470°C). The shoulder could be due to a probable interaction of H2 with the reactive sites created after CO2-desorption at low temperatures and subsequent catalytic reduction by platinum [72]. In fact, the TPR profile of CN–FCNF support does not show a H2 consumption beneath 400°C, although it was observed a small desorption of strong acid groups from TPD results. Hence, this effect would be indicating that the presence of reduced Pt is necessary for the H2 dissociation into atomic hydrogen and subsequent reaction with those sites created after CO2-desorption, thus producing the shoulder. On the contrary, the other peak at higher temperature is observed in the TPR profile of CN–FCNF support. However, this peak in the support appears at higher temperatures than in the catalysts. This effect could also indicate that there is a catalytic effect of Pt [72] on the decomposition of these weaker functional groups which develop new unsaturated reactive surface sites that able to consume hydrogen. (b) The TPR profile of PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst displays one additional broad peak of H2 consumption at about 510°C and a intermediate zone of reduction between the Pt reduction peak and the peak observed at high temperature. The maximum of the peak at high temperature (at about 510°C) is coincident with the maximum of Fe reduction peak in Fe/CN/FCNF samples [16,88]. The intermediate reduction zone could be due not only to a co-reduction of Pt with a fraction of Fe, but also the reduction of reactive sites produced by the decomposition of functional groups of support. Hence, an important fraction of Fe could remain as ionic species on the support at the reduction temperature of the catalyst (350°C) before reaction. (c) In the case of Pt/CN catalyst, the TPR profile shows a broad zone of reduction between 275 and 600°C. Similarly to the PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst, this reduction zone could be explained considering the decomposition of weak functional groups present in CN support (see TPD results) and a fraction of co-reduced PtFe. In this case, it seems that a lower fraction of Fe ionic species stabilized on the support with respect to PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst exists. This effect could be also revealing the existence of different metallic species and the presence of a higher amount of Fe species in the vicinity of Pt for the Pt/CN catalyst with respect to PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst. (d) The TPR profile of Pt/[CN]–H2700 does not show a significant H2 consumption between 275 and 600°C. Since that this catalyst was prepared over the CN support which was previously treated with hydrogen at high temperature producing both the desorption of functional groups and the total Fe reduction over this support, this results would be indicating that the Fe would be practically reduced after impregnation with Pt. Besides, in relation to the absence of functional groups and ionic Fe, it must be noted that the peak corresponding to Pt reduction surprisingly displayed a lower area of H2 consumption than that corresponding to Pt/CN catalyst. Taking into account that all the catalysts have the same content of Pt, the difference in the H2 consumption could be due to a different Pt reducibility. With respect to those catalysts prepared over CN–FC and CN–FN supports, their profiles show the characteristic peak corresponding to the reduction of Pt precursor at about 200°C and other peaks at higher temperatures (see Fig. 8C and D). The TPR profiles of CN–FC and CN–FN supports show a zone with a low H2 consumption at 200–500°C and a defined broad peak at higher temperatures (>500°C). These profiles are in agreement with TPD results, which show an important desorption of functional groups at low, intermediate and high temperatures (see Fig. 2). Thus, the total H2 consumption of these supports would correspond to the interaction of hydrogen with the reactive sites created by the desorption of functional groups of different acidity degree and also to the presence of Fe in the case of the CN–FC support. Besides, the peaks at high temperature for Pt/CN–FC and Pt/CN–FN catalysts appear at lower temperatures in the corresponding TPR profiles than in the supports ones, thus indicating that the Pt could produce a catalytic effect on the decomposition of functional groups as it was above mentioned for catalysts supported on CN and CN–FCNF supports. Finally, from the observation of the all TPR profiles of the catalysts, it is interesting to point out that: (i) the peak corresponding to Pt reduction that appears at about 200°C for all catalysts is narrower in the catalysts supported over CN and CN–FC nanotubes than those supported on CN–FCNF and CN–FN supports, (ii) all the profiles of catalysts also show a desorption zone at temperatures higher than 600°C. The broader peaks corresponding to reduction of Pt over CN–FCNF and CN–FN supports could be due to the presence of different Pt species, but it must be also taken into account the measurement of the consumed H2 amount corresponding to the peaks. For Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN catalysts, the H2 consumption is much higher than that theoretically expected (about 154 μ mol g cat - 1 for the reduction of the all platinum from Pt(IV) to Pt(0) when the Pt content is 5wt.%), which could be attributed to the hydrogen spillover from reduced Pt0 onto carbon nanotubes [15,83,89,90]. Indeed, platinum particles can act as adsorption sites for hydrogen which once dissociated, is spilt over the carbon nanotubes surface being retained over it or occupying the reactive sites formed upon the decomposition of surface oxygenated groups [31]. The broadening of the first reduction peak agrees with the results above explained about the participation of Pt as catalyst in the decomposition of these functional groups on the different supports which develop new unsaturated reactive surface sites that able to consume hydrogen. On the other hand, it must be indicated that the desorption zone at temperature higher than 600°C could be related to the desorption of the H2 retained on the carbon surface or to a partial carbon gasification process forming CH4 [31,72]. Since the last effect would be present at higher temperatures (⩾700°C) over the corresponding supports, these results indicate a catalytic effect of the Pt on the methane formation. In conclusion, the thermal treatment with H2 in TPR experiments of the catalysts produce several phenomena which evidence a complex effect of Pt on the surface of the support, such as reduction of the metallic phase, activation of molecular H2 on the metal to produce atomic hydrogen, spillover of hydrogen in the carbon nanotube surface and catalytic action of Pt on the reactive sites of the supports created by decomposition of functional groups. In this sense, the presence of different functional groups would lead to a different dispersion of the Pt precursor, and in consequence a different catalytic behavior, as it was observed from hydrogenation results. Besides, TPR experiments would allow to explain that the removal of functional groups would help to disperse the Pt with strong interaction of the particles with the support, since the electrical conductivity of nanotubes increases when the concentration of functional groups decreases [24,27], and so, an electron transfer from the support to Pt nanoparticles could be favored. Thus, the high selectivity to UA reached by the Pt/[CN]H2700 catalyst can be explained considering an increase in the electronic density of the metallic particles (caused by electron transfer from the nanotubes to them) which promotes the activation of CO group and inhibits CC bond coordination as it was suggested by other authors [24,30,51]. Besides, although the Fe interaction with Pt seems to be less probable according to TPR results, the influence of Fe in these catalysts should not be discarded. In order to corroborate the above-mentioned results about the effect of the metallic particle size and its distribution on different catalysts, TEM measurements were employed. Fig. 9 shows the TEM microphotographies together with the corresponding histograms of particle size distribution for different catalysts. The mean particle size was calculated from the histograms and the corresponding values are summarized in Table 5 . It can be observed from these results that the average diameters of Pt particles for Pt/CN, Pt/CN–FC, Pt/CN–FCNF, and Pt/CN–FN catalysts are very similar (about 2.2nm). However, from the histograms, it must be noted that the particle size distribution for these catalysts is quite different. The histograms of Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FC catalysts (Fig. 9A and C) show a narrower and more homogeneous distribution than Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN ones (Fig. 9E and G). Besides, the last catalysts seem to exhibit a bimodal distribution with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 6nm and with frequency percentages for particles with mean diameter of 1–2nm higher than 60%. These results indicate an important contribution of small particles to the total Pt area and in consequence a higher dispersion in Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN catalysts than Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FC ones. On the other hand, the Pt/[CN]–H2700 catalyst shows the most homogeneous and narrowest distribution with particles sizes strictly between 1 and 3nm (see Fig. 9I). This result would be indicating a high dispersion of Pt particles. Since this catalyst was prepared from a support previously reduced with H2, in agreement with the TPR results, the probable interaction of Pt particles with π sites over support would be favored when particles of small size are present in the catalyst. TEM measurements were also carried out in order to determinate the Fe effect over the metallic dispersion. From Fig. 9, it is worth noting the results found for the PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst. This catalyst shows a more homogeneous and narrower distribution of particle sizes than its parent Pt/CN–FCNF catalyst. Besides, it can be observed that the histogram of particle size distribution of PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst (Fig. 9J) is more similar to the ones corresponding to the Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FC catalysts. This important result would be indicating that in comparison with Pt/CN–FCNF catalyst, the addition of Fe produces a change in the distribution of the particles size. This change could be explained due to the poisoning of acid sites of the support by Fe species placed over the support inducing the deposition of Pt in different sites of adsorption than for the CN–FCNF support. In consequence, the above-mentioned effect would explain the higher selectivity found for this catalyst with respect to Pt/CN–FCNF one, since Fe would act as a promoter improving the selectivity to UA but also would inhibit the production of by-products, such as it was observed. In relation to the catalysts submitted to the thermal treatment with N2, TEM results show important conclusions. From Table 5, it was observed that there is an increase in the mean particles sizes for those catalysts treated with N2 at high temperature. However, it must be noted that these changes seem to be more pronounced in catalysts prepared over CN and CN–FC supports. In fact, from Table 4, it was observed that the average diameter significantly changed from 2.2 to 3.35 when Pt/CN catalyst was treated with N2 at high temperature. Considering that this change in the particle size is related to an important change in the selectivity to UA for the catalysts prepared with and without N2 treatment from CN support (from about 84 to 96%), this effect corroborates that the Pt dispersion has an important role on the selectivity to UA in the citral hydrogenation. In order to find more information about the surface characteristics of the metallic phase, XPS experiments were carried out on the different catalysts. Fig. 10 A–C shows the Pt 4f signals of the Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FN catalysts before the reduction treatment with H2 at 350°C and of the reduced Pt/CN–FN catalyst. Besides, Table 6 shows the binding energies of the Pt4f level, the percentages of different species of Pt, and the values of surface Pt/C and O/C atomic ratios for the catalysts prepared on the different supports before the reduction treatment. Table 7 shows the same XPS data but for the reduced catalysts. It must be noted that the deconvolution of Pt4f spectra was performed assuming an intensity ratio of Pt4f7/2 to Pt4f5/2 of 1:0.75, and a separation between the Pt4f doublet signals of 3.36eV [91,92]. Besides, in some cases, an additional peak close to 75eV, assigned to Al2p level of aluminum oxide impurities [72], was introduced in order to obtain good fittings. The curve of Al2p was obtained taking into account the intensity ratio of Al2s to Al2p of 1:1.14, which was found from XPS results of the support alone. From the deconvolution of the Pt4f XPS spectra of both dried samples without the reduction treatment (Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FN catalysts prepared on supports with low (CN) and high (CN–FN) degree of oxidation, respectively), which are shown in Fig. 10A and B, two doublets were obtained: one at low binding energy (at about 73eV for Pt 4f7/2 and 76.4eV for Pt 4f5/2), which can be assigned to Pt(II) species and a second one at higher binding energy (at about 75eV for Pt 4f7/2 and 78.4eV for Pt 4f5/2), which corresponds to Pt(IV) species [93]. It must be noted that the presence of Pt(II) species in these samples would evidence a partial reduction of PtCl 6 - 2 when interacting with the carbon surface. Besides, both samples show different profiles which indicate that a very different proportion of oxidized platinum species could exist according to the sample. In fact, Table 6 shows the percentages of different Pt species found before the reduction treatment for the catalysts prepared over the different supports indicating that Pt(II) species appear in all the dried samples, although in different proportion. It must be indicated that the total or partial reduction of oxidized species of Pt on different carbonaceous materials during the impregnation step has been found by different authors [6,7,28,72,87,94–96]. In general, the works reported that during impregnation with H2PtCl6, a redox process by which Pt(IV) is reduced to Pt(II) or Pt(0) species takes place probably due to the reductive properties of carbon. However, in this sense, the literature is scarce and contradictory about the effect of the surface oxygenated groups in the extent and efficiency of the phenomena of the reduction of ionic species of Pt. As already mentioned from XPS results shown in Table 6, the percentages of reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II) species for Pt/CN–FCNF, Pt/CN–FC, and Pt/CN–FN catalysts are very similar each other and much higher than the one corresponding to Pt/CN catalyst. A possible explanation for these results could be the following. It was observed from TPD results that carbon nanotubes without any functionalization treatment only desorbed a low amount of weak acid groups. In relation to this fact, the catalyst prepared over this support shows a moderate amount of Pt(II) species. Besides, according to TPD results, the CN–FCNF and CN–FN functionalized carbon nanotubes showed higher amounts of weak acid groups than CN support, and CN–FC support showed mainly the development of acidic sites with moderate strength. So, the higher degree of reduction of species of Pt(IV) found in CN–FCNF, CN–FN, and CN–FC supports could be directly related with the presence in these supports of a higher amount of acid groups with weak and/or moderate strength than that corresponding to CN support. On the other hand, although the presence of a high amount of strong acid groups in CN–FN support does not seem to affect this reduction phenomenon, these groups could serve as anchoring sites. In this sense, it was reported that –COOH groups would act as preferred sites for the reaction of ion exchange between Pt precursor and these groups [60] or to form Pt species binding to oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group [97]. So, taking into account that the reduction of platinum could occur not only from interaction or ionic adsorption with oxidized sites of the support but also that the strong acid groups could help to anchor Pt particles, the dispersion of the Pt could be favored over functionalized supports with strong oxidizing agents. This fact can be clearly deduced from the values of surface Pt/C atomic ratio shown in Table 6 for the different catalysts. Indeed, this ratio, considered as a measurement of the exposed platinum atoms, is higher in catalysts prepared over functionalized supports with inorganic acids (Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN). Thus, it seems that the amount and type of oxygen surface groups could be important for achieving both a high platinum dispersion and a different Pt precursor reducibility during the impregnation and drying steps. Table 6 also shows the percentages of Pt species found for the Pt/[CN]–H2700 and Pt/[CN–FN]–H2700 catalysts after the impregnation and drying steps. These samples also show reduction of Pt(IV), but in this case, both the appearance of Pt(II) and Pt(0) species are observed. It must be noted that the total percentage of reduction in these cases is lower than those corresponding to the catalysts prepared on functionalized supports, the reduction degree being more similar to that corresponding to Pt/CN catalyst. Since these catalysts show a small percentage of metallic Pt, it could be suggested that a different oxide-reduction mechanism occurs in these samples. It must be noted that the Pt/[CN]–H2700 and Pt/[CN–FN]–H2700 catalysts have been prepared on supports previously treated with H2, and their corresponding supports did not show desorption of surface oxygenated groups, as it was observed from TPD results. Besides, these supports show isoelectric point values higher than the ones corresponding to the other supports (see Table 2). Although in these cases the PtCl 6 - 2 adsorption could be favored by the higher isolectric point of H2-pretreated supports with respect to the pH of the impregnation solution [63], the absence of oxygenated functional groups in these supports leads to the idea of the existence of other anchoring sites for the platinum precursor. These sites could be basic π sites in the basal planes of the nanotubes, which are capable of acting as electron donors to form a coordination bond with the platinum precursor [28]. van Dam and van Bekkum [95] have proposed a model for describing the chemistry of the impregnation of H2PtCl6 on a carbon support, in which two types of ligand sites for the platinum were assumed: π-complex structures in the carbon basal planes and oxygen-containing functional groups. In this model, the carbon reduces the Pt(IV) to Pt(II), which it is then coordinatively bound by the carrier and simultaneously acidic groups are formed during the oxidation of the carbon by Pt(IV). In relation to this model, it must be taken into account that the desorption of oxygenated groups (from the treatment with H2 carried out on the support) could lead to the formation of nanoscaled ridges and cavities on CN surface [9,30] which could favor the adsorption and increase the immobilization of metal nanoparticles [98,99], but it also could lead to different unsaturated sites or defects [100,101] that can be re-oxidated by Pt(IV) as it was explained in the model proposed by van Dam and van Bekkum [95] or also by exposure with dissolved oxygen into the impregnation solution [87]. So, since a certain amount of oxygenated groups could be created during the impregnation step, the basic mechanism of adsorption of Pt anionic precursor in acid solution should not be discarded. Besides, it must be indicated that both mechanisms (via coordination reaction with exchange of ligands in the precursor Pt complex and the ion exchange or adsorption of anions in acid medium) could compete, prevailing one or another according to the amount and nature of oxygenated groups created in the support. Thus, the anchoring of Pt precursor over basic π sites of the support previously treated with H2 could become less important when a considerable re-oxidation of the support occurs during the impregnation step [28,95]. In addition, it must be noted that the CN–FN support would have a higher amount of unsaturated sites or defects created after the treatment with H2 with respect to the CN support, and this effect could produce a different oxidation of the support and Pt dispersion, as it was deduced from the corresponding values of O/C and Pt/C atomic ratios shown in Table 6. The fact that the oxygenated groups can be formed by the carbon oxidation during Pt(IV) reduction or also from an additional carbon oxidation produced by oxygen dissolved in the aqueous solution was observed by several authors [6,7,31,72,87], this carbon oxidation being more important in supports with a lower amount of oxygen surface groups. Although some groups of this chemical surface created during the impregnation step could have a limited thermal stability at temperatures at which the catalysts are reduced, the remaining groups also could promote a further distribution of Pt species changing the final platinum surface dispersion after the reduction treatment with H2 at 350°C. Table 7 shows the Pt/C ratios after the reduction treatment of the catalysts. The reduction treatment of the catalysts increases the amount of surface platinum species with respect to the ones without reduction. Thus, during reduction, a redispersion of platinum species seems to take place simultaneously with the decomposition of the less stable oxygen surface groups, which yields a higher Pt dispersion in Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN catalysts than those prepared over CN and CN–FC supports (see Table 7, Pt/C ratios). These results are in agreement with others reported previously [28,31,87]. This conclusion is very important because the final dispersion of the metallic phase can be related with the catalytic behavior. Pt/CN–FN and Pt/CN–FCNF catalysts showed a very low selectivity to unsaturated alcohols and a high selectivity to secondary products due to the presence of a high amount of oxygenated acid groups (present over support after the catalyst reduction) which also would help to disperse the metallic phase producing small Pt particles which would have geometrical planes not very suitable for the adsorption of carbonyl group [18,24,42], such as it was previously discussed. On the contrary, in the case of Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FC catalysts, they have a lower final dispersion. So, the higher selectivity to UA found with these catalysts could be explained taking into account a lower probability of CC bond activation compared with that of CO bond over larger particles [18,24,42,51,60] and mainly due to the presence of Fe which acts as a promoter of Pt creating Lewis adsorption sites for the oxygen atom of the carbonyl groups, thus also increasing the hydrogenation of this group. Table 7 also shows the values of Pt/C and O/C ratios for catalysts prepared from thermal treatment of the catalysts with N2. It must be noted that this thermal treatment had a different objective that the treatment of the pre-reduction with H2 of the support. The last treatment of the support was carried out in order to eliminate the surface oxygenated groups and to modify the mechanism of impregnation of Pt precursor; however, this treatment could give place to a re-oxidation of the support during the impregnation step and to an incomplete or selective desorption of oxygenated groups together with an increase of the dispersion during the subsequent reduction of the catalyst. On the other hand, the aim of the thermal treatment with N2 was to modify the concentration of remaining oxygenated groups after the reduction step and simultaneously to induce sintering. In this case, the increase in particle sizes during the treatment with N2 produces a decrease in the final dispersion as opposited to Pt/[support]–H2 catalysts (see Table 7, Pt/C ratios). Besides, for these catalysts, the O/C ratios are reduced to values lower than CN-support. It must be noted that from a thermodynamic point of view [28], it could be expected that the smaller platinum particles in the Pt/CN–FN and Pt/CN–FCNF catalysts would sinter more easily than the larger particles in Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FC samples; however, it was not observed an important change in these catalysts. Then, the results could be explained taking into account the degree of interaction reached by the particles with the support surface or with the oxygenated groups before treatment and the availability of basic π-sites. After reduced with H2, Pt/CN–FN and Pt/CN–FCNF catalysts showed a higher amount of oxygenated groups (see Table 7, O/C ratios) than the Pt/CN one, probably due to some more stable oxygenated groups (created during the impregnation step or during the genesis of these materials) remaining in these supports. These remaining oxygenated groups could affect the electron delocalization in the basic π-sites near them weakening their capability to act as anchoring centers [28] or could generate strong bonds with Pt species [60,97], in both cases hindering the sintering in greater proportion than the other supports. These results are in agreement with those found by TEM results. Besides, these results would help to explain more clearly the citral hydrogenation results observed for these catalysts. [Pt/CN–FN]–N2700 and [Pt/CN–FCNF]–N2700 catalysts improve their catalytic behavior, both in relation to the activity and selectivity to UA, with respect to the corresponding catalysts prepared over the supports without any treatment. However, the lower selectivity to UA found in these catalysts (about 30% at 95% citral conversion) with respect to [Pt/CN]–N2700 and [Pt/CN–FC]–N2700 catalysts (between 91% and 97% at 95% citral conversion) cannot be attributed only to a lack of the a preferential activation of carbonyl group. In these catalysts supported on nanotubes functionalized with inorganic acid, the formation of by-products is not totally suppressed, evidencing the presence of remaining acid sites over the supports. On the other hand, the high selectivity found to UA in [Pt/CN]–N2700 and [Pt/CN–FC]–N2700 catalysts could be related with a more favorable sintering during the thermal treatment and consequently with an increase in the particle size, but other effects must be considered: (a) the important role of Fe as a promoter, and (b) the high Pt reduction degree in the final catalysts. With respect to the reducibility degree of supported platinum catalysts, the signals of Pt 4f7/2 at about 71.6–71.7eV and Pt 4f5/2 at about 75.0–75.1eV, observed in all reduced Pt catalysts as the major fraction, were assigned to a metallic state of Pt. However, as it can be observed in Fig. 10C for the Pt/CN–FN catalyst, there is an asymmetry in the Pt4f level at about 78eV. Pt/CN–FN catalyst was selected as example, but this asymmetry was observed in all the reduced catalysts. This fact would be indicating a small concentration of ionic species of Pt(II) or Pt(IV) which are masked by the much larger signal from metallic Pt. The presence of these ionic species of Pt in the final reduced catalysts is not surprising because the results in this work indicate that Pt could form stable species with the surface oxygenated groups (or with the support) which could remain unreduced at the temperature used for obtaining the final catalyst. These results are in agreement with those in the literature, where many authors have reported the presence of Pt oxide species in a Pt(0):P(ox) ratio of about 75:25 in catalysts prepared over carbon nanotubes [97,102–106]. From results of percentages of reduced Pt for the different catalysts shown in Table 7, it seems that the higher the dispersion, the lower the percentage of reduction. Indeed, it was above mentioned that the highest percentage of reduced Pt was found for the [Pt/CN]–N2700 catalyst, while Pt/CN–FN, Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/[CN]–H2700 catalysts show the lowest values of Pt reduction. These facts seem to be related with a stronger interaction of Pt with surface oxygenated groups in catalysts supported over acid materials in contrast with Pt/[CN]–H2700 catalyst, which would show an important interaction of Pt with the support. Finally, in order to corroborate dispersion data and the results above mentioned about the effect of Fe as a promoter, present or added to the catalysts, test reactions (cyclohexane dehydrogenation –CHD– and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis –CPH–) of metallic phase were employed. Table 8 shows the results corresponding to initial reaction rates R CH 0 and activation energies (E aCH) measured in the CH dehydrogenation and initial reaction rates R CP 0 of CP hydrogenolysis. The CHD is a structure-insensitive reaction [107], which is carried out on the surface active atoms of the catalyst. Hence, the reaction is an indirect measurement of exposed surface Pt atoms. In this reaction, the activation energy can be modified if the nature of the metallic site is changed by some effect, such as, the presence of a second metal or the different properties of the support (electronic modification in the metal–metal or metal–support interaction). It can be observed from results in Table 8 that the initial reaction rate in CHD for catalysts prepared over acidic supports (Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN) is higher than the corresponding to Pt/CN catalyst. Since the dehydrogenation activity should increase with the exposed metal fraction, the results are in agreement with the higher dispersion found by TEM and XPS results for Pt/CN–FN and Pt/CN–FCNF catalysts. Besides, the results of the CHD show that the thermal treatment with N2 of the different catalysts (for example, [Pt/CN–FCNF]–N2700, [Pt/CN–FN]–N2700 and [Pt/CN]–N2700) leads to a decrease in the initial reaction rate (about 35–55%). This fact shows a change toward lower dispersions or a modification of the distribution of particles toward higher sizes, this effect being more pronounced for Pt/CN catalysts. In the case of catalysts whose supports have been treated with H2 (for example, Pt/[CN–FCNF]–H2700 and Pt/[CN]–H2700), the results show that the indirect measurement of surface Pt atoms by CHD indicates a higher dispersion with respect to those corresponding to catalysts without H2 treated supports, in agreement with TEM and XPS results too. With respect to the effect of Fe, it can be observed from Table 8 that the initial reaction rate in CHD for PtFe bimetallic catalysts prepared over CN–FCNF support is not modified in an important degree when the Fe content increases. In this case, the initial reaction rate value for bimetallic catalyst with 1.5wt.% Fe only decreases about 25% with respect to monometallic one (Pt/CN–FCNF catalyst). In general, it is also observed from test reaction results that the activation energies values of the different catalysts ranged between 40 and 48kcalmol−1. However, in particular, it must be observed that the activation energies of CH dehydrogenation for bimetallic catalysts prepared on CN–FCNF support are higher than the corresponding to the monometallic one, and these energies slightly increase when increasing Fe amounts are added to the Pt. In this sense, it should be pointed out that any change in the CH dehydrogenation rate higher than one order of magnitude and a significant modification of the activation energy, indicate that an important electronic interaction exists between both metals. So, it can be inferred that the low modification of both the activation energy and the initial activity as the Fe content increases, would indicate a low electronic modification of Pt by Fe. On the other hand, the CP hydrogenolysis is a structure-sensitive reaction [108], which is carried out on ensembles of a certain number of active atoms. This means that the reaction rate is decreased when the addition of a second metal to the active metal can break the metallic ensembles necessaries to carry out the hydrogenolysis reaction. Besides, it must be taken into account that the lower dispersion of the metallic phase, the lower the concentration of metallic ensembles necessary for the reaction to occur. It was observed from results in Table 8 a lower CPH reaction rate in catalysts with N2 thermal treatment with respect to those without treatment. Besides, it must be noted that the Pt/CN and [Pt/CN]–N2700 catalysts also show a lower CPH reaction rate with respect to catalysts prepared from acidic supports (Pt/CN–FCNF and Pt/CN–FN), since the last ones have higher dispersions. Table 8 also shows that the addition of Fe to Pt decrease the reaction rate in bimetallic catalysts with respect to the monometallic one (Pt/CN–FCNF). This fact evidences a geometric effect probably due to the deposition of Fe in the vicinity of Pt (blocking and/or dilution effects). It must be noted that the CPH initial reaction rate value reached for the PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst is very similar to the corresponding to Pt/CN one. Besides, in agreement with TEM results, this catalyst shows a similar dispersion to the corresponding to the Pt/CN catalyst. Moreover, PtFe(1.5wt.%)/CN–FCNF catalyst shows a catalytic behavior similar to Pt/CN and Pt/CN–FC catalysts in the citral hydrogenation. Summarizing, results from test reactions indicate that the structure of metallic phase is modified by the nature of the support and the presence of Fe as a promoter, in agreement with those results obtained from other characterization techniques. In this sense, not only the surface functionalization method carried out on the support but also the additional thermal treatments carried out in the preparation method of the catalysts, are important for the resulting catalyst behavior. Thus, the catalytic activity for citral hydrogenation can be correlated with the presence of promoters, the dispersion, the reducibility, and the interaction degree of the metallic phase with the support that takes place in the different catalysts. The strong oxidizing treatments of carbon nanotubes increase the surface oxygenated groups and remove the Fe present in the support as an impurity, while the thermal treatments remove the surface oxygenated groups and improve the interaction of the Pt nanoparticles with the support. Thus, a high selectivity to UA was obtained when a proper equilibrium of the above-mentioned effects (the size and the interaction with the support of the Pt particles, and the presence of Fe as a promoter) is reached in the final catalyst."
12,Conclusions,"We investigated the effect of surface oxygenated groups and Fe (contained in the carbon nanotubes or added to them) on catalytic performance in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of citral. The results obtained in this study can be summarized as follows: • The functionalization treatments of carbon nanotubes develop different types of oxygenated groups on the support surface according to the method used and decrease significantly the impurities of the support. However, specifically only the treatments that use strong inorganic acids reduce significantly the Fe present in the original support. • The thermal treatment with H2 carried out on the functionalized and non-functionalized supports eliminates the oxygenated groups and reduces the ionic Fe (to metallic Fe) present in the support. • The oxygen surface groups on the support have a high influence during the catalyst preparation step. During the impregnation step, a partial reduction of Pt(IV) occurs in supports with different concentration of surface oxygenated groups. The partial reduction of Pt in functionalized supports seems to be directly related with the presence of acid groups with weak and/or moderate strength. Besides, strong acid groups could act as anchoring sites forming species binding to oxygen atoms. On the other hand, for catalysts prepared on supports previously treated with H2, a different reduction mechanism of Pt precursor (that arises from the availability of π basic sites) is proposed, which seems to compete with the classic mechanism of ion exchange. Thus, the interaction between the carbon support and an acidic aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 causes an increase in the oxygen content of the support. This carbon oxidation arises from a redox reaction both with the metal precursor and with oxygen dissolved in the aqueous solution. The oxidation is relatively more important in supports with a low amount of oxygenated groups and/or a high content of unsaturated sites. • Platinum dispersion in the final catalysts strongly depends on the nature and amount of oxygenated groups and on the availability of π basic sites present in the support after impregnation and drying step. • In spite of the appropriate temperature of reduction of all catalysts at 350°C in H2, an important fraction of Pt (22–39%) remains as ionic species. The higher the dispersion the lower the percentage of reduction since the very dispersed metallic particles could form stable species with the support or with the surface oxygenated groups. • Catalyst supported on non-functionalized and citric acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes display very high activities and selectivities to UA due to the main role of Fe as a promoter of the Pt. Besides, other function of the Fe is to poison acid sites, thus inhibiting undesirable reactions and favoring to UA, too. In these catalysts, the further treatment with N2 at 700°C produces not only the removal of functional groups, but also a sintering of the metallic phase, thus leading very high selectivities to UA. The best catalytic performance was obtained in the case of the Pt/[CN]–N2700 catalyst, which reached a selectivity value to UA of 96.2%. • Catalysts supported on nanotubes functionalized with strong inorganic acids and without any treatment show very low activities and selectivities to UA, and high selectivities to undesirable products due to both the absence of Fe as a promoter and the high presence of acidic sites on their surface which catalyze undesirable reactions and promote the increase of Pt dispersion. Besides, when these catalysts are treated with N2 at 700°C, the activity increases in an important way although they show less important effects over the selectivity to UA."
