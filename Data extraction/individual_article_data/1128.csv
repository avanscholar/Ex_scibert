0,Introduction,"In recent years, the demand for chemicals and fuels has greatly boomed. However, their production is limited by the crude oil reserves, and even by the ever stricter environmental regulations. Therefore, the sustainable and environmentally-friendly production of chemicals and fuels has obtained great attentions [1,2]. In this context, to pave the way for efficient production of chemicals and fuels from syngas (the mixture of CO and H2) is an amazing route to this goal. On the one hand, syngas can be cost-effectively produced from diverse abundant carbon sources (such as renewable biomass, natural gas, coal and even municipal solid waste); on the other hand, syngas can be versatilely used as basic blocks to produce highly value-added fuels and commodity chemicals with the aid of heterogeneous catalysts [3–5]. Undoubtedly, persevering researches and efforts should be devoted to syngas conversion to achieve the efficient and environment-benign utilization of non-oil resources to produce fuels and chemicals. Ethylene glycol (EG) is a commodity chemical with wide applications in industry, such as antifreeze, lubricant, solvent, and the manufacture of polyester fibers, pharmaceuticals, perfumes, and emulsion paints. In 2018, the global EG consumption was 34.13 million tons, of which 18 million tons were consumed in Asia, and the supply was tight. It is estimated that by 2023, the global EG consumption will reach 37 million tons, of which about 32 million tons will be used for polyester. Its universal production in industry is mainly based on the hydrolysis of oil-derived ethylene oxide [6,7]. In principle, EG can also be synthesized from syngas through Pd-catalyzed coupling of CO with methyl nitrate to dimethyl oxalate (DMO) and subsequent gas-phase catalytic hydrogenation of DMO to EG (called CTEG, Scheme S1) [8,9]. Whereas the CTEG commercialization is on the way now in China, this method is still struggling with the severe lack of a well-qualified catalyst for the gas-phase hydrogenation of DMO to EG (DMO-to-EG). The copper (Cu) based catalysts have been widely employed to hydrogenate carbonyl compounds to the corresponding alcohols as Cu species can activate carbonyl group (C=O) and hydrogen molecule but are inactive for breaking carbon–carbon bond [5,10–13]. For the DMO-to-EG process, the oxides supported nano-Cu catalysts have been intensively studied, and silica (SiO2) is identified as an ideal support, because of its weak acidic and basic properties that can diminish the etherification of EG (on acid sites) and Guerbet reaction (to form C3-C4 diols on basic sites) [12,14–16]. However, there are inherent problems with the Cu/SiO2 such as easy sintering deactivation [17–27], narrow high-EG-selectivity temperature window [28,29], and draining away of SiO2 by formation of tetramethoxysilane [24,30]. To improve the stability of Cu/SiO2 catalyst, numerous endeavors have been made including optimization of the preparation methods (such as ammonia evaporation, urea hydrolysis, and sol–gel methods) [14,19,20], modification by additives and supports (such as boron, nickel, silver, gold, ZrO2 and MgO-Al2O3) [21–26], and structure and surface tailoring of SiO2 (such as hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) and copper-phyllosilicate core-sheath nanoreactor) [5,27]. What’s to be particularly noted, moreover, is that the EG formation is subjected to a dilemma, squeezed by the methyl glycolate (MG) formation from the preliminary hydrogenation of DMO below 190 °C and favorable over-hydrogenation of EG to ethanol (EtOH) above 210 °C; that is to say, the EG selectivity of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst can remain at a high level (i.e., >90%) in a very narrow temperature window of only 20 °C [28,29]. Furthermore, the DMO-to-EG process is strongly exothermic whereas the Cu/SiO2 catalyst has poor heat transfer, normally generating hotspots in catalyst bed and further expediting these above problems [18,24]. Hence, rendering a novel SiO2-free catalyst, with intensified thermal conductivity, high catalytic activity, prolonged lifespan, and particularly a wide temperature window with high EG selectivity, has increased tremendous interests but represents a challenging endeavor. Specifically, once the catalyst is endowed with high heat transfer and wide temperature window for the DMO-to-EG process, the cost-efficient and large-capacity adiabatic fixed bed reactor may be adopted to replace the tubular reactor. In the commercial process, the tubular reactor has limited single-unit capacity, but has to be constrainedly employed, in order to effectively dissipate the reaction heat and get the Cu/SiO2 catalyst running smoothly. The resemblance demonstrated from the ample catalysts able to effectively activate both carbon dioxide (CO2) and DMO offers an interesting clue for seeking the qualified catalytic materials. What should be first noted is that the Cu-based catalysts are not only commonly applied in DMO hydrogenation, but also in CO2 hydrogenation [31–33]; for instance, the Cu/SiO2 catalysts are highly efficient to activate the inert C=O in CO2 to produce methanol [31]. Moreover, the Mo2C catalyst is employed for the reverse water–gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) due to its excellent ability to activate C=O in CO2, and this catalyst has also been proven to be extremely active for DMO hydrogenation [34,35]. Thus, we analogize that the high efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation may also be capable of converting DMO to EG. Very recently, we discovered an interesting indium-nickel-carbon nano-intermetallic of InNi3C0.5 that is particularly active, selective and stable for the reverse water–gas shift reaction [36]. Based on above analogy, we hypothesize that it would make a great progress if the InNi3C0.5 nano-intermetallic could replace the conventional Cu-based catalysts to hydrogenate DMO to EG efficiently. Another critical issue for tailoring the desired DMO-to-EG catalysts is to utilize a neutral support with high thermal conductivity. For this purpose, the monolithic Ni-foam has been considered to be a new promising catalyst support, owing to its neutral property, outstanding thermal conductivity and mass-transfer ability, high permeability, and high mechanical robustness [37–42]. For example, a monolithic PdNi/Ni-foam catalyst has been successfully fabricated for the strongly exothermic and high-throughput coalbed methane deoxygenation reaction, and the above features of Ni-foam benefit the full play to catalyst performance [37]. Moreover, a Ni-foam structured nanoporous Ni3P catalyst delivers an almost complete DMO conversion with a high MG selectivity of 97% (or > 99.8% selectivity to MG plus EG) as well as less than 0.2% selectivity to other byproducts and is stable for at least 1000 h at 230 °C [38]. Such less byproducts of ethers (e.g., 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol) and C3-C4 diols (e.g., propanediol and butanediol) that are favorably formed on the acid and base sites are profited from the neutral feature of Ni-foam. Therefore, we believe that Ni-foam is a prospective support for DMO hydrogenation to EG process. In this work, a monolithic catalyst of Ni-foam structured InNi3C0.5 nano-intermetallic is presented for the gas-phase DMO-to-EG process. Over this InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst, the EG selectivity above 90% can be obtained in a wide window of industry-relative reaction temperature (200–250 °C). A 2500-hour single running with a full DMO conversion and 96–98% EG selectivity can also be achieved at 210 °C, which is extremely longer than those of reported Cu/SiO2 catalysts to the best of our knowledge. To gain further insight into the InNi3C0.5-catalyzed DMO-to-EG reaction, the first-principle calculations were performed, and the calculations reveal that the EG formation occurs easily but its following hydrogenation to generate EtOH is hindered by the higher reaction energy barrier for this step."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The Ni-foam felt was purchased from Suzhou Taili Material Co., Ltd; the oxalic acid (H2C2O4, 99 wt% purity), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 99 wt% purity), indium nitrate hexahydrate (In(NO3)3·6H2O, 99 wt% purity), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 99 wt% purity), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99 wt% purity), and SiO2 support were purchased from Aldrich; the silica sol (30 wt%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The preparation of monolithic InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst began with the preparation of NiC2O4·2H2O/Ni-foam (NiC2O4·2H2O, nickel oxalate dihydrate) via hydrothermal synthesis. The three-dimensional Ni-foam with 1.5 mm thickness and 100 pores per inch was employed as the substrate. At first, the circular Ni-foam chips with 8 mm diameter were punched down from the large Ni-foam felt followed by sonicated in ethanol and then in hydrogen chloride (HCl) solution of 0.1 M for 30 min, respectively. The H2C2O4 (6 mmol) and NH4Cl (0.8 mmol) were dissolved into distilled water (80 mL) under magnetic stirring. The as-sonicated Ni-foam chips of 2 g as well as the solution of H2C2O4 and NH4Cl were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave pressure vessel with a volume of 120 mL, and this system was hydrothermally treated at 160 °C for 24 h. The NiC2O4·2H2O/Ni-foam products were washed using deionized water and dried at 100 °C for 6 h (the amount of NiC2O4·2H2O could be determined by calcining NiC2O4·2H2O/Ni-foam in air for 2 h at 450 °C (namely that the mole of NiC2O4·2H2O is equal to that of NiO: NiC2O4·2H2O + 1/2O2 → NiO + 2CO2 + 2H2O), and the amount of NiO could be determined by H2-TPR (namely that the mole of NiO is equal to that of H2: NiO + H2 → Ni + H2O)). Subsequently, the NiC2O4·2H2O/Ni-foam was impregnated with an aqueous solution of In(NO3)3·6H2O (of which amount was determined by the needed InNi3C0.5 amount) by the incipient-wetness method, followed by 100 °C-drying for 12 h and 450 °C-calcination for 2 h in air to obtain the In2O3-NiO/Ni-foam. At last, the as-obtained In2O3-NiO/Ni-foam was packed into a quartz tube with inner diameter of 8 mm and carburized in a syngas with H2/CO molar ratio of 3 at 350 °C for 2 h, and the final product of InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam was obtained. For comparison, two catalysts of InNi3C0.5/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2 were prepared. For the InNi3C0.5/SiO2 catalyst, the In(NO3)3·6H2O (0.7 mmol) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (2.1 mmol) were dissolved in distilled water (1.5 mL), and then the SiO2 (1.0 g) was incipiently impregnated with this solution. After 100 °C-drying for 12 h, 450 °C-calcination in air for 2 h, and 350 °C-carburization in a syngas (H2/CO mole ratio of 3) for 2 h, the InNi3C0.5/SiO2 could be obtained. The Cu/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by the ammonia-evaporation method as described elsewhere [14]. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (20 mmol) was dissolved in distilled water (60 mL), and ammonia aqueous solution (25 wt%) was added dropwise into the solution to a pH of 12 for obtaining a copper ammonia solution. Silica sol (30 wt%; 15 g) was added into the copper ammonia solution under vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature followed by the same stirring for 4 h. Then, the suspension underwent ammonia evaporation to deposit Cu species onto silica in a 90 °C oil bath under vigorous stirring, until to the pH value of this suspension to be 7. The final mixture was separated by vacuum filtration and the filtrate was dried at 100 °C for 12 h and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h in air to obtain the fresh Cu/SiO2 catalyst."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Ultra IV diffractometer (Japan) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) at 25 mA and 35 kV at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi S-4800; Japan) to visualize their surface morphology and cross-sectional structure. The InNi3C0.5 size and nano-structure of catalysts were visualized by transmission electron microscope (TEM; FEI-Tecnai G2F30; USA) at 300 kV. The samples for TEM tests were prepared by uniformly dispersing the catalysts in ethanol, followed by placing onto Cu grids. The N2-sorption isotherms were acquired on a BELSORP-MAX gas adsorption analyzer at −196 °C, and before testing, the catalysts were degassed under high vacuum at 300 °C for 6 h. Using the standard Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, the specific surface area (SSA) of catalysts could be calculated based on the N2 adsorption branch, while using the Barrett-Jovner-Halenda (BJH) method, the pore size distribution could be determined also based on the adsorption branch. The NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and CO2-TPD experiments were conducted on a TP 5080 multifunctional automatic adsorption instrument (Xianquan Industrial and Trading Co. Ltd.) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and an online mass spectrometer (Proline Dycor, AMETEK Process Instrument, USA). Before tests, each catalyst (150 mg) was treated in a H2/N2 flow at 350 °C for 1 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, the sample was adsorbed with NH3 or CO2 until saturation, and then was flushed by He at ambient temperature. These TPD analyses were carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The fragment of m/z = 17 and 44 were drawn as the characteristic pattern of NH3 and CO2, respectively. Quasi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out on an AXIS SUPRA system (Shimadzu/Kratos) equipped with an in-situ reactor chamber, using a standard Al Kα X-ray source (300 W) with an analyzer pass energy of 40.0 eV. All binding energies were referenced to the adventitious C1s line at 284.8 eV."
5,Catalysis evaluation,"2.4 Catalysis evaluation The catalysts were tested in a stainless-steel fixed-bed tubular reactor with 300 mm length and 8 mm inner diameter. Typically, ten InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam chips (0.5 g; 1.5 mm thickness by 8 mm diameter) were packed layer-by-layer into the reactor, and then were pre-treated in a syngas with H2/CO mole ratio of 3 at 350 °C and 0.1 MPa for 2 h. Notably, the height and diameter of catalyst bed of 0.5 g InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam are ca. 15 mm and 8 mm, respectively, and the height to diameter ratio is 1.9; for the particulate InNi3C0.5/SiO2 (100–150 meshes) of 0.5 g, the bed height and diameter are ca. 16 mm and 8 mm, respectively, and the height to diameter ratio is 2.0. When the temperature was cooled down to the reaction temperature in syngas, H2 was switched into the reactor with raising H2 pressure to the desired value, while the 13 wt% DMO methanol solution was pumped into a evaporator of 200 °C and then into the reactor. The reaction conditions were investigated as follows: reaction temperature from 180 to 250 °C, H2/DMO molar ratio from 45 to 180, weight hourly space velocity of DMO (WHSVDMO) from 0.22 to 2.2 gDMO gcat − 1h−1, and H2 pressure from 0.5 to 3.5 MPa. For each test, the effluent was condensed in a cold trap of −5 °C (C-balance is in the range of 94–99%, Table S1), and the obtained liquid was analyzed using a Shimadzu 2014C gas chromatography that was equipped with a flame ionization detector. The gas products were analyzed by an HP 6850 gas chromatography equipped with a ShinCarbon ST packed column and a thermal conductivity detector. Only trace CH4 and CO were formed under our reaction conditions studied. Thus, the conversion of DMO with selectivity to product was calculated based on the following equations: D M O c o n v e r s i o n % = 1 - f DMO A DMO , o u t Σ f i A i , o u t + f DMO A DMO , o u t × 100 % Selectivity % = f i A i , o u t Σ f i A i , o u t × 100 % where fi is the relative molar calibration factor and Ai,out is the chromatographic peak area at the outlet, with i representing the individual product (i.e., EG, MG, EtOH, methyl acetate, propanol/isopropanol, butanol/isobutanol, propanediol, butanediol, 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol)."
6,Turnover frequency (TOF) and apparent activation energy calculations,"2.5 Turnover frequency (TOF) and apparent activation energy calculations The TOF was defined as the total number of DMO molecules transformed into the desired product by one active site (i.e., 3Ni-In site and 3Ni-C site are active sites revealed in our previous study [36]) per unit time under the controlled reaction conditions. Assuming that the InNi3C0.5 nanoparticles were in a uniform spherical shape, the specific surface area (S A: m2 g−1) of the InNi3C0.5 nanoparticles in InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam was estimated based on their XRD-determined particle size of 13 nm by the following equation [36,43]: S A = 6 ρ × d InN i 3 C 0.5 where ρ is the bulk InNi3C0.5 density. Notably, the area of 3Ni-C and 3Ni-In sites accounted for 25.0% of the total surface area of InNi3C0.5(111) surface (Scheme S2). Assuming that all supported InNi3C0.5 nanoparticles exposed the InNi3C0.5(111) surface, the N (total amount of 3Ni-C and 3Ni-In sites) was calculated by the following equation: N = S A × 25.0 % A ( 3 N i - C o r 3 N i - I n ) where A (3Ni-In or 3Ni-C) is the area of one 3Ni-C site or one 3Ni-In site (one 3Ni-C site has the same area to one 3Ni-In site, 3.132 × 10-20 m2). The apparent activation energies for the DMO-to-MG, MG-to-EG, and EG-to-EtOH reactions over the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst were calculated based on the Arrhenius plot. The experiments for TOF and activation energy calculations were conducted under a kinetic-limiting region with DMO conversion below 15% (which could be well maintained via controlling the WHSVDMO). In these cases, the external diffusion effects on the catalyst performance were excluded by controlling the linear velocity of the feedstock (Fig. S1), and the internal-diffusion and heat-transfer resistances were also excludable due to the thin catalytic layer and high thermal conductivity of Ni-foam [18,44]. The dispersion and surface area (SCu) of Cu species were determined by N2O chemisorption at 90 °C. Specifically, 100 mg catalyst was reduced at 300 °C in a 10 vol% H2/Ar flow for 30 min using a 5 °C min−1 heating rate. Then, the sample was exposed to a 10 vol% N2O/Ar flow (50 mL min−1) for 1 h at 90 °C to oxidize the surface Cu0 to Cu2O. Finally, the sample was flushed with Ar and cooled to 40 °C to start a H2-TPR program. Cu dispersion was calculated by dividing the amount of chemisorption Cu sites into the total supported Cu atoms; the SCu was calculated by assuming spherical shape of the Cu metal particles and 1.47 × 1019 Cu atoms per square meter."
7,Pressure drop within catalyst bed,"2.6 Pressure drop within catalyst bed Pressure drop within the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam and InNi3C0.5/SiO2 (100–150 meshes) beds was measured in a quartz tube (i.d., 16.0 mm) with each catalyst dosage of 1.0 mL. A N2 flow was fed into the quartz tube continuously under the control by calibrated mass flow controllers. A U-type differential pressure gauge was used to measure the pressure drop at room temperature."
8,Density functional theory (DFT) calculations,"2.7 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The spin-polarized DFT [45] calculations were performed within the projector augmented wave (PAW) [46] method by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The exchange and correlation effects were described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [47] under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The energy cutoff for plane waves was set at 400 eV. A k-point grid of 4 × 4 × 4 and 3 × 3 × 1 was employed for the bulk InNi3C0.5 and InNi3C0.5 (111) surface calculations, respectively. The ionic relaxation loop would stop until the maximum residual forces on each atom reached below 0.03 eV/Å. The transition states were determined by the climbing-image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) [48] and dimer method [49] as implemented into VASP. All the transition states were verified to exhibit only one imaginary frequency. A vacuum spacing of at least 15 Å along c direction is employed. Adsorbates are placed on one side of the slab; therefore, the dipole correction is used along c direction. The InNi3C0.5(111) surface, the most stable one among the low-index surfaces [36], was represented with a 2 × 2 supercell of four metal layers where two bottom layers were fixed at their bulk geometry while the upper layers were allowed to relax."
9,Results and discussion,
10,"Fabrication, geometry, morphology and structural features of the catalyst","3.1 Fabrication, geometry, morphology and structural features of the catalyst The monolithic Ni-foam owns the intensified heat/mass-transfer ability and enhanced hydrodynamics behavior, making itself attractive for the strongly endo-/exo-thermic reactions [36–38], but its low SSA goes against the high dispersion of catalytic active species. Utilizing the autologous chemical activity of metallic Ni in Ni-foam enables the in-situ growth of a nanostructured Ni-containing catalytic layer, which is a feasible method to develop the high-performance structured catalysts. The synthetic route of the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The Ni-foam substrate is hydrothermally treated to endogenously grow the nickel oxalate (NiC2O4) nanorods (Fig. S2A) onto the Ni-foam surface, and the hydrothermal conditions have been optimized as follows: at hydrothermal temperature of 160 °C for 24 h in an aqueous solution of 10 mmol L-1 NH4Cl and 75 mmol L-1 H2C2O4 (Fig. S3). Subsequently, the NiC2O4/Ni-foam is incipiently impregnated with the aqueous solution of In(NO3)3, followed by 450 °C-calcining in air and 350 °C-carburizing in a syngas for 2 h. The optimization of catalyst preparation conditions reveals that the preferred InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst can be obtained with 2 wt% In content (Fig. S4). Fig. 1B shows the optical photograph and SEM image of the as-obtained InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst in the form of circular-chips. The monolithic feature and three-dimensional open-cell structure of Ni-foam can be well preserved after the in-situ growth of InNi3C0.5 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the smooth surface of Ni-foam is greatly roughened due to the homogeneous growth of InNi3C0.5-layer with thickness of about 2 μm (Fig. 1C) and with nanoporous structure (Fig. 1D). As a result, the SSA obviously rises from 0.3 m2 g−1 of the pure Ni-foam substrate to 3.1 m2 g−1 of the as-obtained InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst (Fig. S2B). Moreover, such structured catalyst shows an outstanding mechanical robustness and the as-grown InNi3C0.5 layer has a strong adhesion with Ni-foam strut, evidenced by a small weight loss even after a 5-h ultrasonic treatment in methanol (Fig. S2C). Fig. 1E shows the XRD patterns of the samples during the catalyst preparation process. As a reference, the XRD pattern of pristine Ni-foam substrate is shown with the characteristic diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4° (JCPDS No. 65–2865; pattern a). After hydrothermal treatment, the sample represents seven diffraction peaks at 18.9°, 22.7°, 30.5°, 35.4°, 40.9°, 47.7° and 48.9°, attributed to NiC2O4·2H2O formation (JCPDS No. 01–0299; pattern b). After impregnation with In(NO3)3 and subsequent calcination at 450 °C in air, the peaks of NiO (37.3°, 43.3° 62.9° and 75.4°; JCPDS No. 04–0835; pattern c) are clearly detected, whereas no any peak of In2O3 phase is detectable, indicating that the In2O3 is highly dispersed on the Ni-foam surface. The as-obtained In2O3-NiO/Ni-foam could be facilely transformed into InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam in syngas at 350 °C, clearly evidenced by the four diffraction peaks at 33.5°, 41.3°, 48.1° and 70.4°, which are indexed as (110), (111), (200) and (220) planes of InNi3C0.5 (JCPDS No. 28–0468, pattern d). Consistently, the high-resolution TEM images display the uniformly dispersed InNi3C0.5 nanoparticles with size of about 13 nm (Fig. S2D), whose lattice fringes give an inter planar distance of 0.218 nm corresponding to InNi3C0.5(111) plane (Fig. 1F,G). The high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) mapping visually illustrates that C, In and Ni distribute homogeneously in the mapped part (Fig. 1H), further confirming the homogeneous formation of the InNi3C0.5 nano-intermetallic. Moreover, the thermodynamic calculations in Ref. 36 indicate that the InNi3C0.5 formation is thermodynamically favorable with large ordering energy."
11,"Catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability","3.2 Catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability The catalytic performance of as-obtained InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalysts for the gas-phase hydrogenation of DMO to EG was investigated in a fixed bed reactor. What’s to be noted is that the total selectivities to gaseous carbon-containing products (CO, CO2, methane, ethane and dimethyl ether) are less than 0.1% under all reaction conditions, and thus these gaseous products were neglected in the product distribution calculations (Figs. S3-5). The preferred catalyst (with 2 wt% In, for details to see Figs. S3,4) achieves a full DMO conversion with 96% EG selectivity at 210 °C and WHSVDMO of 0.44 h−1 by using H2/DMO molar ratio of 90 under H2 pressure of 2.5 MPa (Fig. 2 A). Among the catalyst preparation parameters, the carbonization temperature has a great influence on the catalyst performance (Fig. S4): DMO conversion was increased from 86.5% to 95.6% and then to 80.1% along with carbonization temperature from 250 °C to 350 °C and then to 500 °C. This is likely due to the insufficient formation of InNi3C0.5 at low carbonization temperature of 250 °C but the enlarged InNi3C0.5 size at high temperature of such as 500 °C. Moreover, the reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, H2/DMO molar ratio, WHSVDMO, and pressure were optimized (Fig. S5). Clearly, the high reaction temperature, high H2/DMO molar ratio, and high pressure as well as low WHSVDMO favor DMO hydrogenation to EG, whereas the over-high reaction temperature and H2/DMO molar ratio facilitate the hydrogenation dehydroxylation of EG to EtOH. In particular, a high H2/DMO molar ratio is necessary for DMO hydrogenation on all catalysts (Table S2), because of the difficult activation of ester group. In other words, the high H2/DMO molar ratio is conducive to the activation and timely reaction of ester group. Notably, the turnover frequency (TOF) of the preferred InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam is 636 h−1, much higher than those (i.e., below 130 h−1) of the typical Cu-based catalysts at 190–210 °C [18,39–41] (Fig. 2B and Table S2). In addition, several contrastive catalysts including Ni-foam, Ni/SiO2, and In2O3/SiO2 were prepared with the formation of corresponding active components (proved by the XRD patterns in Fig. S6). These contrastive catalysts were tested under the identical reaction conditions. As expected, they all deliver trace DMO conversion (Table S3), again indicating the high performance of InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam for this reaction. The high catalytic performance of the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst is originated from the properties of both monolithic Ni-foam and InNi3C0.5 shell. The Ni-foam has irregular three-dimensional network (Fig. 1B), open structure, and high permeability (to eliminate radial diffusion limitation and offer high eddy-mixing behavior, thus intensifying the mass-transfer (Fig. S1), reducing pressure drop (Fig. S7), and improving catalyst performance (the relative experimental and computational simulation studies can be found in refs. [50–53]). In addition, an InNi3C0.5-layer with thickness of about 2 μm and with nanoporous structure (Fig. 1C,D) was uniformly grown onto Ni-foam surface, and it is easily understood that such thin and porous InNi3C0.5 layer can offer much higher transferring ability for reactant molecules than the long and narrow pores of the traditional particulate oxides supports (such as SiO2 and Al2O3) of dozens of meshes. For example, the specific surface area of InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam (1.8 m2 g−1) is much lower than that of InNi3C0.5/SiO2 (100–150 meshes, 200 m2 g−1), and the InNi3C0.5 particle size for InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam (13 nm) is bigger than that (9 nm) for InNi3C0.5/SiO2 (calculated by Scherrer Equation according to the characteristic diffraction peak of InNi3C0.5(111) in Fig. S6). However, the InNi3C0.5/SiO2 can fully convert DMO with 75.7% EG selectivity (with 16.3% MG selectivity, Table S3) at 210 °C and 2.5 MPa using a WHSVDMO of 0.44 h−1 and a H2/DMO molar ratio of 90, which is inferior to the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam (96% EG selectivity with full DMO conversion under identical reaction conditions, Fig. 2A). As for the heat-transfer, the Ni-foam has much higher thermal conductivity than the particulate oxide supports such as SiO2 and Al2O3, causing temperature rising in catalyst bed otherwise (Table S4). Moreover, the high temperature favors EG hydrogenation to EtOH. Therefore, the EtOH selectivity over InNi3C0.5/SiO2 is 1.8%, higher than 0.2% over InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam (Table S3), indicating that the high thermal conductivity of Ni-foam avoids the EG hydrogenation to EtOH to some extent. What’s to be noted is that many studies have investigated the effects of enhanced heat/mass-transfer of Ni-foam [37,50–53] and mass-transfer of thin layer [18,44]. Moreover, 16.3% MG was formed over the particulate InNi3C0.5/SiO2 catalyst, likely due to its relatively low catalytic performance, and there still were other by-products with 6.2% selectivity (including methyl acetate and C3-C4 diols, Table S3), which can be formed on the acid/base sites [12–16]. On the basis of above results, we are confident that the InNi3C0.5 nano-intermetallic serves as vital active sites to govern the catalytic performance, while the high thermal conductivity and high permeability stemmed from the Ni-foam are central to the notion of fully utilizing the intrinsic activity and selectivity of the InNi3C0.5 [37,38,42,54–56]. Moreover, the DMO-to-EG process is always facing the EG over-hydrogenation to EtOH, because the EG-to-EtOH thermodynamic constant is much larger than that of DMO-to-EG, which will notoriously degrade the EG selectivity even with a slight temperature-rising (Table S5). Nevertheless, the EG-to-EtOH reaction over our InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst is not very kinetically sensitive to the reaction temperature, assuring a good maintenance of high EG selectivity within a relatively wide temperature range. Fig. 2A shows the temperature dependent conversion and product selectivity for the DMO-to-EG using the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam. Clearly, the DMO conversion is always maintained at 100% through the whole temperature range studied, whereas the EG selectivity shows a volcano-shaped evolution with the climax of 96% at 210 °C. Notably, such catalyst achieves a temperature window of 200–250 °C with EG selectivity of > 90%, being much wider than that (190–210 °C even at > 88% EG selectivity concomitantly with more EtOH formation (e.g., >10% at 210 °C), Fig. 2C) seen with the Cu/SiO2 prepared strictly according to the widely applied and recommended procedures (see the detailed preparation information). A wide temperature window for the high EG selectivity maintenance is of great importance in industry because the strong exothermicity of DMO hydrogenation to EG always rises the temperature in catalyst bed and thus favors the EG over-hydrogenation. Undoubtedly, our InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst enables the facile control of high selectivity of intermediate EG. Furthermore, the high sintering resistance is desired for a catalyst used in such strongly exothermic reaction process due to the presence of high-temperature hot spots in catalyst bed. To check the sintering resistance of our InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam, we initially tested this catalyst at 210 °C for 140 h followed by heating the catalyst at high temperature of 450 °C in N2 flow for 12 h and continuously tested the catalyst for another 148 h at 210 °C. Interestingly, high EG yield of 96% at full DMO conversion is well maintainable throughout the entire 300 h testing (Fig. 2D). On the contrary, the EG yield for the Cu/SiO2 catalyst decreases gradually from 88% to 84% in the initial 140 h and promptly to 62% after heating at 450 °C and finally to 32% in another 148 h. More encouragingly, our InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst is very stable under industrial-relative reaction conditions with full DMO conversion and 96–98% EG selectivity throughout an entire 2500 h testing (Fig. 2E), which is much longer than any catalyst ever reported (Table S2). As shown in Fig. 2F, the InNi3C0.5 crystalline phase is still well survived on the used catalyst. Moreover, the catalytic layer exfoliation, nanosheets collapse, or InNi3C0.5 sintering is not detected by the TEM/SEM measurements (Fig. 2G-I), indicating the good maintenance in terms of morphology and nano-structure of the catalyst. Undoubtedly, the high sintering-/coke-resistance of the intermetallic InNi3C0.5 as well as the well-maintained morphological and nano-structural properties of the as-grown InNi3C0.5-shell assures the high catalytic performance maintenance for the long-term DMO-to-EG process."
12,Intermetallic catalysis of InNi3C0.5: Experimental and theoretical evidences,"3.3 Intermetallic catalysis of InNi3C0.5: Experimental and theoretical evidences In spite of the outstanding DMO-to-EG performance of our InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst, the catalytic nature of the intermetallic InNi3C0.5 able to highly actively and selectively hydrogenate DMO to EG is still not clear. To seek the answer, the kinetic studies for three cascade reactions involved in the DMO hydrogenation (i.e., DMO-to-MG, MG-to-EG and EG-to-EtOH) were first carried out over both the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam and the Cu/SiO2 catalysts, and the apparent activation energies of such two catalysts for these three reactions were calculated (Fig. 3 A-C). The InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam and Cu/SiO2 catalysts have similar apparent activation energies for the DMO-to-MG process (49 kJ mol−1 vs. 46 kJ mol−1), whereas for the MG-to-EG process, the apparent activation energy of the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam (43 kJ mol−1) is slightly lower than that (54 kJ mol−1) of the Cu/SiO2. Notably, for the EG-to-EtOH process, the apparent activation energy of the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam is 95 kJ mol−1, much higher than 61 kJ mol−1 for the Cu/SiO2. In short, the InNi3C0.5 shows interesting intermetallic catalysis in the DMO-to-EG process, in nature, mildly lowering the energy barrier for the MG-to-EG reaction but greatly lifting the energy barrier for the EG over-hydrogenation to EtOH in comparison with the Cu/SiO2. Moreover, for the DMO hydrogenation to EG process, the acidity and basicity of catalyst supports should be avoided, because more favorable side-reactions (mainly including the etherification reaction to form 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol over the acidic sites, and Guerbet reaction to form propanediol and butanediol over the basic ones) will take place unavoidably otherwise [12–16], which severely deteriorate the EG selectivity. Therefore, the acidic-basic properties of the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam and Cu/SiO2 were also probed by NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD experiments (Fig. 3D,E). Clearly, the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam achieves very low basicity and acidity of about 87 μmol gcat -1 and 13 μmol gcat -1, respectively, being much lower than those of 267 μmol gcat -1 and 178 μmol gcat -1 of the Cu/SiO2, thereby greatly suppressing the ethers/diols formation (ethers/diols selectivity at 200–240 °C: 1.3–4.1% for the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam vs. 1.6–16.8% for the Cu/SiO2, Fig. 2A,C). The high energy barrier of EG-to-EtOH process and low acidic and basic surface sites on our InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam ensure the maintenance of high EG selectivity even at relatively high reaction temperature. In addition, the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst was characterized by in-situ XPS. The In3d spectrum is shown in Fig. 3F, with four deconvoluted peaks: 451.3 and 443.6 eV for In0 species in InNi3C0.5, and 452.6 and 444.9 eV for In3+ in In2O3. The Ni2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 3G, and the peaks at 852.2, 855.2 and 860.4 eV are assigned to Ni0 in InNi3C0.5, Ni2+ in NiO, and satellite peak, respectively. The C1s core level is fitted with four deconvoluted peaks at 288.3, 286.3, 284.8 and 283.2 eV (Fig. 3H), corresponding to C=O, C-O, adventitious carbon contamination, and carbide [57,58], respectively. Notably, the InNi3/Ni-foam was also probed by in-situ XPS, showing the C1s peaks of C=O, C-O, and adventitious carbon contamination with peak intensity comparable to the ones for the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam (Fig. S8A). This observation indicates that the C=O, C-O, and adventitious carbon contamination have nothing to do with the InNi3C0.5 formation. In addition, the surface atomic ratio of In0/Ni0/CCarbide is 1.00/2.89/0.47 (Fig. S8B), very close to the stoichiometric ratio of InNi3C0.5 of 1/3/0.5. These above results confirm again that InNi3C0.5 is formed on the catalyst. Moreover, the In3+ and Ni2+ species cannot be fully alloyed with each other to form InNi3C0.5 after reduction in H2 and carburization in a syngas with H2/CO molar ratio of 3 at 350 °C. Some In2O3 and NiO species exist on the catalyst surface in the form of extremely small particles or clusters, which cannot be detectable by XRD. Although some acid-base sites can be introduced by NiO and In2O3, the amounts of acid-base sites on our InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst surface are very low (Fig. 3D,E), which can be further evidenced by the very low selectivity to by-products. Accordingly, we believe that the InNi3C0.5 plays a dominant role in governing the catalyst performance, whereas the roles of NiO and In2O3 should be minor and were not explored in this work. We further carried out the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal the reaction pathways on the intermetallic InNi3C0.5 surface at atomic-molecular level. The InNi3C0.5(111) surface was selected as the ideal surface due to its highest XRD-diffraction intensity and the lowest surface free energy [36]. The InNi3C0.5(111) structural model as well as the two active sites of 3Ni-In and 3Ni-C was established according to the previous study [36], and was illustrated in Fig. S9. What’s to be first noted is that there is no stable chemisorption configuration of molecular H2 on the InNi3C0.5(111) surface, and the physically adsorbed H2 spontaneously dissociates into 2H* on the Ni sites with no reaction energy barrier (Fig. S10), thus generating abundant H* atoms during the DMO hydrogenation process. Accordingly, the DMO adsorption as well as its stepwise hydrogenation can be merely focused on. Fig. 4 explores the possible pathways of the DMO hydrogenation on the InNi3C0.5(111) surface as well as the adsorbed structures of corresponding organic species and the reaction rate constant of each step. The detailed optimized structures of the reactant complexes, transition states and important intermediates (IMs) are illustrated in Fig. S11, and the corresponding reaction energy (E r), reaction energy barrier (E b), pre-exponential factor and reaction rate constant at 210 °C are listed in Table S6. According to our DFT calculations, DMO has two adsorbed manners including physical adsorption and chemical adsorption on the InNi3C0.5(111) surface, and the chemical adsorption is the reaction starting configuration. Firstly, the H* attacks the O end of C=O in ester group of the DMO* to generate the intermediate of CH3OCOHCOOCH3* with an E b of 1.34 eV, while another possible pathway is that the H* attacks the O in –OCH3 group to generate CH3OH* and CH3OCOCO* with an E b of 1.14 eV (Fig. 4A). Obviously, the latter pathway is easier to take place. In the following step, the H* is facilely added into the obtained CH3OCOCO* to form CH3OCOCHO* (0.33 eV) instead of CH3OCOCOH* (1.13 eV). Next, there are two possible pathways to the hydrogenation of CH3OCOCHO* to MG*, via alkoxy intermediate (CH3OCOCH2O*) and hydroxyl intermediate (CH3OCOCHOH*). In the former case, C end of C=O in aldehyde group is attacked by H* to form CH3OCOCH2O* intermediate (0.67 eV) followed by further hydrogenation to finally form MG* with an E b of 1.30 eV. In the latter case, O end of C=O in aldehyde group is attacked by H* to form CH3OCOCHOH* (0.95 eV), which further undergoes H* addition to give MG* with a lower E b of 1.22 eV than 1.30 eV of the CH3OCOCH2O* hydrogenation. Clearly, for the DMO-to-MG process, the most favorable reaction pathway is DMO* → CH3OCOCO* → CH3OCOCHO* → CH3OCOCHOH* → MG*, where the rate-limiting step is the last step of the CH3OCOCHOH* hydrogenation to yield MG* with the highest E b of 1.22 eV and the lowest reaction rate constant of 15. Similarly, MG can be further hydrogenated into EG by stepwise H* addition (Fig. 4B). However, the H* will attack the C end of C=O in ester group instead of the O end of C=O or the O in –OCH3 group, generating the alkoxy intermediate of CH3OCHOCH2OH* with an E b of 0.69 eV, which is different from the starting point of the DMO hydrogenation. In the following steps, the half-hydrogenated intermediate undergoes the consecutive H* addition to finally form EG*. The MG-to-EG process yields the most favorable pathway of MG* → CH3OCHOCH2OH* → CHOCH2OH* → HOCHCH2OH* → EG*, where the rate-determining steps of the hydrogenation of CH3OCHOCH2OH* to release CH3OH* and the CHOCH2OH* hydrogenation to yield CHOHCH2OH* present close E b of 1.07 and 1.03 eV, respectively. For the EG-to-EtOH process, the dissociation of C-O band in EG that links the –OH and –CH2CH2OH is found to present a very high E b of 1.70 eV, indicating that the EG* dissociation is difficult to occur (Fig. 4C). And the generated –CH2CH2OH* will be facilely added to H* to form EtOH* (1.06 eV). Nevertheless, the residual OH* tends to react with another OH* to release H2O* and O*, rather than through the H* addition, according to our previous work [36]. In brief, the E b of the rate-limiting step for the MG-to-EG process (1.07 eV) is slightly lower than that for the DMO-to-MG process (1.22 eV) whereas the sequential EG over-hydrogenation is hindered due to the much higher E b of 1.70 eV (Fig. 4D), which is consistent with the above-mentioned experimental results. The corresponding ratio of reaction rate constants at 210 °C of the rate-limiting steps for the conversion of DMO-to-MG, MG-to-EG, and EG-to-EtOH is about 1:10:10-6."
13,InNi3C0.5 for chemoselective hydrogenation of other carbonyl compounds,"3.4 InNi3C0.5 for chemoselective hydrogenation of other carbonyl compounds Inspired by the DFT insight of that the InNi3C0.5 is very active to activate C=O, but is inactive for further hydrogenation of alcohol, the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst was extended to the hydrogenation of other carbonyl compounds to the corresponding alcohols. The typical carbonyl compounds of esters (such as ethyl acetate), furfurals (such as furfural), aldehydes/ketones (such as acetone), acids (such as acetic acid) and CO2 were systematically hydrogenated with the results summarized in Table S7. The InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst displays promising catalytic performance for all of them. For example, 99% ethyl acetate conversion with 99% ethanol selectivity, 98% furfural conversion with 91% furfuryl alcohol selectivity, 65% acetone conversion with 99% isopropanol selectivity, 99% acetic acid conversion with 99% ethanol selectivity and 4.9% CO2 conversion with 84% methanol selectivity can be obtained over the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst under corresponding reaction conditions. These results involving a variety of hydrogenations definitely show an exciting generality of InNi3C0.5 to hydrogenate various carbonyl compounds. Herein we discover its superior performance for carbonyl groups hydrogenation to the corresponding alcohols, making a great progress owing to such stable and excellent catalyst being capable of replacing the conventional Cu catalysts that suffer from relative poor lifespan."
14,Conclusions,"Our results demonstrate an outstanding InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst engineered with high permeability and enhanced heat/mass transfer for the strongly exothermic DMO hydrogenation to EG process (ΔH298K = −81.7 kJ mol−1). The preferred catalyst is highly active (TOF: 636 h−1 vs. 130 h−1 or less for the Cu/SiO2), selective and stable, achieving a full DMO conversion with a high EG selectivity of 96% at 210 °C and 2.5 MPa using a WHSVDMO of 0.44 h−1 and a H2/DMO molar ratio of 90. Such catalyst is stable for at least 2500 h without any sign of deactivation, which is extremely longer than those of reported conventional Cu/SiO2 catalysts to the best of our knowledge. Particularly, this catalyst shows a wide temperature window of 200–250 °C at the EG selectivity above 90%, which is significantly important in industry due to the presence of local overheating in catalyst bed. Moreover, relative low acidic and basic surface sites of InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst are favorable to inhibit the formation of by-products (C3-C4 diols and ethers) even at high reaction temperature. Over the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam, the formation of EG is kinetically favorable while the reaction activation energy (E a) for EG over-hydrogenation to form EtOH is markedly lifted in comparison with the Cu/SiO2. As predicted by DFT calculations on the InNi3C0.5(111) surface, the DMO-to-MG is started by H* attacking the O in –OCH3 group of the DMO* whereas the sequential MG-to-EG goes on with H* attacking the C end of C=O in ester group instead of the O end of C=O or the O in –OCH3 group of the MG*. The most favorable reaction pathway is DMO* → CH3OCOCO* → CH3OCOCHO* → CH3OCOCHOH* → MG* → CH3OCHOCH2OH* → CHOCH2OH* → HOCHCH2OH* → EG*. The reaction energy barrier (E b) of the rate-limiting step for the MG-to-EG process (1.07 eV) is slightly lower than that for the DMO-to-MG process (1.22 eV) whereas the sequential EG over-hydrogenation to EtOH has a much higher E b of 1.70 eV. Furthermore, the InNi3C0.5/Ni-foam catalyst also qualifies for the hydrogenation of other esters, aldehydes, ketones, acids, furfurals, and CO2 to the corresponding alcohols, being an attractive alternative of the conventional Cu catalysts challenged by easy sintering for application in a serial of carbonyl compounds hydrogenation processes."
