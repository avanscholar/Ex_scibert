0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is now universally accepted as an environmentally safe, renewable energy resource and an ideal alternative to fossil fuels that doesn’t contribute to the greenhouse effect. Since, production of H2 from fossil fuels and by other conventional means (except electrolysis) is concurrent with CO2 generation, biological H2 production is considered environmentally friendly. Furthermore these techniques are well suited for decentralized energy production in small-scale installations in locations where biomass or wastes are available, thus avoiding energy expenditure and costs for transport [1]. Through biological H2 production process microorganisms can recover and concentrate the energy from high water containing organic resources such as industrial effluents and sludge in a usable form. So, biohydrogen production in a sense is an entropy reducing process, which could not be realized by mechanical or chemical systems [2]. Furthermore, renewable biomass can be used as substrates for biological H2 production facilitating both bioremediation and energy recovery. In nature the microorganisms have been using H2 as a fuel source for billions of years. Although hydrogenases present in the microorganisms catalyze a deceptively simple reaction, they have proved to be some of the most complex and ingenious bioinorganic structures known. Microorganisms generate H2 for two principle reasons, first to dispose of excess reducing equivalents or as a byproduct in nitrogen fixation. Microbial H2 production is an attractive process for supplying H2 required for the near future. Galore microbial species, belonging to the genera Clostridium, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Bacillus are reported to produce H2 through dark fermentation [2]. Apart from pure cultures, various mixed micro-flora and co-cultures have also been explored for H2 production from carbohydrates [1–3]. Nevertheless, the quest for ideal microbe(s) for H2 production has thrust the researchers to screen various sources. On the contrast, several substrates have been experimented for the maximization of biological H2 production. The feasibility of fermentative H2 production from organic wastes or wastewaters has been widely demonstrated by various researchers [4–11]. Hypothetically, development of technology for conversion of waste to molecular H2 has the potential to address the several economic and environmental issues. Sewage sludge is an important renewable energy source, which unlike others can be more harmful to the environment if not utilized or properly disposed. The high nutrient content makes it an ideal consideration as fermentative substrate especially in biological H2 production. The prime advantage is expensive management and disposal of sewage sludge can be surmounted. The amount required for disposal can be converted into a credit against the cost of H2 production. A typical sewage sludge consists of around 41% protein, 25% lipid, 14% carbohydrate, and 20% unknown components on the basis of COD [12]. But these organics are mostly non-utilizable; hence pretreatment becomes essential to render them suitable for H2 fermentation [5]. Another credible option is co-digestion with other carbohydrate rich biomass like food waste [6] or molasses. However, there remains considerable effort yet to be put in this aspect of study. Most studies on biological H2 production from sewage sludge have exploited enriched, mixed microbial consortia or pure microbial strains. The present study deals with the suitability of pretreated sewage sludge as the primary substrate for microbial H2 production and also to make a comparative study with that of using defined substrate. Another objective was to develop a constructed microbial consortium and assess its potential for maximization of H2 production. This endeavor may solve the problem of sewage sludge disposal to a great extent and concurrently attend certain important limitations of biological H2 production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and culture condition,"2.1 Microorganism and culture condition All H2 producing bacteria used in the present study were isolated in previous studies [15] and cultured on growth media, Nutrient broth (Himedia laboratories), consisting of peptic digests of animal tissue 5.0 g/l, sodium chloride 5.0 g/l, beef extract 1.50 g/l, yeast extract 1.50 g/l. Initial pH of the media was adjusted to 6.0 prior to sterilization. The liquid cultures for inoculum were uniformly grown at 37 °C in an incubator-shaker at 250 rpm, for 12 h. The maintenance of culture, preparation of seed culture and production media composition was same as reported earlier [13]."
3,Sewage sludge,"2.2 Sewage sludge Sewage sludge was procured from local municipal sewage treatment plants, Titatgarh and Dasnagar, WB, India. The sludge was collected from the sludge-thickening step of the activated sludge treatment process. The collected sludge was stored in carboys at 4 °C."
4,Hydrogen production in batch fermentors,"2.3 Hydrogen production in batch fermentors Experiments were carried out in jacketed glass reactor (of working volume 500 ml) placed on a magnetic stirring platform using the free suspended cells (Fig. 1 ). Defined medium, MYG (1% w/v Malt extract, 0.4% w/v yeast extract and 1% w/v glucose) with glucose as limiting substrate has been found to be most suitable for H2 production in earlier studies. Malt and yeast extract ensured sufficient supply of nitrogen, phosphorus and growth factors for the bacteria. The pretreatment of sludge included sterilization, (15% v/v) dilution and supplementation with 0.5% w/v glucose [15]. All the media and glassware were autoclaved for 15 min at 121 °C. 12 h old culture of the bacterium grown in nutrient broth (Himedia Inc.) was used as inoculum (10% v/v). Anaerobicity was maintained by flushing with Ar for 5 min after the inoculation."
5,Methods of analysis,"2.4 Methods of analysis 2.4.1 Hydrogen The gas was collected in a graduated water displacement system containing saline solution. The composition of the gas (in the collector) was analyzed by a Gas chromatograph (Perkin–Elmer) with TCD using Porapak-Q column and N2 as carrier gas at 5.62 kg/cm2 pressure and 20 ml/min flow rate. Injector, oven and detector temperatures were set at 120 °C, 120 °C and 200 °C respectively. The chromatogram was developed and analyzed using software, Turbochrome Navigator (version 4.1) Perkin–Elmer Coorp. 2.4.2 Physico-chemical characteristics The effluent from the reactor was collected at regular interval of time for analysis. Physical parameters viz. COD, TS, VSS etc. were estimated using standard methods [16]. 2.4.3 Glucose concentration Reducing sugar content of the medium was estimated spectrophotometrically (UV–VIS Spectrophotometer Perkin–Elmer, λ = 630 nm) using Anthrone reagent [17]. 2.4.4 VFA and alcohols VFA and alcohols present in the spent media were estimated by GC using FID Detector, capillary column (0.5 mm diameter × 30 m length) at preset injector, oven and detector temperatures, 250 °C, 200 °C and 280 °C respectively. The operation of the capillary column was amenable to a temperature programming process within 100–200 °C (Flow rate of carrier gas (N2), combustion gas (H2) and zero-air were set at 20 ml/min, 50 ml/min and 500 ml/min respectively)."
6,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The bacterial cells were harvested from freshly grown log-phase cultures. The pelleted cells were fixed using 2% Formaldehyde/0.02% Picric acid in 0.1 mol Sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Subsequently dehydrated in ethanol gradient of 50–100% and stored in desiccator. SEM images of prepared samples were obtained using a JEOL JSM-5800 scanning electron microscope with incident electron beam energy of 1 keV and working distance of 6 mm."
7,Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE),"2.6 Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) PCR-DGGE was used to study microbial community structure in the constructed microbial culture. 2 ml of the sample from the bioreactor was collected and centrifuged at 5000g for 5 min and pellets obtained were resuspended in 50 μl sterile MilliQ water. 1 μl of this mixture was used as the template for PCR (PCR-1) to amplify 16S ribosomal DNA sequences using universal primer R1492 (5′-GGTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) and domain Bacteria-specific 27F primer (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) [14]. The thermal cycling program used for amplification was as follows: pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 40 s, elongation at 72 °C for 90 s, and post-elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. The reactions were subsequently cooled to 4 °C. Thus obtained ∼1.5 kb amplicon was analyzed on 1.5% w/v agarose gel and used as DNA template for the subsequent PCR (PCR-2) to incorporate a GC clamp in the DNA fragment prior to DGGE [18]. Universal reverse primer DGB99 (5′-ATTACCGCGCTGCTGG-3′) and specific forward bacterial primer DGB90 containing a GC clamp (in bold) (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) were used to amplify the ∼200 bp fragment of the V3 region. The PCR program corresponded to 20 cycles of three steps: 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 0.75 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, 10 cycles of three steps: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 0.75 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were stored at 4 °C and analyzed on 1.5% w/v agarose before DGGE. DGGE analysis of the amplicons was performed as previously described by Zoetendal et al. [19], using the Dcode Universal Mutation Detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with 8% w/v polyacrylamide gels and a denaturant gradient of 30–60%. A 100% denaturing solution was defined as 7 M urea and 40% formamide. Electrophoresis was performed for 16 h at 70 V in a 0.5 × TAE buffer at 60 °C. DGGE gels were stained with SYBR Green for 15 min and analyzed on GelDoc XR 1708170 system (Bio-Rad)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Construction of defined consortium using H2-producing strains,"3.1 Construction of defined consortium using H2-producing strains Investigators have explored various sources for the isolation and characterization of microbial strains having higher H2 production potential; most focused being sewage sludge [4,7,8,19–23]. The three microbial strains viz. Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08, Citrobacter freundii IIT-BT L139 and Bacillus coagulans IIT-BT S1 have been established in previous studies for their ability to produce significant amount of H2 [13,15]. In the present investigation, they were tested in consortium for their potential to produce biohydrogen from sludge. At the primary level it was found necessary to explore the phylogenetic relationship of these bacteria to understand their microbial diversity and ability to co-exist within a consortium. It is well known that Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains are closely related belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, Bacillus strain was more phylogenetically related to Clostridium belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. The members of these groups have been known from earlier works for their potential H2 yields. These bacteria are metabolically versatile, grow in minimum mineral salts, and utilize a wide range of carbon sources. The significance of biological diversity for ecosystem function is highly debated; however, greater species diversity is generally associated with improved community function and stability. The effect of diversity on ecosystem function may be due to the following reasons: (i) more efficient utilization of resources due to increased competition, niche differentiation, and resource exploitation; (ii) presence of individual species with crucial functional characteristics. Community structural and functional characteristics may, however, be as important as overall diversity. Defined communities allow the researcher to manipulate specific factors such as the degree of functional redundancy among individuals, and provide greater confidence that potentially deleterious organisms are not being introduced into the system. Interestingly, these bacteria have been found to naturally co-exist in sources like sewage sludge. Recently it was reported that E. cloacae and C. freundii as constructed consortium in carrier induced granules were able to produce H2 from sucrose [24]. There were also reports available on conversion of complex substrates to H2 by these pure microbial strains [15,25]. The three strains were unique in their H2 production ability. SEM micrograph of the strains is depicted in Fig. 2 . The bacteria were found to be morphologically similar (small rods ∼2 μm long). Besides morphology they also shared physiological characteristics in being facultative anaerobes. These physiological characteristics may be one of the many reasons why the strains were able to co-exist."
10,Hydrogen production from synthetic nutrient medium MYG,"3.2 Hydrogen production from synthetic nutrient medium MYG This has been an attempt to study H2 production ability of a constructed microbial consortium consisting of three bacteria derived from different sources. In the preliminary studies, their H2 production ability was tested on a defined medium, MYG (1% w/v Malt extract, 0.4% w/v yeast extract and 1% w/v glucose) with glucose as limiting substrate, which was found most suitable for H2 production. Optimal conditions of pH, temperature, inoculum age and inoculum volume 6, 37 °C, 12 h and 10% v/v respectively were considered as reported in previous studies. Looking at the comparative profiles (Fig. 3 ), change in cell mass concentration remained similar in all the cases except in case of C. freundii where lag phase was longer. However, the substrate concentration profile in case of consortium shows rapid decrease in the initial 16 h of fermentation and remains plateau thereafter. This trend corresponds with the trend of H2 production which is logarithmic until 16 h, suggesting that it was directly dependent on glucose concentration in the medium. After 16 h, the pH falls to below 4 and the further increase in the VFA (acetate and butyrate) production inhibits the production of H2. As a pure culture, E. cloacae gave higher yield (325.52 ml H2/g CODreduced) using defined medium than the other two strains (Fig. 4 ). There was however, appreciable 10% increase in maximal yield of H2 when (1:1:1) consortium was used. The result indicated that E. cloacae probably dominated in the consortium when defined medium was used. It was confirmed in the DGGE analysis (Fig. 5 ). Although DGGE is not a quantitative method due to the bias introduced by PCR, the density change of each band can be explained as a consequence of a change in the relative abundance of the microbes in the microbial community [26]. Another interesting finding was that the COD reduction was maximum in case of E. cloacae, justifying its superior ability to convert glucose to H2."
11,Hydrogen production from sludge,"3.3 Hydrogen production from sludge Pure culture of B. coagulans gave better biohydrogen yield (37.16 ml H2/g CODreduced) than the other two strains when sewage sludge was used as substrate (Fig. 4). Considering (1:1:1) consortium as inoculum, yield of H2 was recorded to increase to 41.23 ml H2/g CODreduced. However, this yield of H2 from sludge was far lower than that achieved from defined medium, MYG. It was found that COD reduction was maximum when constructed consortium was used. The 10% increase in the H2 yield with respect to B. coagulans therefore inferred that in consortium, the substrate conversion to H2 is significantly higher. Analyzing the microbial profile of the spent sludge indicated that B. coagulans dominated in the consortium when pretreated sludge was used as substrate (Fig. 5.). B. coagulans strain was originally isolated from the same sludge for its H2 production ability [12]. A possible explanation for this dominance is that, B. coagulans needed no acclimatization in its natural habitat to initiate H2 production therefore it was able to convert the sludge nutrients to H2 more efficiently than the other members of the consortium. Since sludge is a complex substrate the total nutrients solubilized by the consortia should be higher than that achieved by individual bacteria. E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 besides H2 has also been reported to produce amylase [24]. Similarly, C. freundii IIT-BT L139 has been established for alkaline lipase production [27]. In other studies, it has been found that B. coagulans had cellulase [28], xylanase [29], amylase [30] and protease [31] producing abilities. These versatile characteristics of the bacteria in consortium may be the possible reasons for the increased COD reduction and H2 yield. The H2 yield from pretreated sludge obtained in this study has been found to be higher than the earlier reports (Table 1 ). Kim et al. [5] has reported higher H2 yield (122 ml H2/g carbohydrate COD) from co-digestion of (83:17) food waste and sewage sludge. However, food waste rich in carbohydrates was the major component in that study not sewage sludge."
12,Conclusions,"Biohydrogen production from renewable substrates is a promising area of research in the sustainable H2 economy. Little work has been done on biohydrogen production from renewable substrates using constructed or complex microbial consortia. Though raw sewage sludge is abundant in several nutrients, the low H2 yield from it suggests the need for nutrient and seed formulation so as to augment its exploitation as suitable substrate for H2 production. Heat pretreatment coupled with optimal dilution and sugar supplementation is an attempt in this direction. The present study has been a unique attempt in using a constructed microbial consortium for the improvement of H2 production from sewage sludge. It was observed in the present study that dominance of a member in the constructed microbial consortium depends mostly on the substrate used. The yield achieved using this constructed microbial consortium and pretreated sewage sludge was higher than that reported till date. Co-digestion and process optimization can prospectively help in attaining further improvement in H2 yield. This augmentation of yield however is required before it can be transformed for commercial exploitation."
