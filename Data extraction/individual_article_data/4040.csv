0,Introduction,"Disengagement and purification of the target compounds are the main stages in industrial chemical processes. One of the main methods of separation is distillation, the use of which is limited in some special but technologically important cases, e.g. separation of azeotropic mixtures or mixtures of closely boiling components. In such cases, the most effective and popular process is extractive distillation, see, e.g. [1–3]. Modern separation technology meets a lot of other problems connected with complex nature of initial mixtures, such as the systems of petroleum or biotechnology industries. As a result scientists and engineers propose and use various special approaches for multicomponent mixtures separation (for example, [4–7]). One of important types of complex multicomponent systems are the systems with ester synthesis reaction. The significance of esters determined publications many works devoted to the phase equilibria in these systems [8,9]. Ester are used as a solvent and applied to various fields, such as air freshener, confecting essence, detergent, etc. Esters of propionic acid also are considered promising candidates as a component of second generation biofuels due to simple production from biomass wastes. They can be advanced fuel additives for gasoline, because they have attractive energy densities and high octane number [10,11]. The industrial esterification reaction processes encounter problems in the separation of esters and alcohols, since these two components can form azeotropes [12,13]. At present, for the separation of such mixtures, organic solvents are used which have a number of significant disadvantages associated with their high saturated steam pressure and high energy consumption for regeneration [14]. In recent years, more attention is paid to the issues of «green chemistry». One of the first alternatives that was able to replace classical solvents became ionic liquids (IL) [15]. IL are salts in the liquid state and consist of an organic cation and an inorganic anion. They have unique properties: a melting point below 100 degrees and a very low saturated vapor pressure [16–18]. However, recent studies have reported that IL cannot be considered completely «green» solvents [19]. Other new solvents are deep eutectic solvents (DES) which has been proposed as a green alternative not only to IL, but also to traditional solvents [20]. DES are a mixture consisting of a hydrogen bond donor and an acceptor, upon mixing which forms a liquid with a lower melting point than the individual components. DES have similar physico-chemical properties, but can be composed of green and biodegradable components [21–23]. They are much cheaper than IL and can be easily synthesized, which makes them more preferable for the using as extractant. Accordingly, the industrial applications of DES are very promising [21,24,25]. This work is a continuation of the study of phase equilibria in the systems with DES conducted by our scientific group [26–28]. The main direction of our research is a testing of different DES for the use in extraction processes. Recently we published a data concerning the using DES for the separation of mixtures of alcohols with acetic acids esters. In presented paper, we consider the feasibility of the using DES on the basis of choline chloride and malonic acid for the separation of mixtures of alcohols with propionic acid esters: n-propyl propionate and n-butyl propionate. The experiments were carried out at two temperatures, 293.15 K and 313.15 K. The efficiency of the separation was evaluated on the basis of the calculated values of the selectivity and the alcohol distribution coefficient."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ethanol (≥0.990 mass fraction), n-propanol (≥0.990 mass fraction), n-butanol (≥0.990 mass fraction), ethyl propionate (≥0.99 mass fraction), n-propyl propionate (≥0.99 mass fraction), n-butyl propionate (≥0.99 mass fraction) and malonic acid (≥0.98 mass fraction) were purchased from “Vecton” (St. Petersburg, Russia): these reagents were used without additional purification. Choline chloride was obtained from AppliChem (≥0.98 mass fraction). Purities of organic liquids were checked by gas chromatographic analysis (GC) and are presented in Table 1 . The simultaneous thermal analyser STA 449 F1 Jupiter (Netzsch) equipped with quadrupole mass-spectrometer QMS 403C Aëolos (Netzsch) was used for testing the purity of the components of DES."
3,Preparation of DES,"2.2 Preparation of DES Before the experiment, choline chloride was dried to remove water. The drying was carried out under vacuum (1 Pa) with heating up to 70 °C during 5 h. Further, choline chloride and malonic acid were placed in 5 ml vials in the mole ratio equal to 1:1 [22]. Components were weighed on analytical balance Shinko VIBRA HT-120CE (Japan) with an accuracy of 0.001 g. Then, to accelerate the formation of DES, vials were placed in ultrasonic baths at a temperature of 40 °C for 3 h. As a result, a colourless transparent liquid (DES) was obtained. The water content was measured after the preparation of DES by the Karl Fischer titration method. All samples of the DES contained less than 0.5 wt% water. Since the establishment of the phase equilibrium takes considerable time and the mixture is hygroscopic and can absorb water upon equilibration, the possible water content was evaluated. Using the method of gas chromatography, it was found that there is no water in both phases."
4,LLE determination,"2.3 LLE determination For the study of LLE we used ordinary procedure for such experiments. Certain amounts of alcohol and propionic acid ester were placed in the vials with preliminary prepared DES. The vials were placed in a thermostat with an accuracy of maintaining the temperature of 0.05 K. The mixtures were stirred with a magnetic stirrer for (3–4) hours. Then mixtures were kept during 12 h until complete stratification. For the quantitative analysis, each of the phases was separately selected and analysed by GC. Gas chromatograph “Chromatec Crystal 5000.2” (Russia) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and packed column Porapak R (1 m * 3 mm i.d.) was used for determination of phase compositions. The quantitative interpretation of chromatograms was carried out by external standard method. Standard uncertainty of GC analysis averaged 0.005 mass fraction. Taking into account the spread of the experimental LLE data, the overall standard uncertainty of the composition determination was estimated in 0.015 mass fraction. Earlier, in our work [26], we confirmed the preservation of DES components during the phase equilibrium study into a system with alcohols and acetic acid esters. Similar results are consistent with the results of studies in [29]. However, we conducted an additional experiment for the systems under study and found that the ratio between the DES components remains constant (Supplementary material). NMR analysis was used only to estimate the ratio of DES components, the experimental data on LLE were obtained by the GC method. Therefore, in this paper, DES is considered as a pseudo-component, and, for the sake of simplicity, the phase equilibria of the quaternary mixtures are presented in composition triangles. In this case, the phase diagram is a projection onto a composition tetrahedron."
5,Results and discussion,
6,LLE data,"3.1 LLE data The equilibrium raffinate and extract compositions at 293.15 and 313.15 K are presented for the systems ethanol – ethyl propionate – DES, n-propanol-n-propyl propionate – DES and n-butanol-n-butyl propionate – DES in Tables 2–4 , respectively. On the basis of experimental data, the LLE tie-lines were plotted (Figs. 1–3 ). The Hand correlation [30] was used to validate the reliability of experimental tie-line data. The high value of correlation factor (R2 > 0.99) indicates consistency of the obtained LLE data. To describe the efficiency of the extraction process the distribution coefficient of the component (β i) and the selectivity (S) were calculated. which are defined as follows: (1) β i = w i II w i I (2) S = w i I w i II w j II w j I Symbol w denotes the mass fraction of component i in phases I (organic-rich) or II (DES-rich). The calculated distribution coefficients of alcohols and selectivity for studied systems are listed in Tables 2–4 and presented in Figs. 4–7 . The temperature dependence of the alcohol distribution coefficients (Fig. 4) is practically absent. The decrease the alcohol distribution coefficient with the growth of the alkyl chain of alcohol is clearly noticeable. The distribution coefficients for the system ethanol–ethyl propionate–DES varied in the range of 0.8–0.9 for the n-propanol–n-propyl propionate–DES system – 0.45–0.55 for the n-butanol–n-butyl propionate–DES system – 0.15–0.25. Probably, the decrease in the distribution coefficients is connected with a decrease in the polarity of the alcohol molecule due to the growth of the alkyl chain and. as a consequence. a decrease in the hydrogen bond strength between DES components and alcohol molecules. The change in selectivity as a function of temperature and alcohol concentration is shown in Figs. 5–7. Selectivity increases with the decrease of alcohol concentration in raffinate and the decrease of temperature but remains at the same level for each of the systems. The lack of literature data on phase equilibrium for similar systems with the participation of DES or IL does not provide an opportunity to conduct a comparative analysis of selectivity for various mixtures of alcohols with esters. The only comparison can be performed on the base of the data sets presented in our paper [26] for the mixtures with esters of acetic acid. The main conclusions of such analysis concern the dependence selectivity on temperature. In general, the selectivity of separation of alcohol-propionate systems is much higher in comparison with alcohol-acetate systems and there is no clearly pronounced temperature dependence of the selectivity for acetate systems. Probably the nature of these phenomena should be also connected with the difference of alkyl chains in esters."
7,Modelling of LLE,"3.2 Modelling of LLE The experimental data were correlated by NRTL model [31]. We used NRTL equation for the activity coefficients in the solution of n components of the following form: (3) l n γ i = ∑ j = 1 m x j τ ji G ji ∑ l = 1 m x l G li + ∑ j = 1 m x j G ij ∑ l = 1 m x l G lj τ ij - ∑ r = 1 m x r τ rj G rj ∑ l = 1 m x l G lj (4) τ ji = g ji - g ii RT = Δ g ji RT . G ji = e x p - α ji τ ji . α ji = α ij where gji is energy parameter characterizing interaction between components j and i; x is the mole fraction of component. The physical sense of parameter αji is the nonrandomness of the system. Optimization tool for calculation NRTL parameters that minimize the composition values was objective function (OF) in following form: (5) OF = ∑ k = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n x ik exp - x ik cal I 2 + x ik exp - x ik cal II 2 The obtained parameters are presented in Table 5 . Standard deviation σ was calculated using equation: (6) σ % = 100 ∑ k = 1 n ∑ i = 1 3 x ik exp - x ik cal I 2 + x ik exp - x ik cal II 2 2 m n where x is mole fraction of component, subscripts i and k indicate components and tie-lines respectively; n is a number of tie-lines. m is a number of components; I. II – organic and DES phases respectively. Simulation was performed at the average temperature for each system. Thus, optimization of the model for the ethanol – ethyl propionate – DES system was carried out at 303 K. At the same time, the deviation for each temperatures did not exceed 0.85% (Tables 2). The results of NRTL modelling are in good agreement with experimental data. Deviation for the systems n-propanol – n-propyl propionate – DES (Table 3) and n-butanol – n-butyl propionate – DES (Table 4) did not exceed 0.7% and 0.58% respectively."
8,Conclusions,"The phase equilibria was estimated in the systems ethanol – ethyl propionate, n-propanol – n-propyl propionate and n-butanol – n-butyl propionate with the participation of DES. Choline and malonic acid chloride were studied at 293.15 K and 313.15 K. The performance capability of DES as an extractant was estimated on the basis of the alcohol distribution coefficient and the value of selectivity. The results show high selectivity values and the possibility of the using this DES for the extractive separation of mixtures of different alcohol with esters of propionic acid. The effect of the temperature and length of the alcohol alkyl chain on the efficiency of separation was established. The increase in the alkyl chain has practically no effect on the selectivity values, while the increase in temperature decreases the selectivity. However, the coefficient of distribution depends slightly on temperature and decreases with the growth of the alkyl chain of alcohol. The thermodynamic processing of the experimental results using NRTL model showed high consistency of obtained values: the deviation between the experimental and calculated data is no more than 0.85%."
