0,Introduction,"The importance of renewable energy sources increases as the issues of fossil fuel exhaustion and global warming become serious. Considering the energy security and the global environment, there is an urgent need in developing a clean and renewable energy source. Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier, generating only water when it burns. However, for hydrogen production to meet sustainability requirements, it must be produced from renewable resources. One way to produce hydrogen renewably is through fermentative biohydrogen production from potential renewable materials such as carbohydrate-containing biomass and organic wastes [1–3]. In principle, the theoretical hydrogen yield from glucose fermentation can be estimated by a known metabolic pathway [4], giving a maximum yield of 4 mol hydrogen per mol of glucose when acetic acid is produced as the only fermentation metabolite. However, in practice, several studies observed actual hydrogen yields close to or lower than 2 [1], even with pure culture experiments and defined substrates such as glucose or sucrose [5–8]. It is assumed that several factors including thermodynamics [9,10], metabolic regulation [11–17], kinetics [16–19], microbial community structure [20–22], or a combination can cause the distribution of electron equivalents into products other than hydrogen and acetate. Consequently, the relatively unpredictable hydrogen yield and unstable biohydrogen process can be a drawback of its application. Hydrogen production from anaerobic waste treatment possesses potential benefits in both reducing organic wastes and generating a sustainable energy source at the same time, but it also creates challenges because the waste materials usually are composed of a variety of substrates that can be used by different species of microorganisms [1]. Unfortunately, some microorganisms present in wastewaters or fermentation systems can consume hydrogen, leading to a lower hydrogen production efficiency. Control strategies such as maintaining a low pH value in the reactor, using a heat-treated inoculum, and using a short hydraulic retention time (HRT) can be applied to minimize the growth of hydrogen-utilizing microorganisms such as methanogens in continuous reactors [21–24]. Additionally, organic waste compositions and characteristics are also important to hydrogen fermentation. Carbohydrates including sugars and starch have been studied for its potential application for hydrogen production [1], but such information for organic nitrogen compounds is relatively limited, except that peptone has been reported as a nitrogen source for enhancing hydrogen production of hydrogen-producing bacteria [25,26]. Furthermore, microbial community structures in hydrogen-producing bioreactors fed with single substrate such as glucose [27], sucrose [20,28], xylose [28], and starch [29] have been investigated recently using molecular methods, and the occurrence and importance of hydrogen-producing bacteria, mostly clostridial species, are usually reported for their correlation with hydrogen production. However, hydrogen-consuming bacteria present in bioreactors and their connection to the frequently observed low hydrogen yield are rarely discussed. In this study, we present experimental results of anaerobic hydrogenation performance in bioreactors operated at different HRT conditions, with glucose–peptone and starch–peptone as carbohydrate and nitrogen sources. Investigation on microbial ecology in both bioreactors was also performed using molecular methods including cloning/sequencing and denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Finally, the effects of HRT on hydrogenation performance and microbial ecology in both bioreactors, and, most importantly, the connection between them are discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Operation of continuous stirred tank bioreactors,"2.1 Operation of continuous stirred tank bioreactors Two continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) were operated in this study. One bioreactor (GP) was fed with 12,000 mg/L of glucose and 8000 mg/L of peptone, while the other one (SP) was fed with 12,000 mg/L of starch and 8000 mg/L of peptone for all experimental runs. The total volume of the GP-fed bioreactor was 2.5 L with a working volume of 1.5 L. A complete-mix condition was achieved with a magnetic mixer at an agitation speed of 300 rpm. For the SP-fed bioreactor, the total volume was 25 L with a working volume of 10 L, and the bioreactor was equipped with a mechanic propeller for mixing. Each liter of the influent feed was supplemented with 528 mg of MgCl2·6H2O, 380 mg of KCl, 73.4 mg of CaCl2·6H2O, 5.8 mg of MnCl2·4H2O, 8.8 mg of CoCl2·6H2O, 1.6 mg of H3BO3, 0.8 mg of CuCl2·2H2O, 24.8 mg of FeCl2·4H2O, 0.74 mg of Na2MoO4, and 0.62 mg of ZnCl2 [30]. The influent medium solution was stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator and continuously fed into the bioreactors using a peristaltic pump. In order to avoid fermentation in the feed tank and to provide sufficient alkalinity required for neutralizing the acids produced in the bioreactors, 240 mL of 70% liquid sodium hydroxide was added in every 20 L of the influent feed solution, resulting in a pH of 11 of the feed solution. Without additional pH control for the CSTRs, the pH values ranged from 6.1 to 6.5 in the bioreactors in all experimental runs. The seed microorganisms for the bioreactors in each experimental run were obtained from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket bioprocess treating food processing wastewater. Before seeding, the anaerobic sludge was pretreated by boiling for over 30 min in order to minimize introducing methanogens into the bioreactors [23]. During this study, no observable methane gas was detected in the bioreactors. In each run, the bioreactors were seeded with fresh pretreated inocula at an initial concentration of 200 mg/L and the data were collected from the bioreactors after operation of a period passing through more than 10 reactor volumes. The amount of gases produced in the bioreactor was measured with a wet-gas flow meter (Shinagawa W-NK-0.5B, Tokyo, Japan). The bioreactors and the off-gas flow meter were kept in an air-bath incubator and the temperature was maintained at 35 °C."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods Biogas collected from both bioreactors was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (China GC 8900, Taipei, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2 m stainless column was packed with Hayesep Q (60/80 mesh) and installed in a 60 °C oven. The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were all set at 60 °C. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. The volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were determined using an ion chromatography (Dionex DX-120, California, USA) equipped with an anion IonPac ICE-ASI column, an AMMA-ICE II suppressor, and a conductivity detector. The carbohydrate was analyzed using the phenol-sulfuric acid method [31]. The pH, ORP, NH4 +-N and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to standard methods [32]."
4,Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) test,"2.3 Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) test The BHP test employed in this study was a modified version of biochemical methane potential (BMP) test developed by Owen et al. [30]. The test was carried out in a series of 120 mL serum bottles. To each bottle with a liquid working volume of 80 ml, 3000 mg/L of starch and/or 2000 mg/L of peptone were added as fermentation substrates. In addition, each bottle contained the following chemicals as growth nutrients (in mg/L): CaCl2·6H2O, 32.32; MgCl2·6H2O, 232.26; KCl, 167.81; MnCl2·4H2O, 63.87; CoCl2·6H2O, 3.87; H3BO3, 0.74; CuCl·2H2O, 0.35; Na2MoO4 2H2O, 0.33; ZnCl2, 0.27; FeCl2 4H2O, 10.62; sodium thioglycolate, 217.35; KH2PO4, 119. Trace amount of resazurin (0.175 mg/L) was also added as the redox-status indicator. The medium pH was adjusted to 7.2 using 3 N KOH and 3 N HCl. The bottles were capped tightly with rubber septum stoppers, flushed with oxygen free nitrogen gas, and then sterilized in an autoclave. The culture was then inoculated into the bottles and was incubated in an orbital shaker with a rotational rate of 120 rpm and a temperature of 35 ± 1 °C. Hydrogen gas production was calculated from headspace measurements of gas composition using gas chromatography and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval as previously described [33]. Samples were frequently taken throughout the batch experiments for the determination of carbohydrate and NH4 +-N."
5,DNA extractions and polymerase chain reaction (PCR),"2.4 DNA extractions and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) A modification of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-based extraction method [34] was used to obtain genomic DNA in biomass samples taken from the two bioreactors. After DNA extraction, two sets of primers for PCR amplification were employed in this study. For the 16S rRNA clone library analysis, an universal primer set including forward a primer 11F (5′ GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG 3′) and a reverse primer 1512R (5′ TACCTTGTTACGACTT 3′) was used for amplifying an approximate 1500-bp fragment of bacterial 16S rRNA gene [35]. The thermal profile used for the amplification was as follows: a hotstart at 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of denaturation (45 s at 95 °C), annealing (45 s at 52 °C) and extension (2 min at 72 °C), and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. For the DGGE profile analysis, PCR amplification was performed using the primer set of EUB968F with GC clamp (5′-CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGAACGCGAAGAACCTTAC-3′) [36] and UNIV1392R (5′-ACGGGCGGTGTGTAC-3′) [37]. The thermal profile used for the amplification was as follows: a hotstart at 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of denaturation (45 s at 95 °C), annealing (45 s at 54 °C) and extension (2 min at 72 °C), and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min."
6,"Cloning, sequencing, and phylogenic analysis of 16S rRNA gene","2.5 Cloning, sequencing, and phylogenic analysis of 16S rRNA gene PCR products (1500 bp) of 11F-1512R were purified by electrophoresis in a 1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel, and used in the construction of the 16S rRNA clone libraries. The purified PCR products were ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector and the ligation products were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells following the manufacture's protocol (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Plasmids of clones were extracted and purified using Mini-M plasmid DNA extraction system (Viogene, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern analyses for about 80 randomly selected clones, using the primer set M13F (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′) and M13R (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) and restriction enzymes Hpa II and Hha I, were performed to determine the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers. DNA sequencing reactions were performed for clones in each OTU using ABI 3100 and 3730 capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). BioEdit was used to align cloned and published sequences in GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool program developed by U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information [38]. The sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers GQ167169–GQ167197."
7,Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis,"2.6 Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis DGGE profiles of the PCR-amplified fragments were obtained using a DCode™ Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) as described previously [39]. By applying PCR products to a polyacrylamide gel with gradients ranging from 35% to 60% (70% denaturant gradient was defined as a 100 mL of mixture containing 28 mL formamide, 29.4 g urea, 2 mL 50× TAE buffer, and 15 mL 40% acrylamide stock solution (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 37.5:1)), electrophoresis was performed in 1× TAE buffer at a constant voltage of 200 V and a temperature of 60 °C for 5 h to separate the PCR products. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated for 20 min in deionized water containing silver nitrate (1 g/L), rinsed for 10 min with deionized water, color-developed for 20 min in solution containing sodium hydroxide (15 g/L), sodium tetrahydroborate (0.1 g/L), and formaldehyde (4 mL/L), rinsed for 10 min with deionized water, and then photographed for further analysis."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Performance of glucose–peptone and starch–peptone fed bioreactors,"3.1 Performance of glucose–peptone and starch–peptone fed bioreactors The experimental results of substrate and biomass concentrations in both glucose–peptone (GP) and starch–peptone (SP) fed bioreactors operated at different HRT conditions are presented in Fig. 1 . For the GP-fed bioreactor operated at HRT ≥ 2 h, the average effluent glucose concentration was measured to be less than 600 mg/L with a more than 95% of glucose consumption efficiency. At HRT of 1.45 h, the average glucose concentration was as high as 2700 mg/L with a lower glucose conversion efficiency of 78%, presumably due to wash-out of microorganisms from the bioreactor as indicated by the decreased biomass concentration from 3300 to 2500 mg/L when the HRT was reduced from 2 to 1.45 h. For the operational conditions of HRT increased from 8 to 18 h, the average biomass concentration drastically decreased from 3700 to 1100 mg/L although the consumption of glucose was more than 95%. In the bioreactor operated at a longer HRT, endogeneous metabolism or cell lysis could become substantial, leading to a lower biomass concentration [18]. For the SP-fed bioreactor, starch and biomass concentrations measured at different HRT conditions showed similar trends to those observed in the GP-fed bioreactor. At HRT of 12 and 24 h, the average starch concentrations were measured to be less than 1200 mg/L with a more than 90% of starch consumption efficiency, while decreasing HRT from 12 to 3 h, the average starch concentration gradually increased to 2500 mg/L. Similar to that observed in the GP-fed bioreactor, wash-out of microorganisms from the SP-fed bioreactor was noticeable, as indicated by the decreased biomass concentration from 4500 to 2600 mg/L, when the HRT was reduced from 9 to 3 h. A complete wash-out was observed in the SP-fed bioreactor when HRT was continuously reduced to 2 h, corresponding to an average starch concentration of 11,724 mg/L. The hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield of both bioreactors observed at different HRT conditions are presented in Fig. 2 . In general, for both bioreactors, hydrogen production rate increased with decreased HRT, but a sudden decrease in hydrogen production rate was observed when wash-out of hydrogen-producing bacteria became serious at a low HRT condition. The maximum hydrogen production rates for GP- and SP-fed bioreactors were found to be 1247 and 412 mmol-H2/L/d at HRT of 2 and 3 h, respectively. The hydrogen yield for both bioreactors observed at different HRT conditions, as indicated in Fig. 2, seemed to share a similar trend with observed hydrogen production rate. For the GP-fed bioreactor, the hydrogen yields were less than 1 mmol-H2/mmol-Hexose consumed at HRTs of 1.5, 8, 12, and 18 h, but the yield increased to 1.5 mmol-H2/mmol-Hexose consumed when HRT was controlled between 2 and 6 h. The hydrogen yield of the SP-fed bioreactor attained a maximum value of 1 mmol-H2/mmol-Hexose consumed at an HRT of 3 h, but these values were generally lower than those observed in the GP-fed bioreactor. The soluble metabolites produced in both bioreactors at different HRT conditions are summarized in Table 1 . Among these metabolites, formate, acetate, butyrate, and lactate were dominant products found in the GP-fed bioreactor, while in the SP-fed bioreactor, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate were major metabolites. During anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates such as glucose and starch, several volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols are produced as major primary metabolites, depending on microorganisms and environments present in the bioreactor [4,40,41]. In our study, neglected amount of alcohols were observed in both bioreactors. According to metabolic pathways and stoichiometric relationships proposed for anaerobic glucose fermentation, hydrogen production is accompanied with the production of acetate and butyrate, but not with production of formate, propionate, and lactate [43]. Based on available information for hydrogen production and produced soluble metabolites obtained in both bioreactors, no apparent correlation was found between hydrogen production and VFAs produced at different HRT conditions. In several studies, the ratio of butyrate to acetate (B/A ratio) has been used as an indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of biohydrogen production [7,10,14,19,20,44,45]. In Table 1, a higher B/A ratio seemed to correspond to a higher observed hydrogen yield, but the correlation between them, with a correlation coefficient of 0.5, did not seem to be statistically significant. Unlike many other studies feeding bioreactors with single organic substrate, in this study, in addition to glucose or starch, peptone was fed as an organic nitrogen substrate in order to enhance hydrogen production from carbohydrate fermentation [25,26]. Anaerobic fermentation of peptone through the Stickland reaction [41] may account for the production of VFAs such as butyrate and acetate in bioreactors but not necessary for the production of hydrogen. By examining the species of Clostridium sporogenes, Stickland [42] defined amino acids as hydrogen-accepting amino acids (e.g., proline, hydroxyproline, and glysine) or hydrogen-donating amino acids (e.g., alanine, valine, and leusine) depending on their oxidation or reduction states. Although previous studies [25,26] reported that addition of peptone as a nitrogen source would enhance growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria and hydrogen production, it is like that at a longer HRT hydrogen-accepting amino acids present in peptone were utilized, resulting in consumption of produced hydrogen. Furthermore, depending on microorganisms and environmental conditions, anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates may lead to production of acetate and butyrate without hydrogen production accompanied [4,40,41,45–47]. Consequently, without knowing microbial ecology, simple parameters such as the B/A ratio may be insufficient for properly explaining or predicting hydrogenation performance in bioreactors fed with multiple substrates like the ones investigated in this study."
10,Microbial ecology and DGGE analysis of GP- and SP-fed bioreactors,"3.2 Microbial ecology and DGGE analysis of GP- and SP-fed bioreactors Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments were performed for the biomass samples taken from the GP- and SP-fed bioreactors at the HRT condition of 12 and 3 h, respectively, in order to investigate microbial ecology of hydrogen-producing bacteria in both bioreactors. The clone sequences obtained in this study were aligned with published sequences available from the GenBank database. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, which graphically depicts the homologies of aligned sequences, is presented in Fig. 3 . According to the results obtained for the GP-fed bioreactor, among the total 62 clones retrieved, 38 clones (representing 62% of relative abundance) were phylogenetically within the genus Clostridium, 4 clones (6%) within the genus Dendrosporobacter quercicolus (formally Clostridium quercicolum), 2 clones (3%) within the genus Enterobacter, 1 clone (2%) within the genus Klebsiella, and the remaining 17 clones (27%) were related to either unidentified or uncultured bacteria. For sequences within the genus Clostridium, they were phylogenetically related to clostridial species including Clostridium celerecrescens (representing 26% of relative abundance), C. sporogenes (21%), Clostridium butyricum (5%), Clostridium sartagoforme (2%), Clostridium sulfidogenes (2%), and Clostridium mesophilum (2%). Among the total 46 clones retrieved from the SP-fed bioreactor, Lactobacillus plantarum was found to be dominant (representing 52% of relative abundance), followed by Clostridium sp. (9%), Propionispira arboris (5%), C. butyricum (2%), and Megasphaera paucivorans (2%), and the remaining 6 clones (14%) were related to either unidentified or uncultured bacteria. DGGE profiles of 16S rRNA gene fragments were performed for the biomass samples taken from both bioreactors at different HRT conditions in order to evaluate the effect of HRT on the microbial community of hydrogen-producing bacteria in both bioreactors. The results are presented in Fig. 4 . According to the results, C. sporogenes and C. celerecrescens were dominant and ubiquitous in the GP-fed bioreactor under different HRT conditions. Clostridial species are known as classical acid producers and usually ferment glucose to butyrate, acetate, carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen [4,40]. Both C. sporogenes and C. celerecrescens are capable of producing hydrogen from glucose fermentation [49]. In addition, C. sporogenes is able to metabolize various amino acids through the Stickland reaction to either produce or consume hydrogen, depending on the characteristics of amino acids [41], and C. celerecrescens is able to hydrolyze certain proteins such as gelatin [49], presumably accounting for their predominance in the GP-fed bioreactor. In the SP-fed bioreactor, L. plantarum, P. arboris, and C. butyricum were found to be dominant populations present at different HRT conditions examined. L. plantarum is a facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria [48,50,51] and studies have shown that isolated amylolytic strains of L. plantarum are capable of utilizing starch for lactate production [52–54]. Depending on cultivation conditions, anaerobic conversion of low-molecular-weight sugars by L. plantarum can lead to mainly lactate production and some trace amount of volatile acids such as acetate [50,51], but not to hydrogen production [48]. It is presumed that their amylolytic characteristic on catalyzing starch hydrolysis allowed L. plantarum strains to be dominant in the SP-fed bioreactor. P. arboris, originally isolated from wetwood of living trees, is able to produce a mixture of propionic and acetic acids from glucose [55]. In a subsequent study, Thompson et al. [46] found that the fermentation end products were regulated by the presence of hydrogen gas, which was consumed via hydrogenase, resulting in a dramatic increase in the propionate to acetate ratio. It is not clear, at this time, the reason for the dominance of P. arboris in the SP-fed bioreactor, but it is assumed that its presence was not related to hydrogen production [55]. As a result, C. butyricum, also capable of fermenting starch, was considered to contribute to hydrogen production in the SP-fed bioreactor, as suggested in previous studies using starch as hydrogen fermentation substrate [29,56]."
11,Effects of HRT on hydrogenation performance of GP- and SP-fed bioreactors,"3.3 Effects of HRT on hydrogenation performance of GP- and SP-fed bioreactors In both bioreactors, decreasing HRT, in general, increased hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield, until the minimum HRT was reached, resulting in wash-out of hydrogen-producing bacteria. At a longer HRT operation, a lower hydrogen production rate is expected due to a lower organic loading applied to the bioreactor. Unexpected low hydrogen yields observed at HRT > 8 h, however, suggest that other mechanisms, in addition to a lower applied organic loading, may present in the GP- and SP-fed bioreactors, leading to a low hydrogen production. In addition to glucose or starch, peptone was fed as an organic nitrogen substrate in order to enhance hydrogen production from carbohydrate fermentation. Ammonium nitrogen, in addition to VFAs and alcohols, can be produced from anaerobic fermentation of peptone through the Stickland reaction [41]. This observed ammonium release might account for consumption of electron donors such as NADH [4,41] and thus reduced hydrogen production [18]. For the operational conditions at HRT < 4 and 9 h for GP- and SP-fed bioreactors, respectively, peptone was utilized mainly for biomass synthesis since only less than 3% of total nitrogen applied was released as ammonium nitrogen from peptone fermentation. When HRT increased, released ammonium percentage started to increase to more than 10% as presented in Table 1, indicating that peptone fermentation through Stickland reaction may occur [41]. This phenomenon was even more significant in the GP-fed bioreactor, with a released ammonium percentage of 35% at an HRT of 12 h, presumably due to the dominance of protein-hydrolyzing C. sporogenes and C. celerecrescens. Our observations agreed well with those reported by Allison and MacFarlane [57], who grew C. sporogenes in a CSTR fed with glucose and peptone and observed decreased effluent ammonium concentration from 126 to 56 mg N/L due to reduced deamination activity as HRT decreased from 17 to 1.5 h. Fig. 5 presents the results of hydrogen production during BHP batch experiments using biomass taken from the SP-fed bioreactor operated at an HRT of 12 h. Although limited hydrogen production was detected in the SP-fed bioreactor at an HRT of 12 h, considerable amount of hydrogen production was observed in the batches fed with starch and starch/peptone, indicating that the biomass acclimated in the SP-fed bioreactor at an HRT of 12 h was able to produce hydrogen from starch. In comparison of hydrogen production from the two substrates examined, it was confirmed that the evolved hydrogen during carbohydrate fermentation could be consumed at a longer retention time, with a faster consumption rate when peptone was present. For the SP-fed bioreactor operated at HRT > 6 h, unexpected low hydrogen yield was even more obvious, presumably due to its massive production of propionate. Low hydrogen production has been related to high propionate production in bioreactors fed with glucose [58,59] and starch [19]. Based on the experimental results published by Zoetemeyer et al. [58], Vavilin et al. [60] proposed a model assuming that propionic bacteria present in the bioreactor can compete with butyric bacteria for glucose and consume hydrogen for production of propionate, acetate, and lactate. Their results suggested that propionate production by propionic bacteria can be significant at a longer HRT operation, which agreed well with our observations of substantial propionate production and P. arboris in the SP-fed bioreactor at HRT > 6 h. In addition, previous studies [46,61] indicated that P. arboris, with reversible hydrogenase activity, could consume glucose and hydrogen for propionate and acetate production, suggesting that its relative dominance might account for substantial propionate production and unexpected low hydrogen yield observed in the SP-fed bioreactor."
12,Significance for engineering application,"3.4 Significance for engineering application Conventional anaerobic fermentation processes are not able to accumulate a net production of hydrogen gas because hydrogen is rapidly consumed by methane-producing microorganisms for methane formation in the processes [62]. During this study, methane gas was not detected in both bioreactors, presumably because the relatively low HRT conditions operated were able to eliminate the growth of hydrogen-utilizing methane-producing microorganisms, with maximum specific growth rates ranged from 0.058 to 0.108 h [63,64]. For hydrogen-producing clostridial species including C. sporogenes, C. celerecrescens, and C. butyricum enriched in this study, specific growth rates between 0.12 and 0.7 h have been reported [7,8,57,65,66]. These values, however, were comparable to specific growth rates reported for P. arboris (0.18 h, [46]) and L. plantarum (0.43 h, [52]), allowing their coexistence in the SP-fed bioreactor. Only at HRT < 3 h, the negative impact on hydrogenation performance caused by to P. arboris in the SP-fed bioreactor started to decrease, while starch-hydrolyzing L. plantarum and hydrogen-producing C. butyricum were still active until wash-out of these microorganisms became serious at an HRT of 2 h. Furthermore, potential hydrogen consumption due to peptone fermentation by protein-hydrolyzing microorganisms was identified in this study, but this occurrence could be minimized by reducing HRT. As a result, optimizing HRT operation for bioreactors was considered an important asset in order to minimize hydrogen-consuming activities and thus maximize net hydrogen production. In this study, the limitation of simple parameters such as the B/A ratio in predicting hydrogen production was recognized for bioreactors fed with multiple substrates. Fortunately, understanding of microbial ecology can be a beneficial measure in order to correctly evaluate hydrogenation performance in bioreactors. Therefore, it is suggested that microbial ecology analysis, in addition to chemical analysis, should be performed when complex substrates and mixed cultures are used in hydrogen-producing bioreactors."
13,Conclusions,"This study evaluated anaerobic hydrogenation performance and microbial ecology in bioreactors operated under HRT between 1.5 and 24 h and fed with glucose–peptone and starch–peptone. At a relative long HRT operation, hydrogen consumption due to peptone fermentation could occur and thus reduced hydrogen yield from carbohydrate fermentation. C. sporogenes and C. celerecrescens were dominant hydrogen-producing bacteria in the GP-fed bioreactor, presumably due to their capability on protein hydrolysis. In the SP-fed bioreactor, L. plantarum, P. arboris, and C. butyricum were found to be dominant populations, but the presence of P. arboris at HRT > 3 h might be responsible for a lower hydrogen yield from starch fermentation. The limitation of simple parameters such as the B/A ratio in predicting hydrogen production was recognized in this study for bioreactors fed with multiple substrates. It is suggested that microbial ecology analysis, in addition to chemical analysis, should be performed when complex substrates and mixed cultures are used in hydrogen-producing bioreactors."
