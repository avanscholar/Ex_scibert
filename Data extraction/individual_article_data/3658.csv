0,Introduction,"Geothermal energy, which is the energy contained in rocks and fluids within the earth's crust and able to generate geological phenomena (e.g., volcanoes, geysers, fumaroles and hot springs), can be recovered to produce thermal and electric energy (Nuvolone et al., 2019; Bustaffa et al., 2020). In 2015, a total of 82 countries was reported to use geothermal energy for a direct utilization (i.e., thermal energy; Lund and Boyd, 2016), while worldwide electricity production from geothermal resources has been estimated to achieve up to 8.3% by 2050, serving 17% of world population (Bertani, 2016). Although geothermal energy is generally considered a more sustainable source of energy compared to carbon and fossil fuel plants and the third thermal renewable energy source in Italy, an important environmental issue related to geothermal industrial development is the emission of non-condensable gases to the atmosphere (Somma et al., 2017; Manzella et al., 2018). In addition to carbon dioxide, methane, volatile metals, silicates, carbonates, metal sulfides and sulfates and traces of mercury (Hg), arsenic, antimony, selenium and chromium, geothermal power plants also emit hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in relative high amounts (Somma et al., 2017; Bustaffa et al., 2020). Hydrogen sulfide may originate from different environmental natural sources (e.g., volcanoes, sulfur springs, undersea vents, swamps, bogs, crude petroleum and natural gas, generally in the range of μg/m3) as well as from human-derived activities (e.g., petroleum refineries, tanneries, natural gas, petrochemical, oven, and food processing plants, municipal sewers and sewage treatment plants, manure processes, and paper mills, in the range of mg/m3), thus occupational H2S exposure is generally greater compared to the one from natural environment (WHO, 2003). Hydrogen sulfide route of exposure is essentially inhalation and, in this context, it is important to note that H2S may persist in the atmosphere more days, depending on different factors (e.g., season, irradiation, ventilation) (Finzi and Brusasca, 1991). In urban areas, concentrations of H2S generally range between 1.0 and 3.0 μg/m3 (Kurtidis et al., 2008) while in proximity of volcanic and geothermal areas H2S can reach air levels up to 1500 μg/m3, as measured in Roturua, New Zealand, where the largest population center in the world is located over an active geothermal field directly used for bathing and wellness (Fisher, 1999; Bates et al., 2002; Horwell et al., 2005). In Italy, geothermal fields are used for electricity generation and all the 36 geothermal plants, which are placed in the southern part of the Tuscany region, cover over 30% of the regional electricity needs (Razzano and Cei, 2015; Manzella et al., 2019). Most of the geothermal plants are currently equipped with filters for the abatement of H2S, therefore H2S emission levels amount to 2–12 μg/m3 (period of average exposure up to 90 days) (ARPAT, 2018; Manzella et al., 2018), which are lower than those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (an average of 20 μg/m3 over a period of 90 days; WHO, 2003). In Iceland, the largest component of geothermal energy is used for domestic heating followed by electricity generation (Thorsteinsson et al., 2013). In the Reykjavik capital area, the main source of ambient H2S is from the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant located 26 km east of the city centre, and certain weather conditions such as wind speed and solar radiation allow the transport of emissions towards Reykjavik and the neighboring cities, causing local air pollution (Thorsteinsson et al., 2013). The modelled daily 24-hour concentrations of H2S calculated in 2007–2014 period ranged between 0 and 69.5 μg/m3 with a mean concentration between 3.02 and 3.89 μg/m3 (Finnbjornsdottir et al., 2016). Human health effects resulting from exposure to H2S are well known, and while very low concentrations (0.007–0.011 mg/m3) represent the odor threshold, increasing levels have been associated with bronchial constriction (2.8 mg/m3), eye irritation (5.0–29.0 mg/m3), olfactory paralysis (>140 mg/m3), up to death (>700 mg/m3) (WHO, 2003). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the globally leading cause of death, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives in 2016, which represent the 31% of all the deaths worldwide (WHO, 2017). Increases of predisposing diseases or comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, in addition to an ageing population, constitute the main cause of the rising number of subjects living with CVD (Savarese and Lund, 2017; von Lueder and Agewall, 2018). In particular, hypertension, defined as a systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, is one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis (Alexander, 1995; Špinar, 2012). The number of adults with hypertension increased to 1.13 billion people in 2015, most (two-thirds) living in low- and middle-income countries (WHO, 2019). In addition to these acknowledged cardiovascular risk factors, the hypothesis that ambient air pollutants might contribute to the occurrence and development of CVD has been confirmed over the last years. Ambient air pollution is considered responsible for 4.2 million deaths worldwide, contributing to 7.6% of all deaths in 2016, and has been estimated to cause about 25% of all deaths and disease from ischemic heart disease (IHD) (WHO, 2018). Natural phenomena and anthropogenic sources emit complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health (Lee et al., 2014). In particular, fine particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) is the most important environmental risk factor correlated with global cardiovascular mortality and disability (Rajagopalan et al., 2018). On the other hand, H2S retains a variety of biological properties, and modulates numerous pathways related to cardiovascular pathophysiology (e.g., through modulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, angiogenesis, vasodilation and activity of endothelial nitrogen synthase), although its role as beneficial/adverse determinant on CVD according to its localization and concentration is not completely elucidated (Yang et al., 2020). The few epidemiological studies carried out in geothermal areas evaluating the relationship between H2S and CVD are inconclusive, as some evidenced a protective role of H2S in atherosclerosis onset and development, while in others a positive association between exposure to H2S and increased incidence of CVD and cardiovascular risk factors has been observed. In this complex scenario, we also discuss further aspects, the production of endogenous H2S and the intake of commonly used H2S-releasing drugs that may affect final H2S “two-edged sword” effects, beneficial at low concentration but potentially harmful at higher concentration, which merit to be assessed in the CVD-H2S relationship."
1,Hydrogen sulfide and cardiovascular risk in geothermal areas,"Although the growing concern of WHO towards the health effects potentially associated to the exposure to emissions from the exploitation of geothermal energy, in the last three decades only a limited number of epidemiological studies have explored the health status of populations residing in areas where geothermal fluids are used to produce heat and electricity (Bustaffa et al., 2020) (Table 1 ). Moreover, the available results from the evaluation of health hazards relating the cardiovascular system and chronic-level of H2S exposure are conflicting (Lewis and Copley, 2015)."
2,New Zealand,"2.1 New Zealand Using morbidity and mortality data, a significant increase of incidence for diseases of circulatory system (standardized incidence rate (SIR), 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): =1.05; 95% CI = 1.02–1.07) and of mortality for hypertensive disease (standardized mortality rate (SMR), SMR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.24–2.05), in particular among men of the Maori ethnic group, was observed in the geothermal Rotorua area compared to the rest of New Zealand (Bates et al., 1998, 1997). While in these studies the whole population was assumed to be exposed uniformly to the geothermal emissions, in a subsequent investigation the authors examined hospital discharges classifying residential census area units of patients in Rotorua by exposure level to H2S (high, medium, low, corresponding to 1400, 700, 0–55 μg/m3, respectively; Horwell et al., 2005), which was based on measurements from passive samplers located around the city for specified periods of time (Bates et al., 2002). The previous findings were only partially corroborated, and a significantly elevated incidence was shown for diseases of the circulatory system (SIR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.29–1.50) and IHD (SIR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.35–1.73) in relation to H2S high-level, with a little evidence of exposure-related trends, but not for hypertensive disease (Bates et al., 2002)."
3,Italy,"2.2 Italy A residential cohort study evaluated the health effects of chronic exposure to H2S in six municipalities of the geothermal district of Mt. Amiata, which currently has five active geothermal power plants (Nuvolone et al., 2019) (Table 1). Exposure to chronic levels of H2S was assessed using dispersion modelling, and estimates were validated using data recorded from fixed monitoring sites, both for meteorological parameters and H2S metrics. Each cohort member residing in the area was georeferenced and assigned H2S exposure metrics estimated and based on residential address. The authors reported significantly lower rates of mortality than those expected for IHD (SMR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.76–0.95) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (SMR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.63–0.93) using H2S metric as a continuous variable. Conversely, a positive significant association was detected between linear H2S exposure and hospitalization for diseases of the circulatory system (SHR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.01–1.07) and heart failure (HF) (SHR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.04–1.17), whereas no association was observed for hypertensive disease, IHD, and AMI (Nuvolone et al., 2019). These results are consistent with those of two previous ecological investigations conducted in the whole Tuscany geothermal areas, which found a reduction of mortality than that expected for diseases of the circulatory system and IHD though levels of exposure to H2S in these studies were not available (Minichilli et al., 2012; Bustaffa et al., 2017). Recently, a case crossover study explored the short-term health effects associated with the daily exposure to H2S emissions from all Tuscan geothermal power plants using individual data of mortality, hospitalization and emergency department visits (Nuvolone et al., 2020) (Table 1). Each georeferenced case was linked to the H2S daily level derived from 18 monitoring sites, comparing the pattern of exposure to H2S in the event day with the pattern in the same weekday during the three weeks before the event. An increased mortality for cardiovascular causes (odds ratio (OR), 90% Confidence Interval (90% CI): OR = 1.22, 90% CI = 1.03–1.44) was associated with an increase of 10 μg/m3 of H2S daily levels exclusively among men, whereas no associations were observed between H2S daily levels and urgent hospital admissions and emergency departments visits for CVD (Nuvolone et al., 2020)."
4,Iceland,"2.3 Iceland Finnbjornsdottir et al. (2015) explored the association between daily mortality due to all causes and CVD and short-term increases in air pollutants - both geothermal H2S and traffic-related - in individuals living in the Reykjavik capital area, 18 years or older, by a population-based, time stratified case-crossover study design (Table 1). Exposure data of hourly concentrations of pollutants as well as data of meteorological variable were obtained from an air pollution measurement station. Although the interquartile range increased concentrations of the 24 h mean concentrations of H2S were related with daily all natural cause mortality, with statistically significant associations during the summer season, among males and the elderly, generally at lag 0–2 (air exposure on the same day up to 2 days before the death occurred), no significant increased risk in CVD was detected (Finnbjornsdottir et al., 2015). In a later study, short-term associations between low-level and intermittent H2S concentrations and emergency hospital visits with CVD, respiratory diseases and stroke as primary diagnosis were further investigated in Reykjavik capital area (Finnbjornsdottir et al., 2016) (Table 1). A model was applied to estimate H2S exposure in five different sections of the city, therefore patients with an emergency hospital visit were tracked through residential address, geocoded to the exact section, and assigned H2S exposure. Albeit the relative risk sizes found were very small, statistically significant associations between H2S concentrations exceeding 7 μg/m3 and increases in emergency hospital visits with CVD as primary diagnosis occurring the same day as well as with delay of two or four days were detected (lag 0 RR = 1.067, 95% CI = 1.024–1.111; lag 2 RR = 1.049, 95% CI = 1.005–1.095, and lag 4 RR = 1.046, 95% CI = 1.004–1.089). The associations were more pronounced among males at lag 0 (RR = 1.087, 95% CI = 1.032–1.146) and lag 4 (RR = 1.080, 95% CI = 1.025–1.138) and among subjects aged 73 years and older at lags 0 (RR = 1.075, 95% CI = 1.014–1.140 and lag 3 (RR = 1.072, 95% CI = 1.009–1.139) (Finnbjornsdottir et al., 2016)."
5,Hydrogen sulfide endogenous production,"It is known that exposures to very high H2S concentration levels (i.e., >250 ppm/~350 mg/m3) may provoke a sudden death, loss of consciousness, and pulmonary edema (ACGIH, 2010; ATSDR, 2016). One of the main mechanisms involved at molecular level is related to oxygen/adenosine triphosphate (O2/ATP) modulation (low concentration of H2S increases O2 uptake and ATP, and these same reactions are inhibited at higher H2S doses (20–40 μM) through the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome c-oxidase) (Olson and Straub, 2016). Increased H2S blood concentration resulted associated with higher inflammation (myeloperoxidase activity, tumor necrosis factor α-TNFα blood levels, and histological inflammatory findings in experimental models), and elevated H2S levels were observed in endotoxic shock (Li et al., 2005). Moreover, H2S at micromolar concentration can provoke DNA oxidative damage through its capacity to generate superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical (Hoffman et al., 2012). Less clear is the scientific evidence of the long-term effects of chronic low-dose H2S exposures, which do not yet allow to define a major health risk (e.g., respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, reproductive and developmental systems, and cancer), giving the observed controversial results also as a consequence of the many significant limitations presented by several studies (Lewis and Copley, 2015). Previously recognized as a toxic gas, more recently H2S has been associated to other gasotransmitters, such as nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide, produced endogenously in small quantities, with various beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, as well as on nervous and gastrointestinal systems due to cytoprotective, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties (Sun et al., 2020). Endogenously, H2S is synthetized by enzymatic (cystathionine β-synthase, cystathionine γ-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfotransferase, together with cysteine amino transferase or non-enzymatic pathways (J. Yang et al., 2019). Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-hypertrophic effects are also ascribed to H2S (Donnarumma et al., 2017). In the cardiovascular setting, the major effects include cardioprotection, heart rate decrease, inotropic and proangiogenic effects, decrease blood pressure and vasodilation (Tomasova et al., 2016). Accordingly, reduced levels of H2S have been found in patients with acute or stable coronary artery disease (Gao et al., 2015), diabetes (Yang et al., 2020), hypertension (van Goor et al., 2016), and HF (Kovačić et al., 2012). In this context, it is important to note that there is no a unique “gold standard” method, therefore the assessment of H2S (especially in blood or tissue samples) is still problematic, and available techniques are under heavy criticism (Lechuga and Chen, 2019). Consequently, reported physiological H2S concentration greatly vary (low micromolar – ten to hundreds micromolar), principally due to the variability of detection methods and different tissues in which the measurement is performed (Nagy et al., 2014). In particular, the link between H2S and NO appears strong in cardioprotection, as H2S is able to activate endothelial NO synthase and increase NO generation (Chatzianastasiou et al., 2016). Furthermore, there is evidence of an emerging role of H2S in myocardial fibrosis, which is a key determinant of heart dysfunction and HF (Zhang et al., 2015). H2S resulted to prevent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-stimulated differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts through inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, rising interesting therapeutic possibilities in the treatment of HF (R. Yang et al., 2019). H2S also retains epigenetic effects by modulation of DNA methylation, histone deacetylase, and microRNA expression (MicroRNA 21, Micro RNA 129) (Weber et al., 2017, 2016; Corsello et al., 2018). Nonetheless, as many other molecules (e.g., antioxidants), H2S may likely exert beneficial effects at low physiological concentration on different pathways, with the main involvement of oxidative stress and NO, whereas it may be detrimental when available in excess (Gaggini et al., 2020). Mouth and gastrointestinal tract bacteria may also produce H2S through metabolism of sulfhydryl proteins such as in cysteine degradation (Chun-Mei et al., 2017). It has been suggested that H2S produced in the colon may target the cardiovascular system and contribute to the control of arterial blood pressure (Tomasova et al., 2016). Additionally, the action of H2S at intestinal level appears to be dual and opposite depending on concentration, with beneficial effects at nanomolar to low micromolar levels with the maintenance of the mucus layer integrity, inflammation decrease, but able to induce deleterious effects at higher values (high micromolar to millimolar), which lead to increased inflammatory processes, and promotion of cancer onset and progression (Blachier et al., 2019)."
6,Hydrogen sulfide-releasing drugs,"The involvement of H2S in many pathophysiological pathways, and the wide number of patients (e.g., hypertension, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular disease, cancer) potentially interested for this therapeutic option, renders its use in the drug design rationale (Verma et al., 2017). However, better understanding is necessary to assess effective as well safe approaches for H2S implementation in clinical practice. Main unsolved issues related to potential risk include the fact that the “physiological” concentrations of H2S in blood or tissues are unknown, as well as the effective or toxic concentration of H2S has not been established. Consequently, significance of different routes of H2S administration requires further evaluation. Moreover, effects of different drugs (e.g. synergisms of antagonism) that can be co-administered together with H2S of other confounders are largely unknown. Many efforts are directed towards the identification of reliable donors releasing appropriate amounts of H2S, for an adequate time period. Two main different approaches to supply H2S can be adopted in order to generate a H2S precursor or, alternatively, to stimulate the endogenous system. For it concerns precursor, some molecules have been identified and tested as H2S donors, such as the most tested sodium hydrosulfide-NaHS, and sodium sulfide-Na2S. In particular, NaHS administration in experimental models has been proven to lower blood pressure, to improve left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis and decrease neointima formation, to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation, and to prevent impairment of balloon-induced vascular relaxation in a rat model of balloon-induced neointima hyperplasia (Meng et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2014; Ni et al., 2018). Due to the mutual NO/H2S interactions, Na2S/S-nitrosoglutathione (Na2S/GSNO: 10 μmol L−1/1 μmol L−1) administration has been proved as more effective in terms of vasorelaxation compared to each compound administered alone, suggesting the efficacy of H2S donors in combined treatment in the intrarenal arteries of patients with arterial hypertension (Cacanyiova et al., 2017). Nevertheless, these molecules present a short half-life, which may be a complication giving a low effectiveness in treating chronic diseases (Hsieh et al., 2019). As a consequence, GYY4137 Dichloromethane complex and polysulfides, novel molecules characterized by a more gradual release of H2S, appear promising (Cao et al., 2019). This is of particular significance in view of the results obtained by comparing two H2S donors, namely the fast-releasing-NaHS and GYY4137, which point out that H2S effects are influenced by the level and by the generation rate of H2S, as well (Whiteman et al., 2010). These compounds were evaluated according to the generation of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated murine RAW264.7 macrophages. GYY4137 was reported to significantly and concentration-dependently reduce pro-inflammatory biomarker release (interleukins such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and prostaglandin E2) and increase instead the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine. By contrast, NaHS revealed a biphasic opposite response, that is decreased or increased proinflammatory biomarker levels at low and high concentrations, respectively. Therefore, a different H2S behavior should be carefully evaluated when testing potential H2S donors according to H2S production rate. Thiosulfate, already in clinical use to treat calcific uremic arteriopathy in dialysis patients, is generated during H2S metabolism, acting as H2S donor. Treatment of hypertensive rats with thiosulfate is beneficial in lowering blood pressure and reducing organ damage (van Goor et al., 2016). Interestingly, intravenous sodium thiosulfate has been found to prevent and delay the vascular calcification progression in hemodialysis patients (Saengpanit et al., 2018), indicating that it may be considered a promising therapeutic strategy to delay and treat structural and functional vascular wall abnormalities in the CVD patient setting. In addition, very recent data suggested that patients who received sodium thiosulphate treatment, showed a reduction of iliac artery and heart valves calcification as well as several other cardiovascular functional parameters (reduced pulse wave velocity, lower carotid intima-media thickness, better echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular hypertrophy) (Djuric et al., 2020). However, one limitation to this treatment remains its intravenously administration, thus the development of gastric acid resistant capsules is expected in this field. A further application for H2S is the treatment of myocardial fibrosis (Kang et al., 2020). Experimental data suggested that many pathways can be involved in these effects from different types of exogenous H2S, such as canonical Wnt and TGF-β1/Smad3, PKC-ERK1/2MAPK, PI3K/AKT and JAK̸/STAT signaling pathways (Liu et al., 2018a, 2018b; Long et al., 2019; R. Yang et al., 2019). Of interest, nanoparticles formed by the self-assembly of phospholipid molecules, and used as carriers for the delivery of S-propargyl-cysteine - a novel H2S donor - have been tested in rats, resulting efficacious to inhibit myocardial fibrosis via the inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway (Tran et al., 2019). However, although the development of a drug with specific on-site delivery may offer several advantages over common drug administration regimens (e.g. targeted drug transport to specific target sites, prolonged drug half-life, time-controlled release, and decreased drug immunogenicity and cytotoxicity), its application in the clinical practice is still challenging (Vivek et al., 2014; Datz et al., 2016; He, 2017). Dietary intake may represent another determinant influencing H2S levels, and an interesting possibility to improve H2S deficiency that may occur in many diseases (Łowicka and Bełtowski, 2007). In this regard, garlic and garlic-derived organic polysulfides, such as diallyl trisulfide and diallyl disulfide, act as H2S donors through the reaction of thiols (e.g. glutathione), and are characterized by a different production rate (i.e., the first one as fast H2S donor, the second as slow one) (Liang et al., 2015). Moreover, diallyl trisulfide acts as a stimulator of the endogenous system upregulating the expression and enzymatic activity of cystathionine gamma-lyase, one of H2S-producing enzymes, responsible for endogenous H2S production (Xu et al., 2020). Dietary formulations, such as SG-1002 that is an oral H2S donor, have been tested in experimental model, resulting beneficial for the cardiovascular system through the modulation of different cellular pathways (e.g., NO synthase-NO- cyclic guanosine monophosphate) (Kondo et al., 2013; Barr et al., 2015; Shimizu et al., 2018; Rushing et al., 2019). Recent data suggest that increased endogenous H2S generation is responsible, at least partially, for the beneficial pleiotropic effects of dietary restriction (e.g., increased lifespan, stress resistance, and metabolic fitness), opening at a number of possible suggestions for clinical translation (Hine et al., 2015). Furthermore, many commonly used cardiovascular drugs may increase H2S levels, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ramipril; Wiliński et al., 2010), statins (Xu et al., 2014), digoxin (Wiliński et al., 2011), metformin (Ma et al., 2020) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Zhang et al., 2019). Thus, if by one side H2S can be a promising pharmacological option, to the other there is the possibility of reaching local adverse toxic level as the synergy of different exogenous/endogenous sources, which surely require further evaluation (Fig. 1 ). Notably, it should be considered that H2S can also be stored as bound sulfane sulfur, which in turns may release H2S in response to physiological stimuli (Kimura, 2011). Free blood sulfide is generally at the sub-to low micromolar concentration, but ten to hundred micromolar sulfide reserves are available, acting as a buffer to maintain free sulfide constantly below toxic levels but supplying additive sulfide pool when necessary under different conditions (Nagy et al., 2014)."
7,Discussion,"Overall, the findings of the studies examined do not allow to draw definitive conclusions. In fact, while Rotorua inhabitants exhibited excesses of CVD incidence and of mortality for hypertensive disease, in Italian geothermal areas, a significant decreased mortality for CVD compared to neighbor areas was observed, except for men with short-term exposure to high H2S levels. This is an important point, because when considering sex/gender differences, effectively there are many emerging dissimilarities in the CVD regarding coronary biology and anatomy, cardiovascular risk factor susceptibility, epigenetics modification, symptoms according to which the disease occurs, and cytochrome metabolism, which may explain different health consequences and disease manifestations in males and females (Al-Husein et al., 2018; Haider et al., 2020). At the moment, these gender- and sex-specific determinants, which may also contribute to different response in the H2S-CVD relationship remain largely unknown, and surely merit further investigation. In addition, a positive significant relationship was also found at increasing exposure to H2S and hospitalization for CVD as a group and for HF (Nuvolone et al., 2019). To date, the health effects of low-level exposure to H2S related to the emissions from natural or anthropogenic sources have not been sufficiently explored. In particular, a relatively low number of studies have evaluated the cardiovascular risk associated with the chronic exposure to H2S in geothermal areas, and most of them have an ecological design that does not allow to produce evidence to support a causal relationship. In addition to being affected by the well-known ecological bias due to the non-use of individual data (Lewis and Copley, 2015), the studies carried out are characterized by a missing or weak adjustment for confounding factors such as individual information on residential and medical history, diet, tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse, occupational exposure, as well as data about other environmental co-exposures. An important point to consider is the extent of the environmental exposure. For example, in order to compare the consequences on cardiovascular health of exogenous H2S respect to that produced endogenously, it is important to point out that, although not updated, the median concentration of H2S in Rotorua district is 35 μg/m3, even though it can reach up to 1400 μg/m3, while in Italian geothermal areas the equipment of most plants with filters has led to a significant reduction of H2S emissions, which are almost always below the limits recommended by WHO. According to a recent research, the baseline level of endogenous H2S in the plasma of healthy volunteers lies in the range of 70–125 μM (Karunya et al., 2019) that is 103–105 times the environmental concentration of H2S in geothermal areas. Hence, in addition to a partial inadequateness of epidemiological studies in exploring further risk factors that at least in part explain the excess of CVD as a whole and of other heart disease subtypes, necessarily other contributors exert a crucial action in this process. It should be noted that the classification of CVD is often referred to specific groups or large groups of diseases, which cannot be interpreted univocally, i.e., circulatory system disease, ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction, since partly overlapping. In addition, in the studies conducted in New Zealand, a diversity of disease classification between Rotorua and the rest of the country cannot be ruled out. The studies carried out in Rotorua did not always report updated H2S concentration measurements and did not evaluate Hg exposure, which may have had been elevated (Bates et al., 1998, 1997). In the study of Nuvolone et al. (2019), adopting an advanced design based on an accurate exposure reconstruction of a resident cohort and a high-quality dispersion modelling, information on individual risk factors and other environmental pollutants were missing. The Mt. Amiata area was the third largest Hg mining district worldwide, in operation until the 1980s but not yet fully reclaimed (Bustaffa et al., 2020; Lattanzi et al., 2019). Both the recent investigations performed in Italian geothermal areas (Nuvolone et al., 2020, 2019) did not include Hg, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, PM2.5, and coarse particles with the diameter from 2.5 to 10 μm (PM10), in the exposure assessment. Approximately 40.5% of the population is predicted to have some form of CVD by 2030 (Heidenreich et al., 2011) and beyond the role of ageing population, a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including pollution, has been acknowledged to exert an important influence on CVD risk, progression, and severity (Bhatnagar, 2017). Of all ambient air pollutants, PM2.5 poses the greatest health risks for a wide variety of acute and chronic illnesses and premature deaths, but predominantly from cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes (Ren et al., 2017). A systematic review and meta-analysis reported the association between short-term exposure to PM2.5, along with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide, and a higher risk of AMI (Mustafic et al., 2012). In addition to short-term effects, long-term exposure to PM2.5.and PM10 was associated to an increased risk for mortality of CVD and IHD (Pinault et al., 2017; Weichenthal et al., 2014; Lipsett et al., 2011); exposure to nitrogen oxides was also related to death for CVD (Lipsett et al., 2011). Moreover, short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10 and sulfur dioxide and long-term exposure to PM10 and NO2 were significantly associated with hypertension in each 10 μg/m3 increment (Cai et al., 2016). Even exposure at low PM2.5 levels (< 10 μg/m3 annual mean according to WHO guidelines; WHO, 2005) is considered a risk to health, and in particular to cardiovascular events (Di et al., 2017; Pinault et al., 2017; Crouse et al., 2012). Therefore, although in the Italian geothermal districts concentrations of PM10 and NO2 measured by using mobile instruments were below the thresholds recommended by WHO (Nuvolone et al., 2020, 2019), an effect of other air pollutants besides H2S on cardiovascular risk cannot be ruled out. Hg, often detected in the Tuscan geothermal areas, can precipitate from the atmosphere into the soil where a few insoluble mercury sulfide precipitates are methylated by bacteria to form methylmercury. This organic form can accumulate in the food chain and represents the most harmful Hg species to which humans can be exposed (Clarkson et al., 2003). Epidemiological studies reported that dietary intake of Hg is positively associated with risk for AMI and IHD (Salonen et al., 1995a, 1995b), mortality for CVD (Salonen et al., 1995b), as well as with a negative impact on blood pressure (Choi et al., 2009; Valera et al., 2009), carotid intima-media thickness (Choi et al., 2009) and heart rate variability (Valera et al., 2011; Yaginuma-Sakurai et al., 2010). Notably, a Korean recent study performed around abandoned metal mines showed a significant correlation between residents with higher blood Hg levels and hypertension (Kim et al., 2019). Thus, in the relationship between H2S and CVD, it would be essential evaluate the presence and levels of other pollutants, which may can play a significant role in the onset and development of the atherosclerotic disease. Moreover, the possibility of synergistic/antagonist interactions, currently still unclear and assessed in specific contexts according to the presence of different types of environmental pollution, should be the focus of further research. Another important point to consider is related to smoking habits, a recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis, responsible of approximately one of every four deaths from CVD, according to the 2014 Surgeon General's Report on smoking and health (CDC, 2014). Current tobacco smokers have at least a double risk of developing most significant types of CVD including AMI and HF compared to individuals who never smoked (Banks et al., 2019). Recent data suggests the interactive role between cigarette smoking and some environmental pollutions in increasing cardiovascular risk, which deserves to be considered also in the relationship between H2S and CVD (Zhang et al., 2020). Nonetheless, with the exception of the study by Nuvolone et al. (2020), which investigated acute health outcomes related to short-term exposure to H2S controlling time-invariant personal factors (age, gender, smoking, habits, body mass index), no other available study performed in geothermal areas reported the confounding effect of smoking on CVD mortality and morbidity. Diet, whose effects on CVD risk and progression are inconsistent due to the health characteristics and genetic backgrounds of populations, instead influences all the main CVD risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and cholesterol levels (Bhatnagar, 2017). Therefore, the lack of control for individual information on dietary intake can result as over or under estimate of measure of association. In particular, the diet is not only a confounder but also a modifier as well, and, moreover, the effect of smoking in CVD can vary depending on diet status (Hajian Tilaki, 2012). It should be further considered that high protein and fat content in the diet seem to increase H2S production, whereas high carbohydrate consumption has an opposite effect (Teigen et al., 2019). Therefore, dietary sulfur intake along with the abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract were considered the primary determinants of H2S production, at concentration able to affect the cardiovascular system (Teigen et al., 2019). As reported in the previous sections, many common drugs can release H2S at concentration able to affect circulating concentration of this molecule and, consequently, physiopathological pathways. Hence, this burden of biological, metabolic as well environmental and methodological determinants would be considered in the assessment of the effects of H2S on health and diseases. In this context, how these factors affect the balance between the low and high H2S bioavailability that may be alternatively related to the beneficial/adverse effects on health, and for which the exogenous contribution and endogenous production together add up for the final outcome, should be evaluated in an integrated environment-health surveillance system on the health status of communities living in geothermal areas (Table 2 )."
8,Conclusion,"H2S is believed to be related to the origin of life. Indeed, the first eukaryotic cells used H2S as an energy source while only later, in the great oxygen event, cells started using oxygen at the cost of H2S. At that time antioxidant mechanisms were put in place (Cortese-Krott et al., 2017). Recently, H2S has been rediscovered as both a beneficial regulator of various processes such as the induction of hypometabolism in small animals (Blackstone et al., 2005) and a promising therapeutic strategy in the setting of hypertension and renal ischemia (van Goor et al., 2016). Hence, the evaluation of exposure to H2S, especially in geothermal areas, is of relevant interest for its beneficial/adverse effects to cardiovascular risk. The few epidemiological studies conducted suggest only weak and even conflicting indications, in particular as regards the relationship between chronic H2S exposure and mortality for CVD. This assessment, if on the one hand is limited by the study design and the lack of adequate adjustment for confounders known to be associated with an increased risk of CVD, on the other it cannot disregard the possibility of a threshold effect. Therefore, at the endogenous levels of H2S normally produced, which have a protective effect, the exogeneous H2S, as the sum of ambient exposure, intake of drugs and dietary habits, must to be added, giving rise to possible detrimental consequences (Fig. 1). In order to perform a correct evaluation, future epidemiological studies should consider all the known individual risk factors for CVD and have reliable dispersion models for estimating individual environmental exposures both to H2S and other atmospheric pollutants. A comprehensive analysis on the association between exposure to H2S, which remains a widespread pollutant not only in geothermal districts, and CVD occurrence (also distinguishing among specific diseases), is warranted to provide further elements in the complex relationship between environment and health, as well as novel insights into the etiopathogenesis of CVD, which is currently the leading cause of premature death in the world."
