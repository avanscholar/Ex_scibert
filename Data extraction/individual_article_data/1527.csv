0,Introduction,"The current global expedition to a cleaner and greener environment has grown keen interest on the use of biodegradable plastics as alternative for non-biodegradable plastic packaging that have existing widespread use. Although non-biodegradable polymers for flexible packaging, such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE) are cheap and versatile, these are often mismanaged (60–99 million metric tonnes/year) after being consumed (Lebreton and Andrady, 2019), resulting in serious environmental hazard. One of the major obstacles in replacing current non-biodegradable plastics is the higher price of common biodegradable synthetic polymers. Amongst all, though poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is relatively cheaper (AUD 187–299/kg), yet costs significantly higher than LDPE (AUD 93–103/kg) (Sigma-Aldrich, 2020a). Earlier, several attempts were made combining PVA with different natural resources (e.g., starch, lignocellulose), to reduce overall cost of the plastic (Zhang et al., 2020). Reinforcing natural resources in PVA also helps improving biodegradability of the final material (Haque et al., 2020c). As a potential natural resource, cotton gin trash (CGT) is recently gaining high attention, particularly in composite plastic preparation (Haque et al., 2021). This is an agro-industrial natural resource produced during the separation of pure cotton fibre from seeds (Agblevor et al., 2006). The worldwide production of CGT is very high (around 32–79% per cotton bale), and CGT can often be collected at a negligible cost (Haque et al., 2021). It is a mixture of different segments of cotton plant (fibres, burrs, leaves and other plant parts) and difficult to fractionate due to the fibre entanglement. It is commonly piled around the gins for long period (fire and smoulder cases are common) and later requires expensive disposals ($110,000–130,770 per year by a large gin) (Haque et al., 2021), mostly through dumping, composting, spreading over land, etc (McIntosh et al., 2014). In recent past, several efforts were particularly made on the probable combination of CGT with PVA to produce biodegradable plastic. These include composite based on different PVA molecular weight and percentages of hydrolysis (Biswas et al., 2020), composite based on fine CGT powder (Haque et al., 2020d), and comparison of composites when prepared from both fine and coarse CGT powder (Haque et al., 2020c). However, neither of these studies reported complete flexibility of the plastics, which is required in actual use for flexible packaging (e.g., food, household, stationery). Moreover, water sensitivity of PVA remains an unanswered concern while using it in the mentioned packaging applications. A recent attempt showed some improvements in water resistance property of PVA/natural resource by inclusion of halloysite nanotube (Abdullah and Dong, 2019), though there is no report on resistance property over time. To advance CGT/PVA plastic into practically useable flexible packaging, this study aimed to answer two main unresolved concerns of complete flexibility and water resistance over time. To achieve these, two key objectives were determined for this study; (1) investigating the effect of plasticisers on the properties of CGT/PVA plastic to achieve the complete flexibility, (2) examining the impact of water-resistant coating on the properties of the flexible CGT/PVA plastic. Moreover, in line with the cleaner production principle, this study executed a clean fabrication method, limiting generation of any residue inside the process. To retain the bio-nature of the plastic, biodegradable plasticisers from different chemical groups (i.e., glycol, glycerol and urea) were selected that have proven effectiveness with cellulosic biomass (Zuo et al., 2015). As the coating, ethyl cellulose (EC) was chosen which is known for its biodegradability and water insolubility and extensively used for surface coating in the medical field (e.g., tablet binder, microcapsules) (Badulescu et al., 2010). Overall, the changes in plastic morphology, chemical structure, crystallinity, wettability and permeability, mechanical, thermal and optical properties were investigated and discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) dissolved (5% w/w) in deionised (DI) water, (viscosity 110–120 mPa.s and specific gravity 0.95–1.05) was purchased from Flew Solutions Australia Pty Ltd, Australia. The molecular weight (Mw) of the PVA was ∼100,000 and the degree of hydrolysis was 86–90% mol. Ethyl cellulose (48% ethoxyl, viscosity 22 cP), Toluene (≥99.5%, Mw = 92.14), ethanol (≥99.5%, Mw = 46.07), glycerol (≥99%, Mw = 92.09), urea (99–100.5%, Mw = 60.6) and diethylene glycol (≥99%, Mw = 106.12) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia. Commercial low-density polyethylene (LDPE) zip lock bag was purchased from Byars Flexible packaging, Australia. Cotton gin trash used in this research (composed of 26% motes, 30% burrs, 6% leaves, 8% sticks, and 30% fine particles) was from Australian origin, collected from the cotton ginning facility of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Australia."
3,CGT powder fabrication method,"2.2 CGT powder fabrication method The method for preparing CGT/PVA films followed our previous reports where CGT attrition duration and CGT/PVA mixing conditions were optimised (Haque et al., 2020c, d). The raw CGT was converted into fine powder by a two-step milling process. In the first step, cutting was conducted using a 0.2 mm sieve in a Pulverisette 19 rotary cutter mill (Fritsch GmbH, Germany) (Al Faruque et al., 2019). The obtained coarse powder was converted into fine powder by attrition for 4 h in presence of water at 280 rpm using an S/1 attritor mill (Union Process, USA). The obtained slurry was dried in a B-290 (Buchi Labortechnik AG, Switzerland) mini spray dryer at 10 ml/min flow, and 180 °C inlet and 100 °C outlet air temperature. The particle size (d(50)) of the acquired fine powder was 5.75 μm, measured in a Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser (Malvern, USA) accompanied with a Hydro 2000S dispersion unit."
4,Fabrication of composite film,"2.3 Fabrication of composite film The fine CGT powder was then mixed in water (PVA pre-dissolved) maintaining a 50/50 CGT/PVA ratio. The prepared mixture was stirred for 1 h at 80 °C to obtain a good dispersion. To investigate the plasticisers’ influence, different amount of plasticisers (2–15% of the total CGT/PVA weight) were mixed individually with the mentioned CGT/PVA solution. The solution was cast on a polystyrene dish and kept in a fume hood for drying at ambient temperature (20 °C). The final film was peeled off after 6 h. For comparison, a pure PVA film was also prepared following a similar method. To ensure complete flexibility in the composite films, folding endurance of the films was measured to confirm satisfactory flexibility; briefly, the film strips were repeatedly folded at the same position at least for 200 times or until broken (Panda et al., 2014). Following this method, the completely flexible films were achieved by adding 10% diethylene glycol (DEG), or 15% of either glycerol or urea to the CGT/PVA solution. Thus plasticised films with 10% DEG, 15% glycerol and 15% urea were considered in further investigation. These three films were also coated with ethyl cellulose (EC) using a dip-coating technique to achieve water-resistant property. Briefly, 5% w/w EC was dissolved in 80/20 toluene/ethanol solution. The films were dipped into the solution for 5 min, taken out and dried at ambient temperature (20 °C) for 30 min to obtain the final film. The thickness of all the uncoated films (PVA, CGT/PVA and CGT/PVA/plasticiser) in this study were maintained ∼80 μm, whereas the thickness of the EC coated films were ∼90 μm (measured by Accud digital caliper, China). The CGT/PVA/plasticiser films were named as CGT/PVA/DEG, CGT/PVA/GLY and CGT/PVA/Urea, where DEG, glycerol and urea were used as plasticiser, respectively. Besides, the plasticised films after EC coating were named as CGT/PVA/DEG-EC, CGT/PVA/GLY-EC and CGT/PVA/Urea-EC, respectively hereafter for the convenience in discussions. The photographs of one of the films (CGT/PVA/Urea-EC) as a representative are shown in Fig. S1."
5,Characterisations,"2.4 Characterisations 2.4.1 Morphology The morphology of CGT powder and the surface and cross-section of CGT/PVA composite films were observed by a Supra 55 VP (Zeiss, Germany) scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 5 kV accelerating voltage. All the samples were gold sputter-coated in an EM ACE600 sputter coater (Leica, Australia) before imaging. 2.4.2 Fourier-transform infrared spectra The chemical structure of the samples was investigated by Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy using a Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) from 600 to 4000 cm−1 wavenumbers at 4 cm−1 scan resolution, 32 scans per sample and maintaining an N2 atmosphere. The data were plotted after normalising from 0 to 1. 2.4.3 Crystallinity The crystallinity of the samples was measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique while the XRD patterns were acquired using an X’Pert Powder instrument (PANalytical, Netherlands) at 0.013° step size and 300 s/steps from 15° to 25° 2-theta. The peak fitting was done by using the Gaussian function in Origin (2020), where the peak around 20° was deconvoluted into one narrow (crystalline) and one broad (amorphous) peak following the method reported in previous study (Aslam et al., 2017). The crystallinity index (CI) was calculated by the following equation: C I = A c ( A c + A a ) × 100 where Ac and Aa are the area of the crystalline and amorphous peak, respectively. Three specimens of each sample were tested and average and standard deviation values were reported. 2.4.4 Wettability and permeability The moisture content of the samples was measured following ASTM D1576-13 method. Samples were preconditioned at 20 ± 2 °C temperature and 62 ± 2% relative humidity for 48 h and then dried at 110 °C inside an oven for 4 h. The moisture content (MC) of the samples was calculated using the following formula (Haque et al., 2020f): M C = W c − W d ( W c ) × 100 where W d and W c are the oven-dried weight and conditioned weight, respectively. The moisture vapour permeability (WVP) of the films was measured using a W3/031 water vapour transmission rate tester (Labthink, China) maintaining 38 °C temperature and 90% relative humidity. Both for MC and WVP measurements, three specimens of each sample were tested, and average and standard deviation values were reported. The contact angle of the water drop (diameter 4 mm) on the films was measured using a CAM101 optical tensiometer (KSV Instruments Ltd., Finland), at 1-s interval up to the time when drop completely penetrated or until 600 s. 2.4.5 Mechanical properties The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and elongation at break of the film samples were measured using a universal tensile testing system (Instron 5967, USA) equipped with a 50 N load cell. A constant rate of elongation (5 mm/min) was applied for the measurements maintaining 25 mm × 6 mm gauge length. For comparison, a commercial LDPE (sourced from a zip-lock plastic bag) was also tested using the same method. Five specimens of each sample were tested, and averages with the standard deviations were reported. 2.4.6 Thermal degradation Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of the samples was tested in a DSC Q200 (TA Instruments, USA). The samples were heated from 30 °C to 200 °C at 20 °C/min heating rate in a nitrogen atmosphere. The derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) of the samples was measured in a TGA Q50 (TA Instruments, USA) instrument. The derivative weight change (%/°C) was observed from 30 °C to 500 °C temperature maintaining 20 °C/min heating rate in a nitrogen atmosphere. 2.4.7 Optical transmittance The light transmittance of the samples was measured using a Cary 5000 UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia), from 800 nm to 200 nm wavelength. The ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of the samples was measured using Australia Standard AS/NZS 4399 in a YG902 UPF and UV penetration/projection measurement system (Fangyuan Instrument, China)."
6,Statistical analyses,"2.5 Statistical analyses The calculated probability, p was derived from performing two-tailed t-test between the datasets. The data were reported not significantly different from each other when p > 0.05, while the data were reported significantly different from each other when p ≤ 0.05."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Morphology,"3.1 Morphology The SEM images of CGT powder, surface and cross-section of the prepared films and surface after EC coating is shown in Fig. 1 . Raw CGT powder showed nearly spherical shapes probably due to the friction with the round ceramic balls during attrition stage (Haque et al., 2020c). The surface of the CGT/PVA film showed the roughest surface structure among all the films in this study. This was also further confirmed by the cross-sectional image of the CGT/PVA film where a reef-rock structure was seen with hollow caves of mixed sizes (maximum width ∼10 μm). In the cross-sectional image of DEG plasticised film, the caves’ width was seen smaller (≤4 μm) than the un-plasticised film, though the reef-rock surface still observed. This was also reflected in the surface image of CGT/PVA/DEG film where a slightly lower roughness was observed compared to CGT/PVA film. In cases of CGT/PVA/GLY and CGT/PVA/Urea, surface roughness was lower and cross-sections were observed much smoother compared to CGT/PVA/DEG. Besides, the cross-sections of these films also showed more presence of continuous areas. In between CGT/PVA/GLY and CGT/PVA/Urea, the differences in surface and cross-sectional images were very marginal. However, in cases of all three plasticised films the surface structure showed improved smoothness by EC coating. Overall, the morphologies indicated that the presence of plasticisers improved the adhesion and miscibility of CGT and PVA, resulting towards smoother surface and less vacant spaces. Besides, coating of EC also smoothed the film surface by providing the additional cover. The higher impact in glycerol and urea plasticised films was probably related to the higher amount of plasticisers (15%) present in these samples, compared to that of DEG plasticised films (10%). Similar improvement in PVA or starch-based film properties i.e., reduction of holes in cross-section (Wang et al., 2014), smoother surface (Zuo et al., 2015) by the use of glycerol, urea and glycol plasticisers are also well reported in the literature."
9,FTIR spectra,"3.2 FTIR spectra The FTIR spectra of CGT powder, PVA and all the prepared films are shown in Fig. 2 . The CGT powder showed common lignocellulose structure having typical OH peak around 3300 to 3350 cm−1 (Haque et al., 2020a). However, this OH peak was observed slightly broader in PVA and CGT/PVA due to the presence of PVA, in agreement with our previous study (Haque et al., 2020c). Due to having chemical groups in common, in most wavelengths similar spectra were observed for CGT powder, CGT/PVA and PVA films with some variations in peak intensity. The description of particular characteristic peaks can be found in our previous studies with CGT (Haque et al., 2020b), and CGT/PVA composite (Haque et al., 2020c). Most of these peaks remain identical when glycerol and DEG were incorporated as the plasticisers. This was because both glycerol and DEG also contain some common chemical groups, similar to lignocellulose and PVA structure (e.g., CH, CH2, OH, etc), as shown in Fig. S2 (Haque et al., 2018). However, in case of urea incorporated film (CGT/PVA/Urea), the amide I and amide II peaks were evident near 1650 and 1550 cm−1, respectively (Naebe et al., 2016). In cases of the EC coated films, all the samples (CGT/PVA/DEG-EC, CGT/PVA/GLY-EC and CGT/PVA/Urea-EC) showed exactly the same peaks that are similar to the FTIR spectra of EC reported in literature. These include the characteristic CH vibration peaks near 2970 and 2880 cm−1, OH stretching near 3500 cm−1, C−O−C stretching near 1050 cm−1 and CH bending near 1370 cm−1 (Suthar et al., 2000). Since the evanescent light wave in the ATR-FTIR instrument typically has a penetration depth of 0.5–3 μm (Bruker, 2011), the light wave probably did not pass through the EC layer (around 10 μm in current films), thus showed only the spectra of EC. As observed in the FTIR spectra, CGT, PVA, glycerol and glycol all have common chemical groups, such as CH2, OH. The CO group present in urea (Fig. S2) is also aligned with carbonyl groups in PVA and CGT used in this study. Besides, the amide groups are also known to produce hydrogen bonds interacting with OH groups present in both cellulose and PVA. Therefore, all the selected plasticisers in this study were chemically compatible with CGT and PVA. Since all the plasticisers used in the study were water-soluble (alike PVA), it much ensured the penetration of plasticisers in both amorphous and crystalline regions of PVA. Though CGT is not water soluble, the structure of CGT is compatible with the plasticisers. Therefore, it was likely that plasticisers occupied the intermolecular spaces inside CGT structure facilitated by their low molecular weight and interrupted the van der Waals and hydrogen bonds forces among CGT molecules, reducing the overall rigidity (Bocqué et al., 2016). Table 1 lists the chemical group contribution and calculated total molar attraction of three plasticisers. The solubility parameter (δ, MPa1/2) was calculated by using the following formula (Immergut and Mark, 1965): δ = d ∑ F M where F is the molar attraction constant (MPa1/2.cm3/mol), d is the density of the plasticiser (g/cm3) and M represents the molecular weight (g/mol). Table 1 indicates that urea is having a lower molar attraction thus possesses a greater chance of interaction and networking with CGT and PVA than the other two plasticisers. This was also supported by the higher δ calculated for urea which could act favourably towards its plasticising performance. Besides, amide groups are also known for their more polar nature compared to alcohols as amide can bond hydrogen or accept hydrogen on both sides of its structure (CO−NH) (Ophardt, 2003). Moreover, the molecular weight of urea (60.06) is much lower than DEG (106.12) and glycerol (92.09). A low molecular weight often helps plasticisers to effectively incorporate and fit inside other polymer’s chain, thus increase elongation property while reducing strength (Kim et al., 2004). However, it should be noted that even though DEG was having a higher molar attraction and lower δ, the minimum amount required for DEG to bring complete flexibility (folding endurance >200) was lower (10%) than that needed for glycerol and urea (15%). This was probably related to the more linearity in the structure of DEG compared to other two plasticisers as shown in Fig. S2. The more linear structure of a plasticiser is also favourable for reducing the hardness of a material, rather than less linear or branched structures (Immergut and Mark, 1965)."
10,Crystallinity,"3.3 Crystallinity The calculated crystallinity index (CI) of PVA and the composite films is shown in Fig. 3 a, along with a representative XRD curve fitting (CGT/PVA/DEG sample) in Fig. 3b. It was observed that the CI of CGT/PVA was around 14.7% lower than that of pure PVA. This was probably because of the significant disturbances produced in the PVA matrix by 50% of CGT incorporation (bigger caves noted in Section 3.1). Moreover, the cellulosic surfaces commonly produce a nucleating effect towards PVA crystals thus tends to produce network in the interfaces (e.g., by hydrogen bonds). This was also likely to interrupt the crystalline structure of PVA. The CI further reduced when plasticisers were added in the CGT/PVA system. For example, the inclusion of DEG, glycerol and urea reduced the CI around 17.3%, 23.3% and 26.1% compared to that of PVA. Generally, crystallinity is considered as an opposing factor of plasticising, since the plasticisers get involved inside the polymer chain and affect the molecular orientation (Immergut and Mark, 1965). As discussed in Section 3.2, all the plasticisers were likely to penetrate in both crystalline and amorphous regions of PVA, and thus the crystallinity was likely to reduce. The effect of plasticisers in reducing the crystallinity of the samples showed DEG < glycerol < urea order. This was probably related to the trend of the δ of the plasticisers (Section 3.2), where a higher δ of plasticiser produced a greater effect (i.e., reduction) on the overall crystallinity, and vice versa. However, the CI of all the films coated with EC (CGT/PVA/DEG-EC, CGT/PVA/GLY-EC, CGT/PVA/Urea-EC) was higher than the corresponding uncoated films (CGT/PVA/DEG, CGT/PVA/GLY and CGT/PVA/Urea, respectively). This was probably because of the semi-crystalline nature of ethyl cellulose which increased the overall CI of the prepared composites (Davidovich-Pinhas et al., 2014)."
11,Wettability and permeability,"3.4 Wettability and permeability The moisture content (MC) and moisture permeability (MP) of the prepared films are illustrated in Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b, respectively. The trend of both MC and MP of the samples contrasted the trend of crystallinity (Section 3.3). Water molecules are commonly obstructed by a greater orientation property of the crystalline region of a polymer, whereas can easily penetrate less oriented parts, such as amorphous region (Asem et al., 2018). Accordingly in this study, the sample having the highest crystallinity (i.e., PVA) showed the lowest MC (4.8%) and the lowest MP (1.5 × 10−12 g cm/cm2.s.Pa) than the others. Both MC and MP increased by the incorporation of CGT in PVA, probably associated with the creation of vacant areas in PVA/CGT interfaces (Section 3.1), and by a higher MC of CGT itself (>7%) (Haque et al., 2020c). Due to the presence of cotton fibre and other hydrophilic structures (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose) in CGT, it tends to absorb more moisture than PVA. Thus when used together, the absorption ability of the whole material enhanced. With the inclusion of plasticisers, both MC and MP further increased regarding the decrease in crystallinity by the plasticisers. Besides, contrasting to the increase in crystallinity by EC coating (Section 3.3), the MC and MP reduced by EC coating, compared to the corresponding uncoated samples. Fig. 5 a illustrates the contact angle of water until it penetrates the film or up to 10 min, and Fig. 5b shows the photographs of water drop after 1 min on the coated and uncoated film surfaces. The contact angle of PVA was initially higher than 90°, though came down very sharply and the drop was penetrated within 2.5 min. Water drops on all the composite samples (including EC coated films) started lower than 90° representing the improvement in hydrophilic nature compared to PVA. All the films coated with EC showed a similar pattern of water resistance (very slow decrease in the contact angle), and water drops were sitting on the surface for the whole 10 min measured in this experiment (retaining at least 65°). The presence of less polar groups (i.e., frequently replaced hydroxyl groups by ether linkage) in EC probably resulted in more resistance to water drop penetration. The carbon-oxygen-carbon linkage of ether is non-polar and water-insoluble more like an alkane (Ophardt, 2003). The lower amount of hydrogen bonding in EC limits it interaction with water, thus hinders the penetration, though not producing complete hydrophobicity due to the available OH groups. The uncoated composite samples failed to restrict the drop penetration within only 2 min (lower than PVA resistance), due to the higher absorption nature of CGT than PVA. Overall, the coating of EC on CGT/PVA film was successful in terms of achieving water resistance property to some extent that might be useful for application in everyday flexible packaging as projected in the Introduction. Besides, the hydrophilic nature of the coated films (contact angle <90°), is also likely to assist the natural degradability of the material (facilitating the operation of microorganisms), as all the components in the film (PVA, CGT, plasticisers and EC) are known biodegradable."
12,Mechanical properties,"3.5 Mechanical properties The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and elongation at break of the film samples are shown in Fig. 6 a, b and 6c, respectively. Fig. 6d demonstrates a representative of stress-strain curves of all the samples. The results of an LDPE sample were also included in Fig. 6 for comparison purpose. The tensile strength of PVA was around 38.2 MPa, in agreement with the value range reported in the literature (Biswas et al., 2020). With the inclusion of CGT without plasticisers, strength was not altered significantly. The caves and irregularity observed in the CGT/PVA film were probably counterbalanced by a higher breaking strength of cellulose in CGT (Qiu and Netravali, 2012), thus did not show a change in the overall strength. Nevertheless, the elongation at break of the CGT/PVA (2.2%) was significantly lower than that of PVA (127.2%), and modulus of the film (2479 MPa) was significantly higher than that of PVA (1088 MPa). Moreover, CGT/PVA film was not completely flexible (folding endurance <40). This was due to the lower elongation property and higher modulus of cellulose, similar to the observations in previous studies (Haque et al., 2020c). As expected, the inclusion of plasticisers, resulted in a balanced property (i.e., increase in elongation and reduction in strength and modulus), thus produced completely flexible films (folding endurance >200) of moderate tensile strength (though higher than LDPE). Overall, in the plasticised films (CGT/PVA/DEG, CGT/PVA/GLY and CGT/PVA/Urea), the tensile strength and modulus were found inversely relative to the increase of elongation in the films. In general, the plasticised films showed tensile strength around 19–24.2 MPa, elongation at break around 15.8–36.5% and modulus around 257–670 MPa, and a slight change when coated with EC (tensile strength 20.1–27.1 MPa, elongation at break 11.1–25.1% and modulus 340–1001 MPa). The coating of EC slightly reduced the elongation property while increased the strength and modulus (probably due to the inclusion of cellulosic structure, and by a higher crystallinity compared to the corresponding uncoated films), although retained the complete flexibility. Though the elongation of the produced films was not near to that of either LDPE or PVA, the flexibility achieved was quite similar, given a lower modulus than PVA, and marginally higher modulus than LDPE (213.55 MPa). Since the pure PVA film was already flexible, the achieved flexibility in the composites could be attributed mostly to the probable interactions of the plasticisers towards CGT, rather than PVA. The lower molecular weight of the plasticisers allowed occupying the intermolecular spaces of CGT. As mentioned in Section 3.2, this probably led to the reduction of different secondary forces occurring inside CGT structure such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force. Thus the essential energy for molecular motion in CGT structure might have decreased (Bocqué et al., 2016), resulting in an enhanced chain mobility and flexibility. In terms of individual plasticiser’s performance, films produced with DEG were higher in tensile strength (24.2 MPa), though lower in modulus (670 MPa) and elongation at break (15.8%), whereas films with urea and glycerol showed nearly identical strength (19–20.1 MPa), and a higher plasticising effect (elongation at break 33.3–36.5%, modulus 257–340 MPa) than DEG. This was also confirmed by testing a DEG plasticised film with 15% amount to set apart the difference in the amounts used (obtained results; tensile strength 21.5 MPa, elongation at break 20.4%, modulus 498 MPa, not shown in Fig. 6). The greater effect of urea and glycerol than DEG was probably related to the lower molecular weight and higher δ of these two plasticisers compared to DEG, which eventually assisted in a better penetration inside both CGT and PVA structure. Aside the definite impact of plasticisers, CGT as a reinforcement material might also have some influences on the mechanical properties. Most of the earlier reported reinforcing materials used in PVA composites were used in purified structure e.g., microcrystalline cellulose (Rahman et al., 2014), microfibrillated cellulose (Qiu and Netravali, 2012). However, CGT used in this study was in its raw form providing partial presence of cellulose together with non-crystalline structures (e.g., hemicellulose). Thus CGT possesses low crystallinity value (18–30%) (Haque et al., 2021), which could have been affected towards a lower modulus. Moreover, using CGT in its raw form allows a greater utilisation of the waste biomass and restricts any further residue generation in the production stage, making the process cleaner. Besides, by the use of a reasonable amount of reinforcement, i.e., 50%, overall cost of the composite reduces and the biocompatibility enhances."
13,Thermal degradation,"3.6 Thermal degradation The DSC and DTG curves of the fabricated film samples are illustrated in Fig. 7 a and b, respectively. The peak for glass transition (Tg) and melting (Tm) of PVA were observed around 45 °C and 190 °C, whereas the DSC curve of CGT showed no Tg peak rather than a broad endotherm peak around 40–140 °C, related to the evaporation of water (Haque et al., 2020e). In CGT/PVA film, though the Tg peak was seen near 40 °C, the Tm peak was not observed. In CGT/PVA/plasticiser films (either coated or not coated), no clear evidence of either Tg or Tm was found. These indicate that the adhesion in CGT/PVA was well enough to restrict PVA from melting up to 200 °C, while the adhesion further increased by plasticiser incorporation which restricted both glass transition and melting of PVA. Commonly, Tg and Tm are associated with the flexibility of polymeric segments (Liu et al., 2013). Though in Section 3.3 we observed that the inclusion of plasticiser reduced the PVA crystallinity which was likely to enhance the mobility of both CGT and PVA structure, the DSC spectra of composites indicate that the mobility of PVA might have been restricted by its chemical interaction with CGT. It was probable that due to the nucleating effect of cellulosic structure towards PVA crystals, and by the use of 50% reinforcement, more cross-linking points were generated and disruption occurred in the regular arrangement of PVA molecules (Castro et al., 2014). Overall, the PVA chain probably became highly confined with strong interactions such as hydrogen bonding (Liu et al., 2013), thus transformed into a supramolecular structure, resulting in narrow movement of the macromolecules even at a higher temperature. The DTG curves showed four major phases of weight loss (%) that are listed in Table 2 . The first phase was around 40–140 °C, related to the loss of moisture (Haque et al., 2020c). In the second phase (around 140–240 °C), though PVA or CGT/PVA films did not show significant weight loss, all the samples containing plasticisers (coated and uncoated) showed peaks. In case of DEG plasticised films, the peaks were distributed around 140–200 °C, which could be related to the reduction of mass due to volatile release from DEG (flash point 138 °C) (Sigma-Aldrich, 2020b). Besides, the peaks observed in glycerol and urea plasticised films were probably associated with the degradation of glycerol at around 200–240 °C, and decomposition of urea at around 195 °C, respectively (Ghahri et al., 2018). The third phase was responsible for the loss of most of the weight, roughly occurred around 240–390 °C. This stage of degradation in CGT powder was related to the decomposition of hemicellulose and lignin followed by cellulose (Cai et al., 2019). The degradation temperature of pure PVA was also found similar to previous reports. The rate of weight loss in the third phase was found lower for all the plasticised composites, particularly for those prepared with glycerol and urea, compared to PVA, CGT/PVA and CGT powder. This could be related to the good adhesion property of glycerol and urea plasticised films (Section 3.1), and possibly better chemical cross-linking, restricted the overall degradation rate. The final stage of degradation held roughly around 390–500 °C. The PVA sample showed weight loss during this whole period probably due to the degradation of the PVA backbone (Haque et al., 2020c). The degradation in CGT powder in this phase was probably due to the continuous decomposition of lignin (Cagnon et al., 2009). The loss of weight in the films containing CGT was lower than PVA weight loss in this stage, probably affected by the lower amount of PVA present (50/50 CGT/PVA ratio), and probable chemical cross-linking by plasticisers in both crystalline and amorphous structure of PVA. The ultimate residue amount at 500 °C was higher in glycerol and urea plasticised films (Table 3 ), rather than the CGT/PVA and DEG plasticised films, also indicated the probable influence of the plasticisers’ chemical structure that might have resulted in a better thermal stability."
14,Optical transmittance,"3.7 Optical transmittance Fig. 8 represents the optical transmittance of the prepared films and the ultraviolet protection factors (UPF). The PVA film transmitted more than 97% light throughout the visible light region (380–700 nm). The LDPE sample was also tested (though not shown in Fig. 8) for transmittance and showed lower transmittance property than PVA in visible region (84–89%). All the CGT/PVA composite films were brown in colour (showed bands near 680 nm). This was due to the presence of lignin in CGT containing number of chromophore groups, e.g., syringyl (red-purple), guaiacyl (yellow-brown), free and etherified hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings (Zhang and Naebe, 2021). All the composite films showed identical partial light transmittance with no significant impact observed from plasticisers and/or EC coating. In the UV region (<380 nm), PVA film showed light transmittance, and a band at around 275 nm related to the transition of electrons in the PVA, conjugated systems described in the previous study (Haque et al., 2020c). The LDPE sample showed more than 70% transmittance in majority of the UV region. However, all the composite films showed almost complete UV protection, i.e., light transmittance was around 0–0.96% for CGT/PVA film, and was around 0–0.04% for all the plasticised films). The plasticised films showed slightly higher protection, probably due to the reduction of gaps in CGT/PVA interfaces (Section 3.1). Generally, the electron jumps in the orbitals related to π→π∗ or from non-bonding orbitals to either σ∗ or π∗ orbitals can absorb wavelength from 200 to 800 nm (Förster, 2004). Lignin contains lone pair electrons originated from its oxygen atoms, has the required bonds in the aromatic ring, which assist the mentioned electron jumps. Thus the lignin present in CGT was able to absorb UV light and showed almost zero transmittance in UV region. However, there was no significant difference observed in the UPF values observed among all the composite films. Generally, a UPF more than 50 is rated as “excellent” (Gies et al., 1998), whereas all the composite films showed UPF around 219–229, significantly higher than PVA (1.2)."
15,Cost estimation,"The approximate cost for the production of CGT/PVA composite films (Table 3) was calculated assuming 0.23 AUD/kWh current average electricity cost in Victoria, Australia (Canstar Blue, 2020). The estimated cost per gram film production was around 0.17–0.21 AUD, inside which electricity cost was a minor proportion (AUD 0.02), and chemicals’ cost was the rest. However, it should be noted that the actual electricity cost is likely to be lower than the estimation. This is because; we have considered the maximum power of the machines for calculation, although the machines did not consume maximum power, i.e., did not run at highest capacity (maximum temperature and maximum rotating speed). Moreover, the cost of the chemicals is also likely to be much lower than the estimated price, since chemicals can often be purchased at a significantly lower price when purchased in bulk."
16,Conclusions,"In this study, water-resistant CGT/PVA bio-plastic was proposed as an alternative for non-biodegradable plastics for flexible packaging application (e.g., food, stationary, household). The influence of plasticisers including DEG, glycerol and urea and the effect of EC as a coating was investigated. The solubility parameter, molecular weight and linearity of plasticisers’ chemical structure showed combined impact on the plasticisation. Complete flexibility (folding endurance > 200) was achieved using 10% DEG or 15% of either glycerol or urea. Among the plasticisers, urea showed the maximum impact achieving modulus (257 MPa) closer to that of LDPE (213.5 MPa), yet much higher tensile strength (19–20.5 MPa, compared to 13.4 MPa of LDPE). The crystallinity of PVA was reduced by 17–26% due to plasticisers, though change was minimal in EC coated films (2–10%). By contrast, moisture absorption (42–57%) and permeability (45–56%) of PVA increased by adding plasticiser, while presence of EC negatively affected this increase. Essentially, after EC coating, the films became resistant to water drop at least for 10 min retaining minimum 65° contact angle. The films were semi-transparent and the protection towards UV was excellent, showing UPF of around 219–229. The overall cost (electricity and chemical) for this lab-scale production was around AUD 202–208/kg film, inside which electricity cost was about AUD 16.6/kg film. Overall, an important opportunity of using CGT/PVA composite is explored for consuming in everyday life. In the future study and to achieve better compatibility in industrial scale production fabricating CGT/PVA composite will be examined by adopting extrusion technology."
