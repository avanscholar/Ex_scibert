0,Introduction,"Cellulose comprises a carbohydrate monomer (glucose) linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Chemocatalytic cleavage of its C–O and C–C bonds to polyols by hydrolytic hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis in a mild aqueous medium has attracted intensive scrutiny due to the abundance of cellulose (35–50% in biomass) and the wide variety of possible applications of polyols as value-added chemicals and fuels [1–3]. In particular, sorbitol is regarded as one of the 12 important platform compounds in biomass conversion programs [4]. Additionally, 1,2-alkanediols such as ethylene glycol (EG) and 1,2-propylene glycol (1,2-PG) are used as energy platforms for the production of hydrogen and liquid alkane fuels via the aqueous reforming process or as monomers for polymerization synthesis [5–7]. The conversion of cellulose to polyols includes two consecutive reaction steps: acidic hydrolysis of cellulose to sugars and the subsequent hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis of the intermediate sugars to polyols over a supported transition metal catalyst under H2 pressure at 4.0–12.0 MPa [8]. Each individual catalytic conversion step has been intensively studied for the efficient synthesis of sugar alcohols from mono- and polysaccharides [3,9]. Recently, one-step catalytic approaches for the conversion of cellulose to polyols have become a focal point [10]. Acid-catalytic hydrolysis, combined with in situ hydrolytic hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis in the same reactor, has a synergic effect due to the fast removal of unstable intermediates of cello-oligosaccharides and sugars, which reduces the side reactions [11]. When cellulose hydrolysis is coupled with glucose hydrogenation over a supported metal catalyst or with sugar hydrogenolysis over a tungsten-based catalyst, hexitol or 1,2-alkanediol (EG and 1,2-PG), respectively, will be the main product [12]. Heterogeneous catalysts, group VIII metals supported on functional materials such as active carbon (AC) and mesoporous silica, were found to be efficient for the sustainable production of polyols in the one-pot conversion of cellulose [13]. Although some publications deal with cellulose conversion, most focus on individual conversion steps, especially for glucose and fructose and their derivatives (e.g. furfural) using corrosive mineral acids [14]. This review concentrates mainly on recent progress in one-pot aqueous hydrolytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of cellulose to polyols, including sorbitol, mannitol, isosorbide, EG, and 1,2-PG. Particular emphasis is placed on heterogeneous catalysts, H+ sources for cellulose hydrolysis, the effect of functional support materials, and non-noble metals for in situ hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis, and their interactions under mild reaction conditions, for the one-pot conversion of cellulose and its utilization."
1,Cellulose to sorbitol and mannitol via hydrolytic hydrogenation,"Sorbitol and mannitol, and their dehydration product sorbitan, are important precursors of renewable chemicals and fuels. Sorbitol is traditionally produced via the two-step chemocatalytic process described above. Mannitol is produced along with sorbitol through the epimerization of glucose to mannose [15,16]. The use of dilute or concentrated H2SO4 or HCl as the H+ source and the low efficiency of individual steps encouraged studies on the one-pot conversion of cellulose into hexitols through hexose intermediates (reducing sugars) over a homo- or heterogeneous catalyst, as shown in Fig. 1 [17]. There are contradictory assumptions about the cleavage of glycosidic bonds (C–O–C) in cellobiose, traditionally used as the model compound for cellulose. One is the direct hydrolysis of cellubiose to glucose. The other is the hydrogenation of C–O bond on one of the glucose rings in the molecules of cellubiose, leading to the formation of cellobitol, which is further hydrolyzed to sorbitol and glucose [18]. Various reaction parameters such as temperature and the catalyst as well as the method of producing H+ appear to affect these contradictory assumptions [19]. Here, the rate-determining step is the H+-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycoside bonds to glucose via water-soluble oligosaccharides [11]. Depending the method used to introduce the acidic functional groups via H+, catalysts for the one-pot hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose to hexitols can be categorized into two types: soluble acid/metal catalysts and in situ-generated H+/metal catalysts."
2,Soluble acid/metal catalysts,"2.1 Soluble acid/metal catalysts Early research always used a homogeneous acid in combination with hydrogenation catalysts such as supported noble metals (Ru, Pt, and Pd). The supports have included carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and zeolites [20–22]. Until recently, much work focused on soluble mineral acids such as H2SO4, H3PO4, and HCl combined with supported Ru catalysts, and some recent advances are listed in Table 1 [23,24]. New ideas such as the formation of Ru particles with special morphology on functional supports, decreasing the cellulose crystallinity to enhance its susceptibility, and the introduction of soluble heteropoly acids (HPAs), under hydrothermal conditions, have initiated further developments of the traditional one-pot conversion process. Some of these recent advances are listed in Table 1 [25]. The use of Ru nanoparticles, prepared by reduction in the presence of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP), leads to efficient hydrogenation in acidic water (pH = 2.0) [26]. A high hexitol yield of 86% (63% sorbitol and mannitol) from ball-milled cellulose (BMC) was obtained over Ru (0.2 wt%)/H-USY with a low concentration of HCl (35 ppm, pH = 3.0) in water after 24 h at 190 °C. The advantages of this process were proposed as being that (1) the water-soluble oligosaccharides, derived primarily from the hydrolysis of BMC by dilute HCl, are further depolymerized to glucose by the acid sites on the external surface of H-USY and (2) the intrazeolitic Ru quickly hydrogenates the glucose adsorbed in the zeolite pore channels, which decreases the diffusion path of glucose. This process also decreases the amount of Ru necessary for hydrogenation, and side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are suppressed. The recyclable and water-soluble properties of HPAs were used in the one-pot cellulose conversion process, conferring these major advantages [30]. Although homogeneous HPAs are more expensive than traditional mineral acids, the required amounts of phosphotungstic (H3PW) and silicotungstic acid (H4SiW) for efficient cellulose hydrolysis are usually low [31]. A yield of 80.6% C4–C6 polyols was obtained over H4SiW–Ru/C after 7 h at 160 °C and 5.0 MPa when α-cellulose was the feedstock, which reduced to 65% when spruce was used [17]. A hexitol yield of 92% could be obtained in 20 min at 190 °C and 5.0 MPa, even when a high mass fraction of 10% BMC in water was used, corresponding to a productivity of 279 g of hexitol per liter of the liquid phase in 1 h [28]. The system can also convert highly concentrated BMC, up to a mass fraction of 20%. A sorbitol selectivity of 70.3% with a cellulose conversion of 63.7% was achieved in 24 h at 160 °C and 5 MPa H2, due to the hydrogenation sites of Ru and both Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites for hydrolysis over H3PW–Ru in the ionic liquid [bmim]PF6 [32]. The recovery and separation of these HPA catalysts remains challenging [33]. Ether extraction is effective, but rather cumbersome with a recovery as low as 50%. Alternatively, partly neutralizing HPAs with cesium can significantly increase the recovery of HPAs due to the low solubility of CsHPAs (namely Cs x H3–x PW12O40 and Cs x H4–x SiW12O40) [34]. A 90% yield of hexitols from BMC over Cs3.5H0.5SiW12O40–Ru/C [27] has been reported. However, the yield of sorbitol was decreased to 43% at 160 °C over Cs3PW12O40–Ru/C when the H+ sites in HPAs were completely replaced by Cs+, due to the insolubility of Cs3PW12O40 [35]."
3,In situ-produced H+/metal catalysts,"2.2 In situ-produced H+/metal catalysts Due to the disadvantages of corrosion and recovery related to soluble mineral acids and HPAs/CsHPAs, some pollution-free approaches such as bifunctional heterogeneous catalysis for H+ formation in hot compressed water were investigated. However, the insolubility of cellulose and the limited accessibility of the active sites of heterogeneous catalysts inhibit the polymeric biomolecules of cellulose from penetrating to the metal sites, decreasing efficiency in many cases. Many methods have been tested in an attempt to overcome this disadvantage, including pre-impregnation or ball milling of cellulose with mineral or solid acids, adding functional groups to the support materials to reshape active sites to increase the interaction between the substrate and the catalytic centers, and H2 heterolytic dissociation and/or hydride transfer, as listed in Table 2 . In this section, the catalysts used are reviewed according to the method for the generation of in situ H+ and the metals used for hydrogenation [11,36]. The effects of the acidic groups on the support and the use of non-noble metals are extensively discussed. 2.2.1 Acidic supports and H+ generated by H2 dissociation and spillover in hot water Inorganic materials, including silica, titania, alumina, H-zeolite, Nafion, and Amberlyst, and microporous carbon, have been reported as acidic supports for metal loading for catalyst preparation in cellulose conversion, after pretreatment or no pretreatment with mineral acids [38]. Here, heterolytic H2 dissociation occurs on the Ru or Pt metal centers, and the spillover of the dissociated H species on the surface of acidic supports provides the necessary acidic sites for hydrolysis in hot water. Thus, the activity of hydrolytic hydrogenation depends on the acid functional groups and metal hydrogenation centers [54]. In 2006, Fukuoka and Dhepe first reported the conversion of cellulose to hexitols over Pt/γ-Al2O3 at 190 °C with sorbitol and mannitol yields of 25% and 6%, respectively, after 24 h, in the absence of any mineral acid addition [39]. An increased H+ pool formed by hydrogen spillover from Ru to γ-Al2O3 is responsible for the cellulose hydrolysis. Acidic BEA zeolite-supported Ir catalyst showed a high selectivity to sorbitol due to its special d-band width among the other noble metals tested (Pd, Rh, and Ru) [55]. The combination effect of Brønsted acids, deriving from the acidic zeolite and [Ru(H2O)5OH]2 + by Ru species over Ru/BEA, is another reason for the high hexitol yield [40]. The close contact between acidic groups and metal sites was found to be important for the enhanced sorbitol yield [38]. The solid acid of mesoporous niobium phosphate and sulfonated activated carbon-supported Ru nanoparticle catalysts exhibited a high sorbitol yield in neutral aqueous medium [56,57]. Sulfonic acid-functionalized Ru/SiO2–SO3H catalyst showed a 61.2% yield of sorbitol after 10 h at 150 °C due to the presence of both Brønsted acidic sites and metal sites. A series of studies showed that those Ru/CNT catalysts with larger Ru nanoparticles (>8.7 nm) resulted in a higher concentration of adsorbed H species on CNTs. A yield of 40% for hexitols (including 36% sorbitol) was achieved at 185 °C for 24 h. Inorganic acid (or base)-impregnated supports have been found to provide Brønsted acidic sites, which improves sorbitol formation. The sorbitol yield was only 26% when CNTs were pretreated with concentrated HCl (37%), which rose from 56% to 87% when CNTs was pretreated with HNO3 from 5 wt% to 68 wt% [42]. However, the residual Cl species on the surface of Pt/C and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts caused C–C and C–O cleavage reactions, which produced more C2–C3 polyols [43]. Inorganic acid (or base) impregnation of cellulose decreased its crystallinity, which increased the yield of soluble oligosaccharides in water for rapid hydrolysis [58]. The sorbitol yield increased to 69% and the hexitol yield was 94% when cellulose was pre-impregnated with H3PO4 and H2SO4, respectively [58]. The acid impregnation of ball-milling biomass substrates such as sugar cane bagasse and wood shavings also gave a high C5–C6 polyol yield, even under much more severe conditions, and the accumulation of recalcitrant cellulosic residues was reduced [59]. A mechanocatalytic approach, grinding cellulose with acidic solid materials such as delaminated kaolinite, has been reported, with 84% cellulose conversion after 3 h [60]. Mixed-ball milling of cellulose and solid acids (HZSM-5, H-Beta, HMOR) enhanced their interaction, which resulted in rapid cellulose depolymerization that was 12 times faster than single-ball milling [61]. The hexitol yield reached 85.5% after mixed-ball milling with amorphous zirconium phosphate combined with 5 wt% Ru/C [62]. In addition to the introduction of acid via functional supports and the acidic impregnation of cellulose, H+ generated in situ in hot water at 245 °C was first reported by Luo for the conversion of cellulose to hexitols, together with Ru/C for hydrogenation [37]. The hexitol yield was 39.3%, including 30% sorbitol and 10% mannitol. Furthermore, the introduction of a trace amount of mineral acid in hot compressed water could significantly improve the hydrolysis rate of cellulose and selectivity for hexitols. H+ generated from hot compressed water/alcohol was also reported for the hydrolysis of cellulose to sugars [63]. This in situ generation of acid is reversible, and occurs spontaneously at ambient temperatures, relieving concerns about acid recovery and waste disposal. It would seem to meet the green criteria of the modern refinery industry. 2.2.2 Internal H2 source through the transfer hydrogenation from lower alcohols or via aqueous phase reforming H2 used for hydrogenation is usually added externally at 3–12 MPa. However, kinetic studies have demonstrated that high yields of hexitols from BMC can be obtained even under a low H2 pressure of 0.7–0.8 MPa over highly dispersed Ru/C [64]. According to this finding, the internal H2 produced through transfer hydrogenation reactions with 2-propanol (15%, 20 mmol) in a solvent provides the H2 source for hydrogenation, and the yields of sorbitol and mannitol were 37% and 9.0%, respectively, over a carbon-supported Ru catalyst (Ru/C–Q10) at 190 °C [45]. In the follow-up studies, a hexitol yield of 85% was obtained in less than 1 h in a batch reactor by the transfer hydrogenation of cellulose oligomers, produced by milling of the acidulated microcrystalline cellulose [65]. Cationic Ru species were the active sites for the transfer hydrogenation reaction [66]. Three successive steps occurred: cellulose hydrolysis, lower alcohol or acid decomposition, and glucose hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 2 . 2-Propanol was first dehydrogenated to acetone and H2. The latter promoted fast cellulose hydrolysis and sugar hydrogenation to sorbitol and mannitol. The direct transfer of hydride species from 2-propanol to glucose occurred through the dihydride mechanism, confirmed by the deuterium labeling method. It was interesting that the formation of molecular hydrogen from 2-propanol dehydrogenation was found to be a side reaction, with little influence on the glucose hydrogenation step. Cationic Ru species can also catalyze the aqueous phase reforming of formic acid, and in situ-produced H2 was further used for the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol and glycerol [45]. Additionally, 2-propanol used for internal H2 generation can be obtained from cellulose over the catalyst with a CuCr2O4 active phase at 200–270 °C in water [67]. That temperature is also suitable for the conversion of cellulose to polyols, resulting in the synergetic combination of reactions and increasing the green and renewable characteristics of this cellulose conversion process. 2.2.3 Ni catalysts Although the bifunctional supported-noble catalysts showed promising results, the use of noble metals inhibits their application in large-scale processes for the hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose. Recently, cheap nickel catalysts, supported on a variety of functional materials (Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, AC, ZnO, ZrO2, MgO, etc.), have been evaluated for the conversion of cellulose to hexitols [68]. The presence of the support, the Ni loading state, and the Ni(111) plane were demonstrated, all of which drastically affected the catalytic activity and the product distribution. The existence of a rich Ni(111) crystal phase over 17% Ni/ZSM-5 was the main reason for the 91.2% selectivity of hexitols, which was more active for hexitol formation during glucose hydrogenation [47]. A nickel phosphide catalyst (16% Ni2P/AC) gave a 48% yield of sorbitol under 225 °C and 6 MPa H2, resulting from the acidity of excess phosphide and nickel-catalyzed hydrogenation [48]. The phase change of Ni2P from the crystalline phase to the amorphous phase correlated to a high selectivity for sorbitol, where the ratio of sorbitol to mannitol was as high as 13.8 [49]. To increase the accessibility of Ni particles, carbon nanofiber (CNF)-supported Ni (Ni/CNFs) was prepared with reshaped Ni particles at the tip of the CNFs. Rapid hydrogenation of the released intermediate glucose could occur due to the entanglement of petaloid-like CNFs around the water-insoluble oligosaccharide matrixes. Ni/CNFs resulted in a 56.5% yield of sugar alcohols from BMC [69]. Ni/CNF (7.5 wt%), prepared by the chemical vapor deposition of CH4 on a Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and subsequent oxidation by HNO3, led to a 76% yield of hexitols with 69% sorbitol selectivity [50]. Such good results were assumed to derive from the correct balance of acidic surface-oxygen groups for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and Ni dispersion for hydrogenation. Other non-noble transition metals such as Co, Fe, and Mo, supported on CNFs, were also studied for polysaccharide conversion to C4–C6 polyols [70]. The results suggested that some cheap metal-based catalysts were comparable to noble Ru ones for cellulose conversion under similar conditions, and of a potential significance for research and utilization. The main disadvantage of Ni-based catalysts relates to their sintering. Increasing the amount of Ni loading, up to 70% on carbon, is a useful method for inhibiting sintering due to surface coverage by Ni oxide species with larger Ni crystalline particles [51]. In addition, the catalyst can easily be separated by the magnet method after the cellulose conversion reaction. 2.2.4 Bimetals Compared with Ru catalysts, monometallic Ni-based catalysts usually gave poor hexitol yields due to their subsequent hydrogenolysis into C2–C3 polyols. Also, deactivation of the Ni catalysts was rapid in hot compressed water above 230 °C – a temperature essential for the fast depolymerization of cellulose. To solve this problem, a series of Ni-based bimetallic catalysts (Rh–Ni, Ir–Ni, Pt–Ni, Pd–Ni, and Ru–Ni), supported on mesoporous carbon (MC), were prepared [71]. Rh–Ni/MC gave a hexitol yield of 59.8% in coupling cellulose hydrolysis, through activation by the MC structure, and the in situ hydrogenation of oligosaccharides over highly dispersed bimetallic particles on the unique three-dimensional open structure of MC [52]. Noble metal (Ru, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ir)-modified Ni/HZSM-5, which changed the surface electrical and chemical properties of Ni particles, also showed high activity for hydrolytic hydrogenation, but was inactive for hydrogenolysis to EG and 1,2-PG. The best hexitol yield of 76.9% was obtained over PtNi/ZSM-5, and the yield remained at more than 55% after the catalyst was reused four times, which resulted from the formation and the stability of a special structure of PtNi nanoparticles with a Pt-enriched alloy surface in hot water [72]. A high hexitol selectivity of 82.7% was reported at an Sn/Pt ratio of 0.5, nearly twice that of Pt/Al2O3 at a similar cellulose conversion (∼20%) [53]. Electron transfer from SnO x species to Pt at lower Sn/Pt ratios of 0.1–1.0 was proposed as the explanation for the superior hydrogenation of SnO x -modified Pt/A2O3 catalysts (Pt–SnO x /Al2O3). Also, SnO x , as a Lewis acid, improved the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (e.g. citral, crotonaldehyde, and carvone) via its close interaction with carbonyl groups. When Pt was replaced by Ni, Pt–SnO x /Al2O3 showed high selectivity for acetol at an Ni/Sn ratio of 0.5 [73]. Increasing the selectivity for sorbitol to simplify the subsequent refining step for its production is an essential and unresolved issue that is attracting much interest in heterogeneous catalyst design, balanced multi-reaction pathways and reaction condition tuning. The use of high H2 pressure and catalysts with moderate acidity and high metal loading have been proved to be efficient means to inhibit the subsequent hydrogenolysis of intermediate glucose to EG. However, few studies report on the issue of how to constrain glucose isomerization and hydrogenation to mannitol. The best result, with a ratio of sorbitol to mannitol of 13.8, has been reported over Ni2.6P–AC [49]. The difficulty of constraining glucose isomerization remains an obstacle to the high yield of sorbitol."
4,Cellulose to isosorbide by hydrolytic hydrogenation and dehydration,"Further conversion of isosorbide could lead to a variety of monomers for the production of biodegradable polymeric materials because of its high stability and two functional hydroxyl groups [10,41]. Isosorbide is traditionally produced by sorbitol dehydration over a strong acid catalyst. Very recently, one-pot isosorbide production has attracted significant attention, with the development of cellulose chemistry, which has included sequential reaction steps of cellulose hydrolysis to glucose, glucose hydrogenation to sorbitol, and twofold dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide via sorbitan. The reaction pathway is shown in Fig. 3 . Each individual conversion step from cellulose to isosorbide has been previously studied, with a considerable yield [8,75]. However, the overall yield from the one-pot conversion of cellulose is relatively low, due to the co-production of other hexitols such as sorbitol and mannitol. A maximum isosorbide yield of 49.5%, with a total C6 polyol yield of 61.9%, was obtained after 0.5 h at 215 °C, 6.0 MPa H2 and 0.10 M HCl over Ru/C [74]. Dilute HCl was more effective than H2SO4, in combination with Ru/C, by balancing the fast acid hydrolysis of cellulose and the subsequent hydrogenation of glucose and dehydration. A 63% yield of isosorbide from delignified wheat straw pulp has been reported over H4SiW and Ru/C after 1 h in a one-pot conversion reaction, which is higher than that over Ru/C with HCl [33,74]. To increase the exceptional high selectivity for isosorbide, the design of the catalysts and the catalytic process is important. Using molten metal chloride hydrate media, such as CuCl2 and NiCl2, resulted in the increased formation of isosorbide from cellulose [76]. A 56.7% isosorbide yield was obtained over nano-Ru supported on mesoporous niobium phosphate (Ru@mNbPO) [77]. The strong acidity, good hydrothermal stability, and mesoporous structure of the mNbPO support facilitated the hydrolysis of polymeric cellulose to glucose and the dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide [78]. This effective Ru@mNbPO catalyst avoids the use of mineral acids and exhibited excellent cycling stability without collapse of the mesoporous structure and leaching of Ru."
5,Cellulose to EG via hydrolytic hydrogenolysis,"EG and 1,2-PG are widely used as monomers in the esterification and etherification synthesis of unsaturated polyester resins, polyethers, and polyurethanes [79]. EG is especially consumed above about 20 Mt/a in the petroleum industry [6,80]. In view of the importance of EG, its production from sustainable cellulose is critical. Compared with the hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose to hexitols, hydrolytic hydrogenolysis of cellulose to EG also involves the depolymerization of the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds of cellulosic biomass. However, a higher temperature was essential for the subsequent cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds in the intermediate products (sugars) [81,82]. In addition to noble metals being used for hydrogenolysis, non-noble metals, such as Ni, W, and Cu, have also been reported for cellulose or polyhydroxy compound conversion to EG, including starch and fructan [83]: acceptable turnover rates, low cost, and similar performance to the noble metals were obtained [84–86]. Table 3 summarizes typical results for the one-pot conversion of cellulose to diols of EG and 1,2-PG. It can be concluded that almost all reports of high yields for 1,2-alkanediols used W-based catalysts, including metallic states, carbides, nitrides, oxides or phosphides. The good performance is due to the bifunctional role of W in accelerating cellulose hydrolysis and C–C bond cleavage [87]. A small amount of Ni modification, in combination with a functional support such as AC, MC, or SBA-15, is essential for diol selectivity [88]. The phase states of W and the reaction pathway are as described below in Fig. 4 [89]. Water-soluble H x WO3, formed under hydrothermal reaction conditions, is the active species for the C–C bond cleavage of sugar intermediate sugars such as glucose. The adjacent α-OH to the carbonyl group in the sugars undergoes C–C bond cleavage. After that, there is a complex rearrangement of the C–C bonds in the sugars, involving the carbonyl oxygen atom and three hydroxylic oxygen atoms in the α-, β-, and γ-OH groups, to form the corresponding EG or 1,2-PG. EG and 1,2-PG are assumed to form preferentially from their corresponding precursors of glucose and fructose, respectively. Support materials such as AC were proven to accelerate the isomerization of glucose into fructose by their surface basicity and acidity. However, the EG yield is usually higher than that of 1,2-PG due to the higher selectivity of glucose compared with fructose during the primary hydrolysis of cellulose in most cases. Also, hexitols such as sorbitol and mannitol can also be formed as a result of intermediate sugar hydrogenation over a metal catalyst, which decreases the efficiency of the hydrogenolysis reaction. Detailed studies on the underlying reaction mechanism are in progress [101]. The discussion below classifies the phases of W in the catalysts for EG and 1,2-PG production, especially for the high yield of EG. The basic state of the catalyst support and the solution is also reviewed."
6,Ni–W2C,"4.1 Ni–W2C The original use of W2C by Ji et al. opened up the application of non-noble metal catalysts for the one-pot hydrogenolysis of cellulose to EG in 2008, which gave a 27% yield over W2C/AC [90]. The yield of polyols, especially EG, increased to 61% after 0.5 h at 245 °C and 6 MPa H2, with a total cellulose conversion when 2 wt% nickel was added to W2C/AC. These Ni–W2C/AC catalysts showed a remarkable selectivity for EG compared with Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/C [102]. The promotion effect of Ni on W2C for the increase in EG and other diols is due to the close contact of Ni with the support and electron transfer from Ni to W species. This has a synergistic effect on the reduction of W and the activating adsorption of H2, which accelerates the selective cleavage of C–C and C–O bands in the intermediate sugars [103]. W2C could also be formed at lower temperatures during Ni–W2C/AC preparation. The re-dispersion of W and Ni species in the aqueous solution during a post-impregnation method resulted in highly dispersed Ni over W2C/AC, which gave a 73.0% yield of EG with 100% cellulose conversion [91]. Surface studies showed that EG could quickly release into aqueous solution due to the weak interaction between EG and the Ni–W2C/AC surface, which decreased the side reactions [104]. When this cheap Ni–W2C/AC catalyst was applied to the one-pot conversion of biomass to diols, its performance differed, depending on the source of biomass. The main product was 1,2-PG, with a 38.5% yield for Jerusalem artichoke tuber [92]. The co-existence of lignin hampered cellulose depolymerization to EG when corn stalk was used [105]. However, hemicellulose could be directly converted to EG. After retreatment of corn stalk with NaOH, H2O2, and ammonia, the diol yield increased to 48%. A total diol yield of 75.6% (based on the carbohydrate fraction, cellulose and hemicellulose) and a monophenol yield of 46.5% (based on lignin) were reported over 4% Ni–30% W2C/AC for ashtree conversion [106]. This biomass degradation method exhibited competitive activity in aqueous medium without any acid or base addition. Furthermore, it was also highly atom economic because most carbon atoms and hydroxyl groups in the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin fraction of biomass were conserved in the corresponding products. Instead of traditional AC as the support, three-dimensional MC-supported W2C catalyst was reported to provide nanoparticles for EG production from cellulose [107]. Without Ni promotion, W2C/MC gave an EG yield of 72.9% [93]. An EG yield of 75.4% was also reported over mesoporous silica (SBA-15)-supported Ni–W catalyst in an aqueous solution. Easy accessibility for cellulose diffusion in the mesoporous channels is the main reason for the increase in the diol yield over such mesoporous-material-supported W2C catalysts. However, the recycling test for Ni–W/SBA-15 showed less stability than traditional Ni/W/SiO2–Al2O3 (Al/(Al + Si) = 0.6) for the conversion of cellulose to diols [94]."
7,H2WO4 and WO3,"4.2 H2WO4 and WO3 Due to the oxidation of W2C under hydrothermal conditions, temperature-controlled phase-transfer W catalysts such as tungsten acid (H2WO4) and WO3 were developed [95]. H2WO4 and WO3 can be dissolved in hot water, and go through phase transformation to water-soluble tungsten bronze (H x WO3) in the presence of H2. H x WO3 can be easily precipitated in cool water and recovered by filtration. H x WO3 is a highly active homogeneous catalyst able to promote hydrolysis and selective C–C cleavage reactions of cellulose to glycolaldehyde, which can then be hydrogenated over Ru/AC to give diols. An EG yield of 54.4% was obtained over H2WO4–Ru/AC, even after being reused over 20 times. The first approach for the controlled synthesis of EG and 1,2-PG was carried out at a similar cellulose conversion of about 20% over modified WO3–Ru/C catalysts in 2012 [89]. The main product was EG with a selectivity of 51.5% when WO3 and Ru/C were used. 1,2-PG selectivity was dramatically increased to 31.9% when AC was physically mixed with WO3. AC, owing to its surface basicity, appeared to accelerate the isomerization of glucose into fructose, which was likely the active intermediate for 1,2-PG as discussed above. The detailed performance over supported WO3 was compared, including against ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2. The selectivity to EG increased from 11.5% to 34.9% when the surface density of WO3 on ZrO2 increased from 4.2 to 6.4 W/nm2 due to a more suitable dispersion and size [89]. In the supported bimetallic catalysts (M−W), including Pd–W, Pt–W, Ru–W, and Ir–W, W was the key component during cellulose degradation by C–C cleavage. The transition metals (M) were mainly responsible for the hydrogenation reactions of unsaturated intermediates [96]. However, the EG yield over H2WO4–Ru was always lower than that over Ni–W2C/AC due to the methanation of EG over Ru [97]. Therefore, tuning the weight ratio of W to the transition metal is essential for product selectivity. A new binary catalyst composed of cheap Raney nickel and H2WO4 was systematically studied, with an EG yield of 65% due to the high hydrogenation activity of Raney nickel and its inertness to EG degradation [97]. Moreover, this Raney nickel–H2WO4 showed good reusability for at least 17 times in the one-pot conversion of cellulose to EG."
8,Basic support and solution,"4.3 Basic support and solution A significant amount of W (typically 15–40%) or an expensive support such as MC or SBA-15 is needed to obtain high diol yields in almost all of the above cases with H+ from different sources. Cellulose conversion by a combination of alkaline hydrolysis and hydrogenation was initially invented by Deng et al. [100]. The selectivity of EG, 1,2-PG, and 1,2,5-pentanetriol was 15%, 14%, and 22%, respectively, at 38% cellulose conversion at pH 8 in a phosphate buffer solution. The pathway under basic conditions is different from that under acidic conditions [94,99]. The former can be divided into two types. The first is the hydrolysis of cellulose, such as acid hydrolysis, to sugars, followed by formation of C2 or C3 polyols by hydrogenolysis. The other is β-hydroxy-carbonyl elimination, as shown in Fig. 5 . β-Hydroxy-carbonyl elimination begins with the reaction of the exposed reducing end groups of cellulose, and ceases when the reducing groups are depleted. Such an elimination pathway is favorable for the formation of 1,2,5-pentanetriol [100]. Other basic materials, such as ZnO, ZrO2, and MgO, supported Ni, and Ni–Cu catalysts, were also tested for one-pot diol production [98]. When 20% Ni/ZnO was used, it exhibited complete cellulose conversion with a 70.4% total glycol yield [98]. A high selectivity toward 1,2-alkanediols of 72.5% was obtained over Ni–Cu/ZnO when the ratio of Ni to Cu was 0.67 at 245 °C and 4 MPa H2, and resulted from the synergetic effects of Ni and Cu species on dehydroxylation and the C–C bond cleavage reactions of cellulose [108]. However, relatively poor hydrothermal stability of the basic-material-supported catalyst decreased its activity in repeated runs."
9,Summary and outlook,"The recent literature on the one-pot chemocatalytic conversion of cellulose to hexitols and 1,2-alkanediol, especially sorbitol and EG, was briefly surveyed, mainly for the catalysts developed. Although the target products were different, many similar catalytic strategies were used to overcome the mass-transfer limitation in the recalcitrant cellulose conversion. These can be summarized as follows: • The pretreatment of cellulose by chemo-degradation of the rigid structure, including mechanical and chemical methods of milling, acid or base impregnation, supercritical CO2 or steam explosion, and mixed milling of a solid acid catalyst, can decrease its polymerization and degree of crystallization. • New solvents such as ionic liquids, LiCl2/N,N-dimethylacetamide, Schweizer's reagent, and molten ZnCl2 hydrate have been explored to dissolve cellulose and increase the efficiency of its access to the catalyst. • The catalysts used for the complex one-pot aqueous conversion of cellulose to polyols have changed from mineral acid–Ru/C to heterogeneous catalysts for multi-step reactions. The design target for heterogeneous catalysts, made of non-noble metals combined with multifunctional materials, was to increase the available interaction with the ether linkage of cellulose. In particular, acidic materials for the functional carbon (AC, CNFS, CNTS, etc.) and mesoporous zeolites were adopted to provide a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, a high-porosity structure, and high metal dispersion (or metal surface area) and active phases, which would greatly increase the hydrolysis activity for cellulose conversion due to the rate-determining property in the one-pot conversion of cellulose to polyols. In addition, Ni–P/AC and Ni–W/AC catalysts gave good yields of sorbitol and EG, respectively. • The distribution of the products and by-products was also dependent on the reaction conditions, such as temperature, H2 pressure, and H+ source in the solution. In situ H+ generated from hot water and H2 was capable of performing acid-catalytic hydrolysis of cellulose, avoiding the use of mineral acids. High H2 pressure favored hydrogenation to hexitol. Yet longer reaction times with a higher acid concentration resulted in a high yield of C2–C5 polyols due to hydrogenolysis reactions. A high reaction temperature led to the carbonization of sugar intermediates to by-products such as humins and the formation of a large amount of unsaturated products containing CO and CC bonds. In addition, the hydrolysis intermediate of glucose was easily isomerized to mannose and fructose under alkaline conditions, which could be further hydrogenated to mannitol or hydrogenolyzed to 1,2-PG as by-products [26]. • For cellulosic and lignocellulosic biomass such as starch, corn stalk, and miscanthus, the presence of lignin and its aromatic derivatives after acid-catalytic degradation impeded access to the active sites of the catalysts for hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis, which decreased the polyol yields. However, hemicellulose did not have a negative effect on cellulose conversion and EG yield [109]. Although the advances described above give insight for the one-pot conversion of cellulose to polyols, there are still many fundamental obstacles that inhibit its future development and commercialization. The characterization of the structure of cellulose, efficient catalysts, and continuing reaction systems with separation and the in-depth investigation of multi-reaction pathways and mechanisms are still in high demand for the unequivocal control of the sorbitol or EG yield. First, the accessibility of substrates such as cellulose for depolymerization via their interaction with heterogeneous catalysts is still the subject of much research. The degree of crystallinity, along with the particle size and morphology, are likely to be the main factors that will characterize the accessibility of cellulose. However, the determination of the degree of crystallinity for pure cellulose lacks a standard method and reliability – let alone for more amorphous biomass substrates. Also, the physicochemical characterization and the selection of parameters to assess the accessibility of crude biomass are even more complicated and difficult than for pure cellulose. Secondly, the incomplete identification and determination of intermediates and products causes complications with regard to the carbon balance and the corresponding set-up of the hydrothermal reaction pathways and multi-step mechanism for cellulose conversion. The concurrent reactions of hydrolysis, hydrolytic transfer hydrogenation, hydrolytic hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis, retro-aldol condensation, isomerization, and dehydration occur in the same one-pot conversion process – and more than 30 types of product components have been reported in the one-pot conversion of cellulose to polyols, including gaseous products (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4), water-soluble products (oligosaccharides (cellobiose, cellotriose), fructose, glucose, mannose, levoglucosan, sorbitans, furfural, arabintol, preitol, erthyritol, lactic acid, methanol, ethanol, isosorbide, C2–C6 polyols, etc.), and water-insoluble products (tars and humins). However, most studies only give the yields of desired products such as sorbitol or EG, sometimes of more than 70%. Also, the reported carbon balance is usually lower than 90%, based on the dissolved and detectable organic carbon and the sum of carbon in the substrates. Due to the formation of plenty of water-soluble cello-oligomers in the mixture solutions, as mentioned above, it is complicated to fully separate and identify these components – which have similar chemical and physical properties. So, the lack of a precise determination of the species produced increases the derived carbon balance. The combination of several techniques such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and high-pressure liquid chromatography is required to solve this problem. The other reason for the discrepancy in the carbon balance is the formation of water-insoluble tars/humins attached to the reactor walls, as well as of gaseous products, which mainly derive from furan derivatives. The incomplete carbon balance makes establishment of reliable kinetic data difficult, even using cellobiose or glucose as the model compound for cellulose for sorbitol or EG production [110]. Some mechanism assumptions have been proposed by different researchers that are contradictory. For example, direct hydrogenolysis has been mentioned for bond cleavage in EG formation, which has recently been reconsidered as a selective retro-aldol condensation, followed by hydrogenation. However, C–C cleavage does not take place via the retro-aldol reaction on WO3 catalysts. When it comes to the use of crude biomass as the feedstock, there are no detailed reports that analyze its complicated product distributions and reaction mechanisms. A true understanding of the multi-reaction and consecutive reaction pathways and mechanisms, including the various by-products, is far from being available. Thus, the fundamental factors that govern catalytic performance to guide catalyst preparation and the choice of suitable reaction conditions are still under very basic investigation. Thirdly, an in-depth understanding of the conversion of cellulose, especially the effect of in situ-generated H+ in acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, is lacking. It has been generally accepted that a high acid concentration and strength, and good accessibility of acid sites, are favorable for the hydrolysis of cellulose to cello-oligomers. And H+ can be formed in situ by H2 dissociation or splitting water molecules over a metal surface at a high temperature (above 205 °C), further stabilized through the lone pair of oxygen groups on the surface of a functional support. Whether those protons are as freely available to the ether linkage as H+ from a mineral acid is unknown. Although electrochemical investigation by linear sweep voltammetry has been suggested for the analysis of H+ generated from water, it is still an indirect method for determining the oxidation current, according to the equation 2H2O (l) → O2 (g) + 4H+ (aq) + 4e−. Also, the proportion of H+ generated from H2 heterolytic dissociation and from the splitting of water cannot yet be precisely determined. The hydrated metal compounds such as [Ru(H2O)5OH]2 that are formed during the catalytic process are regarded as Brønsted acids. Also, the monosaccharides formed after the primary hydrolysis are able to transform into acids, which creates homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic conditions for the system, thus affecting the hydrolysis of cellulose. These acidic sites further increase the difficulty in discerning H+ sources and the extent of cellulose hydrolysis in hot compressed water. Another issue concerning in situ H+ generation is the reaction temperature. A high water temperature has an advantage for H+ production, but the by-product selectivity, especially for the condensed insoluble component, increases. In addition, the energy consumption for high-temperature water production is another practical problem that needs to be solved. The control of temperature, the H2 pressure, and the metal catalyst for H+ generation are essential for a high yield of the target product since hydrolysis is the rate-determining and the first step in the conversion of cellulose to polyols. Further, studies of the residual electrons and OH–in the reaction solution, after H+ generation from H2 and water, have not yet been carried out. One assumption is that those groups might be involved in the concurrent base-catalyzed hydrolysis. In addition to the investigations suggested above, the stable catalytic conversion, continuous operation, and efficient separation and purification of the system are other concerns for the hydrothermal depolymerization of stable cellulose or lignocellulosic substrates. Mechanistic insights into the reaction network could be used to rationalize the influence of the reaction conditions and catalyst composition on the yield of polyols. Although increasing the H2 pressure could stabilize the intermediate sugars and depress side reactions, it is costly and unpractical. The other option is to design tailor-made heterogeneous catalysts to improve the selectivity of the target products of sorbitol and EG, which could be a reasonable approach, based on theory and conclusions deriving from the multi-reaction mechanism. A subtle balance of the catalytic functions, such as hydrolysis and hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis for a high yield of hexitols or EG, is needed to simplify the refining process. Recyclable catalysts are also desired for the continuous conversion of cellulose into useful polyols. In particular, the stability of cheap Ni catalysts for reuse should be improved in hot water at 190–250 °C, at which temperatures some multifunctional supports would suffer a loss of surface area, acidity, or collapse of the structure and leaching of active metal sites. Although the separation of catalysts and substrates from products could be overcome by using a heterogeneous catalyst via filtering or a magnetic method if Fe or Ni was used, the separation of non-reacted insoluble lignin, ashes, and char from the surface or pores of solid catalysts remains difficult. Also, if a catalyst is in continuous use, the rapid deactivation reduces its recycling life. Another key problem noted in other reports is the low concentration of cellulose in solutions (normally 1–3 wt%), which resulted in a low content of sorbitol or EG for separation. Obviously, maximizing the initial cellulose concentration is a necessity, to increase the production capacity and reduce water and energy consumption. The use of a fed-batch reactor was a successful in a trial for high EG productivity with a high-concentration feedstock of 0.2 kg/L, which is important for its feasible separation from the aqueous solution [103]. The subsequent product separation from the reaction mixture is another serious challenge due to the large number of different components with similar chemical properties. The polyols and other soluble monosaccharides in the solution mixture usually have high and similar boiling points, which hinders distillation for separation. Therefore, the use of biphase systems seems a feasible solution for the extraction of the products. However, the choice of extraction solvents remains troublesome. Studies of the performance of other reactor types, such as semi-batch and fixed bed combing with microwave heating, should be carried out to investigate the continuous or semi-continuous operation of a cellulose conversion process, to decrease energy consumption and the reaction time [111]. On the basis of above discussion, there are still many challenges for the integration of the new route for large-scale polyol production from cellulose or biomass. Each step needs to be investigated separately to demonstrate the feasibility of the process, including the pretreatment of the substrate, highly efficient and cheap catalyst preparation, moderate catalytic conditions, new techniques for product separation and purification with less energy consumption, and the valuable utilization of by-products. Studies in this field are in high demand to resolve the outstanding problems, allowing its successful future application."
