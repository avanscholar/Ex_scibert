0,Introduction,"With the decrease of fossil fuel and the serious care on environmental pollution, it becomes more urgent to explore the alternative energy to meet the growing energy demands. Hydrogen as the most clean energy carrier has attracted much attention in the world [1]. Compared with the traditional chemical process for the hydrogen production from fossil resources, biological hydrogen production is promising for its capability of being renewable and environmentally benign [1,2]. The two most extensively studied biological means for the hydrogen production are the photosynthetic production by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and the fermentative production by Clostridia spp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp., which have been reviewed by Benemann [1] and Nandi and Sengupta [3]. For the fermentative biohydrogen production, Clostridia spp are the most widely-studied strain with the well known Fe-hydrogenase-mediated pathway for hydrogen evolution. Enterobacter aerogenes, a facultative anaerobe, can grow fast, produce hydrogen with high rate, and the bioprocess can be easily manipulated [4]. The relatively high hydrogen evolution rate obtained in E. aerogenes fermentation has demonstrated that this organism possesses a high potential for large-scale hydrogen production [5,6]. Recently, by a simple whole-cell assay method for detection of the hydrogenase activities in E. aerogenes, the activities of the uptake hydrogenase and hydrogen-evolving hydrogenase have been found [7]. E. aerogenes has been indicated to possess two distinct hydrogen-producing pathways. One pathway involves the decomposition by formate hydrogen lyase of formate itself formed from pyruvate by pyruvate formate lyase, which is a fermentation end product of glucose in a manner similar to E. coli metabolism [4,8,9]. The effects of formate on hydrogen production of E. aerogenes by a formate pathway have been reported by Tatsuo and Shigeharu [4]. Another pathway mainly studied by Nakashimada et al., Zhang and Tanisho et al. [10–12] is reportedly dependent upon the re-oxidation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) inside the cells. The maximum theoretical yield of hydrogen evolution through the NADH pathway is reportedly 10mol H2/mol glucose if the metabolic pathway can be well controlled [10,12], which is much higher than the typical yield of the other fermentative hydrogen-producing strains (4mol H2/mol glucose). This is because that one mol glucose can generate 10mol NADH through glucolysis and areobic respiration, if an ideal reaction system capable of directing the NADH formed in aerobic condition to hydrogen production by the anaerobic metabolism can be realized, the maximum H2 yield 10mol/mol glucose via NADH will be possible. Incidentally, hydrogen production yield of 1mol H2/mol NADH has been confirmed experimentally in our previous study [11]. Previous researches on hydrogen production by E. aerogenes have mainly focused on culture conditions and the fermentation processes [2]. The highest rate of hydrogen conversion reached experimentally by E. aerogenes was less than 1.58mol H2/mol glucose by batch culture under anaerobic condition sparged with Ar [12]. Compared with Clostridia spp., the reachable hydrogen yield in E. aerogenes fermentation is still low. But taking the oxygen-tolerance and high theoretical hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes into consideration, if the hydrogen-evolving pathway as well as the related hydrogenases can be elucidated and controlled, the application of this strain in hydrogen production process will be promising. However, the hydrogen gene information of E. aerogenes, especially on formate pathway or uptaking hydrogen gene is still limited. The Ni–Fe hydrogenase of Enterobacer cloacae IIT-BT 08 responsible for hydrogen production from several saccharides has been isolated and characterized [13,14]. The hydrogen yield and hydrogen evolution rate can be improved by E. aerogenes or its mutants that are deficient in acids or alcohol production [5,10,15,16]. Therefore the molecular mechanism and the related genes for hydrogen evolution in E. aerogenes are needed to be elucidated for enhancing the hydrogen production. In this study, in order to understand the hydrogen-evolving mechanism and develop the molecular tools for improving the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes, we cloned the E. aerogenes formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) gene cluster and small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase, and compared them with genes of similar function published in GenBank. Based on these results, the production of hydrogen and fermentative metabolites were analyzed in knockouts of hycA and/or hybO encoding the respective FHL repressor and the small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase using the pYM-Red recombination system [17,18]. Since there are two pathways contributing to hydrogen production in E. aerogenes as described above, and the hydrogen produced through the formate pathway can be obtained by metabolic flux analysis based on the anaerobic metabolites detected, the hydrogen produced from the NADH pathway can thus be calculated by subtracting the hydrogen production by formate pathway from the total hydrogen production detected. The validity of this calculation of hydrogen production by E. aerogenes has been confirmed by a chemostat culture in our previous study [11]. The results obtained in the this paper can help to provide a more thorough understanding of the metabolic regulation, hydrogen production by the FHL pathway, and the role of the uptake hydrogenase in E. aerogenes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Strains, plasmids and medium","2.1 Strains, plasmids and medium The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . E. aerogenes IAM1183 was purchased from the Institute of Applied Microorganisms of the University of Tokyo, Japan. E. aerogenes IAM1183, its mutants, and E. coli as host in genetic manipulation were all cultured aerobically in a 250ml flask containing 100ml medium of Luria Broth (per liter: 5g yeast extract, 10g trypone, and 5g NaCl) on a shaker at 170rpm and 37°C [7]. Antibiotics were added to the growth medium in accordance with the experimental need at the following concentrations: 30μg/mL kanamycin (Km), 100μg/mL ampicillin (Amp), 4μg/mL tetracycline (Tet) or 30μg/mL chloramphenicol (Chl). Glucose medium containing (per liter) 15g glucose, 5g trypone, 14g K2HPO4, 6g KH2PO4, 2g (NH4)2SO4 and 0.2g MgSO4·7H20 was used for measuring the hydrogen production."
3,Primers and PCR conditions,"2.2 Primers and PCR conditions All primers were designed with the aid of ClustalX software to be homologous to conserved regions of bacterial strain's FHL gene cluster and the gene encoding the small subunit of the hydrogen uptake hydrogenase as published in GenBank (Table 2 ). The following protocol was for PCR experiments (TECHNE TC512): initial temperature of 105°C for 1min and predenaturation at 95°C for 5min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1min, annealing at 50–63°C for 1min, and extension at 72°C for 1–3min. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and extracted using an Omega Agarose Gel Extraction Kit D2510-01. When a final DNA concentration in excess of 100mg/μL was required, the Promega Gel and PCR Clean-Up System Kit was used instead. Gene sequencing was performed by the Shanghai Invitrogen Corporation (NASDAQ: IVGN)."
4,Construction of plasmids and recombinant strains,"2.3 Construction of plasmids and recombinant strains E. aerogenes IAM1183-p-red, in which the recombinant pYM-Red plasmid had been transformed into the competent cells of E. aerogenes via electroporation [18], were prepared. The pYM-Red plasmid, a new gene recombinant system constructed by Yu et al. [18] was used to develop the gene knockout tools for E. aerogenes., i.e., knocking out gene hycA, encoding the FHL repressor protein, and hybO, encoding the small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase. The linear DNA templates encoding an antibiotic resistance marker gene were synthesized via PCR with overhanging primers. The linear pHYCA-km DNA fragment was amplified from the kanamycin cassette of plasmid pET28a using primers hycA-Fw and hycA-Rv. The linear pHYBO-tet DNA fragment was amplified from the tetracycline cassette of the low-copy plasmid pACYC184 using primers hybO-Fw and hybO-Rv. The underlined 5′ ends of these primers (Table 2) corresponded to 40bp of the overhanging sequence, which is homologous to a portion of the respective target gene, hycA and hybO. Competent cells of E. aerogenes IAM1183 containing the pYM-Red recombination system were transformed with either pHYCA-km or pHYBO-tet (listed in Table 1) linear DNA via electroporation. The transformed cells were spread on LB agar plates containing either kanamycin (50ug/ml) and chloramphenicol (30ug/ml) or tetracycline (4ug/ml) and chloramphenicol (30ug/ml), and subsequently cultured at 37°C overnight. PCR analysis confirmed that the colonies capable of growing on the plates with the double antibiotics possessed the desired △hycA and/or △hybO genotype."
5,Anaerobic cultivation for hydrogen production,"2.4 Anaerobic cultivation for hydrogen production The anaerobic cultivation with serum bottles was performed using 50ml serum bottle with open top caps and PTFE/silicone rubber septa. In each experiment, a 50mL serum bottle containing 20mL medium was inoculated with the seedling cells and sealed with an airtight seal. Nitrogen sparging was performed to purge the residual air from the bottles thereby creating the anaerobic conditions. Serum bottles were then cultivated at 37°C for 12h with the periodic measurements of cell density and pH at 1.5h intervals. For all the experiments for measuring the hydrogen productivities of the E. aerogenes mutant strains, the wild-type E. aerogenes IAM1183 was used as the control."
6,Anaerobic fermentation,"2.5 Anaerobic fermentation Fermentation experiments were carried out at 37°C in a 5L bioreactor (Biof-6005A, Shanghai Biotech Co., Ltd. China) containing 3L medium at uncontroled pH. Even though pH is an important parameter for hydrogen fermentation, this experiment was to compare the bioreactor fermentation with the serum bottle cultures, and examine the effect of genetic engineering manipulation on hydrogen production, pH was not controlled. Nitrogen sparging was performed to purge the residual air from the fermentor to form anaerobic conditions. Batch cultivations in the fermentor were carried out for comparison of E. aerogenes IAM1183-AO and the wild type. The pH, hydrogen evolution rate, total hydrogen yield and metabolite concentrations were detected during the fermentation."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The cell density during the cultivation was measured by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1206, Japan) at 600nm (OD600). The total volume of gas produced in the serum bottle during the anaerobic cultures was measured via a syringe and that of 5L fermentor was measured by WET GAS METER (Sinagawa Co., Japan). The composition of the gas was measured using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A, Japan) with a Parapak Q 80–100mesh column and a TCD detector. Analysis of the metabolites was performed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (10A, Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with an SCR-102 G column (Shimadzu Corporation) and a RID-10A detector at a temperature of 40°C. The mobile phase was 0.1% perchloric acid aq. solution."

9,PCR amplification of formate hydrogen lyase cluster and uptake hydrogenase small subunit hybO from E. aerogenes IAM1183,"3.1 PCR amplification of formate hydrogen lyase cluster and uptake hydrogenase small subunit hybO from E. aerogenes IAM1183 The two pairs of PCR primers (hycE-fw and hycE-rv, hycA-fw and hycA-rv) were designed according to the conserved regions of the hycA and hycE genes as published in GenBank (see Section 2). The total E. aerogenes IAM1183 chromosomal DNA as template, two 1705-bp and 1008-bp fragments were obtained by PCR amplification with these primer pairs. Subsequent DNA sequencing revealed that these fragments shared significant similarity with the respective hycA and hycE genes obtained from various hydrogen-producing bacterial species such as Enterobacter sp. 638, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella Flexner, and E. coli according to a blast search in NCBI. This result indicated that homologous genes of the hycA and hycE were present in E. aerogenes. The hycA-fw and hycE-rv were used to amplify the partial formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) gene cluster from E. aerogenes IAM1183 chromosomal DNA. The resulting 5431-bp fragment (GeneBank accession no. EF601125) included a partial hycA sequence, complete hycBCD ORFs, and a partial hycE sequence. The predicted protein products of the five hyc genes were found to be most similar to the FHL proteins of S. typhimurium LT2, possessing an 83% sequence identity. The 5431-bp fragment's overall organizational structure was most similar to the E. coli FHL cluster [20,21]. Multiple alignments using the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the putative proteins encoded by E. aerogenes IAM1183 hycABCDE shared a larger degree of sequence identity with more distantly related bacterial species, such as K. pneumoniae subsp, S. typhimurium, or E. coli than with the more closely related bacteria species such as Enterobacter sp. 638 or Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC BAA-894. The hycABCDE amino acid sequence of E. aerogenes IAM1183 showed the highest identity of 83% with hyc cluster sequences of S. typhimurium LT2, while possessing only 70% identity with hyc clusters from other Enterobacter species such as Enterobacter sp. 638 or E. sakazakii ATCC BAA-894. The lengths of the coding regions and the lengths of the predicted amino acid sequences found in the hycABCDE construct were similarity with E. coli's [20]. One interesting feature was the presence of overlapping termination and initiation codons from the hycB and hycC genes, respectively. As a result, the hycB and hycC genes shared four bases, ATGA. In our previous study, we reported the hydrogen uptake activity in whole cells of E. aerogenes IAM1183 [7]. In order to better understand the mechanism of hydrogen production in E. aerogenes IAM1183, the hybO gene encoding the small subunit of hydrogen uptake hydrogenase was also used for amplification via PCR using primers hybO-fw and hybO-rv. A 790-bp DNA fragment was obtained and sequenced (GeneBank accession no. EF601126). This fragment was found to share 80–99% identity in terms of both nucleotide and amino acid sequence with the hybO genes previously characterized in other species, such as K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Thus, it was ascertained that this 790-bp DNA fragment was a hybO homolog present in E. aerogenes IAM1183. This was the first report for identifying the uptake hydrogenases gene in E. aerogenes."
10,Construction of mutants using the pYM-Red recombination system,"3.2 Construction of mutants using the pYM-Red recombination system In order to analyze the functions of FHL gene cluster and uptake hydrogenases gene in E. aerogenes IAM1183, chromosomal mutation of the FHL transcriptional repressor (hycA) and small subunit of hydrogen uptake hydrogenase (hybO) was carried out to enhance the FHL pathway's activity. Both the hycA and hybO genes in E. aerogenes were targeted for knockout using the pYM-Red recombination system. Mutants of E. aerogenes IAM1183-A (△hycA), IAM1183-O (△hybO), and IAM1183-AO (△hycA/△hybO) were screened on the antibiotic resistance plates containing kanamycin, tetracycline and double antibiotics of kanamycin and tetracycline, respectively. PCR amplification of the chromosomal DNA from the respective mutants confirmed the correct genetic knockouts (data not shown). These mutants were successfully obtained and used to examine the variation of the metabolism in the following experiment."
11,Culture performance of the mutants,"3.3 Culture performance of the mutants The physiological characteristics pertinent to hydrogen fermentation were analyzed for each of the mutants of IAM1183-A, IAM1183-O, and IAM1183-AO through serum bottle experiments. The mutants and the wild strain were cultivated in glucose medium under anaerobic conditions for 12h at 37°C. The final pH of the IAM1183-A culture, was 4.89 and was a little higher than that of the other three strains (Fig. 1 ). From the growth curves of all the strains, the maximum specific growth rate during the exponential phase was calculated. The maximum specific growth rate of the wild type, △hycA, △hybO and △hycA/△hybO strains were 0.523±0.034, 0.414±0.001, 0.381±0.013 and 0.359±0.002 (h−1), respectively. Therefore the mutations appeared to slightly slow down the growth rate even under the addition of the antibiotics. Interestingly, of the four strains examined, the average fraction of carbon dioxide contained in the gas phase of the double-mutant strain IAM1183-AO was the lowest, equivalent 28.2% of the final total biogas volume (Fig. 2A). The average fraction of carbon dioxide evolved from IAM1183, IAM1183-A and IAM1183-O was 40.8, 39.0 and 40.3%, respectively. The corresponding time courses of the hydrogen production by the various strains were examined (Fig. 2B). The double-mutant IAM1183-AO strain demonstrated both the highest hydrogen-evolving rate and the highest final hydrogen amount. In contrast, the wild type IAM1183 strain demonstrated the slowest hydrogen-evolving rate and the lowest final hydrogen amount. The rates of hydrogen production were also calculated for the different strains. The maximum hydrogen-evolving rates during the exponential phase were estimated from the measurements taken at 1.5h and 4.5h. The maximum specific hydrogen productivities for fermentation of the △hycA, △hybO and △hycA/△hybO strains were 2879.466±38.59, 2747.203±13.25 and 3372.019±4.39 (mlh−1 g−1dry cell weight), respectively. The specific hydrogen production rates of the △hycA, △hybO, and △hycA/△hybO strains were increased by 24.0%, 18.3% and 45.2% compared to that of the wild strain which was 2321.861±15.34 (mlh−1 g−1dry cell weight). The hydrogen content in the gas phase was directly measured by the gas chromatography. The molar fraction of hydrogen produced by the wild strain was only 59.2%. In comparison the molar fraction of hydrogen present in the total product gas was more than 59.2% for all the mutant strains, especially the purity of the product gas for IAM1183-AO cultivation was as high as 71.7%. Since there are two pathways contributing to hydrogen production in E. aerogenes as described above [10–12], for all the strains used in the present study, the total hydrogen yield per mole glucose by the anaerobic fermentation was analyzed in terms of the individual FHL and NADH pathways (Fig. 3). According to the central anaerobic metabolic pathway of E. aerogenes [22], pyruvate is split to formate and acetyl-CoA via pyruvate formate lyase, while no other VFAs such as butyric and propionic acids are formed, which were also confirmed in the present study. Then H2 and CO2 are produced from formate via formate hydrogen lyase and acetyl-CoA is converted to either acetate or ethanol. Therefore, according to the mass balance, hydrogen yield through formate pathway was calculated by the following equation based on the metabolites detected: Amount of Hydrogen Produced through Formate Pathway=Amount of Ethanol+Amount of Acetate−Amount of Formate (end-production), of which the amount of formate was 0 based on our analytical results. The hydrogen yield through the NADH pathway was calculated by the following equation: Amount of Total Hydrogen Produced=Amount of Hydrogen Produced through Formate Pathway+Amount of Hydrogen Produced through NADH Pathway. From this equation, hydrogen yield from NADH pathway could be estimated (Fig. 3 ). The total hydrogen yield was calculated from the total hydrogen production and glucose consumption which were detected in the experiments. The H2 yields from the FHL of the three mutants IAM1183-A, IAM1183-O, and IAM1183-AO were measured to be 0.73, 0.78, and 0.83mol-H2/mol glucose, respectively. In comparison, the wild-type IAM1183 strain yield was only 0.65mol-H2/mol glucose, which confirmed the original hypothesis of the functions of hycA and hybO genes. However, for the contribution of the NADH pathway to hydrogen production, the IAM1183-A and IAM1183-O strains exhibited the same level as that of the wild type, while the IAM1183-AO strain demonstrated a slight improvement. Since the mechanism of the NADH pathway in E. aerogenes is still unknown, the result in Fig. 3 implied that there might be some relations between the NADH, FHL pathways and hydrogen uptake for hydrogen production. Further study on the mechanism of the NADH pathway for hydrogen production should be needed."
12,Changes in final metabolite concentration in the mutants,"3.4 Changes in final metabolite concentration in the mutants The metabolic flux change in IAM1183-A, IAM1183-O and IAM1183-AO was more clearly revealed via measurement of metabolites. Each strain was cultivated in a sealed 50mL serum bottle containing 20mL glucose medium (see Section 2). The cells were centrifuged at 13,000×g for 10min and the supernatant was collected for HPLC analysis. The concentrations of the major excreted final metabolites H2, CO2, formate, 2,3-butanediol, lactate, acetate, succinate, ethanol, and biomass were measured and summarized in Table 3 . These metabolites were also committed with the well reported anaerobic metabolic pathway [22]. All three mutant strains exhibited enhanced acetate and ethanol yields compared with the wild type, and strain IAM1183-AO possessed the highest total yields of the both products. As the total amount of formate synthesized was equal to the sum of ethanol and acetate produced [22], this result correlated well with the increase in FHL pathway activity by gene knockout (Fig. 3). The 2,3-butanediol and succinate yields of the mutant strains were also all higher than those of the wild type. The lactate production of IAM1183-AO and IAM1183-A were higher than that of the wild type. However, the lactate production of IAM1183-O was the same as the wild type. No formate was detected in the supernatants of all the cultures. It was shown that all metabolic formate was split into H2 and CO2. Interestingly, these data also suggested an inverse correlation between lactate production and CO2 yield, although the mechanism remains unclear. Nevertheless, overall analysis clearly showed that the double-mutant IAM1183-AO strain possessed a unique redistribution of metabolic flux to maintain its intracellular redox balance. A carbon balance was further taken for all the strains. In order to calculate the amount of assimilated carbon recovery as biomass, an elemental composition of C4.2H8O1.25N0.68P0.1 was assumed [4]. In every case carbon recovery was estimated to be a little bit higher than 100% (Table 3). Notably, the molar quantity of synthesized H2 exceeded the total molar quantity of ethanol and acetate produced in all the strains, providing further evidence for the existence of an NADH-dependent hydrogen production pathway in E. aerogenes. For many merits in hydrogen production, IAM1183△hycA/△hybO was chosen to examine the characteristics of cell growth and hydrogen production in the fermentor experiment. The wild strain was used as control. The total hydrogen produced reached 4.4L after 18h cultivation, while that of the wild type was only 2.9L under the same conditions of the bioreactor experiment. The metabolic flux distribution of the mutants and wild strain in the fermentor experiment was also similar with the serum bottle experiments (data not shown)."
13,Discussion,"In this study, isolation of new genes pertaining to hydrogen production of E. aerogenes in conjunction with knockout repressor protein and uptaking hydrogen process was employed to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production. A 5431-bp DNA fragment similarity to the hyc gene clusters of E. coli characterized previously [21], which encode formate hydrogen lyase (FHL), was successfully amplified and cloned from E. aerogenes IAM1183 chromosome. A 790-bp fragment homologous to the hybO gene encoding the uptake hydrogenase small subunit was also identified. These sequences clearly indicated that the hyc cluster and hybO were present in E. aerogenes IAM1183, contributing to hydrogen production. This was the first report on formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) cluster and uptake hydrogenase gene in E. aerogenes. As a mutation strategy, the pYM-Red recombination system was tried to yield mutants of E. aerogenes for hydrogen production. By knockout of the negative regulation gene of FHL pathway and small subunit of uptake hydrogenese, three mutants of IAM1183-A (△hycA), IAM1183-O (△hybO) and IAM1183-AO (△hycA/△hybO) were obtained. It was shown that the pYM-Red recombination system was successfully employed to construct knockout mutants of E. aerogenes to change the hydrogen productivity. The pYM-Red recombination system had seldom applied to the other bacteria apart from E. coli, and the result also implied that the application of the pYM-Red recombination system could be extended to the other bacterial host species beyond E. coli. Compared with the wild type strain, all of the mutants of IAM1183-A, IAM1183-O, and IAM1183-AO showed an improvement of hydrogen production. Disruption of hycA was hypothesized to increase the expression levels of FHL enzymes and thereby increase the hydrogen production. The disruption of hycA to increase FHL activity has previously been reported in E. coli [20,23,24], which was similar to our results for E. aerogenes. The hybO gene is responsible for consumption or uptake of the produced hydrogen. Disrupting this gene would reduce at least part of the organism's hydrogen uptake activity and thereby increase the hydrogen production. The specific hydrogenease activity of IAM1183-O was detected to be 557.1±13.099 (mUmg−1 Dry cell weight), and higher than that of the wild strain 132.014±3.294 (mUmg−1 Dry cell weight) increase to 4.22 times. These results also suggested that the hycA and hybO genes were successfully knocked out in the mutants and had beneficial effects on hydrogen productivity. The growths of the mutants were relatively slower than that of the wild type under the anaerobic conditions, suggesting that the knockout mutations may have some negative effects on the cell biomass synthesis. However, both the rate of hydrogen production and the total hydrogen yield for the mutant strains were higher than those of the wild type strain, respectively. The double-mutant IAM1183-AO exhibited the fastest rate of hydrogen production and the highest total hydrogen yield. Especially, the H2 fraction of the total product gas produced in the IAM1183-AO fermentation was as high as 71.7%. The result showed that the hydrogen yield increased via FHL pathway, and that hydrogen was also consumed decreasingly due to knockout small subunit uptake hydrogenase gene. The results of the IAM1183-AO in the fermentor experiment were also similar with the serum bottle experiments. Because high purity hydrogen is necessary for many commercial applications, the elevated hydrogen content in the gas product suggested that IAM1183-AO might be a potential candidate for biohydrogen production system. In the absence of oxygen, this formate can be utilized by the FHL pathway to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide in equal molar quantities [22]. Meanwhile, at the anaerobic condition, the resulting acetyl-CoA is partially transformed into acetate and ethanol. During the batch cultivation of E. aerogenes without pH control, no formate was detected. This finding suggested that the FHL activity in E. aerogenes was fast enough to transfer the formate formed into hydrogen and carbon dioxide via FHL. It can thus be assumed that the hydrogen yield from the formate pathway is equal to the sum of the acetate and ethanol yields. The 2,3-butanediol, lactate, and succinate yields in the cultivations of the three mutant strains were also higher than those of wild type (Table 3). As all the three metabolites were produced through NADH consuming pathways, implying that the △hycA and△hybO mutations also have affected the intracellular NADH/NAD+ pools and redistributed the metabolic fluxes accordingly. As an unexpected result, the carbon recovery levels were calculated to be greater than 100% based on glucose, which was probably due to the involvement of additional carbon sources of tryptone in the medium for cell utilization, but was not taken into account for the calculation (Table 3). The validity of the metabolic flux analysis in terms of carbon balance used in this paper has been confirmed in our chemostat anaerobic culture of E. aerogenes [11], and anaerobic resting cell system using glucose-contained PBS buffer for hydrogen production with a carbon recovery of about 98% (data not shown). In the fermentor experiment without pH control, the double mutant was similar in growth, pH, hydrogen production and metabolites compared with the serum bottle cultivation. The residual glucose was much lower than that of wild strain under the uncontrolled pH. Since the main purpose of the fermentor experiment was to compare the metabolic characteristics of the wild strain and mutants with those in the serum bottle culture as described above, the pH was not controlled. But for the bioprocess engineering of hydrogen production, optimization of the mutant culture such as optimization of pH and the control should be examined further. In summary, the hyc gene clusters encoding FHL enzymes and hybO encoding uptake hydrogenase in E. aerogenes IAM1183 was successfully cloned and identified. By mutation with pYM-Red recombination system, mutants of E. aerogenes IAM1183 with the respective knockouts of the hycA, hybO and double knockout of hycA and hybO were obtained. The characteristics of the mutants in terms of hydrogen production and metabolism were different from those of the wild type strain. The specific hydrogen production rates of △hycA, △hybO, and △hycA/△hybO strains were increased by 24%, 18% and 45% compared with that of the wild strain, respectively. The concentrations of the major end productions of metabolites of H2, CO2, 2,3-butanediol, lactate, acetate, succinate and ethanol were also changed in the mutants. These results clearly showed that the knockout of hycA, hybO and double knockout of hycA and hybO improved the overall hydrogen production efficiency of E. aerogenes. The total hydrogen volume produced by the △hycA/△hybO mutant in 5L fermentor was increased by 46% compared with that of the wild type. These mutants generated in this work have a potential for further study on the mechanism of hydrogen metabolism of E. aerogenes and application for biohydrogen production."
