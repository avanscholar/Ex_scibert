0,Introduction,"Development of the atom-efficient synthetic strategies has long since been expected to achieve the significant goal of green chemistry on minimizing the production waste and reducing the depletion of fossil fuel resources [1–3]. In particular, utilization of environmentally benign reactants such as O2 (or air), H2, and H2O to facilitate the industrial applications of synthetic reactions has attracted much attention [4–9]. Primary alcohols are fundamental building-blocks for producing a broad range of chemical commodities, such as detergents and plasticizers [10,11]. Direct installation of a hydroxyl group (OH) from H2O into a terminal alkene is regarded as an ideal approach for the synthesis of primary alcohols with a great commercial value [12,13]. However, the ordinary acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes affords only secondary alcohols in accordance with Markovnikov’s rule. Moreover, the reaction suffers from low yield because the equilibrium of the hydration lies on the side of elimination [14]. As a consequence, a two-step process consisting of the hydroformylation of terminal alkenes into aldehydes followed by a hydrogenation step is mostly adopted in the current chemical industry [15]. Several formal anti-Markovnikov hydrations with multiple steps have been exploited, such as a hydroboration-oxidation sequence [14] and a method combining terminal-selective Wacker oxidation followed by reduction [16]. However, multicomponent metal complexes or stoichiometric reagents and oxidants are commonly required, resulting in low atom efficiency, and their industrial applications also remain out of reach. On the other hand, the catalytic transformation of terminal alkenes into a π-allyl intermediate followed by a nucleophilic attack at the less-hindered terminal position is an attractive way to build linear products (Scheme 1 a). Over the past decades, a number of anti-Markovnikov selective processes have been developed, including acetoxylation [17–19], alkylation [20], amination [21], amidation [22], etherification [23], esterification [24], carboxylation [25], and trifluoromethoxylation [26]. However, the majority of these reactions proceed in the presence of strong nucleophiles, and H2O has seldom been used [27]. For example, Showa Denko commercialized an industrial process for the production of allyl alcohol from propene over a supported Pd catalyst, and CH acetoxylation has been applied as an initial step [17]. Mitsubishi Chemical developed a supported Pd-Te catalyst to convert 1,3-butadiene into butane-1,4-diol in the 1970s. However, the synthetic route to deliver the alcohol products includes three steps: allylic acetoxylation, alkene reduction and ester hydrolysis [18,19,28]. For several notable fine chemical examples, Stahl et al. and Kaneda et al. individually reported similar strategies to achieve the transformation of terminal alkenes into primary alcohols starting from allylic CH acetoxylation [29,30]. Manyik et al. reported an interesting reaction of 1,3-butadiene with H2O, but the real nucleophile is carbonate, which is generated from H2O and pressurized CO2. Additionally, the telomerization of 1,3-butadiene is unavoidable [31]. Our group previously reported a homogeneous Pd-catalyzed reaction to yield primary alcohols from terminal alkenes, but pressurized CO2 was necessary. In addition, stoichiometric benzoquinone derivatives have to be employed as the oxidant (Scheme 1b) [32]. With several advantages in terms of separation and recycling, supported metal catalysts have been intensively investigated in both fine and bulk chemical synthesis [33–37]. Very recently, we developed several heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions, such as CH bond functionalization [38,39], allylic acetoxylation [40], and Wacker oxidation [41]. Herein, we first disclose a practical access for the direct conversion of terminal alkenes with H2O into primary alcohols over a metal oxide-supported Pd catalyst using O2 as the sole oxidant. The target saturated alcohols can be acquired by a subsequent simple hydrogenation in a “one-pot” sequence. Most of all, the catalyst allows the production of 2-butene-1,4-diol from 1,3-butadiene without the formation of telomerization byproducts in the absence of stoichiometric organic or inorganic additives (Scheme 1c)."

3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Pd/ZrO2 and PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation (IMP) method. The palladium loading was adjusted to 5 wt%. Pd(NO3)2 aqueous solution (570 μL) was diluted in a small amount of water. ZrO2 or CeO2-ZrO2 (1.0 g) was added to the aqueous solution and stirred at RT for 30 min. After impregnation, H2O was removed by freeze-drying. The obtained catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h to obtain PdO/ZrO2 and PdO/CeO2-ZrO2. Then, PdO/ZrO2 was reduced in a flow of pure H2 (20 mL/min) at 200 °C for 2 h to obtain Pd/ZrO2 [41]. Metal oxide supported Pd(OH)2 catalysts were prepared by the deposition-precipitation (DP) method. The palladium loading was adjusted to 5 wt%.

After impregnation, H2O was removed by freeze drying to obtain Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2. The catalyst preparation methods in this work are summarized in Scheme S1, Supplementary Information."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization High angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) observations were performed using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F. The palladium amounts in the catalysts were analyzed by microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (MP-AES) using an Agilent 4100 MP-AES. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku MiniFlex600 with a high-intensity CuKα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were performed at the BL14B2 beamline of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) [43,44]. The XAFS samples were ground with boron nitride in an agate mortar and compacted into pellets. Pd K-edge (24.3 keV) XAFS spectra were measured using a Si (311) double–crystal monochromator in transmission mode. The spectral analysis was performed using the XAFS analysis software Athena and REX2000 (Rigaku Co.) [45]. The experiments of temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) were individually performed using a BELCAT, MicrotracBEL, equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a mass spectrometry (BELMass). For CO2-TPD, the samples (62 mg) were pretreated at 100 °C in Ar (40 mL/min) for 10 min, and then He (40 mL/min) for 60 min. After pretreatment, the temperature was decreased to 30 °C, and 4.5–5.5% CO2 in He (40 mL/min) was introduced into the cell at 30 °C for 60 min. The samples were tested from RT to 800 °C in a flow of He (40 mL/min) at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min. The experiment of TPO was carried out with 5% O2 in He (40 mL/min) from RT to 700 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. Conversions and product yields for the transformation of 3-phenyl-1-propene (allylbenzene) into 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol (cinnamyl alcohol), 3-phenyl-2-propenal (cinnamaldehyde), phenyl-2-propanone (phenyl acetone) and 3-phenylpropan-1-ol were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent, GC 6850 Series II equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a J&W HP-1 column (0.25 μm thickness, 0.32 mm I.D., 30 m) using tridecane as an internal standard.

GC mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis was performed with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Polaris Q equipped with a J&W HP-1 column (0.25 μm thickness, 0.25 mm I.D., 30 m). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-ECS400 spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively. 1H assignment abbreviations are as follows: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quintet (quin), double of doublet (dd), double of triplet (dt), and multiplet (m). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed with Merck, TLC silica gel 60 F254 plates. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (Kanto Chemicals, Silica gel 60 N, spherical, neutral, particle size 40–100 μm)."

The reaction mixture was collected every 2 h and analyzed by GC."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Optimization of reaction conditions,"3.1 Optimization of reaction conditions The synthesis of cinnamyl alcohol (2a) from allylbenzene (1) and H2O was investigated as a model reaction under aerobic conditions over Pd/ZrO2 which is an efficient catalyst to promote the Wacker oxidation of terminal alkenes with H2O [41]. DMSO was used as the solvent because it has shown positive effects in both homogeneous [46] and heterogeneous Pd-catalyzed oxidation reactions [47]. Although 2a was not obtained, cinnamaldehyde (2b), as an anti-Markovnikov selective product, and phenylacetone (2c), as a Wacker oxidation product, were detected (Table 1 , entry 1). According to our previous work that supported Pd(OH)2 as a practical catalyst for CH bond functionalization [38], ZrO2-supported Pd(OH)2 was employed for the reaction and conferred 2a in 37% yield (Table 1, entry 2). Inspired by this finding, various metal oxide-supported Pd(OH)2 catalysts were evaluated by the turnover numbers (TONs) based on the amount of Pd added and the anti-Markovnikov selectivity of the products under the same reaction conditions. Relatively acidic metal oxide-supported Pd catalysts, such as Pd(OH)2/Al2O3 and Pd(OH)2/TiO2, gave poor material balance (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). In particular, Pd(OH)2/Al2O3 could promote the reaction with a high TON, while the selectivity for 2a was poor due to the formation of a large amount of 2c and other polymerized compounds. When MgO and ZnO were selected as the basic supports for Pd(OH)2, low TONs and product yields were obtained, although the formation of 2c could be efficiently inhibited (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Among these catalysts, Pd(OH)2/CeO2 displayed good activity and provided the anti-Markovnikov selective products in better yield than the other catalysts (Table 1, entry 7). Therefore, the acid-base property of metal oxides notably influences the reactivity and product selectivity, but other factors cannot be neglected. Direct addition of a base or an acid to adjust the acid-base property of the reaction was examined. However, neither inorganic nor organic base improved the yield, and the conversion of 1 was markedly decreased when a base was introduced (see, Supplementary Information, Table S1, entries 1–4). Benzoquinones, which are known as useful oxidants to promote the functionalization of CH bonds over homogeneous Pd catalysts, were effective in improving the conversion and selectivity to primary alcohol 2a (Table 1, entries 8 and 9). This result suggested that the oxidant played an important role in facilitating the reaction. Thus, the reaction was performed by increasing the pressure of oxygen to 2.0 MPa, and 92% of 1 was converted with better primary alcohol selectivity (Table 1, entry 10). Interestingly, when CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide (40% CeO2 component) was used as the support, the reaction proceeded smoothly to afford 2a in 59% yield with total 85% of anti-Markovnikov selective products (Table 1, entry 11). We compared the catalytic activity of supported Pd(OH)2, PdO, and Pd(NO3)2 on the same support. Specifically, the Pd(NO3)2 precursor was simply adsorbed on CeO2-ZrO2 to form Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2, and PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 was prepared by calcined at 300 °C. These catalysts were tested under the same reaction conditions as entry 11. We confirmed that the TON was sharply decreased after calcination treatment (Table 1, entry 12). However, Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 surprisingly showed better activity than Pd(OH)2/CeO2-ZrO2 (Table 1, entry 13). Product 2a was obtained in 77% yield over Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2, and the total anti-Markovnikov selectivity reached 91%. The TON was calculated to be 39, suggesting that CeO2-ZrO2-supported Pd(NO3)2 is the suitable catalyst for converting allylbenzene. Very recently, Jiang and co-workers developed a homogeneous process for the synthesis of 2a from 1 catalyzed by PdCl2 [27], but the TON of their catalyst was only 9, and the turnover frequency of their catalyst was also lower than Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 (0.38 h−1 vs. 0.81 h−1). Most importantly, a large amount of HCl, which not only causes reactor corrosion but also lowers product selectivity by generating chlorinated byproducts, was required in their process. The use of Pd(NO3)2 resulted in no desired products, forming Pd black precipitates in the reaction mixture (Table 1, entry 14). In addition, CeO2-ZrO2 was also examined for this reaction, but no target product was formed (Table 1, entry 15). These results demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Pd(NO3)2 was significantly improved when supported on CeO2-ZrO2. When Pd(NO3)2 combined with CeO2-ZrO2 was used, only a 4% yield of 2c was obtained (Table 1, entry 16). Furthermore, the full conversion of 1 was achieved by adjusting the pressure of O2 and the amount of Pd; 92% of the anti-Markovnikov selective products were obtained (Table 1, entry 17). A brief exploration of substrate generality suggested that the introduction of substituents on the aromatic ring of 1 decreased reactivity, especially when bulky or electron-withdrawing groups were placed. Further optimization is required for each substrate. Notably, we confirmed that a formal anti-Markovnikov hydration could be attained via a tandem O2-H2 redox step over the 5 wt% Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. Allylbenzene was also used as the substrate under the optimized reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 13). After O2 was released, no additional catalyst was required for the hydrogenation step; the reactor was sealed with 0.5 MPa of H2 followed by heating at 60 °C for 3 h, and the reaction gave 3-phenylpropan-1-ol in 89% total yield from cinnamyl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde. Phenylacetone could not be reduced in the second step (Scheme 2 )."
10,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of the catalysts The generation of Pd particles was not observed by HAADF-STEM studies for CeO2-ZrO2-supported Pd catalysts, because Pd and CeO2 or CeO2-ZrO2 could not be distinguished due to the high atomic weight of Ce (see, Supplementary Information, Fig. S1). Additionally, the presence of elements of Pd, Zr, and Ce was verified by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. To observe the crystal structure of several CeO2-ZrO2-supported Pd catalysts, XRD measurements were performed. In contrast to ZrO2, the structure of CeO2-ZrO2 was close to that of CeO2 (see, Supplementary Information, Fig. S2) [48–52]. In addition, the diffraction peaks of Pd were not observed for the prepared catalysts including Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2, Pd(OH)2/CeO2-ZrO2, and PdO/CeO2-ZrO2, suggesting that these Pd species were highly dispersed on the supports (see, Supplementary Information, Fig. S3). When the 5 wt% PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 was reduced by pure H2, the diffraction peak at 40° was assigned to the (111) plane of metallic Pd was confirmed (PDF-2 database, No. 00-001-1310) (Fig. S3d) [53]. To investigate the structure of the supported Pd(NO3)2, the catalyst was characterized by XAFS with the reference Pd foil, PdO, Pd(OH)2, and Pd(NO3)2. The Pd K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectral feature of Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 resembled that of unsupported Pd(NO3)2 compared to those of PdO and Pd(OH)2 in which the peak at 24.37 keV was more obvious (Fig. 1 ). A slight difference between Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 and unsupported Pd(NO3)2 might be due to the interaction of Pd(NO3)2 with the oxide support [54,55]. In addition, the k 3-weighted Pd K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations patterns of Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 was also similar to that of unsupported Pd(NO3)2 and different from that of PdO and Pd(OH)2 (Fig. 2 ). In the radial structure functions (RSF) (Fig. 3 ), two peaks were mainly observed at about 1.53 Å and 3.0 Å in PdO and Pd(OH)2. The peak in the range of 1.07–1.99 Å, which was attributed to Pd–O (first nearest-neighbor atoms) coordination, was observed in both Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 and unsupported Pd(NO3)2. The structure parameters for Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 obtained by curve-fitting analysis using the structure model of Pd(NO3)2 (see, Supplementary Information, Tables S2 and S3). The coordination number for the first shell of Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 was 3.840 ± 1.013, which is close to the model Pd(NO3)2. The results supported the similarity of both materials. Moreover, the peak at about 3.0 Å (phase-uncorrected), which corresponded to the interaction of Pd(O)Pd for the second coordination shell [56–60], was not observed in neither Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 nor unsupported Pd(NO3)2. In addition, the peak at about 2.5 Å corresponding to the interaction of PdPd was not observed in all these samples except Pd foil. Although the interaction between Pd(NO3)2 and the support could not be completely neglected, these spectral features indicated Pd(NO3)2 is probably deposited as it is on Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2. Moreover, the character of the deposited Pd(NO3)2 on CeO2-ZrO2 was studied by other chemisorption methods including CO2-TPD and TPO. In the previous report, activation of the CH bond of a terminal alkene was regarded as the rate-determining step in several Pd-catalyzed allylic CH oxidation reactions, and the basicity of the catalytic system is crucial to promote the reaction [61]. In that regard, CO2-TPD was employed to investigate the basicity of CeO2-ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2-supported Pd catalysts in Fig. 4 . Firstly, the CO2 desorption peak (m/z = 44) was observed for CeO2-ZrO2 at about 100 °C, revealed that the basic site was present on this support. These desorption peaks were observed on both Pd(OH)2/CeO2-ZrO2 and Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2, and a decrease in peak intensity on PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 might be caused by the calcination procedure. New peaks were observed on the catalysts in the range from 450 to 550 °C, suggesting that a new basic site was formed after the deposition of Pd species (Fig. 4b–d). Interestingly, another new desorption peak was observed by using Pd(NO3)2 as the precursor in the range from 220 to 280 °C for Pd(OH)2/CeO2-ZrO2 and Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 with high intensity. It is reasonable that the basic sites were increased on the CeO2-ZrO2 supported Pd(OH)2. However, according to the XAFS results, the structure of Pd(NO3)2 almost retained intact after the deposition onto the support. Therefore, the CO2-TPD profile using m/z = 44 (CO2 or N2O) likewise have the possibility for desorption of the nitrate group. To this regard, the mass analysis for m/z = 30 (NO) and m/z = 46 (NO2) was carried out. Despite the fact that the desorption peak of NO2 was not observed (Fig. 5 , Dash dot), the desorption peak of NO was detected from 120 to 250 °C (Fig. 5, Square dot), which is close to the peak for m/z = 44. As a consequence, the basic sites might be increased on 5 wt% Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2, although the high intensity of the desorption peaks on Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 is still unclear. Besides, Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 was tested under TPO conditions mainly because O2 is essential to promote the reactions as explained. The peak for m/z = 30 (NO) was observed in a wide range from 100 to 450 °C, and the peak for m/z = 44 (N2O) was confirmed from 180 to 350 °C (see, Supplementary Information, Fig. S4). These results indicated that the decomposition of Pd(NO3)2 supported on CeO2-ZrO2 was occurred above 100 °C, furnishing the possibility for preserving the catalyst in a stable structure under the aerobic conditions. To study the reaction pathway for the transformation of allylbenzene into cinnamyl alcohol, the effect of O2, H2O, and DMSO were investigated. First, a control experiment under the conditions of entry 13 in Table 1 was performed in the absence of O2, and only trace amounts of products were obtained, revealing that O2 is indispensable for promoting the reaction. Moreover, the recovered catalysts were analyzed by XRD (Fig. 6 ). A diffraction peak at 40° was observed for the catalyst recovered from the reaction mixture in the absence of O2, indicating that the removal of nitrate groups and the aggregation of Pd species could cause a decrease in the catalytic activity. Thus, O2 acts as a re-oxidizing agent for these Pd species. Since no product was observed under the conditions without H2O, H2O was confirmed as a reactant to assist the reaction. In addition, an isotope labeling experiment was carried out for entry 13 in Table 1 using water-18O (97 atom% 18O). As seen by GCMS analysis, all the products contained more than 60 atom% 18O after the reaction, suggesting that water-18O served as a nucleophile to react with allylbenzene, and oxygen atom exchange occurred between H2O and O2 (see, Supplementary Information, Scheme S2). On the basis of the previous reports, the oxidative cleavage of an allylic CH bond could be directly promoted by the Pd catalyst with strong Lewis acidity, such as PdCl2 and Pd(OAc)2. We anticipated that 1 was activated by supported Pd(NO3)2 to form a π-allyl Pd intermediate, followed by the addition of H2O to the terminal position to give 2a as the major product (Scheme 1). To slow down the aggregation of Pd, CeO2-ZrO2 was screened as a suitable support to maintain the Pd(NO3)2 species during the reaction. The basic surface of CeO2-ZrO2 might contribute to neutralize HNO3 formed in the initial step. Also, the catalyst and intermediate were stabilized by using DMSO as the solvent [48], and O2 acted as a vital role in the regeneration of Pd(II) species. The recycling test of Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 for the transformation of allylbenzene into the primary alcohol was performed. Unfortunately, the catalytic activity was dramatically decreased in the second run for the reaction. In addition, the fresh and the spent catalysts were analyzed by XAFS (see, Supplementary Information, Figs. S5 and S6). The generation of Pd(0) was clearly observed in the spent catalyst [62]. Therefore, we consider that the deactivation of the catalyst was probably caused by the aggregation of Pd(NO3)2 into Pd(0) particles, although CeO2-ZrO2-supported Pd(NO3)2 exhibited better stability than the unsupported Pd(NO3)2, which was more easily aggregate to form Pd black precipitates during the reaction, resulting in much lower catalytic activity than Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2."
11,"Transformation of 1,3-butadiene into the corresponding primary alcohol","3.3 Transformation of 1,3-butadiene into the corresponding primary alcohol Next, we focused on the applicability of our catalysts to an industrial process. The transformation of 1,3-butadiene into butane-1,4-diol, which is widely used as a substrate for the production of various compounds with annual commercial scales of a million tons, has been particularly discussed [63]. In contrast to previous methods using acetylene and formaldehyde as the starting materials, 1,3-butadiene was regarded as the desired material for producing butane-1,4-diol. Mitsubishi Chemical has implemented a process to synthesize butane-1,4-diol from 1,3-butadiene. However, 1,3-butadiene has to undergo diacetoxylation to afford but-2-ene-1,4-diyl diacetate at the first stage, and three total steps are required, as described previously. To save energy and reduce the reaction steps, we attempted to explore a new approach in which 1,3-butadiene directly reacts with H2O to build 2-butene-1,4-diol and then provide butane-1,4-diol by a simple hydrogenation in a “one-pot” manner. At first, the reactions were performed in an autoclave, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . According to the analysis of the reaction mixture, trans-2-butene-1,4-diol (4a), 3-butene-1,2-diol (4b), and trans-4-hydroxybut-2-enal (4c) were detected as the main products. The cis isomers of the products and other ketone byproducts such as methyl vinyl ketone were not observed in this process. Additionally, telomerization byproducts, such as 2,7-octadien-1-ol, were not formed over the supported Pd catalysts. The amount of 1,3-butadiene was measured by weighing. The GC yields and TONs were calculated based on the amount of H2O added. Using CeO2-ZrO2-supported Pd(NO3)2 as the catalyst and DMSO as the solvent, 4a could be obtained in more than 30% yield, but the yields of 4b and 4c were also high (Table 2 , entry 1). When ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and 1,4-dioxane were used, the yield and selectivity of 4a were not satisfactory (Table 2, entries 2 and 4). The reaction proceeded well in MeOH to allow the production of 4a with relatively high selectivity, accordingly, the TON was calculated to be 148 (Table 2, entry 5). The contrast experiment results showed that the lower reaction temperature tends to improve the selectivity of primary alcohol, although the TON reached 178 in entry 6 (Table 2, entry 5 vs. entry 6). Therefore, the reaction conditions in entry 5 were chosen as the optimized conditions to synthesize butane-1,4-diol. As described in Scheme 3 , compounds 4a and 4c could be reduced by H2 to give butane-1,4-diol (4d) in 54% yield, and butane-1,2-diol (4e) was observed as the byproduct. Although Kuznetsova et al. reported a similar process for the transformation of 3 over PdTe/C, the reactions were performed at 90–100 °C to give 4a in moderate yields [28]. Therefore, Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 not only provided a mild and efficient synthetic method for the synthesis of 4a but also realized the direct production of 4d from 3 through a “one-pot” process for the first time. In addition, the reactivities of 1,3-butadiene and allylbenzene over a supported Pd catalyst was disunity, because Pd(OH)2/CeO2 and even Pd/CeO2 enabled the efficient transformation of 1,3-butadiene into 4a (Table 2, entries 7 and 8), suggesting that control of the product selectivity will be the considerable subject for each substrate. Furthermore, a continuous gas flow reactor was developed to promote the direct reaction between 1,3-butadiene and H2O. First, 1,3-butadiene was refrigerated at 0 °C to obtained its liquefied form, then injected with H2O into a vaporizer and introduced into a reactor containing 100 mg Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 (see, Supplementary Information, Fig. S7). The reaction was performed at 80 °C for 4 h, affording 4a and 4b as the major products. However, during the reaction, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene was difficult to avoid, although an inhibitor, such as hydroquinone or 4-tert-butylcatechol, was employed. Consequently, we replaced pure 1,3-butadiene with a mixed gas containing 0.78% 1,3-butadiene in N2 for optimizing the reaction conditions in our gas flow reactor (Table 3). Pressurized air was used instead of O2 due to safety concerns for industrial production. In this reaction, the mixed 1,3-butadiene gas directly reacted with H2O in the presence of the catalyst, and the reaction mixture was analyzed every 2 h to evaluate the catalytic activity by calculating the space-time yield (STY). By comparison with Pd/ZrO2 and Pd(OH)2/CeO2-ZrO2, Pd(NO3)2/CeO2-ZrO2 was deemed suitable for primary alcohol synthesis (Table 3, entries 1–3). Unlike the batch reactor, product 4c was not detected in the gas flow reactor; additionally, a much better selectivity of 4a was confirmed, and the STY reached 766 mmol/kg-cat ∙ h for the initial 2 h at 80 °C (Table 3, entry 2). We also tested the reaction under 0.1 MPa air or at 60 °C. The yields were dramatically decreased for all products (Table 3, entries 4 and 5). The relatively low temperature and good selectivity provide a promising alternative for the production of butane-1,4-diol with sophisticated instruments. In this study, it is interesting that the telomerization of 1,3-butadiene was completely inhibited in the reactions catalyzed by these supported Pd species, while the telomerization byproduct is generated in a notable quantity from a bis-π-allyl Pd intermediate when homogeneous catalysts are used [31]. However, as mentioned above, only trans-2-butene-1,4-diol was observed during the product analyses. We considered that the specific adsorption structure of 1,3-butadiene on the catalyst probably led to these features. Since supported Pd(0) catalyst also promoted the transformation of 1,3-butadiene to form 4a and 4b (Table 2, entry 8 and Table 3, entry 1) as well as supported Pd(II) catalyzed reactions, the adsorption structure of 1,3-butadiene on the Pd single-crystal surface was subsequently investigated by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) on the clean Pd(111) surface. Fig. 7 shows an IRAS for the Pd(111) surface exposed to 1,3-butadiene of 15 L (1 L = 1 × 10–6 Torr/s) from approximately -153.15 (120 K) to 426.85 °C (700 K). At -153.15 °C, peaks due to out-of-plane bending vibrations of ω(CH2) and τ(CH2) were observed at 912 and 1018 cm−1, respectively. Accordingly, these peaks were confirmed at 26.85 (300 K) and 226.85 °C (500 K), and the intensities decreased with increasing temperature. These results suggested that the adsorption structure of 1,3-butadiene on the Pd(111) surface was almost identical over a wide temperature range. In addition, 1,3-butadiene was desorbed when the temperature arrived at 426.85 °C (700 K). On the other hand, peaks for the stretching vibrations of CC, CC, CH, and CH2 were observed in addition to peaks of ω(CH2) and τ(CH2) in the high-resolution electron energy loss spectrum of 1,3-butadiene adsorbed on the Pd(110) surface [64]. In IRAS, the vibration mode parallel to the surface was not detected due to the surface selection rule. Therefore, no peaks corresponding to stretching vibrations of CC, CC, CH, or CH2 were observed in the IRAS (Fig. 7), indicating that the molecular plane of 1,3-butadiene adsorbed on the Pd(111) surface was parallel to the surface. Moreover, the wavenumbers of ω(CH2) and τ(CH2) observed in this study are close to those reported for 1,3-butadiene adsorbed in the s-trans form on Au(111) (ω(CH2): 916 cm−1, τ(CH2): 1007 cm−1) [65], suggesting that 1,3-butadiene adsorbed on Pd(111) has an adsorption structure in the s-trans form. In addition, we investigated the adsorption of 1,3-butadiene on Pd(111) pre-adsorbed with oxygen (θO = 0.25), which was produced by exposing O2 to 100 L in the same temperature range. A θ value of 1 corresponds to a Pd(111) surface atom density of 1.53 × 1015 atoms/cm2. IRAS measurements were performed for the O/Pd(111) surface exposed to 1,3-butadiene under the same conditions as the clean Pd(111) surface. As a result, absorption peaks of ω(CH2) (911 cm−1) and τ(CH2) (1017 cm−1) were observed at −153.15 °C, and these peaks could be detected until the temperature reached 226.85 °C (Fig. 8 ). The wavenumbers of these peaks are in good agreement with those observed for a clean Pd(111) surface (Fig. 7), demonstrating that co-adsorbed oxygen had no influence on the adsorption structure of 1,3-butadiene on the Pd surface. That is, the electronic states of surface Pd are cationic, but there is no change in the adsorption states of 1,3-butadiene. Next, the thermal reactivities of 1,3-butadiene adsorbed on clean Pd(111) and O/Pd(111) surfaces were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). At -153.15 °C, the C1s peak was observed at 285.1 eV on both surfaces, which was attributed to the carbon of 1,3-butadiene [66]. When both surfaces were heated from -153.15 °C to 26.85 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, the peak area decreased, but the peak position was maintained, indicating that some of the adsorbed 1,3-butadiene desorbed. On the clean Pd(111) surface, when the temperature was increased to 226.85 °C (500 K), the peak shifted to lower binding energy (Fig. 9 ). This indicates that the decomposition of 1,3-butadiene occurred. At approximately 426.85 °C, a peak was observed at 284.6 eV, due to the atomic carbon formed by the dehydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. When the temperature was further increased to 726.85 °C (1000 K), the peak disappeared, as the atomic carbon migrated into the Pd bulk. On the other hand, a peak for atomic carbon (∼284.7 eV) was observed at 126.85 °C (400 K) on the O/Pd(111) surface (Fig. 10 ). That is, atomic carbon was formed on the O/Pd(111) surface at a lower temperature than on the clean Pd(111) surface. We confirmed that pre-adsorbed oxygen remains on this surface. Therefore, we consider that the formation of atomic carbon by the dehydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene was promoted due to the change in the electronic states of surface Pd atoms by the adsorbed oxygen. The reaction pathway for the transformation of 1,3-butadiene with H2O was speculated (Fig. 11 ). According to the results of the product analyses and surface experiments, 1,3-butadiene might be adsorbed on the supported Pd catalyst in the s-trans form, and one H2O molecule was initially added to the terminal position to afford a π-allyl Pd intermediate. Then, the π-allyl Pd intermediate on the metal oxide was attacked by another H2O molecule to give 2b as a major product, and 2c was formed as a minor product due to the steric effect. The adsorption structure of the s-cis form was not observed in our surface experiments, and the corresponding products were not detected either. The formation of the telomerization product was successfully inhibited over the supported Pd catalysts."
12,Conclusion,"In conclusion, an atom-efficient approach for the direct synthesis of primary alcohols from terminal alkenes and H2O is established in this work. Using environmentally benign O2 and H2 as the sole oxidant and reductant, respectively, resulted in the formation of H2O as the only theoretical byproduct. Achievement of the products with high anti-Markovnikov selectivity successfully shorten the steps in comparison to conventional synthesis route. CeO2-ZrO2-supported Pd(NO3)2 was found to be an efficient catalyst for transform allylbenzene into cinnamyl alcohol. The final product, 3-phenylpropan-1-ol, could be obtained from a one-pot sequence in good yield. The analyses of the catalyst revealed that the highly dispersed molecular Pd(NO3)2 on CeO2-ZrO2 possibly acted significant role to promote this reaction. Unfortunately, the catalytic activity was significantly decreased in the recycling test caused by the formation of Pd(0) particles during the reaction. In addition, the catalyst allowed the production of trans-butane-1,4-diol from 1,3-butadiene in a batch reactor. The adsorption structure of 1,3-butadiene on Pd(111) was confirmed as s-trans by IRAS observations. Finally, a continuous gas flow reactor was successfully developed to achieve good anti-Markovnikov selectivity for the transformation of 1,3-butadiene into trans-2-butene-1,4-diol. These reactions were generally carried out under relatively mild conditions, and thus possess the remarkable potential for industrial applications. Further studies on the reaction mechanism and general feasibility of substrates are in progress."
