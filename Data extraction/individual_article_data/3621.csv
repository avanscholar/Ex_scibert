0,Introduction,"Reliable gas sensors are important for detecting or monitoring the concentrations of certain atmospheric gases to ensure everyday safety or during modern industrial production processes [1–4]. Metal oxides have been widely applied as gas sensors due to their easy preparation, low cost, high sensor responses, and promising response/recovery times [5–7]. For example, a gas sensor based on a vertically-aligned ZnO nanorod architecture was reported to be sensitive to 500 ppm C2H5OH with a sensor response of 5 at 260 °C [8]. Zeng et al. fabricated a multilayer nest-like TiO2 nanostructure with a sensor response to approximately 25–500 ppm C2H5OH at 350 °C [9]. The work of the Shen et al. showed that the WO3-based microspheres could be a sensing material to exhibit promising NO2 sensing performance at 50 °C [10]. Also, the NO2 was reported to be effectively detected by the bimetallic Au/Pd nanoparticles decorated ZnO nanowires, the Au@WO3 core-shell structured nanospheres, the In2O3 nanorod arrays, the ZnO nanowires with Pd functionalization or the ZnO nanowires functionalized with ultra-fine In2O3 nanoparticles [11–15]. The one-dimensional ZnO nanorods were found to show a high sensor response of 44.9 towards ethanol at 300 °C [16]. Meanwhile, a nanostructured ZnO thin film and a TiO2 nanoparticle thin film were found to be sensitive towards NO2 and H2S, respectively [17,18]. SnO2 microspheres prepared by a hydrothermal method showed a promising sensor response to 38.3–100 ppm HCHO at 200 °C [19]. A sensor based on In2O3 composites was also found to be sensitive to 50 ppm of triethylamine gas [20]. Based on the reported results, metal oxides appear to be promising high-performance gas sensing materials. Hydrogen gas (H2) is a renewable energy source and is a possible alternative to over-consumed traditional fossil fuels.It has already been applied in liquid propellant rockets, new energy vehicles, fuel cells, and various industrial products [21–24]. Nevertheless, the diameter of the hydrogen molecule (0.41 nm) allows it to easily leak from fuel cells, posing a high risk of explosion when its concentration reaches 4% in the air [25,26]. Metal oxides have been reported to be effective materials for use in hydrogen gas sensors. Wu et al. assembled a mesoporous WO3-based sensor with a sensor response of 11.89 and a short response time of approximately 10 s towards 5000 ppm H2 at room temperature [24]. ZnO nanostructures were reported to be effective for detecting hydrogen gas at 180 °C [27]. Wang et al. applied a thermal oxidation method to synthesize uniform Nb2O5 nanowires, showing sensitive performance towards 1000 ppm H2 with a short response time at room temperature [28]. A modified SnO2 thin film also showed a high sensor response of 59.04 towards 2000 ppm H2 at 225 °C [29]. According to these previous researches, a sensor based on metal oxides may be effective for sensing or monitoring hydrogen gas. Orthorhombic molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO3) is a typical transition metal oxide, with a unique layered structure composed of two-layer corner/edge/face-sharing MoO6 octahedra along the [001] direction [30]. Some studies have reported the gas-sensing performance of nanostructured MoO3. For example, Sadek et al. prepared lamellar MoO3, which showed a sensor response of approximately 1.3 towards 1% H2 [31]. MoO3 nanorods, synthesized via a probe ultrasonic route by Luo et al., were reported to be effective for detecting 40 ppm NO2 at 180 °C, with a sensor response of 8.1 [32]. Three-dimensional flower-like MoO3 exhibited a promising gas sensing performance towards 100 ppm triethylamine at 250 °C [33]. More recently, modifying MoO3 with a dopant was reported to be an effective method for inducing oxygen vacancies in MoO3, which enhanced its gas-sensing behavior. Chen et al. synthesized Zn-doped MoO3 nanobelts via a hydrothermal route, and their sensor response to 1000 ppm ethanol was 15-times higher than that of pure MoO3 at 240 °C [34]. The sensor response of the MoO3 nanobelts (approximately 125) towards 100 ppm H2S increased to 378.5 at 300 °C by constructing Cd-doped nanobelts. W-doped MoO3 nanobelts, Ni-doped MoO3 nanolamellae, and Y-doped MoO3 nanoarrays have also been reported to be more effective substrates for sensing trimethylamine, formaldehyde, and xylene, respectively, compared with pure MoO3-based materials [35–37]. MoO3 doped with metal atoms was shown to be more sensitive to targeted gases than bare MoO3. Fe doping is another effective strategy for enhancing the gas sensing performance of metal oxides, and Fe(III)-doped NiO microspheres were reported to be more sensitive to 100 ppm butanol than bare NiO nanostructures [38]. The sensor response of hierarchical Fe-doped Co3O4 nanostructures towards 100 ppm xylene was improved to 18.2 from the original 2.7 of pure Co3O4. The sensor response of Fe-doped ZnO nanosheet-spheres to 10 ppm HCHO was also 15-times higher than that of bare ZnO [39]. However, few references have reported the improved hydrogen sensing performance of Fe-doped MoO3 nanostructures at room temperature. In this paper, we synthesized a series of Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons through a facile hydrothermal process. The phases and morphologies of the obtained samples were studied and compared to investigate the effects of Fe doping the MoO3 nanoribbons. The specific surface areas of the modified MoO3 nanoribbons and the valence states of the elements in the nanoribbons were also systematically explored. We investigated the hydrogen sensing performance of sensors based on MoO3 nanoribbons doped with different concentrations of Fe. Meanwhile, the repeatability, the response stability, and the selectivity of the nanoribbons to H2 were also studied. The hydrogen gas sensing mechanism of the modified MoO3 was discussed in detail based on our experimental results and the first-principles DFT calculations."
1,Experimental sections,
2,Fabrication of Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons,"2.1 Fabrication of Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons A one-step hydrothermal method was used to synthesize doped MoO3 nanoribbons using Na2MoO4·2H2O (the source of Mo), HNO3, and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (the source of Fe). In a typical procedure, 2.4195 g of pure Na2MoO4·2H2O was placed into 32.75 ml of deionized water with continued magnetic stirring until Na2MoO4·2H2O was completely dissolved. Then, 6.25 ml of HNO3 was added to the above solution. Finally, different amounts of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.0808 g, 0.1616 g, 0.2424 g, 0.3232 g, and 0.4040 g) were added to the solution (the molar ratios of Fe/Mo were 2 at%, 4 at%, 6 at%, 8 at%, and 10 at%, respectively). The precursor was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C for approximately 12 h. The products were obtained after filtering and washing the samples with deionized water and alcohol several times. The collected products were dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the final samples."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The phases of the obtained samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8A25) with the 2θ range of 10–70° under 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM7100F) was used to investigate the morphology of the synthesized powders. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted with a VG ESCALAB-MK electron spectrometer using aluminum Kα radiation. The Raman spectra were recorded with a Micro Raman Spectrometer (with an integrated atomic force microscope, AFM, Veeco Nanoscope VIII). The specific surface areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms measured using a surface area and porosity system (Beckman Coulter SA3100)."
4,Sensor fabrication and measurement,"2.3 Sensor fabrication and measurement In the first step, we mixed the collected powders with alcohol to form a paste. Then, the obtained paste was dropped onto the center of a pair of comb-like electrodes composed of Pt-Ti alloy (80%/20% by thickness) with a 120 nm thickness on a clean quartz substrate (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm). In the following step, the half-finished sensor was further heated in a quartz tube at 300 °C for 2 h in a vacuum. The final sensor was obtained when it was cooled to room temperature naturally. The variation in the resistance of the assembled sensors in the air or a target gas at 26 °C was recorded in real-time by a multimeter (Keithley 2400) to study their gas sensing performances at a working voltage of 1.5 V. A homemade measurement system with a testing container was applied throughout the entire testing process. There were two separated flowmeters and several electromagnetic block valves in the gas way to control the gas flow rates. The concentration of the tested gas was adjusted by setting the gas flow rates of the two separated flowmeters and the injection time of the target gas. The gas-sensing performance of the assembled sensor was studied by analyzing changes in the resistance towards 10–1500 ppm hydrogen. Meanwhile, the selectivity of the sensor was also investigated by comparing its gas sensing performance towards 500 ppm carbon monoxide (CO), ethanol (C2H5OH), acetone (CH3COCH3), propanol (C3H7OH), methanol (CH3OH), or toluene (C6H5CH3). The concentration of CO was prepared by setting the flow rate of CO and dry air to 1 sccm and 10 sccm, respectively. For the other interfering gases, we placed a solution of ethanol, acetone, propanol, methanol, or toluene with known volumes in a small crucible. Then, the solutions were evaporated inside the testing chamber to study the sensing performance of the assembled sensor to the interfering gases (C2H5OH, CH3COCH3, C3H7OH, CH3OH, and C6H5CH3)."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Characterization of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons,"3.1 Characterization of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons The recorded XRD patterns of all obtained samples were arranged and displayed in Fig. 1a. All the peaks in the patterns were sharp and distinct, indicating the high crystallinity of the collected products [40]. Further study revealed that the recorded peaks of all samples were well-indexed to the standard JPCDS card 05-0508, meaning that all obtained samples were based on orthorhombic MoO3 (α-MoO3) [41]. Moreover, no peaks belonging to any impurities were detected. The peaks in the samples moved to lower degrees upon increasing the Fe doping concentration, confirmed by the shifts in the (110), (040), and (021) peaks in Fig. 1b. There might be distortions in the crystal lattice of the samples due to differences in the radii of MO6+ and Fen+ dopant (where n can be 2 or 3), which was consistent with previous results for Fe-doped WO3 [42]. Moreover, the colors of the samples became increasingly yellowish upon increasing the Fe dopant concentration (Fig. S1), which were quite different than undoped MoO3 (being white) [43,44]. These results also implied that Fe was successfully incorporated into the MoO3 lattice [45,46]. The SEM images of the obtained MoO3-based samples were displayed in Fig. 2. All samples presented typical ribbon-like morphologies, implying that the obtained products were Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons. The average lengths of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons were inversely related to the concentration of the Fe dopant (Fig. 2f). The 2 at%, 4 at%, and 6 at% Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons were 2.73 µm, 2.56 µm, and 2.27 µm, respectively. The short length of the modified samples might be due to the distortions in the crystal lattice of MoO3, which prevented the nanoribbons from growing along the [010] direction as effectively as pure MoO3 [46,47]. Moreover, the 8 at% or 10 at% Fe-doped MoO3 also showed ribbon-like structures with average lengths of 1.47 µm and 1.14 µm, respectively. The modified MoO3 nanoribbons tended to agglomerate with each other due to their small sizes, especially when the concentration of the Fe dopant increased to 8 at% or 10 at%. Similar results were also reported in a study of iron and copper mixed oxide nanopowders, TiO2 nanoparticles, and Si-doped LiNi0.5Mn0.5−xSixO2 cathode materials [48–50]. Next, we explored the Raman spectra of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons, as shown in Fig. 3. There were three typical sharp peaks in all samples, located at central Raman shifts of 662 cm−1, 818 cm−1, and 991 cm−1, respectively. These three distinct peaks were characteristic signals of the stretching modes of MO3‒O, Mo2‒O, and Mo6+˭O in MoO3, respectively, further indicating the orthorhombic structure of the prepared Fe-doped samples [51,52]. In addition, the I 818 /I 991 ratio can be used to investigate the effects of Fe doping on the MoO3 nanoribbons, where I 819 and I 991 represent the intensity of the peaks at 819 cm−1 and 991 cm−1, respectively. It was found that I 819 /I 991 showed a negative relationship with the Fe dopant content. The values of I 818 /I 991 were 3.26, 2.74, 2.14, 2.04, and 1.81 for the S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, respectively, which were all lower than that of pure MoO3 (6.36) reported in a previous paper [53]. These results imply that oxygen vacancies may have formed in the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons, in good agreement with previous studies [54,55]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to explore the chemical composition of the surface or near-surface zones in 6 at% Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons (S3). The XPS spectra of Mo, O, and Fe in sample S3 are displayed in Fig. 4. We found that the peaks of Mo (3d5/2 and 3d3/2) were fitted with two pairs of smaller peaks with combined Gaussian/Lorentzian functions, as shown in Fig. 4a. The dominant peaks located at 232.5 eV and 235.9 eV could be indexed to Mo6+ in the MoO3 nanoribbons [36,56]. The other peaks located at lower binding energies were nonstoichiometric Mo ions (Mo5+) in the MoO3 nanoribbons [57]. The concentration of Mo5+ in sample S3 was only 14.8%. Interestingly, the XPS O 1s core-level spectrum could also be fitted by two separate peaks at 530.3 eV and 531.6 eV (as displayed in Fig. 4b), which were indexed to the lattice oxygen in the modified MoO3 and chemisorbed oxygen species (O chem ) on the surface of Fe-doped MoO3, respectively [58]. The concentration of O chem in sample S3 was calculated to be approximately 34.6%, which was much higher than that of Mo5+. In Fig. 4c, the XPS Fe 2p core-level spectrum was composed of two separate peaks at 711.8 eV and 724.9 eV, which indicated that Fe3+ was present in the sample [56]. The obtained results, combined with the XRD and Raman spectra of the samples, confirmed that Fe was successfully doped into MoO3, which induced the formation of the oxygen vacancies in modified MoO3 [34]. Dopants in metal oxides have been reported to greatly improve the adsorption and ionization of oxygen molecules on their surfaces [57]. Therefore, the Fe3+ in the doped MoO3 nanoribbons may be the predominant adsorption sites for oxygen molecules, which is possibly the reason for the high concentration of O chem in the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all obtained samples were investigated to fully understand the effects of Fe doping on the MoO3 nanoribbons, as shown in Fig. 5 . Type-IV isotherms, a typical characteristic of mesoporous materials, were obtained for all Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons. The specific surface areas of S1, S2, and S3 were calculated to be 20.66 m2/g, 27.97 m2/g, and 43.55 m2/g, respectively, based on the obtained nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. Then, the specific surface areas of S4 and S5 dramatically decreased to 23.26 m2/g and 15.79 m2/g, respectively, which might be due to significant agglomeration of the samples [48–50]. As previously reported, mesoporous sensing materials with a large specific surface area have shown promising gas sensing performance [42]. As a result, the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons might exhibit interesting hydrogen gas sensing properties at room temperature."
7,Gas sensing performances of Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons,"3.2 Gas sensing performances of Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons Next, we assembled gas sensors from all obtained samples using the same process to study their gas sensing performances to hydrogen gas at room temperature (approximately 26 °C) with a relative humidity (RH) of 40% (inside the testing chamber). The gas sensor response (S) of the assembled gas sensors was calculated as S = R a /R g , where R g (R a ) is the resistance of the sensor in the target gas (in the air) [59]. The response time (t res ) or the recovery time (t rec ) of the sensor was defined as the time for the resistance to change by 90% during response or recovery, respectively. We assembled several devices at one time and processed the samples under the same conditions. Then, the sensing performance of the obtained gas sensor was studied to investigate the hydrogen sensing properties of Fe-doped MoO3. We compared the sensing properties of the devices and further improved the method to synthesize Fe-doped MoO3 and the process to assemble the sensor used to obtain the final device with promising sensing performance provided in our paper. The sensors based on samples S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 were named G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5, respectively. The dynamic hydrogen sensing properties of all assembled sensors to 500 ppm H2 are shown in Fig. 6. The results clearly show that the resistances of all assembled sensors decreased rapidly when the hydrogen gas was injected into the testing chamber and then increased quickly after the sensors were placed back into the air. As previously reported, the decrease in the resistance of metal oxide in the presence of a reducing analyte suggests that the sensing material shows n-type gas sensing behavior [60,61]. The rapid decrease in the resistance of the sensor based on Fe-doped MoO3 indicated that our sensors exhibited a typical n-type sensing response to H2. The S of the MoO3 nanoribbons increased upon increasing the concentration of the Fe dopant to 6 at% but decreased upon further increasing the doping concentration of Fe. Specifically, the S of G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5 were measured to be 12.6, 15.8, 19.7, 9.3, and 8.2, respectively, which was listed in Table 1. The calculated S of G3 was much higher than the other studied sensors. Meanwhile, the response/recovery time of G3 was calculated to be 30.8 s/21.4 s (seen in Table 1), which was much shorter than those of G1 (37.2 s/28.2 s), G2 (34.1 s/24.6 s), G4 (42.4 s/31.7 s), and G5 (46.2 s/34.8 s). The highest S and the shortest response/recovery time of G3 revealed that the MoO3 doped with 6 at% Fe exhibited the best hydrogen gas sensing performance among the assembled devices. In the following research, G3 was selected to systematically investigate its gas sensing properties at room temperature. It should be noted that the basic resistance of the assembled sensor showed a positive relationship with the Fe dopant concentration, as seen in Fig. 6f. As previously reported, Fe dopant induced the formation of oxygen vacancies with double-positive charges in MoO3 [46]. This allows oxygen gas in the air to be adsorbed on the induced oxygen vacancies at room temperature and capture electrons from the MoO3 substrate [62]. As a result, the concentration of free electrons is reduced. The reduction in the number of free carriers would correspondingly increase the resistance of doped samples. In addition, the average length of the synthesized MoO3 nanoribbons decreased upon increasing the concentration of the Fe in the samples, providing more junctions in the sensing layer composed of shorter Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons. The potential barrier at the junction acted as an obstacle for the transfer of electrons in the samples [63]; therefore, the basic resistance of the assembled sensor increased at higher Fe doping concentrations in the MoO3 nanoribbons. The dynamic gas sensing performance of G3 towards hydrogen gas with different concentrations is shown in Fig. 7. The results revealed that G3 also exhibited n-type gas sensing performance to 10–1500 ppm H2 (Fig. 7a). The sensor response of G3 exhibited a positive relationship with the concentration of the target hydrogen gas, as seen in Fig. 7b. It was found that G3 still showed a promising S of approximately 1.69 to hydrogen gas with a low concentration of only 10 ppm. Then, the S of the G3 increased quickly to 26.3 upon increasing the concentration of hydrogen gas to 1000 ppm. Upon further increasing the concentration of the hydrogen gas, the S of G3 slightly increased but trended to saturation. The calculated S of G3 was 27.58 and 27.88 towards 1250 and 1500 ppm H2, respectively. We also found that there was a linear relationship between the S of G3 and the detected H2 with concentrations from 250 to 1250 ppm (the blue line in Fig. 7b). The t res and the t rec of G3 towards 1000 ppm H2 were calculated to be 22.3 s and 34.7 s, respectively. Additionally, the t res (or t rec ) of G3 was inversely (or positively) correlated with the concentration of hydrogen gas, as shown in Fig. S2. The response/recovery time of G3 to hydrogen gas with a concentration of 250 ppm (or 1250 ppm) was as short as 34.1 s/18.6 s (or 19.8 s/39.7 s), respectively. Therefore, G3 shows great potential as a hydrogen gas sensor due to its high sensor response and fast response time at room temperature. The dynamic gas sensing performance of G3 to 1000 ppm H2 with five continuous processes is shown in Fig. 8a. The S of G3 to 1000 ppm H2 in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth runs was 26.3, 26.5, 26.4, 26.4, and 26.2, respectively. The variation in S was small, indicating that G3 showed outstanding repeatability for sensing hydrogen gas [64]. Moreover, the S of G3 was almost unchanged after 30 days (Fig. 8b). In fact, the S of the sensor based on MoO3 doped with 6 at% Fe was calculated to be 26.3, 26.2, 26.0, and 26.2 when the sensor operated for 8 days, 15 days, 21 days, and 27 days, respectively, indicating the promising response stability of Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons [65,66]. We also studied the gas sensing performance of G3 to different gases with the same concentration of 1000 ppm, as shown in Fig. 8c. The sensor response of G3 to 1000 ppm CO (C2H5OH, CH3COCH3, C3H7OH, CH3OH, and C6H5CH3) was measured to be 2.35 (1.48, 1.87, 1.21, 1.65, and 1.98), which was much lower than that of H2 (~ 26.3). The results revealed that the sensor based on Fe-doped MoO3 showed high selectivity towards hydrogen gas at room temperature [67]. We also studied the effect of the RH on the hydrogen sensing performance of G3. The results showed that G3 exhibited sensing performance to 1000 ppm H2 under RH values of approximately 20%, 60%, and 80%, respectively. Specifically, the S was calculated to be 20.3 at 20% RH, and then it slightly decreased to 19.7 when the RH increased to 40%. When the added RH was further increased to 60% or 80%, the S dramatically decreased to 16.4 or 11.2, respectively (Fig. 8d). Clearly, the S of G3 was negatively related to the RH. This was possibly due to the adoption of water molecules on the surface of the sensing material, which decreased the chemisorption of oxygen species and further deteriorated the sensing performance of G3 [68]. Our study indicated that Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons are a promising material that exhibits outstanding room-temperature hydrogen gas sensing performance."
8,Hydrogen gas sensing mechanism of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons,"3.3 Hydrogen gas sensing mechanism of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons As it has been widely reported in previous studies, the gas sensing mechanism of metal oxides is mainly attributed to the redox reactions between the target gas molecules and adsorbed oxygen ions [69–71]. Our previous study also revealed that adsorbed oxygen ions play an important role in the hydrogen sensing process of MoO3-based materials [58]. When Mo6+ was partially substituted by Fe3+, the dopant induced the formation of oxygen vacancies in the modified MoO3 according to Eq. (1) [46]. As a result, several oxygen vacancies were generated in the Fe-doped MoO3, which served as active sites for the adsorption of gas molecules during sensing. The formation of oxygen vacancies in Fe-doped MoO3 is illustrated by the following Kroger–Vink notation: (1) F e 2 O 3 ⟶ M o O 3 2 F e ′ ′ ′ M o + 3 O o x + 3 V o ⋅ ⋅ where F e ′ ′ ′ M O represents a substituent defect due to substituting Fe3+ for Mo6+, V o ⋅ ⋅ is an oxygen vacancy with a charge of +2, and O o x represents a neutral oxygen atom at an oxygen site. (2) O 2 ( g a s ) ⟶ V o ⋅ ⋅ O 2 ( a d s ) (3) O 2 ( a d s ) + e ¯ → O 2 − ( a d s ) (4) 2 H 2 ( g a s ) + O 2 − ( a d s ) → 2 H 2 O ( g a s ) + e − When the sensor based on a semiconducting metal oxide is exposed to the air, oxygen molecules are adsorbed on the active sites (usually an oxygen vacancy: V o ) on a material surface according to Eq. (2) [72]. Then, the adsorbed oxygen molecules capture electrons from the sensing metal oxide to form chemisorbed oxygen ions (mainly O2 − at room temperature) according to Eq. (3). This decreases the concentration of electrons in the sensing material and establishes a thick depletion layer on the metal oxide surface [6,70]. In the case of Fe-doped MoO3, we calculated the adsorption of gas molecules on the modified MoO3 via first-principles DFT calculations using CASTEP in Material Studio. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) function parameterized with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was selected to calculate the exchange-correlation contribution to the total electronic energy, which has been widely applied in previous studies [73,74]. The convergence criteria for energy optimization was set to not exceed 0.02 meV/atom, with the remaining stress and force being 0.05 GPa, and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. Meanwhile, k-point grids were selected to be 2 * 1 * 2, and the cut-off energy was 550 eV. Moreover, the spin-unrestricted calculation was also adopted in all studies. Fe-doped MoO3 was established by substituting one Mo atom with one Fe atom, and one oxygen vacancy was also induced above the Fe dopant atom. The built Fe-MoO3 consisted of 63 Mo atoms, 191 O atoms, and 1 Fe atom with a size of 15.851 Å * 14.786 Å in the x-direction and z-direction, respectively, which was large enough to avoid the effects of adsorbed gas molecules nearby [74]. Additionally, a vacuum slab layer was chosen to be 30 Å along the y-direction of the built Fe-MoO3. The adsorption of H2 on Fe-doped MoO3 was first calculated to fully understand the hydrogen-sensing performance of modified MoO3 [75–77]. We established three typical modes for the adsorption of H2 according to the direction of the H2: the H2 could be adsorbed on active site of Fe in Fe-MoO3 along the x, y, or z-axes, named as mode H-1, mode H-2, or mode H-3, respectively. Our calculated results showed that H2 moved far away from the Fe active site with distances of 3.683 Å, 3.354 Å, or 3.401 Å in mode H-1, mode H-2, or mode H-3, respectively. Meanwhile, the adsorption energy of H2 in mode H-1, mode H-2, or mode H-3 was −0.032 eV, −0.106 eV, or −0.079 eV, respectively. Therefore, H2 was more likely to interact with Fe-MoO3 in mode H-2, the optimized structure of which is shown in Fig. S3a. The distance (or the adsorption energy) was so long (or low) that H2 might only be physically adsorbed on Fe-MoO3, which was also confirmed by the small overlap between the partial density of states (PDOS) or the total electron density of adsorbed H2 and that of the Fe-doped MoO3 substrate (Figs. S4 or S3b, respectively). The analysis of the electrical density difference of mode H-2 also showed that only 0.04 e was transferred between the adsorbed H2 and Fe-MoO3 (Fig. S3c), which is too few to effectively alter the electrical properties of the modified MoO3. Then, we also calculated the adsorption of oxygen molecule on Fe-doped MoO3. Three possible adsorption modes were built for the adsorption of oxygen molecule on MoO3 doped with one Fe atom: the oxygen was parallel to the surface of the Fe-doped MoO3 along the x (mode O-1) or y (mode O-2) axes or was perpendicular to the plane of the Fe-doped MoO3 (mode O-3) [78]. The calculated results show that the adsorption energy of the oxygen molecule was −0.539 eV, −0.461 eV, or −0.673 eV for mode O-1, O-2, or O-3, respectively. We can infer that oxygen preferred to adsorb on Fe-doped MoO3 in mode O-3 ( Fig. 9a), agreeing well with a previous study [79]. The shortest distance between an adsorbed oxygen molecule and Fe active site was calculated to be 2.003 Å. The length of the O‒O bond was measured to be 1.247 Å, which is longer than that of the free oxygen molecule (1.214 Å), indicating strong interactions between the adsorbed oxygen molecule and Fe-doped MoO3 [80]. Meanwhile, the strong overlap in the electronic density of mode O-3 also showed that the oxygen molecule was stably chemisorbed on Fe-doped MoO3 (Fig. S5). This was also confirmed by the strong overlap in the peaks between the PDOS of the doped Fe and that of the adsorbed oxygen molecule (Fig. S6). The study of the electronic density difference revealed that charges to the oxygen atoms numbered 1 and 2 in the adsorbed oxygen molecule were −0.09 e and −0.06 e, respectively (Fig. 9b). As a result, −0.15 e would be transferred from Fe-MoO3 to the adsorbed oxygen molecule. Based on the results above, the adsorption of an oxygen molecule on Fe-MoO3 would capture electrons from the substrate, in good agreement with the reported theory discussed ahead and the experiment results in previous sections. When hydrogen gas was introduced into the testing chamber, the hydrogen molecules reacted with pre-adsorbed oxygen ions (mainly O2 −) via Eq. (4) to form H2O molecules, which released electrons back into the MoO3-based nanoribbons [34,70]. We also calculated the interactions between hydrogen molecules and pre-adsorbed oxygen ions. The hydrogen molecules were adsorbed on the surface of the Fe-doped MoO3 either parallel or perpendicular to the oxygen ions. Then, we found that the hydrogen molecules parallel to the surface of doped MoO3 interacted with the pre-adsorbed oxygen ions, as seen in Fig. 10a. The corresponding average adsorption energy of the two hydrogen gas molecules was calculated to be −3.12 eV. Two H2O molecules formed during the reaction between the introduced hydrogen molecule and pre-adsorbed oxygen ions, which was confirmed by the PDOS of the reaction system. As shown in Fig. 11, the peaks of the PDOS of the H atoms numbered 1 and 2 (3 and 4) were strongly overlapped with those of the O atom numbered 1 (2), indicating that the hydrogen molecules reacted strongly with oxygen ions to form an H2O molecule. The analysis of the electronic density differences (Fig. 10b) showed that the charges on H atoms numbered 1 and 2 (3 and 4) or the O atom numbered 1 (2) were calculated to be 0.45 e and 0.42 e (0.47 e and 0.53 e) or −0.76 e (−0.91 e), respectively. So, a total of 0.20 e was released to the Fe-MoO3 substrate when the introduced hydrogen molecules interacted with pre-adsorbed oxygen ions. This sensing process effectively increased the concentration of free electrons in the sensing material, which dramatically decreased the thickness of the potential layer [71]. As a result, the resistance of the sensing material decreased to a low level, which is in agreement with the reported hydrogen sensing theory of the metal oxides [69–71]. Then, the depletion layer in the sensing material was rebuilt when the sensor stayed in the air, demonstrating the recovery of the sensor. Our study was well consistent with the investigation on the hydrogen sensing mechanism of the ZnO nanostructures, WO3 nanowires, In2O3 nanocubes, or SnO2 nanobelts [81–84]. According to the results above, the oxygen molecule in the air may first be adsorbed on the Fe active sites in Fe-MoO3, which traps electrons from the substrate to form chemisorbed oxygen ions (O2 −) at room temperature. The O2 − would further react with the introduced H2 to release electrons to the sensing material, inducing the hydrogen sensing behavior of the modified MoO3. One of the possible factors responsible for the outstanding hydrogen sensing performances of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons was their high specific surface areas [85]. The interactions between hydrogen molecules and adsorbed oxygen ions induce the gas sensing properties of MoO3-based nanoribbons. The high specific surface areas of Fe-doped MoO3 may help improve the adsorption of the oxygen molecules in the air or hydrogen molecules in a target gas. Therefore, gas molecules could be smoothly adsorbed on the surface of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons with a high specific surface area, accelerating the adsorption of oxygen molecules or hydrogen molecules on the sensing material. So, the adsorbed gas molecules could diffuse in Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons. As a result, interactions between adsorbed oxygen ions and hydrogen molecules were greatly accelerated. According to the discussion above, the high specific surface areas of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons led to their high sensor response and short response/recovery times. In addition, the Fe dopant atoms in MoO3 have been reported to be effective active sites for gas adsorption [85,86]. The lower valence of Fe3+ dopant would induce the formation of vacancies in MoO3 nanoribbons, which was also confirmed by the XPS analysis of our samples. The vacancies induced around the doped metal atoms would allow the smooth adsorption of gas molecules on Fe dopant atoms in the sensing material. This may improve the chemisorption of oxygen ions on the surface of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons, which was also confirmed by the DFT calculations above [86]. More oxygen ions can also interact with more hydrogen molecules, thus enhancing the gas-sensing performance of the modified MoO3 nanoribbons. Meanwhile, the Fe dopant in MoO3 was stable in the air, and the concentration was almost unchanged. When the sensor based on modified MoO3 nanoribbons was operated, the vacancies induced by the Fe dopants in the nanoribbons and their morphologies remained the same as the original devices. The surface state of the sensor was hardly changed during the response/recovery process [72,87]. As a result, the gas sensing properties of the Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons were stable for nearly 30 days. Our study indicates that the MoO3 nanoribbons doped with Fe are promising sensing materials with outstanding hydrogen sensing performance at room temperature."
9,Conclusions,"Modified MoO3 nanoribbons doped with different concentrations of Fe were synthesized with a facile hydrothermal method. The average lengths of the prepared MoO3 nanoribbons decreased upon increasing the concentration of the Fe dopant, and were 2.27 µm when the MoO3 nanoribbons were doped with 6 at% Fe. The doped Fe induced the formation of oxygen vacancies in modified MoO3, which helped improve the concentration of chemisorbed oxygen ions in the MoO3 nanoribbons doped with 6 at% Fe. Meanwhile, the sensor response of the modified MoO3 nanoribbons increased when the concentration of the Fe dopant increased from 2 at% to 6 at% and then decreased at higher concentrations. The sensor response of the MoO3 nanoribbons doped with 6 at% Fe was 19.7, with a response time of 30.8 s to 500 ppm H2 at room temperature. Moreover, the MoO3 nanoribbons doped with 6 at% Fe exhibited promising hydrogen sensing properties to 10–1500 ppm H2 with excellent repeatability, response stability, and selectivity to H2. The higher specific surface area and the Fe dopant in the modified MoO3 nanoribbons were the main factors responsible for the improved hydrogen gas sensing performance of the nanoribbons doped with 6 at% Fe. The Fe-doped MoO3 nanoribbons show promising hydrogen gas sensing performance at room temperature."
