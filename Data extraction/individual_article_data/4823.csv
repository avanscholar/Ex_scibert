0,Introduction,"The continuous energy demand increase and growing depletion of fossil fuels are some of the causes behind the energy crisis. The renewable energy sources, such as biohydrogen, are promising alternatives to change this scenario [1]. The main advantage to produce hydrogen through biological processes is to employ a variety of lignocellulosic wastes as substrate [2] such as sugarcane bagasse (SCB) within a biorefinery concept. SCB is a fibrous sugarcane residue obtained after processing for alcohol and sugar production. It is commonly used as centralized energy source for boilers, producing bagasse ashes that are used in sugarcane plantations as organic fertilizer [3]. However, its recalcitrance is a potential contamination risk of soils and water resources, justifying SCB application in biological process. One of the challenges in the SCB bioconversion is a physical and chemical barrier formed by cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose linkage which hinder its hydrolysis. Therefore, pre-treatments are required to disrupt the high crystal structure of lignocellulosic biomass, enhance its accessibility to cellulolytic enzymes, and provide fermentable sugars to produce biofuels [4]. Besides the pre-treatment, optimizing many environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability will favor cellulolytic-fermenting bacteria and its metabolite pathways [2]. The individual and interactive effects of many factors on the hydrogen production can be investigated using a central composite design, which provides a quick systematic assessment of key process variables, whereby fermentation strategies can be achieved to improve targeted product yields [5]. Like the operational factors, the functional potential of microbial communities involved in the bioconversion of sugarcane bagasse is still limited and contains knowledge gaps. Therefore, metabolic pathways in reactor systems have been assessed using the metagenomic approach in recent studies [6–8] and revealed a similar genetic potential related to all stages of the anaerobic digestion process. It appears that acetotrophic methanogenesis genes play a significant role in the biogas production [9], however, there is little discussion on the genes related to the lignocellulosic biomass degradation and hydrogen production. Therefore, metagenomic analysis could be used to provide information about the function related to different genes, the organization and structure of genomes and the evolutionary relationship within the microbial communities [10]. The goal of this study was to elucidate the microbial mechanisms of enhanced hydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse using a central composite design, composition and functional role of the microbial communities related to bioconversion of the lignocellulosic biomass into hydrogen, methane and organic acids by the metagenomic approach."
1,Material and methods,
2,Substrate pre-treatment,"2.1 Substrate pre-treatment The SCB was obtained from São Martinho sugar mill (Pradópolis, SP-Brazil), dried at ambient temperature and pretreated using a hydrothermal reactor of 100 mL capacity at 200 °C for 10 min at 16 bar [11]. The solid phase was separated from the liquid phase by vacuum filtration, air dried until constant weight, stored at room temperature and then used as substrate in batch reactor. The pretreated sugarcane bagasse was constituted mainly of about 57.5% of cellulose, 6.6% of hemicellulose [12], 14% of klason lignin, 2.7% of ashes, 28.2 mg/L of metals (Al, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn) and crystallinity index of 43.8%."
3,Microorganisms and culture condition,2.2 Microorganisms and culture condition The microbial consortium was obtained from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). The seed sludge was diluted four times to reduce the methanogens activity into Cellulose Anaerobe Medium [13] and then used as inoculum for batch reactor.
4,Batch reactor,"2.3 Batch reactor Batch reactors of 1 L (500 mL reactional and 500 mL headspace volume) were performed in triplicate using the solid fraction of hydrothermally pretreated SCB (2 g/L) as substrate, and the diluted thermophilic sludge (10% v/v – 1.5 g/L VSS), and culture medium [13] as nutrient source. The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 6.0. The culture medium was supplemented with yeast extract according to the factorial experiment design (Table 1 ), submitted to N2 (100%) for 10 min, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and plastic seal, and then incubated at appropriate temperature for approximately 400 h."
5,Central composite design,"2.4 Central composite design A series of hydrogen production experiments were designed based on a central composite design (CCD) for two independent variables, namely incubation temperature (°C) and yeast extract concentration (g/L). Each factor was varied at five levels (+1; −1; 0; +1.42; −1.42) with three repetitions at the central point and two replicates at axial and factorial points. Based on literature values, the variable ranges (center point) of yeast extract concentration and temperature were determined to be 2 g/L and 60 °C, respectively (Table 1), resulting in a total of 11 conditions. The commercial yeast extract (Sigma-Aldrich®) used was constituted mainly of peptides and amino acids in a low-salt formulation."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography using a GC 2010 Shimadzu system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a Carboxen 1010 PLOT column (30 m × 0.53 mm) according to Ratti et al. (2013) [14]. The organic acids and ethanol were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a UV diode array detector (SPD-M10 AVP), a refraction index detector (RID-10A) a CTO-20A oven an LC-10 ADVP Pump, an SCL 10 AVP control and column HPX-87H from Aminex, with 300 mm × 7.8 mm (BioRad). The mobile phase consisted of H2SO4 (0.01 N) at 0.5 mL/min flow rate [15]. The klason lignin determination of the SCB was performed according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) protocol [16]. The crystallinity of SCB was determined by X-ray Diffractometer and the crystallinity index (CrI) was calculated as per the empirical formula proposed by Segal and co-workers [17]. For determination of total metal concentration, the sugarcane bagasse (0.5 g) was digested in Teflon® vessel with 5 mL of HNO3 (2M) along with 2 mL of H2O2 (30%) according to protocol described by Bizzi and co-workers [18]. The metals in the SCB were determined by inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; Optima 8000, Perkin, Elmer, USA) as reported by Braga and co-workers [19]."
7,Kinetic analysis,"2.6 Kinetic analysis The experimental data was adjusted to the average values obtained from triplicates using the software Statistica® 8.0. The data of the accumulated hydrogen and methane production was adjusted using the Gompertz equation, modified by Zwietering [20] (Equation (1)). (1) H = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Where: P – Potential production of H2 (mmol/L), Rm – Production Rate of H2 (mmol/L.h), t – time of incubation (hours), e – Euler number (2.71828) and λ – lag phase duration time (hours)."
8,"Sampling, DNA extraction, sequencing and taxonomic and functional annotation of metagenomes","2.7 Sampling, DNA extraction, sequencing and taxonomic and functional annotation of metagenomes Microbial samples used in this study were collected at the end of the operational time using 15 ml Falcon tubes, washed successively with phosphate buffer solution (PBS 1 × ), centrifuged (6000 rpm for 10 min), and the pellets (approximately 0.5 g) were stored at −20 °C until use. The DNA was extracted by cell lysis using glass beads (Sigma®), and then consecutively washed with phenol (Tris tamponed) and chloroform according to Griffiths and co-workers [21]. DNA quality and concentrations were determined by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) and ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Inc., Wilmington, DE), using a ratio of 260/280 nm N 1.8. The library preparation and metagenomic sequencing were performed at MR DNA (www.mrdnalab.com, Shallowater, TX, USA) following Illumina's guidelines. Briefly, 50 ng of DNA was used to prepare the libraries using the NextEra DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). The library insert size was determined using the Experion Automated Electrophoresis Station (Bio-Rad). The pooled library (12 pM) was loaded onto a 600 Cycles v3 Reagent cartridge (Illumina), and sequencing was conducted using the platform Illumina HiSeq 2 × 150 bp. The sequencing read was deposited in the Metagenome Rapid Annotation (MG-RAST) server under accession number mgm4734360.3. The assembly of paired-end reads, pre-processing and annotation of the sequences were performed using MG-RAST server version 3.5 [22] according to the instructions provided by MG-RAST. The artificial replicate sequences were removed according to Gomez-Alvarez and co-works [23], and the low quality sequences were removed using modified Dynamic Trim [24]. The default parameters were used in both analyses. The best hit classification at a maximum e-value of 1e−5, a minimum identity of 60% and a minimum alignment length of 15 against the SEED, KO, and subsystem databases [25] were used for taxonomic profiles. The reads were annotated according to the KEGG database [26] using default parameters, to identify genes and their functions. Analysis tools (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), such as KEGG module, KEEG mapper, KEGG pathways, and ExPAzy - ENZYME were used to understand high-level functions in specific pathways related to the bioprocess."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Evaluation of independent variables affecting hydrogen production,"3.1 Evaluation of independent variables affecting hydrogen production Hydrogen production from hydrothermal pretreated SCB with different combinations of temperature (°C) and yeast extract concentration (g/L) based on CCD is shown in Table 2 . As can be seen in Table 2, the maximum hydrogen production was obtained in C8 (17.30 mmol/L), which was conducted at 60 °C with 3.42 g/L of yeast extract. In contrast, the C6 exhibited the minimum hydrogen production (0.1 mmol/L) in which the fermentation was conducted at an incubation temperature of 74.2 °C and 2.00 g/L of yeast extract concentration, indicating that the high incubation temperature was adverse to the hydrogen-producing bacteria. It was observed that linear yeast extract concentration (X1), as well as the quadratic coefficients of yeast extract concentration (X1) and incubation temperature (X2) are significant at a level lower than 5%. Therefore, the linear effect of X1 and quadratic effect of X2 are the most influential parameters however there is also the quadratic effect of X2 and their interaction effects (X1 by X2). The significance of these quadratic and interactive effects would have been lost if the experiments had been carried out using the conventional methods. In addition, the quadratic effect values of X2 were less than zero, indicating a negative effect of this parameter on the response, hydrogen production. The temperature affects the maximum specific growth, substrate consumption and metabolic pathway of microbial populations affecting the generation of by-products [27]. By applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental results, the polynomial equation was obtained to describe the hydrogen production using the coded independents variables (Eq. (2)) (2) P ( mmol / L ) = 9.167 + 0.252 X 1 + 3.356 X 2 − 3.827 X 1 2 + 2.185 X 2 2 + 1.962 X 1 · X 2 Where P is the predicted hydrogen production (mmol/L), X1 and X2 are the coded values of yeast extract concentration and incubation temperature, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the significance of the independent variables on hydrogen production (Table 3 ). The p-value of the regression coefficient was significant at the 0.05% α level and the coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated to be 0.966, which can explain up to 96.6% variability of the response. It indicates good agreement between the experimental and predicted values and suggests that the model was consistent for hydrogen production. The 3D response surface graphs display the characteristic effects of key process variables on hydrogen production. Fig. 1 shows the response against yeast extract concentration and incubation temperature. The surface presented a concave structure representing the quadratic and interaction effects, in addition to linear ones. The hydrogen production was significantly affected by the linear yeast extract concentration and quadratic incubation temperature. The temperature variation may have an effect on the bacterial enzymes activity. Higher temperature can cause irreversible inactivation of some enzymes, however, thermophilic microorganisms typically produce thermostable enzymes with optimal activity at high temperature. Thermostable enzymes are extremely specific and therefore have significant potential application in many industrial processes [28], mainly in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, due to its augmented solubility of reactants and products, leading to high reaction velocities and consequently decreasing the amount of enzymes required. Commonly, the thermophilic enzymes are optimally active between 60 and 80 °C and do not function well below 40 °C [29]. In the present study, the effect of temperature on the bacterial activity was clearly observed, since at lower (45.8 °C) and higher temperatures (74.2 °C) the lowest hydrogen values (1.75 and 0.1 mmol/L, respectively) were produced. Many bacteria has been reported to produce cellulolytic thermostable enzymes, such as Moorella thermoacetica which have unusual heat-resistant spores with D10 times of approximately 2 h at 121 °C [30]. Thus, thermophilic microorganisms could be key microbes for biogas production from lignocellulosic biomass. Besides temperature, the biological production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass is affected by the nitrogen source and availability. Ferchichi and co-workers reported that the nitrogen source had a marked effect on hydrogen production [31]. These authors evaluated the culture supplementation with yeast extract, corn steep liquor, casamino acids, tryptone and peptone. Among these sources, yeast extract was the best nitrogen source to improve the hydrogen production because it facilitated the highest production rate and hydrogen yield. Yeast extract is a complex nitrogen source consisting of different peptides and amino acids, which are incorporated, from the culture medium, by bacteria cells for the production of protein and other cellular nitrogenous constituents [31]. In the present study, the maximum hydrogen production (17.30 mmol/L) was obtained using the highest yeast extract concentration (3.42 g/L). Cao and co-workers [32] reported lower hydrogen production rates (8.42, 8.98, and 9.88 mmol/L) than the present study, from corn stalk, wheat straw, and corn cob, respectively at 60 °C using 2.0 g/L of yeast extract and 5 g/L of substrate. This probably occurred due to the hydrothermal pretreatment applied in the present study, which was efficient to disrupt the SCB structure in order to increase its accessibility to enzymes and consequently favor the fermentative process. The effect of yeast extract concentration on hydrogen production was evidenced, mainly in the same temperature condition but with different yeast extract concentrations. At 50 °C (C1 and C2), the hydrogen production was 5.35 and 8.70 mmol/L with 1.0 and 3.0 g/L of yeast extract, respectively. In the same way, at 70 °C (C3 and C4) the effect of yeast extract was even stronger, once the hydrogen production was 3.60 and 14.80 mmol/L using 1.0 and 3.0 g/L of yeast extract, respectively. Improvement of hydrogen production from 1.05 to 1.46 mol/mol of xylose were reported by Kongjan and co-workers after the 1.0 g/L of yeast extract addition in batch reactors [33]. In the same way, Zhang and co-workers reported 2.5 times more hydrogen produced using 0.4 g/L of yeast extract than without yeast extract assays [34]. Thus, this suggested that the nitrogen and the trace mineral content in the yeast extract were important for the microbial cell growth, and affected the hydrogen production."
11,Effect of independent variables on the fermentative and methanogenic routes,"3.2 Effect of independent variables on the fermentative and methanogenic routes The hydrogen production was accomplished by the generation of organic acids in all conditions (Fig. 2 ). The highest hydrogen production (17.30 mmol/L) in condition C8 was accompanied by the predominance of acetic and butyric acids (169.29 and 487.83 mg/L, respectively). In contrast, the lowest hydrogen production (0.1 mmol/L) in C6 was accompanied by formic, acetic and propionic acids (43.96. 119.82, and 40.48 mg/L, respectively). Low organic acid concentrations were observed at 45.8 °C and 74.2 °C. These results reflect the different compositions of microbial communities from thermophilic-enriched microbial consortia (55 °C) that were not favored at the higher and lower temperatures applied in the present study. A mesophilic microbial consortium (30 °C) from a full-scale UASB methanogenic reactor was also less efficient at thermophilic condition (55 °C) as reported by Lazaro and co-workers [35], corroborating that the thermophilic inoculum used in this study was not suitable to conditions of temperature extremes. Methane production was observed in all conditions except in C6 (2.0 g/L of yeast extract at 74.2 °C). There was no significant effect of yeast extract concentration and incubation temperature on the methane production. The highest methane production (7.3 mmol/L) was observed in C1 (1.0 g/L of yeast extract at 50 °C). High methane production (291.92 mmol) was reported by O-Thong and co-workers [36] from thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion (55 °C) of oil palm empty fruit bunches with palm oil mill effluent. The higher methane production obtained by these authors was probably due to the higher substrate and inoculum concentration used (13 gST/L and 53.5 gSTV/L, respectively) in relation to this study (2 g/L and 2.76 gSTV/L, respectively)."
12,Taxonomic and functional metagenomics profile of the biogas microbial community,"3.3 Taxonomic and functional metagenomics profile of the biogas microbial community The taxonomic profiles of the metagenomic analyses, from the reactor with the highest hydrogen production, were determined using the best hit classification with default parameters of the annotation of reads against the SEED database. For the Bacteria domain, 92.78% of relative abundance was observed. The relative abundance of archaeal communities was of 7.12%. Eukaryota and Viruses accounted for only 0.07 and 0.03% of relative abundance, respectively. Concerning the bacterial communities, the principal phylum was affiliated to Firmicutes (71.62%), which is typically detected in anaerobic reactors, followed by Thermotoga (10.69%) and Proteobacteria (7.95%). More specifically, among the Firmicutes, the genus of Coprothermobacter was predominantly present (29.44%) followed by Clostridium (9.22%) (Fig. 3 ). Species of Clostridium synthesize extracellular enzymes like exoglucanases, xylanases, endoglucanases, chitinases, lichinases, and others [37]. In the present study many glycoside hydrolases related to cellulose degradation were identified, such as cellulase (EC: 3.2.1.4), β-glucosidase (EC: 3.2.1.21), β-mannosidase (EC: 3.2.1.25), β-glucosylceramidase (EC: 3.2.1.45), cellulose β-1,4 celobiosidase (EC: 3.2.1.91). The release of extracellular cellulases by species of Clostridium, probably favored the Coprothermobacter genus, once members of this genus are proteolytic bacteria, which in cellulosic systems are related to the degradation of extracellular polymeric material, enzymes or other secreted proteins [38]. Majeed et al. [39], were the first to report the expression and characterization of a recombinant protease from Coprothermobacter proteolyticus. They reported a serine protease with an alkaline pH optimum in the range of 8–10, and an extraordinary thermostability at an elevated temperature (60 °C). It is important to note that, in the present study, the incubation temperature was 60 °C and the serine protease (EC:3.4.21.107) a high temperature requirement enzyme, was also identified, corroborating the important role of this microbial pathway. The Coprothermobacter genus contains hydrogen producing species, which establishes syntrophic cooperation with archaea, once hydrogen is one the most important carriers in interspecies electron transfer between this genus and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea [40]. Indeed, the proteolytic activity of members from Coprothermobacter genus is enhanced by syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as Methanothermobacter, widely found in thermophilic anaerobic reactors [41]. In fact, is important to highlight that Methanothermobacter was the predominant archaea genus in the present study (3.51%), corroborating the possible cooperation between microbial pathways of hydrogen producer and consumer (Fig. 4 ). Another important cooperation reported in the literature occurs between Clostridium thermocellum and species of Thermoanaerobacter for bioconversion of cellulosic biomass. Liu et al. [42] reported hydrogen yield of 0.8 mol H2/mol glucose by C. thermocellum, a cellulolytic bacteria which cannot effectively use glucose and xylose for hydrogen production, while when it was co-cultured with T. thermossacharolyticum the hydrogen yield was 1.8 mol H2/mol glucose. In this study the significant relative abundance of both genera (9.22 and 2.26%, Clostridium and Thermoanerobacter, respectively) could be an indicative of this collaboration. Other microorganisms related to the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into hydrogen, methane and organic acids were also identified in this study. Thermotoga, Caldanaerobacter, Moorella, and Fervidobacterium genera were identified in significant relative abundance (5.34, 3.88, 2.99, and 2.98%, respectively). In the Fervidobacterium and Termotoga genera there are hydrolytic and fermentative species (Cai et al., 2007; Shrestha et al., 2017) that probably played an important role in the SCB biodegradation. The species of Thermotoga are able to utilize a wide variety of carbohydrates, including waste substrates for fermentative hydrogen production (Nguyen et al., 2008; Shin et al., 2004). These bacteria require growth factors such as yeast extract for growth on carbohydrates (Balk et al., 2002). Ngo and Sim (2012) reported that hydrogen production by T. neapolitana increased as the yeast extract concentration increased, from 1.0 to 4.0 g/L. Also, Nguyen et al. (2008) reported that the yeast extract concentration of 4.0 g/L improved the hydrogen production. Based on information obtained by the aforementioned authors, the yeast extract concentration of 3.42 g/L may have favored the hydrogen production in reactors that used SCB as substrate. Caldanaerobacter sp. was identified in another thermophilic inoculum related to high hydrogen yields (Qiu et al., 2011; Strang et al., 2017; Yokoyama et al., 2009), while Moorella genus can perform homoacetogenic fermentation producing ethanol and acetate from H2 and CO2 [43]. The soluble carbohydrates and the initial pH (6.0) next to optimum pH of this genus (6.2) [43] may have favored the Moorella sp. The total reads were annotated according to categories of the KO database (KEEG ORTHOLOGY) in order to expose the potential functional profiling of the thermophilic anaerobic microbial communities from the reactor with the high hydrogen production. KO annotation analysis revealed that 56.8, 22.9, 13.5, and 5.8% were assigned to metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular process, respectively (Fig. 5 ). The obtained results are comparable with Guo et al. [9], which reported that 43.2% of the total reads were associated with the metabolism in a full-scale anaerobic digestion sludge. In the metabolism category, the most abundant type was amino acid metabolism (17.9%) followed by carbohydrate metabolism (13.4%). The dominant genes involved in amino acid metabolism were detected in reads assigned to “glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism” (4.0%), “alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism” (3.6%), “cysteine and methionine metabolism” (2.3%), “arginine and proline metabolism” (1.8%), “histidine metabolism” (1.5%), “lysine biosynthesis” (1.4%), and “valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis” (1.1%). These amino acids are well known to be widely involved in Stickland reaction [9]. In these reactions, amino acids could be degraded to produce hydrogen by coupled oxidation-reduction reactions, while the uncoupled reaction must have relied on the uptake of hydrogen by hydrogen consuming microorganism [44]. Species from the Clostridium genus are the main bacteria related to the degradation of amino acids by Stickland reaction [44]. In the present study, 9.2% of relative abundance was assigned to Clostridium, corroborating that this pathway was the predominant amino acid fermentation pathway. It was identified that several enzymes involved in the amino acid degradation, such as 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (EC: 5.4.2.), glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (isomerization) (EC: 2.6.1.16), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (EC: 2.1.1.13), glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC: 2.1.2.1), have high relative abundance. According to Guo et al. [9], the identification of these enzymes is an indicative of good acidogenesis performance in the anaerobic reactor. In the present study, abundant reads corresponding to genes for “carbohydrate metabolism” (13.4%) was also obtained, mainly including “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis” (2.9%), “amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism” (1.7%), “pyruvate metabolism” (1.5%), “pentose phosphate pathway” (1.5%), “citrate cycle” (1.4%), “starch and sucrose metabolism” (1.1%). These observations further confirmed the important role of carbohydrate digestion in the present study (Fig. 5). Based on the annotation of functional genes using subsystem database, the “Carbohydrates” level had 12.3% of relative abundance. The carbohydrate subsystem level was further compared and central carbohydrate metabolism, fermentation and one carbon metabolism categories were observed with 3.4, 1.2, and 1.0% (Fig. 6 ). Additionally, glycoside hydrolases (0.1%), organic acids (0.3%), polysaccharides (0.5%), aminosugar (0.5%), CO2 fixation (0.5%), sugar alcohols (0.7%), di and oligosaccharides (0.9%), and monosaccharide (1.9%) categories were also identified. The glycolysis and gluconeogenesis subsystem category was the most abundant pathway in the central carbohydrate metabolism (5.3%), indicating that critical branch points in carbon flow were occurring in this system. Considering the fermentation subsystem category, the acetoin, butanediol metabolism was the most abundant (26.2%) followed by butanol biosynthesis, and mixed acid fermentation (24.4 and 22.4%, respectively). Acetoin, is the precursor of biofuel 2,3-butanediol, and an important bio-based platform chemical with extensive applications [45], while in the mixed acid fermentation a mixture of lactate, acetate, formate and other organic acids, and alcohol were formed [46]. In the present study a pool of acid (acetic, formic, propionic, isobutyric and butyric acids) were produced at different conditions of factorial design experiments in batch reactor (Fig. 2). In the category of one-carbon metabolisms there is the bioconversion of complex organic matter into compounds formed by one carbon, resulting in a biological methane production. Therefore, in the present study the four stages of the anaerobic digestion process were observed, i.e. hydrolysis, fermentation, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Many microorganisms and functional genes are involved in each stage and cooperated with each other to achieve hydrogen, methane, and organic acid generation. In order to reveal the dominant pathway, functional enzyme-encoding genes for all stage from anaerobic digestion were identified and annotated according to the KO database (Fig. 7 ). According to the sequencing data of this work, members of the Coprothermobacter, Clostridium and Bacillus genera were identified in the anaerobic reactor. These genera are predicted to convert complex organic matter into dissolved compounds at the hydrolysis stage. Hydrolytic enzymes, such as proteases (EC: 3.4.21.107), lipases (EC: 3.1.1.3), and cellulases (EC: 3.2.1.91) were the key enzymes, related to the first stage. Subsequently, the bacteria from Thermotoga, Clostridium, Caldanaerobacter, Carboxydothermus, and Thermoanaerobacter genera performed the acidogenic stage, producing H2, CO2 and organic acids at the second stage using enzymes such as propionate CoA-transferase (EC: 2.8.3.1), and lactate dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.28). At the third stage, the acidogenesis products were further converted into acetate by acetogenic bacteria such as Moorella, Clostridium, Alkaliphilus, Caldanaerobacter, and Thermoanaerobacter, via CO2 reduction using the acetyl CoA synthase (EC: 6.2.1.1) as the key enzyme. Finally, methane production was obtained at the last stage of anaerobic digestion by hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenic archaea. The key microorganisms in the hydrogenotrophic group were Methanothermobacter, Methanoculleus, Methanosarcina, Methanoccocus, and Methanocaldoccocus, while Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta were the predominant acetogenic archaea genera. For the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, CO2 and H2 are converted into CH4 through a series of reactions including the formylmethanefuran-tetrahydropterin N-formyltransferase (EC: 2.3.1.101) enzyme. For acetoclastic methanogenesis, acetate is initially converted to acetyl-CoA, mainly by Methanosarcina using the low-affinity acetate kinase (EC: 2.7.2.1) and Methanosaeta consuming the high-affinity adenosine monophosphate-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (EC: 6.2.1.1)."
13,Conclusion,"This study focused on the optimization of key factors for enhancing hydrogen production using a central composite design. The 60 °C and 3.42 g/L of yeast extract promoted the higher hydrogen production (17.3 mmol/L). Coprothermobacter, Clostridium and Methanothermobacter were the most abundant microorganisms in the system and probably acted in a step-wise reaction establishing a syntrophic cooperation for sugarcane bagasse bioconversion. The functional data of enzyme-encoding genes (such as cellulases EC: 3.2.1.91, propionate CoA-transferase EC: 2.8.3.1, acetate kinase EC: 2.7.2.1, and formylmethanefuran-tetrahydropterin N-formyltransferase EC: 2.3.1.101) strongly suggested that all stage of anaerobic digestion occurred in the anaerobic reactor."
