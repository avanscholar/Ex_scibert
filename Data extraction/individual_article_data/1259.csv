0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a well-known water-soluble, biodegradable and semi-crystalline polymer, which had been produced industrially by hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate [1]. Because of its excellent chemical resistance and physical properties, such as film-forming and emulsifying ability, good adhesion strength, tensile strength and flexibility, as well as its very low toxicity, PVA is widely used in different technical fields especially in textile and paper sizing, fiber coating, adhesives, paint, hydrogel, emulsion polymerization, films for packing and farming and production of poly(vinylbutyral) [1–3]. The industrial specifications of PVA are differentiated by the degree of hydrolysis and polymerization degree. As the ever-increasing demand of different technical fields for suitable performance of PVA, there is requirement for subtle difference in chemical structure of PVA derivatives. For this, the chemical modification of PVA is a simple, useful, and versatile approach to improve its performance for a wide variety of applications [4]. In general, the chemical modification of PVA includes two methods. One is copolymerization and the other is post-modification. Copolymerization of vinyl acetate with some functional vinyl monomers followed by saponification is a well known route to modification of PVA. Some applications of this technology have been reported and exemplified in several literature [5–7]. Post-modification can produce new products by oxidation, esterification, acetylation, etherification or grafting reaction via hydroxyl groups in PVA with various chemical reagents. The presence of its hydroxyl groups on PVA backbone makes it possible to react with appropriate reagents under certain conditions [8,9]. The chemical modification of PVA aims to introduce functional groups, reduce the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and impart the polymer different properties such as lower crystallinity, faster dissolution rate and lower viscosity in aqueous. Compared with copolymerization method, the post-modification is more convenient and more economical to produce specialized grades of modified PVA in small to moderate scale. Post-modification also provides a versatile process for producing a variety of specialized products using a single process unit [8–11]. The modification of PVA is usually carried out in water solution, so the production efficiency can be limited severely by PVA concentration due to its solution viscosity. As the modification process finish, the product, if necessary, will be separated from the solution, dried and crushed. These processes usually consume a large amount of water and energy. Fortunately, a known solid state reaction has been developed for a few post-modification processes of polymers, which is a useful technique for designing materials with a wide variety of properties [12,13]. The advantages of the solid state modification include a short process and inexpensive equipment [14], implying to be economic, effective, energy-saving and easy to operate. This study relates to an oxidized PVA and its preparation by hydrogen peroxide-Cu (II) as a redox system through a solid state reaction process. The PVA powder was swelled by spraying a limited amount of oxidant solution over time required, which was the key procedure to assure opening the reaction channel for evenness of reaction while avoiding dissolving the grainy PVA. Then the temperature was raised to initiate the oxidation of PVA. As a result, a modified PVA with carboxyl end groups, lower molecular weight and in solid state can be produced by the practically clean oxidation process without any wastes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA1799 powder was supplied by Sichuan Vinylon Co. Ltd. (Chongqing, China), with an average polymerization degree 1700 and alcoholysis degree 99.0 mol%. Analytical grade copper sulfate (CuSO4) and fresh 30 wt% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was supplied by Kelong Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Analytical grade NaOH and HCl were used for determining the carboxyl and carbonyl contents in the oxidized samples. Distilled water was used in all of the experiments."
3,General method of oxidation of PVA in solid state,"2.2 General method of oxidation of PVA in solid state The original PVA powder 100 g in a vessel was sprayed with a solution containing 14 mL of 30% H2O2 and 6 mL distilled water while stirring, and then 6 mL 0.05% copper sulfate solution was sprayed into the vessel. The pH value of the copper sulfate solution and water was previously adjusted between 2 and 7 by using a few drops of dilute H2SO4 solution. The mixture in the vessel was constantly agitated with a spiral stirrer for 60 min at 40 °C to swell the PVA powder enough. Then the temperature was raised to 70 °C to initiate the oxidized reaction and maintained for 30 min–240 min with stirring. After that, the resultant was taken out, washed with ethanol/water (80:20, v/v) at room temperature for 30 min, filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C."
4,Carboxyl determination,"2.3 Carboxyl determination The dried oxidized PVA 1 g, accurate to 0.0001 g, was suspended in a mixed solution composed of 20 mL ethanol and 10 mL of 0.1 mol/L HCl in a beaker under magnetic stirring for 30 min, and then was filtered and washed with 100 mL ethanol/water (80:20, v/v) at room temperature. After re-washed and re-filtered, the filtered PVA sample was put in 200 mL water under stirring condition and heated to boiling point to dissolve completely. Upon cooling to room temperature, the PVA solution was poured into a 200 mL volumetric flask and some water was replenished to be 0.5% (w/v) concentration. 100 mL of the solution was transferred to a conical flask, then 1–2 drops of 1% phenolphthalein solution was added as indicator, and the mixture was titrated with 0.01 mol/L NaOH to the phenolphthalein end-point while stirring. The PVA before oxidation was used as a blank determination according to the above procedure for comparison. The carboxyl content W c was calculated as follows. (1) W c = c × V × 0.045 m ( 1 − H ) × 100 % where c represents the concentration of titrated NaOH standard solution, V the consumed volume of the titrated NaOH standard solution, m the weight of the test sample, and H the moisture content of sample. The test was run in triplicate for a sample and the coefficient of variation was about 5%."
5,Carbonyl determination,"2.4 Carbonyl determination PVA sample solution of 0.5% (w/v) concentration was prepared. The solution of 100 mL was transferred into a 500 mL conical flask, and 60 mL of a hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HMH) solution was added in. The HMH solution was previously prepared by dissolving 25 g HMH into 100 mL of 0.5 mol/L NaOH and then diluting with water to 500 mL. The test solution in the conical flask was heated to 40 °C in a thermostatic water bath and rested for 4 h, and then titrated rapidly to pH 3.2 with 0.1 mol/L HCl standard solution. A water sample with only hydroxylamine reagent was used as a blank determination. The carbonyl content W (CO) % was calculated according to Equation (2): (2) W = ( V 0 − V 1 ) × c × 0.028 m × 100 % where V 0 represents the consume volume of HCl standard solution with the titration of the blank sample, V 1 the consume volume of HCl standard solution with the titration of the test sample, c the concentration of titrated HCl, and m the weight of the test sample. Tests for one sample were run in triplicate and coefficient of variation was about 5%."
6,Film-forming process and mechanical property measurement,"2.5 Film-forming process and mechanical property measurement Aqueous dispersions (4 wt%) of PVA samples before and after oxidation were cooked at 95 °C for 50 min. Each of the cooked solutions in 60 mL volume was spread out with a syringe onto a 210 mm × 150 mm of glass dish paved with a polyester film of the same size, which rested on a leveled surface in ambient condition until the casting film was died. The dried PVA film (about 0.1 mm thickness) was separated from the polyester film and equilibrated further in a desiccator with controlled RH 68% (over a saturated solution of CuCl2) at room temperature for three days. As the film was equilibrated, the exact thickness of the film was measured using a centesimal thickness tester (trade name: CH-10-AT; made by Shanghai Liuling Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). For every sample, ten data were recorded and the average thickness was taken. The tensile performance of PVA films were determined using a tensile testing equipment (trade name: YG061; made by Laizhou Electron Instrument Co., Ltd., Laizhou, China) with a clamping distance of 100 mm and stretching speed of 100 mm/min. For each set of data, ten samples were tested, and the average values with the standard deviation were calculated."
7,Determination of molecular weight and distribution,"2.6 Determination of molecular weight and distribution The molecular weight and distribution of the original and oxidized PVA samples were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) on an ALC/GPC 244 system (Waters, USA) with a Waters 515 pump and a Waters 2410 Refractive Index detector. PVA sample (50 mg) was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water and heated in boiling water for 20 min for dissolution. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL of 1.0 mol/L NaNO3 was added and the solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. A water linear column of 300 mm × 7.8 mm was chosen. The mobile phase was 0.1 mol/L NaNO3 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The relative molecular weight 200–870,000 of PEGs were used to construct a standard curve."
8,Viscosity measurements,2.7 Viscosity measurements The viscosity of the oxidized PVA and original PVA of 4 wt% aqueous solutions was tested by using a NDJ-79 rotational viscometer in a constant temperature water bath at 20 ± 0.5 °C. The data presented are average of the three tests. The viscosity of the original PVA1799 was 29.0 ± 1.0 mPa·s in 4% aqueous solution.
9,Surface tension measurement,"2.8 Surface tension measurement The surface tension measurement of the oxidized PVA and original PVA samples in distilled water at a concentration of 4 wt% was performed by OCA20/6 goniometer (Pata physics, Germany) at 25 ± 0.1 °C. Five measurements were carried out for each PVA sample."
10,Thermal analysis,"2.9 Thermal analysis For thermal analysis differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out. About 5 mg of each sample was sealed in aluminum pans under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the scanning was conducted at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 0 to 280 °C with a Netzsch 200 PC Differential Scanning Calorimeter (Netzsch Group, Selb, Germany)."
11,Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis,"2.10 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis FTIR spectra of the cast films were recorded by attenuated total reflection (ATR) method in FTS3000 FTIR Spectrum Scanner (Hercules, USA). After dried over P2O5 powder, each film was allowed to contact intimately with the surface of the ATR crystal. The spectra data were collected over 32 consecutive scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1 at room temperature."
12,X-ray diffraction,"2.11 X-ray diffraction X-ray patterns of PVA granules before and after oxidation were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD D/max IIIA; Rigaku Co., Japan) with Cu radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and an electric current 30 mA. The samples were scanned between 2θ = 5–45° with a scanning speed of 0.5°/min."
13,Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR and 1H NMR),"2.12 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR and 1H NMR) Spectra of 13C NMR and 1H NMR were recorded on a Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker AV II-600 MHz, AV II-400 MHz; Bruker Corporation, Switzerland) at 25 °C using deuteroxide (D2O) as the solvent."
14,Results and discussion,
15,Structures,"3.1 Structures 3.1.1 Carbonyl and carboxyl contents The relationship between formation of carbonyl and carboxyl groups during PVA oxidation is not yet completely understood. Generally, hydroxyl group is oxidized into aldehyde and ketone in the oxidation, while the aldehyde can be further oxidized to carboxyl group. Carbonyl group may consist in aldehyde, ketone, or carboxyl group in the study. Therefore, carbonyl group in oxidized PVA may be a part of carboxyl group. In other words, carbonyl should always be more than carboxyl content in the oxidized PVA prepared. The carbonyl and carboxyl contents of peroxide-oxidized PVA samples obtained from this study are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . It can be seen that the more carbonyl groups than carboxyl groups were formed for any modified PVA samples. The maximum carbonyl and carboxyl content was obtained for the oxidized PVA prepared at pH 5. It seems that the weak acid condition is conducive to the redox reaction for oxidation of the PVA. In the redox oxidation a recognized mechanism for hydrogen peroxide and copper (II) system has been proposed [15]: H2O2 ⇆ H+ + HO2 fast Cu+2 + HO2 → Cu+ + HO2· slow HO2· ⇆ H+ + ·O2 fast Cu+2 + ·O2 → Cu+ + O2 fast Cu+ + H2O2 → Cu+2 + ·OH + OH slow Cu+ + ·OH → Cu+2 + OH fast The complex reaction mechanism proceeds via a radical chain reaction. In the participation of the metal catalyst, hydrogen peroxide is rapidly decomposed to afford radicals, such as HO2·, ·O2,·OH. Taking hydroxyl radical (·OH) as an example in Fig. 3 , this highly reactive free radical readily reacts with PVA by abstracting hydrogen from a –-H group, forming a double bond in the main chain. The enol derivatives shown in the Fig. 3, due to instability, would have quickly rearranged to ketones or aldehydes, resulting in a cleavage of C–C bond and the further formation of carbonyl and/or carboxyl groups [16–18], as shown in Fig. 4 of FT-IR spectra. The new peak at around 1716 cm-1 confirmed the presence of the carbonyl or carboxyl group in the oxidized PVA sample. Being highly reactive, hydroxyl radical has been reported to react with carbohydrate rapidly [17]. There is also a possibility that the hydroxyl in PVA could be catalyzed by the Cu (II) in the oxidation to form hydroperoxides, which could be further decomposed to alkoxy and hydroxy radicals. The alkoxy radicals could then have formed carbonyls (i.e. ketones) by hydrogen abstraction. This probably explains the rapid formation of functional groups observed in Fig. 2. It is inferred that hydrogen peroxide reacted with PVA so rapidly that most of the reagent was consumed for the hydrogen abstraction, as a result of generating a large amount of carbonyl groups during the early period of reaction time within 60 min. Over this time, the oxidant was still available for oxidation of carbonyl to carboxyl groups. Results in Fig. 2 showed that carbonyl content began to decline slowly over 60 min, and carboxyl contents varied in an upward trend. It was supported that oxidation of hydroxyl groups in PVA molecules by peroxide-Cu (II) was most rapid within the first 60 min. 3.1.2 Molecular weight and distribution As shown in Fig. 5 , the 1H NMR spectra exhibited the characteristic peaks at 1.0–5.0 ppm arising from hydroxyl group and methylene group [19]. In comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of the original with oxidized PVA, it can be found that the characteristic peaks of methylene groups were decreased. This indicated cleavage of the PVA backbone due to the oxidation. In 13C NMR spectra, Fig. 6 , the triad peaks mm, mr and rr for the CH carbon appeared in the 65–69 ppm region, where m and r indicate meso and racemic diads, and mm, mr, and rr are assigned to isotactic, heterotactic, and syndiotactic, respectively [20]. As shown in Fig. 6, it was observed there was a weakened isotactic peak for the oxidized PVA after oxidation, which means a decrease of the molecular steric regularity of PVA by the reaction, more or less, along with cleavage of the backbone. The molecular weights and distributions of original and oxidized PVA samples analyzed with GPC were presented in Figs. 7 and 8 , respectively. After oxidation, it was observed that the number average molecular weight decreased from original 24,830 to 7028, and the weight average molecular weight from 91,386 to 41,374. The results indicated that oxidative treatment by the redox system caused a great degradation for PVA to the lower molecular weight. The distribution index (DI) of the PVA polymer increased from 3.68 to 5.89 as oxidized, which reflected a feature of solid-state oxidation due to an uneven reaction. 3.1.3 Crystallization analysis As shown in Fig. 9 , the original PVA has a typical crystalline structure with diffraction peaks at 2θ 11.5, 19.6°, 22.9° and 40.6°. It was observed that diffraction peaks were weakened after the oxidization at the corresponding 2 theta angles, and the calculated crystallinity values of the oxidized PVA decreased from original 54.49%–38.42% due to the destruction of the ordered packing. Depolymerization and introduction of carbonyl and carboxyl groups were shown to retard crystallization in the oxidized PVA."
16,Properties,"3.2 Properties 3.2.1 Thermal behavior DSC was carried out for the samples to measure the glass transition (T g), the critical temperature at which a polymer changes its behavior from being glassy to being rubbery. The T g values of the oxidized PVA modified at pH 5 and the original PVA can be observed during DSC thermo-scan as shown in Fig. 10 (A). T g of the original PVA was 79.6 °C and for the oxidized PVA it decreased to 67.3 °C. Both the original and oxidized PVA samples showed two endothermic peaks in Fig. 10(B), the first one corresponding to evaporation of water around 50–100 °C, and the other the crystal melting peak at the maximum of 229 °C for the original PVA and 209.6 °C for the oxidized PVA sample. The lower melting temperature (T m) and broader melting peak of the oxidized PVA than the original implied that the PVA had a relatively less perfect crystalline form and smaller crystallinity after oxidized as confirmed in Fig. 9. It could be convinced that both the lower T g and T m were attributed to the lower molecular weight and lower molecular regularity of the PVA when oxidized, and the broader melting peak was due to a broader molecular weight distribution. The lower molecular regularity could result from carbonyl and carboxyl groups distributed at random on the PVA backbone, larger DI of molecular weight distribution, complexes of PVA-copper (II) [21], and their combination. 3.2.2 Viscosity The apparent viscosity of 4% PVA aqueous solutions was measured at 20 °C. Under the test conditions, the viscosity of the original PVA was 29.0 mPa s. The lowest viscosity of the oxidized PVA was 4.6 mPa s obtained at the pH 5 of the reaction medium and reaction time 120 min for the oxidation of PVA powder (Fig. 11 ), and continued decrease slowly with increasing reaction time (Fig. 12 ). At first 120 min reaction time, the viscosity of the oxidized PVA decreased fast, and then was almost unchanged along with the time extension. The decrease in viscosity of the oxidized PVA can be attributed to the oxidative cleavage of PVA chains, which resulted in a lower molecular size of PVA. This also confirmed the results of GPC analysis. In comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 12, carbonyl and carboxyl contents as well as viscosity of oxidized PVA remained practically unchanged after the reaction time of 120 min. It seems that the reactions, causing structure change, functional group formation and molecular size reduction of PVA molecules, occurred mostly within 120 min. Furthermore, fewer changes of carbonyl and carboxyl group contents contrasted sharply with the solution viscosity in a rapid decrease pattern during 120 min reaction time for the oxidized PVA, which implies that the scission of PVA chains was in different reaction stage from the functional group formation. 3.2.3 Mechanical properties of the sample films Tensile properties, such as tensile strength, elongation at break and Young's modulus, were evaluated from the experimental data obtained for all oxidized PVA and original PVA films (Table 1 ). The tensile strength of oxidized PVA decreased due to the degradation of PVA, which was in agreement with viscosity and molecular weight analysis. 3.2.4 Surface tension measurement results From results of Table 1, it can be founded that the surface tension of the oxidized PVA was lower than the original PVA, and the minimum surface tension occurred at the pH 5 for the reaction system. It seems that the oxidized PVA became more surface active due to lower molecular weight and formation of new carbonyl and carboxyl groups."
17,Conclusions,"An oxidized PVA was prepared via a solid state process. By hydrogen peroxide-Cu (II) redox system at pH 5 and 70 °C for 120 min, PVA can be effectively oxidized. In the process, oxidation of hydroxyl groups in PVA molecules by peroxide-Cu (II) was rapid within the first 60 min, and the degradation of PVA molecules occurred almost within 120 min. The modification process had advantages to be economic, effective, energy-saving and easy to operate, and without producing any wastes. After oxidation, the modified PVA was given carbonyl and carboxyl end groups, lower molecular weight and larger distribution index, as well as decreased molecular steric regularity. The glass transition temperature and melting temperature had been lowered for the PVA oxidized, together with decreased crystallinity. As a result, the oxidized PVA was of higher surface activity, lower tensile strength and lower viscosity."
