0,Introduction,"The higher alcohols (CnH2n+1OH, n≥2) are a group of versatile additives widely used in modern petroleum industry and petro-chemistry [1,2]. For instance, the alcohols with lower carbon number (n=2–5) have been added into the fuels to improve the octane number of gasoline, promote the complete combustion or reduce the polluted emissions [3]. While the alcohols with higher carbon numbers (n36) are usually used as intermediates in the synthesis of plasticizers, detergents and lubricants [4]. Currently, higher alcohols are generally produced through two processes, i.e., (1) ALFOLÒ process based on the work of Dr. Ziegler [5], (2) Oxo process (hydroformylation process) [6]. These processes present some drawbacks, such as cumbersome steps and use of dangerous catalysts for ALFOLÒ process. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop the new approach for higher alcohols synthesis [7,8]. Benefited from its short process, adequate raw materials and clean products, a new type of Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reaction has received increasing attention, in which the high value mixed alcohols are directly obtained coupled with high quality fuels from syngas without unexpected sulfides and aromatics [9,10]. The catalysts engaged in this reaction are broadly divided into three groups, including modified methanol synthesis catalyst [11,12], alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalyst [10,13] and modified F-T synthesis catalysts [9,14]. Albemarle disclosed a group of Co-Mo sulfide catalysts, which exhibited inspiring results for the alcohols (C1-C5OH) synthesis from syngas [15–19]. The stability of the catalyst is related to the sulphur loss during the operation. The loss of sulphur resulted in the formation of the cobalt carbide and molybdenum carbide. These carbides led to the increase in the hydrocarbon selectivity and decline in selectivity towards alcohols. The supplement of sulphur during the operation would inhibit the formation of these carbides and then the performance of alcohol synthesis would remain stable over long periods of time. Pan et al. [20] and Cheng et al. [21] also reported that Co2C was active for CH4 formation. However, the role of Co2C in Cu-Co bimetallic higher alcohols synthesis catalysts was different from the patents by Albemarle. Volkova et al. [22] reported that cobalt carbide was able to activate CO non-dissociative and promoted the oxygenates synthesis. Liu et al. [23,24] demonstrated that higher alcohols synthesis over the meso-macroporous SiO2 and LaFeO3 supported Co-Cu catalysts were related to both the Co-Cu alloy and Co2C species. Davis et al. [7] deduced that the Co2C species could enhance the oxygenates selectivity in the F-T synthesis. Furthermore, it was found in our laboratory that Co/AC catalyst favored the production of longer chain alcohols (C2-C18) with higher added value [25,26]. Further research has revealed that the synergistic effect provided by the conjunction of Co and Co2C at their interfaces is more likely to be responsible for the generation of the alcohols instead of pure hydrocarbons [27]. Thus, it was inferred that Co2C in the Co/AC catalyst, which would intimately contact with metallic cobalt, was not associated with CH4 formation. These studies gave a clue that alcohols synthesis from syngas might be optimized by designing catalysts with more Co2C species intimately contacted with metallic Co to form the Co@Co2C dual active sites rather than the sole Co2C sites. Fe is another popular catalytic metal for the F-T synthesis, which possesses different hydrogenation activities from Co element [28,29]. So far, CoFe bimetallic catalysts have been extensively investigated for F-T synthesis [30–40], yet few reports have indicated that these bimetallic catalysts could produce mixed alcohols [30–32]. In the present work, the bimetallic CoFe/AC catalysts have been prepared with different impregnation strategies for the F-T synthesis. It was found that higher alcohols are successfully produced in considerable selectivity from syngas. The influence of different preparing methods on their structures, intrinsic properties, and catalytic performance is discussed here. It is suggested that the more quantity of strongly adsorbed CO, the more amount of surface active sites, appearance of the Co-Fe alloy, formation of Co2C during reaction as well as the activated carbon are responsible for the higher yield of mixed alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The support employed here was activated carbon (labeled as AC, Brilliant Tech Co. Ltd.), which was made from coconut shells and then be treated as follows: the AC was treated with diluted hydrochloric acid, then washed by de-ionized water until pH=7, and calcined at 673K for 12h, finally crushed into 40–60mesh. The bimetallic catalysts with 15wt% Co and 5wt% Fe were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation techniques under three strategies. 5Fe-15Co/AC catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation according to the following procedure. The Co(NO3)2 solution was impregnated on the AC firstly, the sample was dried in air at 333K for 12h and calcined at 623K for 6h in a flow of argon. Then the calcined Co/AC sample was impregnated by Fe(NO3)3 solution, as described above the sample was dried in air at 333K for 12h, then calcined at 623K for 6h in a flow of argon. 15Co-5Fe/AC catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation using an analogous procedure of the 5Fe-15Co/AC catalyst but with a reverse sequence. Fe(NO3)3 solution was impregnated firstly and then Co(NO3)2 solution. 15Co5Fe/AC catalyst was prepared by co-impregnation according to the following procedure. The AC support was co-impregnated by incipient-wetness technique with an aqueous solution containing Co(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3. Then, the sample was dried in air at 333K for 12h and calcined at 623K for 6h in an argon flow. The 15Co5Fe/SiO2 catalyst was prepared using the same process as stated above for reference. The monometallic cobalt and iron catalysts were synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation as references. The AC was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 or Fe(NO3)3 at room temperature, respectively. After drying in air at 333K for 12h, the samples were calcined at 623K for 6h in an argon flow, and then the catalysts were denoted as 15Co/AC or 15Fe/AC. The 15Co/SiO2 was synthesized via the same procedures."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area (SBET , BET method) and the total pore volume (Vtotal ) were determined by nitrogen physisorption at 77K on an Autosorb-1 instrument after degassing at 473K. 30mg of calcined sample was used for a test. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) tests were performed on a Tecnai G2 F30 instrument. The electron microscope was operated at 300kV. The phase analysis of the AC, fresh samples and spent catalysts were studied by means of ex-situ X-Ray diffraction (ex-situ XRD, PANalytical X’Pert3) with Cu Kα radiation. The spectra were measured over a 2θ range between 30° and 60° at 40kV and 40mA. The JCPDS library was used as standards document. The in-situ X-Ray diffraction (in-situ XRD) experiments were performed on the same instrument for ex-situ XRD using the Anton Paar XRK 900 reaction chamber. The phase transformation was monitored for the activated carbon supported samples during the temperature programmed reduction (5K/min, from room temperature to 783K) in a flow of H2. The data were collected from 2θ ranging from 20° to 70°. The patterns were collected with a temperature interval of 20K. H2-TPR experiments were carried out on a Zeton Altramira AMI-300 unit. 100mg calcined sample was packed in a quartz reactor, flushed with argon at 393K for 1h and cooled to 323K. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 1173K (10K/min) in a flow of 10% H2/Ar mixture. The hydrogen consumption was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Pulsed CO chemisorption experiments were carried out on the same equipment as TPR test. Calcined sample (100mg) was firstly in-situ reduced by 10% H2/Ar at 703K for 4h, purged with helium at the same temperature for 10min to remove adsorbed species from its surface and then cooled down to 323K. CO adsorption was carried out at 323K by means of pulse chemisorption with 10% CO/He until the TCD signal reached a constant value, signals of CO were detected by TCD. The dispersion is calculated by the formula below [33]. % dispersion = [ 1.175 × ( μ mol / g CO ) ] / [ ( % metal ) × ( reduction percentage ) ] CO-TPD experiments were carried out on a Zeton Altramira AMI-300 unit. 100mg of calcined sample was used for each test. The operations for CO adsorption were the same as the experiments of pulsed CO chemisorption. After the adsorption completed, the samples were purged with helium at 323K for 10min and heated to 1173K at a heating ramp rate of 10K/min under a helium flow at 30ml/min. The products of desorption experiments were simultaneously traced with an Omnistar 300 quadrupole mass spectrometer and TCD. The XPS tests were performed on Thermo Escalab250Xi instrument using X-ray source of Mg Kα with a power of 300W to measure the surface composition of the samples. The calcined powder samples were reduced by H2 (703K, 5h) in the quartz tube reactor, and then pressed onto the conductive double-tape attached to one sample holder in the glovebox. Finally, the sample holder was introduced into the measurement chamber for analysis. All spectra were corrected by referring the binding energy of the C1s neutral carbon peak at 284.6eV. The atomic surface compositions were calculated using the formula below [41]. n i n j = I i I j × σ j σ i × E k j 0.5 E k i 0.5 where, nx, Ekx, and σx are the number of atoms of element x, the kinetic energy value, and the cross-section calculated theoretically, respectively. I stand for the XPS line intensity."
4,Catalytic performance evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation The performance tests were carried out in a stainless fixed-bed reactor (I.D., 9mm). Typically, 1.3g catalysts diluted by 3g quartz were packed in the reactor, in-situ reduced at 703K for 10h in a flow of H2 at atmospheric pressure. After the samples were cooled to 353K, the H2 flow was switched to syngas (H2/CO=2, GHSV=4L-syngas/g-cat.h), and the pressure was increased to 3.0MPa. Then, the furnace was heating to the reaction temperature in two stages, first from 353 to 473K, then to 493K with ramping rates of 2K/min and 0.1K/min, respectively. The reaction effluent passed through two traps for the collection of products, one maintained at 373K and the other at 273K. The moment when the reactor reached the desired temperature was taken as the starting time. The data were all taken after 44h of reaction, when a stationary activity had been reached. The tail gases were on-line analyzed by an Agilent 7890A GC with one packed column of Plot Q and TCD as a detector. The liquid organic products and the aqueous products were off-line analyzed on an Agilent 7890A GC with HP-5 capillary columns and FID as a detector. CO conversion and carbon selectivity were calculated by following formulas: X CO = F in , CO − F out , CO F in , CO × 100 S i = ( N i × n i ∑ ⁣ N i × n i ) × 100 where XCO stands for CO conversion, F indicates the molar flow, Si is the carbon selectivity toward a product i (including paraffin, olefin, CO2 and alcohol), Ni is the molar fraction of product i, ni is the carbon number of product i."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The BET specific surface area (SBET ) and pore volume (Vtotal ) of the calcined catalysts as well as AC carrier are summarized in Table 1 . Compared with the AC support, the SBET of the 15Co/AC catalyst decreased by more than 20%, and a slight decrease in Vtotal was observed. The main reason for the loss of the SBET should be attributed to the “dilution effect” of the 15% cobalt incorporation [42]. Thus, it could be suggested that the pore blockage during the preparation procedures was another factor for the decrease in SBET [43]. The SBET and Vtotal of bimetallic catalysts are smaller than those of 15Co/AC due to the iron doping. The SBET of bimetallic catalysts decreased by larger than 30% compared to AC support, and the Vtotal also decreased by greater than 23%. However, the different preparation methods had little effect on the SBET and Vtotal of the bimetallic catalysts. The reducibility of monometallic cobalt and iron samples as well as bimetallic catalysts was assessed by H2-TPR experiments. The corresponding profiles are shown in Fig. 1 . Several hydrogen consumption peaks were observed in the TPR profiles of the catalysts. The TPR profile of 15Co/AC sample exhibited three major peaks of hydrogen consumption at 506K, 619K, and a broad one at 770K respectively. The low temperature peak at 506K could be attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, while the peak at 619K was assigned to the subsequent reduction of CoO to Co [44]. The broad hydrogen consumption peak at 770K might be assigned to methanation of the AC support in the presence of metallic Co [45]. There are four major peaks of hydrogen consumption at 630K, 742K, 824K and a broad one at 865K for 15Fe/AC sample. The first three peaks could be assigned to the following consecutive reduction steps: α-Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 →FeO→Fe [31]. The fourth broad peak is related to the methanation of AC support, which is similar to the 15Co/AC catalyst. Especially, we studied the effect of iron doping with different methods on the reduction behaviors of catalysts. It can be seen that the reducibility of the bimetallic catalysts was similar to the 15Co/AC (Fig. 1). For all the samples, H2 consumption peaks attributed to the reductions of cobalt species as well as methanation of the AC support were detected. It was also observed that the cobalt species went through consecutive reduction consisting of Co3O4 →CoO→Co in bimetallic catalysts. Compared to Co/AC catalyst, the position of the reduction peak of Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to Co shifted to higher temperature for the 15Co5Fe/AC and 5Fe-15Co/AC catalysts, indicating that the iron doping suppressed the reduction of cobalt species. However, the reduction behavior of cobalt species in the 15Co-5Fe/AC sample was similar to the 15Co/AC. This result implied that the impregnation strategy of bimetallic CoFe/AC catalysts could influence the reduction of the cobalt species. The reduction degree of metal could be calculated based on the TPR profiles, which were summaried in Table 1. For 15Co/AC catalyst, the Co reduction degree reached 98.7%. In contrast, the metal reduction degree of the 15Co-5Fe/AC, 15Co5Fe/AC and 5Fe-15Co/AC catalysts were calculated to be 64.9%, 68.1% and 70.3%, respectively. This indicated that the reduction degree of Co and Fe was strongly reduced due to doping of Fe while showed little relationship with the impregnation strategy of catalysts. To access the phase transformation during the reduction in a H2 flow, in-situ XRD measurements were performed here. Fig. 2 shows in-situ XRD patterns of monometallic and bimetallic samples under reduction as a function of temperature. For the 15Co/AC sample, CoO was the dominant phase until 513K. The peak at 2θ=44.1° ascribed to fcc-Co (PDF No. 00-001-1259) was observed at reduction temperature of 533K. This suggested that the reduction of CoO into metallic Co started at about 513–533K. The peaks for CoO disappeared completely when the temperature was higher than 693K. The observation was consistent with the H2-TPR measurement. For the 15Fe/AC sample, Fe2O3 (2θ=24.1, 33.1, 35.6, 40.8, 49.4, 54.0, 57.5, 62.4 and 64.0°, PDF No. 00-024-0072) was the primary phase at low temperature (<513K). The reduction of Fe2O3 into Fe3O4 (2θ=30.0, 35.4, 37.1, 43.0, 53.5, 57.1 and 62.7°, PDF No. 01-075-0033) started at around 513–533K. Furthermore, the conversion of Fe3O4 to Fe (2θ=44.4 and 64.5°, PDF No. 01-085-1410) occurred at about 573–593K. In other words, the metallic iron phase could be obtained under the activation temperature used in this study (703K). The in-situ XRD patterns of bimetallic catalysts during reduction are also shown in Fig. 2(c–e). It is obvious that the Fe3O4 and CoO were predominant species in the bimetallic samples at low temperature. The peaks at 44.8 and 65.0° attributed to Co-Fe alloy (PDF No. 03-065-7519) were observed when the temperature was increased to 573K. This revealed that the iron doping suppressed the reduction of cobalt oxide species. The intensities of the peaks increased with the continuous increasing of temperature. The temperatures for the arising of Co-Fe alloy were similar for the all bimetallic catalysts (553–573K). This demonstrated that the methods for the doping of iron had a little effect on the reduction properties, which is in accordance with the results of the H2-TPR (Fig. 1 and Table 1). XRD patterns of the fresh monometallic catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . Diffraction peak ascribed to fcc-Co (44.1°) was observed for the 15Co/AC catalyst. Besides, the peak at 36.8° attributed to cobalt oxide was also noticed. The cobalt oxide species might be produced during the passivation process. For the 15Fe/AC catalyst, diffraction peak at 44.4° was detected, which was ascribed to metallic Fe. The diffraction peak of Fe3O4 at 35.4° was also observed. Fig. 3 also shows the XRD patterns of the spent monometallic catalysts. The peaks attributed to fcc-Co, hcp-Co and Co2C species were detected in the spent 15Co/AC sample. In addition to the peaks of Fe3O4, characteristic peaks of Fe2C species at 39.3, 41.4 and 44.4°(PDF No. 00-003-1022) were observed in the pattern of the spent Fe/AC catalyst. The results revealed that the Co2C or Fe2C species formed during the progress of CO hydrogenation. Fig. 3 also shows the XRD patterns of the fresh and spent bimetallic catalysts prepared by different impregnation sequences. The peak at 2θ=44.8° assigned to Co-Fe alloy appeared in all of the fresh samples, but the diffraction peaks for metallic Co and Fe could not be detected. It might be because the peaks of Co and Fe species may overlap with those of the Co-Fe alloy. It could be concluded from Fig. 3 that the quantity of metallic cobalt sites in the 15Co-5Fe/AC sample was the maximum, while the 5Fe-15Co/AC catalyst had the fewest metallic cobalt sites. This result is in line with the quantitative XPS analysis results that are summarized in Table 1. As the report [39] uncovered that metallic cobalt sites showed higher activity of CO hydrogenation under the moderate conditions. Based on the above observation, it could be expected that the activity difference observed in our experiments were partly related to the available metallic cobalt sites of the catalysts. It could be seen from Fig. 3 that Co2C appeared in the spent catalysts. In addition, the XRD line width from Co-Fe alloy changed during the reaction. This suggested that the structure of the active sites changed during the CO hydrogenation reaction. This observation was in agreement with our previous results in which Co2C species was detected over the Ca or La promoted the Co/AC catalysts [14,25]. It is preferred that not only the dual active of metallic Co and Co2C but also the Co-Fe alloy may be responsible for the synthesis of alcohols in our catalysts. To see the role of the activated carbon used as support and the effect of the Co-Fe alloy as active sites on the synthesis of alcohols, the phase composition of the silica supported Co and CoFe catalysts were investigated. The XRD patterns of the used 15Co/SiO2 and 15Co5Fe/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The peak at 2θ=44.8° assigned to Co-Fe alloy was observed over the spent 15Co5Fe/SiO2 catalyst. Besides, fcc Co was observed both in the spent 15Co/SiO2 and 15Co5Fe/SiO2 catalysts. This suggested that the Co-Fe alloy was partly related to the alcohol formation. Based on the results of Table 2 , it could be seen that the activated carbon support was more suitable for the alcohol synthesis compared to SiO2. According to Wang et al. [46], the activated carbon facilitated the formation of Co2C species, while Al2O3 restricted it. And Pei et al. reported that the excess addition of SiO2 to Co/AC catalyst inhibited the Co2C formation [26]. Thus, the lower selectivity to alcohols over the Co/SiO2 catalyst was attributed to the inhibiting effect of SiO2 on the formation of Co2C. The crystalline structure of Co2C in the bimetallic catalysts was further confirmed by HRTEM measurements. Fig. 5 (a–c) display the HRTEM micrographs of the used 15Co-5Fe/AC, 15Co5Fe/AC and 5Fe-15Co/AC catalysts, respectively. The 15Co-5Fe/AC sample (Fig. 5a) showed the characteristic spacing of 2.39Å and 3.18Å as well as the angle of 70° between two lattice spacings for the Co2C (011) and Co2C (110) planes and their corresponding angle (according to PDF 01-072-1369). The particle with a measured lattice spacing of 2.03Å was assigned to (111) plane of fcc-Co in the image. Co2C (020) and Co2C (002) planes and the corresponding angle were observed in the spent 15Co5Fe/AC sample in Fig. 5b. Characteristic planes of Co2C (011) and Co2C (110) as well as their angle were detected in the used 5Fe-15Co/AC sample in Fig. 5c. These observations confirmed that the Co2C species were formed in the bimetallic catalysts during the CO hydrogenation, as shown by XRD results previously. Based on the previous investigations of our group [14,25–27] and other researchers [46,47] as well as the result of this work, the formation of Co2C during the reaction seems to be pivotal for the synthesis of alcohols over the activated carbon supported bimetallic catalysts. CO uptakes and metal dispersion of the catalysts are exhibited in Table 1. It is obvious that 15Co-5Fe/AC sample shows the maximum CO uptake as well as dispersion degree compared to the 15Co5Fe/AC and 5Fe-15Co/AC catalysts. This suggested that the 15Co-5Fe/AC catalyst had the largest quantity of surface active sites, which reinforced by the XPS analysis. Detailed XPS analysis in the region of Co 2p and Fe 2p is given in Fig. 6 , respectively. It could be seen that catalysts containing cobalt are characterized by Co 2p3/2 peaks at 780.7eV and Co 2p1/2 peaks at 796.3eV. Satellite peaks for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 were also observed at 786.3 and 802.9eV respectively. These observations suggested that cobalt was present on catalyst surface as CoO [48]. Peaks for Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 were detected at 711.1 and 724.6eV respectively. These indicated that the surface iron was presented as Fe2O3 [49] . The oxide species appeared due to the sample transfer process, during which the sample probably contacted with air. Based on the XPS analysis, the content of Co on the surface decreased in the order of 15Co-5Fe/AC>15Co5Fe/AC>5Fe-15Co/AC, whereas the Fe content increased. As shown in Table 2, the 15Co/AC catalyst was more active than the 15Fe/AC catalyst under the present conditions. This demonstrated that the catalyst with more cobalt sites would be more active for CO hydrogenation. As we know, CO hydrogenation is favored by high metal dispersion and overall active sites [50]. Thus, the 15Co-5Fe/AC catalyst had the highest Co dispersion and the abundant Co active sites, which led to the highest catalytic activity among these CoFe bimetallic catalysts. CO-TPD was used to investigate the effect of impregnation strategy on the CO adsorption behavior of the CoFe bimetallic catalysts, as presented in Fig. 7 . Five CO desorption peaks were observed in each TPD profile. The desorption peak of CO at about 400K is due to desorption of CO adsorbed on Co2+ sites [51]. The peak appeared in high temperature at around 1100K might be assigned to the decomposition of organic species on surface of activated carbon [52]. The peak at 700K was ascribed to desorption of a weakly adsorbed CO, while the other two peaks situated between 800K and 1000K would arise from a strongly adsorbed CO [53,54]. It was found that using different impregnation strategy did not obviously impact on the position of desorption temperature of CO, indicating that the ability of the CoFe bimetallic catalysts for activation of CO was not influenced by the impregnation sequences. However, the areas of the desorption peaks, especially for the peak areas of the strong adsorbed CO sites, varied much with the different impregnation sequences. As we know, only strongly adsorbed CO species on Co sites was dissociative adsorption and further could be hydrogenated in F-T reaction. The amount of the CO capacity strongly adsorbed increased in the order of 5Fe-15Co/AC<15Co5Fe/AC<15Co-5Fe/AC. This means that the 15Co-5Fe/AC catalyst prepared by sequential impregnation with Fe precursor firstly and then Co precursor has the most of the quantity of the active sites for CO hydrogenation. On the basis of the above observations, it can be concluded that the activity of bimetallic catalysts are partly based on the quantity of cobalt sites for strongly adsorbed CO."
7,The performance of CO hydrogenation,"3.2 The performance of CO hydrogenation The results of F-T reaction are listed in Table 2. Both of the 15Co/AC and 15Fe/AC catalysts produced simultaneously hydrocarbons and alcohols, and the alcohols selectivity is around 17%. The selectivities to alcohols are 17.5% and 1.8% for 15Co/AC catalyst and 15Co/SiO2 catalyst, respectively. The lower selectivity to alcohols for 15Co/SiO2 catalyst is in accord with the results of studies using inorganic oxide supported monometallic cobalt catalyst with poor selectivity towards alcohols [30–32]. Whereas, it has been reported by Matsuzaki et al. that SiO2 supported cobalt catalyst is active for the alcohols formation [55–57]. They claimed that the alcohols formation was attributed to the highly dispersed metallic cobalt sites and corresponding bridged-CO species. However, the alcohols formation over the Co/AC catalyst is related to the promotion effect on the development of Co2C species from activated carbon. The formation of Co2C species and the intimate contact between Co2C species and Co sites was responsible for the alcohols synthesis [27]. The high selectivity towards alcohols of 15Fe/AC catalyst might result from the difficult dissociation of CO on the iron clusters. This implied that iron addition into cobalt catalysts might be beneficial for the alcohols synthesis. The performances of CO hydrogenation over the bimetallic catalysts are also presented in Table 2. Under the moderate reaction conditions, hydrocarbons, CO2 and alcohols were produced via F-T synthesis. It was found that the CO conversion decreased in the order of the 15Co-5Fe/AC>15Co5Fe/AC>5Fe-15Co/AC. The CO conversion of the 15Co-5Fe/AC catalyst is as high as 30.9%, which is nearly twice of the 15Co5Fe/AC and 5Fe-15CO/AC catalysts. Based on the results of the previous characterization, it was observed that different impregnation sequence modified the structure of the catalysts and resulted in the variety of CO adsorption capacity, reduction property and the quantity of the Co active sites on the surface of the bimetallic CoFe/AC catalysts, thus leading to the catalytic activity. The selectivity to alcohols of the activated carbon supported CoFe bimetallic catalysts were higher than that of the activated carbon supported Co-based or Fe-based monometallic catalysts, indicating that there were synergistic effect between Co and Fe species. According to the results of XRD, it might originate from the formation of Co-Fe alloy, confirmed by XRD measurements of the spent bimetallic catalysts, which was favorable to the synthesis of alcohols. However, it was observed that the selectivity towards alcohols was hardly affected by the impregnation sequence. It was also found that the iron doping into the silica supported cobalt catalyst led to the increase of the alcohols selectivity from 1.8 to 7.0%, but it was still far lower than that of the 15Co5Fe/AC catalyst (around 20%). It can be suggested that the iron doping on the 15Co/SiO2 catalysts favored the formation of Co-Fe alloy, which promoted the production of alcohols. This is in accord with the results reported by O’shea et al. [30], Dalai et al. [31] and Silva et al. [32]. Therefore, the existence of Co-Fe alloy was partly responsible for the alcohols synthesis for CoFe bimetallic catalysts. However, the relatively lower alcohols selectivity of SiO2 supported catalysts compared to the activated carbon supported catalysts mainly resulted from the absence of Co2C species. In combination with the previous phase analysis of the catalysts, it was deduced that the activated carbon promoted the formation of Co2C, while the silica suppressed the formation of Co2C. This deduction is in accordance with the result of Wang’s work [46]. They found that the doping with La onto activated carbon supported Co catalyst promoted the Co2C phase formation, whereas it is largely suppressed on alumina supported Co catalyst. And our previous research proved that the introduction of relatively abundant amount of silica into activated carbon supported cobalt catalyst significantly inhibited the formation of Co2C [26]. Based on the above analysis, the activated carbon promoted the Co2C development and thus facilitated the production of alcohols. Thus, it can be suggested that the alcohols synthesis with bimetallic catalysts under the test conditions is the combined catalytic action of Co/Co2C and Co-Fe alloy species. As shown in Table 2, the product selectivity of the AC supported monometallic Co, Fe and bimetallic CoFe catalysts were compared at a similar CO conversion level ((28±4)%). It could be observed that the selectivity of alcohol and hydrocarbon was almost the same under conditions of the different GHSV for each catalyst, indicating that the selectivity was not obviously influenced by CO conversion ranged from 10 to 30%. Table 2 also shows the alcohols distributions of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The main alcohols products for all of the catalysts contained linear alcohols fell in the range of C1 to C18, which was same as our previous results [14,25], but was different from the conclusion of other groups’ reports [30–32] with the C1 to C5 alcohols as products. In the case of the bimetallic CoFe/AC catalysts, the fraction of C2-C5 alcohols reached ca. 60%. The product distribution and yields varied with the variation of the preparation method. The distributions of the liquid phase products, made up of fuels (C5+ hydrocarbons) and alcohols (methanol and C2+ alcohols) are given in Fig. 8 . It was found that alcohol fraction in the liquid phase product is up to around 65% over the bimetallic catalysts. In other words, nearly two-thirds of the liquid products are alcohols over the bimetallic catalysts."
8,Conclusions,"The activity, selectivity and product distributions of the bimetallic CoFe/AC catalysts were found to depend strongly on the impregnation strategy of the catalysts. The results showed that the linear alcohols (C1-C18OH) together with fuels can be directly synthesized from syngas over the bimetallic CoFe/AC catalysts under mild conditions, and the alcohols fraction in the liquid phase products reached up to 65%. The 15Co-5Fe/AC catalyst prepared with impregnation of Fe precursor firstly and then Co precursor exhibited the highest activity, which is attributed to the highest CO uptake and dispersion as well as the maximum content of cobalt active sites on the surface of the catalyst. The Co-Fe alloy was observed in the CoFe bimetallic catalysts. The activated carbon acted as a key factor in facilitating the formation of Co2C species and thus promoting higher alcohols synthesis in CO hydrogenation. Higher alcohol synthesis via CO hydrogenation over the activated carbon supported CoFe bimetallic catalysts is associated with the combined catalytic action of synergistic effect of Co with Co2C and Co with Fe species."
