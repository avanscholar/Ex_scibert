0,Introduction,"Basic needs of person in today’s world for all residential, commercial, transportation and industrial activities are met by energy [1]. From driving to lighting vehicles, manufacturing products to heating or cooling the buildings, all functions require energy [2]. Thus, there is great requirement for energy and this is further going to increase within two decades [3]. Today for most of our energy requirements, we rely on exhaustible energy sources [4]. These energy sources include coal, natural gas and oil that are depleting rapidly due to their huge consumption [5]. Moreover, these energy sources are a great cause of global warming as carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emitted by these fossil fuels, is quite harmful for environment [6]."
1,Non-renewable energy sources,"1.1 Non-renewable energy sources Earth has limited amount of fossil fuels. Various exhaustible sources of energy are as depicted in Fig. 1 . We will discuss about these sources in brief: 1.1.1 Coal Exhaustible energy source coal formed by decay of plants under the earth’s surface is major source of electricity, thereby helping in power generation [7,8]. However, coal is also a major source of carbon, which combines with oxygen later on and produces CO2 gas [9]. CO2 is significantly responsible for greenhouse emissions [10]. Coal mining also produces methane, which contributes 25 times more CO2 towards greenhouse thereby contributing significantly towards global warming [11]. Though, there are disadvantages associated with coal, still its consumption has increased manifold, which has led to environmental and ecological imbalance [12]. Thus switching over to greener technology is necessary, as coal reserves will hardly last more than 50 years [13]. 1.1.2 Oil Oil being the most important fuel in vehicles and is major contributor towards world economy [14]. Maximum oil wells exist in middle east countries like in Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, UAE and Saudi Arabia, though some wells exist in North America and Canada [15]. Oil reserves are also results of dead plants and animals buried under huge pressure of sand and mud [16]. However, increased usage of oil has resulted in massive air pollution. Burning of oil leads to CO2 gas emission [17]. Pipelines or ships [18] help in transportation of oil. Oil spill condition also arises causing havoc for flora and fauna in and around sea [19]. 1.1.3 Natural Gas One of the fuel that causes no pollution and burns completely without leaving ashes is natural gas [20]. It comprises of many gases like ethane, methane, propane and butane [21]. Iran and Iraq has large reserves of natural gas [22]. It is quite cheap and environment friendly source [23]. 1.1.4 Nuclear Energy Most countries in today’s world are shifting towards nuclear energy for energy requirement [24]. Nuclear energy influences world economy at politics significantly. Nuclear reactors are technically classified as thermal neutron reactors [25]. In these power plants two processes are used, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion [26]. Nuclear reactions lead to radioactive waste, which emit harmful radiations and should therefore be disposed of properly. Another drawback of nuclear energy is its role in nuclear bombs [27]. Thus, a switch towards more reliable and safe energy source is the requirement of the century [28]."
2,Alternative to exhaustible energy sources,"1.2 Alternative to exhaustible energy sources Non-replenishable energy resources have reached point of saturation after their long usage [29]. Rapid exploitation of these resources have led to many problems such as land and air pollution, increased global warming, acid rains, climatic change and change in seasons [30]. Thus, a renewable clean alternative is the prime requisite now [31]. Different sustainable energy sources comprise solar, hydrogen, biomass, tidal and geothermal energy [32]. These resources are replenished easily and would never run out [33]. The speed of renewable energy resources have paced up only in few decades and many countries are investing significantly to harness these resources [34]. Different renewable (Fig. 2 ) sources of energy are: 1.2.1 Solar Energy Solar energy is harnessed by employment of technologies like photovoltaics, solar heating, solar electricity and solar process space heating and cooling [35]. Various solar energy projects are going on in India and across different countries [36]. US and China are encouraging policies for solar harvesting. In the U.S. alone, currently 22.7 GW of solar panels are in operation [37]. Since the cost of installation and fabrication of solar panels is dropping, customers [38] would favour this technology. 1.2.2 Geothermal Energy It is the thermal energy, produced by radioactive decay of minerals and is utilised in many fields like drying eatables, electricity generation, heating buildings and sidewalks to prevent freezing on roads [39,40]. Geothermal energy harnessed widely in the US and direct economic benefit of $280 million per year is incurred [41]. 1.2.3 Hydrogen Energy Most abundant and simplest element on planet is hydrogen [42]. It has highest energy content amongst all the existing energy sources and low polluting fuel. Hence it could be utilised in transportation, electricity generation and heating [43]. 1.2.4 Bio Energy Chemical energy stored in organic material is bio-energy which is utilised in electricity generation [44,45]. Though biomass is not clean source as the gases like oxides (sulphurous, nitrous), and particulate matter (PM) are emitted by burning biomass, biogas and biofuels, which are harmful for the environment [46]."
3,Hydrogen energy,"Reviews drawn from different sources help us to draw a conclusion that the best sustainable fuel is hydrogen. It is magnificent green fuel, which offers remarkable merits over other energy sources viz; i) Efficiency higher (65%) as compared to diesel (45%) or gasoline (22%) [47]; ii) Compatibility of hydrogen with fuel cell [48]; iii) Higher energy content then gasoline or diesel [49]; iv) Produces renewal waste product i.e. water [50]. Hydrogen is therefore an important renewable energy source, thus the storage of hydrogen to make its usage possible is also an important task [51]. It is simple element and quite abundant on earth’s crust [52]. It is vital for life and present in almost all elements in combined form [53]. Hydrogen powers the universe with its presence in stars where proton-proton reactions occur [54]. It is extremely flammable gas and acts as a fuel in space shuttle engines [55]. Utilization of hydrogen is also done for processing of fossil fuels [56]."
4,Hydrogen economy,"The infrastructure used to support the energy requirements through hydrogen instead of fossil fuels is hydrogen economy [57]. The main elements of hydrogen economy (Fig. 3 ) comprises of production, delivery, storage, conversion and application [58]. Hydrogen being different from other fuels is difficult to store and transport as compared to energy obtained from other fuels such as electricity or a battery [43]. It is not as stable as other fossil fuels and thus synthesis of hydrogen requires energy [59]. Even special arrangements are required to store hydrogen since it is very flammable and also rusts easily and oxidises in storage containers and pipelines [60]. Thus in order to use hydrogen fuel for different automotive, electrical or other applications, its physical state needs changes for efficient energy applications."
5,Benefits of hydrogen energy,"Hydrogen is a green fuel and is quite abundant in nature. It is colourless, odourless, tasteless and non-toxic. However, it occurs in nature widely in combined form. It takes great deal of different processes to separate it from the source element. In addition, the hydrogen energy is environmental friendly since it does not leave any toxic emissions or waste products during its synthesis or working. Rather we get reusable water as the by-product, which can be utilised further to produce more hydrogen [50]. The fuel cells using hydrogen as fuel source are quite powerful when compared with other fossil fuel sources. An asset of hydrogen energy is also that it has cheap maintenance cost, though the initial installation price may be high. Its commercial use in chemical industries makes it highly reliable for use in food, microelectronics, chemical and polymer synthesis industries, petrochemical and metallurgical process industries. The most important aspect of hydrogen energy is its renewability and ease to synthesize large quantity of hydrogen by different methods, which include electrolysis of water, photochemical process and other process like thermochemical decompositions [52]."
6,Hydrogen sources,"Hydrogen is not available in direct form, thus various methods are used for hydrogen production [61]. The methods used are steam reforming, electrolysis, photocatalytic, fermentative and enzymatic [62]."
7,Steam reforming,"5.1 Steam reforming Hydrogen production from hydrocarbons is extensively done by this method [63]. Here mostly natural gas is utilised, which is heated in presence of steam and nickel catalyst. A highly exothermic reaction occurs which gives rise to carbon monoxide and hydrogen [64]. Significant quantities of hydrogen is generated when carbon mono-oxide (CO) is passed with steam over iron oxide resulting from water gas shifting reaction. However, downside of the reaction is that CO, CO2 and other greenhouse gases are generated which are all the more harmful for environment [65]. (1) CH4+ H2O → CO + 3H2 (2) CO + H2O → CO2+ H2"
8,Electrolysis,"5.2 Electrolysis Hydrogen is also generated using electricity to split water molecule [66]. This method can be used anywhere as simple tap water conversion to hydrogen can be utilized in fuel cell [67]. However, it is very expensive approach as the electricity required for splitting is costlier then the hydrogen generated [68]."
9,Thermochemical cycle,"5.3 Thermochemical cycle In this reaction heat serves as an aid for hydrogen and oxygen generation from water by using chemical reactions [69]. In this cycle all chemical compounds i.e. hydrogen, oxygen and water are recycled [69]. If electricity used as input then it is termed as a hybrid thermochemical cycle [70]."
10,Photo biological water splitting,"5.4 Photo biological water splitting Water splitting photobiologically is competent method for large-scale hydrogen production [71]. Photo biological process is quite similar to photosynthesis [72]. In this algal cell, water splits under the influence of sunlight into oxygen, protons and electrons [73]."
11,Photocatalytic water splitting,"5.5 Photocatalytic water splitting Clean hydrogen production by using solar energy can be carried out by photo-catalytic water splitting [74]. Water splitting is an environment friendly approach, which produces zero carbon dioxide emissions and has quite low operating temperature [75]. This technology has various economic and environmental benefits and thus generating hydrogen by this method can easily meet energy shortage and help in relieving environmental issues [76]."
12,Fermentative hydrogen production,5.6 Fermentative hydrogen production This is a method to produce hydrogen by biological method [77]. It is advantageous as a rapid and simple production technique [78]. It uses organic waste for hydrogen production [79]. This process is done using bacteria where bacteria feeds on hydrocarbon and produces hydrogen and CO2 [80].
13,Enzymatic hydrogen generation,5.7 Enzymatic hydrogen generation In this reaction hydrogen gas is generated from glucose molecules [81]. Cell-free synthetic enzymatic pathway biotransformation is the key technology implemented in this reaction [82]. Chemist also refer to it as a water splitting reaction of carbohydrate whereby hydrogen is generated from waste heat [83]. C6H10O5+ 7H2O → 12 H2+ 6 CO2 (3) This technology also laid foundation of sugar fuel cell vehicles [84].
14,Applications of hydrogen,"The ideal alteration for fossil fuels is hydrogen as it is green and energy efficient as compared to other fuels. It is widely used in different applications [85]. The main applications being: 1 Hydrogen fuel cell - These fuel cells generate energy from oxygen and hydrogen leaving water as clean by product [86]. These electrochemical cells are environmental friendly [87] and we can employ fuel cells as a fuel source in submarines, cars, space crafts [88], etc. 2 Industrial applications of hydrogen energy - Hydrogen has wide applications in food and chemical industry [89]. It is useful in food industry to make hydrogenated vegetable oil [90]. Petrochemical industry also employs hydrogen for refinement of crude oil [91]. Hydrogen employed in chemical industry for extraction of metal [92]. 3 Fuel source in vehicles- It is replacing coal, natural gas and diesel oil in buses, trucks, submarines, ships, cars and rockets [93]. 4 Electricity generation- Hydrogen is used as fuel in various power plants [94]. 5 Weather balloons - Hydrogen gas filled in the weather balloons by meteorologist to give weather forecasts [95]. 6 Synthesis of chemical compounds- Hydrogen used to produce various chemical compounds [96]. Like for synthesis of ammonia hydrogen is required in large amount along with nitrogen [97]."
15,Hydrogen storage,"Suitable and sustainable materials for hydrogen storage should be utilised for hydrogen economy [98]. Various theoretical and experimental studies related to hydrogen storage have been reported [99]. Chief phenomenon considered in hydrogen storage are physiosorption whereby molecular hydrogen is stored and other is chemisorption whereby atomic hydrogen is stored [42]. The efficiency of these hydrogen storage materials is dependent on two important aspects considerably gravimetric and volumetric density as the material should be both light and compact [100]. Gravimetric density of material is measured by dividing weight of hydrogen stored by weight of system (hydrogen + container) whereas volumetric density is measured by dividing mass of hydrogen stored to unit volume of system [101]. Different hydrogen storage approaches include using high pressure, compressed gas, cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage, solid state and electrochemical [102]. Solid-state hydrogen storage easily done in materials like metal hydrides, complex hydrides, carbon containing materials like activated carbon, graphene and carbon nanotubes [103]. However, criteria of gravimetric capacity, thermodynamics and kinetics are not well satisfied by these methods [104]. Thus, electrochemical storage of hydrogen is a good alternative where hydrogen is generated insitu and stored easily at ambient temperature and pressure [105]. Simplistic integration of this electrochemical hydrogen storage system done easily with fuel cell system [106]. Different types of materials are used for hydrogen storage."
16,Why hydrogen storage?,"7.1 Why hydrogen storage? There is day-by-day depletion of fossil fuels and thus relying on renewable green energy source is essential to meet the energy requirements. Hydrogen is a great energy source and has efficient compatibility with fuel cell. It has high specific energy compared to other conventional fuels. For example, the energy content of 9.5 kg of hydrogen and 25 kg of gasoline are equivalent [107]. Hydrogen is lightest element and has least density, it is stored with great difficulty thereby requiring more volume for given amount of energy. Hydrogen can be easily transported and stored in materials. Hydrogen storage is the principle technology for advancement in fuel cell and other related fields [108]."
17,Various hydrogen storage methods,"Storage of hydrogen is done by different methods. Conventional methods to store hydrogen involve compression of gas and liquefaction [109]. However, due to the safety problems involved with these methods, alternatives are looked for hydrogen storage. There was development of solid-state material for hydrogen storage [110]. Materials are absorbed or adsorbed on these materials. Studies related to hydrogen storage can also be done theoretically using simulations. Ab-initio first principle calculations help to predict the ability of the material for hydrogen storage [111]."
18,Electrochemical hydrogen storage,"Hydrogen is the greatest energy carrier but in order to utilize it perfectly, synthesis should be cautiously done, as it occurs mostly in combined state [112]. There are various drawbacks in conventional hydrogen storage for gaseous and liquid hydrogen and thus relying on electrochemical hydrogen storage is a better approach [113]. In an electrochemical hydrogen storage method, atomic hydrogen adsorbs onto hydrogen storage material on electrochemical decomposition of an aqueous medium [114]. In this process, molecular hydrogen dissociation into atomic hydrogen is absent, hence important limitation of hydrogen storage is overcome [115]. The applications of electrochemical method are quite high because of its availability and accuracy [116]. One of the most important aspect which further enhances the importance of electrochemical hydrogen storage is that here hydrogen ions are stored as mobile charges [117]."
19,Mechanism of electrochemical hydrogen storage,"9.1 Mechanism of electrochemical hydrogen storage Electrochemical nature of the material is examined by utilizing technique like voltammetry and amperometry [118], charge-discharge potentials [119], electronic impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and various similar electrochemical methods in an aqueous medium [120]. The oxidation peak of the samples are observed, and integrating these peaks, we can simply get the amount of hydrogen stored in the sample [121]. Another approach is to calculate the discharge potential of a sample as the amount of hydrogen stored is directly proportional to the discharge capacity [122]. Two mechanisms basically govern electrochemical hydrogen storage, firstly adsorption on the exterior and secondly insertion into bulk of sample [117]. Decisive mechanisms governing electrochemical hydrogen sorption are three-step processes, involving Volmer, Tafel and Heyrovsky reactions [123]. Preliminary step involved is charge transfer mechanism occurring at electrode/electrolyte interface represented in Eq. (4) (4) H2O + M + e− ↔ MHads + OH- Eq. (4) represents volmer reaction where reduction of water to hydroxyl ion occurs and even adsorption of hydrogen atoms onto the electrode surface [124]. Atoms are adsorbed by host material leading to formation of subsurface hydrogen (Hss). (5) MHads↔ MHss These subsurface hydrogen atoms are then, finally diffused into bulk as Habs (6) MHss↔ MHabs Sidewise Tafel reaction also takes place where adsorbed hydrogen atoms recombine to gaseous hydrogen [125]. (7) 2 MHads↔H2 (g) + 2 M Heyrovsky reaction occurs where hydrogen atoms form hydrogen molecule by dissociation of hydrogen atom from water molecule. (8) MHads + H 2 O + e− ↔ M+ H2 (g) +OH−"
20,Methods used for electrochemical hydrogen storage,"Three methods employed for electrochemical hydrogen storage, namely 1) Galvonastatic method of charge-discharge. 2) Cyclic Voltammetric, chronoamperometric and linear voltammetric method. 3) Electronic Impedance Spectroscopy."
21,Galvano static behaviour of charge-discharge,"10.1 Galvano static behaviour of charge-discharge In this method, initially we charge the electrode, which have the sample deposited on it, to required current density, and thereafter we switch off the current so that the potential relaxes to equilibrium value. The electrode is discharged afterwards to same current density, until the potential reaches the cut off value, and again current switched off at this point. During the charging process, the potential rises slowly and continuously. It stabilises at some potential value where evolution of hydrogen gas bubbles observed visually. The discharge potential depicts an accurate potential response at cut-off potential. However, it is very difficult to determine the point where hydrogen evolution starts and thus accurate measurement of charge capacity is difficult. Therefore, discharge capacity gives accurate result about the amount of hydrogen energy stored in the material [126]. Charge-discharge process done using three-electrode system in an electrolytic solution at room temperature. The working electrode charged to some specific capacity, held and discharged to cut off potential. Bordbar et al. reported electrode of MWCNT/TiO2–Co nanocomposite synthesized by electrophoretic deposition [123]. The hydrogen storage capacity were measured by charge-discharge capacity of MWCNT/TiO2–Co deposited on copper electrode at 133 mA/g of current density. Three different electrode that are CNT, CNT/TiO2 and MWCNT/TiO2–Co tested for their discharge capacity. MWCNT/TiO2–Co showed best discharge capacity of 187 mAhg−1. Thus, the authors concluded the significant role of cobalt in depicting good discharge capacity. Pure carbon nanotubes display less discharge capacity due to less hydrogen oxidation but TiO2 nanoparticles significantly improved the electrochemical activity and hence the discharge capacity. Further employing cobalt in this, improved the discharge capacity as it provided redox sites for hydrogen storage. An important criterion in the charge-discharge method is the stability observed with hydrogen storage. Thus, the cycles repeated until discharge capacity of the electrode is reached to highest point and thereafter it remains stable. Hence, galvanostatic charge-discharge method provides a better method to determine hydrogen storage capacity. Gholami et al. synthesized CuO/Al2O3 nanocomposite and found that this sample exhibited magnificent electrochemical hydrogen storage of 6750 mA h/g [124]. Simple chemical methods was employed for their synthesis that is nitrate salts of both copper and aluminium taken in distilled water and then green tea extract added to it. Subsequently the solution was heated and calcined. Variation of copper and aluminium salts done to synthesize different samples gave different morphologies. Evaluation of electrochemical discharge capacities of samples were done. The capacity was good when the copper content was high, as compared to the aluminium content in the nanocomposite. An increment in discharge capacity was observed, when cycles were repeated. The increament was upto 6750 mA h/g from 330 mA h/g, which corresponded to 23.9 wt % of hydrogen content in the nanocomposite [124]."
22,"Cyclic voltammetric, chronoamperometric and linear voltammetric method","10.2 Cyclic voltammetric, chronoamperometric and linear voltammetric method The CV response of the materials is obtained at some particular scan rate in some fixed potential window range. Here, the cycles also repeated to get the accurate redox peaks. In one direction, we obtain highest reduction current, which tells the hydrogen evolution experimentally whereas when we reverse the scan, a peak in opposite direction is observed which is due to the electrochemical process related to oxidation of material. Thus, integration of these peaks gives us the amount of charge stored in the sample. Hence, the oxidation peak directly relates to the hydrogen storage capacity [124]. Initial study done in Aichen Chen group by Adam et al. [125], did synthesis of Pd-Cd nanostructure by varying the amount of cadmium. Different morphologies have been observed for hydrogen storage capacity of the prepared nanostructures. The nanostructures with cadmium content varying from 0 to 20% synthesized on Titanium substrate by hydrothermal reduction method. The various morphologies of these nanostructures were obtained. Hydrogen energy storage in these structure occur because hydrogen usually diffuses into palladium structure by jumping from one octahedral site to another and this effect is further increased on addition of Cd due to lattice constant dilation. Furthermore, the test of these nanomaterials for hydrogen adsorption and desorption was done through cyclic voltammetry studies. CV studies examined from -200 to 400 mV with 20 mV/s of scan rate. The total amount of hydrogen storage was evaluated, from total integrated area in anodic region. The hydrogen desorption charges was found to be maximum for cadmium in 10–15% range. When the content of Cd increased from 0 to 15%, there was decrease in the crystalline structure of the material but a good increament in BET surface area, which is a reflection of an augmentation in hydrogen sorption. Konda et al. did the electrochemical studies of core-shell nanostructures of Cadmium-Palladium to study their competence in field of hydrogen storage [126]. This synthesis was carried by varying the ratio of Cd: Pd, and these prepared samples deposited on glassy carbon electrode. Sulphuric acid solution was used as electrolyte in electrochemical studies. Chronoamperometry is done to saturate hydrogen on the film while linear voltammetry is carried out for desorption of hydrogen. TEM and XRD confirmed the structural analysis of nanomaterial whereas EDX and XPS confirmed the composition and chemical nature respectively of samples. Electrode potential scanning was done within range of -225 to 400 mV at 10 mV/s of scan rate. Electrochemical studies were done for Cd@Pd nanoparticles for presence of capping agents. Significant peak was observed at 130 mV while shoulder peak was observed from -100 mV to 0 mV for capped sample. While in case of uncapped samples hydrogen sorption/ desorption currents were reduced and hydrogen sorption peak was observed at -200 mV whereas wide desorption peak was obtained at -100 mV. Cd@Pd nanoparticles show integrated charges of 458 mC and 75 mC for capped and uncapped samples, respectively. In the similar way integrated charges were calculated for nanomaterials with different ratios of cadmium and palladium depicting the following order i.e. Pd: Cd (1:1) [79.8 mC] < Pd [135.0 mC] < Cd@Pd (1:3) [185.0 mC] < Cd@Pd (1:2) [458.0 mC]. Hence, from this analysis, it is confirmed that 1:2 ratio gave best hydrogen sorption results. Thus, the studies concluded that 340% increment in hydrogen storage was obtained, when Cd@Pd nanostructures were studied in comparison to pure Pd nanoparticles. Chen et al. functionalised the TiO2 nanotubes with Pd nanoparticles and studied their hydrogen storage properties [127]. TiO2 nanotubes are low cost and have good semiconducting properties due to which they exhibit fast electronic interaction. Self–assembling electrochemical anodization method was used to fabricate TiO2 NT/ Pd. SEM and XRD confirmed the shape and size of the synthesized samples. Herein, electrochemical studies carried in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. TiO2 NT/ Pd, TiO2/ Pd and Pd wire were scanned for electrochemical performance in potential range from -320 to 400 mV with 10 mV/s of sweep rate. For palladium wire desorption peak was observed at −68 mV, in case of TiO2/ Pd desorption peak was obtained at −145 mV and TiO2NT/ Pd depicts desorption peak at -170 mV."
23,Electronic impedance spectroscopy,"10.3 Electronic impedance spectroscopy The EIS measurements help to identify electrochemical process, which leads to galvanostatic or CV study. Major advantage of EIS is that, data gives us capacitive results and thus good information regarding electrostatic charge storage achieved by this method. The double layer capacitance determined by impedance measurement is same as double layer charging or discharging current calculated by cyclic voltammograms in same potential range. The double layer current (Idl) is same as the product of double layer capacitance (Cdl) and scan rate (v) in same potential range as that of cyclic voltammetry. (9) Idl(E) =Cdl (E). v So, this double layer process is directly related to the amount of charge stored [128]. EIS measurements are very effective tool to determine the interfacial properties of electrodes and measure the electron transfer at the electrode surface. Xiang et al. [129] did electrochemical EIS studies of ordered mesoporous carbon to evaluate the electron transfer characteristics at electrode surface. Calculation of charge transfer resistance of different electrodes done after modifying electrode with nickel. Resistance decreases from 12.14 Ω cm2 to 3.61 Ω cm2. Hence, it was concluded that metal nickel particles imparted them conductivity and thus better electrochemical hydrogen storage properties. Different metal alloys and graphene evaluated for hydrogen storage capacity by EIS measurements. The work carried by Li and his group is very significant whereby they evaluated the high rate discharge ability of the hybrid assembly electrode prepared of hydrogen storage alloy and reduced graphite oxide [130]. Hydrogen diffusivity was evaluated easily by impedance measurements. Two measurements were done, one of simple alloy and the other of hybrid electrode. For both electrodes, semicircles were obtained in zone of high frequency followed by straight line at low frequency. Small circle is due to contact resistance whereas the large circle is due to charge transfer resistance. Warburg impedance reflected via a straight line. Since, the high rate discharge ability is directly dependent on charge transfer characteristics. Hydrogen atom diffusivity of the electrodes were also evaluated and one for Hydrogen Storage Alloys/rGO composite electrode (DH = 1.81 × 10−10 cm2 s-1) is greater than alloy electrode (DH = 1.15 × 10−10 cm2 s-1)."
24,Electrochemical hydrogen storage in different materials,"Various types of materials like metal alloys, metal oxides, hydroxides, carbon, chalcogenides can be used to store hydrogen electrochemically. Details of hydrogen storage capacity of different materials is illustrated in Table 1 ."
25,Alloys,"11.1 Alloys Hydrogen incorporated into alloys and the ability of an alloy to store hydrogen is based on the crystal structure of alloy. The connectivity between hydrogen and metal atom at interstitial site is mainly responsible for the hydrogen storage. In metal hydride batteries, hydrogen storage alloys chiefly work as negative electrode. Various types of metal alloys can be used for this purpose. Wang et al. [131]; carried out the studies for cobalt alloys with boron, phosphorus and silicon. These non-metal (B, P, and Si) alloys with cobalt improve electrochemical reversible hydrogen storage properties and are efficient catalyst for hydrolysis. Synthesis of alloys done by ball milling process. 385 mA h/g of capacity was obtained for Co-S sample having milling time of 10 h. The cyclic voltammetric behaviour of the compounds also studied by them and analysis of the anodic and cathodic peaks found. The cathodic peaks attribute to hydrogen adsorption on the Co-S electrode surface while anodic peaks were due to electrochemical oxidation of oxygen. Temperature programmed desorption experiment were carried out to study the hydrogen absorption-desorption property. Electrochemical hydrogen storage in alloys used since long time. Similarly, A2B type alloy is grabbing attention due to existence of significant interstitial sites for hydrogen storage. The work carried by Zhao and group suggested that the phase structure of alloy also plays dominant role in efficiency of hydrogen storage [132]. Ti2Ni alloy synthesized by induction melting method and further different characterisations carried out for this compound like SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS to confirm its formation. Furthermore, the electrode was prepared by pressing alloy and nickel powder under pressure of 15 MPa to convert it into a pellet and then the charge-discharge measurements were done to calculate amount of hydrogen storage. Alloy discharge capacity was studied at diverse temperature as function of cycle number. At 293 K stable capacity of 215 mA h−1 was obtained after three charge/ discharge cycles. Further, increasing temperature to 313 K, the discharge capacity increased up to 336 mA h−1, but when the number of cycles increased, a decrement in discharge capacity was observed. Hence, this signified a good hydrogen penetration in the alloy at increased temperature. The hydrogen storage capacity of crystalline phase of Ti2Ni alloy was more than the amorphous phase. They observed that mechanical milling decreased the hydrogen storage capacity of both crystalline and amorphous phase, which might be result of destructed storage sites while the mechanical milling is taking place. The nanocrystalline phase was useful for hydrogen storage whereas amorphous phase contributed towards kinetic enhancement of hydrogen absorption–desorption and heightening of resistance in corrosion. Thus, alloy is efficiently usable in Ni-MH batteries as it has good corrosion resistance and the crystalline phase showed good hydrogen discharge efficiency of 450 mA h g−1."
26,Nanoribbons,"11.2 Nanoribbons Researchers have worked to assemble out 1D structure at lower temperature, which would be capable of storing hydrogen. Hence, nanobelts and nanoribbons synthesized. Gao et al. worked towards synthesis of CuO nanoribbon array by dehydration route at low temperature [133]. The crystalline structure of the sample were determined using XRD technique. FESEM technique examined that products were primarily composed of ribbons, which are straight along axis of direction. The bundle like morphology of the sample was observed. Surface area of 158.2 m2/g was obtained for nanoribbons and average pore size was 5.2 nm. Electrochemical studies revealed capacity of 503 mA h/g corresponding to hydrogen weight percentage of 1.84. The repeated charge–discharge cycles showed discharge capacity of 70 mA h/g thereby indicating ability of nanoribbon to have tough resistance against corrosion and oxidation. Thus, porous tubular structure of nanoribbons obtained which indicates potentially good electrochemical hydrogen storage properties."
27,Carbonaceous material,"11.3 Carbonaceous material The carbon materials can form CH bonds with hydrogen thereby making the hydrogen storage quite feasible in these materials. Thus, different type of carbon materials like carbon nanotubes, carbon dots, carbon nanofibers, graphene, graphitic carbon nitride etc., can have feasible hydrogen storage [134]. 11.3.1 Carbon nano-onions Carbon nano-onions have become important in various applications since their discovery by Ugarte in 1992 [135]. These are virtually spherical nested fullerenes, having multiple graphitic layers surrounded by bucky layer [136]. Carbon nano-onions behave as energy storage electrodes as they have hollow inner cavity, layered graphitic structure having absence of dangling bonds on their surface [137]. These materials have good electrical conductivity, small charging time and large power density. The hollow structure, spherical shape, specific surface area and nanosized renders them as potential material for applications in Li-ion battery, supercapacitor, drug delivery and field effect transistors, etc. [138]. Various methods for the synthesis of carbon nano-onions are like CVD, template method or chemical routes, etc. [139]. Zhang et al has synthesized carbon nano-onions and used this material for hydrogen storage [140]. The sample obtained has good onion like structures. These materials visualized as good electrochemical hydrogen storage material as they have unique spheroidal, void and graphitic structure. Here, they used CVD method to synthesize carbon nano-onions whereby Fe-Ni alloy particles were employed as catalyst. The working electrode for this was prepared by mixing carbon nano-onions and copper powder pressed on nickel foam matrix. This working electrode was alternately charged/ discharged at 500 mA/g for 0.5 h. The core-shell structure of these nano-onions was observed by SEM images. The maximum obtained discharge capacity of CNOs was 481.6 mA h/g, which is 1.76%. Further, the confirmation of hydrogen adsorption-oxidation behaviour was confirmed by cyclic-voltammetry method. A high peak was observed in anodic direction, which indicate its good electrochemical activity and hydrogen storage behaviour. High rate of electrochemical hydrogen storage behaviour is possible because of defective openings and adsorption of hydrogen onto dangling graphitic edges. Further, same group studied addition of Ni, Fe and Fe-Ni alloy metal catalyst on carbon nano-onions in 2014 for electrochemical hydrogen storage properties [141]. Carbon nano-onions were synthesized by disintegration of methane catalytically at 850 °C that is Ni@CNOs, Fe3C@CNOs and Fe0.64Ni0.36@CNOs. Hydrogen storage capacity for Ni@CNOs was maximum that is 387.2 mA h/g corresponding to 1.42% of hydrogen storage. The electrochemical measurements for these materials improved by immersing the solution overnight in an electrolyte. Moreover, increase in number of cycles improve the discharge capacity, as this will make more ions to penetrate into the electrolyte. The good increment in the hydrogen storage property of this material is because of large amount of defects present, which provide good site for adsorption of atomic as well as molecular hydrogen because of increment in surface area. 11.3.2 Carbon nanofibers Carbon nanofibers have special place in carbon materials because they possess high surface to volume ratio, greater chemical and physical properties, making them reliable choice in different fields like textiles, engineering, medical and defence [142]. The nanofibers have porous structure, which enable them to be used efficiently in energy storage applications. Mesoporous carbon nanofibers synthesized by Xing et al. [143] and electrochemical evaluation of their hydrogen storage was done. These were prepared using nano-casting technique. Different characterisations confirmed high surface area and mesoporous structure. SEM images obtained show open mesoporous of 10–20 nm. High surface area of 915 m2 was found from BET surface area analysis. The electrochemical hydrogen storage studies of these fibres were done at 25 mAg−1 and 3000 mAg−1 in alkaline solution. The discharge capacity was 679 and 585 mA h g−1 at discharge capacity of 25 mAg−1 and 3000 mAg−1 respectively. Since electrochemical stability is essential in rechargeable electrode materials, disparity of specific discharge capacity at 25 mAg−1 was monitored by cycle number. An excellent cyclic stability and capacity retention of 646 mA h g-1 was obtained after 100 consecutive charge-discharge cycles. 11.3.3 Graphene Graphene is a material with large surface area and excellent chemical durability, which renders it as an important hydrogen storage material. Good electrochemical activity of graphene renders it an effictive metal-free catalyst support for fuel cell. Graphene possess extraordinary physicochemical properties like good thermal conductivity, high carrier mobility and elasticity [144]. The structure of graphene is sp2 hybridized, covalent bonded honeycomb arrangement, which helps in efficient binding with hydrogen atoms. Graphene has a unique flexible arrangement, which allows easy integration of hydrogen module. Hydrogen easily adsorbed on graphene by both physio-sorption and chemisorption. Even functionalization and doping of graphene improves its hydrogen storage capacity. This increment is due to hydrogen spill over phenomenon where dissociation of hydrogen molecules occurs on surface of metal or metal-oxide and after that transferred over the graphene surface where easy adsorption occurs. Guo et al. carried out the studies of graphene sheets synthesized by electric discharge method [145], in which cylindrical graphitic rods were carbon source. Electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity was observed to be 147.8 mA h/g. Graphene prepared at different pressures were characterised by XRD, TEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge studies done on CH1660C and CT2001A battery system, respectively. The wrinkled structured graphene sheets improved the electrochemical surface area. The hydrogen atmosphere provided during the synthesis condition play dominant role in morphology and microstructure of graphene sheet. As the hydrogen pressure increases, the interlayer spacing also increases which in turn provides subways for insertion/desertion of hydrogen ions. The interaction of graphene structure with hydrogen done by both chemo-sorption and physio-sorption. However, physio-sorption presents faster kinetics but it has small binding energy in comparison to chemisorption. The gravimetric hydrogen storage for graphene was 8.3% theoretically, which was higher than the DOE targets. [146].Various methods are used to synthesize graphene and their modifications by functionalization, decoration and doping, etc. used to improve their hydrogen storage properties [147]. The decoration of graphene structure with transition metal/metal oxides gives excellent hydrogen adsorption. Honarpazhouh and co-workers decorated the porous silicon/graphene oxide with palladium particles and evaluated its capability for hydrogen storage [105]. Palladium metal as studied by various researchers significantly improves storage capacity [148]. Thus, coating porous silicon, graphene with palladium improves cycle lifetime and discharge rate of electrode. SEM confirms the porous morphology of the synthesized samples. Raman spectroscopy and XRD also confirm structure of samples. Various electrochemical experiments like cyclic voltammetry, EIS and charge-discharge were performed to determine electrochemical hydrogen storage capability. Cyclic voltammetry studies were done for Si, PS, Pd/PS and GO-Pd/PS/Si electrodes and it was found that the sharpest peaks were observed in negative current for GO-Pd/PS/Si electrodes, thus depicting good hydrogen storage capability. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements at 500 mAg−1 were measured. The highest discharge capacity was 546.1 mA h g−1 whereby Pd cluster is considered to be main reason for active sites for hydrogen storage. The cycle life performance displayed fast decay initially, but later it became constant. Palladium acts as good hydrogen storage catalyser. The EIS curves for the different samples depicted semicircle at high frequency though beeline was witnessed at low frequency. It was found that the electrical double layer capacitance was highest for GO-Pd/PS electrode, which is corresponding with cyclic voltammetry studies and discharge capacity data. 11.3.4 Carbon nanotubes Carbon nanotubes are widely used since their discovery. Applications of CNTs varies from energy storage, biomedical, displays, optoelectronics etc. due to their magnificent electronic, mechanical and physical properties. Hydrogen storage can be done by CNTs through electrochemical methods. Porous structure of CNTs proves to be quite beneficial in achieving better hydrogen storage properties [149]. The hydrogen storage in the CNTs occurs primarily because of hydrogen molecules sorption in the pores of CNTs, due to chemisorption of carbon impurities in the sample. Even treatment by acid and modification of surface of carbon nanotubes improve their hydrogen sorption properties. Reyhani et al. studied influence of acid on properties of carbon nanotubes [150]. The influence of HNO3, H2SO4, HF and HCl on CNT was studied. The surface area of CNT treated with HF was largest. Purified MWCNTs were studied by cyclic voltammetric measurements in 6 M NaOH solution. Polarisation began with scanning at different rates viz 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mVs−1 from -1.5 to 0.5 V. The sweep rates of MWCNTs from 20 to 50 mVs-1 was studied in order to observe oxidation and reduction potentials. HF acid treated MWCNTs had highest redox peak currents compared to other electrodes. Moreover, on increasing the sweep rate, increment in peak current intensity is observed. Further, discharge behaviour of these nanotubes were studied. This discharge behaviour was quite similar to the BET surface area behaviour, showing ascending trend from HCl, HNO3, H2SO4 and HF as 391, 415, 347 and 496 mA h g−1 respectively. This depicted a direct relation between pore size and discharge capacity. Mohammadi et al. studied the electrochemical hydrogen sorption in Ni-CNT porous electrode [151]. Their charge-discharge behaviour at different current densities were observed to determine hydrogen storage behaviour. Effect of annealing and doping with nickel nanoparticles was done for study of hydrogen storage behaviour. Here, nickel foam of nano-porosities were used as mattress for CNT. Further, by using electroplating method, nickel nanoparticles were deposited on CNT. 6 M KOH was employed as electrolyte. Following equation depicts charge/discharge equation whereby charging takes place when hydrogen ions were inserted into CNTs whereas discharging occurs when the hydrogen ions were released. (10) C N T + x H 2 O + x e - ↔ C N T + x H + x O H - The curve becomes flat on completion as voltage difference between working and reference electrode and is reduced to zero with passage of time. The hydrogen storage capability of the electrode is directly proportional to the discharge capacity. (Weight of CNT gm−1) X current (mA) X 1 h 3600 s X charging/ discharging time (s) The annealing of CNT samples were done at 350 °C and influence of changing currents was investigated on discharge capacity (Figure 36). The discharge capacity increased greatly after annealing. Nickel doping by electroplating done to observe hydrogen storage. It is illustrated by the following equation. (11) Ni + xH2O + Xe− ↔ Ni •xHads + xOH- (12) Ni•xHads + CNT↔ CNT•xHads + Ni Hydrogen storage was greatly improved by combined effect of carbon nanotubes and nickel as nickel catalyst has efficient electrochemical activity whereas CNTs play role of receptor, providing effective sites for hydrogen storage. An extraordinary discharge capacity of 3520 mA h /g was observed for Ni-CNTs for current of 2 mA during 7 cycles, which was reported to be one of the best hydrogen storage capacity."
28,Microspheres,"Various new materials are emerging in the field of energy storage devices. One such being microspheres, which are spherical particles having diameter in the range 1 μm–1000 μm and manufactured by both natural and artificial sources [152]. These are widely used in pharmaceutical and biological industries. The work carried by Cao et al., suggest that microspheres can be used for hydrogen storage [153]. Three-dimensional Fe3S4 flower resembling microspheres were produced by biomechanical assisted solution approach. The characterisation of these microspheres were done by XRD, SEM, TEM and thereafter, electrical, magnetic and electrochemical studies of electrodes were done. The electrodes were alternatively charged and discharged at 60 mA h−1 and 30 mA h−1, respectively. The flower like morphology is as illustrated in figure obtained from SEM data. Layered sulphide nanomaterial were explored as hydrogen storage materials, which gives good discharge capacity. The plateau of discharge potential is observed at 1.09 V (cell potential) and capacity of 214 mA h g-1 is achieved. Hence, these results confirm that Fe3S4 has potential applications in hydrogen storage [153]."
29,Spinals,"12.1 Spinals Spinals are basically a group of mixed metal oxides which have common formula of A2+B2 3+O4 2−, crystallising in cubic phase. Compounds of this group have recently become quite popular material for hydrogen storage. Work carried out by Salavati-Naisari and group in the field of using Spinels for electrochemical hydrogen storage constituents is immense. The group carried out the synthesis of BaAl2O4 and performed theoretical and electrochemical hydrogen storage studies [154]. Synthesis of BaAl2O4 was done by solution-combustion method. Different types of characterisations SEM, TEM confirmed the morphology. While the deposition of material was done on copper foam and using this as a working electrode, electrochemical discharge capacities were measured. Theoretical calculation were performed by Gaussian 09 software package. Good spherical nanoparticles of uniform 30–40 nm size were obtained. Cyclic voltammogram of BaAl2O4 nanoparticles was carried with application of potential between working and reference electrode, and assessing current between working and counter electrode. The BaAl2O4 nanoparticle absorb the hydrogen which is generated from the aqueous KOH electrolyte. The basic mechanism of the reaction is as shown below BaAl2O4 + x H 2 O + xe− ↔ BaAl2O4- Hx (g) + xOH− The discharging capacity of the electrode is measured to be 800 mA h/g after 15 cycles. Synthesis of BaAl2O4/BaCO3 modified by CuPc organic dye was also done by same group and here discharge capacity of more than 1500 mA h/g was achieved. Again synthesis was done by combustion method. Spherical nanoparticles were achieved here as well. Two set of nanoparticles were used for study, one being BaAl2O4/BaCO3 and other was BaAl2O4/BaCO3 modified by CuPc. The discharge capacity of two samples was 900 mA h/g (3.2%) and 1500 mA h/g (5.3%) respectively after 15 cycles [155]. Tahereh Gholami from the same group carried out the study of cobalt aluminate spinal (CoAl2O4) spinal. Here the synthesis of the spinal was done by green chemistry approach by thermal decomposition reaction utilising the green tree extract [156]. Here the cobalt aluminate spinal was deposited on nickel foam electrode, behaving as working electrode for carrying electrochemical studies. Alkaline KOH solution was employed as electrolyte. So for chronopotentiometry studies carried out, they observed that during charging process, dissociation of electrolyte occurs around working electrode and migration of hydrogen occurs towards cathode and is absorbed by CoAl2O4. In discharging process, cathode removes hydrogen atoms. Here, discharge capacity in first cycle was observed to be 460 mA h/g, but with increament of cycles, discharge capacity increased to 900 mA h/g for third cycle, where as it was 1100 mA h/g over 20 cycles. They observed that this increment in the hydrogen storage capacity might be ascribed to occurrence of adsorption spots on working electrode. Also Nickel based spinals favour considerable hydrogen storage when nanocomposites of NiAl2O4/NiO were prepared [157]. Nickel aluminate spinal were prepared by low cost auto-combustion method utilising green tea extract. Chronopotentiometry studies were done of NiAl2O4/NiO nanostructure and its nanocomposite with SiO2, graphene and TiO2 which were calculated as 850, 2000, 2750, 3000 mA h/g, respectively. In these nanocomposites, influence of pore size considerably effects the hydrogen storage capacity. Smaller pore size has more hydrogen storage capacity because they have more interaction with hydrogen molecule. Even zinc based spinals were also considerably studied by the same group like the zinc aluminate [158], zinc germinate [159] and zinc stannate [160]. Amongst them it was found that the maximum capacity was favoured by zinc stannate which is 4650 mA h/g. A recent study by the same group were also done to synthesize simple ultrasonication based cadmium spinal that is cadmium silicate /graphene based nanocomposite [161]. This novel nanocomposite exhibited high electrochemical hydrogen storage capability of 3300 mA h/g after 25 cycles. Even a strong influence of graphene is illustrated as spinal CdSiO4 has discharge capacity of 1300 mA h/g while the CdSiO4 /Graphene nanocomposite has approx three times more discharge capacity that is 3300 mA h/g."
30,Hydrogen fuel cell,"Fuel cell is well-known electrochemical device, whereby transformation of chemical energy to electrical energy takes place by utilizing hydrogen and oxygen as a fuel. They are utilized in varies applications stretching from simple battery charging to complex space applications. Fuel cell comprise of anode, cathode and electrolyte. Oxidation of fuel takes place at anode, which releases protons and electrons. These protons and electrons transfer towards cathode via the electrolyte through external circuit respectively. Depending on type of electrolyte, fuel cells are of various types like proton exchange membrane, alkaline, solid oxide, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate and various others [162]. Fuel commonly used in fuel cells is hydrogen as it is environment friendly but other fuels like glucose and carbon employed as fuel in it [163]. The first ever reference to hydrogen fuel cell occurred in 1838, when Welsh and William Grove wrote about their first crude fuel cells development in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science [164]. Combining sheet of copper, iron, porcelain dishes and sulphate solution of copper and dilute acid for initial usage. Further, development in fuel cell was witnessed with the work of British engineer Francis Thomas Bacon in 1839, who fruitfully developed 5 kW stationary fuel cell [165]. Since then there were various developments in fuel cell. Later in 1969, the fuel cells were utilized in NASA space programmes. Fuel cells were used in vehicles and power plants also. In order to recognize multipurpose and variant roles of hydrogen and fuel cells, the US Senate acknowledged October 8, 2015 as National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day [166]. In future hydrogen fuel cells can possibly replace the use of petroleum in vehicles. There are various other reasons, which make hydrogen fuel cells reliable. They are: 1 Clean and highly efficient. 2 Renewable and do not require charging. 3 Fuel made from water, which is abundant in nature. 4 Runs easily in reverse for energy storage producing hydrogen from electricity and water."
31,Electrochemical principal involved in fuel cell,"13.1 Electrochemical principal involved in fuel cell Chief electrochemical principal involved in working of fuel cell is producing electricity by transformation of hydrogen and oxygen fuel into water. Here, the hydrogen atoms enter the fuel cell from the anode and the electron is ejected out of them. This electron is the current provider, which travels through wires [167]. Oxygen enters fuel cell at cathode and combines with hydrogen ion and electron that has travelled through the electrolyte. Together oxygen and hydrogen helps in the production of electricity."
32,Types of hydrogen fuel cell,"Types of fuel cells depend on fuel, they use like hydrogen, methane, alcohol, biomass etc. Here, we will be focussing on fuel cells utilizing hydrogen as the fuel."
33,Proton exchange membrane fuel cell,"14.1 Proton exchange membrane fuel cell This fuel cell is commonly used in both mobile and stationary applications as it has compact structure, great energy density, high-energy conversion efficiency, quick refill and start-up time [168]. Here, chemical energy is converted into electrical energy via electrochemical reaction. Proton conducting polymer membrane works as solid electrolyte thus preventing corrosion in cell. PEM fuel cells have high efficiency and power density but still there are challenges like high cost and insufficient durability, which makes them unreliable. Electro-catalysts are used in these reactions to promote cathode oxidation-reduction reaction and anode hydrogen-oxidation reaction."
34,Phosphoric acid fuel cell,"14.2 Phosphoric acid fuel cell Here, orthophosphoric acid is used as an electrolyte bonded in matrix of silicon carbide. This was first fuel cell to be commercialised and is the most well established fuel cell because of its high reliability and low cost [169]. It is quite reliable for stationary applications and are resistant to carbon mono-oxide poisoning. However, the electrical efficiency of these cells was found to be low, but it can be improved by heating."
35,Alkaline fuel cell,"14.3 Alkaline fuel cell Alkaline fuel cell use alkaline solution like potassium hydroxide as electrolyte. They operate in low temperature range of 50–90 °C [170]. These fuel cells provide sustainable energy at low cost and high power density. Alkaline fuel cells have an upper hand over rest of the cells, as improved kinetics of complex reactions is observed in alkaline medium [171]."
36,Others,"14.4 Others Apart from above fuel cells, there are others which use methane, methanol etc. as a fuel. These fuel cells are direct methanol, molten carbonate, direct carbon, solid oxide, microbial and others. These are hot topics of research because of their clean and efficient energy output. These fuel cells combine finest features of batteries and engines; as operate under load conditions similar to battery. The operation could be carried out continuously until fuel is available to them without any intermediate conversions [162]."
37,Applications of fuel cell,"Fuel cells are star technology using hydrogen economy. Fuel cells find applications in both stationary as well as portable sector as illustrated in (Fig. 4 ). The applications can be for power generation in devices and as fuel in transportation [172]. Green experts view that there is necessity of fuel cell vehicles in future in order to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. The main issue faced by fuel cell industry is cost, which is limiting its usage."
38,Stationary applications,"15.1 Stationary applications The widely used fuel cells for stationary applications are polymer electrolytic membrane and phosphoric acid. Besides, economic issue faced in fuel cell applications, these systems were viewed to be reliable and durable by the researchers [172]. 15.1.1 Power generation system The stationary applications vary from small stationary power generation to large stationary power generation [173]. In small systems, the power outputs are from 0.1 and 10 kW in applications like electronic equipment, small-scale distributed electricity generation, uninterrupted power supplies and power supplies in remote areas. Whereas in the case of large power generation systems, output in power varies from 10 kW to several MW. 15.1.2 Combined system with renewable energy sources Hydrogen from other sources like solar and wind combine with fuel cell to form more efficient and smart energy source [174]. Integrated hydrogen renewable systems provide great source for electrical production. 15.1.3 Emergency backup power supply Frequent cuts in the power supply can be cause of great loses in plants and industries. Thus to generate a reliable uninterrupted power supply is the prime requirement in different operations [175]. Fuel cells help in sensitive setups like telecommunication and data centres where continuous power supply is the prime need else huge data losses may occur if fluctuations or power cuts occur frequently. 15.1.4 Distributed CHP supply Combined heat and power (CHP) or cogeneration supply is concentrated to generate thermal and power energy from single fuel cell source in an efficient, clean and reliable method [176]. This CHP system help to improve efficiency and decrease energy cost. These CHP systems can be either grid-independent or gird assisted. Both the systems require thermal storage to be effective. The grid-independent systems are complicated and high cost systems, as they have to meet dynamic load fluctuation. Whereas grid-assisted system import electricity during peak load demands and exports during low load demands [162]."
39,Mobile applications,"15.2 Mobile applications Mobile or portable fuel cells allows user to have experience of wireless power supply. These fuel cells are highly reliable in places where there is unavailability of grid power. These fuel cells continue to supply power as long as charged. The main applications of mobile or portable fuel cells are: 15.2.1 Transport applications Nowadays PEM fuel cells are widely used for transportation. They provide good start-up and high power density at operating temperature of 70 °C. Most of the space applications rely on solar panels and batteries for the fuel, but recent interest of scientists to use fuel cells in satellites and space vehicles was observed, in order to save mass and provide high power output. Many of the companies like Mercedes and Honda plan to use fuel cells as a fuel in their automobiles by the end of this decade [177]. 15.2.2 Auxiliary power units These units provide functions other than propulsion in a vehicle. These units provided power supply in form of electricity to the vehicles and help to run the accessories even when the engines shut down. 15.2.3 Electronic devices Various portable electronic devices employ hydrogen fuel cells as they are better than conventional batteries because they can be instantly recharged and have longer cell lifetime [178]. These fuel cells are employed in mobile phones, laptops, and other electronic devices to provide good backup abilities. Now, more industries are working to make fuel cells more compact in size and improve their efficiency."
40,Risks involved in hydrogen storage,"The effective storage of hydrogen is quite a challenge faced in hydrogen economy. Safety is the prerequisite while dealing with hydrogen storage technologies. The recent research focuses on developing novel material for efficient hydrogen storage. There are calculated risks involved with storing hydrogen in liquefied or compressed form. Storing hydrogen in pressurised gas tanks is quite bulky and difficult to integrate. Storing hydrogen by liquefying involves huge cost. Thus, solid-state hydrogen storage is much safer and efficient [179]. The risk involved with hydrogen storage is because of its low ignition temperature, which makes it highly flammable. Also because of its good buoyancy, it disperses with great speed in open space. The additional risks involved due to hydrogen increases manifold as hydrogen burns with colourless flame due to which it is difficult to be detected and hydrogen self-heats when it is leaked from high-pressure source [180]."
41,Conclusion,"Energy storage and particularly hydrogen storage has been the centre of attention of leading researchers, industrialists and scientists. Various efforts have been taken to store hydrogen and new concepts for the preservation of the same are still emerging. Different types of materials like alloys, metal organic frameworks, nanotubes, carbon based materials like graphene, nanoribbons, nanofibers, different porous materials are used efficiently for the hydrogen storage. In this review, we focussed our attention towards the renewable energy source that is hydrogen after discussing briefly about various other non-renewable and renewable energy sources. Procurement of hydrogen can be done by different sources like biomass, water, etc. and used in different application like electricity, transportation, power supply, electronics, etc. To use hydrogen economy fruitfully, storage of hydrogen is necessary. Hydrogen storage can be done physically, chemically and electrochemically. Different methods and materials to store hydrogen storage electrochemically were studied. A detailed discussion on various types of fuel cells was carried out. Hydrogen in combination with oxygen help to generate electricity in fuel cell where water is only by product, which is reusable to produce hydrogen again. Though there are many advantages of hydrogen technology, it is clean and renewable energy source but the few shortcomings also rest with the hydrogen economy popularisation. Thus, proper and reliable method of hydrogen storage should be looked."
