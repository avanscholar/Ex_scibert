0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels (i.e., petroleum, natural gas and coal), which meet most of the world's energy demand today, are being depleted fast. Also, their combustion products are causing the global problems. Many engineers and scientists agree that the solution to these global problems would be to replace the existing fossil system by the hydrogen energy system [1]. Hydrogen is the simplest element known to man. It is also the most plentiful gas in the universe. Hydrogen gas is lighter than air and, as a result, it rises in the atmosphere. This is why hydrogen as a gas (H2) is not found by itself on earth. It is found only in compound form with other elements. Hydrogen combined with carbon, forms different compounds such as methane (CH4), coal, and petroleum. Hydrogen is also found in all growing things—biomass [2]. The amount of energy produced during hydrogen combustion is higher than released by any other fuel on a mass basis, with a lower heating value (LHV) 2.4, 2.8 and 4 times higher than that of methane, gasoline and coal, respectively. Currently, the annual production of H2 is about 0.1 Gtonnes, of which 98% comes from the reforming of fossil fuels (e.g., [3]). Hydrogen is not an energy source, but a carrier, while it can be produced from not only fossil fuels, but also biomass and water. Biomass is the fourth largest source of energy in the world, accounting for about 15% of the world's primary energy consumption and about 38% of the primary energy consumption in the developing countries [4]. Biomass has the potential to accelerate the realization of hydrogen as a major fuel of the future. Since biomass is renewable and consumes atmospheric CO2 during growth, it can have a small net CO2 impact compared to fossil fuels. However, hydrogen from biomass has major challenges. There are no completed technology demonstrations. The yield of hydrogen is low from biomass since the hydrogen content in biomass is low to begin with (approximately 6% versus 25% for methane) and the energy content is low due to the 40% oxygen content of biomass. Since over half of the hydrogen from biomass comes from splitting water in a steam reforming reaction, the energy content of the feedstock is an inherent limitation of the process [5]. There are two main routes for biomass-based hydrogen production, namely thermo-chemical and bio-chemical. Thermo-chemical routes have three subheadings as pyrolysis, gasification, and SCWG. Pyrolysis means that biomass is heated absence of air. It can be taken bio-oil, char and tar after pyrolysis processes. The conventional gasification is used as an old technology, in which biomass is heated at high temperatures and disengage to combustible gas. Air, steam or oxygen can be used as a gasification agent to increase energy value. There are many studies using this kind of gasification method in the literature. Here a brief summary is provided: Consideration of hydrogen from carbonaceous materials has a long history in the “hydrogen” literature. At the First World Hydrogen Energy Conference, Tsaros et al. [6] reported on three routes to hydrogen production using sub-bituminous coal. Their ultimate goal was liquid fuels. McDonald et al. [7] proposed extracting protein from grass and lucern and using the residue for hydrogen production (among other fuels). Saha et al. [8] reported using a laboratory-scale fluidized bed autothermal gasifier to gasify carbonaceous materials in steam. Further studies with agricultural wastes were planned. Cocco and Costantinides [9] described the pyrolysis-gasification of biomass to hydrogen. A brief experimental effort was described to demonstrate that the pilot-scale research on hydrogen production by catalytic coal gasification could be extended to wood. The results showed that the coal technology was fully transferable to wood, subject to minor substitutions in feeding and solids handling components. Continuing work relating coal and biomass gasification, gasification mechanisms, and plant operator costs were given by Hauserman [10]. Timpe et al. [11] continued studies at the bench and pilot-scale of wood and coal. Catalyst screening showed that potassium-rich minerals and wood-ash provided the best rate enhancement. They produced hydrogen gas about 50% by mole at a temperature between 700 and 800°C and a pressure of 1atm. Cox et al. [12] presented a new approach to thermo-chemical gasification of biomass to hydrogen. The process was based on catalytic steam gasification of biomass with concurrent separation of hydrogen in a membrane reactor that employed a permselective membrane to separate the hydrogen as it was produced. The process was particularly well suited for wet biomass and conducted at the temperatures as low as 300°C. Most works were performed at a range of 103.41–206.82kPa. Optimal gasification conditions were found to be about 500°C, atmospheric pressure and a steam/biomass ratio equal to 10/1. In the presence of a nickel catalyst, hydrogen at 65% (volume) was produced under these conditions. Caglar and Demirbas [13] used pyrolysis of tea waste to produce hydrogen. The third method of thermo-chemical routes is SCWG where water is miscible with organic substance above the critical point. This method is preferred especially for high moisture biomass. One of the key works was on supercritical gasification of wood by Modell et al. [14] and a patent was issued to their work in 1978. They reported the effect of temperature and concentration on the gasification of glucose and maple sawdust in water in the vicinity of its critical state (374°C and 22MPa). No solid residue or char was produced. Hydrogen gaseous concentrations up to 18% were observed. Biological conversion methods include fermentative hydrogen production, photosynthesis, biological water gas shift reactions. Fermentative hydrogen can be produced using anaerobic organisms and/or photo fermentation. Also, many phototropic organisms can produce hydrogen with the aid of solar energy which is called photosynthesis conversion. Furthermore, some bacteria may easily perform water gas shift reactions. Berberoglu et al. [15] reported a factor 5.5 increase in hydrogen production by Anabaena variables ATCC 29413 using Allen–Arnon medium compared with BG-11 and BG-110 media. The results were obtained with a flat panel photobioreactor made of acrylic and operated in two stages at 30°C. In regards to the importance of energy, it is well-known that energy is now a key element in the interactions between nature and society and is considered a key input for economic development and sustainable development. Energy use is very much governed by thermodynamic principles and, therefore, an understanding of thermodynamic aspects of energy can help us understand pathways to sustainable development. The impact of energy resource utilization on the environment and the achievement of increased resource-utilization efficiency are best addressed by considering exergy. The exergy of an energy form or a substance is a measure of its usefulness or quality or potential to cause change and provide the basis for an effective measure of the potential of a substance or energy form to impact the environment. Consideration of the entire life cycle for energy resources and technologies suggests that improved efficiency reduces environmental impact during most stages of the life cycle [16]. So, renewable sources as biomass should be investigated with above mentioned methods to be more competitors. The main objectives of the present study are: (i) to review the studies conducted on the hydrogen production from various biomass systems (ii) to classify biomass-based hydrogen production technologies for practical hydrogen production (iii) to present a thermodynamic model for exergy-based calculations including numerous key parameters, such as fuel depletion ratio, relative irreversibility, productivity lack, exergetic factor, and improvement potential as well as energy and exergy eficiencies, and (iv) to parametrically study the effect of process parameters on the performance and hydrogen yield."
1,Background,"Here, various methods of biomass-based hydrogen production are reviewed and classified in terms of applications, including some experimental data on operating and performance. Many investigators from multi discipliner programs as mechanical, chemical, biological and environmental have studied on biomass-based hydrogen production. Some of them have focused on thermo-chemical methods, biological bacteria or increasing the efficiency of processes parameters or improving catalyst. All of these studies included hydrogen production by gasification of biomass, while some of them are summarized below. Koroneos et al. [17] presented the environmental feasibility and efficiency of producing hydrogen from biomass via two processes. Biomass gasification followed by reforming of the syngas was compared to gasification followed by electricity generation and electrolysis. The technical and environmental performance of such systems was examined using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Biomass-gasification-electricity-electrolysis route was found to give better environmental performance than the biomass-gasification-steam reforming-Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) route. It was assumed that the biomass-gasification-power plant produced all the electricity required for electrolysis and liquefaction steps without need of addition power source. Biomass-gasification-electricity-electrolysis route required 4.2TJ of primary energy input per TJ of hydrogen, while biomass-gasification-steam reforming required 2.4TJ per TJ hydrogen. But gasification-electricity-electrolysis route had 92.9% share of renewable energy in the primary energy input. The schematic diagrams are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . Lv et al. [18] conducted a pilot project about feasibility study of hydrogen production system using biomass residues. This study was based on a process of oxygen-rich air gasification of biomass in a downdraft gasifier plus CO-shift. The capacity of this system was 6.4t biomass/d. Applying this system, it was expected that an annual production of 480 billionNm3 H2 would be generated for domestic supply in China. The capital cost of the plant used in this study was 1328$/(Nm3/h) H2 out, and product supply cost was 0.15$/Nm3 H2. The cost sensitivity analysis on this system pointed that electricity and catalyst cost were the two most important factors to influence hydrogen production cost. Another study was presented by Karellas et al. [19] where an innovative all thermal gasification technology, the Biomass Heat Pipe Reformer (BioHPR), has been developed. The aim of their project was to integrate the technology of liquid metal heat pipes in the gasification process in order to produce a hydrogen-rich product gas from biomass or residues. The gasification product can be further used in microturbine or solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) systems. The aforementioned gasification technology along with its coupling with innovative combined heat and power (CHP) systems (with microturbine or fuel cells) was investigated, through the simulation of these systems, the optimum conditions of the integrated systems in order to reach the highest possible efficiencies. Mahishi and Goswami [20] investigated a novel technique that enhanced the hydrogen yield of conventional biomass steam gasification. This was done by integrating the gasification and absorption reactions. The method involved steam gasification of a carbonaceous fuel (biomass) in presence of a CO2 sorbent. Experiments were conducted by gasifying pine bark in presence of calcium oxide. The gasification was performed at atmospheric pressure ranging from 500 to 700°C. The hydrogen yield, total gas yield and carbon conversion efficiency increased by 48.6%, 62.2% and 83.5%, respectively, in the presence of sorbent at a gasification temperature of 600°C. This was attributed to the reforming of tars and hydrocarbons in the raw product gas in presence of calcium oxide. The CO and CH4 concentrations in the product gas were lower while using the sorbent. The calcium oxide played the dual role of sorbent and catalyst. Mahishi and Goswami [21] used a thermodynamic equilibrium model to predict the chemical composition of the products of biomass gasification (for wood). The effects of temperature, pressure, SBR and ER on the equilibrium hydrogen yield were studied using Stanjan (v 3.93L) software. Optimum conditions for hydrogen production were found to be 726.85°C, 3, 0.1 and 54% for the gasification temperature, SBR, ER and the efficiency, respectively. Fujimoto et al. [22] gasified woody biomass in steam at high temperature (649.85°C) and pressure (6.5MPa) in the presence of a CO2 sorbent using a batch reactor with 50cm3 capacity. The evolved CO2 was completely absorbed in the sorbent, and no CO2 was in the gas phase. Gas conversion ratio was 50% at 649.85°C. Wang et al. [23] studied on the effective and economic conversion of the low value and highly distributed solid biomass to a uniform gaseous mixture. Contemporary issues in the thermal gasification of biomass and its application to electricity and fuel production were presented. Steam was used as the gasifying agent with a product gas heating value of about 10–15MJ/Nm3, compared to the air gasification of biomass with 3–6MJ/Nm3. ER was found to be between 0.2 and 0.4. Lv et al. [24] utilized air and oxygen/steam. They found that the maximum lower heating value of fuel gas was 11.11MJ/Nm3 and the maximum hydrogen yield reached 45.16gH2/kg biomass. For biomass oxygen/steam gasification, the content of H2 and CO was obtained to be 63.27–72.56%, while the content was 52.19–63.31% for biomass air gasification. The ratio of H2/CO for biomass oxygen/steam gasification reached 0.7–0.9, which was lower than that of biomass air gasification with 1.06–1.27. Ba-Shammakh and Elkamel [25] designed and examined a biomass-gasification plant for hydrogen production using Aspen Plus for simulating purposes. Selling cost of hydrogen for the base case was estimated to be $0.82/kg H2. The net CO2 emission was 0.28kg/kg H2 produced (this number was estimated by the burning of natural gas required in the process), comparing with using natural gas reforming to produce hydrogen with a net CO2 emission of 15kg/kg H2 produced. Hanaoka et al. [26] investigated effect of the reaction parameters, such as [Ca]/[C], reaction pressure and reaction temperature on H2 yield and conversion to gas in the steam gasification of woody biomass using CaO as a CO2 sorbent. At a [Ca]/[C] of 2, the maximum yield of H2 was obtained. H2 was found at a pressure as low as 0.6MPa. It was noteworthy that H2 could be obtained from woody biomass at a much lower pressure compared to other carbonaceous materials such as coal and heavy oil in steam gasification using a CO2 sorbent. H2 yield also increased with increasing the reaction temperature. Autothermal steam reforming of selected compounds of bio-oil was investigated using thermodynamic analysis by Vagia and Lemonidou [27]. The effect of pressure was negative, decreasing the hydrogen mole fraction at 2.026MPa about 23%, 24% and 27% for acetic acid, ethylene glycol and acetone, respectively. The ratio of O2/fuel under optimum conditions [T =626.85°C, S/F=6 (9 for acetone) and P =101.325kPa] was 0.33, 0.26, 0.62 for acetic acid, ethylene glycol and acetone, respectively. Nikoo and Mahinpey [28] developed a model for the gasification of biomass in an atmospheric fluidized bed gasifier using the Aspen Plus simulator. The simulation results for the product gas composition and carbon conversion efficiency versus temperature, ER, SBR and biomass average particle size were compared with the experimental results. Higher temperature improved the gasification process. It increased both the production of hydrogen and the carbon conversion efficiency. Carbon monoxide and methane showed decreasing trends with increasing the temperature. CO2 production and carbon conversion efficiency increased by increasing the ER. In their study, temperatures varied from 700 to 900°C. Biomass feed rate, air and steam rate were obtained to be 0.445–0.512kg/h, 0.5–0.7Nm3/h and 0–1.8kg/h, respectively. The production of a hydrogen-rich gas by air/steam and air gasification of olive oil waste was investigated by Gonzàlez et al. [29]. The study was carried out in a laboratory reactor at atmospheric pressure over a temperature range from 700 to 900°C using a steam/biomass ratio of 1.2 w/w. The influence of the catalysts ZnCI2 and dolomite was also studied at 800–900°C. The results obtained suggested that the operating conditions were optimized at 900°C in steam gasification (a hydrogen molar fraction of 0.70 was obtained at a residence time of 7min). The use of both catalysts resulted positive at 800°C, especially in case of ZnCI2 (attaining a H2 molar fraction of 0.69 at a residence time of 5min). Shen et al. [30] proposed a novel process of hydrogen production from biomass gasification in interconnected fluidized beds. They reported that the favorable temperature of the gasifier should be between 750 and 800°C, the combustor temperature should be 920°C, while the ratio of steam/biomass should be between 0.6 and 0.7, as can be seen in Fig. 3 . The steam gasification of biomass, in the presence of a calcium oxide (CaO) sorbent for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, was investigated by Florin and Harris [31] as a promising pathway for renewable and sustainable production of hydrogen (H2). Maximum experimental H2 concentrations reported for the steam gasification of biomass, without CO2 capture, ranged between 40 and 50% vol, when CaO was used to remove CO2 from the product gas, it increased 40–80% vol (dry basis). Experimental results of slow, fast and catalytic pyrolysis of five lignocellulosic residues (corn cobs and corn salks, sunflower residues, olive kernels and olive tree prunings) were reported by Zabaniotou et al. [32]. Pyrolysis took place in two different reactor configurations: a captive sample wire mesh reactor for fast pyrolysis and a fixed bed reactor for non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis. Comparison of the experimental results showed that pyrolysis in the captive sample reactor produced more H2-rich gas than in the fixed bed reactor, while the fixed bed reactor configuration seemed to favor the production of liquid products. Maximum H2 production (%v/v) in the captive sample, fixed bed non-catalytic and fixed bed catalytic were 43-sunflower residues, 4.68- olive kernels and 7.87- sunflower residues, respectively. Maximum LHV (MJ/m3) of pyrolysis gas product in the captive sample, fixed bed non-catalytic and fixed bed catalytic were 13.74- corn stalk, 11.93- olive kernel and 10.18- corn cob, respectively. In another study conducted by Zabaniotou et al. [33], fast pyrolysis at high temperature and fixed bed air gasification of the rapeseed residues were studied. Thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic study were also carried out. Experiments of fast pyrolysis were performed in a temperature range of 480–790°C, with a heating rate of 48°C/s, under atmospheric pressure and helium atmosphere. The component with the highest yield in pyrolysis gas was carbon monoxide reaching 44.1% (v/v) at 620°C, while hydrogen reached 45.8% (v/v) at 790°C. H2 concentration increased with the increase in the temperature and reached a maximum of 28.77% (v/v) at 900°C in the gasification experiments. The LHV of the gaseous product was not really affected by the temperature increases. While LHV of fast pyrolysis was around 14MJ/m3, LHV of gasification was 10.13MJ/m3. Czernik et al. [34] proposed a two-step process that started with fast pyrolysis of biomass, which generated high yields of a liquid product, bio-oil, followed by catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil to produce hydrogen. In all tests the process temperature was kept at 850°C, with a molar steam to carbon ratio (S/C) of 5.8 and methane-equivalent space velocity of 920/h (It is defined as the ratio of the volumetric flow of reactants at standard conditions to the total catalyst volume and has units of inverse time Ref. [35]). The commercial catalyst C11-NK was also used. In the reported experiment, about 95% of bio-oil carbon was converted to gaseous compounds; however, at least part of the remaining 5% could be from deposits on the catalyst and cause its deactivation. In that test, 12.9g hydrogen was produced from 100g bio-oil (compared to the stoichiometric potential of 13.8g/100g bio-oil). Bimbela et al. [36] studied on the catalytic steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis liquids, known as bio-oil, which was separated into two fractions: ligninic and aqueous. Acetic acid was identified as one of the major organic acids and catalytic steam reforming was studied for this model compound. Three different Ni co-precipitated catalysts (23, 28 and 33% expressed as Ni/(Ni+Al)) were prepared. The effect of the nickel content of the catalyst was analyzed at 550 and 650°C. For the three catalysts tested (33, 28 and 23 relative at.% of nickel) the best performance with the highest H2 yield was obtained for the catalyst with 28% nickel content at both reaction temperatures. The production of hydrogen from the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil, generated from fast pyrolysis of biomass, was investigated by using novel metal-doped catalysts of [Ca24Al28O64]4+.4O−/M (CI2A7-O−/M, M=Mg, K, Ce) by Wang et al. [37]. It was found that the CI2A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst gave the highest yield of hydrogen and the best carbon conversion amount tested catalyst. Hydrogen yield as high as 80% was obtained, and maximum carbon conversion was up to 96% under the steam reforming condition (the ratio of mol steam to mol carbon fed (S/C)>4.0, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)=10,000/h, T =750°C). Another thermo-chemical method is gasification in supercritical water, which is a new technology, especially for high moisture biomass utilization. Some studies conduced are summarized below. Yong et al. [38] presented a study about potential of hydrogen from oil palm biomass as a source of renewable energy worldwide through gasification reaction in supercritical water. With a world oil palm biomass production annually of about 184.6 million tons, theoretical yield hydrogen production from it via this method was 2.16×1010 kgH2/year. Theoretical energy efficiencies of the gasification reaction were obtained to be about 72.91% and 46.54%, while maximum theoretical pure hydrogen production efficiency values were found to be 57.96% and 34.93% with and without heat recovery, respectively. Biomass feedstocks, including lignocellulosic materials and the tannery wastes, were gasified in supercritical water by Yanik et al. [39]. Gasification experiments were performed in a batch autoclave at 500°C. The amount of gases, the gas compositions and the amount of water soluble compounds from gasification were determined. The hydrogen yields ranging between 4.05 and 4.65molH2/kg biomass were obtained. The results showed that the yields and composition of gases depended also on the organic materials other than cellulose and lignin in lignocellulosic material. In addition to this, it was concluded that the kind of lignin may also have an effect on gasification products. Izumizaki et al. [40] dealt with a method of producing hydrogen from biomass and sewage disposals in supercritical water using ruthenium dioxide as a catalyst. Reaction temperature and pressure varied between 400 and 500°C, and 30 and 50MPa, respectively. High ratios of hydrogen up to 38.5% were produced from the sewage disposals. This value was even higher than the hydrogen production ratios from other biomass: 15% from cellulose, 14.1% from pulp, 16% from waste paper and 27% from paper sludge. The total reaction was exothermic whereas most of hydrogen forming reactions was endothermic. Since 1997, supercritical water gasification and biomass gasification have theoretically and experimentally been studied by Guo et al. [41]. A high energy conversion efficiency was achieved as the process avoids the drying step. A hydrogen-rich gas with low CO content could be generated in a single step process. The SCW process also suppressed the formation of tar and char formation. There were four types of catalysts, including activated carbon, metal, metal-oxide and alkali, used for SCW gasification in the literature. Operation conditions, temperature between 649.85 and 799.85°C, pressure between 17.5 and 30MPa and residence time from 9 to 46s were needed. A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis, including chemical equilibrium in the reactor, gas-liquid equilibrium in the high-pressure separator, exergy and energy analysis of the whole system, was conducted by Lu et al. [42]. Effects of pressure, temperature and water recycled ratio on gas-liquid equilibrium in high-pressure separation were discussed. The energy and exergy analysis results showed that energy and exergy efficiencies of the whole system were in excess of 40% and increased with increasing heat transfer efficiencies. Second pathway for hydrogen production by biomass is bio-chemical conversion. There are three methods, which mainly include fermentation, photosynthesis process and biological water gas shift reaction. Das and Veziroglu [43] reviewed the open literature on different biological hydrogen production processes, namely (i) biophotolysis of water using algae and cyanobacteria (ii) photodecomposition of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria (iii) fermentative hydrogen production from organic compounds and (iv) hybrid systems using photosynthetic and fermentative bacteria, and undertook a comparative analysis. Their study showed that most of the biological processes are operated at a temperature of 30–40°C and atmospheric pressure. Based on such data, it is apparent that fermentative hydrogen production is faster than that of the photosynthetic hydrogen production. Argun et al. [44] investigated hydrogen production by dark fermentation of wheat powder solution using heat treated anaerobic acidogenic sludge was investigated at different initial C/N and C/P ratios in order to determine the N and P requirements of the organisms for effective hydrogen production. The effects of C/N and C/P ratio on hydrogen yield and specific production rate were investigated in dark fermentation of wheat powder solution by external addition of N and P since the wheat powder was N and P deficient. A Box–Wilson statistical experiment design approach was used. C/N ratio was varied between 20 and 200 while C/P ratio was between 50 and 1000. Hydrogen yield increased with increasing C/N and C/P ratios. Low nitrogen concentrations required low phosphorous contents for high hydrogen yields. A C/N ratio of 200 and C/P ratio of 1000 yielded the highest H2 yield of 281mlH2/g starch at 25°C, 101.325kPa. Biological production of hydrogen from biomass by fermentative or photofermentative microorganisms was described through numerous research and review by Westermann et al. [45]. The major challenge of these techniques was the low yield from fermentative production and the large reactor volumes necessary for photofermentative production. Due to these constraints, biological hydrogen production from biomass had so far not been considered a significant source in most scenarios of a future hydrogen-based economy. It was suggested a combination of a biorefinary for the production of multiple fuels (hydrogen, ethanol and methane) and chemical catalytic technologies. Stewart and Hessami [46] examined the topic of photosynthetic reaction, which has long been known as a natural process, since it can produce useful by-products of biomass, oxygen and hydrogen. They listed a summary of biological organisms used to produce such a reaction. They also provided some designs and configurations of various bioreactor and light delivery systems. They pointed: (i) the range of energy requirements for these systems are between 10 and 50W/m2, (ii) the range of temperature requirements for the reactors is between 25 and 30°C and (iii) the apparatus volumetric capacity varied in volume from 0.0015m3 to 3dm3. Fig. 4 shows a conceptual design for a system that combines solar energy collection and a fiber optic light delivery system to stimulate biological organisms in a bio-generator to produce useful by-products from carbon dioxide and other species. Cyanobacteria or microalgae have been suggested to perform the role of photosynthesis. In order to promote uniform growth of the organisms, the distribution of photosynthetic photon flux light in the wavelength range from 400 to 700nm should be delivered to the bioreactor. Despite 50 years of development of closed system photobioreactor systems, commercial viability has not yet been achieved. Berberoglu et al. [15] studied on the effect of the nutrient media BG-11, BG-110 and Allen–Arnon on H2 production by Anabaena variables grown in a flat panel photobioreactor under otherwise similar conditions. They reported a factor 5.5 increase in hydrogen production by Anabaena variables ATCC 29413 using Allen–Arnon medium compared with BG-11 and BG-110 media. The results were obtained with a flat panel photobioreactor made of acrylic and operated in two stages at 30°C. Stage 1 aimed at converting carbon dioxide into biomass by photosynthesis while Stage 2 aimed at producing hydrogen. During stage 1, the photobioreactor was irradiated with 65μmol/m2/s (14W/m2) of light and sparged with a mixture of air (95% by volume) and carbon dioxide (5% by volume). During stage 2, irradiance was increased to 150μmol/m2/s (32W/m2) and the photobioreactor was sparged with pure argon. The maximum cyanobacteria concentrations during Stage 2 were 1.10 and 1.17kg drycell/m3 with BG-11 and Allen–Arnon media, respectively, while it could not exceed 0.76kg drycell/m3 with medium BG-110. The average specific hydrogen production rates were about 8.0×10−5 and 7.2×10−5 kg H2/kgdry cell/h (1 and 0.9LH2/kg drycell/h at 101.325kPa and 30°C) in media BG-11 and BG-110, respectively. In contrast, it was about 4.5×10−4 kgH2/kg drycell/h (5.6L H2/kg drycell/h at 101.325kPa and 30°C) in Allen–Arnon medium. As given in the open literature, the systems for hydrogen production from biomass are evaluated under two main groups, thermo-chemical and bio-chemical conversions. The thermo-chemical technologies are gasification, pyrolysis and SCW, while bio-chemical technologies are fermentation, photosynthesis process and biological water gas shift reaction. Thermo-chemical methods have been given in more detail in this study. Theoretical and experimental analysis as well as energy analysis were conducted by nearly all of the studies, while exergy and economic analysis was covered by very few of them. The simulation results for the product gas composition and carbon conversion efficiency changed with temperature, pressure, ER, SBR, biomass average particle size and residence time. Higher temperature improved the thermo-chemical process. It increased both the production of hydrogen and the carbon conversion efficiency while carbon monoxide and methane showed decreasing trends with increasing temperature. The temperature and pressure changed from 480 to 1400°C and from 0.1 to 50MPa, respectively. Although in biomass gasification issues, air, steam, oxygen or oxygen/steam have been utilized as the gasifying agents, steam gasification is the widely used one. SBR and ER operating values varied from 0.6 to 10 and 0.1 to 0.4, respectively. Steam has been in use as the gasifying agent with the product gas heating value of about 10–15MJ/Nm3, compared to 3–6MJ/Nm3 for air gasification of biomass. Calcium oxide (CaO) sorbent for CO2 and ZnCI2 and dolomite for catalysts were used in most of studies, in which carbon conversion ratio varied between 48.6 and 83.5%. Using different catalysts may increase its value up to 96%. Cost analysis was made in a few studies. Product supply cost was 0.15$/Nm3H2 (or 0.82$/kgH2). Low or fast pyrolysis was used for a liquid product and bio-oil, followed by catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil to produce hydrogen. Temperatures were in the range of 480–790°C, while LHVs of the gaseous product were not affected by the increase in the temperature. LHV value of fast pyrolysis was around 14MJ/m3. An environmentally friendly and cost-competitive way of producing hydrogen is the catalytic steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis liquids, known as bio-oil. It was used in different catalysts as well as commercial catalyst C11-NK, three different Ni co-precipitated catalysts [23, 28 and 33% expressed as a Ni/(Ni+Al) relative to % of nickel] and novel metal-doped catalysts of [Ca24Al28O64]4+·4O−/M (CI2A7-O−/M, M=Mg, K, Ce). Biomass gasification for hydrogen production in SCW is a promising technology for high moisture biomass utilization. High energy conversion efficiency is achieved as the processes avoid the drying step. For oil palm biomass, maximum theoretical pure hydrogen production efficiency values were 57.96% and 34.93% with and without recovery, respectively. High ratios of hydrogen up to 38.5% were produced from the sewage disposals. This value was even higher than the hydrogen production ratios from other biomass, namely 15% from cellulose, 14.1% from pulp, 16% from waste paper and 27% from paper sludge."
2,Classification of biomass-based hydrogen production methods,"Biomass comprises all the living matter present on earth. It is derived from growing plants including algae, trees and crops or from animal manure. The biomass resources are the organic matters in which the solar energy is stored in chemical bonds. It generally consists of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Sulfur is also present in minor proportions. Some biomass also consists of significant amounts of inorganic species. Plants, via photosynthesis, produce carbohydrates which form the building blocks of biomass (e.g., [47]). Biomass can be converted into useful forms of energy products using a number of different processes. Factors that influence the choice of process are the type and quantity of biomass feedstock [4]. There are two routes for biomass conversion into hydrogen-rich gas, namely (i) Thermo-chemical conversion, and (ii) Bio-chemical/biological conversion."
3,Thermo-chemical conversions,"3.1 Thermo-chemical conversions Thermo-chemical conversion involves a series of cyclical chemical reaction for releasing hydrogen. There are main three methods for biomass-based hydrogen production via this conversion: (i) pyrolysis, (ii) conventional gasification, and (iii) SCWG, respectively. 3.1.1 Pyrolysis Pyrolysis is conversion of biomass to liquid, solid and gaseous fractions by heating the biomass in the absence of air at around 500°C temperature. In addition to gaseous product, pyrolysis produces a liquid product called bio-oil, which is the basis of several processes for the development of the various energy fuels and chemicals. Pyrolysis reaction is an endothermic reaction. Pyrolysis is an important process for obtaining energy from biomass. Valuable hydrogen-rich gas can also be generated by pyrolysis. There are three methods for producing hydrogen-rich gas. Firstly, hydrogen can be produced by steam reforming of pyrolysis liquid obtained from the pyrolysis of biomass. Secondly, the pyrolysis process is carried out around 700°C and including the removal of tar content of the gas and improving the quality of the product gas. In the second stage catalysts, normally dolomites and Ni, high temperatures, steam and oxygen could be used. In the third option, the pyrolysis occurs at a lower temperature (<750°C) and catalyst is incorporated in the same reactor where the pyrolysis of biomass occurs. Catalytic pyrolysis/gasification is one of the promising options for tar elimination from the product gas [4]. Fast pyrolysis of plant material, such as wood or nutshells, at temperatures between 800 and 900°C leaves as little as 10% of the material as solid char and converts some 60% into gas rich in hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This makes fast pyrolysis a competitor with conventional gasification methods (e.g., [47]). Pyrolysis may be defined as an incomplete thermal degradation of carbonaceous materials to char, condensable liquids (tar, oils or bio-oils) and non-condensable gases in the absence of air or oxygen. Fast pyrolysis is a thermal or thermo-catalytic conversion process, which can be characterized by rapid heating rates, quick quenching, and exclusion of oxygen from the reaction zone. It yields valuable chemical intermediates as well as synthesis gas from biomass [48]. Fast pyrolysis is interesting as a liquid is produced that offers advantages in storage and transport and versatility in applications, although it is still at relatively early stage of development. Typical properties and characteristics of wood derived crude bio-oil are investigated. Water comes from moisture in the feed and reaction water and cannot be separated. The values can range from 15 to 35%. Bio-oil has a higher heating value of about 18MJ/kg as produced with about 25%wt. water that cannot be separated (e.g., [49]). Pokorna et al. [50] conducted a study on the production of pyrolysis oil from three types of sewage sludge. The flash pyrolysis was done at 500°C, the maximum oil yield was 43.1%, and the water content in bio-oils obtained from secondary sludge was relatively low, e.g., 10.3%–17.0%, respectively. 3.1.2 Gasification As a matter of fact, gasification is not a new process. Especially, coal gasification has been used for many decades before improving natural gas. There are several reasons why interest in biomass gasification has increased in more recent years. It can be obtained a fuel much cleaner than the original biomass and a gas is a much more versatile fuel. Gasification is the conversion of biomass into a combustible gas mixture via the partial oxidation at high temperatures, typically varying from 800 to 900°C. Biomass is converted completely to CO and H2 although in practice some CO2, water and other hydrocarbons including methane in an ideal gasification. The char compositions occurred by the fast pyrolysis of biomass can be gasified with gasifying agents. Air, oxygen and steam are widely used gasifying agents. Reaction conditions along with heating values are mentioned as follows: (i) Oxygen gasification: It yields a better quality gas of heating value of 10–15MJ/Nm3. In this process, the temperatures between 1000 and 1400°C are achieved. O2 supply may bring a simultaneous problem of cost and safety (e.g., [4]). (ii) Air gasification: It is most widely used technology as being cheap, single product is formed at high efficiency and without requiring oxygen. A low heating value gas is produced containing up to 60% N2 having a typical heating value of 4–6MJ/Nm3 with by-products such as water, CO2, hydrocarbons, tar, and nitrogen gas. The reactor temperatures between 900 and 1100°C have been achieved [4]. (iii) Steam gasification: Biomass steam gasification converts carbonaceous material to permanent gases (H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and light hydrocarbons), char and tar. This method has some problems such as corrosion, poisoning of catalysts and minimizing tar components [4]. Ahmed and Gupta [51] investigated experimentally main characteristics of gaseous yield from steam gasification. Results of steam gasification were compared to that of pyrolysis. The temperature range investigated were 600–1000°C. Results of steam gasification were compared to that of pyrolysis at same temperatures. For steam gasification runs, steam flow rate was kept constant at 8.0g/min. Material destruction, hydrogen yield and energy yield was better with gasification as compared to pyrolysis. This advantage of the gasification process was attributed mainly to char gasification process. A partial overlap existed between gasification and pyrolysis. As an example, at reactor temperature 800°C this overlap represented around 27% of the char gasification process and almost 95% at reactor temperature 1000°C. On the energy side, gasification of 35g of white paper yielded 250–440kJ as compared to 50–300kJ in case of pyrolysis, for reactor temperature ranging from 700 to 1000°C. Florin and Harris [31] investigated steam gasification of biomass, in the presence of a calcium oxide (CaO) sorbent for CO2 capture, as a promising pathway for renewable and sustainable production of hydrogen (H2). Maximum experimental H2 concentrations is reported for the steam gasification of biomass, without CO2 capture, ranged between 40 and 50% vol, when CaO is used to remove CO2 from the product gas, it increase 40–80% vol (dry basis). 3.1.3 Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) The properties of water displayed beyond critical point plays a significant role for chemical reactions, especially in the gasification process. Below the critical point, both the liquid and gas phases exhibit different properties, although it is apparent that these properties become increasingly alike as the temperature arises. Ultimately, when it reaches the critical point (temperature >374°C, pressure >22MPa), the properties of both liquid and gas become identical. Over the critical point, the properties of this SCW vary in between liquid-like or gas-like conditions. SCW is completely miscible with organic substance as well as with gases. The utilization of SCW medium in biomass gasification has several advantages. It can directly deal with high moisture content biomass (>50%). Therefore, biomass drying can be avoided (e.g., [38])."
4,Biological conversion,"3.2 Biological conversion Another method for biomass-based hydrogen is biological-conversions. These are summarized as fermentative hydrogen production, photosynthesis process and hydrogen production by BWGS. All processes depend on hydrogen production enzymes. 3.2.1 Fermentative hydrogen production Biohydrogen production can be realized by anaerobic (dark fermentation) and photoheterotrophic (light fermentation) microorganisms using carbohydrate rich biomass as a renewable resource. The first step is the acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass to highly concentrated sugar solution which is further fermented by anaerobic organisms to produce volatile fatty acids (VFA), hydrogen and CO2. The organic acids are further fermented by the photo-heterotrophic bacteria (Rhodobacter sp) to produce CO2 and H2 which is known as the light fermentation. Combined utilization of dark and photo fermentations was reported to improve the yield of hydrogen formation from carbohydrates (e.g., [44]). 3.2.2 Photosynthesis process Many phototropic organisms, such as purple bacteria, green bacteria, Cyanobacteria and several algae can be used to produce hydrogen with the aid of solar energy. Microalgae, such as green algae and Cyanobacteria, absorb light energy and generate electrons. The electrons are then transferred to ferredoxin (FD) using the solar energy absorbed by photo-system. However, the mechanism varies from organism to organism but the main steps are similar (e.g., [52]). 3.2.3 Biological water gas shift reaction (BWGS) The BWGS is a relatively new method for hydrogen production. Some bacteria (certain photo-heterotrophic bacteria), such as Rubrivivax gelatinosus, are capable of performing water gas shift reaction at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Such bacteria can survive in the dark by using CO as the sole carbon source to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) coupling the oxidation of CO with the reduction of H+ to H2. The purple non-sulfur bacteria perform CO–water gas shift reaction in darkness' converting 100% CO into nearstoichiometric amount of hydrogen. CO may also be utilized in the presence of other organic substrates. The biomass available in the nature can easily be converted to water gas (CO and H2O) by thermo-chemical conversion. It is reported in Ref. [52] that 1kg of cells can produce 1kg of hydrogen per day in a bubble column or trickling bed bioreactor. Hydrogen synthesis rate by biowater gas shift reaction was reported by the same authors as 96mmolH2/Lh as compared to 20–50mmolH2/Lh by dark anaerobic fermentation process. They estimated that the processing cost of hydrogen production by biowater-gas shift process would be $3.4/kg as compared to other biological processing cost at around $12–20/kg."
5,Performance evaluation methods through energy and exergy,"Energy and exergy analyses can effectively be employed for performance evaluation of the biomass systems. In this regard, the balance equations in terms of mass, energy and exergy for steady state, constant-flow control volume systems, and appropriate energy and exergy efficiency equations are written for these systems and their components. Here we will not provide those details, but rather on efficiency assessment through energy and exergy efficiencies to provide a comparative performance assessment (for details see, Refs [42,53–56]). • Energy efficiency Basically, the energy efficiency of the system is defined as the ratio of useful energy output divided by the total energy input as follows: (1) η = E ˙ out E ˙ in where E ˙ and the subscripts in and out stand energy rate, and inlet and outlet. • Exergy efficiency In a similar fashion, we can write the exergy efficiency as the ratio of useful exergy output divided by the total exergy input: (2) ɛ = E ˙ x out E ˙ x in where E ˙ x is the exergy flow. The physical exergy rate of gas mixture is derived from the conventional linear mixing rule as follows: (3) E ˙ x ph = ∑ i y i E ˙ x i , ph and the chemical exergy rate of gas mixture is given by (4) E ˙ x c = ∑ i y i e 0 , i + RT 0 ∑ i y i ln y i where the subscript ph and c stand physical and chemical, so y means molar fraction of component i in the gas phase. Also, e 0,i is the standard chemical exergy of a pure chemical compound i. e 0,i is equal to the maximum amount of work obtainable when a compound is brought from the environmental state, characterized by the environmental temperature T 0 and environmental pressure P 0, to the dead state, characterized by the same environmental conditions of temperature and pressure, but also by the concentration of reference substances in standard environment. A common standard environment approach (suggested by [54]) is used here. The chemical exergy of biomass is hard to define and therefore, the statistical correlation of Szargut and Styrylskawas [54] may be used as follows: (5) e 0 , biomass = β LHV biomass where LHVbiomass is the lower heating value, and β is defined as (6) β = 1.0412 + 0.2160 ( Z H / Z C ) − 0.2499 ( Z O / Z C ) [ 1 + 0.7884 ( Z H / Z C ) ] + 0.0450 ( Z N / Z C ) 1 − 0.3035 ( Z O / Z C ) where Z O, Z C, Z H and Z N are the weight fractions of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, respectively, in the biomass. The general exergy balance equation becomes (7) ∑ in E ˙ x in = ∑ out E ˙ x out + I ˙ where I ˙ is the internal exergy loss rate due to irreversibility. • Improvement potential rate Van Gool [55] indicated that maximum improvement in the exergy efficiency for a process or system is obviously achieved when the exergy loss or irreversibility rates ( E ˙ x in − E ˙ x out ) are minimized. Consequently, he suggested that it is useful to employ the concept of an exergetic “improvement potential” when analyzing different processes or sectors of the economy. This improvement potential in the rate form, denoted I P ˙ , is given by (8) I P ˙ = ( 1 − ɛ ) ( E ˙ x in − E ˙ x out ) • Some other thermodynamic parameters There are also some other thermodynamic parameters developed in the literature (e.g., [56]), and we will apply these to this biomass system through: - Fuel depletion ratio: (9) δ i = I ˙ i F ˙ T - Relative irreversibility: (10) χ i = I ˙ i I ˙ T - Productivity lack: (11) ξ i = I ˙ i P ˙ T - Exergetic factor: (12) f i = F ˙ i F ˙ T"
6,Process parameters and their effects,"4.1 Process parameters and their effects The process parameters affect various performance aspects like efficiency, product gas quality, energy and exergy inputs. Many of studies have been undertaken to investigate the optimum parameters to obtain maximum hydrogen yield or syngas. Moghtaderi [57] conducted a study to gain a fundamental understanding about the catalytic steam gasification of some species under low temperature conditions. His research, in particular, focused on the role and relative importance of controlling parameters, such as reaction temperature and the heating rate on the composition of the products. In the experimental study temperatures changed from 200 to 800°C and investigated with catalyst and non-catalyst situations. The residence time changed as 20mins or 2mins. Addition of catalyst particles changed the selectivity of gasification reaction enhancing hydrogen production while reducing the levels of methane produced at temperature above 500°C. At lower temperatures (200°C< T <450°C) the catalysts appeared to have no significant impact on hydrogen yield although they increased the yield of methane. A relatively low reaction temperature of 600°C and a high steam content of about 90% showed the strongest tendency for maximizing the hydrogen production. Florin and Harris [58] reported on the consequences of the thermodynamic equilibrium for hydrogen generation via steam gasification of biomass, coupled with in situ CO2 capture calcium oxide (CaO). The reaction system was considered over temperatures from 327°C to 1327°C, at 1 bar. The maximum predicted H2 concentration of 83%-mol was achieved for a temperature range from 527°C to 567°C, representing an increase of ∼25%-mol, when compared with the process without CO2 capture. In the high temperature range, from 627°C to 1327°C, a dramatic decrease in the H2 concentration was observed from 83 to 57%-mol. This decline corresponds with the deactivation of the CaO sorbent. Increasing the steam to biomass molar ratio was predicted to lead to an increase in the H2 yield; however, the concentration of H2 in the product gas was predicted to decrease. For example at 707°C, H2 was accounted for 78, 74, 67 and 35%-mol of the elemental hydrogen in the reaction system, with steam to biomass ratios of 1, 1.5, 2 and 5, respectively. In order to determine the influence of the sorbent to fuel ratio, the Ca:C molar ratio was varied from 0 to 2. They predicted a maximum H2 concentration of 83% mol, with a steam to biomass ratio of 1.5 and Ca to C ratio of 0.9. This maximum H2 output was reported at the atmospheric pressure. Midilli et al. [59] investigated the potential of hydrogen production from hazelnut shells by using a downdraft gasification technique. The effects of air fuel ratio and oxidation zone temperatures on the production of hydrogen gas were discussed. In their study the endothermic and exothermic reactions took place between 821°C and 1021°C at the oxidation zone of downdraft gasifier. The air fuel ratios were between 1.37 and 1.64m3/kg. The flow rate of hydrogen gas and the temperatures of oxidation zone decreased with the increase of air fuel ratio. The production of hydrogen gas was sufficiently achieved at between 1.44 and 1.52m3/kg of air fuel ratios. The hydrogen yield obtained in the downdraft reactor was almost 2.4kg/h of hydrogen from 100kg of wet hazelnut shells. Midilli et al. [60] also studied hydrogen production from sewage sludge via a fixed bed gasifier product gas. In their study, the endothermic and exothermic reactions took place at temperatures between 1009°C and 1077°C in the oxidation and reduction zone of downdraft gasifier for all runs. While feed of wet sewage sludge changed from 2.86 to 3.94kg/h, mass flow rate of hydrogen gas range from 0.045 to 0.082kg/h. Boateng et al. [61] designed a novel gasification reactor for conversion of grass straw to synthesis gas. The reactor that was constructed and tested in their study follows a new design technique whereby the endothermic pyrolysis or gasification and exothermic char combustion co-exist in the same reactor at atmospheric pressure. Their tests demonstrated the reactor stability at gasification temperatures up to 650°C. They determined the equivalence ratios of combustion in the inner tube ranging from 0.3 to 0.78, which indicated the fuel lean combustion of residual char without slagging. The percent carbon conversion ranged between 35.4 and 44.8%. The energy recovery was estimated as the ratio of the heat of combustion of the gas to that of the dry-ash-free feedstock, ranged from 14.7% to 30.92%. They also determined the heating values for the synthesis gas ranging from 1.27 to 2.85MJ/m3, respectively. García Jarana et al. [62] tested a SCWG on a laboratory-scale continuous-flow system with two different industrial wastewaters, such as cutting oil wastes, oleaginous wastewater from metalworking industries, and vinasse, alcohol distillery wastewater. The influence of the temperature, amount of oxidant and catalyst addition on the yield and composition of the gas phase generated were studied. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range 450–550°C, the amount of oxidant ranged from the absence of oxygen (oxygen coefficient, n =0) to 20% of stoichiometric oxygen (n =0.2), and 25MPa of pressure in all cases. A maximum of 0.19molH2 per initial CODm (CODm was given as mol O2 consumed for total oxidation) was obtained in the gas phase under the best conditions. 4.1.1 Effect of temperature The gasification temperature not only affects the product yield but also governs the process energy input. A high gasification temperature, particularly between 800 and 850°C, produces a gas mixture rich in H2 and CO with small amounts of CH4 and higher hydrocarbons. At low temperatures, solid carbon (C(s)) and CH4 are present in the product gas. In actual gasifiers solid carbon is carried away to the catalytic bed and is deposited on the active catalyst sites thereby de-activating the catalyst. It is necessary to ensure that the product gas is free of any solid carbon. As temperature increases, both carbon and methane are reformed. At about 726.85°C both are reduced to very small amounts (≤ 0.04moles) and in the process get converted into CO and H2. This explains the increase in hydrogen mole numbers. At about 756.85°C, the H2 yield reaches a maximum value of about 1.33 moles. At higher temperatures the H2 yield starts reducing. This is attributed to the Water–Gas Shift (WGS) reaction [63]. 4.1.2 Effect of pressure Pressure increases equilibrium H2 and CO yields reduce. Simulations carried out to study the effect of reducing the pressure below 101.325kPa on equilibrium product yield showed that increase in H2 yield is negligible (<0.2%) even for pressures as low as 10.13kPa (e.g., [63]). 4.1.3 Effect of steam biomass ratio The steam biomass ratio (SBR) denoted by β, refers to moles of steam fed per mole of biomass. SBR, like temperature has a strong influence on both product gas composition and energy input. At low values of SBR, solid carbon and methane are formed. As more steam is supplied, both of these species are reformed to CO and H2. For β >1, C(s) and CH4 moles reduce to very small values and H2 and CO2 yields increase monotonically; CO on the other hand reduces monotonically (e.g., [63,64]), (13) SBR = m ˙ steam + m ˙ moisture m ˙ biomass ( 1 − % wt wb H 2 O biomass ) 4.1.4 Effect of equivalence ratio The equivalent ratio (ER) is a measure of the amount of external oxygen (or air) supplied to the gasifier, while it is obtained by dividing the actual oxygen (or air) to biomass molar ratio by the stoichiometric oxygen (or air) to biomass molar ratio. Oxygen (or air) is generally supplied as a gasifying and fluidizing medium. Using air in place of oxygen, though economical, has the negative effect of diluting the product gas due to the presence of nitrogen. Air gasification is an exothermic process and hence using air as a gasifying medium reduces the net energy consumption and improves the overall thermodynamic efficiency. However supplying more air dilutes the product gas thereby reducing the H2 yield. The optimum ER would supply enough air for the biomass to be partially oxidized without significant dilution of the product gas (e.g., [63,64]), (14) ER = Weight of oxidant / weight of dry biomass Stoichiometric oxidant / dry biomass ratio 4.1.5 Effect of gasification agents Biomass can be gasified using different gasifying media, the choice of which depends on the desired product gas composition and energy considerations. Commercial and research gasifiers generally use steam or air as the gasifying media. Air gasification is an exothermic process, which produces a low heating-value gas (LHV 5–6MJ/Nm3) rich in CO and having small amounts of H2 and higher hydrocarbons. Steam gasification on the other hand is an endothermic process, which produces a medium heating value gas (LHV 12–13MJ/Nm3) rich in H2 and CO [63]. 4.1.6 Characteristics of biomass Characteristics of biomass are determined through physical properties, proximate and ultimate analyses. Physical properties contain the particulate size, absolute density and bulk density. Proximate analysis includes the volatile matter, moisture content, fixed carbon, ash content and gross calorific value (GCV) and the ultimate analysis comprises the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur of the dry biomass on a weight percentage basis. The moisture of fuel effects on the amount of combustible gases and can cause the increase in the amount of hydrogen gas and other hydrocarbon components. If high moisture fuel is used in the gasifier, efficiency of the gasifier decreases [59]. The upper limit of moisture for a downdraft reactor is generally considered to be not more than 30% wet basis. The maximum particle size is recommended to be used in a downdraft gasifier as one-eighth of the reactor diameter [65]. 4.1.7 Flow rate of produced wet gas The produced gas (or wet produced gas) contains the combustible (such as H2, CO, CH4, C2H2 and C2H6) and noncombustible gases (such as N2 and CO2), moisture, tar and dust. Gas composition is dependent on feedstock composition, type of gasification reactor, gasification agents and operating condition. 4.1.8 The effect of oxidation zone temperature on hydrogen production As indicated in [60], the values of the flow rate of hydrogen gas and temperature of oxidation zone changes with feed rate of wet biomass. During the downdraft gasification of wet biomass, it was assumed that the following chemical reactions take place in the reactor bed: water gas reaction (endothermic) and water gas shift reaction (exothermic). The primary water gas reaction becomes significant at temperatures of 1000°C–1100°C and upward. The secondary water gas reaction begins and predominates between 500°C and 600°C while the water gas shift reaction is purely a gaseous reaction, which takes place in the presence of undecomposed steam. Since taking place in the reactor bed, an endothermic reaction, which produces hydrogen gas, uses the heat, which is produced by the exothermic reactions at the oxidation zone, and therefore the temperature of oxidation zone decreases. On the contrary, when an exothermic reaction also producing hydrogen gas happens in the reactor bed, then the heat generated increases the temperature of oxidation zone. The production of hydrogen gas requires the external heat (endothermic reactions) at above 1000°C and the heat required to derive these reactions is provided from exothermic reactions. Also, both much more tar output and the aggregation of wet sewage sludge on the grate and the adhesion of wet sewage sludge on the walls of the gasifier should be taken into consideration in order to improve the output of hydrogen gas by depending on temperature of oxidation zone [60]. 4.1.9 Specific gasification rate The specific gasification rate can be considered as an indicator of the size of the gas producer for a given throughput, and is strongly depending on the type of gas producer and on the fuel characteristics. Specific gasification rate is calculated by the following equation: (15) R sg = F dvg A t where R, sg, F and dvg stand ratio, specific gasification, total volumetric flow and dry gas. Also A and t mean cross-sectional area and throat. The amounts of the produced wet gas and the combustible gas go up with the increase of specific gasification rate. But the most productive region for gasification of biomass is normally at an interval of the specific gasification rate [65,66]. 4.1.10 Turndown ratio Turndown is defined as the ability of the gasifier to respond to the changes in demand for the produced wet gas with different capacity of biomass, and at the same time, operated with a stable reaction zone. Turndown ratio is often quoted in the gasifier trade leaflets, but most of these are ambiguous. It was observed that turndown ratio goes up almost linearly with the increase of the capacity of dry fuel as well as the amounts of the produced wet gas and combustible gas [65,66]. So, the Turndown ratio is calculated by the following equation: (16) R td = C db C mdb where R, td, C, db and mdb stand ratio, turndown, capacity, dry biomass and maximum dry biomass. 4.1.11 Gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) Tars are undesirable products in biomass thermo-chemical gasification processes for a number of reasons. There are a number of methods to separate or reform tars from the product gas-like wet scrubbing, thermal cracking or catalytic cracking. Wet scrubbing does not eliminate tars but merely transfers the problem from gas phase to condensed phase. Thermal cracking is a hot gas conditioning option but it requires high temperatures (more than 1100°C) to achieve high conversion efficiencies. This process may also produce soot which is an unwanted impurity in the product gas stream. Catalytic steam reforming is an attractive hot gas conditioning method. Broadly three groups of catalyst materials have been used for biomass gasification systems: alkali metals, non-metallic oxides, and supported metallic oxides. The effect of catalyst poisons like sulfur, chlorine and alkali metals, continued catalyst regeneration, cost and lifetime can be critically evaluated with long term catalyst testing [63]. The GHSV is defined as the ratio of volumetric flow of reactants at standard conditions (25°C and 101.325kPa) to the total catalyst volume and has units of inverse time [35]. (17) GHSV = ( m ˙ inlet Vol catalyst ρ inlet ) ST where m ˙ , Vol and ρ means the mass flow rate of the reactants, the total catalyst volume and the density of the reactants, respectively. The general tendency via increasing this value is that the gas yields increase with a consequent decrease in the respective liquid yields. The effects of GHSV on product gas have been studied by various researchers [36,37,67]. The expression of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is used in some studies like GHSV. WHSV is defined as the mass flow rate of biomass fed to gasifier divided by the mass of catalyst in the catalytic reactor [67]."
7,Case study,"Here, a case study is conducted on pine wood gasification system via oxygen and steam in a downdraft gasifier as taken from Ref. [18]. The necessary data are also taken from this source for exergy analysis and performance assessment purposes."
8,Process flow diagram of H2 system,"5.1 Process flow diagram of H2 system Fig. 5 shows a process flow diagram of this system. Biomass is first pretreated by cutting into proper size and then they are put into the gasifier and gasify with oxygen-rich air and steam. Steam is self-produced by utilizing radiative heat of gasifier wall. Oxygen-rich air is prepared by the PSA equipment. After gas cleaning, the fuel gas generated by downdraft gasifier further goes through a CO-shift reaction to raise hydrogen content in the raw gas product. Then the hydrogen-rich gas enters into the PSA equipment. In the PSA equipment for purified H2 production, if possible, the off gas is sent to a gas engine for power generation. Table 1 lists the feed properties, while Table 2 presents a representative operating condition for this system. The temperature in the gasifier and CO-shift reactor is controlled at 800 and 600°C, respectively. The catalyst lifetime is assumed to be as long as 250h. The amount of synthesis is about 427Nm3/h and its main components are H2, CO2 and CO. The energy conversion efficiency of this system gets to 51.5% (calculated by H2 yield), while cold gas efficiency (based on LHV) is 69.9%."
9,Chemical processes in a downdraft gasifier,"5.2 Chemical processes in a downdraft gasifier As shown in Fig. 6 , gases and solids move forward with the same direction in the downdraft gasifier, different reactions occur in the different zones. In the drying zone, the temperature varies from 150 to 300°C; therefore, water vaporization mainly occurs in this zone. In the pyrolysis zone, at a temperature of about 600°C, the pyrolysis of biomass starts and produces char, tar and gas. In the combustion zone, because of the presence of oxygen, oxidization reactions of biomass pyrolysis products proceed here to provide required heat for the whole gasification. biomass → char + tar + gases ( CO 2 , CO , H 2 O , H 2 , CH 4 , C n H m ) C + O 2 = CO 2 + 408 kJ / mol 2 C + O 2 = 2 CO + 246 kJ / mol In the reduction and catalyst zones, secondary reactions of biomass pyrolysis and oxidization products proceed, such as cracking, reforming and tar decomposition. tar → gases ( CO 2 , CO , H 2 O , H 2 , CH 4 , C n H m ) CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 + 41 kJ / mol CH 4 + H 2 O = CO + 3 H 2 − 206 kJ / mol CH 4 + 2 H 2 O = CO 2 + 4 H 2 − 165 kJ / mol C + H 2 O = CO + H 2 − 131 kJ / mol C + H 2 = CH 4 − 75 kJ / mol C + CO 2 = 2 CO − 172 kJ / mol Based on the above given analysis, one can see that a downdraft gasifier is advantageous in achieving a higher H2 content compared to other types of gasifiers."
10,Characteristics of pine wood,"5.3 Characteristics of pine wood As can be seen from Table 1, HHV and LHV values of pine wood are 20.54 and 18.87MJ/kg. The main components of pine wood according to ultimate analysis are C and O as 50.54% and 41.11%, respectively also H value is only 7.08%. We know that the moisture of pine wood effects on the amount of combustible gases and can cause the increase of the amount of hydrogen gas and other hydrocarbon components. If high moisture fuel is used in the gasifier, efficiency of the gasifier decreases. The moisture content of pine wood was 8% which was found reasonable for gasifier operation."
11,Produced gas composition,"5.4 Produced gas composition The composition of the produced gas is presented in Table 2. The produced gases contain both the combustible gases and noncombustible gases. The combustible gases are such as H2, CO, CH4, C2H2 and C2H6, while the noncombustible gases also include N2 and CO2. Percentages of combustible and noncombustible gases are 67.7% and 32.3%. Also, hydrogen value of product gas is 56.3%. Finally, gas flow rate and LHV are 427Nm3/h and 8.24MJ/Nm3. The volume percentages of the produced gas depend on the operating conditions."
12,Air fuel ratio,"5.5 Air fuel ratio The increase in air fuel ratio can result in combustion instead of gasification in the reactor and also combustion from the oxidation zone travels to the pyrolysis zone undesirably caused burnout in the upper zones of the reactor. Therefore, it is suggested that the optimum values of air fuel ratio. In this study ratio of oxygen-rich air to biomass feed rate is 0.26m3/kg and oxygen-rich air is prepared by the PSA equipment."
13,Steam biomass ratio,"5.6 Steam biomass ratio We know that SBR influence on both product gas composition and energy input. In this study SBR was calculated as 0.27 using Eq. (13). At low values of SBR, solid carbon and methane are formed. In the most of experimental studies, SBR is investigated for interval. Because H2 production goes up via higher SBR, energy input increase at the same time. So, optimum SBR values should be found for that operation conditions. In this case study, steam is self-produced by utilizing radiative heat of gasifier wall."
14,Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV),"5.7 Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) Catalyst zones purpose to contribute to more H2 production. In this case study, biomass feed rate is 266.7kg/h and WHSV is 2.5 1/h. Z409R catalyst which has 250h lifetime, was used in this study. The effects of different WHSV values on hydrogen or product gas could not be displayed, because of lack data. Although in this case study, dimensions of the downdraft gasifier and maximum dry biomass capacity are not given, R sg and R td cannot be calculated."
15,Exergy analysis of gasifier,"5.8 Exergy analysis of gasifier A process of oxygen-rich air gasification of biomass in a downdraft gasifier plus CO-shift was taken into consideration. The gasifier in this process was selected for exergetic evaluation purposes. Here, temperatures for oxygen and steam were assumed to be 76.85 and 300°C, respectively, while pressures for those were taken to be the same with 101.325kPa. Exergy values for biomass, steam and oxygen-rich air and products were calculated using Eqs. (3)–(6). The values for exergy efficiency, exergy destruction rate, and improvement potential rate were also obtained from Eqs. (2), (7), and (8). Exergy rate of a material stream includes physical and chemical exergy rates. Because biomass is at the reference temperature and pressure, its physical exergy rate is zero and its chemical exergy rate is found to be 1563.9kW. For steam and O2-rich air, chemical exergies are zero, while physical exergy is calculated to be 8.05 and 0.128kW, respectively. Product gas is a mix gas, mainly occurs from H2 and CO2. Considering the gasification reaction, products have physical and chemical exergy rates with 52.4 and 849.24kW, respectively. Using these data, exergy efficiency is obtained to be 56.8%. It should be noticed that this efficiency value is calculated only for the gasifier, not for the whole system since all the data were not available. Exergy destruction rate was also calculated to be 670.43kW, while improvement potential rate was found to be 288.28kW, as illustrated in Fig. 7 and Table 3 . Exergy destructions occur in the gasifier, while exergy is essentially lost with the products. To minimize exergy destructions, operating parameters, such as temperature, pressure, SBR and ER, should be optimized, and the type of gasifier should carefully be selected. Nonetheless, we can compare energy efficiency with exergy efficiency since the gasifier is one of the key components in such biomass-based hydrogen production systems. The efficiency may generally be defined as the ratio of useful output (product) to total input. Of course, before we calculate the exergy efficiency, we should decide what the product is since it may be only hydrogen or other gaseous products. In this paper, energy efficiency is studied according to hydrogen and gaseous product. The energy conversion efficiency of this system was found to be 51.5% (calculated based upon the H2 yield), while the cold gas efficiency (based on the LHV) was obtained to be 69.9% [18]. It is obvious that the exergy efficiency calculated in this study is smaller than the cold gas efficiency, as shown in Fig. 8 . Studies conducted on exergy analysis of biomass gasification systems are relatively small in the open literature. Prins et al. [53] performed energy and exergy analyses of gas-char reactions. They focused on the conversion of biomass (CH1.4O0.59N0.0017) with air and/or steam into gaseous components and char represented by solid carbon. The exergy content of char was considered, and the production of the steam was not taken into account in their analysis. Exergy efficiencies were calculated to be 87.6% and 80.5% for the steam and air gasification, respectively. Their reported values are higher than those we obtained from the case study here. This is essentially due to difference in the product gas compositions as given in Fig. 9 for the present analysis, and the hydrogen gas composition is reported to be 56.3% in Ref. [18]. It is obvious that this value may change depending on the operating parameters. Since a wide range of parameters has not been given in this source, it is difficult to make a more accurate comparison. As can be seen in Fig. 10 , the hydrogen yields (vol %) obtained here change from 40% to 80%, respectively. The difference between these is due to a wide range of operating parameters and utilization of catalyst and CO2 sorbent. Having said this, the result of Prins et al. [53] (as 56.3%) well lies in this range, which may show some degree of agreement with the literature data. Also, the fuel depletion ratio, relative irreversibility, productivity lack and exergetic factor parameters are calculated for all of components of gasification systems using Eqs. (9)–(12). These parameters were essentially calculated for only downdraft gasifier because of lack data. As can be seen in Table 4 , the fuel depletion ratio and productivity lack is 43% and 74.3%. Both the relative irreversibility and the exergetic factor is 100% due to the one component nature."
16,Conclusions,"In this study, some potential biomass-based hydrogen production methods have been discussed under two main categories: thermo-chemical (e.g., gasification, pyrolysis and SCW) and bio-chemical conversions (e.g., fermentation, photosynthesis, and biological water gas shift reaction). The operating pressure varies from 0.1 to 50MPa, while the operating temperature ranges from 480 to 1400°C for various thermo-chemical processes. The SBR and ER optimum values are in the range of 0.6–10 and 0.1–0.4, respectively. Steam is widely used as the gasifying agent with the product gas heating value of about 10–15MJ/Nm3, compared to 3–6MJ/Nm3 for air gasification of biomass. Slow or fast pyrolysis is normally carried out at a temperature range of 480–790°C, while LHVs of the gaseous product are not affected by increasing the temperature. The LHV of fast pyrolysis is around 14MJ/m3. Energy efficiency values of the gasification reaction, SCW, vary from 40 to 46.54%. The following concluding remarks are extracted from this study: • Exergy efficiency of the downdraft gasifier given as a case study is found to be 56.8%. • Irreversibility and improvement potential rates are calculated to be 670.43 and 288.28kW, respectively. • Also, exergetic fuel and exergetic product rates of the downdraft gasifier are calculated as 1572.08 and 901.64kW, while fuel depletion and productivity lack ratios are 43% and 74.3%. • Hydrogen fraction in the product gas varies between 40 and 80% and is consistent with the literature data. The future study will focus on exergoeconomic analysis such gasifiers."
