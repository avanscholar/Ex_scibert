0,Introduction,"Increasing energy consumption, depletion of fossil fuels, and environmental pollution caused by human activities represent major issues, and global challenges humankind is facing today. Hydrogen appears to be a promising candidate for replacing fossil fuels without adversely affecting fuel process efficiency and the environment. Hydrogen plays an irreplaceable role in the chemical industry, especially for ammonia, methanol, and steel production, in oil refining or fuel cells. Steam reforming of hydrocarbons is currently the most extensively used and most economical way to obtain hydrogen. This technology, however, produces large amounts of carbon dioxide as a byproduct, which is a significant greenhouse gas accumulating in the environment. Unlike steam reforming, water splitting is a promising hydrogen-production technology based on natural, sustainable, and clean resources with minimal impact on the environment [1–5]. Photocatalytic water splitting is based on harvesting light energy exploited for yielding hydrogen. Water splitting was shown to occur on irradiating a photocatalyst, habitually semiconductors such as TiO2. Despite its wide energy band gap of around 3.0–3.2 eV, allowing only UV light absorption, and rapid recombination of the separated electron-hole pairs, TiO2 is still the most researched photocatalyst for this purpose. The reasons for TiO2 use stem from its properties, including non-corrosivity, non-toxicity, photochemical stability, abundance in nature, and low purchasing cost [1,2,6–8]. The hydrogen production rate on TiO2 is proportional to the number of photoexcited electrons at the water/TiO2 interface. The overall quantum yield is estimated from the number of incident photons, and the number of hydrogen molecules evolved. For efficient water splitting, H+/H2 reduction potential (0 V vs. NHE) should be larger than the conduction band minimum edge of a photocatalyst and the H2O/O2 oxidation potential (+1.23 V vs. NHE), smaller than the valance band maximum edge. The overall water splitting by TiO2 is [9]: (1) H 2 O → H 2 + 1 2 O 2 Hydrogen generation from water splitting is an energetically uphill process (Gibb's free energy, ΔG0 = 237 kJ/mol) [10,11]. Therefore, a sacrificial agent fulfilling the role of an electron donor is used for TiO2-photocatalyzed water splitting. The sacrificial agent can exploit photogenerated holes, which can lead to the accumulation of photogenerated electrons on the photocatalyst surface for their reaction with H+ [9,10,12]. Most of the research so far has focused on the fundamental aspects of the process, i.e., on optimizing the band gap position, improving charge separation and transfer, enhancing photocatalyst stability, and lowering cost and toxicity [3]. Incomparably less attention has been paid to the description of the reaction kinetics of the photocatalytic processes. The accurate description of photocatalytic hydrogen generation requires comprehensive models incorporating both its kinetic and irradiation (photonic) mechanisms. [13–15] Since the models are usually complex, their careful validation against experimental data is imperative. The kinetics of photocatalytic reactions and, in particular, the effect of light intensity on Langmuir-Hinshelwood parameters were in the focus of several studies [16,17]. Using these studies, Hojaji et al. [13] concluded that a pseudo-steady state approach is more appropriate than a standard Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption equilibrium model. The importance of the light scattering effect, which should be included in a mathematical modelling of photoreactors, was reported by Cassano et al. [18], Leblebici et al. [19], Turolla et al. [20] or Casado et al. [21]. They also emphasized that the light distribution inside the photoreactor should be included in a mathematical model for the realistic prediction of the overall reactor performance. The radiative transfer equation allows the quantification of the radiation distribution on photocatalyst particles at a certain wavelength and can be solved by various methods [22–24]. Kinetic analysis of photocatalytic water splitting for H2 generation in the presence of different organic sacrificial agents (acid lactic, methanol, ethanol, glycerol) has been in the center of scientific interest in recent years. Such works included intrinsic kinetics of H2 generation based on the photocatalytic reaction mechanism [25–27] or the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic equation [13,28], and analyzed the effect of the light intensity [13,25–27], photocatalyst loading [13,25–27,29], substrate concentration [13,25,27], and the pH of the TiO2 suspension [26]. Karimi et al. [26] investigated the effect of pH on the photocatalytic hydrogen production process using glycerol, ethanol, and methanol as representative alcoholic substrates. They observed a significant reduction in the H2 production rate at strongly basic conditions. Their theoretical prediction of H2 production rate showed a good agreement with experimental data for all tested alcoholic substrates. Clarizia et al. [27] developed a model that determined the equilibrium adsorption constants and the kinetic constant of the hole-capture by sacrificial agents. The authors evaluated the quantum yield and the rate constant of electron-hole recombination for copper modified-TiO2 photocatalyst. The report by Escobedo et al. [28,29] described the kinetics of hydrogen photocatalytic production in the presence of Pt modified DP25 (TiO2) and ethanol as an organic scavenger. The rate equations were of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood type leading to a set of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the study revealed hydrogen formation follows near zero-order reaction kinetics. Although the kinetics of the photocataysis is largely understood and described, the transport of the produced hydrogen from the catalyst dispersed in the liquid phase to the gas phase and its effect on the process efficiency has not been analyzed yet. To fill this gap, we created a phenomenological kinetic model of hydrogen generation that considers a limiting rate of H2 mass transfer from the liquid to the gas phase. The model works with a spatial distribution of irradiation in the photoreactor, which intrinsically affects the reaction term in the H2 mass balance. We then investigate the effect of different concentrations of commercial TiO2 photocatalyst (Evonik P25) used as a comparative standard on photocatalytic activity. On the one hand, higher concentrations of TiO2 potentially provide a larger photoactive surface area for photocatalysis. On the other hand, high photocatalyst concentration can lead to the formation of larger photocatalyst aggregates resulting in a decrease in the active surface (the internal surface cannot be excited by light). The reduction in the active surface means smaller light absorption and quantum efficiency. Therefore, the photocatalyst concentration has an optimum which we also identify both theoretically and experimentally."
1,Experimental details,
2,Photocatalytic tests for kinetic model,"2.1 Photocatalytic tests for kinetic model Photocatalytic measurements were performed in a batch photoreactor (stainless steel, volume 348 mL, internal diameter 7.46 cm, height 7.3 cm, Fig. 1 ) mixed with a magnetic stirrer to eliminate suspension sedimentation (350 rpm). The Pen-Ray 8 W Hg UVC and UVA lamp (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc, US; peak intensity at 254 and 365 nm, respectively) and LED lamps (Thorlabs, Germany; peak intensity at 365 and 405 nm wavelength, with 1.4 W and 1.3 W, respectively) were used as radiation sources. The light source was placed horizontally on a quartz glass window at the top of the photoreactor. The reaction mixture contained 100 mL of distilled water/methanol solution (H2O:CH3OH = 1:1) and known quantities of commercial TiO2 photocatalyst (Evonik P25). Before starting the photocatalytic reaction, we saturated the reacting mixture with helium to purge the air. The reactor was tightly closed, and before commencing the reaction (i.e., switching on the lamp), we withdrew a gaseous sample (at time 0 h) through a septum with a syringe. The reaction mixture was then irradiated for 4 h, and the samples were taken at regular time intervals (1, 2, 3, and 4 h) and analyzed by means of a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Tracera GC-2010Plus, JP) equipped with a barrier discharge ionization detector (BID). The above-described measurements were carried out for different photocatalyst concentrations (0.1 g/L, 0.25 g/L, 0.5 g/L, and 1 g/L). The UV LED lamp (Thorlabs, Germany; peak intensity at 365 nm wavelength) was used as the irradiation source in those experiments. The photocatalytic tests were conducted repeatedly (triplicate) to confirm the reproducibility of the experiments. The error bars mean a standard deviation. The main product of the water splitting was hydrogen. Methane and carbon monoxide were also detected but in much smaller amounts."
3,Simulations for measuring light intensity in photoreactor,2.2 Simulations for measuring light intensity in photoreactor The spatial distribution of the radiation emitted by the 365 nm LED was obtained for a quartz glass reactor (Fig. S1) filled with a suspension of the photocatalyst in a methanol–water solution. The intensity was measured by UVA/UVC light meter (Extech instruments SDL470) in a darkened laboratory. The intensity measurement (at the height of the LED lamp 8 cm) proceeded from the reactor center (0 cm) outward with 1 cm spacing between the tested points. Such a measurement was performed for different level heights of the suspensions at all investigated photocatalyst concentrations.
4,Theoretical models,"Using an empirical approach, we consider the photocatalytic superficial reaction rate of hydrogen production to be a function of the reactants concentration. Since the sacrificial agent (methanol) is in excess, the reaction rate is controlled by the local light intensity. The empirical function for the local hydrogen reaction rate per unit of the photocatalyst surface then reads: (1) r H 2 x ̲ = α I x ̲ n Where α is the reaction rate constant, n is the reaction order, and I (x) is the light intensity at position x in the reactor. Based on the light intensity measured at different distances from the reactor center (according to Section 2.2), the following equation is proposed to describe the radiation field in the photoreactor for each tested photocatalyst concentration: (2) I z , r = c 1 z 2 + c 2 z + c 3 c 4 r + c 5 where r and z are the radial and longitudinal coordinates, respectively. The constants cn (n = 1,…,5) are the model coefficients obtained by fitting the experimental light intensity for each photocatalyst concentration. By assuming a pseudo-homogenous reaction system with a perfect mixing of the liquid phase and considering a finite photocatalytic production rate and mass transfer flux from the liquid to the gas phase, we write the H2 mass balance as: (3) ε d C L , H 2 d t = ε a V Ti O 2 r H 2 V L - a V G - L r G - L , H 2 Where C L , H 2 is the hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase, r H 2 V L is the average superficial reaction rate in the liquid phase volume, r G - L , H 2 is the mass transfer rate from the liquid to the gas phase, ε = VL/VR is the liquid suspension volume VL to reactor volume VR ratio, a V T i O 2 is the active catalytic surface area per unit of liquid volume: (4) a V Ti O 2 = A Ti O 2 V L = S g C m and a V G - L is the gas–liquid interfacial area per unit of total reactor volume: (5) a V G - L = A G - L V R The symbol Sg denotes the specific surface of the photocatalyst, Cm is the photocatalyst load, A Ti O 2 is the total area of TiO2, and AG-L is the area of the liquid–gas interface (basically the cross section of the cylindrical reactor). The mass balance of the hydrogen in the gas phase under the assumption of perfect mixing reads: (6) 1 - ε d C G , H 2 d t = a V G - L r G - L , H 2 where C G , H 2 is the hydrogen concentration in the gas phase. We express the mass transfer flux through the gas–liquid interface as: (7) r G - L , H 2 = k G - L C L , H 2 - C L , H 2 int = k G - L C L , H 2 - H C G , H 2 where C L , H 2 int is the hypothetical H2 concentration that is in equilibrium with the hydrogen concentration in the gas phase, H is the Henry's law constant, and k G - L is the overall gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient. Substituting Eqs. (1) and (7) into Eqs. (3) and (6), we obtain coupled differential equations: (8) ε C L , H 2 d t = ε β C m I V L n - a V G - L k G - L C L , H 2 - H C G , H 2 (9) 1 - ε d C G , H 2 d t = a V G - L k G - L C L , H 2 - H C G , H 2 where β = Sgα, and I V L is the average radiation intensity in the suspension volume: (10) I V L = 1 V L ∫ 0 R ∫ 0 δ p 2 π r I z , r d z d r = 2 R 2 H L 1 3 c 1 δ p 3 + 1 2 c 2 δ p 2 + c 3 δ p 1 3 c 4 R 3 + 1 2 c 5 R 2 where R and HL are the internal radius of the reactor and the height of the liquid phase, respectively, and δp is the light penetration depth in the photocatalyst suspension. The initial conditions for Eqs. (8) and (9) are C L , H 2 t = 0 = 0 and C G , H 2 t = 0 = 0 respectively. The photonic efficiency for the slurry system is evaluated as the ratio of the H2 reaction rate under kinetic control and the average light intensity in the TiO2 suspension: (11) η = a V Ti O 2 r H 2 V L I V L = β C m I V L n I V L = 1 - ε ε d C G , H 2 d t I V L where the volumetric reaction rate in the numerator can also be equated to the experimentally observed increase in H2 concentration in the gas phase under kinetic control per gas volume by liquid volume ratio I - ε ε ."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Results of photocatalytic tests,"4.1 Results of photocatalytic tests Fig. 2 shows the dependence of hydrogen yields obtained from the methanol/water photocatalytic decomposition (μmol) on time (0–4 h) for different irradiation sources. The curves plotted in Fig. 2 reveal the hydrogen yield strongly depends on the type of the radiation source. The highest hydrogen yields are obtained for the source with the shortest wavelength (λ = 254 nm). However, two different sources with the same wavelength also produce different amounts of hydrogen (Pen-ray and LED lamp at 365 nm). The irradiation by LED lamp leads to hydrogen yields almost 6 times higher than those for the pen-ray lamp. This fact is given by the significantly higher incident radiation flux emitted by the LED lamp. Since the wavelength of 365 nm is closer to visible radiation, we chose this LED lamp for further study. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the hydrogen yields on the irradiation time (0–4 h) at different photocatalyst concentrations. The data plotted in Fig. 3 clearly shows that an optimum photocatalyst concentration exists at which the yields are the largest. In our study, the photocatalyst concentration with the largest yield is 0.25 g/L. Both smaller (0.1 g/L) and larger (0.5 and 1 g/L) concentrations of the photocatalyst lead to smaller hydrogen yields. The smaller yield observed at higher photocatalyst concentrations is probably caused by the light scattering effect. The yield of photocatalytic reactions depends on many factors, such as the chosen photocatalyst, the radiation source characterized by emitting spectrum and light intensity, and the geometry of the photoreactor. The direct comparison of results obtained in various photoreactors is thus problematic and challenging. Because the radiation source and photoreactor design are usually unique parameters of a particular study, it is useful to fix other system parameters such as the photocatalyst composition. For this reason, the choice of a commercial TiO2 P25 photocatalyst is a standard approach [22,30–33]. On top of that, the TiO2 P25 photocatalyst is used as a reference standard in photocatalytic reactions [34–36]. The comparison of experimental results is therefore possible for carefully selected operating conditions. In this paragraph, we compare our results with three other studies published by our group. In these studies, we tested two different pure TiO2 [37,38] and one g-C3N4 [39] photocatalysts in the same photoreactor. The preparation of the TiO2 photocatalysts (in the form of pure anatase) was based on the common sol–gel method followed by calcination (under different conditions). An 8-W Hg UVA lamp (λmax = 365 nm) was used as the source of irradiation. The graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst was prepared by thermal polymerization of dicyandiamide at high temperatures (600 °C). An 8 W Hg lamp (λmax = 254 nm) was used as the irradiation source. The main structural properties of the photocatalyst and the obtained hydrogen yields after 4 h of irradiation are shown in Table 1 . In the case of TiO2 photocatalysts and lamps with a wavelength of 365 nm, the hydrogen yields were 4.9 and 7.2 μmol after 4 h of irradiation (λmax = 365 nm) compared to 5.5 μmol produced by P25. The disadvantage of the commercial photocatalyst P25 is its relatively large band gap and smaller specific surface. On the contrary, since P25 is a mixture of anatase and rutile, it contains heterojunctions facilitating the separation of electrons and holes and thereby reducing the rate of recombination of the generated pairs. The hydrogen yield after 4 h of irradiation (λmax = 254 nm) in the presence of g-C3N4 photocatalyst was 110.5 μmol in comparison with 105.2 μmol in the presence of P25 photocatalyst. As evident from Table 1, the commercial photocatalyst has a surface area twice as large as C3N4. Under the assumption of even irradiation of the photocatalyst surface, the larger is the specific surface of a catalyst, the larger amount of electron-hole pairs generate and participate in photocatalytic reactions. The discussion in this paragraph justifies the use of P25 photocatalysts as a suitable standard for photocatalytic reactions. To show the effect of different radiation sources and other experimental conditions on the photoreaction performance, we also compare our data with those published by other research groups [34–36] using TiO2 P25 photocatalyst (Table 2 ). It is evident that the operation conditions significantly influence photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The hydrogen yields reported in the referenced works [34,35], and [36] were 20, 80, and 40 μmol after 3, 4, and 4 h of irradiation, respectively. Even though we used a lamp with low power, these values are, surprisingly, very similar to the yield obtained here. The power of 8 W is significantly lower than those reported earlier by the other groups (200 W, 1,000 W, and 450 W, respectively). However, the referenced publications do not provide detailed information about the experimental setup (volume, height/radius ratio, source position), and therefore the comparison is rather descriptive."
7,Results of measuring light intensity in the photoreactor,"4.2 Results of measuring light intensity in the photoreactor The results of the irradiation intensity measurements, which served as a basis for further modelling, are shown in Table S1. The data show that photocatalyst concentration in the reaction mixture significantly affects the irradiation intensity, which is utilized for the generation of electron-hole pairs. The amount of generated pairs substantially influences the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Table S1 does not contain the data measured for the photocatalyst concentration of 1 g/L at the height of 1.5 cm and 2 cm because the corresponding light intensities tend to reach zero values. The data measured for the height of 0 cm are identical for all photocatalyst concentrations."
8,Modelling results,"4.3 Modelling results Table 3 gives the values of the determined coefficients for the light intensity model (Eq. 2). To estimate the cn values, we employed the Nelder-Mead algorithm [40], minimizing the penalty function. The penalty function is defined as the sum of the squares of deviations between the experimental values and the predictions by Eq. (2). The light intensity distributions predicted by Eq. (2) and from the radiometer measurements (see Table S1) are shown in Fig. 4 . For the high photocatalyst load in the reactor (1 g/L – Fig. 4a), the light is extinguished within the first centimeter of the reaction mixture due to its high radiation absorption and scattering. At lower photocatalyst loads ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 g/L (Fig. 4b-d), the light distribution becomes more uniform throughout the liquid suspension, and the reaction mixture does not contain any dark zones. The light penetrates the whole liquid phase height, and δp equals HL in Eq.(10) used to calculate the average light intensity in the TiO2 suspension volume. On the contrary, δp is equal to 1 cm for the photocatalyst concentration of 1 g/L. Fig. 5 depicts the calculated average light intensities in the liquid volume (blue diamonds) calculated according to Eq. (10) versus the photocatalyst concentration. The full red line represents a polynomial regression of the second order. The average light intensity in the reactor decreases with increasing photocatalyst concentration. This observation is consistent with pronounced radiation absorption and scattering phenomena in slurry systems with high photocatalyst concentrations, as discussed above. The H2 mass balance equations in gas and liquid phases (Eqs. 8 and 9) were integrated by a standard Matlab solver ode45. The solver ode45 uses an explicit Runge-Kutta one-step method. The relative tolerance of an integration step was set to 10-4. The kinetic parameters β, and n and the mass transfer coefficient k G - L were determined by nonlinear regression. The regression employed the Generalized Reduced Gradient algorithm [41], minimizing the total Root Mean Square Error (RSME) between the experimental values and the predicted ones. Table 4 summarizes the estimated values of the model parameters along with other input model parameters. Fig. 6 shows the measured H2 concentration in the gas phase and the liquid and gas phase H2 concentration predicted by the model. The theoretical and experimental data are in a reasonably good agreement, characterized by a total RSME of 11.49%. The increase in H2 concentration in the gas phase is nonlinear at the beginning of the experiments (approximately during the first hour). However, the initial nonlinear concentration increase is followed by a linear dependence that indicates a zero-order pure kinetic regime. Such a hydrogen concentration–time profile is caused by a delayed H2 transfer to the gas phase and its initial accumulation in the liquid phase, in which the photocatalytic reaction occurs. After the initial one-hour period, the H2 concentration in the liquid suspension reaches almost a constant value which implies the reaction rate becomes equal to the mass transfer rate to the gas phase. As mentioned above, this second period is characterized by a linear increase in the gas H2 concentration, and the reaction system is in a kinetic control regime. The maximum hydrogen yield is found for a TiO2 suspension of 0.25 g/L. The reaction rate decreases for smaller photocatalyst concentrations due to the decrease in the total active area available for the reaction. This reduction in the reaction rate occurs despite the fact the light intensity is better distributed in the reactor volume, and its average value is higher at lower photocatalyst concentrations. The reduction in the reaction rate is also observed at photocatalyst concentrations higher than 0.25 g/L. Under those conditions, dark (non-irradiated) zones with no proceeding reaction exist in the reaction mixture. The possibility of particle agglomeration reducing the surface available for the reaction can also contribute to this effect [42]. The influence of the photocatalyst load on the photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate and the photonic efficiency is shown in Fig. 7 . We evaluate the superficial reaction rate in the active area per reactor volume (the numerator of Eq. 11) from the experimental data obtained in the kinetic control regime (after 1 h of reaction) and teoretically by applying the kinetic model with the estimated parameters shown in Table 2. The theoretical average reaction rate reaches a maximum for a photocatalyst concentration of 0.23 g/L, which is very close to that observed experimentally (0.25 g/L). The photonic efficiency reaches a plateau beyond 0.25 g/L of the photocatalyst. Further increase in the photocatalyst load does not improve the H2 production efficiency through increased use of the energy supply into the TiO2 suspension. The almost constant value of the photonic efficiency for the photocatalyst concentrations larger than 0.25 g/L is given by proportionally the same decrease in the reaction rate (nominator of Eq. 11) and light intensity (denominator of Eq. 11) with increasing photocatalyst concentration. The rate of product formation of photocatalytic reactions is a function of light intensity, photocatalyst loading, and time [25]. In the case of aqueous suspensions, an optimum in the photocatalyst concentration exists at which the efficiency of the irradiation is maximal. In our study, such an optimal photocatalyst concentration determined theoretically and experimentally was 0.23 g/L and 0.25 g/L, respectively. This result is in accord with the findings of other researchers [14,15,28,29]. However, these studies primarily focused on loading distinct types of photocatalysts or different reactions. Marugán et al. [14,15] modeled the kinetics of cyanide photocatalytic oxidation in a slurry reactor and found that the optimal concentration of powdered photocatalyst Aldrich TiO2 was 0.3 g/L. Escobedo et al. [28,29] dealt with the kinetics of hydrogen production using a platinum-modified TiO2 photocatalyst and an organic scavenger (ethanol). They determined the optimal amount of photocatalyst 0.15 g/L. Pure, unmodified, commercial TiO2 photocatalyst (Evonik P25) has not been used for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen with methanol as a sacrificial agent yet. In addition, the present model involves a finite rate of the mass transfer of hydrogen from the liquid phase to the gas phase, which has not been included in the previously proposed models."
9,Conclusions,"We developed a theoretical model of photocatalytic hydrogen generation in an experimental photoreactor. The reaction kinetics involves the photocatalyst load and irradiation profile. The mathematical model considers a finite rate of H2 mass transfer from the aqueous to the gas phase. We validated the model by running an experimental study with a commercially available TiO2 photocatalyst. According to our best knowledge, the significance of hydrogen mass transfer on the photoreactor dynamics has not been previously reported. Based on the analysis of the theoretical predictions and the experimental results, we discussed the effect of photocatalyst loading on the hydrogen yield. Reaching the maximum yield of hydrogen generation requires loading the optimal concentration of a photocatalyst with a sufficiently large active surface and providing uniformly distributed intensive irradiation. The mass transfer limitations occurred at the beginning of the reaction, which manifested itself as a delay in H2 transfer from TiO2 suspension to the gas phase. The comparison of experimental and theoretical efficiencies showed a reasonable agreement. The theoretical average reaction rate reached a maximum for a photocatalyst concentration of 0.23 g/L, very close to the one observed experimentally (0.25 g/L). Interestingly, the photonic efficiency remains constant beyond this optimal catalyst concentration. The results of this investigation deepen the understanding of mass transfer limitations in the photocatalytic production of gases and their effect on the overall performance of photoreactors."
