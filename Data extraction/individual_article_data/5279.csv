0,Introduction,"Environmental concerns caused by the increasing consumption of fossil fuels have been attracting more and more attention, thus it is quiet necessary to establish a large-scale clean and sustainable energy system [1–3]. Photo or electrochemical water splitting is a up-and-coming method for hydrogen (H2) production and the obtained H2 shows the high purity which can be directly used as fuels in fuel cells[4–6]. A typical electrochemical water electrolysis system mainly consists of cathode, anode and electrolyte, and H2 is produced at the cathode through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [7,8]. However, the high external potential caused by the sluggish kinetics of HER in alkaline condition is becoming the bottleneck of HER scaled-up application [9,10]. To address this issue, precious-metal-based electrocatalysts (Pt/C, etc) are widely utilized in the HER, but their commercialization is severely limited by their scarcity and high cost [11–14]. Therefore, it is urgent to exploit efficient, inexpensive, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for HER [15,16]. Transition metal-based nanomaterials, such as metal oxides [11,16,17], hydroxides [18–20], phosphides [21–23], borides [24,25], sulfide [26–28] and nitrides [29–31] have been widely applied as HER electrocatalysts. However, the catalytic activities of the above catalysts are still inferior compared to the noble metals in catalyzing HER [32]. To address these issues, various strategies have been adopted to improve the electrocatalytic water splitting performances of transition metals catalysts. Among these strategies, heterostructured catalysts consist of abundant interfaces between different components have demonstrated extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER, due to double or multiple types of active sites on the surface [33,34]. Furthermore, these heterostructured catalysts each building block is tunable, allowing for the study of a great deal of combinations. For example, to achieve cobalt-based heterostructures of catalysts, Chen and co-workers synthesized three-dimensional crystalline/amorphous Co/Co3O4 nanosheets with heterostructures which exhibited a benchmark HER activities [35]. Luo and co-workers prepared a Co/CoO hybrid efficient electrocatalyst supported on carbon cloth for HER with the overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 68.1 mV dec−1 [15]. Therefore, it is rational to further tune the combinations of cobalt oxides to improve their HER performance. It was reported that CoO and Co3O4 nanoparticles with proper band gap could be regarded as a kind of collaborative complementary materials, which could produce strong electron coupling effect to provide unique properties and advanced functionalities when they are in proper cooperative interaction distance [36,37]. Herein, we reported a facile controllable calcination treatment of a Co3O4 precursor with a reducing atmosphere (H2/Ar) to synthesize heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 nanowire array on Ti mesh (CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti). The reducing process with proper temperature is the key step to prepare nanosized CoO and Co3O4 heterojunction for enhanced HER catalytic activity. The electrode catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with onset overpotential as low as 2.7 mV and needs overpotentials of 108 mV to approach 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Remarkably, it also reveals high catalytical activity and long-time durability for HER both in neutral and near neutral conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium mesh was obtained from Kunshan Guangjiayuan new materials Co. Ltd. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR), acetone (C3H6O, AR), absolute ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2.6H2O), ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and carbamide ((NH2)2CO) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Deionized water (DI water) is obtained from the lab-equipped Elga ultrapure water equipment. Mixed gases of hydrogen and argon (H2/Ar) was obtained from Qingdao Dehai Weiye Technology Co., Ltd. All analytical grade chemicals can be used directly without further purification."
3,Preparation of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti,"2.2 Preparation of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti The titanium meshes were soaked in concentrated hydrochloric acid for 5 min at room temperature. After taking out, they were washed with DI water, acetone/absolute ethanol (1:1) ultrasonically to remove the dust and impurities on the Ti mesh surface, then dried at room temperature and set aside. 1 mmol Co(NO3)2•6H2O (0.873 g), 8 mmol NH4F (0.296 g) and 15 mmol (NH2)2CO (0.901 g) were dissolved in 50 ml DI water with stirring for 25 min. Then, the solution was poured into a 50 ml hydrothermal kettle, and the titanium mesh substrate (2 × 3 cm2) was placed in the kettle at an angle and sealed, and the reaction kettle was placed in an oven at 120 °C for reaction 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturely, the reaction kettle is taken out, and the reacted titanium mesh is placed in DI water and ultrasonically washed for 45 s, and then washed with absolute ethanol and dried to obtain Co-precursor nanorodwire arrays loaded on the Ti mesh (Co-precursor NA/Ti). The exact surface loadings of Co-precursor were calculated to be 0.96 mg cm−2. The Co-precursor NA/Ti was placed in a porcelain boat obliquely, and heated at a rate of 5 °C/min to 250 °C, and then kept at this temperature for 1 h in an air atmosphere in a tube furnace, and cooled naturally to obtain the Co3O4 nanorodwire arrays loaded on the Ti mesh (Co3O4 NA/Ti). The exact surface loadings of Co3O4 were calculated to be 0.93 mg cm−2. The as-prepared Co3O4 NA/Ti was placed in a porcelain boat (slanted, suspended at the bottom), heated in H2/Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C per minute to 350 °C and then kept at this temperature for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 nanowire array on Ti mesh (CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti) was obtained. The exact surface loadings of CoO/Co3O4 were calculated to be 0.92 mg cm−2. In order to investigate the effect of temperature on the morphology and hydrogen evolution performance of the catalysts, the prepared Co3O4 nanowire arrays were placed in a porcelain boat (tilted, with the bottom hanging in the air), and reduced at 250 °C, 300 °C and 400 °C respectively for 2 h in a tube furnace in H2/Ar atmosphere. The samples obtained after natural cooling down are named as R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300 (Co3O4 NA/Ti) and R-Co3O4-400 (Co/CoO NA/Ti), respectively. The exact surface loadings of R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300 (Co3O4 NA/Ti) and R-Co3O4-400 (Co/CoO NA/Ti) were calculated to be 0.96 mg cm−2, 0.91 mg cm−2 and 0.94 mg cm−2, respectively."
4,Preparation of Pt/C electrodes,"2.3 Preparation of Pt/C electrodes 6 mg of Pt/C, 540 μL of deionized water, 540 μL of absolute ethanol and 20 μL of nafion (5 wt%) were mixed, then the resulting mixture was sonicated for 60 min at room temperature to obtain Pt/C ink. Then a pipette was used to draw 2 μL ink each time, which was carefully and evenly dropped onto the Ti mesh and then dried naturally at room temperature. The total ink added was 42 μL, which was dropped in 21 times for the coating. Using this method, Pt/C electrodes was prepared separately. The Pt/C ink loaded on Ti mesh was 0.92 mg cm−2."
5,Material characterization,"2.4 Material characterization The surface morphologies, phase composition, element composition and element content of the as-prepared materials were characterized accordingly. The datailed characterization methods are given in Supporting information."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical measurements for the as-prepared materials were carried out using a CHI-760D electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system, using platinum foil as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode (SCE). Lots of previous work has demonstrated that Pt can be oxidized to Pt2+ during HER with high potentials and large current densities, and then which will be electro-reduced onto the working electrode [38–43]. In order to the rigor of the experiment, graphite was used instead of platinum foil as the counter electrode to prove that the excellent HER activity of the working electrode was independent of Pt electrode. All the measurements were conducted in 1.0 M KOH solution at room temperature. The datailed measurement methods are given in Supporting information."
7,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 presents the synthetic process of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti. To synthesize the heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 nanowire array, the Co-precursor with nanowire array structures on Ti mesh substrate was firstly prepared through a hydrothermal process, and then calcinated in air to generate Co3O4 NA/Ti. Finally, the dark gray CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti with abundant nanosized heterojunctions was obtained via a controllable calcination treatment with a reducing atmosphere (H2/Ar) at 350 °C (Fig. S1). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is employed to investigate the phase composition and crystal structure of the as-prepared products which were previously exfoliated from the substrate to avoid the effect of Ti mesh ( Fig. 2a). These results showed the existence of diffraction peaks of CoO (PDF # 01-1277) and Co3O4 (PDF # 78-1970), thereby indicating the CoO/Co3O4 heterostructures has been successfully generated. It has also been reported that the calcination temperature played a vital role in CoO/Co3O4 formation. The main products obtained at 300 °C for 2 h is Co3O4 and the main products obtained at 400 °C for 2 h is Co/CoO, respectively [15]. The morphologies of the above samples were checked with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2b the smooth surface of the bare Ti mesh was fully covered with nanowires array after hydrothermal process, indicating the successful preparation of precursors. Furthermore, it can be observed that the nanowire structure on Ti mesh was largely kept during the calcination process (Fig. S2). However, a rough surface can be seen after the reduction process for these nanowires compared with the untreated Co3O4 nanowires, which should result from the reduction-decomposition of Co3O4 (Fig. 2b-d). The nanoscale structure and elemental distribution of the heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 nanowire arrays were also characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3a and b depict the TEM images of a single CoO/Co3O4 nanowire, showing a rod-like structure composed of nanoparticles with clear interfaces as labeled by the red dot lines, which is owing to the mismatch of different phases. The high-resolution image of the obtained CoO/Co3O4 in Fig. 3c presents the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.212 nm and 0.245 nm, agreeing with the d-spacing for the (200) plane of CoO and the (311) plane of Co3O4, respectively. Both the (200) facet of CoO and the adjacent (311) plane of Co3O4 constitute the interfaces in CoO/Co3O4 heterostructures. The pore structure of CoO/Co3O4 was characterized by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The as-prepared CoO/Co3O4 exhibits the pseudo-type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop in Fig. S3, indicating typical mesoporous materials. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of CoO/Co3O4 is measured to be 88.6 cm2 g−1. The pore-size distribution is mainly centered at 3–7 nm, as shown in the inset in Fig. S3, implying the mesoporous characteristics of the as-prepared CoO/Co3O4. What's more, abundant mesoporous structure will increase the exposed catalytic active sites. TEM image in Fig. 2a shows an individual CoO/Co3O4 nanowire and the mesopores can also be observed, which is in good agreement with the BET result. The alkaline HER involves two steps, i.e., the water dissociation step to produce adsorbed H*, and the generation of H2 via either the Heyrovsky or the Tafel step. According to those two typical mechanisms that the reaction formula of HER in alkaline is: H2O + e─ → H* + OH─ (Volmer step) H2O + e─ + H* → H2 + OH─ (Heyrovsky step) H* + H* → H2 (Tafel step) Heterostructures between CoO and Co3O4 interfaces were observed in the TEM images of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti samples. The HER performance of heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 Na/Ti is better than those of Co-precursor NA/Ti or Co3O4 NA/Ti without heterostructures, which should be contributed to the heterostructures of the active interface of CoO and Co3O4 components which can regulate the electronic structure and create the ""synergistic effect"" to rease the H-binding energy [34,44]. The surface properties of the obtained CoO/Co3O4 nanowire were characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey XPS spectrum (Fig. S4) shows that the strong signals of C, Co and O element, confirming the concerned elements are present in the sample, in which the C element came from the deposition of the atmosphere. The O 1s XPS spectra is shown in Fig. 4a, in which the peak at 529.5 eV can be attributed to the O2- in CoO, and the small shoulder near 531 eV should be from the absorbed water on the CoO surface layer. These results are consistent with previous reports [15,16,45]. Moreover, Fig. 4b displays the Co 2p core-level XPS spectra, which have two typical primary peaks resulted from Co element in CoO: Co 2p1/2 (796.1 eV) and Co 2p3/2 (780.3 eV), indicating the existence of Co2+ species on the surface of CoO/Co3O4. Since Co3O4 can be regarded as a composition of CoO and Co2O3, the reduction mechanism can be illustrated as: Co3+→Co2+ The electrocatalytic performances of Co-precursor NA/Ti, Co3O4 NA/Ti, CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti and commercial Pt/C loaded on Ti mesh were studied in a standard three-electrode system with 1.0 M KOH as electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows the LSV curves with 90% iR-compensation [46,47] of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti, together with those of Co-precursor NA/Ti, Co3O4 NA/Ti and commercial Pt/C/Ti for comparison. The heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 exhibits excellent HER electrocatalytic performances with low overpotentials of about 108, 135.3and 151.8 mV at 10, 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, which are much lower than those of Co-precursor (136 mV @ 10 mA cm−2; 204.4 mV @ 50 mA cm−2 and 257.4 mV @ 100 mA cm−2) and Co3O4 (124 mV @ 10 mA cm−2; 172.5 mV @ 50 mA cm−2 and 225.8 mV @ 100 mA cm−2), suggesting the remarkable H2-evolving efficiency of the heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti (Fig. 5b). Whether it's graphite or platinum as the counter electrode, CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti respectively require the overpotential of 107.5 mV and 108 mV to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which are almost the same, it is obviously that the good HER activity of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti is not contributed by the Pt based materials (Fig. S5). Moreover, the heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti also shows high HER catalytic activity in neutral condition (169.8 mV mV@10 mA cm−2 in PBS solution and 181.9 mV mV@10 mA cm−2 in NaCl solution) as shown in Fig. S6a. What’s more, the overpotential of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti can be more favorable compared to those of other advanced HER catalysts (Table S1). The HER catalytic kinetics was illustrated by the Tafel plots (Fig. 5c), in which CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti displays the smaller Tafel slope (44.6 mV dec−1) than Co3O4 NA/Ti (70.1 mV dec−1), Co-precursor NA/Ti (81.2 mV dec−1), demonstrating that the CoO/Co3O4 heterostructures could activate the HER kinetics. Meantime, CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti displays the smaller Tafel slope in 1.0 M KOH solution (44.6 mV dec−1) than 1.0 M PBS (96.4 mV dec−1), 3 M NaCl solution (107.9 mV dec−1) (Fig. S6b). These results illustrate that the heteroconjuction between CoO and C3O4 facilitates the charge transfer during the catalytic process in 1 M KOH solution, thus enhancing the HER activity dramatically. Fig. 5d illustrates multi-current process of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti, and it can be observed that the potential responses immediately with the changing current density, indicating that the electron transfer rate of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti is very high. The catalytic stability of the electrocatalysts is another vital consideration for HER performance. Fig. 5e shows the chronopotentiometric (CP) results of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti, obtained at 10 mA cm−2 for 40 h in 1.0 M KOH. It was found that CoO/Co3O4 could maintain stable catalytic activity at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 40 h, and the overpotential increased slightly attributed to mild activation of the sample over a long period of time, resulting in faster electron transfer. The CP results of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti at 10 mA cm−2 for 25 h in 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M PBS and 3 M NaCl solution shows in Fig. S6d. It was observed that CoO/Co3O4 NA /Ti could maintain stable catalystic at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 25 h in both alkaline and neutral solutions. 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH solution also illustrates the long-time durability of the heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti (Fig. 5f). What’s more, the samples after long-term stability test were characterized by SEM revealed that the material maintained substantially in the nanowire array shape with almost no change, directly proving the excellent stability of the catalysts (Fig. S7). The superior charge transport capability of the heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti electrode was further proved by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5g shows the corresponding Nyquist plots of diverse samples in 1.0 M KOH, displaying the solution resistance (Rs) and interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the HER process. According to the fitting equivalent circuit model, the charge transfer resistances of Co-precursor NA/Ti, Co3O4 NA/Ti and CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti were derived to be 4.4, 3.6 and 3.1 Ω, respectively. It can be seen that the Rct of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti (3.1 Ω) was significantly lower than both Co-precursor NA/Ti (4.4 Ω) and Co3O4 NA/Ti (3.6 Ω), indicating its faster reaction kinetics. Fig. S6c shows the corresponding Nyquist plots of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti in 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M PBS and 3 M NaCl solution, the charge transfer resistances were 3.1, 6.4 and 7.7 Ω, respectively. It was found that the Rct of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti in 1.0 M KOH solution (3.1 Ω) was significantly lower than both 1.0 M PBS solution (6.4 Ω) and 3 M NaCl solution (7.7 Ω), indicating its faster reaction kinetics 1.0 M KOH solution. According to double-layer capacitance (Cdl) can be further evaluated the HER catalytic activity of Co-precursor NA/Ti, Co3O4 NA/Ti and CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti, respectively. Based on the CV curve with different scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV s−1) of each sample was collected as shown in Fig. 5h, the corresponding Cdl of Co-precursor NA/Ti, Co3O4 NA/Ti and CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti were calculated by linear fitting to be 20.93, 30.07, and 85.02 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4i). The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the sample is calculated according to the equation ECSA = Cdl / Cs, where ECSA is proportional to Cdl and Cs is a constant whose value is reported to be 0.040 mF cm−2. It was found that the ECSA values of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti (2125.5) was significantly higher than Co-precursor NA/Ti (523.25) and Co3O4 NA/Ti (751.75). This result fully demonstrates that CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti could expose more catalytical active sites, thus exhibit more excellent catalytic activity for HER. It is proved by SEM image and XRD spectra that the main products of reduction temperature at 250 °C, 300 °C and 400 °C are Co3O4, Co3O4 and Co/CoO, respectively (Fig. S8). In order to explore the effects of reduction temperature on the performance of the catalyst, the catalytical performance of R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300, R-Co3O4-350 (CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti) and R-Co3O4-400 obtained from different reduction temperature of 250, 300, 350 and 400 °C were measured. To obtain the current density of 10 mA cm−2, R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300 and R-Co3O4-400 require the overpotential of 172 mV, 151 mV and 146 mV, respectively, which is much higher than the 108 mV required for R-Co3O4-350 (CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti), it is obviously that CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti exhibits the highest catalytic activity (Fig. S9a). The HER catalytic kinetics was illustrated by the Tafel plots (Fig. S9b), in which R-Co3O4-250 (CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti) displays the smaller Tafel slope (44.6 mV dec−1) than R-Co3O4-250 (104.2 mV dec−1), R-Co3O4-300(86.7 mV dec−1) and R-Co3O4-400 (65.8 mV dec−1), demonstrating that the CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti could activate the HER kinetics. NA/Ti electrode was further proved by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. S9c shows the corresponding Nyquist plots of R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300, R-Co3O4-350 (CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti) and R-Co3O4-400 in 1.0 M KOH, displaying the solution resistance (Rs) and interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the HER process. It can be seen that the Rct of CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti (3.1 Ω) was significantly lower than R-Co3O4-250 (6.7 Ω), R-Co3O4-300 (4.3 Ω) and R-Co3O4-400 (3.5 Ω), indicating its faster reaction kinetics. Based on the CV curves of each sample were collected, the corresponding Cdl of R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300, R-Co3O4-350 (CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti) and R-Co3O4-400 were calculated by linear fitting to be 11.65, 25.53, 49.30 and 85.02 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4i). It was found that the ECSA values of R-Co3O4-350 (2125.5) is significantly higher than those of R-Co3O4-250 (291.25), R-Co3O4-300 (638.25) and R-Co3O4-400 (1232.5), respectively, indicating that CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti exhibit more excellent catalytic activity for HER (Fig. S9d). On the other hand, the reduction Co3O4 NA/Ti was carried out at 350 °C for 1 h and 3 h, respectively. HER performances of the products obtained with different reduction time are different, and HER performance at 2 h is the best (Fig. S10). Therefore, Co3O4 NA /Ti should be reduced at 350 °C for 2 h to obtain the best HER performance. The higher value of TOF reflects that the catalyst has the better intrinsic activity, indicating that the catalyst has more active sites and better catalytic performance. Impressively, R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300, and R-Co3O4-400 display inferior HER performance compared with CoO/Co3O4. Such a phenomenon results from the lower TOF values of R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300, and R-Co3O4-400 compared with CoO/Co3O4 (Fig. S11), which indicates much lower intrinsic activity per active site in R-Co3O4-250, R-Co3O4-300, and R-Co3O4-400 than that of CoO/Co3O4. XPS characterization of samples subjected to long-term stability tests for HER (Fig. S12) shows that the samples contain mainly Co3+ species and Co2+ substance. Therefore, the above results confirm that the phase and structural conversions where the original CoO or Co3O4 nanowires were converted into Co(OH)2 nanowires occurred after the HER test. The results corresponded with XRD (Fig. S7d) of long-term stability tests for HER."
8,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have developed a heterostructured CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti via a facile controllable calcination treatment of a Co3O4 precursor with a reducing atmosphere (H2/Ar) and applied as efficient electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline condition. This CoO/Co3O4 NA/Ti electrode could be able to catalyze the HER in 1.0 M KOH with onset overpotential as low as 2.7 mV and low overpotential of 108 mV to approach 10 mA cm−2. Remarkably, it also shows high catalytical activity and long-term durability for HER in neutral conditions. This work may inspire the design of other high-performance 3D-nanostuctured HER catalysts with abundant heterojunction interfaces."
