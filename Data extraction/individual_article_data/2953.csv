0,Introduction,"Fuel cells can directly convert chemical energy of fuel into electric energy with high efficiency and low emission [1]. Hydrogen fed fuel cells have been considered as a clean source of energy since ideally the only byproduct is water. Although steam reforming of nonrenewable natural gas is currently used for the commercial production of pure hydrogen, low molecular weight alcohols have been deemed as potential sources [2]. For instance, from thermodynamic point of view, glycerol (byproduct obtained from bio-diesel plants) can be effectively applied for hydrogen production [3–7] due to its unique character of being non-toxic, non-volatile and non-flammable [8,9]. Recent studies have shown that glycerol is effective in producing hydrogen via glycerol aqueous phase reforming (APR) and steam reforming (SR) techniques [10–18]. However, much attention has been drawn on the hydrogen production by SR of glycerol as well as other carbohydrates. SR is usually achieved at high temperature in the presence of a catalyst since the overall reaction is strongly endothermic. In contrast, autothermal reforming (ATR) does not require an additional/external heat supply, which is a combination of SR and partial oxidation (POX) reforming. Thus, ATR can be run up autothermally by properly adjusting the reactive conditions [19,20]. In addition, the reactor temperature can be optimized and catalyst deactivation by sintering or carbon deposition is avoided with the process of ATR [21]. Although ATR of methane, methanol and ethanol have been extensively investigated [22–27], there are few reports about the thermodynamics of ATR of glycerol in gaseous phase. Herein, for the first time, we performed thermodynamic analysis of glycerol ATR, where total Gibbs free energy minimization method was adopted to calculate equilibrium compositions. Atmospheric pressure was employed in this study since high pressures do not favor glycerol reforming [5,7]. Further, the effects of various parameters [temperature, steam to glycerol ratio (S/G), and oxygen to glycerol ratio (O/G)] and the carbon formation were systematically investigated. Optimal values of S/G and O/G for thermoneutral and efficient processes were also calculated under different temperatures. Finally, products distributions at thermoneutral conditions were examined."
1,Glycerol autothermal reforming,The reactions of ATR of glycerol can be expressed as follows. The overall reaction of glycerol SR: (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O ↔ 3 CO 2 + 7 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 127.67 kJ / mol Glycerol oxidation: (2) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 0.5 O 2 ↔ 2 CO + CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H 298 K = − 31.79 kJ / mol (3) C 3 H 8 O 3 + O 2 ↔ CO + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H 298 K = − 314.76 kJ / mol (4) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 1.5 O 2 ↔ 3 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H 298 K = − 597.73 kJ / mol (5) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3.5 O 2 ↔ 3 CO 2 + 4 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 1564.93 kJ / mol Other possible reactions are shown as follows: Methanation: (6) CO+3H 2 ↔ CH 4 +H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 206 .11 kJ / mol (7) CO 2 +4H 2 ↔ CH 4 +2H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 164 .94 kJ / mol Methane CO2 reforming: (8) CO 2 +CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 +2CO Δ H 298 K = 247 .28 kJ / mol Water gas shift (WGS): (9) CO+H 2 O ↔ H 2 +CO 2 Δ H 298 K = − 41 .17 kJ / mol Carbon formation: (10) H 2 +CO ↔ C+H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 131 .26 kJ / mol (11) CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 +C Δ H 298 K = 74 .85 kJ / mol (12) 2 CO ↔ CO 2 +C Δ H 298 K = − 172 .43 kJ / mol The overall reaction of ATR can be expressed as Eq. (13) as a combination of SR and POX. The stoichiometric coefficients depend on the temperature of reforming reaction [28]. (13) C 3 H 8 O 3 +aO 2 +bH 2 O ↔ cCO+dCO 2 +eH 2 +fCH 4
2,Methodology,"The total Gibbs function for a system is given as follows: (14) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G ¯ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ ¯ i = ∑ n i G i 0 + R T ∑ n i ln f ˆ i f i 0 For the reaction equilibrium in gas phase, f i ˆ = ϕ i ˆ y i P , f i 0 = P 0 and Δ G 0 = Δ G f i 0 are assumed. The minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system can be expressed as Eq. (15) and Eq. (16), with the Lagrange's undetermined multiplier method. (15) Δ G f i 0 + R T ln ϕ ˆ i y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k = 0 (16) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln ϕ ˆ i y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) = 0 with the constraints of elemental balances: (17) ∑ i = 1 N n i a i k = A k When solid carbon is considered in the system Gibbs-energy of carbon is usually considered as Eq. (18) [29,30]. (18) G ¯ C ( g ) = G ¯ C ( s ) = G C ( s ) ≅ Δ G f C ( s ) 0 = 0 The minimization function of Gibbs-energy as following Eq. (19) is obtained by substituting Eq. (14) by Eq. (15) for gaseous species and by Eq. (18) for solid species. (19) ∑ i = 1 N − 1 n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln ϕ ˆ i y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) + n C Δ G f C ( s ) 0 = 0 The equilibrium calculations were carried out with CHEMCAD version 5. Gibbs reactor in this software is commonly used to calculate production compositions and the heat of overall reaction in a reaction system under the conditions of minimization of Gibbs free energy. The equation of state used for fugacity in the calculation was the Soave–Redlich–Kwong method [22]. Hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, water, glycerol, oxygen and carbon were considered as the possible species in ATR of glycerol. The initial amount of glycerol was assumed to be 1mol. The gasification enthalpy of water and others were not considered. This analysis was carried out over the following variable ranges: temperature of 700–1000K, S/G ratio of 1–12 and O/G ratio of 0.0–3.0."
3,Results and discussion,"Thermodynamic analysis of the effects of process variables (temperature, S/G ratio and O/G ratio) on the production of hydrogen was investigated. For the range of temperature, S/G and O/G examined in this study, the conversion of glycerol and O2 was always 100% in the whole process of ATR. Glycerol ATR can produce H2, CH4, CO, CO2 and C, accompanied by unreacted H2O."
4,Hydrogen production,"4.1 Hydrogen production Fig. 1 shows the amount of hydrogen produced (mol H2/mol glycerol) as a function of S/G ratio and O/G ratio at different temperatures. It can be seen that the number of moles of hydrogen increases with temperature. Specifically, the amount of hydrogen produced at 700K is relatively low compared to that at 900 and 1000K, indicating high temperatures can significantly enhance the capacity of hydrogen production. S/G ratio is the parameter which determines the hydrogen production and the tendency of coke formation under reforming conditions. High S/G favors hydrogen production and similar phenomena were observed previously for ATR of methanol and ethanol [20,23]. It has been shown that the most feasible conditions for hydrogen production by glycerol SR can be achieved with S/G values between 9 and 12 [7], which is similar to ATR of glycerol. Although suitable moles of hydrogen can be obtained under higher S/G and temperature (>900K), the amount of O2 in feed stock is a key issue in the ATR process since it can change the heat of overall reaction and affect the production of hydrogen simultaneously. As also illustrated in Fig. 1, the capacity of hydrogen production is reduced at high O/G ratio, especially at high temperatures and S/G ratios. In general, high temperatures and S/Gs and low O/Gs are appropriate for this process. Moreover, the temperatures of 900–1000K, S/Gs of 9–12, and O/Gs of 0.0–0.4 is preferred for hydrogen production from the ATR of glycerol. ATR is an excellent method because of its ability to achieve thermoneutral or slightly exothermic reaction by adjusting the feed ratios, which can save the effort of heating the reactor. The further optimum conditions for hydrogen production will be discussed later in terms of energy integration."
5,Carbon monoxide production,"4.2 Carbon monoxide production Formation of CO can damage the anode of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The ATR operation might give a possibility for the reduction of CO content in the reformer effluent. Therefore, the inhibition of CO was also ascertained. Fig. 2 depicts the amount of CO produced per mole of glycerol as a function of S/G and O/G at different temperatures. At temperatures of 700–900K, the maximum CO produced is obtained at S/G=1 with O/G between 0.6 and 1.8, whereas at 1000K CO production is maximized at S/G=1 and O/G=0. By comparing the results in Fig. 2 (a–d), it can be concluded that low temperatures inhibit CO production significantly. However, since the amount of hydrogen production can be reduced at low temperatures, moderate high temperatures are preferred even a small amount of CO will be produced. Therefore, an effective process for CO removal is needed for further application in fuel cell. It also indicates that high S/G and O/G disfavor the production of CO."
6,Methane production,"4.3 Methane production For hydrogen production, it is apparent that CH4 is not a desirable product since the formation of CH4 competes with H2 production. Fortunately, the number of moles of CH4 decreases as the temperature increases (see Fig. 3 ). CH4 production is thermodynamically inhibited at the optimal conditions for hydrogen production (i.e. at 900 and 1000K). As can be seen from Fig. 3, both high S/G and O/G are favorable to eliminate the formation of CH4. However, almost no CH4 is produced with S/G>7, O/G>2.2 at 900K and with S/G>6, O/G>1.2 at 1000K."
7,Carbon deposition,"4.4 Carbon deposition Carbon formation is of importance in reforming hydrocarbon and oxygenates feed stock during the process of producing hydrogen. High temperatures associated with SR to produce hydrogen also favor the formation of carbon [20]. Carbon is an undesirable product in glycerol reforming process, because the existence of carbon can deactivate the catalysts, especially when crude glycerol was used as a reactant [13,14]. ATR could reduce the stringent coke-formation boundary in SR. Carbon formation can come from reactions (10)–(12), which are easily affected by operational parameters as elucidated by Fig. 4 , due to their relatively lower equilibrium constants [23]. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that Eq. (12) [namely the Boudouard reaction] is predominant below 915K, whereas the decomposition of methane becomes predominant above 915K. Fig. 5 implicates the number of moles of carbon produced per mole of glycerol as a function of S/G and O/G at different temperatures, which provides useful information about the inhibition of carbon. High temperatures favor the inhibition of carbon deposition. It can be seen from Fig. 5d, no carbon formation takes place in the entire considered ranges of S/G and O/G at 1000K. For different temperatures studied in this work, low water and O2 contents in the feed stock tend to result in more coking. Hydrogen production can be maximized at temperature of 900K, while carbon can be produced only when O/G<0.4 (S/G=1) and O/G=0 (S/G=2). From a thermodynamic point of view, carbon deposition can be entirely eliminated and the influence of carbon formation on hydrogen production can be ignored at optimal conditions."
8,Thermoneutral conditions,"4.5 Thermoneutral conditions As discussed above, temperatures of 900–1000K, S/Gs of 9–12, and O/Gs of 0.0–0.4 could be feasible for the hydrogen production. However, it would be more helpful if we can address the issue of heat duty under the operational conditions. As indicated from Fig. 1c and d, the maximum hydrogen produced from ATR of glycerol is always obtained at S/G=12. The heat of overall reaction was calculated at 900 and 1000K with S/G=12 and optimal O/G to achieve thermoneutral conditions was determined. As can be seen in Fig. 6 , the increase in O/G can change the overall reaction from endothermic to exothermic. At 900K, about 0.36 of O/G is feasible to obtain thermoneutral conditions with the S/G values between 9 and 12, whereas at 1000K, the O/G is 0.38–0.39. Product distributions at thermoneutral conditions (900 and 1000K with S/G=12 and optimal O/Gs) are shown and compared with SR at the same conditions in Fig. 7 . The maximum amount of hydrogen produced at thermoneutral conditions are 5.62 and 5.43 at 900 and 1000K, respectively. Although less amount of hydrogen is generated in ATR of glycerol in comparison with SR; the heat integration of ATR makes it more attractive and competitive. Thus, it is certain that ATR of glycerol could be a new route for hydrogen production from renewable source."
9,Conclusions,"With the increasing production of biodiesel, glycerol has become a potential renewable source for hydrogen production. Autothermal reforming offers many advantages, from a technical and economic point of view, since it minimizes the heat load demand in reforming process. In this work, thermodynamic features of glycerol autothermal reforming was studied with the method of Gibbs free energy minimization for hydrogen production. Glycerol can be converted into a mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane as well as solid carbon via autothermal reforming. This thermodynamic analysis was performed over the following variable ranges: temperatures of 700–1000K, steam to glycerol ratio of 1–12 and oxygen to glycerol ratio of 0.0–3.0. Results show that high temperatures, high steam to glycerol ratios and low oxygen to glycerol ratios are feasible for this process. Temperatures of 900–1000K, steam to glycerol ratios of 9–12 and oxygen to glycerol ratios of 0.0–0.4 are preferred for hydrogen production. Thermoneutral conditions under steam to glycerol ratio 9–12 can be achieved with oxygen to glycerol ratios of around 0.36 at 900K and 0.38–0.39 at 1000K, respectively. Maximum number of moles of hydrogen produced at thermoneutral conditions are 5.62 (900K and steam to glycerol ratio of 12) and 5.43 (1000K and steam to glycerol ratio of 12). Under these optimum conditions, methane and carbon formation can be eliminated to neglectable level. Autothermal reforming of glycerol is feasible and further investigation through experimental work would be greatly helpful in understanding this process."
