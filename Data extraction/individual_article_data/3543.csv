0,Introduction,"In case of the fossil energy shortage recently, the hydrogen will become the most potential energy carrier for its renewable and environmental-friendly characteristics. It is one of effective approaches to produce the hydrogen through photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant from the industrial waste water. It was reported that noble metal supported on the TiO2 as photocatalytic material degraded alcohol, formic acid, formaldehyde and oxalic acid to produce hydrogen under ultraviolet and xenon lamp irradiations [1–3]. To enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production and overcome the photocorrosion of bulk CdS, some papers reported the embedded CdS nanoparticles inside TiO2 gel for generation of hydrogen from an EDTA aqueous solution [4], grown CdS particles inside zeolite-A and LZ-Y52 cavities for production of hydrogen from an aqueous solution containing Na2S/Na2SO3 electron donor [5] and assembled CdS within titanosilicate zeolite ETS-4 as the photocatalyst for H2 evolution in the presence of Na2S/Na2SO3/NaOH sacrificial donors under visible light irradiation [6]. In this paper, we employ sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) in cheap as aluminum source to synthesize the aluminum-substituted mesoporous silica (Al-HMS) molecular sieve, and firstly assemble the CdS nanoclusters inside the channels of Al-HMS via the sequential reactions of ion exchange and sulfurization reactions. In order to explore the application of new nanocomposites in applied surface science, the CdS/Al-HMS nanocomposites and Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS composites are firstly employed as photocatalysts for production of hydrogen by photocatalytic degradation of formic acid under visible light irradiation to our knowledge. The purpose of the study attempts to achieve the dual goals for degradation of formic acid with simultaneous production of hydrogen in the photocatalytic process."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of CdS/Al-HMS composite,"2.1 Synthesis of CdS/Al-HMS composite The Al-HMS molecular sieve was synthesized as described in the literature [7]. One gram of Al-HMS was added into an aqueous solution of 0.1M NH4NO3 (30mL) (99.9%, Aldrich) and refluxed at 100°C for 5h to carry out ion exchange of Na+ with NH4 +. After filtrated and washed [8], the filter cake was added to a solution of 0.1M CdCl2 (30mL) (99%, Aldrich) and stirred at 40°C for 2h. The resultant was filtrated and washed extensively with deionized water until the filtrate free of Cd2+. The filtrate cake was added to 0.1M of thiourea (30mL) (99%, Aldrich) and stirred at 70°C for 2h. After filtrated and washed and dried, the sample was designated as CdS/Al-HMS."
3,Preparation of Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS composite,"2.2 Preparation of Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS composite A series of composites, Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS, were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the CdS/Al-HMS with solutions of RuCl3·xH2O (99.99%, Alfa) in a mixture of benzene and ethanol (4:1, v/v) and the samples were reduced in H2 at 300°C for 2h [9]. In correspondence to noble metal loading, the composites were designated as 0.07Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.16Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.21Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.34Ru/CdS/Al-HMS and 1.0Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, respectively."
4,Characterization of nanocomposite,2.3 Characterization of nanocomposite The low angle XRD patterns were measured on an X’pert MPD Pro X-ray diffractometer. Diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectra were recorded on a HITACHI UV-4100 spectrophotometer. Elemental Analysis was obtained on a Bruker S4 PIONEER X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The fluorescence emission spectra were determined with F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer and a 150W xenon lamp was used as excitation light source with an excitation wavelength of 320nm. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image was performed on a JEM-2010 instrument.
5,Photocatalytic H2 production by degradation of formic acid,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production by degradation of formic acid Typically, 0.2g of composite was suspended in 200mL of aqueous formic acid solution (H2O:HCOOH=4:1, v/v) in a Pyrex flask with a flat window. A 350W xenon lamp equipped with a special cutoff filter to remove ultraviolet illumination was used as the light source. The gas products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Beifen SP-2100) equipped with a TDX01 column and a thermal conductivity detector [10]. The apparent quantum yield was measured using a band-pass filter to obtain the incident visible light (λ =420±5nm) and calculated adopting a reported methods [11]."
6,Results and discussion,"Table 1 summarizes the results of X-ray fluorescence analysis. It is found that the Al-HMS is composed of different weight percentages of Na, Al, Si and O elements. For the CdS/Al-HMS composite, the Na+ ions can be completely replaced by Cd2+ ions and the sample contains 1.95wt% Cd and 0.52wt% S, and the total loading approaches 2.5wt% CdS with an atom ratio of 1. Fig. 1 shows the low angle XRD patterns. It can be observed from Fig. 1a that the Al-HMS displays a strongly broad diffraction peak at 2θ =2.43° corresponding to the (100) plane, which is in agreement with the typical aluminum-substituted mesoporous wormhole structure [7,12]. The CdS/Al-HMS shows a medium strongly broad diffraction peak at 2θ =2.38° in Fig. 1b. The decrease of diffraction peak intensity of (100) plane for CdS/Al-HMS should be attributed to the decrease of the diffraction contrast between the pores and the walls as a result of partial mesopores filled with CdS nanoparticles, suggesting that the average size of the CdS nanoparticles is close to the pore diameter of wormhole-like mesoporous structure. The diffraction peak of (100) plane is slightly observed at lower Ru loading and is hardly seen at higher Ru loading as shown in Fig. 1c and d. The high resolution TEM images are displayed in Fig. 2 . The Al-HMS sample shows a wormhole-like mesoporous framework with average porous diameter about 2–3nm in Fig. 2a. It can be found from Fig. 2b that the morphology feature of CdS/Al-HMS nanocomposite is similar to that of Fig. 2a, suggesting that the particle size of cadmium sulfide embedded within the channels of Al-HMS on the verge of channel width of mesoporous Al-HMS does not significantly affect the wormhole-like mesoporous framework of Al-HMS. Hirai et al. reported that the CdS at low loading levels as extremely small particles were incorporated within the mesoporous silica [13]. The diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectra of samples show in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the Al-HMS does not show any absorption band in Fig. 3h. The absorption edge of CdS/Al-HMS is about 503nm in Fig. 3g and it is blue-shifted about 75nm in relation to that of 578nm for the bulk CdS in Fig. 4f resulting from the quantum size effect of CdS nanoparticles incorporated in the channels of Al-HMS. The location of CdS nanoparticles inside zeolite hosts was confirmed by the blue-shifted phenomenon of diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectra [14]. The absorption edges of CdS/Al-HMS supported Ru are gradually blue-shifted from 516nm to 467nm and the toes of absorption bands are simultaneously uplifted with increase of ruthenium loading as shown from Fig. 3a–e. The fluorescence emission spectra of the samples excited by an excitation wavelength of 320nm are shown in Fig. 4. The bulk CdS displays two photoluminescence peaks, a strong one at 538nm and a small one around 452nm in Fig. 4a. The CdS/Al-HMS shows a strong photoluminescence peak at 498nm and a small shoulder peak at 468nm in Fig. 4b. It can be observed that the strong peak is blue-shifted about 40nm compared to bulk CdS, probably ascribing to the quantum size effect of CdS nanoparticles. The size dependence of the trapped fluorescence arising from the surface states was reported by Chen et al. [15]. For the samples of CdS/Al-HMS supported ruthenium, the peak position is same as that of Fig. 4b nothing but the decreases of intensities in Fig. 4c and d. Fig. 5 shows the photocatalytic H2 evolution by degradation of formic acid under visible light irradiation. It is known that the activity of hydrogen production significantly depends on the quantity of active species CdS in the photocatalysis. Even though the content of CdS for the bulk CdS sample is as 40 fold as that of CdS/Al-HMS sample in the process of activity evaluation, the CdS/Al-HMS sample exhibits higher activities of H2 production in Fig. 5f than that of bulk CdS in Fig. 5g. It should be considered that the trait of wormhole-like structure provides the uniform dispersions for the CdS nanoparticles inside the channels of Al-HMS, and also the aluminum silicate framework serves as matrix and stabilizes the embedded CdS nanoparticles under ambient conditions. It was reported that the high H2 evolution rate under ultraviolet irradiation was attributed to the smaller particles of the CdS clusters encapsulated in the cage of type A and LZ-Y52 zeolites [5]. The 0.07Ru/CdS/Al-HMS sample exhibits the highest H2 evolution activity at a rate of 3.7mLh−1 with the apparent quantum yield of 1.2% at 420nm in Fig. 5a. However, the amount of H2 production is dramatically reduced with the increase of Ru loading from Fig. 5b–e. A series of CdS/Al-HMS supported Ru show much higher H2 evolution activities than that of CdS/Al-HMS due to the Schottky barrier generated on the interface between CdS nanoparticles and Ru clusters. The photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CdS nanoparticles can spontaneously transfer to the surface of Ru clusters because the ruthenium possesses a higher work function and a lower Fermi energy level than that of n-type CdS nano-semiconductor. The ruthenium acts as an electron trap which can fleetly obtained photogenerated electrons and subsequently transfers electrons to H+ ions from the ionization of formic acid (2H+ +2e→H2) so that the activity of H2 evolution can be improved. However, activities of H2 evolution are sharply reduced with the increase of loaded Ru, implying that Ru clusters supported on the surface of CdS nanoparticles are partially hampered the absorption of CdS nanoparticles for visible light so as to reduce the photoluminescence intensity in Fig. 4d."
7,Conclusion,A set of Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS photocatalytic composites were prepared. The low angle XRD patterns showed that the CdS nanoparticles were embedded inside the matrix of Al-HMS. The adsorption edge of CdS/Al-HMS is blue-shifted about 75nm in relation to bulk CdS due to the quantum size effect. The Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS composite showed higher H2 evolution activities by degradation of formic acid under visible light irradiation because the Ru clusters possesses a higher work function and a lower Fermi energy level to promote the electron transport of photogenerated electrons and improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge-carriers.
