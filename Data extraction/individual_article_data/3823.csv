0,Introduction,"Hydrogen-producing bacterium (HPB), one of the fermentation bacteria, catabolizes carbohydrates to volatile fatty acids, alcohols, CO2, and H2 (Xing et al., 2008a). It plays an important role in microbial ecology as its metabolic byproducts can be used by other populations via cross-feeding interaction in natural and engineered environments. The produced hydrogen gas (an intermediate) can also be used as the electron donor for hydrogenotrophic microorganisms. Ethanoligenens harbinense is the representative H2-ethanol co-producing species, which possesses high hydrogen-producing ability and autoaggregation growth. The end-products of this species are ethanol, acetic acid, H2, and CO2 (Xing et al., 2008b). Acetic acid is the preferred precursor for methane formation, and it can be used as a substrate for anaerobic digestion to produce methane (Christy et al., 2014). Acetic acid also can be used as a substrate for microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) to produce bioenergy (bioelectricity, biohydrogen, and biomethane) (Kiely et al., 2011; Lu and Ren, 2016). Acetic acid accumulates during the fermentative hydrogen production process and causes a sharp decrease in the pH value of the culture. Acetic acid accumulation and decreasing pH value are major factors that inhibit this process (Hwang et al., 2004; Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005). The effect of pH on the continuous hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract was reported, and the results demonstrated that hydrogen evolution ceased at a pH value of 3.5 (Antonopoulou et al., 2010). The toxic effects of acetic acid to microorganisms mainly include lowering the intracellular pH of microbial cells and metabolic disturbance by anion accumulation (Trček et al., 2015). Most of the acetic acid is protonated (CH3COOH) when the pH is below its pKa value (4.75). The protonated acetic acid molecules can permeate into the microbial cell simply by passive diffusion and dissociate directly in the microbial cytosol, causing a decrease of intracellular pH and anion accumulation of microbial cells (Trček et al., 2015). Acetic acid inhibitory effect on fermentative hydrogen production has been studied in both pure- and mixed-cultures. Sodium acetate exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the growth and the hydrogen-producing ability of Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 in batch tests as reported in a previous study (Tang et al., 2012). The effect of exogenous acetic acid on fermentative hydrogen production by mixed cultures in batch tests was investigated, and the results showed that substrate degradation efficiency, hydrogen production potential, hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate all trended to decrease with increasing exogenous acetic acid concentration (Wang et al., 2008). The effect of acetic acid on hydrogen yield in continuous-flow reactors was examined. The culture with exogenous acetic acid of 25 mM decreased hydrogen yield by 13%, and the culture with exogenous acetic acid of 60 mM (pH 5.0) decreased H2 production by >93% (Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005). Although these studies have demonstrated that acetic acid inhibits hydrogen production, sufficient information is unavailable on the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic adaptation and tolerance of the HPB against acetic acid stress. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of acetic acid tolerance in Ethanoligenens harbinense YUAN-3 will facilitate the control strategy optimization for ethanol-H2 co-producing process and the development of acetic acid-tolerant strains by metabolic engineering. Proteins are major determinants of physiological processes, their abundances reflect information about the dynamic balance among different physiological processes, since it was difficult to measure protein concentrations at large scales, thereby mRNA concentration was extensively used as main determinant of protein abundances (Lyu et al., 2016; Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). However, growing research has revealed that there was poor correlation coefficient between mRNA and protein expression level under similar conditions (Maier et al., 2009; Taniguchi et al., 2010). Quantitative proteomics has been advanced sufficiently to quantify the absolute abundances of proteins, it has extensively contributed to our understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms on a global level (Bakalarski and Kirkpatrick, 2016; Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). More recently, quantitative proteomics has become a powerful tool in environmental science, such as providing molecular evidence for plant leaf chlorosis in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated environments, evaluating the toxicity health risks of electronic waste on fetal development, and investigating the reduction and resistance mechanisms of microorganism under heavy metal stress (Gang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2019). iTRAQ labeling is an efficient quantitative proteomic technique that employs a set of isobaric isotope tags to label tryptic peptides from different samples (Mertins et al., 2012). The technique has been applied to identify and quantify proteins from multiple samples simultaneously (Bakalarski and Kirkpatrick, 2016). Successful iTRAQ-based proteome profiling in a variety of prokaryotic samples including Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum etc. has suggested that high-throughput proteomics of strain YUAN-3, based on its genome database, is also feasible (Lippolis et al., 2014; Raut et al., 2016). Therefore, in order to investigate the proteomic change of strain YUAN-3 against acetic acid stress, iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach was employed in this study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial growth conditions and acetic acid treatment,"2.1 Bacterial growth conditions and acetic acid treatment Ethanoligenens harbinense strain YUAN-3 was cultivated anaerobically in a modified PYG medium at 35 °C. The PYG medium contained (g·L−1): glucose 10, peptone 4, yeast extract 1, NaCl 4, K2HPO4 1.5, MgCl·6H2O 0.1, L-cysteine 0.24 (2 mM), resazuine; trace elements and vitamins were added as previously described (Zhao et al., 2012). The medium was purged with ultra high-purity N2 (99.999%) before the autoclave. The initial pH of the medium was 7 and the agitation speed was set at 120 rpm. Strain YUAN-3 culture in the logarithmic stage was inoculated into anaerobic bottles which contained 200 mL of the culture medium, at 2% (v/v); exogenous acetic acid was added to the medium with different final concentrations of (0, 10, 20, 30 mM) for the acetic acid effect experiment. Strain YUAN-3 cultures for quantitative proteomic analysis were prepared according to the following steps: 100 mL cultures in the logarithmic stage were collected by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 5 min) at room temperature. The pellets were immediately inoculated to 200 mL fresh medium with different final concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30 mM) of exogenous acetic acid and cultivated for 2 h at 35 °C. Cell cultures were kept in anaerobic conditions during the above procedures, and the cultures cultivated in the medium without acetic acid served as control."
3,Fermentation products and cell dry weight analyses,"2.2 Fermentation products and cell dry weight analyses The gas production rate was measured by using an Aerobic/Anaerobic Respirometer System (Challenge Environmental System, AER-208, Arkansas). H2 and CO2 were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Agilent GC7890a, USA). Volatile fatty acids and alcohol were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent GC7890, USA). Acetic acid in fermentation broth was analyzed by gas chromatography, and then the endogenous acetic acid yield was determined by deducting the amount of exogenous acetic acid. Biomass was measured by cell dry weight; cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the cell pellets were washed twice with a PBS buffer, and then dried in an oven at 105 °C to constant weight."
4,Sample preparation and protein extraction,"2.3 Sample preparation and protein extraction Samples for proteomic analysis were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 10,000 ×g, 5 min) and subsequently washed twice with chilled a PBS buffer (NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.7 mM, Na2HPO4 10 mM, KH2PO4 2 mM, pH 7.4, purged with N2 before sterilization). The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after harvest and transferred to −80 °C refrigeration. The cells were homogenized by using the FastPrep-24 instrument with lysing matrix B tubes (MP Biomedical), 40 s, 2 times. The tubes were chilled on ice for 3 min between each cycle. Protein extraction was performed using the phenol extraction method as previously described (Hurkman and Tanaka, 1986)."
5,Sample preparation for iTRAQ analysis,"2.4 Sample preparation for iTRAQ analysis Each biological duplicate sample of 0.75 mg was reconstituted in 150 μL 1 × LDS containing 50 mM DTT and incubated at 90 °C for 10 min. In addition, 10% of each sample was run into SDS-PAGE gel. In-gel tryptic digestion was performed after reduction with 10 mM DTT at 60 °C for 30 min and alkylation with 20 mM IAM at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. Trypsin was added to the samples at 1:50 (w:w, trypsin: sample) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The digested peptides were further extracted from the gel with 60% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid and then extensively dried under a vacuum to remove residual primary amine from reagents. Samples were labeled with iTRAQ 4-plex reagent (ABSciex, MA, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were combined after being labeled and dried."
6,Nano-LC-MS·MS and data analysis,"2.5 Nano-LC-MS·MS and data analysis NanoLC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Dionex RSLC system and interfaced with Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA). The iTRAQ-labeled samples were solubilized in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto a self-packed trap (100 μm × 2 cm) packed with Magic C18AQ, 5 μm and 200 Å (Michrom Bioresources, Inc., Auburn, CA, USA) and then washed for 5 min using buffer A (0.2% formic acid) at a flowrate of 10 μL·min−1. The trap was connected to a homemade analytical column (Magic C18AQ, 3 μm, 200 Å, 75 μm × 50 cm). Peptides were fractionated with a multi-stepped gradient at a flowrate of 300 nL·min−1 using buffer B (0.16% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile): 4–15% buffer B in 25 min, 15–25% buffer B in 65 min, 25–50% buffer B in 55 min. A data-dependent acquisition method was employed to acquire mass spectrometry data. The cyclic series of a full scan was acquired at a resolution of 120,000, and relative collision energy in the HCD cell was set to 30% during the following MS/MS scans. The 20 most intense ions were selected and analyzed in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 30,000 and a dynamic exclusion duration of 30 s. The Nano-LC-MS/MS data from each experiment was searched in MUDPIT style against the E. harbinense YUAN-3 protein database (bacteria.ensembl.org; genome assembly: ASM17811v2) using an in house version of X!Tandem Sledgehammer with carbamidomethylation on cysteine and iTRAQ 4-plex label on lysine as fixed modifications, and with iTRAQ 4-plex label on N-terminus of peptides and oxidation of methionine as variable modification. Tolerance for precursor and product ions were set to ±7 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. Intensity of iTRAQ 4-plex reporter ions of each spectrum was extracted using an in-house Perl script and corrected for isotope cross-over using values supplied by the manufacturer. The ratio between samples was calculated using the reporter ion intensity and normalized to the ratio of summed ion intensity of all identified spectra that fit a certain criteria: the peptide had an iTRAQ 4-plex label, the peptide belonged to E. harbinense YUAN-3 protein database, the peptide log(e) ≤ −2.0 corresponded to an e-value threshold of ≤0.01. Spectra that had the ratio “Divide 0” were replaced with an arbitrary number “10”. Pairwise median ratios of individual proteins were calculated by the “Doby” package under R environment using all spectra belonging to a protein that fit the criteria described above, plus the requirement that the sum of the reporter ion intensity of both channels >20,000."
7,Bioinformatics analysis,"2.6 Bioinformatics analysis Protein with 1.2 fold change and peptide-spectrum matches ≥3 was defined as differentially expressed protein (Li et al., 2018). The differentially expressed proteins were manually annotated according to the NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (nr) database and the UniProt protein database with local BLAST programs (E value ≤1.0E−5). The heatmap of differentially expressed proteins was generated on the R statistical platform (version 3.2.3) through the pheatmap package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pheatmap). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins was carried out via the KOBAS 3.0, and a pathway with uncorrected P-value ≤0.05 was considered significantly enriched (Xie et al., 2011). Prediction of protein subcellular localization was carried out using PSORTb 3.0.2 (Yu et al., 2010)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,End-products and growth of strain YUAN-3 under acetic acid supplement,"3.1 End-products and growth of strain YUAN-3 under acetic acid supplement Acetic acid caused a decrease in pH value of culture. The pH value of PYG medium with 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM acetic acid was 4.99 ± 0.07, 4.50 ± 0.04, and 4.28 ± 0.03 respectively (Supporting information Fig. S1). The maximum gas production rate decreased from 192.15 mL·(L-culture)−1·h−1 to 75.2 mL·(L-culture)−1·h−1 with increasing exogenous acetic acid from 0 mM to 30 mM (Fig. 1A). The batch fermentation period was correspondingly expanded from 66 h to 136 h, because acetic acid also caused a transient gas production inhibition to strain YUAN-3. Gas production arrested for about 10 h and 20 h when exogenous acetic acid was added to the final concentration of 20 mM and 30 mM respectively. The cell dry weight increased in the presence of the acetic acid supplement, and the maximum cell dry weight reached 535 ± 1.5 mg·L−1 in the presence of 10 mM exogenous acetic acid (Fig. 1B). The endogenous acetic acid yield of strain YUAN-3 increased in the presence of exogenous acetic acid, and the maximum yield of endogenous produced acetic acid reached 2683 ± 147 mg·L−1 (44.3 ± 2.4 mM) in the presence of 30 mM exogenous acetic acid (Fig. 1B). Ethanol yields showed no significant change (P > 0.05), which varied from 2728.4 ± 66.3 mg·L−1 to 2875.4 ± 14.4 mg·L−1 in the presence of exogenous acetic acid (Fig. 1B). The maximum gas yield (4281 ± 42.5 mL·L−1) and hydrogen yield (1968 ± 52.2 mL·L−1) were obtained in the PYG medium added to 30 mM exogenous acetic acid, while the minimum gas yield (4004 ± 94.4 mL·L−1) and hydrogen yield (1826 ± 43.0 mL·L−1) were achieved with 10 mM exogenous acetic acid (Fig. 1C). However, the results of one-way ANOVA test revealed that there was also no significant change on the total gas yields and hydrogen yields in the presence of exogenous acetic acid (P > 0.05). As only 10 g·L−1 glucose was added to the PYG medium, the fermentation process ceased, mainly because glucose was exhausted. The above results demonstrate that the exogenous acetic acid mainly slowed down the entire fermentation process of strain YUAN-3."
10,Identification of proteins in iTRAQ analysis,"3.2 Identification of proteins in iTRAQ analysis A total of 1707 proteins were identified, which accounted for 63% of the 2701 predicted proteins in the genome of strain YUAN-3, and 1557 proteins were accurately quantified. A total of 277 proteins were found differentially expressed in the three samples; 78, 121 and 216 differentially expressed proteins were identified in samples with exogenous acetic acid of 10 mM, 20 mM and 30 mM, respectively (Supporting information Table S1-S3). A Venn diagram shows the overlap and the numbers of differentially expressed proteins under different concentrations of acetic acid treatments, and 28 proteins were differentially expressed in all three treatments (Fig. 2 ). Sixty-four proteins were differentially expressed in 20 mM and 30 mM samples, compared to 110 proteins differentially expressed exclusively in the 30 mM sample. According to the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) categorization, the 277 differentially expressed proteins were further categorized into 19 groups (Fig. 3 ). These proteins were mainly distributed in groups such as amino acid transport and metabolism; carbohydrate transport and metabolism; transcription; translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; inorganic ion transport and metabolism; and signal transduction mechanisms. In addition, 60 proteins belonged to the unknown function group, and 16 proteins were found to share no significant similarity with any group."
11,KEGG pathway enrichment and protein subcellular localization analysis,"3.3 KEGG pathway enrichment and protein subcellular localization analysis The clustering analysis facilitates the grouping of proteins based on similar expression profiles. The clustering of the 277 differentially expressed proteins is displayed in a heatmap (Fig. 4 ). Six major clusters were classified and each protein cluster was further analyzed according to KEGG pathway enrichment. As shown in Fig. 4, acetic acid stress caused a dramatic change in the protein expression profile of strain YUAN-3. The result revealed that the up-regulated proteins mainly participated in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, β-alanine and pyrimidine metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism and two-component system. The down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in the phosphotransferase system (PTS), fructose and mannose metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, ribosome, and flagellar assembly. Protein subcellular localization (SCL) is closely associated with functions of protein; computational prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization has become a complementary analysis of high-throughput proteomics experiments. In this study, a protein subcellular localization prediction of the 277 differentially expressed proteins was carried out using PSORTb 3.0.2, and the results are shown in Table 1 . Increasing numbers of proteins located at cytoplasmic were affected by acetic acid stress as the concentration of exogenous acetic acid increased; 48.7% of the differentially expressed proteins in the 10 mM sample were found located at cytoplasmic; however, 57.9% and 60.6% of the differentially expressed proteins in 20 mM and 30 mM samples respectively were located at cytoplasmic. In addition, protein subcellular localization prediction of the differentially expressed proteins in each cluster was performed (Table 1)."
12,Effect of acetic acid on fermentative hydrogen production of strain YUAN-3,"3.4 Effect of acetic acid on fermentative hydrogen production of strain YUAN-3 As mentioned previously, acetic acid decreases the intracellular pH of microbial cells. This is remarkably different from strong acids, which acidify the growth environment but are not efficient in the intracellular acidification of microbial cells as protons diffuse poorly through the cell envelope (Trček et al., 2015). Results of this study show that the pH value dropped to 4.50 ± 0.04 when 20 mM exogenous acetic acid was added to the PYG medium (Supporting information Fig. S1). Therefore, compared with 10 mM acetic acid, theoretically, 20 mM and 30 mM acetic acid would more easily cause intracellular acidification of the strain YUAN-3 cell. The maximum gas production rate decreased by 1.5 times with an increase of exogenous acetic acid from 0 mM to 30 mM, and the batch fermentation period was correspondingly doubled. Moreover, according to the protein subcellular localization prediction of the 277 differentially expressed proteins, we found that increasing percentage of proteins (from 48.7% to 60.6%) which are located at cytoplasmic was affected by acetic acid stress as the concentration of exogenous acetic acid increased (Table 1). This result indicates that intracellular acidification of strain YUAN-3 cells is more easily caused by 20 mM and 30 mM acetic acid compared with 10 mM acetic acid. Intracellular acidification inhibits the activity of glycolytic enzymes and induces the energy deficiency of cells (Pampulha and Loureiro-Dias, 1990). Glycolysis provides pyruvate, which is the key intermediate in fermentative hydrogen production; thus, intracellular acidification will inhibit hydrogen production. Therefore, this is a reason why the hydrogen production rate of strain YUAN-3 declined in the presence of exogenous acetic acid. Furthermore, it is generally considered that intracellular acidification induces the up-regulation of energy consuming defense mechanisms against acetic acid stress (Mira et al., 2010)."
13,Proteins involved in tolerance of acetic acid stress,"3.5 Proteins involved in tolerance of acetic acid stress Intracellular acidification also affects protein stability, structure of nucleic acids, and many other biological molecules (Slonczewski et al., 2009). Previous studies have demonstrated that bacteria have evolved different resistance mechanisms to acetic acid stress, including a strategy that alkalize the environment to suppress the deleterious effects of acetic acid, and strategies that repair DNA and protein damage in general (Liu et al., 2015; Trček et al., 2015). According to the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, we found that proteins involved in β-alanine and pyrimidine metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis were up-regulated (Fig. 4). These proteins include dihydropyrimidinase (DHPase, ADU26722), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, ADU26723, ADU26724) and β-alanine synthase (β-AS, ADU26726) (Fig. 5 ). The reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway enables bacteria to use uracil and thymine as carbon and nitrogen sources, and it degrades uracil into NH3, CO2 and β-alanine. The reactions are catalyzed by DPD, DHPase, and β-AS. β-alanine functions as a substrate for pantothenic acid biosynthesis (Hidese et al., 2011). The final product NH3 will be helpful to maintain cytoplasmic pH through the H+ + NH3 ↔ NH4 + reaction since the cytoplasmic pH of strain YUAN-3 decreased in the presence of acetic acid. Therefore, the up-regulation of these proteins contributes to the suppression of the deleterious effects of acetic acid. To our knowledge, this is the first report that pyrimidine catabolic pathway related proteins may be involved in bacterial acetic acid resistance. Four proteins involved in oxidative stress response were up-regulated, including thioredoxin (ADU25713, ADU26185), peroxiredoxin (ADU25886) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) subunit (ADU26936) (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with several other studies, which indicate that acid stress induces oxidative stress response proteins in Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus plantarum (Heunis et al., 2014; Mols et al., 2010). Thus, our results further reveal the important role of oxidative stress response proteins in bacterial acetic acid resistance. In addition, we also observed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, ADU27040) was up-regulated in the presence of 20 mM acetic acid (Fig. 5). This finding is consistent with other studies, as the protein was up-regulated in some microorganisms under environmental stress conditions (Lee et al., 2008; Prasad et al., 2003). GAPDH is known as a key glycolytic enzyme that catalyses the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to glycerate 1, 3-bisphosphate. Recent studies have found that GAPDH was required for efficient repair of cytotoxic DNA lesions in Escherichia coli (Ferreira et al., 2015). Thus, the up-regulated expression of GAPDH in the presence of 20 mM acetic acid suggests its role in maintaining the structure of DNA during acetic acid stress response."
14,Proteins involved in energy production and growth,"3.6 Proteins involved in energy production and growth Ferredoxin (Fd) is an oxygen-sensitive electron carrier known to be directly associated with hydrogen production in many anaerobic hydrogen-producing organisms; a variety of hydrogenase, including [FeFe]-hydrogenase, bifurcating hydrogenase, and bidirectional [NiFe]-hydrogenase, can be used to oxidize reduced ferredoxin and produce hydrogen (Hallenbeck et al., 2012). In this study, we did not detect that the expression level of hydrogenase (ADU27806) was significantly changed; however, the ferredoxin (ADU27452) of YUAN-3 was down-regulated in the presence of 10 mM and 30 mM exogenous acetic acid (Supporting information Table S1 and Table S3). This result further supports that acetic acid inhibits the hydrogen production rate of YUAN-3 by suppressing ferredoxin (Fig. 1B). According to the iTRAQ analysis, we found that 16 ribosomal proteins and 8 flagella-associated proteins were down-regulated in the presence of exogenous acetic acid (Supporting information Table S4). Ribosome and flagella are essential cellular components of strain YUAN-3 cells. The down-regulated expression levels of these proteins indicate that acetic acid inhibits the growth of strain YUAN-3. Bacterial cell growth and protein synthesis are closely related. Proteins make up about half of the cellular biomass (Klumpp et al., 2013). Protein biosynthesis is by far the largest energy consumer, estimated to account for ∼50% of energy consumption in rapidly growing bacterial cells (Li et al., 2014). Ribosomes serve as the site of protein biosynthesis, and increasing the number of ribosomes benefits protein biosynthesis. Ribosomal proteins account for one-third of the total proteins in rapidly growing bacteria. Both protein biosynthesis and ribosome biosynthesis are energy-intensive processes (Klumpp et al., 2013). Thus, the down-regulated expression levels of ribosomal proteins and flagella-associated proteins suggest the energy production deficiency of the YUAN-3 cell in the presence of exogenous acetic acid."
15,Proteins involved in nutritional assimilation,"3.7 Proteins involved in nutritional assimilation Eleven PTS system (phosphotransferase system) proteins were differentially expressed. 10 of the proteins were down-regulated (Supporting information Table S1-S3). Expression levels of these proteins and the exogenous acetic acid concentrations were tightly coupled. The PTS system is present in all bacterial phyla. It plays a vital role in the uptake of different types of carbohydrates as a carbon source from the environment, and the transport process is driven by translocation of high-energy phosphoryl groups from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the incoming carbohydrate (Galinier and Deutscher, 2017). Besides the control of carbon uptake, previous studies have also reported that the PTS system controls cellular processes such as sensing sugar influx, signaling to the chemotaxis pathway. In addition, it was observed that PTS activity reflects levels of some metabolites, including pyruvate, glycerol, and serine (Somavanshi et al., 2016). Therefore, low expression levels of PTS proteins indicate that acetic acid influences the carbon source uptake and energy state of strain YUAN-3. Phosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient involved in a very large number of cellular functions. Most essential cellular components including nucleic acids, phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides lipids, nucleotide cofactors and phosphorylated proteins contain Pi (Santos-Beneit, 2015). In this study, we identified that phosphate ABC transporter PstA (ADU25833), PstC (ADU25832) and PstS (ADU25831) were down-regulated (Supporting information Fig. S2). Early studies showed that the Pst system is the predominant system for Pi uptake and the most conserved member of the Pho regulon in all bacteria (Hsieh and Wanner, 2010). Thus, the low expression level of the Pst system related proteins suggests that acetic acid inhibits Pi uptake of YUAN-3. Moreover, we also identified that the phosphate regulon sensor histidine kinase PhoR (ADU25837) of YUAN-3 was up-regulated in the medium with added 20 mM or 30 mM acetic acid (Supporting information Fig. S2). This finding is consistent with recent reports that the PhoR gene is up-regulated at lower pH (Marzan and Shimizu, 2011). PhoR is a transmembrane protein involved in the PhoR-PhoB two-component signal transduction systems. It acts as a sensor for the response to Pi concentration both inside and outside of the cell (Västermark and Saier, 2014). The PhoR-PhoB system controls genes in the phosphate regulon, PhoR acting as a kinase for the phosphorylation of PhoB under Pi limitation and acting as a phosphatase for the dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoB under Pi-sufficiency conditions (Santos-Beneit, 2015). There is evidence that the PhoR-PhoB system responds to external acidity and controls the transcription of genes which are important in acid stress tolerance (Marzan and Shimizu, 2011). Thus, the high expression level of PhoR indicates that the acetic acid stress response of YUAN-3 and its phosphate regulation is interconnected."
16,Differentially expressed hypothetical proteins of YUAN-3 in acetic acid stress,"3.8 Differentially expressed hypothetical proteins of YUAN-3 in acetic acid stress Although the genome of strain YUAN-3 has been published, the genome has still not been well annotated so far. All the annotated hypothetical proteins and proteins of unknown function account for 23.7% of the YUAN-3 genome (Hemme et al., 2010). According to COG categorization, we found 60 proteins belonging to the unknown function group. 16 proteins were found to share no significant similarity with any group (Fig. 3). Some of these proteins showed significant changes, such as ADU28111 with 1.41-fold change in the presence of 20 mM acetic acid, ADU28004 with 1.72-fold change in the presence of 20 mM acetic acid, ADU27585 with 0.53-fold change in the presence of 30 mM acetic acid, and ADU27745 with 0.37-fold change in the presence of 30 mM acetic acid (Supporting information Fig. S2). The differentially expressed hypothetical proteins identified in YUAN-3 contribute to our understanding of their functional relationship with phenotypes in acetic acid stress. Further studies should be performed to confirm the biological functions of the differentially expressed hypothetical proteins. Strategies such as gene knockout, gene silencing or gene overexpression can be selected to investigate the biological functions of proteins. Additionally, further work is required to integrate fermentative hydrogen production with acetic acid utilizing microorganisms or processes, which contribute to the relieving of acetic acid inhibitory effect on fermentative hydrogen production. Fermentative hydrogen production can be linked with microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) or electro-fermentation (EF). The hydrogen fermentation effluent is rich in acetic acid and ethanol, so the effluent can be further utilized as a potential feedstock by microorganisms in MECs to generate hydrogen, methane or biohythane. Such kind of integration not only achieve higher biofuel yield but also improves the substrate conversion efficiency (Bakonyi et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2009). Coupling fermentative hydrogen production to anaerobic digestion (methane production) also help to improve biofuel yield and substrate removal rate. Acetic acid and ethanol can be easily transformed into methane by acetogenic bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens (Siriwongrungson et al., 2007). Therefore, the hydrogen fermentation effluent will be an ideal feedstock of methanogenesis process since acetic acid and ethanol are the major fractions in it."
17,Conclusions,"To conclude, this research has provided global insights into the molecular response to acetic acid in Ethanoligenens harbinense YUAN-3 through the iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach (Fig. 6 ). The fermentation process of strain YUAN-3 was significantly slowed down in the selection stress of exogenous acetic acid. A total of 277 proteins were differentially expressed in acetic acid stress, which were favorable for strain YUAN-3 to maintain a balance between the fermentation process and alleviation of intracellular acidification. The response to acetic acid stress in strain YUAN-3 was a complex process, which involved multiple metabolic pathways. Reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway played an important role in the acetic acid resistance of strain YUAN-3. This study contributes to the control strategy optimization of biological process for organic waste treatments. It also improves our understanding of the metabolic regulation mechanisms in acetate-ethanol fermentative microorganisms."
