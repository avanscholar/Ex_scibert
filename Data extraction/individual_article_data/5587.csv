0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols synthesis from hydrogenation of carbon monoxide has been of interest in recent years due to the increasing concerns for environmental protection and resources utilization. The addition of higher alcohols (C2+ alcohols) to gasoline increases the octane number of the fuel, thereby decreasing toxic exhaust gases, such as CO and NO x [1,2]. Of the several catalytic systems developed for alcohol synthesis [3–8], alkali-promoted molybdenum sulfide catalysts are more attractive because of their high catalytic activity and excellent resistance to deactivation pathways, such as sulfur poisoning and coking [9,10]. These catalytic systems display a high proportion of methanol to C2+ alcohols [11,12]. Previous research shows that the addition of 3d transition metal components improves the activity and selectivity of C2+ alcohols by modifying the structural effects of the alkali-modified molybdenum sulfide catalysts to obtain highly dispersed catalysts [13–15]. Storm [16] and Fujimoto and Oba [17] reported that the incorporation of cobalt to the alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts increased the space time yield (STY) of higher alcohols on Al2O3 and SiO2 supports, respectively. Murchison et al. [18] found that Co-promoted alkali-modified molybdenum sulfide catalysts showed better activity and selectivity towards the formation of higher alcohols, compared to that of Ni. Santiesteban et al. [19] and Bian et al. [20] reported that additions of Co and K to supported Mo catalysts increased both the activity and selectivity of higher alcohols. Xiang et al. [21] tested the catalysts K-Co-β-Mo2C for higher alcohols synthesis and concluded that the Co strongly promoted carbon chain growth, especially for the stage of methanol to ethanol. Activated carbon-supported catalysts hold several advantages, including resistance to acidic or basic media, stability at high temperatures, and an inert graphitic surface [22,23]. Carbon in the form of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is drawing attention as a catalyst support [24]. Similar to activated carbon, MWCNTs provide a relatively inert support and high temperature stability [25]. Their unique characteristics such as, appropriate pore-size distribution favoring maximum metallic dispersion, highly graphitized tube walls, and nano-sized channels make them quite suitable as catalytic supports [26–28]. Eswaramoorthi et al. [29] proved the application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes as efficient support to NiMo catalyst for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation reactions. Tavasoli et al. [30] compared the Co/MWCNTs with Co/Al2O3 for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and concluded that the CO hydrogenation as well as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis rate were greatly improved on MWCNTs-supported catalysts because of the uniform dispersion of metal clusters on the support. Ma et al. [31] claimed that the Co-decorated MWCNTs promoted the enhancement of activity of CO hydrogenation and the improvement of the selectivity of higher alcohol synthesis. In our previous work, the catalyst with Mo loading of 15wt% Mo and K loading of 9wt% supported on MWCNTs showed the highest yields and selectivity towards alcohols, compared to the catalysts with 10 and 20wt% Mo and 3 and 6wt% K [32]. The addition of 3d transition metals, such as Co, to the MWCNTs-supported Mo-K catalysts could enhance the activity and selectivity of higher alcohols, due to their strong abilities of hydrogenation and promotion of carbon chain growth. In the present study, we prepared a series of Co (3, 4.5, and 6wt%)-promoted alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts (9wt% K and 15wt% Mo) supported on MWCNTs by sequential pore volume impregnation. These catalysts were characterized using different techniques in oxidized and sulfided states. The MWCNTs-supported catalyst with 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K (Mo-K/MWCNT) is used as a reference catalyst to distinguish the effects of Co promoter. The effects of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, on the catalytic performance for higher alcohols synthesis were also studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of MWCNTs-supported catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of MWCNTs-supported catalysts MWCNTs (purity>95%) obtained from M. K. Nano, Canada was used as a support for the preparation of the catalysts. Prior to impregnation, the support was treated with 30% HNO3 reflux at 100°C overnight, washed with distilled water several times, and dried at 120°C for 6h. The oxide samples were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method using ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (Sigma–Aldrich), potassium carbonate (Aldrich), and cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Alfa-Aesar) as precursors for Mo, K, and Co, respectively. At the first step, the support was impregnated with an aqueous solution of K2CO3, followed by drying at 120°C for 2h, and stabilized in an argon flow of 50ml/min at 300°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 4h. It was further impregnated with aqueous solutions containing the required amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24, and Co(CH3COO)2 followed by drying at 120°C for 2h and stabilized in an argon flow of 50ml/min at 450°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 12h. The sulfide samples were obtained by heat-treating the oxide precursors in a flow of 10mol % H2S in H2 gas at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min for 4h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The contents of Mo, and Co of the oxide catalysts were determined using a PerkinElmer ELAN 5000 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) instrument. The surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of oxide samples were measured by N2-physisorption at 77K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000. Approximately 0.2g of sample was used for each analysis. The moisture and other adsorbed gases present in the sample were removed before analysis by degassing the sample at 200°C for 2h under 66.7Pa (500mm Hg). The sample was then evacuated at 2.67Pa (20μm Hg) before N2 adsorption. A PerkinElmer thermogravimetric (TG) differential thermal analyzer (DTA) was used to measure weight changes of the sample when heated under a flow of argon (flow rate of 40ml/min) at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis patterns of oxide and sulfide forms of samples were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffraction instrument with nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.1541nm). Each sample was scanned at a rate of 0.05°/s, with 2θ varying from 10° to 80°. In order to obtain the XRD patterns in sulfided form, the catalysts were first sulfided for 6h at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min, using a gaseous mixture containing 10mol % H2S in H2 at a flow rate of 50ml/min. After sulfidation, the catalysts were cooled to room temperature in a flow of He and the sample was transferred to sample holders under protection of He. The morphology of the oxide samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM investigations were carried out using a Philips CM20 (100kV) transmission electron microscope equipped with a NARON energy-dispersive spectrometer with a germanium detector. The inner diameters, wall thicknesses, and length of carbon nanotubes, as well as the sizes of the catalyst particles, were measured by digital micrograph software (version 3.6.5, Gatan Inc.). The oxide samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Phillips SEM-505 scanning electron microscope operating at 300kV in SE display mode. The outer diameter of the nanotubes was measured using Digital micrograph software (version 3.6.5, Gatan Inc.). The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the catalysts were performed in order to study the reducibility of the metal oxides in the catalysts. For each analysis, approximately 0.2g of sample was used, which was first purged in a flow of argon at 170°C to remove traces of water and then cooled to 40°C. The TPR of each sample was performed using a 3.1% H2 in He stream at a flow rate of 30ml/min at atmospheric pressure, using a CHEMBET 3000 TPD-TPR analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, heating at a linearly programmed rate of 10°C/min up to 800°C. Carbon monoxide is used as a probe molecule in order to determine the number of accessible surface metal atoms present on sulfided catalysts. The CO uptake (μmol/g of catalyst) measured from CO chemisorption is equivalent to the number of active metal atoms that are accessible to the reactant molecules. The stoichiometric coefficient (CO to metal ratio) of 1 was used and the extent of reduction was assumed to be 100% in metal dispersion calculations. The carbon monoxide uptake on sulfided catalysts was measured using the Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. Prior to the CO chemisorption measurement, 0.2g of sample was sulfided in situ using 10mol % H2S in H2 at 400°C for 4h. The sample was then evacuated at 120°C until the static pressure remained less than 6.6×10−4 Pa. Chemisorption was performed by passing pulses of CO over the sample to measure the total gas uptake at 35°C. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO is an efficient tool to monitor the changes of Mo-related active species due to Co addition. The sulfided catalysts were subjected to DRIFTS of adsorbed CO in a PerkinElmer Spectrum GX instrument equipped with DTGS detector and a KBr beam splitter. Approximately 10mg of powdered oxide sample was placed in the sample cup inside a Spectrotech diffuse reflectance in situ cell equipped with ZnSe windows and a thermocouple which allows the direct measurement of the sample surface temperature. Spectra for each experiment were averaged over 64 scans in the region 3000–1000cm−1 with a nominal 4cm−1 resolution. Prior to CO adsorption, the catalyst was sulfided using 10mol % H2S in H2 (50ml/min) at 375°C for 4h. After sulfidation, the flow was switched to He (50ml/min) and the temperature was decreased to 30°C and a background spectrum was recorded. CO adsorption was carried out at 30°C by introducing pure CO (30ml/min) into the sample cell for 30min. After adsorption, the system was purged with He (50ml/min) for 30min to remove the physisorbed CO molecules. Then the spectra were collected under He flow. X-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES) at the sulfur L-edge were measured using the variable line spacing plane grating monochromator (VLS PGM) beamline (5.5–250eV) on the 2.9GeV synchrotron light source energy of the Canadian light source (CLS) at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK Canada. The powder samples were pressed on a stainless steel sample holder using a piece of carbon conducting tape and the spectra were recorded. A bright and high monochromatic photon beam is provided by the VLS PGM beam line, which employs three diffraction gratings. The light is directed from the 185mm planar undulator using two horizontal deflecting mirrors and one vertical focusing mirror through the entrance slit and onto the selected grating."
4,Catalytic studies,"2.3 Catalytic studies A single-pass tubular downflow, fixed-bed reactor of 450-mm length and 22-mm inside diameter made of inconel tube was used to perform higher alcohol synthesis reactions (HAS). The reactor was packed with 2g of catalyst diluted with 12ml of 90mesh size silicon carbide and housed in an electric furnace controlled by a temperature controller. The reactor was pressurized to 3.44MPa (500psig) with He and the sulfidation together with the reduction was carried out for 6h at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min using a gas mixture containing 10mol % H2S in H2 and flow rate of 50ml/min. The temperature was then lowered to the reaction temperature, and the system was then pressurized to the reaction conditions. The feed gas mixture CO (45mol %), H2 (45mol %), and Ar (10mol %) was passed through mass flow controllers. The HAS reaction was carried out at steady state under the reaction conditions of 300–340°C, 5.51 (800psig) to 9.65MPa (1400psig), and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 3.6m3 (STP)/h/(kg of catalyst) over a period of 24h. The product gas was cooled to 0°C and separated into gas and liquid phases at the reaction pressure. The CO conversion and other gaseous products were monitored with a time interval of 1h. The liquid products were collected at the end of the reaction and analyzed with a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The volume and weight of liquid products were measured to check the mass balance. The gaseous products were analyzed online on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph through a sampling valve. Using Ar as an internal standard, the CO conversion was calculated and the overall mass balance of the reaction was determined. The experiments were repeated at least twice to check reproducibility and to confirm that the results obtained were within the experimental error of ±2.5%. Mass balance calculations, similar to those proposed by Bahome et al. [33], were used to calculate the %CO conversion, %CO2 produced, product STY, and alcohol selectivity (wt%), and are given as follows: (1) % CO conversion = moles ( C O in − C O out ) × gas contraction moles ( C O in ) where the gas contraction was determined from the Arin/Arout calibration. (2) % C O 2 produced = moles of C O 2 produced moles of CO converted × 100 (3) product STY = wt. of the product produced wt. of cartalyst / h (4) alcohol selectivity ( wt % ) = wt. of the alcohol produced total wt. of the products × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Elemental analysis, and textural characteristics The physico-chemical properties of all the catalysts are displayed in Table 1 . Elemental chemical analysis indicates that most of the Mo, and Co precursors are deposited on the support during the incipient wetness impregnation. The measured compositions are slightly lower compared to targeted compositions, which may result from the hygroscopic nature of precursors. The BET surface area and pore volume of all the catalysts were much lower than the pure support. The BET surface area of Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst was found to be 96m2/g. With the incorporation of 3wt% Co, the surface area decreased to 83m2/g. When the Co loading was increased to 6wt%, the BET surface area further decreased to 72m2/g. This apparently is due to pore blockage of MWCNTs by the Co, Mo and K. 3.1.2 CO chemisorption measurements Table 1 gives the results of CO uptake (μmol/g of catalyst), and % dispersion of metals measured from CO chemisorption of the sulfided catalysts. The CO uptake increased by 54% with the addition of 3wt% Co on the catalyst with 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K supported on the MWCNTs and, hence, it is expected that the addition of promoters will enhance the CO hydrogenation capability of the MWCNTs-supported Mo-K catalysts. The CO uptake value increased from 145 to 190μmol/(g of catalyst) with increased Co loading from 3 to 6wt%. The metal dispersion is high for the catalysts with 4.5wt% Co content. Low dispersion at high Co content of Co-Mo catalysts supported on natural and aluminum-pillared clays was also observed by Moronta et al. [34] using cobalt chloride as a catalytic precursor for Co. This is attributed to the formation of large particles at higher Co loadings. 3.1.3 Thermal analysis The thermogravimetric technique was used to find the stabilization temperature of the impregnated catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1 , all the catalysts exhibited identical profiles for weight loss versus system temperature. The weight loss around 100°C probably resulted from evaporation of moisture. The figure clearly shows that rapid weight loss started below 330°C and continued to a temperature of 500°C; therefore, the stabilization temperature of the dried Co- promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalysts was determined to be 500°C. 3.1.4 Bulk phase identification The XRD patterns of the catalysts in oxidized and sulfided form were measured and shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. The most probable phases in the samples were detected using the JCPDS chemical spectra data bank. The results of the possible crystal phases with their corresponding reflection planes are given in Table 2 . 3.1.4.1 Oxidized form The strong intensity peak at 2θ value of 26.6° and the small asymmetric peak at 43.2° are due to the reflections of graphite phase present in the support [29]. The characteristic reflections correspond to the crystalline structure of MoO3 are observed at 2θ value of 40.2°, and 64.5° [35]. Several kinds of K–Mo–O mixed phases exist in oxidized form of catalysts. The peaks at 2θ values of 19.4°, 28.5°, 29.8°, and 30.9° correspond to the characteristic reflections of K2Mo2O7 phase [36]. Other K–Mo–O phases, such as K2MoO4 (2θ =16.0°), K2Mo7O20 (2θ =23.6°), KMo4O6 (2θ =37.1°, and 46.1°), and K0.33MoO3 (2θ=44.6°) may also exist [37,38]. No peaks related to the Co species are detected from the XRD spectra of the catalysts in the oxide form, indicating good dispersion of those species on the catalyst. 3.1.4.2 Sulfided form The various diffraction peaks observed in the XRD patterns of oxide samples are completely removed after sulfidation, and the new diffraction peaks with less diffraction intensity representing different sulfide species appeared. This confirmed that newly formed active phases during the sulfidation step are well dispersed on the MWCNTs support. The reflections of MoS2 crystallites are observed at 2θ values of 14.6°, 33.4°, 40.9°, and 58.9° [39]. The peaks at 2θ values 30.1°, and 31.5° are due to the characteristic reflections of K–Mo–S species, which represent K2MoS4 [40]. These peaks are related to active sites for higher alcohol synthesis [41]. The peaks at 2θ values of 47.9° and 52.4° are due to the different reflecting planes characteristic of bulk Co9S8 particles [42]. The intensities of these peaks increase at higher Co content (4.5 and 6wt%). 3.1.5 Scanning and transmission electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy is used to identify the growth of MWCNTs. Fig. 4 shows the surface morphology of the grown carbon nanotubes in bundles. The nanotubes are found to be tangled and are clustered with impregnated metal particles. The outside diameter of the MWCNTs clearly shows that the nanotubes are multi-walled and have a structure with several walls of graphitic carbons in concentric circles. The TEM images of Co-promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalysts were recorded and the representative image is shown in Fig. 5 . The TEM images of the catalysts revealed that the catalyst particles are well dispersed inside the tubes and also on the outside of the tube walls. Most of the nano-tube caps are found to be open, resulting from the acid treatment prior to impregnation. After acid treatment, the BET surface area of the MWCNTs increased from 178 to 220m2/g and the pore volume increased from 0.54 to 0.66cm3/g. MWCNTs diameters range from 5 to 12nm, while wall thicknesses range from 3 to 8nm, and tube lengths are between 200 and 400nm. The particle sizes of the metal species that are inside and outside of the tubes are in the range of 3–4nm. 3.1.6 Reducibility studies The TPR studies of K-promoted Mo-based catalysts reveal two main reduction peaks. The low temperature reduction peak appearing around 500°C is attributed to the reduction of octahedral coordinated Mo (Mo6+) species to tetrahedral coordinated Mo (Mo4+) species, and the high temperature peak around 800°C is due to the reduction of Mo4+ species to lower oxidation state [43,44]. The effect of different loadings of Co (3–6wt%) on the reducibility of the MWCNTs-supported 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K catalyst are shown in Fig. 6 . The TPR profiles of the Co-promoted catalysts display similar reduction patterns as that of un-promoted Mo-K catalysts. The first H2 consumption peak is most likely due to the overlap of multiple peaks corresponding to the reduction of MoO3 and Co3O4 species, as these species have the same reduction temperature; the high temperature reduction peak corresponding to the reduction of MoO2 species [45]. Increasing Co content from 3 to 6wt% shifted the low temperature reduction peak from 540 to 525°C and the high temperature reduction peak from 729 to 716°C, suggesting that the Co-promoter facilitates the reduction of Mo species. 3.1.7 DRIFT spectroscopy of adsorbed CO over sulfided catalysts DRIFT spectroscopy of CO adsorbed catalysts was used to study the active species in the sulfide form of the catalysts. The typical CO adsorption DRIFT bands for Co-promoted catalysts with 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K supported on MWCNTs is shown in Fig. 7 . Topsoe et al. [46] concluded that Co or Ni promotion on Mo-based catalysts increased the CO adsorption. From Fig. 7, it was observed that CO adsorption on sulfided Co-promoted catalysts yield different bands, representing promoted and un-promoted MoS2 species. The bands in the range of 1980–1950cm−1 are due to CO adsorbed on four or five coordinated Mo sites [47]. The intensity of these bands is relatively strong on the Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst that was promoted with 3wt% Co. The 3wt% Co-promoted catalyst exhibits another main band at 2078cm−1, which can be assigned to a v(CO) band characteristic of linear stretching of CO adsorbed on Mo2+ species [48]. The characteristic bands representing un-promoted partially reduced Mo5+ species are observed in the range of 2100–2090cm−1 on all the Co-promoted catalysts [49]. The weak CO adsorption bands at around 2057 and 2038cm−1 are observed on the catalyst with 3wt% Co, due to the adsorption of CO on Co-promoted MoS2 sites [47]. When Co loading was increased to 4.5wt% Co, the intensity of bands on the Co-promoted Mo sites increased significantly, and the bands for the promoted MoS2 sites shifted to lower wave numbers. This indicates that Co addition reduces more Mo6+ to a lower oxidation state. The strong CO adsorption band at 2015cm−1 was observed along with shoulder bands at 2020 and 2030cm−1, corresponding to the Mo1+ species observed on the Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst that was promoted with 4.5wt% Co [50]. When Co loading was increased to 6wt%, a strong CO adsorption band was observed at around 1995cm−1, representing more reduced Mo sites (Mo0) along with Mo1+ species [51]. 3.1.8 XANES study The sulfur L-edge spectra were recorded by total electron yield (TEY) and fluorescence modes as a function of photon energy using synchrotron radiation, and the spectra were normalized for the X-ray fluctuation of the synchrotron ring, I o. The spectra recorded in these two modes were found to be very similar, and only the TEY/I o spectra of the catalysts together with the reference substance (CaS) are presented. Fig. 8 compares the XANES spectra of the CaS with Mo-K/MWCNTs, and 4.5wt% Co-Mo-K/MWCNTs catalysts in sulfided form. XANES spectra of all the sulfided catalysts were in comparison with that of the reference material, CaS confirming that sulfidation of catalysts leads to the formation of a metallic sulfide phase."
7,Catalytic studies,"3.2 Catalytic studies The catalyst activity studies towards higher alcohol synthesis reaction were carried out under similar conditions at 320°C, 8.27MPa (1200psig), 3.6m3 (STP)/h/(kg of catalyst) and H2 to CO molar ratio of 1. The catalyst particle size in the range of 147–210μm was selected to eliminate the mass transfer resistances. Fig. 9 gives the results of the %CO conversion as time-on-stream during higher alcohol synthesis reaction over the un-promoted MWCNTs-supported catalysts with 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K, and catalysts with varying loadings of Co (3, 4.5, and 6wt%). Baghalha and Hoseini [52] suggested that the deactivation in sulfided Co-Mo catalysts is due to the loss of sulfur and coke deposition. The presence of a Co–Mo–S phase on the Co-promoted MoS2 catalysts has the ability for better hydrogenation of CO, reducing the deposition of coke. The formation of Co9S8 species decreases the surface area of the active Co–Mo–S species, which results in the higher deactivation behavior during the early stage of reaction [13]. These results, coupled with previous XRD results are consistent with the development of Co9S8 particles. The Co-containing catalysts are quite stable after the first 15h. The catalytic activity and product selectivity data were calculated after an induction period of 15h. 3.2.1 Effect of Co promoter The results in Table 3 show the influence of adding different Co loadings to the Mo-K/MWCNTs sample on the catalytic features for the synthesis of higher alcohols from synthesis gas after an induction period of 15h. In the case of catalysts without Co, the %CO conversion increased from 27% to 35% with the addition of 3wt% Co on the MWCNT-supported 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K catalysts. At the same time, incorporation of a cobalt promoter remarkably increased the STY of total alcohols from 0.131 to 0.176g/g of catalyst/h. Sun et al. [53] explained that one molybdenum atom of every two is substituted by cobalt and the Co atoms located at edge surfaces generate partially promoted Co–Mo–S surface species. The incorporation of Co on edge surfaces on MoS2 increases the number of active sites, thus significantly increasing the activity of the catalyst [54]. The %CO conversion increased to 40% and 44% and the total alcohols STY of 0.198 and 0.207g/(g of catalyst/h) were observed on catalysts with a Co content of 4.5 and 6wt%, respectively. This can be explained from the results obtained from CO chemisorption on sulfided Co-contained catalysts, in which the activity of the catalysts for alcohol formation is in accordance with the increased amount of hydrogen uptake at higher Co loadings. By increasing the Co loadings from 3 to 6wt% on the MWCNTs-supported Mo-K catalyst, the hydrocarbon (HC) formation rate, especially that of methane, increased monotonically from 0.348 to 0.412g/(g of catalyst/h). This is due to the increased availability of metallic sulfide sites, such as MoS2 and Co9S8 that improve the activity for the hydrogenation reaction [13,55]. Carbon dioxide obtained from the water gas shift (WGS) reaction is another important product during the higher alcohol synthesis reaction from synthesis gas. Hou et al. [56] explained that the oxy-sulfide form of partially reduced Mo5+ species are the active sites for the formation of CO2 over sulfided molybdenum-based catalysts. They suggested that the WGS reaction occurs by the oxy-sulfide redox mechanism as explained in Fig. 10 . According to the mechanism, the sulfided form of Mo5+ species reacts with water molecules to form oxy-sulfided Mo5+ species. These species react with CO to produce CO2 and reduce to Mo4+ species with a vacancy and coordinated oxygen, which in turn re-oxidize to Mo5+ upon reaction with H2O to form H2. The DRIFTS of adsorbed CO spectra are consistent with partially reduced Mo5+ species. It was observed from DRIFTS spectroscopy of sulfided catalysts and TPR studies of oxide catalysts that the addition of Co improves the reducibility of Mo-K/MWCNT catalysts, which in turn improves the WGS reaction rate. The amount of CO2 produced (32%) on the Co-promoted catalysts was observed to be higher on the catalyst containing 4.5wt% Co which can be better explained from the XRD results. The intensity of the peaks Co–S species increased when the Co loading was increased from 4.5 to 6wt%, favoring the formation of hydrocarbons at higher Co loadings. The total alcohol selectivity increased from 21% over the un-promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst to 27% on the catalyst with 3wt% Co. The selectivity of methanol decreased monotonically from 12% on the un-promoted catalyst to 6% on the catalyst with 6wt% Co. On the catalyst that was promoted with 4.5wt% Co, the selectivity of total alcohols, ethanol, and higher alcohols (C2+OH) reached a maximum value of 30%, 14%, and 23%, respectively. When the Co loading was increased to 6wt%, the selectivity of total alcohols, ethanol, and higher alcohols were observed at 28%, 13%, and 23%, respectively. This may be attributed to less interaction between sulfided Co species with Mo species at higher Co loadings due to the formation of large particle sized Co9S8 species. From the CO chemisorption results, the percentage dispersion decreased upon increasing Co content from 4.5 to 6wt% due to Co agglomeration. These large particles were responsible for weaker interactions between the promoters and MoS2 and were not favorable to the formation of higher alcohols. Li et al. [13] observed the optimum alcohol selectivity on the activated carbon-supported catalyst with a Co/Mo ratio of 0.5 and concluded that the active Co–Mo–S fraction decreased at higher Co loadings, partly due to the unfavorable formation of Co9S8. The molar ratio of higher alcohols (C2+OH) to methanol (C1OH) is obtained as a function of wt. of Co on the MWCNTs-supported Mo-K catalyst after sulfidation and the molar ratio increased linearly as a function of wt% of Co. From Fig. 11 , the following simulated linear equations were obtained for (5) the %CO conversion and (6) the molar ratio of higher alcohols to methanol as a function of wt% of Co: (5) Y 1 = 2.7124 X + 27.146 R 2 = 0.9955 (6) Y 2 = 0.344 X + 0.444 R 2 = 0.9993 where, X is wt% of Co, Y1 is CO conversion (%), and Y2 is molar ratio of C2+OH/C1OH. 3.2.2 Product distribution and chain propagation The individual distributions of alcohols over the Mo-K/MWCNTs, and 4.5wt% Co-promoted Mo-K/MWCNT catalysts are depicted in Figs. 12 and 13 , as an Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) plot. The ASF distribution can quantitatively be written as follows: Y n = P n−1(1− P), where Y n is the mole fraction of the alcohol with a carbon number of n and P is the chain growth probability factor [34]. The ASF distribution obtained over the un-promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst was linear with a chain growth probability of 0.33. The 4.5wt% Co-promoted catalyst showed large deviations from the ideal ASF distribution for methanol, which deviated lower, and ethanol, which deviated higher. The chain growth probability was calculated to be 0.47 over 4.5wt% Co-promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst, assuming a linear distribution of alcohols. This confirms that the addition of Co promoter to alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts increases the reaction rate towards the formation of higher alcohols, with ethanol as a dominant product, by accelerating the CO insertion mechanism during the C1–C2 homologation step. Fig. 14 represents the molar percentage distribution of alcohols on un-promoted and 4.5wt% Co-promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs-supported 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K catalysts. Methanol (56%), ethanol (24%), propanol (11%), and butanol (6%) are the major products observed over the un-promoted catalyst. When the catalyst was promoted with Co, the methanol molar percentage decreased to 23%, whereas, ethanol molar percentage increased to 47%. Alcohols up to octanol with some traces of nonanol and decanol were detected over Co-promoted Mo-K catalysts. Thus, Co not only promotes the activity and selectivity toward higher alcohols (particularly ethyl alcohol), but also propagates the chain growth mechanism leading to the formation of higher alcohols up to heptanol, with some traces of octanol. 3.2.3 Effect of temperature The 4.5wt% Co -promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalysts was used to study temperature effects in the range of 300–340°C on higher alcohols synthesis. The reactions were performed under similar conditions at 8.27MPa (1200psig) and 33.6m3 (STP)/h/(kg of catalyst) and results are given in Table 4 . The percentage CO conversion and hydrocarbon STY increased monotonically with increasing temperature. Maximum total alcohol space time yields of 0.236g/(g of catalyst/h) was observed at 330°C over the 4.5wt% Co- promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs catalyst. When the temperature was raised beyond 330°C, the maximum yield of alcohol was not consistent with CO conversion due to the high selectivities to hydrocarbon production and WGS reaction. The total alcohols and higher alcohols selectivities increased, reaching maxima of about 34% and 28% at 330°C, at the expense of hydrocarbons selectivity. The methanol selectivity decreased monotonically with increasing temperature. The molar ratio of higher alcohols to methanol increased significantly with increases in temperature, confirming the increased promotional ability of Co towards selective formation of higher alcohols at higher temperatures [57]. 3.2.4 Effect of pressure To investigate pressure effects, reaction pressures were varied in the range of 5.52–9.65MPa (800–1400psig) over 4.5wt% Co catalyst at 320°C and 3.6m3 (STP)/h/(kg of catalyst). Table 5 shows that increasing the pressure results in a monotonic increase in CO conversion, total alcohol formation rate, hydrocarbon formation rate, and WGS reaction rate. The 4.5wt% Co-promoted catalysts exhibit maximum total alcohol STY of 0.219g/(g of catalyst)/h at 9.65MPa. In addition, increasing the pressure increases the selectivity of methanol, higher alcohols, and the molar ratio of higher alcohol to methanol. 3.2.5 Comparison of the activities of sulfided Co-promoted Mo–K/MWCNTs catalysts Table 6 compares the activities of sulfided 4.5wt% Co-promoted, 15wt% Mo, and 9wt% K (catalyst D) supported on MWCNT with those of similar catalysts available in the literature. The catalysts with highest activity from each work were selected for comparison purpose. This data indicate that the sulfided Mo-K catalysts supported on MWCNT perform well compared to those in the literature. Co promotion to alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts improved the activity and selectivity of higher alcohols, especially ethanol due to the enhanced C1 →C2 homologation step of CO insertion mechanism [58]. The presence of alkali reduces the formation of metal sulfide species that are responsible for the hydrogenation ability of alkyl species to form alkanes and increase the active sites for the formation of alcohols [59]. MWCNTs support plays an important role in attaining higher dispersions due to their well-defined hollow interiors and appropriate pore-size distribution that facilitates the uniform distribution of metal species and having limited interactions with the metal species [60]."
8,Conclusions,"Metal dispersion of 39% was observed on the MWCNT-supported 15wt% Mo and 9wt% K catalysts that are promoted with 4.5wt% Co. From the TEM images, it was found that metal species were uniformly distributed inside and outside of the tubes, with particle sizes in the range of 3–4nm. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) tests showed that increasing the amount of Co from 3 to 6wt% decreased the first and second TPR peak temperatures from 540 and 729 to 525 and 716°C, respectively. The highest total alcohol space time yield of 0.207g/(g of catalyst/h) was observed on the catalyst promoted with 6wt% Co, whereas the catalyst with 4.5wt% Co exhibited maximum selectivities of 14% and 23% towards ethyl alcohol and higher alcohols, respectively, at 320°C and 8.3MPa. The molar ratio of higher alcohols to methanol increased significantly with increases in temperature and pressure over the investigate range of 300 to 340°C and 5.52 to 9.65MPa, respectively."
