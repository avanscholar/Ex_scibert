0,Introduction,"Hydrogels, which are composed of three-dimensional hydrophilic networks, can retain large volumes of water. They are considered to be soft materials with the greatest potential [1,2]. Hydrogels have been widely applied in several fields, such as foods [3], tissue engineering [4], wearable devices [5], energy saving [6], drug carriers [7], and wound dressing [8]. However, most traditional hydrogels have poor mechanical properties because of their inherent structural heterogeneity and/or inadequate energy dissipation mechanisms, which seriously limit their commercial and industrial applications [9]. In the preparation of tough hydrogels, great efforts have been made through the introduction of novel structural designs and/or energy dissipation mechanisms [10], such as double-network hydrogels [11], nanocomposite hydrogels [12], and hydrogen-bonded hydrogels [13]. Therefore, the development of hydrogels with strong mechanical properties is crucial. Hydrogels based on natural biopolymer materials, especially polysaccharides, have attracted increasing attention because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and critical biological functionality [14]. One of the main carbohydrates stored in plants, starch has been widely used in the food, paper, and textile industries because of its lower cost and good biocompatibility [15]. Starch is composed of amylose and amylopectin [16]. The typical approaches to the preparation of starch gels include chemical and physical cross-linking. Because of its high cross-linking efficiency, glutaraldehyde has been used extensively as a cross-linker, and this leads to the covalent cross-linking of the starch [17]. Chemical reactions are usually conducted at high temperatures, and this is harmful to human health. Consequently, the preparation of starch gels through physical cross-linking is attractive for food and biomedical applications [18]. Usually, gelatinized starch undergoes approximately 12 h of retrogradation (or recrystallization) at 25 °C or 4 °C to form gels [19]. However, traditional retrogradation takes a long time, and the prepared starch gels have poor mechanical properties. Ethanol is a semi-polar water miscible solvent, which is widely used in DNA extraction [20], preparation of starch nanoparticles [21], and as an antiseptic [22]. Bak et al. prepared collagen microfibers with special physical and mechanical properties using ethanol-based dehydrating conditions. At higher ethanol concentration, the fibers exhibited increased uniformity of surface morphology and increased tensile strength [23]. Addition of the anti-solvent (absolute ethanol) to the starch solution decreases the solvent power. When the concentration of starch exceeds the equilibrium saturation concentration, the starch chain will self-assemble to form micro/nano-particles and precipitate out [21]. When induced by ethanol, debranched waxy corn starch formed a single helical structure [24]. It is hypothesized that ethanol dehydration can increase starch concentration, thereby promoting starch retrogradation and improving the mechanical properties of starch gels. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports about starch gels obtained by soaking starch paste in alcohol. The present study developed a simple rapid method for preparing starch gels via alcohol soaking. A comparison with the traditional starch gel preparation methods indicated that alcohol soaking produced a six-fold reduction in gelation time and four-fold improvement in mechanical strength. The microstructures and physicochemical properties of the starch gels were systematically investigated. This approach is universal; thus, it could be applied to the preparation of other polysaccharide gels."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn starch (approximately 28.0% amylose) was supplied by Zhucheng Xingmao Corn Development Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China). Ethanol was purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). All chemicals were analytical grade. Deionized water was applied to the experiments unless otherwise specified."
3,Preparation of the corn starch gels,"2.2 Preparation of the corn starch gels First, 3 g of corn starch was weighed into a small aluminum box, 25 g of accurately weighed distilled water was added and then gelatinized by using Rapid Visco Analyser (Newport Scientific Pvt. Ltd., Warriewood, Australia). In a 10 mL beaker, 7 mL of gelatinized corn starch paste was injected by syringe. It was then soaked in 50 mL of 30%, 60%, 80%, and 100% alcohol solutions at 4 °C for different periods (2 h, 4 h, and 6 h) to obtain the starch gels. A small beaker filled with starch paste was placed at 4 °C for 12 h as a control sample (i.e., without alcohol soaking). After soaking, the starch gels had an average height of 1.5 cm and an average diameter of 1.7 cm. The size of starch gels depended on the concentration of alcohol solution and the soaking time."
4,Mechanical properties of the corn starch gels,"2.3 Mechanical properties of the corn starch gels A texture profile analysis (TPA) was performed on the obtained starch gels. A texture analyzer (TA.XT plus, Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK) equipped with a P 0.5 (0.5 in. probe was used. The test speed was 1 mm s−1. The compression tests were conducted twice under 75% strains. The hardness (g) and springiness data were recorded."
5,Rheological properties of the corn starch gels,"2.4 Rheological properties of the corn starch gels To determine the rheological behaviors of the alcohol-treated starch gels, the following method was used. Gelatinized corn starch paste was put into a glass plate with a diameter of 7.5 cm and thickness of approximately 2 mm. It was then soaked in 30%, 60%, 80%, and 100% alcohol solutions at 4 °C for different periods (10 min and 20 min) to obtain starch gels. The starch gels were formed by soaking in alcohol for 10 or 20 min because the starch paste was only 2 mm thick. The dynamic rheology of the starch gels at 4 °C was analyzed with a parallel-plate (50 mm diameter) strain-controlled rheometer (MCR102, Anton Paar, Austria) with a 1 mm gap. To record the energy storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″), frequency sweep experiments were performed at 0.1–100 rad/s and 1% strain in the linear viscoelastic region."
6,Differential scanning calorimetry,"2.5 Differential scanning calorimetry The obtained starch gels were vacuum freeze-dried for 48 h and ground into powder in a mortar. The thermal properties of the starch gels were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; Mettler-Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) in accordance with Yang et al. [25]. The gel powders (3.00 mg) were mixed with deionized water (6 μL) and placed in an aluminum pan. The container was sealed and balanced at 25 °C for 8 h. The pan was heated from 25 °C to 125 °C at 10 °C/min so that the presence of any peak residual melting could be recorded. The onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), conclusion temperature (Tc), and enthalpy change (ΔH) were calculated with STARe software (Mettler Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland)."
7,Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance,"2.6 Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance The water distribution of the starch gels was determined by an NMI20-040 V-I low-field (22.4 MHz) 1H NMR analyzer (Suzhou Niumai Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd.). The procedures were modified on the basis of the literature [26]. The starch gels were placed in a cylindrical tube (15 mm diameter). The Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) sequence was used to measure the spin–spin relaxation time (T2). The data were analyzed via MultiExp Inv Analysis software (Suzhou Niumai Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd.)."
8,Scanning electron microscopy,"2.7 Scanning electron microscopy The starch gels were frozen with liquid nitrogen and then freeze-dried. The fractured sections were then gold-sputtered for observation. The morphology of the starch gels was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi Instruments Ltd., Japan)."
9,X-ray diffraction patterns,"2.8 X-ray diffraction patterns The moisture content of the freeze-dried starch gel powders was adjusted to 20% and balanced at room temperature for 24 h. The diffraction patterns of the powders were recorded at a range of 4–40° by an X-ray diffractometer (AxSD8 Advance, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The test was operated at 40 mA and 40 kV and CuKα radiation (K = 1.543). In accordance with the Chang et al. [27], the relative crystallinity was calculated from the proportion of the crystalline area to the whole area."
10,Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,"2.9 Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy The spectra of the starch gel powders were recorded with a Nicolet 6700 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The FTIR spectra of the starch gel powders were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with OMNIC 8.0 rapid-scan software to obtain a single spectrum. The number of scans was 32 at a resolution of 4 cm−1 [28]."
11,Statistical analysis,"2.10 Statistical analysis The data were recorded as average values and standard deviations (N = 3). The data differences were analyzed with Duncan's multiple range tests. SPSS for Windows, Version 16.0 software was used. A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Textural properties of the corn starch gels,"3.1 Textural properties of the corn starch gels Table 1 summarizes the textural characteristics of the starch gels, as determined by TPA. The hardness of the starch gels increased with the longer soaking times and higher alcohol concentrations. The hardness of the alcohol-treated (100%, 6 h) starch gels was nearly four times greater than that of the non-alcohol-treated gels (666.16 g versus 170.21 g). Moreover, the hardness of the starch gel obtained from soaking in 30% alcohol for 2 h was greater than the hydrogel achieved without alcohol soaking. This indicated that the alcohol treatment yielded a gelation time that was at least six times shorter; thus, a rapid gelation process was realized. The springiness of all the starch gels was approximately 1.0, which suggested that they were highly elastic [29]."
14,Rheological properties of the corn starch gels,"3.2 Rheological properties of the corn starch gels The effects of alcohol treatment on the rheological behavior of the starch gels were investigated with a dynamic rheometer. Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the G′ and G″ with the change in the angular frequency of the starch gels. When the frequency increased from 0.1 to 100 rad/s, the G′ and G″ values for all the samples increased. For all the starch gels, the G′ values were greater than the G″ values throughout the frequency range. This suggested that all the samples behaved as elastic gels [30]. Moreover, the G′ and G″ of the resulting starch gels were influenced by the alcohol concentrations and soaking times. For the same soaking time, the G′ increased as the alcohol concentration increased. Similarly, at the same alcohol concentration, the G′ increased when the soaking time increased. When the starch gels were exposed to a high frequency, the starch chains could not immediately undergo self-rearrangement. Thus, the gels exhibited the rigidity of a solid state, and this led to the increase in the G′ and G″ values [4]."
15,Thermal properties of the corn starch gels,"3.3 Thermal properties of the corn starch gels Table 2 shows the effects of the alcohol concentrations and soaking times on the thermal properties of the starch gels. There was no significant difference in the melting temperatures of the alcohol-soaked samples and those of the control. However, all the samples displayed a slight increase in ΔH. The ΔH values reflect the degree of order, that is, the melting enthalpy of the crystals and the double helix structure of starch [31]. The amount of energy required to melt starch depends on the degree of hydrogen bonding [32]. Table 2 shows that with the increase of alcohol concentration and soaking time, the ΔH values increased from 0.88 J/g (the control) to 2.90 J/g (100%, 6 h). This indicated that alcohol soaking resulted in a higher number of crystallites in the starch gel. The reason could be that the alcohol dehydration increased the starch gel concentrations, and this caused more amylopectin branch chains to form crystallites."
16,Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance of the corn starch gels,"3.4 Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance of the corn starch gels Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) has been successfully used to identify the mobility and proportion of water molecules in hydrogels without destroying the sample. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the transverse relaxation time (T2) spectra of the starch gels with and without alcohol soaking. The three peaks indicate the three water clusters in each sample. The peaks were approximately 0.027–17 ms (T2b), 21–600 ms (T21), and 700–10,000 ms (T22). Studies have shown that with shorter relaxation times, less flow water is available, and longer relaxation times result in a more mobile water fraction [33]. Typically, the horizontal axes of the three peaks represent the states of the water in the hydrogels. The peak areas are proportional to the number of stable hydrogen protons. The T2b peak indicates that the water closely related to the starch chains (bound water), T21 indicates the water retained by the gel microstructure (immobilized water), and T22 refers to free water [34]. A low T2 value meant that the water molecules and the starch molecules were tightly bound in the starch paste system, thereby reducing water fluidity [35]. PT2 refers to the T2 peak area proportion. The relaxation time was influenced by the alcohol concentrations and soaking times. This was indicative of the changes in the water–starch interaction. As is indicated in Fig. 2, the T2b and T21 peaks in all the samples moved to the left, the PT2b value increased from 0.034 (30% at 2 h) to 0.082 (100% at 6 h), and the PT21 value decreased from 0.966 (30% at 2 h) to 0.915 (100% at 6 h). Moreover, the T22 peak also moved to the left, and the PT22 value increased from 0 (30% at 2 h) to 0.011 (100% at 4 h). The change in PT2 value indicated that some of the immobilized water became bound water and free water after alcohol soaking. The increase in PT2b indicated that more bound water molecules were closely associated with starch. Similar results have been reported in previous reports [36,37]. The increase in PT22 indicated that a small amount of immobilized water became free water."
17,Water content of the corn starch gels,"3.5 Water content of the corn starch gels The water content of the starch gels was determined by a rapid moisture meter (MA45, Sartorius, Germany). As is indicated in Table 3 , the water content reduced as the alcohol concentrations and soaking times increased, thereby leading to higher starch concentrations in the gels. As is shown in Fig. 2, the reduced water in the starch gels was mainly immobilized water. This increased the chances for starch molecular chain interactions, which promoted the formation of hydrogen bonds and, thus, the enhancement of the mechanical properties of the starch gels (Table 1)."
18,Scanning electron microscopy,"3.6 Scanning electron microscopy Fig. 3 shows the photograph of starch gels obtained by soaking in different concentrations of alcohol for different times. It can be seen from the images that the sizes of starch gels are slightly smaller than that of the control after alcohol soaking. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the internal morphology of the freeze-dried starch gels. The fracture surface of the non-alcohol-treated gels exhibited a loose microstructure. After alcohol soaking, the pore wall structure of the starch gels became densified. The phenomenon might have been caused by the osmotic pressure of the alcohol, and this might have increased the packing density of the starch polymer chains. The starch gel pore walls in Fig. 4C–F were relatively flat and smooth without holes; however, those in Fig. 4G became relatively rough and porous. The reason for the porosity might have been alcohol penetration into the gel network. The vacuum freeze-drying caused the alcohol to volatilize and leave many pores."
19,X-ray diffraction,"3.7 X-ray diffraction Fig. 5 displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the starch gel samples. The hydrogel without alcohol soaking exhibited a single peak at 17–18°. It is the typical diffraction pattern of a B-type structure. In addition, the starch gel had an apparent peak at 20°, which is the typical V-type structure. Therefore, the non-alcohol-treated starch hydrogel exhibited a B + V-type structure. Similarly, the alcohol-treated starch gels had characteristic peaks at 17–18° and 20°, thus indicating a typical B + V-type structure. Therefore, the crystalline type of starch gel did not change after alcohol soaking. The alcohol induced the amylose single helices to form V-type complexes [31]. Chen et al. [38] observed a V-type XRD pattern in regular maize starch after alcoholic–alkaline treatments. The relative crystallinity of the starch gels with and without alcohol soaking was calculated with diffractograms. The crystallinity of the starch gels increased from 3.8% to 8.9% after alcohol soaking, thus indicating the efficacy of alcohol for improving the crystallinity of starch gels. It can be seen from Table 3 that alcohol soaking reduces the water content of starch gels and improves the starch concentration in the gels, thus promoting the retrogradation of side chains of the amylopectins and forming more crystals. This was consistent with the DSC results."
20,FTIR spectra analysis,"3.8 FTIR spectra analysis The structure of starch can be characterized by FTIR. The FTIR spectra of the starch gel samples are shown in Fig. 6 . The peaks in the spectra of the treated starch gels were the same as those in the control. This indicated that the alcohol-treated samples did not produce any new compounds. The band at 2926 cm−1 was attributed to the −CH2 stretching vibration of the glucose unit [39]. The spectra of the starch gels showed the extremely broad band at approximately 3288 cm−1, thereby indicating the presence of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups (OH) [38]. In all the starch gel samples, the appearance of a band around 1644 cm−1 confirmed the existence of bound water in the starch. This corresponded to the bending vibration of water molecules [40]. The positions of some peaks changed when the starch gels were soaked in the alcohol solutions. Fig. 6 shows that the position of the HOH stretching vibration peak in the starch gel after alcohol soaking shifted from 1627 cm−1 to 1644 cm−1, thus indicating the increased bound water content in the starch gels. This was consistent with the LF-NMR results. Lin et al. [41] reported that after treatment with an alcohol–alkali solution, the peak shifted from 1645 cm−1 to approximately 1600 cm−1, thus indicating a lower bound water content in the starch. Moreover, the peak at 3288 cm−1, which was classified as an OH stretch vibration, shifted to a higher wavelength (3312 cm−1). This suggested that the free hydroxyl content in the starch gel had increased."
21,Conclusion,"In the present study, rapid starch gelation (2 h) was achieved by simple alcohol soaking. The starch gel had significantly greater mechanical strength (666.16 g) than the traditional retrograded hydrogel (170.21 g). The XRD analysis showed that the crystallinity of the starch gel increased from 3.8% to 8.9% after alcohol soaking. The DSC revealed that enthalpy increased from 0.88 J/g to 2.90 J/g. The dehydration of ethanol increased the concentration of starch in the gels, thereby promoting the retrogradation of side chains of the amylopectins and forming more crystals. The LF-NMR showed that some of the immobilized water became bound water and free water after alcohol soaking. Therefore, the rapid preparation of starch gels by alcohol soaking can widen their applicability to areas such as food, wound dressings, and wearable devices."
