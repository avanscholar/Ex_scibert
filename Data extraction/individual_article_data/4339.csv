0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is expected to be one of the valuable energy carrier of the future – especially in connection with the fuel cell expanding market – and is an important chemical for many industrial processes, such as ammonia production and refinery [1]. Currently, more than 50 million metric tons H2 per year are produced worldwide, principally from steam reforming of natural gas, coal or crude oil, while only a marginal part is produced by reforming of biofuels and electrolysis [2,3]. Fig. 1 summarizes the expected sustainable evolution in the H2 production technologies. At present, hydrogen production, while is economically still competitive with other existing technologies, it suffers of serious environmental limitations, as it relies on hydrocarbons either as feedstock for thermal catalytic reforming and as energy source (Fig. 1, line 1). The use of finite – not renewable fuel resources, together with growing concern for CO2 release, favors the attention on the possible reforming of a variety of different renewable resources, including second or next generation biomasses (Fig. 1, line 2) [4–8]. The main drawback of the thermal catalytic reforming processes involving aqueous solution of renewable oxygenated compounds is the large amount of heat required for the processes, especially for water vaporization. H2 production will become a fully sustainable process when clean energy sources will be employed, such as solar, wind, tidal or geothermal energy (Fig. 1, line 3) [2,3,9,10]. Various options that employed solar energy for green hydrogen production are under investigation, such as electrolysis of water using photovoltaic electrical energy [9,11], water splitting through thermochemical (in solar concentrators) [12,13], photobiological [14] or photochemical approaches [15] and photoreforming of renewable feedstocks [16,17]. All these technologies are potentially much more sustainable then conventional production techniques since take advantage of an energy contribution that is renewable, reliable and readily exploitable. However, scale up problem and the limitations of day/night cycles and dependence on location, time of day, time of year, and weather conditions must be carefully considered. In this contest, photoreforming is thermodinamically more feasible than water spitting, and its use in biomass-derived substrates processing can simultaneously produce hydrogen and clean wastes from food, wine, or paper industry [18]. In addition, its technological transfer to a device can be easily obtained with a relatively low-tech/low cost approach and therefore it could be a suitable transitional option for small and distributed hydrogen production facilities. Among the many investigated photocatalysts, TiO2 is the most popular one, because it is cheap, widely available and chemically stable [19,20]. The main drawbacks of TiO2 are the fast charge carrier recombination rates and the absorption of UV light only, which constitutes less than 5% of the solar spectrum [21]. Many factors influence of the performances of a photocatalyst, such as band gap, position of valence band and conduction band edges, phase composition, crystallinity and crystallites dimensions, porosity, morphology and exposed crystal facets, decoration with noble metal particles, addition of co-catalysts or photosensitizers, etc. [16,17,22,23]. Parallel to investigation and optimization of TiO2-based materials, many studies are also devoted to develop alternative and more efficient, lower cost photocatalysts that can guarantee high durability and stability against photocorrosion in an aqueous environment [24–26]. In this short review, we summarize the most relevant results reported by our research group in in the field of TiO2-based photocatalysts for the H2 production through photoreforming of ethanol and glycerol, oxygenated compounds that can be easily obtained from second generation biomasses."
1,Substrates for sustainable H2 production through photoreforming,"The H2 production by photoreforming of aqueous solutions containing sacrificial agents has been widely investigated using many renewable oxygenated compounds [17,27]. In particular, alcohols received great attention, also considering that the presence of OH groups in the molecule is essential for the photoreforming process to occur [28]. In general, photocatalytic H2 production is favored by the presence of hydrogen atoms in the α-position with respect to the hydroxyl group [29]. The rate determining steps for photocatalytic H2 production from alcohols are considered to be α-hydrogen dissociation with formation of an aldehyde from a primary alcohols and β-hydride elimination with formation of a ketone from a secondary alcohols [29]. When ethanol is used as sacrificial agent, the photoreforming leads to the production of large quantities of acetaldehyde and of its acetal (1,1-diethoxyethane), together with minor amounts of CO2 and CH4 [28–33]. The suggested reaction pathway for ethanol photoreforming is presented in Fig. 2, part A. Acetaldehyde is produced by oxidation of ethoxide species resulting from dissociative adsorption of ethanol on the surface of TiO2 [34]. The reaction proceeds through decomposition of CH3CHO to CH4 and CO or oxidation to CH3COOH, followed by its decomposition to CH4 and CO2. Complete mineralization of ethanol takes place in a minor extent, considering the very low tendency of acetaldehyde to adsorb on the surface of the photocatalyst that therefore limits its subsequent degradation by reaction with holes. Notably, degradation of CH3CHO is hindered using less intense irradiation, as in the case of simulated sunlight [30,33], suggesting the possibility of selective dehydrogenation of ethanol leading to added-value by-products [17,35]. The reaction pathway involved in glycerol photoreforming (Fig. 2, part B) is much more complicated and a lot of different by-products has been detected in liquid and gas phase [30]. Glycerol can be de-hydrogenated on the primary or on the secondary OH group, leading to 2,3-dihydroxypropanal and 1,3-dihydroxy-2-propanone, respectively. In this last case, further degradation of the skeleton seems difficult and a complicated network of reactions results in the production of substituted 1,4-dioxanes. In the case of dehydrogenation on the primary OH group, degradation of the molecule skeleton passes through oxidation of the aldehydic group and fast carboxylation, resulting in considerable CO2 production. Differently to ethanol photoreforming, complete mineralization of the sacrificial agent is favored by the presence of OH groups also in the by-product molecules, allowing their adsorption of the surface of TiO2 and their reaction with photogenerated holes."
2,TiO2-based photocatalysts for H2 production,"The use of TiO2-based materials for photocatalytic production of H2 and fuels is widely reported in the literature [23,36]. Considering this, in the next section the most relevant results obtained by our research group in the photocatalytic H2 production through photoreforming of aqueous solution containing renewable sacrificial agents (mainly ethanol and glycerol) will be summarized. These results highlight the importance and suggest some open questions of various approaches adopted to improve the performance of TiO2-based photocatalysts, including phase composition and doping of TiO2 phase, morphology and composition of metal nanoparticles used as co-catalysts, control of exposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals and formation of composites with carbon nanomaterials."
3,Cu/TiO2 as promising material for photoreforming of oxygenated compounds,"3.1 Cu/TiO2 as promising material for photoreforming of oxygenated compounds The H2 production by photoreforming of aqueous solutions containing oxygenated compounds has been widely investigated using noble metal nanoparticles as co-catalysts for TiO2-based materials, being Pt and Au the most active metals [37,38]. Metal nanoparticles act not only as catalytic centers for H atoms recombination and H2 desorption but also as electron traps avoiding the undesired e−/h+ recombination [39,40]. As an alternative to costly noble metals, great attention has been devoted to the use of Cu as metallic co-catalyst in photoreforming of oxygenated compounds [36]. In this context, our research group has investigated many aspects of the Cu/TiO2 with the aim to understand which is the effect of morphological and structural parameters on the photocatalytic activity under irradiation with UV–vis and simulated sunlight. The morphology of Cu/TiO2 systems can be carefully controlled by adopting adequate synthetic protocols: co-catalyst has been deposited on the surface of a TiO2 support prepared via sol–gel by impregnation (IMP) or by photodeposition (PD) while a microemulsion approach (ME) has been adopted to prepare Cu@TiO2 materials with a core–shell structure [30,31]. Notably, these materials have comparable phase composition, containing a mixture of anatase (80–90%), brookite (10–20%) and rutile (5–10%), and comparable surface area (60–70m2/g). Under the same reaction conditions and with the same Cu content (2.5wt%), similar H2 production rates were obtained with the PD and ME photocatalysts using ethanol or glycerol as sacrificial agents, while IMP possessed a slightly lower activity ( Fig. 3, part A). XANES/EXAFS analysis of the co-catalyst phase after photocatalytic experiments revealed that copper is deposited as Cu(0) nanoparticles during the photodeposition process [30] while CuO is almost completely reduced to Cu(0) during irradiation of IMP and ME materials [31]. Notably, Cu(0) nanoparticles are easily re-oxidized when the photocatalysts are exposed to air after catalytic tests [30]. These results highlight the central role of Cu(0) as real co-catalyst during operation of the photocatalytic H2 production. Although many studies reported the presence of CuO and/or Cu2O as active co-catalysts [41–44], the oxidation state of Cu assessed by XPS could be affected by re-oxidation of Cu(0) nanoparticles and/or by the difficulty in discriminate the position of Cu 2p3/2 position for Cu2O and Cu [42,45]. HAADF-STEM revealed that the mean particle size of Cu nanoparticles (Fig. 3, part B) is smaller for the samples with the higher activity (2.0 vs 3.7nm) [30,31]. The changes in activity depending on the morphology of the samples has been related with a different extent of the interface between TiO2 and the Cu(0) co-catalyst, being optimized in the ME and PD photocatalysts (Fig. 3, part B). The intimate contract between TiO2 and Cu enhances charge separation and favors mineralization of the organic substrate, improving performance of the materials. Phase composition of the TiO2 support and Cu loading strongly affect the photocatalytic performance of the composite materials, as demonstrated in a series of photocatalysts prepared by photodeposition [30]. Fig. 4 presents the photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous solutions containing ethanol or glycerol under irradiation with UV–vis and simulated sunlight using Cu/TiO2 materials with 1wt% of Cu. The multiphasic support TiO2-SG has been prepared by sol–gel synthesis from isopropoxide (anatase 64wt%, rutile 8wt%, brookite 28wt%, 67m2 g−1) while pure anatase TiO2-PS has been prepared by precipitation of Ti(OH)4 from titanyl sulfate (anatase 100%, 108m2 g−1) [30]. All the supports were calcined in air at 450°C for 6h before photodeposition of Cu from Cu(NO3)2 in MeOH/H2O solution under UV–vis irradiation for 2h [30]. Under UV–vis irradiation (Fig. 4, part A), H2 production by photoreforming of both ethanol and glycerol using Cu/TiO2-SG is higher than that obtained with Cu/TiO2-PS, irrespectively to the metal loading, indicating that multiphasic TiO2 materials present a higher photocatalytic activity than pure anatase [30]. This difference is less important under simulated sunlight when ethanol is used (Fig. 4, part B). Using glycerol as sacrificial agent, a significantly higher activity under simulated sunlight irradiation is observed for Cu/TiO2-SG [30]. The composition of TiO2 influences also the size of Cu nanoparticles formed during photodeposition of the co-catalyst (Fig. 4, part C): EXAFS and HAADF-STEM analysis demonstrate that, increasing the Cu loading from 1.0 to 2.5wt%, the mean crystallite size of Cu nanoparticles is almost unaffected on TiO2-SG while significantly increases in TiO2-PS. Various reports in the literature assess that nanocomposite comprising different TiO2 polymorphs are more active than the single phase materials both in oxidation [46,47] and in reduction [48–50] processes. This is the result of the formation of heterojunctions between the crystallites of the different phases and the capability of photogenerated electrons and holes to transfer from phase to phase. Considering this, electron/hole separation is favored in multiphasic TiO2-SG, leading to a higher number of sites for nucleation of Cu nanoparticles and increasing the rate of H+ reduction to H2 and of oxidation and/or decarboxylation of the molecules of the sacrificial agent. One of the major drawbacks of Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts is the leaching of Cu atoms from the active phase during photoreforming. The photo-leaching of the co-catalyst depends on the nature of the sacrificial agent and on the type of irradiation. During photoreforming of aqueous ethanol solution, the concentration of Cu in solution is negligible under UV–vis irradiation thanks to its fast re-deposition. During experiments with simulated sunlight, a significant leaching of the active phase has been observed, corresponding to the loss of 16% and 9% of copper in Cu/TiO2-SG and Cu/TiO2-PS, respectively [30]. The lower amount of Cu lost by the TiO2-PS photocatalyst could be related with the higher surface area of the support. A possible technological approach to avoid leaching of Cu is the use of gas-phase photoreactors, that demonstrated promising performances in terms of both activity and selectivity of ethanol dehydrogenation [35]."
4,Engineering of exposed facets,"3.2 Engineering of exposed facets The photocatalytic activity of TiO2-based materials strongly depends on the facets exposed by the crystallites of the materials. The most thermodynamically stable facets are exposed by the crystallites in order to minimize surface energy but the possibility to control the synthetic conditions allow the preparation of materials exposing the less stable and more reactive surfaces. Many studies have been performed regarding the control of morphology and of the exposed facets of anatase. The surface energy of exposed facets on anatase decreases in the order {001}>{010}/{100}>{101} [51,52]. The different surface energy of anatase surfaces has been related with the fraction of five-coordinated Ti centers (Ti5c) exposed to the surface, being 100% for {010}/{100} and {100} surfaces while only 50% for the most stable {101} surface [53–55]. The relative ratio of the various facets exposed by anatase can be controlled by the opportune choice of TiO2 precursors and/or by the addition of adequate directing agents, that preferentially adsorb on specific surfaces allowing the growth of the others. Fluorides and chlorides are widely used as directing agents [55–62], since F preferentially adsorbs on {001} and {010} surfaces while Cl adsorbs on {101} surfaces [61]. This fact results in the formation of nanostructures ranging from truncated bipyramids to nanosheets with different extent of the two facets depending on the relative ratio of F and Cl [61,62]. Flourine-free synthesis has been optimized in the last years for the synthesis of TiO2 nanocrystals with different shapes (cuboid, rhombic-shaped crystals, etc.) [53,63–65]. In faceted rutile nanocrystals, the surface energy decreases in the order {001}>{011}>{100}>{110}, as the fraction of unsaturated Ti5c at the surface decreases from 100% in the first to 50% in the last one [66]. In wet chemistry methods, nucleation and growth of rutile is usually favored by acidic conditions and chloride ions are usually adopted to control the morphology and the exposed facets, coming from Cl-containing precursors or added as HCl or NaCl [67–70]. The adsorption of Cl takes place mainly on the {110} facets, limiting their growth [71]. Considering the lower symmetry of its structure, brookite nanocrystals can growth exposing many different facets. Most of the surface is made by {010}, {111}, {210} and reconstructed {001} facets. Brookite nanorods elongated along the c-axis, with longitudinal {210}/{100} and basal {001}/{111}/{212} facets, can be prepared by nonaqueous [72–74] or hydrothermal methods [73,75,76]. Brookite nanosheets [77] or pseudocubic nanocrystals [78] can be prepared adapting the synthetic conditions. Irrespectively from the TiO2 polymorph, photogenerated electrons and holes are accumulated on different exposed facets, reducing their recombination and finally favoring the catalytic reactions taking place on the surface of the material [79]. The accumulation of charges on different facets has been nicely demonstrated through deposition of Pt by photoreduction and of PbO2 by photooxidation [80,81]. Most of the studies on engineered TiO2 nanocrystals relates to the photoinduced mineralization of organic molecules, usually dyes. Only a limited number of paper deals with photocatalytic H2 production. Gordon et al. [62] reported the effect of TiF4/TiCl4 molar ratio and of the co-surfactant employed (1-oleylamine or 1-octadecanol) on the morphology of anatase nanocrystals prepared by a nonaqueous synthesis in 1-octadecene/oleic acid solution, tuning shape of the nanocrystal and relative ratio of {001} and {101} facets. Nanosheets with large predominance of {001} surface has been obtained using TiF4 and 1-octadecanol while fraction of {101} surfaces increases when TiCl4 and 1-oleylamine are used, up to the formation of truncated bipyramidal nanocrystals ( Fig. 5, part A). The photocatalytic H2 evolution under simulated sunlight has been studied after deposition of Pt nanoparticles using methanol as sacrificial agent. The hydrogen evolution increased as the fraction of the {101} increases, with the truncated bipyramids being the most active photocatalyst. Removal of F from the surface by treatment of NaOH results in a significant increase of the H2 production (Fig. 5, part B), suggesting that F hinders methanol adsorption and reaction on the surface on the photoactive material. With the aim to investigate the influence of various synthetic parameters, anatase/brookite nanocomposites have been prepared by hydrothermal treatment of Na titanate precursor changing the titanate-to-water ratio, the heating method and the reaction time [33]. Increasing the titanate-to-water ratio, the TiO2 produced changed from elongated anatase nanocrystals to composites formed by elongated and polyhedral particles. The clear attribution of the polymorph to each type of particles is not easy, considering the strong similarity in their Digital Diffraction Pattern. After photodeposition of Pt nanoparticles, H2 is produced by photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol in aqueous solution. The H2 production rates are strongly influenced by the anatase/brookite ratio and by the morphological changes of the support. When normalized with respect to the surface area (Fig. 5, part C), the H2 productivity of the anatase/brookite composites prepared by hydrothermal synthesis is higher than that obtained using a TiO2 material with comparable phase composition but prepared by sol–gel synthesis followed by calcination [33]. This was reasonably related with the exposure of the more reactive facets in the anatase/brookite composite prepared by hydrothermal treatment of Na titanate."
5,Increasing activity under visible light: self-doping vs surface plasmon resonance in Pt–Au/TiO2 activated by reduction in H2,"3.3 Increasing activity under visible light: self-doping vs surface plasmon resonance in Pt–Au/TiO2 activated by reduction in H2 One of the major problem of TiO2-based photocatalysts is the low photoactivity under visible light, due to the almost null harvesting of photons in the visible range by this semiconductor. Increasing the harvesting of photons above 400nm and improving the performances of TiO2-based materials are fundamental in view of a large scale use of the photocatalytic technologies using Solar irradiation. Many attempts have been done to extend the response of TiO2-based materials to visible light, such as doping with metal and non-metal elements or composite formation (with carbon nanomaterials, quantum dots or a second semiconductor) [82]. After the pivotal work of Chen et al. [83], great attention has been devoted in the last years to “black TiO2” prepared by reduction of TiO2 as an efficient photocatalyst able to harvest the major part of the solar light. Black TiO2 can be prepared using different polymorphs [83–86] and following various reductive treatments, although the easiest is certainly H2 reduction at temperature between 400 and 700°C [83,86,87]. HR-TEM analysis demonstrated that black TiO2 nanoparticles present a nearly stoichiometric, disordered surface while oxygen vacancies are located in the bulk [83,87]. Reduction of TiO2 narrows the band-gap of the photocatalysts by formation of Ti3+ centers associated with oxygen vacancies and by surface disorder [83,87]. The formation of nanocomposites with Au or Ag nanoparticles allows the harvesting of visible photons through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [82]. Various energy-transfer processes have been proposed to explain the improved activity of photocatalysts comprising co-catalysts with SPR effect. Direct Electron Transfer (DET) is realized when of “hot” electrons produced by irradiation of plasmonic metal nanoparticles possess enough energy to overcome the Schottky barrier at the metal/TiO2 interface and are injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor [88,89]. An increase of electron–hole generation rate in the Au/TiO2 composites has been related with Local ElectroMagnetic Field (LEMF) enhancement near the surface of TiO2 [90] or Plasmonic Resonant Energy Transfer (PRET) from metal to semiconductor [91]. The intragap states present in black TiO2 play a key role in promoting both DET and PRET mechanisms, as recently demonstrated by Naldoni et al. [92]. Enhancement by SPR has been adopted in many application fields of photocatalysis [93], including mineralization of organic pollutants and H2 generation. Priebe et al. demonstrated how various parameters affect the performance of plasmonic Au/TiO2 materials in H2 production from aqueous MeOH solution under visible light [94]. Nevertheless, Haro et al. [95] reported that the SPR of Au nanoparticles increase the light absorption of Au/TiO2 photoelectrodes but they act essentially as catalytic centers. In this context, Gallo et al. [96,97] reported the photocatalytic H2 production from ethanol and glycerol using bimetallic Pt–Au/TiO2 materials activated by H2 reduction. The Pt0.5–Au0.5/TiO2 photocatalysts (with 0.5wt% of each metal) activated by H2 reduction at 500°C gave the best performances under irradiation with simulated sunlight using ethanol or glycerol as sacrificial agents, as depicted in Fig. 6, parts A and B, respectively. These studies demonstrate that the high performance of Pt0.5–Au0.5/TiO2 reduced al 500°C is related with: 1. the formation of Ti3+ centers, resulting in band-gap narrowing; 2. the formation of alloyed nanoparticles with mean sizes between 1 and 3nm and optimal composition, both in terms of position of the Fermi level and weakening of adsorption heat of H atoms. The occurrence of SPR in the samples when Au is present, with a relative maximum in the absorption spectra around 550nm, seems to be a limiting factor in the present photocatalysts [97]. Under irradiation with photons in the range of the SPR bands observed in DR-UV/Vis spectra (Fig. 6, part C) using a NaNO2-filtered Hg medium pressure lamp, Pt1/TiO2 reduced at 500°C demonstrated higher H2 production than Pt0.5–Au0.5/TiO2 and Au1/TiO2 materials (Fig. 6, part D). Nevertheless, the presence of Au seems to be beneficial in the oxidation of organic sacrificial agent, resulting in higher CO2 production [96,97]."
6,Formation of composites with carbon nanomaterials,"3.4 Formation of composites with carbon nanomaterials Great attention has also been devoted in the last years to the preparation of composites comprising TiO2 and carbon nanomaterials, mainly carbon nanotubes (CNT) or graphene [98]. Thanks to their high work functions (4.9–5.2eV) [99–101], they can act as electron acceptors from TiO2, favoring charge separation and increasing the photocatalytic activity with respect to TiO2 alone. Moreover, charge can be injected into TiO2 by excitation of CNTs [102] or carbon impurities can forms Ti–O–C entities which generate intra-gap states in TiO2 improving visible light absorption [103]. Composites comprising TiO2 and CNT or graphene has been reported for photocatalytic organic molecule degradation [104–107] and H2 production [108–110]. In this context, Cargnello et al. [108] covered oxidized multiwalled CNTs with Pd@TiO2 and Pt@TiO2 core–shell units prepared following a supramolecular approach. The TiO2 material appeared to be amorphous by XRD, Raman and HR-TEM analysis while metal nanoparticles are not evidenced by EELS mapping, confirming their distribution inside the oxide layer. The obtained materials were tested for the photocatalytic H2 production from methanol/water solutions ( Fig. 7), producing 8–10mmol H2 g− 1 h−1 under UV–vis irradiation. Notably, the production rate obtained with the reference materials without CNTs was around 2.5mmol H2 g−1 h−1. These results demonstrate that the close contact between CNTs and the TiO2-based counterpart is a crucial point in the development of active and stable photocatalysts for H2 production."
7,Conclusions and perspectives,"In this short review, we summarized the major finding of our research group in the H2 production by photocatalytic reforming of aqueous solution containing renewable sacrificial agents, such as ethanol and glycerol, by the use of TiO2-based materials. The photocatalytic activity of Cu/TiO2 materials is strongly influenced by the phase composition of TiO2 and by the morphology of the composite. The formation of Cu(0) nanoparticles during photocatalytic H2 production has been observed in all the materials, being essential for electron trapping, H+ reduction and H2 evolution. The use of multiphasic supports result in higher performance thanks to the better charge separation. The morphology of the photocatalyst can be controlled by adopting adequate synthetic protocols, with the best activity for the materials with small Cu(0) nanoparticles in close contact with TiO2 matrix. These two properties can be achieved by microemulsion synthesis or photodeposition of Cu on TiO2 support. The major drawback of Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts is the leaching of the Cu in the aqueous solution, especially when less intense irradiation are used (such as simulated sunlight). This problem can be solved performing the photodehydrogenation of ethanol in gas phase, although the development of materials with reduced leaching for the process operative in suspension will be a desirable improvement. The control of the preparation condition of TiO2 nanocrystals in order to expose of less thermodynamically stable but more reactive facets is a very promising field in the photocatalysts development. Facets control has been achieved for anatase and rutile by addition of adequate directing agents (fluorides and chlorides are often used). The control of growth of brookite nanocrystals will be an interesting topic, considering the promising performance of this polymorph in H2 production by photoreforming. Moreover, the formation of nanocomposites comprising the nanocrystals with tailored facets could further improve the performance, although characterization of the materials and unequivocal identification of the nanocrystallites by TEM is complicated by the similar digital diffraction patterns of the TiO2 polymorphs. Self-doping of TiO2 by formation of Ti3+ centers and oxygen vacancies has been demonstrated as an efficient way to improve harvesting of visible light and to favor photocatalytic activity. The performance of H2-activated TiO2 materials can be maximized by formation of alloyed metal nanoparticles, as demonstrated by the case of Pt–Au alloyed nanoparticles. The study revealed that, in this case, the Surface Plasmon Resonance of metal nanoparticles is less important than self-doping of TiO2 in harvesting visible light, although the nanoalloyed nature of the metal nanoparticles is fundamental to promote H2 evolution. Formation of nanocomposites comprising TiO2 and carbon nanomaterials strongly improves the performance in photoreforming, thanks to the enhanced electron/hole separation resulting from the contact between the two components. Multiwalled CNTs have been covered by M@TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt) core–shell units, prepared following a self-assembling approach. The photocatalytic H2 production from methanol/water solutions under simulated sunlight irradiation is considerably higher for the composite materials containing the CNTs. Further improvements in the performance of M@TiO2 could be obtained improving harvesting of visible light, by formation of composite with other carbon-based nanomaterials, such as graphene of graphitic carbon nitride."
