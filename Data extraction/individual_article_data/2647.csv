0,Introduction,"Research on the use of electrochemically active bacteria for power generation in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) has gained wide interest in the past five years [1,2]. Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are a variation on the principles of microbial fuel cells such that, with an electrical energy input, substrates are oxidised at the anode (as in MFCs) but the cathodic reaction involves reduction of protons to hydrogen as the cathode chamber is kept anaerobic [3,4]. Microbial electrolysis can thus be seen as a biological analogue of chemical electrolysis. Hydrogen is widely reported to be a significant future energy vector (or carrier) and also as the ultimate non polluting fuel if produced sustainably [5]. This proposition, often called the ‘hydrogen economy’, is driven by the need to reduce the impact of climate change (arising out of increased greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere), need to secure energy supplies, reduce atmospheric pollution and meet the increasing energy demands of an increasing population [6,7]. One of the challenges that must be overcome before the hydrogen economy becomes a reality is that of producing hydrogen efficiently and affordably using clean technologies. Hydrogen production via microbial electrolysis is advantageous as a variety of substrates can be used; the hydrogen yield is potentially high (1 g COD can liberate 1400 ml at 0 °C and 1 atm); the system can be operated effectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and substrates inhibitory or recalcitrant to anaerobic digestion e.g. those with high ammonium can be utilized [8]. Recovery of hydrogen from the cathode should be easier to achieve as the hydrogen simply bubbles out of solution. There should be greater simplicity in cell design and subsequently reduced cost. The simpler design results from the liquid phase operation in MEC cathodes as opposed to the likely gas and liquid (thin film) phase operation of MFC cathodes, with their incumbent oxygen mass transfer limitations. Microbial electrolysis can be used as a second stage process of a fermentative hydrogen reactor to recover more hydrogen from what otherwise would be waste products (volatile fatty acids e.g. acetate and alcohols among others), or used in alternative configurations as presented in Hawkes et al. [9]. Theoretically a hydrogen yield of 12 mol/mol hexose is possible using microbial electrolysis compared to 4 mol/mol hexose using dark fermentation. For thermodynamic reasons a small amount of electrical energy (ca. 120 mV) has to be supplied to drive the reactions that take place in an MEC [10]. To optimise the performance of microbial electrolysis cells the effect of a number of factors needs to be understood, amongst which are catholyte pH and temperature. Previous studies on hydrogen production using microbial electrolysis have mainly been operated as batch processes [11,12] and it has been indicated (at pH 7) that despite the use of Pt as catalyst, the overpotential at the cathode limits the hydrogen evolution reaction [4]. Practical application of microbial electrolysis cells will require continuous operation because of the productivity gains that can be achieved by operation that is not intermittent. In batch culture many parameters are interdependent, e.g. culture growth rate and the physical and chemical environment. It is therefore difficult to extrapolate results obtained from batch studies to steady state continuous operation. The catholyte pH may be expected to affect the redox potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, pH may also be expected to affect any methanogens inadvertently introduced in the cathode. Temperature may also be expected to (a) affect the growth rate of the electrochemically active bacteria (and hence substrate utilisation rate); (b) affect the mass transport of reactants and products to and from the electrodes, (c) influence reaction kinetics and (d) have an effect on the electrode potentials according to the Nernst equation: E′ = E0΄- (RTlnKeq)/(nF), modified at 25 °C for proton reduction as (1) E ′ = E 0 ′ − 0.0296 log P H 2 − 0.059 pH To the knowledge of the authors, no information on the effects of catholyte pH and temperature on hydrogen production via microbial electrolysis have been reported. Therefore, in this work we have studied and reported the effects of catholyte pH and temperature on hydrogen production from acetate using microbial electrolysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbial electrolysis cell setup,"2.1 Microbial electrolysis cell setup A schematic of the MEC set up is shown in Fig. 1 . The MEC consisted of two concentric tubular clear acrylic cells with i.d. 40 mm and 74 mm. The smaller, inner tube (326 ml volume) was radially perforated (39 holes each 8 mm in diameter) on one side of the tube (subtending 150° of the 360° circumference) and inserted in the larger diameter tube (1290 ml inner volume). The inner tube was assembled with an anode electrode (plain carbon cloth, PRF composite materials, Dorset, UK) rolled several times around a plastic rod of diameter 10 mm and length 200 mm and a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) located 7 mm from the anode. A cation exchange membrane (CMI 7000, Membranes International, NJ, USA) area 240 cm2 was attached to the outer surface of the inner tube so as to cover the perforations, thus separating the internal volumes of the two tubes. The cathode electrode (carbon cloth, area 75 cm2 coated with 0.5 mg/cm2 Pt, BASF fuel cell, NJ, USA) was placed round the cation exchange membrane forming a membrane electrode assembly (see also [13]). The inner tube was equipped with ports for supplying substrate, removing effluent and connecting the anode and a reference electrode. The outer tube was fitted with ports for connecting the cathode, recirculation of catholyte, releasing gas produced in the cathode chamber and for access to the feed and outlet ports of the inner tube. The headspace of the cathode chamber was maintained at 100 cm3 using an overflow U-tube. Data for anode potential, cathode potential, pH, potential difference across an external resistive load (Section 2.2.2) and temperature were logged online using LabVIEW® virtual instrumentation software (National Instruments, UK). The pH in the cathode chamber was controlled by automatically dosing with 1.2M HCl (Mettler Toledo pH transmitter, Leicester, UK) except during days 30–60 when a gas cathode was used. Except during experimentation on effect of catholyte pH, the pH in the cathode was normally controlled to 7.0. The MEC was operated at room temperature except during experimentation on the effect of temperature."
3,Operating conditions,"2.2 Operating conditions 2.2.1 Batch start up The anode was inoculated with anaerobically digested sewage sludge (10% v/v) obtained from a wastewater treatment plant (Cog Moors, Cardiff, UK). The anode medium consisted of 2.4 g/L CH3COONa, 310 mg/L NH4Cl, 130 mg/L KCl, 2.690 g/L NaH2PO4.H2O, 4.330 g/L Na2HPO4, 26.6g/L NaCl, 12.5 cm3/L of a mineral salt medium and 12.5 cm3/L of a vitamin medium. The high salt (sodium chloride) concentration in the anode medium was used to mimic salt water from where Geobacter sp., identified as integral members of bacteria consortia in MFCs and MECs [14], have been shown to be abundant [15] and also to inhibit methanogens [16]. The recipe of the mineral salts was (mg/L): MgSO4 (3.0), MnSO4.H2O (0.5), NTA (1.5), NaCl (1.0), FeSO4.7H2O (0.1), CaCl2.2H2O (0.1), CoCl2.6H2O (0.1), ZnCl2 (0.13), CuSO4.5H2O (0.01), AlK(SO4)2.12H2O (0.01), H3BO3 (0.01), Na2MoO4 (0.025), NiCl2.6H2O (0.024), Na2WO4.2H2O (0.025) [17]. The vitamin solution used was formulated according to the recipe (mg/L): biotin (2.0), folic acid (2.0), pyridoxine HCl (10.0), riboflavin (5.0), thiamin (5.0), nicotinic acid (5.0), panthotenic acid (5.0), B12 (0.1), p-aminobenzoic acid (5.0), thioctic acid (5.0) [17]. The catholyte was 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with a pH of 7.0 and conductivity of 5.97 mS/cm. Both the anode and cathode chambers were sparged with nitrogen for 10 min to remove air. An anode potential of +300 mV (Vs Ag/AgCl) was applied. This startup procedure lasted 30 days. A control startup was set up without the use of bacterial inocula. 2.2.2 Continuous operation After batch startup, the sediments in the anode were removed and replaced with 10 mM acetate (600 mg/L). The anode chamber was then fed continuously with 10 mM acetate (600 mg/L) in an aqueous solution which also included 310 mg/L NH4Cl, 130 mg/L KCl, 2690 mg/L NaH2PO4.H2O, 4330 mg/L Na2HPO4, 12.5 cm3/L of the mineral salts medium and 12.5 cm3/L of the vitamin medium referred to in 2.2.1. This anode media had a pH of 7.4 and a conductivity of 7.24 mS/cm. In days 30–60, 600 mV was applied to the cell and a gas cathode was used with nitrogen sparging (10 ml/min). This was followed in days 60–78 with addition of 50 mM PBS (pH 7.0) to the cathode and collection of gas produced in the cathode using a gas bag with FEP on/off valve (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough UK). The reactor was used in experiments 1, 2 and 3 as follows: In Experiment 1, which lasted from day 78 to day 110, two applied voltages of 600 mV and 850 mV between anode and cathode were used (Solartron 1470E potentiostat, Solartron Analytical, Farnborough, UK) and in each case the pH in the cathode was controlled for at least 3 days at 5, 7 and 9. The gas produced in the cathode was collected by displacement of water saturated with sodium chloride. The anodic gas was collected in a gas bag. Experiment 2 was designed to confirm the results of Experiment 1. A power supply unit (model 3644A, Array Electronika Co. Ltd.) was used as the Solartron potentiostat used in experiment 1 had developed a fault, and two applied voltages were used: 670 mV and 920 mV. The MEC used in Experiment 1 was connected to a 3-Ω resistor so that the potential difference (and hence current through the circuit) could be logged online. Higher applied voltages compared to Experiment 1 were used to allow for the potential drop across the external resistor. Again the pH of the cathode was controlled to 5, 7 and 9. There was a time interval of 20 days between end of Experiment 1 and start of Experiment 2 during which the MEC was not fed. Experiment 2 lasted for 69 days. In Experiment 3, 920 mV was applied to the MEC used in Experiments 1 and 2 using the DC programmable power supply unit with the catholyte pH controlled to 7.0, and the temperature of the cell varied in the range 20 °C–53 °C. The MEC had been operating for 4 months at 23 ± 1.4 °C on 10 mM acetate (600 mg/L). There was a delay of 6 days from the end of Experiment 2 to the start of Experiment 3 during which the MEC was not fed. Fresh PBS (50 mM, pH 7) was used in the cathode. Temperatures of 30.4 ± 1.04 °C (days 0–12), 42.9 ± 0.4 °C (days 12–22), 49.3 ± 3.9 °C (days 22.7–25.8) were set. For purposes of temperature control, silicone tubes were wound round the MEC and connected to a Grant flow heater (Grant Instruments, Cambridge, UK). On day 25.84, temperature control was switched off and the reactor operated at room temperature. After day 46.4, cold water from a refrigerator was re-circulated around the reactor to achieve temperatures below room temperature, up to 18.5 °C on day 49.4 when the experiment was stopped. Gas output from the cathode was metered using a bubble counter (NCBE, Reading, UK) while gas produced in the anode was collected in a gas bag. The counter was calibrated using nitrogen gas from a cylinder with the flow rate regulated using a needle valve in the range 0–2 ml/min."
4,Offline analyses,"2.3 Offline analyses The soluble COD of the influent and effluent was determined using a Hach spectrophotometer (model 2500, Hach Lange, Manchester, UK). The conductivity of the solutions was measured using a conductivity meter (Mettler Toledo, Leicester, UK). Hydrogen and methane composition in the off gases was measured using a CP-4900 MicroGC (Varian Ltd, Oxford, UK). pH was measured using a bench top pH meter from Mettler Toledo. Effluent samples were analysed for volatile fatty acids by headspace GC according to the method of Cruwys et al. [18]."
5,Evaluation of performance,"2.4 Evaluation of performance Hydrogen and methane production rates were evaluated daily by combining the gas volumes recorded with their compositions at standard temperature and pressure (stp). Current density was normalised to the area of the cathode. The cathodic hydrogen recovery was calculated based on the volume of hydrogen recovered vis a vis what would be expected by invoking Faraday’s second law of electrolysis. The coulombic efficiency was calculated based on the COD reduction and the current recorded for a given time. For example taking a basis of 1 h, the amount of COD degraded could be determined and the current that would have been expected from this COD degradation determined from the relationship: 16 g COD ≡ 1 mol H2 2F (F = faraday). Hydrogen yield was obtained from the relationship: 1 g COD ≡ 1400 ml of hydrogen at stp, neglecting biomass formation. The theory behind these calculations was reviewed in detail by Logan et al. [19]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Batch startup and initial operation with a sparged cathode vs liquid cathode,"3.1 Batch startup and initial operation with a sparged cathode vs liquid cathode During batch startup, a small current of 400–600 μA was registered but it was higher than in the control where the current was less than 100 μA. In Experiment 1, continuous sparging of the cathode with nitrogen gave a current of 1.6 mA, far below the current which would be expected from 100% degradation of the substrate (78 mA). Using a liquid cathode improved the current by six times compared to the gas cathode; however as the experiment progressed, methane was found to accumulate in the gas bag at the expense of hydrogen (Fig. 2 ); the 14% hydrogen measured in the gas bag on day 73, had fallen to 5% by day 77 with an increase in methane from less than 1% on day 73–5% on day 77. Methane production probably proceeds via the reaction: 2H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O [20] which is accompanied by a reduction of volume. This would explain the negative pressure that was observed when an MGC-1 counter (Litremeter, North Marston, UK) was used to meter the produced gas at 600 mV applied voltage in a separate experiment. This ‘sucking back’ phenomenon has also been observed by Tartakovsky et al. [21]. The source of the methanogens can be via contamination from outside or from the anode side e.g. due to a defective partitioning (by the membrane) between the anode and cathode."
8,Influence of catholyte pH,"3.2 Influence of catholyte pH In Experiment 1 the influence of catholyte pH on hydrogen production and associated parameters like COD reduction, current density, electrode potentials and amount of acid needed to maintain the set pH were studied. Fig. 3 shows the variation of hydrogen production rate and current density with pH of the catholyte at the two applied voltages of 600 mV and 850 mV and Table 1 shows the variation of the remaining parameters with catholyte pH. Catholyte pH influenced hydrogen production as did the voltage applied. The effect of catholyte pH was more significant at an applied voltage of 600 mV than at 850 mV. At 600 mV applied voltage, current density increased from 0.69 ± 0.01A/m2 of cathode at pH 9 to 1.45 ± 0.16 A/m2 cathode at pH 5. At 850 mV, the current densities were: 1.70 ± 0.16 (pH 9), 1.68 ± 0.08 (pH 7) and 1.93 ± 0.33 A/m2 (pH 5), respectively (Fig. 3). At 600 mV hydrogen production rates at catholyte pH 5 (32.3 ± 3.7 ml/day) and pH 9 (12.5 ± 5.4 ml/day) were higher than at pH 7 (1.68 ± 1.2 ml/day, Fig. 3). At an applied voltage of 850 mV higher average hydrogen production rates were also obtained at pH 5 (65 ± 1 ml/day (n = 2) or 200 ml/lanode/day) and pH 9 (59.8 ± 13.9 ml/day (n = 3)) than at pH 7 (49 ± 5 ml/day (n = 2)). The difference in hydrogen production rates at pHs 5, 7 and 9 was however not statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. The equivalent coulombic efficiency at 850 mV, catholyte pH 5 was 60%, cathodic hydrogen recovery 45%, H2 yield 1.1 mol/mol acetate converted and COD reduction of 30.5% (Tables 1 and 2). The low cathodic hydrogen recovery and low hydrogen yield may suggest that some of the hydrogen diffused from the cathode to the anode where it would have been converted to methane. Methane was detected in the anode chamber in all cases but no methane was detected in the cathode chamber. At 850 mV, catholyte pH 7, methane productivity amounted to 0.8 ml/h. Based on the feeding regime, this is equivalent to a conversion of 10% of the substrate to methane (neglecting biomass formation). A COD balance for the case of catholyte pH 7 gave the following: Input: 640 mg/L at 9 h HRT, equivalent to 593.5 mg COD/day based on the size of the anode chamber. Output: methane production rate of 19.2 ml/day equivalent to 59.4 mg COD; H2 production rate of 49 ml/day equivalent to 17.5 mg COD. Thus 13% of the input COD was recovered as methane and hydrogen [note that the COD reduction in this case was 31%]. The effluent from the anode had a pH of 6.4–6.5 with a conductivity of 6.5 mS/cm. The highest coulombic efficiency was obtained at pH 5 in the cathode (Table 2). Cathodic hydrogen recovery and hydrogen yields were low, with the worst hydrogen yield performance obtained at 600 mV, pH 7 (Table 2). In Experiment 2, the trend of hydrogen productivity and current density were similar to those of Experiment 1. Acetate is one of the main byproducts of fermentative hydrogen reactors and anaerobic digesters. The utilization of acetate for hydrogen production in MECs would be beneficial. The cathodic overpotential for proton reduction has been highlighted as one of the main electrochemical losses in microbial electrolysis cells [4], despite the presence of platinum as a catalyst. However, this has been disputed by some workers [22] indicating that the hydrogen evolution reaction is very reversible. Electrode potentials are pH dependent and the cathodic potential for hydrogen evolution would be expected to increase (numerically) by +60 mV for every pH unit decrease according to equation (1). Thus, operation at low pH in the cathode would be expected to improve hydrogen production rates and reduce the overall electrical energy added to the system. In the tests performed in this study, at 600 mV applied voltage, the current density and hydrogen production rates increased with a decrease in pH. The cathodic overvoltage was in the order: 152 mV (pH 5) > 132 mV (pH 7) > 116 mV (pH 9). Rozendal et al. [4] reported a higher cathodic overvoltage of 280 mV when 500 mV was applied. The low overvoltage at catholyte pH 9 might explain the low COD conversion of 12% as the physiological conditions of the anode chamber were similar and the anode potentials were more positive than the redox potential for acetate oxidation (i.e. −480 mV vs Ag/AgCl at pH 7 in the anode). At an applied potential of 850 mV, the cathodic overvoltage was in the order of 400 mV (pH 7) > 316 mV (pH 5) > 250 mV (pH 9). The high cathodic overvoltages at these pHs may explain the higher hydrogen production rates compared to 600 mV applied voltage (Fig. 3). The difference in the trend of cathodic overvoltage at 600 mV and 850 mV may be due to differences in dissolved hydrogen concentration (or partial pressure) – see Eq. (1). As the H2 production rate and current density increased with the reduction in catholyte pH at an applied voltage of 600 mV, it suggests that either the concentration of protons in the cathode or the cathodic overvoltage or both was/were limiting the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode. Although in Experiment 1, for an applied voltage of 850 mV, the highest H2 production rate was obtained at pH 5, the differences in hydrogen production rate and current density compared to pH 7 and pH 9 (Fig. 3) was not significant at the p < 0.05 level. This suggests that the cathodic reaction for hydrogen evolution was probably not rate limiting. It may be that the transfer of protons across the ion exchange membrane was the limiting factor in this case. The trend curve of the volume of acid dosed to maintain the pH of the catholyte is similar in shape to that of hydrogen production rates (data in Table 1). However, this volume of acid only reflects the extent of generation of OH− ions in the cathode and is probably not used for hydrogen generation considering that the dosing of the acid was in the recirculation line; the acid would have been neutralized before reaching the main chamber In Experiment 1, 600 mV applied and catholyte pH 7, if the acid dosed (6.48 × 10−3 mol H+/day) had been used for hydrogen production, the hydrogen production rate would have been 72.5 ml/day but the recorded rate was only 1.7 ml/day. Hydrogen production rate was lower at pH 7 compared to pH 5 or 9. It is likely that at pH 7 the proton gradient is lower than at pH 9. At pH 5, despite an unfavourable proton gradient (in terms of diffusion), the concentration of protons in the cathode suggests that mass transport is not expected to be the limiting factor. A comparison of hydrogen yields from continuous flow MECs is shown in Table 3 and indicates that there is a need to further improve the efficiency of MECs. Apart from the problem of methanogenesis in the anode and a low cathodic hydrogen recovery, the COD reduction in MECs (Table 1) needs improvement e.g. by optimizing the growth media. One question that may arise in this respect is whether NH4Cl is the best source of nitrogen when NH4 + ions have been shown to migrate to the cathode [23]."
9,Influence of temperature,"3.3 Influence of temperature Current density and hydrogen production were influenced by temperature, increasing in the range 20–30 °C and then decreasing as temperature was increased to 53 °C (Fig. 5). The optimum temperature for operation of the MEC was circa 30 °C, where average hydrogen production rate was 56.5 ml/day (173 ml/Lanode/day, current density 1.69 A/m2). At room temperature (23 ± 1.4 °C) the average hydrogen production rate was 42.2 ml/day (current density 1.33 A/m2). By the end of operation at 30.4 ± 1.04 °C (day 12.8), the catholyte conductivity had increased from that of 50 mM PBS (5.97 mS/cm) on day 0 to 13.6 mS/cm. Increasing the temperature to 42.9 ± 0.4 °C and then 49.3 ± 3.9 °C led to a decrease in current density and hydrogen production (Fig. 5). However, the MEC could be recovered by reverting to lower temperatures after operation at the higher temperatures. Having switched off the heating on day 25.84, it took 4.7 days for the current to increase to previous levels. Temperatures lower than 30 °C were also shown to decrease current density and hydrogen production rates. The current density at 20 °C (0.89 A/m2) was almost half that at 30 °C (1.69 A/m2, Fig. 4 ). The COD reduction at 30 °C (days 13–20) was 42.5% while at 23 °C (days 30–45) was 17.3%. The average potential difference actually applied to the cell was 862 mV and the pH of the effluent averaged 6.50. Methane production in the anode was also found to vary with temperature. At 30 °C, a methane production rate of 2.96 ml/day was recorded. When the temperature set point was changed to 42.9 °C on day 12.8, temperature increased and the methane production rate in days 13–14 (temp. 41–43 °C) was 12.9 ml/day but it then decreased steadily reaching 1.94 ml/day in days 21–22. No methane was detected in the cathode chamber. It appears methanogenic activity peaks at around 40 °C while electrogenic/anaerobic respiration peaks at around 30 °C. At room temperature, methane production, current density and hydrogen production was lower than at 30 °C. The optimum temperature for MEC operation appears to be around 30 °C. Interestingly the current density at 30 °C was almost twice that at 20 °C indicating agreement with Arrhenious equation – which relates reaction rates of chemical reactions with temperature – that a doubling of the reaction rate constant accompanies a 10 °C increase in temperature. Studies on the effect of temperature on MFC performance did not give this agreement with the power density decreasing by only 9% when the temperature was lowered from 32 °C to 20 °C [24]. The recovery of the microorganisms’ activity by allowing the temperature to decrease to room temperature, following a temperature increase to 52 °C, indicates that the electrochemically active bacteria are resilient to higher temperatures. From an energy standpoint, the optimal temperature of ca. 30 °C suggests that MECs would be suitable for tropical countries."
10,Conclusion,"Hydrogen production was improved at catholyte pH 5 compared to pH 7 and 9, the effect being more significant at an applied voltage of 600 mV than at 850 mV. The maximum hydrogen production rate of 200 mlstp/lanode/day was obtained at pH 5 in the cathode and an applied voltage of 850 mV, giving a H2 yield of 1.1 mol/mol acetate converted and a COD reduction of 30.5%. The optimum temperature for MEC operation was found to be around 30.4 ± 1.0 °C. Operation at 42.9 °C and 49.3 °C inhibited hydrogen production; however, reverting from 42.9 °C to 23 °C allowed the recovery of current generation in the MEC over 4 days."
