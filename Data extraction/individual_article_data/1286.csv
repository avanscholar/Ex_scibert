0,Introduction,"The international shipping industry has set ambitious targets for reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The strategy defined by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) proposes a quantitative reduction in carbon intensity and GHG emissions in the sector which includes, among other targets, a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels (ICCT, 2018). Among the main potential measures to be adopted in the mid- and long-terms, neutral emission fuels are listed. Several alternatives can be considered, such as distilled biofuels, bio-Liquefied Natural Gas (bio-LNG), bio-alcohols, hydrogen, ammonia and the so-called electrofuels (e-fuels). Maritime transport is the most efficient way to promote medium and long distance trade around the world. Despite the cargo containerization process observed in the recent past, long-haul shipping still focuses heavily on the transportation of mineral and agricultural commodities (UNCTAD, 2019). Additionally, while the trade of higher value-added products (typically containerized) is concentrated on the intra-Asia, Asia-North America, and Asia-Europe routes, on a mass basis the major part of the sea trade is associated with the supply of raw materials by countries of the Global South. These are typically low value-added products sold in bulk and transported in large vessels (UNCTAD, 2019). Brazilian foreign trade, for example, is strongly based on primary products. The main goods exported are iron ore, soybeans, crude oil, and sugar, which are commodities with notorious discrepancy in terms of mass and value. On a mass basis, these four products account for more than three-quarters of Brazil's exports while, in terms of value, they represent only a quarter of the country's exports (Schaeffer et al., 2018). Furthermore, Brazil has an unfavorable geographical position of its maritime trade. Far from East Asia, Europe, and the United States, and with no access to the Pacific Ocean, the country must deal with longer travel distances and higher fuel expenses and carbon intensities. 1 1 In the period 2001–2018 China was, by far, the main destination of Brazil's exports, accounting for 46% of the iron ore, 64% of the soybeans and 27% of the crude oil shipments of these products. The shipping distance between the Brazilian coast and China's main importing centers is around 11,900 nautical miles (Santos-Shanghai taken as a reference), a very high value compared to the average haul length of 4200 nautical miles (Schaeffer et al., 2018) (Schaeffer et al., 2018). Deep-sea shipping includes mostly large, ocean-going vessels covering long routes and often without a regular schedule (except for containerships). Vessels operating in long distance transportation require fuels that are globally available and have good energy density in order to maximize the space availability for cargo and ensure fuel autonomy. Therefore, the choice of mitigation measures in the Brazilian shipping sector should be carefully evaluated given the economic impacts this might have on the country's foreign trade. From a technical and economic perspective, various potentially carbon-neutral fuels could serve as mid-to long-term alternatives to replace fossil fuels used in marine engines. Possibilities are diverse, ranging from the direct use of vegetable oils to the use of synthetic fuels produced from hydrogen and recycled carbon dioxide. In addition, technological routes optimized to produce high-quality biofuels, such as biomass-derived jet (bio-jet), could also co-produce fuels suitable for maritime transportation. Brazil can be considered a potential producer of marine biofuels in view of the high availability of biomass resources and its expertise in biofuels production (Carvalho et al., 2019; Portugal-Pereira et al., 2015; Carvalho, 2017). Also, the significant participation of renewable energy sources and the low emission factor of the Brazilian power grid would benefit the production of green hydrogen, green ammonia, and e-fuels. Therefore, Brazil may have competitive advantages to produce fuels suitable for long-sea shipping that could be used in its major trade routes and/or make it an important international exporter of such fuels. Previous studies have assessed the possibilities of using alternative marine fuels. While some of them focused on the benefits and challenges of specific options (Ellis and Tanneberger, 2015a), others tried to understand the potential pathways and scenarios for the future of international shipping as a whole (Smith et al., 2016a; Balcombe et al., 2019). A number of these studies points out hydrogen as a promising alternative for reducing shipping's emissions. DNV GL, an accredited certification company, conducted three studies regarding alternative low-carbon energy sources for the maritime transportation sector (DNV, 2018a; DNV, 2018b; DNV, 2019). The most recent one assessed the commercial and operational viability of six alternative fuels compared to LNG according to several criteria based on existing literature (DNV, 2019). Further (Lloyds, 2017), and (Lloyd's RegisterUMAS, 2020) investigated the potential of zero-emission vessels in 2030. Both studies examined the application of distinct technological options for different types of ships and performed a techno-economic analysis of zero-carbon fuels for shipping in view of their economic viability, technological feasibility and emissions. While relevant, previous studies did not perform context-specific analyses that consider particularities regarding foreign trade, such as cargo, ship types and transportation routes. Also, some fuel alternatives, such as ammonia and e-fuels, identified in the literature as promising options, would be better suited for short-distance transportation. Even though it is expected that these alternatives will benefit from learning rates in the long-term, they may not be ready in the time span of the IMO goals, given also the extended lifetime of long-haul vessels (MAN and Turbo, 2013). To fill this gap, the objective of this study is to perform a comparative analysis of 14 potentially carbon-neutral fuels produced in Brazil for maritime transportation based on a set of indicators. The analysis identifies the main advantages and disadvantages of each alternative according to technical, economic, and environmental parameters. To the authors knowledge, this is the first assessment of the operational, commercial, and sustainable aspects of fuel alternatives for the maritime transport sector with a country-specific approach. This kind of analysis is critical for assessing the potential of different alternatives according to the inherent characteristics of the country. Also, it can support local decision makers to define the best strategies to comply with the sector's GHG emissions reduction goals in the upcoming years. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the technological pathways to produce non-fossil maritime fuels. Section 3 presents the methodology developed to perform a comparative analysis of the 14 alternative fuels, while Section 4 ranks the most promising ones. Finally, section 5 discusses the results obtained and section 6 presents the final remarks and suggestions for future studies."
1,Non-fossil alternative fuels for ships,"Currently, there are various options of potentially carbon-neutral maritime fuels produced from renewable energy sources, which could serve as alternative, in the mid-to long-terms, to petroleum fuels currently used for the propulsion 2 2 Naturally, the major part of the energy demand of a ship comes from its propulsion. However, energy is also required to the production of heat and electricity onboard. Today, this demand is also met by oil products. of ships (Lloyd's RegisterUMAS, 2020). Carbon-neutral fuels produce no net-CO2 emissions, which means that they offset |CO2 combustion emissions generated during their production processes. Synthetic fuels use captured CO2 from the atmosphere or industrial process, while biofuels CO2 capture occurs during biomass growth through photosynthesis. The carbon neutrality of biofuels is controversial and has been extensively discussed in the literature ((Berndes et al., 2016; Agostini et al., 2014; Bentsen, 2017; Cowie et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2016b; Cowie et al., 2013; Creutzig et al., 2015; Calvin et al., 2021)). Also, fuels carbon neutrality depends on all life cycle input sources (such as hydrogen, chemicals, and power) and this concept does not consider the emissions of other relevant non-CO2 GHGs. For this reason, the fuels evaluated in this work are called ‘potentially carbon neutral’ fuels. To better describe the technological possibilities, this study divided the fuels into three groups (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). Group 1 encompasses distillate fuels suitable for diesel (compression ignition) engines. Group 2 comprises alcohols and liquefied gases suitable for spark ignition or dual-fuel engines. Finally, group 3 includes hydrogen, ammonia, and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels (e-fuels). Liquid distilled biofuels are classified as drop-in fuels (or almost drop-in) produced from vegetable oils, lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., agricultural and forest residues) or bio-alcohols (Fig. 1(a)). Biofuels produced from vegetable oils are the straight vegetable oils (SVO) and hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO), while biofuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass and bio-alcohols are the hydrotreated pyrolysis oil (HDPO), Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FT-diesel) and Alcohol-based diesel (ATD), respectively. Alcohol and liquefied gases form the second group of fuels and represent fuels that are not suitable for direct replacement of conventional marine fuels (not drop-in), but whose application might be interesting, especially given the growing use of dual fuel engines in the maritime fleet. Group 2 is formed by liquefied biomethane (Bio-LNG) and biomass-based methanol and ethanol (biomethanol and bio-ethanol, respectively) (Fig. 1(b)). Finally, the third group is formed by alternative energy carriers based on hydrogen, which includes not only pure hydrogen (H2), but also ammonia (NH3), and synthetic fuels (composed by electrolysis-based hydrogen and captured CO2) called electrodiesel, electromethane and electromethanol (Fig. 1(c)). As this study evaluates potentially carbon neutral fuels, group 3 considers only renewable-based hydrogen and non-fossil captured CO2. The categorization is based on the similarities between the fuel-motorization systems of the different alternatives. Group 1 is composed of almost drop-in fuels, derived from biomass feedstocks and routes that produce or co-produce distillates. Although biodiesel reveals stability problems (IEA Bioenergy, 2017a) and SVO has viscosity issues (Van UyĐThe Nam, 2018; Nguyen et al., 2015; Khan, 2018; ECOFYS, 2012a), they are more compatible with the existing motorization of the Brazilian shipping fleet, even to be blended with diesel used in the 4-stroke auxiliary motors. Group 2 is composed of fuels from biomass feedstocks that require more severe adjustments in logistics, bunkering, storage, and motorization to be used. Finally, group 3 includes fuels associated with the renewable hydrogen chain. Notwithstanding, such categorization is limited by the interrelationships between these groups, given the complexity of fuel pathways. For instance, e-diesel is analyzed from the perspective of hydrogen, although, in terms of chemical composition, it is identical to FT-diesel. The description of relevant physical-chemical properties for maritime fuels and their values for each fuel evaluated in this study are presented in the Supplementary Material."
2,Methods,"The aim of this work is to compare the fuels described in Section 2 based on a set of criteria adapted to Brazilian specificities. Fig. 2 illustrates the different stages of the adopted methodology. First, a set of nine criteria, involving technical, economic, and environmental aspects, was defined (Table 2 ). A qualitative analysis was developed for each fuel from the viewpoint of this theoretical framework. Then, these criteria were turned into quantitative indicators through the attribution of notes from 1 (Very Bad) to 5 (Very Good). Criteria weights (from 1 to 3) were attributed for each criterion. One criterion received weight 3, five criteria received weight 2 and three criteria received weight 1 (Table 2). Then, the final score was calculated for each fuel, establishing a ranking of the alternatives. Given the score range (from 1 to 5) and weights (1, 2 or 3) of the indicators, the maximum fuel score (when it is evaluated with note 5 in all criteria) would be 80. For the sake of a better understanding, the ratings were normalized to fit a decimal scale. The normalization was performed so that the highest achievable score is 100. Thus, the total score of the fuels was multiplied by 100 and then divided by 80. The score x of a particular fuel is given by equation (1), in which w i and p i stand for the weight and the score of the fuel in the criteria of index i . (1) x = ∑ i = 1 9 w i p i / 0.80 In order to rank the most promising alternatives, weights were attributed to the different criteria. Weight 3 was attributed to global sustainability, as this study focus on IMO's goals. On the other hand, weight 2 was attributed to technical criteria (availability, applicability, energy density and technological maturity) and safety criteria, as they indicate the need to adapt logistic systems, bunkering, motorization, and tanking in ships, being prerequisites for potential use of these fuels. The other criteria (economy, local sustainability, and standardization) received weight 1. Their lower weight does not mean that these aspects are not important for the development of alternative fuels. It rather suggests that these criteria have lower relative relevance compared to the other criteria, considering the scope of the study. Furthermore, it is worth noting that, despite the relevance of the economic criterion from a practical point of view, technological costs can be significantly reduced over time due to green investments to scaled up production (IEA, 2021). In addition, the mandate to reduce GHG emissions may induce, in the short-to mid-terms, a niche market for alternative fuels, as long as they have scale and applicability. Regarding local sustainability, a lower weight was chosen given that the IMO's have already set regulations on fuel's sulfur content (IMO, 2016a; Hong Liang, 2017). In this sense, it is implicit that any alternative fuel used for maritime transportation must address local sustainability issues. Also, for the ratings of criteria 4 (energy density) and 5 (economic), for which there are very straightforward quantifications, a normalization of the indicators is required to keep the analysis consistent. In the case of the energy density indicator, the normalization is based on the volumetric energy content of the fuels, as shown in Fig. 3 . For the economic indicator, the normalization is based on average costs of energy, using the bunker (HFO) price as a reference (Fig. 4 )."
3,Results,"Table 3 presents the scores (in color and number scales) of the 14 fuels according to the Brazilian context. After evaluating the alternatives, the final score was determined according to the weights defined for the different criteria (Table 4 ). The ranking was led by FT-diesel, followed by HVO and ATD. In general, liquid biofuels (group 1) occupied higher positions in the ranking, mostly due to their drop-in characteristics, that indicate low or, in some cases, negligible need for modifications in logistics, bunkering and ships engines for fuel use. In fourth and fifth places appear SVO and e-diesel, the best placed fuel from Group 3, given its drop-in characteristic and despite its high cost. Biodiesel and biomethanol are tied in the sixth position. Biomethanol is the best performed fuel from Group 2 and has some advantages associated with bunkering but is penalized by its low energy density. In an intermediate range figure HDPO, bio-LNG, bio-ethanol and electromethanol. Full evaluation of fuels and their scores are presented in the Supplementary Material. Below, some discussions on each fuel results are presented."
4,SVO,"4.1 SVO Besides being a drop-in alternative, SVO has the advantages of high technological maturity and good energy density to replace heavy fuel oil (HFO). Depending on operational conditions, SVO should be pre-heated prior to the injection in diesel engines (Nguyen et al., 2015; Khan, 2018). However, its current utilization in the food industry and for biodiesel production may affect its availability. Also, sustainability issues may hamper its utilization as a maritime fuel, especially if produced from oil crops such as soybeans and palm (SSI, 2019)."
5,Biodiesel,"4.2 Biodiesel Biodiesel's energy density and technological maturity comprise its largest advantages as a marine fuel. Also, its consolidated market and distribution chain enhance its economic feasibility, at least in the near-term. To produce a totally renewable biodiesel, renewable alcohols should be used in the transesterification process, which may increase fuel costs. Notwithstanding, the fuel's low stability and the possibility of water contamination hinder its utilization as a drop-in alternative (IEA Bioenergy, 2017b; ECOFYS, 2012b). Furthermore, biodiesel's current utilization in road transport and some of its sustainability issues reduce its attractiveness to the shipping sector (SSI, 2019). Sustainability concerns are related to oil crops production, as the fuel is produced from SVO, and to the use of fossil methanol in the current conversion process."
6,HVO,"4.3 HVO HVO represents a drop-in alternative to replace fossil maritime fuels. Its high energy density, its current production at commercial scales and the growth forecast for the upcoming years make it an interesting replacement of fossil fuels (Greenea, 2017). However, sustainability issues regarding oil crop-based biofuels may compromise its availability. Further, the high quality of HVO may make it a more suitable alternative for use in the aviation sector (SSI, 2019)."
7,HDPO,"4.4 HDPO HDPO is also a drop-in alternative produced from lignocellulosic biomass, which is a largely available resource throughout the world and especially in Brazil. The high energy density of HDPO makes it a suitable option to replace fossil fuels in ocean-going vessels. Although the technology is not mature yet, new conversion facilities are under construction (IEA Bioenergy, 2017b; Envergenttech, 2016; GoodFuels, 2019). Finally, concerns regarding its low flash point and high costs may become a barrier for its use as a maritime fuel."
8,FT-diesel,"4.5 FT-diesel FT-diesel is another drop-in alternative that uses residual biomass as feedstock, which may be an advantage for Brazil. The fuel's high energy density and mitigation potential makes it an interesting choice to replace fossil fuels in long-distance shipping. Also, the high value co-products (road diesel, naphtha, jet fuel etc.) may enhance FT plants feasibility. However, up until now, the technology has been demonstrated at a pilot-scale but is not commercially available yet (Tijmensen, 2002; GreenCarFulcrum, 2018; Total, 2016). Moreover, as a high-quality and costly alternative (around 0,03 USD/MJ), FT-diesel may be better suited for the aviation sector, whose fuel is highly priced."
9,ATD,"4.6 ATD ATD is also a drop-in alternative that uses bio-based alcohols to produce distillate fuels. The fuel has the advantages of high applicability, technological maturity, and energy density. As for FT-diesel, the high value co-products may encourage the development of alcohol-based biorefineries and, therefore, enhance fuel competitiveness. However, as biomass-based alcohols has been widely used in the road transportation sector, it may not be available to produce maritime biofuels, at least in the medium term. Notwithstanding, the use of residual biomass to produce second generation alcohols and the prospects of road transport electrification may significantly increase its availability in the mid-to long-terms."
10,Bio-LNG,"4.7 Bio-LNG Bio-LNG represents a biofuel alternative that is not suitable for diesel engines, that comprise the major part of the world shipping fleet. Some LNG-fueled vessels, equipped with dual-fuel engines, are already in operation (Balcombe et al., 2019; DNV, 2015). Bio-LNG's development is mostly limited by the availability of bunkering facilities around the World. Also, the technological processes to produce the fuel are fully developed. However, this fuel has lower volumetric energy density in comparison to distillate fuels (about 20 MJ/L), which means that it requires 80% more storage space in ships (DNV, 2019). Also, bunkering costs represent an economic challenge for its use as maritime fuel (IMO, 2016b). Nonetheless, the existence of standards for gaseous maritime fuels and the potential reduction in GHG and air pollutant emissions make bio-LNG a potentially attractive alternative."
11,Biomethanol (Bio-CH3OH),"4.8 Biomethanol (Bio-CH3OH) Biomethanol is a liquid fuel under ambient temperature and pressure. It can be produced from several feedstocks and relies on a solid existing infrastructure, especially if produced from biomethane. It has also a good economic performance, with reasonable production costs in comparison to other low-carbon options 3 3 Reasonable production costs in the case of the biodigestion + reforming route. (Brynolf et al., 2014). Despite not being a drop-in fuel, methanol has good applicability on the global fleet, since its use requires minor modifications on dual-fuel engines and bunkering infrastructure, with the possibility of flex-fuel operation. Moreover, biomethanol provides significant air pollution and GHG emissions cutbacks (DNV, 2016; Brynolf et al., 2014). The main inconvenient related to the use of biomethanol as a maritime fuel is its low energy density, as it requires approximately twice as much space as distillate fuels. Also, in the case of the biodigestion route, bio-CH3OH depends on geographically dispersed feedstock."
12,Bioethanol (Bio-C2H5OH),"4.9 Bioethanol (Bio-C2H5OH) Ethanol is the most used biofuel in transport sector, with the US being the largest producer followed by Brazil. Given its high availability, bioethanol prices are low compared to other carbon-neutral fuels (Ellis and Tanneberger, 2015b). However, ethanol has not been used as a fuel in large maritime engines. In order to make it a drop-in alternative for diesel engines, it is necessary to increase its cetane number and lubricating power, which could substantially raise its production cost (McCormick and Parish, 2001). For the long term, ethanol fuel cells may become an option, though (Badwal et al., 2015; Dogdibegovic et al., 2020; Giddey et al., 2012; Kamarudin et al., 2013). Moreover, bioethanol has about half the energy density of diesel, which implies in additional fuel storage space. In terms of safety, it can be corrosive to some materials, but it easily dissolves in water and is biodegradable. At the same time, bioethanol can contribute to local and global impacts, considering its aldehydes and CO2 emissions and, depending on engine characteristics, nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well (Ellis and Tanneberger, 2015b)."
13,Green hydrogen,"4.10 Green hydrogen Hydrogen (H2) use in fuel cells is the main alternative in ship propulsion, but the adaptation of internal combustion engines (ICEs) cannot be neglected. Its use as a fuel does not generate direct GHG emissions or air pollution. Nevertheless, green H2 has relevant disadvantages to be used as a maritime fuel. In addition to being highly flammable, producing an invisible flame and having a very low volumetric energy density, the fuel also has high production, transport and bunkering costs (total costs ≈ 0.03 USD/MJ) (Balcombe et al., 2019; DNV, 2019; DNV, 2017). Technological readiness is also an issue, especially when produced from intermittent renewable energy sources. Moreover, the existing infrastructure is completely based on non-renewable energy and the production via electrolysis puts extra pressure on water resources, indicating its current lack of feedstock and infrastructure for its production and use (IEA, 2019a). On the other hand, remaining global solar and wind energy potentials are vast, which would be a plus for green hydrogen production and use in the future (IEA, 2019b)."
14,Green ammonia,"4.11 Green ammonia Green ammonia is potentially a carbon-neutral fuel (reduction of at least 95% in life cycle GHG emissions) that also leads to significant reductions in air pollutants (except for NOx). It could be used as a maritime fuel in internal combustion engines or in fuel cells (either directly or as an energy carrier for H2) and both pathways face technological and technical challenges. The use of pure NH3 in ICEs, for instance, is hindered by its combustion properties. 4 4 Narrow flammability range and low flame speed. Alternatively, it could be used as a support fuel, such as green H2, biomethanol or biogas (de Vries, 2019). In the case of fuel cells, an onboard plant would be required to crack the NH3 molecules and produce H2. To this end, high-temperature fuel cells, which are not fully developed, would be required. Thus, NH3 is not a fully mature technology yet (especially in terms of its use as a fuel) and has low applicability to the existing fleet. Energy density is also a problem given that NH3 requires a volume three times higher than conventional bunker fuel (DNV, 2019; Ash and Scarbrough, 2019). Due to the high cost of electrolysis, green ammonia's economic performance is also weak (≈0.04 USD/MJ), with levelized energy costs around two times those of distilled biofuels. Finally, although NH3 is safe from a flammability perspective, it is corrosive and highly toxic, harnessing its operational safety (Ash and Scarbrough, 2019; de Vries, 2019). This is particularly important for releases into the sea (spills), as shown by (Raj and Reid, 1978). A possible pathway for NH3 as a fuel in long-distance travel ships could be, firstly, based on the least-cost fossil derived-NH3. This would allow converting harbors and fleet. Then, a green NH3 industry could be deployed in large scale. However, as of today, Brazil is already highly dependent on ammonia/urea imports as fertilizer, and the country's existing ammonia plants have been recently closed (dos Santos and Szklo, 2016)."
15,Electrodiesel (e-diesel),"4.12 Electrodiesel (e-diesel) Electrodiesel is the same fuel as FT-diesel in terms of chemical composition. Thus, it has very good energy density, applicability, and safety ratings. Also, from a global sustainability perspective, the e-diesel is a promising fuel, presenting very low or nearly zero life cycle GHG emissions. Its main drawback is the economic aspect, with production costs around 0.1 USD/MJ (Brynolf et al., 2018). The production of H2 from intermittent energy sources implies high costs and several technical challenges. Besides, there is another relevant issue regarding feedstock availability, given the fact that CO2 must come from CCS 5 5 Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the process of capture, transport, and storage of waste CO2 from different sources (industries, refining, and biomass conversion plants, for example). or DAC, 6 6 Direct Air Capture (DAC) represents the capture of CO2 directly from the atmosphere to produce a concentrated stream of CO2. which are currently not available in large scales (Köberle, 2019)."
16,Electromethane (e-LNG),"4.13 Electromethane (e-LNG) Electromethane is chemically identical to biomethane. Therefore, many of the bio-LNG ratings also apply to e-LNG. Furthermore, similarly to e-diesel, e-LNG has a weak performance in terms of costs (≈0,1 USD/MJ) and feedstock availability (again, CO2 from CCS or DAC) (Brynolf et al., 2018)."
17,Electromethanol (e-CH3OH),"4.14 Electromethanol (e-CH3OH) Electromethanol shares many of the biomethanol ratings because they are equivalent fuels in terms of molecular composition. Similarly to the other e-fuels, e-methanol faces challenges regarding feedstock availability (once again, CO2 from CCS or DAC) and technology readiness level. However, its production costs tend to be slightly lower than those of e-diesel and e-LNG, which could be an advantage (Brynolf et al., 2018)."
18,Discussion,"FT synthetic diesel occupies the first position in the ranking followed by HVO and ATD. The potential for reducing GHG emissions of FT-diesel favors its evaluation and the drop-in characteristics of FT-diesel, HVO and ATD that indicate low or negligible/zero need for engines, bunkering and logistics modifications contribute to their high scores. SVO, e-diesel and biodiesel figure in fourth, fifth and sixth positions. Even though SVO has the advantages of high availability, technology maturity and almost drop-in characteristics, sustainability concerns threat its utilization as marine fuel. The same applies to biodiesel, whose utilization in marine diesel engines is limited by up to 7% mass basis (ShipBunker, 2017; Dan, 2017). E-diesel has the best score among the e-fuels given its drop-in characteristic, despite its high cost and availability challenges. In an intermediate range figures biomethanol, HDPO, bio-LNG and bioethanol. Biomethanol has advantages in terms of bunkering but is penalized by its low energy density. In case of HDPO, the fuel has the advantage of being a drop-in alternative that uses residual biomass as feedstock, while the technological maturity represents its major drawback. For bio-LNG, the lack of infrastructure, safety concerns and methane fugitive emissions, hamper its utilization as marine fuel. Regarding bioethanol, even though the fuel is largely produced in Brazil, issues regarding its applicability and energy density undermine its use as marine fuel in the short term. Electromethanol, electromethane, green ammonia and green hydrogen occupy the worst positions in the ranking. Electromethanol has similar evaluation to biomethanol, with the additional challenges regarding, feedstock availability, technology readiness and high costs. Electromethane's high costs and low technology readiness and availability penalize its evaluation in addition to biomethanol's. Finally, even though green ammonia and green hydrogen have high potential to reduce GHG emissions, their low energy density, high cots, safety, and applicability issues hamper their utilization in the short term. In the case of ammonia, it is worth mentioning that, even though some studies enhance its use as an alternative fuel, they highlight its applicability only for short-distance transportation (Ash and Scarbrough, 2019). Besides the evaluation of the fuels in each criterion, the choice of criteria weights may impact the results. Hence, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate differences in the ranking according to different criteria weights. First, it was considered weight 1 for all criteria (case S1). Then, weight 2 was attributed to economic criterion (case S2) and the same weight as in the baseline case (Table 2) for the others. Table 5 summarizes the attributed weights in sensitivity analysis cases in comparison with the baseline. Table 6 compares the final ranking for each sensitivity case with the baseline (as shown in Table 4). These results show that modifications in criteria weights have minor impact the ranking, as most of the fuels remains in nearly position. FT-diesel, HVO, ATD and SVO registered the same performance in all cases, occupying the fourth first positions. E-diesel was the only fuel whose performance varies considerably in each of the sensitivity cases. In the baseline scenario, e-diesel occupies the fifth position while in cases S1 and S2, it occupies the ninth and eighth positions, respectively. Such difference is justified by e-diesel's high potential to reduce GHG emissions, which favors its evaluation in the baseline scenario and its high costs, which undermines its performance in case S2. Biomethanol, biodiesel, HDPO, Bio-LNG remain in intermediary positions, while ethanol occupies the same position in all cases. E-methanol, e-LNG, green NH3 and green H2 registered the lowest scores in all cases, mostly due to their high costs, low technological maturity, availability, and energy density. Overall, results obtained are helpful to identify the most promising fuel alternatives to decarbonize Brazilian maritime transport sector. These results are relevant in a global context, given that Brazil is a major commodity exporter whose localization is geographically unfavored and far away from its main commercial partners (Schaeffer et al., 2018; Schim et al., 2018; Müller-Casseres et al., 2021). Thus, the utilization of low carbon fuels in Brazilian maritime transportation would have a direct impact in global emissions. Further, Brazil could act as a major player and supplier of alternative marine fuels, given the advantages identified in this study. In this sense, instruments such fuel mandates would promote investments in research and development of promising technologies (such as FT-diesel, HVO and ATD) in the country. However, the use of alternative fuels might be constrained by the lack of supply and/or restrictions in trade partner regions. For this reason, international standards should be applied to alternative fuels in maritime sector, similarly to what has been done in the aviation sector, in which fuels goes through an extensive procedure of tests and norms (ASTM International, 2017; CAAFI, 2021; IATA, 2019). Also, in the case of biofuels, certification procedures are needed to ensure their sustainability and exclude pathways that may contribute to deforestation, increased energy consumption, water demand, among others."
19,Final remarks,"The evaluation and comparison of 14 fuel alternatives carried out in this study aimed to identify the main advantages, disadvantages, and application possibilities of these alternatives in the Brazilian long-distance maritime transport sector. Distilled biofuels are the most promising alternative, at least in the short-term, given their high energy density and their compatibility with the existing infrastructure. This is particularly relevant in the case of Brazil, whose international trade profile is characterized by long-distance transportation of low added value products. However, the availability of sustainable biomass and competition with other sectors may hinder its application in the production of biofuels for the maritime transport sector. In this sense, the use of biomass residues that are currently not used reduces the concerns associated with sustainability and allows the production of bioenergy on a large scale. Also, some technological pathways co-produce high value products, such as biojet fuel and naphtha, that may stimulate the construction of novel biorefineries in which bio-based bunker fuels are considered as residual products and, therefore, have lower production costs. However, logistical issues associated with the dispersed location of residues resources and large-scale production plants can increase the costs and emissions of biofuels. Bio-LNG represents a mid- and long-term alternative once constraints related to lack of supply infrastructure and its low energy density are solved. Biomethanol is also shown to be a favorable alternative due to its technological maturity and a consolidated transport and distribution infrastructure. It has good applicability in the current fleet of ships, but has low energy density, which makes it demand twice as much space on the vessels when compared to distillate fuels. The use of bioethanol as a marine fuel is particularly interesting for Brazil, one of its main world producers. However, its low energy density, the need for additives, the risk of corrosion and its current use in road transport reduce its competitiveness for navigation. Green hydrogen seems to be a distant alternative for the Brazilian case, mainly due to its low performance in terms of costs, energy density and applicability. Green ammonia, which has slightly better ratings in these criteria, may be an option for a hydrogen carrier or an alternative for Brazilian cabotage transport. On the other hand, e-fuels are an interesting option from both a technical and a sustainability perspective, but still face significant challenges in terms of cost and technological maturity in the medium term. Finally, despite the efforts to conduct a preliminary assessment for Brazilian potential to produce carbon-neutral fuels for maritime transportation, some limitations should be addressed in future studies to investigate in further details the implications of fuel replacements to comply with IMO goals 2050. For instance: i. Site-specific life cycle assessments, georeferenced and economic analysis would determine the mitigation potential, logistic and economic challenges regarding novel fuels production and utilization in Brazil and may alter fuels evaluation in global sustainability, availability, and economic criteria. ii. The inclusion and/or choice of new criteria may provide alternative ranking results. iii. Also, the inclusion of fuel technology pathways, as well as a better representation of shipping engines and types, in integrated assessment models (IAMs) can provide a better understanding of the impacts on energy and land-use of replacing conventional maritime fuels by carbon-neutral alternatives, and test the criteria associated with the food-energy-water nexus. (Müller-Casseres et al., 2021). iv. Some alternative fuels that have low temperature storage (Mokhatab et al., 2013; Boulougouris and Chrysinas, 2015) (such as hydrogen and bio-LNG) and some biofuels (due to its oxidation and corrosivity properties) (Lin, 2013a; Mathew and Thangaraja, 2018) require special materials for storage tanks, piping systems, pumps, engines and others. Fuel compatibility aspects include all ships systems that het in contact with fuel (e.g., engines, pumps, storage tanks, pumps, etc.), auxiliary bunkering ships and fuel storage terminals and define their technical feasibility (Kesieme et al., 2019). Thus, a detailed evaluation of fuel compatibility can provide a better understanding of its applicability. v. Fuel blends with diesel have already been tested in marine engines (biodiesel (Ogunkunle and Ahmed, 2020; Lin, 2013b), ethanol (Galindo et al., 2020), methanol (Paulauskiene et al., 2019), ammonia (Dincer and Siddiqui, 2020) (Kobayashi et al., 2019), SVO (Labecki et al., 2012; Blin et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2019) and HDPO (Chong and Bridgwater, 2014). Therefore, studies that focus on testing different levels of promising maritime fuel blends and/or determining the maximum feasible blends are necessary to evaluate their applicability and mitigation potential. vi. An assessment of some options that can co-produce jet- and diesel-range fuels, for example, is key. In such cases, coupled strategies for ‘hard to decarbonize’ sectors (shipping and aviation) may reduce costs and speed up the development of alternative fuel pathways."
