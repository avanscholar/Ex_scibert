0,Introduction,"Biological production of added-value products from carbon dioxide (CO2) and renewable electricity is a promising approach to recycle a greenhouse gas into carbon-neutral commodity chemicals. However, this remains a nascent concept with limited proof-of-concept studies using either pure bacterial cultures (Nevin et al., 2011, 2010; Tremblay and Zhang, 2015) or mixed populations (Bajracharya et al., 2015; Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2016; Ganigué et al., 2015; Jourdin et al., 2015b, 2014; Kuroda and Watanabe, 1995; Marshall et al., 2013b, 2012, Mohanakrishna et al., 2016, 2015; Patil et al., 2015). The production of H2, either biological or electrocatalytic, plays a key role in H2-mediated biological production as it governs the availability of reducing power, and thus the transformation of CO2 to organic products (Agler et al., 2011; Blanchet et al., 2015). Recently, the role of H2 as a mediator has been highlighted. Jourdin and co-workers showed biologically induced H2 production at −0.85V vs SHE and further utilisation by acetogens within the biofilm (Jourdin et al., 2016). In a second study, Blanchet et al. poised the cathode at two different potentials (−0.36 and −0.66V vs SHE) to test the effect of H2 in biological production of carbon-based commodities. Acetogenic activity was only observed at −0.66V vs SHE, demonstrating the importance of H2 as intermediate of biological production of carbon-based commodities (Blanchet et al., 2015). To date, acetate is the main product of bioelectrocatalysed reduction of CO2. Recently, Ganigué and co-workers proved that butyrate and small amounts of ethanol and butanol can be produced using CO2 as a sole carbon substrate (Ganigué et al., 2015). In the latter work, acetate was the initial product, and butyrate accumulation was observed three days after. Later on, the high concentrations of organic acids, low fermentation pH, and the increase of available reducing power presumably led to the re-assimilation of acetate and butyrate and their conversion into ethanol and butanol. As of today, continuous research efforts have allowed to characterize the different electron transfer mechanisms in bioanodes and to understand their function. However, little is known on the electron-transfer mechanisms in biological production of commodity chemicals from CO2. In this work, we have characterized electrochemically and microbiologically different H2-mediated electricity-driven systems for CO2 capture and transformation into added value compounds (acetate, butyrate, ethanol and butanol) with the aim of providing a deeper understanding of these systems, and particularly on how electrons flow from a solid-state cathode to a terminal electron acceptor."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bioelectrochemical systems,"2.1 Bioelectrochemical systems Four identical 240mL two-chambered H-type bioelectrochemical systems (BES) were used in this study. Table S1 compares the maximum commodity chemicals produced in these systems. The differences between product concentrations and spectrum could be related to slight differences in the operational conditions applied (pH2, CO2 feast-famine conditions and pH). In all cases, anodic and cathodic chambers were separated by a cationic exchange membrane (CMI-7000, Membranes International Inc., USA), and maintained in constant stirring to avoid mass transfer limitations. Sampling ports and electrodes were housed in gas-tight butyl-rubber septa closing both anode and cathode compartments. Titanium rod (Ti plus 50g·m−2 Pt, Magneto, The Netherlands) and carbon graphite (9cm2, NuVant’s ELAT® LT2400W, FuelCellsEtc, USA) were used as anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. Net anodic and cathodic compartments volumes were both set to 100mL. BES were covered with aluminium foil throughout the experiment to prevent phototrophic activity. Biocathodes were inoculated using 5mL of an enriched carboxydotrophic mixed culture grown on syngas (32% CO, 32% H2%, 8% CO2 and 28% N2) in a lab-scale reactor. This mixed culture exhibited a sustained production of C2 and C4 organic acids and alcohols (Ganigué et al., 2015). The inoculum was dominated by species of the genus Clostridium: C. carboxidivorans/C. ragsdalei/C. kluyveri. A synthetic medium containing 2-bromoethanesulfonate to inhibit methanogenesis was used in both anode and cathode (Ganigué et al., 2015). The synthetic medium was prepared with deionised water and contained per litre: 1g KH2PO4, 1g NaCl, 0.25g NH4Cl, 0.25g MgOH, 0.1g KCl, 0.03g CaCl2. Additionally, 1mL·L−1 of trace metal solution (concentration per litre: 20g nitrilotriacetic acid, 10g MnSO4·H2O, 8g Fe(SO4)2(NH4)2·6H2O, 2g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.2g CuCl2·2H2O, 0.2g NiCl2·2H2O, 0.2g Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.2g Na2SeO4, 0.2g Na2WO4, 2mg ZnSO4·7H2O), and 1mL·L−1 of vitamin solution (concentration per litre: 100mg Pyridoxine hydrochloride, 50mg Thiamine hydrochloride, 50mg Riboflavin, 50mg Nicotinic acid, 50mg DL-Calcium pantothenate, 50mg p-Aminobenzoic acid, 50mg Thioic acid, 20mg Biotin, 20mg Folic acid, 1mg Vitamin B12), were added to the medium. The temperature of all BES was maintained at 34±1°C, and no pH control was applied. Pure CO2 (Praxair, Spain) was sparged regularly every 2–3days for a period of 5min to warrant substrate availability. This sparging time ensured saturation of dissolved carbon (at 34°C, concentration at saturation is 26.9mM C-CO2) as assayed regularly in control set-ups. Liquid samples (10mL) were taken periodically (thrice a week, on average) from both anodes and cathodes for the monitoring of the concentration of products and pH. The volume withdrawn was replaced with freshly prepared mineral medium."
3,Electrochemical instrumentation,"2.2 Electrochemical instrumentation A 5-channel potentiostat (BioLogic, Model VSP, France) was connected to the BES. Software from the same producer (EC-Lab v10.37) was used to run simultaneous multitechnique electrochemistry routines, which included chronoamperometry (CA), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A cathode potential (Ecat) of −0.8V vs. SHE was used for CA. This potential was set at −0.8V vs. SHE to drive bioelectrocatalyzed reduction through H2, following a similar strategy as that reported in recent publications (Bajracharya et al., 2015; Jourdin et al., 2015b; Marshall et al., 2013a; Patil et al., 2015). The cathodic potential was monitored with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (0.197V vs. SHE), model RE-5B BASi, United Kingdom). The parameters for CV were as follows: scan rate: 1mV/s; Ei =−0.8V vs. SHE; Ef =0.0V vs. SHE. Four CV cycles were performed in each routine, but only data from the last cycle is shown. The parameters for DPV were as follows: Einitial (Ei)=0.0V vs. SHE and Efinal (Ef)=−0.8V vs. SHE; pulse height: 50mV; pulse width: 300ms; step height: 1mV; step time: 1000ms; scan rate: 1mV/s; current averaged over the last 20% of the step (1s, 300 points). DPV and CV data were analysed with SOAS software (Fourmond et al., 2009) to identify the oxidation and reduction peaks."
4,Microcosms based experimentation,"2.3 Microcosms based experimentation To further characterize the electrotrophic activity of the biocathode community, different experiments were carried out in four tailor-made single-chamber BES (microcosms) as described in Pous et al. (2014). Each microcosm, with a final working volume of 14mL, was composed of a graphite rod (Sofacel, Spain) with a projected surface area of 7.85cm2 as a working electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (model RE-5B BASi, United Kingdom). The microcosms were also covered with aluminium foil throughout the experiment to prevent phototrophic activity. Two sets of experiments were carried out using a pure culture of Rhodobacter capsulatus (DSM1710) and mixed cultures from BES 3 and 4. These experiments had two aims: i) to demonstrate that a defined Rhodobacter culture could produce hydrogen at the cathode and ii) to assign a role of the unidentified redox peak observed in the electrochemical characterization of these systems. The working electrode of each microcosm was operated chronoamperometrically at −0.8V vs. SHE, the same cathode potential poised at the parents BES. Pure CO2 was flushed regularly every 2–3days for 5min to ensure substrate availability. Once a stable reductive current density was reached, broth was replaced with fresh medium to remove planktonic cells and to ensure observations were related only to the biofilm activity. Experiments with a pure culture of Rhodobacter capsulatus (DSM1710) were performed. Cultures were obtained from DSMZ (www.dsmz.de) and maintained at recommended culturing conditions using mineral media DSM27 and ATCC1704 media. Active cultures at early exponential conditions in 10mL liquid media were used as inocula for microcosm experiments. Rhodobacter capsulatus was inoculated and tested for H2 production and electroactive properties. Once the role of Rhodobacter sp was elucidated, two microcosms were started-up using 5mL of inoculum from the BES 3 and 4 cathodes and 9mL of fresh medium were sequentially tested in dark-light transient conditions to assess the activity of the Photosystem I. The microcosm was exposed 24h to illumination using a light-emitting diode (LED) (6.5W, 320lm, 50-60Hz, OSRAM 42706)."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses The concentration of organic acids (acetate and butyrate) and alcohols (ethanol and butanol) were analysed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent, USA) equipped with a DB-FFAP column and a flame ionisation detector. The composition of the gas phase was analysed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an HP-Molesieve column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to detect H2, oxygen, nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and CO2. The pH and conductivity were regularly measured from both effluents (pH-Meter Basic 20+, EC-Meter Basic 20+, Crison Instruments, Spain)."
6,Determination of bacterial community structure,"2.5 Determination of bacterial community structure Bacterial communities from biofilm and bulk liquid samples were taken at day 36 of BES 4 and analysed using conventional molecular methods. All four BES had the same inoculum. Samples were taken from BES 4 which produced carboxylates and alcohols (Table S1). Samples were collected aseptically using basic microbiological precautions in a continuous CO2 from the biocathode. DNA was extracted using the FastDNA® SPIN kit for soils (MP, Biomedicals) following exactly manufacturer’s instructions. DNA from biofilms was extracted directly from 0.5 cm2 (projected surface) of carbon cloth. DNA of suspended cells was extracted from pelleted 4mL samples. A preliminary PCR-DGGE analysis of samples was performed using the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene as described previously (Prat et al., 2009; Vilajeliu-Pons et al., 2015) to check for differences among replicates. Four replicates were selected for the analysis of the V1-V3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene of Bacteria. Amplicons were obtained using the D88 (5′-GAGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG-3′) and R519 (5′-ACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′) universal primers. Barcodes and Illumina adaptors were fused to primers. Sequences were obtained with the Illumina MiSeq platform (paired-end method PE300) using conventionally adapted protocols. Sequencing was performed by DNA Vision (Gosselies, Belgium). Paired end sequences were joined and refined using QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology, v. 1.9.0) software package (Caporaso et al., 2010) with default parameters. Minimum sequence quality was set to q28 and only sequences with a minimum overlapping fragment of 25bp were considered. A homogenous subset of sequences, corresponding to the lower number of sequences found in a single sample, was randomly obtained for each sample and used for comparisons. All comparisons between samples and taxonomic assignations were made using an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) based approach at a similarity cutoff level of 97% (roughly at the species level). OTUs having less than 10 sequences were discarded from the analysis. Representative sequences for each OTU were assigned taxonomically using either QIIME (Green Genes dataset release gg_13_5_otus), or after Blast searches at the NCBI."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure of the electrosynthetic microbiome,"3.1 Structure of the electrosynthetic microbiome The microbial community of the biocathode had a rather low diversity with few clearly dominant phylotypes both at the biofilm and the bulk liquid samples (Shanon’s diversity index <2.0). A total of 48, 263 sequences were distributed selectively according to the sample type in 69 OTUs containing at least ten sequences. More than 80% of sequences (38,720 sequences) distributed in only ten OTUs, thus reinforcing the low diversity of the microbial community. This situation revealed a low functional redundancy in the BES, most likely related to the limited range of incubation conditions applied to the system (Konopka, 2009). Sequences were distributed mostly within the Proteobacteria (65.9% of sequences) and the Firmicutes (29.8%) both in the bulk liquid and the biofilm samples. However, significant differences of the microbial community structure between the two sample types were observed at lower taxonomic levels (Weighted Unifrac test, p <0.001, Fig. 1 ). Proteobacteria distributed mainly within the Alphaproteobateria in the biofilm sample but not in the bulk media, where Betaproteobacteria, specifically the Rhodocyclales, appeared as the dominant population. Clostridiales were the most abundant Firmicutes in both sample types. Highly represented phylotypes of both sample types revealed interesting differences at the genus and species level that suggested a functional compartmentalization of the cathode cell (Table 1 ). Interestingly, highly differentiated populations in terms of relative abundance between the two cell compartments included potentially autotrophic bacteria representatives. Alphaproteobacteria accumulated in the cathode surface, forming thick layers of low-diversity biofilms expanding over several micrometres on top of the carbon cloth (Fig. S1). All alphaproteobacteria belonged to the Rhodobacteraceae and distributed in nine different OTUs. Eight of them, representing almost all alphaproteobacterial sequences found in the biofilm sample (99.8%), showed a high similarity to either Paenirhodobacter enshiensis DW2-9T (97.4%) or Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 (96.8%). Unfortunately, no clear differentiation between the two species could be obtained with the available sequence data. Rhodobacter species and other Purple Nonsulfur Bacteria (PNB) have been proven as H2 producers in anoxic conditions (Lubner et al., 2010). Net hydrogen production in Rhodobacter sp. is mainly due to its nitrogenase activity and is essentially driven by light through photosystem I (Smith, 2002). Paenirhodobacter enshiensis DW2-9T has recently been described as a non-pigmented cell within the Rhodobacteraceae. Unfortunately, hydrogen production through nitrogenase activity has not been reported for this species so far, but it is unlikely to occur via nitrogenase activity since no homologs of nifH, nifD and nifK (the structural genes for nitrogen fixation) can be found in the complete genome draft sequence (Wang et al., 2015). Autotrophic Firmicutes, namely Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium autoethanogenum in view of 16S rRNA gene similarity, showed a completely different distribution and accumulated almost exclusively in the bulk liquid. Carboxydotrophic clostridia can fix CO and/or CO2 into organic molecules through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (Köpke et al., 2010), and excrete organic acids and alcohols as fermentation products. An external source of reducing power, hydrogen or carbon monoxide in conventional syngas fermentation is required for conversion of CO2 as the sole carbon source (Köpke et al., 2010). Based on the relative abundance of carboxydotrophs in both bulk liquid and biofilm, it is plausible to assume that in the present system, autotrophic conversion of CO2 to organic matter may take place preferably in the bulk liquid, and not in direct contact with the cathode surface. However, the latter cannot be completely excluded as C. ljungdahlii, which has been proven to produce C2 and small amounts of C4 electrotrophically (Nevin et al., 2011), was also detected in biofilm samples."
9,Electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization Turnover cyclic voltammetries (CV) and differential pulse voltammetries (DPV) were used to characterize electrochemically the BES capable to reduce CO2 to organic acids and alcohols. Fig. 2 depicts two representative CVs under turnover conditions (in the presence of CO2), an abiotic control carried out before inoculation of bacteria, and a second one in which C2 and C4 organic acids and small amounts of alcohols were produced. Two redox pairs (differing significantly from the abiotic control) were identified, one at −0.55V vs SHE and the second one at −0.24V vs SHE. The redox pair at −0.55V vs SHE is typically observed in H2-producing biocathodes, in which the biofilm catalyses this reduction, decreasing the important energy losses associated to the catalytic hydrogen production (Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2014). The second redox pair was identified at a formal potential of −0.244V vs SHE at pH 4.63. The anodic (EpA) and cathodic (EpC) peak potentials were −0.230 and −0.259V vs SHE, respectively. The peak separation (ΔEp =EpA −EpC) may allow the identification of the mass-transfer regime (Harnisch and Freguia, 2012), and is often used as a criterion to identify a reversible processes and fast charge exchange (Rieger, 1994). For reversible redox couples controlled by diffusive mass transfer, the anodic and cathodic peak potentials difference, ΔEp, is always 0.059/z V at 25°C, where z is the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction. The experimental ΔEp was calculated as 0.028±0.005V (n=10). According to a temperature-corrected ΔEp of 0.061/z at 34°C, 2 electrons were theoretically exchanged in this redox pair. A complementary calculation of the number of electrons and protons exchanged in the reaction was done following the methodology proposed by Bard and Faulkner (Bard and Faulkner, 2011), and resulted in the involvement of 2 electrons and 1 proton."
10,Relation between the redox pairs and the end-products,"3.3 Relation between the redox pairs and the end-products DPV with small-amplitude pulses characterization offers better sensitivities compared to normal pulse voltammetry (Bard and Faulkner, 2011), and were used to further characterize the redox peak appearing at −0.244V vs SHE. The correlation between pH-value and the half-wave potential (Fig. 3 A), and between pH and peak intensity of the half-wave potential (Fig. 3B) was analysed experimentally. Results showed that the formal potential of the redox-active pair was shifted towards a more positive value with decreasing pH. The slope of the graph E1/2 vs pH was −0.049V per pH unit, close to the theoretical value (0.061V at 34°C). This shift in the formal potential demonstrated that the observed reduction reaction was proton dependent. The intensity of the half-wave potential decreased at lower pHs from close to 0 A at pH 7 to −1500·10−6 A at pH 5 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that electrotrophic activity was enhanced at lower pH values. Fig. 4 shows four representative DPVs obtained at different time points during the experimental period, and at which CO2 reduction yielded different end-products (acetate, butyrate, ethanol and butanol). In all cases the reduction peak appeared at around −0.24V vs SHE, shifting to more negative values at lower cathode pHs (Fig. 3A). The peak was barely visible at the beginning of the experiment, when the concentration of products in the broth was negligible, but it became clearly visible when the production of organic acids and small amounts of alcohols started in the BES (B, C and D). The intensity (area) of the peak increased as the cells produced longer carbon-chain molecules and alcohols indicating higher levels of activity. It was, thus, hypothesized that the redox peak area could be related to distinct metabolic reactions. The comparison of the formal potential observed experimentally to the reduction potential of several primary cofactors potentially involved in CO2 transformation pathways (Table 2 ) suggested that NADH and/or NADPH (E=−0.265V and −0.269V vs SHE at 34°C and pH 5, respectively) could be involved in the reduction reactions observed in the BES. NAD(P)H are biological electron carriers that play an important role in maintaining the intracellular redox balance, and contribute to homeostasis in microorganisms (Wang et al., 2013). These are intracellular cofactors and cannot be detected using CVs and DPVs. However, NAD(P)H are involved in the different H2 producing reaction in Rhodobacter sp (Lubner et al., 2010; Shafaat et al., 2013; Swierczek et al., 2010; Tikhonov, 2014), in photosystem, nitrogenases and hydrogenases complexes. Rhodobacter sp. typically have a group of hydrogenases and nitrogenases capable of catalysing a reversible reduction of protons to hydrogen (Friedrich et al., 2011; Geelhoed et al., 2010; Shafaat et al., 2013). In strictly anaerobic bacteria, Fdred, NADH, and cytochromes are the electron donors for the reduction of protons (Geelhoed et al., 2010). These cofactors have similar reduction potentials to the redox pair experimentally observed."
11,Electrotrophy in bio-H2-mediated electricity-driven systems,"3.4 Electrotrophy in bio-H2-mediated electricity-driven systems Batch experiments were conducted in microcosms to gain further insights on the nature and role of the unidentified redox peak. Each microcosm was inoculated using either a pure culture of Rhodobacter capsulatus or fermentation broth from the cathodes of BES 3 and 4, respectively and poised at −0.8V vs SHE. Two microcosms experiments with a pure culture of Rhodobacter capsulatus were done to demonstrate that a defined Rhodobacter sp could produce hydrogen at the cathode using electrons as electron donor. The electroactive properties of Rhodobacter capsulatus were confirmed just after inoculation with concomitant current demand. The electrons from the cathode electrode were taken by Rhodobacter capsulatus to enhance the production of H2 at a rate of 18.87mmolsH2 L−1 d−1 (coulombic efficiency: 60%). Further electrochemical characterization (Fig. 5 ) proved that the biofilm evolved to a biological H2 producing system. Moreover, the unidentified redox peak previously observed in bioelectrochemical systems (Fig. 4) also appeared shifted because of the pH difference. However, the low signal (area) observed associated to the low concentration of biomass present in these microcosms did not enabled further characterization of this pair. For this reason, experiments with mixed population from the BES 3 and 4 with higher biomass concentration were done. CVs in mixed cultures microcosms were also performed before inoculation and after 95h of operation, once stable reductive current densities were reached (Fig. S2). The redox pair between −0.2 and −0.3V vs SHE was observed just after inoculation. The subsequent medium replacement to remove planktonic cells did not alter the characteristics of the redox peak, clearly indicating that this was linked to direct transfer of electrons from the solid state electrode to the cells firmly attached to the electrode and excluding any signal from an excreted metabolite. In this respect, the biocathodic biofilm was subsequently exposed to different conditions to elucidate if the observed peak could be related to photosystem, nitrogenases or hydrogenases activities. The hypothesis that the peak was linked to the activity of the photosystem was tested in a microcosm by assessing the response of the biofilm to dark-light transient conditions. Results of DPVs (Fig. 6 ) did not show any differences in the expression of the redox peak after exposing it to natural light or artificial light (320 lumens) for at least 24h, proving that H2 producing was not light dependent. These results agree with the presence of Paenirhodobacter like bacteria in the cathode. P. enshiensis lacks photosynthetic membrane structures and pigments and grows chemoheterotrophically, while all Rhodobacter species known so far are photosynthetic (Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, this redox pair could be related to the activity of nitrogenases and/or hydrogenases in Rhodobacter species. Phototrophs can also produce hydrogen through nitrogenases (Geelhoed et al., 2010), although and reduction of protons to H2 by a nitrogenase will only take place in the absence of nitrogen or as a by-product of nitrogen fixation (Rivera-Ortiz and Burris, 1975; Smith, 2002). However, the medium used in this test contained ammonium, being this hypothesis unlikely. Duché et al. described that Rhodobacter capsulatus has another class of soluble, nonstandard [NiFe] hydrogenases (Duché et al., 2005). This membrane bound hydrogenase is the sensory or regulatory hydrogenase (RH). These proteins contain an active site similar to the Standard [NiFe] hydrogenases, exhibit high binding affinities for H2, which allows them to mediate H2-dependent signal transduction (Lubitz et al., 2014). However, these enzymes exhibit extremely low levels of activity, approximately 100-fold lower than the metabolic hydrogenases. Under reducing conditions or in the presence of hydrogen, the RH interacts as a homodimer with a histidine protein kinase for downstream regulation of metabolic hydrogenase protein transcription. This [NiFe]-hydrogenase was also described by Bernhard and co-workers (Bernhard et al., 2001) as an H2 sensor in the proteobacterium Ralstonia eutropha. The detection of physiologically important gases such as H2 by organisms is mediated by biological sensors that convert the molecular signal into a cellular response (Bernhard et al., 2001). This signal could be used to track the performance of a bio-H2-mediated production of commodity chemicals from CO2 and renewable electricity. This redox pair signal reported in this study was also observed by others researchers (Jourdin et al., 2016, 2015a; Sharma et al., 2013) in autotrophic hydrogen-producing biofilms. Those biofilms were mainly composed by Proteobacteria; Betaproteobacteria; Rhodocyclales and Rhodocyclaceae detected in 16S rRNA analysis (Jourdin et al., 2015a) or Curvibacter, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfovibrionales, Desulfobacteraceae and Syntrophobacteraceae characterized by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization. This seems to point out that such signal is not strain specific, but could be detected in any organism containing a hydrogenase. Thus, the findings of this work open the door to the development of a biosensor application or soft sensors for monitoring such systems."
12,Conclusions,"This study reveals: i) a syntrophic consortium in which an electro-active cathodic biofilm composed mainly by Rhodobacter sp. reduces protons to hydrogen, which is uptaken by the planktonic cells (i.e. Clostridium sp.) to reduce carbon dioxide to organic acids and small amounts of alcohols; ii) Rhodobacter sp. could produce H2 from the cathode electrode; and iii) the performance of H2-mediated electricity-driven systems could be tracked by the activity of a biological H2 sensory protein in Rhodobacter sp. identified at cathode potentials between −0.2V and −0.3V vs SHE."
