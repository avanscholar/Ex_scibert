0,Introduction,"The main automobile transportation fuel for the predictable future will still be gasoline. The global energy demand for gasoline to 2040 is predicted to increase by 30 %, according to the International Energy Agency, due to the increased consumption of all modern fuels [1,2]. Although the consumption of gasoline in the developed countries has gradually decreased, the automobile market growth in China, India and other rapidly developing countries, the world consumption of gasoline continues. The consumption of oil in non-OECD countries has increased by 33 % since 2005 [3]. As the demand for gasoline grows, more severe environmental regulations will be administered in most countries to adjust vapor pressure and the contents of benzene and dienes in gasoline. The average crude oil quality in the world is expected to slowly decrease due to the effect of shale derived oil. Refineries may thus be forced to use high sulfur content and low octane streams, placing stress on the economic requirements for the products of the present technologies. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel catalytic processes to produce high octane, low olefin streams [4,5]. Heavy naphtha, as one of the petroleum cuts, is capable of production of high quality gasoline [6,7]. But it is reasonable for refineries to have desulfurization and catalytic naphtha reforming units [8,9]. A reforming catalyst is typically composed of alumina supported platinum, one or two metal promoters or modifiers, and chloride ion. Dehydrogenation/hydrogenation capability is usually provided by the platinum on the alumina while alumina and chloride are responsible for acidic isomerization [10–16]. A common poison for the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation activity of catalytic reforming catalysts, the sulfur present in naphtha feeds at concentrations of less than 1 ppm usually modifies and poisons some platinum promoter metals such as rhenium and iridium. Reforming catalysts may be temporarily or permanently deactivated by sulfur poisoning [17–20]. Naphtha feeds are treated by naphtha hydrotreaters for catalytic reforming and removal of organic nitrogen and sulfur compounds by hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) processes, respectively [21–24]. The two main licensors and suppliers of naphtha reforming catalysts are UOP and Axens. The processes are different in terms of operation type (semi-regenerative or continuous), catalyst type, and process engineering design. Both licensors believe in the requirement of feed hydrotreating to remove permanent reforming catalyst poisons and decrease the temporary catalyst poisons to low levels. In recent years, many modifications in the process design and improvements in catalysts have been made. A number of other commercial licenses for reforming processes are available in the world. Similar to other major reforming processes, these processes differ in the operation type (semi-regenerative, continuous, or cyclic) and process engineering design [25,26]. Some examples for such processes include Houdriforming Process (by the Houdry Division of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.) [27], Magnaforming Process (by Engelhard Corporation) [28], Powerforming Process (by ExxonMobil) [29], Rheniforming Process (by Chevron) [30], Ultraforming Process (by Standard Oil of Indiana) [31], M-Forming (by ExxonMobil) [32], Zeoforming Process (by SEC Zeosit) [33] and Methaforming Process (by New Gas Technologies Synthesis) [8]. Methaforming and Zeoforming processes use zeolite catalysts. Simultaneous desulfurization and reforming are one of the advantages of these two processes and a separate desulfurization unit is not necessary. A broad range of low octane naphtha streams containing light alcohols (methanol/ethanol) or other oxygenates (co-feed) are converted into a high octane gasoline blend stock by Methaforming process, which yields low benzene content. The process also handles feeds with up to 1000 ppm of sulfur and removes up to 90 % of sulfur in the absence of hydrogen [34]. In some processes such as Zeoforming, the acidity of zeolite catalysts is used for the dual purposes of desulfurization and reforming. Sulfurization is performed by acidic sites via breaking of sulfur compounds to produce H2S (Eq. (1)) while reforming is carried out based on the structural properties and shape selective nature of zeolite. Therefore, no hydrotreating units are required in this type of process given the low sulfur content of naphtha. On the other hand, considering the structure of zeolite, the reaction intermediates (Eq. (1)) in addition to hydrogen sulfide are olefins, which are the starting materials for aromatic compounds and paraffins. Thus, the need for this process to meet the use of precious metals such as platinum is also met. In addition to the significance of the catalyst, these processes, which have different structures compared with conventional reforming processes including desulfurization and reforming, must be performed under different operation conditions of temperature, pressure and feed flow rate. (1) R 1 - S H R 1 - S - R 2 R 1 - S - S - R 2 C 4 H 4 S → Z S M - 5 R - C 6 H 6 + C n H 2 n + 2 + H 2 S The appropriate catalyst for this process is high Si content ZSM-5 catalyst [33,35–46]. A unique channel structure, ZSM-5 zeolite is an intermediate between wide pore zeolites such as Faujasite and narrow pore ones such as Erionite. Consequently, molecules with dimensions larger than those of C10 aromatics (tetramethylbenzene) and structures similar to the components in the final gasoline boiling point range are not able to get through the structure of ZSM-5. In other words, even if bigger molecules may form within the structure of zeolite, they cannot pass through the pores and are therefore cracked into smaller molecules [47–49] In the present study, heavy naphtha reforming reaction for gasoline production over HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 50) catalyst was performed in a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor. The corresponding catalyst was successfully synthesized and characterized by XRD, BET, TPD, FESEM and TEM techniques. The design of experiment was performed using modified Taguchi design of experiments. In order to investigate the effect of three factors including WHSV, temperature and pressure at three levels, the Taguchi L9 design table was used and to complete the data, three more points were added to it to obtain the modified Taguchi table. The modified Taguchi design of experiments was employed to evaluate the interactions between the independent experimental factors and the observed responses. A three-level, four variable (three variables were used including weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of the feed, reaction temperature and pressure) Taguchi design of experiments and 3 extra points by changing the factors for attaining a better model were selected in order to investigate the relation and subsequent effects of the variables on five responses (octane number, liquid recovery, coke deposition, benzene content and S conversion). Moreover, the optimum conditions for gasoline production via heavy naphtha reforming were predicted using the modified Taguchi model."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials NaZSM-5 zeolite was prepared by hydrothermal method using colloidal synthetic mixtures. The starting material used included sodium hydroxide (98 wt. %, Merck Chemical Co.), aluminum isopropoxide (AIP, Merck Chemical Co.), colloidal silica (40 wt. % SiO2, Aldrich Chemical Co.), tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr, Merck Chemical Co.), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 40 % aq., Merck Chemical Co.), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98 %, Merck Chemical Co.), and deionized water. NaZSM-5 was treated in an ammonium nitrate solution (NH4NO3, Merck Chemical Co.). The obtained HZSM-5 zeolite was formed by pseudo-boehmite, SB1 (AlO (OH), Sasol)."
3,Preparation of catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of catalyst Nano NaZSM-5 samples were prepared using a sol-gel medium consisting of Al2O3 (1), SiO2 (100), TPAOH (16), TPABr (8), Na2O (2.5) and H2O (2200). A previously reported method was used to synthesize nano NaZSM-5 samples [50–53]. In short, aluminum isopropoxide and NaOH pellets were first dissolved in distilled water (solution I). Solution (II) consisted of colloidal silica and known quantities of TPABr and TPAOH. Both solutions were stirred for 1 h to obtain homogeneity. Solution (I) was added dropwise to solution (II) under vigorous stirring. Next, sulfuric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the mixture thus obtained in the 10−12 range. The resulting mixture was stirred for 10−12 h at ambient temperature to assure homogeneity. The gel prepared was statically crystallized at 453 K for 2 days. The solid product obtained was filtered, washed using deionized water until the pH of the washing water reached 7–8, dried at 383 K for 12 h and calcined at 873 K for 6 h. NaZSM-5 samples were treated twice in a 2 M NH4NO3 solution at 353 K for 3 h, rinsed, and calcined in air at 873 K for 6 h before being used in catalytic experiments. The powered obtained was formed with 25 % alumina for reactor tests."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to identify the crystal structure using a model D5000 Siemens instrument (scan speed 0.04s−1, range 2θ, between 5–50 degree with Cu-ka radiation and 0.154056 wavelengths in 30 kV and 40 mA). The products were characterized by comparison of their XRD diagrams with those of reference. FE-SEM analysis was carried out to determine the morphology and particle size using a Field Emission electronic microscope (ZEISS, SIGMA Series). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the particles were obtained using a Philips EM 208 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. The specific surface areas were obtained using the BET method. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K using a micromeritic ASAP 2010 analyzer. In order to identify the total acidic strength and weak and strong acidic sites, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) method was applied using ammonia gas. An American Micrometrics TPD/TPR 2900 was used for this purpose."
5,Catalytic performance,"2.4 Catalytic performance The experiments were carried out in a pilot test system, which is licensed by the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI). This device can tolerate temperatures and pressures of up to 500 °C and 70 bar, respectively. The simplified diagram of the pilot is presented in Fig. 1 . As observed, the temperature along the reactor bed is controlled by three thermocouples (TIC 1–3). As observed, the feedstock is pumped from the reservoir (T-1) using a piston pump (P-1) to the top of the reactor. Helium and nitrogen gases are sent from the cylinders to the top of the reactor for purging, the flow rate being controlled by mass flow controllers (MFC-1). The unit consists of a stainless steel reactor (internal diameter of 2.2 cm and length of 51 cm) kept at isothermal conditions using a three-zone electric furnace. In the reactor inlet, the temperature of the inlet feedstock increases to the reaction temperature using the pre-heating zone of the reactor (zone-1). The reactions are carried out under the following conditions: temperature of 300−440 °C; pressure of 5−20 bar and WHSV of 1-4 h−1. As previously indicated, throughout the bed, there are 3 thermocouples to control the bed temperature. At the reactor outlet, the reaction effluent is cooled using a water cooled heat exchanger (E-1). The vapor and liquid phases are then separated in a high and low pressure separators (V-1 and V-2). After reducing the pressure, the liquid is allowed to flow from the separator to the other flash drum, maintained at atmospheric pressure. The liquid sample is then discharged discontinuously into sampling bottles. Finally, the output of gas flow rate is measured by a gas-meter and the composition of the stream is determined using an online gas chromatograph (Agilant 8790-A). Each catalyst test took 104 h. Table 1 shows the specifications of the heavy naphtha feed used in this work. 2.4.1 Product analysis Octane number, coke deposition, benzene content and sulfur content of products were determined by ASTM 6730, UOP 703, ASTM 6730 and ASTM D5453 standard test methods, respectively."
6,Modified Taguchi design of experiments,"2.5 Modified Taguchi design of experiments The modified Taguchi (L9) design was used to study the interaction of process variables and predict the optimum process conditions for simultaneous operation of reforming and desulfurization of heavy naphtha over HZSM-5 catalyst. Catalytic activity tests were carried out according to a L9 Taguchi experimental design for three numerical factors plus three extra experiments to study the interactions and check other operating conditions. The main as well as interaction effects were evaluated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the octane number, liquid recovery, coke deposition, benzene content and desulfurization (S conversion) as the quantitative responses of the experiments. The responses were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010 software. The optimum value of the octane number (maximum value), liquid recovery (maximum value), coke deposition (minimum value), benzene content (minimum value) and desulfurization conversion (maximum value) were calculated using solver analyzing tool in Microsoft Excel 2010 software by a proper target. In this work, WHSV (A), temperature (B), and pressure (C) were chosen as the three factors for investigation. Table 2 shows the parameters and the levels used in the experiments. In this modified Taguchi design, the total number of experiments was 12. The complete design of modified Taguchi and the experimental results are listed in Table 3 . To avoid any systematic bias in the results, the experiments were carried out randomly. The reported numbers for all three factors of WHSV, temperature, and pressure in Table 3 are the numbers recorded precisely from the control instruments in the reactor system. Therefore, the reported numbers are accurate and replace the numbers initially considered."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Characterizations of catalyst,"3.1 Characterizations of catalyst Crystal structure types were determined using XRD phase analysis (Fig. 2 a). XRD patterns are shown by the synthetic mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites in the 2θ radiation angle range and 5–50° angle change at a rate of 1.5 min−1. The index peaks corresponding to ZSM-5 zeolite in 2θ are 7.79°, 8.69°, 23.08°, 23.48°, 23.78° and 24.28°, which were observed in all the samples (JCPDS data with reference code 00−037-0359) [47–53]. The profiles corresponding to the acidity and amounts of weak, medium and strong acids, based on thermal desorption (NH3-TPD), are shown in Fig. 2b. As the TPD profiles indicate, two peaks are observed in the temperature ranges of 180−300 °C and 310−450 °C, which are associated with the weak and strong acidic sites, respectively [49,54]. The pore sizes of the catalyst are shown in Fig. 2c. As observed in the figure, it has the most mesopores. The absorption/desorption isotherms of the catalyst can be categorized as type IV isotherms, which is characteristic of mesoporous inorganic compounds (Fig. 2d). The hysteresis loops at high pressures, which indicate mesopores, are shown in Fig. 2d. As shown in Table 4 , the N2 andNH3adsorption/desorptions have been carried out to characterize ZSM-5 catalyst and determine its total acidity (1.37 mmol NH3/g), respectively. The balance between the external surface area of the sample and the micropore volume, quantitatively determined from the so-called hierarchy factor (HF), which is calculated using S e x t S B E T × V m i c V t , plays an important part in the activity of the zeolite catalysts [55]. The hierarchical levels of zeolites have been estimated using the hierarchy factor (HF) [56]. The HF value of the catalyst is 0.16, which further shows the excellent hierarchical properties. The FE-SEM and TEM images of the synthesized nanoparticles of ZSM-5 zeolite are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The size, particle morphology and agglomeration of the synthetic ZSM-5 sample are shown by the FE-SEM images, as indicated in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of ZSM-5 with low particle size (Fig. 3). Since the size of the particles, which are mostly spherical, is in the nanometer range, they have formed larger spherical particles by accumulation. Nano ZSM-5 sizes were confirmed by TEM images."
9,Catalytic runs,"3.2 Catalytic runs Catalyst tests were carried out in order to investigate the operation conditions and the effects of the effective factors, as shown in Table 3. Fig. 4 shows the effect of different operation conditions on the appearance of the products obtained. Based on the responses in Table 3, the products with light yellow color have better qualities compared with the other products. The most important and effective characteristic parameter in the evaluation of the current reforming processes (in refineries) is octane barrel, which is obtained by multiplying octane number by liquid recovery [57]. The corresponding values for this parameter for light blue samples (R11, R7 and R8) are 75.7, 66.3 and 64.7, respectively, which are the highest barrel numbers. In addition, the barrel numbers for dark colored samples (R3, R9 and R6) are 26.5, 38.7 and 44.6, respectively, which are the lowest barrel numbers. Therefore, the values of this important characteristic are much larger for lighter samples compared with the dark ones. Fig. 5 shows the percent compositions for the liquid products of heavy naphtha reforming process. Considering the operation conditions and the positive responses obtained from Table 3, the percentages of the lumps present in the samples are different in each test."
10,Analysis of variance,"3.3 Analysis of variance By using modified Taguchi method, 12 experimental runs were performed. Table 3 shows the octane number, liquid recovery, coke deposition, benzene content, and sulfur conversion of the products in each test run. The significant model must be referred to the F-value (Fischer variation ratio) and p-value (significant probability value) whereby the p-value of the selected model should be less than 0.05 % and insignificant of lack of fit. For each response, the best model was selected even as the p-value of all terms in the model are less than 0.05 % and also the predicted R-squared will become maximized. In order to evaluate the adequacy of modified Taguchi model, the experimental data of responses were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results are shown in Table 5 . The suitable R 2 and high F-value of the model implied the ability of the models for prediction of responses. The significant F shows the probability that the model may be wrong and the small amount of significant F indicates that the model is correct. The polynomial predictive models for the responses developed by the model are presented in Fig. 6 , based on the coded value. 3.3.1 Regression model The selection of the model is required by regression in the beginning [58]. The quadratic model is the most general method in this respect. The desired model can be modified in any form by selecting the most predictable regression. The known non-significant effects of some of the parameters can be deleted in the beginning. Thus, the number of experiments is reduced without any negative impact on the result. Eq. (2) shows the general form of the quadratic model, in which Y is the studied response, xi and xj are the variables considered in the study and β0, βi and βji are the estimated coefficients. The interactions between the individual factors are represented by the combination of the factors (such as xixj). (2) Y = β 0 + ∑ 1 3 β i x i + ∑ 1 3 β i i x i 2 + ∑ i = 1 3 ∑ i < j 3 β i j x i x j The experimental results and predicted values obtained from the models (Eq. (2)) are given in Fig. 6. As observed, the predicted values match the experimental ones reasonably well with suitable R-Sq, R-Sq (adj) and suitable R- Sq (predicted) for responses. Therefore, these models are sufficient basis for the interpretation of the obtained relationships Y = f (A, B, C). 3.3.2 Effects of main parameters on responses (a) WHSV effect According to Fig. 7 and the polynomials expressed in Fig. 6, it is clear that WHSV mainly affected coke deposition and conversion responses. However, due to the interaction effects, all responses shifted a lot by changing WHSV from low to high level. Based on Fig. 7 and the relationships shown in Table 5, WHSV affects conversion and coke deposition as the main effect. However, given the interactions between WHSV and other parameters, WHSV strongly affects all the responses (Fig.7 a–e) such that increased WHSV positively affects coke deposition and liquid recovery while negatively affecting the octane number, benzene content and conversion responses. Fig. 7a indicates that increasing feed flow rate causes not much time to react. Thus, the octane number increases by increasing WHSV. However, the whole change occurs at the optimal temperature and pressure of 349 °C and 20 bar, respectively, and is about 0.385 unit. As observed in Fig. 7b, increasing the feed flow rate increases liquid recovery because a part of the fed leaves the reactor unreacted by decreasing the residence time of the feed. Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is inversely proportional to the contact time. Increasing WHSV lowers the contact time in the reactor and makes the products initially formed leave the catalyst bed more quickly. Therefore, these products will not have enough time to continue to grow hydrocarbon chains and undergo heavy aromatic reactions and will thus form lighter products. Other studies also indicate that increasing LHSV decreases the gas yield while increasing liquid recovery [59]. According to these studies, increasing LHSV increases both normal paraffin and iso-paraffins. Therefore, the variations of octane number due to LHSV changes cannot be exactly determined [59]. Therefore, as observed in Fig. 7c, increasing WHSV decreases the amount of heavy products and thus less coke is formed. As for the amount of benzene, the prediction of the relationships and values in Fig. 7d is negative for the amount of benzene present, which is likely to be negligible, and WHSV changes will not significantly affect these values. Fig. 7e shows that increasing WHSV does not favor sulfur conversion. However, since this response is a side response and the process is not meant to reduce the sulfur quantity, it will not be very important for the determination of optimum WHSV. (b) Temperature effect As observed in Fig. 8 , temperature affects almost all responses as the main effect. Fig. 8a and b show that increased temperature has two separate effects on the octane number and liquid recovery. Increasing temperature up to 370 °C enhances phenomena such as oligomerization and forms hydrocarbons in the boiling point range of gasoline whereas the selectivity to these hydrocarbons reduces at higher temperatures due to the formation of lighter products such as light olefins. Stepanov et al. reported that increasing temperature increases the gas yield while decreasing the gasoline yield [59]. In another report, the same group showed that increasing temperature decreases the yield [45]. Octane number changes have not been directly pointed out in Stepanov’s report. However, the changes of product composition can be used to estimate the trend in octane number changes, so that the amount of iso-paraffins has increased with increasing temperature to about 370 °C and then decreased [59]. This is similar to the behavior observed for the variations of octane number with temperature. Furthermore, the investigation of the effect of temperature in another report by Stepanov indicates increased benzene amount by increasing temperature. However, this change is not completely linear and an increase in benzene content is observed from 370 °C onwards [60]. Eq. (3) expresses the elementary transformations in naphtha reforming process using zeolite catalyst [61]. A l k a n e s → S h o r t e r A l k a n e s (3) A l k a n e s → C y c l o h e x a n e s + H 2 C y c l o a l k a n e s → C y c l o h e x a n e s C y c l o h e x a n e s → A r o m a t i c s These transformations include cyclization of acyclic compounds, isomerization of cyclic compounds into cyclohexane, dehydrogenation, and aromatization. Therefore, according to Fig. 8d, up to the about 380 °C, reactions such as benzene alkylation to produce heavier aromatic compounds seem to cause benzene consumption and the amount of benzene is decreasing up to 370 °C. However, at higher temperatures, following the formation of heavy aromatic compounds and coke, zeolite sites do not have the necessary efficiency for benzene consumption and more benzene is left in the final product at higher temperatures. Cordero-Lanzac et al. found out that the main coke precursors were olefinic and aromatic compounds by simultaneously studying normal pentane cracking and ZSM-5 catalyst deactivation. This had already been reported by other research groups [37,62]. (4) According to previous reports, temperature plays an important part in the lump distribution of the product and catalyst deactivation. The maximum concentrations of olefins and BTX aromatic compounds (coke precursors) are observed at higher temperatures, which cause considerable loss of catalyst activity. (c) Pressure effect Pressure factor affects all responses, except for liquid recovery. Fig. 9 shows the increasing trend of the octane number as the pressure increases. The ratio of hydrocarbons in the product can significantly change with variations in the partial pressure of the reactants, which effectively change the relative rates of dehydration and aromatization steps in the reaction [49]. Pressure changes have not affected liquid recovery (Fig. 9b). Other studies have also shown the negligible effect of pressure on gas yield [59]. In fact, pressure has not considerably affected the liquid recovery and gas yield. Thus, increasing pressure increases aromatic reactions and the octane number is thus expected to increase. Among the four response affected by pressure, coke deposition is the only response on which pressure has a negative effect. As Fig. 9c shows, increasing pressure increases coke deposition. Higher pressures have also been shown to increase the tendency to secondary alkylation reactions. This is influential on increasing the selectivity to heavy aromatics. Thermodynamically speaking, increasing pressure always increases the molecular weight of the product [49].Therefore, as the pressure increases, coke deposition, which can be of aromatic nature, also increases. Fig. 9d shows the effect of pressure variations on benzene content. As previously indicated, benzene production is among the most basic reforming reactions using zeolite catalyst. Therefore, since the aromatization process occurs more with increasing the process pressure and on the other hand, pressure increases during the alkylation process and even in some cases (higher pressures), secondary alkylation occurs. Thus, the benzene produced is expected to be consumed during the reforming process. Decreased benzene content by increasing pressure has also been reported by other workers [45]. Fig. 9e shows the positive effect of pressure on the rate of desulfurization. According to this figure, with increasing pressure to 15 bar, the amount of sulfur in the liquid product collected at the temperature of 350 °C and thus sulfur conversion decreases. However, the sulfur content decreases by increasing the pressure form 15–20 bar and thus sulfur conversion increases. When ZSM-5 was applied in n-hexane cracking under high pressure, it showed better catalytic activity and stability and higher light alkene selectivity [63]. Therefore, according to the mechanism shown in Eq. (5), the desulfurization of aromatic hydrocarbons present in heavy naphtha can be expected to increase by increasing pressure [46].

The behaviors at lower and upper temperature limits are completely different. At lower temperature limit, increasing WHSV decreases the octane number while octane number increases by increasing WHSV at upper temperature limit. The difference between the octane numbers at upper and lower temperature limits reaches its maximum at low WHSV values. Fig. 10b shows the effect of lower and upper temperature limits against WHSV variations on the liquid recovery. At lower temperature limit, liquid recovery increases by increasing WHSV. However, at upper temperature limit, increasing WHSV does not appreciably affect liquid recovery. In Fig. 10c, increasing WHSV at both lower and upper temperature limits decreases the amount of coke deposition. Thus, there seems to be no interaction between the temperature and WHSV for the amount of coke deposition. Fig. 10d shows the increase and decrease of benzene content affected by the interaction between WHSV and temperature. Since increasing temperature causes the formation of heavy aromatics and thus benzene consumption, increasing WHSV decreases the benzene content. On the contrary, at lower temperature limit, the reaction does not proceed fast after the first aromatization process; that is, benzene formation, and most of the benzene formed is consumed to form other aromatic products. Therefore, at lower temperature limit, increasing WHSV increases the benzene amount. With regards to the interaction of temperature and WHSV on the rate of sulfur conversion, as observed in Fig. 10e, these two parameters have a trend similar to that of coke deposition amount (Fig. 10c). Increasing WHSV at both lower and upper limits of temperature decreases sulfur conversion due to the little time for the completion of the reaction and thus no interactions seem to exist between temperature and WHSV for sulfur conversion. (b) WHSV vs. Pressure The only interaction between WHSV and pressure is against the octane number and sulfur conversion, as shown in Fig. 11 . At the lower pressure level (P = 5 bar), the octane number decreases by increasing WHSV. On the contrary, at the upper pressure level (P = 20 bar), the octane number does not appreciably change by increasing WHSV. As observed in Fig. 7a, under constant pressure and temperature conditions, the octane number decreases by increasing WHSV. However, increasing pressure increases the octane number, according to Fig. 9a. Therefore, since more aromatization occurs at higher pressures, increasing WHSV increases the octane number. This pressure sensitivity is less at lower pressures and decreases at higher pressures. As shown in Fig. 11e, the sulfur conversion values again show different behaviors at upper and lower pressure limits against WHSV changes. At lower pressure limit, sulfur conversion increases by increasing WHSV and the completely opposite behavior is observed at upper pressure limit. (c) Temperature vs. Pressure As observed in Fig. 12 , the interaction between temperature and pressure only affects the octane number and temperature and pressure behave similarly for other responses at lower and upper limits. According to Figs. 8a and 9 a, the octane number changes vs. temperature are parabolic and linear under constant WHSV conditions. The interaction between temperature and pressure for the octane number is also parabolic in Fig. 12a. At upper pressure limit, increasing temperature in the 370−380 °C range maximizes the octane number. Further temperature increase decreases the octane number due to the secondary reactions and coke formation. As observed in Fig. 9b, pressure changes do not affect the amount of liquid recovery and thus the liquid recovery change diagram at both lower and upper pressure limits is parabolic Fig. 12b, as in Fig. 8b. Regarding the coke deposition content, benzene content and sulfur conversion, the changes of these responses follow identical trends at lower and upper pressure limits and thus do not show any binary interactions (Fig. 12c, d, e). 3.3.4 Optimization of operating conditions To determine the optimal point of this process, it is necessary to determine how important these responses are and how they should be maximized or minimized. Therefore, since the objectives were increasing the octane number, liquid recovery and sulfur conversion, as well as reduce coke deposition and benzene content and given the importance of increased octane number and liquid product in this process, the coefficients of importance for the latter two responses were considered 5 in the relationship used to determine the optimum point. In addition, the coefficients of importance for reduction of coke deposition and benzene formation were considered 3 and the corresponding coefficient for sulfur conversion, which is of the least significance in this process, was 1. The relationship is as follows: Final response = (5× Octane Number) + (5×Liquid Recovery) + (Sulfur Conversion) – (3×Coke Deposision) – 3×Benzene Content Considering this response and the domain of the parameters, optimization was carried out by solver in the Excel software and maximization of the final response and the proposed point was found as shown below: Pressure = 20 bar, temperature =349.09 °C and WHSV =4.02 h− 1. Following optimization, the results obtained are listed below: octane number = 83.85 %; liquid recovery = 95.09 %; coke deposition = 11.18 %; benzene content about zero; and S conversion = 61.81 %. Considering the optimum conditions, the responses obtained in the reactor test under optimal conditions were as follows: Octane number = 81.24 %; liquid recovery = 91.59 %; coke deposition = 9.45 %; benzene content = 1.01 %; and S conversion = 63.70 %. As observed, the responses obtained in the reactor test under optimal conditions show an acceptable difference with the responses predicted by the model."
11,Conclusion,"ZSM-5 catalyst (Si/Al = 50) was successfully synthesized in order to investigate the effects of operation conditions on the heavy naphtha reforming process using zeolite catalyst in the absence of hydrogen. The three operation parameters of WHSV, temperature and pressure were studied as the main factors to determine the optimal conditions for obtaining the maximum octane number, liquid recovery and sulfur conversion and minimum coke deposition and benzene content as the responses in the modified Taguchi mode. Each of the responses were modeled based on the effective parameters according to the general form of the quadratic model and the final model was determined by eliminating factors with p-values of less than 0.05. The predicted values match the experimental ones reasonably well with suitable R-Sq ، suitable R-Sq (adj) and R-Sq predicted for responses. Based on the Fischer test, the most effective parameters for the octane number, liquid recovery, coke deposition, benzene content, and sulfur conversion are temperature, WHSV, and pressure, respectively. The most effective binary interactions for the octane number, liquid recovery, coke deposition, benzene content and sulfur conversion are WHSV-T, WHSV-T, T-P, T-P and WHSV-P, respectively. The effects of the parameters were studied using modified Taguchi model and the following optimal conditions were obtained: WHSV =4.02 h− 1, temperature =349.09 °C, and pressure = 20 bar. In order to study the optimum factors and predicted responses, the reactor test was carried out under optimal conditions and the following results were obtained: Octane number = 83.85 %; liquid recovery = 95.09 %; coke deposition = 11.18 %; benzene content ∼0%; and S conversion = 61.81 %. The results obtained in the reactor test under optimal conditions indicate that the model proposed is completely valid."
