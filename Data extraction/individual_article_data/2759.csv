0,Introduction,"The production of bioenergy from various organic waste biomass might fulfil the lack of fossil fuel supply (Saravanan et al., 2018). Remarkably, bioenergy in-terms of biohydrogen, which is a major renewable energy source and it holds high value in global market than other biofuels (Hosseini and Wahid, 2016). The main advantage of hydrogen over other conventional fuel as it has high energy density (Jung et al., 2013) and there is no toxic byproduct is liberated during its usage to the environment (Das and Veziroǧlu, 2001). In dark fermentation a mixed culture of hydrogen producing microbes (HPM) such as Bacillus sp., (Barros et al., 2010) Clostridium sp., (Srivastava et al., 2017) Enterobacter sp. (Lin et al., 2016) plays a vital role in conversion of carbohydrate into hydrogen, acetic acid and carbon dioxide under favorable anaerobic condition (Barros et al., 2010). There are various types of anaerobic reactors used to generate biohydrogen under dark fermentation by the researchers. The reactors such as anaerobic packed bed (APB), anaerobic filter (AF), anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (USAB) are used effectively for producing biohydrogen. Among them UASB yield higher biohydrogen production with simultaneous biogranule formation (Intanoo et al., 2014). Continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) by dark biohydrogen fermentation was also an efficient method, but it cannot be operated with high biomass at low HRT (Alexandropoulou et al., 2018). Mostly in CSTR, the cells are in the suspension, whereas immobilized cell can yield higher biohydrogen than suspension (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Keskin et al., 2012). According to Kumar et al. (2016) the immobilization of HPM was employed in four ways such as i) adsorption, ii) entrapment, iii) encapsulation and iv) polymer based which results in the formation of hydrogen producing granules (HPG). It has to be noted that the HPG formation is a complex process where HPM are densely attached with the supporting material to increase the particle size. HPG‘s are formed due to self-immobilization of HPM under favorable experimental condition. HPG has several advantages than conventional sludge, i.e., denser in structure, easily settable, high solid concentration, solid-effluent separation and withstand reactor shock loads condition (Liu et al., 2009). This review summarize the significant mechanism behind HPG formation, types of supporting materials used for granule formation, role of EPS in granulation and their characteristics. In addition this review narrates over the role of anaerobic microbes in biohydrogen production and biogranule formation."
1,Formation mechanisms of HPG,
2,Immobilization,"2.1 Immobilization The immobilization is a process where HPM are attached to an inert or insoluble particle to form granules and that can be stable and sustain for longer period. Immobilization processes minimize the lag phase of microbial growth when compared with other process. Fig. 1 . shows various type of immobilization of HPM. According to Kumar et al. (2016) and Sekoai et al. (2018) the immobilization of HPM could be carried out mainly in three ways they are i) entrapment, ii) encapsulation iii) adsorption. 2.1.1 Entrapment based HPM immobilization Immobilization of HPM by gel entrapment is the most commonly practiced method for harvesting biohydrogen. In this type of immobilization, HPM are protected by the supporting material and it minimize the biomass loss during high upflow velocity caused by shorter HRT (Kongjan et al., 2011; Xing et al., 2014). The entrapped HPM holds certain advantage such as minimal biomass wash out, withstand harsh environment and greater hydrogen production (Kumar et al., 2016). In this technique, the following supporting materials were successfully used for biohydrogen production such as sodium alginate, agar, calcium alginate, cellulose, polypropylene, and polyacrylamide etc. Zhu et al. (1999) have treated the tofu wastewater using agar immobilized HPM‘s in batch condition. Agar forms a gel medium, which is biodegradable and can easily entrap the HPM (Rhodobacter sphaeroides). Tofu wastewater is rich in ammonia ions, the agar gel act as a protective layer for microbes from ammonia inhibition and as a result, yielded hydrogen production of 2.1 L/h m3. In addition 41% of total organic carbon was removed during hydrogen production. Another researchers used mycelia pellet as biological carrier for entrapment of HPM (Clostridium sp. T2 microorganism) to enhance biological hydrogen production (Zhao et al., 2012). When the entrapped biological carrier mycelia pellet was introduced in the CSTR to treat Xylose, comparatively 40% higher hydrogen yield was observed in experimental over control. Sekoai et al. (2016) have used alginate as a carrier for enhancing HPM to produce hydrogen from organic waste generated in food store. The alginate, the entrapped HPM yielded 215.39 mL H/mL TVS of hydrogen and 48.7% of hydrogen fraction in batch fermentation. In addition, during hydrogen fermentation, the productions of volatile fatty acid were observed which accounts for 68% of acetate and 29% of butyrate. Lin et al. (2006) have used silicone gel as effective supporting material for entrapment of HPM in draft tube fluidized bed reactor with a hydrogen yield of 4.98 ± 0.18 mol H2/mol sucrose. In CSTR, they used activated carbon with silicone gel as a supporting material to treat sucrose wastewater and reported a hydrogen yield of 3.15 mol H2/mol sucrose (Wu et al., 2006). On seeing the effect of hydrogen yield in different reactor configuration for entrapment based HPM immobilization, CSTR illustrates lower hydrogen yield than other reactor configuration. The reason behind the above statement, higher biomass concentrations cannot be operated in CSTR. 2.1.2 Encapsulation based HPM immobilization Compared with other immobilization techniques, the encapsulation technique resist the release of HPM stored inside the supporting material. The following technique is similar to entrapment, but it has an advantage for example resist contaminants and reduces formation of inhibitory compounds. The limitation such as inefficient supply of nutrients to HPM via membrane, and membrane fouling (Akinbomi et al., 2015). Gokfiliz and Karapinar (2017) have investigated the effect of three different synthetic material for the encapsulation of HPM to improve the treatability of synthetic wastewater under batch mode. Clostridium species was encapsulated with polyester fiber, stainless steel and bath sponge to increase hydrogen yield. This result in greater hydrogen yield compared with the control experiment as 1.96, 1.82 and 1.53 mol H2/mol glucose, respectively. Chang et al. (2005) have used synthetic polymer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with powdered activated carbon (PAC) as supporting material for encapsulation of HPM to improves the treatability. PVA based encapsulation techniques are cost effective, does not involve in chemical reaction, high physical stability, durable, and reusable. The limitation of PVA is its solubility and can be minimized by mixing it with PAC. Wu et al. (2005) have employed synthetic co-polymer ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulated with activated carbon for immobilization of HPM. The HPM and activated carbon was mixed with EVA in the ratio of 1:10. EVA based encapsulation was effective upto a substrate concentration of 20 g/L of sucrose and, it results in H2 production and yield of 392 mL H2/g VSS and 1.74 mol H2/mol sucrose, respectively and resulted in 3 folds increase in hydrogen production when compared with control. Akinbomi et al. (2015) have employed polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for encapsulation of HPM. Natural fruit flavoring agents such as hexanal, myrcene, and octanol were used as substrate for hydrogen production. This fruit flavoring agents are naturally organic rich and available in fruits such as mango, apple, plum, grape, orange, and strawberry. The hydrogen production observed for fruit flavoring agents are as follows as 189 mL H2/g COD for hexanal, 179 mL H2/g COD for myrcene and 198 mL H2/g COD for octanol. The effect of encapsulation based immobilized and suspended HPM for the production of H2 from beverage wastewater was investigated by Sivagurunathan et al. (2014). A green synthesized hybrid immobilized material and mixture of activated carbon in calcium-alginate, chitosan and wako gel were prepared. Among them, the green synthesized material (Ac-Si-Ch-Ca) encapsulated HPM shows higher hydrogen yield of 1.12 ± 0.04 mol H2/mol hexose, compared to suspended HPM (1.07 ± 0.01 mol H2/mol hexose). Similarly Sivagurunathan et al. (2015) have studied the effect of green synthesized material to treat the beverage wastewater using CSTR. They used encapsulated Clostridium species as hybrid immobilized material to achieve higher hydrogen yield of 1.5 mol H2/mol glucose. Kumar et al. (2015a) have used acid pretreated red-algal hydrolysate as substrate for hydrogen production. In anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR), where they used hybrid immobilization material (a mixture of activated carbon, sodium alginate, chitosan with calcium chloride) as a carrier for HPG. It results in maximum hydrogen production of 4.8 L/L d and shown maximum yield of 2.40 mol/mol hexoseadded at 50% of hydrolysate concentration. The synthetic polystyrene was used for encapsulation of Bacillus and Clostridium species under favorable anaerobic condition. The maximum hydrogen yield of 1.9 mol H2/mol glucose was achieved by feeding glucose as substrate in AFBR reactor (Barros et al., 2010). Based on the above it can be evident that, the encapsulation based immobilization of HPM was effective for hydrogen production. 2.1.3 Adsorption based HPM immobilization The mechanism of adsorption is based on an electrostatic force between HPM and the supporting material (Dagher et al., 2010). It results in promoting the HPM immobilization and biomass settlement. On the other hand, during adsorption the hydrodynamic condition in liquid phase leads to adhesion of microbes on the supporting surface which causes reduction in microbes shearing. Adhesion effect of HPM depends on the following factors such as ionic nature of HPM and supporting material, hydrophobic and hydrophilic interaction. Lee et al. (2004) have investigated the effect of activated carbon in two different configurations to enhance the biohydrogen yield in carrier induced granular sludge bed reactor. As a result, a hydrogen yield of 3.03 ± 0.2 mol H2/mol sucrose and 2.74 ± 0.15 mol H2/mol sucrose was achieved for cylindrical and spherical shaped activated carbon. Jo et al. (2008) have investigated the effect of positively charged poly urethane foam for the adsorption of HPM over its surface. The negative charge present in the microbial cells interacts with positively charged supporting materials, which increase the adhesion property. As a result, maximum hydrogen production rate was achieved and it accounts for 1.85 L/L h. Similarly Han et al. (2015) have investigated the effect of another positively charged material, i.e., granular activated carbon to enhance the biohydrogen production from food hydrolysate in CSTR. The effect of supporting material packing ratio was analyzed and obtained as 15%. The maximum hydrogen production rate was achieved as 0.35 L/L h. Zheng et al. (2008) have used plastic carrier in CSTR for the treatment of house hold waste under thermophilic condition. HPM attached over the surface of plastic carrier, has a maximum yield of 2.21 mol H2/mol glucose with longer HRT for 30 d. From the above it is evident that during adsorption negative charge present in the microbial cell surface gets firmly attached to positively charge supporting material leading to enhancement in the production of H2."
3,Low strength ultrasonication,"2.2 Low strength ultrasonication The term ultrasonication refers to applying sound energy in the liquid media, to generate micro air bubbles in the refraction zone and also to agitate microbial community (Cho et al., 2012; 2013a,b)). Application of ultrasonication in H2 production was classified into two categories namely high strength ultrasonication (HSU) and low strength ultrasonication (LSU). The HSU was predominantly used in pretreatment process, where it induce liquefaction of organic matter which results in improving the anaerobic biodegradability of substrate (Kavitha et al., 2015a). In low energetic sonic waves are used to improve the microbial activity and to prompt HPG formation. Besides, LSU can upgrade the settling characteristics of granules and its dewatering capacity (Zhang and Jin, 2015). Application of LSU during reactor operation can speed up the granulation process and induce changes in the morphological and rheology characteristics of microbes (Cho et al., 2013b; Yu et al., 2013). Elbeshbishy et al. (2011) have applied LSU (0.25 W/mL, 1 s per 1 min) to improve the activity of HPM in the CSTR for effective biohydrogen production. This results in a hydrogen yield of 1.9 mol H2/mol glucose and achieves substrate conversion efficiency of 84%. Cho et al. (2012) have investigated the application of LSU in granular formation in UASB reactor configuration. Under continuous supply of ultrasound (0.05 W/mL, 1 sec per 1 min) in UASB achieves 43% of higher gas production than the control. A similar kind ultrasonic condition was adopted by the researcher Cho et al. (2013a) for the production of hydrogen where the permeability of granules increased over 37% and the surface area over 2.3 times higher than control. Cho et al. (2013b) have compared the influence of LSU on granulation in UASB and dry digester. The applied LSU dosage for UASB and dry digestion, are 0.05 W/mL and 0.0025 W/mL, respectively. LSU positively increased the gas production upto 38% and 40% in UASB and dry digestion respectively. Cho et al. (2018) investigated the effect of LSU (0.1 W/mL) in USAB which significantly increase the hydrogen yield to 0.89 mol H2/mol hexose. From the above discussion, it is evident that the propagation of ultrasonic wave in the reactor happens to induces granular formation and enhance effective in mass transfer. HPG induced using LSU are capable of treating high strength organic waste with shorter HRT and results in high productivity rate (Milferstedt et al., 2017)."
4,Supporting materials,"2.3 Supporting materials Supporting materials is an essential tool for HPM immobilization, various types of inert and insoluble materials were used successfully by several researchers for effective immobilization leads to maximum hydrogen yield (Gokfiliz and Karapinar, 2017; Muri et al., 2018). Supporting materials are primarily categorized into inorganic and organic based on their chemical composition. Examples of inorganic supporting materials are activated charcoal, silica, clay, porous glass bed, plastic nylon sponge, and plastic scouring sponge (Martins et al., 2013). The organic supporting materials are further classified into natural and synthetic supporting materials. Natural materials include; volcanic stone, loofah sponge, agar, alginate , Mutag biochips, sea sponge (Gokfiliz and Karapinar, 2017). Synthetic materials include; ceramic stone, pumice stone stainless steel scrubber, tulle, polyvinyl alcohol, bath sponge, polyurethane, polyethylene, acrylamide, glycol, polypropylene, polycarbamoly sulfonates and polyvinyl fluoride (Gokfiliz and Karapinar, 2017; Keskin et al., 2011; Martins et al., 2013). The noble supporting materials must have following quality for effective hydrogen yield, such as i) wider and rough surface area ii) withstand harsh reactor environment and shock loads iii) permeability iv) with good thermal, mechanical and chemical stability v) reusable and cost effective vi) non-hazardous to HPM vii) good adhesion nature (Sekoai et al., 2018). Most commonly used supporting material for granular formation is granular activated carbon (GAC) is well known as a hydrophobic sorbent which create positive environment for HPM attachment (Jamali et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2008a). GAC was used as supporting material in AFBR for granulation where HPM such as Clostridium species were found to be attached to inert GAC. Biomass concentration attached over the surface GAC was estimated to be 34–36 g VSS/L (Zhang et al., 2008a). On worthy with different kind of substrate in AFBR, Zhang et al. (2008b) have obtained similar amount of hydrogen compared with previous study for a same quantity of biomass. Jamali et al. (2016) have suggested GAC is the best option to increase the volumetric hydrogen production when use to produce H2 from xylose and glucose in sequencing batch reactor. Using GAC they achieved H2 production rate of 2.4 mmol H2/L h and H2 content of 44.2%, respectively. Pekguzel et al. (2016) have investigated the effect of immobilization on glass beds for enhancing the biohydrogen production under thermophilic condition. The immobilized cells were introduced into the CSTR, with a substrate concentration of 10 g/L. It results in 42% higher volumetric hydrogen production in glass beds at shorter HRT of 3 h."
5,Characterization of hydrogen production granules,"Granulation is the slow process and during granulation microbial population in suspension are attached together to form a distinct shape (Liu et al., 2009; Song et al., 2017). The physiochemical characteristics of HPG s were tabulated in Table 1 . A good granular must hold following characteristics such as permeability, withstand reactor shock load, hydrogenase (microbial) activity, settling velocity, EPS, and size distribution, diameter and density(Liu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008c). The characteristics of granular depends on the reactor operation parameter such as organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), upflow velocity and biomass concentration (Gokfiliz-Yildiz and Karapinar, 2018; Xing et al., 2014). The general physiochemical characteristics of HPG, such as diameter, colour, density, ash and EPS content were considered in this review. Most commonly HPG are in white creamy colour, and is due to inhibition in the activity of sulfide microorganism, which resulted in change of colour from dark to white creamy (Salem et al., 2017). Biomass washout at lower HRT, is the main parameter that decrease the activity of sulfide bacteria in dark fermentation. Similar mechanism was proposed by other researchers for colour change in HPG. Several other literatures also propose the same reason for dark colour inoculum turn to creamy white at various reactor configuration (Liu et al., 2001; Mu and Yu 2006). The settling velocity may be varying with respect to granular dimension. The settling velocity of granules is highly dependent and directly proportional to the density of the granules. According to Milferstedt et al. (2017) the average diameter, settling velocity and density of HPG might be 1.6 mm, 50 m/h and 1.038 g/mL, respectively. The average ash and water content of HPG could in the range of 9 ± 2% and 90 ± 1% respectively. Sheng et al. (2010) have reported that EPS act as a protective layer for granule and is made out of protein and carbohydrate. Ratio between protein and carbohydrate in total EPS of HPG ranges between 0.2 and 2.0."
6,Reactor type and process performance of HPGs,"3.1 Reactor type and process performance of HPGs Several literatures have reported that the granular biomass achieves maximum hydrogen yield compare with suspended biomass (Keskin et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2010). The successful operation of high rate anaerobic reactor with HPG depends on factors such as substrate concentration (Gokfiliz-Yildiz and Karapinar, 2018), biomass washout, microbial growth condition (Kanniah Goud et al., 2017), proper selection of supporting material (Gokfiliz and Karapinar, 2017) , reactor configuration (Khan and Kana, 2016) reactor start up, organic loading rate and substrate conversion efficiency (Guo et al., 2008;Zhang et al., 2008a). Liu et al. (2001) have studied the performances of HPG and substrate conversion using CSTR, where granulation was induced by pretreating anaerobic sludge under acidic pH condition. The maximum substrate conversion rate and hydrogen content were observed to be 98.9% and 68%, respectively at 14.3 g sucrose/L h of OLR and 13.7 h of HRT. Zhang et al. (2008a) have studied the effect of substrate conversion rate in HPG at varying HRT of UASB where granulation was induced by pretreating anaerobic sludge under acidic pH condition and immobilizing it with GAC. The maximum substrate conversion rate and hydrogen content were observed to be 99.3% and 64%, respectively at 40 g glucose/L h of OLR and 0.5 h of HRT. Future increase in HRT from 0.5 h to 2 h, resulted an insignificant difference in substrate conversion rate and hydrogen content. The hydrogen production rate was found to be increased with decrease in HRT. A maximum hydrogen production rate of 6.98 L/L h was recorded at 0.25 h HRT. However there was a reduction in substrate conversion efficiency, hydrogen content and H2 yield of 77%, 43% and 1.66 mol/mol observed at this HRT. It shows 0.5 h HRT was efficient for H2 production in reactor employing HPG. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2008b) have evaluated the performance of HPG in the AFBR reactor at varying HRT from 0.125 to 3 h. They recorded a maximum substrate conversion at 0.5 HRT. Another critical parameter is pH, which plays a significant role in hydrogen yield. Acid synthesized during hydrogen fermentation with high OLR leads to system upset by lower the pH from 5.5. Addition of strong alkali and buffering agents such as sodium bicarbonate were commonly used to resist the changes in pH during H2 production in HPG reactor. The maximum substrate conversion rate and hydrogen content were observed to be 80% and 48%, respectively at 30 g glucose/L h of OLR and 0.25 h of HRT. Guo et al. (2008) have reported that optimal pH for HPG depends upon the nature of microbial communities in the granules and the operational parameter of the reactor. As stated earlier high substrate concentration could result in pH drop, growth of HPM in low pH is hindered and this resulted in low H2 production. The maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen content were observed to be 0.71 L/L h and 53%, respectively at 10 g sucrose/L h of OLR and 2 h of HRT. Chang et al. (2002) have studied the performance of fixed bed (FB) reactor using two different supporting material such as granular activated carbon (GAC) and expanded clay. Maximum hydrogen production rate was achieved in GAC- FB as 1.32 L/L h with 87.3% of substrate conversion efficiency. In expanded clay - FB at converts 97.1% substrate and achieves 0.415 L/L h of hydrogen production. CSTR was employed for analyzing the performance of HPG by the researcher Fang et al. (2002) reported that 97% of substrate was converted into biogas and it consist 63% of hydrogen. Following condition were arrived as optimum condition for development of HPG and it includes pH – 5.5, temperature – 26 °C, HRT – 6 h and substrate concertation – 12.15 g/L. At the optimum condition CSTR, effectively produce 0.54 L/L/h of hydrogen and hydrogen yield of 0.28 L H2/g sucrose. Similarly kind of work has been carried out by Zhao et al. (2012) to study the performance of granular in CSTR where they used Mycelia pellets as supporting material used for HPG formation. The optimum conditions for granular formation include pH - 5.5, temperature - 37 °C, HRT – 10 h and substrate concertation - 10 g/L. In order to resist the pH drop caused by acid fermentation, 6 M of NaOH a strong alkali was added automatically. A maximum 85% of xylose get degraded and get covered into biogas. The H2 content in the biogas was founded to be 59.6%. From the above comparison, it is clear that HPG in CSRT requires longer HRT than other reactor configuration. CSTR was ineffective in biological hydrogen production at high biomass loading with shorter HRT. On the other hand granular in USAB requires shorter HRT and with high substrate concentration for the effective production of biohydrogen. From the above, it is clear that performance of HPG is also depend on the reactor configuration and operational conditions. According to Ghimire et al. (2016) hydrogen partial pressure has greater influence on the biohydrogen yield and substrate mass transfer in bioreactor during dark fermentation. Salem et al. (2017) have reported the influence of partial pressure on hydrogen yield. They achieved an increment in biohydrogen production by increasing the hydrogen partial pressure inside the CSTR."
7,Microbiome involved in granulation and stabilization,"Granulae formation depends on the physical, chemical and biological nature of microbiome involved in the process. Bio-granular formation is due to cell-to-cell interaction and the stability may get affected due to the following forces such as electrostatic force, van de waals force, and repulsive forces. Anaerobic granular formation usually requires longer startup period when compared with aerobic granular. However, the stability of anaerobic granular is much stronger than aerobic (Liu et al., 2004a). It has a regular shape, good settling property, dense and strong structural characteristics. Table 2 . depicts the influence of microbiome involved in HPG formation and stabilization Typically, granules are made up of spore forming, rod shape bacilli. Microbiome involved in HPG formation are grouped into three categories: (i) Anaerobic fermentative bacteria: Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella (ii) Mesophilic bacteria: C. acetobutylicum, C. butyricum, B. coagulans. (iii) Thermophilic bacteria: T. thermosaccharolyticum, Thermatoga neapolitana, C. thermocellum (Maintinguer et al., 2011; Long et al., 2010; Seifert et al., 2012). Milferstedt et al. (2017) have arrived different models for microbial granular stability. Among them first set are based upon granules physio chemical properties such as models are ECP bonding model, inert nuclei model, multi-valence positive ion-bonding model, polymer-bonding model, local dehydration and hydrophobic interaction model, surface tension model, selection pressure model and secondary minimum adhesion model. The second set of models is based on the microbial characteristics and is grouped as structural models. It includes Capetown’s model, Syntrophic micro colony model, proton translocation-dehydration theory and cellular automation model, Spaghetti model and cell-to-cell communication model. Biohydrogen production from different substrates such as starch (Cabrol et al., 2017), xylose and glucose (Lo et al., 2008) pointed out presence of Streptococcus sp. improves the process of granulation during dark fermentation specifically when the systems are functioned under low HRTs. Streptococccus sp. (cocci) is capable of producing extra polysaccharides substances which speed-up the hydrogenase production as well as the formation of granulation and it upsurge the strength and stability of granules. Bacterium such as Enterobacter sp. (Long et al., 2010), Clostridium sp. and Klebsiella sp. (Maintinguer et al., 2011). are most predominant bacteria popular in HPG and they play a vital part in the formation of granules. Klebsiella sp (Hung et al., 2011) consume the oxygen and make the environment into an anaerobic condition which enables the hydrogen production. Mixed or pure culture of microorganisms is used by the researchers for the formation of HPG. Among them, mixed cultures induce greater production of hydrogen than pure culture. Abreu et al. (2010) have identified that Klebsiella sp. a favourable microbe in contact with the thermally treated granules contributes to more stable and hydrogen production in EGSB reactor systems. The mixed cultures show the tendency/resistant towards toxicity by various contaminants and also capable of utilizing vast kind of substrates. In some cases, the presence of methanogens and acetogenic bacteria in mixed culture reduces the production of hydrogen. High temperature could suppress the H2 consuming bacteria, hence rod shaped thermophilic species are more found in HPG (Li and Yu, 2011). In contrast Nath et al. (2005) have reported that pure cultures shows higher hydrogen production when compare to mixed culture and this could be due to the presence of undesirable bacterial population in the mixed culture. Proper pretreatment such as thermal or chemicals inhibit such undesirable organisms and enhance hydrogen production in mixed culture (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016). For example Akutsu et al. (2009) have used heat pretreated methanogenic granule to form HPG with good settling property. The proposed heat pretreatment suppress the activity of methanogenic and it changes the black colour granular into creamy white. Salem et al. (2017) have reported that organic loading rate (OLR) plays a major role in the formation and stabilization of HPG. Bioreactors operated under low OLR, provide insufficient supply of substrate to HPM. This leads to destabilize or even destructing the granules. Ueno et al. (2001) have stated that irrespective of H2 yield microorganisms involved in the hydrogen production may vary between batch and continuous process. According to Ning et al. (2013), the hydrogen granulation is divided into three phases. In first phase, organism starts up the granulation process with less hydrogen production. In second phase, granules form in tiny size with gradual increase in hydrogen production. Then in third phase, the size of the granule increased and stabilized, the production of hydrogen also increases. They also found out matured hydrogen granules were dominated with follow bacterium namely Janthinobacterium sp., Clostridium sp., Variovorax sp., and V. paradoxus. Recently it was proved that techniques such as entrapment, adsorption, encapsulation and containment with natural/synthetic polymers of cell immobilization happens to aid granulation and hydrogen production (Kumar et al., 2016; Sekoai et al., 2018). Lee et al. (2011) have reported that Clostridia sp.immobilized with mixed culture in the formation of granules would retain the biomass to achieve maximum hydrogen production. Supporting material act as an inert nuclei and it induce the formation of granules (Lutpi et al., 2015). Yet another technique, LSU were demonstrated in granulation for hydrogen production in UASB reactor system (Cho et al., 2018). Applying LSU increases the pore size of granular, which allows substrate pass through the granules leading to greater production of hydrogen. Researchers have suggested different molecular techniques for identification microbial community involved in HPG formation and stabilization. Park et al. (2018) have monitored the growth of HPM community by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). And found Clostridium butyricum species as a dominant bacterium for biohydrogen production in CSTR treating fermented liquor. Under this condition hydrogen yield of CSTR was found to be 2.8 mol H2/mol glucose. Similarly Park et al. (2017) have examined the growth of HPM community using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques. Upon qPCR investigation, it was found that Clostridium butyricum species was a dominant bacterium in HPG. By using these Clostridium butyricum enriched HPG, they achieved a hydrogen yield of 2.98 mol H2/mol glucose. Badiei et al. (2012) have investigated the growth of HPM community using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The analysis confirmed HPM was populated with 50% of Streptococcus, 30% of Lactobacillus and 20% Clostridium species. In addition to this, the researcher have carried out morphology study using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis to confirm the presence of above mentioned species."
8,Role of EPS and other polymers in biogranulation,"The physical characteristics of HPG such as density, stability and settleability are due to its extra polymeric substances (EPS) content. EPS plays a vital role in upholding the structural and functional integrity of granules. EPS - a complex mixture of macromolecules such as polysaccharide, proteins, lipids, etc. EPS act as binding agent and grouped microorganism together to form granules. According to Lim and Kim (2014) EPS are biosynthetic polymers and it take part in microbial aggregation, which leads to the formation of bio granules. EPS is an organic polymer of microbial origin and it binds cells with particulate matter (cohesion) and substrate (adhesion) (Ding et al., 2015). Lu et al. (2015) have reported that the EPS content could act as gel which contributes more in microbial adhesion on granule formation. The EPS content could strengthen the granule and improve the settling characteristics. Presence of high EPS content would give more stable to maintain the structural integrity of granules in the reactor. Zhou et al. (2006) have revealed that charges of biomass and EPS are essential for the formation of bio granules. Sheng et al. (2010) have reported that the EPS related with microbial metabolism influences the formation granules. EPS subdivided into Bound EPS (Sheath, polymers, loosely bound polymers and attached organic materials) and Soluble EPS (soluble macromolecules, slimes and colloids) where Bound EPS are strongly adhered with cells, while soluble EPS are loosely bounded with in cells (Kannah et al., 2017; Kavitha et al., 2018; 2015b, 2017). In anaerobsic granules, maximum EPS contents are present in the external layer (soluble EPS), then remaining contents are present inside the bio granules (bound EPS) (Banu et al., 2018). McSwain et al. (2005) detected the presence of protein in inner side, where carbohydrates are distributed in the outer side of granules. Substrate transfer efficiency in granules can be decreased by EPS as it clogs pores in granules. Mu and Yu (2006) have observed that presence of high EPS content affects the permeability of bio granules. Normally, the surface charge of a microorganism is negative and this entails EPS, a positive charge substance to form stable granules. The surface charge of microbial aggregates can be influenced by the composition of substance present in EPS as many charged functional groups present in it. In granulation, the protein content in EPS shows a negative impact on the net surface charge of granules and DNA content in EPS had no influence on surface charges of granules. EPS is also responsible for the stability of granules and cell interactions. The term stability refers to the ability of granules to resist hydrodynamic and mechanical shear. Torres et al. (2018) have stated that the stability of granules mainly depends on the ion bridging through EPS, electrostatic interaction between cells, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction. Shi et al. (2017) have found out that the high EPS content could impact on increasing the greater stability of bio granules. Zhu et al. (2015) stated that the process of granulation and maintenance of granule structure are mainly due to the content and composition of EPS. Cell surface hydrophobicity, cell charge dictate the concentration, composition and physical characteristics of EPS in granules (Liao et al., 2001). The cell surface hydrophobicity is related with the presence of fibrillary structures on the cell surface and specific cell wall proteins (Singleton et al., 2001). Liu et al. (2004b) have reported that the cell surface hydrophobicity has been deliberated as activating force for granulation. Liu et al. (2004b) have proved that hydrophobic property of cell would supports the cell to cell interaction that favors for the formation of dense and stable granules. EPS provide greater surface area for microorganism during bio granule formation. Punal et al. (2003) have identified protein concentration in EPS plays a vital role in granulation and stated that the presence of EPS concentration in anaerobic bio granules is almost three folds higher than anaerobic bio flocs. Fang et al. (2002) have compared the EPS concentration in hydrogen producing granules with methanogenic granules. The author stated that the total EPS content in hydrogenic granule (179 mg EPS/g VSS), is higher than methanogenic granule (10 – 91 mg EPS/g VSS). Presence of protein in EPS plays a major role in the formation of methanogenic granules while carbohydrates are the main components in the formation of hydrogen producing granules. Mu and Yu (2006) have found out that hydrogen producing granule contain more carbohydrates (115.6 ± 5.2 mg) than protein (70.9 ± 4.5 mg). Protein content in EPS get adsorbed with the negative charge substance in biomass which increase zeta potential and leads to the quick formation of granulation (Wang et al., 2017). Kim et al. (2014) thought that EPS could significantly contribute to the strength and stability of granules. Wang et al. (2005) narrated the importance of EPS in granulation as it concentration increase with cultivation time at early stage and stabilized, after the granules gets matured. The following processes: hydrophobic interactions, polymer entangling and ion bridging interactions are used to bind cells closely with EPS to enhance and promote the bio granules formation. Environmental condition variations may modify the EPS production while the organisms need to adapt the changing environment. Often the prevailing microbial consortium normalizes the metabolic pathway in EPS production for changing in environmental conditions. Kim et al. (2005) used synthetic polymers such as cationic polyacrylamide and anionic silica for granule sludge formation. By adding those polymers, the author stated that the formation of granule is rapid within five mins with stable size ranged from 1 to 3 mm. The author found out content of EPS in one gram of hydrogen granule was 179.1 mg, and it account for 61.9% carbohydrates, 14.4% protein and the remaining are other substances. Other than hydrogen producing species some non-hydrogen producing organism Streptococcus is found that secrete lavish EPS which accelerate the granule formation with the hydrogen producing organism."
9,Overview and future outlooks on biogranules production and its application,"The several advantages of HPG‘s drawn the attention of researchers to discover the cost effective biogranular formation technique, and microbes involved in the granular process. HPG formed by immobilization of HPM under a favourable anaerobic environment with the selective supporting material. EPS bounded over the surface of HPG, which act as a protective layer. On the other hand, recent updates in the formation of HPG by applying LSU were successful in the lab-scale study. Several researchers have successfully applied HPG‘s for the effective harvesting of biohydrogen in lab scale with different anaerobic reactor configuration (Anzola-Rojas et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2011; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). Both developed and developing countries are focusing towards treating high strength industrial wastewater using granular based reactors. In many industries sucessfully employed pilot scale UASB for treating high strength organic waste (Chen et al., 2017; Niwa et al., 2016; Watari et al., 2017). Recently, expanded granular bed reactor (EGBR) was developed as a cost-effective treatment technology for biohydrogen production (Guo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015). It can be also applicable for harsh environment condition and susbatnce with inhibitory compounds (Song et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2012). In the developing countries, the application of HPG‘s in pilot scale has yet to be developed. Following are the limitation of HPG; longer granulation and maturation period, poor knowledge about HPG molecular mechanism, ineffective in nutrient removal and economic feasibility (Milferstedt et al., 2017). Whereas developing countries are improving the technology to next step, through various research attempts in the field of metabolic engineering to improve the hydrogen production. Metabolic engineering mainly involves genetic modification of HPM and metabolic pathway of substrate conversion. This kind of modification will improves the microbial activity to recover renewable energy from organic waste. In future, the application of granular based reactors for treating high strength wastewater will be commonly employed for both domestic and industrial treatment plants. Because it has a more positive impact on increasing the energy production and decreasing the greenhouse gas emission."
10,Conclusion,Accelerated production of hydrogen via treating high strength organic waste achieved by HPG propoitious towards sustainable biohydrogen economy. The present review highlighted the recent technological developments in the formation of HPG under favourable anaerobic condition with suitable operational parameters and mechanisms. Further developments in new aspects of HPG formations and reactor configuration are recommended as future directions.
