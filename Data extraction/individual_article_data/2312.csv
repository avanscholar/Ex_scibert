0,Introduction,"Climate change, dwindling fossil fuel supplies and economic security are the principal reasons driving an intense global research effort into finding alternative energy supplies. These efforts are focused on developing thermal, chemical and biological processes. Several full-scale biological processing facilities are in-place and others are currently under development to produce biofuels from renewable materials [1,2]. Biofuels are eco-friendly, biodegradable and they can be produced from a wide variety of renewable agriculture resources [3]. Among the different biofuels, hydrogen (H2) is emerging as a strong contender because it has the highest energy content per unit weight and it produces water when combusted [4]. Hydrogen is considered to be an ideal energy alternative because it can be produced from renewable resources and its impact on the environment is negligible [5]. The heating value (142.4 kJ g−1) of H2 is approximately 2.5 times that of methane (55.6 kJ g−1) [6]. Biological H2 production processes are classified as light dependent or light independent. Under the light dependent classification, processes are grouped as direct and indirect biophotolysis. During direct biophotolysis, H2 is produced from H2O in the presence of light. In the indirect biophotolysis category, carbohydrates which are produced from CO2 fixation in the first stage are converted into H2 in the second stage. In the photofermentation category, the degradation of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria (photofermentation) is mediated by purple bacteria while during the dark process, H2 is produced from the oxidation of reduced carbon compounds [7]. According to Benemann [8], using waste organic material to produce H2 via dark fermentation route could be attractive. When organic compounds are the only carbon and energy source, the process is denoted as dark H2 fermentation. In mixed anaerobic communities, H2 production is mediated by a consortium of microorganisms [9]. During dark fermentation, H2 is produced from the degradation of organic compounds by H2-producers. The H2 fermentative process has the advantage of high H2 production rates [10] and it can utilize a variety of substrates [4]. The composition of the mixed microbial consortia is a major factor influencing the H2 yield during the dark fermentation process. Many pure strains of acidogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Bacillus and Clostridium have been reported to generate H2 [9]. Hydrogen production by the dark fermentation route using pure cultures is uneconomical and it is associated with many technical problems such as the requirement for sterile conditions and strict control of the environmental conditions [11]. In addition, many pure culture microorganisms cannot metabolize a variety of substrates such as starch and cellulose. Therefore, the selection of a mixed H2 producing microbial consortium offers distinct advantages such as increasing H2 yield and the ability to utilize starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose [11]. A major drawback with using mixed anaerobic microbial communities is the presence of non-H2 producers such as lactic acid bacteria and H2 consuming populations such as homoacetogens, hydrogenotrophic methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria [12]. Many reports have described attempts to control the growth of non-H2 producers and H2-consumers by heat shock, acid treatment, alkali treatment, 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA) addition, aeration, sonication and long chain fatty acids (LCFA) addition [13–18]. The type of treatment method is known to affect the extent of the inhibition imposed on the growth of H2-consumers and H2-producers. Hydrogen-producers are composed of spore and non-spore forming microorganisms and the growth inactivation mechanism of a particular stressing agent on a microbial community will not be the same for different treatment methods. Many studies have shown that methanogenic growth can be controlled by heat treatment [19]. However, the effectiveness on heat treatment on specific anaerobic populations is dependent on the severity of the treatment conditions. The H2 yield is significantly affected by temperature and the duration of heat treatment [20]. Heat treatment not only destroys or inactivates methanogens but non-spore forming H2-producers are also affected to varying extent [21]. In addition to heat, the H2 yield is also affected by acid or alkali treatment [16]. The effect of heat, acid or alkali treatment on the H2 yield is variable because of the different growth inhibition mechanisms imposed by each stressing agent. Changes in microbial metabolic pathways due to different agents have been documented in studies by Mu et al. [16]. These researchers showed that the byproduct distribution profiles are affected by the method used to treat an incoulum. In addition to heat, alkali and inorganic acids, anaerobic H2 consuming microorganisms are affected by organic acids such as long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) [13,15,17,18]. For example, Ray et al. [15] reported that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are inhibited by linoleic acid (LA). In studies conducted by pretreating mixed anaerobic cultures with LA, Ray et al. [15] reported relatively high H2 yields reaching approximately 2.4 mol mol−1 glucose. In comparison to studies using LA, H2 yields reaching approximately 3 mol mol−1 hexose have been reported for heat-shocked cultures [14]. No comparative work of using LA to control the growth of H2-consumers with treatment methods such as heat and acid has been reported. Hence, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of heat shock, acid treatment, alkali treatment and LA addition on a mixed anaerobic culture by comparing the H2 yield."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Culture treatment and bottle preparation,"2.1 Culture treatment and bottle preparation Anaerobic inoculum was provided by an ethanol manufacturing facility (Guleph, ON). The major microbial composition of the anaerobic inoculum sampled from the ethanol manufacturing facility included the following: 26% Archea, 10% Bacteroidaceae, 12% Bacillaceae, 33% Clostridiaceae, 6% Enterobacteriaceae, 6% Geobacteriaceae and 5% Methylobacteriaceae [22]. The inocula was subjected to the following treatment method: a) Heat-shock: autoclaving at 90 °C for 30 min; b) Acid treatment: adding 2.0 M HCl and adjusted to pH 3.0 then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h; c) Alkali treatment: adding 3.0 M NaOH and adjusted to pH 11.0 then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and d) Adding 2000 mg L−1 LA and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After treatment, the pH was adjusted to 5.5 using 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH. All experiments were conducted in 160 mL serum bottles. Each bottle was filled with 50 mL of basal media plus culture (2000 mg L−1 VSS) in an anaerobic glove box (COY® Laboratory Products Inc., MI) under a 70% N2 30% CO2 (Praxair Inc. ON) atmosphere. After pH adjustment, the bottles were left undisturbed for 5 min to allow the solids to settle. A known volume of liquid supernatant was removed from the bottles and an equivalent volume of glucose stock solution (100,000 mg L−1) was added to all the serum bottles. In the LA treated cultures, an additional liquid volume was removed and replaced with an equivalent volume of LA stock solution. The LA stock solution was prepared by melting LA (Sigma Aldrich, ON) au bain-marie in hot NaOH [23] and the 100,000 mg L−1 glucose stock solution was prepared by dissolving glucose (ACP Chemicals Inc., QC) in Milli-Q water."
3,Batch studies,"2.2 Batch studies The bottles containing the treated cultures and controls (without any treatment) were incubated at 37 °C and shaken at 200 rpm. Gas, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol were monitored over specified time intervals for 3 days. The basal medium used for dilution had a pH value of 8.0–8.2 and contained the following ingredients (mg L−1 of medium) (Spectrum Chemicals, CA): NaHCO3, 6000; NH4 HCO3, 70; KCl, 25; K2HPO4, 14; (NH4)2SO4, 10; Yeast extract, 10; MgCl2.4H2O, 9; FeCl2.4H2O, 2; Resazurin, 1; EDTA (ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid), 1; MnCl2.4H2O, 0.5; CoCl2.6H2O, 0.15; NaSeO3, 0.1; (NH4)6MoO7.4H2O, 0.09; ZnCl2, 0.05; H3BO3, 0.05; NiCl2.6H2O, 0.05; CuCl2.2H2O, 0.03 (adapted from Weigant and Lettinga [24],). All batch experiments in 150 mL serum bottles were conducted in triplicate."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Liquid samples (0.5 mL) were withdrawn from the batch serum bottle reactors at specified intervals. Each 0.5 mL aliquot was diluted with 4.5-mL of deionized water and centrifuged at 1,200 g for 5 min. The centrate samples were filtered using a 0.45 μm polypropylene membrane (GE Osmonics, MN) and a 100–200 mesh ion exchange resin (Chelex 100, Bio- Rad, CA) to remove suspended solids and heavy metals, respectively. The samples were analyzed for VFA and alcohol using a Dionex-600 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) ion chromatograph (IC). For VFA analysis, the IC was configured with a conductivity (CD 20) detector and an IonPac AS11-HC column while for alcohols an electrochemical (ED 50) detector was used together with a 25 cm × 4-mm CarboPac™ MA-1 column [25]. The three eluents used for VFA analysis were deionized water (Eluent A), 5 mM NaOH sodium hydroxide (Eluent B) and 50 mM NaOH sodium hydroxide (Eluent C). The eluent flow rate (as a percent of the total flow of 1 mL min−1) were as follows: 0–2 min, 93% A, 7% B; 2–6 min, A ramped from 93 to 0%, B from 7 to 100%; 6–9 min, B ramped from 100 to 50%, C ramped from 0 to 50%, and then held until 9.99 min; and from 10 to 17 min, 93% A, 7% B. The detection limits for acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid were 2 mg L−1. The eluent for alcohol analysis was 480 mM NaOH and the flow rate was set at 0.4 mL min−1. The detection limits for alcohols was 5.0 mg L−1. Headspace gas samples (25 μL) were periodically withdrawn using a 50 μL gastight syringe (Hamilton Syringes, Reno, NV) and analyzed using a Varian-3600 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) gas chromatograph (GC) configured with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2-m long × 2-mm I.D. Carbon Shin column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) was used for conducting the analysis. The GC injector, detector and oven temperatures were set at 100 °C, 200 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The nitrogen carrier gas flow rate was set at 10 mL min−1. The detection limit for H2 was 0.0032 kPa [5 μL bottle−1 (160 mL)]."
5,Tukey's test,"2.4 Tukey's test A one way ANOVA was conducted to assess pair wise multiple comparisons of the means for the various treatment methods (Box et al. [26]). The statistical analysis was performed using Origin Pro 8 software (Northampton, MA, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,"Hydrogen production was observed in the controls and treated cultures (Table 1 ). A one way ANOVA was conducted to determine statistical differences between the individual means [26]. Based on statistical differences, the H2 production trend for the different treatment methods was as follows: LA ≅ acid ≅ heat ≅ alkali > control. The ANOVA analysis clearly indicate that the H2 yield for cultures treated with LA, heat, acid and alkali were statistically different from the controls at an α = 0.05 (Table 2 ). The mean difference of H2 yield for the heat, LA, acid and alkali treated cultures were statistically the same at α = 0.05 (Table 2). The methane yield for the controls and cultures treated with alkali was 0.4 and 0.1 mol mol−1 glucose, respectively. The final pH range for the controls and treated cultures was 4.7–5.1. Low pH conditions were likely the cause for the low methane yield in the control cultures. Methane production was not detected in the acid, heat or LA treated cultures (Table 1). In the treated cultures, except those receiving alkali treatment, methanogenic inhibition was due to heat or chemical addition (acid or LA). The percent of electron equivalence in the byproducts and biomass growth (assuming 10% from the amount of glucose consumed) accounted for greater than 95% of the electrons produced by the quantity of glucose consumed (Table 3 ). The acetic acid pathway was dominant in the alkali treated and control cultures (Table 3). In the alkali treated and control cultures, acetic acid contributed 31% and 24% of the total electron equivalences from the electron donor, respectively (Table 3). The lower H2 yield observed for the alkali and heat treated cultures is likely attributed to the acetic acid production by homoacetogenic microorganisms (reaction 1). Evidence by Ren et al. [27], has shown low H2 yield for an alkali treated culture in comparison to the control cultures. In comparison, Zhu and Beland [14] reported higher H2 yields in alkali treated cultures in comparison to the controls. (1) 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 3 COO − + H + + 2 H 2 O Δ G 0 ′ = − 95 .0 ( kJ mol − 1 ) The quantity of lactic acid produced in cultures treated with alkali, the controls and acid treatment was 720, 600 and 490 mg L−1, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Only negligible amounts of lactic acid (20 mg L−1) were observed in cultures receiving LA. Ethanol was not observed in the controls and alkali cultures. However, relative to acetic acid and butyric acid, lower ethanol levels ranging from 3% to 6% was detected in the heat-shocked, acid and LA treated cultures. Butyric acid type fermentation was dominant in cultures, which were treated with heat (1380 mg L−1), acid (1300 mg L−1) or LA (1200 mg L−1) (Fig. 1). Formic acid was not detected in the heat-shocked or acid treated cultures. However, elevated quantities were detected in the controls (700 mg L−1) as well as the LA (200 mg L−1) and alkali (70 mg L−1) treated cultures. Propionic acid was not observed in significant amounts with or without culture treatment. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine the main differences between the treated cultures. The quantity of volatile fatty acids and ethanol produced were used as inputs for the PCA. The PCA (Fig. 2 ) clearly indicate that all the treated cultures were different with respect to the two components (VFAs and alcohol). Notice none of the treated cultures were the same as the controls. Principal component (PC) 1 and PC 2 contributed to more than 80% of the total variability in the data set with PC 1 accounting for approximately 60% of the variability in the variance. PC 3 and PC 4 accounted for 11.5% and 6.25%, respectively. Lactic acid, butyric acid and ethanol were the major contributors for PC 1 (23.9%, 20.4% and 20.6%, respectively) (Table 4 ). For PC 2, formic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid contributed 51.7% 20.7% and 17.6%, respectively (Table 4). The LA and heat-shock cultures are more closely related compared to the other cultures (Fig. 2). Larger differences were observed between the controls and the heat-shocked, acid and LA treated cultures relative to cultures treated with alkali. Note the controls were more closely related to alkali treated cultures when compared to cultures treated with heat or pH. The PCA confirmed that different treatment methods resulted in different byproducts distribution profiles during H2 fermentation. This is further supported by the electron mass balance, which showed the electron fluxes were diverted into the formation of byproducts with different profiles."
7,Conclusions,"Several reports have described the impact of inoculum treatment on H2 yields [14,16,27]; however; to date, conflicting trends in the various data set persists in the literature. Chemical treatment using LA is another method which can be considered for optimizing H2 production when using mixed anaerobic microbial communities. Treating an inoculum with heat, acid, alkali or LA are effective methods for increasing the H2 yield in mixed anaerobic cultures. The H2 yield trend based on the treatment method was as follows: LA ≅ acid ≅ heat-shock ≅ alkaline > control. Methanogenic activity was suppressed by heat, acid and LA treatments. However, methanogenesis was observed in the controls and alkaline treated cultures. Acetic acid, butyric acid and ethanol type fermentation was observed in cultures treated with LA or heat while acetic acid, butyric acid and lactic acid type fermentation was dominant in the controls and cultures treated with acid or alkali. A PCA showed that cultures treated with LA or heat was similar while the acid, alkali and control cultures were not closely related. Two (PC 1 and PC 2) of the four principal components accounted for more than 80% to the variability in the data set."
