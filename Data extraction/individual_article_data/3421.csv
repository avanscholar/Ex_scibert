0,Introduction,"Energy security is becoming more important and is one of the worldwide governmental issues. Currently, combustion of conventional fuels such as gasoline and diesel account for more than half the world's primary energy consumption [1–4]. With the increasing cost of fossil oil and global warming continuing to be a dominant environmental concern, it seems that the use of alternative fuels in the future is inevitable. It commonly known that fossil fuels are energy sources that are non-renewable [5]. Alcohols have a long history of approximately 100 years as fuels in internal combustion engines (ICE). Alcohol based fuels may have been regarded as one of the renewable solutions, with a potential to be used in a near CO2-neutral manner through efficient conversion of biomass. Utilizing alcohol as a fuel in transportation especially in light cars is not new [6,7] but lately begun to interest significant worldwide attention. Alcohols such as ethanol, butanol, methanol, and fusel oil and ethers (methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and Dimethyl Ether (DME)) are used as fuels in ICE [8–11]. First generation alcohols for Spark Ignition (SI) applications have so far largely been based on gasoline-ethanol blends, where current fuel quality standards typically allow between 5–10% inclusions of ethanol within an existing gasoline pool. Methanol was used as vehicle fuel during the 1930s to replace gasoline supplies for high performance engine [12,13]. Methanol (CH3OH) is the chemically simplest alcohol, with single carbon atom per molecule. Methanol is toxic, tasteless liquid, colorless, and generally known as “wood alcohol"" [13]. It has many benefits that distinguish it as an attractive alternative fuel over oil fuels. The first is low cost and it can be produced from several ways such as synthesis gas (mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) that is produced by steam reforming of natural gas, gasification of coal, as well as a production of biomass, all of that are available in abundance or regeneration [14]. The production cost of methanol is around half of the cost of petroleum fuels in Canada. Even though the value is in comparison with the equivalent energy, it is quite low than that of gasoline. The second is low exhaust emission. In addition, due to the lower boiling point of methanol, the fuel will evaporate faster and this is advantageous to engine combustion and thereby, hydrocarbon emissions will be decreased. Furthermore, the high oxygen content of methanol and simple chemical structure can lead to lower emissions and better engine combustion in spark ignition engines [15,16]. Ethanol is a renewable and attentive fuel commonly produced from biological material through fermentation processes [17,18]. Ethanol was first submitted as an internal combustion engine fuel by the 1930s in the USA and became commonly used since 1970 [19]. Furthermore, in the 1930s, the government of Brazil stimulated gasoline blended with 5% bioethanol [20]. Due to the first oil crisis in 1973, Brazil decided to establish the national alcohol program (NAP) to reduce its reliance on fossil oil [21]. Currently, ethanol is used as fuel, especially in Brazil, while in Canada, the USA, and India. Also, ethanol is used as a gasoline additive to increase the octane rating and improve engine combustion [22,23]. In 2014, the USA was the world׳s largest ethanol fuel producer, around 60% of ethanol global output, while approximately 23.47 billion liter were produced by Brazil which represents 25% of the global production. On the other hand, the European Union only produced 6% of the global production. China and Canada were the other leading producers. Fig. 1 shows the global ethanol production by country, from 2007 to 2015 as shown the production increased dramatically from 2007 until 2010, while the largest production was in 2015 after a dropped in 2011 and 2012 [24]. Due to the issues of gasoline cost and emission regulations that are becoming more stringent, ethanol could be given more attention as a renewable fuel also to enhance the oxygen and octane value. Intensive study has been done to ensure high ignition temperatures, higher research octane number, lower freezing point, higher heat of vaporization, and low Reid evaporation pressure (REP) of ethanol compared with gasoline [25,26]. So far, experimental studies [27–31] have claimed that the blending of methanol and ethanol decreases the engine emissions compared to fossil fuel especially gasoline. Mainly, in these experimental investigations, the engine emissions have been associated with the oxygen content of methanol and ethanol. It is well-known that the chemical and physical properties of methanol or ethanol are quite different compared to gasoline, especially the heating value which is lower than gasoline. This property explains that the engine will need more quantity of ethanol or methanol blends to give the same engine power compared to gasoline. Also, the octane number of ethanol and methanol is higher than gasoline and the boiling point of alcohols is usually lower than gasoline. Butanol or butyl alcohol is a four-carbon atom alcohol (C4H9OH) that can be used in non-modified spark ignition engines. It is miscible with most solvents and sparingly soluble in water [32]. Butanol is generally produced using fossil fuels, but can also be produced from biomass, in which case it is called bio-butanol. Both bio-butanol and petro-butanol have the same chemical properties [33,34]. Butanol quit similar to gasoline due to the longer hydrocarbon chain, lower oxygen content and higher heating value of butanol compared to methanol and ethanol [35]. Furthermore, butanol, as a promising fuel candidate, has attracted more attention recently. Butanol has several benefits than methanol and ethanol and contains high tolerance to water contamination which permits the use of the existing distribution pipelines [36,37]. Recently, the fusel oil attracts attention by some researchers as blending fuel in SI engine [38]. Fusel oil is a by-product of alcohol production after fermentation during the distillation process and it is a natural source of amyl alcohols [39–41]. In Brazil, fusel oil is usually produced in the proportion of 2.5L per 1000L of ethanol [42]. Also in Turkey, 2–3.5L fusel oil is obtained per 1000L alcohol manufacture [43]. However, the properties of fusel oil show that it can be utilised as an alternative fuel for SI engines. Fusel oil has the appearance of an efficient alternative fuel which can be used in a gasoline engine; the composition of the fusel oil depends on the type of carbon used in the alcohol production, fermentation process, preparation method, and decomposition method of the fusel oil in the mixture. Fusel oil consists of about 390g/L iso amyl alcohol, 158g/L isobutyl alcohol, 28.4g/L ethyl alcohol, 16.6g/L methyl alcohol, and 11.9g/L n-propyl [44]. The engine's performance and emissions levels improved when fusel oil is used as an additive for methanol-gasoline blend [45]. Improvements were detected in torque engine for all loads and engine speeds compared to pure gasoline [44,46]. Dimethyl ether (DME) as ether fuel does not have a long history as a blending fuel or additive with gasoline in SI engine, but blending DME with gasoline for SI engine seems a possible solution for enhancing the combustion and improving the engine thermal efficiency under normal operation conditions [47,48]. Dimethyl ether CH3OCH3 (DME) can be produced from a variation of feedstock like crude oil, natural gas, coal, residual oil, biomass, and waste products [49–52]. DME has a lot of good properties and is thought to be one of the best alternative fuels for IC engines in the future. In addition, many investigations have been carried out on DME to determine its suitability to be used as a fuel additive in spark-ignited ethanol engine [53–55]. As an overall, dimethyl ether has been found to be a promising alternative additive fuel for spark ignition engines, as it has low combustion noise, high thermal efficiency, soot-free combustion, and low NOx levels. DME addition can be considered as a possibly applicable approach for enhancing the overall performance of spark ignition ethanol engines [47,52,56]. Moreover, DME enhances the engine's economical and emissions performances when it is used as an additive to gasoline-ethanol blend in SI engine [47]. In Germany, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) based ether and oxygenated fuel was used with gasoline since 1985 to improve octane value as well as to decrease engine emissions. MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) is a volatile organic compound manufactured by the chemical reaction of isobutylene and methanol. MTBE (C5H12O) is produced in very large amounts (over 200,000 barrels/day in the US in 1999) and is almost absolutely used as a fuel additive in gasoline engine [57]. MTBE is the most commonly used ether fuel because of its low price, ease of production, and favorable transfer and blending characteristics [58]. It is also added to gasoline to decrease harmful emissions [59]. Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) has been added to gasoline in the USA, since 1979, originally as an octane booster (anti-knock agent) to replace lead [60]. Since that date, the use of MTBE has rose significantly and reached around 408,000–453,592.37 Metric Tons in 1997 [61,62]. While MTBE has been used as a gasoline additive in the US by 1979, formerly it was used as an anti-knock agent to replace lead [60]. Sezer et al. [63] proved that the blending of gasoline with MTBE improved the performance and CO emissions of a spark ignition engine. The highest improvement in BMEP values is achieved by adding 10% of MTBE to gasoline. MTBE10 led to the improved brake thermal efficiency (BTE) up to a 15% blending ratio. Due to the high-octane number of alcohol and ether fuels were used as octane booster instead of tetraethyl lead (TEL) in gasoline. Simultaneously, as the USA started driving out the lead in gasoline, ethanol became more attractive as an octane enhancer [35]. In the 1970s, leaded gasoline was outlawed in the US, while in Italy; it has not been sold since 2000 due to a community law, even if the newer cars use unleaded fuel from the 1990s. At the moment, almost all countries have banned leaded fuel with the exception of some countries which still use lead gasoline [64]. Furthermore, alcohols and MTBE have substituted tetraethyl lead (TEL) in gasoline as it causes air pollution. The emissions from the combustion of transportation exhausts produce climatic pollution which causes serious health hazards [65–67]. MTBE is a gasoline additive that was applied essentially as an octane enhancer (4–8% by vol) since the phase-out of tetraethyl lead (TEL) in the late 1970s [68]. In the late 1980s, MTBE usage for octane boosting had grown steadily, followed by its additional application in creating a cleaner burning gasoline for some countries. In 1981, MBTE rate was increased to 11% and 15% in 1988. During 1980 and 1986, MTBE usage increased about 40% per year. In 1984, it was one of the top 50 chemicals manufactured in the US [69–72]. While the debate about whether MTBE is the best additive for cleaner gasoline continues, ethanol has appeared as a powerful contender. Many researchers discussed the possibility to substitute TEL additives with ethanol as it is long recognized as a good source of octane and accepted in some countries [25,73–75]. Fuels with high octane rating have a high resistance to engine knock, hence, well satisfied as spark-ignition engine fuels. The decreased engine knock tendencies can be utilised with a high compression ratio, thereby lead to greater engine power and engine efficiency than pure gasoline [76]. Another interesting and beneficial property of alcohols and especially methanol is the comparably high molar expansion that provides additional pressure during the chemical reactions but without any additional heat. The heating value of alcohol and ether fuels is approximately 30% which is lower than gasoline [30,77]. The lower heating value of the simpler alcohols than that of gasoline does not only mean more fuel demands to be carried on an engine, but also that the engine fueling system needs to be designed to accommodate higher fueling rates [78]. Furthermore, alcohols offer the highest combustion efficiency. This is mainly due to the relative oxygen content [79,80]. Other than that, the oxygen content of alcohols assists to enhance the completeness of combustion [81,82]. Moreover, alcohol and ether fuels aim to improve the performance of reducing the emissions of SI engine [27,77,83]. Furthermore, the cost of some alcohol fuels is cheaper than conventional fuel [79]. There is a huge number of literature and researches on engine performances, emissions, and combustion characteristics using alcohol fuels, particularly in the last decades. Fig. 2 represents the number of vehicle models that can run without gasoline fuel during the period of 1992–2013. The growth in the number of vehicle models that can run on E85 was clearly shown [62]. The aim of this paper is to systematically review the use of alcohols (butanol, methanol, ethanol, and fusel oil) and ethers (MTBE and DME) as fuels in spark ignition engine that could potentially replace petroleum-based fuels. Also, the current study has investigated the effects of alcohol and ether fuels on performances (brake torque, brake power, BSFC, effective efficiency, and EGT), emissions (CO, COs2, NOx, and HC), and combustion characteristics of spark ignition engine. Furthermore, this paper also discussed the impacts of alcohol fuels engine vibration, engine noise, and potential to replace lead in gasoline and to use some of them as octane enhancers for gasoline Table 1."
1,Properties of alcohol and ether fuels,"Chemical and physical properties refer to the quality of fuel to be combusted in an engine. Moreover, the engine performance, combustion quality, and emission characteristics are related to them. The main properties of alcohol and ether fuels are shown in Table 2. Fusel oil and MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) can be expressed by the chemical formula of C5H12O. Also, ethanol is isometric with dimethyl ether (DME) and both DME and ethanol have the same chemical formula (C2H5OH). One of the most significant properties of alcohol and ether fuels are the oxygen atoms in their molecular compounds, especially in methanol or ethanol (alcohol) that contribute to the decrement of CO and HC emissions [89,90]. In addition, the octane number, other key properties for alcohol fuels that are used in spark ignition engines, are related to the volatility of the fuels. The latent heat of evaporation (LHOV) of alcohol fuels is 3–5 times higher than gasoline. The LHOV influences the ability of cold start in SI engine, which leads to the increment of volumetric efficiency, and makes the temperature of the intake manifold to be lower. For instance, the latent heat of vaporization (LHOV) of methanol is approximately 2.5 times higher than gasoline [28]. On the other hand, the heating value of alcohol and ether fuels is 20–40% lower than unleaded gasoline and needs 1.5–1.8 times more alcohol fuels to achieve similar energy output. At the same time, the low heating value of alcohol and ether fuels leads to lower exhaust temperatures and decrease engine emissions [30]. Vapor pressure is a significant property of engine fuels. In addition, the vapor pressure can influence proper cold starting of the engine. Furthermore, the vapor pressure is a critical factor in meeting evaporative emission requirements. Vapor pressure is named as the Reid vapor pressure (RVP). In generally the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of alcohol fuels is 17–55kPa, lower than that of gasoline 53–60kPa [97]. More details of alcohol and ether fuels were described in the next sections."
2,Octane number,"2.1 Octane number The octane number is a measure of the liability of the fuel to detonate during the combustion process in IC engines running on the Otto cycle (petrol engines or SI). The ignition quality of gasoline is characterized by using its octane number that is measured as the research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON). Many engines will break in less than 50h under the conditions of heavy knock, and the damaging effect of knock is cumulative. To prevent the knocking in engine, it is necessary to use fuels with high octane number [98]. Straight-run gasoline without lead additives is not suitable for high compression engines and extra reforming. The tetraethyl lead (TEL) was discovered as a highly efficient anti-knock compound. By 1920s, manufacturers started to improve the engine performance by increasing the compression ratio. The TEL was blended with gasoline to enhance the octane number so the blended fuel can be used with high compression ratio [98,99]. Soon after, there was essentially universal acceptance for the need to eradicate lead from gasoline. Its adverse neurological effects, especially on human, have been definitively established by many researchers around the world [100]. In the 1970s, leaded gasoline was outlawed in the USA, while in Italy; it has not been sold since 2000 due to a community law, even if the newer cars use unleaded fuel from the 1990s. At the moment, almost all countries have banned unleaded fuel with the exception of some countries which still use leaded gasoline [64]. The octane number rapidly increase when alcohol and ethers fuels are blended with gasoline due to the high research and motor octane number [101]. MTBE is a gasoline additive that was applied primarily as an octane enhancer (4–8% by vol) since the phase-out of tetraethyl lead (TEL) in the late 1970s [68]. At the end of the 1980s, MTBE usage for octane enhancer had grown steadily, followed by its additional application in creating a cleaner-burning gasoline for some countries. In 1981, MBTE rate was increased to 11% and 15% in 1988. During 1980 and 1986, MTBE usage increased about 40% per year. In 1984, it was one of the top 50 chemicals manufactured in the US [69–72]. After the MTBE ethanol has appeared as a powerful octane enhancer. The production of ethanol has received significant attention over the years as an octane booster. Many researchers discussed the possibility to substitute TEL additives with ethanol as it is long recognized as a good source of octane and accepted in some countries [25,73–75]. Additional to ethanol and MTBE the fusel oil that obtained as by-product through the fermentation of some agricultural products has similar properties with alcoholic fuel. These properties include high research octane number (RON = 106), motor octane number (MON = 103), high oxygen content and single boiling point which indicates that it can be utilizing as an alternative fuel for SI engines as shown in Table 2. Thereby the fuel with high-octane rating can be used as octane enhancer. Calam et al. [46,102] investigated the effects of different fusel oil blending ratio (F5, F10, F20, F30, F500) on performance and emission of SI engine. As results of their study the octane number increased as fusel amount increased. Also, higher octane-rating fuel is desirable as it enables improved engine efficiency and increased brake specific fuel consumption BSFC through the possibility of increasing the compression ratio."
3,Heating (calorific) value,"2.2 Heating (calorific) value The heating value of the fuel is known as the amount of heat released through combustion when a unit quantity of the fuels is burnt [103]. The heating value of a fuel has a direct influence on the brake specific fuel combustion (BSFC) [104]. Also, the power output of the engine and brake thermal efficiency depend on the energy value of fuel and mass flow rate of air into the engine [105]. Heating value (energy content) is an essential factor in the selection of the fuel. Usually, alcohols and ethers have lower heating value by 3 times than that of gasoline as shown in Table 2. The heating value of any fuel or biofuel is affected by several factors such as the oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and water content of the fuel and also the fatty acid, which is one of the factors that affected the heating value of biofuel [10,106,107]. Furthermore, some researchers linked the relationship between the fuel properties such as density, viscosity and the heating value [108]. Moreover, biofuels mainly alcohols have much less carbon and more oxygen thereby resulting in a lower heating value. Demibras [109] has reported that the heating value of a fuel is associated with its oxygen content. The lower heating value (LHV) of a fuel reduces by increasing the oxygen and water content while the LHV is increased by increasing the hydrogen and sulfur content. The carbon content is the most significant parameter that influences the LHV. The concentration of carbon is positively related to the heating value of the fuels proving that why fossil fuels have greater higher heating value (HHV) than biofuel [110–112]. Demibras [108] in a separate article has also indicated that the water content in a fuel reduces its HHV. Moisture effect on the combustion efficiency negatively thereby compromising the engine performance [87]. Mehta et al. [113] have reported the LHV increasing with an increase in the carbon chain length of saturated acids and esters. According to Demibras [114], the increase in heating value is the result of an increase in the concentration of hydrogen and carbon, as well as an increase in the ratio of these elements relative to oxygen. Therefore, several attempts have been performed to predict the HHV based on experimental correlation data of oxygen, carbon-hydrogen ash, and water content."
4,Boiling point,"2.3 Boiling point The boiling point of alcohol is regularly much lower than the boiling point of gasoline as shown in Table 2. The boiling point is an important parameter as it is directly related to the volatility of a fuel. Fuels which have a low boiling point will evaporate faster, so spillages will not persist for long periods. Examples of opposites are petrol, which readily evaporates and leaves no liquid trace within a few minutes, and diesel, which remains on a filling station forecourt for long periods. Alcohols and ethers have a single boiling point. In fact, the single boiling point of alcohols has been one of the main reasons for the increase in energy release [115]. Low boiling point of DME leads to fast evaporation when a liquid-phase DME spray is injected into the engine cylinder [116]. Volatility is the disposition of an alcohols fuel to evaporate at a comparatively low temperature. If vaporization does not happen under a temperature range available to the engine and its fuel-handling components, the carburetion or injection system cannot deliver the proper air fuel mixture and the fuel will not combust efficiently. Not only does this results in wasted fuel, it also significantly increases the levels of CO and HC emissions [35]. The flash point of fuel is also related to its volatility where an evaporative compound such as gasoline is hazardous in the vicinity of sparks or an open flame [117]."
5,Auto ignition temperature,"2.4 Auto ignition temperature The auto-ignition point of regular gasoline can range from about 257°C to as low as 221°C [118]. Ethanol has an auto-ignition point of 329°C and other fuels are listed in Table 2. The auto ignition temperature is applicable to gases and vapors. It is defined as the temperature at which the vapor ignites spontaneously in a confined space. Leakage of gases and vapors can accumulate in spaces and a hot surface can then act as a source of ignition. The second effect is turbulence, with increasing turbulence the auto ignition temperature will also increase [119,120]. All alcohol fuels have similar combustion and ignition characteristics to the existing and known traditional fuels [121]. For instance, the auto ignition temperature of methanol is higher than that of gasoline fuel and the auto-ignition temperature of alcohol is higher than pure gasoline, which makes it safer for transportation and storage [122]."
6,Latent heat of vaporization,"2.5 Latent heat of vaporization When a substance is about to undergo a change in its state, as in transition from liquid to vapor, it must absorb additional heat in order for the change to occur. This is known as the heat of vaporization [123]. Ethanol requires 918.7KJ/kg (at 77°F at 1atm) to make the change; gasoline requires about 341.9KJ/kg. This difference, a factor of 2.68, is the basis for ethanol's cooler operating condition in an internal combustion engine. Gasoline, with its lower heat of vaporization, cannot absorb nearly the amount of heat that ethanol can, so the heat is simply transferred to the engine coolant as waste. The decrease in NOx emissions is due to the ethanol additive as it has high LHOV [124]. LHOV is classically suspected to have an indirect anti-knock property by cooling the air-fuel mixture when the fuel evaporates during the intake stroke in a DI SI engine by thermally postponing the fuel auto ignition in knock conditions. This impact is classically called the ""cooling effect"" [125]. Ethanol and methanol have higher LHOV compared to gasoline as more heat is needed to vapor the blinding fuel of gasohol [28]. With the use of gasohol, the combustion temperature is reduced due to the high latent heat and lower heating value and oxygen content, thereby leads to the decrease in NOx emissions [28]."
7,Oxygen content,"2.6 Oxygen content The oxygen content of alcohols could lead to a more complete and cleaner combustion and the in-cylinder temperature was decreased due to the high oxygen content [126,127]. The oxygen content of methanol is higher than ethanol and MTBE: 49.9, 34.8, and 18.9 by weight, respectively. Thus, methanol will afford less dilution compared to other oxygenates. Gautam and Martin [128] have confirmed that the engine knock phenomenon is related to the relative oxygen content. This could explain why knock happens at lower loads when DMF is used. Alcohols offer the highest combustion efficiency. This is mainly due to the relative oxygen content, despite, paradoxically, the oxygen limits the fuel consumption performance because it allows no additional energy. Furthermore, the oxygen content of alcohols assists to enhance the completeness of combustion [129]. The caloric value of alcohol and ether fuels is lower than gasoline due to the higher oxygen and carbon concentrations [130]. Data in Fig. 3 which was taken from Table 2, shows the effects of the oxygen on the heating value. The higher oxygen content of the fuel leads to decrease the heating value while, on the contrary, was with carbon. Although the oxygen content for DME and ethanol is the same, there is a slight different in the heating value. The same goes for butanol and MTBE. This may be due to the ratio of O/C in fuel as shown in Fig. 4."
8,Phase separation temperature (PST),"2.7 Phase separation temperature (PST) Gasohol are, indeed, a three-component system of alcoho1, gasoline, and water due to the hygroscopic character of the alcohols [131,132]. The most significant problem in utilizing gasohol such as engine fuel is their possible separation into two liquid phases due to numerous reasons such as water content temperature, alcohol of the blend, and composition of the gasoline. Letcher et al. [133] have indicated that PST in the presence of water is the most serious technical problem related to ethanol-gasoline blend [134]. Water solubility in gasoline is quite low and hence, not a significant performance anxiety. When there is water in the fuel tank, it accumulates at the bottom of fuel tanks or channel. Furthermore, water content in fuels may corrode and plug engine parts and is a significant contributor to tank bottom corrosion [135,136]. Moreover, water content during cold temperatures may freeze and stop fuel flow. Higher dissolved water content may decrease the heating value of the fuel, but more significantly, if enough water is encountered, a separate aqueous phase will drive out ethanol from gasoline [137]. According to ASTM D4814-08b, the alcohol and gasoline blends should dry enough to avoid being split up into water and alcohol and hydrocarbon at the lowest temperatures [137]. Hence, in the evaluation of gasohol blend as a fuel of SI engine, the initial step should be solving the PST problem, therefore, achieving a homogeneous blend. In order to reduce the PST, higher aliphatic alcohols such as tertiary butyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol were normally added to the gasoline-alcohol blends [45,138–140]. The solubility of water in gasohol blend is deeply dependent on the types of alcohol. The quantity of water that can be dissolved in several 10% and 20% alcohol blends in gasoline is presented in Figs. 5 and 6. Temperature of the haze appearance increased linearly with the increase in the water content [134,137]. Some of the alcohols are used as co-solvents to decrease the PST of gasoline-alcohol blends, thereby increasing the stability of the blends. Karaosmanoğlu et al. [141] have investigated the influence of adding a fraction of fusel oil as a new blending agent for gasoline-methanol blends. As shown in Fig. 7, it can be seen that the PST of methanol-gasoline blends decreases as the amount of fusel oil increases. Furthermore, fusel oil fraction such as a new blending is found to be a very suitable additive for the stabilization of the gasoline-methanol blends and it did not create any problems in the properties of fuel."
9,"Current costs, prices and economic impact of the alcohols","The interest of using biofuel in compression-ignition engines has increased recently due to the rapid reduction in world fossil oil reserve. The increment in the cost of fossil fuels and the restrictions on exhaust emissions from internal combustion (IC) engines have been, indeed, triggered by environmental concerns. At present, several countries have replaced their fossil fuel with renewable fuels [142]. With that, alcohol and ether represent an important alternative fuel used with gasoline in internal combustion engines as a blend or an additive [19]. Biofuels production costs can vary widely by feedstock, conversion process, scale of production and region. Fig. 8 shows the average retail fuel prices in the US per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) on an energy basis, ethanol is currently more expensive to produce than gasoline in all regions considered. Only ethanol produced in Brazil comes close to competing with gasoline. Ethanol produced from corn in the US is considerably more expensive than from sugar cane in Brazil, and ethanol from grain and sugar beet in Europe is even more expensive. These differences reflect many factors, such as scale, process efficiency, feedstock costs, capital and labor costs, co-product accounting, and the nature of the estimates. The cost of large-scale production of bio-based products is currently high in developed countries. For example, the production cost of biofuels may be three times higher than that of petroleum fuels, without, however, considering the non-market benefits. Conversely, in developing countries, the costs of producing biofuels are much lower than in the OECD countries and very near to the world market price of petroleum fuel [144]. Agriculture ethanol is at present more expensive of synthesis-ethanol from ethylene. The simultaneous production of bioethanol (from sugar juice) in parallel to the production of bioethanol, appears economically attractive in locations where hydro-electricity is available at very low cost (∼ 0.01 $ kWh) [145]."
10,Alcohols as pure fuel in SI engine,"Alcohols such as ethanol have been blended with gasoline in the US for several years [146]. The most familiar gasoline-ethanol blend is the E10 blend which includes 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. Moreover, ethanol can be applied as pure (E100) and as a blend of E85 that includes 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Ethanol used in the US is manufactured domestically, principally from molasses. There is an ongoing study to commercialise the production of ethanol from sources other than vegetables, such as cellulosic materials like wood or paper wastes [147]. Ethanol has an established track record as a neat fuel in Brazil, where almost five million cars currently run on 190-proof ethanol (95% ethanol, 5% water) [148]. Ethanol can be utilised as a primary car fuel in either the neat (pure) or near-neat form [149]. Although 100% of butanol could be utilied in SI engine, it probably has a higher realistic possibility to be blended with gasoline. Many studies recommend that butanol can be blended into either gasoline or diesel to as much as 45% without engine modifications [150,151]. Methanol 85 (M85) is a blend of 85% methanol and 15% gasoline. The mixture is utilied to partially mitigate some of the problems correlated with utilizing methanol (M100) as particularly challenging cold starts at temperatures under 15°C and also due to safety concerns that involve in-tank flammability, lack of flame luminosity, and minimal odor or taste [152]. Many studies have been done on the use of ethanol and methanol blends with gasoline by different ratios in the Spark Ignition engines. El-Emam and Desoky [153] studied the effects of pure methanol, pure ethanol, and other fuels theoretically and experimentally on the combustion of spark ignition engines. They indicated that the increment in engine thermal efficiency was due to the relatively lower temperature and peak pressure and the reduction of NOx and CO emissions happened when pure ethanol and pure methanol fuels were used. Ali et al. [8] investigated the performance and emissions of the alcohol fuels and pure gasoline in a spark ignition engine. Their results indicated that the output power and NOx and CO emissions were reduced while the BSFC increased when pure methanol was used instead of gasoline. Çelik et al. [154] had experiments done on pure methanol and pure gasoline in a four-stroke, single cylinder under different compression ratios (CR) 6:1 to 8:1 and 10:1 and different engine speeds (1500–3500rpm). The knock was not seen at CRs of 8:1 and 10:1 when methanol was used, while the knock was noted at CR of 8:1 when gasoline used. The results also indicated that some reductions were found in CO, CO2, and NOx emissions without any evident of power loss when methanol was used at CR of 6:1. Fig. 9 shows the use of alcohol fuels in vehicles in use in the US during 1995–2011. The number of vehicles in use has been growing steadily over the past 15 years. The popularity of ethanol vehicles has increased widely since 1995, while the number of other alcohol-fueled vehicles has remained relatively constant [155]."
11,Alcohols and ether as fuel blending for SI engine,"The blending of gasoline-alcohol has attracted the attention of researchers in many countries including Brazil E5 - E85 (5–85% ethanol), Germany (3%, methanol), South-Africa (12 ~ 01% alcohol blend) and parts of the USA (10–01% ethanol). Alcohol can be blended with the gasoline by any proportion, and it can be operated in several internal combustion engines with little or no modification. Methanol can be blended with gasoline in spark ignition engines in various amount [156]. Gravalos et al. [157] studied the emissions of higher-lower molecular mass alcohol-gasoline blends, whereby the alcohol component of the alcohol-gasoline blends consisted of propanol, ethanol, methanol and butanol. It was found that CO and HC concentrations decreased under varying engine loads when running on alcohol gasoline blends, while NO emission produced by alcohol- gasoline blends was higher than that of gasoline. There are numerous fuel properties that are important for proper operation of gasoline in spark ignition engines. The addition of alcohol with gasoline affects certain key properties, particularly blend viscosity, stability, heating value and octane rating. Corrosiveness and material compatibility are also significant reasons for consideration. More importantly, any property that affects safety should be foremost in any fuel evaluation, which means that flammability and flashpoint should be considered. Table 1 illustrates the influence of alcohol-gasoline blending on fuel properties. In summary, fuel properties change with increasing alcohol concentration in a blend. As shown in Table 1, with increasing alcohol concentration, the heating value for all presented fuels reduced, while the kinematic viscosity and density of the blends increased. Furthermore, the octane number increased for all fuels, except butanol. These properties that changed play a major role in the performance and emission of spark ignition engines."
12,Effect of alcohol and ether fuels on the performance of SI engines,"The performance characteristics of spark ignition engines are directly affected by the type of fuel used. These characteristics include engine power, torque, SFC and brake thermal efficiency (BTE). The influence of alcohol and ether fuels on the performance characteristics of SI engines as described in the literature are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, and are comprehensively reviewed in the following Sections (6.1 and 610.2). The review includes different engine types, alcohol fuel blends, test conditions and the effects of alcohol and ether on power, torque, SFC and brake thermal efficiency (BTE)."
13,Effect on torque and power,"6.1 Effect on torque and power Some studies have shown that engine torque increased slightly also the fuel consumption increased when using alcohol fuels. This is because alcohol has less energy per unit volume compared to gasoline. Power and torque depend heavily on an engine's in-cylinder pressure. Calam et al., 2014 [46] experimented on a four-stroke, single cylinder, SI Hydra engine, which ran on different engine speeds (1500, 2500, 3500 and 5000rpm), different engine loads 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% and different test fuels (F0, F10, F20 and F30). The torque increased in all loads and engine speeds when the amount of fusel oil in each test fuel was increased. The highest engine torque was 2500rpm for F30. Chongming et al. [162] used DMF, ethanol and gasoline on a single cylinder, spray guided, 4-stroke DISI research engine at 1500rpm engine speed, stoichiometric air–fuel ratio (AFR) and different engine loads between 3.5 and 8.5bar IMEP, as well as using the optimum spark timings (MBT). They found that at 8.5bar IMEP engine load, the combustion duration for DMF was shorter than gasoline and ethanol by 4 and 1 crank angle degree, respectively. DMF generated the highest in-cylinder peak pressure, which was higher than that of ethanol. DMF and ethanol had greater ant-knocking than gasoline due high octane number. At 8.5bar IMEP, the highest thermal efficiency was obtained when using ethanol (38.5%), while DMF and gasoline had 37% and 36%, respectively. Significant research has been achieved to quantify the ability of fuel octane rating to provide higher power, torque, and engine efficiency by increasing compression ratio (CR) in spark-ignited engines [124,163,164]. High octane value and high latent heat of vaporization (LHOV) of alcohol make it a suitable fuel for high compression ratio engine that produce high-output power. High octane rating can allow for a high compression ratio and provides a higher performance. Yucesu et al. [165] studied the impact of gasoline, E10, E20, E40 and E60 on the performance of spark ignition engine with CR between 8:1 and 13:1. It was found that engine torque and power increased when ethanol was used at higher CR. Heywood [166] discussed the impact of CR on the performance of an eight cylinder 5.3-L engine at 2000rpm at full load condition. In the experiment, ignition timing and fuel/air mixture equivalence were modified. Results showed that increased CR led to increased mean effective pressure (MEP) up to a certain limit, whereby thereafter, MEP decreased further. In effect, the engine power dropped. Yang et al. [159] investigated the effect of butanol–gasoline blend (B35) on engine performance, in which they found that the engine full load torque clearly increased for all speed lower than 7000rpm using B35 compared to gasoline. While for engine speed faster than 7000rpm, the full load engine torque maintained the same. Furthermore, Palmer [167] indicated that, 10% ethanol addition improves the brake power by 5%, and the octane rating could be improved by 5% for each 10% ethanol added. On the other hand, there some studies indicated the engine torque and power reduce with alcohol fuels. Alasfour [168] investigated engine efficiency under a wide range of fuel-air equivalence ratios (Ф = 0.8–1.2) using B30% gasoline-butanol blend on a four stroke single cylinder engine. They found 7% reduction in power compared to gasoline. Furthermore, Solmaz [169] found that the engine power decreased when fusel oil used which could be explained by the lower heating value and higher water content of fusel oil compared with gasoline."
14,Effect on fuel consumption (FC),"6.2 Effect on fuel consumption (FC) Fuel economy is affected by many factors such as automobiles weight, size, aerodynamics, fuel supply system, engine design, and transmission type. Those factors remain constant for certain cars [170,171]. There are, however, several variable factors that affect fuel economy, such as the heating value of alcohol compared to gasoline [172], as well as the road and weather conditions. This study focused on the effect of heating value and related issues such as operating condition, combustion process, and alcohol oxygen content in spark ignition engines. Since the heating value of alcohol and ether fuels are lower than that of gasoline by approximately 30%, it is necessary for more alcohol and ether fuel to produce the same power output [173]. The experiment performed by Calam et al. [87] using a Hydra brand, four cylinders spark ignition engine with a compression rate of 11:1 with different gasoline-fusel oil blends (B0, F5, F10, F20, F30 and F50) under full load condition, running at 3500rpm maximum engine torque with varying advance values. It was shown that adding fusel oil into gasoline lowered the calorific heat value of fusel oil (almost 30% lower than unleaded gasoline) led to lower calorific heat value of the test fuels. Hence, the amount of fuel mass taken into the cylinder increases with increasing amount of fusel oil in the blend. As a result, the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) also increased. When F10, F20 and F30 test fuels were used, it was found that the maximum engine torque speed the SFC increased by 2.4%, 2.7%, and 3.1%, respectively compared to pure gasoline. Abu-Zaid et al. [145] investigated the impact of methanol-gasoline blends on engine performance. The tests were conducted under the condition of wide open throttle (WOT) and various engine speeds from 1000 to 2500rpm using different methanol-gasoline blends. As a result, the brake specific fuel consumption increased for all engine speeds and blending ratios compared to pure gasoline, except when using E15. Costa et al. [174] indicated that BSFC increased by 50–70% with Hydrous ethanol compared to gasoline. Similar results were also achieved in other studies [165,175]. Qi and Lee [161] studied the combustion of a three-cylinder engine with ethanol–gasoline blends (E10 and E20) under different engine loads and running at 2500rpm. It was found that BTE of the blends was similar to pure gasoline, but BSFC was higher compared to gasoline. Balki et al. [176] mentioned that the using methanol and ethanol significantly increased BSFC due to the lower heating value of methanol and ethanol. Furthermore, Yakup and Alper [44,71] stated that specific fuel consumption (SFC) increased for all engine speeds depending on the quantity of fusel oil in the blend. The highest increment in SFC (7.7%) was obtained with F30. Moreover, Osman et al. [160] reported that the brake specific fuel consumption increased when MTBE was used as a blending fuel at speeds ranging between 2800 and 5000rpm. Under the same range of speed, the BSFC of MTBE was closed to pure gasoline. This result could be due to the higher energy value (heating value) and lower density of the gasoline compared to MTBE."
15,Effect on combustion characteristics,"6.3 Effect on combustion characteristics Table 5 summarizes the impact of alcohol and ether fuels on the combustion characteristics of a spark ignition engine, including the cylinder temperature (CT), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), rate of heat release (ROHR), rate of pressure rise (ROPR), mass fraction burn (FMB), cylinder pressure (CP), combustion duration (CD), combustion speed (CS), flame speed (FS), combustion efficiency (CE), and anti-knocking (AK). Furthermore, almost all the studies listed in Table 5 are comprehensively reviewed in this section. Generally, alcohol and ether-based fuels have a real impact on the combustion of ICE due to the high oxygen content and single boiling point. Additionally, alcohol and ether have around 30% lower energy values than gasoline. Alcohol and ether are oxygenated fuels that permit complete combustion. Besides, they provide higher volumetric efficiency in naturally-aspirated engines due to their higher LHOV. Clearly the type of fuels used in spark ignition engine directly affects the flame structure and speed inside combustion chamber. Flame development CA0–10 and flame propagation CA10–90 durations are significant parameters affecting the combustion and thermal efficiency of an engine. The duration CA0–10 is the distance between the start of spark, called start of combustion, and 10% heat release or mass fraction burnt. This duration can have negative and positive effects on engine efficiency. The period CA10–90 is called the flame propagation duration that describes the CA duration of 10–90% of heat release or mass fraction burnt. The 10–90% duration is a significant parameter that uses to find the velocity of burning and combustion efficiency [55,180]. Generally, a small portion of alcohols fuel additive in gasoline provides shorter duration of flame development and faster burning than gasoline [4]. Also, the typically used oxygenized hydrocarbon is alcohol, which has rapid burning rate compared to gasoline [158,181,182]. Solmaz [169] has experimental performed on a single cylinder, four stroke engine. The performance, combustion characteristics and emission of different fusel oil-gasoline blends were measured for at different engine loads while the engine speed of 2500rpm. The highest in-cylinder pressure and rate of heat release (ROHR) reduced as the amount of fusel oil increased. The reduction in cylinder pressures and ROHR happened because of the worse combustion of fusel oil caused by the high water content in fusel oil. A significant reduction was achieved for the in-cylinder pressure and ROHR when using pure fusel oil (F100) compared to pure gasoline (F0) at 100% engine load. It was observed that the increment in ROHR and in-cylinder pressure happened as the engine load increased. The IMEP for F50 and F100 decreased dramatically compared to gasoline as engine loads increases and the maximum IMEP value was achieved as 8.05bar full engine load using gasoline. The ROHR and maximum in-cylinder pressures decreased with pure fusel oil (F100). This situation considers the fact that the fuel oil has aggravated combustion at the same λ and advanced ignition due to the high water content (10–15%) of fusel that caused the worse combustion. The flame development duration (CA0–10) and flame propagation duration (CA10–90) were prolonged when using fusel oil at all engine loads. The oxygen content of fusel oil may be useful to shorten the combustion duration, but the higher water content has negative effects on the durations. However, lower energy value and higher LHOV of fusel oil led to decreased cylinder temperature and negative effects on flame development. Due to the prolonged flame development and flame propagation durations, the heat loss through the in-cylinder wall increased, effectively decreasing the thermal efficiency of the engine. However, because of the higher-octane number in fusel oil, the knocking resistance of the engine was enhanced. Chongming et al. [162] used different fuels including DMF, ethanol and gasoline on a single cylinder, direct injection spark ignition research engine running at 1500rpm engine speed, stoichiometric air–fuel ratio (AFR) and different engine loads (3.5 and 8.5bar IMEP). They examined the engine performance, combustion and emissions. The results showed that at 8.5bar IMEP engine load, the combustion duration for DMF was around 4 and 1 crank angle degree (CA) shorter than gasoline and ethanol, respectively. Its rapid burning rate also showed that DFM generated the greatest in-cylinder peak pressure, which was also higher than that for ethanol. DMF and ethanol had greater ant-knocking than gasoline due high octane number. Furthermore, ethanol had greater combustion efficiency (96.7–97.5%) at all engine loads, while it was 95.3–95.5% and 95.5–95.9% for gasoline and DMF, respectively. The high oxygen content in alcohol increases the availability of oxygen during combustion, which improves combustion efficiency [183]. The peak temperature was obtained when using DMF due to the shorter combustion duration of MDF compared to ethanol and gasoline. Also, increased burning rate leads to increase rate of heat release during the combustion process, thereby generating higher peak temperature. Furthermore, Lennox et al.[177] showed that the rate of heat release and pressure increased when using M70 compared to gasoline, while the combustion duration for methanol (M70) was prolonged. Next, Szwaja and Naber [33] studied the influence of spark timing with different ratios of butanol and gasoline blend on the combustion process of a spark ignition engine. They found that the combustion duration was shortened and the in-cylinder pressure was increased when butanol was used. Therefore, the combustion efficiency increased as well. Cooney [178] studied the effects of SI engine running on different ethanol and gasoline blending ratios (E0, E20, E40, E60, and E84) at a constant engine load and different CR (8:1, 10:1 12:1, 14:1 and 16:1) on the engine's combustion characteristics by analyzing the buried mass fraction. The result revealed that the CR to limit knock tendency for E84 was almost double that of neat gasoline. Also, by increasing the amount of ethanol, the flame development 0–10% MFB duration was shorter. Daniel et al. [129] studied the impact of alternative fuels (ethanol and DMF) and gasoline on the optimum ignition timing (MBT/KL-MBT timing) using a single cylinder DISI engine under different engine loads. First, due to the higher stoichiometric heat of vaporization research octane number (RON) of alcohol (ethanol and DMF), the engine anti-knocking increased for alcohol compared to pure gasoline. Next, the combustion efficiency for gasoline was lower than DMF, which was lower than ethanol. This situation was caused by the high oxygen content in alcohol. Furthermore, higher combustion efficiency of DMF and ethanol led to higher maximum combustion temperature and maximum cylinder pressure. Under the condition of MBT, the combustion duration of gasoline was longer than alcohol (DMF and ethanol). The result also revealed that under the condition of MBT, the flame propagation 10–90% velocity of gasoline decelerated compared to DMF and ethanol. In conclusion, the study showed that alcohol offers the highest combustion efficiency mainly due to the high oxygen content. Paradoxically though, oxygen content limits fuel consumption performance because it limits any additional energy, while it also enhances the completeness of combustion. Qi and Lee [161] showed that E10 had lower peak cylinder pressures than gasoline, but E20 had the same value with gasoline. In addition, gasoline had faster combustion velocity and rate of heat release (ROHR) compared to gasoline-ethanol blends at low engine loads. However, at higher engine loads, 20% ethanol (E20) produced faster combustion velocity and a slightly higher ROHR compared to gasoline. The mass fraction burn (MFB) for E10 and E20 were evidently different from gasoline. At lower loads, ethanol (E10 and E20) had slightly shorter 0–10% duration and combustion velocity compared to pure gasoline. But at higher loads, ethanol-gasoline blends had higher laminar flame speed in the rapid burning angle. Furthermore, the E20 had faster combustion velocity compared to gasoline and other blends."
16,Effect of alcohol and ether fuels on engine emissions,"Engine emissions such nitric oxide (NOx), hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in spark ignition engines are related to engine operating condition and fuel properties. The relationships have been investigated for a variety of alcohol and gasoline in spark ignition engines. The alcohol used in internal combustion engines can decrease exhaust engine emission and toxic exhaust components, and improve overall energy efficiency [184–186]. The impact of alcohol fuel on NOx, HC, CO and CO2, and emissions that have been listed in the literature are comprehensively summarized in Tables 6 and 7, respectively, which include different alcohol fuels, test conditions and the effects of alcohol on the emission. Some of the studies are listed in the tables and others are described in the following sections."
17,Effect on NOx and HC emissions,"7.1 Effect on NOx and HC emissions As described in Table 6, almost the NOx and HC emissions decreased with alcohol and ether fuels in compared with pure gasoline. However, the operation condition affected on the NOx and HC emissions. The peak in-cylinder temperature decreased when alcohol was used for blending with gasoline due to its high heat of vaporization, therefore decreasing NOx emission [197]. Zervas et al. [198] studied the impact of fuel composition and air-fuel on NOx emissions. They concluded that at stoichiometry condition, alcohol blends of 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol, and MTBE with gasoline by 5% and 20% v/v could reduce up to 60% the NOx emission. The impact of utilizing ethanol–gasoline blends on the emissions (CO and HC) as compared to with pure gasoline was studied by Rong et al. [133]. According to the results, more than 20% ethanol concentration in the blend reduced the emission (CO, HC) significantly compared to gasoline. However, Calam et al. [87] reported that the NOx emissions decreased when fusel oil used compared with gasoline. This could be explained by the higher water and oxygen content of fusel oi. Kisenyi et al. [199] examined the impact of MTBE additive (15% v/v) in gasoline on engine emissions, in which the result revealed that MTBE decreased HC emission by 10–20%, NOx by 1.0–1.7%, CO by 10–15%. Changwei et al. [55] experimented under idle and stoichiometric conditions to study the impact of adding DME on the idle performance of SI ethanol engine. Thus, HC emission reduced with increasing amount of added DME. A four-cylinder SI engine was used by Mustafa et al. [124] which ran under various compression ratio and speed fueled by various ethanol-gasoline blends. They found that the reduction in HC emission happened at 1500 and 5000rpm at both compression ratios when ethanol was added. The minimum HC emission was reported when using E85, while the highest HC emission was reported when using pure gasoline. Also, higher compression ratio leads to increased HC emission [200]. Turner et al. [201] investigated the impact of methanol–ethanol–gasoline blends on NOx and CO2 emissions. They used various blend ratios to operate an SI engine and found that dual fuel blends could reduce CO2 and NOx emissions to be lesser than that produced by pure gasoline. Also, Turner et al. [201] investigated the impact of methanol–ethanol–gasoline blends on NOx and CO2 emissions. They found that the dual fuel blends could reduce NOx emission to be lesser than that produced by pure gasoline. On the other hand, there some studies indicated the NOx and HC emission increased with alcohol and ether fuels. Changwei et al. [54] modified a spark ignition engine to run on DME-gasoline blend and found that NOx and HC emissions increased with increasing DME content in the blend. Qi and Lee [119] studied the combustion of a three-cylinder engine with ethanol–gasoline blends (E10 and E20) under various engine loads and running at 2500rpm. The result showed that HC emission increased insignificantly with increasing load for all test fuels. Also, HC emission of E10 and E20 were relatively closer to pure gasoline at lower engine loads, but higher at higher engine loads"
18,Effect of on CO and CO2 emissions,"7.2 Effect of on CO and CO2 emissions Although carbon dioxide (CO2) is a non-toxic gas and is not classified as an engine pollutant, it is one of the substances that is responsible for rising global temperature through the greenhouse effect [202]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced by the complete combustion of hydrocarbon fuel. Carbon monoxide (CO) emission is among the exhaust gases which describe loss of chemical energy due to in-complete combustion in the engine. Indeed, if the combustion temperature through combustion process is not enough to support the complete combustion, thereby transformation of CO to CO2 will not happen [203]. Also, CO2 formation is influenced by the (C-H) ratio in fuel. Additionally, oxygen content plays a main role in improving engine combustion, which increases CO2 level and decreased CO. According to the studies that listed in Table 7, at almost the CO emission decreased while the CO2 emission increased with alcohol and ether fuels compared with pure gasoline. That could be explained by the higher oxygen content of alcohol and ether fuels. Osman et al. [204] studied the impact of different MTBE blending ratios (10%, 15% and 20%) with gasoline on engine performance and pollutant in a gasoline engine. They found higher carbon dioxide exhaust emission with MTBE–gasoline blend, which is an evidence of its better combustion capability than pure gasoline. This result could be associated with lower number of carbon atoms than the average carbon number for pure gasoline, 5 and 8 atoms, respectively. Haroun et al. [187] observed 7.5% increase in CO2 emission with increasing speed and load, compared to using gasoline, while CO2 reduced with increasing compression ratio. Due to high oxygen content in ethanol, the oxygen ratio in the blend increased, leading to lean combustion. Consequently, CO2 emission increased because of the improved combustion [205]. Furthermore, CO2 emission decreased when alcohol was used in fumigation mode compared to fossil fuels [204]. Ozsezen et al. [206] reported 0.1% increment in CO2 emission when using E5 and E10 on four cylinders spark ignition 4C engine. Kemal, et al. [176] noticed 2.51% increment in CO2 when using pure ethanol in a gasoline engine. Similar slight increment in CO2 emission was also reported in several studies [165,174,207–209]. Many studies have been conducted on the correlation between various types of alcohol as blends or additives for gasoline and CO emission in spark ignition engines. Bata et al. [210] investigated various ethanol–gasoline blend ratios in a spark ignition engine, and they decided that ethanol could decrease CO and HC emissions to some degree. The decrease of CO emission is clearly due to the wide flammability and oxygenated characteristic of ethanol. In the study by Palmer [211], he showed that increasing ethanol concentration in gasoline by 10% led to decreased CO emission by up to 30%. Rice et al. [212] experimented with a spark-ignition engine running on ethanol-gasoline isobutanol-methanol-gasoline and gasoline fuel blends and showed that CO emission decreased with alcohol blends compared to gasoline. This result was associated with the lower stoichiometric A/F value for alcohol and it was coupled with the lowering of peak combustion temperature for alcohol blends. Çelik [196] experimented on a four-stroke single cylinder engine with various compression ratios, CR (6:1, 10:1 and 13:1), different ethanol ratios with gasoline (E25, E50, E75 and E100) and at constant load and speed. The level of CO emission with E50 was lower by 54% than that of pure gasoline at the same CR because CO emission is primarily related to air–fuel ratio. Due to increased ethanol concentration in the blend, the oxygen concentration increased. CO emission then decreased due to oxygen enhancement. Additionally, when the engine was running on E50 at high CR (10:1 and 13:1), CO decreased when using E50 compared to E50 at a compression ratio of 6/1. A 53% reduction in CO emission was achieved with E50 blend at a CR of 10/1 compared to CR 6/1. Song et al. [85] investigated the impact of adding ethanol content (up to 9.79% ethanol) and MTBE (up to 20%) in gasoline and found that CO and HC emissions decreased as compared to using MTBE."
19,Adjustments equired for best use of alcohol fuels,"In order to properly apply alcohol and ether as alternative fuels, there are two tasks: first is to redesign the engine to fully benefit from the properties of alcohol fuel, and second is to blend two or three types of alcohol to enhance their characteristics."
20,Car modifications,"8.1 Car modifications Certain modifications are required in cars operating on spark-ignition engines, which include changes to engine-management and material in the fuel system. To take full advantage of higher octane value in alcohol, the compression ratio should be increased. Important modifications to convert current cars to cars running on high-level alcohol blends are summarized as follows: • Use higher compression ratios or variable-boost turbochargers to enhance fuel efficiency and use smaller and lighter engines [149]. • Use enhanced cold-starting approaches to permit reduction or elimination of gasoline content [213,214]. • Use reduced spark retard due to methanol's higher octane rating and faster flame speed [214]. • Use stainless steel fuel tank with stainless steel flame arrestors in the fill and vent tubes to prevent ignition by an external source [215]. • Use stainless steel fuel lines with accompanying Teflon fuel hoses [215]. • Redesign the intake manifold to provide more heating for evaporation as alcohol does not evaporate as readily as gasoline [216]. Davis and Heil [217] studied the effects of modifying the design of SI engines to run on E85 on their performance and emissions. The primary modification was on the entire fuel system, including the fuel-sending unit, the regulator, the fuel filter and injectors, the flame arrestors and the fuel-management unit. The modification resulted in less engine emissions, greater power, and higher efficiency when using E85 fuels compared to gasoline."
21,Fuel properties enhancement,"8.2 Fuel properties enhancement Alcohols have the possibility to be used with high efficiency as an alternative fuel via altering their properties with special additives, whereby the additives must be physically and chemically compatible with the base alcohol fuel and have similar heating value [79,83]. Corrosion-inhibiting additives influence the degree of materials incompatibility and affect the chemical composition and physical properties of the base fuel [218]. Additives should not be driven out from the fuel easily, increase engine emissions, or leave any residue. They must not complicate regulatory compliance and must be relatively cheap [118]. Some types of alcohol, such as methanol, have lower miscibility with gasoline. Therefore, blending those types of alcohol with gasoline may lead to phase separation problem. To avoid this problem, additives can be used, such as 1-butanol, non-ionic surfactants, isopropanol and fusel oil. Karaosmanoğlu et al. [141] investigated the influence of adding a fraction of fusel oil as a new blending agent into gasoline-methanol blends and found that PST of methanol-gasoline blends decreased with increasing percentage of fusel oil."
22,Impacts of alcohol fuels on the vibration of SI engine,"The type of fuel used in a spark ignition engine directly influences its vibrational behaviour [219]. Although the peak frequencies are determined by the engine structural properties, the levels of engine vibration are created by the burn inside the combustion chamber and the types of fuel burned [219,220]. The effects of alcohols on SI engine performance and emissions have been investigated through studies for decades, but the researches on the impacts of alcohols on SI engine vibration and noise emissions are still insufficient. Vibrations are instabilities of a mechanical or structural system regarding an equilibrium position. If uncontrolled, vibration can lead to catastrophic situations [221,222]. The engine mechanical design, engine load, engine speed, and the properties of oil and fuel are the chief factors for the formation of engine vibration. Variations of the engine vibration values have been utilised to determine an optimised combustion process, for examples fuel quality, engine load, ignition, and injection timing. This method enhances fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, and noise. Therefore, determining the impacts of alcohols on engine vibration is necessary. There have been efforts at decreasing engine vibration and determining engine vibration characteristics (Gravalos et.al) [219]. Tests were done on the vibration behaviour of an SI engine fueled with unleaded gasoline, methanol, and ethanol at different blending ratios (10%, 20%, and 30%) and different engine speeds (1000 and 1900rpm with intervals of 300rpm). The results showed that the vibration amplitude made by pure gasoline fuel was greater at low frequencies, at about 1500Hz. On the contrary, the vibration amplitude made by gasoline–methanol blends had a high-frequency content, at about 2400Hz. Furthermore, Keskin [223] mentioned that the vibration behaviours in the spark ignition engine are determined by the types of fuel used including ethanol–gasoline–oil at different blending ratios. This study was done under different engine loads and speeds with a high sensitivity electronic vibration analysis system to measure the frequency spectrum of the SI engine vibration. Based on the results, the engine vibration amplitudes of the gasoline-methanol blends increased compared to the vibration amplitudes of the pure gasoline fuel and the increment was significant at 1500rpm and 2500rpm as shown in Fig. 10. However, there was a slight decrease in the maximum vibration value of E25 at 2000rpm engine speed. At 2500rpm engine speed, the maximum increasing ratio was around 25.12%. The higher LHOV and oxygen content of ethanol led to the increase in the peak pressure values and the rate of pressure (dp/dt) in the piston through the combustion processes. Othman et al. [220] investigated the vibration behaviour of SI engine fueled by kerosene, gas, methanol, and methanol-kerosene blend. They found that the combustion driven oscillations increase with the carbon-hydrogen ratio of the fuel. The frequency and amplitude of the fundamental harmonics decrease with increased load."
23,Impacts of alcohol fuels on the noise of SI engine,"The external noise emitted by passenger cars has been controlled since 1929 when the Motor Cars (Excessive Noise) Regulations were introduced [224]. Engine noise is essentially classified into three noises: combustion noise, mechanical noise, and combustion – induced mechanical noise. Certainly, the engine produces knocking such as impulsive and irregular noises, which are unpleasant [225,46]. In addition, noise emission of engines is caused by vibration. The key noise sources of gasoline engine were caused by crankshaft /camshaft, combustion pressure, and the high-pressure fuel system (HPFS). At an idle engine speed, the noise associated to the HPFS is more noticeable than the crankshaft/camshaft-associated mechanical noise and combustion noise because they have a lower engine speed and lower engine power. Therefore, reducing the noise of gasoline DI engines is important [226]. The engine knocking plays a role in engine vibration and noise; therefore, alcohol fuel represents one of the solutions to reduce the engine noise. However, as shown in Fig. 11, the engine noise increased slightly with ethanol blend compared to gasoline [223]. The highest noise level is E50 at all engine speeds. One of the reasons that may cause the increase in vibration and noise emissions is the increment of combustion reaction rate that is related to the oxygen content of alcohols (ethanol) which makes higher flame speeds. The increase in pressure rate (dp/dt) was due to a higher latent heat of evaporation of ethanol [227]. Keskin and Gürü [228] studied exhaust and noise emissions of spark ignition engine by different blending ratios of ethanol–gasoline (E4, E8, E12, E16, and E20), propanol-gasoline (P4, P8, P12, P16, and P20), and pure gasoline. Their study was achieved under different engine loads (800, 1600, and 2400W) and a test to marked 816 type, 30–130dB (A) range noise tester was used to measure the engine's noise emissions. Based on the results, at engine loads 800W and 1600 W, the noise value slightly reduced with E4, E12, E16, and E20 compared to gasoline, while at 2400W, the noise value increased with all ethanol- gasoline blends. The maximum reduction ratio was 0.80% with E20 at 800W and there was significant increment with E8 especially at 2400W. However, for propanol fuel, the noise levels were in an increasing trend with increased propanol."
24,Summary and conclusion,"Alcohol and ether play an increasingly significant role in meeting the energy demand in the automotive sector. In this literature review, information on various types of alcohol (butanol, methanol, ethanol, and fusel oil) and ether (MTBE, and DME) have been summarized in term of its impact on spark ignition engines that could potentially replace petroleum-based fuels or improve the fuel properties. Many factors have to be considered before recommending the utilisation of an alternative fuel for existing technologies at a large scale. Researchers have discussed the factors and few of the significant factors are explained as follows. • Alcohol fuels in high compression ratio should be used to increase the performance of SI engines due to the high octane number. • Alcohol water content such as in fusel oil should be extracted when utilizing it as fuel. • Co-solvent such as fusel oil should be used with methanol to reduce the phase separation problem. • The environmental compatibility of an alternative fuel as compared to fossil fuels should be observed. If the alternative fuel has very high emissions compared to fossil, it would be unacceptable for usage as fuel. • Additional cost on the user in terms of routine maintenance, equipment wear and tear, and lubricating oil's life must be observed. The excessive additional cost will have an adverse impact on the widespread acceptance of this fuel. • Most engine combustion characteristics are affected by the following factors: alcohols feedstock's (sources), alcohol content, octane number, advance injection timing and combustion, oxygen contents, engine load, engine speed, density and viscosity. • Alcohol production is cheap, simple and eco-friendly. It can be produced locally, hence cutting down the fuel transportation price. Furthermore, it can be utilised immediately in an engine or it can be blended with gasoline [13]. Alcohol and ether have certain chemical and physical characteristics that impact engine performance, emissions, and combustion process directly such as octane number, heating value, oxygen content, carbon content, boiling point and latent heat of evaporation. From this study, the direct influence of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and water content on the heating value have been noted. Higher oxygen content in the fuel dramatically leads to decreased heating value while it is the opposite with carbon content. Due to the high-octane number, MTBE and ethanol have been used as alternative solutions to replace TEL (Tetraethyllead) additives as an octane booster. Furthermore, the most significant problem in utilizing fuel blending is the possibility of the liquid being separated into two phases, known as the phase separation temperature. Some alcohols such as fusel oil are used as a co-solvent to decrease the phase separation temperature of gasoline-methanol blends, thereby increasing the stability of the blend. Engine torque and power increased slightly when using alcohols fuel, while fuel consumption increased significantly. It has been proven in significant research octane rating has the ability to provide higher power, torque, and engine efficiency by increasing the compression ratio. A fuel with a higher octane rating can endure higher CR before the engine starts knocking, therefore enabling the engine to produce more power efficiently and reduce fuel consumption. In conclusion, it can be stated that alcohol and ether offer the highest combustion efficiency at shorter combustion duration due to the high oxygen content. Nevertheless, alcohol with high water content like fusel oil leads to prolonged duration of combustion. Due to the prolonged combustion duration (flame development and flame propagation duration), heat loss through the in-cylinder wall increased, thereby decreasing the thermal efficiency of the engine. Alcohol and ether produce clean burning compared to gasoline, and produce lower carbon monoxide (CO) and oxide of nitrogen (NOx). The CO2 formation is influenced by the (C-H) ratio and oxygen content in fuel. Therefore, CO2 formation increases clearly for ether and alcohol fuels. Nevertheless, ethanol could decrease the carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions to some level, in which the decrease in CO emission is due to the wide flammability and oxygen content of ethanol. Finally, alcohol can be used as a pure fuel in spark ignition engines, but engine modifications are required. Furthermore, alcohol and ether have a significant impact on the environment and greenhouse gases (GHG) and human health in general."
