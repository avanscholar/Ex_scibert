0,Introduction,"Alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol and isopropyl alcohol, have long been considered as key template chemicals to produce aldehydes, alkenes/ethers, ketones, and alkanes through alcohol oxidation, dehydration, and dehydrogenation reactions, respectively [1–3]. Especially the conversion of alcohols into alkenes or ether groups has been extensively investigated, such as ethanol into ethylene or diethyl ether [4,5]. Currently, more attention has been paid to alternative renewable sources due to the increase demand of energy and depletion of fossil fuels [6]. Even though the aforementioned alcohols can be produced from edible biomass resources, their application is limited due to the high cost of raw material [7]. For the last ten years, the conversion of nonedible biomass feedstock to highly valuable fuels and chemicals has been a highly sought-after research topic [8]. As a lignocelluloses derived alcohol, furfuryl alcohol (FA, C5H6O2) is an attractive resource [9] that can be converted into valuable chemicals such as levulinic acid [10] and ethyl levulinate [11]. FA oligomers in the range of C9-C25, which can be produced from FA intermolecular dehydration, are possible precursors for the production of C9-C25 hydrocarbons [12]. Previously, we have investigated the formation of these short chain FA oligomers through the liquid phase dehydration and condensation reaction using various acid catalysts [13–15]. It has been reported that bulk molybdenum oxide (MoO3) catalysts can be active and selective for many reactions, such as selective oxidation, and dehydrogenation [16,17]. Goncharov et al. found that two and three hydrocarbon fragments of CH3OH could be coupled to form longer hydrocarbon chains over solid MoO3 catalysts through a dehydration reaction [18]. Thus here we preferably studied the MoO3 in a similar FA dehydration reaction. FA conversion and selectivity towards oligomers were studied using quantitative analytic method with Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometer. On another hand, the general character of MoO3 catalyzed reactions often require the intake of oxygen species from the catalyst surface or transfer hydrogen species to the catalysts surface [19]. Both these two steps will cause either unpaired electron or extra electron delocalized to the Mo6+ center, thus, reduce the charge of Mo to lower than 6+. This is also the reason for the color change of the reduced MoO3 from light blue to dark blue [20]. The partially reduced Mo5+ species were considered as the active sites for several chemical reactions, such as hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction [21]. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report identifying the active sites during the FA dehydration reaction over bulk MoO3. In this paper, we tried to define such active sites by investigating the change of structure and oxidation state of bulk MoO3 using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) technique."
1,Experimental sections,
2,Catalytic FA dehydration reaction,"2.1 Catalytic FA dehydration reaction Furfuryl alcohol (C5H6O2, 98%), and Molybdenum (VI) oxide (≥99.5%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Prior to be used in the experiment, MoO3 were sieved through a 40-mesh sieve (425 μm pore size, Fisher Scientific) to remove the granular particle. Clean glass vials containing 3.00 g of FA and 0.30 g of MoO3 were prepared. Mixtures were heated at 100 °C and ambient pressure under stirring within an aluminum block covered by heating tape (HTS/Amptek, 1.30 A, 156 W) for 2–6 h. After the target reaction time was reached, the glass vials were immediately transported to a beaker of ice water to stop further reactions. Centrifugation at 4000 rpm was used to separate the solid catalysts from the liquid samples. The collected liquid samples were stored in the refrigerator for further characterization. To test a catalyst recyclability, spent MoO3 catalysts (6 h) were initially washed with methanol and water 3 times each, dried overnight in ambient conditions, and then treated in 100 mL/min air (Airgas, Extra dry) at 110 °C for 1 h with a ramping rate of 4 °C/min. Finally, catalysts were calcined at 450 °C in air (100 mL/min) for 4 h. The regenerated MoO3 catalysts were reused in FA dehydration reaction under the same reaction condition (100 °C and 6 h) for a total of four times."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The fresh, spent and regenerated MoO3 were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The Raman spectra were obtained with visible excitation (514 nm, He-Ne laser, Renishaw inVia Raman microscope). The scattered photons were directed into a single monochromator and focused onto an air-cooled charge-coupled device. The Raman shift was calibrated with a built-in silicon standard sample based on the peak at 520 cm−1. The Raman spectrometer was equipped with an upright optical microscope (Lecia DM2500 M), which was used for focusing. All Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature and ambient pressure. An 1800 line/mm grating was used to provide a resolution of ˜1 cm−1. The spectral acquisition times were 10 scans accumulated at 10 s/scan. X-ray diffraction patterns of the studied MoO3 samples were taken on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer (Cu Kα λ = 1.54059 Å, 5–125° 2θ, 0.02° step size, 2.4 s/step) in Bragg-Brentano geometry with a D-tex Ultra solid-state strip detector. A quantitative Rietveld analysis was conducted with the program TOPAS-Academic v5.0© 1998–2012 by Alan Coelho to determine lattice parameters (details in Supporting Information. S1). XPS was performed on a SPECS Phoibos 100 hemispherical analyzer using Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) X-ray source at the Center for Functional Nanomaterial (CFN) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The surface charging effect during measurement was compensated by referencing the binding energy (BE) of C 1s (BE = 284.2 eV) as an internal standard. The XPS spectral fitting was performed using the CASA XPS software with RSF value for 3d5/2 and line shape GL(30). The compositions and concentrations of obtained liquid products were identified by a PerkinElmer GC/MS and GC/FID using a similar method described in our previous work [15]."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Fresh & spent catalysts,"3.1 Fresh & spent catalysts After the FA dehydration reaction, the color of MoO3 turned to dark blue, compared with the light blue color of fresh MoO3 (Fig. 1 inserted photo). This indicates the presence of Mo centers with an oxidation state lower than 6+ [20,22]. In order to understand the molecular and electronic structure of fresh and used MoO3, we utilized several spectroscopic techniques, such as XRD, Raman, and XPS, and results are shown in the following sections. 3.1.1 XRD The XRD measurements were carried out to distinguish structure differences of fresh, spent, and regenerated MoO3 samples (Fig. 1). All MoO3 samples showed same orthorhombic crystal character at 12.74°, 23.33°, 25.70°, 27.33°, 38.98°, which corresponds to (020), (110), (040), (021), and (060) planes, respectively (JCPDS 05-0508, α-MoO3) [23]. The orthorhombic α-MoO3 is most common and thermodynamically stable with a layered structural arrangement of edge- and corner-linked MoO6 octahedra [24], as the schematic diagram shown in Fig. 2 . Each layer of MoO3 is consist of one and half heavily distorted 6-fold octahedra (highlighted in brown color in Fig. 2). According to Kihlborg’s X-ray analysis, the closest four oxygen neighbors tend to be tetrahedrally arranged around the Mo [25]. Thus the structure of MoO3 may be alternatively considered as build up by two layers of 4-fold tetrahedra MoO4. In the XRD results, both fresh and regenerated MoO3 are all observed to have a similar high intensity of the (0k0: (020), (040), and (060)) diffraction lines, indicating a preferential orientation along b-direction in fresh and regenerated MoO3. On the other hand, the intensity of (0k0) peaks of the spent MoO3 decreased, indicating a reduced b-direction preferential orientation. As shown in Fig. 2, the MoO3 layers are packed along b direction. Thus a disorder may be introduced between the MoO3 layers in less b-direction orientated spent MoO3. The Rietveld refinement patterns and parameters of fresh, spent, and regenerated MoO3 samples are shown in Figure S1 and Table 1 . It was observed that the calculated patterns are in good agreement with the experimental patterns. The refined lattice parameter are also listed in Table 1. Compared with the fresh MoO3, no contraction of any of the a-, b-, and c-axis was observed on spent MoO3, which indicates that oxygen atom was not been removed during the FA dehydration reaction, otherwise a contraction of the lattice parameters should be observed. An obvious elongation of the b-axis of 0.56 pm was observed on spent MoO3 which indicate the elongation of MoO bond. The slight elongation of a- and c-axis of ˜0.1 pm in spent MoO3 may possibly be due to the general distortion of the tetrahedron brought about by the elongation of b-axis and possibly the decreasing of oxidation state of molybdenum slightly. After regeneration, the lattice parameters were restored to the similar value as in fresh MoO3, except the b-axis was still slightly elongated of 0.09 pm. From this result it can therefore be inferred that oxidation state of regenerated MoO3 sample was not fully recovered to 6+, although sample color was very similar compared to the fresh sample’s color. 3.1.2 Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy is known sensitive to the metal-ligand distance, coordination, and the symmetry around the metal centers [26]. Thus, the changes in Raman spectra can be used to gain information about the structure change around the Mo center. The Raman spectra of fresh, spent, and regenerated MoO3 are shown in Fig. 3 . For a better comparison, the Raman bands are normalized to the band at 823 cm−1. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the Raman spectra of MoO3 samples contain single crystal bands of α-MoO reported by Py and Maschke, and other researchers [27–30]: 116 cm−1 (B2g, translational rigid MoO4 chain mode), 129 cm−1 (B3g, translational rigid MoO4 chain mode), 159 cm−1 (Ag/B1g, translational rigid MoO4 chain mode), 197 cm−1 (B2g, OMoO twist), 216 cm−1 (Ag, rotational rigid MoO4 chain mode), 247 cm−1 (B3g, OMoO twist), 285 cm−1 (B2g, OMoO wagging), 293 cm−1 (B3g, OMoO wagging), 334 cm−1 (Ag/B1g, OMoO bend), 366 cm−1 (A1g, OMoO scissor), 376 cm−1 (B1g), 380 (B1g, OMoO scissor), 473 cm−1 (Ag, νas OMoO stretch and bend), 667 cm−1 (B2g/B3g, νas OMoO stretch), 823 cm−1 (Ag, νs MoO stretch), and 996 cm−1 (Ag, νas MoO stretch). The Raman spectra of fresh and regenerated MoO3 are identical while the spent MoO3 showed intensity variation for bands at 129 cm−1, 159 cm−1, 293 cm−1, and 996 cm−1, which will be further discussed in the following. It was also noted that such variation were unlikely caused by the formation of soft coke or precursor, as no D- and G- band in the region of 1300–1700 cm−1 were observed on spent MoO3 (spectra not shown for brevity). In the 4 fold tetrahedral MoO3 model, the shortest two bonds (167 and 173 nm), as shown in Fig. 2, are considered as two different MO bonds that arranged along b-axis and a-axis correspondingly [22]. Thus we are able to observe a symmetry MoO stretching mode at 823 cm−1 and an asymmetry MoO stretching at 996 cm−1 in the Raman spectra (Fig. 3(a)). In fresh and regenerated MoO3 Raman spectra, the intensity of asymmetry stretching band at 996 cm−1 was lower than that of the symmetry stretching band at 823 cm−1 (I966/I823 = 0.41). However, after the reaction, the 996 cm−1 band gained higher intensity than that of 823 cm−1 band (I966/I823 = 1.60). Previously Ozkan et al. observed a similar intensity change in the differently oriented MoO3 crystallites [31]. The authors observed that the band at 996 cm−1 was more intense than the band at 823 cm−1 when MoO3 samples contain a lower ratio of basal-to-side plane area (i.e., (010)/(100)). Thus the high I966/I823 intensity of MoO bands in spent MoO3 Raman spectra can be attributed to the reduced basal planes. This result is in line with previous XRD pattern that the spent MoO3 has attenuated (0k0) diffraction lines which are associated with the basal planes. In addition to the high I966/I823 intensity ratio, the 996 cm−1 band in spent MoO3 was broader than that of fresh or regenerated MoO3 sample (Fig. 3(b)), indicating a distortion of the crystalline structure in spent MoO3 [32]. Such distortion can be explained as a result of elongating Mo = O bond. Thus it could be postulated that after the FA dehydration reaction, the terminal MO bond along b-axis was been elongated and MoO3 gradually lost crystalline along b-direction. In Fig. 3(c), two OMoO wagging mode at 285 (B2g) and 293 cm−1 (B3g) were observed in all studied MoO3 samples. For fresh and regenerated MoO3, the intensity of 293 cm−1 band was around half of the 285 cm−1 band intensity (I293/I285 = 0.54), which is very similar to the observed value in the single-crystal MoO3 [33]. In the case of spent MoO3, however, the 293 cm−1 band gained higher intensity than the band at 823 cm−1 (I293/I285 = 1.10). It is note that even though the two Mo = O bonds are in a- and b-axis, the wagging mode of the MoO groups are both polarized parallel to the c-axis, but belong to different symmetry [34]. Thus the changing intensity ratio of B2g and B3g wagging mode has been used to estimate the structure distortion along c-axis, such as those introduced by mechanical stress or oxygen vacancies [22,35]. The different I966/I823 intensity between fresh and spent MoO3 may be attributed to a different distortion of MoO4 chain. According to the refined lattice parameter, c-axis was slightly elongated in spent MoO3. Therefore the high I293/I285 ratio can be explained as a consequence of the extension of MoO4 chain due to the change of Mo = O bond length. It was shown that the translation or rigid chain Raman modes (RCM), such as bands at 116 cm−1 (B2g), 129 cm−1 (B3g), and 159 cm−1 (Ag/B1g), are very sensitive to the change of particle crystallite size [22,33]. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the RCM band at 159 cm−1 was intensified in spent MoO3 compared with the fresh and regenerated MoO3 samples. This represented an increased packing along b-direction [36]. It is possible that the elongated Mo = O bond results in reduced spacing between MoO3 layers, thus the MoO3 layers were packed more closely along b-direction. The other two RCM bands at 129 cm−1 and 116 cm−1 were reported to directly relate to the general particle size [22,35]. Previously, Mestl et al. found a high I130/I117 value tends to reveal a large crystallite size [22]. Based on the literature result, the particle size of the spent MoO3 were likely larger than those of fresh and regenerated MoO3. Because the intensity ratio of I129/I116 of fresh and regenerated MoO3 are similar, it can be predicted a similar particle size of those two samples. The increased particle size in spent MoO3 was probably the result of the expansion of lattice parameters, as revealed in XRD analysis. 3.1.3 XPS To study the state of Mo species on the surface we investigate the binding energy of the Mo 3d transition peaks of the fresh, spent and regenerated MoO3. As shown in Fig. 4 , the Mo 3d spectrum of fresh MoO3 showed characteristic 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 doublet at binding energy of 235.7 eV and 232.6 eV, respectively, in good agreement with literature value for Mo6+ in MoO3 [37]. In the case of spent MoO3, these two peaks were shifted to 1 eV lower in energy (234.7 eV and 231.6 eV for 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 respectively), indicating a reduction of Mo6+ to Mo5+ [38]. No peaks corresponding to Mo4+ or Mo metal could be detected [39]. This Mo oxidation state change matches well with the color change of MoO3 as lower oxidation state tend to provide a dark blue color [20]. The Mo 3d peaks in the regenerated MoO3 were in the same position compared with fresh MoO3 (Mo6+), but a broad of the peak towards lower energy may indicates a mixed oxidation states contributed from Mo5+ and Mo6+. It is noted that a small shoulder peak at ˜232 eV was presented on the fresh MoO3, indicating there could be small amount of Mo5+ in fresh MoO3. According to the peak fitting results in Figure S2, the Mo5+/Mo6+ ratio for the fresh MoO3 is about 9:91, and about 21:79 for the regenerate MoO3. Although both fresh and regenerated MoO3 have varied portion of Mo5+ and Mo6+, their XRD and Raman spectra are identical. Only spent MoO3 (100% Mo5+) showed a different XRD and Raman results, which was previously proved to be caused by the presence of structural distortion in spent MoO3. In here, such structural distortion also likely caused the severely decreased XPS peak intensity. Meanwhile, it’s also noted that regenerated MoO3 also has slightly structural distortion (b-axis lattice parameter was extended for 0.09 pm), thus the regenerated MoO3 also showed relative low XPS peak intensity compared to fresh MoO3. The reduction of MoO3 is often encountered with the formation of oxygen deficiency while these oxygen deficiency should be completely removed upon proper calcination under oxygen supply. However our regenerated MoO3 didn’t show a similar Mo 3d peak character compared with fresh MoO3, indicating the reduction of MoO3 in the spent MoO3 was not caused by the loss of oxygen. Previously Wang and Ueda found that the Mo6+ site with extra delocalized electron can show a reduced Mo5+ character [20]. Thus the calcination process cannot fully restore the oxidation state if the reduction was caused by the electron delocalization. The above assumption can also possibly explain the slightly elongated b-axis lattice parameter in regenerated MoO3 as a results of not fully restoring Mo5+ to Mo6+."
6,Catalyst activity,"3.2 Catalyst activity 3.2.1 Reaction time effect The activity of MoO3 on the FA dehydration and condensation reaction with time-on-stream are plotted in Fig. 5 . Based on GC/MS results (not shown), the products contain 5 dimer (C9-C10), 2 trimer (C14-C15), and several unidentified heavy oligomers (>C15), which are very similar to what we previously observed by using other bulk metal oxide catalysts [14,15]. Here by using MoO3, it was observed that the FA conversion increased monotonically from ˜10 wt% at 2 h to ˜24 wt% at 6 h, while the selectivity of dimers and trimers showed an inverse trend. This appears to be associated with a kinetic inhibition of by one or more of undesired FA dehydration products, such as FA heavy oligomers. Previously, by using a density functional theory (DFT) calculation, it was reported that the formation of heavy oligomer (or increasing number of furfuryl groups) is favorable with increasing reaction time [40]. The observed results were well matched to the theoretical calculation and explained that although the increase of reaction time provides higher conversion, it favors the formation of heavy oligomers which results in lower dimer and trimer selectivity. The FA reaction rate (Converted FA(g)/Catalyst loading(g)/Reaction time(hr), 1/hr) results are also presented in Fig. 5 as a function of reaction time. It was found that reaction rate show similar decreased trend as that of the selectivity to dimers and trimers. As mentioned in previous Raman section (Fig. 3), we didn’t observe a significant amount of soft coke deposition, such as D and G bands, on spent MoO3. Thus the catalyst deactivation, as represented by decreased reaction rate, could be attributed to transformation of Mo6+ to Mo5+. Based on the Raman and XPS results, it can be concluded that the Mo6+ site is more active than Mo5+ sites towards FA dehydration process. Overall, the above observed results provided that both reaction rate and selectivity can be controlled by a reaction time. For instance, short reaction time is favorable to increase reaction rate and selectivity simultaneously. 3.2.2 Recyclability As observed in the previous XRD and Raman results, even though MoO3 showed some structure distortion after the reaction, upon proper calcination, its structure was recovered back to the same as fresh MoO3. However by using XPS, it was found that the Mo oxidation state was only restored from 5+ to a mixture of 5+/6+, even after regeneration process. Thus in order to confirm the reactivity of Mo5+/6+, the regenerated MoO3 was used again for the FA dehydration reaction under the same reaction condition for a total of four times. As shown in Fig. 6 , the fresh and regenerated catalysts showed similar FA conversion for four cycles: ˜24.4 wt.% (1st), ˜24.3 wt.% (2nd), ˜23.9 wt.% (3rd), and ˜23.1 wt.% (4th). The selectivity values of dimers and trimers also showed similar values, 43–40%. Thus the catalytic activity and selectivity of Mo6+ and Mo5+/6+ during FA dehydration were very similar and the reactivity of MoO3 can be recovered after calcining catalysts at 450 °C for 4 h. Our observation matches with Roman-Leshkov’s finding that calcination at 400 °C is enough to burn off the deposited soft coke on the catalysts surface and fully restore its catalytic activity [21], although we didn’t observe the presence of soft coke in our spent catalysts. According to previous XPS analysis that both fresh and regenerated are mix of Mo5+/6+, although their portion are different, thus the presence of enough amount of Mo6+ sites (79%) in spent MoO3 were able to restore most structure distortion, as previously evidenced by Raman and XRD. Because the catalytic performance was observed to be independent of ratio of Mo5+/Mo6+ based on current recyclability test, the structure integrity is an important factor to attribute the different activity as observed on Mo6+ and Mo5+ sites. It can be concluded that after FA dehydration reaction, both structure and activity of MoO3 can be restored by simple washing and calcination procedures."
7,Proposed reaction mechanism,"3.3 Proposed reaction mechanism As shown in previous results and analysis, after FA dehydration reaction, MoO3 was found to have an elongated MoO bond and Mo oxidation state was changed from Mo6+ to Mo5+. Typically, in the dehydration reaction, oxygen from the bulk MoO3 is not transferred to the hydrocarbon products [41]. During the FA dehydration reaction, the absence of an oxidized product suggest that the surface MoO or MoO bonds were not broken. Thus a proper model will be required to explain the reduction of Mo6+ as a result of the elongation of MoO bond, instead of the breaking of Mo-oxygen bonds. Wang and Ueda claimed that the terminal oxygen atoms of MoO bonds on the (010) basal plane resemble oxygen anion radicals and act as active sites for the adsorption and activation of benzyl alcohols by electrophilic attack [20]. The proposed model was able to accommodate the Mo oxidation change during an alcohol dehydration reaction. Fig. 7 illustrates a similar model based on the 4 fold tetrahedral MoO3 structure. Furfuryl alcohol was firstly activated on a b-axis Mo = O site to form a furfuryl carbocation. During this activation, one electron from the oxygen atom is lent to the Mo center, thus the oxidation state of Mo reduced from 6+ to 5+. As a result, the MoO bond is been elongated. The furfuryl carbocation further react with another furfuryl alcohol monomer to form several oligomer products (e.g., 2-hydroxymethyl-5 (5-furfuryl) furan and 2,2′ difurfuryl ether) and water. The character of MoO bonds along a-axis are between single and double bond. Therefore the oxygen atom of a-axis MoO bond does not have a similar radical property as b-axis MoO band and cannot become the active sites for furfuryl alcohol dehydration. It is noted that the spent MoO3 maintains the blue color before the regeneration process. Thus desorption of the oligomer products from MoO3 surface didn’t fully recover the MoO bond. Because we’ve previously determined that the activity had not been suppressed severely in the regenerated MoO3 whose oxidation state is a mix of Mo5+/6+, the MoO site on Mo5+ can possibly activate the FA dehydration reaction through a similar pathway, as shown in Fig. 7."
8,Conclusion,"Furfuryl alcohol dehydration and condensation reactions over bulk molybdenum oxide catalysts were investigated to determine the catalytic active sites. FA conversion was observed to increase as an increase of reaction time. However, longer reaction time tended to limit the selectivity to dimers and trimers due to the continuous formation of FA heavy oligomers. The MoO3 after 6 h reaction was found to have a lower oxidation state (Mo5+) with a distorted structure. These were caused by the change of terminal (b-direction) MoO bond due to the activation of FA on MoO3 surface. Such transformation from Mo6+ to Mo5+ could possibly lead to the decreased reaction rate at longer reaction time. Upon proper calcination, the distorted structure were fully resorted while the oxidation state showed a mix of Mo5+/6+. Recyclability results showed no change in catalytic activity for both fresh and regenerated MoO3, indicating both Mo6+ and Mo5+/6+ are the active sites for the FA dehydration and condensation reaction. The overall sequence of activity towards FA dehydration and condensation reaction should be concluded as Mo6+ ≈ Mo5+/6+ > Mo5+."
