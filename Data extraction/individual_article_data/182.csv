0,Introduction,"The use of cleaner energy to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and mitigate climate change has become one of the main concerns of the United Nations. Among possible cleaner energy sources, hydrogen (H2) has arisen as an attractive solution towards the decarbonization of different sectors by using fuel cells (FC) to produce considerable amounts of energy with negligible CO2 emissions [1]. FC are a promising technology in rural areas, where public power grid is not available and, consequently, the use of fossil fuels such as diesel is the current option to cover energy needs [2]. The non-centrifugal sugar industry is an outstanding sector that highly contributes to the social and economic development of Colombia [3]. Nowadays, within this agroindustrial supply chain, bagasse and sugarcane press-mud are commonly obtained as main by-products. While bagasse is normally employed as a heat source inside the process, sugarcane press-mud is used as fertilizer or unproperly discharged, producing environmental issues [4,5]. Hence, the up-grading of sugarcane press-mud could decrease the environmental impact and might boost the non-centrifugal sugar sector. Recently, we reported the conversion of sugarcane press-mud into H2 by integrating (i) pretreatment, (ii) fermentation, (iii) distillation, and (iv) ethanol steam reforming (ESR) [6,7]. Among them, both hydrolysis and fermentation are critical stages due to the possible formation of undesired components such as fusel alcohol and acetic acid. Fusel alcohol refers mainly to 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol. Several studies reported that these components have a negative effect on ESR [7–10]. Commonly, the mitigation of those components has been thoroughly investigated during fermentation, in which variables such as nitrogen, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and yeast strain affect their formation [11]. However, the effect of pretreatment on the production of fusel alcohol has been shortly explored [12,13]. Nowadays, there are a wide spectrum of pretreatment methods including acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, steam explosion, and organosolv [14], whose purpose is to either break down complex structures present in lignocellulosic materials [15] or to increase the production of metabolites during fermentation [16]. Acid hydrolysis is a promising pretreatment method compared to other alternatives such as enzymatic hydrolysis because its industrial-level facility, short reaction times, and low cost associated to the homogeneous catalyst [15,17]. Catalytic activity during acid hydrolysis is strongly related with the acid strength of the homogeneous catalyst. Due to the low cost [18] and high acid strength [19], sulfuric acid is the widest employed. Other acids such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and nitric acid (HNO3) have been employed to pretreat biomass [20]. The latter is suitable because of its shorter reaction time, higher saccharification efficiency, lower formation of fermentation inhibitors (i.e., furfural and 3,5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF)), and the fact that nitrates formed by neutralization could be employed as nitrogen source in the further fermentation process [18,21,22]. The catalytic activity of acid hydrolysis is governed by the acid strength and temperature. Elevated acid strength of the catalyst dissolves and hydrolyzes the carbohydrates, whereby yielding fermentable sugars named reducing sugar [23]. The acid strength is directly related with the H+ ions that interact with the carbohydrate structure cleaving the COC bonds [19]. Besides, temperature enhances the reaction rate of the carbohydrate decomposition towards the formation of reducing sugar and inhibitors [24]. Acid hydrolysis catalyzed with HNO3 to produce bioethanol has been focused on the assessment of its variables, such as temperature, acid loading, and time, over the production of reducing sugar instead of their further effect on the ethanol and fusel alcohol production by fermentation [18,25,26]. As different pretreatments might lead to different bioethanol profiles, it is pertinent to determine whether the pretreatment variables influence the further fermentation to produce ethanol and fusel alcohol. For that reason, defining proper conditions during pretreatment can mitigate the formation of fusel alcohol by keeping the ethanol concentration as higher as possible in order to warrant a higher H2 yield during ESR. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of temperature and acid loadings over the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud for its further conversion into bioethanol through fermentation. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of the effect of pretreatment variables over the fusel alcohol formation during fermentation of biomass hydrolysates."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Material acquisition and characterization,"2.1 Material acquisition and characterization Sugarcane press-mud employed in this study was collected from the Andean region in Colombia. Sugarcane press-mud samples were transported from the facilities to Universidad de La Sabana (Bogotá, Colombia), stored in 50 mL flasks, and kept at 0 °C until use. Samples presented the following average composition: 69.79 ± 5.98 % moisture; 22.95 ± 4.62 % carbohydrates; 3.19 ± 1.58 % wax; 1.12 ± 1.10 crude fiber; 2.08 ± 0.53 ashes; and 0.87 ± 0.56 % proteins [6]."
3,Pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud followed by fermentation of hydrolysates,"2.2 Pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud followed by fermentation of hydrolysates Bioethanol production from sugarcane press-mud was performed through hydrolysis followed by fermentation [26–28]. Fermentation parameters such as temperature, stirring, pH, time, and inoculum volume remained unchanged. All the conditions are explained as follows. 2.2.1 Sample preparation To enhance the filtration of the samples, 50 g of sugarcane press-mud were initially diluted with Milli-Q water until solid concentration was set to 17 wt.%, followed by a vigorous stirring for 10 min to guarantee homogeneity. After that, sugarcane press-mud was equally split into five different samples and the initial pH of each sample was measured with a potentiometer (Schott CG 843 P, Germany). Different HNO3 loadings were added to adjust the pH of the samples. A 3 M HNO3 aqueous solution was prepared from HNO3 65 % (EMSURE®, Merck, Germany). Figure S.1, Supplementary Material S.1 shows the correlation between the amount of HNO3 added to the sugarcane press-mud and the pH difference (ΔpH = 4.8 – pHfinal) (R2 = 0.99), i.e., pH will drop 0.17 units for each gram of HNO3. 2.2.2 Hydrolysis Once HNO3 was added, samples were put into an autoclave (Tomy SX-700, Japan) at different temperatures, ranged from 110 °C to 130 °C, for 1 h. After hydrolysis, samples were placed on an ice-water bath to stop reaction. Afterwards, pH was adjusted to the fermentation pH (i.e., 5.5 ± 0.1) and samples were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C, Sorvall ST16R, Thermo, USA) to separate solid and liquid phases. Liquid phase was filtered through out a 0.45 μm nitrate cellulose membrane (Sartorius, Germany). The recovered filtrate was conserved under refrigeration (0 °C) until fermentation. Carbohydrate and reducing sugar content were monitored after pretreatment according to the methods described in Section 2.5. Besides, to determine the effect of the pretreatment, the combined severity factor (CSF) was calculated according to Eq. (1). This factor gives an estimation of the severity of reaction conditions [25]. The higher the CSF value, the harsher the conditions on the pretreatment. (1) C S F = log 10 t . exp T R - T 0 14.75 - p H In Eq. (1), t is the hydrolysis time in min (i.e., 60 min); TR is the reaction temperature in °C, and T0 is the reference temperature in °C (i.e., 100 °C). The CSF has been employed to assess the combined effect of operational variables over the decomposition products analyzed in this study (i.e., total carbohydrates and reducing sugar). 2.2.3 Inoculum preparation The inoculum was prepared according to Sanchez et al. [5]. Dry yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ethanol Red®, Fermentis, France) was activated in water at 30 °C during 20 min. After that, yeast was conserved in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) (Oxoid, New Hampshire, England) at 30 °C during 48 h. Then, yeast was propagated into YPD medium (i.e., Glucose 2 g L−1, Peptone 2 g L−1, yeast extract 1 g L−1) at 30 °C until the yeast concentration reached about 107 colony forming units per mL (CFU mL−1). Cell growth, in terms of CFU mL−1, was measured by serial dilution in PDA slant [29], which along with microscopic examination, were employed to check the purity of the fermentation culture for the different fermentation tests [30]. Yeast strains were the sole identified microorganism, as shown in Figure S.2, Supplementary Material S.1. 2.2.4 Microfermentation assays Fermentation assays were performed in a Bioscreen C (Labsystems, Finland) at constant agitation, 30 °C, and 48 h. 360 μL of pretreated and filtrated sugarcane press-mud was poured in a microplate, followed by the addition of 40 μL of inoculum prepared according to Section 2.2.3. Bioscreen C has been employed to determine inhibitory effects in yeasts [31] and to assess ethanol production [32]. After fermentation, samples were collected in Eppendorf and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4 °C, and 6 min in a microcentrifuge (Microlite RF, Thermo, USA) to recover the bioethanol fraction. Bioethanol composition was determined according to the GC method described in Section 2.5. Also, carbohydrates and reducing sugar content were monitored after fermentation and determined by the methods described in Section 2.5. 2.2.5 Statistical analysis A split-plot experimental design was performed to assess the effect of catalyst loading and temperature over bioethanol profile obtained from sugarcane press-mud. The big plot was set as temperature, whereas HNO3 loading was set as the small plot. Detailed data of the experimental design is shown in Table S.1, Supplementary Material S.1. Working temperatures were 110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C; and HNO3 loadings were selected in order to adjust pH to the following values: 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0. The amount of HNO3 added to the sample was correlated with pH, as shown in Figure S.1, Supplementary Material S.1. pH was used to calculate CSF, which allows to determine the severity of the pretreatment. Samples without catalyst addition were also pretreated at the working temperatures (i.e., 110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C). The initial pH of sugarcane press-mud was 4.8 and control samples -unpretreated- were included. All experiments were carried out by triplicate; hence, a total of 41 experiments were done. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (Cary, NC, USA). Statistical analysis can be observed in [dataset] [33]. 2.2.6 Ethanol yield Ethanol yield measures the amount of ethanol produced in comparison with the theoretical production. This measurement allows to compare the ethanol yield among pretreatments [23,34]. Herein, ethanol yield was calculated according to Eq. (2), where NRS and RS are the amount of non-reducing and reducing sugar, in g L−1, respectively, in the sugarcane press-mud after sterilization. NRS was calculated as the difference between total carbohydrates and reducing sugar content. Conversion factors shown in Eq. (2) were calculated according to the stoichiometric factor for the fermentation reaction of sucrose and glucose, as depicted in Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. For instance, 342 g of sucrose will produce 184 g of ethanol, whereas 180 g of glucose will produce 92 g of ethanol. (2) E t h a n o l Y i e l d ( % ) = E t h a n o l a f t e r f e r m e n t a t i o n g L N R S * 184 342 + R S * 92 189 * 100 (3) C 12 H 22 O 11 + H 2 O → 4 C 2 H 5 O H + 4 C O 2 (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 C 2 H 5 O H + 2 C O 2"
4,Bioethanol production in erlenmeyer flasks,"2.3 Bioethanol production in erlenmeyer flasks Selected conditions from the screening tests were carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks. To do so, about 185 g of sugarcane press-mud was mixed with water in 1:1 vol proportion and pretreated at the selected conditions for 1 h. Afterwards, the samples were put in an ice-water bath to stop the reaction and sieved through a 70-mesh sieve (212 μm) to remove big size solids. The liquid fraction was supplemented with peptone (0.05 g g−1 carbohydrates), yeast extract (0.072 g g−1 carbohydrates), MgSO4.7H2O (0.005 g g−1 carbohydrates), Ca3(PO4)2 (0.002 g g−1 carbohydrates), and (NH4)2SO4 (0.004 g g−1 carbohydrates). pH was adjusted to 5.5. Fermentation were carried out in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 70 h. The reaction volume was 40 % of the total volume and 10 % of an inoculum was added to the fermentation culture [6]. Inoculum was prepared as described in Section 2.2.3. Bioethanol samples were distilled in a rotary evaporator at 75 ± 5 °C and 400 mbar until the ethanol-to-steam ratio was 3. This ratio guarantees energy savings on the conversion of bioethanol through ESR."
5,Mass and energy balances,"2.4 Mass and energy balances Mass balance was performed by monitoring the loss weight of the samples before and after each process stage, i.e., pretreatment, fermentation, and purification. The aim of mass balance was to determine the H2 potential production based on the content of fusel alcohol in the purified bioethanol. Correlation between fusel alcohol impurities and H2 on ESR has been previously reported at 700 °C by using RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 as catalyst, as shown in Supplementary Material S.2. Besides, energy consumption on pretreatment was calculated based on the model described by Mafe et al. [35], as also shown in Supplementary Material S.2."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Carbohydrates were quantified spectrophotometrically by the phenol-sulphuric method using microplates, as described elsewhere [6]. Absorbance was read at 490 nm in a microplate absorbance reader (iMark™, Bio-Rad, California, USA). The amount of carbohydrates was estimated by employing glucose (Carlos Erba, Italy) as standard (0–500 μg mL−1) and expressed as glucose equivalent per liter (GE L−1). Herein, carbohydrates represent the summation of non-reducing and reducing sugar in the sample. This method has been employed to quantify total carbohydrates in different biomass samples, such as sweet sorghum [36], microalgae [37], and sugarcane press-mud [6]. Reducing sugar was quantified spectrophotometrically by the 3,5-dynitro-salicylic (DNS) method described by Miller et al. [38] and modified by Gonҫalves et al. [39], using a 96-well microplate. Absorbance was read at 570 nm in a UV–vis microreader (Thermo-Fischer, USA). The amount of reducing sugar was estimated by employing glucose (Carlos Erba, Italy) as standard (0–4.0 g L−1), expressed as glucose equivalent per liter (GE L−1). Ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetic acid, and HMF were quantified using a Clarus 580 GC (GC, Perkin Elmer, USA), equipped with an Elite wax ETR column (60 m, 0.25 mm ID, Perkin Elmer, USA) connected to a Flame Ionization Detector (FID). Both, detector and injector temperatures, were adjusted to 240 °C. The oven was programmed as follows: 80 °C for 1 min, followed by a heating rate of 8 °C min−1 until 230 °C for 10 min. Raw and processed data for carbohydrate, reducing sugar, ethanol, and fusel alcohol content can be observed in [dataset] [33]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of temperature and HNO3 loadings on the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud,"3.1 Effect of temperature and HNO3 loadings on the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud Fig. 1 shows the variation of carbohydrates and reducing sugar content in terms of CSF. This factor allows to integrate the effect of reaction time, temperature, and pH into a single variable; thus, easing the comprehension of the pretreatment effect over the response variables such as bioethanol and aliphatic composition. pH was correlated with HNO3 loadings as shown in Figure S.1, Supplementary Material S1 and therefore used as variable during the pretreatment. Fig. 1 a shows the effect of the pretreatment over the carbohydrate content. The content of carbohydrate without any pretreatment is shown as a continuous line. Carbohydrates represent the total amount of polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and monosaccharides present in the sugarcane press-mud. Although a slight decrease of carbohydrates was observed in Fig. 1a, Table 1 shows that pH, temperature, and the interaction between pH and temperature had not a significant effect over the carbohydrate content (P < 0.05); hence, total carbohydrates were statistically unaffected by the pretreatment conditions. Bower et al. [40] reported a similar behavior during the acid hydrolysis of sucrose with H2SO4. They showed that, under CSF values lower than 1.0, degradation of monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose is not significant, and the content of sugars was enough to carry out the fermentation to yield ethanol. Table 1 also shows that pH had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on the reducing sugar content during sugarcane press-mud pretreatment and Fig. 1 b depicts that reducing sugar content increased in a S-shape with CSF. Reducing sugar such as glucose and fructose are derived from the hydrolysis of sucrose in the presence of H+ under acidic conditions. Hence, the higher the amount of the acid catalyst, the higher the amount of the reducing sugar. Moreover, a slight increment of the reducing sugar content under hydrothermal conditions (i.e., no catalyst addition, white filling in Fig. 1b) was observed. Herein, hydrothermal conditions refer to hot water hydrolysis in which pressure is below the critical point at the temperature condition [41,42]. Under such conditions, dissociation of water molecules into H+ and OH− takes place and they catalyze the decomposition of carbohydrates into reducing sugar [23,43]. The addition of small amounts of catalyst (∼3.6 g HNO3 kg-1 solid, light gray in Fig. 1b) increased considerably the reducing sugar content, mainly associated with the catalytic activity of HNO3 that cleaves the polysaccharides and oligosaccharides into monosaccharides. Fig. 1 c shows the percentage of reducing sugar in the sugarcane press-mud hydrolysates within CSF. The highest reducing sugar percentage (94.9 %) was observed under the most severe pretreatment (CSF = 0.67, T = 130 °C, pH = 2.0, ∼ 16 g HNO3 kg-1 solids). Carbohydrates represent the summation of both non-reducing and reducing sugar in the hydrolysates. During hydrolysis, H+ ions break down the glycosidic bond of non-reducing sugar. Hence, both glucose and fructose, considered as reducing sugar, are releasing and, subsequently, the reducing sugar content increases in the hydrolysate. Therefore, the pretreatment enhances the availability of reducing sugar in the hydrolysate for its further uptake by yeast during fermentation. Aside from the variables mentioned above, the formation of fermentation inhibitors and the liquid recovery are key parameters during the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud. During acid pretreatment of biomass, the degradation of reducing sugar such as glucose leads to the formation of HMF; in turns, the decomposition of HMF leads to the formation of levulinic acid and formic acid, while the decomposition of xylose leads to the formation of furfural [15]. The initial concentration of HMF on the sugarcane press-mud was 1.60 g L−1. Other inhibitors such as furfural and levulinic acid were not detected in the biomass samples. The presence of HMF prior pretreatment is associated with the manufacturing process of non-centrifugal sugar. Commonly, in those facilities, sugarcane juice is concentrated through an evaporation train in which the thermal degradation of carbohydrates by caramelization or Maillard reactions leads to the production of HMF [44–46]. Fig. 2 plots the effect of the HNO3 concentration on the production of HMF during pretreatment. HNO3 loading is correlated with pH of the samples as shown in Figure S.1, Supplementary Material S.1. No other inhibitors were detected during these tests, suggesting that pentoses such as xylose are not present in the sugarcane press-mud. Fig. 2 shows that, initially, HNO3 increased the production of HMF by almost 30 %, but the addition of more HNO3 did not affect its production. HMF is formed according to the following reactions: Sucrose → 2Hexoses → 2HMF + 6 H2O. The catalytic activity of HNO3 is not that high than other common catalysts employed such as HCl and H2SO4. The catalytic activity is measured by the pKa; hence, the more negative the pKa, the higher the effectiveness of the catalyst [20]. Dziekonska-Kubczak et al. [47] reported that, for the same amount of acid, HNO3 produces the lowest HMF (0.15 g L−1), followed by HCl (0.20 g L−1) and H2SO4 (0.74 g L−1) during the pretreatment of Jerusalem Artichoke stalks at 121 °C for 60 min. On the other hand, Zhang et al. [21] reported that the decomposition of hexoses such as glucose did not proceed when HNO3 was used to catalyze the decomposition of corn stover at 160 °C. The production of HMF observed in this study is comparable with that depicted during the pretreatment of Curcuma longa, at 130 °C for 65 min and using H2SO4 as catalyst (2.82 g L-1 HMF) [17], but higher than that reported for sugarcane bagasse (0.30 g L-1 of HMF) [48] at similar reaction conditions (i.e., T = 130 °C for 1 h) and using H2SO4 as catalyst. Differences in the type of material might ease the decomposition of biomass when pretreated with acid catalysts. While Curcuma and sugarcane press-mud are materials with high content of carbohydrates (>60 %) and low content of fiber (<7%), sugarcane bagasse is mainly formed by cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose. The recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic materials such as bagasse requires more severe conditions to break down its structure. Hence, at similar conditions, non-lignocellulosic materials are more affected by pretreatment than lignocellulosic ones. Also, Fig. 2 shows the percentage of the filtered liquid recovered after the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud. This percentage represents the amount of liquid that could be employed as feedstock to produce bioethanol by fermentation, which increased with the amount of HNO3. Sievers et al. [24] reported that pretreatment conditions could reduce the particle size of big molecules to ease filtration. From the description above, we can conclude that pretreatment with HNO3 at 130 °C: (i) increases the reducing sugar concentration; (ii) do not affect the total amount of carbohydrates; (iii) do not promote the HMF production; and iv) enhances the solid-liquid separation. All the hydrolysate samples were fermented at 30 °C by using S. cerevisiae strains during 48 h. In the next section, we explore the effect of the CSF over ethanol and main bioethanol impurities during fermentation."
9,Effect of the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud on the hydrolysate microfermentation,"3.2 Effect of the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud on the hydrolysate microfermentation The hydrolysates recovered from the different pretreatment conditions were fermented in microwells at 30 °C during 48 h and using S. cerevisiae. Before fermentation, the average carbohydrate content was 130.2 ± 25.8 g L−1, as shown in Table S.1, Supplementary Material S.1. Fig. 3 shows the effect of pretreatment over the content of ethanol, fusel alcohol, and acetic acid after fermentation. Ethanol production during fermentation of hydrolysates, obtained under different pretreatment conditions, is depicted in Fig. 3 a. The highest ethanol concentration was 63.6 ± 15.5 g L−1 after the fermentation of the hydrolysate obtained at the following pretreatment conditions: T = 130 °C, pH = 4.8, and without HNO3 addition. At said conditions, the carbohydrate content in the hydrolysate was 130.2 ± 25.8 GE L−1 (Table S.1, in Supplementary Material), carbohydrates conversion during fermentation was approximately 97 % (Fig. 1d), and ethanol yield was 100 % (Table S.1, in Supplementary Material). As expected, the highest ethanol concentration was obtained when the highest both carbohydrate content and conversion were achieved. Table 1 shows that temperature and the interaction between pH and temperature during sugarcane press-mud pretreatment have a significant effect (P < 0.05) over ethanol production after the corresponding hydrolysate fermentation, due to their effect in increasing reducing sugar in the hydrolysate (see Fig. 1b). Among them, temperature have a stronger effect (P < 0.001) than the interaction between pH and temperature (P = 0.026). Temperature effect during sugarcane press-mud pretreatment is more evident at higher pH (pH > 4.0, which represents low HNO3 loadings), where reducing sugar is yielded due to the activity of H+ that breaks down the glycosidic bond of polysaccharides. For instance, when sugarcane press-mud was pretreated with HNO3 loadings lower than 3.7 g kg−1 solids, the pretreatment temperature does have an important effect over the production of reducing sugar (white and light gray filling in Fig. 1b). Hence, for similar pH, the higher the reducing sugar content, the higher the ethanol concentration after 48 h fermentation of the corresponding hydrolysate. Concerning the interaction between temperature and pH, their effect on the ethanol content was also associated with the formation of reducing sugar in the corresponding hydrolysate. As shown in Table 1, reducing sugar content was mainly affected by pH (P < 0.001) and in a low extent by temperature (P = 0.067). During acid hydrolysis, the activity of the inorganic acid (i.e., HNO3) is improved by temperature [19] where non-reducing sugar are decomposed into reducing sugar that are faster up taken by yeast during fermentation [49]. Besides, the addition of 16 g HNO3 kg−1 solid at 130 °C during biomass pretreatment slightly reduces the ethanol content after fermentation by 3.5 % (Fig. 3a). The role of pH during pretreatment for its subsequent ethanol production through alcoholic fermentation was to increase the reducing sugar content, as shown in Fig. 1 b. Sugarcane press-mud is an agroindustrial waste with higher amounts of carbohydrates, mainly sucrose, that can be metabolized by yeast due to the enzymatic activity of invertase, and therefore, yielding fructose and glucose [50]. Both sugar can be converted into ethanol through different metabolic pathways [51]. As shown in Fig. 1d, S. cerevisiae was able to metabolize carbohydrates under unpretreated conditions (∼95 %, continuous line in Fig. 1d). Therefore, non-reducing sugar such as sucrose were hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose during fermentation due to the activity of invertase. However, total carbohydrates conversion was affected by pretreatment, ascribed to differences in the uptake rate of sucrose and glucose which is possibly influenced by inhibitors [49,52–54]. Liu et al. [16] reported a similar behavior during the conversion of sugarcane molasses into succinic acid by using Actinobacillus succinogenes. On the one hand, under sulfuric acid pretreatment (CSF=-2.8; T = 60 °C; pH = 3.5; t = 2 h), carbohydrates conversion was 95.6 %. On the other hand, when molasses was not pretreated, carbohydrates conversion was 85.3 %. Formation of fusel alcohol is depicted in Fig. 3b. Fusel alcohol represents the summation of the main higher alcohols present after the fermentation, i.e., 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol, where the latter was produced in higher concentrations than 2-methyl-1-propanol and 1-propanol during fermentation, as shown in Figure S.3 (see Supplementary Material S.1). This result agrees with those reported during fermentation of standard grape juice [55], sugarcane press-mud [5,6], sugarcane juice [56], maize, rye, and amaranth [57]. Hence, the pretreatment does not have a relevant effect on the fusel alcohol profile. The production of fusel alcohol during fermentation was mainly affected by the temperature of the biomass pretreatment (P < 0.05, Table 1). Indeed, when the hydrolysate was obtained at different temperatures by under similar pH, the fusel alcohol production increased during fermentation (Fig. 3b). Fusel alcohol are derived from the catabolic conversion of amino acids possibly formed during the hydrolysis of proteins and boosted by their conditions [58,59]. Other studies have shown that the pretreatment method has an important effect during the formation of fusel alcohol. For instance, Pielech-Przybylska et al. [13] reported that the formation of 3-methyl-1-butanol was mainly affected by pretreatment. Indeed, the pressureless pretreatment method yielded higher 3-methyl-1-butanol than the thermal-pressure method. Perez-Carrillo et al. [12] showed that the addition of proteases on the pretreatment of sorghum increased the production of fusel alcohols ascribed to the decomposition of proteins into free-amino acids. Amino acids such as Valine and Leucine are precursors on the formation of 2-methyl-1-propanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, respectively, through the Ehrlich metabolic pathway [59]. Besides, Olaniran et al. [52] concluded that the heating conditions during mash preparation do have an impact on the beer flavor, which is associated with the production of minor fermentation compounds such as fusel alcohol. In addition, according to Fig. 3b, the maximum fusel alcohol production during fermentation was 547.4 ± 153.4 mg L−1 and it was observed at the following pretreatment conditions to produce the hydrolysate: CSF = -2.1, 130 °C and without catalyst addition (pH = 4.8). However, the fusel alcohol content was reduced by 20 % during fermentation when 16 g HNO3 kg−1 solid were added on the pretreatment at 130 °C. Acid pretreatment can form undetectable amounts of components such as furaldehydes and formic acid, that might affect the enzymes that are involved in Ehrlich Metabolic Pathway, which is responsible of the formation of 2-methyl-1-propanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol. During fermentation, alcohols are derived from the reduction of aldehyde by the enzyme activity of alcohol dehydrogenases. This enzyme is also involved in the reduction of exogenous aldehydes, such as furaldehydes, by the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a mechanism of detoxification of inhibitors components (i.e., HMF and furfural) [14]. However, activity of alcohol dehydrogenases and NADPH consumption have an important role on the reduction of fusel aldehyde into fusel alcohol by Ehrlich metabolic pathway [59]. Liu and Ma [60] reported that similar genes encode to alcohol dehydrogenases that converts acetaldehyde into ethanol, furaldehydes into furan alcohols, and fusel aldehyde into fusel alcohol. Indeed, alcohol dehydrogenases genes, such as ADH7, increased the transcription activity to carry out the reduction of furaldehydes. Besides, Wang et al. [61] reported the enzyme activity of different alcohol dehydrogenases from Pichia stiptis, a yeast strain employed to produce ethanol, against different aldehydes. They reported that the enzyme activity of an isolated alcohol dehydrogenase was higher when HMF was used as substrate rather than the use of isovaleraldehyde, which is the precursor to produce 2-methyl-1-propanol through Ehrlich metabolic pathway [59]. The higher enzyme activity in the presence of furaldehydes explains the possible decay on fusel alcohol content. Besides, in the same study, the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was also higher in the presence of acetaldehyde, which is the precursor of ethanol in the alcoholic fermentation pathway. The above phenomenon could explain the higher drop on the fusel alcohol content (20 %) than on the ethanol content (3.5 %) at the same CSF. Dack et al. [62] hypothesized that the fermentation of dark malts affected the enzyme activity that participates in the synthesis of fusel alcohol. Fig. 3 c shows the effect of the hydrolysate pretreatment on the acetic acid production during fermentation. The highest acetic acid concentration was observed under acidic conditions whereas the lowest acetic acid content was portrayed under hydrothermal conditions. The pH of the biomass before hydrolysis had a significant effect over the production of acetic acid during fermentation (P < 0.05, in Table 1). Besides, an inverse correlation between carbohydrate conversion and acetic acid concentration was observed after fermentation of hydrolysates, by means of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) = -0.64. Therefore, low carbohydrate conversion during fermentation results in high accumulation of acetic acid. Acetic acid is produced either during hydrolysis or fermentation. In the former case, acetic acid is yielded as product of acetals groups decomposition from the hemicellulose. Whereas in the latter case, the oxidation of acetaldehyde, an intermediary in the alcoholic fermentation pathway, yields said component [7]. Sugarcane press-mud is a source of volatile fatty acids like acetic acid (1760 mg L−1) [4]. Moreover, acetic acid production is improved by the hydrolysis conditions. The more the severe the pretreatment, the higher the acetic acid content in the hydrolysate, as shown by Zheng et al. [63] during the dilute acid pretreatment of sugar beet pulp. Larger content of acetic acid will affect the fermentation stage because acetic acid tends to dissociate under fermentation conditions (i.e., pH = 5.5). According to the pKa of acetic acid (pKa = 4.75) and the Henderson-Hasselbach equation (pH = pKa + Log ([A-])/[HA]), where [A-] represent the dissociated acetic acid and [HA] the undissociated specie, the fraction of undissociated form of acetic acid is 15.3 % when fermentation pH is 5.5. Said fraction permeates the yeast cell and dissociates inside the cytosol, thus releasing H+ and lowering the intracellular pH. To keep the homeostasis, yeast cells expend some ATP (Adenosin triphosphate) molecules to remove protons from the cytosol, directly affecting the fermentation performance and consequently the glucose uptake [64]. Casey et al. [65] showed that acetic acid concentration reduced glucose uptake rate at similar pH during co-fermentation of xylose and glucose. Therefore, an increment on the acetic acid affects the amount of both accumulated and undissociated acid that permeate the yeast cell membrane, thereby resulting in a lower glucose conversion. At 130 °C and in the absence of HNO3, low concentration of acetic acid was registered and possibly that amount affected ethanol production [66]. General speaking, to produce as much ethanol as possible during fermentation, sugarcane press-mud must be pretreated at 130 °C to maximize the glucose availability. However, to mitigate the formation of fusel alcohol, 16 g HNO3 kg−1 solid should be added during pretreatment. At said conditions, ethanol concentration is not highly affected. Therefore, this process was evaluated in Fermentation flasks and the concentration of both ethanol and impurities were followed by distillation, reaching a steam/ethanol ratio of 3:1, which is appropriate for ESR. We explored this in the up-coming section."
10,Bioethanol production in Erlenmeyer flasks,"3.3 Bioethanol production in Erlenmeyer flasks Table 2 shows the detailed composition of both ethanol and fusel alcohol after fermentation and distillation at a scale of 500 g of sugarcane press-mud. Distillation has the purpose to reach a steam/ethanol ratio of 3:1, which is appropriate for ESR. As expected, the concentration of all the fusel alcohol increased after distillation regardless the biomass pretreatment. This result agrees with that previously obtained during the distillation of bioethanol coming from sugarcane press-mud, owing to the similar boiling point of fusel alcohol and ethanol [6]. However, distillation of samples coming from acid hydrolysis showed better performance than those obtained from hydrothermal and unpretreated conditions. Differences among distillation lies on the concentration of compounds present in the raw bioethanol samples, such as solids and fusel alcohol [67,68]. For instance, solid content could negatively influence distillation, as reported by Shihadeh et al. [67] during vacuum distillation of high solids corn ethanol. In our study, vacuum distillation was performed at 0.4 bar, either way samples pretreated under acid hydrolysis are expected to have lower amounts of solids because HNO3 addition eases the liquid-solid phase separation. Therefore, higher ethanol recovery was achieved under acid hydrolysis (i.e., T = 130 °C, 16 g HNO3 kg−1 solid, t =1 h). The results obtained in Table 2 were employed to calculate the H2 potential through mass balance. Detailed mass balance calculations are shown in Supplementary Material S.2. Fig. 4 shows the mass balance to produce H2 from sugarcane press-mud through the different pretreatment methods, as well as the pretreatment energy consumption. Processes highlighted in gray correspond to experimental pretreatment and fermentation of the sugarcane press-mud at a scale of 500 g of sugarcane press-mud. Only the last stage, ESR, was calculated according to a linear correlation (R2 = 0.70) previously described during the conversion of bioethanol through ESR at 700 °C over a RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst [6]. This approach gives insights of a suitable alternative to pretreat sugarcane press-mud for its further conversion into H2. H2 potential changes among the pretreatments. When sugarcane press-mud was not pretreated, H2 potential was about 4.07 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud (Fig. 4a). A slight increment could be forecasted if sugarcane press-mud is pretreated at 130 °C: 4.16 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud (Fig. 4b). However, if HNO3 was added to pretreat sugarcane press-mud at 130 °C, H2 production would be about 5.47 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud (Fig. 4c). This improvement is ascribed to the low content of fusel alcohol, mainly 3-methyl-1-butanol, which strongly affects ESR [6]. Hence, addition of HNO3 during pretreatment at 130 °C will increase H2 production through ESR. Energy consumption during pretreatment is also shown in Table 2. Pretreatment was carried out at 130 °C, which represents an average energy consumption of 1182.3 kJ kg−1 dry sugarcane press-mud. Pretreatment consumes 72.7 MJ and 95.4 MJ kg of H2 produced when sugarcane press-mud was pretreated with and without HNO3, respectively. Therefore, an increment in the H2 production of 40 % (i.e., from 2.08 kg to 2.73 kg in Table 2), reduced the energy consumption by 24 % when sugarcane press-mud is pretreated at 130 °C with 16 g HNO3 kg-1 solid. Consequently, energy savings can be attained if HNO3 is added during pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud. Despite HNO3 is more expensive than other inorganic catalysts such as H2SO4 [69], clear advantages on the use of HNO3 instead of H2SO4 have been reported in literature. For instance, HNO3 shortens the reaction time, increases the saccharification time, and decreases the amounts of inhibitors. Besides, nitrates formed during neutralization could be used by yeast as nitrogen source, thus reducing the amount of extra nitrogen sources and consequently lowering the process costs [18]. Besides, if H2SO4 is used as catalyst, sulfur compounds will have a negative impact on the ESR catalyst [7]. Therefore, sugarcane press-mud pretreated with HNO3 at 130 °C could be the most suitable alternative to obtain H2 among the tested conditions, owing to the low formation of fusel alcohol. Therefore, further studies should seek to evaluate this alternative along with ESR for its further production to H2. The assessment of this alternative must be carried out from an environmental, energetical, and economical point of view."
11,Conclusions,"We assessed the effect of the sugarcane press-mud pretreatment on the bioethanol production by fermentation of the corresponding hydrolysate. During pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud, the effect of pH, related with the addition of HNO3, and temperature were assessed over the production of both ethanol and fusel alcohol during fermentation. Pretreatment temperature (P < 0.05) had a significant effect on the production of alcohols during fermentation, ascribed to an increment of reducing sugar in the hydrolysates. Ethanol and fusel alcohol concentrations were 6% and 27 % higher, respectively, after fermentation when the hydrolysate was obtained at 130 °C without HNO3 addition, than when it was obtained without pretreatment. Furthermore, the addition of HNO3 at 130 °C during pretreatment reduced the concentration of fusel alcohol after fermentation by almost 20 % by keeping similar ethanol levels (∼61 g L−1). Hence, the role of temperature on the pretreatment, for subsequent fermentation, was to increase both ethanol and fusel alcohol content. Whereby, the addition of HNO3 might reduce the fusel alcohol content at 130 °C. Furthermore, mass and energy balances of the overall process, to produce H2 from sugarcane press-mud, showed that acid hydrolysis (CSF = 0.67, T = 130 °C, pH = 2.0, 16 g HNO3 kg−1 solid) could yield 5.46 g H2 kg-1 sugarcane press-mud, which is the best alternative among several evaluated. Further studies must seek to evaluate this alternative from an environmental, energetical, and economical point of view."
