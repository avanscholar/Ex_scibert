0,Introduction,"The green oxidation of alcohols is a beneficial process from industrial and fundamental research perspective [1–3]. Traditionally, the synthesis of aldehydes is based on oxidizing alcohols in halogenated solvents [4], or strong oxidants e.g. hypochlorite, Cr (IV), chlorine, and peracids which are harmful chemical agents [5]. In recent years, photo-induced oxidation has attracted much attention owing to the environmentally friendly processes at mild conditions. With appropriate design of efficient photocatalysts, the substrates oxidation could be performed by photo-generated charges [6,7]. The photo-generated electrons and holes in the presence of molecular oxygen (O2) produce reactive oxygen species e.g. superoxide anion radicals (O2 −) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) which enhance several redox reactions such as oxidation of alcohols [8–10]. Recently, several attempts have been devoted to develop transition metal oxide catalysts e.g. WO3 [11], TiO2 [12], NiO [13], Co3O4 [14], and Cu2O [15] for alcohol oxidation due to their low cost, easy availability, and good electrocatalytic activity. Among them, Co3O4 has attracted great research effort in electrochemical [16,17] and photochemical [18,19] processes. It has been shown that in both processes the efficiency of Co3O4 is related with the existence of Co3+ species and oxygen vacancies on its surface. However, the photocatalytic utilization of Co3O4 is limited because of its inappropriate position of conduction band edge for one-electron reduction of O2. This restriction results in the lower photocatalytic activity due to rapid electron–hole recombination. Various attempts have been done for improving the photocatalytic activity such as coupling with another semiconductor to prepare nanocomposite or apply electricity [20–22]. There are several reports on the utilization of multicomponent Co3O4-containing catalysts such as Co3O4–C3N4 [23], Co3O4-QDs/graphene [24], Co3O4/NiCo2O4 [25], BiVO4–Ni/Co3O4 [19], Co3O4/doped carbon nanotube [26], Ni2P/CdZnS/Co3O4 [27], and porous Co3O4/CoS2 [28]. Phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40) (denoted as PMA), is one of the polyoxometalates (POMs) exhibiting reversible multi-electron redox properties and electronic versatility [29–31]. Furthermore, PMA is a good candidate for nanocomposite structure creation for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) applications. The connection of POM and Co3O4-QDs by amino acid bridge would presumably create an oriented electron transportation pathway under the motivation of electrical field. Therefore, it could be expected that modification of Co3O4 with POMs would be resulted in enhanced photoelectro- or photocatalytic activities [32]. Here, we designed two new nanocomposites based on Co3O4-QDs and PMo12O40 3- species with glycine (gly) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) as linkers for selective benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidation upon photo- and photoelectrocatalytic conditions. Based on the expectation, the prepared nanocomposites could promote the photoelectrocatalytic selective oxidation of BA to BAD, the kinetic of the BA oxidation is also examined through the reactions."
1,Experimental,"Details of the used materials and equipments, synthesis procedures and the preparation of working electrode were included in the supporting information."
2,Preparation of (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA,"2.1 Preparation of (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA 1 mmol of H3PMo12O40 and 3 mmol of amino acid i.e. glycine or 4-aminobenzoic acid were separately dissolved in deionized water. Then, the amino acid solution was mixed with H3PMo12O40 followed by stirring for 8 h. Upon solvent evaporation, the (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA were obtained which rinsed with cold deionized water and dried in room temperature."
3,Preparation of nanocomposites,2.2 Preparation of nanocomposites A solution of 0.1 g of (gly)3PMA or (ABA)3PMA in 5 ml of ethanol was added to a suspension of 3 mmol of Co3O4-QDs in 2 mL of ethanol. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 12 h and the solvent was evaporated at ambient temperature to achieve the desired Co/(gly)3PMA and Co/(ABA)3PMA nanocomposites.
4,Photocatalytic and catalytic BA oxidation,"2.3 Photocatalytic and catalytic BA oxidation 20 mg of Co/(gly)3PMA, Co/(ABA)3PMA nanocomposite, and Co3O4-QDs were dispersed in 10 mL of acetonitrile and 1 mmol of BA was added to the mixture under 10 mL/min air bubbling at room temperature. The mixture was exposed to visible light irradiation (9 W, Nama Noor Co., Iran) for a given period of time. In catalytic BA oxidation, the light was eliminated. The products were detected and measured with gas chromatography (GC). The catalytic BA oxidation were performed in the same condition as photocatalytic tests in dark condition."
5,Photoelectrocatalytic BA oxidation,"2.4 Photoelectrocatalytic BA oxidation Photoelectrocatalytic BA oxidation was conducted in a three electrode system at room temperature. The photoreactor utilized for the benzyl alcohol oxidation was comprised from a 50 mL Pyrex vessel with a magnetic stirrer, a potentiostat (CV 320-xh, Hirad, Iran), a visible light lamp described above on top of the photoreactor, a working electrode constituted from the 20 mg of Co/(gly)3PMA, Co/(ABA)3PMA, or Co3O4-QDs electrodeposited on the charcoal, counter electrode (Pt wire), and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (+0.24 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) as reference electrode. The catalyst loaded on charcoal was exposed in 10 mL acetonitrile as solvent, 1 ml of HCl (1 M) as electrolyte, and 1 mmol of BA under 10 mL/min air bubbling. Afterward, the mixture was exposed to the visible light irradiation for a specified time. The products were detected and measured with GC analysis."
6,Results and discussion,"The (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA were prepared with simple addition of gly and ABA species to an aqueous solution of H3PMo12O40 with molar ratio of 3:1. The desired nanocomposites were obtained by addition of the (gly)3PMA or (ABA)3PMA solutions to a dispersion of Co3O4-QDs. The protonated gly and ABA acting as charge-compensating species are connected to the PMA clusters by electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the Co3O4-QDs are attached to (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA surface by –COOH groups as shown in Scheme 1 . The microstructure of Co3O4-QDs and prepared nanocomposites were explored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1 a reveals that the Co3O4-QDs are well-dispersed with a uniform size of 3–5 nm. Fig. 1b and c show the presence of Co3O4-QDs (blue arrows) and polyoxometalate clusters (red arrows) located around the Co3O4-QDs. The FT-IR spectra of the Co3O4-QDs, PMA, (gly)3PMA, Co/(gly)3PMA, (ABA)3PMA, and Co/(ABA)3PMA were shown in Fig. 2 . The Co3O4-QDs, Co/(gly)3PMA, and Co/(ABA)3PMA reveal two distinct peaks at 567 and 663 cm−1 due to the stretching vibrations of cobalt-oxygen bonds [32]. In the FT-IR spectra of PMA containing samples, four distinctive peaks of Keggin type PMA at about 1064 cm−1 (νas P–O), 961 cm−1 (νas Mo=Ot), 867 cm−1 (νas Mo-Ob-Mo), and 784 cm−1 (νas Mo-Oc-Mo) are in good accordance with previous reports [33]. The peaks in the region of 1500–1700 cm−1 belong to the carboxylic acid groups of amino acid (gly and ABA) species [34,35]. In the case of Co/(gly)3PMA and Co/(ABA)3PMA, after connection of –COO groups of amino acids to Co3O4-QDs, the peak intensity of carboxyl group decreased in the region of 1600–1700 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA (Fig. S1, supporting information) revealed that after counter ion exchange in PMA and electrostatic interaction with gly and ABA, the crystalline structure of PMA is changed slightly [36]. On the other hand, Fig. 3 a and b show that after connection of the (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA to Co3O4-QDs, the reflections of PMA are not visible due to the well-dispersion on the surface of Co3O4-QDs. All of the broad peaks in Co3O4-QDs, Co/(gly)3PMA, and Co/(ABA)3PMA correspond with crystal planes of Co3O4-QDs with the spinel structure (JCPDS No. 43–1003). The chemical composition of prepared nanocomposites were studied with utilization of energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and mapping which illustrated the existence of (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA species on the surface of Co3O4-QDs as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . The mapping images of samples confirm the well-dispersion of (gly)3PMA and (ABA)3PMA on the nanocomposites surface. In order to study the optical properties of the samples, DR-UV-vis spectroscopy was exploited. Fig. 8 reveals that all samples show good absorptions in visible region. The association of Co3O4-QDs with (ABA)3PMA and (gly)3PMA significantly enhances the absorption in the visible light region. Compared to the pristine PMA, the band edge positions of Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA reveal a significant red shift compared with (ABA)3PMA and (gly)3PMA. Such observations could suggest the high photocatalytic activities of prepared nanocomposites under visible light irradiation. The band gaps of the prepared samples could be determined from the Tauc equation: ( α h υ ) n = A ( h υ - E g ) where α, h, ν, A, Eg are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, absorption, and band gap energy, respectively. n is a constant depending on the type of semiconductors (for the indirect transition semiconductor n is 1/2). The estimated band gap values of the PMA, Co/(gly)3PMA, Co/(ABA)3PMA, and Co3O4-QDs are about 2.5, 1.0, 1.0, and 1.6 eV, respectively (Fig. 8). The Tauc plots reveal more absorption of visible region upon the combination of Co3O4-QDs with Co/(gly)3PMA and Co/(ABA)3PMA which enhances the photocatalytic performance."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"3.1 Electrochemical measurements The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of PMA and Co3O4-QDs deposited on the glassy carbon electrode (scan rate 50 mV/s in 0.2 M Na2SO4) were displayed in Fig. 9 a and b, respectively. Cyclic voltammogram of PMA containing electrode revealed three reversible redox peaks, each correlated with a two electron process (Fig. 9a) [40]. On the other hand, there are two pairs of redox peaks in the CV curve of Co3O4-QDs (Fig. 9b), ascribing to the conversion between cobalt oxidation states [41]. The observed first redox pair (0.15 VOX/0.05 VRED) could be attributed to the conversion between Co3O4 and CoOOH species. The second redox pair (0.48 VOX/0.28 VRED) is related to the conversion between CoOOH and CoO2 species. Both of the redox pairs exhibit quasi-reversible processes [42]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Nyquist plots) was conducted for exploring the transfer and separation of photo-excited carriers (Fig. 9c). The fitted Rct (charge transfer resistance) values were 1.5*104, 1.1*104, and 1.0*104 Ω for Co3O4-QDs, Co/(gly)3PMA, and Co/(ABA)3PMA, respectively. Surprisingly, the Co/(gly)3PMA and Co/(ABA)3PMA showed smaller arc radius compared to the Co3O4-QDs. This denoted a decrease in the resistance of interface layer and better charge transfer on the surface. Moreover, the Co/(gly)3PMA exhibited a larger Rct than Co/(ABA)3PMA which would be in accordance with their photocatalytic activity. In order to explore the band structure and recombination behavior of the samples, the Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted under dark conditions with three-electrode systems utilizing Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt as the counter electrode immersed in 0.2 M Na2SO4 at pH 6.5 in 500 Hz. The Mott-Schottky plots of PMA and Co3O4-QDs were illustrated in Fig. 10 a and b, respectively. The observed positive slope for PMA indicates that it is an n-type semiconductor while the negative slope for Co3O4-QDs refers to p-type semiconductor. Moreover, from the intercept of Mott-Schottky plots, the flat band potentials (Efb) for PMA and Co3O4-QDs are evaluated to be 0.73 and 2.18 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. It has been known that a higher Efb value for a p-type semiconductor indicates a higher degree of band bending and a larger space-charge-region potential. Thus, the high Efb value of the Co3O4-QDs furnishes a large driving force for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs which results in a high photocatalytic activity in BA oxidation. The Efb is roughly matches to the conduction band potential of n-type and valence band potential of p-type semiconductors. Thus, the positions of the CB for PMA and VB for Co3O4-QDs are 0.73 and 2.18 V, respectively. Such band structure has considerable contribution in the photocatalytic activities which are discussed in the next section [22]."
8,Oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.2 Oxidation of benzyl alcohol The catalytic, photocatalytic (upon visible light irradiation), and photoelectrocatalytic (upon visible light irradiation and potential of 0.9 V) efficiencies of Co3O4-QDs, Co/(gly)3PMA, and Co/(ABA)3PMA were explored in the BA oxidation to benzaldehyde (BAD) using air as the oxidant. The BAD yield increased in the presence of Co3O4-QDs, Co/(gly)3PMA, and Co/(ABA)3PMA as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 11 . Comparing the results of photocatalytic BA oxidation with catalytic process in the presence of Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA showed that the BA oxidation could be enhanced in the photocatalytic conditions. Photocatalytic activities of the nanocomposites is due to the visible light absorption and subsequent photo-induced charge transfer in these materials. In order to promote more BA oxidation and investigating the effect of electrical energy on photocatalytic process, photoelectrochemical conditions were also utilized for BA oxidation in the presence of Co/(gly)3PMA and Co/(ABA)3PMA. For this purpose, photo-anode electrodes were designed by electrophoretic deposition of Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA on charcoal and significant improvement for the BA oxidation to BAD was achieved in photoelectrocatalytic approach. As shown in Fig. 11a, the yield of BAD increases in the presence of light and electrical energy. In comparison with photocatalytic approach, the photoelectrocatalytic BA oxidation to BAD was more efficient in the presence of Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA. Such observation could be attributed to the high charge separation in the presence of electrical energy which indicates its importance for improving the photocatalytic activity. Referring to scavenger tests in Fig. 11b, when benzoquinone (BQ) was utilized as a scavenger for photogenerated •O2 −, the yield of BAD decreased sharply, indicating the key function of photogenerated •O2 − in the selective oxidation of BA. On the other hand, when EDTA as hole scavenger was added to the reaction mixture, the yield of BAD was reduced significantly. In contrast, the yield of BAD was not affected remarkably by the addition of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as •OH scavenger. These observations clearly shows the involvement of photogenerated electrons and hole in the production of BAD."
9,Kinetics and mechanism of BA oxidation,"3.3 Kinetics and mechanism of BA oxidation The results of kinetic study of BA oxidation in the presence of prepared catalysts were shown in Fig. 12 a and b, which revealed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model according to below equation [43]: kt = ln ( a ( a − x ) ) The equation exhibits that while plotting ln [a/(a -x)] against t, a first-order reaction gives a straight line with slope k in the plots. Here, the amount of BA and the produced BAD as a function of time (t) are described as a and x, respectively. The reaction rate constants were approximately evaluated to be 0.16, 0.13, 0.045, 0.052, and 0.036 h−1 for Co/(ABA)3PMA (photoelectrocatalytic), Co/(gly)3PMA (photoelectrocatalytic), Co/(ABA)3PMA (photocatalytic), Co/(gly)3PMA (photocatalytic), and Co3O4 (photocatalytic), respectively (Fig. 12b) illustrating the successful photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of BA by Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA. To better understand the photoelectrocatalytic mechanism and charge separation, the positions of CB and VB of semiconductors were estimated. The attachment of amino acids to Co3O4-QDs and PMA produces the heterojunction leading to inhibition of electron-hole recombination and improving life-time of photo-generated electrons and holes. The below equations could be utilized for determining the CB edge (ECB) and VB edge (EVB) potentials of Co3O4-QDs and PMA: (5) E CB = χ - E e - 0.5 E g (6) E VB = E CB + E g (7) χ = ( χ A a χ B b ) 1 / ( a + b ) where EVB and ECB are the VB and CB energies, respectively, and Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV). χ is the absolute Mulliken electronegativity of the semiconductor, obtained as the geometric mean of the electronegativities of the constituent atoms. A and B are the atoms present in the semiconductor, whereas a and b are the number of those atoms. Eg and χ for Co3O4-QDs were determined to be 1.6 and 5.93 eV [22], and for PMA were 2.5 and 6.47 eV, respectively. Thus, ECB and EVB of Co3O4-QDs were estimated to be 0.6 and 2.2 eV and that of PMA were determined to be 0.73 and 3.2 eV, respectively [44], which are in excellent agreement with Mott-Schottky results in Fig. 10a and b. Regarding the above results, a probable mechanism was proposed for charge separation in the Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA on charcoal upon visible light illumination. According to Scheme 2 , upon light illumination, the photo-generated active species promote the oxidation of BA with oxidation potential of 0.9 V. It could be assumed that photo-generated electron-holes are separated in the Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA deposited on charcoal with applying a proper bias potential on the modified electrode. Upon illumination, the photo-generated electrons in CB of Co3O4-QDs can move to CB of PMA and then imposed quickly to move toward the counter electrode through the external circuit. The transported photo-generated electrons from the Pt counter electrode are captured by O2, producing •O2 − species. Moreover, the remained holes in the VB of PMA could be transferred to the VB of Co3O4-QDs and oxidize the BA directly. In comparison with other modified photo-anodes for BA selective oxidation in Table 2 , our prepared samples i.e. Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA on charcoal show high conversion in short time and low applied potential under visible light irradiation."
10,Conclusion,"Two efficient nanocomposites based on the conjugation of PMA and Co3O4-QDs through gly and ABA linkers were designed for the oxidation of BA under catalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic conditions. The nanocomposite structure showed high efficiency in the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of BA with molecular oxygen. Via calculation of energy levels in nanocomposites, the mechanism of the BA oxidation was proposed. Light absorption efficiency was enhanced by the presence of Co3O4-QDs. The well contact between Co3O4-QDs and PMA by amino acids could enable efficient separation of e−-h+ pairs. Comparison of the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic efficiencies showed that the utilization of electricity help to effective charge separation in the prepared catalysts. The present work could provide a valuable contribution for designing new cost-effective and eco-friendly photoelectrocatalysts. We found that the high BAD production is not only favored by the ˙OH and ˙O2 − radicals with appropriate oxidizing capability, but also by the oxidation of adsorbed BA molecules on the photo-anodes."
