0,Introduction,"Biowaste, a renewable natural energy source, can be obtained from a wide variety of feedstocks, mainly municipal solid waste (MSW), wastes from food/fruit processing, paper production, sewage treatment plants, and agricultural production, and forestry residue [1,2]. Biowaste is one of the most produced wastes worldwide, and its rate of generation is steadily increasing. Based on a study issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), nearly 1.3 billion tons of food gets discarded annually worldwide [3]. At least 50 million tons of sewage sludge is produced in the European Union every year [4]. In China, sewage sludge generated in 2020 exceeded 60 million tons [5]. Moreover, researchers estimate that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, which will further expand the scale of the food supply, thus leading to a continuous increase in agricultural waste production [6]. As a renewable energy source, biowaste is promising to be converted into hydrogen and other clean energy. Hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel without greenhouse gas emissions that is presently regarded as the one of the most promising energy carriers for alleviating fossil fuel shortages and issues related to global warming [7–9]. However, approximately 96% of commercial hydrogen currently generated from the cracking or reforming of fossil fuels [10]. In contrast, generating hydrogen from biowaste is a clean, energy-saving, efficient, and environmentally friendly way of hydrogen production [11–13]. Therefore, the huge amount of available biowaste and its energy conversion potential, as well as the negative influence of conventional hydrogen production methods on the ecological environment are driving research in renewable hydrogen production from biowaste. Currently, biowaste is converted into hydrogen mainly by biochemical (e.g., fermentation, bio-photolysis) and thermochemical processes (e.g., supercritical water gasification (SCWG), fast pyrolysis, and steam gasification) [14,15]. Compared with the conventional biochemical processes, thermochemical conversion processes have a shorter reaction time with higher H2 yield and energy conversion efficiency, and can be applied to a wider range of biowaste sources [16,17]. However, the moisture content of most biowaste is typically over 50% [18], especially in high-moisture biowaste including food waste (75–85%) [19], sewage sludge (80–90 wt%) [20], and black liquor (>80 wt%) [21]. This high moisture content causes technical difficulties in traditional pyrolysis and gasification, and thus additional pre-drying costs are involved. In contrast, SCWG can be used to directly convert wet biowaste into hydrogen without the energy-intensive pre-drying processes [22,23]. In addition, tar and coke formation is inhibited under supercritical conditions, leading to high gas yields using SCWG [24]. Hence, in recent years, hydrogen production from the SCWG of biowaste has attracted considerable attention. The operating parameters that affect the SCWG of biowaste mainly include reaction temperature, reaction time, feedstock-water ratio, and operating pressure [22]. In the past few decades, the influences of various operating parameters on the non-catalytic SCWG of biowaste have been extensively studied. Lu et al. [25] studied the influences of the primary operating parameters on the SCWG process of biomass using an orthogonal experimental design method. The experimental results demonstrated that the reaction temperature has the strongest influence and that a higher reaction temperature can remarkably enhance the carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) and H2 yield. The degree of influence of the various operating parameters on the H2 yield was found to follow the order: reaction temperature > reaction pressure > feedstock-water ratio > reaction time. Chen et al. [26] explored the effects of operating conditions, including the reaction temperature (350–450 °C) and reaction time (5–25 min), on the SCWG of sewage sludge with and without catalysts. The results showed that the effect of increasing the reaction temperature on the molar fraction and low heating value (LHV) of the gaseous products was greater than that of prolonging the residence time. However, a high reaction temperature increases the equipment and operating costs [27]. Hence, to reduce the cost at mild reaction temperatures, high-performance catalysts have been developed to enhance the hydrogen production yield by permitting the SCWG of biowaste at mild reaction temperatures [28,29]. The presence of catalysts also reduces tar and char formation in SCWG. Fig. 1 shows the classification of catalysts widely used in the SCWG of biowaste. The catalysts used for the SCWG of biowaste can be classified as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Among the homogeneous catalysts, the influence of alkaline catalysts (KOH, NaOH, NaHCO3, K2CO3, Na2CO3, etc.) on SCWG has been extensively studied. Chen et al. [30] evaluated the catalytic activity of KOH on the SCWG of coking wastewater at 540 °C and 25 MPa. When KOH was added into the gasification, a higher total gas yield (20 mol/kg) was obtained than that of non-catalytic SCWG (15 mol/kg). The K+ salts (K2CO3 and KHCO3) produced from the reaction of KOH with CO2 generated in the gasification process were proved to be beneficial in catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction (R3) and enhancing hydrogen production in SCWG. Yan et al. [20] employed KOH, NaOH, Na2CO3, and K2CO3 catalysts for the catalytic SCWG of sewage sludge at 400 °C and 25 MPa. Formate salt (HCOOM) was presumed to be an intermediate product of carbonate catalysts (Na2CO3 and K2CO3) and can react with water to generate salt bicarbonate (MHCO3) and H2 [31]. The results also indicated that the catalytic activity order for the hydrogen production is as follows: KOH > NaOH > Na2CO3 ≈ K2CO3. Although homogeneous catalysts have been confirmed by many scholars to play a remarkable catalytic role in the SCWG, the use of alkaline catalysts causes corrosion and blockage in the equipment [32]. In addition, the recovery of homogeneous catalysts at the end of the SCWG process is challenging and costly, which limits future industrial applications [33]. Compared with homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts are more suited to large-scale applications in SCWG due to their non-corrosiveness, high catalytic activity, thermal stability, and excellent recyclability from liquid products [34]. Heterogeneous catalysts recently applied in the SCWG process of biowastes can be grouped into two main categories: transition metal catalysts (including their oxides), and activated carbon (AC) [35]. Xu et al. [36] initially found that the AC catalyst promotes the water-gas shift (R2) and CO/CO2 methanation reaction (R4, R5) and thus improves the CGE during the SCWG process of glucose. Due to its superior physical-chemical characteristics such as high surface area, AC is widely applied as the support material for metal-based catalysts [35]. Youssef et al. [37] employed various transition metal-based catalysts supported by AC in the SCWG of hog manure. It was found that the catalytic activity for hydrogen production, the catalysts followed the order of Pd/AC > Ru/Al2O3 > Ru/AC > AC > NaOH. Moreover, transition metal oxides have also been used separately as active components in SCWG. Cao et al. [38] tested 12 metal oxides catalysts (Fe2O3, ZnO, ZrO2, CuO, Cr2O3, MoO3, SnO2, V2O5, MnO2,WO3, Co2O3, and CeO2) as independent active components in SCWG of glucose, they found that the most of tested metals oxides have positive effect for improving the gasification efficiency, nevertheless, there is little literature in this field. Noble transition metal-based catalysts such as Rh, Pt, Ru, and Pd, and non-noble transition metals such as Ni, Co, Cu, and Fe and have been more extensively explored than AC and metal oxides as active components for catalyzing SCWG due to their higher activity and selectivity [26,39–42]. Transition metal-based catalysts have become an important category of heterogeneous catalysts, and research on the development and application of highly selective and active catalysts for SCWG has been pursued [43]. However, transition metal-based catalysts can be deactivated by the sintering of metal particles, carbon deposition, and transition-metal leaching, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity [43–47]. Recently, a lot of researchers have actively explored the development of transition metal-based catalysts according to the selection of active components, preparation methods, support materials, and promoter additions to achieve enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and thermal stability. This work broadly reviews multiple aspects of the catalytic SCWG of biowaste over transition metal-based catalysts, to provide a reference in the design of transition metal-based catalysts and their application in the SCWG of biowaste. The complexity of biowaste components is one of the significant factors affecting the reaction mechanism and behavior of the SCWG process. Therefore, the biowaste components and correlated reaction mechanism are reviewed in Section 2. To obtain deeper insight into the catalytic effects of transition metal-based catalysts for the SCWG of biowaste, based on the differences in transition metals, the influences of various active components are reviewed in Section 3. The influences of different synthetic strategies and support materials are also included in this section. Section 4 reviews the effects and performances of various modification methods to promote and optimize the catalytic properties of transition metal-based catalysts in the SCWG of biowaste. Finally, Section 5 includes the technical challenges of transition metal-based catalysts, as well as recommendations, future perspectives, and conclusions."
1,Complexity of biowaste and its reaction mechanism in SCWG,
2,Feedstock composition,"2.1 Feedstock composition Biowaste, mainly consisting of cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, starch, protein, and lipids which can be decomposed under thermochemical conditions, is considered to be a valuable renewable resource for hydrogen production [1,48–50]. The conversion efficiency of biowaste, including carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen production, is influenced by the type of biowaste feedstock. Table 1 lists the chemical composition, ultimate analysis, and proximate analysis of various biowaste types. The chemical characteristics vary greatly among the exhibited biowaste: the variations in process pathways and mechanisms are influenced largely by the chemical composition. Wang et al. [51] conducted the comparison of gasification performance of wheat straw and cornstalk in supercritical water. They found that the CGE of cornstalk (61%) was much higher than wheat straw (26%) at 500 °C, which can be explained by that the higher volatiles in cornstalk. The increase of CGE mainly contributed to volatiles at relatively low SCWG temperature. Likewise, the elementary composition of biowastes also has remarkable effect on the SCWG process [52]. Yang et al. [53] evaluated the effects of feedstock composition (H/C and O/C) on the main gaseous products from SCWG of biowastes SCWG, as shown in Fig. 2 , proving that the those feedstocks with high H/C ratio and a low O/C ratio were beneficial for H2 production. Azadi et al. [54] carried a thermodynamic research on the SCWG process of cellulose and lignin at 380 °C. The results indicated that the H2 yield from the gasification of cellulose (5.8 mol/kg feedstock) was higher than that from lignin (4.8 mol/kg feedstock), which demonstrates that lignin is more difficult to decompose completely than cellulose in supercritical water. Therefore, to improve the gasification process and inhibit the formation of undesired tar/char, effective catalysts may be applied in the SCWG of biowaste with high lignin content. In addition, biowaste with a high ash content may cause a series of problems including reactor blockage and catalyst sintering of catalysts [55]. Compared with plant-based biowaste, animal manure and sewage sludge have a higher ash content [56], which suggests that the proper design of the reactor and its ancillary equipment is essential when using animal manure and sewage sludge as feedstock for thermal-chemical conversion. Moreover, a high ash content in feedstocks may decrease the gasification efficiency and syngas production [57]."
3,Reaction mechanism of SCWG,"2.2 Reaction mechanism of SCWG Supercritical water, defined as water whose temperature and pressure exceed 374 °C and 22.1 MPa, respectively, has unique physical-chemical properties based on its dielectric constant, density, water-producing ions product, dynamic viscosity, diffusion coefficient, conductivity, and solvent ability [73–75]. Supercritical water has a much lower density than ordinary water and subcritical water, which implies that the hydrogen bonds in the water become fewer and less stable due to the increasing thermal movement of the water molecules at higher temperatures [76]. Consequently, this phenomenon also leads to a decrease in the dielectric constant and dynamic viscosity [16]. When the water temperature increases from 25 °C to 500 °C, the dielectric constant decreases significantly from 78.50 to 1.46, which causes supercritical water to perform similarly to non-polar organic compounds [33]. Therefore, water can be used as an excellent solvent to dissolve most non-polar organic compounds, while forming a homogeneous fluid phase and participating in thermochemical reactions [77,78]. Additionally, the dynamic viscosity of supercritical water is close to that of superheated steam, providing a high reactivity coefficient for water and improving the reaction rate. During the SCWG process, the supercritical water plays a dual role as an efficient solvent and reactant [79]. Table 2 summarizes the main chemical reactions involved in SCWG. The long-chain molecules in biowaste, such as hemicellulose, lignin, protein lipid, and, cellulose, can be hydrolyzed by supercritical water into intermediate products and are further converted into H2-rich syngas that mainly contains H2, CO, CH4, and CO2 [23,80]. Fig. 3 illustrates a potential reaction pathway for biowaste conversion into H2-rich syngas in supercritical water. Under supercritical conditions, the cellulose can be rapidly hydrolyzed into main sugar units including glucose and fructose [81]. The glucose is then isomerized into fructose, which is further decomposed to form 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and short-chain aldehydes, which are important intermediate products related to gas production [82]. Castello et al. [83] reported that the dehydration of 5-HMF may lead to the formation of higher molecular-weight products (tar/coke). In addition, phenol is also a potential product of glucose decomposition and can be converted into gas in supercritical water. Gökkaya et al. [84] employed phenol as a model compound of phenolic structures in SCWG and obtained CH4-rich syngas containing H2, CO2, and CO. Along with glucose, xylose is also the main product of hemicellulose hydrolysis [23]. During SCWG, xylose is decomposed to acetic and propanoic acids, which are further reformed by water into CO and H2 [85,86]. The formed CO is converted into additional H2 and CO2 via the water-gas shift reaction (R3). Su et al. [87] proposed that the potential pathway is the lignin conversion into syringols, guaiacols, and catechols, followed by their hydrolysis and dealkylation to intermediate products such as phenol, acids, and alcohols. As the building blocks and hydrolysis product of protein, amino acids are decomposed to acid and amine through deamination and decarboxylation, respectively. During the SCWG of lignin and protein, gaseous products are mainly generated from the decomposition of phenol, acids, alcohols, and aldehydes. One of the main components in biowaste, especially in food waste, is the class of lipids, which are non-polar compounds characterized primarily by the aliphatic group, which are generally found as triesters of fatty acids and glycerol, called triacylglycerides. Guo et al. [88] analyzed the liquid products from the SCWG of glycerol and reported that the intermediates of glycerol hydrolysis mainly include aldehydes, acids, ketones, and alcohols. The experimental results indicated that no obvious tar or char was observed after the SCWG of glycerol. Nanda et al. [89] conducted an SCWG of waste cooking oil at 375–675 °C and 23–25 MPa for H2-rich syngas production, and they reported that waste cooking oil is first hydrolyzed into long-chain fatty acids that can produce short-chain fatty acids and saturated fatty acids through thermal cracking and hydrogenation reactions, respectively. The short-chain fatty acids are further converted into hydrogen-rich syngas through reforming, cracking, and methanation. Furthermore, as intermediate products of short-chain and saturated fatty acid reactions, aliphatic hydrocarbons can also produce methane through thermal cracking reactions."
4,Catalytic effects of transition metal-based catalysts on the SCWG of biowaste,"As shown in Fig. 4 , normally, the transition metal-based catalysts favors promoting the decomposition of the chemical intermediates of biowaste hydrolysis through catalyzing the C-C bond cleavage, which improves syngas production [91,92]. The water-gas shift reaction (R3) is further catalyzed by transition metal-based catalysts to improve the hydrogen yield. However, catalysts with high catalytic activity for the cleavage of C-O bonds may promote the production of methane and other alkanes. The addition of an appropriate promoter is an effective method to suppress the catalytic activity of the transition metal-based catalyst for the cleavage of C-O bonds. The catalytic performance of transition metal-based catalysts in SCWG is thus affected by many factors, such as the active components, synthesized strategies, support materials, promoter, and combination structure of the active metal."
5,Influences of active components,"3.1 Influences of active components In recent years, many transition metals have been used as active components to synthesize transition metal-based catalysts to promote the SCWG process. Based on previous studies, it can be demonstrated that there are certain differences in the performance of various active components in SCWG. Han et al. [93] confirmed that the distortion and C-C bond cleavage of naphthalene (A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon present in wastewater) was promoted on the surface of iron oxide catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 , iron oxide can catalyze the SCW adsorbed on the catalyst surface to produce active OH radicals, and the subsequent dehydrogenation of OH, assisted by the iron oxide catalyst, provides H atoms for further generating H2. Kıpçak et al. [94] studied the c SCWG of olive mill wastewater catalyzed by the Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts in the operating temperature range of 400–600 °C under a pressure of 25 MPa. It can be known from the experimental that the Ni/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts had a positive effect on enhancing the gas yield compared with the non-catalytic case. The highest H2 yield was obtained at 450 °C with the addition of Ni/Al2O3. Ru metal is selective for the methanation reaction, which is beneficial to improving methane production. Karakuş et al. [95] applied Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 to the catalytic SCWG of 2-propanol in the reaction temperature range of 400–550 °C. The authors mentioned that Pt/Al2O3 exhibited a higher selectivity for hydrogen production in comparison with Ru/Al2O3 during SCWG process. The results suggested that low temperatures favor hydrogen production over Pt/Al2O3. The study also reported that the Ru/Al2O3 showed a remarkable catalytic effect toward the methanation reaction (R4, R5), which is attributed to the fact that the Ru metal surface is expected to be active for methanation (R4, R5). Samiee-Zafarghandi et al. [96] employed five different reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-supported transition metal-based catalysts (Cr/rGO, Cu/rGO, Mn/rGO, Co/rGO, and Ni/rGO) during the SCWG of microalgae to evaluate the catalytic effect on hydrogen production and the H2 mole fraction. They found that the order of catalyst activity in term of the H2 yield is as follows: Ni/rGO > Co/rGO > Cr/rGO > Cu/rGO >Mn/rGO. The results indicated that Ni/rGO showed the best performance for promoting the water-gas shift reaction (R3) among other graphene-supported catalysts. It was noted that the minimum CGE was obtained over Mn/rGO, which proved the negligible activity of the Mn-based catalyst in C-C bond cleavage. Yamaguchi et al. [97] applied supported transition catalysts including Ru/C, Rh/C, Pt/C, Pd/C, and Ni/C in the SCWG of lignin to study the effect of various active components on hydrogen production at 400 °C and 450 °C. Although the Ru/C catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity for promoting the gas yield at the two reaction temperatures, its hydrogen selectivity was the lowest. Among all the catalysts, Pd/C exhibited the highest selectivity for hydrogen production, and the maximum H2 composition was obtained. The sequence based on the catalytic activity of active components for gas yield (Ru > Rh > Pt > Pd > Ni) and H2 yield (Pd > Ru > Pt > Rh > Ni) were established. Likewise, in another study, Sato et al. [98] evaluated the catalytic activity of Ni/C, Ru/C, Pd/C, Pt/C, and Rh/C on the SCWG of bean curd refuse. The experimental results of this study in terms of the order of the activity of the five catalysts were consistent with those obtained by Yamaguchi et al. [97]."
6,Influence of support materials,"3.2 Influence of support materials The support material plays a prominent role in determining the activity and service life of the catalysts [99]. The support materials can optimize the catalytic properties of the transition metal-based catalysts by providing mechanical strength/integrity and new phases that form through reactions with the active metals [100]. Therefore, the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity of transition metal-based catalysts can be affected by some support materials during the SCWG process [77]. This has prompted several researchers to study the effects of support materials on the catalytic performance of transition metal-based catalysts for the SCWG of biowaste. Based on previous studies, the effective support materials for SCWG transition metal-based catalysts can be mainly classified into several types, including metal oxides and carbon-based materials. Table 3 summarizes the studies on transition-metal-based catalysts with various support materials. 3.2.1 Metal oxide-supported catalysts Because metal oxide support materials can provide a large specific surface area for the excellent dispersion of transition metal species and can inhibit sintering and crystal growth, a wide range of metal oxide support materials such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, Y2O3, La2O3, ZnO, TiO2, and MgO have recently been used to synthesize supported transition metal-based catalysts for SCWG [110,111]. Lu et al. [103] synthesized Ni-based catalysts using four metal oxide-supported materials including Al2O3, ZnO2, ZrO2, and MgO via the impregnation method. All the catalysts were applied in the SCWG of wheat stalk under the operating parameters of 450 °C and 23–28 MPa to evaluate their catalytic performance in the SCWG process. During SCWG, the intermediate products generated in the active metal position via a series of thermochemical reactions shifted to the support position and continued to react. Ni/MgO and Ni/ZnO showed more significant catalytic effects on hydrogen production than the other catalysts, which is due to the basicity of MgO and ZnO, the acidity of Al2O3, and the neutrality of ZrO2. This can be explained by the fact that the basic oxide favors the water-gas shift reaction (R3), in contrast, the acidic oxide inhibits the water-gas shift reaction (R3). Therefore, an order for the Ni-based catalyst activity for hydrogen production (Ni/MgO > Ni/ZnO > Ni/Al2O3 > Ni/ZrO2) was obtained. Zhang et al. [43] employed γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, and AC as support materials to synthesize three different Ni catalysts using the incipient wetness impregnation method. The order of three support materials for promoting hydrogen production is as follows: Al2O3 > ZrO2 > AC, which is possibly due to the various degrees of Ni dispersion on the three support materials. It was noted that the support material with good dispersion property of metal particles reduced the chance of metal sintering in the reaction process, thus making the supported catalyst have higher catalytic activity and long-term stability. Although γ-Al2O3 is one of the most widely applied industrial catalyst supports, the γ-Al2O3 transformation to boehmite under the action of SCW results in a remarkable loss of mesopore and surface area, which leads to occlusion of the catalytic active components and rapid deactivation of the catalyst [112]. Moreover, Li et al. [113] used ZrO2, TiO2, and Ta2O5 as support materials to synthesize a series of Ni-based catalysts via the sol-gel method and evaluated the their long-term catalytic stability and physicochemical properties with a continuous SCWG process of 3 wt% glycerol. During the long-term continuous SCWG reaction (>80 h), the TiO2-supported catalyst exhibited the lowest stability compared with ZrO2- and Ta2O5-supported catalysts, because of the sintering of the active metal with the TiO2. In addition, the CGE from Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Ta2O5 remained at ∼97% and ∼90%, respectively, which demonstrated that the “catalyst in-situ activation” influence of the sol-gel Ni-Zr and Ni-Ta catalysts was realized in the crystallizing environment of supercritical water flow. As a rare earth metal oxide, CeO2 has been extensively used as a support for transition metal-based catalysts because of its strong oxygen mobility and high oxygen storage capacity [114]. Guan et al. [106] prepared a Ru-based catalyst using CeO2 as the support material and applied it to catalyze the SCWG of phenol. The results indicated that the Ru/CeO2 catalyst showed significant catalytic activity for accelerating reactions between phenol and water, especially the steam reforming reactions (R1, R2), which is the one of primary reactions for hydrogen production. Moreover, Li et al. [102] studied the SCWG of phenol catalyzed by a Ni/CeO2 catalyst. XPS analysis of Ni/CeO2 indicated that the CeNi2 alloy was formed in the Ni/CeO2. In addition, the kinetic model further demonstrated that the CeNi2 alloy plays an important role in improving the catalyst activity of Ni/CeO2 in the SCWG of phenol. To explore the influences of rare earth metal supports on transition metal-based catalysts, Liu et al. [115] selected four rare earth metal oxides (CeO2, La2O3, Pr4O7, and Y2O3) as support materials to synthesize Ru catalysts. Other types of catalysts including Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/MgO were also synthesized for comparison. The results indicated that the rare earth metal oxide-supported Ru catalysts showed the best activity among all the catalysts, and CeO2, La2O3, Pr4O7, and Y2O3 all offer more active surface sites and higher oxygen affinity for Ru metal. The order of catalytic activity for H2 yield was observed to be Ru/Y2O3 > Ru/La2O3 > Ru/Pr4O7 > Ru/CeO2. Compared with other catalysts, Ru/CeO2 showed the best catalytic activity, best selectivity to CH4 and the lowest selectivity to H2, which is attributed to the promotion of steam reforming (R1, R2) and the methanation reaction (R4, R5) by the CeO2 support with a high oxygen storage capacity. 3.2.2 Carbon-based-supported catalysts In recent years, carbon-based materials including AC, graphene, and carbon nanotubes (CNT) have also been widely investigated as supports for transition metal-based SCWG catalysts. Due to its low cost, high specific surface area, and adjustable surface potential for hydrogen, AC is considered as one of the promising support materials for transition metal-based catalysts [116–118]. Its well-developed pore structure provides sufficient space for active metal particles [119]. AC is also widely used as a single effective catalyst in the SCWG of biowaste due to its remarkable catalytic activity for CGE [120–123]. Osada et al. [124] confirmed that the formation of CH4 and CO2 from the SCWG of AC was only 0.1% (based on C%) of the AC loaded, which indicates that when AC is used as a support material, the influence of its own gasification on the whole process can be ignored. Ding et al. [125] studied the influences of Ni/AC on the SCWG of glucose, and Ni/MgO, Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, and NaOH were also applied for comparison. The results indicated that among all the catalysts, NaOH shows the highest activity for improving H2 yield. However, under the same operating conditions, the Ni/AC still contributed to an 81% increase in H2 yield, and the yield further decreased in the order Ni/MgO, Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, and Ni/Al2O3. During the long-term continuous SCWG process, the CNT support exhibits stable characteristics. Li et al. [126] found that the Ni supported by CNT was resistant to sintering and dissolution during SCWG. In addition, the CNT could persistently retain a high specific surface area in the SCW flow. Wang et al. [101] prepared a series of Ni-based catalysts using three support materials including CNT, AC, and Ni/γ-Al2O3, and evaluated their activity and stability in the SCWG of phenol at 480 °C and 25 MPa with an oxygen ratio of 0.2. During the long operation time of 50, they found that Ni/CNT showed higher catalytic activity and stability than Ni/AC and Ni/γ-Al2O3. When the continuous operation lasted over 30 h, the catalytic activity of Ni/AC and Ni/γ-Al2O3 decreased, while the Ni/CNT maintained stable activity during 48 h of operation. Moreover, during the reaction time, the concentration of Ni2+ in the liquid residue remained stable at ∼0.3 mg/L, which demonstrated that the Ni/CNT has an excellent suppression ability for Ni2+ leaching. Graphene, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms, has been extensively applied as a metal-free catalyst as well as a supported transition metal nanoparticle catalyst [127,128]. Fig. 6 illustrates the preparation procedure of graphene oxide-supported metal catalysts. In addition, the two-dimensional structure of graphene can provide a large specific surface area for the uniform dispersion of the active metal phase, which is beneficial to the growth process of nanoparticles [96]. Shirai et al. [129] evaluated that catalytic performance of 5 wt% Ru/graphite catalyst during the SCWG process of ethanol production residue from eucalyptus powder. The results demonstrated that the Ru/graphite catalyst was active for the SCWG. In another study they conducted [130], Ru/graphite and Ru/charcoal catalyst were synthesized by the impregnation method. The CO adsorption and TEM analysis results showed that the dispersion and sizes of the Ru metal particles in the Ru/Graphite and Ru/Charcoal were almost the same. However, the experimental results showed that the gas yield from the SCWG process at 400 °C over Ru/Graphite was six times higher than that over Ru/Charcoal. The results can be explained by the fact that the flat plate-like carbon particles of graphite, with high surface area and few micropores allow the organic molecules to more easily access the active Ru metal located on the graphite. 3.2.3 Other specific material-supported catalysts In addition to the metal oxides and carbon-based support materials, other materials, such as zeolite and hydrotalcite, could also be promising alternatives for the synthesis of supported transition metal-based catalysts. Fakeeha et al. [131] reported that zeolites showed very high metal dispersion and retained stability when it was used as a support for a Ni catalyst. Xie et al. [132] studied the catalytic SCWG of microalgae over Ni catalysts supported by seven types of zeolites (SAPO-11, HY (Na2O = 0.8%, 5%), MCM-41, Hβ-type, and HZSM-5). Compared to other catalysts, Ni/HY showed the highest numbers of total and strong acid sites. The order of the catalytic activity of Ni/zeolites for CGE corresponds to the number of strong acid sites of zeolites. Azadi et al. [133] investigated the selectivity and catalytic activity of Ni catalysts supported by different support materials (MgO, CNT, TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, Y2O3, SiO2, hydrotalcite, zeolite, and molecular sieve) on the SCWG of glucose. The results demonstrated that the acidic supports (e.g., zeolites, silica–alumina) caused very low gasification yields. The order for the activity of catalysts based on the support materials was found to be CNT > MgO > Y2O3, TiO2, SiO2 > hydrotalcite, yttria-stabilized zirconia > CeO2, AC, ZrO2, molecular sieve, silica-alumina, and zeolites. Spent bleaching clay is a type of waste of which approximately 2 million metric tons are produced annually worldwide [134]. In a previous study, spent bleaching clay ash was used by Sun et al. [135] as a catalyst support for subcritical water gasification. They selected three different support materials including SiO2, Al2O3, and spent bleaching clay ash with Ni catalysts for the gasification of cellulose at 350 °C and 18 MPa. The results showed that Ni/Al2O3 had the highest catalytic activity for gasification efficiency, followed by Ni/spent bleaching clay ash and finally by Ni/SiO2. This result was found to be due to the high total acid amount of Ni/Al2O3 [136]. It is worth noting that Al2O3-SiO2 is the main component of spent bleaching clay ash, which was confirmed to be a potential support material for supported transition metal-based catalysts [105]. Therefore, based on the above discussion, the use of a transition metal-based catalyst supported by spent bleaching clay ash can be tried in the catalytic SCWG of biowaste. 3.2.4 Integration of transition metals into biowaste Considering the deactivation, sintering, and phase transformation of supported transition metal-based catalysts synthesized by conventional synthesis strategies, researchers have investigated the avoidance of these stability issues by directly impregnating transition metals into the biowaste feedstock [77]. Kumar et al. [137] mixed a Ni-metal-salt aqueous solution with biomass for the metal impregnation into biomass (bagasse and mosambi peels) to facilitate higher metal loading, and the metal-impregnated biomass was gasified in situ in supercritical water. Fig. 7 shows the schematic diagram of the in situ SCWG of nano-Nickel (Ni2+)-impregnated biomass. Based on the XRD and XPS analyses of the hydrothermal char, it was found that NiO nanoparticles was formed from Ni (OH)2 nanoparticles at 350 °C, following the NiO was further reduced to metallic Ni nanoparticles at 500 °C. The in situ SCWG of Ni2+-impregnated biomass exhibited a higher H2 yield (9.52 mol/kg mosambi peels and 13.82 mol/kg bagasse) than the non-catalytic case (1.35 mol/kg mosambi peels and 1.88 mol/kg bagasse) and the case with Raney Ni (5.67 mol/kg mosambi peels and 9.29 mol/kg bagasse). In another study [138], the in situ SCWG of metal (Ni/Ru/Fe)-impregnated biomass was studied. The results indicated that the reduction of NiO to nano-Ni improved the gas yields of SCWG by providing more active sites. The nano-Ni formed during the SCWG process exhibited excellent catalytic performance for reforming and cracking reactions."
7,Influences of preparation methods,"3.3 Influences of preparation methods The synthetic strategy is the one of main factors that affect the catalytic performance of transition metal-based catalysts in SCWG. Different synthetic strategies have obvious effects on the physicochemical characteristics including the interaction between active metals and support, pore structure, reusability, and deactivation of catalysts [139]. To optimize the catalytic performance of transition metal-based catalysts in SCWG, many efforts have been made to improve the synthetic procedure and explore new technical synthetic strategies [140]. 3.3.1 Impregnation and co-precipitation method Currently, the impregnation and co-precipitation are considered to be the most two widely used catalyst synthesis strategies for catalyzed SCWG process. The impregnation method is divided into three steps: (1) the support and impregnation solution are in contact for a certain time; (2) the support is dried to remove the absorbed liquid; and (3) the catalysts are activated by calcination or reduction [141]. The co-precipitation method forms a crystalline precipitate through three steps, namely supersaturation, nucleation, and growth [142]. Aksoylu et al. [143] noted that the co-precipitation catalyst showed a stronger interaction between the active component and support material, as well as a homogeneous metal distribution and higher surface area than the impregnated catalyst. Fig. 8 shows a schematic diagram of the active metals dispersed on the support in catalysts synthesized by impregnation and co-precipitation. Li et al. [144] compared the catalytic performances of Ni/MgAl2O4-Al2O3 catalysts synthesized by co-precipitation (CP-Ni-Mg-Al) and impregnation (IM-Ni-Mg-Al) in SCWG. Compared with the IM-Ni-Mg-Al catalyst (8.6 mol/kg feedstock), higher H2 yield was obtained from the SCWG OF glucose catalyzed by the CP-Ni-Mg-Al catalyst (11.8 mol/kg feedstock). Moreover, after being used for various SCWG reaction times, the Ni crystal size of IM-Ni-Mg-Al increased obviously, while that of the CP-Ni-Mg-Al catalyst changed only slightly. After the regeneration process, the CP-Ni-Mg-Al catalysts showed higher catalytic activities than did the IM-Ni-Mg-Al catalysts. The results indicated that the Ni/MgAl2O4-Al2O3 catalyst synthesized by the co-precipitation method showed more stable properties than did the catalysts synthesized by the step impregnation method. 3.3.2 Sol-gel method In addition, the sol-gel synthetic strategy has also been confirmed to be a promising alternative for the synthesis of catalysts used in SCWG [39,113,145]. Compared with the traditional impregnation catalyst, catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method have a narrow particle size distribution, high heat resistance, high agglomeration resistance, low deactivation rate, and excellent purity [146–148]. Fig. 9 shows the difference between the synthetic strategy involved in sol-gel and impregnation (Ni/Al2O3-MgO and Ni/Al2O3-CeO2 are taken as examples). Aghamohammadi et al. [149] synthesized Ni/Al2O3-CeO2 nanocatalysts using sequential impregnation and the sol-gel method and compared their physicochemical properties. As shown in Fig. 10 (a), broader and less intense peaks were obtained in the XRD pattern of the sol-gel synthesized catalyst, which can be explained by the higher dispersion of active metal. According to the FESEM images (Fig. 10 (b, c)), compared with catalyst produced by the impregnation method, the catalyst synthesized by the sol-gel synthesis method has a more regular and uniform morphology. The existence of irregular particles on the catalyst produced by the impregnation method may be because of the aggregation of particles and the growth of irregular particles during the preparation. Transition metal-based catalysts synthesized by the sol-gel method are reported to have larger surface areas than with those synthesized by the impregnation method, which favors enhanced catalyst activity during the SCWG process. Hossain et al. [150] synthesized aerogel Ni-Al2O3 and Ru-Ni-Al2O3 catalysts via the sol-gel process followed by supercritical CO2 drying (Fig. 11 ). Impregnated catalysts were also synthesized for comparison. The results showed that the aerogel catalysts exhibited higher surface areas and pore volumes compared to the impregnated catalysts. It is worth mentioning that the scCO2 drying process exhibited a positive effect on enhancing catalytic activity due to the increased surface area and reactant diffusivity. 3.3.3 Supercritical water synthesis method Many studies [103,106,152–154] have found that due to the severe conditions in supercritical water, the transition metal-based catalysts synthesized by some traditional methods, including impregnation, sol-gel method and co-precipitation, tend to sinter and carbonize, easily leading to the deactivation of catalysts during the SCWG process. In order to improve the stability of transition metal-based catalysts in SCWG, researchers have proposed the use of supercritical water hydrothermal synthesis (SCWS) to prepare heterogeneous catalysts for catalyzing SCWG [155,156]. Due to its unique physicochemical properties, supercritical water provides an excellent crystallization condition for the precipitation and nucleation of inorganic ions, which makes it easier to synthesize some catalysts that are difficult to synthesize in conventional ways, and it is possible to obtain catalysts with uniform morphology and structure in this way [72]. Prior to being applied to SCWG, this SCWS strategy has been widely used in catalyst and material synthesis [157–160]. SCWS is considered to be a green and sustainable chemical method because it does not use any organic solvent. Fig. 12 exhibits a schematic of the SCWG process catalyzed by SCWS-synthesized catalysts. Zhu et al. [161] applied the SCWS method to synthesize a series of Ni/ZrO2 catalysts at 500 °C and 23 MPa and evaluated their catalytic performance and properties in the SCWG of glycerol. The highest H2 yield was observed when the 0.4Ni-0.6ZrO2 catalyst was used, which is 1.5-fold higher than that of the non-catalytic case. The experimental results demonstrated that Ni/ZrO2 catalysts synthesized by the SCWS method showed good anti-coking ability, as well as an excellent stability of the crystalline structure and morphology. Li et al. [155] compared the catalytic performances of SCWS-prepared Ni-based catalysts and sol-gel-prepared Ni-based catalysts. As shown in Fig. 13 (a-1, c-1), the fresh SC-Ni/MgO-Al2O3 (synthesized by SCWS) catalyst exhibited higher particle dispersion than did the fresh SG-Ni/MgO-Al2O3 (synthesized by sol-gel) catalyst. According to Fig. 13 (b, d), the used SC-Ni/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst still showed highly dispersed particles, while the used SG-Ni/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited larger crystallized particles over the catalyst surface. According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 13 (e, f)), the SC-Ni/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst showed a stable crystalline structure after the SCWG reaction. In comparison with the catalysts prepared by the traditional sol-gel method, the SCWS-prepared catalysts showed obvious superiority for physicochemical property stability. 3.3.4 Microemulsion method In addition to the several catalyst synthetic strategies mentioned above, the microemulsion method has also been applied to the synthesis of catalysts for SCWG. However, there are only a few related reports. The microemulsion method can provide an excellent environment for the combination of precursors [162]. In addition, compared with impregnation, the microemulsion is a promising method for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with smaller particle size and bimetallic catalysts with controllable composition [163]. Barati et al. [164] tested the catalytic performance of the Ru/γ-Al2O3 nanocatalysts synthesized by the impregnation and microemulsion methods for SCWG of bagasse. They found that the microemulsion method remarkably decreased the average particle size of the catalyst and improved the dispersion percentage in comparison with the impregnation method. Moreover, the maximum H2 yield of 15.6 mmol/bagasse was obtained using the microemulsion-Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, which indicated that the excellent catalytic performance of the catalyst synthesized by the microemulsion method."
8,Modification of transition metal-based catalysts,"The main problem found when using transition metal-based catalysts for SCWG is deactivation by sintering and carbon deposition [172]. Modifying transition metal-based catalysts with other components such as rare earth oxide, noble metal, non-noble metal, and alkali metal are considered to be an effective way to enhance the catalytic activity and anti-coke deposition of transition metal-based catalysts. Table 4 shows a summary of recent studies on the SCWG of biowaste/model compounds using modified transition metal-based catalysts."
9,Rare earth oxide-promoted catalysts,"4.1 Rare earth oxide-promoted catalysts Rare earth oxides, as recognized redox promoters, can effectively optimize the electronic characteristics of a system [173]. Therefore, the positive effects of introducing various rare earth oxides into transition metal-based catalysts on the SCWG process have been confirmed [174]. Because of the excellent redox properties and special oxygen storage capacity, ceria (CeO2) has the potential ability to promote the activity, stability, and carbon resistance of supported transition metal-based catalysts [118,175–177]. Thus, it has been widely applied as a promoter for supported transition metal-based catalysts. Lv et al. [172] used CeO2 as promoter of Ni/Al2O3 to synthesize a Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts for improving the catalytic SCWG process. It is worth nothing that the addition of CeO2 further optimized the catalytic performance of Ni/Al2O3 for enhancing H2 yield and H2 selectivity. Moreover, they found that the coke deposition with Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 (0.5 g C/gCat) was less than that with Ni/Al2O3 (0.433 g C/g Cat), which indicated that Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 is better than Ni/γAl2O3 in anti-coke deposition due to the addition of CeO2. Furthermore, in another study [175], they found that the CeO2 may oxidize the solid carbon deposited on the support surface via the following reactions to reduce the carbon/coke deposition: (1) CeO2 ↔ CeO2-x + Ox; (2) Cs + Ox → Ox-1 + CO, where Ox refers to the lattice oxygen at the CeO2 surface, and Cs is the solid carbon deposited on the support surface. Moreover, it was also found that the H2 yield increased initially and then decreased with the increasing CeO2 loading, indicating that an appropriate amount of promoter can enhance the gasification process. However, an excessively high promoter loading may decrease the catalytic activity of the supported catalyst, which can be explained by the fact that the addition of a high concentration of accelerator will significantly reduce the surface area of the supported catalysts. La2O3 is another promising rare earth oxide frequently used for promoting supported transition metal-based catalysts [178]. It was confirmed that La2O3 can enhance both catalyst performance and coke resistance, potentially avoiding metal agglomeration [179–182]. To better understand the role of promoted catalysts on SCWG, Chowdhury et al. [183] synthesized Ni-based Al2O3 catalysts doped with La2O3 and investigated the reaction mechanism of coke minimization. They found that La2O3-promoted catalysts can inhibit the methanation of CO2 (R5) by adsorbing CO2. As the product from the reaction of La2O3 and CO2, La2O2CO3 can react with surface carbon (scavenging coke) at the periphery to form CO and La2O3, which reduce carbon deposition, and thus favors catalyst deactivation minimization. Moreover, the CO produced from the reaction of La2O2CO3 and carbon may promote the water-gas shift reaction (R3). The related reactions are as follows: (1) La2O3 + CO2 ↔ La2O2CO3; (2) La2O2CO3 + C → La2O3 + 2CO."
10,Noble-metal bimetallic catalysts,"4.2 Noble-metal bimetallic catalysts In recent years, to improve the SCWG process of biowaste, enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst, and prolong its life, bimetallic catalysts containing non-noble or noble transition metals have been extensively studied. The noble transition metals, including Ru, Pt, and Pd, can be used as efficient co-active components to synthesize efficient bimetallic catalysts. Zhang et al. [184] synthesized Ni80Ru20 bimetallic catalysts supported by AC, Al2O3, CeO2, and ZrO2 for the SCWG of phenol. Compared with Fig. 14 (a) and Fig. 14 (c), the results of the DFT calculation for phenol hydrogenation shown in Fig. 14 (b) exhibited the most favorable energy configuration. In comparison with pure Ni, the presence of Ru can increase the hydrogenation rate of phenol by reducing the activation barrier close to 0.2 eV. The H2 and CH4 yields showed an increasing trend with increasing the Ru/Ni ratio, which indicates that the addition of Ru metal on Ni-based catalysts favors the C-C bond cleavage and steam reforming reactions (R1, R2). In addition, it is worth mentioning that the addition of Ru on the Ni-based catalysts is beneficial to the transformation of carbon from the aqueous to the gaseous phase, which is related to the higher activity of Ru for scission than Ni [185]. Behnia et al. [44] conducted SCWG of glucose catalyze by the Ni20%Ru2%/Al2O3 catalyst, and they proved that the addition of Ru can improve the catalytic performance of the original catalyst and inhibit the formation of char/tar during the SCWG process. The Ni20%Ru2%/Al2O3 catalyst showed a high stability because the Ru prevented the Ni particles from sintering. In addition, it was also found that Ru not only favors an increased Ni dispersion and reducibility but also inhibits the leaching of Al and Ni metals in SCW."
11,Noble-metal-free bimetallic catalysts,"4.3 Noble-metal-free bimetallic catalysts Although noble-metal bimetallic catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance in SCWG, the high cost of noble metals is an obvious limitation for their industrial application. Thus, bimetallic catalysts synthesized with non-noble metals (such as Ni, Co, Zu, Cu, Y, and Mo) attract attention due to their low cost, whose catalytic performance is possibly comparable or even better than that of some noble-metal bimetallic catalysts [186]. To study the influence of non-noble metal combinations on the SCWG of furfural, Jin et al. [156] synthesized a series of noble-metal free bimetallic catalysts (Co-Ni/TiO2, Zn-Ni/TiO2, Cu-Zn/TiO2, and Cu-Ni/TiO2) using the SCWS method. Based on the H2 mole fraction, compared with other catalysts, the syngas produced from SCWG process catalyzed by Cu-Zn/TiO2 (19.56%) and Zn-Ni/TiO2 (18.63%) had higher hydrogen fraction, which indicated that the bimetallic catalysts containing Zn exhibited a higher catalytic activity according to the H2 mole fraction. Lee et al. [187] evaluated the influence of different activated charcoal-supported transition metal catalysts including Ni-Fe/AC, Ni-Y/AC, and Ni/AC on the SCWG of glucose. Among all the catalysts studied, the Ni-Y/AC catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance according to the gasification efficiency, H2 yield. Rashidi et al. [188] conducted the study about the SCWG of sugarcane bagasse catalyzed by the Cu-promoted CNT-supported Ni catalysts. It was found that the addition of 0.5% Cu into the Ni/CNT obviously promoted the total gas and H2 yields. However, a further increase in the amount of Cu caused a decrease in the catalytic activity because of the CNT blockage caused by the high percentage of metal loading. Guan et al. [108] tested the catalytic performance of Co/AC, Ni/AC, and Ni-Co/AC for improving SCWG of phenol at 475 °C. Compared with Ni/AC, crystalline NiCo catalysts are smaller and more highly dispersed in the AC supporter, which leads to a higher catalytic activity and increased H2 yield (29.9 mmol/g feedstock)."
12,Alkaline-earth metal-promoted catalysts,"4.4 Alkaline-earth metal-promoted catalysts Alkaline-earth metals is beneficial to the adsorption of water and the surface migration of OH, which helps to reduce the rate of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface [189], especially for Al2O3-based supports that have acidic sites [190]. Therefore, apart from the rare earth oxides and noble/non-noble metals, the alkaline-earth metals (Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr, etc.) are also considered as effective for promoting transition metal-based catalysts [191,192]. Due to their unique properties, the alkaline-earth metal-promoted catalysts has been extensively applied in the other thermochemical processes such as steam reforming [140]. In the study conducted by Song et al. [193], Sr was added into Ni/Al2O3-ZrO2 as a promoter for enhancing the H2 yield from the steam reforming. It is worth mentioning that the introduction of an Sr promoter reduces the acidity of the catalysts (Fig. 15 ), which helps to obtain a more favorable reaction pathway. Furthermore, the addition of Sr exhibits a remarkable effect for improving the catalytic activity of original catalysts because of an increased Ni dispersion and inhibited acidity. Nevertheless, there have been few studies related to the application of alkaline-earth metal-promoted catalysts in the SCWG process. Zhang et al. [43] found that the Ni10/γ-Al2O3 catalyst modified by Mg could inhibit the formation of tar and coke from the SCWG process of glucose. In contrast, the Ca promoter did not show a obvious effects on reducing the formation of tar and coke. The design of alkaline-earth metal-promoted catalysts, and their application and catalytic performance in the SCWG of biowaste should be studied further in the future."
13,Technical challenges and future prospective,"For the efficient energy conversion of wet biomass and hydrogen production, SCWG has considerably more potential than traditional thermochemical conversions (such as pyrolysis and steam gasification) and biochemical technologies (such as aerobic fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and composting). However, the severe operating conditions involved may limit the large-scale industrial application of SCWG in the future. To avoid the excessive energy consumption of SCWG at higher temperatures, transition metal-based catalysts can be loaded into the SCWG process to promote hydrogen production and improve gasification efficiencies at mild reaction temperatures. In addition to their application in SCWG, transition metal-based catalysts have been also widely applied in other thermochemical processes. However, compared with their use in other thermochemical processes, SCWG is more likely to cause stability problems transition of transition metal-based catalysts such as deactivation and sintering. Therefore, optimizing the catalytic performances and physicochemical properties of transition metal-based catalysts in SCWG is one of the main challenges in current research. Although high hydrogen production is the primary advantage of using SCWG for converting waste biomass, other gases including CH4, CO2, and CO also appear in large proportions in the syngas. According to previous studies, the molar fraction of H2 accounts for approximately 10–60% of the syngas produced by the SCWG of biomass [194–196]. As the primary method for enhancing the mole fraction and selectivity of H2, the synthesis and use of efficient transition metal-based catalysts with high H2 selectivity need be studied further. Recently, model biowaste compounds (such as cellulose, lignin, glucose, and phenol) have been employed as the main materials for studying the catalytic performance of transition metal-based catalysts in SCWG. However, because the structure and components of the biowaste model compounds vary, the same catalyst may show different catalytic effects in the SCWG of different biowaste model compounds. Thus, it is necessary to consider the performance of newly synthesized catalysts in the gasification of different single compounds or mixtures of multiple compounds. In addition, there are few studies on the application of transition metal based catalysts in the SCWG of real biowaste. With industrial development, efficient transition metal-based catalysts will eventually be applied to the SCWG of real biomass. The composition of real biowaste is more complex than a single model compound, which may considerably affect the catalytic performance of transition metal-based catalysts. High-ash-containing biowaste feedstocks such as sewage sludge [197] and food waste [59] have high contents of metal elements including Cu, K, Ca, Mg, Si, and Na, which can be easily precipitated on the surface of the catalyst, leading to decreasing the activity and stability of transition metal-based catalysts [198]. Although many researchers confirmed that alkali salts existing in real biowaste have potential catalytic activity for improving the SCWG process [90,199], they also cause the corrosion of the transition metal-based catalysts. It is suggested that the inorganic content of the real biomass be removed/reduced by pretreatment before the SCWG process. In addition, the reactions between transition metals and the gaseous sulfur compounds (H2S) produced from the sulfur-containing compounds in real biowaste occur easily and inhibit the interaction of other reactant molecules with active components, causing the decrease of activity and thermal stability of transition metal-based catalysts [200–202]. Therefore, the application of transition metal-based catalysts in the SCWG of real biowaste also needs more attention, especially in terms of reducing the negative effects of inorganic substances in real biomass and gaseous sulfur compounds in the generated gas on the transition metal-based catalyst. In supercritical water, the leaching of active metals, upon which the reduced active metals are leached into the liquid residues, is one of the main factors for catalyst deactivation. As mentioned previously, heavy metals such as Zn, Ni, Co, Cu, and Cr are used as active metals to synthesize supported catalysts, among which Ni-based catalysts especially are widely used. Heavy metals leached from the SCWG process can pollute ground and surface water, which causes difficulties for the further treatment of liquid residues [203]. Therefore, in addition to improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst, it is also necessary to enhance their anti-leaching ability and recyclability by improving catalyst preparation methods, optimizing support materials, and adding promoters. Moreover, to enhance the comprehensive utilization rate of biowaste resources, the combined biochemical and thermochemical treatment method can be further considered. As shown in Fig. 16 , it can potentially be applied to SCWG technology to efficiently treat large amounts of by-products such as the biogas slurry produced from anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the solid residue obtained from SCWG can be dried to produce high-value liquid fuels by co-pyrolysis with other raw materials."
14,Conclusion,"Catalytic SCWG is a promising technology in biowaste conversion industries for hydrogen production. In the present paper, a comprehensive review of the recent advances in SCWG of biowaste catalyzed by transition metal-based catalysts has been provided. The application of transition metal-based catalysts in SCWG seems to be a potential alternative to homogeneous catalysts and other common heterogeneous catalysts (AC and metal oxides). However, improving the catalytic performance and inhibiting the catalyst deactivation have emerged as crucial problems that need to be overcome. Currently, the research on active components is mainly focused on their application, while the exploration of catalytic mechanisms and theoretical calculations is limited. In addition, the characteristics of the support material such as the redox or acid-base properties exhibit a remarkable effect on improving the anti-coke deposition and catalytic performance of the catalyst. The addition of a second metal and rare earth oxides such as La2O3 and CeO2 can efficiently suppress coke formation. Although most of noble transition metal-based catalysts have a higher catalytic activity than that of non-noble transition metal-based catalysts for SCWG, considering their costs, optimizing non-noble metal catalysts by improving the synthetic methods and catalyst structure is still the main challenge and research direction in the future."
