0,Introduction,"Long chain fatty alcohols are oleochemicals widely used in making plasticizers, lubricants, detergents, personal care products, emulsifiers and antioxidants (Mudge, 2005). They also have potential to be used as promising biofuel candidates by being added as oxygenates in gasoline or by totally replacing gasoline (Fortman et al., 2008; Stephanopoulos, 2007). Currently, for commercial production, fatty alcohols are mainly derived either from natural sources, such as plant oil or waxes, by the process of transesterification followed by hydrogenation (Matheson, 1996) or from petrochemical feedstock by oligomerization of ethylene followed by oxidation (Noweck and Grafahrend, 2006). Both the processes are leading concern towards environment and ecological problems. Therefore, efforts are being made towards exploration and investigation of alternate and more sustainable process of manufacturing fatty alcohols from renewable feedstock (Choi and Lee, 2013). Advancement in metabolic engineering field and bioprocess optimization has culminated into production of many chemical commodities including bioalcohols like ethanol, butanol etc. from renewable feedstock or from simple sugars (Munjal et al., 2015; Munjal et al., 2012). Development of genomic tools for some well characterized heterologous hosts like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have led to successful production of diverse range of commodity chemicals. In the absence of any natural microbes producing fatty alcohols, efforts have been made to produce them via pathway engineering. Fatty alcohol biosynthesis has been achieved in E. coli by two-step reduction process ( Fig. 1). In the first step, fatty aldehyde is formed via fatty acyl-ACP/CoA by the activity of fatty acyl ACP/CoA reductase (AAR/ACR) (Coursolle et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Steen et al., 2010; Youngquist et al., 2013) or via free fatty acid by the activity of α-dioxygenase/carboxylic acid reductase (αDOX/CAR) (Akhtar et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2015; Mattam and Yazdani, 2013). In the second step, fatty aldehyde is further converted to fatty alcohol by unknown endogenous aldehyde reductase (s) of E. coli. There have been reports of dual activity of enzymes where fatty acyl-CoA is directly reduced to fatty alcohol, e.g., fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) from jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) (Metz et al., 2000) and MAACR from Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 (Hofvander et al., 2011; Willis et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). Fatty alcohol biosynthesis has been extensively investigated in terms of production of different chain length alcohols using various thioesterases (Akhtar et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Steen et al., 2010), but aldehyde reductase responsible for reduction of specific chain length aldehyde into alcohol is still obscure. Rodriguez and Atsumi (Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2012) found 8 genes (adhE, adhP, betA, eutG, fucO, yiaY, yjgB and yqhD) majorly contributing to short chain alcohol (isobutanol) formation and further engineered a strain (AL626) with deletions of these genes for producing high titer of isobutyraldehyde. This intervention, however, still produced significant amount of isobutanol, suggesting the presence of additional aldehyde reductase. Further comprehensive screening of 44 candidates annotated in E. coli genome as reductase, oxidoreductase and dehydrogenase, resulted in shortlisting of 5 more genes (yahK, ybbO, gldA, dkgA and yghA) whose combined deletion in AL626 strain showed 90–99% reduction in endogenous aldehyde reductase activity towards short and medium range of aldehyde substrate (C2-C12) (Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2014). But enzyme responsible for conversion of long chain aldehyde, i.e., C14-C18, in E. coli is being eluding. Previously comparative analysis of in vitro enzymatic assay of AdhP, YqhD and AdhE had shown that AdhP could reduce hexadecanal into hexadecanol but overexpression of adhP gene did not influence fatty alcohol production (Cao et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014). Besides, overexpression of yjgB (Akhtar et al., 2013) and yqhD (Cao et al., 2015) had also shown improvement in long chain alcohol production. However, none of these studies suggests which enzyme(s) play major role in vivo for conversion of long chain fatty aldehyde into alcohol. This knowledge will be useful in designing an efficient biocatalyst for overproduction of long chain fatty alcohols. Here, we performed detailed in silico analysis to select genes that could possibly be involved in converting long chain fatty aldehyde to alcohol and then studied role of each gene for carrying out this reaction under in vivo condition. The best performing gene product was analyzed for the substrate specificity both under in vivo and in vitro conditions. To make a biocatalyst suitable for long chain fatty alcohols, strain engineering was performed to produce optimal amount of long chain aldehyde intracellularly that could serve as substrate for the identified aldehyde reductase. Further engineering was performed to increase the availability of fatty acyl-ACP precursor by improving the carbon flux towards fatty acid synthesis pathway and by minimizing the flux towards competing pathway leading to biomass. Finally, the titer of long chain fatty alcohol was increased in the culture by performing fed-batch cultivation."

3,Screening of E. coli genome database for genes encoding enzymes with potential activity towards fatty aldehyde to fatty alcohol conversion,"2.2 Screening of E. coli genome database for genes encoding enzymes with potential activity towards fatty aldehyde to fatty alcohol conversion In absence of the knowledge related to enzyme responsible for conversion of long chain fatty aldehydes to fatty alcohol, we searched the E. coli genome database at ecocyc.org website for all the genes that have been annotated as aldehyde reductase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. List of all those genes have been mentioned in Supplementary Table S1. We found 24 genes annotated as aldehyde reductase (ydfG, yihU, yjgB, yahK, mhpF, aldA, adhE, asd, betB, adhp, frmA, proA, fucO, yghZ, dkgB, dkgA, ybbO, yghA, yqhD, feaB, rutE, gabD, glxR and argC), 24 genes annotated as aldehyde dehydrogenase (prr, puuC, aldA, yagS, yagT, yagR, astD, mhpF, aldB, yahK, adhE, asd, betB, adhP, frmA, proA, gapA, argC, sad, yqhD, maoC, feaB, usg, eutE) and only 3 genes annotated as alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE, adhP, eutG). Among these, 12 genes (yahK, mhpF, aldA, adhE, asd, betB, adhP, frmA, proA, argC, yqhD and feaB) appeared in more than one category. Further, asd and gapA gene deletion were reported to be lethal (Baba et al., 2006) whereas proA and argC deletion did not allow cells to grow on minimal media with glucose (Patrick et al., 2007). Therefore, total 33 genes were shortlisted from the E. coli genome database for performing the screening experiment. In addition, 2 more genes (yiaY and gldA) were also included in our study as they were shown in literature to have activity for isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol reaction (Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2012; Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2014), and they might possibly also have activity towards long chain."
4,Screening of gene(s) responsible for conversion of long chain aldehyde to alcohol under in vivo condition,"2.3 Screening of gene(s) responsible for conversion of long chain aldehyde to alcohol under in vivo condition Gene encoding the enzyme responsible for conversion of fatty aldehyde to alcohol was screened using single knockout strains of Keio Collection (procured from CGSC, Yale University, listed in Table 1). All single knockouts strains were streaked on LB-kanamycin agar plate and incubated overnight at 37°C. Single isolated colony was inoculated in 5mL LB medium in duplicate with 30μg/mL of kanamycin as antibiotic and kept overnight on incubator shaker at 37°C. 50µL of overnight culture was inoculated in 3mL M9 modified medium (Schirmer et al., 2010) having 2% glucose and 100mg/L of hexadecanal. Substrate specificity of YbbO and AdhP proteins for different chain length aldehydes was determined using 100mg/L of C10, C12, C14, C16 and C18 chain length aldehyde in different test tubes as mentioned above. Caps of test tubes were properly sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation of aldehyde and cultures were placed on incubator-shaker at 30°C, 120rpm for 48h. Sample was prepared by mixing equal volume of culture and ethyl acetate and separated organic layer was analyzed through GC system (Schirmer et al., 2010). Percentage conversion of fatty aldehyde to alcohol was calculated with respect to background E. coli host strain BW25113 of Keio collection. Data is represented as average and standard deviation of two biological replicates."
5,Strain and plasmid construction,"2.4 Strain and plasmid construction Details of strains and plasmids used in the current study have been mentioned in Table 1. E. coli DH5α strain was used for all cloning and genetic manipulation purpose. Knockout strains were generated through P1 bacteriophage transduction method where desired gene was replaced by FRT flanked kanamycin resistant gene (Mattam and Yazdani, 2013; Munjal et al., 2012; Thomason et al., 2007). Antibiotic resistant gene was further eliminated by transforming pCP20 expressing flippase enzyme. Deletion was confirmed through PCR via primers made using flanking regions of the gene. Sequence of oligonucleotides used for cloning and confirmation of deletion of genes are mentioned in supplementary Table S2. To construct the pZF11 and pZF12 plasmid, the acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) gene from S. elongatus PCC 7942 (Schirmer et al., 2010) was amplified and cloned at KpnI/SalI and SacI/SalI restriction sites in pZS21mcs and pQE30 plasmid, respectively. Codon optimized gene for aar was also cloned in pQE30 at BamHI and SalI restriction site to get pZF13. Native ybbO gene was amplified using E. coli DH5α genomic DNA as template and cloned at BamHI and SacI site in pQE30 to obtain pZF14. A plasmid construct pZF15 containing aar and ybbO genes with their own T5 promoter and rrnB terminator was made by amplifying ybbO gene along with promoter and terminator from pZF14 plasmid using primers pQE_XbaI_Fwd and pQE_XbaI_Rev and cloned in pZF13 plasmid at XbaI site. Codon optimized gene of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc) from Corynebacterium glutamicum was cloned in pZS21mcs at KpnI/SalI sites to obtain pAJ01. For construction of pKJ01, pKJ02 and pKJ03 plasmids containing fabZ, fadR and fabZ+fadR genes, respectively, the genes were amplified from E. coli DH5α genome and cloned in the plasmids as mentioned in Table 1."
6,Clone selection and cultivation conditions,"2.5 Clone selection and cultivation conditions Variations were observed in the product profiles of engineered cells between different transformed colonies. Therefore, for selection of colonies which optimally produced hydrocarbon for a particular construct, 5 colonies were screened each time and one which was optimal for production was preserved as a glycerol stock for future purpose. For screening, colonies were grown in 5mL LB broth medium with appropriate antibiotics at the final working concentrations of 100μg/mL ampicillin, 30μg/mL kanamycin and/or 34μg/mL chloramphenicol. Culture tubes were incubated overnight in incubator-shaker at 180rpm at 37°C and 50µL of grown culture was used to inoculate 3mL secondary culture having M9 modified medium supplemented with 2% glucose and 1mg/L of thiamine (Schirmer et al., 2010). Culture was induced at the time of secondary inoculation in M9 medium with 0.01mM IPTG for pQE30 based plasmid and/or 100ng/mL of anhydrotetracyclin for pZS21mcs/pZA31mcs based vector and further kept on incubator-shaker at 30°C for another 48h. Hydrocarbon analysis were done after extraction of hydrocarbon from cultures, analyzed through either GC-FID or GC–MS/MS by considering proper internal standard (1-octadecene) and external standards. Non-volatile metabolites were analyzed through the HPLC. For each condition, experiments were performed in duplicate and data has been presented as average and standard deviation of the two biological replicates."
7,Enzyme assay for YbbO (NADP+ dependent aldehyde reductase),"2.6 Enzyme assay for YbbO (NADP+ dependent aldehyde reductase) To determine aldehyde reductase activity of YbbO, strain harboring pZF14 was inoculated in 5mL LB medium with 100μg/mL of ampicillin. The overnight culture (1%) was used to inoculate 250mL of secondary culture, grown till OD600 of ~0.5–0.6 and then induced with 1mM IPTG for additional 3h. Cells were collected through centrifugation at 8000rpm at 4°C, lysed via sonication and YbbO protein was purified through Ni-NTA chromatography. Elutes having purified proteins were pooled and buffer exchanged with 50mM Tris buffer (pH 7.2) and protein concentration was quantified by BCA kit using BSA as standard. For assaying enzyme activity, experiment was conducted in microtiter plates with reaction volume of 200µL using modified protocol published before (Liu et al., 2014; Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2014). The reaction mixture consists of 10mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 1mM NADPH, 5% DMSO, 2μM protein and different concentration (0.25mM, 0.5mM, 1mM, 2mM) of aldehydes of chain length C2, C4, C6, C8, C10, C12, C14, C16 and C18 whose stocks were prepared in absolute ethanol, except for C2 whose stock was prepared in ethyl acetate to avoid the interference of enzymatic product i.e. ethanol. Activity was monitored at 340nm at 30°C via reduction of aldehyde with NADPH by using SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). One unit (1U) of activity corresponds to oxidation of 1 µmol of NADPH per minute."
8,Analytical techniques,"2.7 Analytical techniques Cell growth was measured by taking absorbance at 600nm in 1mL cuvette using Ultraspec 3100 pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). For fatty aldehyde and alcohol analysis, equal volume of ethyl acetate containing 10mg/L of 1-octadecene as internal standards was added in the culture and mixed through vortexing for 20min (Schirmer et al., 2010). The solution was then centrifuged for 10min at 12,000rpm and upper organic layer was used for analysis. Gas chromatography system (GC, 7890A from Agilent) equipped with HP-5 column of 30m length, 0.32mm internal diameter and 0.25µm film thickness and FID detector was used for analysis. The oven programme was set as follows: initial 100°C for 3min, then temperature ramped up to 250°C with rate of 10°C/min and was then held at 250°C for additional 10min. Total running time of the programme was 28min. The inlet and detector temperature were maintained at 150°C and 280°C, respectively. Further confirmation of products was made through GC–MS/MS analysis using HP-5 MS column with the same programme mentioned above except final temperature held at 300°C. The MS Quadrupole (Agilent) scanned from 50 to 550 m/z. For confirmation and quantification, standards from Absolute Standards, TCI America were used."
9,Fed-batch cultivation for long chain alcohol production,"2.8 Fed-batch cultivation for long chain alcohol production For fed-batch cultivation using M9 minimal medium with yeast extract, seed culture was prepared from freshly transformed cells. Single colony was grown in 20mL LB medium with 100μg/mL ampicillin and 30μg/mL kanamycin at 37°C and 120rpm. After 16h of growth, 6mL of culture was harvested and inoculated in a bioreactor with working volume of 300mL of M9 modified medium as mentioned earlier (Schirmer et al., 2010) along with addition of 0.5% yeast extract and 2% glucose. The culture was fed with sterile solution containing 55% glucose, 1.5% MgSO4, 20% yeast extract, trace metals (Schirmer et al., 2010) and 2X antibiotics. Feeding was performed at exponential rate as mentioned earlier (Yazdani et al., 2004). Culture was induced with 0.01mM IPTG and 100ng/mL anhydrotetracyclin when feed was started. For fed-batch cultivation in M9 minimal medium in absence of any complex carbon or nitrogen source, cells were inoculated from glycerol stock in 5mL LB medium with 100μg/mL ampicillin and 30μg/mL kanamycin and grown at 37°C and 120rpm. After 10h of growth, 4% of primary inoculum was inoculated in 30mL of M9 minimal medium and further grown for 12h at 30°C to maintain cells in early log phase. The grown cells from secondary culture was used to inoculate a bioreactor containing 300mL of M9 modified medium as mentioned earlier (Schirmer et al., 2010) along with 1% glucose. Culture was induced with 0.01mM IPTG and 100ng/mL anhydrotetracyclin at the time of inoculation. The culture was fed with sterile solution containing 50% glucose in M9 minimal medium and 1X antibiotics. Feeding was initiated at the rate of 3 g/L/h when OD at 600nm reached to 3–4. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was maintained at 40% through PID (proportional, integral and derivative) control by controlling RPM, air and pure O2 proportion. Samples were collected at different time interval for measuring cell density and fatty alcohol production. Data from best of the two cultivation batches have been presented. To analyze the effect of dodecane overlayering, 10% dodecane was added once the feed was started, with rest of the parameters remaining same as mentioned before."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Screening of gene(s) encoding enzyme(s) responsible for long chain fatty alcohol production in E. coli,"3.1 Screening of gene(s) encoding enzyme(s) responsible for long chain fatty alcohol production in E. coli Cyanobacterial isolates have been shown earlier to produce long chain alkanes, majorly C15 and C17 chain length, via fatty acid synthesis pathway through aldehyde as an intermediate (Schirmer et al., 2010; Shakeel et al., 2015). No long chain fatty alcohol was detected in these isolates. Interestingly, when alkane producing cyanobacterial pathway consisting of acyl ACP reductase (AAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) were overexpressed heterologously in E. coli, a significant amount of long chain alcohols (>C14) were detected, which competed with alkane formation for the fatty aldehyde precursors (Howard et al., 2013; Schirmer et al., 2010). This observation led to the hypothesis that there is an endogenous enzyme in E. coli that can recognize long chain fatty aldehydes produced by AAR and converts it into corresponding alcohols. Further investigation carried out by Liu's group (Liu et al., 2014) via in vitro reconstitution of three alcohol dehydrogenases, i.e., AdhP, AdhE and YqhD, concluded that among these three, AdhP is the major contributor for conversion of fatty aldehyde to fatty alcohol. This study, however, was not sufficient to rule out the major role of other enzymes for this reaction under in vivo condition. We therefore analyzed the E. coli genome database at ecocyc.org website to search for genes of all possible enzymes that have the ability to use aldehyde as substrate. We found there were 24 genes each under the category of aldehyde reductase and aldehyde dehydrogenase and 3 genes annotated as alcohol dehydrogenase, as described in Section 2.2. There were few redundancies in the list and few genes were reported to be essential for the growth of the cells (see Section 2.2 for details). We therefore selected 33 genes from here and further included 2 more genes, yiaY and gldA, missing in our list whose products were shown to have activity towards isobutyraldehyde (Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2012; Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2014). To identify role of these 35 gene products, we used a method where a long chain aldehyde was added in the growing culture of the cells lacking individual gene and the resultant alcohol formation was analyzed in the extracellular medium due to the activity of endogenous enzyme. This approach was better than previously used approach by Rodriguez and Atsumi (2014) where they have screened 44 genes for reductase activity on the basis of isobutanol production, since enzyme specificity towards isobutanol production could be very different as compared to the ones that produce long chain alcohol. We found that the basal E. coli BW25113 strain used as control for our knockout study could convert exogenously added fatty aldehydes in the range of C10 to C18 into corresponding alcohols (Fig. S1). Production of C18 chain length alcohol was relatively low, perhaps because of limited C18 aldehyde entry inside the cells. We considered exogenous addition of C16 chain length aldehyde (hexadecanal) into the culture medium for screening the knockout strains since this aldehyde and its corresponding alcohol (hexadecanol) dominated within the extracellular metabolites when AAR was used to convert fatty acyl-ACP into fatty aldehyde in E. coli (Schirmer et al., 2010). Among the 35 gene knockout strains tested ( Fig. 2A, B and C), ybbO knockout reduced the ability of the strain to convert hexadecanal into hexadecanol by 90% (Fig. 2A and D). Both hexadecanal and hexadecanol profiles of wild type and ybbO deletion mutant were confirmed through mass spectra analysis (Fig. S2). This reduction was far greater than the ones achieved by rest of the strains, which were in the range of −21% to 42%. Considering that C14 aldehyde was more efficiently converted to its alcohol than C16 aldehyde (Fig. S1), we further tested the ability of all knockout strains to convert C14 chain length aldehyde (tetradecanal) to corresponding alcohol. We again found ybbO knockout strain showing maximum reduction in tetradecanol formation (Fig. S3), which clearly indicated that ybbO gene product was the major contributor of long chain alcohol production in E. coli. Our in vivo assay results showed that deletion of adhP gene yielded only 33.8% reduction in alcohol production (Fig. 2C), suggesting AdhP is not the main enzyme responsible for long chain alcohol production in E. coli as claimed earlier (Liu et al., 2014). A very low impact on reduction of long chain alcohol formation upon deletion of adhE and yqhD reiterated the earlier findings that the product of these two genes are responsible for only short chain alcohol formation in E. coli (Fig. 2C) (Atsumi et al., 2010). It is also worth noting that after performing screening of 44 genes for conversion of isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol, Rodriguez and Atsumi (Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2014) had to combine 13 gene knockouts to achieve greater than 90% reduction in alcohol of C2-C12 chain lengths. In our study, a single gene knockout strain for ybbO gene yielded 90% reduction in C16 chain length alcohol formation, which is a major competitor for alkane production (Schirmer et al., 2010). Thus ybbO gene knockout is likely to improve yield of those products which use fatty aldehyde as precursor, e.g., long chain alkane. In Ecocyc database, ybbO gene product has been annotated as NADP+ dependent aldehyde reductase with Rossmann-fold domain (for NADPH binding). Earlier studies have shown that YbbO has broad substrate activity towards aliphatic aldehyde (C4-C10) (Rodriguez and Atsumi, 2014) and it reduces retinal to retinol conversion (Jang et al., 2015)."
12,In vivo and in vitro chain length specificity of YbbO,"3.2 In vivo and in vitro chain length specificity of YbbO As shown in previous section, ybbO gene deletion majorly impacted the ability of cells to convert C16 chain length aldehyde into corresponding alcohol. We further tested the conversion ability of ΔybbO strain for the chain length C10-C16 and compared it with ΔadhP strain since AdhP was previously reported to be responsible for long chain alcohol formation (Liu et al., 2014). There was a clear indication that ybbO deletion mainly impacted the formation of long chain alcohol of C16 and C14 chain length while impact on medium chain alcohol formation of C10 and C12 chain length was significantly lower ( Fig. 3A). adhP deletion comparatively had much lower impact on reduction of C12-C16 chain length alcohol formation. Rather, adhP deletion had higher impact on formation of C10 chain length alcohol, suggesting that AdhP might be responsible for medium chain alcohol formation. We checked the biotransformation of C16 chain aldehyde to alcohol by 4 E. coli strains, and found DH5α giving the best result (Fig. S4). In order to test the strain transcending activity of YbbO, we deleted ybbO from DH5α and found 92% reduction in transformation ability (Fig. 3B). When ybbO gene was re-installed in the knockout strain via a plasmid, the strain regained its ability to transform long chain aldehyde to alcohol. Transformation of plasmid bearing ybbO gene in basal DH5α strain resulted in only 6% increase in long chain alcohol formation as compared to non-transformed cells (Fig. 3B), indicating that YbbO expressed via E. coli chromosome was sufficient to transform long chain aldehyde entered inside the cells from extracellular medium into alcohol. We further expressed YbbO recombinantly in E. coli along with 6-histidine tag at N-terminus and purified via metal affinity chromatography for testing its activity under in vitro condition. We considered fatty aldehydes of C2-C18 chain length for measuring kinetic parameters of YbbO, since longer than C18 chain aldehyde was not soluble in aqueous solution. YbbO had shown significant activity in the range of C6-C18 chain length aldehydes, suggesting its broad substrate specificity. A very low activity was detected towards C2 and C4 chain length aldehydes and thus it was difficult to measure the kinetic parameters for these two short chain aldehydes. The maximum affinity (lowest Km value) was demonstrated towards C18 chain length aldehyde, while maximum catalytic efficiency (highest Kcat/Km value) was shown towards C16 chain length aldehyde ( Table 2). These results further strengthened our claim that YbbO is responsible for long chain alcohol formation in E. coli."
13,Endogenous production of fatty aldehyde in E. coli using cyanobacterial acyl-ACP reductase gene,"3.3 Endogenous production of fatty aldehyde in E. coli using cyanobacterial acyl-ACP reductase gene We supplemented the culture with external fatty aldehyde for screening potential enzyme responsible of fatty alcohol production in E. coli in the previous Section 3.1. However, the fatty aldehyde eventually needs to be produced endogenously. There are mainly three mechanisms by which fatty aldehyde has been produced in E. coli, i.e., via AAR using fatty acyl-ACP, via αDOX/CAR using free fatty acid and via ACR using fatty acyl-CoA as substrate (Fig. 1). In case of 2nd and 3rd mechanism, the substrates of αDOX/CAR and ACR are not available in E. coli in sufficient quantity and thus a thioesterase and/or ligase need to be co-expressed for making the substrate available (Liu et al., 2013; Metz et al., 2000). Both these mechanisms end up utilizing an extra ATP and its conversion to AMP as compared to 1st mechanism. We therefore selected AAR from cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 7942 in our study to produce endogenous fatty aldehyde as it can directly use fatty acyl-ACP, which is an intermediate of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, as its substrate (Schirmer et al., 2010), and tested the production of fatty alcohols in the extracellular medium. It has been shown that promoters and copy numbers of plasmid does play a significant role in the level of gene expression and hence effect the overall production of metabolites (Cao et al., 2015; Harger et al., 2012). Therefore, aar gene from S. elongatus was cloned in different copy number plasmid (pZS21mcs and pQE30) and heterologously expressed in E. coli strain DH5α. Expression of native aar gene in low copy number plasmid, i.e., pZS21mcs, under the control of tetO promoter produced 0.82mg/L and 13.22mg/L of fatty aldehyde and fatty alcohol of C14-C18 chain length, respectively ( Fig. 4A), whereas production was increased to 1.13mg/L and 59.33mg/L, respectively, when aar gene was cloned in medium copy number plasmid (pQE30) under the control of T5 promoter (Fig. 4A). The results indicated that there was an increase in AAR expression with increase in plasmid copy number, which led to increase in fatty aldehyde/alcohol production. To further improve the gene expression, codon optimized aar gene was used to overcome the codon biasness in E. coli. The expression of codon optimized aar gene in pQE30 plasmid resulted in production of 31.85mg/L and 120mg/L of fatty aldehyde and fatty alcohol, respectively (Fig. 4(A)). The recombinant host majorly produced C16:0 (hexadecanol, 57%) and C18:1 (octadecenol, 27%) chain length fatty alcohols followed by C14:0 (tetradecanol, 14%) (Fig. 4A). This amount of long chain aldehyde/alcohol without doing any modification of cellular machineries was considerably higher as compared to the recent reports (Coursolle et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014), possibly due to differences in host-vector system and codon optimized gene sequence. Though AAR was responsible for fatty aldehyde production, we observed significant fatty alcohols in the culture medium due to the activity of endogenous enzyme. To confirm whether this endogenous enzyme is YbbO, we transformed plasmid containing aar gene in DH5α having ybbO deletion. We found drop in long chain fatty alcohol production from 120mg/L to 9mg/L and increase in long chain fatty aldehyde production from 31mg/L to 95mg/L in the ybbO deleted strain (Fig. 4B), suggesting YbbO being the major catalyst for this reaction. The tetradecanol, hexadecanol and octadecenol production was reduced by 78%, 94% and 96%, respectively, in the ybbO deleted strain, indicating higher specificity of ybbO towards longer chain length aldehydes, as well as its recognition of both saturated and unsaturated aldehydes. With the increase of AAR expression in DH5α strain, concentration of untransformed aldehyde also increased (Fig. 4A). The overexpression of YbbO along with AAR decreased the accumulation of long chain fatty aldehyde and increased the long chain fatty alcohol concentration from 120mg/L to 169.2mg/L in the extracellular medium (Fig. 4A). While testing the distribution of fatty alcohol in extracellular and intracellular fraction, we found more than 90% of fatty alcohols exported outside the cells (Fig. S5). The alcohols of chain length C14, C16 and C18:1 was increased from 17.61mg/L, 70mg/L and 32.8mg/L to 19.5mg/L, 103.5mg/L and 41.6mg/L, which suggested the broad substrate specificity of YbbO for long chain aldehydes. On the other hand, overexpression of adhP along with aar did not improve the fatty alcohol production (Fig. S6). Before undertaking further engineering approach to increase fatty alcohol titer in E. coli, we performed tolerance study to evaluate impact of higher concentration of fatty alcohol on cell growth. We found no significant impact on cell growth up to 8g/L fatty alcohol (Fig. S7). The cell growth was found to be hampered at 16g/L during initial growth phase but regained later."
14,Effect of modulating fatty acid metabolism pathway on fatty alcohol production,"3.4 Effect of modulating fatty acid metabolism pathway on fatty alcohol production Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway is the key to produce fatty alcohol since it provides precursor in the form of fatty acyl-ACP. Therefore it is likely that those genes which play crucial role in metabolism and regulation of fatty acid synthesis also have significant role in fatty alcohol production. Literature suggests that acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc) involved in conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, is the rate determining step for fatty acid synthesis (Davis et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2010). Further, FabZ (3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase) has been found to play important role in elongation cycle and FadR has been shown to be a transcriptional regulator that positively regulates fatty acid biosynthesis and increases the fatty acid production (Cao et al., 2015). Therefore, we overexpressed acc, fabZ and fadR genes individually in E. coli DH5α (pZF15) strain and found that total fatty alcohol accumulation increased from 169.2mg/L of basal strain to 193mg/L (14% increase), 223.8mg/L (32% increase) and 242mg/L (43% increase), respectively ( Fig. 5). Interestingly, we found that concentration of unsaturated fatty alcohol, particularly octadecenol (C18:1), had increased significantly by 86.9% in cells overexpressing fadR as compared to basal strain, whereas it had increased only by 11.6% and 21.2% in case of strains overexpressing aac and fabZ gene, respectively. A negative regulator of FAS pathway, FabR, which had been shown earlier to influence the composition and level of fatty acid (Lennen and Pfleger, 2013; Zhang et al., 2002), led to reduced fatty alcohol formation (121.38mg/L) upon its gene deletion ( Table 3). Further deletion of genes involved in free fatty acid production (tesA and tesB) or β-oxidation cycle (fadE or fadD) did not improve fatty alcohol formation (Table 3), indicating that these are not the major competing pathways for fatty alcohol production under the cultivation condition used in this study. Previous report does indicate increase in fatty alcohol production on deletion of fadE (Liu et al., 2014), but glycerol was used in that study as carbon source instead of glucose and thus might lead to some variation in outcome as compared to our results."
15,Effect of modulating phospholipid metabolism genes on fatty alcohol production,"3.5 Effect of modulating phospholipid metabolism genes on fatty alcohol production A major competitor for fatty alcohol production is the cellular biomass formation itself, since its membrane phospholipids component require fatty acyl-ACP as precursor. The main pathway for phospholipid formation includes products of two genes, plsB and plsC, and the deletion of any of these two genes is lethal. However, there is an alternate pathway that contributes to phospholipid formation, and is encoded by plsX and ygiH (or plsY) (Fig. 1). Individual deletion of these genes was found to be non-lethal, though combined double deletion was lethal (Larson et al., 1984; Yoshimura et al., 2007). Therefore we tested effect of individual deletion of plsX and ygiH gene on fatty alcohol production and found an increase in titer from 169mg/L to 213mg/L upon plsX deletion, whereas ygiH knockout did not impact the fatty alcohol formation (Table 3). We further overexpressed genes related to fatty acid synthesis, i.e., acc, fabZ and fadR, in the plsX deleted strain and observed 252, 253 and 270mg/L fatty alcohol production, respectively (Table 3). Combining the best two conditions, i.e., fabZ and fadR, for overexpression did not result in further improvement in long chain fatty alcohol titer (Table 3)."
16,Microbial production of fatty alcohol in fed-batch cultivation,"3.6 Microbial production of fatty alcohol in fed-batch cultivation We evaluated fatty alcohol production in a bioreactor under controlled condition using the best fatty alcohol producing strain i.e., E. coli ZF07/pZF15/pKJ02 having deletion in plsX gene and overexpression of aar, ybbO and fadR genes. The cultivation was performed at 300mL scale in a 500mL multi-vessel bioreactor in M9 modified medium containing glucose and yeast extract. The Feed was initiated at OD600 of around 10 at an exponential rate to achieve specific growth rate (μ) of ~0.2h−1. Total fatty alcohol accumulation in culture had reached to 422mg/L after 80h of cultivation ( Fig. 6A). The chain length distribution in total alcohol formed was in order of C16>C18:1>C14>C18>C12=C10, with 50% (212mg/L) of alcohol formed was hexadecanol (C16) (Fig. 6A). We further performed fed-batch cultivation in completely defined medium in presence and absence of dodecane layering, as mentioned in the Method Section 2.8. Addition of dodecane was shown earlier to help in making more accurate estimation of fatty alcohol production (Youngquist et al., 2013). Feed was initiated when OD at 600nm reached between 3 and 4 at the rate of 3g/L/h. Total fatty alcohol accumulation in culture had reached to 1287mg/L after 96h and 1989mg/L after 48h of cultivation in absence and presence of dodecane layering, respectively (Fig. 6B and C). In general, the proportion of longer chain fatty alcohol was higher in case of completely defined medium as compared to the complex medium, with marked difference observed in the quantity of C18:1 chain length. This is so far the highest reported value of long chain alcohols in the engineered E. coli using FASII pathway."
17,Conclusion,"In this study, our overall effort has been to engineer the E. coli DH5α strain for efficient production of fatty alcohol by overexpressing the specific AHR along with fine tuning of accessory pathway. Following in silico and in vivo analysis, we identified long chain fatty alcohol (≥C14) specific NADP+ dependent aldehyde reductase YbbO. Upon optimal expression of acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) of cyanobacterial origin along with the YbbO, we produced 169mg/L of fatty alcohol. Further modulation of fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis pathways had increased its production to 270mg/L. The titer of fatty alcohol reached to 1989mg/L in a bioreactor under controlled cultivation condition in the presence of dodecane layering. Our finding provides new insights that will accelerate the effort towards development of viable technology for fatty alcohol production."
