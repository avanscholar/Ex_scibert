0,Introduction,"The worldwide energy crisis and ecological contamination have motivated scientific community for conducting extensive sustainable research in clean energy production and environmental detoxification [1,2]. It is quite meaningful and important to develop environmentally sustainable materials and technologies to address the issues of energy production and environmental problems together [3]. The use of fossil fuels bring hazards to environment and difficult to meet the global energy shortage too. Hydrogen is an ideal clean and green source of energy produced mainly from expensive and energy consuming routes [4]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production has been efficient and clean route to generate hydrogen with a promising goal of achieving carbon-neutral environment [5,6]. Semiconductor photocatalysis has the capability to harvest solar energy to transform photons into electron-hole pairs for photo-degradation of pollutants and H2 evolution via water splitting [7,8]. Thus, H2 evolution and pollutant degradation can be simultaneously achieved by use of advanced photocatalysts. As far as pollutants in water bodies are considered, antibiotics residues have emerged as contaminants of concern as they are resistant to biological oxidation and traditional methods [9,10]. They are often toxic and gradually increase the antibiotic resistant bacteria which is hazardous for animals and humans [11]. China has witnessed a large consumption of antibiotics [12] which form about 60 % of pharmaceuticals being detected in major Chinese rivers. It was reported by Li et al. (2019) that sulfonamides, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones form 62 % of all antibiotics detected in major rivers of China [13]. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) with zwitterion structure find their large use in human and veterinary medicines owing to their broad spectrum use, potency and bio-availability [14]. Ofloxacin is a popular second generation FQ antibiotic used for treating bronchitis, gonorrhoea, pneumonia, skin, respiratory and urinary infections [15]. OFL and its residues have frequently been detected in wastewater treatment plant (1.8 ppb) and hospital effluents (35 ppb) [16,17]. Sulfonamides as antibacterial are widely used to treat infections [18] and have high chemical stability and water solubility. The sulfadiazine (SDZ) as one of sulfonamide antibiotics is applied in animal husbandry for preventing bacterial infections in livestock. SDZ has been broadly reported in bodies as river water and ground water [19] and pose serious hazards to human health and environment [20]. Photocatalysis has been used extensively for high performance removal of sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones antibiotics [21,22]. Especially, semiconductor heterojunctions with Z-scheme and dual Z-scheme transfer are highly effective in photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics [23,24] and hydrogen evolution [25]. Nevertheless, the limitations of single photocatalysts are addressed and addition advantages of each are well utilized, which increases the photocatalytic potential. Bismuth-based photocatalysts have been utilized widely for catalytic applications owing to their unique tunable band structures and high stability [26]. Bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) belongs to a family of layered perovskite compounds [27]. With a moderate wide band gap of 2.9 eV, it has been explored as a visible light photocatalyst. However the activity is limited by poor visible activity and poor quantum yield. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a metal free polymeric photocatalysts which has been widely used due to its exceptional qualities like low band gap, eco-friendly behavior, 2-D arrangement, inertness to thermal and chemical attacks and abundance of its precursor material [28]. The high charge recombination rate, however, limits its overall photo activity. With a positive CB, Bi4Ti3O12 can be coupled to a semiconductor with a lower band gap and a highly negative CB semiconductor like g-C3N4 (∼ -1.10 eV) to form an effective type-II or Z-scheme heterojunction. Adding a third component to a binary junction is always encouraging, as it further improves the further charge separation and hence photocatalytic activity via a dual Z-scheme mechanism. The dual electron transmission channel facilitates the protection of higher CBs at two interfaces for more active species production [29]. As a third component of dual Z-scheme heterojunction, Bismuth oxyhalides with lower band gaps are an apt choice. Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, I) are considered good photocatalysts with unique layered structure, and capable of working under visible light and sunlight [30]. By adjusting the bismuth content it’s feasible to promote the CB edges for BiOX [31]. Herein, we utilize Bi4O5I2 as it exhibits higher ability to degrade the organic pollutants owing to suitable VB and CB position. In this study, we have attempted to construct a novel dual Z-scheme g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction by a hydrothermal route for high performance coupled or simultaneous hydrogen production and antibiotics degradation under visible light. During hydrothermal synthesis, the leafy nanoflowers of Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 bind together efficiently with thin nanosheets of g-C3N4, to form a tight junction with a high interfacial charge transfer. The effective dual Z-scheme is assisted by I3 −/I− and Bi3+/Bi5+ redox mediator (presence confirmed by XPS measurement) boosts the separation and transfer for high photocatalytic activity. The two antibiotics OFL and SDZ were used as sacrificial agents for photocatalytic H2 production which was manifolds higher than without any sacrificial agents. The synergistic photocatalytic mechanism was proposed to explain the role of the pollutants on hydrogen evolution rate. This work thus represents an ideal platform serving the energy production and pollutant degradation simultaneously with high efficiency under visible and solar light opening new avenues for future."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of g-C3N4 and Bi4Ti3O12,"2.1 Synthesis of g-C3N4 and Bi4Ti3O12 The g-C3N4 was synthesized by the thermal condensation of urea as previously reported method [32]. To synthesize Bi4Ti3O12, 0.02 mol Bi(NO3)3·5 H2O solution in 15 mL acidic acid and 0.15 mL Ti(C4H9O)4 in 15 mL of ethylene glycol were prepared separately and mixed slowly followed by string at room temperature. The solution was then stabilized by adding 10 mL acetic acid and 10 mL ethylene glycol, before being heated to 80 °C for 24 h. The gel obtained was then transferred to 45 mL of 3 M NaOH and then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 160 °C for 16 h. The obtained products i.e Bi4Ti3O12 were subsequently filtered and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times and dried in air at 60 °C for 24 h."
3,Synthesis of g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 heterojunction (CBT),"2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 heterojunction (CBT) The CBT binary heterojunction was formed by hydrothermal route. A known amount of g-C3N4 suspension in ultrapure water was prepared by sonication. Separately, 0.02 mol Bi(NO3)3.5H2O solution in 15 mL acidic acid and 0.15 mL Ti(C4H9O)4 in 15 mL of ethylene glycol were prepared and mixed slowly followed by string at room temperature. The g-C3N4 suspension was added to the solution. With addition of acetic acid and ethylene glycol, the contents were heated at 80 °C for 24 h, followed by hydrothermal treatment 160 °C for 16 h. The samples were prepared by varying content of g-C3N4 as 10% g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12(CBT-10), 20% g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12(CBT-20), 40% g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 (CBT-40) and 50% g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 (CBT-50)."
4,Synthesis of g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction (CBTB),"2.3 Synthesis of g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction (CBTB) The CBTB heterojunction was prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route. A suspension of CBT-40 binary junction was prepared in ultrapure water followed by ultrasonication for 1 h. To this, 20 mL ethylene glycol, 0.972 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.33 g KI were added and stirred. The pH of this mixture was set 11 by using 2 M NaOH. The contents solution was stirred for 4 h at 30−40 °C. This was then treated hydrothermally at 120 °C for 24 h to obtain g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction. Different configurations with different final content Bi4O5I2 were prepared as 40%g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12)/10% Bi4O5I2 (BCBT-10), 40%g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12)/20% Bi4O5I2 (BCBT-20), 40%g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12)/30% Bi4O5I2 (BCBT-30), and 40% g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12)/40% Bi4O5I2 (BCBT-40). The bare Bi4O5I2 was prepared by similar method without addition of CBT. The whole scheme for preparing the single, binary and ternary catalysts is represented in Fig. 1 (a–d)."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to obtain crystal structure by Ultima IV instrument (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα irradiation and operated at 40 kV. The chemical bonding in the heterojunction and single catalysts was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (Nicolet IS10, Thermo Fisher instrument). The morphology and microstructure of synthesized materials was obtained by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JSM-7800 F instrument) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi H-7500 instrument) respectively. The elemental composition along with oxidation states were determined by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher) instrument with an Al Kα source. For determining the band structure and light absorbing potential, UV–vis Diffuse Reflectance spectrum (UV-DRS) was obtained with a Shimadzu, UV3600 spectrophotometer using standard BaSO4method. The charge carrier separation of as prepared photocatalysts was ascertained by photoluminescence (PL) with 400 nm excitation wavelength using FLS1000 instrument (Edinburgh Instruments). The point of zero charge (pzc) of synthesized catalysts was determined by Malvern Zetasizer ZSP, Malvern, UK."
6,Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical experiments,"2.5 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical experiments The electrochemical and photo-electrochemical measurements were done using CHI 660E three electrode electrochemical work station with reference electrode- Ag/AgCl (in 3 M KCl), working electrode- sample modified fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) and counter electrode- Pt mesh. For preparing sample modified working electrode, FTO (1 cm2) was soaked in acetone and then rinsed with ultrapure water and ethanol followed by plasma cleaning. 40 mg of photocatalyst was suspended in 5 mL ethanol and 1 mL of Triton X-100 and sonicated for 1 h. The suspension was used to prepare working electrode by spin coating onto FTO substrate. The electrolyte used was 0.2 M Na2SO4. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained and Nyquist plots were then used to analyze the charge transfer capacity (amplitude- 10 mV) under dark. The capacitance data obtained from impedance measurements (in 0.1 M Na2SO4) was used to obtain Mott − Schottky (M-S) plots. The flat band (FB) potentials for Bi4Ti3O12, g-C3N4 and Bi4O5I2 were obtained from M-S plots and hence conduction band edges were calculated. The photoelectrochemical experiments to measure photocurrent response (PCR) were performed under 500 W Xe lamp in quartz cell using the three electrodes."
7,Photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics with simultaneous hydrogen production,"2.6 Photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics with simultaneous hydrogen production The experiments were performed in following protocols: Photocatalytic degradation of OFL and SDZ alone under visible light; Photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light without any sacrificial agent under aerobic and anaerobic conditions; H2 evolution in presence of antibiotics as sacrificial agents under visible light; The photocatalytic experiments were performed in a Pyrex reactor equipped with gas circulation and a pumping system connected to auto-sampler. The experiments were executed with a circulating water system (temperature maintained at 30 ± 0.5 °C), to prevent thermal catalytic effects. For the anaerobic conditions, before experiment, the dissolved oxygen was removed from reaction system by vacuum pump. The light source used was a 500 W Xe lamp (240 mW cm−2) with 420 nm cut-off filter placed at 20 cm from reaction system for irradiation. 45 mg of photocatalyst powder was suspended in 100 mL antibiotic solution (10 mg L-1) and transferred to reactor vessel. As a carrier gas high purity Ar gas was used. On exposure to lamp, H2 evolution is observed which is analyzed and quantified by online gas chromatograph (GC-7900, Tianmei, China) having a capillary column (molecular sieve 5 Å column) and TCD detector. Simultaneously, to analyze the antibiotic degradation 20 μL of solution was injected out followed by centrifugation and filtration using 0.22 μm membrane filter. The residual antibiotic concentration was monitored by liquid chromatography using an Agilent 1200 high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) instrument equipped with C-18 column (5 μm, 4.5 mm × 150 mm) and a UV detector. 10 mg L-1 concentration of other sacrificial agents (Molar concentrations: OFL-2.7 × 10-5M, SDZ-3.9 × 10-5M, RhB-2.1 × 10-5M, TEOA- 6.7 × 10-5M) was used for simultaneous H2 production and photodegradation experiments. The same experiments were also conducted with visible light in aerobic conditions (initial DO- 6.3 mg L-1). The H2 production experiments (catalyst dose 40 mg in 100 mL water) without any sacrificial agent and photodegradation of antibiotics alone were also performed keeping all other parameters same. In addition, the catalyst (CBTB-30) dose was optimized (0.1 g L-1 to 0.8 g L-1) for OFL degradation. The effect of pH onto OFL and SDZ degradation alone, H2 production and coupled H2 evolution + antibiotic degradation was studied (pH = 3,5,7 & 9) to optimize the best performance conditions. For studying the effect of electrolytes onto antibiotics removal, 0.5 mM concentrations of Na+, Ca2+, Cl−, NO3 −, HCO3 − and SO4 2− were used."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods For determine the residual OFL concentrations; the mobile phase used was a mixture of acetonitrile and water (0.1 % HCOOH v/v). For SDZ, the mobile phase was water (0.3 % HCOOH) and methanol (80/20 v/v). The flow rare was 1 mL min−1. For analyzing the degradation intermediates, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) was performed using a Micromass Q-TOF micro instrument (Waters) in an electron spray positive mode. A C-18 column was used with flow rate of 400 μL min-1. A mixture of acetonitrile and water (0.1 % HCOOH) was used as mobile phase. 2 μL sample was injected using a auto-sampler. The OFL and SDZ degradation experiments were also performed separately by forming a suspension of photocatalyst (0.45 mg mL−1) in 100 mL antibiotic solution on exposure to 500 W Xe lamp. The simultaneous H2 production and antibiotic degradation was also performed using 2%Pt@CTBT catalyst (prepared by photodeposition of H2PtCl6) and also under natural solar light. The solar experiments were performed at a laboratory, 30.921 °N, 77.095 °E in the Western Himalayan region, India. A Shimadzu TOC-VCPH instrument was used to analyze the total organic carbon (TOC) during antibiotic removal. The effect of pH onto degradation of antibiotics, H2 evolution and simultaneous measurements were made. To elucidate the dominant active species during the OFL/SDZ degradation trapping or scavenging experiments using 1.0 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and p-benzoquinone (BQ) to scavenge h+, OH and O2- radicals respectively were performed. The ESR spectra of DMPO (5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) trapped OH and O2- radicals were obtained using a JES FA200 ESR spectrometer. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal was tested by Shimadzu TOCVCPN analyzer. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated by the following relation: % A Q E = n o o f r e a c t e d e l e c t r o n s n o o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s X 100 = n o o f H 2 m o l e c u l e s e v o l v e d X 2 n o o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s X 100 For determining the AQE for the photocatalysts 500 W Xe lamp (240 mW cm−2) with 420 (±5) nm band-pass filter was used."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns for g-C3N4, Bi4Ti3O12, Bi4O5I2, CBT-40, CTBT-20 and CTBT-30 photocatalysts. The lower 2θ diffraction peak at 13.12° for g-C3N4 refers to (100) in-plane structural unit (JCPDS in agreement with standard JCPS 87–1526 for graphitic structure [33]. Secondly, the diffraction peak at 27.4° corresponds to periodic stacking of graphitic layers along (002) plane. The inter-planar d-spacing as calculated is 0.325 nm. The XRD pattern for Bi4Ti3O12 shows typical diffraction peaks in agreement with standard JCPDS card No. 35-0795 [34]. This refers to orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 i.e bismuth-layered perovskite phase with lattice constants of a = 5.44, b = 32.77 and c = 5.37 Å. For BiO5I2 the peaks appeared at 2θ values 24.31°, 27.95°, 32.73°, 37.50°, 43.38°, 48.72°, 51.81°, and 53.62° corresponding to the (311), ( 4 ¯ 1 ¯ 1), (402), ( 4 ¯ 04), (422), (006), ( 5 ¯ 24), and (811) planes, respectively [35]. Bi4O5I2 is in monoclinic phase with P1211 space group. The minor peaks at 20.2° 32.4°, and 62.1° (can be seen clearly in XRD pattern for bare Bi4O5I2, i.e., Figure S1 correspond to another iodide deficient bismuth oxyiodide i.e Bi3O5I2 [36]. Thus a minor phase of Bi3O5I2 is also present. The binary junction 40 wt% g-C3N4/Bi4O5I2 (CBT-40) shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of both the semiconductors with slight shifts in 2θ values owing to interactions and bonding between the two during synthesis. With the introduction of Bi4O5I2, i.e., ternary junction g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 (CBTB), the peaks of Bi4O5I2 are also observed with slight shifts in some peaks of three semiconductors due to interfacial interactions during slow hydrothermal treatment. Some peaks for Bi4O5I2 are not observed in CBTB-20 owing to low content which are visibly improved in CBTB-30 having higher content of Bi4O5I2. The characteristic peaks for g-C3N4 are still observed in ternary junction confirming the formation of g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2. The (001) plane of the g-C3N4 gets overlapped with the peak for Bi4Ti3O12 as can be observed from XRD pattern for BT. So the peak can represent the diffraction peak for both g-C3N4 and BT and intensity difference cannot be thus compared to the (002) peak. The (002) peak intensity is lower in the heterojunction as compared to bare CN because introduction of BT and BI may restrict pure CN crystal growth [37]. 3.1.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis XPS analysis was performed for studying the valence states and chemical composition of as synthesized catalysts. Figure S2 shows the survey scan spectrum for CBTB-30 photocatalyst showing the peaks for Bi, I, O, Ti, C and N elements. The high resolution Bi 4f spectrum (Fig. 3 a) shows two deconvoluted peaks at 159.4 and 164.7 eV corresponding to Bi 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 respectively with a typical 5.3 eV gap [38] for Bi3+ present in Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2. However the spectrum is asymmetric, which implies that more than one oxidation state or chemical state for Bi is present in the heterojunction. The spectrum is thus split into two doublets corresponding to Bi3+ and Bi5+ oxidation states. The peaks at higher binding energies of 159.9 eV and 165.3 eV correspond to Bi (V) state [39]. This is due to fact that kinetic energy of outgoing photoelectrons for Bi(V) is lesser than for Bi(III) because of former’s higher coulomb interaction. As observed in XRD, minor phase of other iodide deficient Bi3O5I2 is present along with Bi4O5I2, which contains Bi3+ and Bi5+ oxidation states [36]. The oxygen vacancies present in the material also lead to hopping of the valence states which leads to variable Bi and I oxidation states as confirmed from splitting of the XPS spectra. The deconvoluted I 3d spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows two characteristic peaks 617.21 eV and 628.92 eV corresponding to I 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 respectively from I− ions. In addition the peaks split to give two doublets with peaks at 617.91 eV and 629.61 eV from I3 − ions arising due to photo-oxidation of I− ions [40]. Fig. 3(c) shows the O 1s spectrum fitted into three peaks at 529.23 eV and 530.69 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen from Bi-O and Ti-O respectively [38] and at higher B.E of 534.39 eV refers to adsorbed oxygen i.e –OH groups. The high resolution Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d) shows peak at 466.5 eV which arises by hybridization of Ti 2p1/2 and Bi 4d3/2 [41]. The peaks at 458.8 eV and 463.1 eV are assigned to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 respectively for Ti4+ [42]. The C 1s spectrum displayed in Fig. 3 (e) shows two peaks for g-C3N4. The two deconvoluted peaks at 283.58 and 286.54 eV are ascribed to sp2 C of graphitic structure and N–C = N respectively for g-C3N4. The high resolution N 1s spectrum (Fig. 3e) shows three peaks at 396.74, 397.37 and 398.13 eV referring to Fig. 3(d) sp2 N of triazine rings in graphitic structure (C = N-C), tertiary N and C-N-H groups respectively. It has been reported earlier too that surface charge densities gets altered by electron transfer at the semiconductor interfaces along Fermi levels in heterojunctions, which in turn shifts the binding [43]. It is observed that B.E of C 1s shifts towards slightly lower energies in BCBT catalyst as compared to bare g-C3N4 as reported in literature [44] and for Bi 4f towards higher binding energy [45]. This hints at the movement of electrons from g-C3N4 towards Bi4Ti3O12 or Bi4O5I2 i.e from higher Fermi level towards lower. Thus the positive and negative shifts observed in all of the semiconductors, infers that there is mutual electron transfers along the interfaces confirming the formation of intimately coupled heterojunction. To analyze the electron transfer mechanism or electron density change in the BCBT-30 heterojunction the in situ XPS detection under 500 W Xe lamp irradiation (visible light) in accordance with earlier reported work [46]. Figure S2 shows the in-situ XPS scan and fitted spectra fir BCBT-30. The details are discussed in subsequent section. 3.1.3 Morphology and microstructural analysis The SEM images of bare g-C3N4 (sheet like), Bi4O5I2 (spherical) and Bi4Ti3O12 (flower shaped) showing their morphologies are provided in Figure S3. Fig. 4 (a) presents low resolution SEM micrograph for CBTB-30 photocatalyst. It shows that spherical and flower like nanoparticles are uniformly distributed onto g-C3N4 sheet. The smooth spherical particles represent Bi4Ti3O12 and flower like particles with lamellar surface represents Bi4O5I2. The morphology of the three moieties is not much impacted on the formation of the junction. The intimate contact of Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 with each other and g-C3N4 rough aggregated stacked sheets is further visible in high resolution image in Fig. 4(b). Also the surface of the junction can closely be seen in Fig. 4(c) with smooth, lamellar and rough morphologies of moieties clearly observed. Besides this, Fig. 4(d–j) shows the spatial elemental distribution of constituent elements (C, N, Bi, O, Ti and I) in CBTB-30 catalyst. Moreover, Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of BCBT-30 heterojunction at different magnifications. The low resolution images (Fig. 5a-b) shows the spherical and flower like Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 nanoparticles distributed smoothly over the carbon nitride matrix. This can be further closely and clearly observed in high resolution image (Fig. 5c). The lattice fringes for Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 observed in HRTEM image shown in Fig. 5(d) are in accordance with XRD measurements and also confirm the intimate contact in ternary heterojunction. 3.1.4 Optical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical response The UV-DRS was used to assess the optical absorption potential of as synthesized photocatalysts and recorded in Fig. 5(a). With a typical absorption edge near 450 nm [47] g-C3N4 shows a considerably high visible photoactivity. On the other hand Bi4Ti3O2 (BT) absorbs less in visible region with absorption edge of ∼420 nm. The absorption potential for Bi4Ti3O12 is improved considerably on formation of binary junction with g-C3N4 (CBT-40). Bi4O5I2 with a higher visible absorption capacity increases induces red shift and thus the ternary heterojunction (CBTB-30) shows high visible light absorption as compared to binary junction. The band gaps were obtained using Kubelka-Munk plots (Fig. 5b). The band gap energies (Eg) for g-C3N4, Bi4O5I2 and Bi4Ti3O12 are 2.70, 2.66 and 2.90 eV respectively. The dual Z-scheme heterojunction formed performs better in visible light than g-C3N4, Bi4Ti3O12 and g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12. The ternary junction has ability to better utilize visible light for simultaneous pollutant degradation and hydrogen production. The energy levels i.e valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) position are calculated by relation: (1) ECB = EVB −Eg Where, ECB, EVB, and Eg refers to CB, VB potential and bandgap energy in eV respectively. The conduction band energy levels are calculated by calculating Flat band (FB) potentials using Mott-Schottky equation: (2) 1 C 2 = 2 E a p p - E f b - k t e N D ε ε o e A 2 Where, ND is donor density, T is absolute temperature, k is Boltzmann constant, Efb is flat band potential, e is electronic charge, ND, ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of material and in vacuum. The flat-band (EFB) potentials of g-C3N4, Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 were calculated to be −0.82 V, 0.5 V vs. NHE and -0.20 V vs. NHE. Considering the fact that the conduction band edge for a n-type semiconductor is 0.1−0.2 eV below the flat band [48]. In our case, we considered it as 0.2 eV. Thus, the CB edges (ECB) for g-C3N4, Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 are calculated as -1.02 eV, 0.3 eV, and -0.40 eV vs NHE. The valence band energy (EVB) was calculated as 1.58 eV, 3.2 eV, and 2.50 eV for g-C3N4, Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 respectively. For comparing the charge transfer resistance of g-C3N4, Bi4Ti3O12, Bi4O5I2, CBT-40 and CBTB-30, EIS Nyquist plots were obtained under open circuit voltage in dark (Fig. 6 d). The arc radius for BCBT-30 junction is smaller than that of single and binary catalysts. The semicircle radius in the Nyquist plots shows the electron transfer resistance, and the material with lowest radius exhibits highest charge transfer capacity. The results clearly indicate that formation of binary junction g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 (CBT) shrinks the radius which means the electron transfer efficiency is improved. This further improves, with introduction of Bi4O5I2 to form ternary heterojunction (CBTB) because of effective electron transfers at the two semiconductor interfaces. Further, transient photocurrent response under visible light was performed for single, binary and ternary catalysts and results are shown in Fig. 6(e). Bi4Ti3O12 shows very low photocurrent because of its high band gap. Apparently, CBTB-30 shows highest photocurrent response, better than the binary junction CBT and the single semiconductors. The higher photocurrent density for BTB-30 can be attributed to high visible light absorption, enhanced charge flow and separation [49]. The compatible band structure with two intimately contacted interfaces, facilitates higher electron transfer capacity and diminishes the recombination to a great extent. Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was further performed to test involved excitonic processes and charge separation efficiency. Fig. 6(f) shows that ternary heterojunction CBTB-30 shows poor PL intensity with almost flattened curve. This indicates that the electron-hole recombination is markedly reduced on the formation of heterojunction. Meanwhile, g-C3N4 shows highest PL intensity owing to highest recombination because of low band gap. On formation of binary junction the CBT the recombination is reduced because of rightly placed energy bands for charge transfer and separation. This is further improved for ternary heterojunction, by efficient charge transfer at two interfaces facilitated by Bi3+/Bi5+ and I−/I3 − redox mediators."
11,Photocatalytic H2 evolution and simultaneous antibiotic removal,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution and simultaneous antibiotic removal 3.2.1 Optimization of semiconductor ratios Photocatalytic H2 evolution and antibiotic removal (SDZ and OFL) activity of the synthesized materials was evaluated under visible light. Firstly, the best sample was selected by optimizing the ratios of the semiconductors in the binary g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 (CBT) and g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 (CBTB) junctions. Figure S4 and Fig. 7 (a) shows the degradation of OFL under visible light. Bi4Ti3O12 (BT) shows poor 25.5 % OFL removal in 90 min owing to its high band gap while g-C3N4 (51.7 %) and Bi4O5I2 (64.2 %) shows better performance. With addition of g-C3N4 to BT, binary heterojunction CBT is formed which improves the visible light performance of BT. CBT-10 shows 31.2 % OFL removal which increases to 70.2 % in 40 wt% g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12 (CBT-40). This is due to the increased visible light absorption and effective heterojunction formation with high electron transfer. On very high content of g-C3N4 (CN) the degradation falls, because redundant carbon nitride at higher contents may increase recombination rate. Thus CBT-40 is the best performing binary heterojunction and this was further used to prepare ternary heterojunction g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 (CBTB) with variable content of low band gap Bi4O5I2 (20 wt%, 30 wt% and 40 wt%). The CBTB-20 sample shows 88.2 % OFL degradation in 90 min, which improves to 95.7 % for CBTB-30. The OFL degradation follows pseudo-first order kinetics as shown in Fig. 7(b). The order of apparent rate constants is: CBTB-30 (0.06342 min−1) > BI (0.04842 min−1) > CBT-40 (0.04521 min−1) > CN (0.02214 min−1) > BT (0.01122 min−1). Thus the degradation rate of OFL for CBTB-30 is nearly 6 times that of bare BT and 3 times CN. At optimized pH = 5 (for OFL degradation and H2 production) degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) was also tested (Figure S5) and 77.1 % removal was achieved. 3.2.2 Photocatalytic experiments results Photocatalytic activity was tested for independent photocatalytic pollutant degradation, H2 evolution and simultaneous antibiotic removal and hydrogen production. Fig. 7(c) shows the time profile of H2 production under visible light for 3 h exposure with no sacrificial agents. Bi4Ti3O12 shows negligible H2 evolution which increases to 12.2 mmol g−1 for CBT-20. The cumulative photocatalytic hydrogen evolution per hour exhibited in Fig. 7(d) shows the following performance order: CBTB-30 (24.12 mmol g−1 h−1) > CBT-40 (12.02 mmol g−1 h−1) > CN (9.33 mmol g−1 h−1) > BI (6.67 mmol g−1 h−1) > BT (0.3 mmol g−1 h−1). The ternary heterojunction shows a considerably high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution without use of any co-catalyst and noble metal. With the formation of binary heterojunction g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12, the hydrogen evolution is improved because of high electron transfer along the interfaces and reduction in recombination. This is further improved two times for ternary heterojunction g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 because of high electron transfer capacity, charge separation and high visible light activity. This is supported by EIS, transient PCR and PL measurements. We also tested the O2 evolution in absence of any sacrificial agents (Figure S6). Using CBTB-30 and 2%Pt@CBTB-30, 8.1 and 41.2 mmol g−1 h−1 of O2 evolution was observed. The O2 evolution in comparison to H2 production was lower. Furthermore the photocatalytic activity under visible light for the set of photocatalysts was also tested in the solution containing ofloxacin and sulfadiazine pollutants. Fig. 7(d) and (e) shows the photocatalytic hydrogen production in combination with OFL and SDZ degradation respectively. As shown in Fig. 7(e), 87.1 % OFL was removed in 90 min with CBTB-30 along with 56.22 mmol g-1 h−1 H2 evolution simultaneously. The H2 production with CBTB-30 is much higher than g-C3N4 (17.2 mmol g-1 h−1) and 46.3 % OFL removal. Thus a simultaneous antibiotic photodegradation and hydrogen evolution is achieved. It is also observed that under simultaneous process, the antibiotic degradation shows fall from 95.7%–87.1% with CBTB-30, but the H2evolution increases sharply from 24.12 mmol g−1 h−1 to 56.22 mmol g-1 h−1. The fall in OFL degradation is not high enough i.e nearly 6%. The AQE for various photocatalysts for simultaneous OFL degradation and H2 production (at 420 nm) were measured and listed in Table S1. The AQE for CBTB-30 photocatalyst improves from 7.8 % without any sacrificial agent to 23.1 % under simultaneous OFL degradation + H2 production. This shows superior photon energy conversion efficiency due to effective generation and separation of electron-hole pairs. The H2 evolution experiment was performed with SDZ as sacrificial agent and target pollutant (Fig. 7f). With 68.4 % SDZ removal in 90 min, CBTB-30 also shows 30.3 mmol g−1 h−1 H2 evolution simultaneously followed by 17.1 mmol g-1 h−1 with CBT-40. The lower H2 evolution with SDZ as compared to OFL, shows that photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is affected by the choice of pollutants as artificial agents. The use of OFL as sacrificial agents enhance the hydrogen evolution which is attributed to scavenging of photogenerated holes directly or indirectly by hydroxyl radicals by undergoing degradation. This leaves the photogenerated electrons available for hydrogen evolution. The presence of hole sacrificial agents can enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production [50]. This has been explained in detail in subsequent sections. The high photocatalytic activity of the ternary heterojunction CBTB-30 is due to effective dual-Z scheme transfer which facilitates rapid charge transfer, charge separations, high visible activity and retaining of high potential VB and CB for pollutant degradation and hydrogen production simultaneously. Although the concentration of antibiotics decreases with irradiation time, the H2 evolution doesn’t fall and increases instead. First reason is that the degradation intermediates are further degraded as can be observed from TOC removal (it decreases gradually in prolonged reaction time). These intermediates offer electrons for hydrogen evolution [51]. Also, during continuous oxidation and mineralization process the aliphatic low molecular weight molecules are formed like acetaldehyde, acetic acid, ethanol, formic acid etc. which are more ideal as sacrificial agents for hydrogen production because of their negative redox potentials [52]. In addition, the high charge separation obtained in BCBT photocatalyst by dual Z-scheme transfer facilitated by I3-/I- and Bi3+/Bi5+ redox mediators. The separated high potential photogenerated electrons are always available for H2 evolution [53]. Thus we achieve higher hydrogen evolution even as the time passes. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction parameters and sacrificial agents The photocatalyst dose (CBTB-30) was first optimized for antibiotic degradation under visible light. Figure S7 shows that the optimum dose of CBTB-30 photocatalyst for OFL degradation was found to be 0.4 g L−1. At very low dose, lesser number of active or reaction sites is available which limits the photocatalytic performance. At very high catalyst amount, degradation again rate falls because of turbidity, light scattering by unused photocatalyst particles which leads to hindrance to further exposure. The optimization of reaction pH is very important for hydrogen evolution and antibiotic degradation. So we need to consider the behavior of the drugs at the working pH. The pzc (pH at point of zero charge) for CBTB-30 catalyst is found to be 4 which is quite consistent with similar materials [54]. The pKa values for OFL are 5.97 (for carboxylic group) and 9.28 (piperizinyl ring). Fig. 8 (a) shows that the degradation of OFL is highest at pH = 5 and is poor in alkaline medium. At pH = 5, the OFL is positively charged or protonated (pH < 5.97) and catalyst surface is negatively charged (pH > 4), so electrostatic interactions between photocatalyst and OFL are strong. This leads to better adsorption and hence faster degradation. The CBTB-30 heterojunction possesses negative charge at alkaline pH, which limits the adsorption of OH− ions because of repulsions, which decreases the production of OH radicals. Also, in basic medium, the CO2 from the air gets converted into HCO3 - ions [55], which quenches OH radicals and form lesser reactive CO3-. The hydrogen production is always high at acidic pH which is reflected in the results shown in Fig. 8(b). At pH = 3, CBTB-30 shows 91.2 mmol g−1 H2 evolution in 3 h followed by pH = 5 (72.36 mmol g−1). However, considering the simultaneous OFL degradation and H2 evolution and reducing the leaching of photocatalyst at very acidic conditions, optimum pH = 5 was selected for the experiments. At pH = 5, the OFL degradation is the highest and the H2 production is high enough. Let’s consider SDZ as target pollutant and sacrificial agent during hydrogen production. The SDZ degradation is also highest at pH = 5 because of its pKa value of 6.36. At pH = 5 (pH < pKa), the drug is positively charged and CBTB-30 catalyst is negatively charged, facilitating adsorption, and thus faster degradation. For all the combined experiments the feasible pH = 5 is chosen. On the other hand we also tested the OFL degradation with CBTB-30 in presence of some common electrolytes (Figure S8). As far as cations are considered, Na+ ions have no effect on degradation while Ca2+ ions decrease the reaction rate because they have tendency to form complexes with organic molecules with high functionality. Among anions, Cl− ions show a little detrimental effect (0.06182 min-1) as they tend to get adsorbed onto photocatalyst but not have high capacity to scavenge hydroxyl radicals. Other anions have a detrimental effect on the OFL degradation rate in the order SO4 2- > HCO3 − > NO3 −. The HCO3 − ions decrease the degradation rate because they scavenge OH radicals to produce lesser active oxidant CO3-. With addition of NO3 − ions, the OFL degradation is decreased pronouncedly, as these ions compete with the pollutant and effect the interactions of OFL with the catalyst. The SO4 2- ions further reduce the degradation capacity of CBTB-30 photocatalyst because they get adsorbed onto catalyst, and because of high negative charge they repel the drug molecules. In addition, they also scavenge the reactive oxygen species. From the experiments reported above, we have already found that sacrificial agents in form of pollutants have led to increase in the photocatalytic hydrogen production manifolds. Such observations are also observed in other reported experiments [56]. To further confirm, we used rhodamine B(RhB) and triethanolamine (TEOA) were used as sacrificial agents and results are compared in Fig. 8(c). The order of hydrogen production is TEOA (69 mmol g−1 h−1) > OFL (56.22 mmol g−1 h−1) > SDZ (30.3 mmol g−1 h−1) > RhB (27.15 mmol g−1 h−1) > H2O (24.12 mmol g−1 h−1). In presence of rhodamine B (RhB), the H2 evolution is lower than OFL and SDZ. The pKa value for RhB is 3.7 and at pH = 5 the dye molecule is in anionic form. The catalyst CBTB is negatively charged leading to poor interactions with the pollutant and thus RhB is not capable to scavenge enough number of holes. Thus hydrogen evolution is less in this case as conditions are not conducive to photodegradation of pollutant. On the other hand, the TEOA improves the hydrogen production dramatically because the lone pairs in the molecule are more prone to holes attack. These photogenerated electrons are thus separated and available for hydrogen evolution by water splitting. Further the simultaneous H2 evolution and OFL removal was tested in visible and solar light with CBTB-30 and 2%Pt@CBTB-30 photocatalysts. The results are shown in Fig. 8(d). When 2%Pt@CBTB-30 was used as photocatalyst the H2 evolution was improved to 92.22 mmol g−1 h−1 with 90.1 % OFL degradation respectively. The presence of Pt as co-catalyst increases the H2 evolution and pollutant degradation because the amino groups in g-C3N4 and hydroxyl groups in BT and BI act as coordinating centers for rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons to Pt. This enhances the hydrogen evolution. The Pt modified sample also increases the conductivity of the photocatalyst. Under solar light CBTB-30 shows 40.1 mmol g−1 h−1 H2 evolution + 68.2 % OFL removal. This increases to 70.2 mmol g−1 h−1 H2 production + 74.2 % OFL degradation with 2%Pt@CBTB-30 catalyst. Obviously with Pt as co-catalyst the H2 evolution shows significant increase, but without any co-catalyst CBTB-30 photocatalyst is capable of high performance removal of pollutants coupled with significant H2 evolution under visible and solar light. 3.2.4 Antibiotic degradation pathway The possible degradation pathway for OFL and SDZ photocatalytic degradation with CBTB-30 was predicted on basis of reaction intermediates and degradation products by LC-MS. The degradation intermediates are listed in Table S2 and S3. Scheme 1 shows the degradation route of OFL. In the first typical route the attack by OH radicals leads to hydroxylation of reactive piperzine ring to form P2 (m/z = 376). The hydroxylation of piperizine ring and further CC bond cleavage (containing N and O) leads to formation of P1 (m/z = 334). OFL was also oxidized with piperazine ring opening to form P7 (m/z = 392) followed by N-dealkylation to form P9 (m/z = 378). The removal of keto (CO) group forms P5 (m/z = 350). P9 (m/z = 378) product further undergoes dihydroxylation and CC bond cleavage to produce P8 (m/z = 318) which after piperizine ring opening forms P11 (m/z = 275). The dealkylation of P11 further forms P13 (m/z = 233) which after ring opening leads to formation of P15 (m/z = 169). The degradation intermediates detected are in accordance with previously reported works [57,58]. The further oxidation of P15 forms oximes as P17 (m/z = 132) and P 18 (m/z = 90) which further degrade to simpler aliphatic molecules and mineralize later. The reaction intermediates for SDZ photodegradation by CBTB-30 were detected by LC-MS and a suitable degradation mechanism was predicted (Scheme 2 ). In first step, the hydroxylation of reactive amino group forms intermediate S1 (m/z = 203). Further the Cleavage of CN bond in the pyrimidine ring leads to formation of two products S2 (m/z = 173) and S3 (m/z = 233). With the S-N cleavage, S4 (m/z = 176) and pyrimidin-2-amine i.e S5 (m/z = 96) are formed. Further attack by hydroxyl radicals transform S5 into 2-aminopyrimidin-5-ol i.e S7 (m/z = 109). Also, the hydrolysis of sulfonamide group forms simple molecules as S11 (m/z = 109). The nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl radicals on the C atoms which are adjacent to S (more liable), leads to SC bond cleavage, yielding sulfamic acid and aniline. The intermediate S6 (m/z = 146) loses SO2 molecule to form aniline. Further oxidations and cleavages lead to mineralization in the longer run. The intermediates detected in SDZ degradation are in agreement with literature [59]. The degradation pathway was predicted with LC-MS results. Further mineralization was ascertained by total organic carbon analysis (Figure S9). During the 3 h experiment of simultaneous H2 production and OFL degradation with CBTB-30 catalyst, 80.4 % and 68.3 % TOC removal was achieved under visible light and solar light. This confirms the mineralization of antibiotics in the longer run of experiment. 3.2.5 Aerobic & anaerobic medium performance and photocatalytic mechanism We conducted the photocatalytic antibiotic degradation and simultaneous H2 evolution in an anaerobic condition. The exact mechanism of this coupled performance is well explained if we analyze the performance and possible chemistry involved in oxic and anoxic conditions. Figure S10 shows the photocatalytic OFL degradation and H2 evolution in water with sufficient dissolved oxygen, i.e., under oxic conditions. Under aerated condition, ∼100 % degradation in 60 min visible light irradiation with 29.4 mmol g−1 h−1 H2 evolution is achieved with CBTB-30 photocatalyst. Even under oxic medium enough high hydrogen evolution is achieved. The details are discussed subsequently. The basic photocatalytic mechanism involved in the coupled or simultaneous antibiotic removal and H2 production is the direct oxidation of antibiotic by photogenerated holes and evolution of hydrogen by attack of photogenerated electrons on H2O molecules. This can be seen in Scheme 3 . This is a synchronized mechanism where the pollutant acts as a sacrificial agent via oxidation from holes directly and hydroxyl radicals indirectly. To have an insight into the photocatalytic mechanism involved in simultaneous H2 evolution and antibiotic degradation scavenging experiments, ESR probe and band structure were researched. Fig. 10(a) shows the effect of scavengers onto OFL degradation under visible light with CBTB-30 photocatalyst (anaerobic conditions). In absence of any scavenging agent, the degradation of OFL is 95.7 % which reduces to 32.1 % with EDTA and 40.2 % with IPA. This indicates that holes and OH radicals play a major role in the OFL photo-degradation. However little effect is observed with BQ suggesting that amount of O2 − radicals formed is not satisfactory and this is expected as conditions are anaerobic. However scavenging experiments for H2 production + OFL degradation under dissolved oxygen condition or aerated environment (Figure S11a) show that O2 − radicals are present and participate in the OFL degradation. The presence is high in aerated then de-aerated conditions. So under anoxic conditions h+ and OH radicals are active for OFL degradation and e−/H2O route is responsible for H2 production as observed in related works [60]. The mechanism can also be supported from the degradation intermediates or the pathway. The OFL degradation intermediates show that the molecular ion peak is observed at m/Z = 362 [M+H+]. The intermediates ate m/Z = 334 and 348 formed by direct oxidation by holes. The mechanism shows that no electrons were consumed in the degradation mechanism. The separation of photogenerated electrons and holes by dual Z-scheme transfer facilitates the simultaneous degradation and hydrogen evolution. The antibiotic plays a similar role as conventional sacrificial agents. However this not only degrades the pollutant but also reduces the economic cost of photocatalytic hydrogen production [61]. The route H+/e− route cannot be completely ruled out as solution is slightly acidic and thus some contribution is there even under anaerobic medium. In addition to this, additionally, a new route for high H2 evolution from OFL can be predicted. As visible in degradation mechanism of OFL an oxime, i.e., P17 is formed which can be coordinated to the Ti4+ where intermolecular H+ transfer can occur via a cyclic intermediated which leads to formation of hydrogen (Scheme 4 ). Such kind of observation was reported earlier [62]. Therefore, the H2 evolution is augmented during OFL degradation. As explained earlier, as the antibiotic degradation proceeds with time the smaller molecular weight reaction intermediates appear which are better electron donors or sacrificial agents and further accelerates the hydrogen evolution. In addition, the evolution of hydrogen during the degradation of the antibiotic can’t also be ruled out (as discussed above). Under aerobic or dissolved oxygen conditions (Scheme 3) the photogenerated electrons from photocatalyst get transferred to O2 to form O2 −. However, the molecular oxygen reacts slowly with electrons as compared to h+/H2O or h+/OH- reaction. Thus electron transfer to O2 is the rate controlling step [52]. So, high dissolved oxygen will surely favor higher photocatalytic oxidation of pollutants. This is manifested in the higher and faster OFL removal in aerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions there are two steps- dissolved oxygen consuming i.e aerobic phase (OFL degradation) and dissolved oxygen consumed, i.e., anoxic phase (H2 production). The reactions involved are shown in Scheme 3. However the H2 production is lower than the anoxic conditions because presence of oxygen does not favor hydrogen evolution. When compared to the anaerobic conditions two reactions compete in aerobic phase- electron transfer to oxygen and electron transfer to H+ or H2O. This is responsible for lower hydrogen yield. But the decrease is not too high and photocatalyst CTBT-30 is capable of producing hydrogen and antibiotic degradation in aerated conditions too. The validation of active oxygen species for sole OFL photodegradation (oxic) was done with the ESR spin trapping experiments for detecting the spectra for DMPO trapped OH and O2 − generated during photocatalytic reaction under visible light with CBTB-30 after 10 min. Fig. 10(c) shows the ESR spectra for DMPO- OH under dark and visible light conditions. There is no peak observed in dark but strong characteristic 1:2:2:1 quadruple for OH radicals was obtained confirming the presence of hydroxyl radicals. A weaker characteristic signal for DMPO- O2 − adduct was obtained in light. The stronger ESR signal for OH radicals suggest that they are the main active species involved in OFL degradation. This is also supported by radical scavenging experiments. As known, photogenerated holes are the mainly responsible for formation of OH radicals, thus most of holes are utilized by the antibiotic to undergo degradation and simultaneously photogenerated electrons bring about the H2 evolution. However to ascertain this fact the scavenging experiments (Figure S8a) ERS spectra of DMPO- O2 − and DMPO- OH (Figure S11b) obtained during coupled OFL degradation and H2 evolution under anaerobic conditions were obtained. The scavenging experiments show that in presence of BQ no fall in rate is observed indicating no role of O2 −. It can also be observed that photogenerated holes are major active species with some contribution from OH radicals. The spectra exhibited medium intensity signal for hydroxyl radicals and no signal for O2 − which is obvious in the anaerobic conditions. This also supports that photogenerated electrons could be utilized for hydrogen evolution. The predicted mechanism for simultaneous process is thus supported and that electrons are consumed for hydrogen production and holes for OFL oxidation. Fig. 9 shows the band structure of the junction showing the possible charge carrier movements and transfers under visible light irradiation. When contact is formed, due to differences in the Fermi energy levels charge carriers diffuse and an internal electric field is developed which facilitates the migration during exposure. Even after analyzing the possible charge flow in band structure, further evidences as scavenging and ESR probe results are required to analyze the photocatalytic mechanism [63]. Herein we discuss the band structure in light of scavenging and ESR probe results. Considering the conventional double charge transfer at the two interfaces (Fig. 9a), the performance and feasibility was analyzed. According to double charge transfer, the electrons from CB of g-C3N4 (-1.02 eV) and that of Bi4O5I2 (-0.40 eV) migrate to CB of Bi4Ti3O12 (0.3 eV). The holes from VB of Bi4Ti3O12 (3.2 eV) migrates to that of g-C3N4 (1.58 eV) and Bi4O5I2 (1.66 eV). This enables the charge separation at the two interfaces. However when the electrons accumulate at CB of Bi4Ti3O12 where they lose the potential for producing O2 − from O2 i.e Eo (O2/ O2 −) = -0.33 eV. Thus feasibility of generation of O2 − is quite low. Considering the movement of holes, they accumulate in VB of g-C3N4 and Bi4O5I2. The holes don’t have high enough potential to oxidize water into OH radicals i.e E ( OH/H2O) is 2.27 eV vs NHE. In addition, the generation of hydroxyl radicals is not feasible via –OH route too because of two possible reasons- the holes have lesser positive potential than (E OH/−OH =1.99 eV) vs NHE and the reaction pH is 5 which is slightly acidic and doesn’t favor the presence of hydroxyl ions. The CB potential of BT is +0.30 eV is more positive than the standard reduction potential for H2 evolution i.e Eo (H+/H2) =0.00 eV. The hydrogen evolution thus cannot be achieved. However some extent of hydrogen can be produced via remaining electrons in the CB of other two semiconductors or via Fe3O4 which also produces the electrons under visible light., Thus in the conventional double charge transfer scheme neither the hydrogen evolution to a high extent nor the degradation of antibiotics can be justified. The high performance can be discussed in light of possible dual Z-scheme transfer as shown in Fig. 9(b). In the ternary heterojunction g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2, due to close potentials and intrinsic electric field developed at interfaces, Z-scheme transfer is feasible. The CB potential of Bi4Ti3O12 (+0.30 eV) is close to VB of g-C3N4 (+1.58 eV) and Bi4O5I2 (+1.66 eV), thereby the electrons from CB of BT can rapidly transfer to valence bands of g-C3N4 and Bi4O5I2. Thus the photogenerated electrons are accumulated in the high negative potential conduction bands of g-C3N4 and Bi4O5I2 which increase the H2 evolution efficiency. Especially the CB of g-C3N4 has high negative potential for producing hydrogen by 2e−/2H2O route. The holes in the highly positive VB of Bi4Ti3O12 (3.2 eV), have high capability to oxidize H2O into hydroxyl radicals which degrade the pollutants. Under the anoxic conditions obviously no O2 − radicals could be formed, and the observations from other experiments predict that the separated photogenerated electrons (g-C3N4 CB) produce H2 via e-/H2O route. However, the route e−/H+ is also possible and cannot be ruled out completely. During presence of DO i.e oxic conditions, the formation of O2 − is possible and so degradation rate of OFL increases and that of H2 production falls to a small extent. The in-situ XPS results (Figure S2) were analyzed for supporting and validating the dual Z-scheme transfer mechanism. The shifts in binding energies are indicator of the changes in electron density [46]. The binding energy for Ti 2p is increased by 0.21 eV on irradiation indicating that the electron density on Bi4Ti3O12 is reduced. Also, the binding energy of C1 s (for N-C = N peak) decreased by 0.15 eV and for I 3d5/2 is reduced by 0.18 eV suggesting the electron density increases in g-C3N4 and Bi4O5I2. Thus the changes in binding energies on irradiation provide a direct evidence for dual Z-scheme transfer. As reported earlier the use or presence of Z-scheme bride or redox mediators is highly beneficial for an effective and faster Z-scheme transfer and separation. Metals as metallic Ag, Au and Bi have been utilized as bridges in Z-scheme transfers. Various redox mediators as Fe2+/Fe3+, Ce4+/Ce3+, I3 −/I− have acted as redox mediators in various Z-schemes [11,64,65]. In the CBTB ternary heterojunction, the Bi 4f XPS spectra exhibited the peaks for both Bi3+ and Bi5+ oxidation states. Thus a Bi3+/Bi5+ redox mediator exists in the photocatalytic system. The I 3d XPS spectrum was also not symmetrical and split into doublets corresponding to I− and I3 −. The I3 − ions may be formed by oxidation of I− during the synthesis process of the ternary heterojunction. Thus, it indicates that the two redox mediators Bi3+/Bi5+ and I3 −/I− are instrumental in the effective Z-scheme transfer for high performance photocatalytic H2 evolution and antibiotic degradation simultaneously. The dual Z-scheme transfer under does by following routes Bi4Ti3O12→I3 −/I−→g-C3N4; Bi4Ti3O12→I3 −/I−→Bi4O5I2; Bi4Ti3O12→Bi5+/Bi3+→g-C3N4; Bi4Ti3O12→Bi5+/Bi3+→g-C3N4. If we consider the double charge transfer mechanism then we could only achieve antibiotic degradation but not the hydrogen evolution. Thus the larger charge separation, transfer and high photodegradation of pollutants in combination with the H2 evolution can be explained on basis of the dual Z-scheme. In addition the high performance as compared to the binary junction was more suitable attributed to the Bi5+/Bi3+ and I3 −/I− redox mediator facilitated Z-scheme transfer. The I3 −/I− redox mediators works in two ways which are beneficial for both H2 evolution and antibiotic degradation. As shown in Scheme 5 , the iodide ions get oxidized by holes to produce I3 − to keep the photogenerated electrons available in the high potential conduction bands for H2 evolution. On the other hand the I3 − ions facilitate the Z-scheme on the interfaces by capturing the electrons from CB of Bi4Ti3O12 and get converted into I− and then transfers to the VB of g-C3N4 and Bi4O5I2 via redox cycle. I3 − and IO3 − could co-exist in the system where the latter is oxidized by holes via –OH ions. However as the working pH is between 5–9, hence possibility of both I3 −/I− and IO3 −/I- redox mediator is there [66]. The IO3 − has higher electron accepting capability than I3 − in general, but the pH = 5 was optimized according to the best performance of possibility of high H2 evolution and antibiotic degradation. Thus the mixed presence of IO3 − and I3 − redox mediators enhance the transfer and photocatalytic performance. The similar effect is shown by Bi5+/Bi3+ redox mediator. Importantly, in the dual Z-scheme the photogenerated electrons and holes accumulated in the protected high potential bands bring about the H2 evolution and antibiotic degradation simultaneously under viable light and natural solar light. The high electron transfer capacity, reduced recombination and high photo-efficiency of the ternary CBTB photocatalyst was supported by EIS, PCR and PL measurements. The holes abstracted directly by the pollutant and water to form OH radicals lead to rapid H2 evolution by photogenerated electrons. The matchable band structures of g-C3N4, Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi4O5I2 allow a double Z-scheme transfer with dual capabilities of simultaneous H2 evolution and pollutant degradation (OFL, SDZ, RhB in this case). In addition, the redox Bi5+/Bi3+, I3 −/I− or IO3 −/I− mediators facilitate the faster Z-scheme transfer with higher charge separation. The double Z-scheme CBTB photocatalyst has high visible light capacity, strong redox capability, excellent charge separation and in-built redox mediators. The redox reactions possible in the dual Z-scheme junction with protected higher redox potentials are capable of degradation, mineralization in the longer run of experiment [67]."
12,"Reusability, stability analysis and environmental implications","3.3 Reusability, stability analysis and environmental implications The repeatability and photostability are the key factors and of the photocatalyst is a key factor in assessing the performance of the photocatalyst for practical applications. Thus consecutive cycle tests were performed for four cycles of simultaneous H2 evolution and OFL degradation under visible light with CBTB-30 photocatalyst (Fig. 10d). The H2 evolution decreases slightly from 56.22 mmol g−1 h−1 to 53.02 mmol g−1 h−1 after 4 cycles. Similarly OFL degradation falls marginally from 87.1%–84.1%. The activity is almost fully retained after recovery and washing with ethanol and water. The XRD pattern of CBTB-30 before and after use (Figure S12) shows no abnormal change in the diffraction peaks suggesting the high structural stability and robustness of the catalyst. In addition, the XPS survey scan shows no noticeable changes in the peaks. Also, SEM micrograph of CBTB-30 shows that the morphology of the catalyst is retained after photocatalytic use. All in all, double Z-scheme heterojunction g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 has high stability and reusability which makes it an outstanding photocatalyst for synergistic energy production and water detoxification. Thus the pollutants behave as electron donors or sacrificial agents. Before discharge of the pharmaceutical pollutants, significant amount of antibiotics are present which can be used as sacrificial agents for the hydrogen evolution. However, it is also observed that photocatalyst is capable of producing hydrogen in water without any organic sacrificial agents. So even at lower concentrations of pollutants hydrogen evolution is feasible. In addition, the oxic conditions also do not lead to poisoning of the catalyst and hydrogen evolution is still achieved. The organic matter present in the real water systems also acts as sacrificial agents. The humic acid like substances are preferentially oxidized by reactive oxygen species which generate low molecular weight compounds as formic acid, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde etc. which are better electron donors than complex organic, molecules and thus accelerate the hydrogen production. The waste water treatment plants the methodology includes two basic steps-aerobic and anaerobic treatment. So both the steps are able to remove the pollutants and produce hydrogen evolution in a step-wise process. The ppb levels of antibiotics are detected in surface waters and water supplies. However, before the discharge of the pharmaceutical pollutants into water bodies, and before the other treatment methods involved the concentrations are still higher and this symbiotic removal of pollutants and hydrogen production is beneficial."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, we have realized the simultaneous high performance photocatalytic H2 evolution and pollutant removal via dual Z-scheme g-C3N4/Bi4Ti3O12/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction prepared by simple in-situ hydrothermal route. With the best optimized ratio of three semiconductors, the best sample CBTB-30 exhibits a 56.22 mmol g−1 h−1 H2 evolution with 87.1 % OFL degradation in 90 min at pH = 5 under visible light. Interestingly, without any pollutant the catalyst shows 24.12 mmol g−1 h-1 H2 evolution which means that, the rate of hydrogen production increases manifold during synergistic photo-reduction and oxidation. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates are higher in all the pollutants used than in water. Radical scavenging tests and ESR confirmed h+ and OH radicals played the most active role in OFL antibiotic degradation. The holes are utilized by the antibiotic to undergo photo-degradation and simultaneous photogenerated electrons reduce H+ in to H2. The synergistic H2 evolution with degradation of other pollutants as SDZ and RhB suggest that the extent of hydrogen production is dependent on the pollutant chosen as each pollutant has a separate chemistry at acidic pH. The possible degradation pathway for SDZ and OFL was also suggested according to the reaction intermediates detected by LC-MS. The photocatalytic mechanism under oxic and anoxic conditions was also analyzed according to the band structure analysis and other findings, suggesting a dual Z-scheme transfer at the two semiconductor interfaces. The double Z-scheme mechanism is facilitated or mediated by in-built redox mediators Bi5+/Bi3+ and I3 −/I− or IO3 −/I− (existence proven from Bi 4f and I 3d XPS spectrum). These redox mediators not only facilitate the Z-scheme transfer by capturing the electrons from CB of Bi4Ti3O12, but the I3 -/I- mediator also utilize some of holes for larger separation. Thus, nanostructure engineering and utilization of well-matched semiconductors were used for fabrication of a visible and solar active heterojunction, with successful demonstration of excellent H2 evolution from antibiotic waste water facilitated by Bi5+/Bi3+ and I3 −/I− redox mediators. We anticipate further possibilities for addressing more limitations in this direction and working in real waste water systems."
