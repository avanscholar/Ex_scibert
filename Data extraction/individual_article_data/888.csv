0,Introduction,"As a versatile and environmentally friendly oxidant, the demand of H2O2 for industrial and environmental applications is booming (Zhou et al., 2019). Currently, the most common method used in industrial scale to prepare H2O2 is anthraquinone oxidation (AO) progress. However, this method is not regarded as a green method due to expensive palladium catalysts, generation of substantial organic byproduct and potential dangers during the transportation and storage (Campos-Martin et al., 2006). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a green, low-cost and efficient method to synthesize H2O2. As early as last century, Berl (1939) discovered that H2O2 could be effectively generated at the cathode in electrochemical system, which was regarded as a green and cost-effective method. In the process of H2O2 electrochemical synthesis, H2O2 is generated though the 2e− pathway of ORR (Eq. (1)). (1) O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 O 2 , E o = 0.695 V vs . SHE In addition to abiotic electrochemical systems (An et al., 2019a), biological electrochemical system (BES) is considered as a more desirable approach of producing H2O2 because it can capture the energy from wastewater and thus reduce input energy consumption (Zhao et al., 2013b). BESs can be divided into two forms: microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), which require electric current input and mainly used for degradation of pollutants as well as recovery of hydrogen energy (Cecconet et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2017); and microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which are mainly used for generating electricity (Yang et al., 2020). BES is considered as an ideal approach on environmental remediation because it realizes lower carbon and energy consumption and effective wastewater treatment simultaneously (Dong et al., 2018; Wang and Ren, 2013)."
1,Mechanism of ORR,"1.1 Mechanism of ORR In order to produce H2O2 efficiently in electrochemical systems, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of ORR. The specific mechanism of ORR is schematically depicted in Fig. 1a. When oxygen molecule comes to the surface of cathodes, it will firstly form an adsorbed oxygen molecule, which is marked as O2* (where * refers a site on the surface). Then, O2* could be reduced by three ways, which is usually distinguished by the stage of the cleavage of O-O bond. In 2e− pathway of ORR, O2* is successfully reduced to OOH* and form HOOH* (H2O2) on active site before the O−O bond breaks. In direct 4e− pathway of ORR, O2 is reduced to OOH*, O*, and OH* intermediates before forming HOOH*, leading it impossible to become H2O2. In addition, the O-O bond in the formed HOOH* may still break, causing H2O2 to decompose into H2O finally (named ‘2+2 pathway’ or ‘indirect 4e− pathway’). To generate H2O2 more efficiently, it is essential to develop active electrocatalysts to improve the selectivity of 2e− pathway and avoid the occurrence of 4e− pathway (Eq. (2)) and ‘2+2 pathway’ (Eq. (3)). In previous studies, numerous noble metals and their alloys, such as Pd (Fortunato et al., 2018), Au-Pd (Menegazzo et al., 2015; Pizzutilo et al., 2017), and Pt-Hg (Siahrostami et al., 2013) show low overpotential for 2e− pathway of ORR and high H2O2 selectivity (up to 98%). However, due to scarcity, noble metal based cathodes are restricted in large-scale application. Different from noble metals, carbon materials are cheap, durable and abundant in nature, which are promising alternatives to substitute noble-metal catalysts.

2,Graphene-based catalyst for H2O2 production,"1.2 Graphene-based catalyst for H2O2 production Graphene is a flat one-atom-thick nanosheet with sp2 carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, which was first discovered by Geim and Novoselov by their famous Scotch tape method (Novoselov et al., 2004). In the narrow sense, graphene just refers to monolayer graphene sheet (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). In the broad sense, graphene is a kind of materials such as monolayer/few layers/multilayer of graphene, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and so on. Due to the difficulty in obtaining monolayer graphene, the graphene described in most literature refer to its broad sense. Recently, graphene and its derivatives have attracted great interests on promoting H2O2 production in 2e− ORR due to high specific surface area, excellent electronic conductivity, and high tunability (Chen et al., 2018; Novoselov et al., 2005). However, pristine graphene still has some drawbacks, such as poor dispersion in aqueous solution (Zhao et al., 2011), and limited molecular adsorption capacity (Rêgo et al., 2015). Therefore, various strategies have been developed for enhancing the catalytic activity of graphene, mainly including heteroatoms doping (Li et al., 2017), defect engineering (Kim et al., 2019) and constructing metal‑nitrogen-graphene (M-N-GR) type electrocatalysts (Ma et al., 2017). Among them, heteroatom doping received the most attention due to its simplicity and high efficiency. Heteroatom doping refers to incorporating heteroatoms (e.g., N, B, S, P) into the honeycomb skeleton of graphene to change the charge distribution and spin density of adjacent carbon atoms (Zhang and Xia, 2011), which activated the active site on the surface of graphene. In this review, main synthesis methods of graphene family members and graphene-based electrodes are summarized. We highlight the improvement effect of graphene modification in electrochemical systems. Some brief challenges and perspectives are also provided with the goal to develop better graphene-based catalysts."
3,Synthesis of graphene and its derivatives,"Monolayer graphene nanosheets were first successfully obtained by Geim et al. by adhering and tearing repeatedly on both sides of the graphite sheet using a particular type of tape (Novoselov et al., 2004). This gave birth to a new era of atomically 2D carbon thin materials. To date, many graphene family members, such as graphene oxide (GO), RGO, and nitrogen-doped graphene (N-GR) are widely applied for 2e− ORR (Kim et al., 2018; Su et al., 2020)."
4,Synthesis of graphene,"2.1 Synthesis of graphene As the original graphene synthesis method, micro-mechanical stripping has the advantages of simplicity in operation and high quality of harvested graphene nanosheets. However, this method is not suitable for large-scale production due to its poor controllability, uncertainty, low efficiency, and small size of prepared graphene (Cai et al., 2012). Therefore, many convenient methods have been developed to prepare graphene. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is regarded as the most promising method for graphene mass production. In CVD method, hydrocarbons such as methane and ethanol are injected into the surface of high temperature heated metal substrates (such as Cu foil and Ni film) and then cooled. During the cooling process, multilayers or monolayer graphene will be formed on the surface of the substrate (Li et al., 2009a). The advantage of CVD method is that graphene can be easily separated by chemical etching of the metal, which is conducive to the subsequent production. However, the thickness of the graphene prepared by CVD is difficult to control and only a small amount of available carbon is converted into graphene during the precipitation process. Electrochemical exfoliation (EE) method has been regarded as a green method for graphene production recently due to its single-step process, easy operation and less heteroatom contamination (Kim et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009a; Schniepp et al., 2006; Stankovich et al., 2007). EE method is generally operated in the two-electrode system by applying a constant potential to obtain graphene (Yang et al., 2017a). The concentrated graphite products (e.g., highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (Leroux et al., 2015), graphite foils (Yang et al., 2017a), graphite flakes (Parvez et al., 2014) and pencil core (Chen et al., 2017; Mousset et al., 2016a)) are used as anodes and noble electrodes (e.g., Pt sheet) used as cathodes. During electrochemical process, the anions in the electrolyte migrate to the anode and then intercalate into the gaps between graphite layers, causing the graphite expanded. When the volume of the graphite expands to a certain extent, it eventually fall off the block due to the reduction of interlayer Van der Waals force, forming few layers of mildly oxidized graphene (Leroux et al., 2015; Mousset et al., 2016a). Yang et al. (2017a) used a two-electrode cell with graphite foils as anode and Pt sheet as cathode to synthesize graphene flakes in the mixed solution of H2SO4 and KOH. This graphene flakes showed low defect density with thickness lower than 3 nm (few layers graphene). Moreover, the increase of C-OH group and the appearance of C=O group indicated that EE progress was accompanied by the oxidation of graphene. In addition, various other methods have been developed for the synthesis of graphene. Berger et al. (2006) prepared epitaxially grown graphene by evaporating silicon carbide at high temperatures in ultra-high vacuum. Del Rio-Castillo et al. (2014) obtained graphene by ball-milling exfoliation of graphitic filaments. The single-layer graphene, multi-layer graphene and unexfoliated graphite prepared by this method can be distinguished by their solubility in a particular solvent."
5,Synthesis of graphene oxide,"2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide Compared with pristine graphene, GO contains both sp2 hybridized and sp3 hybridized carbon atoms. With more oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) attached on the surface of graphene, numerous new properties are shown in GO such as preferable dispersion hydrophilicity (Pei and Cheng, 2012) and increased interaction with the polymer (Hu et al., 2014). The most widely used methods to produce GO is modified Hummers method (Alazmi et al., 2016; Becerril et al., 2008; Hummers and Offeman, 1958). In this method, graphite is oxidized in concentrated H2SO4, H3PO3 and KMnO4 to intersperse some OFGs between the graphite layers and increase the spacing of graphite layer. After oxidation, additional H2O2 and HCl are added into GO solution to remove residual oxidant from the suspension. Though the GO synthesized by modified Hummers exhibits high degree of oxidation, there still exists some challenges like relatively complex synthesis process and subsequent multiple filtration and washing of synthesized GO for metal impurities removal (Kim et al., 2018). Compared to modified Hummers method, electrochemical oxidation has been considered as a more ideal approach to synthesize GO recently due to its easier, faster and less contamination of heteroatoms. Different from graphene synthesis with neutral electrolyte, the electrolyte for GO synthesis is usually made of strong oxidizing substances, such as H2SO4 (Gurzęda et al., 2017; Lowe et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2014), H3PO3 (Gurzęda et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2017), and HNO3 (Gurzęda and Krawczyk, 2018). In electrochemical oxidation progress, graphite electrode is oxidized to GO by hydroxyl and oxygen radicals and then falls off into the electrolyte (Wu et al., 2014). Moreover, the oxidation level and defect density of GO can be controlled by changing electrolyte compositions, optimizing applied voltages and tuning electrochemical oxidation time (Fang et al., 2019)."
6,Synthesis of RGO,"2.3 Synthesis of RGO RGO has been deemed as graphene in early researches. However, almost all reduction methods cannot completely remove oxygen atoms and repair defects caused by oxidation. These factors contribute to the difference in physical and chemical properties between graphene and RGO (Alazmi et al., 2016; Avouris, 2010; Fernández-Merino et al., 2010; Ishizaki et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2011a; Pei and Cheng, 2012; Shin et al., 2009; Stankovich et al., 2007). RGO not only overcomes the poor conductivity of GO, but also introduces OFGs and defects which are beneficial for ORR (Kim et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019). Currently, there are three main methods to reduce GO: thermal reduction, chemical reagent reduction and electrochemical reduction, corresponding to the products thermal reduced graphene oxide (TRGO), chemical reductants reduced graphene oxide (CRGO) and electrochemical reduced graphene oxide (ERGO), respectively. 2.3.1 Thermal reduction Thermal reduction is a fast, effective way to reduce GO to TRGO. TRGO is obtained by heating GO at high temperature in inert or reductive gas atmosphere (Schniepp et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2009). In thermal reduction process, high temperature leads to the OFGs attached on carbon plane decompose into CO or CO2 gases and expands the spaces between graphene sheets. The reduction level of TRGO can be controlled by adjusting the heating temperature. Schniepp et al. (2006) studied the relationship between heating temperature and C/O ratio and found that the C/O ratio of TRGO were 5.9, 6.5 and 13.1 when thermal reduction temperature came to 300 °C, 500 °C and 750 °C. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of TRGO has also been demonstrated to improve with higher reduction temperature. The electrical conductivity of TRGO film obtained at 550 °C, 700 °C, 900 °C and 1100 °C was 49, 93, 383 and 550 S/cm, respectively (Wang et al., 2008). In addition, annealing atmosphere is another key factor for the reduction degree of TRGO. Compared to inert or vacuum atmosphere, reducing atmosphere was benefit to achieve better reduction degree in thermal reduction. Wu et al. (2009) obtained TRGO with C/O ratio of 14.9 and conductivity of 1103 S/cm by annealing GO at 450 °C in an Ar/H2 (1:1) gas mixture, indicating that high quality RGO was able to be prepared at a lower temperature in H2 atmosphere. 2.3.2 Chemical reagent reduction Compared with thermal reduction method, chemical reagent reduction method has lower requirements on experimental equipment and lower preparation cost. CRGO can be obtained at room temperature by heating GO dispersion and reductants in water bath or oil bath. Strong reductants, such as hydrazine hydrate (Stankovich et al., 2007), NaHB4 (Shin et al., 2009), Vitamin C (Fernández-Merino et al., 2010) and hydroiodic acid (Pei et al., 2010) can effectively remove OFGs between layers in GO aqueous dispersion. The reduction degree of CRGO is greatly affected by reductants. Hydrazine hydrate is the most commonly used reagent to reduce GO (Zhang et al., 2018). Although the RGO reduced by hydrazine hydrate exhibited high reduction level, the agglomeration of prepared RGO caused by hydrophobicity is a disadvantage of hydrazine reduction (Kim et al., 2018; Stankovich et al., 2007). Metal hydrides, such as NaBH4, were effective to remove C=O species of GO but ineffective to remove epoxy groups, alcohol groups and carboxylic acids (Pei and Cheng, 2012). Vitamin C is an ideal reducing reagent due to its non-toxicity and chemical stability. Fernández-Merino et al. (2010) compared the reduction effects on GO between hydrazine hydrate and Vitamin C at the same condition. The result revealed that RGO reduced by Vitamin C exhibited similar reduction degree with hydrazine hydrate reduction but better dispersibility because Vitamin C avoided the aggregation of RGO sheets. 2.3.3 Electrochemical reduction Electrochemical reduction is a green approach to reduce GO because it avoid high energy consumption in thermal reduction and the use of dangerous reagents (e.g. hydrazine) in chemical reagent reduction. ERGO sheets or films are usually prepared in an electrochemical cell by using GO deposited substrates (e.g., carbon felt, liquid crystal display, glass carbon electrode) as working electrodes and inert electrodes (e.g., Pt sheet) as auxiliary electrodes (Dong et al., 2020). The GO reduction progress was occurred during the charging of the electrochemical cell. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) scanning is a method to determine the applied reduction potential of GO-modified electrode, Dong et al. (2016) found that GO modified electrode began to reduce at the range of −1.1 V to −1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.05 M Na2SO4. They also found that applying higher reduction potential could speed up the reduction progress but excessive reduction potential led the occurrence of hydrogen evolution reaction, thus damaging the electrochemical reduction. In addition, pH is another key parameter affecting GO reduction. Lower pH promoted the protons reduction to H2 and hindered GO reduction (Hilder et al., 2011). While higher pH induced RGO dissolution by residual hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxyl groups (Liu et al., 2011). Therefore, neutral solvent may be the best choice to reduce GO."
7,Nitrogen doped graphene,"2.4 Nitrogen doped graphene As pristine graphene is inert to the adsorption/activation of O2 and ORR intermediates, heteroatoms (B, N, P, S, F, etc.) doping has been developed as an efficient approach to further improve the activity of graphene (Jin et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013). Due to easy doping and superior performance, N atom is most widely used doping heteroatom in improving catalytic activity of graphene. N doping can break the electroneutrality of graphene and lead to the adjacent carbon atoms generate net positive charge density, thereby affecting the electronic properties of graphene (Li et al., 2009b). N atoms usually combine with carbon lattices by three bonding configurations in graphene, including graphitic N (also called quaternary N), pyridinic N, and pyrrolic N (Fig. 2 ). Specifically, when N atoms substitute C atoms in hexagonal rings, they are called graphitic N (sp2 hybridized). When N atoms locate at the edge or defects of graphene and combined to two C atoms, they are named as pyridinic N (sp2 hybridized). When N atom donate two p electrons to the π system and form a five-membered ring, they are called pyrrolic N (sp3 hybridized). Different synthesis methods lead to different forms of N-GR, thus showing various practical properties. Table 1 summarizes the main methods for synthesizing N-GR and their N-doping content and configurations. 2.4.1 CVD method In situ CVD is also developed to prepare N-GR. Different from graphene, N-GR was obtained by mixing nitrogen-containing gas (e.g., NH3) or nitrogenous organic precursors (e.g., acetonitrile, pyridine) with carbon source gas at high temperatures (Jin et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2010). With nitrogen precursors, N atoms were simultaneously incorporated into the lattice in the CVD growth of graphene films. In this method, N doping content and configurations can be controlled by tuning (i) the annealing time, (ii) gas flow rate and (iii) the ratio between carbon source and nitrogen source during the CVD process. For example, Wei et al. (2009) reported that the N doping level increased from 1.2 to 8.9 at.% when the CH4/NH3 ratio increased from 4:1 to 1:1. Luo et al. (2011b) adjusted the flow rate of ammonia gas and obtained N-GR with 16 at.% of pure pyridinic N, which provides an promising way to study the influence of specific N doping configuration on the catalytic performance of N-GR. 2.4.2 Solvothermal/hydrothermal approach Solvothermal and hydrothermal approaches are facile liquid process for gram-scale production of N-GR. Deng et al. (2011) developed a direct method to synthesize N-GR by mixing lithium nitride (Li3N) with tetrachloromethane (CCl4). The N-GR obtained by this method showed 4.5 at.% N content and graphitic N as the dominant N site. By adding cyanuric chloride (N3C3Cl3) and increasing heating temperature to 350 °C, the N content increased to 16 at.% and the dominant N doping site turned into pyridinic N and pyrrolic N, indicating that N precursor can significantly influence the N doping content and the N doping site. In addition, N-GR can also be obtained by heating graphene and N sources in solution. Yang et al. (2018) synthesized N-GR by heating and evaporating ethanol solution containing graphene and ammonium nitrate at 55 °C. The N content was 1.5 at.% and pyridinic N accounted 45% N doping site. Furthermore, solvothermal and hydrothermal approaches can also realize the reduction of GO and N doping simultaneously. Long et al. (2010) obtained N-GR by reducing GO in ammonia and hydrazine hydrate mixed solution. The N content increased from 0.03 wt% to 5 wt% and O content decreased from 48 wt% to 13 wt% when reducing at 80 °C. Interestingly, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N were still dominant N sites of N-GR in this method. These N bonding configuration results revealed that heating at low temperature failed to incorporate N atoms into graphitic carbon frameworks but only located N atoms at defective sites by surface modification (Wang et al., 2016). 2.4.3 Thermal treatment Typically, thermal treatment refers to heat graphene (or GO) with nitrogen precursors in an inert (or NH3) atmosphere at high temperature (≥800 °C) (Sheng et al., 2011; Su et al., 2019). Compared with solvothermal approach, thermal treatment avoids the contamination of heteroatoms. However, the N doping content of this method is relatively low. Geng et al. (2011) heated the graphene in NH3/Ar atmosphere between 800 and 1000 °C. The highest N amount of N-GR they obtained was 2.8 at.%. Su et al. (2019) heated graphene and melamine at 950 °C to obtain the maximum N content of N-GR only 2.1 at.%. In the following work, Su et al. (2020) adjusted the heating temperature and found that the N doping amount of N-GR reached to 8.0 at.% when heating temperature decreased to 400 °C. This indicated that low N doping level may be attributed to the C-N bonds of N-GR breaking caused by high temperature. Moreover, the N atoms is more likely to dope at the edge and defects of graphene in the thermal treatment progress. Wang et al. (2009) claimed that the edge of graphene was preferred to be functionalized by nitrogen atoms."
8,Types and preparation methods of graphene-based electrodes,"There are many forms of graphene-based electrodes, including: graphene and heteroatom-doped graphene modified electrodes, three-dimensional (3D) graphene modified electrodes, graphene-polymer composite modified electrodes, graphene-metals/metal oxides composite modified electrodes, and graphene-based gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). Next, we will discuss these electrodes and their preparation methods."
9,Graphene and heteroatom-doped graphene modified electrodes,"3.1 Graphene and heteroatom-doped graphene modified electrodes As a class of commercial porous electrodes, carbon felt, graphite felt and carbon cloth are widely used as electrodes for H2O2 production in previous work. As supporting electrodes, they are characterized by low cost, large specific surface area and good mechanical strength (Zhou et al., 2019). However, due to limited electrochemical activity, the yield of H2O2 produced by these electrodes is not satisfying (Yu et al., 2014). As a kind of active catalyst, graphene can enhance the electrochemical activity of commercial electrodes, thus achieving higher H2O2 yield. One of the most common ways to introduce graphene into electrodes is coating graphene ink on the surface of these commercial electrodes (Mousset et al., 2016a; Yang et al., 2017a). Graphene ink is prepared by mixing catalyst (e.g., graphene, RGO), binder (e.g., Nafion, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) and dispersing agent (e.g., water, ethanol). By brushing graphene ink on the outside of electrodes repeatedly, the graphene layer will be formed on the surface of electrodes (Fig. 3a). Yang et al. (2017a) coated electrochemically exfoliated graphene and carbon black on the surface of graphite felt. Due to higher electron transfer rate, the graphene modified electrode exhibited high H2O2 production rate (7.7 mg h−1 cm−2) and relatively low electric energy consumption (9.7 kW h kg−1). In another similar work, Su et al. (2019) coated N-GR on graphite felt and obtained higher H2O2 yield (8.6 mg h−1 cm−2) and similar energy consumption (9.8 kW h kg−1) indicating the superiority of producing H2O2 by N-GR. Since GO is well dispersed in water, it is easy to prepare GO modified electrodes by dropping GO dispersion casted onto electrodes. Based on three methods described in Section 2.3, the RGO modified electrodes can be prepared by reducing GO on the electrodes. Compared to brushing graphene ink, these methods exhibit the advantages that binder is not required and the reduction degree of GO can be controlled by tuning heating temperature and applied voltage. Among these methods, electrochemical reduction is considered as the best approach to reduce GO-based electrodes due to its low cost and less contamination (Le et al., 2015). The schematic progress of electrochemical reduction is depicted in Fig. 3b. Divyapriya et al. (2018) used electrochemical method to reduce GO on the surface of liquid crystal display (LCD) and obtained RGO-LCD. As RGO provides more active sites for LCD, the H2O2 yield of RGO-LCD reached to 15 mg L−1 h−1, which is 2 times higher than unmodified LCD."
10,Three-dimensional graphene based electrodes,"3.2 Three-dimensional graphene based electrodes Due to the limited specific surface area of 2D graphene, constructing 3D graphene based electrodes become a hot topic recently. 3D graphene can be divided into graphene hydrogels and graphene aerogels (graphene sponges or graphene foams). The enlarged surface area of graphene not only provides more sites for oxygen adsorption, but also provides more contact area for the electrode to contact the electrolyte during ORR (Wang et al., 2015). There are many approaches to synthesize 3D graphene electrodes. Yong et al. (2012) used CVD method to obtain 3D graphene foam. They used a nickel foam as the template and decomposed ethanol vapor at high temperature to grow graphene. Then the nickel templates were etched off with HCl solution to obtain graphene foam with perforated pore structure. As an anode in MFC, graphene foam showed four times specific power density compared to carbon cloth due to the large specific surface area. Wen et al. (2018) reported a hydrothermal method to prepare 3D graphene aerogels on titanium wire electrode (GA-Ti). The titanium wire was immersed in GO dispersion, After reducing GO solution with vitamin C at 95 °C, a graphite-based three-dimensional hydrogel was formed on the titanium wire. As a cathode in electrochemical system, GA-Ti showed 40% H2O2 production efficiency and can remove EDTA-Ni efficiently."
11,Graphene-polymer composite modified electrodes,"3.3 Graphene-polymer composite modified electrodes The combination of graphene with polymers is commonly used to promote 2e−selectivity and activity of electrodes. The OFGs on the surface of GO/RGO make it easy to interact with polymers, thus it can be used as a supporting material for preparing polymer-graphene composite electrodes. Understanding the synergistic and complementary effects between the polymers and the graphene family is key to designing polymer-graphene composite modified electrodes. For example, many conductive polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI), can further enhance electrical conductivity of graphene family through synergistic effects (Lv et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013a). Polydopamine (PDA) compensates the disadvantage of poor hydrophilicity of RGO, leading it easier to attach on carbon cloth (Li et al., 2020). Several approaches were developed to fabricate polymer-graphene composite modified electrodes, such as brushing method (Yang et al., 2017b), spraying method (Gnana kumar et al., 2014), solvent immersion method (Li et al., 2020), and electropolymerization method (Lv et al., 2013). Briefly, these methods refer to brushing, spraying, soaking and electrodepositing graphene and polymer mixed solution on the surface of electrodes. The hybrid of graphene with polymer electrodes achieved good performance in both anodes and cathodes. For example, Li et al. (2020) soaked carbon cloth in PDA–RGO mixture for 3 h, and the power density of PDA–RGO modified carbon cloth increased 6.1 times than pure carbon cloth in MFC. Liu et al. (2020) deposited GO, poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and sodium polystyrenesulfonate (NaPSS) on graphite felt for cathode. Due to higher conductivity, the H2O2 yield and current efficiency increased from 23.1 mg L−1 h−1 and 64% to 47.1 mg L−1 h−1 and 91%, respectively."
12,Graphene-metals/metal oxides composite modified electrodes,"3.4 Graphene-metals/metal oxides composite modified electrodes The decoration of metals/metal oxides nanoparticles provides possibilities for further improving catalytic activity of the electrodes. However, the performance of metallic nanoparticle modified electrodes will be degraded due to the dissolution and corrosion of the electrocatalyst during ORR. In this regard, graphene is usually used as a supporting material to improve the electroactive surface area and durability of catalyst (Yuan et al., 2017). Iron-loaded graphene is the most common catalyst in 2e− ORR because Fe2+/Fe3+ couple can catalytically decompose H2O2 into OH and realize the in-situ degradation of pollutants. Hydrothermal method is an effective method to prepare iron-loaded graphene composites because iron salts are easily dissolved in water. Divyapriya et al. (2017) heated FeCl3·6H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, and quinone-functionalized electrochemically exfoliated graphene (QEEG) mixed solution and then brushed the solution on the surface of carbon cloth, the QEEG- Fe3O4 modified carbon cloth were obtained. The H2O2 yield of the QEEG/Fe3O4 modified carbon cloth was 0.3 mg cm−2 h−1, which is only 44% yield of QEEG modified carbon cloth. However, the removal rate of bisphenol A by QEEG/Fe3O4 was 2.4 times higher than that of QEEG. A plausible explanation was that the presence of Fe2+ caused the H2O2 to decompose into OH quickly. Besides Fe3O4, Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair also existed in Fe2O3, ferrocene, and FeOOH (Özcan et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2015). These iron oxides decorated graphene have been developed for H2O2 production and in-situ degradation of pollutants. Besides iron oxides, other non-noble metal and their oxides decoration were also used for H2O2 electrogeneration and achieved good performance, such as tungsten oxides (Mi et al., 2019), cerium oxides (Pinheiro et al., 2018), and vanadium oxides (Moraes et al., 2014)."
13,Graphene-based GDE,"3.5 Graphene-based GDE Traditional cathodes are submerged in electrolyte. In ORR progress, oxygen is pumped into the electrolyte by aeration and forms H2O2 by combining H+ on the electrode surface. The disadvantage of submerged cathodes is that the ORR efficiency is restricted by the dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte. GDE is a thin film structure of electrode that has been widely applied to improve H2O2 production rate by enhancing O2 transfer to the interface of electrodes. The comparison of graphene-based submerged cathodes and graphene-based GDEs is depicted in Fig. 4 . Different from submerged electrodes, the oxygen supply of GDEs come from the air. The oxygen can reach to the interface of catalyst layer through micropores of diffusion layer, thus aeration is not required in graphene-based GDEs. The advantage of GDEs is that it forms a three-phase interface, which allows oxygen, electrons, and protons to be fully supplied from electrolyte, external air and electrode (An et al., 2019b). The preparation of graphene-based GDE is mainly based on rolling and pressing method (Dong et al., 2020; Li et al., 2016). An et al. (2017) reported a rolling method to prepare a sandwich-like GDE. The schematic rolling process is shown in Fig. 5 . The catalyst layer of GDE was prepared by first mixing supporting carbon materials (e.g., graphite, carbon black), catalyst (e.g., graphene family), binder (e.g., Nafion, PTFE) and dispersing agent (e.g., water, ethanol) and then rolling it on the one side of current collector (e.g., stainless steel wire mesh, Cu mesh). The diffusion layer was prepared by mixing carbon materials (e.g., carbon black), binder and dispersing agent, and then rolling to the other side of the collector. GDE prepared by this method showed high active site, thus the H2O2 production rate can reach to 461 mg L−1 h−1 with current efficiency of 89% (An et al., 2019b). Zhang et al. (2018) mixed RGO, graphite and PTFE in water bath to obtain a paste mixture. By cold-pressing the paste on nickel mesh, the RGO-graphite-GDE obtained. Due to improved electrochemical conductivity and porous structure, the RGO modified graphite GDE exhibited higher H2O2 production rate (60 mg L−1 h−1) than graphite GDE (49 mg L−1 h−1)."

15,Oxygen reduction pathway,"4.1 Oxygen reduction pathway ORR pathway refers to the tendency of cathodes to reduce O2 to produce H2O2 (2e− pathway, or H2O2 pathway) or H2O (4e− pathway). Most carbon materials such as graphite, carbon black, CNT, acetylene black, and graphene, showed 2e− pathway because the oxygenated species bind too weakly on their surfaces to break the O–O bond, resulting in the formation of H2O2 (Pozzo et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2019; Xue et al., 2018). It is worth noting that various configurations of defects may be formed due to chemical treatment or thermal treatment during the synthesis of graphene (Terrones et al., 2012). These defects influence the ORR pathway by tuning the electronic structure of graphene. Chen et al. (2018) simulated different types of defect in graphene sheets with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to discover most of defective graphene tended to reduce O2 by 2e− pathway. In addition, heteroatoms doping (mainly O and N atoms) has always been a hot topic to regulate the structure of graphene in 2e− ORR (Feng et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2018). O doping is the most common form in graphene because many OFGs were created on the surface of graphene during the synthesis of GO and RGO. Moderate O doping content can change the chemical environment around the active site and promote the 2e− pathway. Lu et al. (2018) found that the selectivity of 2e− pathway was positively correlated with the amount of OFGs on carbon surface. By DFT calculation, they purposed that the C atoms adjacent to C–O–C and –COOH groups were active sites for 2e− ORR. However, GO is not suitable as a direct catalyst because excessive oxidation significantly reduces the electrical conductivity of graphene. Recent researches hold a view that mildly reduced graphene oxide (mrGO) was high selective and stable electrocatalysts for H2O2 formation. Kim et al. (2018) developed a few-layered mildly reduced graphene oxide (F-mrGO), which exhibited 2e− ORR pathway in a wide range of voltages, even with potentials as high as 0.80 V. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms along the edge of the graphene sheet are the active sites for the 2e− pathway. Compared with O doped graphene, N-GR receives more attention in 4e− ORR for generating H2O directly in previous studies (Liu et al., 2016; Qu et al., 2010). Recent studies showed that different N doping content and N doping sites may lead to different ORR pathways; therefore, it is possible to find a kind of highly 2e− selective and active N-GR for H2O2 production. Recent studies have shown that graphitic N can promote the O2 adsorption to nearby carbon atoms and obtain electrons to generate H2O2 by 2e− pathway, while pyridinic N can lead to the breakage of O-O bonds, which can decompose H2O2 to H2O and OH (Guo et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013; Su et al., 2019). Hence, doping N atoms at specific sites is a key to promote 2e− pathway. Interestingly, the conversion of graphite N to pyridinic N and pyrrolic N occurred during the ORR process, which may also affect the reusability of N-GR (Su et al., 2020). Many metal oxides (MO) nanoparticles supported on graphene has been shown to improve the H2O2 selectivity in both acidic and alkaline media. Carneiro et al. decorated Nb2O5 nanoparticles on RGO to increase the H2O2 yield due to the synergistic effect of metal oxides and graphene in acidic and alkaline conditions (Carneiro et al., 2015). ZrO2 nanoparticles supported RGO was also proved to be effective in increasing H2O2 selectivity due to enhancement of active sites for 2e− ORR (Carneiro et al., 2017)."
16,Oxygen mass transfer,"4.2 Oxygen mass transfer As the key raw material for ORR, sufficient oxygen supply is necessary for H2O2 generation. It is an effective method to promote O2 adsorption by using materials with larger surface to prepare electrodes. Compared to specific surface area of other carbon materials such as graphite (~10 m2 g−1) and carbon nanotubes (~1315 m2 g−1), graphene exhibits particularly high theoretical surface area (2630 m2 g−1) (Brownson and Banks, 2010), thus graphene modified cathodes provided a large surface area for oxygen adsorption, thus promoting H2O2 production. Yang et al. (2017a) coated graphene on graphite felt and found that the BET surface area increased 2.5 times, resulting in more active sites for oxygen adsorption. In addition, graphene modification also facilitated the formation of mesoporous structure, which facilitate not only the oxygen diffusion but also the H2O2 release to prevent it further reducing to water (Park et al., 2014). Beyond porous structure, another potential function for graphene/RGO modification is to increase hydrophobicity of electrodes, which promote oxygen diffusion at the interface and boost H2O2 yield (Zhao et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2020) found that hydrophobic GDE can promote oxygen reach to the interface of catalytic layer more quickly, and greatly improve the oxygen diffusion coefficient and oxygen utilization efficiency of cathode. Heteroatom doping is considered as an effective approach to further improve the O2 adsorption capacity of graphene (Yang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2012). Take N doping as an example, due to the electronegativity of N (3.04) atoms higher than C (2.55) atoms, the introduction of N atoms could break the electroneutrality of graphene (Qu et al., 2010). The C atoms adjacent to N atoms generate net positive charge density, resulting in absorbing O2 and capturing electrons to produce H2O2 and then released out from graphene (Guo et al., 2016)."
17,Electron transfer rate,"4.3 Electron transfer rate As graphene nanosheets exhibit excellent electron mobility (200,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 with charge density ~2 × 1011 cm−2) (Brownson and Banks, 2010), graphene modification improve the conductivity of most electrodes effectively. Specifically, the RGO modified graphite electrode showed higher conductivity than pure graphite electrode (15 S m−1 vs. 4.6 S m−1). The H2O2 generation rate also improved 2.4 times (Zhang et al., 2018). Mousset et al. (2016a) discovered that graphene ink coating decreased the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of carbon cloth by 97% and increased the maximum H2O2 yield by 87 ± 11% by facilitating electron transport. Wang et al. (2019) found that the peak current of graphene modified carbon felt (graphene-CF) was 3.6 times higher than CNT modified carbon felt (CNT-CF), accompanied by double H2O2 yield. Apart from CNT, carbon black, graphite and most other carbon materials have also showed lower conductivity than graphene (Yang et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2018). Compared to graphene, N-GR exhibited better conductivity because N-doping caused the polarization of the carbon network, which influenced the electronic structure (Li et al., 2009b). The electrical conductivity of N-GR modified carbon cloth was 35 ± 3 S/cm, which can be even comparable to Pt/C modified carbon cloth (Feng et al., 2011). Graphite N was considered as the effective N doping site to enhance conductivity, which favors electron transport during ORR (Shao et al., 2010). Su et al. (2019) found that the content of graphite N was linearly positive correlated to current density and yield of H2O2 by accelerating electron transfer. Due to the excellent properties mentioned above, graphene-based electrodes are widely used for H2O2 production. We summarized recent works in Table 2 to compare H2O2 production rate, and current efficiency by various graphene-based cathodes."
18,Prospects and challenges,"Nowadays, researchers believed that many noble metal based catalysts can be replaced by carbon materials. With the development of modification methods, the 2e− ORR catalytic performance of graphene family is getting better and better. However, the difficulty of mass production of graphene hinders its further development in H2O2 production. The preparation methods of graphene varies greatly, resulting in different properties of the prepared graphene. Therefore graphene field needs to establish a standard to evaluate the graphene produced by all methods. Moreover, the understanding on graphene family used in 2e− ORR is not enough. Although some studies have revealed the basic functions of graphite N and pyridinic N, the difference between N-GR used in 2e− pathway or 4e− pathway in ORR remains to be further studied. Furthermore, there are also considerable difficulties in graphene family combined with other materials. For example, CNT and graphene composite materials is a research hotspot in recent years with exciting application prospect. However, there is still a long way to apply CNTs and graphene composites to practical field due to the load transfer interface problems. BES used in H2O2 production is an exciting topic but still in its infancy, the incomparable advantages of BESs have attract many scientists to study it. The anode performance of BES is usually determined by biocompatibility, extracellular electron transfer efficiency between the bacteria and electrode, conductivity of the electrode. The cathode performance of BES is usually determined by ORR pathway, oxygen adsorption, electrochemical activity. Developing more conductive, low-cost and bacteria-adhesive graphene based anodes has received extensive attention and researches in BES. However, there are few studies on the application of graphene-based cathodes used for H2O2 production in BES, which requires more studies to enrich it."
19,Conclusion,"Recently, graphene-based electrodes have attracted considerable interest in both electrochemical and bioelectrochemical system. As a cathode catalyst, graphene not only shows 2e− pathway of ORR, but also promote oxygen adsorption and transfer, electron transfer and provide more active sites, thus promoting the production of H2O2. Due to different approaches to tune its structure, graphene has the potential to perform different functions including H2O2 production. Graphene, RGO can be employed effectively in several ways, for examples, supported onto carbon or graphite electrodes or carbon cloth, combined with CNTs, and metal oxide catalysts, coated on submerged cathodes or used in gas diffusion electrodes. N-GR was the best option in H2O2 production, with its very good conductivity, high surface area, and good stability. Graphene and its derivatives were highly potential to act an ideal catalyst for highly efficient H2O2 generation in electrochemical system."
