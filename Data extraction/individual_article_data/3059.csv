0,Introduction,"Nowadays, fossil fuels are the most commonly used source of energy. The combustion of fossil fuels caused the increment in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which has led to some global problems, such as climate change and global warming [1,2]. According to the importance of environment and the international warnings related to the global warming, the development of clean energies was considered recently. Hydrogen and renewable sources including bioenergy, solar, wind, geothermal, marine and hydropower energy are two important categories of clean energy. Hydrogen is expected to have a key role in the world’s future energy via replacing fossil fuels due to its easy conversion to heat and power [3–5]. It is also known asan environmental friendly fuel and high power density for transportation fuel and electricity generation. When hydrogen burns, its combustion byproduct is water vapor, which is a non-toxic material. Hydrogen has a wide range of application in both petroleum refining and chemical industries such asalcohols, ammonia synthesis and many other important industrial productions. Hydrogen can be produced from several methods, such as reforming of hydrocarbon, gasification of biomass, water electrolysis and thermochemical water splitting [6–11]. The production cost and the purity of hydrogen are important factors, which are highly regarded in various applications. Reforming of hydrocarbons such as CH4 is known as one of the most economical methods for the producing of hydrogen. In this process, the purity of produced hydrogen in reformer could be approached to about 70% [12,13]. The post processing is needed for the enrichment of hydrogen concentration is the produced gas stream. The methane reforming process could be improved using chemical looping reforming (CLR) and sorption enhanced chemical looping reforming (SECLR) strategies. The CLR process is one of the most promising methods that can be applied to produce hydrogen with reducing the amount of released carbon. Chemical looping reforming of natural gas or light hydrocarbons such as methane is a new technology for partial oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels, which has been studied on the basis of chemical looping combustion [14,15]. Chemical looping steam reforming can be mentioned asa possible method for producing hydrogen from either conventional or renewable sources like biomass. Recently, CLR process has attracted considerable attention because of the significant reduction in separation costs by splitting the process into two consecutive oxidation and reduction steps [16,17]. In this process, a catalyst containing a solid metal oxide called oxygen carrier (OC) is applied as a source of undiluted oxygen to produce synthesis gas via alternative oxidation and reduction of oxygen carrier [18]. These two steps including partial oxidation of methane and re-oxidation of oxygen carrier are given by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) CH 4 + MeO → CO + Me + 2 H 2 (2) Me + 1 2 O 2 → MeO In addition, other side reactions such as methane decomposition, steam methane reforming and water gas shift reaction would be participated in the reaction media [19]. (3) CH 4 ( g ) ↔ C ( s ) + 2 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 74 kJ mol - 1 (4) CH 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ 3 H 2 ( g ) + CO ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 206 kJ mol - 1 (5) CH 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) ↔ 4 H 2 ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 165 kJ mol - 1 (6) CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ H 2 ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = - 41 kJ mol - 1 A unique process is innovated when chemical looping reforming and in situ CO2 sorption are combined, which is called sorption enhanced chemical looping reforming. The CO2 sorption could be conducted through the direct reaction between an alkaline or alkaline earth metal and carbon dioxide at high reforming temperature. The sorbents of SECLR process require some specific properties such as: high capacity of CO2 sorption, lower energy of regeneration, high thermal/mechanical stability, suitable CO2 sorption kinetics and low production cost. According to this description, calcium oxide based sorbents are considered as the most promising high-temperature CO2 sorbents [12,20]. The calcium oxide reacts with CO2 in the following exothermic reaction: (7) CO 2 ( g ) + CaO ( s ) ↔ CaCO 3 ( s ) Δ H 298 K = - 179 kJ mol - 1 According to the upon reaction, the concentration of carbon dioxide could be reduced in the reaction media. The removal of produced CO2 could proceed the water gas shift reaction towards producing more hydrogen according to Le Chatelier’s principle [12,15]. In fact, the SECLR process is a novel method for producing hydrogen with high purity. This process includes three different steps: firstly, methane is partially oxidized by oxygen carrier and steam. At the same time, the produced CO2 could be removed from reaction media using CO2 sorbents. In the second step, the sorbents are transferred to the calcination reactor that is working at high temperature. The used sorbents are regenerated under endothermic reverse of reaction (7) and the calcium carbonate is decomposed to the CO2 and CaO. Finally, the oxygen carrier is reoxidized to its original state in the air reactor in accordance with reaction (2) before returning to carbonation reactor. In this regard, Dou et al. [21] reported that syngas with high purity of hydrogen (above 90%) was gained using NiO/NiAl2O4 as the oxygen carrier and CaO as sorbent at temperature of 500–600°C. Antzara and his co-workers [22] synthesized NiO-based oxygen carrier supported on ZrO2 and zirconium promoted CaO sorbent. Then they used the mixture of oxygen carrier and sorbent in the SECLR process. The process was performed over 20 consecutive reforming/regeneration cycles at 650°C. The results showed the excellent stability of synthesized materials without deterioration during 20 cycles. They showed that hydrogen production through the combination of chemical looping reforming and CO2 sorption could effectively reduce the production costs (about 55%) in comparison to conventional steam methane reforming. Overall, the calcium oxide could be applied for producing hydrogen from methane according to the following reaction, which is the combination of the side reactions (Eqs. (4)–(7)) [23–25]: (8) 2 CH 4 ( g ) + 4 H 2 O ( g ) + CaO ( s ) ↔ CaCO 3 ( s ) + 8 H 2 ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 151 kJ mol - 1 Calcium oxide also has good characteristics such as ability to control the coke formation and low cost [26,27]. Thus, the calcium based bifunctional catalyst-sorbent has a high potential for producing hydrogen in chemical looping reforming process and operates through a mechanism similar to SECLR, as depicted in Fig. 1 . Therefore, the reforming reactions, water gas shift reaction and CO2 sorption could be performed simultaneously using the calcium based bifunctional catalyst-sorbent [23]. Some researchers studied the application of calcium as the promoter or sorbent in reforming process. Hafizi and his co-workers [28] investigated the influence of calcium position in the structure of Fe/Al2O3 oxygen carrier on its feasibility and activity in CL-SMR process. The results showed that the sample with 5wt% Ca synthesized by co-impregnation method improved OC activity. In the study on the Ca-promoted Ni/α Al2O3 catalyst performed by Hou et al. [29] it was found that calcium can help to improve the nickel dispersion, avoid the fast sintering of it, and reinforce the interaction between Ni and Al2O3. Dang and the co-workers [30] studied a bifunctional catalyst (Co-CaO-Ca12Al14O33) in sorption enhanced steam reforming of glycerol for producing hydrogen rich syngas. They found that at the Ca/Al ratio of 2.8, the sorption capacity and the catalytic activity are increased. Owing to the low tendency of calcium to participate in reforming reaction and the rapid decay of pure calcium oxide in CO2 sorption [26], the addition of an active metal oxide as oxygen carrier is suggested. Selecting the appropriate oxygen carrier has a key role on the efficiency of CLR process. The proper oxygen carrier should have some characteristics including high methane conversion, adequate rate of oxidation and reduction, sufficient capacity for oxygen transportation, significant mechanical strength against the agglomeration and attrition and thermal/chemical stability. According to these properties some metal oxides such as Ni, Co, Mn, Fe and Cu can be used as feasible candidates [11,14,15,31]. Among these materials, Fe and Ni-based oxygen carriers are commonly investigated during the last years due to the high activity and resistance. The most important disadvantages of Ni-based oxygen carriers are coke formation and fast sintering at high reaction temperature. The Fe-based oxygen carriers are unsuitable for a long term cyclic operation due to their rapid reactivity degrade after a few redox cycles. Furthermore, Cu- and Mn-based oxygen carriers have relatively low melting point and thus have high tendency to sintering and agglomeration [17,32–34]. Some researchers are focused on the activity of Co-based oxygen carriers in the CL-SMR process. Also, catalysts containing cobalt possess remarkable advantages, such as high catalytic activity and low cost in addition to its high oxygen capacity [35–37]. Therefore, cobalt seems to be a suitable oxygen carrier for chemical looping process. One of the best methods to prevent sintering and carbon deposition is the addition of structural promoters. Researchers have developed different promoters such as Ce [27,38], Zr [39], La [40] and Mg [41] in the reforming process. Significantly, zirconium has been used as a promoter in the structure of catalysts for increasing the mechanical and thermal stability. It could also regulate the pore size distribution and increase the porosity of catalysts [39,42]. Wu et al. [43] examined the effect of ZrO2 as a modifier of Ni-CaO catalyst, which was used in steam methane reforming (SMR) for the production of hydrogen. They observed that the addition of ZrO2 increased the stability and surface area of the mentioned catalyst. Moreover, the existence of zirconium in the catalyst structure could significantly prevent the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel. The main objective of this paper is the examination of an innovated bifunctional catalyst-sorbent in the modified chemical looping steam methane reforming process for one step production of hydrogen rich stream. The direct reaction between bifunctional catalyst-sorbent and methane is the main reaction of this process. For this purpose, the calcium oxide was selected in order to enhance the purity of hydrogen and with the aim of increasing the activity of catalyst, cobalt was used as an oxygen carrier in the structure of samples. Improvement in the surface area and textural properties of bifunctional catalyst-sorbent was performed by the incorporation of zirconium in the sample structure. In addition, the process and synthesis variables including S/C molar ratio, cobalt and zirconium loading percentage and reduction temperature are studied. Catalytic activity of these samples during consecutive reduction-calcination/oxidation cycles are examined in CL-SMR process. Some fresh and used catalysts were characterized using different physicochemical methods to find out the textural properties, morphology, crystalline structures and metal oxide interaction. Finally, the lifetime of catalysts and its performance are studied over the cycles."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The bifunctional catalyst-sorbents were synthesized using the co-precipitation method. In the first step, a desired amount of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (Merck) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck) were separately dissolved in deionized water at room temperature. After that, solutions were mixed with different Co:Ca weight percentages (Co:Ca=90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 30:70, 20:80, 10:90 and pure calcium). The co-precipitation was performed isothermally at 80°C and atmospheric pressure with NaOH in a glass balloon equipped with a condenser. For this purpose, a 0.5M solution of NaOH as the precipitation agent was added drop-by-drop at a constant flow rate (4mlmin−1) into the reaction balloon under violent stirring. The initial pH of the resulting slurry was considered to be 11.0±0.1. After that, the precipitate was kept stirred at 80°C for an additional 15h. Then, the slurry was filtered and washed repeatedly with hot deionized water. Hence, the samples were dried at 100°C overnight and calcined subsequently at 700°C for 3h with the heating ramp of 4°Cmin−1. In addition, it should be noticed that the samples undergo a calcination/oxidation step at 750°C for 1h prior to each experiment. The pure calcium oxide is labeled as synthesized CaO. The samples were denoted as Ca-Co (x), wherein x represents the mass fraction of Ca/Co. In the second steps, the Zr modified Ca-Co samples were synthesized with the same procedure. For this purpose, an aqueous solution of Cl2OZr·8H2O (Merck) was added to the Ca(NO3)·4H2O and Co(NO3)·6H2O solutions and precipitation was performed. The products of this stage were expressed as Ca-Co-Zr (x, y), where x and y are denoted as the mass fraction of Ca/Co and Ca/Zr, respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were obtained on a Bruker D8 advanced powder diffractometer via monochromatic Cu Ka radiation operated at 40mA and 40kV. The XRD data of samples were collected with a continuously scanning rate of 2° per minute for 2θ ranged from 10° to 90°. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to analyze the textual properties (average pore diameter, specific surface area and pore volume) of samples by means of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The specific area was calculated by determining the amount of nitrogen absorbed. The cumulative volumes of pores were achieved via the BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) method and the desorption branches of adsorption isotherms were applied to finding out the pore size distributions. The N2 adsorption analyzes were performed using an automated gas adsorption instrument (ASAP 2020). The samples were degassed under vacuum with nitrogen at 250°C for 3h before measurements. For examining the morphology of the fresh and used samples, the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed applying a MIRA3 TESCAN apparatus. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of samples was also achieved to find the average composition and chemical analysis."
4,Reactor system,"2.3 Reactor system The gas-solid reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor with 16mm diameter and 1000mm length as depicted in Fig. 2 . The fixed bed reactor was heated by a vertical cylindrical electric furnace and the temperature was measured via aK-type thermocouple placed in the center of the reactor bed. The flow rate of different gas streams including Ar (99.999% purity) as the carrier gas, CH4 (99.995% purity) as reactant and O2 (99.995% purity) as oxidant were measured and controlled via mass flow controllers (Unit instruments, model UFC 1661) and mixed in a gas mixer. The steam was produced by injection of deionized water in a heat traced line at 250°C with a high accurate syringe pump and then mixed with gaseous stream at the entrance of the reactor. The output stream was passed through a condenser to separate the excess water or small particles from gaseous products. Then, the product dry gas analysis was carried out with an online gas chromatograph (Bruker 450 GC) equipped by a thermal conductivity detector."
5,Process activity,"2.4 Process activity In the present study, the CL-SMR process with periodic reduction- calcination/oxidation cycles were performed in the fixed bed reactor discussed above by exposing the catalyst to an intermittent gas streams. The process was performed under isothermal conditions at 500–750°C and atmospheric pressure. In each test, 1.5g of freshly calcined catalyst (100–200 mesh size) was placed on the porous plate in the reactor media. The reactor was heated to 700°C in a 20% O2 balance with Ar at a total flow rate of 180mlmin−1 in order to fully oxidize the catalysts prior to experiments. In the reduction period, the reactant gas stream containing CH4 (60mlmin−1) diluted in Ar (120mlmin−1) were mixed with steam and fed to the reactor for 45min. After reduction, the calcination/oxidation section was performed at 700°C under 20% O2 flow for about 60min. In fact, the calcination of catalyst continues as long as the concentration of CO2 approached to about zero. Therefore, the diluted oxygen was flown into the reactor for complete oxidization of catalyst and the reactor temperature was increased to 700°C for the calcination of CaCO3. Each step in acycle was swept by pure Ar for 3min, in order to remove all of the residual gases in the reactor. For the determination of methane conversion and hydrogen production yield the following equations were applied: (9) X CH 4 = F CH 4 in - F CH 4 out F CH 4 in ∗ 100 (10) H 2 Yield = F H 2 2 ∗ F CH 4 in ∗ 100 where F CH 4 in is the inlet molar flow rate of methane (molmin−1), F CH 4 out is the outlet molar flow rate of F H 2 methane (molmin−1) and X CH 4 is methane conversion. is the outlet molar flow rate of hydrogen."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of samples,"3.1 Characterization of samples The X-ray diffraction patterns of some fresh samples were collected to investigate the crystalline phases formed in these samples; shown in Fig. 3 . In this figure, the patterns express the existence of CaO, Ca(OH)2, Co3O4, ZrO2 along with calcium-cobalt spinel (Ca2Co2O5) and calcium-zirconium mixed oxide (CaZrO3) in fresh sample structure that is proved by means of the JCPDS data bank. The CaO in fresh samples could be observed at 2θ=32.3°, 37.5°, 54°, 64.3°, 67.5°, 79.8° and 88.8° (cod No. 01-082-1691). As indicated in Fig. 3, addition of zirconium could prevent the formation of Ca2Co2O5 spinel in the crystalline structure of synthesized sample. Hence, losing the active sites of calcium and cobalt in the structure of catalyst became lower, thus the better catalyst performance is expected. Fig. 4 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of fresh samples. The isotherms represent the type-IV isotherm and H3-type hysteresis loop. Also, the difference in BJH pore size distributions between fresh samples is displayed in this figure. It is clear that the pore size distribution is regulated by the addition of zirconium to the structure. The textural properties of the fresh samples including BET surface area, average pore size and pore volume are listed in Table 1 . The results showed that the synthesized Ca sample has the surface area of 20.4m2 g−1. In addition, BET surface area of Co-Ca (9) and Co-Ca-Zr (9,4.5) fresh catalysts are 14.0m2 g−1 and 17.0m2 g−1, respectively. Note that the addition of cobalt to the structure of catalysts has reduced the surface area about 31.4% then the addition of zirconium revealed about 21.4% improvement in the surface area. In comparison with Ca-Co (9), the reduction in average pore size of Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) sample and increase of its surface area, while the pore volume is almost constant which confirms the improving in the porosity of Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5). It is clear that zirconium has a positive influence on the formation of a more uniform and porous structure. Fig. 5 shows the FESEM images of fresh catalysts. According to these images, synthesized calcium (Fig. 5a) has a uniform structure, while the addition of cobalt (Fig. 5b) changes the morphology of calcium and tends to form a compact structure with a relatively lower surface area. As indicated in Fig. 5c, the presence of zirconium could solve this problem. It should be mentioned that crystal size of zirconium containing sample is much smaller than that of non-promoted. In addition, a more uniform structure is formed because the growth of CaO particles is inhibited in the presence of zirconium [44]. Thus, these images confirm the results of BET surface area."
8,Effect of steam to carbon molar ratio,"3.2 Effect of steam to carbon molar ratio The steam to carbon molar ratio is a key parameter for determining reaction pathways of methane and product distribution in the CL-SMR process. High steam concentration is undesirable because it decreases the energy efficiency of the process and rises the operating costs [21]. Therefore, an adequate adjustment of steam concentration, which indicates the appropriate S/C molar ratio seems to be essential. So, Ca-Co (1) was tested with various S/C molar ratios (1–5) at reduction temperature of 650°C to obtain high methane conversion and hydrogen yield. According to Fig. 6 , the optimal average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield were observed at S/C molar ratio of 2. In this ratio, the average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield are 59.1% and 51.8%, respectively."
9,Effect of reaction temperature and Co-Ca composition,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature and Co-Ca composition With the aim of illustrating the effect of Co-Ca composition and reduction temperature, the samples were synthesized with different calcium to cobalt ratio varied from 0.11 to 9 and pure Ca. In addition, different samples were examined in CL-SMR process under different reaction temperatures (500–750°C). Fig. 7 a and b demonstrates the influence of these two factors on the average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield, respectively. For example, the average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield of Ca-Co (0.11) are about 37.6% and 31.3% at 700°C, respectively. These values increase with increasing mass ratio of calcium to cobalt (x) and reached to 95.4% and 81.5% for Ca-Co (9) at 700°C. Cobalt can improve the performance of catalyst asa proper oxygen carrier in the reduction step; but according to the FESEM image (Fig. 5b), addition of cobalt makes the structure more compact and reduces the surface area. Therefore, the accessibility of the reactants to the internal pores is not possible. When the mass ratio of calcium to cobalt decreases from 9 to 0.11, it can be concluded that these disadvantages become more pronounced. Therefore, the average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield are decreased from 95.4% and 81.5% for Ca-Co (9) to 37.6% and 31.3% for Ca-Co (0.11) at 700°C. Thus, Fig. 7a and b confirms that the catalytic performance of synthesized catalysts with various amounts of Ca show a maximum by increasing the calcium content up to 90% (Ca-Co (9)), indeed the presence of calcium is an essential factor for the progress of Eq. (8). Note that the catalytic activity is decreased by further increase of calcium content. The average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield over synthesized pure calcium is reduced to about 93.6% and 79.7% at 700°C, respectively. It could be due to the sintering of pure calcium or loss of the active sites. In addition, Fig. 7a reveals that increasing the reaction temperature from 500 to 750°C increases the methane conversion for all samples. According to Fig. 7b, average hydrogen yield also follows a similar trend and increases from 1.4% at 550°C to 82.5% at 750°C for Ca-Co (9) catalyst, which could be reacted to the improvement in methane conversion. Therefore, the Ca-Co (9) catalyst that contains 90wt% calcium is selected as optimum Ca/Co ratio for further investigation."
10,"Effect of zirconium loading on the activity of Ca-Co-Zr (9,y) catalyst","3.4 Effect of zirconium loading on the activity of Ca-Co-Zr (9,y) catalyst In order to study the influence of zirconium on the activity of Ca-Co (9) catalyst, the samples were synthesized with different Zr loadings. The calcium to zirconium mass ratio in the catalyst structure was varied from 2.25 to 18, and tested in different reduction temperatures (500–750°C). Fig. 8 a and b demonstrates the effect of Zr loading percent on average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield. The results obviously revealed a maximum methane conversion using Ca/Zr mass ratio of 4.5 (16.67wt% zirconium) especially at lower temperatures. It is due to the formation of a more porous and uniform feature, which increases the accessibility of gaseous reactant to the inner catalyst layers. For instance, the average methane conversion is increased from about 3.0% for Ca-Co (9) to 60.9% for Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) at 500°C and these amounts are about 99% at high temperature. This figure confirms that the average methane conversion and average hydrogen production yield are increased with a rise in reduction temperature. The average methane conversion and average H2 yield are improved from about 60.9% and 53.9% at 500°C to 98.5% and 84.7% at 750°C using Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) sample. The comparison of Fig. 7a and b with Fig. 8a and b, shows that zirconium revealed a positive effect on the catalytic activity of bifunctional catalyst-sorbents. For example, the average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield are increased to 98.3% and 84.5% at 700°C for Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) while these percentages were about 95.4% and 81.5% at 700°C for Ca-Co (9) sample. Consequently, the Ca-Co-Zr (9, 4.5) bifunctional catalyst/sorbent showed highest activity and performance in CL-SMR process."
11,Time-on-stream behavior of the optimized samples,"3.5 Time-on-stream behavior of the optimized samples With the purpose of investigating the stability performance of optimized cobalt and zirconium containing samples, the catalysts including Ca, Ca-Co (9) and Ca-Co-Zr (9, 4.5) were tested in 16 alternative cycles. The reactions were carried out at reduction temperature of 700°C and steam to methane ratio of 2. As depicted in Fig. 9 a, the average methane conversion of calcium is reduced during 16 cycles from 98% to 94%. CaO particles have low thermal stability under cyclic operation and this decrease might be due to the sintering of these particles [20]. Addition of 10wt% cobalt to the CaO sample improves the methane conversion through third to the last cycle. The results showed that the presence of cobalt asan active metal in the structure of catalyst could improve the activity. In this sample, the average methane conversion was reduced slightly after the first 10 cycles. The average methane conversion of catalyst containing zirconium is improved and remained constant until last cycle. This procedure is expected for investigating the average hydrogen yield so that, Fig. 9b demonstrates the average hydrogen yield of catalyst containing zirconium is highest. Also, it has a good stability during consecutive redox cycles. For instance, the average hydrogen yield of Ca-Co-Zr (9, 4.5) is about 84.0% through third to the last cycle, while Ca and Ca-Co (9) are decreased about 1.6% and 1.5% from third cycle to sixteenth cycle, respectively. Sintering and pore blockage and thereby reducing the surface area are main reasons for this event. Zirconium is used asa structural modifier to suppress these defects. ZrO2 has significant effects on the oxygen transference and structural strength [43]. Fig. 9 confirms these specifications and shows that the addition of zirconium to sample could increase the catalyst resistance against sintering and more stable efficiency of catalyst is achieved during the cycles. Therefore, it confirms that the Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) synthesized with co-precipitation method revealed excellent recyclability over reduction–calcination/oxidation cycles. The gas composition of effluent steam (H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and O2) in a complete reduction and calcination/oxidation cycle using Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) at 700°C and steam to carbon molar ratio of 2, is depicted in Fig. 10 . It is clear that hydrogen with the purity of about 90.0% is produced within the reduction section. The carbon dioxide is produced by the reduction of calcium oxide with CH4 (Eq. (8)) and other side reactions (Eqs. (5) and (6)). However, the presence of about 1.2vol% CO2 in the reduction section could be due to the lower CO2 sorption properties of bifunctional catalyst-sorbent [45]. This figure also reveals that the methane peak value is 0.8% at 13min then decreased to about 0% at the end of reduction cycle. It can be understood that the catalytic activity is increasing during the reduction period, which might be due to the absence of coke formation on catalyst surface [46]. In the calcination/oxidation step, CO2 concentration is increased to about 3.8% that is related to the regeneration of calcium carbonate according to reversal reaction of Eq. (7). The calcination/oxidation will continue as long as all of carbon dioxide is released from the samples. It must be noted that the level of CO released from oxidation period is about zero. It indicates that no coke was formed on the catalyst structure."
12,Structural properties of used catalysts,"3.6 Structural properties of used catalysts Ca, Ca-Co (9) and Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) catalysts were characterized after 16 redox cycles in the CL-SMR process. Fig. 11 shows the XRD patterns of used samples corresponded to the possible presence of CaCO3, CoO, CoCO3, C2O4Co, Ca(OH)2, Co3O4, ZrO2 and calcium-cobalt spinel. Whereas, the presence of CaCO3 in used samples are obviously assigned at 2θ=23.2°, 29.5°, 36°, 39.5°, 43.2°, 47.5°, 48.5°, 57.7°, 60.9°, 64.6°, 81.5° and 84.1° (cod No. 00-002-0629). According to this figure, most of the peaks display the presence of calcium in the form of Ca(OH)2 in the used CaO sample, according to Eq. (11). Also in this sample, the peaks related to the calcium carbonate has lower intensities than other samples. These observations indicate that the main reaction (Eq. (8)) does not progress and the conventional reforming (Eqs. (4) or (5)) may be performed instead of the desired reaction. (11) CaO ( s ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ Ca ( OH ) 2 ( s ) Δ H 298 K = - 109 kJ mol - 1 It is clear from the figure that Zr containing sample has the largest number of CaCO3 peaks among all the samples. It shows that the addition of zirconium promoter to the catalyst structure has a positive effect on the reaction of CaO and CH4 (Eq. (8)). It might be due to the formation of more porous structure by adding zirconium to the sample that improves the access to the inner layer of calcium in the structure of catalyst [39]. Also, the presence of zirconium reduced the number and the intensity of peaks related to Ca2Co2O5 spinel. The comparison of fresh and used catalysts containing cobalt reveals the reduction of Co3O4 in the fresh sample to CoO after reduction test. Also, the comparison between fresh and used Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) catalyst suggests that CaZrO3 is an unstable mixed oxide, which cannot be considered as single phase (perovskite phase). It should be noted that the formation of CaZrO3 perovskite type occurs at higher temperature (1200–1400°C) for a long period of time, while the highest temperature is applied in this research was 750°C [47]. Therefore, it was converted to calcium oxide and zirconium oxide during the process. This phenomenon could improve the efficiency of active sites during the redox cycles. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of used samples express the type-IV isotherm and hysteresis loop of H3-type and H1-type (used Ca), as shown in Fig. 12 . In addition, the BET results of used catalysts show a reduction in surface area (Table 2 ), which could be due to the pore blockage and sintering at high reaction temperatures. For example, the surface area of fresh Ca is reduced from 20.4m2 g−1 to 3.8m2 g−1 (reduction of about 81.4%) after 16 redox cycles. This reduction is significantly lower for zirconium promoter sample (54.1%) because zirconium improves the mechanical stability. On the other hands, the presence of zirconium in the catalyst implies a good resistance to prevent sticking particles of catalyst during alternative calcination/oxidation - reduction cycles. Fig. 13 represents FESEM images of the used catalysts. Fig. 13a and b demonstrates sever sintering of calcium and Ca-Co (9) catalysts after reduction step, respectively. Several researchers have reported identical sintering [48,49]. Sintering takes place faster at higher temperatures and leads to grain growth and agglomeration of CaO [50], while the crystal size of calcium is about 100nm after reduction. The crystals of Ca-Co (9) catalyst is about 70–80nm. Sintering also reduced the activity of catalysts after a few cycles that it is more evident for used calcium sample (Fig. 13a). According to Fig. 13c, this phenomenon was controlled by zirconium. The comparison of Fig. 5a–c and Fig. 13a–c confirms the significant changes of initial porous catalysts to a less porous one after 16 redox cycles. Also, the particle size of fresh catalysts is increased after reduction period. In the case of Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5), this increase is much less than others (from 20–25nm to about 30–35nm). In fact, zirconium has increased the strength of catalyst operating under hard conditions and has prevented from the sintering. According to XRD patterns of used catalysts (Fig. 11), the absence of coke indicates that carbon is participated in the formation of calcium carbonate. Therefore, the amount of carbon detected by EDX analysis of used Ca, Ca-Co (9) and Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) could be a good criterion for the amount of calcium, which is participated in the reduction reaction. So, the molar ratio of carbon to calcium is investigated here in. Carbon content (mol.%), calcium content (mol.%) and the carbon to calcium molar ratio of the upon used samples are summarized in Table 3 . From Eq. (8) its clear that that one mole calcium oxide is needed for each mole of carbon participated at solid state to form CaCO3. Therefore, the carbon to calcium molar ratio must be equal to one at the complete conversion. This ratio for the synthesized calcium is 0.26 then rises to 0.6 for Ca-Co (9) and reached 0.76 for the zirconium promoted samples. When this ratio rises indeed the production of calcium carbonate increases. On the other hand, whatever the ratio of carbon to calcium is increased, the reduction equation proceeds and thereby hydrogen production increases. These results are confirmed by Figs. 7b and 8b. The obtained results showed that the application of calcium based bifunctional catalyst/sorbents could be further investigated for one step hydrogen production in industrial scale of proposed SE-CLR process. Thus further investigations is needed for studying the other promoters, oxygen carriers and testing these materials in bench scale setup."
13,Conclusion,"Different bifunctional catalyst-sorbents including Ca, Ca-Co (x) and Ca-Co-Zr (x, y) were prepared using co-precipitation method to find the optimal Ca/Co, Ca/Zr molar ratios, reduction temperature and S/C molar ratio. The synthesized catalysts were tested in modified chemical looping steam methane reforming process for producing hydrogen with high purity. Direct reaction between calcium oxide and CH4 was the main reaction of this process along with water gas shift reaction, methane steam reforming and in-situ CO2 sorption. The BET analysis and FESEM images of fresh samples revealed the negative effect of cobalt oxygen carrier on the porosity of bifunctional catalyst-sorbent, while zirconium improves the structural properties significantly. Cobalt as an appropriate oxygen carrier improved the reactivity of pure calcium. However, zirconium-modification of cobalt-calcium sample showed significant enhancement in methane conversion and hydrogen production performance. The characterization results showed the effect of zirconium oxide as a potential promoter for improving the structural properties of calcium-cobalt bifunctional catalyst/sorbent for hydrogen production. The average methane conversion of calcium was achieved to be about 93.6%, while it is increased to 95.4% for Ca-Co (9) and reached 98.3% using Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) at 700°C. The EDX analysis of used samples confirmed these results via calculating carbon to calcium molar ratio. The Ca and Ca-Co (9) catalysts give a drop in average methane conversion and average hydrogen yield by progressing the redox cycles, while Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) catalyst was stable during 16 redox cycles. Methane decomposition was inhibited in this process and the absence of coke was confirmed by XRD data of the used catalysts. The FESEM images and BET analysis of used samples showed the structural stability of Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) bifunctional catalyst-sorbent relatively preserved its morphology and crystal structure after being applied in the 16 redox cycles at 700°C. In general, the prepared Ca-Co-Zr (9,4.5) bifunctional catalyst-sorbent is suitable for producing high purity H2 in the modified CL-SMR process."
